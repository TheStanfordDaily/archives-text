Deterioration of black-Asian relations must end

AS MEMBERS OF THE Stanford
African-American and Asian-
American communities, we the
brothers of Alpha Phi Alpha and Lamb
da Phi Epsilon are uniting in response to
the Rodney King police brutality verdict.
In the aftermath of the court deci
sion, we were saddened by the violence
and distraught over the conflicts that
took place between our communities.
We felt that this crisis was the final
straw in terms of the deterioration of a
very problematic relationship between
the two "minorities." Even at Stanford,
a supposed center of rational and intelli
gent discourse, blacks and Asians fail to
effectively communicate and interact
with one another.
Although both the Black Student
Union and the Asian American Students
Association are very influential in their
respective communities, little effort has
been undertaken to form a coalition

addressing "minority" issues on campus.
For example, in a dance party held ear
lier this year that was jointly sponsored
by the Asian and black communities, the
two groups remained very bipolar, associ
ating only with their own ethnic groups.
At several forums held recently on
campus to discuss Korean-black relations,
students cited a lack of understanding as
the students blamed members of the
other group for not understanding their
own "unique" situations. Although the
histories of our people are not identical,
our commonalty lies in our existence as
externalities to mainstream society.
Although we are frequently denied
opportunities for advancement by present
social forces, we can unite in our struggle
to increase our presence in the systems
with which we find fault. Even at Stanford,
we have the same underlying concerns:
• Diversification of faculty in order to
promote mutual understanding and edu

cation;
• Non-discriminating minority admis
sion policy and clarification of Affirma
tive Action policy;
• An improved awareness of each
other's culture and history; and
• Co-existence and recognition as indi
viduals and human beings first and not
primarily as members of "ethnic groups"
or segregated entities.
Although Afrocentric living and
Sinocentric living are important in the
fortification and understanding of our cul
tures and one another, we must also make
strides towards human-centric living in
which we not only justify our humanity,
but our place in mainstream society.
And so, in response to the various vices
that our communities face and the under
lying tension within, we come together
not to voice our anger, but to channel our
anger into determination to seek solutions
— solutions that will bridge the gap

between both our communities. We need:
• Active exchanges between theme
houses;
• Co-sponsorship of social events and
programs describing our culture —
musical, theatrical, spiritual, philosophi
cal and culinary exchanges; and
• Joint community service projects to
educate our respective youth.
We need to unite, not only because
the violence between ourselves must be
stopped, but because the King verdict
implies that all people are in danger of
civil rights violations and the daily
inequities, insecurities, indignities,
humiliations and inhumane treatment
suffered in this land that is our "home."
Conviction means nothing unless it is
converted into conduct.
