# Whites must confront racism as a community
## 
### 
We need to look at what the real
problem is in terms of race relations in
this country. Is the problem really just
in South-Central Los Angeles or East
Palo Alto, or is it also in Simi Valley,
Palo Alto and our predominantly white
neighborhoods back home?
Maybe we need to step back for a
minute from our scramble to rebuild
South Central or to get East Palo Alto
teenagers not to deal drugs and think
about how to talk to people like the
jurors who thought the beating of Rod
ney King was justifiable.
Or how to deal with white people
whose only response is to arm them
selves, hire guards or build high walls to
keep reality out of view.
People of color have organized to
combat injustice; we have to be in active

solidarity with their efforts, but it is in
the places in our society that people of
color find hardest to reach where we as
white people are needed most.
Here at Stanford we have plenty of
opportunities to talk about what it
means to be white, and we have access
to our own community that people of
color will never have.
Why aren't we confronting ignorance
and institutional racism as a white com
munity? In the theme dorms "they" are
talking about what it means to be
black/Latino/Native American/Asian.
But what are we talking about in our
white theme houses — the dorms, the
Row, fraternities and organizations
which are up to 95 percent white?
In talking about what we can do, we
need to listen to what others have to say
without getting defensive. Maybe just
for once we could listen to people of
color without any "yes buts" and with
out jumping in to disassociate ourselves
from white society as a whole.

If "some of my best friends are black,"
then try just once to hear what they're
saying and insert yourself into the pic
ture when they talk about white society.
