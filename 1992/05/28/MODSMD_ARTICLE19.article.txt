# Anonymous censorship condemned by artists
## 
### 
I am writing to express my support
for artist Eric Butters and my concern
with the anonymous censorship which
resulted in the removal of a painting
from an exhibit on the Stanford campus.
According to the Daily, complaints
from an anonymous "grad student" in the
"hard sciences" caused administrators to
remove the painting from Butters' exhibit
at the Coffee House a few weeks ago.
My purpose is not to censure the cen

sor nor to judge the validity of her posi
tion, but to decry the principle of
anonymity when it is used to force one
person's opinion onto the society at large.
Surely, this anonymous critic would
rise in alarm and disgust if an anony
mous censor attempted to determine
which scientific text she could see and
which she could not.
Yet she does not hesitate to wield this
blunt instrument to lash out at her
selected target and intended victim just
as others have hid behind the shield of
anonymity in order to oppress others.
Throughout history artists, philoso
phers, scientists and both men and women
have felt the sting of the lash in the hands
of the self-righteous anonymous Philis
tine. Butters is in good company.
Good taste and vulgarity reside in the
mind of the beholder. We petition the
public to resist the efforts of anonymous
Philistines.
