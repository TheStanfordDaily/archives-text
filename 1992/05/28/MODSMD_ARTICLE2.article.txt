# Bookstore's lease on campus called sweetheart deal
## Stanford may be losing millions in rent 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Amid the ongoing scrutiny of
the Stanford Bookstore's business
practices, University officials have
worked to distance the University
from the store and its problems,
emphasizing that the store is an
independent corporation.
But in at least one respect, the
relationship between the two par
ties has been anything but arm's
length.
Over the years, the University
has nurtured the Bookstore with
one of the most generous lease
arrangements in the college store
industry.
The current lease agreement
requires the Bookstore to pay 1
percent of sales on certain items
to rent its main campus site, a
payment that was less than
$40,000 in 1990-91. Industry offi
cials say the right to manage a
bookstore on that site is worth as
much as $3 million per year.
During the last three months,
several senior University admin
istrators have expressed concern

that the lease terms, which run
through the year 2000, are unfa
vorable to the University.
The Daily disclosed in Febru
ary that the Bookstore's senior
management enjoy perquisites
unheard of elsewhere in the col
lege-bookstore industry. Within a
few hours the provost issued a
statement and a University'press
release was issued, emphasizing
that the Bookstore was an "inde
pendent vendor."
But the lease agreement
reflects an ambivalent relation
ship between the Bookstore and
the University, one that Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg, spokesperson
for the Bookstore's board of direc
tors, describes as "legally separate
but psychologically united."
Weisberg added that the Book
store's board may consider volun
tarily offering the University a
more favorable lease agreement
some time in the future.
The Bookstore does pay closer
to commercial rates to operate the
Track House and Tresidder
Express, according to its financial state
ments.
But the low rent on the site of the
main campus store, which provided the
Stanford Bookstore with more than $31
million of its roughly $40 million in sales
last year, has surprised many in the col
lege bookstore industry contacted by
The Daily.
Stanford could receive "several mil
lion dollars" per year for leasing the site,
according to Scott Deaton, vice president
of Follett College Stores, which manages
more than 400 college bookstores.
"It would be my guess that the Uni
versity would receive one of the most
competitive management proposals
available," said Carl RosendorfT, vice
president of Barnes & Noble, another
bookstore management firm.
RosendorfT estimated that Stanford
could receive more than 10 percent of the
bookstore's net sales if the management
contract were awarded competitively.
'Considered a partnership'
The current lease agreement, signed
in 1990, was renegotiated in 1988 from
an earlier contract. At the time of rene
gotiation, only the Bookstore's lease
payment was on the table, according to
Zera Murphy, one of the University rep
resentatives in the negotiation.
Jack Friedenthal, who was president
of the Bookstore's board of directors at
the time, said the discussion "was not an
arm's-length negotiation at all."
Murphy said, "It was always consid
ered a partnership."
According to Murphy, who no longer
works at Stanford, Friedenthal and
Bookstore General Manager Eldon
Speed argued that increasing the Book
store's lease would force the store to
raise prices, which would hurt students.
The University was convinced,
according to Murphy, that the Book
store "could not afford to pay any more"
to the University without passing the
cost on to customers. "It wouldn't have
been possible for them," Murphy said.
But the recent disclosures about the
Bookstore have raised questions about
whether the Bookstore could afford to
be paying more rent.
The Daily reported in February that
the Bookstore provided its senior employ
ees with a host of lavish perquisites,
including luxury automobiles and use of a
vacation home that the store leases from a
consulting firm owned by Bookstore Gen
eral Manager Eldon Speed and Assistant
General Manager Philip Chiaramonte.
The Bookstore also lost $1.8 million

in investments that Weisberg described
as "rather speculative," The Daily
reported in March.
In addition, the Bookstore has given
about $2 million in seed money and
interest-free loans to SBI Affiliates, its
for-profit subsidiary which manages
bookstores at several other schools.

The University argued during the
1988 renegotiation that the Bookstore
should "pay its fair share," according to
Murphy. Prior to the negotiation, the
University was not even recovering
overhead from the Bookstore on expens
es for fire and police protection and
security, Murphy said.
The Bookstore also pays the Athletic
Department 5 percent of gross sales at
the Track House and pays Tresidder
Union 10 percent of gross sales at
Tresidder Express in order to operate
those businesses. The leases on the var
ious locations are negotiated separately.
Rethinking the lease
Weisberg said that though the board is
currently preoccupied with its own
restructuring and the ongoing investiga
tion of the Bookstore by the state attor
ney general, it may "revisit" the lease
agreement voluntarily in the near future.
The board will likely consider "what
should be done with the Bookstore's
income in the long term," Weisberg said.
Among its alternatives will be discount
ing prices at the the store and offering
the University a more favorable lease
arrangement, Weisberg said.
"A reason that some of the problems of
the Bookstore occurred was that the Book
store was making a great deal of money,"
Weisberg said. "A legitimate long-range
question is what should the Bookstore be
doing with its after-expenditure income."
That income is currently held in
reserves and has supported such pro
jects as the store remodeling, according
to Weisberg.
The Bookstore also returns an annual
rebate to its Stanford customers, a prac
tice unusual in the industry but fairly
common among Ivy League universities.

No set formula is used to determine
the rebate's size; instead, the Book
store's management makes a recom
mendation to the board based on the
Bookstore's overall financial picture.
Last year about $300,000 was
returned; previous years' rebates were
as much as $550,000.

Weisberg said the board would consid
er paying the University more rent
among several ways of sharing the Book
store's surplus with the University.
"I think it's quite possible that
increased lease payments would be seen
as a legitimate expenditure by the
board," Weisberg said.
The University itself has not re
opened the lease issue, according to
Michael Hudnall, deputy general coun
sel for business and finance.
"I'm not aware of anything that
would cause the lease agreement to be
questioned by the University," he said.
An generous arrangement
Universities typically draw income
from on-campus bookstores by leasing
such businesses to a contract manager
or by managing them internally as an
auxiliary service.
Contract management companies tend
to pay universities between 8 and 12 per
cent of their net sales, according to Garis
Distelhorst, executive director of the
National Association of College Stores.
University-managed stores generally
yield 4 to 6 percent of net sales as a surplus
to the university, according to Distelhorst,
although variance in this group is larger.
"Some stores make more than 12 (per
cent), others barely break even," he said.
Distelhorst's description was consis
tent with arrangements at several dozen
universities contacted by The Daily. The
informal survey suggested that the
Bookstore pays Stanford less than
either contract-managed or university
managed stores.

the largest contract-managed bookstore,

is guaranteed a minimum of $1.5
million per year by Barnes & Noble,
according to Robert Smith, the uni
versity's vice president for finance.
Sales at the store were approxi
mately $11 million last year.
The contract, which requires
Barnes & Noble to sell items at or
below publisher's and manufac
turer's suggested prices, expires in
10 years but can be cancelled by
the university with 30 days' notice.
It also requires the contractor
to spend $700,000 to remodel the
store and support four full schol
arships and 20 book scholarships
for students, according to Smith.
Institutional management of
stores also tends to be more lucra
tive for universities than is Stan
ford's arrangement.
The university-owned Illini
Union Bookstore, for example,
forwarded its $650,000 surplus to
the University of Illinois last year.
That sum, representing about 5
percent of the store's sales, went
to support student services and
activities, according to Susan
Maul, director of the Illini Union.
A handful of universities earn
little or no revenue from campus
taokstores This group generally
consists of bookstores which are

losing money or are so small as to
yield insignificant revenue, Dis
telhorst said.
As universities face budget
crises, many have looked to on
campus stores to provide income
for academic programs and stu
dent services, Distelhorst said.

'A legitimate ...
question is what
should the Book
store be doing
with its after
expenditure
income.'
— Robert
Weisberg

Contract managers have
grown to meet this demand by
offering lucrative lease arrange
ments. Barnes & Noble, for exam
ple, assumed management of 130
stores in the last five years,
according to Rosendorff.
Such firms have been criticized
by Speed and other bookstore man
agers, who argue that the corpora

tions extract profits that should be
kept within the university and
make decisions about inventory
based on potential profit rather
than service to the community.
At the same time, the Book
store's for-profit subsidiary, SBI
Affiliates, has assumed contract
management arrangements- at
several other schools.
Its bookstore at Menlo School
and College, for example, pays
Menlo between 3 and 5 percent of
net sales, according to Bookstore
financial statements.
Speed did not return phone
calls to his office Tuesday.
Rosendorff argues that con
tractors provide income to univer
sities and routinely agree both to
restrictions on pricing and guide
lines on inventory of academic,
trade and reference books.
Industry officials said that,
because of Stanford's size and aca
demic reputation, it would be
expected to command one of the
industry's most favorable contracts.
"Stanford would be the red
feather," said Distelhorst, who
added that Stanford's academic
reputation and the absence of
local competition would make the
Stanford contract among the
industry's most valuable.

grown to meet this demand by
offering lucrative lease arrange
ments. Barnes & Noble, for exam
ple, assumed management of 130
stores in the last five years,
according to Rosendorff.
Such firms have been criticized
by Speed and other bookstore man
agers, who argue that the corpora

tions extract profits that should be
kept within the university and
make decisions about inventory
based on potential profit rather
than service to the community.
At the same time, the Book
store's for-profit subsidiary, SBI
Affiliates, has assumed contract
management arrangements- at
several other schools.
Its bookstore at Menlo School
and College, for example, pays
Menlo between 3 and 5 percent of
net sales, according to Bookstore
financial statements.
Speed did not return phone
calls to his office Tuesday.
Rosendorff argues that con
tractors provide income to univer
sities and routinely agree both to
restrictions on pricing and guide
lines on inventory of academic,
trade and reference books.
Industry officials said that,
because of Stanford's size and aca
demic reputation, it would be
expected to command one of the
industry's most favorable contracts.
"Stanford would be the red
feather," said Distelhorst, who
added that Stanford's academic
reputation and the absence of
local competition would make the
Stanford contract among the
industry's most valuable.

Brian Bedell — Daily
Customers shop at the Stanford Bookstore yesterday. The University's lease agreement with the Book
store is one of the most generous in the college bookstore industry, according to industry experts.
Amid the ongoing scrutiny of
the Stanford Bookstore's business
practices, University officials have
worked to distance the University
from the store and its problems,
emphasizing that the store is an
independent corporation.
But in at least one respect, the
relationship between the two par
ties has been anything but arm's
length.
Over the years, the University
has nurtured the Bookstore with
one of the most generous lease
arrangements in the college store
industry.
The current lease agreement
requires the Bookstore to pay 1
percent of sales on certain items
to rent its main campus site, a
payment that was less than
$40,000 in 1990-91. Industry offi
cials say the right to manage a
bookstore on that site is worth as
much as $3 million per year.
During the last three months,
several senior University admin
istrators have expressed concern

that the lease terms, which run
through the year 2000, are unfa
vorable to the University.
The Daily disclosed in Febru
ary that the Bookstore's senior
management enjoy perquisites
unheard of elsewhere in the col
lege-bookstore industry. Within a
few hours the provost issued a
statement and a University'press
release was issued, emphasizing
that the Bookstore was an "inde
pendent vendor."
But the lease agreement
reflects an ambivalent relation
ship between the Bookstore and
the University, one that Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg, spokesperson
for the Bookstore's board of direc
tors, describes as "legally separate
but psychologically united."
Weisberg added that the Book
store's board may consider volun
tarily offering the University a
more favorable lease agreement
some time in the future.
The Bookstore does pay closer
to commercial rates to operate the
Track House and Tresidder
Express, according to its financial state
ments.
But the low rent on the site of the
main campus store, which provided the
Stanford Bookstore with more than $31
million of its roughly $40 million in sales
last year, has surprised many in the col
lege bookstore industry contacted by
The Daily.
Stanford could receive "several mil
lion dollars" per year for leasing the site,
according to Scott Deaton, vice president
of Follett College Stores, which manages
more than 400 college bookstores.
"It would be my guess that the Uni
versity would receive one of the most
competitive management proposals
available," said Carl RosendorfT, vice
president of Barnes & Noble, another
bookstore management firm.
RosendorfT estimated that Stanford
could receive more than 10 percent of the
bookstore's net sales if the management
contract were awarded competitively.
'Considered a partnership'
The current lease agreement, signed
in 1990, was renegotiated in 1988 from
an earlier contract. At the time of rene
gotiation, only the Bookstore's lease
payment was on the table, according to
Zera Murphy, one of the University rep
resentatives in the negotiation.
Jack Friedenthal, who was president
of the Bookstore's board of directors at
the time, said the discussion "was not an
arm's-length negotiation at all."
Murphy said, "It was always consid
ered a partnership."
According to Murphy, who no longer
works at Stanford, Friedenthal and
Bookstore General Manager Eldon
Speed argued that increasing the Book
store's lease would force the store to
raise prices, which would hurt students.
The University was convinced,
according to Murphy, that the Book
store "could not afford to pay any more"
to the University without passing the
cost on to customers. "It wouldn't have
been possible for them," Murphy said.
But the recent disclosures about the
Bookstore have raised questions about
whether the Bookstore could afford to
be paying more rent.
The Daily reported in February that
the Bookstore provided its senior employ
ees with a host of lavish perquisites,
including luxury automobiles and use of a
vacation home that the store leases from a
consulting firm owned by Bookstore Gen
eral Manager Eldon Speed and Assistant
General Manager Philip Chiaramonte.
The Bookstore also lost $1.8 million

in investments that Weisberg described
as "rather speculative," The Daily
reported in March.
In addition, the Bookstore has given
about $2 million in seed money and
interest-free loans to SBI Affiliates, its
for-profit subsidiary which manages
bookstores at several other schools.

The University argued during the
1988 renegotiation that the Bookstore
should "pay its fair share," according to
Murphy. Prior to the negotiation, the
University was not even recovering
overhead from the Bookstore on expens
es for fire and police protection and
security, Murphy said.
The Bookstore also pays the Athletic
Department 5 percent of gross sales at
the Track House and pays Tresidder
Union 10 percent of gross sales at
Tresidder Express in order to operate
those businesses. The leases on the var
ious locations are negotiated separately.
Rethinking the lease
Weisberg said that though the board is
currently preoccupied with its own
restructuring and the ongoing investiga
tion of the Bookstore by the state attor
ney general, it may "revisit" the lease
agreement voluntarily in the near future.
The board will likely consider "what
should be done with the Bookstore's
income in the long term," Weisberg said.
Among its alternatives will be discount
ing prices at the the store and offering
the University a more favorable lease
arrangement, Weisberg said.
"A reason that some of the problems of
the Bookstore occurred was that the Book
store was making a great deal of money,"
Weisberg said. "A legitimate long-range
question is what should the Bookstore be
doing with its after-expenditure income."
That income is currently held in
reserves and has supported such pro
jects as the store remodeling, according
to Weisberg.
The Bookstore also returns an annual
rebate to its Stanford customers, a prac
tice unusual in the industry but fairly
common among Ivy League universities.

No set formula is used to determine
the rebate's size; instead, the Book
store's management makes a recom
mendation to the board based on the
Bookstore's overall financial picture.
Last year about $300,000 was
returned; previous years' rebates were
as much as $550,000.

Weisberg said the board would consid
er paying the University more rent
among several ways of sharing the Book
store's surplus with the University.
"I think it's quite possible that
increased lease payments would be seen
as a legitimate expenditure by the
board," Weisberg said.
The University itself has not re
opened the lease issue, according to
Michael Hudnall, deputy general coun
sel for business and finance.
"I'm not aware of anything that
would cause the lease agreement to be
questioned by the University," he said.
An generous arrangement
Universities typically draw income
from on-campus bookstores by leasing
such businesses to a contract manager
or by managing them internally as an
auxiliary service.
Contract management companies tend
to pay universities between 8 and 12 per
cent of their net sales, according to Garis
Distelhorst, executive director of the
National Association of College Stores.
University-managed stores generally
yield 4 to 6 percent of net sales as a surplus
to the university, according to Distelhorst,
although variance in this group is larger.
"Some stores make more than 12 (per
cent), others barely break even," he said.
Distelhorst's description was consis
tent with arrangements at several dozen
universities contacted by The Daily. The
informal survey suggested that the
Bookstore pays Stanford less than
either contract-managed or university
managed stores.
Texas A&M University, the site of
the largest contract-managed bookstore,


'A reason that some of the prob
lems of the Bookstore occurred

is guaranteed a minimum of $1.5
million per year by Barnes & Noble,
according to Robert Smith, the uni
versity's vice president for finance.
Sales at the store were approxi
mately $11 million last year.
The contract, which requires
Barnes & Noble to sell items at or
below publisher's and manufac
turer's suggested prices, expires in
10 years but can be cancelled by
the university with 30 days' notice.
It also requires the contractor
to spend $700,000 to remodel the
store and support four full schol
arships and 20 book scholarships
for students, according to Smith.
Institutional management of
stores also tends to be more lucra
tive for universities than is Stan
ford's arrangement.
The university-owned Illini
Union Bookstore, for example,
forwarded its $650,000 surplus to
the University of Illinois last year.
That sum, representing about 5
percent of the store's sales, went
to support student services and
activities, according to Susan
Maul, director of the Illini Union.
A handful of universities earn
little or no revenue from campus
taokstores This group generally
consists of bookstores which are

losing money or are so small as to
yield insignificant revenue, Dis
telhorst said.
As universities face budget
crises, many have looked to on
campus stores to provide income
for academic programs and stu
dent services, Distelhorst said.

versity's vice president for finance.
Sales at the store were approxi
mately $11 million last year.
The contract, which requires
Barnes & Noble to sell items at or
below publisher's and manufac
turer's suggested prices, expires in
10 years but can be cancelled by
the university with 30 days' notice.
It also requires the contractor
to spend $700,000 to remodel the
store and support four full schol
arships and 20 book scholarships
for students, according to Smith.
Institutional management of
stores also tends to be more lucra
tive for universities than is Stan
ford's arrangement.
The university-owned Illini
Union Bookstore, for example,
forwarded its $650,000 surplus to
the University of Illinois last year.
That sum, representing about 5
percent of the store's sales, went
to support student services and
activities, according to Susan
Maul, director of the Illini Union.

Contract managers have
grown to meet this demand by
offering lucrative lease arrange
ments. Barnes & Noble, for exam
ple, assumed management of 130
stores in the last five years,
according to Rosendorff.
Such firms have been criticized
by Speed and other bookstore man
agers, who argue that the corpora

tions extract profits that should be
kept within the university and
make decisions about inventory
based on potential profit rather
than service to the community.
At the same time, the Book
store's for-profit subsidiary, SBI
Affiliates, has assumed contract
management arrangements- at
several other schools.
Its bookstore at Menlo School
and College, for example, pays
Menlo between 3 and 5 percent of
net sales, according to Bookstore
financial statements.
Speed did not return phone
calls to his office Tuesday.
Rosendorff argues that con
tractors provide income to univer
sities and routinely agree both to
restrictions on pricing and guide
lines on inventory of academic,
trade and reference books.
Industry officials said that,
because of Stanford's size and aca
demic reputation, it would be
expected to command one of the
industry's most favorable contracts.
"Stanford would be the red
feather," said Distelhorst, who
added that Stanford's academic
reputation and the absence of
local competition would make the
Stanford contract among the
industry's most valuable.

Brian Bedell — Daily
Customers shop at the Stanford Bookstore yesterday. The University's lease agreement with the Book
store is one of the most generous in the college bookstore industry, according to industry experts.
Amid the ongoing scrutiny of
the Stanford Bookstore's business
practices, University officials have
worked to distance the University
from the store and its problems,
emphasizing that the store is an
independent corporation.
But in at least one respect, the
relationship between the two par
ties has been anything but arm's
length.
Over the years, the University
has nurtured the Bookstore with
one of the most generous lease
arrangements in the college store
industry.
The current lease agreement
requires the Bookstore to pay 1
percent of sales on certain items
to rent its main campus site, a
payment that was less than
$40,000 in 1990-91. Industry offi
cials say the right to manage a
bookstore on that site is worth as
much as $3 million per year.
During the last three months,
several senior University admin
istrators have expressed concern

that the lease terms, which run
through the year 2000, are unfa
vorable to the University.
The Daily disclosed in Febru
ary that the Bookstore's senior
management enjoy perquisites
unheard of elsewhere in the col
lege-bookstore industry. Within a
few hours the provost issued a
statement and a University'press
release was issued, emphasizing
that the Bookstore was an "inde
pendent vendor."
But the lease agreement
reflects an ambivalent relation
ship between the Bookstore and
the University, one that Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg, spokesperson
for the Bookstore's board of direc
tors, describes as "legally separate
but psychologically united."
Weisberg added that the Book
store's board may consider volun
tarily offering the University a
more favorable lease agreement
some time in the future.
The Bookstore does pay closer
to commercial rates to operate the
Track House and Tresidder
Express, according to its financial state
ments.
But the low rent on the site of the
main campus store, which provided the
Stanford Bookstore with more than $31
million of its roughly $40 million in sales
last year, has surprised many in the col
lege bookstore industry contacted by
The Daily.
Stanford could receive "several mil
lion dollars" per year for leasing the site,
according to Scott Deaton, vice president
of Follett College Stores, which manages
more than 400 college bookstores.
"It would be my guess that the Uni
versity would receive one of the most
competitive management proposals
available," said Carl RosendorfT, vice
president of Barnes & Noble, another
bookstore management firm.
RosendorfT estimated that Stanford
could receive more than 10 percent of the
bookstore's net sales if the management
contract were awarded competitively.
'Considered a partnership'
The current lease agreement, signed
in 1990, was renegotiated in 1988 from
an earlier contract. At the time of rene
gotiation, only the Bookstore's lease
payment was on the table, according to
Zera Murphy, one of the University rep
resentatives in the negotiation.
Jack Friedenthal, who was president
of the Bookstore's board of directors at
the time, said the discussion "was not an
arm's-length negotiation at all."
Murphy said, "It was always consid
ered a partnership."
According to Murphy, who no longer
works at Stanford, Friedenthal and
Bookstore General Manager Eldon
Speed argued that increasing the Book
store's lease would force the store to
raise prices, which would hurt students.
The University was convinced,
according to Murphy, that the Book
store "could not afford to pay any more"
to the University without passing the
cost on to customers. "It wouldn't have
been possible for them," Murphy said.
But the recent disclosures about the
Bookstore have raised questions about
whether the Bookstore could afford to
be paying more rent.
The Daily reported in February that
the Bookstore provided its senior employ
ees with a host of lavish perquisites,
including luxury automobiles and use of a
vacation home that the store leases from a
consulting firm owned by Bookstore Gen
eral Manager Eldon Speed and Assistant
General Manager Philip Chiaramonte.
The Bookstore also lost $1.8 million

in investments that Weisberg described
as "rather speculative," The Daily
reported in March.
In addition, the Bookstore has given
about $2 million in seed money and
interest-free loans to SBI Affiliates, its
for-profit subsidiary which manages
bookstores at several other schools.

The University argued during the
1988 renegotiation that the Bookstore
should "pay its fair share," according to
Murphy. Prior to the negotiation, the
University was not even recovering
overhead from the Bookstore on expens
es for fire and police protection and
security, Murphy said.
The Bookstore also pays the Athletic
Department 5 percent of gross sales at
the Track House and pays Tresidder
Union 10 percent of gross sales at
Tresidder Express in order to operate
those businesses. The leases on the var
ious locations are negotiated separately.
Rethinking the lease
Weisberg said that though the board is
currently preoccupied with its own
restructuring and the ongoing investiga
tion of the Bookstore by the state attor
ney general, it may "revisit" the lease
agreement voluntarily in the near future.
The board will likely consider "what
should be done with the Bookstore's
income in the long term," Weisberg said.
Among its alternatives will be discount
ing prices at the the store and offering
the University a more favorable lease
arrangement, Weisberg said.
"A reason that some of the problems of
the Bookstore occurred was that the Book
store was making a great deal of money,"
Weisberg said. "A legitimate long-range
question is what should the Bookstore be
doing with its after-expenditure income."
That income is currently held in
reserves and has supported such pro
jects as the store remodeling, according
to Weisberg.
The Bookstore also returns an annual
rebate to its Stanford customers, a prac
tice unusual in the industry but fairly
common among Ivy League universities.

No set formula is used to determine
the rebate's size; instead, the Book
store's management makes a recom
mendation to the board based on the
Bookstore's overall financial picture.
Last year about $300,000 was
returned; previous years' rebates were
as much as $550,000.

Weisberg said the board would consid
er paying the University more rent
among several ways of sharing the Book
store's surplus with the University.
"I think it's quite possible that
increased lease payments would be seen
as a legitimate expenditure by the
board," Weisberg said.
The University itself has not re
opened the lease issue, according to
Michael Hudnall, deputy general coun
sel for business and finance.
"I'm not aware of anything that
would cause the lease agreement to be
questioned by the University," he said.
An generous arrangement
Universities typically draw income
from on-campus bookstores by leasing
such businesses to a contract manager
or by managing them internally as an
auxiliary service.
Contract management companies tend
to pay universities between 8 and 12 per
cent of their net sales, according to Garis
Distelhorst, executive director of the
National Association of College Stores.
University-managed stores generally
yield 4 to 6 percent of net sales as a surplus
to the university, according to Distelhorst,
although variance in this group is larger.
"Some stores make more than 12 (per
cent), others barely break even," he said.
Distelhorst's description was consis
tent with arrangements at several dozen
universities contacted by The Daily. The
informal survey suggested that the
Bookstore pays Stanford less than
either contract-managed or university
managed stores.
