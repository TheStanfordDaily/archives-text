# Bookstore's lease on campus called sweetheart deal
## Stanford may be losing millions in rent 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Amid the ongoing scrutiny of
the Stanford Bookstore's business
practices, University officials have
worked to distance the University
from the store and its problems,
emphasizing that the store is an
independent corporation.
But in at least one respect, the
relationship between the two par
ties has been anything but arm's
length.
Over the years, the University
has nurtured the Bookstore with
one of the most generous lease
arrangements in the college store
industry.
The current lease agreement
requires the Bookstore to pay 1
percent of sales on certain items
to rent its main campus site, a
payment that was less than
$40,000 in 1990-91. Industry offi
cials say the right to manage a
bookstore on that site is worth as
much as $3 million per year.
During the last three months,
several senior University admin
istrators have expressed concern

that the lease terms, which run
through the year 2000, are unfa
vorable to the University.
The Daily disclosed in Febru
ary that the Bookstore's senior
management enjoy perquisites
unheard of elsewhere in the col
lege-bookstore industry. Within a
few hours the provost issued a
statement and a University'press
release was issued, emphasizing
that the Bookstore was an "inde
pendent vendor."
But the lease agreement
reflects an ambivalent relation
ship between the Bookstore and
the University, one that Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg, spokesperson
for the Bookstore's board of direc
tors, describes as "legally separate
but psychologically united."
Weisberg added that the Book
store's board may consider volun
tarily offering the University a
more favorable lease agreement
some time in the future.
The Bookstore does pay closer
to commercial rates to operate the
