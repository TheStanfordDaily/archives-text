# THE
						IMPACT OF INDIRECT COSTS
## 
### 
Stanford's plunging indirect-cost rate roughly
translates into a loss of more than $25 million per
year and was the major factor for this past year's
$43-million deficit-reduction process.
The resulting budget cuts have hurt many
parts of the University, particularly the humanities
and the arts. This year has seen dramatic cuts In
drama and music and the eventual closure of the
overseas campus in Salamanca.
To meet with new federal cost regulations, the
University is also spending more than $10 million to
upgrade Internal accounting systems and complete a
variety of audits.
