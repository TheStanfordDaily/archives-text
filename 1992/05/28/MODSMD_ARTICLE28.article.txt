## Going to greener pastures Keefe almost certain to be an NBA lottery pick 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
In the next month, Adam Keefe will be able to
affirm that the grass is really greener on the other
side of the fence. Well, if not the grass, at least his
wallet.
Keefe has an exciting few weeks ahead of him. On
June 14, he will graduate from Stanford with a
Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. Two
weeks later, he is almost certain to be a high first
round pick in the National Basketball Association
draft.

'Staying for his senior year was
the best thing he ever did, fin
ishing his degree.. .in 20/20
hindsight, it was the best deci
sion he ever made.'
— Mike Montgomery

Unlike some of his fellow classmates, Keefe is
assured of employment after graduation with a high
starting salary, and he knows what type of job he
will get. The mystery that still remains, though, is
who will be his employer.
The 6-foot-9 Irvine native could go as high as the
No. 4 selection in the draft, but most are projecting
him in the range of the seventh through 10th picks.
"He'll be a lottery pick," Stanford basketball
coach Mike Montgomery said. "The question is
where he will go. The best guess is No. 5, 6 or 7, to
Denver, Washington or Sacramento."
The No. 7 pick, which is held by the Sacramento
Kings, is a very strong possibility for Keefe, who
could be tabbed to play two hours west of the Farm
in Arco Arena.
"Sacramento would be a great place to play,"

Keefe said. "It's an hour and a half drive to Stanford,
a one-hour plane ride from home and it's in the
Pacific Division. That would be unbelievable."
Aside from LSU center Shaquille O'Neal, who by
consensus will be the first player taken, Keefe was
the only other player to rank in the top 25 in both
scoring and rebounding in the NCAA this season.
Keefe averaged 25.3 points per game (first in the
Pacific-10 Conference, 11th nationally) and 12.2
rebounds per game (first in the Pac-10, fourth
nationally). Keefe leaves Stanford with both a diplo
ma and 17 school records.
Another possibility is that the Golden State War
riors, who have the No. 24 pick, could trade up so
that coach Don Nelson, a longtime admirer of Keefe,
could snare the big redhead.
"If I had a dream choice, I'd love to play for the
Golden State Warriors, the Boston Celtics or the Los
Angeles Lakers, but I'm very excited about going
anywhere," Keefe said.
After four years of college play, Keefe is ready for
the challenge that the next level will bring.
"I've spent a lot of time playing against good play
ers," he said. "You don't go out in fear of them, but
you recognize that they are good players and give
them respect for that.
"There will be an adjustment period, but this is
something I have been looking forward to."
With such a promising future ahead of him, Keefe
has barely had time to reflect upon his years on the
Farm.
"Unfortunately, this is such an exciting time that
I haven't had the chance to be nostalgic," Keefe said.
"I feel so fortunate to have come here and that I
decided to stay (for his senior year rather than enter
the draft early). I've had a lot of fun here. I've made
a string of decisions that were right for me, and
that's a great feeling."
"Staying for his senior year was the best thing he
ever did," Montgomery said. "Never looking back,
finishing his degree, taking charge of a team that
was his responsibility. . .plus, he moved his draft
spot up 10 spaces. Looking back in 20/20 hindsight,

it was the best decision he ever made."
One question still to be settled for a young man
with seemingly all the right cards in his hand is who
will represent him in the upcoming negotiations
with the team that selects him.
"My parents have played a big part in helping me
choose an agent," Keefe commented. "I'm looking
for someone who is honest and who has a great track

record with his players."
Despite the fact that he will soon be a multimil
lionaire, he still maintains a sense of perspective.
"I have no reservations about what team and
what city I will play for," Keefe said. "I'm just ecstat
ic to play with that caliber of players. To me, its been
a lifelong dream."
For Adam Keefe, that dream will come true.

I haven't had the chance to be nostalgic," Keefe said.
"I feel so fortunate to have come here and that I
decided to stay (for his senior year rather than enter
the draft early). I've had a lot of fun here. I've made
a string of decisions that were right for me, and
that's a great feeling."
"Staying for his senior year was the best thing he
ever did," Montgomery said. "Never looking back,
finishing his degree, taking charge of a team that
was his responsibility. . .plus, he moved his draft
spot up 10 spaces. Looking back in 20/20 hindsight,

it was the best decision he ever made."
One question still to be settled for a young man
with seemingly all the right cards in his hand is who
will represent him in the upcoming negotiations
with the team that selects him.
"My parents have played a big part in helping me
choose an agent," Keefe commented. "I'm looking
for someone who is honest and who has a great track

record with his players."
Despite the fact that he will soon be a multimil
lionaire, he still maintains a sense of perspective.
"I have no reservations about what team and
what city I will play for," Keefe said. "I'm just ecstat
ic to play with that caliber of players. To me, its been
a lifelong dream."
For Adam Keefe, that dream will come true.

In the next month, Adam Keefe will be able to
affirm that the grass is really greener on the other
side of the fence. Well, if not the grass, at least his
wallet.
Keefe has an exciting few weeks ahead of him. On
June 14, he will graduate from Stanford with a
Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. Two
weeks later, he is almost certain to be a high first
round pick in the National Basketball Association
draft.

Unlike some of his fellow classmates, Keefe is
assured of employment after graduation with a high
starting salary, and he knows what type of job he
will get. The mystery that still remains, though, is
who will be his employer.
The 6-foot-9 Irvine native could go as high as the
No. 4 selection in the draft, but most are projecting
him in the range of the seventh through 10th picks.
"He'll be a lottery pick," Stanford basketball
coach Mike Montgomery said. "The question is
where he will go. The best guess is No. 5, 6 or 7, to
Denver, Washington or Sacramento."
The No. 7 pick, which is held by the Sacramento
Kings, is a very strong possibility for Keefe, who
could be tabbed to play two hours west of the Farm
in Arco Arena.
"Sacramento would be a great place to play,"

Keefe said. "It's an hour and a half drive to Stanford,
a one-hour plane ride from home and it's in the
Pacific Division. That would be unbelievable."
Aside from LSU center Shaquille O'Neal, who by
consensus will be the first player taken, Keefe was
the only other player to rank in the top 25 in both
scoring and rebounding in the NCAA this season.
Keefe averaged 25.3 points per game (first in the
Pacific-10 Conference, 11th nationally) and 12.2
rebounds per game (first in the Pac-10, fourth
nationally). Keefe leaves Stanford with both a diplo
ma and 17 school records.
Another possibility is that the Golden State War
riors, who have the No. 24 pick, could trade up so
that coach Don Nelson, a longtime admirer of Keefe,
could snare the big redhead.
"If I had a dream choice, I'd love to play for the
Golden State Warriors, the Boston Celtics or the Los
Angeles Lakers, but I'm very excited about going
anywhere," Keefe said.
After four years of college play, Keefe is ready for
the challenge that the next level will bring.
"I've spent a lot of time playing against good play
ers," he said. "You don't go out in fear of them, but
you recognize that they are good players and give
them respect for that.
"There will be an adjustment period, but this is
something I have been looking forward to."
With such a promising future ahead of him, Keefe
has barely had time to reflect upon his years on the
Farm.
"Unfortunately, this is such an exciting time that
I haven't had the chance to be nostalgic," Keefe said.
"I feel so fortunate to have come here and that I
decided to stay (for his senior year rather than enter
the draft early). I've had a lot of fun here. I've made
a string of decisions that were right for me, and
that's a great feeling."
