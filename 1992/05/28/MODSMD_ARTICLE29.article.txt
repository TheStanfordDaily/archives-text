# Edwards sleeps on long jump success
## 
### Nick Clements Staff writer 
With the NCAA Track and
Field Championships approach
ing next week at the University of
Texas in Austin, Jackie Edwards
is going to be a very difficult
woman to beat. She's so good, in
fact, that she can literally beat her
opponents in her sleep.
The Stanford senior is coming
off a strong first place showing in
the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships in the long jump. She
also placed second in the triple
jump with a personal-best 43 feet,
4 and 1/4 inches narrowly losing
to UCLA's Roshanda Glenn.
Edwards will be competing for
her native Bahamas in this year's
Summer Olympics in the long
jump, an event in which she com
peted in the 1988 Olympics and
where she placed 10th at last
year's world championships in
Tokyo. Edwards, understandably,
has high expectations for
Barcelona.
"If I don't make the finals, I'll
probably be upset, seeing as how I
made them last year," she said.
Coming out of high school,
Edwards long jumped 20 feet, 7
inches. Her first two years, she
says, were somewhat of a disap
pointment. Her best leap her
freshman year was 20 feet, 1 inch,
and her best jump her sophomore
year was 20 feet, 5 inches.
Last year, though, Edwards
came of age.
"Last year I got my weight
down and I wasn't injured, and it
just clicked," she said. Edwards
won the Pac-10 Championships
and went on to place in the long
jump at the NCAA Champi
onships.
This year, Edwards has been
equally as spectacular. In mid-
March, she and sprinter Chryste
Gaines traveled to Indianapolis to
the NCAA Indoor Champi
onships, the only Stanford repre

sentatives for the women's team.
Edwards won the long-jump and
took third in the triple jump, and
Gaines won the 55 meter dash, as
the two single-handedly gave the
Stanford women a second place
finish.
Even more amazingly,
Edwards was competing on only
two hour's sleep the night before
because she was studying for
finals.
"The two days before nationals
were really hectic," said Edwards,
a psychology major. She actually
fell asleep during the preliminary

competition in the long jump, and
had to be woken up to compete in
the next round.
Stanford head coach Brooks
Johnson said in comparing the
soft-spoken Edwards to the more
outgoing Gaines, "Externally
they're quite different, but when
you peel back that veneer, they're
soul-mates. . .they're both very
aggressive and very ballistic."
After graduating, Edwards
plans on taking a year off before
going to graduate school in order
to compete in Europe on the
international circuit. Right now,

though, Edwards is mostly
focused on amateur competition.
"As soon as I'm done with
nationals, I'm going to try to get
more aware of the process," she
said.
Edwards, who also runs the
100 and 200 meters for Stanford
in addition to the 400 meter relay,
says she is more a long jumper
than a triple jumper. She called
her third place finish at the
Indoor Championships "a sur
prise."
Now if she can only stay awake
this time. .. .
