# Chair of Nom Com quits over charges
## ASSU rejects committee's appointees 
### Linda Friedlieb Andy Dworkin Staff writers 
The chair of the Nominations
Commission resigned at the
ASSU Senate meeting Tuesday
amid accusations that the process
of appointing students to univer
sity committees was being han
dled unfairly.
Following junior Elson Liu's
resignation, the senate rejected
all but two of more than 50 stu
dent appointees to university
committees that the commission
had recommended.
Junior Gregg Kasten, a mem
ber of the nominations commis
sion, said it might be well into the
middle of fall quarter before stu
dents are placed on some commit

tees — which may damage stu
dents' ability to influence those
committees' decisions.
Student representatives are
appointed to various university
committees each year. The com
mittees advise administrators on
policies such as financial aid and
housing.
Liu said in his resignation
speech that the accusations of
unfairness were politically moti
vated. When he took the position
as chair of the commission earlier
this month, he said in his speech,
he "naively believed that it was
not a political position. I was
wrong, I apologize and I resign."
The debate over the commis
sion's nominees was prompted by
a letter written by former gradu
ate senator Doug Bone to Senate
Chair Ron Brown.
The letter accuses the commis
sion of violating several ASSU
bylaws and running the nomina
tions process unfairly.
Bone is one of the students
turned down for a committee
position.
David Bradfute, a graduate
student who served on a Universi
ty committee last year, delivered a
speech at the meeting accusing
the commission of discriminating
against graduate student appli
cants.
Bradfute said he pointed out
that there were "a whole lot more
undergraduates than graduates"
nominated and that several grad
uate students who he considered
qualified were not given slots.
"There is a gross inequity here,"
Bradfute said in an interview.
He added that the commission
rejected candidates "infinitely
more qualified" than the students
selected by the commission.
Bradfute cited as examples
Bone and graduate student John
Overdeck, a member of this year's

Council of Presidents. Both of
them were rejected in favor of
freshmen candidates. In his resig
nation before the senate, Liu
responded to the accusations.
"In spite of what we felt were
clear decisions, we have been
accused 0f... political manipulation
of the process because we turned
away supremely qualified candi
dates such as Mr. Bone," he said.
"In short, we have taken, for
our efforts, nothing but crap from
the senate," Liu said.
Liu said in an interview that
the committee had been rushed in
its selections because it began the
process in late spring quarter
instead of early winter quarter.
The senate had been unable to
find anyone else to fill the posi
tion of commission chair prior to
spring quarter.
"I, having accepted the posi
tion late as a favor to the senate,
was denied three full months to
organize, plan and publicize," he
said at the meeting Tuesday.
Sophomore David Raymond, a
member of the commission,
defended the body's proposals.
The selection process was
"more complete than it has been
in several years," he said in an
interview. "In previous years they
did not even conduct interviews.
"I felt there were a lot of cir

cuinstances that were blown out
of proportion and blew up at the
meeting. I think that overshad
owed the quality of the selections
made," Raymond said.
The senate did approve two stu
dents' nominations to the Provost's
Committee on Budget Implementa
tion, a committee that will meet for
the first time over the summer.
That committee's nomination
went through because student
input on that committee was con
sidered "critical" and the commit
tee will meet over the summer,
according to graduate senator
Robert Lodenkamper.
However, Bone said in an
interview that he was willing to
remove himself from considera
tion after criticizing Liu.
He added that he thought the
rejection of the nominees would
not hurt student representation.
"We already have a pool of appli
cants, so I don't think that it will
cause unnecessary delay," he said.
"Many of the committees don't
meet during the summer, and even
if they did, the students would
probably not be able to attend."
Graduate student Neil Crellin,
former deputy chair of the senate,
said the nomination procedure for
next year is being reworked by
Senior Enda Hu, the administra
tive manager of the ASSU.

ASSU Senate meeting Tuesday
amid accusations that the process
of appointing students to univer
sity committees was being han
dled unfairly.
Following junior Elson Liu's
resignation, the senate rejected
all but two of more than 50 stu
dent appointees to university
committees that the commission
had recommended.
Junior Gregg Kasten, a mem
ber of the nominations commis
sion, said it might be well into the
middle of fall quarter before stu
dents are placed on some commit

tees — which may damage stu
dents' ability to influence those
committees' decisions.
Student representatives are
appointed to various university
committees each year. The com
mittees advise administrators on
policies such as financial aid and
housing.
Liu said in his resignation
speech that the accusations of
unfairness were politically moti
vated. When he took the position
as chair of the commission earlier
this month, he said in his speech,
he "naively believed that it was
not a political position. I was
wrong, I apologize and I resign."
The debate over the commis
sion's nominees was prompted by
a letter written by former gradu
ate senator Doug Bone to Senate
Chair Ron Brown.
The letter accuses the commis
sion of violating several ASSU
bylaws and running the nomina
tions process unfairly.
Bone is one of the students
turned down for a committee
position.
David Bradfute, a graduate
student who served on a Universi
ty committee last year, delivered a
speech at the meeting accusing
the commission of discriminating
against graduate student appli
cants.
Bradfute said he pointed out
that there were "a whole lot more
undergraduates than graduates"
nominated and that several grad
uate students who he considered
qualified were not given slots.
"There is a gross inequity here,"
Bradfute said in an interview.
He added that the commission
rejected candidates "infinitely
more qualified" than the students
selected by the commission.
Bradfute cited as examples
Bone and graduate student John
Overdeck, a member of this year's

Council of Presidents. Both of
them were rejected in favor of
freshmen candidates. In his resig
nation before the senate, Liu
responded to the accusations.
"In spite of what we felt were
clear decisions, we have been
accused 0f... political manipulation
of the process because we turned
away supremely qualified candi
dates such as Mr. Bone," he said.
"In short, we have taken, for
our efforts, nothing but crap from
the senate," Liu said.
Liu said in an interview that
the committee had been rushed in
its selections because it began the
process in late spring quarter
instead of early winter quarter.
The senate had been unable to
find anyone else to fill the posi
tion of commission chair prior to
spring quarter.
"I, having accepted the posi
tion late as a favor to the senate,
was denied three full months to
organize, plan and publicize," he
said at the meeting Tuesday.
Sophomore David Raymond, a
member of the commission,
defended the body's proposals.
The selection process was
"more complete than it has been
in several years," he said in an
interview. "In previous years they
did not even conduct interviews.
"I felt there were a lot of cir

cuinstances that were blown out
of proportion and blew up at the
meeting. I think that overshad
owed the quality of the selections
made," Raymond said.
The senate did approve two stu
dents' nominations to the Provost's
Committee on Budget Implementa
tion, a committee that will meet for
the first time over the summer.
That committee's nomination
went through because student
input on that committee was con
sidered "critical" and the commit
tee will meet over the summer,
according to graduate senator
Robert Lodenkamper.
However, Bone said in an
interview that he was willing to
remove himself from considera
tion after criticizing Liu.
He added that he thought the
rejection of the nominees would
not hurt student representation.
"We already have a pool of appli
cants, so I don't think that it will
cause unnecessary delay," he said.
"Many of the committees don't
meet during the summer, and even
if they did, the students would
probably not be able to attend."
Graduate student Neil Crellin,
former deputy chair of the senate,
said the nomination procedure for
next year is being reworked by
Senior Enda Hu, the administra
tive manager of the ASSU.
