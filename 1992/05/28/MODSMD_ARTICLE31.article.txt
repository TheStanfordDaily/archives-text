# CWS begins today; Where is Six-Pac?
## Cal lone conference squad to advance 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Well, it looks like the NCAA
Selection Committee was very
wrong.
The committee chose only one
regional in the West, that being in
Tucson. Their thinking, reported
ly, was that the talent in college
baseball lay in the South and
East, and therefore it should be
represented justly. But of the
eight teams entering the College
World Series this Friday in
Omaha, Nebraska, three of the
teams represent California alone
â€” Cal-State Fullerton, Pepper
dine and the University of Cali
fornia.
Cal will be the only Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division
team in the CWS, and there are
no Southeastern Conference
teams in the tournament, despite
the fact that each conference sent
five teams to the regionals.
The other five entrants in the
eight-team tournament in Omaha
are Texas, Wichita State, Florida

State, Oklahoma and no. 1-
ranked Miami, who will play
eighth-seeded California in their
first game. The seedings of the
Waves at No. 7 and the Fullerton
Titans fourth perhaps further
attests to NCAA bias against the
West.
Card Notes
Junior center fielder Jeffrey Ham
monds was named first team All-
American by Collegiate Baseball. In
addition, four members of the 1992
Cardinal were named to the Six-Pac
First Team. Hammonds, second base
man Chris Kemper, right fielder
Steve Solomon and pitcher Willie
Adams made the squad, while left
fielder Dave Cornell, reliever Aaron
Dorlarque, pitcher Rick Helling and
catcher Mark Skeels were all given
honorable mention. Lloyd Peever of
Louisiana State was named national
player of the year, while Cal's Troy
Penix and John Zuber were named
Six-Pac co-players of the year. Penix
also garnered First Team All-Ameri
can honors.
