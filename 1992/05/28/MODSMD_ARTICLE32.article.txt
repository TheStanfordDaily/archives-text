# Cardinal Athletics, 1991-92: The numbers tell the real story
## 
### 
It's true. I've done the research, and it
all seems pretty obvious to me. Yes,
Stanford has had the greatest year in
collegiate sports history. I've got the
numbers to prove it.
9 — Games out of its last 10 that the
Stanford baseball team won, ending the
regular season on a high note.
5 — National titles, of course, tying
the record for most team titles in one
year.
4 — Teams that almost won it, too
women's and men's volleyball, women's
tennis and baseball.
55 — Kills by Dave Goss against
UCLA, setting a new NCAA record for
most kills in a single match.
59.025 — Points out of a possible 60
by men's gymnast Jair Lynch at NCAAs.
It is believed to be the highest point total
ever recorded in the history of collegiate
gymnastics.
4 — Pages in Sports Illustrated on
Tommy Vardell. No one else got that kind
of publicity before the draft.

28 — Games in a row won by the Stan
ford women's volleyball team. It was the
longest streak in the team's history.
1 — Graduating senior on the 1992
national champion Stanford women's
basketball team. Look for a repeat in *93.
0 — Losses this year for fencer Nick
Bravin. 'Nuff said.
8 — Bob Whitfield's NFL draft number.
Chosen by the Atlanta Falcons, he was the
first offensive lineman taken this year.
9 — Tommy Vardell's NFL draft num
ber. He was the first running back chosen
and will go to the Cleveland Browns.
22 — Runs Stanford scored against

Cal in the Cardinal's last conference
home baseball game.
2 — Men's gymnasts in the top seven
in the country. Jair Lynch and Tim Ryan
will both likely be on the 1992 U.S.
Olympic team
4 — Stanford swimmers going to
Barcelona — and probably four golds
coming back to Palo Alto.
40 — Nights each at The Daily this
volume for Brian and me.
10 — Stanford women's gymnastics
team's finish at NCAAs. Not bad for the
squad's first postseason trip.
3 — Titles won by Alex O'Brien this
year. He won The Triple (team, singles
and doubles championships) — the first
man to do it since 1974.
1 — Member of the women's soccer team
on the U.S. National team — Julie Foudy.
31 — Games won by the men's ultimate
team before being upset at Regionals.
276 — Christian Cevaer's score at Pac
10s. He won the individual title for the
second time in his Stanford career.

12 — Newspapers that rejected my job
application before I finally got hired by
the San Jose Mercury News.
38 — Points scored against Cal in Big
Game.
21 — Pointed scored by Cal against us
in Big Game.
10 — Offers that Cal wide receiver
Brian Treggs received for housing next
year after boasting that he wouldn't leave
Palo Alto without the Axe.
2-to-l — Odds of Jeff Hammonds
being the No.l pick in this year's baseball
draft.
4 — Stanford women's golf team's
seeding heading into NCAAs this week.
54.48 — Jenny Thompson's world
record time in the 100 meter freestyle.
7 (am) — Hour that the men's golf team
got up five days a week all year to practice.
Beyond counting — My memories of
this year in Stanford athletics.
1,909 — Career kills by 1991 ASICs
Player of the Year Kristin Klein. She is
now the NCAA career kill leader.

5 — Consecutive postseason appear
ances for basketball coach Mike Mont
gomery.
50 — Ways to leave your lover. (See
Chris "Thank God for" Harris for details.)
3 — Super Bowl wins by new head
football coach Bill Walsh.
850,000 — Dollars that Walsh is
receiving in salary next year.
1439 — Stanford's men's golf team's
72-hole score at Pac-lOs. Top-ranked Ari
zona came in second, 19 shots back.
11 — The latest that Adam Keefe will
go in the NBA Draft. He had a lottery-cal
iber year, and he will get his reward come
June 26.
1 — Night left at the Daily for me. But
who's counting?

George is a graduating senior and co
sports editor of The Daily. He wants to
thank everyone for a good year, but espe
cially the women's volleyball team for all
the great times last fall. Thanks for the
memories.

It's true. I've done the research, and it
all seems pretty obvious to me. Yes,
Stanford has had the greatest year in
collegiate sports history. I've got the
numbers to prove it.
9 — Games out of its last 10 that the
Stanford baseball team won, ending the
regular season on a high note.
5 — National titles, of course, tying
the record for most team titles in one
year.
4 — Teams that almost won it, too
women's and men's volleyball, women's
tennis and baseball.
55 — Kills by Dave Goss against
UCLA, setting a new NCAA record for
most kills in a single match.
59.025 — Points out of a possible 60
by men's gymnast Jair Lynch at NCAAs.
It is believed to be the highest point total
ever recorded in the history of collegiate
gymnastics.
4 — Pages in Sports Illustrated on
Tommy Vardell. No one else got that kind
of publicity before the draft.

28 — Games in a row won by the Stan
ford women's volleyball team. It was the
longest streak in the team's history.
1 — Graduating senior on the 1992
national champion Stanford women's
basketball team. Look for a repeat in *93.
0 — Losses this year for fencer Nick
Bravin. 'Nuff said.
8 — Bob Whitfield's NFL draft number.
Chosen by the Atlanta Falcons, he was the
first offensive lineman taken this year.
9 — Tommy Vardell's NFL draft num
ber. He was the first running back chosen
and will go to the Cleveland Browns.
22 — Runs Stanford scored against

Cal in the Cardinal's last conference
home baseball game.
2 — Men's gymnasts in the top seven
in the country. Jair Lynch and Tim Ryan
will both likely be on the 1992 U.S.
Olympic team
4 — Stanford swimmers going to
Barcelona — and probably four golds
coming back to Palo Alto.
40 — Nights each at The Daily this
volume for Brian and me.
10 — Stanford women's gymnastics
team's finish at NCAAs. Not bad for the
squad's first postseason trip.
3 — Titles won by Alex O'Brien this
year. He won The Triple (team, singles
and doubles championships) — the first
man to do it since 1974.
1 — Member of the women's soccer team
on the U.S. National team — Julie Foudy.
31 — Games won by the men's ultimate
team before being upset at Regionals.
