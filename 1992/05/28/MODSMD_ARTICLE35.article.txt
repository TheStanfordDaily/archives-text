## Clinton, Bush supporters clash over presidential possibilities 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
Bringing the presidential race
to Stanford, advocates for Presi
dent Bush and Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton faced off over issues rang
ing from education to the econo
my in a heated but friendly debate
last night.
Four speakers and an audience
of 11 students also discussed
political leadership, abortion and
women's issues at the event.
David Barram, a member of
the local Clinton campaign steer
ing committee and vice president
of Apple Computers, represented
the Clinton campaign. San Fran
cisco lawyer William Seavey rep
resented the Republican side.
In his opening remarks, Seavey
said Bush has shown leadership
in the international arena and
dealt successfully with a rapidly
changing world. "My thesis would
be that we're not out of the woods

yet" and that Bush's experience is
still needed, he said.
Barram concentrated on "Bill
the person" in his remarks. He said
Clinton has vision and described
him as M a substance machine"
because he has well-documented
positions on the important issues.
"In the last 30 years, he has
been the best candidate to run for
president," Barram said.
As each speaker argued that
his candidate was better equipped
to reform U.S. education, the
issue became the focus of much of
the discussion.
Freshman Lisa Kohn, modera
tor of the debate, had to intervene
on several occasions as each
speaker disputed the accuracy or
relevance of the other's claims.
Both freshman Lance Lange, co
chair of the Stanford Democrats,
and senior Paul Garrett, president
of the College Republicans, said
they were disappointed by the poor
turnout.

"Maybe it's just an indication
of the time of year," Lange said.
But, he added, it might also
reflect students' apathy and their
dissatisfaction with the political
process.
Garrett attributed the low
turnout to the fact that "a lot of
students don't care yet, because
November is such a long way
away."
The concluding remarks were
made by Garrett and freshman
Mike Zwibelman, co-chair of the
Stanford Democrats.
The Stanford Democrats, the
Stanford Republicans and Stan
ford in Government arranged the
debate.
Lange said the Stanford
Democrats are planning to hold
similar debates in the future.
Although there was no time in
last night's discussion to discuss
detailed policy, Lange said he was
"impressed by the number of
issues that we touched on."
