# Cohen takes Daily election
## 
### Miranda Doyle She didn't write this 
June Cohen knows that "the pen is
mightier than the sword." But she also
knows that the tongue beats either.
Cohen, who was elected Daily Vol. 202
editor in chief yesterday, licks people
when she wants to get her way. Some
times it works.
A senior majoring in anthropology and
political science, "Licker" may be 24 by
the time she graduates.
"I don't want to be an undergraduate
at age 24," she said. "But I have trouble
working those units."
Cohen has had a hold on her registra
tion 11 out of the 12 quarters she has
been at Stanford. But "that's confidential
information," according to Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson.
Yet unmarried, Cohen plans to spend
the summer in Chico, Calif. — home of
Playboy's No. 1 party school in the coun
try. "Let's just say that I have an intern
ship there," she said.
The first Jewish editor in chief to win
the election in five volumes, Cohen said
she wouldn't feel bad living in Joel Stein's
shadow. "I'll have him shave," she said of

Stein, her senior formal date.
In her victory speech, Cohen assured a
nervous constituency that she was not
afraid of working with men. "I deal very
well with men," she said. "I just wouldn't
want any of them to follow me home and
run their fingers through my hair."
Cohen has lots of hair. The long and
curly kind.
At The Daily, Cohen has been in a vari
ety of positions. She's considered one of
the most flexible editors-elect ever.
Cohen plans to make a slew of changes
in the next volume, but said there is one
thing she wouldn't dream of altering in
the least.
"I don't know why, but I love that
'Party Page' thing we do. It's the only
chance I get to see people."
One change Cohen plans to make is to
create an "educated traveler" section. "So
many uneducated travelers running around,
I just don't think it's safe anymore."
Cohen defeated fellow staff member Dave
Bianco, who was running on the"I Prefer
Not to Have a Stanford Daily" platform.
Unlike many past editors, Cohen
promises not to get fat and gross during
her volume. "Only pasta and salads for
me," she promised. Cha, right.
