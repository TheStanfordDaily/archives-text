## Screen your calls, kids 
### 
THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY

My parents always call at
the worst times. If I have
a take-home midterm due
in two hours, they'll call. If I'm in
the middle of a conversation with
my RFs about how expensive a
practical joke with liquid Styro
foam can prove to be, they'll call.
If I'm about to have intense sex
with two beautiful women wear
ing nothing but lifting belts, Wes
son oil and Obsession, they'll call.
Well, I'm sure they would.
So last week, when I sat down
to write my column, I wasn't sur
prised when the phone rang.
We got through the normal
chit-chat — the "How's classes?"
"How are your friends?" and "Can
you tape something while you're
watching something on a different
channel?"
Then my mom said that there
was something important she had

to tell me.
I panicked. Did my father run
the lawn mower over my para
keet's grave — causing an ugly, yet
enlightening Whitmanesque
reunion with nature and sweet
meats? Did she videotape over the
Bosom Buddies episode where you
can see the outline of Donna
Dixon's nipples through her shirt?
"Your father and I are getting
divorced."
I didn't know what to say. I
mean, I knew what to say when
my friends broke up, but "Just
think about what a good time you
had during the last 26 years"
didn't seem to cut it.
Nor did I feel comfortable
telling them how good it would be
to get out and start dating again —
because I'd have to break the news
that there aren't too many places
left to go to get egg creams any
more.
Instead I asked if I could get
reimbursed for last year's anniver
sary gift.
I talked to each of them for a
while, and they told me that
they'd be moving out of the house
at the end of this month and that
they'd keep me posted as things
arose.
I hung up the phone and it
occurred to me:
"I'm way too old for this."
This happens to people in Judy
Blume books where every other
character keeps saying "You real
ize it's not your fault, don't you?"
until the little kid starts wonder
ing if it is his fault after all.
What did they expect me to do?
Was I supposed to spend meta
physical every-other-weekends
with them, making myself come
home a little earlier on odd week
ends? Would they fight over my
custody if all it meant was paying
my Visa bills?
And then my mind started
going and the real questions start
ing pouring in. Like, "How can I
work this situation to my greatest
financial benefit?"
I drafted separate letters to
them both, explaining how
although my love and allegiance
were not, by any means, pur
chasable commodities, they
would be available for short-term
lease depending on the size of the
gift. I even looked into opening an
800 number.
But then I started to think,
"Where will I spend Thanksgiv
ing?" and "Whose house should I
stay in for the summer?" and "Are
silk boxers suddenly an appropri
ate Father's Day gift?"
And what if they find other peo
ple — evil, step-parent-people
who'll be really ugly and stupid
and want to spank us, but our des
perate, lonely, love-hungry par-

ents won't be able to see their true dark
side? Would I be permitted to go to the ball?

So this is the last weeke\ J I can call
home and reach both of them in the same
house with one phone call. And, though I
didn't know it, I guess Spring Break was the
last time we'll all go out as a family.
Now, when I'm in the middle of some
thing important, the odds of being inter

rupted by a phone call will be twice as high.
I guess this was some sort of twisted
catharsis. Don't try this at home, kids.

Joel Stein feels especially alone and
insignificant when people turn out the
lights while he is still in the bathroom.

more.
Instead I asked if I could get
reimbursed for last year's anniver
sary gift.
I talked to each of them for a
while, and they told me that
they'd be moving out of the house
at the end of this month and that
they'd keep me posted as things
arose.
I hung up the phone and it
occurred to me:
"I'm way too old for this."
This happens to people in Judy
Blume books where every other
character keeps saying "You real
ize it's not your fault, don't you?"
until the little kid starts wonder
ing if it is his fault after all.
What did they expect me to do?
Was I supposed to spend meta
physical every-other-weekends
with them, making myself come
home a little earlier on odd week
ends? Would they fight over my
custody if all it meant was paying
my Visa bills?
And then my mind started
going and the real questions start
ing pouring in. Like, "How can I
work this situation to my greatest
financial benefit?"
I drafted separate letters to
them both, explaining how
although my love and allegiance
were not, by any means, pur
chasable commodities, they
would be available for short-term
lease depending on the size of the
gift. I even looked into opening an
800 number.
But then I started to think,
"Where will I spend Thanksgiv

stay in for the summer?" and "Are
silk boxers suddenly an appropri

And what if they find other peo

and want to spank us, but our des

ents won't be able to see their true dark
side? Would I be permitted to go to the ball?

So this is the last weeke\ J I can call
home and reach both of them in the same
house with one phone call. And, though I
didn't know it, I guess Spring Break was the
last time we'll all go out as a family.
Now, when I'm in the middle of some
thing important, the odds of being inter

rupted by a phone call will be twice as high.
I guess this was some sort of twisted
catharsis. Don't try this at home, kids.

Joel Stein feels especially alone and
insignificant when people turn out the
lights while he is still in the bathroom.
