# Chocolate fix
## Students find divine aid in this 'food of the gods' Theater 
### Kiri Zooper Staff writer 
You sit bleary-eyed at a computer, a
string of drool hanging from your mouth.
Incapacitated. Higher brain functions
have shut down. You hear sirens. Hallu
cinations begin. You need chocolate.
Not everyone experiences such severe
symptoms, but chocolate lovers univer
sally acknowledge the miracle powers of
the cacao bean.

Whatever the source of your angst —
from a really bad day to a 15-page paper
due in 15 minutes — put a little hot
fudge on it and you'll feel better. Pop

eye carried the wrong stuff around in a
can; a little Hershey's' syrup and he
could have kicked Bluto's ass a lot

faster.
Chocoholism is usually
chronic, and there is no known
cure. However, some cases can

go into remission and be revived by par
ticular circumstances — circumstances,
especially indigenous to college campus
es, that have to do with nasty things like
honors theses.
A current TV ad instructs us to "Get a
Hershey bar and get happy." While it is
true that chocolate has glee-generating
power, it must also be acknowledged as a
fine suicide preventative.
When that research paper is about to
drive you over the edge, the best thing to
do is say to hell with it and go to Haagen
Dazs; otherwise, you might do something
desperate.
The question then becomes where to
get chocolate and what kind to get.
There's everything from unleaded to
high-octane, available in all shapes and
sizes.
Max's Opera Cafe — home of singing
servers — has a mean chocolate cake with
several layers of a frosting that could very
well change your life. Top it off with a
nice Puccini aria sung by your waiter and
some serious ambiance, and you've really
got something. Max's desserts are not to
be missed, but they are not for the light
of wallet, either. Excellent for when your
I parents come to town.
For a really good hot fudge sundae, the
Peninsula Creamery in Palo Alto can
hardly be exceeded — the ice cream is
fresh and the natives are friendly. To pre
pare the palate, start out with a Velveeta
burger and some onion rings, and bring
i some quarters for the jukebox.
Decent sundaes can be found at

Swensen's, but for the ultimate
encounter, make your way to Ghi

rardelli Square in San brancisco.
