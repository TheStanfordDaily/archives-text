# Chocolate fix
## Students find divine aid in this 'food of the gods' Theater 
### Kiri Zooper Staff writer 
You sit bleary-eyed at a computer, a
string of drool hanging from your mouth.
Incapacitated. Higher brain functions
have shut down. You hear sirens. Hallu
cinations begin. You need chocolate.
Not everyone experiences such severe
symptoms, but chocolate lovers univer
sally acknowledge the miracle powers of
the cacao bean.

Whatever the source of your angst —
from a really bad day to a 15-page paper
due in 15 minutes — put a little hot
fudge on it and you'll feel better. Pop

eye carried the wrong stuff around in a
can; a little Hershey's' syrup and he
could have kicked Bluto's ass a lot

faster.
Chocoholism is usually
chronic, and there is no known
cure. However, some cases can

go into remission and be revived by par
ticular circumstances — circumstances,
especially indigenous to college campus
es, that have to do with nasty things like
honors theses.
A current TV ad instructs us to "Get a
Hershey bar and get happy." While it is
true that chocolate has glee-generating
power, it must also be acknowledged as a
fine suicide preventative.
When that research paper is about to
drive you over the edge, the best thing to
do is say to hell with it and go to Haagen
Dazs; otherwise, you might do something
desperate.
The question then becomes where to
get chocolate and what kind to get.
There's everything from unleaded to
high-octane, available in all shapes and
sizes.
Max's Opera Cafe — home of singing
servers — has a mean chocolate cake with
several layers of a frosting that could very
well change your life. Top it off with a
nice Puccini aria sung by your waiter and
some serious ambiance, and you've really
got something. Max's desserts are not to
be missed, but they are not for the light
of wallet, either. Excellent for when your
I parents come to town.
For a really good hot fudge sundae, the
Peninsula Creamery in Palo Alto can
hardly be exceeded — the ice cream is
fresh and the natives are friendly. To pre
pare the palate, start out with a Velveeta
burger and some onion rings, and bring
i some quarters for the jukebox.
Decent sundaes can be found at

Swensen's, but for the ultimate
encounter, make your way to Ghi

rardelli Square in San brancisco.

The location is newly remodeled,
and vou'll even get to see the gooey
stuff being made.
There are huge vats stirred by
overgrown egg beaters, and signs
that describe the mystical transfor
mation from cacao bean to food of
the gods.
At Ghirardelli, try the Choco
late Decadence sundae, an inven
tion worthy of a Nobel Prize for
happiness inducement. Severe
addicts have been known to find
themselves in the Ghirardelli park
ing lot with no memory of how
they got there.
The Chocolate Decadence is
chocolate ice cream, hot fudge,
raspberry sauce and whipped
cream, sprinkled with Ghirardelli
chocolate chips. According to
myth, the high from this sundae
can last for several days.
It is, in the immortal words of a
friend, "worth breaking Lent for."
If you're not Catholic, you can fill
in the blank with something of
equal personal sacrilege.
Ghirardelli also has everything
from boxed sets to scratch-and
sniff T-shirts reeking of the

blessed substance. So go to the
square, have dinner at Compadres,
browse the bookstore, try your
hand at the gizmos in the Sharper
Image. And then, run, don't walk,
to the Ghirardelli ice cream parlor
and partake.

People who don't
get enough choco
late suffer from
irrationality,
grouchiness and
poor judgement.

If you like chocolate and you've
never done this, don't graduate
without making die trip with a few
kindred spirits.
Then there is always the regular
bar variety, which can range from
Hershey's with almonds to your
more exciting "gourmet" chocolate
— usually hailing from Switzer
land or some such place. Gourmet
bars are available at the Bookstore
and at upmarket grocery stores
like Draeger's in Menlo Park.

Among authorities, there seems
to be a consensus that other ice
creams cower in humiliation
before Ben and Jerry's New York
Super Fudge Chunky with white
and dark chocolate pieces. This is
not for the faint of heart.
Also quite orgasmic is Haagen
Dazs Chocolate Chocolate Chip, a
personal favorite. If you suffer
from fat-phobia, try Honey Hill
Farms Chocolate Thunder Frozen
Yogurt.
I'm not sure that chocolate is
the key to world peace, but it
might be worth considering.
People who don't get enough
chocolate suffer from irrationali
ty, grouchiness and poor judge
ment.
There is evidently a chocolate
shortage on Capitol Hill. Come to
think of it, chocolate deprivation
would explain a lot of things
about Cal students.
It is safe to say that for sadness
big or small, the cacao bean's the
thing. I used to know a person who
drank a can of Hershe/s chocolate
syrup when things got bad, and it
calmed her down right away.
The days until finals are few,
graduation draws near and, for
some of us, depression levels are
rising. Get a Hershey bar and get
happy.
