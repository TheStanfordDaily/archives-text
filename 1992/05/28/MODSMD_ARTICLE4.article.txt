# Libraries study hours
## Officials rethinking plan to close Green earlier 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Student protests over a pro
posal to close Green Library two
hours earlier next year have
"encouraged" administrators to
determine when Green and
Meyer get the most use before
making a final decision, a library
official said.
Earlier this month, officials
announced a plan to close Green
Library at 10 p.m. next year
rather than midnight on
weeknights as part of its budget
cutting process.
But the proposal elicited more
than 50 letters of complaint from
students — mostly undergraduate
— urging administrators to keep
Green open until midnight,
according to Karen Nagy, director
of academic information resources
for the University's libraries.
Although officials had already
been planning to conduct some
sort of survey about library use,
the letters were an added impetus
"to collect some data that will
allow us to made good decisions"
regarding the library's hours,
Nagy said.
Depending on the informal
study's findings, she said, officials
may decide to keep Green open
later next year.
Nagy noted that many of the

University's branch libraries —
specialized departmental libraries
— may open an hour later next
year, upon the recommendations
of student and faculty budget
committees.
Regardless of the study's find
ings, however, library officials are
"probably going to have to reduce
some hours in one library or the
other," Nagy said.
For the past two weeks, staff at
the entrances, loan desks and ref
erence desks of Green and Meyer
have been tallying the number of
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents using the libraries through
out the day.
In other areas, such as Green's
current periodicals section, stu
dents have been asked to mark
down the hours they are using
that particular section.
By closing Green two hours
earlier, library administrators had
hoped to save between $75,000
and $100,000. As part of the Uni
versity's plan to climb out of its
$43 million budget hole, Library
and Information Resources must
slash expenditures by $3.1 mil
lion.
While the survey results will
not be tabulated until next week,
Nagy said her perception is that
"a lot more undergraduates use
