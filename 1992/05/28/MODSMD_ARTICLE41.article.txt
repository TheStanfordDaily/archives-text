# Witty 'Esperance' stabs at accepted values
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
A man is found face down in
the dirt by the Establishment —
the government, the police and the
media. They endlessly interrogate
him in an effort categorize him,
martyr him, then crucify him.
The scene is in "Esperance,"
written and directed by undergrad
uate Tim O'Brien. Overcoming
such difficulties as missing a light
ing crew and being locked out of
the sound booth, O'Brien and the
nine member cast still gave a good
performance.
The man in the dirt never
speaks and the audience never dis
covers his true identity. The other
characters force him to assume the
role of the ideal homeless man, a
man society can pity while the
issue is timely and the Homeless
Week isn't over.
O'Brien's script slashes at the
shallow manner in which Ameri
cans confront all social problems
and leaves little room for excuses.
The media and the police are cari
catured in ways that don't stray
too far from the truth — the media
is grossly melodramatic, bordering
on sensational, and the police are
more concerned with rules and
order than the people they suppos
edly serve and protect.
"Esperance," with its little jabs
at various institutions, is very
entertaining. Religious symbolism
is cleverly integrated with the visu
al imagery and the background
music.
Surprisingly, all but one song in
the soundtrack — which contains
music that varies tremendously in
style and tone — is done by a sin
gle group, Dead Can Dance. At
one point, the singers are wailing
Middle Eastern chants to instru
ments like the sitar, and at others
they sound no different from a

European modern rock group.
The choreography is a stiff and
forced, but the attempt to integrate
movement into the performance is
appropriate for a post-modern play.
Commenting on the genre of
"Esperance," O'Brien said that his
vision of postmodernity is quite
different from the norm. He said
he purposefully avoided the typical
themes of alienation and discon
nection because he does not view
the modern world as cold and
threatening.
Rather, O'Brien said he wanted
a more humanistic approach, one

that looked for universality that
transcends everyday experience.
"Esperance" reveals the way in
which society releases "guilt with
out really exploring what the
issues really mean to us," he said.
O'Brien — who has done every
thing from meditation in the tradi
tion of Eastern monks to owning
and operating a start-up computer
company eventually worth $10
million — has explored numerous
facets of life, yet said that nothing
outside of the self is truly fulfilling.
In his silk shirt and Italian
slacks, O'Brien fiddled with a

small piece of paper and added,
"I've always been extremely preoc
cupied with that deep question of
what is life about."
This question is posed in
"Esperance" through much of the
dialogue of the play. The script
attempts to bring the audience
closer to a source experience, the
universal O'Brien said "shaped
cultures and religions."

"Esperance" plays Thurday — Sat
urday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 5:30
p.m. in the Little Theater in Memo
rial Hall. Tickets are 55 at the door.
