## diminuendo-and CRESCENDO Beastie Boys return with a vengeance 
### Cheo H. Coker 
When Sista Dee of "Pump It Up" intro
duced the newest video by the Beastie Boys
this March, I was crazy-skeptical. "The
Beasties?" I thought."Come on."
True, this was the group behind hip
hop classics like "Paul Revere," "She's
Crafty" and"The New Style," but these
were also the same people that moved to
L.A. and fell the fuck off with that "Hey
Ladies" thing. Besides, among the white
rappers that were really true to hip-hop,
3RD Bass could rhyme circles around
them.
What could these rap dinosaurs add to
the fray except more mediocrity in a hip
hop industry already deluged with bullshit
loop records from talentless suckas of all
colors?
So I was wrong — I admit playin'
myself by writin' 'em off so soon. The
Beastie Boys, like Uncle L, prove that, with
a harder edge and refined skills, a come
back is never out of the question.
"Pass The Mic" was one of the most

exciting songs I had heard in months.
Without a bit of exaggeration, it blew my
mind. Not only were the Beasties passin'
the mike back and forth like the old-school
pros that they were, they were also playin'
the instruments. MCA's funky bassriffs
kicked throughout, a clever Beach Boys
like chorus weaved in and out of Ad-
Rock's guitar feedback and to top it off,
Mike D kicked a breakbeat with more fla
vor than a Mr. Goodbar.
When I jumped out of my seat, East
Coast stompin' like a Leader Of The New
School, the people in the TV lounge must
have been thinkin', "Here Cheo goes
again!" I might have been one of the only
people in Ujamaa who saw a new era in
hip-hop, but it didn't matter; revolutions
start one person at a time.
"Check Your Head," the group's third
album, is a legendary release. Not only do
the Beastie Boys produce the majority of
the tracks this time around, they even play
the music.

The dinosaurs of rap have returned with a startlingly good new album, "Check Your
Head." From left to right, the Beastie Boys are: King Ad-Rock, Mike D and MCA.
Many forget that way before
they were a hip-hop band, the
Beasties were punkers in N.Y.'s
once-thriving Lower East Side
scene. MCA plunks out some
mean mo'fuggin' bass riffs, while
Mike D's drum skills and Ad-
Rock's guitar mastery remain unri
valed.
Money Mark's organ riffs just
take things to a higher level, topped
in with D.J. Hurricane's scratches
for hip-hop emphasis.
The result is a raw, stream
lined, agitated sound that mixes
the best elements of hardcore funk,
alternative thrash and, surprising
ly, jazz fusion.
The group pays just as much
homage to The Meters, War and
Sly Stone as they do to the Sex Pis
tols, Bad Brains and Steve Miller.
But don't even consider frontin' on
the group's integrity,- first and fore
most this is a rap album, and
despite the diversity of musical

sounds, the Beasties manage to flex
mad freestyle skills reminiscent, at
times, of their old Profile/Def Jam
contemporaries RUN-D.M.C.
"Jimmy James" and "Funky
Boss," the introductory songs, set
the stage for the rap-thrash fusion.
The instrumentation on both,
combining live music with rhythm
scratches and effective samples,
provide the listener with the best of
both worlds.
The lyrics, especially on
"James," reveal a conscious effort
by the group to be taken seriously
as rap artists; the juvenile delin
quent, dusted, beer-soaked antics
of "Licensed To 111" are long gone.
"Pass The Mic," "Professor
Booty," "So Whatcha Want" and
"Stand Together" are most indica
tive of the group's dedication to
hardcore hip-hop scene. "Pass" and
"Booty" kick much underground
flavor.
All three rappers pass rhymes
off to each other in a fashion that
can be witnessed at those under
ground jams where the only tools a
rapper has to prove his skills are a
mike stand and a makeshift stage.

Some of the album's strongest
points, however, aren't even the
way-up-to-par hip-hop songs. The
instrumental tracks, with minimal
lyrics, prove that beastie Boys
could easily double as a funk band.
While listening to "Lighten Up,"
"Groove Holmes" and "Namaste,"
the congas, organ and '60s Ham
mond organ would make one
swear that they were listening to an
old War or El Chicano live out
takes.
The premier track, however, is
"Somethings Got To Give"; Sla
hammin beyond comprehension!
Less than a minute into the Beast
ies' instrumental, the ground cov
ered by Sly Stone's "Poet" meets
Steve Miller's "Fly Like An Eagle"
for an earth-shattering combina
tion that defies description. Mind
blowin'.
"Check Your Head" will defi
nitely make you check yours.
Without a doubt the tracks are
"Finger Lickin' Good," providing a
satisfying funk grab bag for both
the rap purist and the occasional
hip-hop fan. Don't call it a fluke,
'cause the Beasties are here to stay.

rapper has to prove his skills are a
mike stand and a makeshift stage.

Some of the album's strongest
points, however, aren't even the
way-up-to-par hip-hop songs. The
instrumental tracks, with minimal
lyrics, prove that beastie Boys
could easily double as a funk band.
While listening to "Lighten Up,"
"Groove Holmes" and "Namaste,"
the congas, organ and '60s Ham
mond organ would make one
swear that they were listening to an
old War or El Chicano live out
takes.
The premier track, however, is
"Somethings Got To Give"; Sla
hammin beyond comprehension!
Less than a minute into the Beast
ies' instrumental, the ground cov
ered by Sly Stone's "Poet" meets
Steve Miller's "Fly Like An Eagle"
for an earth-shattering combina
tion that defies description. Mind
blowin'.
"Check Your Head" will defi
nitely make you check yours.
Without a doubt the tracks are
"Finger Lickin' Good," providing a
satisfying funk grab bag for both
the rap purist and the occasional
hip-hop fan. Don't call it a fluke,
'cause the Beasties are here to stay.
When Sista Dee of "Pump It Up" intro
duced the newest video by the Beastie Boys
this March, I was crazy-skeptical. "The
Beasties?" I thought."Come on."
True, this was the group behind hip
hop classics like "Paul Revere," "She's
Crafty" and"The New Style," but these
were also the same people that moved to
L.A. and fell the fuck off with that "Hey
Ladies" thing. Besides, among the white
rappers that were really true to hip-hop,
3RD Bass could rhyme circles around
them.
What could these rap dinosaurs add to
the fray except more mediocrity in a hip
hop industry already deluged with bullshit
loop records from talentless suckas of all
colors?
So I was wrong — I admit playin'
myself by writin' 'em off so soon. The
Beastie Boys, like Uncle L, prove that, with
a harder edge and refined skills, a come
back is never out of the question.
"Pass The Mic" was one of the most

exciting songs I had heard in months.
Without a bit of exaggeration, it blew my
mind. Not only were the Beasties passin'
the mike back and forth like the old-school
pros that they were, they were also playin'
the instruments. MCA's funky bassriffs
kicked throughout, a clever Beach Boys
like chorus weaved in and out of Ad-
Rock's guitar feedback and to top it off,
Mike D kicked a breakbeat with more fla
vor than a Mr. Goodbar.
When I jumped out of my seat, East
Coast stompin' like a Leader Of The New
School, the people in the TV lounge must
have been thinkin', "Here Cheo goes
again!" I might have been one of the only
people in Ujamaa who saw a new era in
hip-hop, but it didn't matter; revolutions
start one person at a time.
"Check Your Head," the group's third
album, is a legendary release. Not only do
the Beastie Boys produce the majority of
the tracks this time around, they even play
the music.

The dinosaurs of rap have returned with a startlingly good new album, "Check Your
Head." From left to right, the Beastie Boys are: King Ad-Rock, Mike D and MCA.
Many forget that way before
they were a hip-hop band, the
Beasties were punkers in N.Y.'s
once-thriving Lower East Side
scene. MCA plunks out some
mean mo'fuggin' bass riffs, while
Mike D's drum skills and Ad-
Rock's guitar mastery remain unri
valed.
Money Mark's organ riffs just
take things to a higher level, topped
in with D.J. Hurricane's scratches
for hip-hop emphasis.
The result is a raw, stream
lined, agitated sound that mixes
the best elements of hardcore funk,
alternative thrash and, surprising
ly, jazz fusion.
The group pays just as much
homage to The Meters, War and
Sly Stone as they do to the Sex Pis
tols, Bad Brains and Steve Miller.
But don't even consider frontin' on
the group's integrity,- first and fore
most this is a rap album, and
despite the diversity of musical

sounds, the Beasties manage to flex
mad freestyle skills reminiscent, at
times, of their old Profile/Def Jam
contemporaries RUN-D.M.C.
"Jimmy James" and "Funky
Boss," the introductory songs, set
the stage for the rap-thrash fusion.
The instrumentation on both,
combining live music with rhythm
scratches and effective samples,
provide the listener with the best of
both worlds.
The lyrics, especially on
"James," reveal a conscious effort
by the group to be taken seriously
as rap artists; the juvenile delin
quent, dusted, beer-soaked antics
of "Licensed To 111" are long gone.
"Pass The Mic," "Professor
Booty," "So Whatcha Want" and
"Stand Together" are most indica
tive of the group's dedication to
hardcore hip-hop scene. "Pass" and
"Booty" kick much underground
flavor.
All three rappers pass rhymes
off to each other in a fashion that
can be witnessed at those under
ground jams where the only tools a
rapper has to prove his skills are a
mike stand and a makeshift stage.
