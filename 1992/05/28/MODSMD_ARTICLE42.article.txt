## diminuendo-and CRESCENDO Beastie Boys return with a vengeance 
### Cheo H. Coker 
When Sista Dee of "Pump It Up" intro
duced the newest video by the Beastie Boys
this March, I was crazy-skeptical. "The
Beasties?" I thought."Come on."
True, this was the group behind hip
hop classics like "Paul Revere," "She's
Crafty" and"The New Style," but these
were also the same people that moved to
L.A. and fell the fuck off with that "Hey
Ladies" thing. Besides, among the white
rappers that were really true to hip-hop,
3RD Bass could rhyme circles around
them.
What could these rap dinosaurs add to
the fray except more mediocrity in a hip
hop industry already deluged with bullshit
loop records from talentless suckas of all
colors?
So I was wrong â€” I admit playin'
myself by writin' 'em off so soon. The
Beastie Boys, like Uncle L, prove that, with
a harder edge and refined skills, a come
back is never out of the question.
"Pass The Mic" was one of the most

exciting songs I had heard in months.
Without a bit of exaggeration, it blew my
mind. Not only were the Beasties passin'
the mike back and forth like the old-school
pros that they were, they were also playin'
the instruments. MCA's funky bassriffs
kicked throughout, a clever Beach Boys
like chorus weaved in and out of Ad-
Rock's guitar feedback and to top it off,
Mike D kicked a breakbeat with more fla
vor than a Mr. Goodbar.
When I jumped out of my seat, East
Coast stompin' like a Leader Of The New
School, the people in the TV lounge must
have been thinkin', "Here Cheo goes
again!" I might have been one of the only
people in Ujamaa who saw a new era in
hip-hop, but it didn't matter; revolutions
start one person at a time.
"Check Your Head," the group's third
album, is a legendary release. Not only do
the Beastie Boys produce the majority of
the tracks this time around, they even play
the music.
