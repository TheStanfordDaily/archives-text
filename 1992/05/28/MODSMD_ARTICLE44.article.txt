## Soldiers, audience charmed by Greek isle 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
Steeped in the grand tradition
of Italian cinema, it is no surprise
that director Gabriele Salvatores'
"Mediterraneo" clinched the
Oscar for "Best Foreign Language
Film" this year.
Yet even when examined apart
from the Italian tradition, the
film's visual charm and cunning
narration combine remarkably,
yielding a cinematic elegance that

It is not the sol
diers who forget
their country, but
their country who
forgets them.

can not be denied.
Based on the writings of a Ital
ian sergeant who fought in World
War Two, "Mediterraneo" is the
story of eight Italian soldiers'
existence on a Greek isle in the
Aegean sea.
Their goal, to protect the
island in the name of fascist Italy,
curdles after they witness the
destruction of their ship and later
lose the ability to communicate
with their country.
Completely cut off from the
rest of the world, they realize the
frivolity of their mission, slowly
resolving to assimilate into the
native Greek culture of the island.
Metaphorically, the eight char
acters' transition from soldiers to
civilians is important, for it illus

trates a condition Salvatores
believes inherent in his own gen
eration.
"My generation has taken
flight many times," explained the
director. "In the 60s and and 70s,
it was political commitment and
drugs."
"Then in the 80s , we fled from
politics. But like the soldiers in
the film, we are not necessarily
concerned with escaping respon
sibility, but rather we escape as a
way of protest," Salvatores said.

The film makes this argument
quite convincingly, for it is not
the soldiers who forget their coun
try but their country who forgets
them.
Intertwined with the director's
powerful observation is a well
packaged mixture of acting, pho
tography, editing and music that
successfully submerge the film's
message in sensuality and light
hearted humor.
The cast of "Mediterraneo"
stands as one of the better acting

collaborations of the year.
The only visible problem is
Salvatores' use of the island's
inhabitants â€” they are decidedly
one-dimensional in comparison
to the eight soldiers.
Nonetheless, Salvatores' fifth
film in ten years is is an excellent
beginner film for those interested
foreign film, but intimidated by
the language barrier.
Knowledge of Italian is not a
prerequisite for enjoying this
film.
