# 'Far and Away lightly romps through love tale
## 
### Kiri Zooper Staff writer 
There is no doubt that today's
younger directors have a fascina
tion with the old-fashioned Holly
wood epics. Ron Howard's new
film, "Far and Away," is grounds
for his nomination into the Cine
mascope club, right next to Kevin
Costner.
As you probably know unless
you've been hiding under a big rock
for the last few weeks, "Far and
Away" stars Tom Cruise and
Nicole Kidman, Hollywood's
favorite husband and wife.
The pair plays Joseph and Shan
non, a mismatched young Irish
couple who emigrate to America in
the late 1800s with hopes of claim
ing property in the Oklahoma land
rush. Both are independent, and
their similar personalities push
them into conflict with one anoth
er.
Upon arrival in Boston, their
dream of reaching the frontier is
jeopardized when they are robbed.
Penniless, they obtain jobs from
the boss of the Irish immigrants,
played by Colm Meaney, and have
no choice but to cohabit in a room
in a whorehouse — arguing every
step of the way.
After months in the Boston
slums, Joseph and Shannon com
plete their rite of passage and make
it to the frontier. In a sweeping
finale, the duo ride in the race to
stake a claim, and finally openly
declare their love for one another.
The photography alone would
make this movie worth seeing.
Starting in Ireland and moving out
to the American west, Howard
never misses the chance to create
panoramas worthy of David Lean

("Lawrence of Arabia").
But the most attractive thing
about "Far and Away" is the chem
istry between Cruise and Kidman.
Despite the story's simplicity and
occasional bouts of sappiness, the
film works because of the couple's
energy. They had fun making this
movie, and it shows.

"Far and Away"
pays tribute to the
old-style epic, yet
it retains the inti
macy and humor
that such movies
often lack.

The mix of adventure and
romance is a perfect vehicle for
Cruise's own brand of perfor
mance. He is part hard-hitting sur
vivor and part boyish charmer. Kid
man is especially enjoyable as the
spunky, stifled aristocrat who just
wants to get out and ride horses.
"Far and Away" pays tribute to
the old-style epic, yet it retains the
intimacy and humor that such
movies often lack. While it may
not go down in film history as a
masterpiece, it is a finely crafted,
ambitious work.
Above all, it's a whole lot of fun
to watch, and seems to have some
thing for everyone. There are Irish
countrysides, steamship passages,
boxing matches, love scenes, cov
ered wagons, sappy speeches and
big fiery sunsets. What more do
you need?
