## Third 'Lethal Weapon' misfires 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
I must be the only person in the entire United States
who thinks "Lethal Weapon 3" sucks.
We're not talking mild disagreement with the thou
sands of people who made it the second-largest three-day
opening in movie history, or who told "Entertainment
This Week" they'd see it again or tell a friend to see it.
The only explanation for its popularity must be peo
ple's desire to save face. They've rushed out to see such
an eagerly anticipated sequel, only to discover it is
garbage.
In this installment, Sgt. Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is
still approaching retirement, counting the days before he
can get away from his psycho partner, Riggs (Mel Gib
son).
You'd think after everything Riggs has gotten him
into, Murtaugh would know better by now. But he still
allows himself to get caught up in completely ludicrous
situations, such as the opening sequence, in which Riggs
decides to try and defuse a bomb just for the hell of it.
Yet after disastrous consequences, the two detectives
are only busted down to patrolmen, apparently to allow
the screenwriters to make jokes about the tightness of
Murtaugh's uniform or to have Riggs go nuts while mak
ing arrests and writing tickets.
Somehow the running gag of excessive force by L.A.
cops just isn't funny these days. But even excusing the
unfortunate bad timing of the film, "Lethal Weapon 3" is
a miasma of coincidence and implausibility that makes
it a rancid piece of cinema in any era.
Wherever Riggs goes, there's super-sinister crime

activity afoot, and suspending disbelief that often gets
awfully tiring. And how Riggs and Murtaugh regain their
detective shields is a truly confounding stroke of exposi
tion.
In an effort to up the ante from the previous two
"Lethal Weapons," the filmmakers have to heap more
punishment on Riggs' body than a human could possi
bly stand. He starts to become cartoonish with his Ener
gizer bunny impression (keeps going and going and ...),
distorting the overall tone of the picture.
The nominal plot revolves around a gun-running
scheme involving an ex-cop, drug dealers and street
gangs. The plot is tight and interesting but the dialogue
and ancillary action surrounding it are trite and annoy
ing, making the film an even bigger disappointment.
Simply put, it's not funny and it's not a good action
film either. The ads say "the magic is back," but nothing
could be farther from the truth. The magic, quite frankly,
is gone.
There are flashes of quality, of course. The addition
of a tough, sexy female love interest for Riggs is one of
the most surprisingly effective bits, and a scene in which
Riggs and Cole (Rene Russo) compare scars is a wonder
fully entertaining moment.
As with everything else in "Lethal Weapon 3," how
ever, the screenwriters drop the ball by having Cole flip
pantly chalk her toughness up to PMS and by having her
be not quite as tough as Riggs.
If there must be a "Lethal Weapon 4," they'd do well
to finally put Murtaugh out to pasture (along with the
truly abrasive and pointless Joe Pesci, reprising his role
from "Lethal Weapon 2") and let Rijgs and Cole be a
double-barreled lethal weapon.
