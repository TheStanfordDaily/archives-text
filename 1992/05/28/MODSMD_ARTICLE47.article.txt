# No cracks in this Pavement
## Cryptic debut CD enchanting 
### Rosario Rodriguez 
I have this CD on a two-day
loan from one of my best friends.
He wouldn't part with it for longer.
Either I need new friends, or
this is the sort of fanaticism Pave
ment has generated with their
debut album, "Slanted and
Enchanted."
Reminiscent of the Velvet
Underground, Pavement showers
the listener with atonal vocals and
enigmatic lyrics that, mixed with
untuned guitars, somehow create
an appealing pop sound.
Pavement is most entertaining
when they depend on a barrage of
fuzzy guitars filling the back
ground, with up-front vocals deliv
ered in a very familiar, relaxed
manner.
The song "Loretta's Scars" is a
good example. Relying on three
guitars to repeat a three-chord pro
gression, the group creates a ten
sion that isn't quite resolved. The
song never wavers from its deeply
moving, cryptic lyrics and desper
ate guitars that wail with an amaz
ing intensity.
On the other side of the spec
trum, would-be political activism
appears on a couple of songs,
though it's never clear what the
issues are. Perhaps in "Two
States," with mock-classic rock
guitar rolling in the background
and screaming vocals, the band is
arguing for a separate Northern
and Southern California. More
likely, as with most of the lyrics on
the album, these are words that fit
the mood they are trying to create.
With the exception of "Two
States" and "Fame Throwa," most
of the songs are more personal
accounts. The first cut, "Summer
Babe," has a love-gone-sour theme.
The song climaxes with "You took
it all. Every time I sit around I find
I'm shot." The image is one of sad
ness and resignation, but it would
take a cryptologist to discover
exactly why.
The next song, "Trigger Cut,"
has the same endearing flat, cool
vocal approach with hum-along
guitars, and even a "sha-la-la"
background. Perhaps the best track
on the CD, "Trigger Cut" has
some fluid tempo changes that
aren't terribly original or stunning,
but they itill capture the pre-punk

One wouldn't mis
take 'Perfume-V for
a Nirvana send-up
even though it has
similar structure

American rock beat.
"No Life Singed Her" shifts to
dense guitars and screeching
vocals with a uptempo beat. The
words are screamed out in a man
ner reminiscent of The Fall; the
guitars vaguely resemble early
Jesus and Mary Chain,- the lyrics
are similar to the random spewings
of Thor in the Sugarcubes.
Their sound, however is never
derivative. One wouldn't mistake
"Perfume-V" for a Nirvana send

up even though it has similar
structure — noisy chorus with qui
eter verses. The vocals are too laid
back and subdued. The chorus,
with the most memorable lyrics of
the album, "She's got a radio
active, and it makes me feel OK, (I
don't feel OK)," is actually pretty.
The blend of styles is never reduc
tive, but seems to expand on previ
ous ideas.
Pavement is based in Stockton,
and "Slanted and Enchanted" was
recorded in the drummer's small
16-track studio. The CD was
released this month on Matador
records in New York, which is
where the group picked up a couple
of its members.
I can only hope that a transcon
tinental relationship like theirs
can sustain itself given all the hype
that has surrounded their music,
and all the offers (read: major
label) that are sure to come.
