# Play defends artistic freedom
## 'City of Refuge' puts Marquis de Sade in his place â€” the toilet 
### Travis Farr Staff writer 
What do you get when you combine a cavernous
restroom, the letters of the Marquis de Sade and an
uninhibited cast?
About 75 minutes of Jesse Helms' worst night
mare, it turns out. "City of Refuge" is an experimen
tal theater production of a script written by the chair
man of the French department, Jean-Marie Apos
tolides. The play is based on the letters of the Marquis
de Sade, an 18th-century French nobleman whose
name gives us the word "sadism."
The beginning of the play sets the scene. The Mar
quis has been thrown in prison at the request of his
mother-in-law for some of his perverse writings and
practices. As a defense against his plight, he begins to
withdraw into his imagination. His jailers become
more and more cruel, driving the Marquis to leave
reality completely and live within his mind.
"City of Refuge" is performed in the men's
restroom behind Building 300. Strange as it may
sound, the bathroom is the perfect place for the per
formance. It's cold, it's uncomfortable and it's weird,
and all of those qualities suck the audience right into
the Marquis' cell.
The Marquis's imagination is graphically depicted.
Without giving too much away, the fantasy scenes
look like "Justify My Love" would have if there was no
such thing as the FCC. There are ropes, apples and
non-traditional gender roles. The actors and actresses
do a great job with some very difficult parts. And,

needless to say, the costumes do not dominate the
spectacle.
The production raises all of the hair-splitting, line
drawing questions about Where Art Ends, but it turns
out that that's the point.
This is a performance designed to get the "redeem
ing social importance" crowd all hot and bothered.
The message of the play is that society represses not
only individual actions, but also tries to control the
imaginations and thoughts of its members. Imagina
tion is an escape, a city of refuge, from the real world,
and an important part of a sane human psyche.
In challenging society's standards for art, the play
is challenging the idea that there should be standards
at all. The aim of the play is not to push the boundary
as far out as it will go, but to protest the existence of
any boundary anywhere.
"City of Refuge" is part of an attempt by its direc
tor, Babak A. Ebrahimian, to bring film and theater
closer together. The actors use microphones, and the
actions in Sade's imagination take place behind a
screen.
Ebrahimian feels that theater has become boring
and overly conservative, yet with the writing, acting
and especially the staging in "City of Refuge," he has
fashioned a unique and fascinating experience.

"City of Refuge " runs until May 31. Performances are
at 8 p.m. nightly, with an additional performance at
midnight on Friday. Admission is $5 for students,
$10 general. On June 1, there will be a panel discus
sion of the play at 4 p.m. in the Humanities Annex.
