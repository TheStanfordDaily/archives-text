# DA charges student in dorm CD thefts case
## 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
The Santa Clara County Dis
trict Attorney has filed charges
against freshman Scott Faulkner,
a Donner resident, for the chain
of compact disc thefts in Donner
and Larkin last week.
Faulkner has been charged
with burglary and will most likely
be penalized with some sort of
public service, according to Stan
ford Police.
Police responded last Tuesday
and Wednesday after six students
reported having a number of CDs
stolen from their rooms. Faulkn
er, who has since been removed
from Donner and placed in a guest
house in Governor's Corner, could
not be reached for comment.
According to Stanford Police
Sgt. Richard Tipton, Faulkner —
who is currently a member of
Stanford's baseball team — told
the police that he intended to buy
steroids with the money he
received from selling the CDs.
But Tipton said Faulkner did
not obtain any steroids because
he had to pay off an American
Express bill first.
"We have no evidence of an
actual purchase ... but he told us
he was going to buy [steroids],"
Tipton said.
Tipton added that he hopes
Faulkner will come to the Police
Department and turn himself in.
"If he doesn't, I will have to go out

there looking for him and bring
him back," he said.
Freshman JefTßaird, Donner's
dorm president, said the incident
has not had "that large of an
effect on the dorm."
"A lot of people were not here
when it happened or did not
hear about it until the entire
incident had passed," he said.
"Really, only a few people were
actually affected by the whole
thing."
Freshman Brian Kirsch, a
Donner resident, said he had six
or seven CDs stolen from his
shelf. "Those CDs were worth
about $15 to $17 each, so I'm

pretty upset," he said.
"It doesn't seem like the dorm
as a whole has been really affected
by this," Kirsch added.
"And the people who are really
upset think it will be taken care of
by the police. [The victims] will
get their retribution... That's all
that matters."
Kirsch said he was not immedi
ately aware that his CDs were
stolen, but when others reported
the thefts, he noticed he was
missing CDs as well.
"I found out way later than
everyone else did. I guess I just
never thought that I would be
hit," he said.
