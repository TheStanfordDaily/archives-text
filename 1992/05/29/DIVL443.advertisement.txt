STATE OF THE ASSOCIATION
20 MAY 1999
(PAID ADVERTISEMENT)
The following is the text of the farewell
address of the Council of Presidents, as
delivered to the ASSU Senate on 20 May
1992 by John Over deck:
It's been a long year.
BACK FROM THE PLATFORM
This year's Students First Council of Presidents
followed in the footsteps of a series of politically
activist, unabashedly progressive student
administrations. These administrations had the
value of involving traditionally underrepresented
groups and bringing previously unheard views to
center stage. They spoke of the rights of minority
groups to self-determination. They spoke of needs
unmet by the status quo.
Yet, soon, they began to exploit the majority process
which they had criticized so vehemently. Student
government became the exclusive province of
radical politicians who used thousands of dollars to
support pet causes like progressive presidential
candidates. Before long, they had disenfranchised
not only the minority of conservatives who opposed
their ideas in full, but also a number of sympathetic
moderates who became tired of their student
government's single-minded focus on a divisive
form of multiculturalism.
This year, we have led the ASSU away from some of
its past excesses. No longer does the ASSU use
student money to bail its friends out of jail. No
longer does the ASSU issue pronouncements on
international affairs or take sides in national labor
disputes. No longer does the COP use its position to
press for an agenda in the national media. To do so
would insult Stanford students who are far more
qualified than we to speak on these issues.
This change in COP behavior obviously doesn't
inhibit student activism. A vivid example of this
was the recent Rodney King protest. Nobody
needed the COP to speak for them on national
issues. But, by our not speaking, we avoided
misrepresenting the group of students who do not
wish to have their resources directed in these
political ways.
In short, we have stopped some of the most visible
and alienating activity commonly performed by
COPs. But in so doing, we seem to have converted
a lot of the outrage at the ASSU's action into anger
at the ASSU's inaction.
RESUME PACKING
It has become quite in vogue to slam ASSU elected
officials. Arch-conservative John Abbott's recent
comments in the Review calling us "resume packers
and megalomaniacs" are typical.
Of course, you in the Senate know how valuable this
experience has been for resume purposes. Of
course, all of us have used our contacts to secure
high-paying multinational consultancies. YEAH
RIGHT! Here's the facts: no one on this year's COP
got any references out of this job, none of us harbor
any delusions of political or policy-oriented careers.
For our resumes, this rates a big zero. I must admit
it is the last line of my two-page c.v. (That's what
grads have -- c.v.'s). But who is going to hire a
statistics professor because of his political
involvement. At best, someone might forgive us for
not doing much real academic work this year.
As for the megalomaniac thing: Only a very sad
megalomaniac would seek to take over the ASSU.
Doubtless there is more raw power to be had
elsewhere. You could be the person who assigns
Buffy and Muffy as frosh roommates. You could
infiltrate the Daily and censor the articles to fit your
world view as some editors have.
No...the reason to become involved is the chance to
deal with intelligent grown-ups in a real-life setting,
the chance to help Stanford, and the pride one can
take in a job well done.
STUDENT ADVOCACY
Our biggest successes this year have been in terms
of getting student concerns heard and addressed.
This fall, Stanford returned to a campus stricken
with budget crises. We succeeded in placing
students on most of these committees. In so doing,
undoubtedly many disasters were avoided before
they happened.
We were able to take a leadership role in protecting
vital Dean of Student programs, including the
community centers, by taking large cuts in the ASSU
budget. In the last 13 months, the ASSU budget has
been cut 30%. Most elected student salaries have
been reduced 40%. At the same time, non
refundable fees have been reduced from $7 per
student annually to 23 cents. No longer is the ASSU
soaking the students just to stash money in its slush
funds. Although we still have over $1.5 million net
holdings, the cycle of tax and save is broken.
We hosted open forums which led to saving UAC
programs, saving cooks for the row, and protecting
drama for undergraduates.
Graduate issues received nearly equal time for the
first time in recent Stanford history. The University
has already responded by returning Manzanita Park
to graduate students. But much more is to be done.
We successfully fought for University continuation
of the Sexual Assault Prevention Education and
Response efforts. Unfortunately, the Directory deal
has fallen through in the turmoil of the election.
Even when we were thwarted by issues, the
University heard student concerns and made some
concessions to students. For example, though we
will endure a tuition increase, financial aid was
protected and the planned health-fee was scrapped.
Also, we have set a foundation for the case of the
reduced tuition increase in future years.
STUDENT SERVICES
Unfortunately, we have not had as much success in
fighting for student services as we would have liked.
What successes we had came relatively early in the
year with the hiring of the Sexual Assault Officer and
the starting of Friday Classics.
For some reason still not entirely clear to me, the
Senate placed the ASSU laserprinting service in the
Storke Bldg where roughly no one uses it.
The major feature of the Course Guide was that it
was produced so as to facilitate future expansion. It
now presumably won't be produced next year.
Our ASSU News adds in the Daily apparently did
not reach the desired target audience because people
just don't bother to read the Daily that closely.
The Aerobics business project is still not finalized and
the next Senate will have to start it up if it is
interested.
The First-Year Trips proposal is before you tonight
and I'll reserve comment on that for the debate.
Improved campus lighting is sadly still a long way
off in this budget climate.
COMMUNITY RELATIONS
For many years on this campus, battle lines have
been drawn between various groups: blacks and
conservatives, fraternities and feminists. Before last
year, student government did little to heal wounds,
while often pouring salt on them from atop their
soapbox. At times the hate became so engrossing, the
tension so stifling, that Stanford's diversity which we
prize so dearly seemed to be more of a handicap than
a blessing. Groups formed, splintered, warred, while
many students just watched bitterly, afraid to speak
their minds. Although people are reluctant to
acknowledge the cost of anger, it was felt plainly at
countless dinner tables where people no longer
shared their perspectives or took advantage of others'
experiences, but rather seethed with mistrust. People
of many groups even suggested it might be better to
have a white Stanford, a black Stanford, an Asian
Stanford, a gay Stanford, and so on.
While it might be easier to segregate, this cannot be
the answer. The implications to society as a whole
are too damning.
Stanford must come together. Our modest efforts in
this direction included hosting two leadership
summits this year with the hope of increasing
partnership between people with shared interests
and increasing communication between those of
divergent interests. Also, we met with community
leaders to discuss University issues as they related to
their communities. We also eschewed opportunities
to use the office as platform for national media
exposure, choosing to replace the atmosphere of
pressure politics with collegiality. We hope that in
these little ways we have fostered a slightly more
sharing environment between different communities.
We are glad to report that, in places, shouting has
given way to dialogue, enmity has given way to
amity.
Still we must not delude ourselves. Bigotry and
intolerance still persist at Stanford, and it will take a
great many years to overcome them, even at such a
place as Stanford.
It is a mistake to think of the ongoing process of
coming together as a fight. I thank Derek Miyahara
for the following insight. I think the standard advice
of the marriage counselor is apt. To have a happy
marriage, each person must feel they are doing more
than their share because one never fully appreciates
the work of others. Instead of fighting, let's each try
to give a little more.
A UNION DIVIDING
As I stand here giving the last State of Association
speech for a while, I can't help but think of a bitter
Gorbachev who so reluctantly gave the reins to the
agents of radical reform, agents who were set to
smash the whole into parts, agents who gave up on
the system.
How surprised and disappointed he was to see that
times had passed him by. Rather than leading the
restructuring of the broken system he oversaw its
dismantling at the hands of a bombastic drunkard
who didn't see value in the Union. Some still see
Gorbachev as heroic, but most of his countrymen see
him as pedantic and weak. Respected by neither the
communists nor the reformers, he will have to hope
for the pens of historians to return to him a modicum
of respect in his homeland.
The analogy is not perfect: I certainly would not
want to imply that Mr. Mun et al. are drunkards.
1 have not given up on our Union. I think it can
provide and does provide valuable and needed
representation for students.
But we stand at a crossroads. Not only do we lack a
COP, but students are moving to set up other
associations to take its place: graduate student
associations, progressive alliances. I still have hope
that the Association will not divide into graduates
and undergradutes, progressives and pragmatists, or
worse become the University's scapegoat for why it
is unresponsive.
COMMON GROUND
Whoever takes over in the current vacuum will have
to realize the tenuous position of the whole
organization. Unless common ground is found, the
ASSU is doomed to splinter. This would be
especially damaging at such a critical time for
Stanford. As the University changes Presidents and
Provosts, nothing is assured. As at so many
universities, there could be graduate student unions,
progressive student unions, and basically no student
input in the university at all. At Stanford, we have
always had it pretty good. Through the committee
process, more often than not, even though not all
students are polled, some reasonable version of
student opinion is conveyed to relevant decision
makers. This committee process works not through
the good grace of the university, but rather because
there are student watchdogs who try make sure
there are students where there should be.
One year from today, the ASSU will exist in its
current form only if it has found some common
ground. In order to see this common ground,
senators must work together with two things in
mind:
1) Senators must factor the value of their association
with others into their own self and constituent
interests when they evaluate a proposal. That is,
they should realize that if they want an Association,
not every line will be in their immediate self interest.
2) Senators must not push their own agenda to the
detriment of the whole.
Examples of the common ground this year include:
• Successful lobbying against a health fee and a
lowering of financial aid self-help requirement.
• Hiring a Sexual Assault Prevention Education and
Response Coordinator
1 hope that the Senate will see a similar shared value
in the First-Year Trips proposal before the Senate
tonight.
But there other even clearer issues. Let me outline
five issues which I think the students can unite
behind and I think could give reason for the ASSU to
exist next year as a representative body.
1. Let's take back Graduation
Every year, the Commencement speaker is
nominally chosen by the students and, every year,
the speaker is less prominent than the last. How can
this be?
Well, here's the process. Early in the year, the Senior
class presidents are asked to give list of ten speakers
they would like for graduation from the list of
possiblities. Then the University picks.
That's a little bit like: choose your 10 favorite
presidential candidates and we'll pick the final 1.
In the end, the graduation speaker becomes a
University political football. This year, to appease
the Art faculty and alumni concerned about
Stanford's commitment to art, we have as our
speaker Kirk Varnedoe, some one I, the captain of
the West All-Star College Bowl team, had never ever
heard of. While I concede notoriety isn't the be-all
and end-all of these things, it sure helps,.
Wasn't it the Stanford admissions materials that said
in response to "Which is better, a B in an AP course
or an A in a normal course?" that "Normally,
Stanford students are the ones that get A's in AP
courses." Applying that philosophy here, if we need
to satisfy certain political objectives, we ought to be
able to do so without choosing such a weak speaker.
If the administration knew or cared what a disgrace
its annual selection is to the 20,000 attendees, maybe
it would shape up.
In any case, the Senate should take the lead by
demanding that the Senior Class's preferences are
respected before yet another class leaves with a
whimper not a bang and yet another group of
parents are left wondering whether Stanford was
really $60,000 better than Cal.
2. Let's take back Tresidder.
Tresidder is a student union. NOT!
Ten years ago, we had a bowling alley down
underneath the computer Lair. That was replaced by
a computer center, still not too bad. But for the last 3
years, that 10,000 square feet has been off-limits to
students and more than half-vacant.
One of the best things we could do to promote better
campus social interaction is to develop that space
into some place students would want to be. The
irony of this is that this could be done and Stanford
could even make a profit.
Yet Stanford has sat waiting for three years, waiting
for money to build up in the bank, waiting for the
Bookstore, waiting for blueprints. No developer
develops this way. The student government should
make one its foremost priorities to push for
University leadership in developing that space. We
must seize the opportunities that a change in
University leadership provides in terms of new ideas
and new approaches. Unless we get serious
involvement from the Vice President for Student
Resources or the President or Provost's Office, that
space may never be developed for student use. But
if we get some support, there could be a night club
and some shops down there in a few months.
3. New buildings should be accessible.
Because of its low-rise, modern construction and
bicycle-oriented design, Stanford turns out to be one
of the most disabled-accessible major universities.
Stanford also has made laudable efforts to provide
necessary academic services for its disabled
students.
Sadly, Stanford's commitment is only half-baked.
Stanford has been greatly remiss in its recent
construction. Stanford has not provided access
above the ground floor in any of its new or planned
dormitories. This lack of follow-through is not only
a gross inconvenience for affected students, but also
is offensive to those of us who think that there is a
rights-issue here as well as a practical one.
But, if this is not enough to convince you, then let
me give an economic argument. Remember that a
federal law was recently enacted requiring access in
public places wherever economically feasible.
Elevators cost relatively little if designed into a
building, but cost scads of money if they have to be
retrofitted into a building. If Stanford is required to
retrofit elevators into new buildings from which they
were negligently omitted, it would be an expensive
mistake indeed. Equally sad would be if we wasted
money in court fighting these challenges.
We ought to pressure Stanford, the great inertial
mass, to wake up on this and similar issues.
4. Graduate Student Bill of Rights: Full Disclosure
For many graduate students, the University is our
sole employer, landlord, school, and health-care
provider. Over the last several years, the University
has been running roughshod over our lives, eroding
one at a time the basic privileges afforded graduate
students.
When the government began to tax stipends, the
university did not include tax as a legitimate expense.
As teaching and course requirements increased, the
length of time given to finish remained the same.
While foreign students were banned from working
off-campus, summer support was reduced. When
200 extra students are admitted annually, only 90
new housing spots are provided. It has already
gotten to the point that graduate students unable to
afford off-campus housing camp in the hills, live in
their offices, sleep in eating-house lofts, or stay in
their cars at the beginning of the school year until
they get off the wait list.
Major new cuts are planned for next year's incoming
class. Where will it end?
Ideally, all Ph.D. students would receive support for
as long as they were making progress towards a
degree. We could try to claim this as our moral right.
However, money doesn't grow on trees and funding
has to come from somewhere.
Instead, let me suggest that real problem here is that
graduate students feel betrayed. Why? Our letters of
admission suggested that we'd be happy campers,
well-fed and clothed, for the duration of our study
(or at least most of it). You know what, in a lot of
cases, it has turned out to be the big lie. People end
up taking big loans or, worse, leaving because they
are broke. People ended up regretting the decisions
they made under the scandalously rosy scenarios
painted by their offers.
This must stop. If we can't demand support, we can
at least demand fairness and honesty. So here is our
Bill of Rights which we ask the Faculty Senate and
President to enact before Stanford admits another
graduate class:
1) FULL DISCLOSURE. Graduate offers of
admission must include the following information:
Length of support if any, conditions of support,
amount of support, expected annual expenses
(including taxes) both off-campus and on, expected
time to degree, likelihood that the admittee complete
their degree, and availability of housing of various
types. The facts included in these letters must be
independently reviewed by a body of graduate
students on a regular basis.
2) TRUTH-IN-ADVERTISING: Graduate offers of
admission should be binding contracts.
If the University were to admit the truth in this way,
hopefully schools and deparments would be forced
to provide more reasonable offers of support. But
even if the offers aren't changed, at least people
would stop making major life decisions that they
wouldn't have made had they known the truth.
5. Public Meetings with the President
Since a COP will not be meeting with President
Casper, there will be an extra free hour on his
calendar. This provides a real opportunity to
increase communication with the University. The
Senate should immediately seek a series of quarterly
town meetings with the President where all students
can ask questions about administration policy. This
direct contact would provide an invaluable channel
for students to say what they feel works and what
they feel doesn't. Having such opportunities would
increase free exchange and reduce the kind of
alienation felt by students who don't think they can
play an active role in their own University.
GET INVOLVED. STAY INVOLVED.
Finally, on behalf of the COP, I would like to thank
those of you here in the Senate for your effort to
make Stanford a better place for students. I'd
especially like to thank those of you who took the
time to go out and bring new issues and ideas back to
the Senate. I'd like thank all of those who came to
Town Meetings, sat on committees, and ran our
Businesses and Services.
In some sense, it would be easy for us all to leave the
ASSU and not look back, saying that we've done our
time. Many of us in some sense would like to see the
COP-less ASSU fail as a vindication of our beliefs.
But I hope the spirit that brought us to work for
Stanford this year still burns in each of us and that
each of us will take focus some of our energies into
making the ASSU a strong voice for the students in
the future.
I would encourage all students to get involved,
because no matter how appears from the outside,
taking an active role on campus issues is rewarding,
interesting, and stimulating. Though I wouldn't
want to be COP again, it was a fine thing to do once,
and I think I learned a lot.

Every year, the Commencement speaker is

Well, here's the process. Early in the year, the Senior

That's a little bit like: choose your 10 favorite
presidential candidates and we'll pick the final 1.
In the end, the graduation speaker becomes a
University political football. This year, to appease
the Art faculty and alumni concerned about
Stanford's commitment to art, we have as our
speaker Kirk Varnedoe, some one I, the captain of
the West All-Star College Bowl team, had never ever
heard of. While I concede notoriety isn't the be-all
and end-all of these things, it sure helps,.
Wasn't it the Stanford admissions materials that said
in response to "Which is better, a B in an AP course
or an A in a normal course?" that "Normally,
Stanford students are the ones that get A's in AP
courses." Applying that philosophy here, if we need
to satisfy certain political objectives, we ought to be
able to do so without choosing such a weak speaker.
If the administration knew or cared what a disgrace
its annual selection is to the 20,000 attendees, maybe
it would shape up.
In any case, the Senate should take the lead by
demanding that the Senior Class's preferences are
respected before yet another class leaves with a
whimper not a bang and yet another group of
parents are left wondering whether Stanford was
really $60,000 better than Cal.
2. Let's take back Tresidder.
Tresidder is a student union. NOT!
Ten years ago, we had a bowling alley down
underneath the computer Lair. That was replaced by
a computer center, still not too bad. But for the last 3
years, that 10,000 square feet has been off-limits to
students and more than half-vacant.
One of the best things we could do to promote better
campus social interaction is to develop that space
into some place students would want to be. The
irony of this is that this could be done and Stanford
could even make a profit.
Yet Stanford has sat waiting for three years, waiting
for money to build up in the bank, waiting for the
Bookstore, waiting for blueprints. No developer
develops this way. The student government should
make one its foremost priorities to push for
University leadership in developing that space. We
must seize the opportunities that a change in
University leadership provides in terms of new ideas
and new approaches. Unless we get serious
involvement from the Vice President for Student
Resources or the President or Provost's Office, that
space may never be developed for student use. But
if we get some support, there could be a night club
and some shops down there in a few months.
3. New buildings should be accessible.
Because of its low-rise, modern construction and
bicycle-oriented design, Stanford turns out to be one
of the most disabled-accessible major universities.
Stanford also has made laudable efforts to provide
necessary academic services for its disabled
students.
Sadly, Stanford's commitment is only half-baked.
Stanford has been greatly remiss in its recent
construction. Stanford has not provided access
above the ground floor in any of its new or planned
dormitories. This lack of follow-through is not only
a gross inconvenience for affected students, but also
is offensive to those of us who think that there is a
rights-issue here as well as a practical one.
But, if this is not enough to convince you, then let
me give an economic argument. Remember that a
federal law was recently enacted requiring access in
public places wherever economically feasible.
Elevators cost relatively little if designed into a
building, but cost scads of money if they have to be
retrofitted into a building. If Stanford is required to
retrofit elevators into new buildings from which they
were negligently omitted, it would be an expensive
mistake indeed. Equally sad would be if we wasted
money in court fighting these challenges.
We ought to pressure Stanford, the great inertial
mass, to wake up on this and similar issues.
4. Graduate Student Bill of Rights: Full Disclosure
For many graduate students, the University is our
sole employer, landlord, school, and health-care
provider. Over the last several years, the University
has been running roughshod over our lives, eroding
one at a time the basic privileges afforded graduate
students.
When the government began to tax stipends, the
university did not include tax as a legitimate expense.
As teaching and course requirements increased, the
length of time given to finish remained the same.
While foreign students were banned from working
off-campus, summer support was reduced. When
200 extra students are admitted annually, only 90
new housing spots are provided. It has already
gotten to the point that graduate students unable to
afford off-campus housing camp in the hills, live in
their offices, sleep in eating-house lofts, or stay in
their cars at the beginning of the school year until
they get off the wait list.
Major new cuts are planned for next year's incoming
class. Where will it end?
Ideally, all Ph.D. students would receive support for
as long as they were making progress towards a
degree. We could try to claim this as our moral right.
However, money doesn't grow on trees and funding
has to come from somewhere.
Instead, let me suggest that real problem here is that
graduate students feel betrayed. Why? Our letters of
admission suggested that we'd be happy campers,
well-fed and clothed, for the duration of our study
(or at least most of it). You know what, in a lot of
cases, it has turned out to be the big lie. People end
up taking big loans or, worse, leaving because they
are broke. People ended up regretting the decisions
they made under the scandalously rosy scenarios
painted by their offers.
This must stop. If we can't demand support, we can
at least demand fairness and honesty. So here is our
Bill of Rights which we ask the Faculty Senate and
President to enact before Stanford admits another
graduate class:
1) FULL DISCLOSURE. Graduate offers of
admission must include the following information:
Length of support if any, conditions of support,
amount of support, expected annual expenses
(including taxes) both off-campus and on, expected
time to degree, likelihood that the admittee complete
their degree, and availability of housing of various
types. The facts included in these letters must be
independently reviewed by a body of graduate
students on a regular basis.
2) TRUTH-IN-ADVERTISING: Graduate offers of
admission should be binding contracts.
If the University were to admit the truth in this way,
hopefully schools and deparments would be forced
to provide more reasonable offers of support. But
even if the offers aren't changed, at least people
would stop making major life decisions that they
wouldn't have made had they known the truth.
5. Public Meetings with the President
Since a COP will not be meeting with President
Casper, there will be an extra free hour on his
calendar. This provides a real opportunity to
increase communication with the University. The
Senate should immediately seek a series of quarterly
town meetings with the President where all students
can ask questions about administration policy. This
direct contact would provide an invaluable channel
for students to say what they feel works and what
they feel doesn't. Having such opportunities would
increase free exchange and reduce the kind of
alienation felt by students who don't think they can
play an active role in their own University.
GET INVOLVED. STAY INVOLVED.
Finally, on behalf of the COP, I would like to thank
those of you here in the Senate for your effort to
make Stanford a better place for students. I'd
especially like to thank those of you who took the
time to go out and bring new issues and ideas back to
the Senate. I'd like thank all of those who came to
Town Meetings, sat on committees, and ran our
Businesses and Services.
In some sense, it would be easy for us all to leave the
ASSU and not look back, saying that we've done our
time. Many of us in some sense would like to see the
COP-less ASSU fail as a vindication of our beliefs.
But I hope the spirit that brought us to work for
Stanford this year still burns in each of us and that
each of us will take focus some of our energies into
making the ASSU a strong voice for the students in
the future.
I would encourage all students to get involved,
because no matter how appears from the outside,
taking an active role on campus issues is rewarding,
interesting, and stimulating. Though I wouldn't
want to be COP again, it was a fine thing to do once,
and I think I learned a lot.

STATE OF THE ASSOCIATION
20 MAY 1999
(PAID ADVERTISEMENT)
The following is the text of the farewell
address of the Council of Presidents, as
delivered to the ASSU Senate on 20 May
1992 by John Over deck:
It's been a long year.
BACK FROM THE PLATFORM
This year's Students First Council of Presidents
followed in the footsteps of a series of politically
activist, unabashedly progressive student
administrations. These administrations had the
value of involving traditionally underrepresented
groups and bringing previously unheard views to
center stage. They spoke of the rights of minority
groups to self-determination. They spoke of needs
unmet by the status quo.
Yet, soon, they began to exploit the majority process
which they had criticized so vehemently. Student
government became the exclusive province of
radical politicians who used thousands of dollars to
support pet causes like progressive presidential
candidates. Before long, they had disenfranchised
not only the minority of conservatives who opposed
their ideas in full, but also a number of sympathetic
moderates who became tired of their student
government's single-minded focus on a divisive
form of multiculturalism.
This year, we have led the ASSU away from some of
its past excesses. No longer does the ASSU use
student money to bail its friends out of jail. No
longer does the ASSU issue pronouncements on
international affairs or take sides in national labor
disputes. No longer does the COP use its position to
press for an agenda in the national media. To do so
would insult Stanford students who are far more
qualified than we to speak on these issues.
This change in COP behavior obviously doesn't
inhibit student activism. A vivid example of this
was the recent Rodney King protest. Nobody
needed the COP to speak for them on national
issues. But, by our not speaking, we avoided
misrepresenting the group of students who do not
wish to have their resources directed in these
political ways.
In short, we have stopped some of the most visible
and alienating activity commonly performed by
COPs. But in so doing, we seem to have converted
a lot of the outrage at the ASSU's action into anger
at the ASSU's inaction.
RESUME PACKING
It has become quite in vogue to slam ASSU elected
officials. Arch-conservative John Abbott's recent
comments in the Review calling us "resume packers
and megalomaniacs" are typical.
Of course, you in the Senate know how valuable this
experience has been for resume purposes. Of
course, all of us have used our contacts to secure
high-paying multinational consultancies. YEAH
RIGHT! Here's the facts: no one on this year's COP
got any references out of this job, none of us harbor
any delusions of political or policy-oriented careers.
For our resumes, this rates a big zero. I must admit
it is the last line of my two-page c.v. (That's what
grads have -- c.v.'s). But who is going to hire a
statistics professor because of his political
involvement. At best, someone might forgive us for
not doing much real academic work this year.
As for the megalomaniac thing: Only a very sad
megalomaniac would seek to take over the ASSU.
Doubtless there is more raw power to be had
elsewhere. You could be the person who assigns
Buffy and Muffy as frosh roommates. You could
infiltrate the Daily and censor the articles to fit your
world view as some editors have.
No...the reason to become involved is the chance to
deal with intelligent grown-ups in a real-life setting,
the chance to help Stanford, and the pride one can
take in a job well done.
STUDENT ADVOCACY
Our biggest successes this year have been in terms
of getting student concerns heard and addressed.
This fall, Stanford returned to a campus stricken
with budget crises. We succeeded in placing
students on most of these committees. In so doing,
undoubtedly many disasters were avoided before
they happened.
We were able to take a leadership role in protecting
vital Dean of Student programs, including the
community centers, by taking large cuts in the ASSU
budget. In the last 13 months, the ASSU budget has
been cut 30%. Most elected student salaries have
been reduced 40%. At the same time, non
refundable fees have been reduced from $7 per
student annually to 23 cents. No longer is the ASSU
soaking the students just to stash money in its slush
funds. Although we still have over $1.5 million net
holdings, the cycle of tax and save is broken.
We hosted open forums which led to saving UAC
programs, saving cooks for the row, and protecting
drama for undergraduates.
Graduate issues received nearly equal time for the
first time in recent Stanford history. The University
has already responded by returning Manzanita Park
to graduate students. But much more is to be done.
We successfully fought for University continuation
of the Sexual Assault Prevention Education and
Response efforts. Unfortunately, the Directory deal
has fallen through in the turmoil of the election.
Even when we were thwarted by issues, the
University heard student concerns and made some
concessions to students. For example, though we
will endure a tuition increase, financial aid was
protected and the planned health-fee was scrapped.
Also, we have set a foundation for the case of the
reduced tuition increase in future years.
STUDENT SERVICES
Unfortunately, we have not had as much success in
fighting for student services as we would have liked.
What successes we had came relatively early in the
year with the hiring of the Sexual Assault Officer and
the starting of Friday Classics.
For some reason still not entirely clear to me, the
Senate placed the ASSU laserprinting service in the
Storke Bldg where roughly no one uses it.
The major feature of the Course Guide was that it
was produced so as to facilitate future expansion. It
now presumably won't be produced next year.
Our ASSU News adds in the Daily apparently did
not reach the desired target audience because people
just don't bother to read the Daily that closely.
The Aerobics business project is still not finalized and
the next Senate will have to start it up if it is
interested.
The First-Year Trips proposal is before you tonight
and I'll reserve comment on that for the debate.
Improved campus lighting is sadly still a long way
off in this budget climate.
COMMUNITY RELATIONS
For many years on this campus, battle lines have
been drawn between various groups: blacks and
conservatives, fraternities and feminists. Before last
year, student government did little to heal wounds,
while often pouring salt on them from atop their
soapbox. At times the hate became so engrossing, the
tension so stifling, that Stanford's diversity which we
prize so dearly seemed to be more of a handicap than
a blessing. Groups formed, splintered, warred, while
many students just watched bitterly, afraid to speak
their minds. Although people are reluctant to
acknowledge the cost of anger, it was felt plainly at
countless dinner tables where people no longer
shared their perspectives or took advantage of others'
experiences, but rather seethed with mistrust. People
of many groups even suggested it might be better to
have a white Stanford, a black Stanford, an Asian
Stanford, a gay Stanford, and so on.
While it might be easier to segregate, this cannot be
the answer. The implications to society as a whole
are too damning.
Stanford must come together. Our modest efforts in
this direction included hosting two leadership
summits this year with the hope of increasing
partnership between people with shared interests
and increasing communication between those of
divergent interests. Also, we met with community
leaders to discuss University issues as they related to
their communities. We also eschewed opportunities
to use the office as platform for national media
exposure, choosing to replace the atmosphere of
pressure politics with collegiality. We hope that in
these little ways we have fostered a slightly more
sharing environment between different communities.
We are glad to report that, in places, shouting has
given way to dialogue, enmity has given way to
amity.
Still we must not delude ourselves. Bigotry and
intolerance still persist at Stanford, and it will take a
great many years to overcome them, even at such a
place as Stanford.
It is a mistake to think of the ongoing process of
coming together as a fight. I thank Derek Miyahara
for the following insight. I think the standard advice
of the marriage counselor is apt. To have a happy
marriage, each person must feel they are doing more
than their share because one never fully appreciates
the work of others. Instead of fighting, let's each try
to give a little more.
A UNION DIVIDING
As I stand here giving the last State of Association
speech for a while, I can't help but think of a bitter
Gorbachev who so reluctantly gave the reins to the
agents of radical reform, agents who were set to
smash the whole into parts, agents who gave up on
the system.
How surprised and disappointed he was to see that
times had passed him by. Rather than leading the
restructuring of the broken system he oversaw its
dismantling at the hands of a bombastic drunkard
who didn't see value in the Union. Some still see
Gorbachev as heroic, but most of his countrymen see
him as pedantic and weak. Respected by neither the
communists nor the reformers, he will have to hope
for the pens of historians to return to him a modicum
of respect in his homeland.
The analogy is not perfect: I certainly would not
want to imply that Mr. Mun et al. are drunkards.
1 have not given up on our Union. I think it can
provide and does provide valuable and needed
representation for students.
But we stand at a crossroads. Not only do we lack a
COP, but students are moving to set up other
associations to take its place: graduate student
associations, progressive alliances. I still have hope
that the Association will not divide into graduates
and undergradutes, progressives and pragmatists, or
worse become the University's scapegoat for why it
is unresponsive.
COMMON GROUND
Whoever takes over in the current vacuum will have
to realize the tenuous position of the whole
organization. Unless common ground is found, the
ASSU is doomed to splinter. This would be
especially damaging at such a critical time for
Stanford. As the University changes Presidents and
Provosts, nothing is assured. As at so many
universities, there could be graduate student unions,
progressive student unions, and basically no student
input in the university at all. At Stanford, we have
always had it pretty good. Through the committee
process, more often than not, even though not all
students are polled, some reasonable version of
student opinion is conveyed to relevant decision
makers. This committee process works not through
the good grace of the university, but rather because
there are student watchdogs who try make sure
there are students where there should be.
One year from today, the ASSU will exist in its
current form only if it has found some common
ground. In order to see this common ground,
senators must work together with two things in
mind:
1) Senators must factor the value of their association
with others into their own self and constituent
interests when they evaluate a proposal. That is,
they should realize that if they want an Association,
not every line will be in their immediate self interest.
2) Senators must not push their own agenda to the
detriment of the whole.
Examples of the common ground this year include:
• Successful lobbying against a health fee and a
lowering of financial aid self-help requirement.
• Hiring a Sexual Assault Prevention Education and
Response Coordinator
1 hope that the Senate will see a similar shared value
in the First-Year Trips proposal before the Senate
tonight.
But there other even clearer issues. Let me outline
five issues which I think the students can unite
behind and I think could give reason for the ASSU to
exist next year as a representative body.
1. Let's take back Graduation
Every year, the Commencement speaker is
nominally chosen by the students and, every year,
the speaker is less prominent than the last. How can
this be?
Well, here's the process. Early in the year, the Senior
class presidents are asked to give list of ten speakers
they would like for graduation from the list of
possiblities. Then the University picks.
That's a little bit like: choose your 10 favorite
presidential candidates and we'll pick the final 1.
In the end, the graduation speaker becomes a
University political football. This year, to appease
the Art faculty and alumni concerned about
Stanford's commitment to art, we have as our
speaker Kirk Varnedoe, some one I, the captain of
the West All-Star College Bowl team, had never ever
heard of. While I concede notoriety isn't the be-all

to satisfy certain political objectives, we ought to be
able to do so without choosing such a weak speaker.
If the administration knew or cared what a disgrace
its annual selection is to the 20,000 attendees, maybe
it would shape up.
In any case, the Senate should take the lead by
demanding that the Senior Class's preferences are
respected before yet another class leaves with a
whimper not a bang and yet another group of
parents are left wondering whether Stanford was
really $60,000 better than Cal.

STUDENT ADVOCACY
Our biggest successes this year have been in terms
of getting student concerns heard and addressed.
This fall, Stanford returned to a campus stricken
with budget crises. We succeeded in placing
students on most of these committees. In so doing,
undoubtedly many disasters were avoided before
they happened.
We were able to take a leadership role in protecting
vital Dean of Student programs, including the
community centers, by taking large cuts in the ASSU
budget. In the last 13 months, the ASSU budget has
been cut 30%. Most elected student salaries have
been reduced 40%. At the same time, non
refundable fees have been reduced from $7 per
student annually to 23 cents. No longer is the ASSU
soaking the students just to stash money in its slush
funds. Although we still have over $1.5 million net
holdings, the cycle of tax and save is broken.
We hosted open forums which led to saving UAC
programs, saving cooks for the row, and protecting
drama for undergraduates.
Graduate issues received nearly equal time for the
first time in recent Stanford history. The University
has already responded by returning Manzanita Park
to graduate students. But much more is to be done.
We successfully fought for University continuation
of the Sexual Assault Prevention Education and
Response efforts. Unfortunately, the Directory deal
has fallen through in the turmoil of the election.
Even when we were thwarted by issues, the
University heard student concerns and made some
concessions to students. For example, though we
will endure a tuition increase, financial aid was
protected and the planned health-fee was scrapped.
Also, we have set a foundation for the case of the
reduced tuition increase in future years.
STUDENT SERVICES
Unfortunately, we have not had as much success in
fighting for student services as we would have liked.
What successes we had came relatively early in the
year with the hiring of the Sexual Assault Officer and
the starting of Friday Classics.
For some reason still not entirely clear to me, the
Senate placed the ASSU laserprinting service in the
Storke Bldg where roughly no one uses it.
The major feature of the Course Guide was that it
was produced so as to facilitate future expansion. It
now presumably won't be produced next year.
Our ASSU News adds in the Daily apparently did
not reach the desired target audience because people
just don't bother to read the Daily that closely.
The Aerobics business project is still not finalized and
the next Senate will have to start it up if it is
interested.
The First-Year Trips proposal is before you tonight
and I'll reserve comment on that for the debate.
Improved campus lighting is sadly still a long way
off in this budget climate.
COMMUNITY RELATIONS
For many years on this campus, battle lines have
been drawn between various groups: blacks and
conservatives, fraternities and feminists. Before last
year, student government did little to heal wounds,
while often pouring salt on them from atop their
soapbox. At times the hate became so engrossing, the
tension so stifling, that Stanford's diversity which we
prize so dearly seemed to be more of a handicap than
a blessing. Groups formed, splintered, warred, while
many students just watched bitterly, afraid to speak
their minds. Although people are reluctant to
acknowledge the cost of anger, it was felt plainly at
countless dinner tables where people no longer
shared their perspectives or took advantage of others'
experiences, but rather seethed with mistrust. People
of many groups even suggested it might be better to
have a white Stanford, a black Stanford, an Asian
Stanford, a gay Stanford, and so on.
While it might be easier to segregate, this cannot be
the answer. The implications to society as a whole
are too damning.
Stanford must come together. Our modest efforts in
this direction included hosting two leadership
summits this year with the hope of increasing
partnership between people with shared interests
and increasing communication between those of
divergent interests. Also, we met with community
leaders to discuss University issues as they related to
their communities. We also eschewed opportunities
to use the office as platform for national media
exposure, choosing to replace the atmosphere of
pressure politics with collegiality. We hope that in
these little ways we have fostered a slightly more
sharing environment between different communities.
We are glad to report that, in places, shouting has
given way to dialogue, enmity has given way to
amity.
Still we must not delude ourselves. Bigotry and
intolerance still persist at Stanford, and it will take a
great many years to overcome them, even at such a
place as Stanford.
It is a mistake to think of the ongoing process of
coming together as a fight. I thank Derek Miyahara
for the following insight. I think the standard advice
of the marriage counselor is apt. To have a happy
marriage, each person must feel they are doing more
than their share because one never fully appreciates
the work of others. Instead of fighting, let's each try
to give a little more.
A UNION DIVIDING
As I stand here giving the last State of Association
speech for a while, I can't help but think of a bitter
Gorbachev who so reluctantly gave the reins to the
agents of radical reform, agents who were set to
smash the whole into parts, agents who gave up on
the system.
How surprised and disappointed he was to see that
times had passed him by. Rather than leading the
restructuring of the broken system he oversaw its
dismantling at the hands of a bombastic drunkard
who didn't see value in the Union. Some still see
Gorbachev as heroic, but most of his countrymen see
him as pedantic and weak. Respected by neither the
communists nor the reformers, he will have to hope
for the pens of historians to return to him a modicum
of respect in his homeland.
The analogy is not perfect: I certainly would not
want to imply that Mr. Mun et al. are drunkards.
1 have not given up on our Union. I think it can
provide and does provide valuable and needed
representation for students.
But we stand at a crossroads. Not only do we lack a
COP, but students are moving to set up other
associations to take its place: graduate student
associations, progressive alliances. I still have hope
that the Association will not divide into graduates
and undergradutes, progressives and pragmatists, or
worse become the University's scapegoat for why it
is unresponsive.
COMMON GROUND
Whoever takes over in the current vacuum will have
to realize the tenuous position of the whole
organization. Unless common ground is found, the
ASSU is doomed to splinter. This would be
especially damaging at such a critical time for
Stanford. As the University changes Presidents and
Provosts, nothing is assured. As at so many
universities, there could be graduate student unions,
progressive student unions, and basically no student
input in the university at all. At Stanford, we have
always had it pretty good. Through the committee
process, more often than not, even though not all
students are polled, some reasonable version of
student opinion is conveyed to relevant decision
makers. This committee process works not through
the good grace of the university, but rather because
there are student watchdogs who try make sure
there are students where there should be.
One year from today, the ASSU will exist in its
current form only if it has found some common
ground. In order to see this common ground,
senators must work together with two things in
mind:
1) Senators must factor the value of their association
with others into their own self and constituent
interests when they evaluate a proposal. That is,
they should realize that if they want an Association,
not every line will be in their immediate self interest.
2) Senators must not push their own agenda to the
detriment of the whole.
Examples of the common ground this year include:
• Successful lobbying against a health fee and a
lowering of financial aid self-help requirement.
• Hiring a Sexual Assault Prevention Education and
Response Coordinator
1 hope that the Senate will see a similar shared value
in the First-Year Trips proposal before the Senate
tonight.
But there other even clearer issues. Let me outline
five issues which I think the students can unite
behind and I think could give reason for the ASSU to
exist next year as a representative body.
1. Let's take back Graduation
Every year, the Commencement speaker is
nominally chosen by the students and, every year,
the speaker is less prominent than the last. How can
this be?
Well, here's the process. Early in the year, the Senior
class presidents are asked to give list of ten speakers
they would like for graduation from the list of
possiblities. Then the University picks.
That's a little bit like: choose your 10 favorite
presidential candidates and we'll pick the final 1.
In the end, the graduation speaker becomes a
University political football. This year, to appease
the Art faculty and alumni concerned about
Stanford's commitment to art, we have as our
speaker Kirk Varnedoe, some one I, the captain of
the West All-Star College Bowl team, had never ever
heard of. While I concede notoriety isn't the be-all
and end-all of these things, it sure helps,.
Wasn't it the Stanford admissions materials that said
in response to "Which is better, a B in an AP course
or an A in a normal course?" that "Normally,
Stanford students are the ones that get A's in AP
courses." Applying that philosophy here, if we need
to satisfy certain political objectives, we ought to be
able to do so without choosing such a weak speaker.
If the administration knew or cared what a disgrace
its annual selection is to the 20,000 attendees, maybe
it would shape up.
In any case, the Senate should take the lead by
demanding that the Senior Class's preferences are
respected before yet another class leaves with a
whimper not a bang and yet another group of
parents are left wondering whether Stanford was
really $60,000 better than Cal.
2. Let's take back Tresidder.
Tresidder is a student union. NOT!
Ten years ago, we had a bowling alley down
underneath the computer Lair. That was replaced by
a computer center, still not too bad. But for the last 3
years, that 10,000 square feet has been off-limits to
students and more than half-vacant.
One of the best things we could do to promote better
campus social interaction is to develop that space
into some place students would want to be. The
irony of this is that this could be done and Stanford
could even make a profit.
Yet Stanford has sat waiting for three years, waiting
for money to build up in the bank, waiting for the
Bookstore, waiting for blueprints. No developer
develops this way. The student government should
make one its foremost priorities to push for
University leadership in developing that space. We
must seize the opportunities that a change in
University leadership provides in terms of new ideas
and new approaches. Unless we get serious
involvement from the Vice President for Student
Resources or the President or Provost's Office, that
space may never be developed for student use. But
if we get some support, there could be a night club
and some shops down there in a few months.
3. New buildings should be accessible.
Because of its low-rise, modern construction and
bicycle-oriented design, Stanford turns out to be one
of the most disabled-accessible major universities.
Stanford also has made laudable efforts to provide
necessary academic services for its disabled
students.
Sadly, Stanford's commitment is only half-baked.
Stanford has been greatly remiss in its recent
construction. Stanford has not provided access
above the ground floor in any of its new or planned
dormitories. This lack of follow-through is not only
a gross inconvenience for affected students, but also
is offensive to those of us who think that there is a
rights-issue here as well as a practical one.
But, if this is not enough to convince you, then let
me give an economic argument. Remember that a
federal law was recently enacted requiring access in
public places wherever economically feasible.
Elevators cost relatively little if designed into a
building, but cost scads of money if they have to be
retrofitted into a building. If Stanford is required to
retrofit elevators into new buildings from which they
were negligently omitted, it would be an expensive
mistake indeed. Equally sad would be if we wasted
money in court fighting these challenges.
We ought to pressure Stanford, the great inertial
mass, to wake up on this and similar issues.
4. Graduate Student Bill of Rights: Full Disclosure
For many graduate students, the University is our
sole employer, landlord, school, and health-care
provider. Over the last several years, the University
has been running roughshod over our lives, eroding
one at a time the basic privileges afforded graduate
students.
When the government began to tax stipends, the
university did not include tax as a legitimate expense.
As teaching and course requirements increased, the
length of time given to finish remained the same.
While foreign students were banned from working
off-campus, summer support was reduced. When
200 extra students are admitted annually, only 90
new housing spots are provided. It has already
gotten to the point that graduate students unable to
afford off-campus housing camp in the hills, live in
their offices, sleep in eating-house lofts, or stay in
their cars at the beginning of the school year until
they get off the wait list.
Major new cuts are planned for next year's incoming
class. Where will it end?
Ideally, all Ph.D. students would receive support for
as long as they were making progress towards a
degree. We could try to claim this as our moral right.
However, money doesn't grow on trees and funding
has to come from somewhere.
Instead, let me suggest that real problem here is that
graduate students feel betrayed. Why? Our letters of
admission suggested that we'd be happy campers,
well-fed and clothed, for the duration of our study
(or at least most of it). You know what, in a lot of
cases, it has turned out to be the big lie. People end
up taking big loans or, worse, leaving because they
are broke. People ended up regretting the decisions
they made under the scandalously rosy scenarios
painted by their offers.
This must stop. If we can't demand support, we can
at least demand fairness and honesty. So here is our
Bill of Rights which we ask the Faculty Senate and
President to enact before Stanford admits another
graduate class:
1) FULL DISCLOSURE. Graduate offers of
admission must include the following information:
Length of support if any, conditions of support,
amount of support, expected annual expenses
(including taxes) both off-campus and on, expected
time to degree, likelihood that the admittee complete
their degree, and availability of housing of various
types. The facts included in these letters must be
independently reviewed by a body of graduate
students on a regular basis.
2) TRUTH-IN-ADVERTISING: Graduate offers of
admission should be binding contracts.
If the University were to admit the truth in this way,
hopefully schools and deparments would be forced
to provide more reasonable offers of support. But
even if the offers aren't changed, at least people
would stop making major life decisions that they
wouldn't have made had they known the truth.
5. Public Meetings with the President
Since a COP will not be meeting with President
Casper, there will be an extra free hour on his
calendar. This provides a real opportunity to
increase communication with the University. The
Senate should immediately seek a series of quarterly
town meetings with the President where all students
can ask questions about administration policy. This
direct contact would provide an invaluable channel
for students to say what they feel works and what
they feel doesn't. Having such opportunities would
increase free exchange and reduce the kind of
alienation felt by students who don't think they can
play an active role in their own University.
GET INVOLVED. STAY INVOLVED.
Finally, on behalf of the COP, I would like to thank
those of you here in the Senate for your effort to
make Stanford a better place for students. I'd
especially like to thank those of you who took the
time to go out and bring new issues and ideas back to
the Senate. I'd like thank all of those who came to
Town Meetings, sat on committees, and ran our
Businesses and Services.
In some sense, it would be easy for us all to leave the
ASSU and not look back, saying that we've done our
time. Many of us in some sense would like to see the
COP-less ASSU fail as a vindication of our beliefs.
But I hope the spirit that brought us to work for
Stanford this year still burns in each of us and that
each of us will take focus some of our energies into
making the ASSU a strong voice for the students in
the future.
I would encourage all students to get involved,
because no matter how appears from the outside,
taking an active role on campus issues is rewarding,
interesting, and stimulating. Though I wouldn't
want to be COP again, it was a fine thing to do once,
and I think I learned a lot.

STATE OF THE ASSOCIATION
20 MAY 1999
(PAID ADVERTISEMENT)
The following is the text of the farewell
address of the Council of Presidents, as
delivered to the ASSU Senate on 20 May
1992 by John Over deck:
It's been a long year.
BACK FROM THE PLATFORM
This year's Students First Council of Presidents
followed in the footsteps of a series of politically
activist, unabashedly progressive student
administrations. These administrations had the
value of involving traditionally underrepresented
groups and bringing previously unheard views to
center stage. They spoke of the rights of minority
groups to self-determination. They spoke of needs
unmet by the status quo.
Yet, soon, they began to exploit the majority process
which they had criticized so vehemently. Student
government became the exclusive province of
radical politicians who used thousands of dollars to
support pet causes like progressive presidential
candidates. Before long, they had disenfranchised
not only the minority of conservatives who opposed
their ideas in full, but also a number of sympathetic
moderates who became tired of their student
government's single-minded focus on a divisive
form of multiculturalism.
This year, we have led the ASSU away from some of
its past excesses. No longer does the ASSU use
student money to bail its friends out of jail. No
longer does the ASSU issue pronouncements on
international affairs or take sides in national labor
disputes. No longer does the COP use its position to
press for an agenda in the national media. To do so
would insult Stanford students who are far more
qualified than we to speak on these issues.
This change in COP behavior obviously doesn't
inhibit student activism. A vivid example of this
was the recent Rodney King protest. Nobody
needed the COP to speak for them on national
issues. But, by our not speaking, we avoided
misrepresenting the group of students who do not
wish to have their resources directed in these
political ways.
In short, we have stopped some of the most visible
and alienating activity commonly performed by
COPs. But in so doing, we seem to have converted
a lot of the outrage at the ASSU's action into anger
at the ASSU's inaction.
RESUME PACKING
It has become quite in vogue to slam ASSU elected
officials. Arch-conservative John Abbott's recent
comments in the Review calling us "resume packers
and megalomaniacs" are typical.
Of course, you in the Senate know how valuable this
experience has been for resume purposes. Of
course, all of us have used our contacts to secure
high-paying multinational consultancies. YEAH
RIGHT! Here's the facts: no one on this year's COP
got any references out of this job, none of us harbor
any delusions of political or policy-oriented careers.
For our resumes, this rates a big zero. I must admit
it is the last line of my two-page c.v. (That's what
grads have -- c.v.'s). But who is going to hire a
statistics professor because of his political
involvement. At best, someone might forgive us for
not doing much real academic work this year.
As for the megalomaniac thing: Only a very sad
megalomaniac would seek to take over the ASSU.
Doubtless there is more raw power to be had
elsewhere. You could be the person who assigns
Buffy and Muffy as frosh roommates. You could
infiltrate the Daily and censor the articles to fit your
world view as some editors have.
No...the reason to become involved is the chance to
deal with intelligent grown-ups in a real-life setting,
the chance to help Stanford, and the pride one can
take in a job well done.
STUDENT ADVOCACY
Our biggest successes this year have been in terms
of getting student concerns heard and addressed.
This fall, Stanford returned to a campus stricken

were negligently omitted, it would be an expensive
mistake indeed. Equally sad would be if we wasted
money in court fighting these challenges.
We ought to pressure Stanford, the great inertial
mass, to wake up on this and similar issues.
4. Graduate Student Bill of Rights: Full Disclosure
For many graduate students, the University is our
sole employer, landlord, school, and health-care
provider. Over the last several years, the University
has been running roughshod over our lives, eroding
one at a time the basic privileges afforded graduate
students.
When the government began to tax stipends, the
university did not include tax as a legitimate expense.
As teaching and course requirements increased, the
length of time given to finish remained the same.
While foreign students were banned from working
off-campus, summer support was reduced. When
200 extra students are admitted annually, only 90
new housing spots are provided. It has already
gotten to the point that graduate students unable to
afford off-campus housing camp in the hills, live in
their offices, sleep in eating-house lofts, or stay in
their cars at the beginning of the school year until
they get off the wait list.
Major new cuts are planned for next year's incoming
class. Where will it end?
Ideally, all Ph.D. students would receive support for
as long as they were making progress towards a
degree. We could try to claim this as our moral right.
However, money doesn't grow on trees and funding
has to come from somewhere.
Instead, let me suggest that real problem here is that
graduate students feel betrayed. Why? Our letters of
admission suggested that we'd be happy campers,
well-fed and clothed, for the duration of our study
(or at least most of it). You know what, in a lot of
cases, it has turned out to be the big lie. People end
up taking big loans or, worse, leaving because they
are broke. People ended up regretting the decisions
they made under the scandalously rosy scenarios
painted by their offers.
This must stop. If we can't demand support, we can
at least demand fairness and honesty. So here is our
Bill of Rights which we ask the Faculty Senate and
President to enact before Stanford admits another
graduate class:
1) FULL DISCLOSURE. Graduate offers of
admission must include the following information:
Length of support if any, conditions of support,
amount of support, expected annual expenses
(including taxes) both off-campus and on, expected
time to degree, likelihood that the admittee complete
their degree, and availability of housing of various
types. The facts included in these letters must be
independently reviewed by a body of graduate
students on a regular basis.
2) TRUTH-IN-ADVERTISING: Graduate offers of
admission should be binding contracts.
If the University were to admit the truth in this way,
hopefully schools and deparments would be forced
to provide more reasonable offers of support. But
even if the offers aren't changed, at least people
would stop making major life decisions that they
wouldn't have made had they known the truth.
5. Public Meetings with the President
Since a COP will not be meeting with President
Casper, there will be an extra free hour on his
calendar. This provides a real opportunity to
increase communication with the University. The
Senate should immediately seek a series of quarterly
town meetings with the President where all students
can ask questions about administration policy. This
direct contact would provide an invaluable channel
for students to say what they feel works and what
they feel doesn't. Having such opportunities would
increase free exchange and reduce the kind of
alienation felt by students who don't think they can
play an active role in their own University.
GET INVOLVED. STAY INVOLVED.
Finally, on behalf of the COP, I would like to thank
those of you here in the Senate for your effort to
make Stanford a better place for students. I'd
especially like to thank those of you who took the
time to go out and bring new issues and ideas back to
the Senate. I'd like thank all of those who came to
Town Meetings, sat on committees, and ran our
Businesses and Services.
In some sense, it would be easy for us all to leave the
ASSU and not look back, saying that we've done our
time. Many of us in some sense would like to see the
COP-less ASSU fail as a vindication of our beliefs.
But I hope the spirit that brought us to work for
Stanford this year still burns in each of us and that
each of us will take focus some of our energies into
making the ASSU a strong voice for the students in
the future.
I would encourage all students to get involved,
because no matter how appears from the outside,
taking an active role on campus issues is rewarding,
interesting, and stimulating. Though I wouldn't
want to be COP again, it was a fine thing to do once,
and I think I learned a lot.

STATE OF THE ASSOCIATION
20 MAY 1999
(PAID ADVERTISEMENT)
The following is the text of the farewell
address of the Council of Presidents, as
delivered to the ASSU Senate on 20 May
1992 by John Over deck:
It's been a long year.
BACK FROM THE PLATFORM
This year's Students First Council of Presidents
followed in the footsteps of a series of politically
activist, unabashedly progressive student
administrations. These administrations had the
value of involving traditionally underrepresented
groups and bringing previously unheard views to
center stage. They spoke of the rights of minority
groups to self-determination. They spoke of needs
unmet by the status quo.
Yet, soon, they began to exploit the majority process
which they had criticized so vehemently. Student
government became the exclusive province of
radical politicians who used thousands of dollars to
support pet causes like progressive presidential
candidates. Before long, they had disenfranchised
not only the minority of conservatives who opposed
their ideas in full, but also a number of sympathetic
moderates who became tired of their student
government's single-minded focus on a divisive
form of multiculturalism.
This year, we have led the ASSU away from some of
its past excesses. No longer does the ASSU use
student money to bail its friends out of jail. No
longer does the ASSU issue pronouncements on
international affairs or take sides in national labor
disputes. No longer does the COP use its position to
press for an agenda in the national media. To do so
would insult Stanford students who are far more
qualified than we to speak on these issues.
This change in COP behavior obviously doesn't
inhibit student activism. A vivid example of this
was the recent Rodney King protest. Nobody
needed the COP to speak for them on national
issues. But, by our not speaking, we avoided
misrepresenting the group of students who do not
wish to have their resources directed in these
political ways.
In short, we have stopped some of the most visible
and alienating activity commonly performed by
COPs. But in so doing, we seem to have converted
a lot of the outrage at the ASSU's action into anger
at the ASSU's inaction.
RESUME PACKING
It has become quite in vogue to slam ASSU elected
officials. Arch-conservative John Abbott's recent
comments in the Review calling us "resume packers
and megalomaniacs" are typical.
Of course, you in the Senate know how valuable this
experience has been for resume purposes. Of
course, all of us have used our contacts to secure
high-paying multinational consultancies. YEAH
RIGHT! Here's the facts: no one on this year's COP
got any references out of this job, none of us harbor
any delusions of political or policy-oriented careers.
For our resumes, this rates a big zero. I must admit
it is the last line of my two-page c.v. (That's what
grads have -- c.v.'s). But who is going to hire a
statistics professor because of his political
involvement. At best, someone might forgive us for
not doing much real academic work this year.
As for the megalomaniac thing: Only a very sad
megalomaniac would seek to take over the ASSU.
Doubtless there is more raw power to be had
elsewhere. You could be the person who assigns
Buffy and Muffy as frosh roommates. You could
infiltrate the Daily and censor the articles to fit your
world view as some editors have.
No...the reason to become involved is the chance to
deal with intelligent grown-ups in a real-life setting,
the chance to help Stanford, and the pride one can
take in a job well done.
STUDENT ADVOCACY
Our biggest successes this year have been in terms
of getting student concerns heard and addressed.
This fall, Stanford returned to a campus stricken
with budget crises. We succeeded in placing
students on most of these committees. In so doing,
undoubtedly many disasters were avoided before
they happened.
We were able to take a leadership role in protecting
vital Dean of Student programs, including the
community centers, by taking large cuts in the ASSU
budget. In the last 13 months, the ASSU budget has
been cut 30%. Most elected student salaries have
been reduced 40%. At the same time, non
refundable fees have been reduced from $7 per
student annually to 23 cents. No longer is the ASSU
soaking the students just to stash money in its slush
funds. Although we still have over $1.5 million net
holdings, the cycle of tax and save is broken.
We hosted open forums which led to saving UAC
programs, saving cooks for the row, and protecting
drama for undergraduates.
Graduate issues received nearly equal time for the
first time in recent Stanford history. The University
has already responded by returning Manzanita Park
to graduate students. But much more is to be done.
We successfully fought for University continuation
of the Sexual Assault Prevention Education and
Response efforts. Unfortunately, the Directory deal
has fallen through in the turmoil of the election.
Even when we were thwarted by issues, the
University heard student concerns and made some
concessions to students. For example, though we
will endure a tuition increase, financial aid was
protected and the planned health-fee was scrapped.
Also, we have set a foundation for the case of the
reduced tuition increase in future years.
STUDENT SERVICES
Unfortunately, we have not had as much success in
fighting for student services as we would have liked.
What successes we had came relatively early in the
year with the hiring of the Sexual Assault Officer and
the starting of Friday Classics.
For some reason still not entirely clear to me, the
Senate placed the ASSU laserprinting service in the
Storke Bldg where roughly no one uses it.
The major feature of the Course Guide was that it
was produced so as to facilitate future expansion. It
now presumably won't be produced next year.
Our ASSU News adds in the Daily apparently did
not reach the desired target audience because people
just don't bother to read the Daily that closely.
The Aerobics business project is still not finalized and
the next Senate will have to start it up if it is
interested.
The First-Year Trips proposal is before you tonight
and I'll reserve comment on that for the debate.
Improved campus lighting is sadly still a long way
off in this budget climate.
COMMUNITY RELATIONS
For many years on this campus, battle lines have
been drawn between various groups: blacks and
conservatives, fraternities and feminists. Before last
year, student government did little to heal wounds,
while often pouring salt on them from atop their
soapbox. At times the hate became so engrossing, the
tension so stifling, that Stanford's diversity which we
prize so dearly seemed to be more of a handicap than
a blessing. Groups formed, splintered, warred, while
many students just watched bitterly, afraid to speak
their minds. Although people are reluctant to
acknowledge the cost of anger, it was felt plainly at
countless dinner tables where people no longer
shared their perspectives or took advantage of others'
experiences, but rather seethed with mistrust. People
of many groups even suggested it might be better to
have a white Stanford, a black Stanford, an Asian
Stanford, a gay Stanford, and so on.
While it might be easier to segregate, this cannot be
the answer. The implications to society as a whole
are too damning.
Stanford must come together. Our modest efforts in
this direction included hosting two leadership
summits this year with the hope of increasing
partnership between people with shared interests
and increasing communication between those of
divergent interests. Also, we met with community
leaders to discuss University issues as they related to
their communities. We also eschewed opportunities
to use the office as platform for national media
exposure, choosing to replace the atmosphere of
pressure politics with collegiality. We hope that in
these little ways we have fostered a slightly more
sharing environment between different communities.
We are glad to report that, in places, shouting has
given way to dialogue, enmity has given way to
amity.
Still we must not delude ourselves. Bigotry and
intolerance still persist at Stanford, and it will take a
great many years to overcome them, even at such a
place as Stanford.
It is a mistake to think of the ongoing process of
coming together as a fight. I thank Derek Miyahara
for the following insight. I think the standard advice
of the marriage counselor is apt. To have a happy
marriage, each person must feel they are doing more
than their share because one never fully appreciates
the work of others. Instead of fighting, let's each try
to give a little more.
A UNION DIVIDING
As I stand here giving the last State of Association
speech for a while, I can't help but think of a bitter
Gorbachev who so reluctantly gave the reins to the
agents of radical reform, agents who were set to
smash the whole into parts, agents who gave up on
the system.
How surprised and disappointed he was to see that
times had passed him by. Rather than leading the
restructuring of the broken system he oversaw its
dismantling at the hands of a bombastic drunkard
who didn't see value in the Union. Some still see
Gorbachev as heroic, but most of his countrymen see
him as pedantic and weak. Respected by neither the
communists nor the reformers, he will have to hope
for the pens of historians to return to him a modicum
of respect in his homeland.
The analogy is not perfect: I certainly would not
want to imply that Mr. Mun et al. are drunkards.
1 have not given up on our Union. I think it can
provide and does provide valuable and needed
representation for students.
But we stand at a crossroads. Not only do we lack a
COP, but students are moving to set up other
associations to take its place: graduate student
associations, progressive alliances. I still have hope
that the Association will not divide into graduates
and undergradutes, progressives and pragmatists, or
worse become the University's scapegoat for why it
is unresponsive.
COMMON GROUND
Whoever takes over in the current vacuum will have
to realize the tenuous position of the whole
organization. Unless common ground is found, the
ASSU is doomed to splinter. This would be
especially damaging at such a critical time for
Stanford. As the University changes Presidents and
Provosts, nothing is assured. As at so many
universities, there could be graduate student unions,
progressive student unions, and basically no student
input in the university at all. At Stanford, we have
always had it pretty good. Through the committee
process, more often than not, even though not all
students are polled, some reasonable version of
student opinion is conveyed to relevant decision
makers. This committee process works not through
the good grace of the university, but rather because
there are student watchdogs who try make sure
there are students where there should be.
One year from today, the ASSU will exist in its
current form only if it has found some common
ground. In order to see this common ground,
senators must work together with two things in
mind:
1) Senators must factor the value of their association
with others into their own self and constituent
interests when they evaluate a proposal. That is,
they should realize that if they want an Association,
not every line will be in their immediate self interest.
2) Senators must not push their own agenda to the
detriment of the whole.
Examples of the common ground this year include:
• Successful lobbying against a health fee and a
lowering of financial aid self-help requirement.
• Hiring a Sexual Assault Prevention Education and
Response Coordinator
1 hope that the Senate will see a similar shared value
in the First-Year Trips proposal before the Senate
tonight.
But there other even clearer issues. Let me outline
five issues which I think the students can unite
behind and I think could give reason for the ASSU to
exist next year as a representative body.
1. Let's take back Graduation
Every year, the Commencement speaker is
nominally chosen by the students and, every year,
the speaker is less prominent than the last. How can
this be?
Well, here's the process. Early in the year, the Senior
class presidents are asked to give list of ten speakers
they would like for graduation from the list of
possiblities. Then the University picks.
That's a little bit like: choose your 10 favorite
presidential candidates and we'll pick the final 1.
In the end, the graduation speaker becomes a
University political football. This year, to appease
the Art faculty and alumni concerned about
Stanford's commitment to art, we have as our
speaker Kirk Varnedoe, some one I, the captain of
the West All-Star College Bowl team, had never ever
heard of. While I concede notoriety isn't the be-all
and end-all of these things, it sure helps,.
Wasn't it the Stanford admissions materials that said
in response to "Which is better, a B in an AP course
or an A in a normal course?" that "Normally,
Stanford students are the ones that get A's in AP
courses." Applying that philosophy here, if we need
to satisfy certain political objectives, we ought to be
able to do so without choosing such a weak speaker.
If the administration knew or cared what a disgrace
its annual selection is to the 20,000 attendees, maybe
it would shape up.
In any case, the Senate should take the lead by
demanding that the Senior Class's preferences are
respected before yet another class leaves with a
whimper not a bang and yet another group of
parents are left wondering whether Stanford was
really $60,000 better than Cal.
2. Let's take back Tresidder.
Tresidder is a student union. NOT!
Ten years ago, we had a bowling alley down
underneath the computer Lair. That was replaced by
a computer center, still not too bad. But for the last 3
years, that 10,000 square feet has been off-limits to
students and more than half-vacant.
One of the best things we could do to promote better
campus social interaction is to develop that space
into some place students would want to be. The
irony of this is that this could be done and Stanford
could even make a profit.
Yet Stanford has sat waiting for three years, waiting
for money to build up in the bank, waiting for the
Bookstore, waiting for blueprints. No developer
develops this way. The student government should
make one its foremost priorities to push for
University leadership in developing that space. We
must seize the opportunities that a change in
University leadership provides in terms of new ideas
and new approaches. Unless we get serious
involvement from the Vice President for Student
Resources or the President or Provost's Office, that
space may never be developed for student use. But
if we get some support, there could be a night club
and some shops down there in a few months.
3. New buildings should be accessible.
Because of its low-rise, modern construction and
bicycle-oriented design, Stanford turns out to be one
of the most disabled-accessible major universities.
Stanford also has made laudable efforts to provide
necessary academic services for its disabled
students.
Sadly, Stanford's commitment is only half-baked.
Stanford has been greatly remiss in its recent
construction. Stanford has not provided access
above the ground floor in any of its new or planned
dormitories. This lack of follow-through is not only
a gross inconvenience for affected students, but also
is offensive to those of us who think that there is a
rights-issue here as well as a practical one.
But, if this is not enough to convince you, then let
me give an economic argument. Remember that a
federal law was recently enacted requiring access in
public places wherever economically feasible.
Elevators cost relatively little if designed into a
building, but cost scads of money if they have to be
retrofitted into a building. If Stanford is required to
retrofit elevators into new buildings from which they
were negligently omitted, it would be an expensive
mistake indeed. Equally sad would be if we wasted
money in court fighting these challenges.
We ought to pressure Stanford, the great inertial
mass, to wake up on this and similar issues.
4. Graduate Student Bill of Rights: Full Disclosure
For many graduate students, the University is our
sole employer, landlord, school, and health-care
provider. Over the last several years, the University
has been running roughshod over our lives, eroding
one at a time the basic privileges afforded graduate
students.
When the government began to tax stipends, the

200 extra students are admitted annually, only 90
new housing spots are provided. It has already
gotten to the point that graduate students unable to
afford off-campus housing camp in the hills, live in
their offices, sleep in eating-house lofts, or stay in
their cars at the beginning of the school year until
they get off the wait list.
Major new cuts are planned for next year's incoming
class. Where will it end?
Ideally, all Ph.D. students would receive support for

are too damning.
Stanford must come together. Our modest efforts in
this direction included hosting two leadership
summits this year with the hope of increasing
partnership between people with shared interests
and increasing communication between those of
divergent interests. Also, we met with community
leaders to discuss University issues as they related to
their communities. We also eschewed opportunities
to use the office as platform for national media
exposure, choosing to replace the atmosphere of
pressure politics with collegiality. We hope that in
these little ways we have fostered a slightly more
sharing environment between different communities.
We are glad to report that, in places, shouting has
given way to dialogue, enmity has given way to
amity.
Still we must not delude ourselves. Bigotry and
intolerance still persist at Stanford, and it will take a
great many years to overcome them, even at such a
place as Stanford.
It is a mistake to think of the ongoing process of
coming together as a fight. I thank Derek Miyahara
for the following insight. I think the standard advice
of the marriage counselor is apt. To have a happy
marriage, each person must feel they are doing more
than their share because one never fully appreciates
the work of others. Instead of fighting, let's each try
to give a little more.
A UNION DIVIDING
As I stand here giving the last State of Association
speech for a while, I can't help but think of a bitter
Gorbachev who so reluctantly gave the reins to the
agents of radical reform, agents who were set to
smash the whole into parts, agents who gave up on
the system.
How surprised and disappointed he was to see that
times had passed him by. Rather than leading the
restructuring of the broken system he oversaw its
dismantling at the hands of a bombastic drunkard
who didn't see value in the Union. Some still see
Gorbachev as heroic, but most of his countrymen see
him as pedantic and weak. Respected by neither the
communists nor the reformers, he will have to hope
for the pens of historians to return to him a modicum
of respect in his homeland.
The analogy is not perfect: I certainly would not
want to imply that Mr. Mun et al. are drunkards.
1 have not given up on our Union. I think it can
provide and does provide valuable and needed
representation for students.
But we stand at a crossroads. Not only do we lack a
COP, but students are moving to set up other
associations to take its place: graduate student
associations, progressive alliances. I still have hope
that the Association will not divide into graduates
and undergradutes, progressives and pragmatists, or
worse become the University's scapegoat for why it
is unresponsive.
COMMON GROUND
Whoever takes over in the current vacuum will have
to realize the tenuous position of the whole
organization. Unless common ground is found, the
ASSU is doomed to splinter. This would be
especially damaging at such a critical time for
Stanford. As the University changes Presidents and
Provosts, nothing is assured. As at so many
universities, there could be graduate student unions,
progressive student unions, and basically no student
input in the university at all. At Stanford, we have
always had it pretty good. Through the committee
process, more often than not, even though not all
students are polled, some reasonable version of
student opinion is conveyed to relevant decision
makers. This committee process works not through
the good grace of the university, but rather because
there are student watchdogs who try make sure
there are students where there should be.
One year from today, the ASSU will exist in its
current form only if it has found some common
ground. In order to see this common ground,
senators must work together with two things in
mind:
1) Senators must factor the value of their association
with others into their own self and constituent
interests when they evaluate a proposal. That is,
they should realize that if they want an Association,
not every line will be in their immediate self interest.
2) Senators must not push their own agenda to the
detriment of the whole.
Examples of the common ground this year include:
• Successful lobbying against a health fee and a
lowering of financial aid self-help requirement.
• Hiring a Sexual Assault Prevention Education and
Response Coordinator
1 hope that the Senate will see a similar shared value
in the First-Year Trips proposal before the Senate
tonight.
But there other even clearer issues. Let me outline
five issues which I think the students can unite
behind and I think could give reason for the ASSU to
exist next year as a representative body.
1. Let's take back Graduation
Every year, the Commencement speaker is
nominally chosen by the students and, every year,
the speaker is less prominent than the last. How can
this be?
Well, here's the process. Early in the year, the Senior
class presidents are asked to give list of ten speakers
they would like for graduation from the list of
possiblities. Then the University picks.
That's a little bit like: choose your 10 favorite
presidential candidates and we'll pick the final 1.
In the end, the graduation speaker becomes a
University political football. This year, to appease
the Art faculty and alumni concerned about
Stanford's commitment to art, we have as our
speaker Kirk Varnedoe, some one I, the captain of
the West All-Star College Bowl team, had never ever
heard of. While I concede notoriety isn't the be-all
and end-all of these things, it sure helps,.
Wasn't it the Stanford admissions materials that said
in response to "Which is better, a B in an AP course
or an A in a normal course?" that "Normally,
Stanford students are the ones that get A's in AP
courses." Applying that philosophy here, if we need
to satisfy certain political objectives, we ought to be
able to do so without choosing such a weak speaker.
If the administration knew or cared what a disgrace
its annual selection is to the 20,000 attendees, maybe
it would shape up.
In any case, the Senate should take the lead by
demanding that the Senior Class's preferences are
respected before yet another class leaves with a
whimper not a bang and yet another group of
parents are left wondering whether Stanford was
really $60,000 better than Cal.
2. Let's take back Tresidder.
Tresidder is a student union. NOT!
Ten years ago, we had a bowling alley down
underneath the computer Lair. That was replaced by
a computer center, still not too bad. But for the last 3
years, that 10,000 square feet has been off-limits to
students and more than half-vacant.
One of the best things we could do to promote better
campus social interaction is to develop that space
into some place students would want to be. The
irony of this is that this could be done and Stanford
could even make a profit.
Yet Stanford has sat waiting for three years, waiting
for money to build up in the bank, waiting for the
Bookstore, waiting for blueprints. No developer
develops this way. The student government should
make one its foremost priorities to push for
University leadership in developing that space. We
must seize the opportunities that a change in
University leadership provides in terms of new ideas
and new approaches. Unless we get serious
involvement from the Vice President for Student
Resources or the President or Provost's Office, that
space may never be developed for student use. But
if we get some support, there could be a night club
and some shops down there in a few months.
3. New buildings should be accessible.
Because of its low-rise, modern construction and
bicycle-oriented design, Stanford turns out to be one
of the most disabled-accessible major universities.
Stanford also has made laudable efforts to provide
necessary academic services for its disabled
students.
Sadly, Stanford's commitment is only half-baked.
Stanford has been greatly remiss in its recent
construction. Stanford has not provided access
above the ground floor in any of its new or planned
dormitories. This lack of follow-through is not only
a gross inconvenience for affected students, but also
is offensive to those of us who think that there is a
rights-issue here as well as a practical one.
But, if this is not enough to convince you, then let
me give an economic argument. Remember that a
federal law was recently enacted requiring access in
public places wherever economically feasible.
Elevators cost relatively little if designed into a
building, but cost scads of money if they have to be
retrofitted into a building. If Stanford is required to
retrofit elevators into new buildings from which they
were negligently omitted, it would be an expensive
mistake indeed. Equally sad would be if we wasted
money in court fighting these challenges.
We ought to pressure Stanford, the great inertial
mass, to wake up on this and similar issues.
4. Graduate Student Bill of Rights: Full Disclosure
For many graduate students, the University is our
sole employer, landlord, school, and health-care
provider. Over the last several years, the University
has been running roughshod over our lives, eroding
one at a time the basic privileges afforded graduate
students.
When the government began to tax stipends, the
university did not include tax as a legitimate expense.
As teaching and course requirements increased, the
length of time given to finish remained the same.
While foreign students were banned from working
off-campus, summer support was reduced. When
200 extra students are admitted annually, only 90
new housing spots are provided. It has already
gotten to the point that graduate students unable to
afford off-campus housing camp in the hills, live in
their offices, sleep in eating-house lofts, or stay in
their cars at the beginning of the school year until
they get off the wait list.
Major new cuts are planned for next year's incoming
class. Where will it end?
Ideally, all Ph.D. students would receive support for
as long as they were making progress towards a
degree. We could try to claim this as our moral right.
However, money doesn't grow on trees and funding
has to come from somewhere.
Instead, let me suggest that real problem here is that
graduate students feel betrayed. Why? Our letters of
admission suggested that we'd be happy campers,
well-fed and clothed, for the duration of our study
(or at least most of it). You know what, in a lot of
cases, it has turned out to be the big lie. People end
up taking big loans or, worse, leaving because they
are broke. People ended up regretting the decisions
they made under the scandalously rosy scenarios
painted by their offers.
This must stop. If we can't demand support, we can
at least demand fairness and honesty. So here is our
Bill of Rights which we ask the Faculty Senate and
President to enact before Stanford admits another
graduate class:
1) FULL DISCLOSURE. Graduate offers of
admission must include the following information:
Length of support if any, conditions of support,
amount of support, expected annual expenses
(including taxes) both off-campus and on, expected
time to degree, likelihood that the admittee complete
their degree, and availability of housing of various
types. The facts included in these letters must be
independently reviewed by a body of graduate
students on a regular basis.
2) TRUTH-IN-ADVERTISING: Graduate offers of
admission should be binding contracts.
If the University were to admit the truth in this way,
hopefully schools and deparments would be forced
to provide more reasonable offers of support. But
even if the offers aren't changed, at least people
would stop making major life decisions that they
wouldn't have made had they known the truth.
5. Public Meetings with the President
Since a COP will not be meeting with President
Casper, there will be an extra free hour on his
calendar. This provides a real opportunity to
increase communication with the University. The
Senate should immediately seek a series of quarterly
town meetings with the President where all students
can ask questions about administration policy. This
direct contact would provide an invaluable channel
for students to say what they feel works and what
they feel doesn't. Having such opportunities would
increase free exchange and reduce the kind of
alienation felt by students who don't think they can
play an active role in their own University.
GET INVOLVED. STAY INVOLVED.
Finally, on behalf of the COP, I would like to thank
those of you here in the Senate for your effort to
make Stanford a better place for students. I'd
especially like to thank those of you who took the
time to go out and bring new issues and ideas back to
the Senate. I'd like thank all of those who came to
Town Meetings, sat on committees, and ran our
Businesses and Services.
In some sense, it would be easy for us all to leave the
ASSU and not look back, saying that we've done our
time. Many of us in some sense would like to see the
COP-less ASSU fail as a vindication of our beliefs.
But I hope the spirit that brought us to work for
Stanford this year still burns in each of us and that
each of us will take focus some of our energies into
making the ASSU a strong voice for the students in
the future.
I would encourage all students to get involved,
because no matter how appears from the outside,
taking an active role on campus issues is rewarding,
interesting, and stimulating. Though I wouldn't
want to be COP again, it was a fine thing to do once,
and I think I learned a lot.

STATE OF THE ASSOCIATION
20 MAY 1999
(PAID ADVERTISEMENT)
The following is the text of the farewell
address of the Council of Presidents, as
delivered to the ASSU Senate on 20 May
1992 by John Over deck:
It's been a long year.
BACK FROM THE PLATFORM
This year's Students First Council of Presidents
followed in the footsteps of a series of politically
activist, unabashedly progressive student
administrations. These administrations had the
value of involving traditionally underrepresented
groups and bringing previously unheard views to
center stage. They spoke of the rights of minority
groups to self-determination. They spoke of needs
unmet by the status quo.
Yet, soon, they began to exploit the majority process
which they had criticized so vehemently. Student
government became the exclusive province of
radical politicians who used thousands of dollars to
support pet causes like progressive presidential
candidates. Before long, they had disenfranchised
not only the minority of conservatives who opposed
their ideas in full, but also a number of sympathetic
moderates who became tired of their student
government's single-minded focus on a divisive
form of multiculturalism.
This year, we have led the ASSU away from some of
its past excesses. No longer does the ASSU use
student money to bail its friends out of jail. No
longer does the ASSU issue pronouncements on
international affairs or take sides in national labor
disputes. No longer does the COP use its position to
press for an agenda in the national media. To do so
would insult Stanford students who are far more
qualified than we to speak on these issues.
This change in COP behavior obviously doesn't
inhibit student activism. A vivid example of this
was the recent Rodney King protest. Nobody
needed the COP to speak for them on national
issues. But, by our not speaking, we avoided
misrepresenting the group of students who do not
wish to have their resources directed in these
political ways.
In short, we have stopped some of the most visible
and alienating activity commonly performed by
COPs. But in so doing, we seem to have converted
a lot of the outrage at the ASSU's action into anger
at the ASSU's inaction.
RESUME PACKING
It has become quite in vogue to slam ASSU elected
officials. Arch-conservative John Abbott's recent
comments in the Review calling us "resume packers
and megalomaniacs" are typical.
Of course, you in the Senate know how valuable this
experience has been for resume purposes. Of
course, all of us have used our contacts to secure
high-paying multinational consultancies. YEAH
RIGHT! Here's the facts: no one on this year's COP
got any references out of this job, none of us harbor
any delusions of political or policy-oriented careers.
For our resumes, this rates a big zero. I must admit
it is the last line of my two-page c.v. (That's what
grads have -- c.v.'s). But who is going to hire a
statistics professor because of his political
involvement. At best, someone might forgive us for
not doing much real academic work this year.
As for the megalomaniac thing: Only a very sad
megalomaniac would seek to take over the ASSU.
Doubtless there is more raw power to be had
elsewhere. You could be the person who assigns
Buffy and Muffy as frosh roommates. You could
infiltrate the Daily and censor the articles to fit your
world view as some editors have.
No...the reason to become involved is the chance to
deal with intelligent grown-ups in a real-life setting,
the chance to help Stanford, and the pride one can
take in a job well done.
STUDENT ADVOCACY
Our biggest successes this year have been in terms
of getting student concerns heard and addressed.
This fall, Stanford returned to a campus stricken
with budget crises. We succeeded in placing
students on most of these committees. In so doing,
undoubtedly many disasters were avoided before
they happened.
We were able to take a leadership role in protecting
vital Dean of Student programs, including the
community centers, by taking large cuts in the ASSU
budget. In the last 13 months, the ASSU budget has
been cut 30%. Most elected student salaries have
been reduced 40%. At the same time, non
refundable fees have been reduced from $7 per
student annually to 23 cents. No longer is the ASSU
soaking the students just to stash money in its slush
funds. Although we still have over $1.5 million net
holdings, the cycle of tax and save is broken.
We hosted open forums which led to saving UAC
programs, saving cooks for the row, and protecting
drama for undergraduates.
Graduate issues received nearly equal time for the
first time in recent Stanford history. The University
has already responded by returning Manzanita Park
to graduate students. But much more is to be done.
We successfully fought for University continuation
of the Sexual Assault Prevention Education and
Response efforts. Unfortunately, the Directory deal
has fallen through in the turmoil of the election.
Even when we were thwarted by issues, the
University heard student concerns and made some
concessions to students. For example, though we
will endure a tuition increase, financial aid was
protected and the planned health-fee was scrapped.
Also, we have set a foundation for the case of the
reduced tuition increase in future years.
STUDENT SERVICES
Unfortunately, we have not had as much success in
fighting for student services as we would have liked.
What successes we had came relatively early in the
year with the hiring of the Sexual Assault Officer and
the starting of Friday Classics.
For some reason still not entirely clear to me, the
Senate placed the ASSU laserprinting service in the
Storke Bldg where roughly no one uses it.
The major feature of the Course Guide was that it
was produced so as to facilitate future expansion. It
now presumably won't be produced next year.
Our ASSU News adds in the Daily apparently did
not reach the desired target audience because people
just don't bother to read the Daily that closely.
The Aerobics business project is still not finalized and
the next Senate will have to start it up if it is
interested.
The First-Year Trips proposal is before you tonight
and I'll reserve comment on that for the debate.
Improved campus lighting is sadly still a long way
off in this budget climate.
COMMUNITY RELATIONS
For many years on this campus, battle lines have
been drawn between various groups: blacks and
conservatives, fraternities and feminists. Before last
year, student government did little to heal wounds,
while often pouring salt on them from atop their
soapbox. At times the hate became so engrossing, the
tension so stifling, that Stanford's diversity which we
prize so dearly seemed to be more of a handicap than
a blessing. Groups formed, splintered, warred, while
many students just watched bitterly, afraid to speak
their minds. Although people are reluctant to
acknowledge the cost of anger, it was felt plainly at
countless dinner tables where people no longer
shared their perspectives or took advantage of others'
experiences, but rather seethed with mistrust. People
of many groups even suggested it might be better to
have a white Stanford, a black Stanford, an Asian
Stanford, a gay Stanford, and so on.
While it might be easier to segregate, this cannot be
the answer. The implications to society as a whole
are too damning.
Stanford must come together. Our modest efforts in
this direction included hosting two leadership
summits this year with the hope of increasing
partnership between people with shared interests
and increasing communication between those of
divergent interests. Also, we met with community
leaders to discuss University issues as they related to
their communities. We also eschewed opportunities
to use the office as platform for national media
exposure, choosing to replace the atmosphere of
pressure politics with collegiality. We hope that in
these little ways we have fostered a slightly more
sharing environment between different communities.
We are glad to report that, in places, shouting has
given way to dialogue, enmity has given way to
amity.
Still we must not delude ourselves. Bigotry and
intolerance still persist at Stanford, and it will take a
great many years to overcome them, even at such a
place as Stanford.
It is a mistake to think of the ongoing process of
coming together as a fight. I thank Derek Miyahara
for the following insight. I think the standard advice
of the marriage counselor is apt. To have a happy
marriage, each person must feel they are doing more
than their share because one never fully appreciates
the work of others. Instead of fighting, let's each try
to give a little more.
A UNION DIVIDING
As I stand here giving the last State of Association

Gorbachev who so reluctantly gave the reins to the
agents of radical reform, agents who were set to
smash the whole into parts, agents who gave up on

play an active role in their own University.
GET INVOLVED. STAY INVOLVED.
Finally, on behalf of the COP, I would like to thank
those of you here in the Senate for your effort to
make Stanford a better place for students. I'd
especially like to thank those of you who took the
time to go out and bring new issues and ideas back to
the Senate. I'd like thank all of those who came to
Town Meetings, sat on committees, and ran our
Businesses and Services.
In some sense, it would be easy for us all to leave the
ASSU and not look back, saying that we've done our
time. Many of us in some sense would like to see the
COP-less ASSU fail as a vindication of our beliefs.
But I hope the spirit that brought us to work for
Stanford this year still burns in each of us and that
each of us will take focus some of our energies into
making the ASSU a strong voice for the students in
the future.
I would encourage all students to get involved,
because no matter how appears from the outside,
taking an active role on campus issues is rewarding,
interesting, and stimulating. Though I wouldn't
want to be COP again, it was a fine thing to do once,
and I think I learned a lot.
