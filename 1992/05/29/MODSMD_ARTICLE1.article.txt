# Kennedy's style: an asset, liability
##

Leading reporters on a tour
of campus to unveil anoth
er of Stanford's seemingly
endless stream of new buildings
during the early 1980s, Donald
Kennedy moved quickly, nearly
leaving the string of reporters
behind.
"Then he stopped, turned. . .
and suggested that we pick up
the pace or else we'd get lost,"
said Paul Witteman, senior edi
tor of Time magazine, who was
one of the reporters on the tour.
As university president dur
ing the past 12 years, Donald
Kennedy was a bold, self-confi
dent leader whose direct and
open style was the driving force
behind many of the improve
ments made during his tenure.
During his presidency,
Kennedy used his leadership to
push for a number of projects
that made concrete advances in
the '80s, including undergradu
ate education, public service and
a fund-raising campaign that
raised nearly $1.3 billion.
Two well-publicized political
battles — the 1986-87 fight over
locating the Reagan Library on
campus and his ongoing feud
with W. Glenn Campbell, the
long-time director of the Hoover

Institution — also tested
Kennedy's leadership.
* And his personal interaction
with students — by being a
freshman adviser, by holding
interviews on KZSU, by speak
ing in dormitories and teaching
classes — reinforced his image
as an accessible leader.
"He maximizes people
through his own energy," said
Albert Hastorf, a professor
emeritus in psychology who was
Kennedy's first provost. For
example, Hastorf said, "the
Humanities Center was created
(in 1980) because Kennedy
thought it was a good idea and
breathed energy into it."
But just as Kennedy's leader
ship style is credited with driv
ing the successes of his adminis
tration, it is also blamed for its
failures. Many say that

Donald Kennedy, serving out the last few months of his tenure as University president, surveys the Quad and central campus from the
top of Hoover Tower. Kennedy will leave office at the end of August and return to Stanford's biology faculty.
