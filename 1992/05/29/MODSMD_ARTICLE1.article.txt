# Kennedy's style: an asset, liability
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Leading reporters on a tour
of campus to unveil anoth
er of Stanford's seemingly
endless stream of new buildings
during the early 1980s, Donald
Kennedy moved quickly, nearly
leaving the string of reporters
behind.
"Then he stopped, turned. . .
and suggested that we pick up
the pace or else we'd get lost,"
said Paul Witteman, senior edi
tor of Time magazine, who was
one of the reporters on the tour.
As university president dur
ing the past 12 years, Donald
Kennedy was a bold, self-confi
dent leader whose direct and
open style was the driving force
behind many of the improve
ments made during his tenure.
During his presidency,
Kennedy used his leadership to
push for a number of projects
that made concrete advances in
the '80s, including undergradu
ate education, public service and
a fund-raising campaign that
raised nearly $1.3 billion.
Two well-publicized political
battles — the 1986-87 fight over
locating the Reagan Library on
campus and his ongoing feud
with W. Glenn Campbell, the
long-time director of the Hoover

Institution — also tested
Kennedy's leadership.
* And his personal interaction
with students — by being a
freshman adviser, by holding
interviews on KZSU, by speak
ing in dormitories and teaching
classes — reinforced his image
as an accessible leader.
"He maximizes people
through his own energy," said
Albert Hastorf, a professor
emeritus in psychology who was
Kennedy's first provost. For
example, Hastorf said, "the
Humanities Center was created
(in 1980) because Kennedy
thought it was a good idea and
breathed energy into it."
But just as Kennedy's leader
ship style is credited with driv
ing the successes of his adminis
tration, it is also blamed for its
failures. Many say that

News analysis
Kennedy's approach to the indi
rect-cost controversy in its early
stages showed that his self-assur
ance can often be interpreted as
overconfidence.
"Don is a pretty self-confident
guy," Witteman said. "He was per
ceived by some as being too arro
gant."
Although many say a presi
dent has little actual
power in a university —
power comes from the
bottom up, rather than top down
— the role of a president's leader
ship cannot be discounted. Despite
the fact that the president may be
only one individual within a large
and highly complex institution, his
or her leadership has a measurable
influence on university policy.
Just the mystique of the presi
dential position itself often trans
lates into influence. "I think presi
dents are listened to partly because
they are assumed to have more
power than they really do,"
Kennedy said in an interview.
"That certainly gives them a
power of persuasion."
So when a president makes a
visible commitment to a project or
a policy, that alone can often gen
erate stronger support for — or
against — an issue.
"Oddly enough, I think that for
many people, the fact that the
president spoke for certain things
at certain times during these
developments was important —
even though the things themselves
might only Ik: distantly related to
the characteristics and aspirations
of the community," Kennedy said.
Michael Dayman, chancellor of
UC-Berkeley from 1980 to 1990,
agreed. He said the power of a
president "comes from having an
agenda and being persuasive,
working very hard to affect a lot of
people, and constantly negotiating
and bargaining."
Kennedy's advocacy of
undergraduate studies,
for example, has been
instrumental in the devel
opment of stronger undergraduate
programs during his presidency.
Last March, Kennedy
announced $7 million in new pro
grams to improve undergraduate
teaching and "increase the reso
nance between teaching and
research."
The programs — made possible
in large part by a $5 million gift
from Stanford trustee Peter Bing
— provide funds for developing
new courses and cash bonuses for
outstanding teachers, among
other things.
"A visible commitment from
the president (to undergraduate
education) means a lot," said Car
olyn Lougee, who was dean of
undergraduate studies from 1982
until 1987. "Now there are more
honors programs, minority studies
and stronger writing programs.
It's stronger in general." .
Stanford leaned more heavily
toward research before Kennedy
became president, focusing most of
its attention and resources toward
graduate students, Lougee said.
Kennedy has been praised for
helping shift some of that focus
toward undergraduates by empha
sizing teaching through programs
such as "Teaching Week," which
he sponsored last May.
"He did both at the same time,"
Hayman said. "He had the capaci
ty to both compete so well at the
research level and give such promi
nent attention to undergraduate
education."
Though not all of the new pro
grams came directly from
Kennedy, his support in terms of
his personal commitment and his
ability to relate to undergraduates
was significant because such a
commitment helped attract a
strong faculty — the basis of a uni
versity's prestige, Lougee said.
"He will go down as a great
president," she said. "He clearly
raised Stanford several notches in
the scale of universities in the
world."
But the most well-known
Kennedy trait was his per
sonal touch. His jogs to
the Dish, his constant
attendance of athletic events, his
visits to student dorms and his
regular performances with his
wife, Robin, in Gaieties all indicat
ed to the Stanford community that
Kennedy was an open president.
Numerous personal anecdotes
about Kennedy — including one
about him posing in Speedos with
the swim team after it won the
1986 national championship —
demonstrate Kennedy's direct and
personal style of dealing with stu
dents, faculty and staff.
"He has an outgoing, likeable
personality and is willing to have
fun with students," said Political
Science Prof. David Abernethy.
"The shift from the classroom to
the presidency didn't diminish his

touch with students."
Robert Beyers, who was the
director of Stanford News Service
for 28 years, noted that Kennedy
had a "personal knowledge of what
students were saying on a variety
of different issues."
Kennedy said such interaction
is simply a necessary part of being
a university president.
"Part of the presidential role is
to be in the institution and sam
pling what is going on," he said.
"You need to give the occasional
lecture, which I do, and you need
to take freshman advisees every
other year, which I do, and discov
er where they are finding the road
bumpy.
"You need to get out to student
residences a lot," he added. "You
need to meet with the faculty a lot,
in both formal and informal cir
cumstances. You need to get out
on the road and talk to alumni a lot
to find out what is bothering them.
You need to be somewhat external
ly directed."
James Rosse, Kennedy's
provost from 1984 until this year,
described his working relationship
with Kennedy as "complemen
tary."
There was a "natural division"
in their working styles that was
successful, according to Rosse.
Kennedy "tended to be more of a
leader and I was more of a manag
er," Rosse said. "He was more
external, handling the students
and the cast of outsiders, and I
focused on the internal, like the
faculty and staff. He is a good
development activist and I am a
good development planner."
Kennedy's directness was
another of his attributes
as president — a trait
exemplified by how he
handled himself during Faculty
Senate meetings.
Hastorf, who was provost from
1980 to 1984, said Kennedy was
often so eager to answer questions
from the senate that there were
occasions when he actually pre
empted questions that were direct
ed at others.
"On occasions, he let us answer
them," Hastorf added wryly.
Kennedy's directness reflects
his personality, Hastorf said.
"He is a remarkably quick study
and most of the time he is right.
Don understands pretty quickly
what people are after," he said.
"People usually don't have the
feeling that he's a quiet, patient

listener.
"He's not the therapist you'd
pick to talk to about the meaning
of life because he'd say, 'Let me tell
you what you should do right now
to make your life better,'" Hastorf
said.
But Kennedy's directness
proved problematic during the
indirect-cost controversy. Accord
ing to Hastorf, faculty members
questioned Kennedy's habit of giv
ing upfront answers to indirect
cost questions when other people
had done the bookkeeping and
knew the intricacies.
"He should have let other peo
ple share the responsibility with

him," Hastorf said.
Kennedy said he has reconsid
ered some of the remarks he made
during senate meetings. "In one or
two senate debates where it would
have been better to let the faculty
take the matter entirely unto
themselves without any exposure
to the president's view during the
discussion, I jumped in with an
opinion where I probably
shouldn't have," he said.
Though he couldn't recall spe
cific circumstances, he said, "I
have certainly done it a couple of
times. 1 can remember thinking to
myself 'you shouldn't have.' "
One of the most interest
ing instances in which
Kennedy's leadership
was tested is one in
which he did not quite get what he
wanted. And Kennedy, to this day,
says he is still unsure of why that
is.
During the 1986-87 fight over
the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library, Kennedy — an outspoken
liberal — supported locating the
library on campus, despite the
reservations of some liberal faculty
members.
Stanford trustees had chosen
the foothills behind campus as a
possible site for the library. But
approval of the project came
only after the White House and
then-Hoover director Campbell
agreed to drop their plans to
add a public policy center that
would have been controlled by
Hoover.
In 1987, after the Faculty Sen
ate had seen more defined plans
for the library and realized that it
was much larger than expected,
the senate made a proposal to
either scale the library down or
move it from its prominent loca
tion in the foothills.
Finding the Stanford campus
inhospitable, the Reagan presiden
tial foundation decided to drop the
plans for the library a few weeks
later.
Kennedy said the foundation's
decision still puzzles him, especial
ly considering that most faculty
members — despite the objections
of a few — wanted to bring the
library to campus. Most of the con
cerns, he said, were with the
library's design and site plan,
which were viewed as unnecessari
ly extravagant, overshadowing the
Foothills area.
"Those objections, while I did
not happen to agree with them,
were not unreasonable," Kennedy
said. But he immediately worked
to reassure the Reagan presiden
tial foundation that the Faculty
Senate's recommendation, while it
would be heard by himself and the
Board of Trustees, was not bind
ing.
Kennedy said he and then-
Trustees president Warren
Christopher — "a couple of
Democrats" — were "committed
to following through on our com
mitment to the Reagan library
folks."
They told the foundation that
"we were going to hear the Faculty
Senate out, that we would let them
know what the concerns were, but
that we did not ourselves favor nor

would we recommend to the
trustees a fundamental change in
the site plan or our commit
ments," Kennedy said. "And the
day after that the Reagan founda
tion announced that it was not
going to build the library at Stan
ford. Nobody could have been
more surprised than we."
According to Kennedy, the Fac
ulty Senate's criticisms of the
library were "couched in the
appropriate aesthetic and environ
mental terms, and they could have
been dealt with on those terms
without controversy.
"So I never understood, and
don't understand to this day, why
it is that the folks who fearlessly
invaded Grenada were frightened
off by the prospect of the Faculty
Senate debate," Kennedy said.
Another political battle
involving Hoover came to
a head the next year,
when long-time Hoover
Director Campbell was pres
sured to retire by the Board of
Trustees.
Campbell had often sparred
with Kennedy during the '80s, and
liberal faculty — led by English
Prof. Ron Rebholz and Political
Science Prof. John Manley — had
been sporadically calling for a com
plete separation of Hoover from
Stanford.
After a protracted debate, Uni
versity trustees informed Camp
bell May 17, 1988 that they would
launch a search for his successor.
He eventually accepted a retire
ment offer from the trustees, effec
tive August 31, 1989.
Campbell has blamed Kennedy
for the rocky relationship between
Stanford and Hoover during much
of the '80s.
"We had excellent relations in
the 19705, and that didn't cease
until Kennedy started making
accusations against me," he said in

an interview with The Daily last
year. But since Campbell's
removal, Kennedy has sought to
soothe the Stanford-Hoover
grudge.
It has worked.
Campbell's successor as Hoover
director, John Raisian, has been
widely credited for his constructive
approach toward the situation —
and Kennedy has reached out to
him.
When the University Cabinet,
the highest decision-making body
in the University, was created,
Raisian was included among the
members, along with Stanford's
deans, the provost and the director
of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center.
When Campbell was replaced,
Kennedy said, it "was impossible
to avoid" strained relations. He
added that "we have secured a
highly desirable outcome in get
ting John Raisian as director."
Rebholz said the replacement of
Campbell with Raisian is "a cos
metic change" because Hoover is
still ideologically the same. But
despite that difference, he admires
the way Kennedy handled the
debate.
"He was strong, clever and
effective in fighting me and Man
ley," Rebholz said.
Not everything significant
that Kennedy achieved
has been done in the
midst of controversy,
though. Public service has been
one area where nearly everyone —
friends and foes alike — have
given him credit for solid leader
ship.
"A series of quite identifiable
things come from his style . . . The
Haas Center was one. It's a pretty
remarkable organization. I don't
know of another university with

in January 1991. Several who attended the event sought a statement of the University's official policy on the war, which Kennedy did not
provide.
something like this," said Doyle
McManus, a Stanford trustee and
Los Angeles Times reporter.
"He helped push the whole prin
ciple that students ought to do pub
lic service and look at it as something
to do as a career," McManus said.
The establishment of the Haas
Public Service Center in 1984; the
Haas Centennial Professorship of
Public Service in 1989; public ser
vice fellowships for students; and
release time allowing staff mem
bers to do public service were all
Kennedy projects that led to greater
participation in public service by
Stanford community members.
Unlike some of the other pro
jects that Kennedy pursued, he said
the public service program has
evolved much the way that he envi
sioned it.
"There were times when I feared
that the Haas Public Service Center
might evolve into a kind of center of
white noblesse oblige, if you will,"
Kennedy said. "And instead, at crit
ical points [the Center] fused with
the efforts that minority students
had made to develop outreach pro
grams, for example, in the
Ravenswood school district. So it
didn't get off track."
Kennedy was also named to the
National Commission on the Public
Service in 1988, a high-level com
mittee promoting public service.
Fund raising is another aspect
of the presidency that
depends on individual lead
ership style, because it
requires a great deal of personal
contact with donors.
Stanford's five-year Centennial
Campaign, whose goal was to raise
$1.1 billion, ended up raising
$1,269 billion — one of the most
successful fund-raising drives ever.
Many say Kennedy was a strong
fund-raiser, who used his personal
ity to attract the big gifts.
"Don is a very persuasive person
when he wants something," said
Provost Gerald Lieberman, a long
time Stanford professor who was
Faculty Senate chair in 1987-88.
"He's a hard guy to say 'no' to,"
Hayman said.
Kennedy is "a very effective
fund-raiser," said Richard Bennett,
associate campaign director.
"He's mentally very quick and
he can pick up on somebody's sig
nals when they don't like a particu
lar idea," Bennett said. "He's quick
to reach back into his head and say,
'Forget about that [idea], how
about this?' "
In attempting to raise funds for
"Near West," a $250 million plan to
construct new science buildings,
Kennedy said, "I made 70 calls or
more to corporate CEOs .... A lot
of them were successful."
But the coolness and self
assurance that carried
Kennedy through his first
12 years as president did
not come through for him during
the worst crisis of his presidency —
in fact, it may have been what hurt
him the most.
As the attention of the media
and the government focused on
Stanford, Kennedy should not have
been so dismissive in his public
statements, many say.
"It's always more effective to
defuse one's critics by being more
self-deprecating," said Witteman,
the Time senior editor. "Had he
been more self-deprecating he
would have defused some of the
venom."
Kennedy acknowledged that he
should not have been so confident
at first.
"Early in the process we should
have withheld all judgements until
we got a really good external audit

of the situation," Kennedy said. "I
think there were some early state
ments that in retrospect now reflect
a little more confidence than was
justified at the time."
Kennedy's response was puz
zling to many, who had long consid
ered Kennedy's media savvy one of
his strong points as president.
"I was surprised that he was so
ineffective during indirect costs,"
said Nobel Prize Winning Eco
nomics Prof. Kenneth Arrow, who
was faculty senate chair in 1986-87.
"He waffled too much and was not
very clear about what he wanted."
Kennedy's usually good percep
tion failed him during indirect
costs, Witteman said. "He underes
timated the public response and
reaction to these serious accusa
tions," Witteman said. "He proba
bly misunderstood initially the seri
ous level to which the media was
interested in this stoiy."
But once he assessed the fall
out of the controversy,
some said, he regrouped
and took a strong leader
ship role in coping with the $43 mil
lion budget deficit that will be one
of the legacies of indirect costs.
Unlike his initial handling of the
controversy, Kennedy's leadership
in the budget-cutting process has
been generally praised. "He had a
good grasp of the situation and
immediately started budget trim
ming," Arrow said.
He praised Kennedy for having
"the statesmanship" to start bud
get cuts himself rather than leaving
the job to incoming University
President Gerhard Casper.
Kennedy has also been credited
for being being more open and com
municative during the whole bud
get-cutting process, which — sur
prisingly — has not provoked an
outcry from students or faculty, as
has happened at many other uni
versities this year.
Trustee George Hume pointed
out that Columbia has also had to
implement budget cuts this year,
but there has been tremendous fac
ulty-administration tension there,
unlike at Stanford.
"There's been a lot of participa
tion," Arrow said. Kennedy "left,
the University feeling good."
Hume, president of Basic Amer
ican Foods, Inc., praised Kennedy
for how he has handled his job since
his resignation announcement. "It
was amazing how much was done,
despite the fact that we had a lame
duck president," Hume said.
Kennedy's announcement
that he would resign last
summer, effective August
1992, was a wrenching
decision for him that was institu
tionally necessary and showed
Kennedy's personal dignity, many
said.
"There was so much anxiety and
loss of confidence in the administra
tion overall that something had to
give," said Henry Muller, Time's
managing editor and a member of
Stanford's Board of Trustees. "He
was courageous to resign to defuse
the situation, to allow life to return
to normal... . The political gesture
had to be made."
Muller said he talked to
Kennedy privately about his resig
nation a few days before his deci
sion.
"I'll never forget those conversa
tions," he said. "I was so impressed
by Don's total self awareness, and
his perfect analysis of the situation
of the campus. I have encountered
others in such situations, but it is
rare to find others which such clear
perceptions — he was not sorry for
himself or worried about his repu
tation. He was analytical, finding
what would be the right thing to do.
Others would lose control, and not

be that cool or thoughtful."
According to Beyers, Kennedy
"lost credibility" and had to resign
— but that was not an end in itself
for Kennedy. "There is life after
Stanford," he said.
And Rebholz, although he has
been a consistent critic of
Kennedy's attempts to forge a clos
er relationship with Hoover, said
that overall, Kennedy has done "a
remarkable job."
"It's a pity that his presidency
should end this way," Rebholz said.
Regardless of the indirect
cost controversy and his
subsequent resignation,
Kennedy's reputation is
secure, many said.
If a vote were taken now by the
American Association of Universi
ties to determine the "most effec
tive" university president, Kennedy
would rank in the top three, said
Hayman, a former AAU member.
Indirect costs, at least in how
they will affect Kennedy's legacy,
"will disappear," said Emeritus
Law Prof. John Merryman.
"That'll be a blip. In the longer
view, he has been a good president..
. .The plusses have been a lot more
important than the minuses."
For Hastorf, Donald Kennedy
suited Stanford during the 1980s
just as Wallace Sterling and
Richard Lyman, two other strong
presidents, suited their eras.
Sterling, president from 1949
until 1968, helped define Stanford
in the early stages of its rise into
national prominence, Hastorf said,
while Lyman played an important
role in steadying the University
during the riots of the late '60s and
early '70s.
Lyman, Hastorf said, "was a bit
of a curmudgeon, saying, 'Be care
ful, let's think about that,' and he
was a great president who steadied
us during a difficult time," Hastorf
said.
Kennedy, on the other hand,
"was not a curmudgeon at all, and
was always saying 'Let's go,' " Has
torf said.
Perhaps that dynamism was just
what Stanford needed during the
1980s. The University had already
risen to a certain level of promi
nence, but needed a strong leader
like Kennedy to focus its energies
further.
"The world is full of institutions
that tend toward inertia,"
McManus said, but what they need
is "certain kinds of leaders to give
the institution a big shove."
