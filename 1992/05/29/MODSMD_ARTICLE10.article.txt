Perot wouldn't appoint gays to Cabinet
WASHINGTON (AP) — Ross Perot, poised to launch an indepen
dent presidential campaign, said in an interview to be broadcast today
that he would not appoint a homosexual to certain Cabinet posts.
Asked whether he would have "an admitted homosexual" on
his staff, Perot said, "There are certain places I think where it
would be, you know, very difficult."
Perot's comments came in an interview with Barbara Walters
for ABC's "20/20" program to be broadcast today.
When Walters asked if he would have someone in such Cabinet
posts as secretary jqf defense, treasury or education, Perot said,
"No,, I don't want anybody there that will be at a point of contro
versy with the American people. It will distract from the work to
be done ..."
However, he said "as far as I'm concerned what people do in
their private lives is their business."
Asked whether homosexuals should be in the military, Perot
replied, "I don't think that's realistic."
The Human Rights Campaign Fund, a gay and lesbian political
organization, described Perot's remarks as "very disturbing."
