# Need for speed drives freshman auto-racing star
## She skipped the prom to see Indy 500; now she's gearing up for the big-time 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
Don't let Kathryn Johnson fool
you. She claims that speed turns
her on, but the reverse is true —
she turns on the speed.
The freshman from Clearwa
ter, Florida has been racing cars
since age 16, and at 18 is still, to
her knowledge, the youngest
female driver in the country regis
tered with the Sports Car Club of
America.
On her 16th birthday, after
"barely eeking past the examina
tion" for her driver's license,
Johnson's parents presented her
with her first car — a red 1972
Porsche 91 lE. The daughter of an
instructor at the Porsche driving
school in Sebring, Florida, she
was on the track in no time, mak
ing a name for herself.
"The first time I was out on the
track, the first lap I took, two
weeks after I turned 16, I spun
out," Johnson said. "And there's
a two spin rule on my track. If you
spin twice you're off the track for
the day.
"This was my first session,
first time ever, and I already
spun," she said, proving wrong
the assumption that she would
drive more slowly and stay in con
trol because she was a girl. "So
they nicknamed me 'Spin.' "
Being a woman in a male-dom
inated sport has made Johnson a
determined, defiant fighter, and
has given her a unique perspec
tive on the racing scene.

'The first time I
was out on the
track, the first lap I
took, two weeks
after I turned 16,1
spun out.'

Her recent experience at Skip
Barber Racing School — she
opted out of being a debutante in
order to go there — provided her
with plenty of stories of sexist
treatment.
"There were about four women
in the class and 25 men, and I
really hate male-dominated sports
because men really tick me off
when they get that attitude like,
'Oh, you're a woman, you can't do
anything.' "
From the first day — when she
almost got thrown out of the lock
er room for trying to get her rac
ing suit — to the last, when she

was the only driver not to spin out
in a race simulation, she gradual
ly won the respect of her male
cohorts.
"At first, they wouldn't ask me
how to go through turns," John
son said. "I mean, this is a school,
a place for learning. They'd ask
other guys in the class, 'So what's
your line through this turn?' . . .
Finally, after they saw that I
could actually drive, they started
to approach me and ask me
things."
It helped that Johnson had
been well-prepared for some of
the things taught at the school,
such as "heeling-and-toeing," a
method of controlling both the
brake and accelerator pedals with
one foot.
"When they were teaching
heel-and-toe, they were like,
'Okay, honey, can you handle
this? Do you know how to drive
stick?' " she said. "Actually, I was
one of the better people there
doing heel-and-toe, because my
father (had) taught me how to do
it.
"You know, usually dads come
home and they're like, 'Well,
honey, what'd you get at the
mall?' But my father comes home
one day and he's like, 'I'm gonna
teach you how to heel-and-toe.' "
Johnson gives her father much
of the credit for her interests in
competitive sports and her depar
ture from the typical teenage
girl's lifestyle. "I skipped my
senior prom to go see the Indy
500," she said.
Judging from Johnson's back
ground, it seems like she was des
tined to race cars. Not only is her
father a driving instructor, but a
close friend of her family is Nigel
Mansell, one of Formula One's
top drivers.
Years before she entertained
thoughts of sliding a 911 through
the esses of Sebring or Sears
Point, Johnson once rode in a go
cart when she was 11. "I got a
plaque for being the fastest per
son of the day," she says."It was
an omen."
At age 15, she began to feel the
need for speed — and it has
burned within her ever since.
"Some guy who was a really
good race car driver was also affil
iated with the club," Johnson
said. "I went through the course
with him in his turbocharged 944.
When I got out of the car I was
like, 'That was the best experi
ence I've ever had in my entire
life.'
"So the guy walks up to my
father . . . and he says 'Well, you
can be proud to say that your
daughter is a virgin.' So of course
that comes up at every dinner

party."
Even before that ride, Johnson
had always been extremely com
petitive. She played soccer and
volleyball for years. This year, she
joined the Stanford fencing team
as a novice. She also likes to draw
and paint "H.R. Giger-esque

scenes."
"I like getting my frustrations
out in anything I do. . . . I was
always into aggressive sports.
Like let's-hurt-the-other-person
sports," she said.
But she has found racing to be
the perfect focal point for her

competitive energies, and she
hopes to work her way up through
the ranks to the big-time. She
even relishes the extra challenges
she will no doubt encounter
because she is female.

'I like getting my
frustrations out in
anything Id 0.... I
was always into
aggressive sports.
Like let's-hurt-the
other-person
sports.'

"I would also love to instruct if
I could," she says. "There are five
levels at my driving school back
home — one being [beginner], five
being instructor. They just won't
put me up in level four. ... I think
it's got a lot to do with my age, but
more to do with my gender."
But she has also found her gen
der to be a help in some situa
tions. Johnson claimed that being
female can be useful in getting
out of speeding tickets.
"I just turn on the dumb
blonde: 'Oh officer, I don't know
how to drive this big bad car, and
I don't know what I'm doing, and
if you give me a ticket my parents
will take it away, and . ..
But even as a woman, Johnson
can't seem to convince her fellow
residents in Granada that she is a
safe driver. Her own car has yet to
be shipped to California, and she
has had difficulty borrowing vehi
cles.
"A friend of mine has a 944
Cabriolet. Two nights ago I said,
'So, will ya gimme the keys?' He
let me drive it. I was going, like,
100 on Page Mill. Nobody else will
let me drive their car," she said.
But even though she admits
that she drives fast, Johnson also
says that her racing skills have
saved her life at times on the road.
She describes one experience
when another car was forced out
of opposing traffic into her lane
on the metal grating of a draw
bridge.
Johnson used the technique of
threshold braking to slow down
on the slick grating so that she
could tuck herself safely behind a
car In the right lane.
So Johnson particularly appre
ciates racing skills like threshold
braking. But the primary appeal
of racing to her is a simple one:
it's fun.
"It's the best thing my parents
have ever introduced to me ....
The rush is incredible. It's break
neck speed. You have to drive
right on the edge."
