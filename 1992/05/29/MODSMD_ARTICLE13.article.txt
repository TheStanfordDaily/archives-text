Dianne Feinstein, the former
mayor of San Francisco, and Marin
congresswoman Barbara Boxer are
leading candidates in the state's
unprecedented two-seat Senate race.
Never before in U.S. history have
two women been on the verge of
sweeping a state's Senate delega
tion, and never before have women's
rights issues so flavored the
nation's political environment.
Seven months ago, women lead
ers across the country vowed elec
toral victory to prevent the humilia
tion of another Clarence Thomas
confirmation spectacle.
Women in Senate primaries this
year have already made important
gains. In Illinois, Carol Mosely
Braun upset incumbent Senator
Alan Dixon,' and in Pennsylvania,
Lynn Yeakel won the Democratic
primary. Both of the winning candi
dates used the Senate Judiciary
Committee's treatment of Anita
Hill as a campaign issue.
For many of the 19 women in
Senate races nationwide, even this
stunning momentum will not help.
There are too many women with rel
atively short political resumes run
ning against powerful incumbents.
But Feinstein and Boxer's political
credentials are unmatched among

California's Senate candidates.
Feinstein, for one, nearly became
California's governor. The former San
Francisco mayor had the race pulled
from her grasp by Pete Wilson's
massive absentee ballot campaign.
Early morning on Nov. 7, 1990,
conceding the race to Wilson before
her crushed supporters, Feinstein
held herself like one of Heming
way's heroic lead characters —
graceful under pressure — and
spoke of her intention to continue
working in public service.
Her intensity at that moment
foretold her intentions to run for
the Senate, and also proved her
unflappable character.
In the Democratic primary, Fein
stein faces Gray Davis, the respected
but unspectacular state controller.
In November's general-election
battle for the two-year Senate seat,
Feinstein will face John Seymour,
the real-estate tycoon Wilson placed
in his old Senate job, or the Jesse
Helms of the West — gay, foreigner
and woman-bashing Republican
Congressman William Dannemeyer.
Feinstein — who is pro-choice,
opposes offshore oil drilling and sup
ports a hand-gun waiting period — is
the Californian who most deserves to
be in the Senate.
Boxer, herself an active abortion
rights supporter and environmen
talist, has a much tougher election
battle for the six-year Senate seat,. In
the primary, she faces Lieutenant
Governor Leo McCarthy and Con
gressman Mel Levine, oach with
impressive Democratic credentials.
If Boxer can emerge from the
Democratic muddle, she will likely
see a fierce challenge by Stanford
Law Prof, and Congressman Tom
Campbell in the general election.
But Boxer is the more brash,
action-oriented candidate. She has,
for instance, vowed to be Helms'
"worst nightmare." And her rabble
rousing feminism would breathe life
into Washington's tiresome gridlock.
California voters have an opportu
nity Tuesday to endorse the cam
paigns of two highly qualified women
candidates for the U.S. Senate.
