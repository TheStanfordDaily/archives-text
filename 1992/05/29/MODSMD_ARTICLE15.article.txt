AFRICA IS ON its way to democra
cy, with long-standing, intransi
gent one-party regimes falling, in
favor of tolerant, multiparty systems of
governance.
In his recent address at Stanford,
Assistant Secretary of State for African
Affairs Herman Cohen cited the growing
number of functioning multiparty democ
racies in this continent of 53 countries.
Prospects for peace and conflict reso
lution thus seem hopeful. Yet, in African
nations such as Liberia, recent years
have not witnessed the smooth transition
to democracy, but horror-stricken, dead
ly, destructive war.
Liberia was declared an independent
republic in 1847 by former American
slaves who began arriving under the
aegis of the American Colonization Soci
ety in 1821. The Americano-Liberians set
themselves up as an elite, adopted West
ern values, and dominated the majority
indigenous population, who had inhabit
ed the region for centuries.
Hope for change after the 1980 coup
d'etat soured after the rise of the corrupt,
brutal U.S.-supported dictatorship of
Sergeant Samuel Doe. He gave favorable
treatment to members of his minute
Krahn ethnicity, stole elections and a
large portion of state funds, harassed his
opposition, and carried out genocidal
repression against certain rival groups.
Former official Charles Taylor began

an uprising in 1989 that eventually led to
Doe's fall and subsequent death the fol
lowing year, but massive fighting has
continued. The war has resulted in over
35,000 deaths, as well as a quarter of the
country's four million people displaced,
property damage worth billions of dol
lars, and the destruction of the once
prosperous economy. Many Liberians in
the Bay Area emotionally describe the
death of family members in the war.
The joint West African ECOWAS
forces, sent to Liberia to establish peace
under an interim government, have
gained the upper hand in the fighting,
forcing the previously-intransigeant
Charles Taylor to negotiate and raising
hopes for an end to the fighting, admit
Cohen and Sylvester Drbodo Kaar, a
prominent member of the Bay Area's
Liberian community.
But the electoral process cannot begin
until Taylor's troops are disarmed, which
could take months, or longer. Leading
candidates have been killed, and a wide
range of parties has recently emerged,
none possessing clear majority support.
Both Cohen and Kaar emphasize the
importance of the U.S.-Liberian relation
ship, criticizing the State Department's
former cold-war policy of providing mil
lions of dollars in military support to arm
the corrupt Doe regime, which systemat
ically violated human rights but was seen
as a protector of their interests.

Kaar is disappointed that the American
press has depicted the conflict as a "tribal
war," with its true political nature, and
U.S. responsibility in the conflict, down
played. Many Liberians argue for
decreased American political involvement,
given past U.S. policies and its inability to
elicit the resignation of the little-educated
Doe, which would have averted the ensu
ing bloodbath.
But Cohen believes that Liberians will
maintain a privileged position in Wash
ington, due to their large community in
the U.S. and the two nations' historic
ties. Joe S. Kappia, a local Liberian jour
nalist and high school teacher, favors
cooperation between the Liberian and
American peoples on a non-governmental
level, in the rebuilding of schools, clinics,
hospitals, business infrastructure.
Even Stanford may have a role. Stan
ford graduates include intellectuals such as
the president of the University of Liberia,
Dr. Patrick L.N. Seyon. Enhanced contact
with Stanford could enhance the future
prosperity of what many hope will be one
of the world's newest genuine democracies.
