## Condoms not perfect protection; only reduce AIDS risk 
### 
A STUDY BY the Center for Disease
Control presents a very scary sce
nario: one in 100 high school stu
dents in areas such as New York and
Miami were infected with the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which
leads to AIDS.
Two to three times as many 21-year
olds as 15-year olds were also found to
be infected! ("Studies show AIDS
spreading among Teens," The Oregoni
an, October 8, 1989).
Out of concern for our campus, we
would like to present some conclusions
from more than a decade of worldwide
scientific research on HIV and condom
reliability as well as information on the
legal ramifications of promoting condom
use as protection against HIV.
1) The reliability of condoms is ques
tionable before they arrive on the retail
shelf. The Federal Drug Administration
states that condoms should be stored
between 59 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit,
but condoms are sometimes exposed to

extreme temperatures (up to 160
degrees Fahrenheit) and extreme humid
ity during transportation.
2) Even if condoms arrive in good con
dition, there is reason to believe that
they will not be effective against HIV
infection. The natural pores in latex con
doms span 1.5 microns in diameter,
which is small enough to stop sperm (3-5
microns) but not HIV (0.1 microns).
Even the FDA no longer promotes con
doms as a protective means against HIV
infection, but now only states, "Condoms
offer an element of risk reduction."
3) Individuals and organizations can
be held liable for the "wrongful death"
of someone infected with HIV who used
condoms based on their recommenda
tion. This includes anyone who assumes
an official capacity (e.g., resident assis
tants, resident fellows, Cowell coun
selors) as well as organizations (such as
Stanford University) that lead others to
an unjustifiable reliance on condoms
based on a substantial certainty of HIV

protection. ("The condom: Is it really
safe?" by Richard Smith, published by
The Public Education Committee on
Children and Youth, 1989).
4) AIDS is not a disease of homosexu
al men and intravenous drug users. Now
70 percent of people infected with HIV
worldwide are believed to have caught it
from their heterosexual partners. HIV is
spreading faster among high school and
college students than it ever did among
the male homosexual community.
("Straight Sex and AIDS Vaccines," Dis
cover, January 1992).
Our concern is not only the false
assurance people are getting from con
doms against HIV, but also the growing
beliefs that parental influence is negligi
ble and that abstinence is unrealistic.
In fact, "As late as 1976, most
teenagers were still virgins. ... We cannot
dismiss as impossible what actually hap
pened until very recent years." ("The Big
Lie," Thomas Sowell, Forbes, Dec., 1991).
Sex is a desire that each person has

the responsibility to control. Don't begin
a relationship thinking that premarital
sex will be a logical step in its develop
ment. It's not.
Last, if you've participated in high
risk behavior, get tested! Yes, getting
tested is scary, but do it anyway. Why?
Because the sooner you find out, the
sooner you can receive optimal medical
care, prevent opportunistic infections
and delay disease progressions.
And most importantly, you can avoid
infecting others. If you really care about
someone, realize the death-risk that you
are putting them in, and get tested.
