# University's support of Row houses lacking
## 
### 
We, as members of the Phi Sig house,
would like to respond to the negative
exposure it received in the May 26's
Daily article about the Draw. As a house,
we resent the assertion that "Phi Sig. ..
had 'a significant problem' luring stu
dents." While it is unclear whether Phi
Sig even has a responsibility to 'lure'
students, there is no doubt as to why
Phi Sig went so low in the Draw.
First, the rooms are small one-room
doubles. Last year, the Row asked Phi
Sig what co .; Id be done to improve its
position in the Draw. The answer came:
"New paint, new lighting, new furniture
and turn some of the small doubles into
singles."

The University must have agreed to
these improvements, as the first three
requests were granted; yet, people still
choose not to place Phi Sig on their
Draw card, given room options else
where.
Second, the University, while increas
ing 'hotel' residences elsewhere on cam
pus, has shown little commitment to the
Row. The rent is higher for Row houses,
despite the fact that the houses are not
cleaned by University employees and that
computer resources are non-existent.
When the University does not fill the
house — which is already small at 26 —
the few remaining members must pay an
unreasonably large board bill for the
house's fixed costs, with no support
from the University. The University also
fails to pay for the Row Faire, which is
the Row's main chance to advertise to
the student body.

We would like to emphasize that this
problem is not limited to Phi Sig, but
touches all small Row houses. Who
might care if a small house continually
ranks at the bottom of student prefer
ences? One might note that the Draw
book excluded Row house descriptions
for all non-theme/focus houses; no won
der no one selected Phi Sig.
The systematic downfall of an entire
style of dorm housing is much more
problematic, however. To allow this
downfall and to place the responsibility
on the residents of these houses is dis
turbing at best and reprehensible at
worst.
We were unaware that the responsi
bility of filling the residences falls on the
shoulders of the renters and not those of
the landlord, as Bill Georges, acting
director of the Housing Center, implies
in his advice that the house that weren't

in demand this year should "work hard
er," "reach out to students" and "visit
dorms."
Phi Sig is an excellent place to live,
and we hope that those who have been
so "unfortunate" to draw in will choose
to live here. The food is great, it is con
tinually the cleanest Row house, people
spend time together, the house has a
weekly barbeque and cliques are practi
cally unheard of.
Perhaps the University has over
looked the value of offering its students
a chance to manage their own resi
dences, while simultaneously offering
administrative savings to the University
Phi Sig house does not need to lure any
body; it needs to be given equal treat
ment by the University.
