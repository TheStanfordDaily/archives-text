## Freshman criticizes Black Student Union's agenda, leadership 
### 
ONCE AGAIN, THE Black Student
Union has shown the hypocrisy
and ignorance that has become
central to the multicultural groups here
at Stanford. Allyson Dickson's letter is
not only incorrect, it is as racist as the
views that the BSU supposedly tries to
dispel.
The problem with the multicultural
experience is not the lack of cooperation
and tolerance on the part of those with a
"silver spoon" in their mouths, nor is it the
ineffectiveness of Residential Education.
The problem is the way that groups
like the BSU present themselves to the
rest of Stanford.

The privileged, white youth of Stan
ford can be led to the multicultural river
by Res Ed, but they cannot be made to
drink. In order for them to drink, the
BSU and the black students will have to
to offer something other than intimida
tion and anger.
As a black freshman, I wonder how a
white person should feel when they see a
black person wearing a shirt that says
"It's a black thing, you wouldn't under
stand." Not only would he be intimidat
ed by the coldness of the shirt's message,
but he would not want to "understand."
Dickson's allegations and mindless
ranting and raving against the white

community are simply emblematic of the
lack of diplomacy that the BSU is known
for. Her remarks do not cause whites to
be more receptive to multiculturalism —
they cause them to be more defensive.
Dickson (and she is not alone) does
nothing but reinforce the Stanford
stereotype for the angry black too
wrapped up in the black cause to listen
objectively to critics. The BSU should not
label blacks who criticize them as "sell
outs." If "selling out" can be defined as
not helping the black cause, then those
who refuse to listen to constructive criti
cism are the true "sell-outs."
In order for the BSU to have a posi-

tive purpose, it must stop spreading the
blame and start spreading positive
images of blacks. If the BSU is curious
as to why it barely received its fee
request, just read how Dickson comes
across in her letter. It is too easy to dis
miss the poor race relations at Stanford
as racism on the part of whites.
It is about time for blacks to realize
that they cannot continue or afford to
blame whites for all their woes.
If we at Stanford are to be truly mul
ticultural rather than simply practice
the vernacular, it is time for blacks to
get off their Tve-been-so-oppressed'
high horse and deal with the real world.

Do not expect the real world to be so
sensitive to your predicament. By being
so exclusive, blacks only hurt their cause
and add to their plight. I understand the
need for black unity but I do not see the
need for black separatism. They are one
and the same at Stanford.
By indicting whites, Dickson does
nothing but alienate blacks, and unfor
tunately, the blacks are the ones who are
losing out. The BSU's behavior should
help further its goal, not impede it.
Leaders like Dickson are definitely an
impediment.
