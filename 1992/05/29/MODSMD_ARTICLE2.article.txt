# Kennedy defends University's generous lease to Bookstore

The University provides the Stan
ford Bookstore with a generous lease in
part because the store "serves program
matic needs" at Stanford, University
President Donald Kennedy told the
Faculty Senate yesterday.
The discussion arose during a report
by History Prof. Peter Stansky, presi
dent of the Bookstore's board of direc
tors, and Law Prof. Robert Weisberg,
the board's spokesman, on the Book
store's reform of its business practices.
The current lease agreement
requires the Bookstore to pay one per
cent of sales on certain items to rent its
main campus site, a payment that was
less than $40,000 in 1990-91. Industry
officials say the right to manage a book
store on that site could be worth more
than $3 million.

Kennedy said Stanford occasionally
grants favorable leases in order "to
serve program-related purposes in the
University." For example, the Universi
ty grants generous terms on faculty
housing and to certain research labora
tories, Kennedy said.
"In a number of areas we have and
will continue to permit shortfalls in
possible lease revenue to occur to serve
these other programmatic purposes,"
Kennedy said.
But Weisberg said the Bookstore
may at some time in the future decide
to share more of its revenue with the
University, although the the board will
not consider the issue before the con
clusion of the state attorney general's
ongoing investigation of the Book
store's business practices.
"It was clear from the start of this
investigation that one of the long-term
jobs of the board would be to think

what to do with the Bookstore's
income," Weisberg said.
That income is "obviously not incon
sequential," Weisberg said, estimating
later in the meeting that it is "several
million dollars" per year. "One of the
problems is what to do with that
income. There may be ways to give that
money back to the University."
In addition to supporting the Uni
versity by paying more rent, the board
may also consider increasing rebates
and lowering prices at the store, Weis
berg said. But larger rebates and dis
counts raise "redistributional ques
tions" which make them unwieldy
alternatives, he added.
Any such move would be "an extra
and gratuitous expenditure by the
Bookstore" because it would consist of
"offering money which we're not legal-
