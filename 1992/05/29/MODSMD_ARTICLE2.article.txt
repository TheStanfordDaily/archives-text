# Kennedy defends University's generous lease to Bookstore
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
The University provides the Stan
ford Bookstore with a generous lease in
part because the store "serves program
matic needs" at Stanford, University
President Donald Kennedy told the
Faculty Senate yesterday.
The discussion arose during a report
by History Prof. Peter Stansky, presi
dent of the Bookstore's board of direc
tors, and Law Prof. Robert Weisberg,
the board's spokesman, on the Book
store's reform of its business practices.
The current lease agreement
requires the Bookstore to pay one per
cent of sales on certain items to rent its
main campus site, a payment that was
less than $40,000 in 1990-91. Industry
officials say the right to manage a book
store on that site could be worth more
than $3 million.

Kennedy said Stanford occasionally
grants favorable leases in order "to
serve program-related purposes in the
University." For example, the Universi
ty grants generous terms on faculty
housing and to certain research labora
tories, Kennedy said.
"In a number of areas we have and
will continue to permit shortfalls in
possible lease revenue to occur to serve
these other programmatic purposes,"
Kennedy said.
But Weisberg said the Bookstore
may at some time in the future decide
to share more of its revenue with the
University, although the the board will
not consider the issue before the con
clusion of the state attorney general's
ongoing investigation of the Book
store's business practices.
"It was clear from the start of this
investigation that one of the long-term
jobs of the board would be to think

what to do with the Bookstore's
income," Weisberg said.
That income is "obviously not incon
sequential," Weisberg said, estimating
later in the meeting that it is "several
million dollars" per year. "One of the
problems is what to do with that
income. There may be ways to give that
money back to the University."
In addition to supporting the Uni
versity by paying more rent, the board
may also consider increasing rebates
and lowering prices at the store, Weis
berg said. But larger rebates and dis
counts raise "redistributional ques
tions" which make them unwieldy
alternatives, he added.
Any such move would be "an extra
and gratuitous expenditure by the
Bookstore" because it would consist of
"offering money which we're not legal-
Iy required to expend right now,"
Weisberg said.
Stansky agreed, "From the
point of the Bookstore, we're ful
filling our obligation."
Several faculty members
expressed concern during the
meeting about the lease agree
ment and the disposition of the
Bookstore's income.
Mary Pratt, a professor of
Spanish and Portuguese, asked
jokingly "if there is any way we
could transfer faculty billets to
the Bookstore."
In an address to the senate on
the history of the Bookstore and
its compensation practices, Stan
sky said those problems resulted
from the failure of the Book
store's governance "to keep up"
with the Bookstore's growth.

"The members of the board did
not have a true sense of their
tasks," Stansky said. "We
thought of ourselves, inaccurate
ly, as members of a University
committee whose obligation was
to reflect the concerns of the com
munity and to set general policy.
We were not, as we should have
been, an administrative board."
Stansky said the board mem
bers "set [the managers'J salaries
but were unaware of other perks
other than the house in Twain
Harte . . . which certainly we
shouldn't have allowed."
He also lauded General Manag
er Eldon Speed and Assistant Gen
eral Manager Philip Chiaramonte,
as well as former board president
Jack Friedenthal, for their "vision
and accomplishment" in making
the store "the best college book
store in the country."
Weisberg described the board's
current reforms. In addition to
terminating many of the

perquisites enjoyed by senior
employees the board will expand
its size to 11 and possibly 15
members, including outside legal
and financial experts.
"We hope that the attorney
general will see these actions that
the board has taken and is plan
ning to take as sufficient," Weis
berg said.
Senate members also applauded
Weisberg, a recent addition to the
Bookstore's board, for his work dur
ing the last few months. Kennedy
said, "Bob Weisberg undertook to
be the main solver of a problem
which he didn't create. I think he
has performed magnificently."
The Daily disclosed in Febru
ary that the Bookstore's senior
management enjoyed a host of
lavish perquisites, including luxu
ry automobiles and use of a vaca
tion home that the Bookstore
rents from a consulting firm
owned by Speed and Chiara
monte.
