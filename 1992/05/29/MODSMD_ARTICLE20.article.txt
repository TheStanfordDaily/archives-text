# Responding to the call for stranger wariness

"Hello," she addressed me in a tone
one would use toward a shivering little
boy at a circus who just dropoed a Sno-
Cone in his Underoos. I was sitting on
my Star Wars comforter, surrounded by
plush pillows and stuffed animals.
She may have been perfectly harmless
— a woman, three thousand miles away
at the other end of the telephone line.

Even though I couldn't see her, I was
sure her head was tilted unnaturally to
one side or the other.
When I picked up the phone, my first
thought was, "This is so incredible." My
second thought was, "Oh, God, I'm in
my room. . . alone!" I angrily dismissed
this second thought, and desperately
tried to speak. She addressed me again,
but I was too quick for her, and before
she could utter another threatening
word, I slammed the receiver down. My
mother hasn't harassed me since.
I read Sharon Beaulaurier's letter in

May 27 Daily and shared it with all of my
male friends. Since we never talk to
women and always cock our heads (very
naturally) to the right when they pass, we
know that, while we are not part of the
problem, we feel we can be part of the
solution. We offer these suggestions to
ease you through the ominous world that
awaits you after Stanford.
1) Stay indoors as often as possible. If
you must go out, bring at least three
female escorts, armed to the teeth. If a
male passerby be so menacing as to bid
you good day,, do not hesitate to kill him.

2) The violent undertones of the word
"hello" must cause many women such as
yourself undue stress. Boycott any
artist, such as Lionel Richie or The
Doors, who have had the gross insensi
tivity to incorporate the "h" word into
their songs. Also boycott any networks
that air such insidious programs as "H —
-o, Larry!" and theaters who have the
gall to present sexist propaganda such as
"H—o, Dolly!" (I'm sure you can imag
ine how Dolly must have felt.)
3) Don't trust anyone, especially your
parents. Every parent is a potential child

molester, and should be feared and
avoided at all costs.
If you can arrange it somehow, stay
at Stanford for the rest of your life. In
the cruel and uncaring world outside,
your views will be seen as paranoid and
unrealistic.
Strangers still address one another,
and cordiality remains an accepted prac
tice.
