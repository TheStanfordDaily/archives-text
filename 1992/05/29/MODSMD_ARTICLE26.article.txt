# President's wife maintains own campus identity
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
She got her B.A. in political
science from Stanford in 1968,
graduated from Stanford Law
School in 1978 and has worked
at Stanford since 1980 — Robin
Hamill Kennedy has more Stan
ford connections than her Har
vard-educated husband.
But when she married Donald
Kennedy in the fall of 1987, sev
eral months after he had
divorced his first wife, she was
hurt by the rumors that began
swirling within the community
shortly afterwards — rumors
demeaning her as Kennedy's
"secretary."
The experience was a painful
one, Robin Kennedy said. "I
learned something about gos
sip," she said. "The gossip mill
will spread any rumor regardless
of how preposterous."
Among the rumors that Robin
said she heard were "one that
had me pregnant from Don for
about 30 months" and another
that a friend's daughter was
actually Robin's child by Donald.
All the hostility — the let
ters, middle-of-the-night phone
calls, refusals to shake her hand
— only completely stopped
about two years later, she said.
And her marriage to Presi
dent Kennedy was trying for
another reason — she had to give
up her job as the University's
real estate director.
A number of administrators
worried that if the president
were associated with the position
— which had the power to deter
mine who could use Stanford
land — he might be dragged into
"a political hotseat," she said.
The position was "very visible
and influential," Robin Kennedy
said. "Professionally, I was
incredibly content and fulfilled."
But shortly after the
announcement of the engage
ment, she was approached "by a
senior member of the adminis
tration who told me he was
speaking on behalf of himself
and other vice presidents."
"Their suggestion was that I
relinquish my position," she
said. "He said my professional
prominence — associated with

all those real estate issues —
could be harmful to Don and his
presidency."
Robin Kennedy said she final
ly decided to take his advice to
quit her job because she "wanted
to be sure that nothing having to
do with me could ever hurt
[President Kennedy] or hurt the
institution that I love so much."
She then took the position as
senior university counsel in the
Legal Office that she holds now.
Expressing some regret at giving
up her original job, she said that
she's "no longer persuaded that
Hoover Tower would have fallen
over if I had stayed at that job."
Despite being known mainly
as the wife of the Stanford presi
dent, Robin Kennedy said she
has not felt overshadowed by
Donald.
"Within the Stanford commu
nity, I have a life of my own that
preceded my marriage to Don,"
she said. "I don't feel that I'm
looked at just as Don's wife
(within Stanford)."
She said she puts a lot of effort
into separating her role as the
president's wife from her profes
sional job in the Legal Office.
"My workday is my workday,"
she said. "It's sacrosanct. From
8 a.m. to 6 p.m., I belong to this
office."
Today, after five years of
being in the public eye, Robin
Kennedy said she is looking for
ward to returning to private life.
With 75 events per year to
host at their home, the
Kennedys had to get used to
sharing everything — especially
their lutchen, which is used by
half a dozen caterers — with
everybody. "We've gotten used
to a level of chaos and a lack of
control of our space," Robin said.
Hoover House is "a Universi
ty building so it's treated like a
University building," she said.
"People just open the doors and
come in. The UPS man just
comes in and drops off parcels in
the hall and uses the bathroom."
The Kennedys are moving out
of Hoover house this summer,
after President Kennedy formal
ly resigns.
"I'm looking forward to a
white-picket-fence existence,"
Robin said.

Kennedy in the fall of 1987, sev
eral months after he had
divorced his first wife, she was
hurt by the rumors that began
swirling within the community
shortly afterwards — rumors
demeaning her as Kennedy's
"secretary."
The experience was a painful
one, Robin Kennedy said. "I
learned something about gos
sip," she said. "The gossip mill
will spread any rumor regardless
of how preposterous."
Among the rumors that Robin
said she heard were "one that
had me pregnant from Don for
about 30 months" and another
that a friend's daughter was
actually Robin's child by Donald.
All the hostility — the let
ters, middle-of-the-night phone
calls, refusals to shake her hand
— only completely stopped
about two years later, she said.
And her marriage to Presi
dent Kennedy was trying for
another reason — she had to give
up her job as the University's
real estate director.
A number of administrators
worried that if the president
were associated with the position
— which had the power to deter
mine who could use Stanford
land — he might be dragged into
"a political hotseat," she said.
The position was "very visible
and influential," Robin Kennedy
said. "Professionally, I was
incredibly content and fulfilled."
But shortly after the
announcement of the engage
ment, she was approached "by a
senior member of the adminis
tration who told me he was
speaking on behalf of himself
and other vice presidents."
"Their suggestion was that I
relinquish my position," she
said. "He said my professional
prominence — associated with

all those real estate issues —
could be harmful to Don and his
presidency."
Robin Kennedy said she final
ly decided to take his advice to
quit her job because she "wanted
to be sure that nothing having to
do with me could ever hurt
[President Kennedy] or hurt the
institution that I love so much."
She then took the position as
senior university counsel in the
Legal Office that she holds now.
Expressing some regret at giving
up her original job, she said that
she's "no longer persuaded that
Hoover Tower would have fallen
over if I had stayed at that job."
Despite being known mainly
as the wife of the Stanford presi
dent, Robin Kennedy said she
has not felt overshadowed by
Donald.
"Within the Stanford commu
nity, I have a life of my own that
preceded my marriage to Don,"
she said. "I don't feel that I'm
looked at just as Don's wife
(within Stanford)."
She said she puts a lot of effort
into separating her role as the
president's wife from her profes
sional job in the Legal Office.
"My workday is my workday,"
she said. "It's sacrosanct. From
8 a.m. to 6 p.m., I belong to this
office."
Today, after five years of
being in the public eye, Robin
Kennedy said she is looking for
ward to returning to private life.
With 75 events per year to
host at their home, the
Kennedys had to get used to
sharing everything — especially
their lutchen, which is used by
half a dozen caterers — with
everybody. "We've gotten used
to a level of chaos and a lack of
control of our space," Robin said.
Hoover House is "a Universi
ty building so it's treated like a
University building," she said.
"People just open the doors and
come in. The UPS man just
comes in and drops off parcels in
the hall and uses the bathroom."
The Kennedys are moving out
of Hoover house this summer,
after President Kennedy formal
ly resigns.
"I'm looking forward to a
white-picket-fence existence,"
Robin said.

When Robin Hamill Kennedy married Donald Kennedy in 1987, she had
to change University jobs and endure two years of nasty rumors about
the marriage. Nevertheless, she says she has been able to maintain her
own identity at Stanford: "I don't feel that I'm looked at just as Don's wife."
