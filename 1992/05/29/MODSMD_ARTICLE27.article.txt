## The 						end of a dream year 
### 
What was, and what could have been. That is
Stanford athletics '91-'92 in retrospect.
The Cardinal brought home five national champi
onships this year, tying the national record set by
UCLA in 1981V82. There are two ways to look at
that number five: (a) Stanford could have won more
titles; and (b) fans should be happy that the Card
managed to win what it did. Both are correct.
The key word to describe Stanford sports this year
was competitive. In virtually every sport, the Cardi
nal was among the best. Along the way came some
disappointments and some unexpected surprises.

Near misses
Four teams had championships in their sight, but
came up just a little bit short. Nevertheless, in every
other sense besides the literal sense of the word, they
were champions.
In terms of sheer power, none could argue with
the play of the Cardinal volleyball teams this year.
The women's team was ranked No. 1 throughout the
entire season, and the men's team was nearly flaw
less in the tough WIVA. Both were winners — and
both almost won it all.
The women's tennis team's dynasty ended on the
home courts of Stanford Tennis Stadium just a few
short weeks ago. But the young squad should come
back fired up to make it seven-out-of-the-last-eight
titles by this time next year.
As for the Card nine, there was little joy in Talla
hassee after a strong second place finish in the Six-
Pac and a good season. The bats came up empty on
the second day of play at the South II regional. Stan
ford was just a few wins shy of the College World
Series in Omaha — and another NCAA plaque for
the Farm.
Pleasant presents
The women's basketball team took their game to
another level in what many predicted to be a
"rebuilding" year. Thank God that no one told Val
Whiting and Molly Goodenbour. The two juniors led
a team with only one senior to the promised land,
knocking off many solid teams (including No.l Vir
ginia in the NCAA semis) en route. A nice bonus ban
ner thus takes its place in the Maples Pavilion
rafters, with a matching cousin expected to hang
beside it after next season.
The men's tennis team rose above expectations to
win a team championship, dominating the tourna
ment in Athens, Ga. In the semifinals and finals, the
combined margin of victory was a convincing 10-1.
To lop it off, Stanford swept the individual portion of
the events as well, winning both the singles (Alex
O'Brien) and doubles (O'Brien-Chris Cocotos)
crown.

Among the best
Two other teams deserve spe

the Cardinal football team. Denny
Green's squad compiled an
impressive 8-4 record, defeating

quality teams and making a bowl
game appearance for the first
time since 1986. Also, the team

Walsh coming aboard as the new
head coach, it can only get even
better.
The men's basketball team also

The Class of *92
In any group, there are individ
uals who stand out. Especially
this year, there are several that
come to mind: Tommy Vardell,
Chris Walsh, Kristin Klien, Adam
Keefe, Tim Ryan, Alex O'Brien,
Jackie Edwards, Jeffrey Ham
monds (who will probably leave
after this, his junior year) ... we
all should feel lucky that we were
able to watch them play.

David Schwartz, a sophomore,
wants to thank Chip and Nat for all
of their help. Have a nice summer.
