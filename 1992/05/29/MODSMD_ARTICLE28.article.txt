# Another NCAA title?
## Golfers four back after two rounds 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
With the top seven teams within eight
strokes of each other, it's anyone's guess
who'll come out on top in the NCAA
Women's Golf Championships being held
this week in Arizona. Stanford is hanging
tough in fourth place after two rounds of
competition, with two more to go.
San Jose State leads the tournament
with a two-day combined total of 589
strokes. Georgia is right behind with 590,
with the powerhouse Arizona team still
only in third with 591 strokes. Stanford
sits in the fourth-spot with 593 strokes, fol
lowed by Arizona State with 595 strokes.
"The competition is really bunched with
a lot of talent," said Stanford coach Tim
Baldwin. It's not out of the question that
we can win this, but it's not out of the
question that we can finish ninth."
Audrey Wooding has turned in two out
standing rounds of golf, entering today's
round tied for second with 143 strokes,
after shooting a 74 during Thursday's com
petition, placing her three strokes behind
tournament the leader, Arizona's Annika
Sorenstam with 140 strokes. Wooding shot
a 69 to open the tournament, putting her
in a tie for first, and is holding on to a top
three spot.
Freshman Amy Lawrence, usually the
fourth or fifth spot for the Cardinal, has
come on strong in the most important
tourney of the year, shooting a 71 in the
first round and a 75 yesterday, putting her
in seventh place overall. Lawrence had an
amazing performance on the back nine yes
terday, ending on a high note after shoot
ing a 32.
Playing consistent golf on the second
day of NCAA play, Martha Richards is in
21st place with 150 strokes, after hitting a
74 and a 76 in the respective rounds of golf.
Richards faltered out of the blocks yester
day, shooting 40 on the front nine, but
pulled off a comeback with a 34 on the back
nine to keep the Cardinal in the money.
Adele Moore hit an 80 on the first day of
play, finishing up yesterday with a 74.
Moore shot a 34 on the front nine of the
opening round, and a 33 on the back nine
of the second round, foreshadowing her
potential for good play in the final two days
of NCAA competition.

The tournament got off to an unusual
start, with No. 1-seeded Arizona and No. 2-
seeded San Jose State finishing fifth and
fourth, respectively. The teams gained
momentum during the second round of
play, leaving the Cardinal in good shape for
a high team finish, but did not get off to
amazing starts as they have been known to
do this season.
"I'm relieved that they didn't jump out
of the gate on us," said Baldwin after the
first round. "We need to stay in the hunt
tomorrow. As for Friday and Saturday, we
need to stay as rested as we can, because
it's very hot out here."
With Stanford still in a good position in
the team rankings, the Cardinal looks to
perform well in the final two rounds, capi
talizing on the consistency that they have
shown during the spring season.
"It all depends tomorrow on who gets
the breaks and who plays well," said Bald
win of Friday's competition.
Play ends Saturday, finishing off the
spring season for Stanford, upon which the
All-American teams will be picked, for
which a few Cardinal players are in the
running.
