# Transfers will still have to take CIV
## 
### Howard Libit Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate refused to let
transfer students escape the Culture,
Ideas and Values requirement yesterday
afternoon.
The proposal by the committee on
undergraduate studies would have
allowed a transfer student to substitute a
variety of other courses for CIV if the stu
dent did not arrive at Stanford having
taken a comparable class.
Civil Engineering Assoc. Prof. David
Freyberg said the current system has
"led to a number of problems both in and
classroom and out."
"There is an inhibitory effect of having

upperclassmen in a class designed for
fres. men," said Freyberg, chair of the
committee. He a 1 so pointed to the many
comp aintf, from transfer -jtudents due to
the " igniiicant scheduling difficulties in
mixing CTV with upper-level courses
Transfer students who come to SUui
ford withou' having taken a CIV-equiva
lent class must currently take a full year
of CIV. The proposal would have permit
ted transfer students to substitute three
classes from Distribution Requirement
Areas 2, 3, 7, 8 and 9, which involve liter
ature and social sciences similar to CIV.
But many faculty members disagreed
with the proposed change, arguing that
problems with upperclass stu
dents in a class of freshmen can
be handled with good teaching.
What appeared to be the most
convincing argument against the
change was made by Classics
Prof. Marsh McCall and History
Prof. David Kennedy, who said
CIV was intended to be an essen
tial graduation requirement for
everyone.
"CIV is, I dare say, the founda
tion of our undergraduate educa
tion," Kennedy said. "There
should be a heavy default pre
sumption that CIV should apply
to all students . . . and be a uni
form graduation requirement."
In other business, the senate
agreed with a recommendation by
the committee on undergraduate
studies to delay altering the for
eign language requirement for
students.
To strengthen the foreign lan
guage proficiency standards, the
committee is considering a sug
gestion that students no longer
be allowed exemption from the
requirement, even if they took
three years of a language in high
school.
Although the senate appeared
to support the change, Freyberg
said his committee felt it was "a
wrong time to make a change"
because the foreign language
departments are currently being
reviewed by the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
Freyberg also said that the
additional units for a foreign lan
guage as well as the new distribu
tion requirements "would impact
a significant fraction of under
graduates in terms of course
load." Current University poli
cy allows students who have
taken three years of the same for
eign language in high school to be
exempted from the requirement.
Under the proposal, students
would only be exempted from tak
ing one year of a foreign language
if they scored at least a 4 on an
Advanced Placement test or
passed a University proficiency
exam.
The senate did pass a resolu
tion calling for Freyberg's com
mittee to make a "comprehensive
report on the foreign language
requirement" next fall after the
review of the departments is com
pleted.
After the senate finished its
discussion of proposals to change
undergraduate education, it con
sidered an attempt by the com
mittee on graduate studies to
modify the strategy for selection
of oral exam chairs.
But many faculty members
disagreed over the details of a
new process, and the senate
called on English Prof. Albert
Gelpi to return next fall with a
new proposal from his commit
tee.
