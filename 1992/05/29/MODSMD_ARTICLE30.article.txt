### Brian Egan Editorial staff 
Despite some late-season setbacks, the Cardinal
men's and women's cycling squads finished up their
strong 1991-92 season by placing sixth overall at the
National Collegiate Road Championships (NCRC)
held May 16-17 in Rome, Ga.
Stanford raced without the services of Frank
Scioscia, the 1992 Western Collegiate Cycling Con
ference (WCCC) criterium champion, and Becky
Wigglesworth, one of its top women's riders. Scios

cia was biking in Japan at the time of the NCRC.
Wigglesworth, who graduated after winter quarter,
was ineligible to race according to the National Col
legiate Cycling Association regulations despite
retaining her eligibility in WCCC competition.
In the women's road race, National 'B' Team
biker Tracy Pimms timed her sprint up the short,
steep final hill perfectly, winning the 47-mile event
by several bike lengths. Nicole Calakos finished 19th
in the 75-person field.
The men were beset by mechanical problems in
their road race. Andy Tucker led the Cardinal with

his 32nd-place finish.
Both squads performed well at the team trials.
The women's quintet of Pimms, Calakos, Martina
Lauchengco (who was racing with a broken wrist),
Bettina Romer, and Polly Siegel came away with the
bronze medal, 18 seconds off the pace of Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo, and 10 behind runner up UC-
Davis. The men, led by Tucker, Bob Myers, Coulter
Richardson, Jason Tavakolian, and Dayne Wilcox,
placed fifth, about one minute behind field-leader
Colorado.
In the men's and women's criteri
ums, both of which took place in
downtown Rome, Pimms and
Richardson came in fifth in their
respective races, while Romer fin
ished 16th.
Pimms, who was boxed in by
several other racers towards the
end of the women's criterium, fin
ished only one point away from
claiming the omnium champi
onship, which is awarded annual
ly to the best finisher in the road
race and the criterium combined
combined.

Cal Poly took the overall
crown, while Davis finished sec
ond and defending champion Col
orado came in third.
( Both Cardinal teams look to
better their sixth-place finish next
season.
According to Siegel, the
women's squad will remain virtu
ally intact for 1992-93. "All five of
us who went to The Nationals will
be returning next year," Siegel
said. "We have a good shot at
improving next year."
The cycling team will continue
to meet this summer. Outings
begin weekdays at 5 p.m. in front
of the Post Office, and are open to
the entire Stanford community.
