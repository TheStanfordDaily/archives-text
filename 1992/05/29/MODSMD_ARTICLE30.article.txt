Despite some late-season setbacks, the Cardinal
men's and women's cycling squads finished up their
strong 1991-92 season by placing sixth overall at the
National Collegiate Road Championships (NCRC)
held May 16-17 in Rome, Ga.
Stanford raced without the services of Frank
Scioscia, the 1992 Western Collegiate Cycling Con
ference (WCCC) criterium champion, and Becky
Wigglesworth, one of its top women's riders. Scios

cia was biking in Japan at the time of the NCRC.
Wigglesworth, who graduated after winter quarter,
was ineligible to race according to the National Col
legiate Cycling Association regulations despite
retaining her eligibility in WCCC competition.
In the women's road race, National 'B' Team
biker Tracy Pimms timed her sprint up the short,
steep final hill perfectly, winning the 47-mile event
by several bike lengths. Nicole Calakos finished 19th
in the 75-person field.
The men were beset by mechanical problems in
their road race. Andy Tucker led the Cardinal with

his 32nd-place finish.
Both squads performed well at the team trials.
The women's quintet of Pimms, Calakos, Martina
Lauchengco (who was racing with a broken wrist),
Bettina Romer, and Polly Siegel came away with the
bronze medal, 18 seconds off the pace of Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo, and 10 behind runner up UC-
Davis. The men, led by Tucker, Bob Myers, Coulter
Richardson, Jason Tavakolian, and Dayne Wilcox,
placed fifth, about one minute behind field-leader
Colorado.
