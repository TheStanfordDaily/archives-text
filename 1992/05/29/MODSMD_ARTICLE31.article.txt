# Super-recruit Kelsey set to make impact
## 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
When Stanford's women's bas
ketball team crushed Arkansas to
win the 1990 West Regional in
Maples Pavilion en route to its
first national crown, the sellout
crowd chanted its approval of
then-freshman Val Whiting:
"Three more years! Three more
years!"
Next year the Cardinal will fea
ture only one freshman on its ros
ter. But those in the know say that
the Maples fans can already safely
start chanting "Four more years"
in favor of Bobbie Kelsey.
If Kelsey's name sounds famil
iar, that's because she is already
on the team. The freshman red
shirted this year while she rehabil
itated her left knee. She tore her
anterior cruciate ligament just
before her senior year in high
school.
"I was playing in an AAU game
for the Georgia Peaches," Kelsey
said. "I turned out to guard my
girl, and she turned out, and I
turned, and it just gave way on me
as I pivoted."
Kelsey was soon healthy
enough to practice, and was ready
to take the floor competitively this
past February. But coach Tara
VanDerveer decided to wait till
next year to play her top recruit.
Kelsey was one of the primary
reasons why Stanford's 1991-92
freshman class was called one of
the top two in the country. Despite
playing only six games her senior
year, she was still ranked the No. 6
recruit in the nation. After her
junior year, the Georgia native
was ranked among the top three
prep players in the talent-rich
South.
Known as "Special K" at
Southwest DeKalb High School in

Atlanta, the 5-foot-11 guard aver
aged 23 points, eight rebounds,
four assists and four steals per
game as a junior.
At Stanford, Kelsey has been
surrounded by extraordinary
hype. Some observers have even
stated that she could turn out to
be Stanford's best player ever.
"We've never had a player in
our program quite like Bobbie,"
VanDerveer said. "She will give us
a different dimension .... If I had
to characterize her, I'd say she's as
competitive as Jennifer Azzi, as
big as Katy Steding, and as quick
as Sonja Henning."
"I'm aware of the hype," Kelsey
said. "All the boosters come up to
me and say, 'I can't wait to see you
play next year . .. Tara really talks
about it a lot .... So, I have to
come through. I mean, I feel I can
do it. It's just a little pressure.
"But Azzi and Henning — I'm
nowhere near those guys," she
added.
But even Kelsey's amazing tal
ents will not gain her a starting
spot on next season's edition of the
Cardinal, which returns all five
starters from this year's champi
onship team. However, she is like
ly to see plenty of time at the
"two" and "three" positions, per
haps in a rotation scheme of some
sort.
After a failed attempt to sign
this year's top recruit, Katie
Smith of Logan, Ohio, Kelsey will
find herself the sole freshman on
next year's Cardinal team. Smith
signed with Ohio State, the pro
gram which VanDerveer led to
national prominence in the early
1980s.
Kelsey will welcome the playing
time.

Bobbie Kelsey — next in the Jennifer Azzi-Sonja Menning tradition?
"It was real hard (sitting 0ut)....
Sometimes (on the bench) I would
look down the end like, 'Okay
Tara, put me in now.' And then I'd
be like, 'Wait a minute, I can't go
in. What am I doing?"'
Especially with Kelsey's addi
tion, the lack of recruits for 1993
will not be much of a blow. Along
with Tennessee (which signed yet
another top class), the Cardinal
will still be one of the two deepest,
most talented squads in the coun
try.
Kelsey will be a big reason for

that. And after sitting on the side
lines during a championship year,
"Special K" would love to con
tribute to a repeat title at next
year's Final Four, which happens
to be in her hometown.

Three former Stanford players are in
Colorado Springs this weekend for the
Olympic tryouts: Jennifer Azzi, Sonja
Henning and Katy Steding. Both Azzi
and Henning have started at point
guard for Team USA in the past couple
of years. All three have played overseas
professionally. Current Stanford Ail-
American Val Whiting was invited to
the tryouts, but elected not to go.

But even Kelsey's amazing tal
ents will not gain her a starting
spot on next season's edition of the
Cardinal, which returns all five
starters from this year's champi
onship team. However, she is like
ly to see plenty of time at the
"two" and "three" positions, per
haps in a rotation scheme of some
sort.
After a failed attempt to sign
this year's top recruit, Katie
Smith of Logan, Ohio, Kelsey will
find herself the sole freshman on
next year's Cardinal team. Smith
signed with Ohio State, the pro
gram which VanDerveer led to
national prominence in the early
1980s.
Kelsey will welcome the playing
time.

Bobbie Kelsey — next in the Jennifer Azzi-Sonja Menning tradition?
"It was real hard (sitting 0ut)....
Sometimes (on the bench) I would
look down the end like, 'Okay
Tara, put me in now.' And then I'd
be like, 'Wait a minute, I can't go
in. What am I doing?"'
Especially with Kelsey's addi
tion, the lack of recruits for 1993
will not be much of a blow. Along
with Tennessee (which signed yet
another top class), the Cardinal
will still be one of the two deepest,
most talented squads in the coun
try.
Kelsey will be a big reason for

that. And after sitting on the side
lines during a championship year,
"Special K" would love to con
tribute to a repeat title at next
year's Final Four, which happens
to be in her hometown.

Three former Stanford players are in
Colorado Springs this weekend for the
Olympic tryouts: Jennifer Azzi, Sonja
Henning and Katy Steding. Both Azzi
and Henning have started at point
guard for Team USA in the past couple
of years. All three have played overseas
professionally. Current Stanford Ail-
American Val Whiting was invited to
the tryouts, but elected not to go.
Kelsey, on playing in the 1996 Olympics
in her hometown: "It would be nice."
When Stanford's women's bas
ketball team crushed Arkansas to
win the 1990 West Regional in
Maples Pavilion en route to its
first national crown, the sellout
crowd chanted its approval of
then-freshman Val Whiting:
"Three more years! Three more
years!"
Next year the Cardinal will fea
ture only one freshman on its ros
ter. But those in the know say that
the Maples fans can already safely
start chanting "Four more years"
in favor of Bobbie Kelsey.
If Kelsey's name sounds famil
iar, that's because she is already
on the team. The freshman red
shirted this year while she rehabil
itated her left knee. She tore her
anterior cruciate ligament just
before her senior year in high
school.
"I was playing in an AAU game
for the Georgia Peaches," Kelsey
said. "I turned out to guard my
girl, and she turned out, and I
turned, and it just gave way on me
as I pivoted."
Kelsey was soon healthy
enough to practice, and was ready
to take the floor competitively this
past February. But coach Tara
VanDerveer decided to wait till
next year to play her top recruit.
Kelsey was one of the primary
reasons why Stanford's 1991-92
freshman class was called one of
the top two in the country. Despite
playing only six games her senior
year, she was still ranked the No. 6
recruit in the nation. After her
junior year, the Georgia native
was ranked among the top three
prep players in the talent-rich
South.
Known as "Special K" at
Southwest DeKalb High School in

Atlanta, the 5-foot-11 guard aver
aged 23 points, eight rebounds,
four assists and four steals per
game as a junior.
At Stanford, Kelsey has been
surrounded by extraordinary
hype. Some observers have even
stated that she could turn out to
be Stanford's best player ever.
"We've never had a player in
our program quite like Bobbie,"
VanDerveer said. "She will give us
a different dimension .... If I had
to characterize her, I'd say she's as
competitive as Jennifer Azzi, as
big as Katy Steding, and as quick
as Sonja Henning."
"I'm aware of the hype," Kelsey
said. "All the boosters come up to
me and say, 'I can't wait to see you
play next year . .. Tara really talks
about it a lot .... So, I have to
come through. I mean, I feel I can
do it. It's just a little pressure.
"But Azzi and Henning — I'm
nowhere near those guys," she
added.

ents will not gain her a starting
