# Women's tennis: 1992 a success despite UT loss
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
With the NCAA Championships two weeks old,
women's tennis coach Frank Brennan reflected on
the season and looked forward to next year's cam
paign.
After an up and down year, the squad lost to
Texas in the semifinals of the NCAA tourney.
"If we're 22-3 and No. 3 in the country and
ashamed, then something's wrong," he said. "We
had a good season. We didn't have a good day
against Texas, but that doesn't discount the sea
son.
Indeed, the team had many bright moments.
At the National Team Indoors, Stanford beat
No. 2 Georgia before barely falling to No. 1 Florida
in the finals. Also, Brennan pointed to the win over
California at NCAAs as a highlight since the Bears
had edged the Cardinal in their last match.
Individual players also shone for Stanford.
No. 1 Heather Willens made the finals of the
Ail-American Championships in the fall. Although
the junior hit a losing skid at NCAAs, she previ
ously had a 19-3 dual-match record.
And Willens suffered no bad losses during the
regular season.
Her troika of defeats came at the hands of no
one less than an NCAA singles finalist — 1992 vic
tor Lisa Raymond, runner-up Shannan McCarthy
and 1991 finalist Lisa Albano
This year marked not only the emergence of
Willens in the elite of college tennis, but also
Laxmi Poruri.
She had a mediocre freshman campaign and her
preseason ranking of No. 62 made it clear few peo
ple expected much of Poruri in 1992.
However, she jumped 58 spots in the poll in the
course of the season. She won the National Colle
giate crown and the Rolex Regionals, plus the
semifinals of Rolex Indoor. Reaffirming her posi
tion in the top five, she finished the year with an
appearance in the NCAA semifinals.
In the team tourney, senior Kylie Johnson
defeated all three of her singles opponents as did
freshman Amy Chiminello.
But the team couldn't quite over
come the injuries which plagued
them all season.
Freshman Kim Shasby was
lost for the year after she tore a
knee ligament in January. At var
ious parts during the year, both
Johnson and Kurth suffered back
injuries. Except for NCAAs,
Emma Woodhouse sat out the last
two and a half months of the sea
son with a hamstring tear.
And against the Longhorns,

the team's lack of constant prac
tice and playing showed. "We
were tight. Texas was loose. They
were crashing and banging —
going for it," Brennan said.
Which isn't to say the Cardinal
choked. "When you're injured you
can't practice," Brennan said.
"No practice means no confidence
and when you aren't confident
you get tight. It's not that they're
not great competitors because I
know they are, but it's tough to be
confident when you've been
injured."
But with 1991-92 over, the

squad is hungry for another try.
"We're highly motivated for
next year," Brennan said. "There
are no laurels to rest on.
"You lose, then get madder
than hell and regroup with twice
the intensity," he said.
Stanford will again be a
favorite to win in May. Five of the
six starters return and Shasby
will be healthy. Also add top
recruits Beth Barris and Wendy
Sacks, both of whom will add
strength and depth to the squad.
Maybe 1993 will be the start of
a new tennis dynasty at Stanford.
