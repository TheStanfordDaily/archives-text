# Women's tennis: 1992 a success despite UT loss
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
With the NCAA Championships two weeks old,
women's tennis coach Frank Brennan reflected on
the season and looked forward to next year's cam
paign.
After an up and down year, the squad lost to
Texas in the semifinals of the NCAA tourney.
"If we're 22-3 and No. 3 in the country and
ashamed, then something's wrong," he said. "We
had a good season. We didn't have a good day
against Texas, but that doesn't discount the sea
son.
Indeed, the team had many bright moments.
At the National Team Indoors, Stanford beat
No. 2 Georgia before barely falling to No. 1 Florida
in the finals. Also, Brennan pointed to the win over
California at NCAAs as a highlight since the Bears
had edged the Cardinal in their last match.
Individual players also shone for Stanford.
No. 1 Heather Willens made the finals of the
Ail-American Championships in the fall. Although
the junior hit a losing skid at NCAAs, she previ
ously had a 19-3 dual-match record.
And Willens suffered no bad losses during the
regular season.
Her troika of defeats came at the hands of no
one less than an NCAA singles finalist â€” 1992 vic
tor Lisa Raymond, runner-up Shannan McCarthy
and 1991 finalist Lisa Albano
This year marked not only the emergence of
Willens in the elite of college tennis, but also
Laxmi Poruri.
She had a mediocre freshman campaign and her
preseason ranking of No. 62 made it clear few peo
ple expected much of Poruri in 1992.
However, she jumped 58 spots in the poll in the
course of the season. She won the National Colle
giate crown and the Rolex Regionals, plus the
semifinals of Rolex Indoor. Reaffirming her posi
tion in the top five, she finished the year with an
appearance in the NCAA semifinals.
In the team tourney, senior Kylie Johnson
defeated all three of her singles opponents as did
freshman Amy Chiminello.
