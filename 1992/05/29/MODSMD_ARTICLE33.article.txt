# Card nine look to build on stellar season finish
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
As with anything, Stanford's 1992 baseball sea
son can be looked at from two different perspec
tives.
On one hand, the Cardinal let some prime oppor
tunities slip through their fingers (tough losses to
Arizona and UCLA at home and Cal on the road,
games which could have landed Stanford a home
regional).
But on the other hand, the team exceeded the
expectations of almost every preseason prognostica
tor (series sweeps of Pepperdine and Cal, a second
place finish in the Six-Pac), and came up with some
exciting and unexpected results.
The high point of the season? It had to be the
nine-game winning streak at the end of the season,
and the earning of a No. 1 seed in the South II
regional.
The low point? Either the two losses on Sudden
Saturday, when the Cardinal was eliminated from
the NCAA Tournament, or the sweep by Cal which
was an integral part of a midseason streak where
Stanford lost six of seven games.
There were some pleasant surprises for the Car
dinal. Who would have thought that Dusty Allen
would turn out to be the hitter (or defensive player,
for that matter) that he is?
Who could have forseen the emergence of Dave
Cornell, who for a while flirted with the .400 mark
in batting average? Who could have guessed the
impact that Rick Helling would have?
Mark Skeels, All-Six-Pac? Freshmen Jed Hansen
and Todd Laßocca at shortstop? A Jamie Sepeda-
Willie Adams no-hitter? Chris Kemper fully recov
ered from his dreaded anterior cruciate ligament
tear to go on a tear of his own? Steve Worrell?

And there were some not-so pleasant surprises.
Brian Sackinsky, after his first three starts, didn't
nearly live up to his preseason Ail-American touting,
and couldn't even hold on to his spot in the rotation.
Jeffrey Hammonds, although he was chosen All-
Am erican, had a year which was only a shadow of
what his immense talents could have done if it
weren't for injuries and a batless first half. Sepeda
also accomplished less than he could have. Aaron
Dorlarque headed a bullpen that was less than spec
tacular. The 100 stolen base outfield remained only
a dream.
But the achievements of the '92 Cardinal bode
well for next year. Look for a infield next year of
Allen at first, Jeff DesJardins at second, Laßocca at
short and Jed Hansen at third. That's superb
defense, and if Hansen can continue to hit like he
did at the end of this season, it shouldn't be too bad
offensively either. And speaking of offense, Steve
Carver and Nate Olmstead should provide plenty of
that.
If none go pro (which is unlikely), Stanford will
have the number one recruiting class in the nation.
The Cardinal should land the top catching recruit,
A.J. Hinch, who will fill a void behind the plate. And
infielders Brian Dallimore and Todd Helton are big
time players, as is outfielder Cale Carter and pitch
er Rob Gardner.
The biggest question may be: Who will be back?
Besides graduating seniors Cornell, Solomon, Kem
per, Tony Detter, David Holbrook, Dorlarque and
Skeels, many juniors will be drafted. Doubtlessly
Hammonds will go pro as he will most likely be
taken among the top three choices. Sackinsky will
probably be gone. But what about Helling, Sepeda,
Worrell and John Lynch?
These questions will be answered shortly after
the June draft.
