The Stanford Axe Committee staged an NCAA

incredible performance for an institution."
Stanford's "incredible performance" in athletics
this year has earned the school five NCAA team
championships and 27 individual titles. The noon
event diow about 75 people.
The rally, which included a performance by the
Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band
and the dollies, acknowledged each of the five win
ning teams and several individual winners.
Athletes representing Women's Swimming and
Diving, Men's Swimming and Diving, Women's Bas
ketball, Men's Gymnastics and Men's Tennis made
brief appearances on stage as their coaches intro
duced them and commented on their seasons.
Women's Swimming coach Richard Quick credit
ed part of the team's success to the "attitude of the

University" in supporting athletics.
Skip Kenney, Men's Swimming coach, called his
team the "best in the history of NCAA."
This year's NCAA victory gave Men's Tennis
coach Dick Gould the 12th team title in his Stanford
coaching career.
But for the Men's Gymnastics team, their NCAA
title was the first in Stanford history. Coach Sadao
Hamada said the team was the best he'd coached in
his 20 years at Stanford.
Other coaches present were Women's Diving
coach Richard Schavone and Women's Basketball
assistant coach Carolyn Jenkins.
The rally was organized by Steve Zika, the incoming
chairman for the Axe Committee. Zika said he planned
the activity primarily to "give athletes the chance to be
recognized by their peers, their fellow students."
Zika said he also staged the event to acknowledge
the University for winning five NCAA titles in one
year. This has only been done once before, in 1982
by UCLA.
