# Grad student's trashy novel offers unusual view of Harvard
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
If death and taxes are certain,
so, it seems, are novels about life
at Harvard University.
One more, co-written by gradu
ate student Michael Melcher, may
soon join the bulging collection.
Melcher, who graduated from
Harvard in 1985, said his yet
unfinished work is a trashy, sex
filled novel about a prostitution
racket uncovered by a Harvard
Crimson reporter. Appropriately,
the book is titled "Class Ring."
But the backdrop for the
steamy plot, differs from the
usual supermarket-novel Har
vard. Melcher said he and his
three co-authors set out to por
tray the more multicultural uni
versity they experienced as under
graduates.
"There are novels about this
school at every turn," said Melch
er, a law and business school stu
dent. "They're mostly about four,
white upperclass men — as if peo
ple would really want to read
about this."
His collaborators, Faith Adiele,
Bennett Singer and Julia Sulli
van, come from varied back
grounds. Adiele is half-Nigerian
and Singer is Jewish. Melcher,
half-Chicano, was raised in Los
Angeles.
In "Class Ring," Harvard has a
"multicultural" face:
"The Harvard of 1988 was a
different place from the institution
of 25 or even 10 years before — the
Black, Latino and Asian faces that
filled Harvard Yard were enough
proof of that. But for most.. . Har
vard was distant and remote, a
world of manicured lawns and old
brick buildings, of garden parties
and afternoon teas. It was almost

another country."
So far, six prominent agents
are betting people will want to
read "Class Ring."
Less than a week after the
team sent a plot summary and
character descriptions to a slew of
agents, they heard back from
Ellen Levine, who represents for
mer Stegner Fellow Scott Turow.
Turow's best-seller "Presumed
Innocent" was made into a major
motion picture starring Harrison

Ford.
The group agreed to send her
the novel after they finish it this
summer, Melcher said. Levine's
response doesn't mean she'll pub
lish the book, he said, "It means
we've piqued her interest." If
Levine decides not to publish the
book, the group will try other
agents, he said.
One agent, when he heard
about "Class Ring," said it sound
ed like a " 'Naked Came the

Stranger' of the '905."
In "Naked," the heroine has
sex with a different man in every
chapter. "It was super-cheesy,
smarm-o," Melcher said. "A
trash-novel, but a best-seller."
"Class Ring" is sexy, but con
temporary, he said. "It deals with
issues like AIDS. There is talk
about risks and safe sex — sex of
all persuasions," he said.
"Sylvie continued in the same
vein. 7 know plenty of Harvard —

oh, excuse me, Radcliffe — women
who would sleep with men to get
something.' She added off-hand
edly, 'Guys would too. And why
not? It would he amusing.
Members of the team, which
has adopted the "gender- and eth
nic-neutral" name Morgan Diaz
Lee, have strong writing back
grounds, Melcher said.
Melcher was a member of the
Daily editorial board and Singer, a
San Francisco resident, has
worked on a documentary film
about gays in the military. Sulli
van is working on a Ph.D. in
English at Rutgers, although both
she and Adiele work and live at
Harvard.
Melcher quipped, "It was
annoying to learn of the prema
ture fame of our classmates,"
many of whom have written com
ing-of-age novels.
"I went to Asia to come of age,"
Melcher said. "I just didn't write
about it."
Earlier individual attempts by
group members to write never
amounted to much, Melcher said.
This time around was "the right
time," he said. "We had some
thing to say."
The novel is about a "quest for
self-identity," he said, and "people
who are capable, but not as much
as they think."
Ideas were exchanged via tele
phone before the group met over
spring break to map the plot and
draft chapters. A central meeting
place — Singer's parent's convert
ed farm house outside Chicago —
was chosen to "invest everyone"
in the proposition.
While a surprise blizzard raged
outside the "antique-stuffed"
house, Melcher said, he and his
collaborators drank cup after cup
of coffee. Days would begin with a

10 a.m. meeting followed by three
to four hours of writing and more
discussion.
Tension arose from their dif
ferent work styles, Melcher said.
Melcher, whose focus was "con
flict resolution," said he tried to
"keep in mind that the net goal
was to come up with a workable
book."
"There was no point in any
body running rampant," he said.
Generally, Melcher said, the
group worked well together because
each member contributed specific
strengths — like plot mechanics,
fast writing, character development
and structural editing.
While the plot stayed true to
their original conception, he said,
the characters took on lives of
their own. Many details came from
personal experience, he said. One
character is a Mexican-American
from Los Angeles who resembles
"me, my sister, my mother and my
sister's roommate," he said.
Rather than being a "political
treatise," the book has provided a
forum for its authors to "work out
some of our attitudes about col
lege," Melcher said.
"There's a lot of 20-something
stuff in it,"he said. He said he
hopes it reaches a wider audience
than the cynical, sarcastic novels
about his generation. "Those
books don't speak to anyone
beyond that clique that hands out
at drug-filled parties in L.A. and
New York," he said.
But there are other reasons his
"junk-food with nutritional
value" novel is targeted at a wider
audience. "We'd like to be able to
make money from it,"he said.
"Besides," he added. "If you
write something you're really
pleased with and no one reads it,
what have you accomplished?"

fast writing, character development
and structural editing.
While the plot stayed true to
their original conception, he said,
the characters took on lives of
their own. Many details came from
personal experience, he said. One
character is a Mexican-American
from Los Angeles who resembles
"me, my sister, my mother and my
sister's roommate," he said.
Rather than being a "political
treatise," the book has provided a
forum for its authors to "work out
some of our attitudes about col
lege," Melcher said.
"There's a lot of 20-something
stuff in it,"he said. He said he
hopes it reaches a wider audience
than the cynical, sarcastic novels
about his generation. "Those
books don't speak to anyone
beyond that clique that hands out
at drug-filled parties in L.A. and
New York," he said.
But there are other reasons his
"junk-food with nutritional
value" novel is targeted at a wider
audience. "We'd like to be able to
make money from it,"he said.
"Besides," he added. "If you
write something you're really
pleased with and no one reads it,
what have you accomplished?"

Harvard alum Michael Melcher, now a graduate student at Stanford, joined three other former Harvard
students to write "Class Ring," a novel about a prostitution ring uncovered at the university.
If death and taxes are certain,
so, it seems, are novels about life
at Harvard University.
One more, co-written by gradu
ate student Michael Melcher, may
soon join the bulging collection.
Melcher, who graduated from
Harvard in 1985, said his yet
unfinished work is a trashy, sex
filled novel about a prostitution
racket uncovered by a Harvard
Crimson reporter. Appropriately,
the book is titled "Class Ring."
But the backdrop for the
steamy plot, differs from the
usual supermarket-novel Har
vard. Melcher said he and his
three co-authors set out to por
tray the more multicultural uni
versity they experienced as under
graduates.
"There are novels about this
school at every turn," said Melch
er, a law and business school stu
dent. "They're mostly about four,
white upperclass men — as if peo
ple would really want to read
about this."
His collaborators, Faith Adiele,
Bennett Singer and Julia Sulli
van, come from varied back
grounds. Adiele is half-Nigerian
and Singer is Jewish. Melcher,
half-Chicano, was raised in Los
Angeles.
In "Class Ring," Harvard has a
"multicultural" face:
"The Harvard of 1988 was a
different place from the institution
of 25 or even 10 years before — the
Black, Latino and Asian faces that
filled Harvard Yard were enough
proof of that. But for most.. . Har
vard was distant and remote, a
world of manicured lawns and old
brick buildings, of garden parties
and afternoon teas. It was almost

another country."
So far, six prominent agents
are betting people will want to
read "Class Ring."
Less than a week after the
team sent a plot summary and
character descriptions to a slew of
agents, they heard back from
Ellen Levine, who represents for
mer Stegner Fellow Scott Turow.
Turow's best-seller "Presumed
Innocent" was made into a major
motion picture starring Harrison

Ford.
The group agreed to send her
the novel after they finish it this
summer, Melcher said. Levine's
response doesn't mean she'll pub
lish the book, he said, "It means
we've piqued her interest." If
Levine decides not to publish the
book, the group will try other
agents, he said.
One agent, when he heard
about "Class Ring," said it sound
ed like a " 'Naked Came the

Stranger' of the '905."
In "Naked," the heroine has
sex with a different man in every
chapter. "It was super-cheesy,
smarm-o," Melcher said. "A
trash-novel, but a best-seller."
"Class Ring" is sexy, but con
temporary, he said. "It deals with
issues like AIDS. There is talk
about risks and safe sex — sex of
all persuasions," he said.
"Sylvie continued in the same
vein. 7 know plenty of Harvard —

oh, excuse me, Radcliffe — women
who would sleep with men to get
something.' She added off-hand
edly, 'Guys would too. And why
not? It would he amusing.
Members of the team, which
has adopted the "gender- and eth
nic-neutral" name Morgan Diaz
Lee, have strong writing back
grounds, Melcher said.
Melcher was a member of the
Daily editorial board and Singer, a
San Francisco resident, has
worked on a documentary film
about gays in the military. Sulli
van is working on a Ph.D. in
English at Rutgers, although both
she and Adiele work and live at
Harvard.
Melcher quipped, "It was
annoying to learn of the prema
ture fame of our classmates,"
many of whom have written com
ing-of-age novels.
"I went to Asia to come of age,"
Melcher said. "I just didn't write
about it."
Earlier individual attempts by
group members to write never
amounted to much, Melcher said.
This time around was "the right
time," he said. "We had some
thing to say."
The novel is about a "quest for
self-identity," he said, and "people
who are capable, but not as much
as they think."
Ideas were exchanged via tele
phone before the group met over
spring break to map the plot and
draft chapters. A central meeting
place — Singer's parent's convert
ed farm house outside Chicago —
was chosen to "invest everyone"
in the proposition.
While a surprise blizzard raged
outside the "antique-stuffed"
house, Melcher said, he and his
collaborators drank cup after cup
of coffee. Days would begin with a

10 a.m. meeting followed by three
to four hours of writing and more
discussion.
Tension arose from their dif
ferent work styles, Melcher said.
Melcher, whose focus was "con
flict resolution," said he tried to
"keep in mind that the net goal
was to come up with a workable
book."
"There was no point in any
body running rampant," he said.
Generally, Melcher said, the
group worked well together because
each member contributed specific
strengths — like plot mechanics,
fast writing, character development
and structural editing.
While the plot stayed true to
their original conception, he said,
the characters took on lives of
their own. Many details came from
