# Polaroid shots carry message on student aid

The ASSU Financial Aid Advocacy Office plans
to send a special greeting to incoming University
President Gerhard Casper — a greeting from a few
hundred students.
Senior Vince Ricci, the outgoing chairperson of
the office, said the office will send short notes and
Polaroid pictures of each participating student to
Casper at his University of Chicago office.
Organizers have gathered about 200 greetings in
White Plaza since Tuesday.
The messages are designed to let Casper know
how deeply students value need-blind admissions,
according to junior Michelle Mello, the incoming
chairperson of the office.
"We are including polaroid snapshots with each
letter to make them more personal," Mello said.
"We want to make Casper realize that they take
this issue very personally."
Mello said the campaign comes in response to
Casper's "comments to the effect that he would not
be against re-examining the policy of need-blind
admissions," a policy which evaluates applicants to
Stanford without considering their financial status.
The policy should not be negotiable, according to
Ricci, because to question it is to make "our whole
existence at Stanford open for debate."
Freshman Deborah Kun, one of the students
who wrote a note to Casper, said
"education is one of the surest ways
to get political and economic equal
ity that we don't have right now."
If education becomes based on
affluence rather than capability
then that is "doing away with the
possibility of changing the sys
tem," she added.
Kun said the campaign was a
good idea because "it is not
threatening to the administration
in any way" and they would be
likely to respond to it.
Eliminating need-blind admis
sions would "eliminate the meri
tocratic element here at Stanford
— it would destroy multicultural
ism," Mello said.
She said one of the things that
set Stanford apart from Ivy

League schools is that there are
not a lot of legacies here. "If we
lose need-blind admissions, we
lose that and we just become Har
vard," she said.
She added that while Casper has
only brought up the issue in a spec
ulative manner, financial aid advo
cates are concerned because "we
saw a lot of things that were specu
lation rapidly become reality" dur
ing the University's budget crisis.
"We cannot tolerate that hap
pening with need-blind admis
sions," she said.
The campaign was proposed by
the outgoing staff of the office.
But they assigned it to Mello and
the new board as their first task.
"I was really excited about
being appointed," Mello said. "It
was a good time to give me some
thing to do."
The group hopes to collect 500
letters. The campaign continues
today in White Plaza.
