The ASSU Financial Aid Advocacy Office plans
to send a special greeting to incoming University
President Gerhard Casper â€” a greeting from a few
hundred students.
Senior Vince Ricci, the outgoing chairperson of
the office, said the office will send short notes and
Polaroid pictures of each participating student to
Casper at his University of Chicago office.
Organizers have gathered about 200 greetings in
White Plaza since Tuesday.
The messages are designed to let Casper know
how deeply students value need-blind admissions,
according to junior Michelle Mello, the incoming
chairperson of the office.
"We are including polaroid snapshots with each
letter to make them more personal," Mello said.
"We want to make Casper realize that they take
this issue very personally."
Mello said the campaign comes in response to
Casper's "comments to the effect that he would not
be against re-examining the policy of need-blind
admissions," a policy which evaluates applicants to
Stanford without considering their financial status.
The policy should not be negotiable, according to
Ricci, because to question it is to make "our whole
existence at Stanford open for debate."
