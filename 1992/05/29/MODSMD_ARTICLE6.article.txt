# Groups cry foul on granting of funds to Review

Students representing several campus publica
tions say they are upset over allocation of Publica
tions Board funds to the Stanford Review, attribut
ing the ASSU Senate's action last week to a conflict
of interest.
The senate amended the board's recommendation
of $0 to give the Review $1,000 in discretionary sum
mer funds and $3,000 in annual funding at the
Appropriations Committee's request.
Several students associated with other publica
tions funded by the board said they were upset that
the committee, which is chaired by Review founder
Peter Thiel, reversed the board's recommendation
and did not consult with them.
"There's been a conflict of interest all year," said
senior Susan McKean, publisher of Montage maga
zine. "The Appropriations Committee is stacked in
favor of the Review."
And board director Ruben Garcia agreed, saying
he thought Thiel's position as Appropriations Chair
created a "definite conflict of interest."
But Thiel said that under ASSU bylaws, there
would only be a conflict of interest if he were an offi
cer at the Review. He writes for the paper, but said
he does not hold an official position.
According to Garcia, the $1,000 in discretionaiy
funds given to the Review was at the expense of the
other publications, but annual funding can vary.
