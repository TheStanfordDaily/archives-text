# Groups cry foul on granting of funds to Review

Students representing several campus publica
tions say they are upset over allocation of Publica
tions Board funds to the Stanford Review, attribut
ing the ASSU Senate's action last week to a conflict
of interest.
The senate amended the board's recommendation
of $0 to give the Review $1,000 in discretionary sum
mer funds and $3,000 in annual funding at the
Appropriations Committee's request.
Several students associated with other publica
tions funded by the board said they were upset that
the committee, which is chaired by Review founder
Peter Thiel, reversed the board's recommendation
and did not consult with them.
"There's been a conflict of interest all year," said
senior Susan McKean, publisher of Montage maga
zine. "The Appropriations Committee is stacked in
favor of the Review."
And board director Ruben Garcia agreed, saying
he thought Thiel's position as Appropriations Chair
created a "definite conflict of interest."
But Thiel said that under ASSU bylaws, there
would only be a conflict of interest if he were an offi
cer at the Review. He writes for the paper, but said
he does not hold an official position.
According to Garcia, the $1,000 in discretionaiy
funds given to the Review was at the expense of the
other publications, but annual funding can vary.
The ASSU allocated $20,435 in
Publications Board funds to 18
student publications. The Review
received nearly one-fifth of that
total.
Sophomore Richard Juang,
who works for the literary maga
zine Dialtone, said the money
given to the Review would have
been better spent on creating new
publications or spread among the
existing ones.
Juang said Dialtone funding
was cut from $2,800 to $1,900 â€”
the lowest amount of funding the
magazine has received in the past
three or four years.
"It's almost ludicrous for us to
try and publish a magazine with
that amount of funding," he said.
Juang added that department
budget cuts have also hurt the
magazine because departments
have less money to contribute. He
said the magazine received $300
from the English department,
which was far less than in prior
years.
According to Garcia, the Publi

cations Board felt the Review did
not deserve funding because,
unlike many other publications,
they have access to advertising
and fund raising.
The Review spends $24,000 on
salaries every year, Garcia said.
He said it is the only publication
funded by the board that provides
salaries.

Under ASSU
bylaws, salaries
and the frequency
of publication can't
be counted when
figuring need.

Thiel said that under ASSU
bylaws, salaries and the frequen
cy of publication can't be counted
when figuring the maximum
need. The Review's salaries are
largely for business and advertis
ing, which more than cover the
salaries with the revenue they
bring in, he added.
Garcia said he gave the Publi

cations Board's recommendations
to Thiel on May 1, but they were
not discussed until the very end of
the May 20 meeting.
"Unfortunately, I don't think
there's anything that can be
done" since the ASSU will not
meet again this year, Garcia said.
Garcia said the Publications
Board makes recommendations to
the Appropriations Committee,
which revises them before placing
a bill before the Senate.
According to Senate Chair
Kevin Warsh, the recommenda
tions should have been handed in
the during the first weeks of the
quarter, and the delay may have
kept the issue from being dis
cussed until the final meeting.
"I would think that Publica
tions Board is at least part to
blame for that," said Warsh, who
also writes for the Review.
He added that it takes hours
for the Appropriations Commit
tee to go through all the recom
mendations and amend the final
requests. It would have taken a
lot of pressure to have the issue
discussed at the May 5 meeting,
he said.
"It could be done, but it'd be
tough," Warsh said.
