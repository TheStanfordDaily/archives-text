# Aid Advocacy Office expands
## 
### Yaser Haddara Staff writer 
A new chairperson and an
expanded board of directors have
been chosen to take over the
ASSU Financial Aid Advocacy
Office next year.
The outgoing board last week
appointed junior Michelle Mello
as chairperson. They also decided
to expand the board from seven to
11 members and to create three
new internships, according to
outgoing chairperson Vince Ricci.
Ricci said the office was
expanded to accommodate all
qualified applicants and because
the office is "not the kind of orga
nization where too many people
get in each other's way."
He said there will be more
work next year as the office staff
tries to be "proactive instead of
reactive, which is always the chal

lenge of student activism."
The staff will be expected to hold
office hours to counsel students
who have problems with financial
aid and will also try to "intervene
on students' behalf," he said.
Mello said she was pleased
with the increased size because it
will allow the office to carry out
projects successfully with "less of
a time commitment per person."
She said she expects to have
two or three people "who will be
really involved all the time, and
the others will be on call."
Mello said counselling students
and helping them with financial
aid problems will be a main focus
next year.
The office will do surveys at the
beginning of each quarter to find
out students' concerns and ques
tions about financial aid, Mello
said, and communicate them to the
proper administrators.
