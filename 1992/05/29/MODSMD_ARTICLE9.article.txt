# Stanford senior makes truck his home
## 
### Kim McCreery Staff writer 
"Alan" is a senior at Stanford, but he has
no messy dorm room to come home to at night.
In fact, he doesn't come home to a room at all.
After he watches the moon shine over Lake
Lagunita, he draws the thick orange curtains
inside the windows of his truck, tucks himself
under a thick sheepskin blanket and drifts off
to sleep.
Call it crazy, or cozy. His truck is his home.
"My dad just gave me his truck this year,
which was great timing," Alan said. "Before
that I had a Volkswagen beetle. That would
never have worked."
Alan wanted to remain anonymous because
sleeping in his car is against University regula
tions. In California, there is no state law forbid
ding it, but University police can bring charges of
trespassing if a person is found in a car on cam
pus. Offenders face removal, fines or probation.
Alan, his girlfriend Laura, three crates of
clothes and a stack of books share the back of
his 1986 silver Toyota Forerunner. Alan has
lived in the truck all year. Laura, who just
graduated from Santa Clara University,
moved in a few weeks ago.
Alan got the idea from two friends who
spent a year in the back of a Ford pick-up. Alan
had used his truck as a camper last summer.
So, when he found himself short of money, he
bought a $50 parking permit instead of a $6,000
housing contract and claimed a space in the lot
behind the Kappa Alpha fraternity house.
The remote lot is tucked behind the KA
house on the northwest corner of campus. On
two sides it is shielded by thick bushes. It is
accessible by only one obscure route. As park
ing lots go, there is a great deal of privacy.
Even though Alan is a member of the KA
fraternity, he pays only $50 to use the house
showers and buys a $400 partial meal plan at
Lambda Nu. His fraternity brothers pay about
$2,000 a quarter to live in the KA house.
Alan's father, a pilot for United Airlines, and
his mother, a youth choir director, put both
Alan and his younger brother through private
school near their home in Berkeley. Although
his parents made too much for him to qualify
for most financial aid, Alan said there wasn't
much money to put both boys through college.

So Alan signed up for a Navy ROTC scholar
ship, which covers tuition for four years.
Because he is earning a bachelors degree in polit
ical science and a masters degree in sociology at
the same time, he will have to stay an extra quar
ter and come up with another $6,000 in tuition.

'Whenever I want to, I can
just disappear. It makes me
sort of a marginal kind of
person. Sort of hippie-cool.'
â€” 'Alan'

Rather than taking out a loan or asking his
parents to get a second mortgage, he made his
truck his home for the year. He ripped out the
back seats, laid out a foam pad and spread a
sheepskin cover over the top. He strung cur
tains around the windows and set up crates
for his clothes along one side. Then he decided
to face one day at a time.
"It's like nest building. You fill in all the little
nooks and crannies," he said. "Since I go home
every week, I'll just take stuff home and get new
stuff, but I wear the same clothes a lot."
So far, Alan hasn't run into trouble. At Stan
ford, students are only required to live in dorms
their freshman year. After that, University
housing officials don't ask questions if students
don't enter the lottery for on-campus housing,
as long as they pay their tuition on time.
Alan relishes the liberty and freedom he has
found in his unique abode. "I enjoy the soli
tude. Whenever I want to, I can just disap
pear," he said with a grin. "It makes me sort of
a marginal kind of person. Sort of hippie-cool."
But individuality comes, at times, at the
high cost of low temperatures. "In the winter
I would go to bed in long underwear and a ski
hat on, and pull up a sleeping bag over my
head." Chewing on his lip and nodding his
head, he added wryly, "That was good for me."
Receiving and returning messages seems at
times a hopeless task, but he ascribes that to
modern life. Overall, he doesn't miss living in
the house. "It's always kind of a pigsty. If I can
just float in and out then I don't have to deal

with that," he said. "The reason I don't eat
there much is the food is terrible."
Still, the blend of solitude and social com
panionship gives him the strength to rewrite
the rules. "I could never do this if I didn't live
so close to home and also if I didn't have this
group of people supporting me, letting me use
their showers and taking messages," he said.
Alan is a reflective and philosophical per
son. The yin yang tattoo on his left shoulder is
his symbol of the paradoxes in his own life.
"Buddha went to the lotus tree, and I go to
my truck," he said. "There's a definite spiritu
al aspect to doing it. I'm just finding myself,
finding some of the truths of the universe."
At first, his parents and friends thought it
was a joke. Eventually, his parents supported
his decision. His friends still make jokes.
"He splurged for a parking permit," said
sophomore Nitin Bhatia. "He wouldn't want
his house to get towed."
"Sometimes when you're going out at
night, he'll wave to you," said sophomore Rick
Harada.
But most of his friends know the side of
Alan that searches for deeper meanings in life.
They describe him as uninhibited, a free-spir
it, unafraid to stand up for what he t ieves in.
"He's really complex and really surprises
me sometimes," Bhatia said. "I thought he
was just a typical fun-loving partier, not wor
rying about anything. But he's really complex
and thoughtful."
Next January, Alan will start a four to six
year commission in the Navy. He hopes to
become a diver, training dolphins and deactivat
ing bombs. He said signing into the military was
a hard choice, but he has decided it's worth it.
Alan is proud that he met the challenge of
making it through four years at Stanford, with
his ROTC scholarship and parking lot setup, on
about $10,000 total.
"I take a lot of pride in knowing I've earned
two degrees without picking up a $60,000 or
more tab," he said. "The education is mine. I
don't have to grovel with my parents."
He hopes to attend graduate school and
eventually become a professor of social science.
"I'm pretty white bread," Alan mused. "I'd like
to have a wife, kids, house, boat. But I don't see
any of that stuff as being limiting. I always
want to be traveling, moving, growing."
