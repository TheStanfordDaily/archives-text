How does a sewing machine create stitches?
How does a bike shift gears?
ME99 allows students to explore answers to these and
many other questions through a series of mechanical
dissection labs. A byproduct of this experience is
greater confidence in "hands-on" skills. Lab time will
include formal and informal oral presentations and a
final paper concerning function and history.
Prerequisites: A keen sense of curiosity. No prior
dissection experience required.
ME99 - Mechanical Dissection . 3 units, Sheppard,
