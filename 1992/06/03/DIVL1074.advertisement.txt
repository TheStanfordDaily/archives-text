Remembering the Tiananmen Tragedy
June 3-4 1989
Today Business as usual, as human rights
violations go on —
1.13 billion Chinese, % of the world's population,
continue to be deprived of their rights to choose a
government, to free conscience, free expression and free
association. They have no protection against arbitraiy
detention, unfair trial and torture.
Be aware, friend.
