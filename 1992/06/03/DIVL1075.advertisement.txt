THE GROUNDBREAKING STUDY
OF HOW THE GIFTED GROW UP
JOEL N. SHURKIN
Stanford Grads —
Keep in touch with your bookstore after you leave
campus. Our toll-free number is 800-533-2670!
The story, flaws and all, of the renowned
psychologist who probed the nature-verses
nurture conflict of bright children —a study
that continues today, some seventy years
later.
Lewis Terman was an elitist. He
believed that intelligence was inherited. He
originated the Stanford-Binet IQ test. He
desperately wanted to prove that the gifted
didn't suffer from "early ripe, early rot." In
1921 he launched his pioneering study of the
origin and outcome of bright children. He
gathered up more than 1,500 California kids
with IQs of 135 or higher, and he followed
them for the rest of their lives.
Terman's pioneering study of the
gifted continues today. With unprecedented
access to the classified files and to some of
the Terman Kids themselves —almost half of
whom are still alive —author Joel Shurkin
tells what happened to the study and to the
people. He probes the problem, examines the
consequences, and recounts the human
stories behind Terman's sometimes skewed
but always significant study. The Termites,
as these gifted people called themselves,
tend to live longer, work more happily, cope
better, and stay healthier than the average.
Joel N. Shurkin lives in Ben Lomond, Cali
fornia, teaches journalism at Stanford Uni
versity, and is a Stanford News Service
science writer.
