Summer Jobs
SUMMER JOBS
I need up to five intelligent, reliable persons to perform research for a summer
long project now starting in San Mateo. This work may extend to a one year
project or longer for someone who was inclined to take on more responsibility.
Work flexible hours — however you put in 40 is up to you. I don't need people to
do "chair time", I need people who can think straight, communicate, and be self
directed.
Project involves research by phone and database into radio transmission sites
for proposed telecommunications systems nationwide. Persons will be trained to
use demographic and FCC databases to determine coverage areas and
coverage area demographics.
Science or Humanities students/graduates should apply. You will be taught on
the job. Pay scale is $8 - $10 per hours, with possible part time work continuing
into Autumn '92.
Call John Cutler or Paul Fenn at (415) 349-1144.
