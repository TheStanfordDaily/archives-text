THE DRAW
Are you still unassigned?
Undergraduates who did not receive an assignment in the
Draw are strongly encouraged to join the Waiting List by the
June 5 deadline. Only 159 students are unassigned. It is very
likely that most if not all students who join the Waiting List
will be assigned housing by the first week of classes.
