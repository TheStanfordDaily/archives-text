APPLYING TO
GRAD SCHOOL?
THERE'S ONE MORE
RIDICULOUS TEST.
TheLSAT. The MCAT. The GRE. The GMAT.
Chances are, you'll have to face one of these to get into grad school.
The Princeton Review is uniquely qualified to give you the best preparation
available. Our students consistently achieve the highest score improvements in the
country. No other course, book, or tutor even comes close. The Princeton Review
offers you what no one else can:
• Small classes (never more than 12 students)
• C lasses grouped by test-taking ability
• All-live instruction (our teachers are better than tapes!)
• p ree extra help
• Your own copies of authentic materials, including every available test
• At least 3 full-length proctored exams, with a computer analysis of each
Ask our competitors if they can match our claims. You'll be disappointed.
