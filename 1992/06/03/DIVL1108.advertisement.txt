Bldg. 420 Rm. 371 4 units
Sociology 135
Visions of socialism will be contrasted with the realities of "actual"
socialist societies in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The problems
of centrally managed economies, the extent and dynamics of social
inequalities, oppression and resistance in totalitarian societies and the life
careers and values of individuals will be examined. We will discuss political
and economic developments in theses societies and their future prospects
for a peaceful evolution to democracy and market economies-or for
economic collapse, ethnic conflict, and authoritarian governments.
Sociology of Religion (Patricia Chang) 3:15-5:05 T TH
Bldg. 420 Rm. 371
Sociology 152. Sociology of Religion: Encountering the Sacred
Film, literature and possibly field experiences will be used to explore how
the "sacred" is perceived and structured within various cultural contexts.
We will use analytical frameworks developed within sociology,
anthropology, and psychology. We will discuss the strengths and
weaknesses of these frameworks for interpreting and structuring the
"meanings" of religious experiences.
