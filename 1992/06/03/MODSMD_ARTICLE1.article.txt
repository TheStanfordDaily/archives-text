# TITLE IX; 20 YEARS LATER
## Stanford not fully in compliance with sex-equity statute Needs more women's sports scholarships 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Less than a year after enter
ing Stanford as the top women's
soccer recruit, Kristen Wair is
bidding the Cardinal a reluctant
farewell.
The freshman from Oregon
was a four-time high school
Ail-American and won fresh
man All-American honors dur
ing her first season at Stan
ford. But without a scholar
ship, Wair lacked the financial
resources to remain here.
She said she had little choice
but to transfer — and she
chose the University of Port
land, where she will receive a
full-ride scholarship.
But had Stanford been in
better compliance with a fre
quently ignored sex-equity law
this year, Wair may have been
able to stay.
Proportionately, women
athletes receive fewer scholar
ships than men at Stanford,
and the Athletic Department
also provides women with
fewer varsity opportunities,
facts that place the University
in violation of federal sex-equi
ty laws passed two decades ago.
Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972 calls for
schools to end discriminatory
practices in many areas, includ
ing athletics. The sex-equity law
requires, among other things,
that all institutions receiving
federal aid meet certain stan
dards concerning the participa
tion rates of athletes and the
distribution of funds among
men's and women's teams.
Next year, at the urging of
an internal committee that ear
lier this year concluded a self
study on sex equity in the Ath
letic Department, Stanford will
take steps to bring its athletic
programs into compliance with
the law by adding several
women's scholarships.
Three scholarships will be
granted to the women's soccer

team, both in response to this
committee's urgings and to
appease the coach, Berhane
Andeberhan, who threatened
to quit last month because of
the lack of institutional sup
port for his team.

Proportionately,
women athletes
receive fewer
scholarships than
men at Stanford.

Also, a budget-driven 10-
percent scholarship reduction
in many men's sports — an
NCAA-mandated move that all
Division I schools will be imple
menting by 1993 — will have
the effect of narrowing the gap
between men's and women's
scholarship totals, bringing
Stanford into compliance with
that area of the sex-equity law.
Falling short
Despite the national promi
nence of Stanford's women's
teams and Athletic Director
Ted Leland's proclamation at a
recent Faculty Senate meeting
that Stanford has taken a lead
ership role in women's athlet
ics, the University's record on
varsity opportunities and
scholarships for women is not
significantly better than at
other schools.
According to the Education
Department's Office of Civil
Rights, which published Title
IX guidelines in 1975 and 1979,
the ratio of jmale to female ath
letes should reflect the break
down of the student body. Also,
athletic scholarships should be
distributed in proportion to the
ratio of male to female athletes.
According to an NCAA sex
equity survey of 253 Division I
schools, 1990-91 data show
