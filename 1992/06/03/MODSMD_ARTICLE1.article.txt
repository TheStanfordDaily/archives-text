# TITLE IX; 20 YEARS LATER
## Stanford not fully in compliance with sex-equity statute Needs more women's sports scholarships 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Less than a year after enter
ing Stanford as the top women's
soccer recruit, Kristen Wair is
bidding the Cardinal a reluctant
farewell.
The freshman from Oregon
was a four-time high school
Ail-American and won fresh
man All-American honors dur
ing her first season at Stan
ford. But without a scholar
ship, Wair lacked the financial
resources to remain here.
She said she had little choice
but to transfer — and she
chose the University of Port
land, where she will receive a
full-ride scholarship.
But had Stanford been in
better compliance with a fre
quently ignored sex-equity law
this year, Wair may have been
able to stay.
Proportionately, women
athletes receive fewer scholar
ships than men at Stanford,
and the Athletic Department
also provides women with
fewer varsity opportunities,
facts that place the University
in violation of federal sex-equi
ty laws passed two decades ago.
Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972 calls for
schools to end discriminatory
practices in many areas, includ
ing athletics. The sex-equity law
requires, among other things,
that all institutions receiving
federal aid meet certain stan
dards concerning the participa
tion rates of athletes and the
distribution of funds among
men's and women's teams.
Next year, at the urging of
an internal committee that ear
lier this year concluded a self
study on sex equity in the Ath
letic Department, Stanford will
take steps to bring its athletic
programs into compliance with
the law by adding several
women's scholarships.
Three scholarships will be
granted to the women's soccer

team, both in response to this
committee's urgings and to
appease the coach, Berhane
Andeberhan, who threatened
to quit last month because of
the lack of institutional sup
port for his team.

Proportionately,
women athletes
receive fewer
scholarships than
men at Stanford.

Also, a budget-driven 10-
percent scholarship reduction
in many men's sports — an
NCAA-mandated move that all
Division I schools will be imple
menting by 1993 — will have
the effect of narrowing the gap
between men's and women's
scholarship totals, bringing
Stanford into compliance with
that area of the sex-equity law.
Falling short
Despite the national promi
nence of Stanford's women's
teams and Athletic Director
Ted Leland's proclamation at a
recent Faculty Senate meeting
that Stanford has taken a lead
ership role in women's athlet
ics, the University's record on
varsity opportunities and
scholarships for women is not
significantly better than at
other schools.
According to the Education
Department's Office of Civil
Rights, which published Title
IX guidelines in 1975 and 1979,
the ratio of jmale to female ath
letes should reflect the break
down of the student body. Also,
athletic scholarships should be
distributed in proportion to the
ratio of male to female athletes.
According to an NCAA sex
equity survey of 253 Division I
schools, 1990-91 data show
that at the average university, women made up 30.9
percent of athletes and received 30.5 percent of
scholarships.
But at Stanford, women comprise 34 to 37 per
cent of athletes this year and receive only 29.7 per
cent of athletic scholarships.
So while Stanford provides more opportunities
for women at the varsity level than the average Divi
sion I school, female athletes here receive fewer
scholarships in proportion to their numbers.
The Athletic Department would have to add
about 15 or 16 women's scholarships to make the
percentage of scholarships correspond exactly with
the percentage of female athletes. However, federal
guidelines do not require such a precise correlation.
Although Stanford will bring its scholarship rate
into compliance with the law by the end of next year,
participation rates still won't be up to par according
to federal guidelines, which would require the break
down of athletes to reflect women's 45-percent share
of Stanford's student body.
"Our weakest area is participation," said Assoc.
Athletic Director Cheryl Levick, adding that another
internal committee will convene next fall to study
how Stanford can increase participation rates among
women athletes.
Most schools, however, have even lower participa
tion rates — as evidenced by the NCAA survey —
and no schools have achieved compliance with this
part of the law yet, according to Arthur Bryant, exec
utive director of the Trial Lawyers for Public Jus
tice, a legal firm that has handled several sex-equity
cases involving college athletics.
An "escape clause" in the law allows some leeway
in participation rates — if schools can justify the dis
crepancy and prove they are providing equal oppor
tunities to men and women, Leland said.
"They ask you if you've had a bunch of women
come in to make synchronized swimming or Softball
a varsity sport. No. Do you have a process by which
they can ask you? Yes. Then you're in compliance,"
Leland said in March.
But Leland recently acknowledged that it's diffi-

arships is the only

bers. The rest are

cult to buy the argument that women's interest in
athletics has been met and that steps to bring par
ticipation rates up are not needed.
"When you see all the female athletes out there,
the idea that there's not enough interest... I have a
hard time believing that," he said.
Beyond Title IX
Although law requires women athletes' participa
tion rate to reflect the breakdown of the student
body, and scholarship distribution to reflect the par
ticipation rate, the two issues are kept separate in
the Title IX guidelines. Scholarships are not directly
linked to enrollment.
However, some tire now pushing for the consoli
dation of these regulations, saying the number of
women's scholarships and the amount of money pro
vided to women's teams should be proportionate to
the percentage of women in the student body —
which is about half at most Division I schools,
according to the NCAA survey.
However, Leland calls this perspective "a new
argument, a new battleground."
"What people are saying is that women ought to
receive half the funding, half the scholarships and
half of everything, and that's not what Title IX
requires," Leland said. However, he added that, "It's
a legitimate argument to make. Financially frighten
ing, but a legitimate argument to make."
Disparities in 'gray areas'
Although Title EX covers a range of areas within
college athletics — including traveling, publicity and
recruiting budgets, as well as equipment and facili
ties — neither the law nor its interpretive guidelines
set specific parameters on how to judge compliance
in these areas.
Vast disparities persist at many colleges between
the financial assistance provided to men's and
women's sports, according to the results of the
recent NCAA survey. And these differences seem
most pronounced in those areas that are less strin
gently regulated in the Title IX guidelines.
"The area of scholarships is the only one you can
test with sheer numbers," Levick said. "The rest are

subjective."
Because of these "gray areas" within the sex-equi
ty guidelines, universities are often left to set their
own goals and determine the needs of their own pro
grams, Levick said.
According to the March survey — in which Stan
ford participated — the average Division I school
spends 77.4 percent of its operating budget on men's
teams, and puts 82.8 percent of recruiting funds
toward male athletes.
And this imbalance is not caused solely by foot
ball. Men's basketball receives an average of 2.75
times more funding than women's basketball at
these schools — a statistic that Stanford women's
basketball coach Tara VanDerveer said is on par
with the University's spending pattern.
"We're in that range. I'm sure of that," Van-
Derveer said.
But VanDerveer said she didn't know how the dis
crepancy was justified. "We have the same recruiting
rules, calendar and number of staff. We pay the
same price for plane tickets and have the same num
ber of games. How can there be twice as much
money for them?" she said.
Despite the disparities at Stanford, VanDerveer
said the University is "better than nine out of 10
schools."
"We want to get in full compliance [regarding]
operating budgets," Levick said, adding that the
Athletic Department intends to add to the operating
budgets in field hockey and softball and may later
consider adding scholarships to those sports.
Football, the major skewing factor
Equalizing participation rates and devising equi
table means of divvying up scholarships is compli
cated primarily by the predominance of football,
which receives 95 full scholarships and has no equiv
alent women's team.
"Any department with football is going to have a
hard time getting female participation rates equal to
enrollment," Levick said.
By 1995, the NCAA scholarship cap for football
will be lowered from 95 to 85. But Donna Lopiano,
executive director of the Women's Sports Founda-

tion, believes the limit should be even lower.
She recommends reducing the number of full-ride n
football scholarships to 70 and "increasing
ship density in high participation/large squad' 1
women's sports," such as swimming and diving,'
track and field, soccer and softball.
By increasing the number of scholarships within' 1
existing women's teams, schools can increase
arship opportunities without adding a lot of addi
tional programs — thus keeping personnel costs
down, Lopiano said.
And men's tennis coach Dick Gould also offered
up the football program as a possible place to cut/*
"Practically, its impossible to equalize," given the •
high density of scholarships in football, Gould said.
However, football is the greatest revenue-enhanc-'
ing sport, and most athletic directors are loathe to'
cut their department's cash cow. So the knife tends -
to fall on non-revenue men's programs, Levick said.
"The easiest way to comply is to cut men's pro-'
grams. But I think that's shortsighted and inappro-!
priate at Stanford," Leland said. "We want to make 7
progress with women's programs without decimat-'
ing men's programs."
Balancing budgets
The debate over sex-equity regulations has raged'
even hotter recently because many Athletic Depart- 1
ments are slashing their budgets.
"As the money and television revenues start
shrinking, many universities are looking at pro- 1
grams to cut," Levick said. "[Sex-equity issues] sur->
face when there's a budget crunch." '
The Athletic Department is in the process of cut
ting $700,000 from its operating budget, and its,
directors are attempting to balance financial and
sex-equity concerns in meeting their budget-reduc
tion target. s
Leland said he believes cutting men's sports was
an unacceptable means of either trimming the bud
get or equalizing men's and women's programs/
Rather, he favors making slow, steady changes in'
women's sports to bring them up to par with men's.
"We're trying to implement small incremental'
improvements in the women's programs," he said.*
