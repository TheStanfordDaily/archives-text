# Three years after massacre, most Chinese here are quiet
## But a few Stanford students still speak out against their government 
### Leta Hong Fincher Staff writer 
Since the People's Liberation Army
fired on peaceful demonstrators in
Tiananmen square in Beijing three
years ago tomorrow, many Chinese stu
dents say the level of activism against
the Chinese government has decreased.
However, this decrease in visible
protest does not mean that Chinese stu
dents have given up their hopes for
reform in their home country.
"Life is complicated. When we live,
we need to fight for democracy and
human rights, but that's not every
thing. We also need to think about eco
nomic reform for China, technological
development, scientific development
and also daily life," said Liu
Yongchuan, a Ph.D. student in sociolo
gy-
Yongchuan is one of the few Chinese
students who are still willing to speak
out publicly against the government
and allow his name to be used.
He was the first president of the
Independent Federation of Chinese
Students and Scholars, a national dissi
dent group formed after the massacre
of 1989. As a result of his activism, the
Chinese government has refused to
renew his passport.
Li Xiaorong, a Ph.D. student in phi
losophy, is another Chinese student
who remains politically visible. She has
published articles in the Human Rights
Tribune, a Chinese dissident journal
published in New York, as well as par
ticipating in other human rights
groups.
For the first year following the Bei
jing massacre, most Chinese students
unanimously protested the govern
ment, Xiaorong said.
"At first, everybody was shocked,
and so emotionally involved," she said.
Students joined together to organize
activities, and "people were more or less
in solidarity."
But many of the students who have
recently arrived from China are afraid
of being persecuted, Xiaorong said, and
even those who had originally been very

vocal are tired of protesting.
"They want this opportunity here to
study hard, and spend all their time
enjoying all the good things in the Unit
ed States," she said.
Yongchuan said although human
rights may no longer be at the top of the
students' agenda, they still believe in
political reform. "People are not chang
ing their beliefs in democracy, but
changing their strategy," he said.
Yongchuan said he often feels con
flict about which strategy he should use
to help China.
Both Yongchuan and Xiaorong
helped organize tomorrow's memorial
service which will take place in White
Plaza at noon. But Yongchuan said he
does not expect many Chinese students
to attend because they are more reluc
tant to draw attention to themselves
when there is no practical impact.
In addition, protest activities have
not attracted as much media coverage
recently. "If there were more media
coverage, more would show up,"
Yongchuan said.
Many of the students agreed that
despite their political repression, the
Chinese today enjoy more material
comforts than ever before in the Com
munist Party reign.
Because China's economy has devel
oped so rapidly over the last few years,
some say they no longer want to risk
the upheaval of sudden change from
communism to democracy.
One spouse of a Chinese Stanford
student, who asked to remain anony
mous, said China needs to develop eco
nomically before it can reform political
ly-
"Democracy can't feed people. The
people need food first of all. They need a
good standard of living. Without a good
life, without food to eat, even in Ameri
ca, democracy is just empty talk."
Another student, who also wanted to
speak anonymously, said the recent
government espousal of a free market
economy has only sharpened the con
tradictions within China.
"The Party says it's socialist, but
what's really thriving is not a socialist

economy," he said. "And they're saying
the Communist Party leaders serve the
people. Actually, the corruption is very,
very bad in China."
This student said he is worried that
the new generation in China will have
no moral standards because they are
"forced to have a split personality."
They must maintain a communist
facade, while in private they do whatev
er they want, and try to get rich. As a
result, he said, "everyone becomes a
cheater."

Party leaders 'need
legitimacy.... When
they cannot get legiti
macy from the interna
tional environment,
they have to turn... to
the people inside China.'
— Liu Yongchuan

Most Chinese agree economic reform;
will inevitably lead to political reform.'
According to Xiaorong, "when people;
have more interests of their own, then'
they will do something to protect that!
interest."
By the time people in China finally;
demand more political freedom, "either
the power-holders will have to say 'OK,'!
or they'll resist, and there's going to be
another uprising," Xiaorong said.
Yongchuan said even conservative;
Party leaders have become more sensi
tive to international pressure over the
last three years, so it is important for
those outside China to maintain their;
criticism of the government.
"[Party leaders] need legitimacy,-
they need support," Yongchuan said.!
"When they cannot get legitimacy from
the international environment, they;
have to turn their attention to the peo
ple inside China, and try to do some
thing good." !

the power-holders will have to say 'OK,'!

another uprising," Xiaorong said.
Yongchuan said even conservative;
Party leaders have become more sensi

last three years, so it is important for
those outside China to maintain their;
criticism of the government.
"[Party leaders] need legitimacy,-
they need support," Yongchuan said.!

have to turn their attention to the peo

In White Plaza in 1989, a woman protests the Chinese government's killing of hun
dreds, perhaps thousands, of peaceful demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Today,
many campus Chinese students are less willing to protest.
Since the People's Liberation Army
fired on peaceful demonstrators in
Tiananmen square in Beijing three
years ago tomorrow, many Chinese stu
dents say the level of activism against
the Chinese government has decreased.
However, this decrease in visible
protest does not mean that Chinese stu
dents have given up their hopes for
reform in their home country.
"Life is complicated. When we live,
we need to fight for democracy and
human rights, but that's not every
thing. We also need to think about eco
nomic reform for China, technological
development, scientific development
and also daily life," said Liu
Yongchuan, a Ph.D. student in sociolo
gy-
Yongchuan is one of the few Chinese
students who are still willing to speak
out publicly against the government
and allow his name to be used.
He was the first president of the
Independent Federation of Chinese
Students and Scholars, a national dissi
dent group formed after the massacre
of 1989. As a result of his activism, the
Chinese government has refused to
renew his passport.
Li Xiaorong, a Ph.D. student in phi
losophy, is another Chinese student
who remains politically visible. She has
published articles in the Human Rights
Tribune, a Chinese dissident journal
published in New York, as well as par
ticipating in other human rights
groups.
For the first year following the Bei
jing massacre, most Chinese students
unanimously protested the govern
ment, Xiaorong said.
"At first, everybody was shocked,
and so emotionally involved," she said.
Students joined together to organize
activities, and "people were more or less
in solidarity."
But many of the students who have
recently arrived from China are afraid
of being persecuted, Xiaorong said, and
even those who had originally been very

vocal are tired of protesting.
"They want this opportunity here to
study hard, and spend all their time
enjoying all the good things in the Unit
ed States," she said.
Yongchuan said although human
rights may no longer be at the top of the
students' agenda, they still believe in
political reform. "People are not chang
ing their beliefs in democracy, but
changing their strategy," he said.
Yongchuan said he often feels con
flict about which strategy he should use
to help China.
Both Yongchuan and Xiaorong
helped organize tomorrow's memorial
service which will take place in White
Plaza at noon. But Yongchuan said he
does not expect many Chinese students
to attend because they are more reluc
tant to draw attention to themselves
when there is no practical impact.
In addition, protest activities have
not attracted as much media coverage
recently. "If there were more media
coverage, more would show up,"
Yongchuan said.
Many of the students agreed that
despite their political repression, the
Chinese today enjoy more material
comforts than ever before in the Com
munist Party reign.
Because China's economy has devel
oped so rapidly over the last few years,
some say they no longer want to risk
the upheaval of sudden change from
communism to democracy.
One spouse of a Chinese Stanford
student, who asked to remain anony
mous, said China needs to develop eco
nomically before it can reform political
ly-
"Democracy can't feed people. The
people need food first of all. They need a
good standard of living. Without a good
life, without food to eat, even in Ameri
ca, democracy is just empty talk."
Another student, who also wanted to
speak anonymously, said the recent
government espousal of a free market
economy has only sharpened the con
tradictions within China.
"The Party says it's socialist, but
what's really thriving is not a socialist

economy," he said. "And they're saying
the Communist Party leaders serve the
people. Actually, the corruption is very,
very bad in China."
This student said he is worried that
the new generation in China will have
no moral standards because they are
"forced to have a split personality."
They must maintain a communist
facade, while in private they do whatev
er they want, and try to get rich. As a
result, he said, "everyone becomes a
cheater."

Party leaders 'need
legitimacy.... When
they cannot get legiti
macy from the interna
tional environment,
they have to turn... to
the people inside China.'
— Liu Yongchuan

Most Chinese agree economic reform;
will inevitably lead to political reform.'
According to Xiaorong, "when people;
have more interests of their own, then'
they will do something to protect that!
interest."
By the time people in China finally;
demand more political freedom, "either
the power-holders will have to say 'OK,'!
or they'll resist, and there's going to be
another uprising," Xiaorong said.
Yongchuan said even conservative;
Party leaders have become more sensi
tive to international pressure over the
last three years, so it is important for
those outside China to maintain their;
criticism of the government.
"[Party leaders] need legitimacy,-
they need support," Yongchuan said.!
