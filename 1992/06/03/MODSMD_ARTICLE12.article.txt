"The Huns used to ride
their horses to death, and
when they were thirsty,
they would stop and slit the
horses' veins and drink the
blood. I would like to see a
different attitude toward
the faculty by the adminis
tration and deans."
— German Prof. Gerald
Gillespie, who was unhappy
about a budget-cutting deci
sion to consolidate at least
five language and literature
departments. See story,
