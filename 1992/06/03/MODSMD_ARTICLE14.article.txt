## Editor's Farewell When 'private' isn't 
### 
Having two parents as
columnists made for a
naked childhood.
For columnists, every event,
every tidbit around them, is a win
dow into the profound.
Accordingly, my battles, failures
and embarrassing moments were all
"on the record," and some of them
were published for the edification of
the Los Angeles community.
The experience convinced me
that newspapers must never pre
vent interesting and important
information from being published
merely to prevent the embarrass
ment of persons involved. It also
made me empathetic with the
sources and subjects of The Daily's
articles.
During high school, my.mom
wrote about our first serious moth
er-son power battle. Her column
quoted from our fight.
"Don't you think you should
just talk to me about this and not
just tell me to do it?" he asked.
"The time when you could exer
cise your options has run out," I
responded. "You didn't do what
you said you were going to do. The
choice is no longer yours."
"Is this the kind of relationship
you want to have?" he demanded
angrily — veering from the point,
it seemed, to me.
"Yes it is," 1 glared back at him,
determined he would not succeed.
"Why?" His eyes narrowed, his
chin came forward.
"Because 1 say so," I growled.
We got angrier. We both said
things we didn't mean. The
wounds went deep.
The upshot is that I won the bat
tle, but, as you might expect, he
won the war. . . .
Newspapers are constantly danc
ing on the line between private and
public. Having lived a private life
that was often made public, I expe
rienced a hint of what it feels like to
be on the opposite end of the
reporter's pen. The difference is
that my columnist-parents cen
sored the childhood stories that
would have actually humiliated me.
Responsible editors and reporters,

though, don't hold back.
Once every few days, The Daily
faces a human being who does not
want to be in the newspaper, peri
od. Frustration, powerlessness,
rage, tears result.
But newspapers exist to make
information public, to help readers
understand the people and events
around them.
The Daily is often intrusive.
And it is The Daily's policy to print
people's names whenever possible.
The national media are often
criticized for selling papers at the
expense of victims or rightfully pri
vate citizens. It is a fair criticism.
Last year's "outing" of a high
level government official and a story
on the social history of an alleged
rape victim are two examples.
But many in the public are too
quick to stereotype all media as
irresponsible.
We write, despite protests, that
Gerhard Casper pondered the
elimination of financial aid in a
wide-ranging speech because his
views could change the lives of
thousands of students.
We investigate the compensation
and business practices of the Stan
ford Bookstore because questionable
management and investment deci
sions, even by the campus' largest
retailer, deserve public scrutiny.
We report about Keith Archuleta's
tragic downfall because he was an
inspiration to many students. How
could someone with such a passion
for justice exploit people who trusted
him? Without details, the communi
ty can't build an understanding.
During this election year, the
leading presidential contender, Ross
Perot, has chastised the press as
scoundrels for nagging him about
his views on constitutional govern
ment. Journalists would be wise to
remember both their bad reputa
tion and their own responsibility —
to the public and to themselves —
and keep printing all the news,
despite the groans and grimaces.
