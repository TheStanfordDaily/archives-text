## Unqualified commitments 
### 
GEORGE BUSH and Bill Clinton
would do well to stop by Stanford
sometime before the end of August.
They could learn something about being
presidential.
They could learn about listening to
and earning the respect of community
members. They could learn about blame
— including how to accept it. They could
learn about developing and pursuing a
vision. And they could learn about the
most basic aspect of leadership — inspir
ing others to excel.
All from watching the example set
every day by University President Don
ald Kennedy.
Whether advising freshmen, jogging to
the Dish, subletting his office space, let
ting Cory Booker live in his house or
allowing the Pi Phis to throw a party there
— more than anything else, Kennedy has
connected with the students.
On a very significant level, Kennedy
has made Stanford more than a school we
all attend; it is very definitely our home,
with Kennedy serving as family patriarch.
Life with father has been exciting. Con
troversy, natural disaster, athletic
prowess — we've had it all. And through it
all, Kennedy has maintained contact with
students, never breaking his pattern of
quarterly visits to The Daily, KZSU and
the ASSU Senate.
Do other university presidents mean
as much to their school's students?

Another prestigious university — Yale —
is losing its president, but the kids don't
seem to be all that sorry to see Benno
"George Washington Plunkett" Schmidt go.
Why? Because except for at gradua
tion, they never see him, anyway.
By contrast, Kennedy has been a con
stant presence — shaping the campus and
the community on a daily basis. Which to
us may seem natural — he is the president,
after all. But other college presidents can
not match the role Kennedy has played.
Even last spring and summer — at the
height of the indirect-cost agony after
which he felt compelled to resign — when
Kennedy might have withdrawn into the
matters at hand — he still found time for
students. And not because it was his job,
but because he wanted to, because he cared.
Do you remember Kennedy the cheer
leader at Big Game? Gray suit and all, he
jumped up on the yell-leader platform
and started leading the crowd in its wor
ship of yet another touchdown scored by
Tommy Vardell.
Driving home after the game, I paused
at a stop sign only to see Kennedy
approaching on his bike. As he came by, I
smiled and flashed him a victorious
thumbs-up, and this 60-year-old man on
a bicycle returned the gesture with
teenage exuberance.
Among other things, the Stanford expe
rience offers us the chance to take pride in
our friends' and classmates' accomplish

ments, not the least of which are athletic
triumphs. Consistent with his concern for
other student endeavors, Kennedy's devo
tion to Stanford athletics isn't the mania
of a generic sports fan; it reflects a genuine
desire for the Cardinal players to succeed.
In short, Kennedy's tenure will be most
remembered for a few unqualified com
mitments: a love of students, an interest
in their individual accomplishments as
well as their aggregate success, and a
desire, not just a willingness, to communi
cate with them on a personal level.
Not all that much, but not easy, either.
And thanks to Kennedy's 12 years of
service, these commitments are now an
integral part of the presidential job
description.
Gerhard Casper doesn't have to,
indeed shouldn't try to, connect with stu
dents in the way Kennedy has; he must
be himself, and we should all look for
ward to the freshness he will bring.
There is a rejuvenation in such newness.
But Casper will have to connect. That
standard has been set.

By the way, after flashing that thumbs-up,
Kennedy continued biking — right through
the stop sign! Hmmph. You 're fired!
