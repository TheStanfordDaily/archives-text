7 got off track 9 : Archuleta's resignation statement

IT IS CLEAR TO ME TIIAT for the
sake of the students, the University
and myself, 1 must resign my posi
tion and leave the University. This is a
time for healing, and my presence will
not aid in that process.
Also, I know I can never regain the
trust of the community. The damage is
irreparable. I regret that it is in these
circumstances that I leave the Universi
ty.
Over the weekend, I was in a state of
shock regarding the situation I found
myself in. And I was in a state of denial
as to the severity of the problem when I
responded to calls from the press. I was
not as candid as I should have been with
the media.
I want to make it clear now that I
bear responsibility for the hurt and con
fusion I have caused. Over the last few
days, I have hoped that I would wake up
from this terrible nightmare and all

would be well. I'm sure there are others
who are feeling the same way. I regret
that my nightmare has spilled over and
affected so many lives.
I have let so many people down and
lost the respect and trust I have worked
so hard over the years to build.
I want to say publicly to the students
and others that I have directly and
deeply offended that I hope someday you
will forgive me and understand that my
intentions were not to hurt you or any
one.
Somewhere along the line, I got off
track, and I need and will seek help now
to make my life whole again.
I know nothing I can say can relieve
the hurt, anger and humiliation that my
actions have caused. I only hope that the
full resources and love of the community
can be brought together to ease your
pain.
This has been the lowest ebb of my

life. To cause your life and the lives of
others to be played out for the world to
see is humiliating and devastating. For
so long, I have carried the weight of the
community on my shoulders and have
been there to support everyone else to
the point that I lost track of myself.
My life has gone out of balance, and
in the process, I have caused some of
those that I care the most about a great
deal of hurt and pain. Further, I deeply
and sincerely regret this.
I want to thank everyone who has
called and sent letters expressing sup
port for me as a person. The true test is
not when things are going well and
everyone loves you; the true test is when
you are at your darkest hour.
For in your darkest hours, you learn
who cares about you, find God's com
forting arms to rest in, learn more about
yourself.
I ask everyone at Stanford who has '

supported me over the years to now turn
your love and attention to helping heal
the wounds created in this community
and support all those involved. I ask for
your prayers and your compassion. I
leave everything in the Lord's hands and
ask for guidance and support as I try to
move on with my life.
To all the students who have worked
to build a more just and pluralistic Stan
ford community, and to link with the
people of East Palo Alto and surround
ing communities, I urge you to carry on.
We have come so far on so many
issues. Do not let my human imperfec
tion stand in the way of your efforts to
create a more perfect University and
society.
The world desperately needs your
ideas, energy and idealism.
