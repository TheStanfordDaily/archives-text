# Lecturer dismayed by Fac Sen's CIV decision
## 
### 
I was dismayed to learn that the Fac
ulty Senate has voted to retain the CIV
requirement for transfer students,
against the express recommendations of
the CIV administration, the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies and many
people who teach in the program.
There are strong pedagogic reasons
why the present rule ought to have been
reconsidered:
1. It is already challenging to find n
common idiom with which to address a
class whose members represent a full
cross-section of the diverse freshman
class. When upper division students are
added to that, the problems are greatly
complicated.
To the extent that CIV seeks to
impart "a common intellectual experi-

ence to the freshman class" (one of the
key arguments against relaxing the old
Western Culture core list), the presence
of even a few advanced students in a sec
tion can undermine this objective.
2. As most of them will attest, the
requirement cuts severely into the six or
at most nine quarters transfer students
have at Stanford.
Once they have fulfilled their distri
bution requirements and the require
ments of their prospective majors, there
remains almost no "play" in the system
which would enable them to choose and
experiment — an essential component of
a properly liberal education.
A few resign themselves to an under
graduate curriculum that is almost com
pletely structured for them in advance and
prove to be splendid citizens of the class
room. They are, however, the exception.
This is by no means intended as an
indictment of transfer students them
selves. To the contrary, many of our best

teaching experiences in CIV have come
from interactions with more mature stu
dents who are better able to appreciate
the ideas we address.
I do believe, however, that it would
have been easy to retain some manner of
breadth requirement that would enable
them to choose from a larger pool of
courses that may complement their cho
sen fields of study.
A more representative governing body
would never have made this ill-conceived
decision.
