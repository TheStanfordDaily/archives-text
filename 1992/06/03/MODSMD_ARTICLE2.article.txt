# Archuleta resigns, admits a 'problem'
## Long-time administrator arrested for secretly videotaping women 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Amid allegations that he secretly video
taped several women while they changed
clothes in his bedroom photography studio,
Asst. Dean of Students Keith Archuleta
resigned yesterday.
Archuleta was arrested Friday evening,
hours after a female student told police he had
secretly videotaped her while she changed
clothes after a photography session Thursday
in his Mirrielees apartment.
Mary Edmonds, vice president for student
resources, accepted Archuleta's resignation
yesterday.
"This is the proper resolution," she said in
a press release. "The resignation permanently
severs Mr. Archuleta's contact with the Uni
versity and the students affected."

Archuleta, the widely respected director of
the Black Community Services Center and
long-time Mirrielees Resident Fellow, had
been placed on paid leave and banned from
campus Saturday by Edmonds.
The University issued a statement about
the incident the same day. House meetings
were held Sunday afternoon between dis
traught administrators and stunned residents
of Mirrielees and Ujamaa.
The student, who said she agreed to model
— fully clothed — for a photography project of
Archuleta's, told police she noticed the video
camera in the corner after Archuleta left the
room while she changed. The camera was
recording, she said.
Before arresting Archuleta, police received
10 to 15 videotapes, several of which contain
"relevant" footage of women who had agreed to
be photographed, according to Stanford Police

Chief Marvin Herrington.
Herrington, who has
viewed portions of the tapes,
said he believed Archuleta
intended to use them to watch
the women undress. He
declined to reveal how police
obtained the tapes, or the con
tents of the footage.
Herrington said he did not

know how many women appeared on the
videotapes, but said several seemed to be stu
dents. So far, he said, three student victims
have been identified. Their names will not
become public unless the district attorney
presses charges.
An investigation will continue until "as many
victims as possible are identified," Herrington

said. He said he did not ask
Archuleta to help identify the
women on the tapes.
A report was filed yesterday
with district attorney Margo
Smith, who will decide whether to
press charges of "eavesdropping
by electronic device." She would
not speculate when her investiga
tion will end.
The three women will be asked
to testify against Archuleta if the
district attorney presses charges,
Herrington said. Eavesdropping
can be treated as a felony or mis
demeanor charge, he said.
The University's press state
ment about the arrest prompted
widespread local media coverage.
In early reports, Archuleta denied
wrongdoing.
A message on the answering
machine in his apartment told
callers Sunday, "I'm hanging in
there considering the circum
stances. Please don't believe
everything you read in the
papers."
Hut in his resignation state
ment issued yesterday, he said, "I
was in a state of denial as to the
severity of the problem when I
responded to calls from the press.
I was not as candid as I should
have been with the media."
According to a story in Mon
day's San Jose Mercury News,
Archuleta said the video camera
helped him correct problems with
background lighting in the pho
tographs, which he planned to
publish in a book of his poems.
But in an interview with The

Daily the same day, an emotional
Archuleta acknowledged he had a
problem.
"I am human," he said, voice
cracking. "Part of the problem is
that I have carried so much on my
shoulders for so long. ... I have
not taken care of myself."
Archuleta indicated to admin
istrators he would seek psychi
atric counseling.
In his resignation statement he
said, "I want to make it clear now
that I bear responsibility for the
hurt and confusion I have
caused."
After this year's and next
year's Mirrielees residence staffs
met with Dean of Students
Michael Jackson, an "emergency"
house meeting for residents to
discuss emotions and questions
aroused by the news was sched
uled for noon Sunday.
A similar meeting took place at
2 p.m. in Ujamaa, the black theme
house.
Jackson said the meetings
were also intended to direct possi
ble victims and other students
toward the emotional and psycho
logical support they might need.
About 90 of Mirrielees' 280
residents crowded into the fourth
floor lounge. Many did not know
why the meeting was called.
At the beginning of each meet
ing, Edmonds read a story from
Sunday's San Francisco Examin
er to the students, who were
asked to vote whether the meet
ings would be open to a Daily
reporter.
Students in both dorms opted
for closed meetings.
Afterward, some participants
said the discussions crystallized
the ambivalence many — particu

larly members of the black com
munity — have about the incident.
While many expressed sorrow
and support for Archuleta, whose
leadership was widely admired,
most condemned the alleged
secret videotaping.
One participant said condem
nation of Archuleta's alleged
action was particularly powerful
after a victim shared her story in
front of what Jackson estimated
to be 100 Ujamaa residents.
The woman, who also
described her experience to
approximately 100 members of a
"Group Communication" class,
asked not to be identified in The
Daily because of the ongoing
criminal investigation.
The Daily attempted to contact
another victim, who told her story
to the same class. She did not
return a phone call yesterday.
Senior Danzy Senna, an Uja
maa resident who attended the
meeting, said students didn't
want the allegation to "diminish"
Archuleta's contributions to Stan
ford. "But at the same time ... we
find this horrible," she said.
"It's just weird to find out that
people have these sides you don't
know about," Senna said.
CAPS counselor Doug Daher,
who attended both meetings, said
ambivalence is normal. "Anyone
connected with Keith is bound to
have a range of feelings," he said.
Police Chief Herrington said
he, too, was struggling with feel
ings of shock and betrayal.
"Here's a person everybody felt
trust in. . . . I'd known him for 15
years."
In the University's statement
released Saturday afternoon,
Jackson said, "We are deeply dis

turbed by this situation and
regret that an employee who has
made significant contributions to
the university finds himself in
such a position."
But in an interview yesterday,
Jackson sharpened his criticism
of Archuleta. "The actions that
[he] engaged in are totally unac
ceptable," he said.
"A breach of trust cannot be
condoned or tolerated in any per
son who holds a position of
authority, leadership or power at
Stanford or any other place," he
said.
Archuleta did not return phone
calls yesterday. It is unclear
whether his resignation was a
result of University pressure or
his own choice.
Jackson said many administra
tors "encouraged [Archuleta's
resignation] and thought it was
the responsible thing."
His office's "key" objectives
now, Jackson said, are to support
and protect students, especially
the victims.
When asked whether the
nature of Archuleta's relation
ships with female staff and stu
dents had ever been questioned,
Jackson paused before saying,
"There was never a question in
my mind [Archuleta] was operat
ing in a very professional man
ner.
"[Archuleta] has been working
for me for a number of years," he
added. "There was nothing in his
file" that would have indicated
past problems, he said.
Jackson hired Archuleta in
1988 to be Stanford's first full
time ethnic dean. Before his resig
nation, Archuleta was one of 12
assistant deans of students.

Ann Porteus, director of Resi
dential Education, will fill in as
Mirrielees' RF until the end of the
academic year, Jackson said.
Archuleta will be allowed to
remove his belongings from his
apartment in the dormitory after
graduation "on a supervised
basis," Jackson said.
Jackson said he hoped the dis
closures would "bring people even
closer together to support each
other."
Archuleta's six-page resume on
file at University News Service
reflects a long history of contribu
tions to Stanford.
Recently, he acted as a leader
in the campus protest against the
acquittal of police officers who
beat Rodney King. He also coordi
nated a week-long Martin Luther
King, Jr. celebration in January.
In 1989, when 54 students
took over University President
Donald Kennedy's office, Archule
ta was the only administrator
protesters allowed to enter the
building.
When one protester, Louis
Jackson, was singled out by police
and charged with incitement to
riot and battery, Archuleta said
racism was behind the arrest. He
spearheaded an appeal to the
administration to use its influ
ence to drop charges against Jack
son, although Kennedy refused to
do so.
Throughout his undergraduate
career, Archuleta ran "Black Per
spectives," a show on KZSU
Radio. He Co-chaired the Black
Student Union during his senior
year, and wrote a job description
for the directorship of the Black
Community Services Center he
received 10 years later.
