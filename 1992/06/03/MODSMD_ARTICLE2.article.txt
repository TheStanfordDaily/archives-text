## Long-time administrator arrested for secretly videotaping women 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Amid allegations that he secretly video
taped several women while they changed
clothes in his bedroom photography studio,
Asst. Dean of Students Keith Archuleta
resigned yesterday.
Archuleta was arrested Friday evening,
hours after a female student told police he had
secretly videotaped her while she changed
clothes after a photography session Thursday
in his Mirrielees apartment.
Mary Edmonds, vice president for student
resources, accepted Archuleta's resignation
yesterday.
"This is the proper resolution," she said in
a press release. "The resignation permanently
severs Mr. Archuleta's contact with the Uni
versity and the students affected."

Archuleta, the widely respected director of
the Black Community Services Center and
long-time Mirrielees Resident Fellow, had
been placed on paid leave and banned from
campus Saturday by Edmonds.
The University issued a statement about
the incident the same day. House meetings
were held Sunday afternoon between dis
traught administrators and stunned residents
of Mirrielees and Ujamaa.
The student, who said she agreed to model
— fully clothed — for a photography project of
Archuleta's, told police she noticed the video
camera in the corner after Archuleta left the
room while she changed. The camera was
recording, she said.
Before arresting Archuleta, police received
10 to 15 videotapes, several of which contain
"relevant" footage of women who had agreed to
be photographed, according to Stanford Police

Chief Marvin Herrington.
Herrington, who has
viewed portions of the tapes,
said he believed Archuleta
intended to use them to watch
the women undress. He
declined to reveal how police
obtained the tapes, or the con
tents of the footage.
Herrington said he did not

know how many women appeared on the
videotapes, but said several seemed to be stu
dents. So far, he said, three student victims
have been identified. Their names will not
become public unless the district attorney
presses charges.
An investigation will continue until "as many
victims as possible are identified," Herrington
