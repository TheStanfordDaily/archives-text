# Discovering 'shadow side' of human nature
## 
### 
Disbelief, hurt, betrayal, grief, sympa
thy and rage emerge like waves from the
sea. They batter and tear at the bound-

Aries of ourselves and our institution,
forever changing who and what we are.
A man's life as it once was defined has
ended, and the trust and innocence of
many women have been defiled. It feels
so defeating. We work so hard as women
in the struggle to empower and protect
ourselves. When does the cycle stop?
Why does this process feel so inevitable?
We cannot ignore or deny it. We are
called upon to muster our integrity and
once more examine our moral selves.
Once again, through our pain, we are
forced to learn about the shadow side of
human nature, come to terms with this,
and heal.
The Campus Sexual Assault Response
and Recovery Team (c-SARRT) is here
to acknowledge your rage, your hurt and
youi: fears. We are here to help you and
be with you as you grow and heal. Our
phone number is 723-3785.
