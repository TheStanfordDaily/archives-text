1 WOULD LIKE to say a few things
about Sharon Beaulaurier's May 26
letter concerning the issue of safety
of women in public. This is an issue that
has been catching my attention in all
forms for quite some time now, and I
can no longer remain in silence.
As a woman, I understand and am
aware that the reality of rape is a poten
tial threat to any woman. I agree that no
woman should consider herself invinci
ble, but I do not think women should
suffer from paranoia.
Perhaps, according to Beaulaurier's
letter, I should feel helpless and afraid
whenever I set foot on a solitary path. I
should suspect every man who happens
to be walking in the same direction of
harboring an insane desire to harass me,

hurt me, even to rape me. Simply
because I'm a woman, and because the
world is full of evil men.
But I enjoy my life. I go wherever I
want, at whatever time of day or night. I
love mountain biking, especially as the sun
goes down, and I always go alone. Why?
Because I do not let fear run my life. You
may say to me, if you go out like this alone,
especially at night, you're asking for it.
But there is a significant difference
between mountain biking at Stanford on
a balmy afternoon and taking a stroll in
the woods at midnight, between window
shopping in Palo Alto and waiting for
the Metro in New York.
I too have lived in a big city — I have
been followed, "harassed" both verbally
and physically, and yes, I have been scared

when strangers appeared from a dark
shadow and followed me with questions
about my age, occupation, address, etc.
Yet that has never stopped me from
catching the subway late at night, from
going out to meet my friends somewhere
else in the city. I refuse to stay indoors
because of a possible unpleasant
encounter with a man. Or because of the
fear of getting hit by a car, murdered,
mugged or killed in a drive-by shooting.
The crime, the harassment Beaulauri
er speaks of is first a psychological matter
before becoming a physical reality. If I
walk down a street afraid of being raped
or harassed, the fear shows on my face.
Try confidence. This means not wish
ing that no one will attack you, but
knowing that you are perfectly capable

of handling a stranger. It means not
inducing debilitating fear within your
self. It means living your life.
Of course there are times when even
the most self-assured woman is
approached on that dusty path in the
foothills. But how many more times is it
a man who just wants to talk to her,
because she's the only human being for
miles around. Does he not have the right
to talk to a fellow human being?
Maybe he wants to ask the time of
day, or comment on the model of her
mountain bike. In Beaulaurier's article,
the man who stopped and talked to her
never touched her, never even asked for
her phone number. Apparently his only
crime is the fact that he did dare to
speak to her. And what did he say?

"Hello."
Whether I do put up my guard
depends on the situation in which I find
myself with this man. If it's in White
Plaza, I'll stop and chat for a half hour if
he's got something interesting to say. If
it's on a deserted path or by the side of a
public pool, I watch what I tell him. If I
feel he's asking things he has no business
knowing, I am the one who does the ask
ing, offering no information about myself
but instead demanding it from him.
All I have relied on to write this letter
is my own instincts, my own reactions,
my own philosophy. And since I do have
a philosophy about life, I have chosen to
make it a healthy one.
