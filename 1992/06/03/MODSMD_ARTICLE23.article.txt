# Cowell clarifies myths about condoms, safety
## 
### 
A recent letter to The Daily reported
that "condoms [were] not perfect protec
tion; only reduce AIDS risk." While this
is true, the letter contained some inaccu
racies which deserve response.
The writers question the reliability of
condoms because of their concerns about
heat damage to the condoms in trans
port. Drug companies cite that condoms
should be kept in temperatures below
100 degrees, not 86 degrees as stated.
In fact, this is a potential problem for
any drug or appliance which is transport
ed, and it is an issue over which the phar
maceutical company (or anyone else) has
no control. Condoms should of course be
inspected before use. Whether the effec
tiveness of the condom is actually harmed
by heat is open to question: condoms do
break, but is it because of heat exposure?
The writers bring up the "pore size"
issue, that the "pores" in condoms are
larger than the virus. In fact, "scanning
electron microscopy of stretched latex
condoms has demonstrated surface
irregularities, but no pores" (American
Journal of Public Health, 1988).
Studies done on just this issue of leak
age and reported in the Journal of the
American Medical Association demon
strated that "undamaged condoms pro
vide an effective physical barrier against
HIV, and nonoxynol 9 may provide an
effective chemical barrier as well." (1988).
A third comment was that the Food
and Drug Administration states only
that condoms "offer an element of risk
reduction," not absolute protection. This

is true, as condoms may slip off or break.
Lastly, they state that "individuals
and organizations [e.g. resident assis
tants, resident fellows, Cowell coun
selors, Stanford University] can be held
liable for the 'wrongful death' of some
one infected with HIV who used con
doms based on their recommendations."
This statement has been reviewed
with university counsel, who advises
that this would only be true if the indi
vidual or organization stated that con
doms were "substantially certain" to be
protective, which we do not say.
The American Journal of Public
Health has emphasized that "while use
of condoms or spermicides is unlikely to
be harmful, there is the potential for
harm if their use is substituted for absti
nence, monogamy, or good judgement.. .
. Condoms or spermicides must be used
at every sexual encounter to prevent HIV
transmission whether or not one of the
partners is sterilized, during menstrua
tion ... and during vaginal, anal and
possibly oral intercourse." (1988).
