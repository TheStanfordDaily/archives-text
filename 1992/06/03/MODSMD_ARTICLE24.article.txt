# Neglectful Bookstore board urged to resign
## 
### 
I am writing to express my outrage
that the board of directors of the Stanford
Bookstore have not resigned. The reports
in The Daily over the last few months

should have been sufficient to make the
Bookstore's board realize that they were,
at best, woefully neglectful of their
responsibilities and, at worst, not quali
fied to hold their positions on the board.
That the Bookstore's board still
believes that the general manager, Eldon
Speed, and his assistant manager, Philip
Chiaramonte, are the proper people to
conduct the Bookstore's business is
nothing less than incredible.
I would suggest to the Bookstore's
board that the end of the academic year
is the appropriate time for a complete
change, in both the board and Bookstore
management.
