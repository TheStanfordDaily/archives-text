# Boycott the Bookstore until honesty is shown
## 
### 
First, I would like to commend The
Daily for its splendid investigative report
on the Stanford Bookstore. The Stanford
community would never have found out
about this gross misappropriation of
funds had it not been for your fine efforts.
However, I do not think that this
question should be brushed aside so
quickly under an umbrella of pleasant
euphemisms that obfuscate the sordid
truth. Some of the managers of a pur
portedly non-profit bookstore that
enjoys a complete monopoly and gets fat
by charging high prices to a captive buy
ing public have used our money both for
personal gain and to promote a lifestyle
of the rich and famous.
Now we know why we receive a mere
pittance at the end of the Bookstore's fiscal

year. We have been financing its expansion
together with these frivolous expenditures.
This is both reprehensible and immoral. To
try to hide behind a thin veil of language
makes it even more disgusting.
Unfortunately, corporate vampirism
is a sign of the times. Make the connec
tion â€” resist it here at Stanford by boy
cotting the Bookstore and by buying as
many things as you can elsewhere.
Don't let the barrage of Bookstore spe
cials designed to make you forgive and
forget past abuses fool you. The corporate
mentality relies on the deadening of the
senses and on generalized amnesia fueled
by short-term goodies designed to win
over the hearts of its buyers. This mental
ity is characterized by a pervasive attitude
of greed, cynicism and self-centeredness.
I am not satisfied with hypocritical
euphemisms for pillage and betray of
trust. Let the Bookstore's board of direc
tors really show us it has our interests
at heart and provide us with new man
agement that will combine growth with
competence and honesty.
