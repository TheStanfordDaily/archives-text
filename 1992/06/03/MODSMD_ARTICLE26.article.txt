# BSU officers saddened by the Archuleta arrest
## 
### 
We, members of the Black Student
Union, are shocked and saddened by the
events that led to the arrest of Keith
Archuleta, a long time leader of the
Stanford African-American community.
While recognizing his many contribu
tions, we do not condone his behavior
and feel that our primary concern is and
should be with the women who have

been affected by his actions. And we sup
port them in expressing their feelings of
anger and violation.
As we reflect on the issues which have
been raised and deal with the pain that
they evoke, we know that our communi
ty will survive and be strengthened by
this incident.
Our community outreach, cultural
programs and mission in supporting the
African-American community will con
tinue to exist and thrive.
Keith instilled within many of us a
great sense of self-worth and his actions
have deeply betrayed this belief.
We feel it most important to focus our
attention on creating an open and com
forting environment for the women who
need us most.
We must embrace all who are injured
by this event and hope that the lost trust
and stability can be rebuilt and nurtured
in order for us to grow and move on.
