# After Hours
## When the clock strikes midnight, most of the campus scurries off to bed. But for some, the day has just begun... 
### Julie Makinen Joel Stein Staff writers 
To the outside observer, the campus after
midnight looks like a T.S. Elliot poem. The
libraries are closed, the streets are bare,
and the stockings hang from the chimneys
with care.
But to the trained eye, the campus pulses with

excitement. Freshmen tell
tainted secrets in the pri
vacy of their hallways.
Sororities hold bizarre rit
uals in the Inner Quad.
Young men and women
sneak out of their dorms
to enjoy the midnight air
— and then some.
As midnight
approached on Friday,
May 14, and the clock
tower prepared to make
lots of noise, the campus
began to crawl around like
those little Doozer guys
from Fraggle Rock.
12:01 a.m. —
Students from all over
campus converge upon the
one spot after dark where
pizza and key lime frozen
yogurt can be purchased
with a meal card —
Kimball dining hall.
"It's fun to people
watch," explains Jenny
Curtis, an undeclared
freshman and a Kimball
regular.
Other students go to
Kimball primarily for the
food.
"It's become kind of a
regular thing now that I
have a girlfriend with
points," said senior
Bennett Wilbur.

"That's right. He's just milking me for my
points," said junior Betty Ng, his girlfriend.
Kimball rakes in between $2,000 and $2,500 a
night — more than any of the dining halls earn in one
day, said senior Peter Goebel, the student manager.
12:23 a.m. — Things are beginning to wind
down at the Kappa Sigma "Lost in America" party.
Several people begin pairing off in heterosexual
twosomes and heading off down hallways in the
house.
The freshman Pi Phi who was named "Miss
America" for the evening is still strutting around
the house prominently displaying both her Wonder
Woman-esque costume and her newly acquired
tiara.
12:45 a.m. — "If you're going to do something
dumb, you might as well make it amusing and ran
dom," advises Ethan Rikleen, a fifth-year senior
who was discovered with two Kappa Alpha Theta
women in front of Memorial Church.
Rikleen and his friends, sophomore Molly Parker
and freshman Ellie Rice, spent their evening in the
Quad drinking wine coolers, eating Pop-Tarts, play
ing with Legos and blowing bubbles.
The festivities were in honor of Rice, who recent
ly joined the sorority.
1:43 a.m. — Buses return from the Senior Pub
Night held in San Francisco. Laughter and bus
songs fill the air as staggering seniors are led out of
a small, yet freshly scented bus.
"Senior pub night in the city was very fulfilling
in every sense of the word," said Sarah Blanch, a
senior majoring in political science. "Stimulating,
pulsating and gyrating are the three words which
basically sum it up."
"Basically, add '-ating' to any word," Blanch
said, hiccupping.
Others, however, are huddled over a woman and
a fresh puddle of vomit in the Tresidder parking lot.
The young woman was not available for com
ment.
2:17 a.m. — Two graduate students play an
intense game of backgammon on a wooden table out
side of the Coffee House. No one else is in sight.
Sometimes we go to Denny's, Lyon's or Ken's
but they have been unreceptive to our game play
ing explained John Bazigos, a masters student in
computer science.
