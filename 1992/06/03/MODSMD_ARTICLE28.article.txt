# The 						Year in Review:

Budget decisions
Deficits dominated much of
this year, as the University strug
gled to cope with its $43 million
budget shortfall.
A 12-page statement released
in October announced budget
reduction targets for the Univer
sity's schools and administrative
areas, along with decisions on
"central initiatives" such as over
seas campuses and financial aid.
The year-long discussions
involved everyone from the Facul
ty Senate to the Council of Presi
dents, and were the focus of a
number of faculty, staff and stu
dent forums.
But many directly affected by
the proposed cuts thought their
voices had been ignored.
When a proposal surfaced to
cut the arts in early November,
more than 600 people jammed
White Plaza to protest. While
their efforts staved off total elimi
nation of drama and music, the
departments were still the hard
est hit by cuts.
Other areas facing significant
reductions over the next two
years include the humanities, the
libraries and administrative staff
support.
The deficit — caused primarily
by a combination of the indirect
cost controversy and the recession
— also forced the University to
abandon its pledge to limit tuition
hikes to 1 percent above the rate
of inflation.
"We made a commitment about
holding down costs, but we have
made a much more fundamental
commitment to maintain the qual
ity of a Stanford education," said
former Provost James Rosse in
announcing the 9.5 percent
increase in tuition. "We have found
that we can no longer meet both of
those commitments at once."
But this year's $43 million
deficit does not signal the end of
Stanford's budget woes. Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy
warned the senate in February of
"substantial" additional deficits
in the next two years — perhaps
as much as $10-15 million.

Provost steps down
Winding down a 25-year career
at Stanford, Provost James Rosse
announced in January that he
would leave Stanford in April to
become president and chief execu
tive officer of Freedom Newspa
pers, a Southern California media
chain.

University President Donald
Kennedy chose Statistics Prof.
Gerald Lieberman, a veteran fac
ulty leader, to succeed Rosse.
Lieberman, who has chaired
the Faculty Senate and oversaw
Stanford's Centennial Celebra
tion, is expected to serve several
months into the tenure of Stan
ford's next president.
Rosse's announcement took the
campus by surprise; though most
faculty members had expected him
to resign in the next year or so,
they thought he would likely stay
at provost to himself guide the
transition to a new administration.
Respected by faculty members
for his integrity and hard work,
Rosse was considered a master of
process, adept at designing proce
dures by which the University
navigated some of its most diffi
cult decisions, including the
debates over the Reagan Library
and the creation of the Cultures,
Ideas and Values program.
More recently, Rosse conceived
and led the process by which the
University decided how to cut $43
million from its operating budget.

Jan. 29

Cost hearing held
A year-long series of new alle
gations — including another con
gressional hearing — demonstrat
ed that Stanford was not the only
university with indirect-cost
problems.
A second hearing revealed a
"systemic" problem in the way
the federal government reimburs
es universities for indirect costs.
"The subcommittee has been
dismayed to discover the depth
and breadth of the indirect-cost
abuses at universities," said Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., chair of
the House Subcommittee of Over
sight and Investigations.
Other schools such as the Uni
versity of Michigan, Syracuse
University and UC-Berkeley were
also found by government audi
tors to have included inappropri
ate charges as indirect costs.
But despite the inclusion of
other universities in the indirect
cost controversy, Stanford's situ
ation continued to show little sign
of improvement.
In November, the University
appealed the Navy's abrupt reduc
tion of its 1991 indirect-cost rate to
the Armed Services Board of Con
tract Appeals. The legal process is
likely to take at least 18 months.
A study released in early Jan
uary by the Defense Contract
Audit Agency alleged that the
University overcharged the gov
ernment by at least $310 million
during the 1980s, although the

agency's conclusions assume that
approximately 100 cost account
ing agreements signed during the
decade are retroactively canceled.
Perhaps the only bright spot
for the University came in Febru
ary, when Paul Biddle, the contro
versial on-campus Navy regula
tor, announced his resignation to
pursue a run for Congress.
Meanwhile, Stanford contin
ues to negotiate with the govern
ment for a new indirect-cost rate.
The current default rate of 55.5
percent is costing the University
more than $25 million per year.

Thomas sentenced
Senior Stuart Thomas was sen
tenced for two misdemeanors —
statutory rape and providing alco
hol to a minor — in the conclusion
of a case that sparked a campus
debate on acquaintance rape and
the boundaries of consent.
Thomas received two years of
probation, 100 hours of community
service and a $1,000 fine as punish
ment in a Santa Clara County Supe
rior Court hearing that was covered
by two local television stations and
about half a dozen newspapers.
In addition, the Stanford Judi
cial Council determined last
month that Thomas — who
earned enough units to graduate
fall quarter — violated University
policy.

Thomas' de
gree could be held
for a designated
number of quar
ters or it could
never be granted,
among other pun
ishments. The
final decision will
probably not be
come public until

■ i ivniua i —
this fall, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
A 17-year-old freshman
woman had reported to Stanford
Police Sept. 23 that Thomas
raped her the day before in her
Stern Hall dormitory.
When Thomas was arrested
nine days later, he was not charged
by the district attorney with
forcible rape or with six related
counts recommended by the Stan
ford Police's investigating officer.
Experts said the district attor
ney's reluctance to charge
Thomas with forcible rape
showed that the D.A. believed the
woman's lack of consent would be
difficult to prove under the cir
cumstances of the case.
The woman told police that
Thomas had not threatened her,
but said she did feel a " certain
coercion," mentioning Thomas'

physical size, the persuasive man
ner in which he spoke to her and
the impairment of her judgement
due to alcohol.
Thomas, at 6-foot-7, is a foot and
half taller than the woman. Accord
ing to the police report, he gave the
woman — who had drunk alcohol
only once before — one-half can of
beer and eight drinks of Peppermint
Schnapps in less than two hours.
Members of the Stanford com
munity applauded the woman's
courage in reporting the rape and
following through on the long, dif
ficult process, and said her exam
ple would encourage other women
to report rapes.
"When a case in this socio
political environment comes to
this end, that's a message," said
Gail Prichard, coordinator of the
Campus Sexual Assault Response
and Recovery Team. "Hopefully,
we can use this as a springboard
for sexual assault education."

Anti-gay comments
When first-year law student
Keith Rabois directed anti-gay
remarks toward the residence of
Otero Resident Fellow Dennis
Matthies, the Stanford community
responded — mostly through fly

ers, posters and letters to The
Daily — for more than a month

after the incident.
The question
of free speech on
campus — espe
cially at Stanford,
which has been
accused of sup
pressing ideas
through "politi
cal correctness"
— was debated,

along with issues related to homo
sexuality and homophobia.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said that since Rabois
had not violated the Fundamental
Standard, he could not be pun
ished. Instead, the University
responded by publicizing the inci
dent, Jackson said.
Rabois defended his remarks
by saying that he was testing the
Fundamental Standard and try
ing to break the "very regimented
orthodoxy" that he believed
Matthies promoted in Otero.
Some Law School community
members responded by sending a
letter detailing Rabois' comments
to a law firm that he had hoped to
work for. About 400 law students
signed a petition condemning
Rabois' comments.
Several posters with Rabois'
picture on them appeared in the
Law School after the incident was
publicized, asking students to

write down their reactions.
But others complained that the
responses were personal attacks
on Rabois, rather than valid views
of the free speech issue.
Rabois and Matthies later
agreed to discuss the incident
with callers, but not each other,
on the February 19 premiere of
"Talk Back," a weekly radio pro
gram broadcast on KZSU.

Bookstore perks
Senior employees at the Stanford
Bookstore enjoy a host of lavish
perquisites unheard of elsewhere in
the college-bookstore industry, The
Daily reported in February.
The perks included luxury
automobiles, use of a motor
home, and use of a vacation home
in central California, which the
Bookstore rents from a consulting
firm owned by its two senior man
agers, Eldon Speed and Philip
Chiaramonte.
The Daily reported in March
that the Bookstore also lost $1.8
million in investments which one
member of its board of directors
described as "rather speculative."
The disclosures led to an inves
tigation by the California attor
ney general, likely to finish late

Budget decisions
Deficits dominated much of
this year, as the University strug
gled to cope with its $43 million
budget shortfall.
A 12-page statement released
in October announced budget
reduction targets for the Univer
sity's schools and administrative
areas, along with decisions on
"central initiatives" such as over
seas campuses and financial aid.
The year-long discussions
involved everyone from the Facul
ty Senate to the Council of Presi
dents, and were the focus of a
number of faculty, staff and stu
dent forums.
But many directly affected by
the proposed cuts thought their
voices had been ignored.
When a proposal surfaced to
cut the arts in early November,
more than 600 people jammed
White Plaza to protest. While
their efforts staved off total elimi
nation of drama and music, the
departments were still the hard
est hit by cuts.
Other areas facing significant
reductions over the next two
years include the humanities, the
libraries and administrative staff
support.
The deficit — caused primarily
by a combination of the indirect
cost controversy and the recession
— also forced the University to
abandon its pledge to limit tuition
hikes to 1 percent above the rate
of inflation.
"We made a commitment about
holding down costs, but we have
made a much more fundamental
commitment to maintain the qual
ity of a Stanford education," said
former Provost James Rosse in
announcing the 9.5 percent
increase in tuition. "We have found
that we can no longer meet both of
those commitments at once."
But this year's $43 million
deficit does not signal the end of
Stanford's budget woes. Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy
warned the senate in February of
"substantial" additional deficits
in the next two years — perhaps
as much as $10-15 million.

Provost steps down
Winding down a 25-year career
at Stanford, Provost James Rosse
announced in January that he
would leave Stanford in April to
become president and chief execu
tive officer of Freedom Newspa
pers, a Southern California media
chain.

University President Donald
Kennedy chose Statistics Prof.
Gerald Lieberman, a veteran fac
ulty leader, to succeed Rosse.
Lieberman, who has chaired
the Faculty Senate and oversaw
Stanford's Centennial Celebra
tion, is expected to serve several
months into the tenure of Stan
ford's next president.
Rosse's announcement took the
campus by surprise; though most
faculty members had expected him
to resign in the next year or so,
they thought he would likely stay
at provost to himself guide the
transition to a new administration.
Respected by faculty members
for his integrity and hard work,
Rosse was considered a master of
process, adept at designing proce
dures by which the University
navigated some of its most diffi
cult decisions, including the
debates over the Reagan Library
and the creation of the Cultures,
Ideas and Values program.
More recently, Rosse conceived
and led the process by which the
University decided how to cut $43
million from its operating budget.

Cost hearing held
A year-long series of new alle
gations — including another con
gressional hearing — demonstrat
ed that Stanford was not the only
university with indirect-cost
problems.
A second hearing revealed a
"systemic" problem in the way
the federal government reimburs
es universities for indirect costs.
"The subcommittee has been
dismayed to discover the depth
and breadth of the indirect-cost
abuses at universities," said Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., chair of
the House Subcommittee of Over
sight and Investigations.
Other schools such as the Uni
versity of Michigan, Syracuse
University and UC-Berkeley were
also found by government audi
tors to have included inappropri
ate charges as indirect costs.
But despite the inclusion of
other universities in the indirect
cost controversy, Stanford's situ
ation continued to show little sign
of improvement.
In November, the University
appealed the Navy's abrupt reduc
tion of its 1991 indirect-cost rate to
the Armed Services Board of Con
tract Appeals. The legal process is
likely to take at least 18 months.
A study released in early Jan
uary by the Defense Contract
Audit Agency alleged that the
University overcharged the gov
ernment by at least $310 million
during the 1980s, although the

agency's conclusions assume that
approximately 100 cost account
ing agreements signed during the
decade are retroactively canceled.
Perhaps the only bright spot
for the University came in Febru
ary, when Paul Biddle, the contro
versial on-campus Navy regula
tor, announced his resignation to
pursue a run for Congress.
Meanwhile, Stanford contin
ues to negotiate with the govern
ment for a new indirect-cost rate.
The current default rate of 55.5
percent is costing the University
more than $25 million per year.

Thomas sentenced
Senior Stuart Thomas was sen
tenced for two misdemeanors —
statutory rape and providing alco
hol to a minor — in the conclusion
of a case that sparked a campus
debate on acquaintance rape and
the boundaries of consent.
Thomas received two years of
probation, 100 hours of community
service and a $1,000 fine as punish
ment in a Santa Clara County Supe
rior Court hearing that was covered
by two local television stations and
about half a dozen newspapers.
In addition, the Stanford Judi
cial Council determined last
month that Thomas — who
earned enough units to graduate
fall quarter — violated University
policy.

Thomas' de
gree could be held
for a designated
number of quar
ters or it could
never be granted,
among other pun
ishments. The
final decision will
probably not be
come public until

■ i ivniua i —
this fall, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
A 17-year-old freshman
woman had reported to Stanford
Police Sept. 23 that Thomas
raped her the day before in her
Stern Hall dormitory.
When Thomas was arrested
nine days later, he was not charged
by the district attorney with
forcible rape or with six related
counts recommended by the Stan
ford Police's investigating officer.
Experts said the district attor
ney's reluctance to charge
Thomas with forcible rape
showed that the D.A. believed the
woman's lack of consent would be
difficult to prove under the cir
cumstances of the case.
The woman told police that
Thomas had not threatened her,
but said she did feel a " certain
coercion," mentioning Thomas'

physical size, the persuasive man
ner in which he spoke to her and
the impairment of her judgement
due to alcohol.
Thomas, at 6-foot-7, is a foot and
half taller than the woman. Accord
ing to the police report, he gave the
woman — who had drunk alcohol
only once before — one-half can of
beer and eight drinks of Peppermint
Schnapps in less than two hours.
Members of the Stanford com
munity applauded the woman's
courage in reporting the rape and
following through on the long, dif
ficult process, and said her exam
ple would encourage other women
to report rapes.
"When a case in this socio
political environment comes to
this end, that's a message," said
Gail Prichard, coordinator of the
Campus Sexual Assault Response
and Recovery Team. "Hopefully,
we can use this as a springboard
for sexual assault education."

Anti-gay comments
When first-year law student
Keith Rabois directed anti-gay
remarks toward the residence of
Otero Resident Fellow Dennis
Matthies, the Stanford community
responded — mostly through fly

ers, posters and letters to The
Daily — for more than a month

after the incident.
The question
of free speech on
campus — espe
cially at Stanford,
which has been
accused of sup
pressing ideas
through "politi
cal correctness"
— was debated,

along with issues related to homo
sexuality and homophobia.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said that since Rabois
had not violated the Fundamental
Standard, he could not be pun
ished. Instead, the University
responded by publicizing the inci
dent, Jackson said.
Rabois defended his remarks
by saying that he was testing the
Fundamental Standard and try
ing to break the "very regimented
orthodoxy" that he believed
Matthies promoted in Otero.
Some Law School community
members responded by sending a
letter detailing Rabois' comments
to a law firm that he had hoped to
work for. About 400 law students
signed a petition condemning
Rabois' comments.
Several posters with Rabois'
picture on them appeared in the
Law School after the incident was
publicized, asking students to

write down their reactions.
But others complained that the
responses were personal attacks
on Rabois, rather than valid views
of the free speech issue.
Rabois and Matthies later
agreed to discuss the incident
with callers, but not each other,
on the February 19 premiere of
"Talk Back," a weekly radio pro
gram broadcast on KZSU.

Bookstore perks
Senior employees at the Stanford
Bookstore enjoy a host of lavish
perquisites unheard of elsewhere in
the college-bookstore industry, The

The perks included luxury
automobiles, use of a motor
home, and use of a vacation home
in central California, which the
Bookstore rents from a consulting
firm owned by its two senior man
agers, Eldon Speed and Philip
Chiaramonte.
The Daily reported in March
that the Bookstore also lost $1.8

Bookstore perks
Senior employees at the Stanford
Bookstore enjoy a host of lavish
perquisites unheard of elsewhere in
the college-bookstore industry, The
Daily reported in February.
The perks included luxury
automobiles, use of a motor
home, and use of a vacation home
in central California, which the
Bookstore rents from a consulting
firm owned by its two senior man
agers, Eldon Speed and Philip
Chiaramonte.
The Daily reported in March
that the Bookstore also lost $1.8
million in investments which one
member of its board of directors
described as "rather speculative."
The disclosures led to an inves
tigation by the California attor
ney general, likely to finish late

Budget decisions
Deficits dominated much of
this year, as the University strug
gled to cope with its $43 million
budget shortfall.
A 12-page statement released
in October announced budget
reduction targets for the Univer
sity's schools and administrative
areas, along with decisions on
"central initiatives" such as over
seas campuses and financial aid.
The year-long discussions
involved everyone from the Facul
ty Senate to the Council of Presi
dents, and were the focus of a
number of faculty, staff and stu
dent forums.
But many directly affected by
the proposed cuts thought their
voices had been ignored.
When a proposal surfaced to
cut the arts in early November,
more than 600 people jammed
White Plaza to protest. While
their efforts staved off total elimi
nation of drama and music, the
departments were still the hard
est hit by cuts.
Other areas facing significant
reductions over the next two
years include the humanities, the
libraries and administrative staff
support.
The deficit — caused primarily
by a combination of the indirect
cost controversy and the recession
— also forced the University to
abandon its pledge to limit tuition
hikes to 1 percent above the rate
of inflation.
"We made a commitment about
holding down costs, but we have
made a much more fundamental
commitment to maintain the qual
ity of a Stanford education," said
former Provost James Rosse in
announcing the 9.5 percent
increase in tuition. "We have found
that we can no longer meet both of
those commitments at once."
But this year's $43 million
deficit does not signal the end of
Stanford's budget woes. Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy
warned the senate in February of
"substantial" additional deficits
in the next two years — perhaps
as much as $10-15 million.

Provost steps down
Winding down a 25-year career
at Stanford, Provost James Rosse
announced in January that he
would leave Stanford in April to
become president and chief execu
tive officer of Freedom Newspa
pers, a Southern California media
chain.

University President Donald
Kennedy chose Statistics Prof.
Gerald Lieberman, a veteran fac
ulty leader, to succeed Rosse.
Lieberman, who has chaired
the Faculty Senate and oversaw
Stanford's Centennial Celebra
tion, is expected to serve several
months into the tenure of Stan
ford's next president.
Rosse's announcement took the
campus by surprise; though most
faculty members had expected him
to resign in the next year or so,
they thought he would likely stay
at provost to himself guide the
transition to a new administration.
Respected by faculty members
for his integrity and hard work,
Rosse was considered a master of
process, adept at designing proce
dures by which the University
navigated some of its most diffi
cult decisions, including the
debates over the Reagan Library
and the creation of the Cultures,
Ideas and Values program.
More recently, Rosse conceived
and led the process by which the
University decided how to cut $43
million from its operating budget.

Cost hearing held
A year-long series of new alle
gations — including another con
gressional hearing — demonstrat
ed that Stanford was not the only
university with indirect-cost
problems.
A second hearing revealed a
"systemic" problem in the way
the federal government reimburs
es universities for indirect costs.
"The subcommittee has been
dismayed to discover the depth
and breadth of the indirect-cost
abuses at universities," said Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., chair of
the House Subcommittee of Over
sight and Investigations.
Other schools such as the Uni
versity of Michigan, Syracuse
University and UC-Berkeley were
also found by government audi
tors to have included inappropri
ate charges as indirect costs.
But despite the inclusion of
other universities in the indirect
cost controversy, Stanford's situ
ation continued to show little sign
of improvement.
In November, the University
appealed the Navy's abrupt reduc
tion of its 1991 indirect-cost rate to
the Armed Services Board of Con
tract Appeals. The legal process is
likely to take at least 18 months.
A study released in early Jan
uary by the Defense Contract
Audit Agency alleged that the
University overcharged the gov
ernment by at least $310 million
during the 1980s, although the

agency's conclusions assume that
approximately 100 cost account
ing agreements signed during the
decade are retroactively canceled.
Perhaps the only bright spot
for the University came in Febru
ary, when Paul Biddle, the contro
versial on-campus Navy regula
tor, announced his resignation to
pursue a run for Congress.
Meanwhile, Stanford contin
ues to negotiate with the govern
ment for a new indirect-cost rate.
The current default rate of 55.5
percent is costing the University
more than $25 million per year.

Thomas sentenced
Senior Stuart Thomas was sen
tenced for two misdemeanors —
statutory rape and providing alco
hol to a minor — in the conclusion
of a case that sparked a campus
debate on acquaintance rape and
the boundaries of consent.
Thomas received two years of
probation, 100 hours of community
service and a $1,000 fine as punish
ment in a Santa Clara County Supe
rior Court hearing that was covered
by two local television stations and
about half a dozen newspapers.
In addition, the Stanford Judi
cial Council determined last
month that Thomas — who
earned enough units to graduate
fall quarter — violated University
policy.

Thomas' de
gree could be held
for a designated
number of quar
ters or it could
never be granted,
among other pun
ishments. The
final decision will
probably not be
come public until

■ i ivniua i —
this fall, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
A 17-year-old freshman
woman had reported to Stanford
Police Sept. 23 that Thomas
raped her the day before in her
Stern Hall dormitory.
When Thomas was arrested
nine days later, he was not charged
by the district attorney with
forcible rape or with six related
counts recommended by the Stan
ford Police's investigating officer.
Experts said the district attor
ney's reluctance to charge
Thomas with forcible rape
showed that the D.A. believed the
woman's lack of consent would be
difficult to prove under the cir
cumstances of the case.
The woman told police that
Thomas had not threatened her,
but said she did feel a " certain
coercion," mentioning Thomas'

physical size, the persuasive man
ner in which he spoke to her and
the impairment of her judgement
due to alcohol.
Thomas, at 6-foot-7, is a foot and
half taller than the woman. Accord
ing to the police report, he gave the
woman — who had drunk alcohol
only once before — one-half can of
beer and eight drinks of Peppermint
Schnapps in less than two hours.
Members of the Stanford com
munity applauded the woman's
courage in reporting the rape and
following through on the long, dif
ficult process, and said her exam
ple would encourage other women
to report rapes.
"When a case in this socio
political environment comes to
this end, that's a message," said
Gail Prichard, coordinator of the
Campus Sexual Assault Response
and Recovery Team. "Hopefully,
we can use this as a springboard
for sexual assault education."

Anti-gay comments
When first-year law student
Keith Rabois directed anti-gay
remarks toward the residence of
Otero Resident Fellow Dennis
Matthies, the Stanford community
responded — mostly through fly

ers, posters and letters to The
Daily — for more than a month

after the incident.
The question
of free speech on
campus — espe
cially at Stanford,
which has been
accused of sup
pressing ideas
through "politi
cal correctness"
— was debated,

along with issues related to homo
sexuality and homophobia.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said that since Rabois
had not violated the Fundamental
Standard, he could not be pun
ished. Instead, the University
responded by publicizing the inci
dent, Jackson said.
Rabois defended his remarks
by saying that he was testing the
Fundamental Standard and try
ing to break the "very regimented
orthodoxy" that he believed
Matthies promoted in Otero.
Some Law School community
members responded by sending a
letter detailing Rabois' comments
to a law firm that he had hoped to
work for. About 400 law students
signed a petition condemning
Rabois' comments.
Several posters with Rabois'
picture on them appeared in the
Law School after the incident was
publicized, asking students to

write down their reactions.
But others complained that the
responses were personal attacks
on Rabois, rather than valid views
of the free speech issue.
Rabois and Matthies later
agreed to discuss the incident
with callers, but not each other,
on the February 19 premiere of
"Talk Back," a weekly radio pro
gram broadcast on KZSU.
