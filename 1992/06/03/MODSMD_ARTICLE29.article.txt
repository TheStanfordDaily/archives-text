The Bookstore's board, follow
ing some recommendations of an
audit report which it commis
sioned, terminated the perks and
initiated a plan to reform the
Bookstore's governance and pro
vide more aggressive oversight.
On May 28 The Daily reported
that the Bookstore receives one of
the most generous leases in the
college-bookstore industry, pay
ing less than $40,000 for its main
campus site. Industry officials say
the lease may be worth more than
$3 million per year.
University officials said Stan
ford has no intention of re-negoti
ating the lease, whose terms last
through the year 2000. But Law
Prof. Robert Weisberg, a
spokesperson for the Bookstore's
board, said the board may at some
point in the next few years consid
er sharing more of the Book
store's income with the Universi
ty through a new lease agree
ment.

New president chosen
Gerhard Casper, the provost at
the University of Chicago, was
appointed Stanford's ninth presi
dent March 17 following a highly
secretive, six-month search pro
cess that produced 667 nominees
and was completed three months
before its deadline.
The newly selected president

immediately announced a com
mitment to improving undergrad
uate education and downsizing
Stanford's administration.
Casper, a German immigrant
who became a national authority

on Constitutional law, comes new
to Stanford, having served the
last 25 years of his academic
career at the University of Chica
go.
Although Chicago has a repu
tation for academic traditional
ism, members of Stanford's presi
dential search committee said
they were convinced that Casper
was a good match with Stanford.
Soon after being announced as
the next president, he became the
target of Stanford crusaders of all
types, who tried to enlist him in
campaigns to save self-defense
courses, preserve need-blind
admissions and revisit the "fight
ing words" amendment to the
Fundamental Standard.
But Casper has been noncom
mittal on such issues, saying that
it will take him some time to learn
enough about Stanford to make
specific decisions.
Casper said in March that he
will almost certainly select a
provost from among Stanford's
faculty.

'Prefer' elected
The ASSU spring election
came to an unexpected end as a
group of four students promising
to dismantle the Council of Presi
dents was elected next year's
COP.
Running a campaign that capi
talized on student dissatisfaction
with the ASSU, the"I Prefer Not

to Have a COP" slate beat out the
Students First, "Independents: A
New Era" and the Chaparral's
"You!" slates to win the COP elec
tion with 51 percent of the votes.
The People's Platform party
did not run a slate in the election.
The Prefer slate — composed
of Ed Mun, Ted Lai, Blake Ilstrup
and Jay Jackson — called the
COP "effect-less" and said the
Council's $16,000 salary was a

waste of student money. The slate
pledged to place a constitutional
amendment on next year's spring
ballot dissolving the COP.
A fake editorial endorsing the
Prefer slate, which was substitut
ed at the printer's and appeared
in The Daily, likely helped the
slate to an election victory, as did
the preferential balloting system
used in the COP election for the
first time.
After the election, the ASSU
Senate passed a budget removing
all money from the COP's budget.
Then-COP member John Overdeck
said the money was taken away to
make sure the Prefer slate did not
assume office and collect salaries
without doing any work.

King verdict reaction
While angry citizens rioted in
Los Angeles and San Francisco
over the acquittal of four white
police officers involved in the Rod
ney King beating, Stanford react
ed quickly and peacefully with a
midnight march to the Palo Alto
police station.
The multiracial crowd of about
300 called for an end to human

rights abuses and injustice in the
American judicial system and
society.
While many protesters rallied,
others stayed behind to work on a
letter-writing and petition cam
paign, as well as plans for a con
tinuing protest movement which
came to be called the Stanford
Community Action Coalition.
In the days that followed, stu
dents wore black to "mourn the
death of justice in this country,"
according to Ujamaa resident
assistant Bacardi Jackson. Stu
dent groups worked with the
coalition and on their own to plan
other events protesting the ver
dict.
On May 1, a noon rally drew
more than 1,500 people to listen
to speeches and songs by ethnic
community leaders. The rally cul
minated in another march to the
Palo Alto police station, where the
crowd blocked traffic for more
than an hour.
During the march, leaders
called for a boycott of Copeland's
Sports — a store that boarded its
windows in anticipation of vio
lence. Leaders said the store
"insulted" the group by assuming
the protest would turn violent.
As follow-ups to the rallies,
students and faculty organized
events ranging from teach-ins to
programs in East Palo Alto. The
Community Action Coalition
worked to set up a cultural and
educational center and sponsor
events ranging from a book drive
to an expanded Big Sibling/Little

Sibling program.
Faculty and staff responded by
placing two full-page advertise
ments in The New York Times
criticizing the verdict. More than
700 faculty and staff donated a
total of $19,500 for the effort.

Gorbachev returns
Though his first visit was a big
ger event, former Soviet Presi
dent Mikhail Gorbachev's second
visit to Stanford was eagerly
anticipated by the community and
marked by an unexpectedly high
demand for tickets.
The highlight of the visit —
Gorbachev's 11:15 speech — was
moved from its original site in
Memorial Auditorium to Frost
Amphitheater to accommodate an
audience of about 10,500.
Entitled "The Rule of Law,"
the speech defended actions Gor
bachev had taken during his rule.
"I simply could not betray
myself," he said, referring to pres
sure that others had put on him
to use his powers to take "an
extremist position."
Some Stanford scholars criti
cized the Gorbachev for oversim-

plifying history, and said the
speech was not particularly
revealing.
The former president, now
head of the non-profit Gorbachev
Foundation/USA, and his wife,
Raisa, also toured the Hoover
Institution and viewed an exhibit
of Russian revolutionary artifacts
called "A Century of Revolutions:
Lenin to Gorbachev." The couple
had missed the exhibit on their
first Stanford visit in June 1990.
Gorbachev at one point during
the tour talked about forming a
relationship between Hoover and
his foundation. However, no spe
cific plans were made.
While at Stanford, the Gor
bachevs were guests of former
Secretary of State George Shultz,
who is a Hoover distinguished fel
low. Their itinerary included
breakfast and dinner with the
Shultzes and a luncheon at
Hoover the day of his speech.
The visit was part of Gor
bachev's 16-day tour of seven U.S.
cities to promote and raise funds
for his foundation, which was
established to promote democrat
ic reform in the former Soviet
republics.
Entrepreneurs capitalized on
the speech by selling Gorby T
shirts and other souvenirs. But
ticket scalpers didn't have much
luck, sometimes giving them away
— quite a change from the Soviet
leader's 1990 visit, when tickets
were rumored to have gone for as
much as $1,800.
