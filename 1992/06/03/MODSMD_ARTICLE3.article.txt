### 
Republican congressman
and Stanford Law Prof. Tom
Campbell lost his chance of
becoming a U.S. senator after
being narrowly defeated by for
mer TV commentator Bruce
Herschensohn in yesterday's
primary election.
With 91 percent of the votes
counted at 2:30 a.m., Her
schensohn had captured 39
percent of the vote for a sur
prise victory over Campbell,
according to the Associated
Press. Campbell received 35
percent of the vote.
Some Republicans criticized
Campbell during his campaign

from Herschensohn, a Reagan-esque
conservative who is against abortion
and environmental reforms.
Herschensohn also opposes
gun-control and military cuts,
while Campbell supports both.
The marked differences between
these two key Republican candi
dates turned yesterday's primary
race into a crucial one for the Cali
fornia GOP.
"This particular race probably
represents something significant
for the party," said Political Sci
ence Prof. Hubert Marshall, not
ing that the outcome of the pri
mary affects the "control and
direction of the Republican party"
— which will retain its conserva
tive base.
Herschensohn's victory "sim
ply means consolidation in the

Republican party of the real right
wing," Marshall said.
But Marshall added that Her
schensohn's extreme conservatism
would face a difficult challenge in
the fall. He said Herschensohn is
"too conservative for the state."
Before the final results were
in, Marshall predicted that "who
ever the Democratic party had for
its nominee would beat Herschen
sohn."
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody agreed. Brody said that
while Campbell's moderate Repub
lican position would have ensured
a tight race in the fall against
Democratic senate candidate Bar
bara Boxer, Herschensohn's
staunch conservatism may sway
more voters in the opposite direc
tion in the November Senate race.
"Barbara Boxer will have a
much easier time in the fall," he
said.
Law School Dean Paul Brest
offered two interpretations of

Campbell's defeat in the Republi
can primary. He said that while
the state "will lose the opportuni
ty to have a very good senator,"
the Law School will regain "a first
rate professor."
Campbell taught at the Law
School from 1983 to 1989, when
he went on leave to run for
Congress.
But Brest speculated that while
Campbell may have lost his bid for
the Senate, other doors could soon
open to him if a Republican presi
dent is elected in the fall.
"It wouldn't surprise me if the
federal administrators would
want to use his talents for some
purpose," Brest said.
Awaiting the primary results
in the early evening at a prema
ture victory party for the con
gressman, Campbell's Stanford
campus organizer, sophomore
Josh Ross, said supporters "were
all really tense" but remained
confident.
