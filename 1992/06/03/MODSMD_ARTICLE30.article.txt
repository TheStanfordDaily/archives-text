## Feinstein, Boxer sweep California's Democratic primary 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -
Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Bar
bara Boxer won Democratic nom
inations to separate U.S. Senate
seats yesterday after campaigning

as the ultimate political outsiders
— women.
Feminist leaders called the
women's victories historic and
predicted these wins, and others

by women, will send shock waves
across the political spectrum.
"If Bill Clinton wins the White
House, it's going to be on the coat
tails of women candidates," said
Jane Danowitz, executive director
of the Women's Campaign Fund
in Washington. "They're the only
candidates right now that are
stimulating the kind of interest
that it's gonna take to win this
election."
The Feinstein and Boxer victo
ries raise the possibility that Cali
fornia voters in November could
unilaterally double the number of
women serving in the U.S. Senate
from two to four.
As of 2:30 a.m. today, with 92
percent of the precincts reporting,
Boxer had 1,204,262 votes, or 43
percent, followed by Lt. Gov. Leo
McCarthy with 861,096 votes, or
30 percent, and Rep. Mel Levine
with 613,679 votes, or 22 percent.
"We've won the first round
and in November we'll go on to
win the main event," Boxer said
at a Hollywood victory parly.
"This campaign is about opening
those Senate doors and letting all
the people of California in."
Voters will have a sharp choice
in the general election. Boxer,
who is among the more liberal
members of Congress, will face a
strong conservative, Rep. Bruce
Herschensohn. He defeated mod
erate Rep. Tom Campbell in the
GOP primary.
With 91 percent of the
precincts reporting, Herschen
sohn had 846,837 votes to Camp
bell's 773,584 votes — 39 percent
to 35 percent. Palm Springs
Mayor Sonny Bono, who never
shook his image as a lightweight,
trailed with 17 percent, and four
other candidates divided the
remainder.
Sen. John Seymour got a solid
vote of confidence in the Republi
can primary to fill the final two
years of the term abandoned by

Pete Wilson when he became Cal
ifornia's governor. Wilson
appointed Seymour as his succes
sor, but the former state senator
still has to stand for election.
With 91 percent of the
precincts reporting, Seymour had
1,073,139 votes, or 52 percent, to
553,556 votes, or 27 percent, for
Rep. William Dannemeyer, who is
considered more conservative.
Two other candidates trailed,
including dentist Jim Trinity,
who picked up a surprising 13
percent.
With 92 percent reporting in
the Democratic race for the two
year seat, Feinstein, the former
San Francisco mayor, had
1,600,134 votes, or 57 percent.

State Controller Gray Davis was
far back with 926,496 votes, or 33
percent, and two other candidates
had 5 percent each.
Both Feinstein and Boxer ran
unabashedly gender-based cam
paigns, referring repeatedly to
the paucity of women in the Sen
ate.
Their victories and that of ear
lier primary victories by women in
Illinois and Pennsylvania, mean
there is the potential for the
women's caucus to swell to as
many as seven next year.
Both Feinstein and Boxer will
face male candidates in Novem
ber.
Feinstein was fond of saying on
the stump that 2 percent is good

enough for milk but not for the
Senate.
"We Californians want funda
mental change and we won't set
tle for anything less," she told
supporters at a San Francisco vic
tory rally.
Boxer ran a more fiery cam
paign, saying it would take a
female fighter to shake up the
male-dominated Senate, which
she likened to a men-only country
club.
Her campaign — and her out
sider image — hit a snag when she
got wrapped up in the ultimate
Washington insider's scandal, the
congressional check bouncing
affair. Boxer wrote 143 bad
checks on the House bank.
