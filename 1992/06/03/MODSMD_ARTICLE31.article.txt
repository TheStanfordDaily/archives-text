(AP) — In other highlights of
yesterday's voting in nine states
on the busiest state primaiy day of
1992, Alabama Sen. Richard Shel
by won the Democratic nomina
tion for a second term and House
members survived challenges over
bad checks in Ohio and lowa
Voters in North Carolina and
Alabama narrowed fields of can
didates en route to electing their
first black members of Congress
this century.
In Alabama, Shelby easily
dispatched three opponents,
including Chris McNair, a coun
ty commissioner whose daugh
ter was one of four black girls
killed in the 1963 Birmingham
church bombing.
With 96 percent of precincts
reporting, Shelby had 293,516
votes or 61 percent, McNair had
131,782 votes or 28 percent, and
the two other candidates split
the remainder.
McNair had sought support
from black voters and from
women angry over Shelby's vote
to confirm Clarence Thomas to
the Supreme Court despite alle
gations of sexual harassment by
Anita Hill.
Conceding defeat, McNair
said he forced Shelby to address
issues he would not have other
wise. "I offer no apologies for
what we have gone through," he
said. "Don't let this die here.
The work must go on."
Two other senators seeking
re-election escaped primaiy chal
lenges. In Ohio, Lt. Gov. Mike
DeWine won a GOP primary for
the right to challenge Democrat
John Glenn in November. lowa
state Sen. Jean Lloyd-Jones won
the Democratic nomination to
oppose Republican Sen. Charles

Grassley. She said she entered
the race after watching him dur
ing the Hill-Thomas hearings.
In Ohio, Rep. Mary Rose
Oakar won the Democratic nom
ination for a ninth term in the
Cleveland area despite a stiff
challenge based partly on her
213 overdrafts. With all
precincts reporting, she was
winning 39 percent of the vote,
compared to 30 percent for her
closest of six challengers, county
commissioner Timothy Hagan.
"You defied all the prophets
who said we could not win this

'Don't let this die
here. The work
must go on.'
— Chris McNair

one, and I want to tell you ... I
could never have survived this
primary without your help,"
she told her supporters.
In southern Ohio, two
incumbent Republican con
gressmen thrown together
because of redistricting ran a
close race. With all precincts
reporting, Rep. Bob McEwen,
who wrote 166 bad checks,
clung to a 1,000-vote lead over
Rep. Clarence Miller. An official
canvass over the next few days
would determine whether a
recount was required.
lowa's four-term GOP Rep.
Jim Ross Lightfoot, who admit
ted to 105 overdrafts, defeated
political unknown Ronald J.
Long by a margin of 58 percent
to 42 percent.
New Jersey Democratic Rep.

Frank Pallone survived a chal
lenge from Assemblyman Bob
Smith and two other candidates
to win the nomination for a third
term in a newly drawn district.
Smith had campaigned as an
"outsider" challenging a Wash
ington "insider." With 99 per
cent of precincts in, Pallone led
Smith 54 percent to 38 percent.
The results were a sharp con
trast to primaries last week that
saw bad-check writers in Ken
tucky and Arkansas go down to
defeat. Before Tuesday, nine
House members and one sena
tor had been ousted this year in
primaries.
Offspring of some famous
political names were making
bids for Congress. In Alabama's
2nd District, state Treasurer
George Wallace Jr. led a three
way race for the Democratic
nomination but appeared head
ed for a runoff. Maureen Rea
gan, daughter of the former
president, was running a close
second in a GOP primary in the
Los Angeles area, while J. Ben
nett Johnston 3rd, son of the
Louisiana senator, was running
third out of nine Democrats in a
Northern California district.
Voters in North Carolina's
Ist District Democratic runoff
set up the possibility the state
could elect two black members
of Congress in November. Black
businesswoman Eva Clayton
defeated Walter Jones Jr., who
is white and the son of the dis
trict's retiring incumbent. She
will face Ted Tyler, the white
GOP nominee. In the 12th Dis
trict, Barbara Gore Washington
won a GOP runoff and will face
Democratic nominee Mel Watt.
Both are black.
