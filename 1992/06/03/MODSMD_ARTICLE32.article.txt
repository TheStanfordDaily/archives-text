# Clinton, Perot seek outsider image in White House quest
## 
### 
(AP) — Bill Clinton locked up the Democratic
presidential nomination with a six-state sweep and
quickly promised to wrest Washington from the
"forces of the status quo." But Ross Perot showed
fresh strength on Clinton's victory night.
President Bush added six more wins to his unde
feated streak against Patrick Buchanan in yester
day's coast-to-coast balloting, another topsy-turvy
day in which voters sounded a call for change but
appeared uncertain about how to trigger it.
"I am going to give you a campaign with a vision
of an America that works again, that rewards work,
that invests in people, that insists on responsibility
and that pulls us together as one nation under God,"
a triumphant Clinton promised.
His next big task: selecting a running mate.
The Arkansas governor's final flourish closed a
roller-coaster nominating contest and included a
win over lone primary rival Jerry Brown in Califor
nia, where Brown served eight years as governor.
Brown, winning four out of every 10 votes in his
home state, could take satisfaction from a
respectable showing; he called it "a miracle ... a
revolution." But he was trounced everywhere else
yesterday.
Clinton was getting 68 percent of the vote in
Alabama, 59 percent in New Jersey, 61 percent in
Ohio, 52 percent in New Mexico, 47 percent in Mon
tana and 48 percent in California. Brown's best
showing was 20 percent in New Jersey, and in
Alabama, Montana and New Mexico he polled
behind uncommitted.
Long-gone rival Paul Tsongas, the former Mas
sachusetts senator, chose Tuesday to endorse Clin
ton. But Brown would not.
Faring even worse than Brown was Buchanan,
who spent the night in the state where he peaked —
New Hampshire.
Bush rolled up 83 percent in New Jersey and
Ohio, 75 percent in Alabama, 72 percent in Mon
tana, 67 percent in New Mexico and was pulling 74
percent in California. Like Brown, Buchanan trailed
uncommitted in the three states with that option.

But even as the voters handed Bush and Clinton
more wins, they sent warning signals that the par
ties will study closely as they prepare for their sum
mer conventions and a fall campaign that billionaire
Perot assures will shape up unlike any other.
Without being on one ballot, the independent
Perot showed the potential of assembling a winning
coalition, attracting support from both Democrats
and Republicans who were polled after they voted.
But voters appear confused about Perot too. In Cal
ifornia, the exit interviews suggested he draws more
from Bush than from Clinton; in Ohio it was the
opposite.
And Perot's unfavorable ratings shot up from
past surveys, particularly among Democratic voters,
a sign that scrutiny may be taking a toll.
California lacked decisiveness as a primary event
— Clinton and Bush pulled to insurmountable leads
in delegate totals weeks ago — but it was a harbinger
of the fall campaign.
"I am tired of seeing the people who work hard
and play by the rules get the shaft," Clinton said.
"We want to put the forces of the status quo and
short-term greed on notice: The party's over. We're
in for a change. We want our country back."
Clinton entered the night needing just 86 dele
gates to clinch the nomination and was leading for
458, which would push his total to 2,517 — well
above the 2,145 needed to fashion a majority.
Bush issued a statement thanking all Americans
who voted — even those who chose another candi
date, and framed the November elections as two big
questions: "Who has the best ideas for America?
Who do you trust to lead this country?"
Perot got into the mix as well,
In a CBS interview, Perot promised if elected to
"move heaven and earth to stop the deficit spend
ing" but didn't say how, and said he would not raise
taxes except as a last resort. But he refused to take
the "Read My Lips: No New Taxes" pledge Bush
made four years ago.
"You can't ever quote me as saying anything that
stupid," Perot said.
