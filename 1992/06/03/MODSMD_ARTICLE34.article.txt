# L.A. riots affect voter decisions
## 
### 
(AP) — The Los Angeles riots affected the
outcome of four ballot choices facing that city's
voters. They approved a police reform initia
tive, opposed by outgoing Chief Daryl Gates,
that will strengthen civilian control over the
department and limit the tenure of future
chiefs.
Superior Court Judge Joyce A. Karlin, going
before voters for the first time since her
appointment last year, led three challengers.
She angered many by granting probation to a
Korean grocer who fatally shot a black teen
ager in a fight that began over a $1.79 bottle of
orange juice.
District Attorney Ira Reiner, whose prose
cution of the four officers in the Rodney King
beating failed to produce a conviction, was like
ly to be forced into a runoff in his bid for re
election.
A "Buy American" initiative designed to
keep jobs in Southern California was heading
for approval. It drew warnings from opponents
that it would chase away investors who might
help riot recover.
