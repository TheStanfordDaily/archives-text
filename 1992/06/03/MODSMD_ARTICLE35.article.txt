# TITLE IX: 20 YEARS LATER
## Twenty years of challenge and change Stanford's women athletes have slowly gained privileges, prestige 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
In 1971, top-ranked Sally Ride quit the
Stanford women's tennis team because the
women's physical education department
focused resources on classes rather than com
petitive programs.
Travel funds for a Southern California
tournament had been eliminated, so Ride and
three other women paid their own expenses.
However, male players were not only encour
aged, but funded to travel to national competi
tions — one of many disparities between
men's and women's sports at the time.
On Feb. 15, 1972, The Daily printed an
article detailing this and other conflicts:

'Women around the country
and at Stanford were not treat
ed equally with regards to ath
letics.'
— Lawrence Crowley

"Last spring, in a dispute over department
priorities, tournament tennis players voiced
their frustrations with tournament schedul
ing," the article read. "Unlike the men, Stan
ford women do not compete against other
Pacific 8 schools on a formal basis.
"Last year's top-seeded female player, Sally
Hide, stated, 'It's not only not good practice,
its bad practice to play against girls who can't
even serve.' Ride and Molly Tyson, her dou
bles partner, are not on the tennis team this
year. They left a team Ride called 'potentially
the best in the nation,' " the article read.
Since the Stanford women's tennis team
has now won six of the last seven national
championships, the days of conflict seem long
past. But two decades ago, women's athletics
at Stanford, as elsewhere, were the poor sis
ters of the better supported men's programs.
In 1971, the five women's varsity sports —
tennis, fencing, field hockey, basketball and
swimming — received $1,600 total to cover
travel expenses. In the same year, men's
swimming coach Jim Gaughran said his squad
spent "$20,000 at least" for travel.
And Title IX of the Education Amendments
of 1972 did not clear an immediate path to sex
equity in athletics. Stanford, like many other
schools, resisted what it viewed as interfer
ence from the federal government.
Then-Stanford President Richard Lyman
criticized the 1974 federal proposal that would
require schools to determine "in which sports
members of each sex would desire to com
pete," and argued that the guidelines would

set "federally mandated ways of arriving at
institutional decisions."
During those years the Committee on Ath
letics, Physical Education and Recreation
(CAPER) addressed the sex-equity issue.
"The major issue we tackled was Title IX,"
said committee chair Lawrence Crowley.
"Women around the country and at Stanford
were not treated equally with regards to ath
letics."
The committee recommended that the
men's and women's athletic departments be
merged to provide more support for women's
programs.
When the departments were combined in
1975, among the changes that resulted were
greater access to practice facilities, better
trained coaches, more office space and limited
expansion of travel budgets for women ath
letes.
"The big difference was the move to the
varsity courts," said Lele Forood, current
women's tennis assistant coach and member
of the 1975 and 1976 squads.
"We got to practice five times a week and
use ball machines," she said. "Before that we
had practice only Tuesday and Thursday, and
it was still a class then."
Stanford first offered athletics scholarships
for women in 1975-76. Nine women received
scholarships that year, while 140 athletic
scholarships were given to men.
Transition years
"Between 1974 and 1978, I played varsity
basketball at Stanford. Those years bridged
the transition from female-controlled to male
controlled women's sports," wrote Mariah
Burton Nelson in her recent book, "Are We
Winning Yet? How Women Are Changing
Sports and Sports Are Changing Women."
"For the first two years, we played in the
'women's' (read: old, tiny) gym," Nelson
wrote. "My teammates and I spent our spare
time in the athletic department, begging the
male athletic director to enforce Title IX.
"In my junior year, we finally received uni
forms, a more experienced coach, and playing
time in the men's gym. In 1978, my senior
year, Stanford offered its first women's bas
ketball scholarship."
These first scholarships were helped along
by the formation of the Cardinal Club, which
was created to bring in money for women's
athletics. Like the men's Buck Club, the
group's main concern was raising funds for
scholarships.
The early '80s marked another transition
period for women's athletics, during which
these programs were brought under the juris
diction of the then all-male NCAA.
In 1981, the NCAA began offering women's
championships. The Association of Intercolle
giate Athletics for Women, which had been the
governing body for women's athletics, didn't
have the funds or the exposure potential of the

NCAA, so many schools participated in the
NCAA title games.
By 1982, most Stanford women's sports
teams competed under the NCAA system.
"In some ways, the AIAW rules (concerning
scholarships) were less restrictive .. . but the
NCAA added prestige," said former women's
tennis coach Anne Gould.
The Buck Club and Cardinal Club were
combined in 1987, furthering the joint-direc
tion of college athletics. "It was more efficient
to combine the two programs," said former
Assoc. Athletic Director Alan Cummings.
"The decade of the '80s was a significant
period in Stanford's commitment to the devel
opment of women's programs and opportuni
ties for women athletes," Cummings said.
"The number of both women's and men's
teams expanded and that extended through
the whole program — recruiting and coach
ing."
Paying the price
However, expansion had its costs. By 1984,
the Athletic Department had amassed a debt
of $1.7 million and it continues to fight budget
deficits.
"We've been overspending for years and its
got to stop," said men's tennis head coach
Dick Gould. "The mentality was spend to
build attractive programs and then we'd make
more money. But the revenue never caught up
to the expenditure."

The department is currently trying to cut
$700,000 from its operating budget, and sex
equity has been a major factor in determining
where cuts should be made.
Two years ago, the department initiated an
internal review that included a sex-equity self
study.
Sharon Parker, director of the Multicultur
al Development Office, headed the committee
and was joined by Assoc. Athletic Director
Cheryl Levick, Senior University Counsel Lee
Thompson and Jerry Porras, Stanford's facul
ty representative to the NCAA.
"What we were doing was generating infor
mation in creating targets for improvement,"
Porras said. So far, three scholarships have
been given to women's soccer and other
adjustments will be made in operating and
recruiting budgets.
