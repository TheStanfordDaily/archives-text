# TITLE IX: 20 YEARS LATER
## Gender Breakdown in Sports 
### 
"We've got to work within budget
constraints."
But Lopiano believes this argu
ment — that a department must
move slowly because it can't
afford to make sex equity adjust
ments — is a bogus one.
"If you replace gender equity by
race discrimination, would that
argument still hold?" Lopiano
said. "It's against the law. I don't
know why people think its any dif
ferent. [Financially] you've got to
figure out a way."
Ineffective enforcement
Although Stanford's record on
women's athletics does not meet
federal guidelines, administrators
probably do not need to fear a
crackdown by the Office of Civil
Rights, according to Sharon Park
er, the director of Stanford's
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment and chair of the sex-equity
self-study committee.
The office is unlikely to address
minor discrepancies, Parker said,
so people do not usually turn to it
for enforcement of Title IX. Some
say the office is too understaffed
to adequately follow up on com
plaints, while others say inertia
prevents them from taking action.
"It's partly lack of political will
and lack of resources," Bryant
said.
And it has not been the NCAA's
position to impose sex-equity
standards on collegiate athletics,
Leland said. However, NCAA
Executive Director Dick Schultz
recently named a task force to

study what actions the NCAA should take.
Lopiano, who was named to the committee last
month, said the NCAA should help schools adjust
programs to provide equitable opportunities for
women. "The NCAA's role is to assist its members in
complying with Title IX. Institutions can't do it uni
laterally," she said.
Individual conferences have also started address
ing sex-equity issues. The Big 10 Conference recent
ly approved a proposal that would require all league
members to have a 60-40 male-to-female participa
tion rate in five years.
Also, the Pacific 10 Conference, of which Stanford
is a member, recently named a sub-committee to
address sex-equity issues. Levick is a member of this
committee, which held its first meeting — by phone
— last week.
NCAA-imposed changes
The budget ramifications of Title IX compliance
and other sex-equity issues have prompted heated
debate within the NCAA.
At the 1991 NCAA Convention, member schools
voted to cut scholarships by 10 percent in a signifi
cant number of men's and women's sports by 1993.
But at this year's meeting, the decision to elimi
nate women's scholarships was reversed due to equi
ty considerations. "They came back and said, 'Given

what the world is, we can't do that. If you make us
cut women's scholarships at all, we're going to have
trouble complying with Title IX,' " Leland said.
The suspension of cuts cost Stanford about
$220,000, but Leland said Stanford supported rein
stating the scholarships.
However, the scholarships will still be cut in
men's sports, a move vigorously contested by Stan
ford men's tennis coach Dick Gould.
"There's the overall picture but then there's the
sport-by-sport picture," Gould said. "Men and
women in the same sport should get the same num
ber of scholarships. I think its an insult that men's
tennis doesn't get as many scholarships as the
women do."
However, Title IX aims for overall program equi
ty, and does not require individual sports to have an
equal number of scholarships.
Wielding a 'financial hammer'
Widespread budget cuts and a flurry of recent
lawsuits have brought Title IX and other sex-equity
issues back into the public eye this year.
In efforts to trim budgets, some schools eliminat
ed men's and women's squads, reducing opportuni
ties for female athletes. And many women turned to
the legal system to reinstate their programs.
"They can't cut women's teams when (women

athletes) are not given their fair share," said
Bryant, whose firm handled recent sex-equity law
suits at the University of New Hampshire and
Brown University.
In the ongoing Brown case, nine members of the
university's women's gymnastics team filed a class
action suit against the school after it axed their team
along with women's volleyball, men's golf and men's
crew.
In similar cases at the College of William and
Mary and Oklahoma University, the schools rein
stated women's programs after lawsuits were filed.
And in February, a precedent was set that pro
vides more financial incentive to file lawsuits, and
"gets the attention of athletic directors who would
rather put the issue on the back burner," according
to Assoc. Dean of the Business School Jerry Porras,
who is Stanford's faculty representative to the
NCAA.
In Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools,
the Supreme Court awarded punitive damages to a
woman who charged that her school discriminated
against her by not adequately investigating the sex
ual harassment charge she made against a school
employee.
Although this case did not involve athletic pro
grams, it fell under Title IX's broad anti-discrimina
tion aegis and set a precedent for Title IX suits.
Most federal anti-discrimination laws only pro
vide compensatory damages — which cover such
areas as back pay and attorney's fees — not punitive
damages, which can include additional costs, such as
the economic disparity in living quarters if, for
instance, male athletes live in better residences.

Though most of these cases involve the limiting of
opportunities for women athletes, legal experts
expect universities to see more and more cases in
which scholarship funding is at issue.

are being doled out in an unequal way, she could sue
for the difference," said John Weistart, a Duke law
professor, in the March issue of Sports Illustrated.

"We've got to work within budget
constraints."
But Lopiano believes this argu
ment — that a department must
move slowly because it can't
afford to make sex equity adjust
ments — is a bogus one.
"If you replace gender equity by
race discrimination, would that
argument still hold?" Lopiano
said. "It's against the law. I don't
know why people think its any dif
ferent. [Financially] you've got to
figure out a way."
Ineffective enforcement
Although Stanford's record on
women's athletics does not meet
federal guidelines, administrators
probably do not need to fear a
crackdown by the Office of Civil
Rights, according to Sharon Park
er, the director of Stanford's
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment and chair of the sex-equity
self-study committee.
The office is unlikely to address
minor discrepancies, Parker said,
so people do not usually turn to it
for enforcement of Title IX. Some
say the office is too understaffed
to adequately follow up on com
plaints, while others say inertia
prevents them from taking action.
"It's partly lack of political will
and lack of resources," Bryant
said.
And it has not been the NCAA's
position to impose sex-equity
standards on collegiate athletics,
Leland said. However, NCAA
Executive Director Dick Schultz
recently named a task force to

study what actions the NCAA should take.
Lopiano, who was named to the committee last
month, said the NCAA should help schools adjust
programs to provide equitable opportunities for
women. "The NCAA's role is to assist its members in
complying with Title IX. Institutions can't do it uni
laterally," she said.
Individual conferences have also started address
ing sex-equity issues. The Big 10 Conference recent
ly approved a proposal that would require all league
members to have a 60-40 male-to-female participa
tion rate in five years.
Also, the Pacific 10 Conference, of which Stanford
is a member, recently named a sub-committee to
address sex-equity issues. Levick is a member of this
committee, which held its first meeting — by phone
— last week.
NCAA-imposed changes
The budget ramifications of Title IX compliance
and other sex-equity issues have prompted heated
debate within the NCAA.
At the 1991 NCAA Convention, member schools
voted to cut scholarships by 10 percent in a signifi
cant number of men's and women's sports by 1993.
But at this year's meeting, the decision to elimi
nate women's scholarships was reversed due to equi
ty considerations. "They came back and said, 'Given

what the world is, we can't do that. If you make us
cut women's scholarships at all, we're going to have
trouble complying with Title IX,' " Leland said.
The suspension of cuts cost Stanford about
$220,000, but Leland said Stanford supported rein
stating the scholarships.
However, the scholarships will still be cut in
men's sports, a move vigorously contested by Stan
ford men's tennis coach Dick Gould.
"There's the overall picture but then there's the
sport-by-sport picture," Gould said. "Men and
women in the same sport should get the same num
ber of scholarships. I think its an insult that men's
tennis doesn't get as many scholarships as the
women do."
However, Title IX aims for overall program equi
ty, and does not require individual sports to have an
equal number of scholarships.
Wielding a 'financial hammer'
Widespread budget cuts and a flurry of recent
lawsuits have brought Title IX and other sex-equity
issues back into the public eye this year.
In efforts to trim budgets, some schools eliminat
ed men's and women's squads, reducing opportuni
ties for female athletes. And many women turned to
the legal system to reinstate their programs.

Bryant, whose firm handled recent sex-equity law
suits at the University of New Hampshire and
Brown University.
In the ongoing Brown case, nine members of the
university's women's gymnastics team filed a class
action suit against the school after it axed their team
along with women's volleyball, men's golf and men's
crew.
In similar cases at the College of William and
Mary and Oklahoma University, the schools rein
stated women's programs after lawsuits were filed.
And in February, a precedent was set that pro
vides more financial incentive to file lawsuits, and
"gets the attention of athletic directors who would
rather put the issue on the back burner," according
to Assoc. Dean of the Business School Jerry Porras,
who is Stanford's faculty representative to the
NCAA.
In Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools,
the Supreme Court awarded punitive damages to a
woman who charged that her school discriminated
against her by not adequately investigating the sex
ual harassment charge she made against a school
employee.
Although this case did not involve athletic pro
grams, it fell under Title IX's broad anti-discrimina
tion aegis and set a precedent for Title IX suits.
Most federal anti-discrimination laws only pro
vide compensatory damages — which cover such
areas as back pay and attorney's fees — not punitive
damages, which can include additional costs, such as
the economic disparity in living quarters if, for
instance, male athletes live in better residences.

before," Lopiano said. "The time is ripe and people
