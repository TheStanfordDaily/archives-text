# 'A raw deal': Soccer, tennis players provide sex-equity case studies
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Afler a sensational season in
which she garnered fresh
man All-American honors,
Kristen Wair was hoping to help
the women's soccer team advance
to the Final Four next year.
But without a scholarship, Wair
lacked the financial resources to
remain at Stanford and is transfer
ing to the University of Portland.
"I don't want to leave," Wair
said. "I love it here, but my par
ents don't have the money. We've
tried to scrounge, but it's hard to

come up with $23,000."
Wair applied to Stanford last
year knowing coach Berhane
Andeberhan had no scholarships
to offer her.
"I was offered full-rides from a
number of schools, but Stanford
was my first choice," Wair said.
"I've played soccer since I was five
or six. You put in all that work
and then you realize that the
place you want to go doesn't give
scholarships. It's a heartbreaker."
But there was reason for opti
mism.
According to Wair, the Athletic
Department told Andeberhan

that women's soccer was high on
the list of sports that may receive
scholarship money. Wair said this
possibility led her to believe that
she may receive financial assis
tance by sophomore year.
A few weeks ago, the Athletic
Department decided to give
women's soccer three scholar
ships next year. But even if Ande
berhan could peg a scholarship for
Wair, it wouldn't help her now.
"I had to make the decision
whether to transfer in January,"
she said. "I couldn't wait. If I had,
and didn't get a scholarship, then
I'd be left with nowhere to go to
school."
Although pleased for the
squad, she realizes that she would
have been a top candidate for the
scholarship had it been offered a
year earlier.
"I think, 'Wow, I was this
close,' " Wair said. "Like I said, if
there was anything I could have
done to stay here, I would have.
It's still hard to swallow."
Before the Athletic Depart
ment's decision to support women's
soccer scholarships, Wair said she
views Andeberhan's long-time lack
of scholarships as a sign of non-sup
port from the department.
"Berhane has turned the pro
gram around, getting recruits at
the national level," she said before
the scholarships were awarded.
"It bothers me that the (depart
ment) won't,pay him back."
In 1990, the squad made the
12-team NCAA tournament for
the first time. Last fall, the Cardi
nal barely missed the Final Four.
Before he was given scholar
ships, Andeberhan noted the diffi
culty in attracting top players
when he couldn't offer them any
financial support. "We've lost a
lot of them for that reason," he
said. "A lot of them want to go but
don't even pursue Stanford"
because there are no scholarships.
While Wair believes women's
soccer should get more scholar
ships, she recognizes the complex
ity of the sex-equity issue. She
believes men and women in the
same sport should get the same
amount of financial assistance,
and that scholarships should be
taken from football and applied to
other programs.
"Look at the football team,"
she said. "It has 95 scholarships.
What if some of those were split
up among other teams?
"Scholarships should be used on

someone who's actually playing,"
Wair continued. "Look at Julie
Foudy. She's one of the best soccer
players in the country ... She's
working just as hard as the football
players standing on the sidelines."
Foudy will be a senior next
year and will receive a scholarship
for the first time.
Wair can't benefit from any
future women's soccer scholar
ships, but she hopes her depar
ture was instrumental in the
team's acquisition. "I came to
realize that maybe this happened
for a reason. Since I'm leaving,
people might realize this hurts
the team."
While the squad suffers from
the loss of Wair, the reverse is also
true. In a few months, she'll be
wearing the purple-and-white of
the Pilots, wondering if she'll play
a role in ending the Cardinal's
season.
"This is my team," Wair said.
"It's difficult to play somewhere
else when my allegiance is here."
At the beginning of his sopho
more year, tennis player
Mike Flanagan was given a
full-ride scholarship. But to com
ply with the lowered NCAA schol
arship limit, Coach Dick Gould
recently decided to cut it in half.
In an NCAA-mandated move,
the maximum number of men's
tennis scholarships is being lowered
from five to four-and-a-half. The
NCAA voted to keep the women's
limit at eight to help schools comply
with sex-equity laws.
"I think it's a raw deal," Flana
gan said. "When (coach Gould)
told me it might have to be cut, it
was a real shock. I've had a pretty
solid year and then to only get a
half-scholarship next year seems
really unfair."
Gould agreed that the rulings
did not seem equitable. "It's real
ly tough when he can look at
someone who's not even starting
on the women's team and she's
getting $22,000," he said.
Flanagan said he was offered
full-rides at nearly every other
school to which he applied.
"I came here knowing that,
hopefully, I would work my way
into a scholarship," he said. "Now
its impossible to get more than
half for the next two years."
Flanagan believes women's
and men's teams in same sport
should receive the same number
of scholarships.

"We practice the same hours,
have the same schedule," he said.
However, Flanagan realizes that
women get more scholarships to
offset the number that go to foot
ball — the main skewing factor in
scholarships and overall budgets.
"I know that with television
revenue, football makes more
money," he said. "But it's ridicu
lous that football gets so many.
"If you're limited to 300 total
scholarships or so, cut 10 or 20

from football and add to field
hockey or other female sports
that don't have male equivalents.
"It seems a shame that I, a ten
nis player, have to bear the
brunt," said Flanagan, who added
that he would like to see scholar
ships based on an athlete's
amount of playing time.
"It's ridiculous if a third-string
tight end gets a scholarship when
I'm playing a sport all season," he
said.

Wearing a Stanford soccer uniform for the last time, Kristen Wair
gazes intently at Maloney Field. The freshman from Oregon is tran
fering to the University of Portland because without a scholarship
she can no longer afford to attend Stanford.

Sophomore Mike Flanagan, who played No. 2 for men's tennis this
season, will have his scholarship cut in half next year as part of an
NCAA-mandated scholarship reduction in several men's programs.
