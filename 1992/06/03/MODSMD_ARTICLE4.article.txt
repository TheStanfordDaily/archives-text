# Bio experiment used unscreened blood until May
## Wasn't tested for HIV, hepatitis 
### John Ford Staff writer 
Course assistants and students in Biology 44Y
unwittingly used unscreened blood in an ongoing
class experiment, violating a Biology Department
agreement to purchase screened blood from local
blood banks.
According to Biology Department chair Bob
Simone, students in Biology 44Y used the
unscreened blood of course assistant David Digre
goro in one of their immunology labs for at least
six weeks this quarter.
The biology department began using blood
screened for the HIV virus and hepatitis three
class days after the violation was discovered by a
course assistant May 4.
"It was a case of extremely poor judgement,"
Simone said. Digregoro could not be reached for
comment yesterday.
About 250 students came in contact with the
unscreened blood, according to course assistant
Brandon Lattin. The lab required the students to
perform the Elisa and Western Blot HIV tests on
the blood.
According to Simone, the blood has since been
examined and all tests on it have been negative.
Although he had earlier said the negative tests
represented "the end of it," Simone said yesterday
he plans to draft a letter to the students in the
class telling them what happened. "Nobody's try
ing to dismiss this as a trivial event,"he said.
