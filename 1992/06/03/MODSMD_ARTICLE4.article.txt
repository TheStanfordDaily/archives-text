# Bio experiment used unscreened blood until May
## Wasn't tested for HIV, hepatitis 
### John Ford Staff writer 
Course assistants and students in Biology 44Y
unwittingly used unscreened blood in an ongoing
class experiment, violating a Biology Department
agreement to purchase screened blood from local
blood banks.
According to Biology Department chair Bob
Simone, students in Biology 44Y used the
unscreened blood of course assistant David Digre
goro in one of their immunology labs for at least
six weeks this quarter.
The biology department began using blood
screened for the HIV virus and hepatitis three
class days after the violation was discovered by a
course assistant May 4.
"It was a case of extremely poor judgement,"
Simone said. Digregoro could not be reached for
comment yesterday.
About 250 students came in contact with the
unscreened blood, according to course assistant
Brandon Lattin. The lab required the students to
perform the Elisa and Western Blot HIV tests on
the blood.
According to Simone, the blood has since been
examined and all tests on it have been negative.
Although he had earlier said the negative tests
represented "the end of it," Simone said yesterday
he plans to draft a letter to the students in the
class telling them what happened. "Nobody's try
ing to dismiss this as a trivial event,"he said.
Gary Morrow, a member of the Administrative
Panel on Biosafety, said he found
out about the matter yesterday
and has requested a report from
Yelton — the Biology lecturer
who supervises the class — to be
turned in by today. The panel,
Morrow said, "could halt [Biology
44Y] from doing any other work
with human blood" if the report
indicates severe negligence.
Before spring quarter began,
Simone and Yelton had requested
approval to use screened blood
samples in Biology 44Y.
They submitted their request
to the Administrative Panel on
Biosafety, which reviews propos
als from faculty to use infectious
agents in their research or in
classes.
The request from Simone and
Yelton states, "Experimental
serum (not whole blood), which

has been depleted of certain pro
teins, will be purchased from
Sigma." Sigma is a St. Louis
based blood supplier.
The request also says that
"normal control serum will be
purchased from the Stanford
Medical School Blood Center."
But according to Simone and
other biology department person
nel, the department did not pur
chase blood from Sigma or the
Stanford Medical School. Digre
goro's blood, which had not been
screened, was being used instead.
Yelton said Digregoro's blood
had been used the previous sum
mer, when she and two students
were developing the lab. Yelton
said she and the students thought
"that blood from people we know
is safer" than blood from a blood
bank.
Yelton said there was "a point
where I had thought the technical
people had replaced [Digregoro's
blood | with screened blood."
But according to Nancy

Vanzwal, a biology department
technician, Yelton never told the
technicians to order screened
blood. "[Yelton] said to use the
blood provided by the people who
developed the lab," Vanzwal said.
The lab was developed by Yel
ton, Digregoro and senior Victor
Velculescu.
Simone said it was "not pre
cisely clear" who made the deci
sion not to get the blood from the
blood bank.
Course assistants were provid
ed with the unscreened blood
until May 8, according to Vanzw
al. "There wasn't real strong con
trol over what was going on," she
said.
Stanford probably could not be
sued by students in the class
unless physical or mental damage
could be proven, according to Eric
Kirk, a paralegal for Robert Craw
ford, J.D., who specializes in
biomedicine. Mental damage
could include emotional stress, he
said.

Dr. Stanley Schrier, a hemotol
ogist at Stanford Hospital, said
using unscreened blood in a lab is
"not really dangerous" if gloves
are worn and proper safety pre
cautions are followed.

The department did not purchase blood
from Sigma or the Stanford Medical
School. Digregoro's blood, which had not
been screened, was being used instead.
Yelton said she and the students thought
'that blood from people we know is
safer' than blood from a blood bank.

The approval form for the use
of the blood states that the lab
must be conducted under the
guidelines for a "biosafety level
two" human pathogen. On the
standardized four-point scale,

safety guidelines are most strin
gent for a biosafety level four
ranking and less so for level one.
Of seven course assistants in
the immunology lab of Biology
44Y contacted yesterday, none

could identify "biosafety level
two" or any specific safety guide
lines they were asked to follow.
There are 16 course assistants in
the immunology lab.
"No instructions were given to

us," said Gregg Kasten, who was a
course assistant in the immunolo
gy lab.
Huidy Shu, one of the course
assistants, said they were not told
to use gloves during the lab.
Morrow said approval was
given to the project with the
understanding that Yelton would
provide safety regulation instruc
tion to the students in her class.
When Simone and Yelton
requested approval to use the
screened blood samples, they both
signed a "principal investigators
statement of agreement" stating
that "all research personnel are
familiar with and understand the
potential biohazards, proposed
precautions, and appropriate
emergency procedures, and that
the practices and techniques
required to ensure safety will be
followed.
"I agree to accept responsibility
for training of all laboratory work
ers involved in the project," read
the statement, dated March 12.
