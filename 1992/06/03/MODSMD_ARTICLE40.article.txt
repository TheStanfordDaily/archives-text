## Track prepares for NCAA meet 
### Nick Clemens Staff writer 
The Stanford track and field
team will make their last run
at NCAA competition on June
3 at Texas-Austin, at the
NCAA Championships.
Four members of the team
have qualified for the competi
tion â€” seniors Chryste Gaines,
Jackie Edwards, and Dave Scu
damore, and sophomore Dave
Popejoy.
For Gaines, the event will be
a homecoming. A native Texan,
she broke the state record in
the 200-meter dash her senior
year in high school at the same
stadium she will be running in
at NCAAs.
She wrapped up her third
straight Pacific 10 Conference
title this year in the 100-meter
dash, won the NCAA Indoor
55-meter dash title in mid-
March, and right now has the
second-fastest 100-meter time
in the world at 10.90 seconds.
As for possibly winning two
national titles, Gaines said,
"It's realistic in my mind."
Jackie Edwards, who took
second last year in the NCAA
Championships and won the
NCAA Indoor title this year in
the long jump, will also be com
peting in the triple jump.
Popejoy has been somewhat
of a phenomenon this year. A
hammer thrower, he placed

seventh in the Pac-10 Champi
onships last year. His improve
ment this year, though, has
been remarkable.
He automatically qualified
for NCAA Championships very
early in the season and, after
hitting a mid-season slump, he
won the Pac-10 Championships
with a throw of 216 feet, which
qualifies him for the Olympic
Trials. He currently is ranked
third in the country, just
behind his best friend from
high school Kevin MacMahon,
who attends Georgetown.
Dave Scudamore qualified
for the NCAA Championships
at the Penn Relays in May in
the 10,000-meters. Although
his time was provisionally qual
ifying and not automatic, his
national ranking is within the
top 16, which is what he needs
to be in Austin. A redshirt
freshman, Scudamore will be
returning to Stanford as a fifth
year senior next year and will
finish out his college eligibility.
Stanford head coach Brooks
Johnson, who will be stepping
down as the Cardinal's head
coach to coach next year at UC-
San Luis Obispo, said that he
always enjoys this part of the
season.
"Basically at this point
you're trying to address one or
two points you want to refine,"
he said. "You get a lot of time
for coaching."
