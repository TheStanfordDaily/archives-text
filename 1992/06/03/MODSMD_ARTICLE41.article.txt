## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
In a tournament of bests all
around, the Stanford women's
golf team had its own best, the
best finish ever for a Cardinal
squad in the NCAA Champi
onships. The Cardinal ended up
the season with a fourth place fin
ish against one' of the toughest
fields ever.
"This is the most solid I've
ever seen a Stanford team play,"
said coach Tim Baldwin. "They
didn't miss any shots, nothing
flukey, just solid golf. In a normal
year, our score would've been
good enough to win it."
San Jose State took the honors
in the tourney, after scoring the
lowest NCAA Championship team
total in the competition's history.
Arizona came in second behind the
record-breaking Spartans.
Stanford went into the final
round of tournament play Satur
day in third place, but was edged
out on the final day by Georgia,
who rode the tide of its number
one player, Vicki Goetz's play.
Goetz shot a 65 last round, the
best round ever in a NCAA cham
pionship, which combine with the
results of the first three days to
give her the lowest total score
ever in NCAAs — a 280.
Audrey Wooding turned on the
heat in her last collegiate perfor
mance, coming in third individu
ally, shooting 69-74-73-73. Wood
ing's individual placing was the
highest finish for a Stanford
golfer in the NCAAs since Cardi
nal Shelly Hamlin won the tour
nament in 1971.
Wooding and teammate Adele

Moore were both named to the
Ail-American second team, in
which individual performance in
the NCAA Championship tourna
ment was not counted.
The biggest surprise for Stan
ford had to be in the performance
of freshman Amy Lawrence, who
stayed consistently in the top-20
all tournament, eventually wind
ing up in 13th place overall.
Lawrence shot 71-75-74-75, after
coming in the competition ranked
118 th in the nation.
Martha Richards beat her pre
tournament ranking as well, com
ing in 40th, shooting 74-76-74-80
to end the year. Senior Adele
Moore finished 43rd, shooting 80-
74-73-78. Melinda Daniels came
in one slot below her ranking,
ending up in 63rd place shooting
80-81-76-74.
The highlight of the tourna
ment for the Cardinal squad as a
whole was the third round of the
competition, when Stanford's
highest individual score of the day
was a 76. Stanford's 294 total for
the day put them in third place,
keeping them in the top-three
among the highly competitive field.
"The girls (on the third day), it
was the finest I have ever seen, in
my 13 years at Stanford, our team
play," Baldwin said. "They're play
ing beautiful golf. It's a tribute to
them to be at this lofty spot with
all these great teams. Our girls are
something to be proud of."
This is the last tournament for
the Cardinal until next fall. Four
of the Stanford team's players
will be returning next year, as
well as two recruits with impres
sive records, according to coach
Baldwin.
