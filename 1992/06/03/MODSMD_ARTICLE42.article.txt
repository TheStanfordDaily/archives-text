# Linksters head into championships with upset hopes
## 
### Andy Eiser Staff writer 
They've gone as far as they can go.
For the Stanford Cardinal men's golf
team, which begins play today at the
NCAA Championship meet in Albu
querque, N.M., there is no tomorrow:
this is not a qualifier for future tourna
ments, there will be no more time to
enjoy the services of standout senior
Christian Cevaer, and there is nothing
left on the 1991-92 schedule.

Yet despite the air of finality sur
rounding the tournament, the verdict is
still out on this Stanford squad. Indeed,
what transpires on the links at New Mex
ico's University Golf Club over the course
of the next four days will ultimately
determine how this surprising squad will
be judged.
Even though Stanford ran away with
the Pacific 10 Conference Championship
last month and placed seventh at the West
ern Regional — the tournament's toughest
qualifier — two weeks ago, the Cardinal

does not bear the load of high expectations
as it takes on the nation's best in what
amounts to a 72-hole shootout.
However, head coach Wally Goodwin
points to his team's seeding, as well as its
late-season surge, and sees the Cardinal
staying in the hunt until play is complete
Saturday.
"The fact that we have gone from
unranked to 13th over the last six weeks
shows me that the people who do the rank
ings know who we are," Goodwin said.
If Stanford harbors any thoughts of

pulling off an upset, though, it must over
come any jitters it has and show up hot
today and tomorrow. This is the result of
modified tournament rules, whereby the
NCAA now pares the 30-team field in half
after 36 holes, leaving only 15 squads to
duke it out at the end of the competition.
Goodwin has emphasized team play all
year, and his squad is fortunate that of its
starting five — Cevaer, junior Brad Lan
ning, sophomores Notah Begay and Casey
Martin, and freshman Steve Burdick —
only four scores will count each day.

"This is the most cohesive team I've
had here at Stanford," Goodwin said.
"It's nice to know that if one guy is hav
ing an ofT day, the other guys will play
well and make up for it."
Can the Cardinal "tag team" overtake
the likes of Arizona and Arizona State,
the top two teams in the nation, and
homestanding New Mexico to earn an
improbable sixth national championship
for Stanford this year?
They will have to, because there's no
place else for them to go.
