Stanford wins record five
NCAA titles

May 20, 1992
Everyone knew that Stanford's athletics were
good, but not too many people dreamed that the pro
gram was this good.
When Alex O'Brien won his match against Notre
Dame's Matt DiLucia and gave the Stanford men's
tennis team the national championship, the Cardi
nal took its fifth NCAA title of the year — its fifth in
66 days, in fact — to tie UCLA for the record of most
championships in one year.
The tennis title was one of the most surprising
since few people gave Stanford much of a chance
after UCIA routed the Cardinal 6-0 in Los Angeles
just a month before. They said the squad was too
young and didn't have what it took to win the cham
pionship.
But the Stanford men proved the critics wrong as
it ran through brackets, beating Duke, LSU, and the
mighty Bruins to get to the finals against the Fight
ing Irish. The Cardinal then swept Notre Dame 5-0
to give the school title No. 5.
The women's basketball team was another big
surprise this year. After losing in the Final Four last
year to eventual champion Tennessee and losing
three starters, the women were supposed to have a
rebuilding year. The squad had no starting seniors
and an untried substitute for the point guard.
Led by Molly Goodenbour, Stanford breezed
through most of the year and the tournament until
the squad met archnemesis No. 1 Virginia, whom
the Cardinal defeated in the 1990 Final Four. Stan
ford pulled out a thrilling 66-65 victory and
advanced to the final match against the Lady Hill
Toppers from Western Kentucky.
The Cardinal's conditioning proved too much as
the women wore the Hill Toppers down and won the
title 78-62.
Another team basking in victory was the men's
gymnastics team. After dropping its first dual match
to BYU, the squad overwhelmed everyone else on
the schedule. The team, led by Olympic hopefuls
Tim Ryan and Jair Lynch, entered into the NCAA
regionals as one of the favorites to win the title.
Nebraska, however, edged the Cardinal out in the
regional and came to the nationals (held at their
home arena in Lincoln) as the No. 1 seed.
The Cardinal was definitely top dog at the champi
onship, however, as Lynch set an unofficial collegiate
gymnastics record by tallying a 59.025 composite
score. Stanford set a team record for scoring as well as
it outperformed the Cornhuskers in every event.

more than outperform their opponents when they
