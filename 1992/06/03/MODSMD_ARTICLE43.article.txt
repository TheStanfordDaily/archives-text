# TOP TEN STORIES OF THE YEAR

Stanford wins record five
NCAA titles

May 20, 1992
Everyone knew that Stanford's athletics were
good, but not too many people dreamed that the pro
gram was this good.
When Alex O'Brien won his match against Notre
Dame's Matt DiLucia and gave the Stanford men's
tennis team the national championship, the Cardi
nal took its fifth NCAA title of the year — its fifth in
66 days, in fact — to tie UCLA for the record of most
championships in one year.
The tennis title was one of the most surprising
since few people gave Stanford much of a chance
after UCIA routed the Cardinal 6-0 in Los Angeles
just a month before. They said the squad was too
young and didn't have what it took to win the cham
pionship.
But the Stanford men proved the critics wrong as
it ran through brackets, beating Duke, LSU, and the
mighty Bruins to get to the finals against the Fight
ing Irish. The Cardinal then swept Notre Dame 5-0
to give the school title No. 5.
The women's basketball team was another big
surprise this year. After losing in the Final Four last
year to eventual champion Tennessee and losing
three starters, the women were supposed to have a
rebuilding year. The squad had no starting seniors
and an untried substitute for the point guard.
Led by Molly Goodenbour, Stanford breezed
through most of the year and the tournament until
the squad met archnemesis No. 1 Virginia, whom
the Cardinal defeated in the 1990 Final Four. Stan
ford pulled out a thrilling 66-65 victory and
advanced to the final match against the Lady Hill
Toppers from Western Kentucky.
The Cardinal's conditioning proved too much as
the women wore the Hill Toppers down and won the
title 78-62.
Another team basking in victory was the men's
gymnastics team. After dropping its first dual match
to BYU, the squad overwhelmed everyone else on
the schedule. The team, led by Olympic hopefuls
Tim Ryan and Jair Lynch, entered into the NCAA
regionals as one of the favorites to win the title.
Nebraska, however, edged the Cardinal out in the
regional and came to the nationals (held at their
home arena in Lincoln) as the No. 1 seed.
The Cardinal was definitely top dog at the champi
onship, however, as Lynch set an unofficial collegiate
gymnastics record by tallying a 59.025 composite
score. Stanford set a team record for scoring as well as
it outperformed the Cornhuskers in every event.
The men's and women's swimming teams did
more than outperform their opponents when they

brought in the school's first two
titles over Spring Break. Both
squads overwhelmed rival Texas —
the men set a record for the highest
point total ever at the NCAA
Championships and the women
recorded six American records.
The Stanford men romped
over the Longhorns, leading the
championships from wire to wire
and no one even came close. The
Cardinal eventually won by the
unbelievable score of 632-356.

by the Minnesota Vikings Jan. 10,
who would have thought Stanford
would be naming Bill Walsh as the

University's new head football
coach just a week later?
Walsh, who led the San Fran
cisco 49ers to three Super Bowl
rings in 10 years, returned to the
school that he led to bowl appear
ances in 1977 and 1978.
In passing up more lucrative
opportunities to either return to the
49ers in a front office position or
remain a football analyst at NBC,
Walsh said he wanted to go back to
working with young players.
"I decided that I might be of
more value teaching someplace,"
said Walsh at his first press confer
ence as Stanford's new head coach.
"This is right. Being an educator
does have redeeming value."
It is unlikely that the team will
need to make many adjustments to
the new head coach. Green was a
protege of Walsh and installed a
system similar to the one designed
by Walsh during his years with the
49ers.
The chance to work under
Walsh has also generated excite
ment among the players.
"This is an opportunity of a

lifetime," said starting quarter
back Steve Stenstrom. "It will be
amazing to work under him and
absorb what he can teach."
The Athletic Department has
already begun a marketing cam
paign hyping Walsh's return, hop
ing that the return of a Bay Area
coaching legend to The Farm will
translate into higher ticket sales.

100-meter freestyle mark. Her
time of 54.48 seconds was a full

old record of 54.73, set in 1986.
After "a two-hour nap and a
good lunch", she came in first in
the finals to add to her day by
making the 1992 Olympic team.
Thompson's previous best time
was 55.84, so many in the swim
ming community were caught off
guard by the record. But she and
her coach, Richard Quick, had
come into the trials with high
goals.
"She has trained and thought
and performed thinking [that she
could break the record)," Quick
said. "I'm not surprised."

When Alex O'Brien and Chris

Jason Yee and Vimal Patel 7-6, 6-

finals, O'lirien became the first
player since current Cardinal
assistant coach John Whitlinger
in '74 to capture the collegiate
tennis Triple Crown.
"This is a dream come true,
that's for sure," said O'Brien at
the time.
O'Brien, the No. 3 seed in sin
gles competition, cruised into the
finals against Georgia's Wade
McGuire by punishing No. 2 seed
Jose Luis Noriega, 6-0, 6-3.
Playing in front of McGuire's
hometown Athens, Ga., crowd,
O'Brien waltzed to a 6-3, 6-2 win.
"Nothing great," O'Brien said.
Nothing short of historic, say the

5 UCLA upsets
Cardinal
spikers
December 13, 1991
Every team has a down game
every once in a while, but the Stan
ford women's volleyball team's low
point came at the wrong time.
After going 30-1 and being ranked
No. 1 for 13 weeks, the Cardinal
ran into a UCLA steamroller and
lost, 15-2, 15-12, 16-14 in the
finals of the West Regional.
The loss was even more painful
since Stanford had beaten the
Bruins handily two times earlier
in the season.

The loss overshadowed a
tremendous season for the team.
Senior Kristin Klein was named
the Volleyball Monthly 1991 Play
er of the Year, and the team
rewrote the school record books
with a 28-match win streak and
an undefeated Pacific 10 Confer
ence record.

Adams, Sepeda
combine for

February 12, 1992
It was, in many ways, a mean
ingless game. Only 123 fans showed
up on an overcast clay in Stockton
to watch Stanford battle Pacific in
non-conference baseball action.
What they got was a bit of his
tory.
Jamie Sepeda and Willie
Adams combined to stymie Tiger
hitters, 6-0, tossing the first Stan
ford no-hitter in 11 years in the
process.
Sepeda, making his third start
of the young 1992 season, allowed
only one ball to get out of the
infield in his six-inning perfor
mance.
Adams, who was himself com
ing off of two rather unmemorable
starting performances, struck out
the side in the eighth and ninth
innings.

7 Cardinal goes
bowling
December 25, 1991
The Stanford football team
made its first bowl appearance
since 1986 in the Aloha Bowl
against Georgia Tech. The Cardi
nal fell to the Yellow Jackets 18-
17 after Tech completed a two
point conversion with 14 seconds
left in the game.
The Cardinal had to punt from
the Georgia Tech 45 with 1 minute,
41 seconds left, and Willie Clay
faked, juked, and bolted his way to
the Stanford 31-yard line — a 63-
yard return. The Yellow Jackets
had the momentum and marched
in for one last touchdown, setting
up the fateful two-point try.
The loss ended the Cardinal's
seven-game winning streak,
which included a 38-21 romp over
archrival No. 6 California and vic
tories over USC in Los Angeles
and UCLA. Stanford ended the
regular season at No. 17 in both
wire service polls, and returns
many starters for next year.

BSpikers fall
to Waves in
finals |
April 25, 1992
The Stanford men's volleyball
team made a tremendous
turnaround this year, but it came
up one match short, falling in the
NCAA Championship finals to
Pepperdine, 7-15, 13-15, 14-16.
The two teams had split their
two previous games and both
were playing well, but the Waves
jumped all over the Cardinal in
the first game and then held on to
win the last two. Stanford players
remarked that they couldn't get
pumped up for the match at first.
"I had commented to the team
that it didn't feel like the national
championship match," senior
Duncan Blackman said. "I
couldn't feel all the tension that's
supposed to be associated with it."
At the beginning of the season
no one gave Stanford a chance to
make it to the finals. Last year the
Cardinal had an 8-13 overall
record. They came back this year
to compile a 24-4 record.

oTwo players
chosen in
NFL draft
April 26, 1992
In a proud day for Stanford
football, two Cardinal players
were among the top 10 players
chosen in the first round of the
National Football League draft.
In back-to-back selections,
offensive tackle Bob Whitfield was
drafted by the Atlanta Falcons
with the No. 8 selection, and the
Cleveland Browns nabbed full
back "Touchdown" Tommy
Vardell as the No. 9 pick.
One of the finest offensive
tackles in Stanford football histo
ry, Whitfield, a junior from Car
son, Calif., gave up his final year
of college eligibility to enter the
draft early.
"This is one of the greatest
things to happen to me in my life,"
Whitfield said. "There's nothing
else to say — I'm just too happy."
Vardell, a senior back from El
Cajon, Calif., leaves The Farm
having set six school records:
most single-season yards rushing
(1,084), most touchdowns scored
in a season (20), most points in a
season (120), most career rushing
touchdowns (39), and most car
ries in a game (39, vs. Cal on
November 23, 1991).

"I was by myself, and I sat
down and decided what I was
going to do. It was a gut feeling."
With that, swimmer Summer
Sanders confirmed rumors that
had been floating around campus
for weeks. The sophomore gave

up her final two seasons of NCAA
eligibility, qualifying instead to
receive funds underwritten by the
United States Olympic Commit
tee and United States Swimming.
Sanders also became eligible to
pursue the numerous endorse
ment opportunities which are
sure to come her way if she builds
upon her collegiate success at the
1992 Summer Olympics.
Sanders was the main force
behind Stanford's 1991-92
women's swimming title, taking
home the 200- and 400-meter
individual medley crowns, along

with the 200 butterfly title. She
was named NCAA Swimmer of
the Year in each of her two sea
sons at Stanford.
Her departure came one year
after another Cardinal women's
swimming star, Janet Evans,
pulled out of school. Indeed, the
early departure of such high-pro
file collegiate stars may force the
NCAA to alter its eligibility rules,
regulations deemed "archaic" by
Athletic Director Ted Leland at
the press conference announcing
Sanders' decision.

rings in 10 years, returned to the
school that he led to bowl appear
ances in 1977 and 1978.
In passing up more lucrative
opportunities to either return to the
49ers in a front office position or
remain a football analyst at NBC,
Walsh said he wanted to go back to
working with young players.
"I decided that I might be of
more value teaching someplace,"
said Walsh at his first press confer
ence as Stanford's new head coach.
"This is right. Being an educator
does have redeeming value."
It is unlikely that the team will
need to make many adjustments to
the new head coach. Green was a
protege of Walsh and installed a
system similar to the one designed
by Walsh during his years with the
49ers.
The chance to work under
Walsh has also generated excite
ment among the players.
"This is an opportunity of a

lifetime," said starting quarter
back Steve Stenstrom. "It will be
amazing to work under him and
absorb what he can teach."
The Athletic Department has
already begun a marketing cam
paign hyping Walsh's return, hop
ing that the return of a Bay Area
coaching legend to The Farm will
translate into higher ticket sales.

Vardell, a senior back from El

most single-season yards rushing

Stanford wins record five
NCAA titles

May 20, 1992
Everyone knew that Stanford's athletics were
good, but not too many people dreamed that the pro
gram was this good.
When Alex O'Brien won his match against Notre
Dame's Matt DiLucia and gave the Stanford men's
tennis team the national championship, the Cardi
nal took its fifth NCAA title of the year — its fifth in
66 days, in fact — to tie UCLA for the record of most
championships in one year.
The tennis title was one of the most surprising
since few people gave Stanford much of a chance
after UCIA routed the Cardinal 6-0 in Los Angeles
just a month before. They said the squad was too
young and didn't have what it took to win the cham
pionship.
But the Stanford men proved the critics wrong as
it ran through brackets, beating Duke, LSU, and the
mighty Bruins to get to the finals against the Fight
ing Irish. The Cardinal then swept Notre Dame 5-0
to give the school title No. 5.
The women's basketball team was another big
surprise this year. After losing in the Final Four last
year to eventual champion Tennessee and losing
three starters, the women were supposed to have a
rebuilding year. The squad had no starting seniors
and an untried substitute for the point guard.
Led by Molly Goodenbour, Stanford breezed
through most of the year and the tournament until
the squad met archnemesis No. 1 Virginia, whom
the Cardinal defeated in the 1990 Final Four. Stan
ford pulled out a thrilling 66-65 victory and
advanced to the final match against the Lady Hill
Toppers from Western Kentucky.
The Cardinal's conditioning proved too much as
the women wore the Hill Toppers down and won the
title 78-62.
Another team basking in victory was the men's
gymnastics team. After dropping its first dual match
to BYU, the squad overwhelmed everyone else on
the schedule. The team, led by Olympic hopefuls
Tim Ryan and Jair Lynch, entered into the NCAA
regionals as one of the favorites to win the title.
Nebraska, however, edged the Cardinal out in the
regional and came to the nationals (held at their
home arena in Lincoln) as the No. 1 seed.
The Cardinal was definitely top dog at the champi
onship, however, as Lynch set an unofficial collegiate
gymnastics record by tallying a 59.025 composite
score. Stanford set a team record for scoring as well as
it outperformed the Cornhuskers in every event.
The men's and women's swimming teams did
more than outperform their opponents when they

brought in the school's first two
titles over Spring Break. Both
squads overwhelmed rival Texas —
the men set a record for the highest
point total ever at the NCAA
Championships and the women
recorded six American records.
The Stanford men romped
over the Longhorns, leading the
championships from wire to wire
and no one even came close. The
Cardinal eventually won by the
unbelievable score of 632-356.

5 UCLA upsets
Cardinal
spikers
December 13, 1991
Every team has a down game
every once in a while, but the Stan
ford women's volleyball team's low
point came at the wrong time.
After going 30-1 and being ranked
No. 1 for 13 weeks, the Cardinal
ran into a UCLA steamroller and
lost, 15-2, 15-12, 16-14 in the
finals of the West Regional.
The loss was even more painful
since Stanford had beaten the
Bruins handily two times earlier
in the season.

The loss overshadowed a
tremendous season for the team.
Senior Kristin Klein was named
the Volleyball Monthly 1991 Play

rewrote the school record books
with a 28-match win streak and
an undefeated Pacific 10 Confer

February 12, 1992
It was, in many ways, a mean

What they got was a bit of his

Jamie Sepeda and Willie
Adams combined to stymie Tiger
hitters, 6-0, tossing the first Stan
ford no-hitter in 11 years in the
process.
Sepeda, making his third start
of the young 1992 season, allowed
only one ball to get out of the
infield in his six-inning perfor

Adams, who was himself com
ing off of two rather unmemorable
starting performances, struck out
the side in the eighth and ninth

The Stanford football team
made its first bowl appearance

against Georgia Tech. The Cardi

17 after Tech completed a two
point conversion with 14 seconds
left in the game.
The Cardinal had to punt from
the Georgia Tech 45 with 1 minute,
41 seconds left, and Willie Clay
faked, juked, and bolted his way to
the Stanford 31-yard line — a 63-
yard return. The Yellow Jackets
had the momentum and marched
in for one last touchdown, setting
up the fateful two-point try.
The loss ended the Cardinal's
seven-game winning streak,
which included a 38-21 romp over

The Stanford men's volleyball

up one match short, falling in the
NCAA Championship finals to
Pepperdine, 7-15, 13-15, 14-16.
The two teams had split their

win the last two. Stanford players
remarked that they couldn't get
pumped up for the match at first.
"I had commented to the team
that it didn't feel like the national

Duncan Blackman said. "I
couldn't feel all the tension that's
supposed to be associated with it."
At the beginning of the season
no one gave Stanford a chance to

In a proud day for Stanford

In back-to-back selections,
offensive tackle Bob Whitfield was

One of the finest offensive

of college eligibility to enter the

"This is one of the greatest
things to happen to me in my life,"
Whitfield said. "There's nothing
else to say — I'm just too happy."
Vardell, a senior back from El

having set six school records:
most single-season yards rushing
(1,084), most touchdowns scored
in a season (20), most points in a

Stanford wins record five
NCAA titles

May 20, 1992
Everyone knew that Stanford's athletics were
good, but not too many people dreamed that the pro
gram was this good.
When Alex O'Brien won his match against Notre
Dame's Matt DiLucia and gave the Stanford men's
tennis team the national championship, the Cardi
nal took its fifth NCAA title of the year — its fifth in
66 days, in fact — to tie UCLA for the record of most
championships in one year.
The tennis title was one of the most surprising
since few people gave Stanford much of a chance
after UCIA routed the Cardinal 6-0 in Los Angeles
just a month before. They said the squad was too
young and didn't have what it took to win the cham
pionship.
But the Stanford men proved the critics wrong as
it ran through brackets, beating Duke, LSU, and the
mighty Bruins to get to the finals against the Fight
ing Irish. The Cardinal then swept Notre Dame 5-0
to give the school title No. 5.
The women's basketball team was another big
surprise this year. After losing in the Final Four last
year to eventual champion Tennessee and losing
three starters, the women were supposed to have a
rebuilding year. The squad had no starting seniors
and an untried substitute for the point guard.
Led by Molly Goodenbour, Stanford breezed
through most of the year and the tournament until
the squad met archnemesis No. 1 Virginia, whom
the Cardinal defeated in the 1990 Final Four. Stan
ford pulled out a thrilling 66-65 victory and
advanced to the final match against the Lady Hill
Toppers from Western Kentucky.
The Cardinal's conditioning proved too much as
the women wore the Hill Toppers down and won the
title 78-62.
Another team basking in victory was the men's
gymnastics team. After dropping its first dual match
to BYU, the squad overwhelmed everyone else on
the schedule. The team, led by Olympic hopefuls
Tim Ryan and Jair Lynch, entered into the NCAA
regionals as one of the favorites to win the title.
Nebraska, however, edged the Cardinal out in the
regional and came to the nationals (held at their
home arena in Lincoln) as the No. 1 seed.
The Cardinal was definitely top dog at the champi
onship, however, as Lynch set an unofficial collegiate
gymnastics record by tallying a 59.025 composite
score. Stanford set a team record for scoring as well as
it outperformed the Cornhuskers in every event.
The men's and women's swimming teams did
more than outperform their opponents when they

brought in the school's first two
titles over Spring Break. Both
squads overwhelmed rival Texas —
the men set a record for the highest
point total ever at the NCAA
Championships and the women
recorded six American records.
The Stanford men romped
over the Longhorns, leading the
championships from wire to wire
and no one even came close. The
Cardinal eventually won by the
unbelievable score of 632-356.

Walsh, who led the San Fran

school that he led to bowl appear
ances in 1977 and 1978.
In passing up more lucrative
opportunities to either return to the
49ers in a front office position or
remain a football analyst at NBC,
Walsh said he wanted to go back to
working with young players.
"I decided that I might be of
more value teaching someplace,"
said Walsh at his first press confer

"This is right. Being an educator
does have redeeming value."
It is unlikely that the team will
need to make many adjustments to
the new head coach. Green was a
protege of Walsh and installed a
system similar to the one designed
by Walsh during his years with the
49ers.
The chance to work under
Walsh has also generated excite

"This is an opportunity of a

that it didn't feel like the national
championship match," senior
Duncan Blackman said. "I
couldn't feel all the tension that's
supposed to be associated with it."
At the beginning of the season
no one gave Stanford a chance to
make it to the finals. Last year the
Cardinal had an 8-13 overall
record. They came back this year
to compile a 24-4 record.

oTwo players
chosen in
NFL draft
April 26, 1992
In a proud day for Stanford
football, two Cardinal players
were among the top 10 players
chosen in the first round of the
National Football League draft.
In back-to-back selections,
offensive tackle Bob Whitfield was
drafted by the Atlanta Falcons
with the No. 8 selection, and the
Cleveland Browns nabbed full
back "Touchdown" Tommy
Vardell as the No. 9 pick.
One of the finest offensive
tackles in Stanford football histo
ry, Whitfield, a junior from Car
son, Calif., gave up his final year
of college eligibility to enter the
draft early.
"This is one of the greatest
things to happen to me in my life,"
Whitfield said. "There's nothing
else to say — I'm just too happy."
Vardell, a senior back from El
Cajon, Calif., leaves The Farm
having set six school records:
most single-season yards rushing
(1,084), most touchdowns scored
in a season (20), most points in a
season (120), most career rushing
touchdowns (39), and most car
ries in a game (39, vs. Cal on
November 23, 1991).

says
she's leaving (
May 12, 1992
"I was by myself, and I sat
down and decided what I was
going to do. It was a gut feeling."
With that, swimmer Summer
Sanders confirmed rumors that
had been floating around campus
for weeks. The sophomore gave

up her final two seasons of NCAA
eligibility, qualifying instead to
receive funds underwritten by the
United States Olympic Commit
tee and United States Swimming.
Sanders also became eligible to
pursue the numerous endorse
ment opportunities which are
sure to come her way if she builds
upon her collegiate success at the
1992 Summer Olympics.
Sanders was the main force
behind Stanford's 1991-92
women's swimming title, taking
home the 200- and 400-meter
individual medley crowns, along

with the 200 butterfly title. She
was named NCAA Swimmer of
the Year in each of her two sea
sons at Stanford.
Her departure came one year
after another Cardinal women's
swimming star, Janet Evans,
pulled out of school. Indeed, the
early departure of such high-pro
file collegiate stars may force the
NCAA to alter its eligibility rules,
regulations deemed "archaic" by
Athletic Director Ted Leland at
the press conference announcing
Sanders' decision.
