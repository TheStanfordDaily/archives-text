# Several taken in draft
## 
### Mike Langford Staff writer 
Monday, yesterday, and today
were very big days for some Stan
ford student-atheletes. Some will
become very happy. Some will
become very not-so-happy. These
are the days of the Major League
Baseball Draft.
Jeffrey Hammonds was taken
fourth in the draft by the Balti
more Orioles. Despite having the
most talent in the draft, the first
three teams to choose (Houston,
Cleveland, and Montreal, respec
tively) felt that they had little
chance to sign Hammonds.
"I couldn't have asked for a
better situation," said Ham
monds, who has a .353 career
average with 27 homers and 134
RBIs. "There are a few Stanford
guys in the organization. It'll be
good to be with the guys again."
In a surprising move, Rick
Helling was also taken in the first
round. The Texas Rangers took
the right-hander Helling with
pick No. 22. He has not reported
whether or not he will sign, but
odds are he will not be able to say

no to the money offered.
Although official reports
beyond the first round are not
made public until June 9 so that
schools cannot use the results to
aid in recruiting, various sources
say that other Stanford players
have also been taken high in the
draft. As the first pick in the sec
ond round, Brian Sackinsky was
taken by the Orioles, who have
drafted eight Stanford players in
the last seven years. Two big sur
prise picks came when John
Lynch was taken in the second
round by the Florida Marlins, and
Tim Moore was drafted by the
Chicago White Sox in the fifth.
Jamie Sepeda was taken in the
sixth round, as was Steve
Solomon in the seventh, and
Steve Worrell by the Chisox in the
13th. Mark Skeels was also said to
have been picked in this same
general part of the draft.
With many rounds to come,
doubtlessly all of Stanford's
junior and senior players, includ
ing Chris Kemper, Dave Cornell,
Tony Detter, Aaron Dorlarque,
and David Holbrook, will be draft
ed.
