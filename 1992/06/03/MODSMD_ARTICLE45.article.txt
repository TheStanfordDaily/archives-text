## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
While most Stanford students
will spend the next few days wor
rying about finals, the members
of the sailing team have some
thing else to keep them occupied.
The female squad began com
petition Monday in the Women's
Nationals at the College of
Charleston, and the regatta will
come to a close today. Next week,
the coed team will be participat
ing in the Team Race Nationals at
the same location from June 8-10.
The Cardinal has been practic
ing extra hours to prepare.
According to coach Blake Mid
dleton, "We have some talented
former teammates who have been
helping out our training."
Despite their beneficial work
outs, sophomore Scott Sellers
claims that both Stanford squads
may be at a disadvantage com
pared to those teams who have

already completed their exams.
"Although our last few prac
tices have been good, we aren't as
focused as we should be due to the
timing of the Nationals," he said.
Though the women's team will
sail against tough competition
from the Navy, Dartmouth, and
Yale squads, they will send skip
per Haley King and her crew
Kathy Akers to lead Stanford in
the A division of the race. In addi
tion, skipper Stacey Misakian and
crew Molly McClain will repre
sent Stanford in the B division.
In the Team Race Nationals,
the Cardinal will also have their
work cut out for them as they will
be facing top ranked teams from
Navy, UC-Irvine, and Tufts.
Charles Meade and Katherine
Chen will sail in one of the Stan
ford boats and Matt Sanford and
Kristen Sidell will lead another
boat. The third boat will be raced
by Sellers along with Andi Guer
rero.
