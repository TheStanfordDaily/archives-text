# Athletes head to Barcelona for Summer Olympics
## US team like family to Oden 
### George Malone Editorial staff 
When you look down the
alphabetical roster of the 1992
U.S. women's volleyball team,
things could be quite crowded
when you get to the Os.
That's because Stanford star
Bev Oden is trying to join her two
older sisters, Kim and Elaina, on
the Olympic team heading to
Barcelona. Having three mem
bers of the same family on the
team would be an Olympic first,
and it would also make the Unit
ed States one very tough sq\. ad.

The historical significance of
all three sisters playing together
on one team is remarkable, Stan
ford head coach Don Shaw said.
"It's an unbelievable opportu
nity for [three siblings in the
Olympics together] to even be
possible," he said. "As long as I've
been following sports I've never
seen anything like it."
Bev has been training with the

national team since January of this
year, and while she is one of the
youngest players to be invited for
an extended tryout, Shaw feels she
has a chance to make the team.
"She's making it very hard for
the national coaches to decide on
the final roster," he said. "She's
really impressed them. She can
really add a lot to the team with
her blocking."
20 players are currently train
ing with the team in San Diego.
The coaches will select the final 12
players and two alternates during
the third week of June, Shaw said.
The final choice will probably
be between Bev and Deitre Collins,
a player at Hawaii from 1982-'B6.
Collins has much more interna
tional experience than Bev, but
has been hampered by injuries and
cannot train for extensive periods
of time, Shaw said.
Bev has been an integral part of
Stanford's success in women's vol
leyball since her arrival in 1989. In
1990 she was named the NCAA
Player of the Year, and this season
she teamed with Kristin Klein to
lead the Cardinal to a 30-2 record,
tallying a school-record 28 consec
utive wins in the process.
Her oldest sister, Kim, played
at Stanford from 1982-85 and was
the NCAA Player of the Year
twice. She was also named as the
NCAA Player of the Decade for
the 1980's. She holds several
school records and has been one
of the dominating forces of
national and international volley
ball recently.
Elaina went to Pacific from
1985-'B9. She was named NCAA
Player of the Year once during her
career and took Pacific to the
national championship her fresh
man year, defeating sister Kim
and Stanford in a very emotional
final.
