# Hammonds, two others invited to tryouts

### Mike Langford Staff writer 
For three members of the 1992 Stanford baseball
team, the only place to go is up.
Junior centerfielder Jeffrey Hammonds, junior
righthander Rick Helling, and sophomore
righthander Willie Adams were among the 40 players
invited to the Olympic Trials in Millington, Tenn.
The trials go for three days — June 8-10. After the
last day, the team will be narrowed down to 25 play
ers for a game on the June 11. That squad will be
Team USA for the Olympic Games in Barcelona.
"The best college prospects in the nation are going
to be there," Adams said. "[Many] first-rounders
from this year's draft will [be at the trials]. It's the
cream of the crop as far as college baseball goes."
Hammonds was the starting centerfielder and
lead-off hitter for Team USA in the Pan American

Games last summer, and most likely he will resume
that role this summer. The junior out of Scotch
Plains, N.J., was named first team All-American this
past year after hitting .377 with six homeruns and
33 stolen bases.
Helling, who burst onto the college scene this
year, also played for Team USA in the Pan Ams. He
compiled an 8-4 record and a 4.43 ERA with 100
strikeouts as the Cardinal pitching rotation's num
ber two starter for most of the season.
Adams attended the Olympic Trials in Home
stead, Fla., last summer and performed very well.
He also played well for Stanford, pitching to an 8-3
record and 3.91 ERA with 81 strikeouts as the Car
dinal's number one starter for most of the year.
"I was on the Junior National team two years
ago," Adams said, "and it's really a good feeling
when you're out there on the field with your hat off
and they're playing the national anthem.
