# Lynch, Ryan hope to build on NCAA success

### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
Fresh off leading the Cardinal
men's gymnastics program to its
first NCAA team championship,
junior Jair Lynch and senior Tim
Ryan are close to garnering an
equally impressive individual
honor: a spot on the seven-man
1992 Olympic men's gymnastics
team.
Ryan finished third and Lynch
placed seventh at the first stage of
Olympic qualification, the USA
Championships, held May 14-17 in
Columbus, Ohio. That meet pared a
field of 48 down to the 18 who now
comprise the national team. The
scores from the Championships will
make up 30 percent of the total that
officials will use to name the more
select Olympic squad.
The remaining 70 percent will
be taken from the June 13-14
Olympic Trials in Baltimore, Md.
This is the meet for which Lynch

and Ryan have arguably been
training for a lifetime.
The competition for the seven
berths to Barcelona, Ryan says, is
composed of "all of the top NCAA
gymnasts, plus a number who
have recently graduated and are
only training."
Which brings to light a challenge
facing Lynch and Ryan that others
might not face. While most of their
competitors are either out of school
and training full-time or at least
finished with their academic year,
Lynch and Ryan are juggling train
ing and finals on the Farm right up
until the first day of Trials.
The recent weeks of training
have involved a definite shift of
focus for the two Cardinal
Olympic hopefuls. The NCAA
title Lynch and Ryan helped Stan
ford coach Sadao Hamada bring
home April 25 successfully culmi
nated a half year of working
toward a team goal. Now the spot
light is on the individual.

"Winning the NCAA Champi
onship was great because I felt
like I was part of o team effort.
But at the same time, I was only
one-sixth of the whole effort,"
Lynch said.
"It's different now. I know I'm
training and doing the work all by
myself, I'm competing by myself
. . . making the team would be
really rewarding individually."
While they may be surprising
some of the nation's top gymnasts
with their competitive perfor
mances, Lynch and Ryan feel
they're making progress as planned.
"It is only my second year on
the national team, so I think a lot
of people are surprised I'm in the
top seven right now. I think they
expected me to make a strong
showing in 1996, not this year,"
Lynch said.
"Making the 1992 [Olympic]
team is certainly a goal I've been
working toward for a long time.
With all the training I've been

putting in to these meets, I
expected to do this well or better,"
Ryan said.
With a pair of performances
equal to or better than the ones
they put forth at the Champi
onships, Lynch and Ryan will
become the next two to shed the
Cardinal for the Red, White & Blue.
