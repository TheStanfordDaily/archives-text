# Star-studded swimming contingent set to go
## 
### Tish Williams Staff writer 
Stanford will be sending some
of the best swimmers in the
world, not to mention on campus,
to Barcelona this summer. The
six Cardinal students and alumni
could easily bring home several
gold medals.
The Stanford swimmers will
rely on their international experi
ence, the Olympic and the World
Championship, and NCAA com
petitions. The Olympics, however,
is a much more intense event for
the swimmers.
"In the Olympics, there's a lot
more at stake," said Stanford
men's swim coach Skip Kenney.
"It's winner take all, because it's
so hard to stick around for four
more years. It's so much pressure
... it makes final exams at Stan
ford look pretty bland."
Recently leaving Stanford to
train for the Olympics and reap its

benefits, Summer Sanders has the
most obvious shot for one, or sever
al, gold medals. Sanders will swim
the 200- and 400-meter individual
medleys, the 100 and 200 butterfly
and the 400 medley relay.
Sanders could possibly break
the world record in the 200 fly,
which was set by Mary T. Meagher
in 1981.
The wild card of the Olympic
Trials who came through in the
clutch was freshman Jenny
Thompson. Thompson will be
swimming the 50, 100 and 200
freestyle, with the possibility of
being a member of two relay
teams. Thompson surprised the
nation by capturing a world record
in the 50 free on the opening day
of the Trials, which puts her in the
No. 1 spot to win the gold medal in
that event this summer.
Lea Loveless, a transfer from
Florida, will be competing in the 100
and 200 backstroke, with the chance
to make the medley relay team.

Stanford also has another
heavy favorite for a gold medal in
backstroker Jeff Rouse. Rouse
won the 100 back in the Trials, an
event in which he holds the world
record. Rouse set the record last
summer, winning the 100 back at
the Pan-Pacific Games in 53.93
seconds.
Stanford alum Pablo Morales
will be a sentimental favorite in
this summer's Olympics, as a tes
tament to the trend of older swim
mers retaining world-class status
with gold medal potential. Morales
was a big winner in the 1984
Olympics in Los Angeles, but failed
to make the '88 Olympic team.
Morales left competitive swim
ming to go to Cornell Law School,
but decided to stage a comeback
last year. Morales has only been
in training for about a year, and
according to coach Kenney, has
had continuous improvement all
year, including the period after
the Olympic Trials.

Morales won the 100 butterfly
in the Trials, an event in which he
still holds the world record from
his earlier years in swimming.
Morales is considered to be on tar
get for a silver, but if he keeps
improving, he could pull off a
gold-medal performance.
