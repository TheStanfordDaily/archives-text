# Bravin to vie for fencing spot
## 
### Quinn Moo Staff writer 
Errol Flynn never had it this
good, or this bad.
With a stout heart and a strong
sword, Nick Bravin has ascended
to the top of American fencing,
and also to the height of contro
versy. The current U.S. and NCAA
foil champion has eliminated oppo
nent after opponent, but cannot
quell their increasing jealousy and
calumnies.
"Everybody is gunning for
him. One of the reasons you hear
negative opinions about Nick is
that on the strip, he uses street
fight psychology. He's not going
to give you anything for free,"
Stanford men's fencing coach
Zoran Tulum said.
Whether it's a pre-bout stare
down or other psychological threat,
Bravin definitely intimidates peo
ple. His mere presence, the steely
eyes and confident walk, terrorizes
lesser fencers into submission.
"I tell him the strip is a dead
end dark alley. One way. And you
must pass this man in front of
you," Tulum said. But unlike law
less street fighting, fencing is reg
ulated by a complex system of pri
orities. A blundering hothead will

quickly lose.
Sometimes, it can be too much.
"At the NCAAs I was yelling in
the guy's face [after a score]. I'm
not going to joke around when
I'm up there," Bravin said.
Undefeated, Bravin will contend
for one of three spots on the foil
Olympic team at U.S. Nationals
June 7 and 8 in Chicago, Illinois.
But Tulum says there is high parity.
"It's not who's going to do
well, but who's going to screw
up," he said.
Bravin looks inward for moti
vation and guidance when he is
faced with pressure to "get
results." He must stay consistent
to retain his top ranking and earn
a chance to reign in Spain.
"I asked myself, 'can I ever be
world champ? Can I ever be Olympic
champ?' I didn't want to pursue
fencing competitively unless I could
convince myself that I could reach
the next level," Bravin explained.
If he does secure a spot, Bravin
will confront a harrowing fact: a
U.S. fencer has not won the gold
medal since 1904.
"The way things are now the
established guys have hold on the
medals. The top Germans, French
and Italians. But once you're there,
anything can happen," Bravin said.
