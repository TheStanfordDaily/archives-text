Behind the high-profile athletes, the spec
tacular matchups, and the big money sports at
Stanford, you may find her quietly rowing
away on one of the machines in Encina Gym.
Her name is Bonnie Baker, and she just may be
Stanford's latest Olympic entrant.
Baker served as captain of the women's var
sity crew team this year, and this week she
hopes to carry the leadership role to Barcelona.
Baker is in New Jersey this week for the U.S.
Olympic Rowing Trials. She and her rowing
partner will face some of the best pairs rowers
in the country as they vie for a spot on the
national team.
"We've been training hard for this," Baker
said, "so we feel we have as good a shot as any
one else there."
Good won't be enough for Baker and her
partner this weekend. To qualify for one of the
spots on the U.S. team, they will have to come
in first or second in the overall competition.
Baker, however, is confident that she and her
partner can make the cut.
"I've been doing double workouts all year
(training also with the Stanford team], and this
is hopefully where it ail pays off," Baker said.
