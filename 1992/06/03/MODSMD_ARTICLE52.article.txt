When the Summer Olympics
roll around in Barcelona, don't be
surprised to hear the names of a
few Stanford Track and Field ath
letes.
Seniors Chryste Gaines and
Jackie Edwards, and sophomore
Dave Popejoy have all qualified
for the Olympic Trials, which will
be held in New Orleans in June.
In addition, senior Dave Scud
amore has qualified provisionally
for the NCAA Championships
and still has a chance to be in
Louisiana with his teammates.
Gaines, who runs in the 100-
and 200-meters and also hopes to
qualify in the 4XIOO meter relay,
won't need the sultry heat of New
Orleans to fuel her fire.
Hovering around the 11-sec
ond mark all season, Gaines
recently ran the 100-meters in a
wind-aided time of 10.90 seconds,
which is the fastest American
time this year and the second
fastest time in the world. She fol
lowed that up by winning her

third straight Pacific 10 Confer
ence title in a wind-aided time of
10.94 seconds.
Gaines made it to the Olympic
Trials in 1988 but did not make
the team. Things should be differ
ent this year.
"If I'm healthy, I'll make the
team," she said.
Edwards has also had previous
experience in the Olympics. She
competed in the 1988 Olympics in
the long jump for her native
Bahamas. Last year, she placed
tenth in the World Champi
onships in Tokyo, Japan. This
year, she won the long jump at
the NCAA Indoor Championships
and also took third in the triple
jump. She won the Pac-10 long
jump title in late May and placed
second in the triple jump. Because
there is no triple jump event for
the women in the Olympics,
Edwards will only compete in the
longjump this summer.
Popejoy is the youngster
among the bunch. A twenty-year
old hammer thrower, he will be
competing against men who are
ten and sometimes twenty years

older than him. He only recently
qualified for the Olympic Trials
when he threw a Pac-10 Confer
ence best 216 feet in Eugene, Ore
gon. His best friend from high
school, Kevin MacMahon, com
petes at Georgetown and will also
be at the Olympic Trials.
Popejoy will have the most dif
ficult chance at making his team.
Most world-class hammer throw
ers throw around 250 feet.
