After a three-day trial period at the Olympic
Training Center in Colorado Springs, the Women's
Games Committee selected 18 Olympic finalists
from a field of 54.
The ages of the 18 Olympic finalists range from 22
to 32. Two of the youngest are 1990 Stanford gradu
ates Katy Steding and Jennifer Azzi. They will play in
a small training camp until June 12, when the final
cuts will be made. At that time, 12 players and three
alternates will be selected for the Olympic team.
Azzi's selection as a finalist was expected. She
has played professionally for two years in Europe,
and led her fourth-seeded Valenciennes Orchies to a
French title recently. She also played on the USA
teams which won gold medals at the 1990 World
Championships and Goodwill Games, and the
bronze-winning 1991 Pan American Games team.
At Stanford, Azzi was a two-time Ail-American.
Her senior year she won the Margaret Wade Tro
phy, the James Naismith Award, and the Honda-
Broderick Cup, all recognizing her as the best play
er in the nation.

Steding did not receive as much attention while at
Stanford. But she also has plenty of experience, hav
ing played on the gold-medal-winning 1991 World
University Games team (coached by Stanford's Tara
VanDerveer). She has also played professionally in
Japan.
