Months after making its first
NCAA Tournament appearance
since 1978, the Stanford men's
soccer team continued its rise to
national prominence this spring.
Two representatives of the pro
gram, midfielder Rhett Harty and
head coach Colin Lindores, are
integral parts of the United States
National Under-23 Team that
qualified April 19 in Honduras for
the 1992 Summer Olympics.
Harty, a senior and captain of
the 1991 Cardinal squad, was also
a member of the gold medal-win
ning U.S. team at the 1991 Pan
American Games. The Whittier,
Ca. native won a spot on the
Under-23 team last summer, and
will almost definitely travel to
Barcelona in July with the rest of

the Olympic-qualifying group.
"Harty will most likely be [in
Barcelona]," assistant coach Greg
Petersen said. "He's been hurt a
bit by injuries, but he'll most like
ly play."
Lindores, currently in his sec
ond year on the Farm, will assist
two-time Olympic coach Lothar
Osiander in Spain. Lindores, who
was also an assistant to the 1988
U.S. Team, "qualified" for his
position via his longtime friend
ship with Osiander.
Their acquaintance dates back
to the late '60s, when Lindores
played soccer for San Jose State
and Osiander was on the Univer
sity of San Francisco squad.
