# Sanders, O'Brien named Athletes of the Year
## Tennis' Triple Crown Champ 
### 
Alex O'Brien, the 1991-92
Male Athlete of the Year, entered
uncharted waters with his
accomplishments this season.
O'Brien, one of the sole
returning starters from a talent
laden 1990-91 men's tennis
squad, began the year with a
bang, capturing the Volvo All-
America Collegiate Tournament
in October.
Yet, entering the NCAA cham
pionships in Athens, Ga. last
month, the senior was skeptical
about his chances for success.
"Sometimes, you know, you
get that feeling, like you can't do
anything wrong," O'Brien said.
"I've gotten that feeling at the
Tournament for three years now
i. . I just hope that I can get it
again soon."
Needless to say, the feeling
came back.
O'Brien led Stanford to its
third team title in four years, as
the Cardinal trounced Notre
Dame, 5-0, in the NCAA finals.
The senior clinched the team win
with a three-set victory over the
Fighting Irish's David DiLucia,
the top-ranked player in the
country at the time.
But O'Brien wasn't done yet.
He captured the NCAA singles
title a few days later, crushing
second-seeded Jose Luis Norie
ga of San Diego along the way.
O'Brien's 6-3, 6-2 victory over
Georgia's Wade McGuire in the
finals came in front of several
thousand partisan Bulldog
fans.
When O'Brien and sophomore
Chris Cocotos won the NCAA
doubles crown by defeating team
mates Vimal Patel and Jason Yee,
O'Brien became the first player
since current Stanford assistant
coach John Whitlinger in '74 to
capture the collegiate tennis
Triple Crown (team, singles, and
doubles wins).
C In doing so, the senior set a
*hew NCAA record for most
'pareer matches won in Tourna
ment competition (40).

It was O'Brien's leadership
which motivated the Cardinal all
season. The Ail-American never
hesitated to criticize or question
his teammates when he was frus
trated with their play.
"Alex and [senior Jason Yee]
have motivated us all year," said
sophomore Robert Devens. "We
wouldn't have made it (to the
finals) without them."
All this from a man who <r>vtr
played tennis more than rot
times a week before \ e can t to

the Farm. Not an explosive play
er, O'Brien never considered pro
play until his arrival at Stanford.
With his two NCAA individual
victories, though, the Amarillo,
Texas native clinched two wild
card berths in the U.S. Open at
the end of the summer.
"This is a dream come true,
for sure," said O'Brien, shortly
after the NCAAs.
As O'Brien heads to the pro
circuit this summer, let's hope
that the dream continues.
