# NCAA Swimmer of the Year
## 
### 
Summer Sanders, the 1991-92
Female Athlete of the Year, came
to Stanford in the fall of 1990 and
immediately made headlines, but
she arrived on the swimming
scene long before that.
In 1988 at the Olympic trials
in Texas, the 15-year-old Sanders
just wanted to swim well. She
had done so well just to qualify
for the trials in four events, and
she looked on the races as a

chance to experience the intensi
ty of big-time swimming and
learn from the bigger stars.
Sanders surprised herself and
many others when she qualified
for the fmals in the 400-meter
individual medley and then
recorded the best time of her life,
finishing eighth. Heads were
turning.
Then came the 200 IM.
Sanders always swam the race

trying to get ahead in her two
best legs, the butterfly and the
breaststroke, and hold on to her
lead during the fourth stage,
which is the freestyle, her worst
stroke. She absolutely flew
through the first three stages and
was ahead by a body length head
ing into the final stage before los
ing, missing the Olympic team by
just .27 seconds. Suddenly she
was a hot commodity.
Although every school in the
country with a strong swimming
program beat down her door,
Sanders chose Stanford. The next
two years of her life have been
quite rewarding.
Sanders has been named
NCAA Swimmer of the Year for
both years at Stanford. This year
she was the main force behind
the Cardinal women's swimming
title, taking home the 200 and
400 IM crowns, along with the
200 butterfly title.
She was also the world cham
pion in the 200 fly in 1991, and
she came in second in the 200 IM.
The 5-foot-9, 19 year-old
sophomore from Rosedale, Calif.,
has qualified for five events in
Barcelona: the 200 and 400 IMs,
the 100 and 200 butterflies, and
4XIOO medley relay. It is entirely
possible that she will bring home
the gold in all of these events.
May 12 Sanders announced
that she had decided to give up
her remaining college eligibility
at Stanford so she could pursue
endorsement contracts. Although
she is seeking to capitalize on the
fame that will likely come to her
from the 1992 Summer
Olympics, she will continue her
studies at Stanford after she
returns.
"This is by far the most diffi
cult decision I've ever had to
make," Sanders said. "It's a real
shame . . . but I feel like there are
certain opportunities that come
about once in a lifetime."
Sanders has made the most of
her opportunities here at Stan
ford, and we will miss her.
