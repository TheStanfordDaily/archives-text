## Drug found to suppress rejection of organ transplants Stanford and Genentech researchers find injections inhibit immune system reactions in mice with new hearts 
### Nick Strauss 
Organ transplant surgery,
although one of the most miracu
lous capabilities of modern
medicine, leaves part of its
promise unfulfilled. The problem
lies not in the transplant surgery
itself, but in preventing the recip
ient's body from "rejecting" the
new organ.
Finding a drug that would sup
press the reaction against a new
organ without affecting other
immune responses and without
needing continuous treatment
would revolutionize transplant
surgery.
Dr. Randall Morris, director of
Stanford's Kovitz Transplantation
Immunology Laboratory, and med
ical student Eric Nakakura think
they may have found this drug.
Morris, Nakakura and their
team replaced the hearts of brown
mice with white mouse hearts.
Following the surgery, they began
a treatment program of mono
clonal antibody injections,
designed to inhibit rejection by
the immune system.
Not only did the mice accept
the graft, but after 90 days of
therapy with the new drug, the
mice continued to accept the
hearts more than 100 days after
the end of treatment.
With no treatment, these
hearts would have been rejected
and stopped beating after only 10
days, and with the current stan
dard drug treatment of
cyclosporine, 40 days.
- Importantly, the immune sys
tem continues to function in a
normal fashion, as if it has now
accepted this new heart as "origi
nal equipment." Unlike after
cyclosporine treatment, the mice's
immune systems combat infection
and other grafts normally.
Rejection normally occurs
when the recipient's immune sys
tem attacks the new, donated
organ. The immune system
knows only that the new part is
foreign, marked with different
molecular tags. Since the begin
ning of transplant surgery, doc
tors have been searching for a way
to prevent the immune system
from reacting in this well-inten

tioned, but unwanted, way.
Donor organs are usually
sought from persons of similar
blood types and, if possible, rela
tives of the recipient. This, how
ever, dramatically narrows the
pool of eligible donors. Sometimes
it is possible to hunt across the
nation for a usable donor organ,
but people with rare blood types
often find themselves out of luck,
particularly if the new organ is
needed with particular urgency.
To prevent the immune system
from attacking donated organs,
doctors suppress the immune sys
tem, so that the new organ (or
graft) can survive. The main
immunosuppressive technique in
use today is drugs.
Cyclosporine, currently the
best and most common immuno
suppressive, reduces the ability of
the immune system to combat the
new organ graft, but does so at
the cost of weakening all immune
responses.
Transplant patients, who must
undergo continued cyclosporine
treatment for the rest of their
lives, are thus at a great risk for
infection or developing cancer.
This problem plagues all current
immunosuppressive drugs, as
does their inherent toxicity, which
limits the strength of the dose that
can be administered safely.
Exactly what mechanism is at
work here is not yet fully under
stood. The prevailing theory at the
lab focuses on the role of the LFA
-1 enzyme in immune reactions. T
cells are the scouts of the immune
system. In the presence of foreign
antigens (i.e., chemicals marking a
transplanted organ as foreign) and
two other triggers, they signal the
rest of the immune system to
begin attacking the foreign object.
One of the two additional trig
gers is LFA-1. With the LFA-1
neutralized by the injected anti
body, the LFA-1 is unable to trig
ger the T-cell. When T-cells
receive only one of the two needed
triggers, they become "functional
ly disabled," that is, they continue
to reproduce and live, but are
incapable of releasing the hor
mones that would start a full
rejection reaction.
There has been a great deal of

research in this direction in the
past, but it was all in vitro, in a
test-tube laboratory environ
ment. After looking in medical
and biochemical journals, the

team noticed that anti LFA-1
interferes with immune responses
and decided to try it as an
immunosuppressive. Nakakura
says the team was "surprised no
one had noticed this before."

As it turns out, two other
research groups noticed at about
the same time the Stanford group
did. After publishing their prelimi
nary findings in the January issue

of the Journal of Heart and Lung
Transplant, the team noticed that
a Japanese biochemical firm
together with Harvard published a
similar study in February, and the
National Cancer Institute pub-

lished another in April.
Like so much in science, every
one noticed the same thing at the
same time. The Stanford tech
nique is somewhat different, how
ever, and appears to offer signifi
cantly better long-term survival.
The future of anti LFA-1 anti
body therapy is not yet set. The
technique seems promising, and
studies involving monkeys, with
more human-like immune sys
tems, are soon to begin.
If these prove successful, clini
cal trials could begin within a few
years. So far, the antibody has
only been tested on heart trans
plants, but Nakakura thinks
there is a good chance it may work
on other organs as well.
Organ transplant immunosup
pressive drugs are currently a $1
billion a year business. By 1995
that figure is projected to grow by
50 percent.

Currently, the majority of this
business goes to cyclosporine, but
other drugs are beginning to gain
popularity.
RS-61443 and rapamycin, two
drugs that work well in combina
tion with cyclosporine, and that
were also researched by the
Kovitz Laboratory, are beginning
to enter general use over the next
few years.
Like all of science, this research
was very much a team effort. Dr.
Biru Zheng and Randi Shorthouse
at the Kovitz lab and Dr. Paul
Jardeau and Susan McCabe at the
San Francisco firm of Genentech
composed the remainder of Morris
and Nakakura's team.
The research was partially
funded by Genentech and the
Stanford Medical Student Schol
ars Program, which helps fund
independent research by medical
students.

Organ transplant surgery,
although one of the most miracu
lous capabilities of modern
medicine, leaves part of its
promise unfulfilled. The problem
lies not in the transplant surgery
itself, but in preventing the recip
ient's body from "rejecting" the
new organ.
Finding a drug that would sup
press the reaction against a new
organ without affecting other
immune responses and without
needing continuous treatment
would revolutionize transplant
surgery.
Dr. Randall Morris, director of
Stanford's Kovitz Transplantation
Immunology Laboratory, and med
ical student Eric Nakakura think
they may have found this drug.
Morris, Nakakura and their
team replaced the hearts of brown
mice with white mouse hearts.
Following the surgery, they began
a treatment program of mono
clonal antibody injections,
designed to inhibit rejection by
the immune system.
Not only did the mice accept
the graft, but after 90 days of
therapy with the new drug, the
mice continued to accept the
hearts more than 100 days after
the end of treatment.
With no treatment, these
hearts would have been rejected
and stopped beating after only 10
days, and with the current stan
dard drug treatment of
cyclosporine, 40 days.
- Importantly, the immune sys
tem continues to function in a
normal fashion, as if it has now
accepted this new heart as "origi
nal equipment." Unlike after
cyclosporine treatment, the mice's
immune systems combat infection
and other grafts normally.
Rejection normally occurs
when the recipient's immune sys
tem attacks the new, donated
organ. The immune system
knows only that the new part is
foreign, marked with different
molecular tags. Since the begin
ning of transplant surgery, doc
tors have been searching for a way
to prevent the immune system
from reacting in this well-inten

tioned, but unwanted, way.
Donor organs are usually
sought from persons of similar
blood types and, if possible, rela
tives of the recipient. This, how
ever, dramatically narrows the
pool of eligible donors. Sometimes
it is possible to hunt across the
nation for a usable donor organ,
but people with rare blood types
often find themselves out of luck,
particularly if the new organ is
needed with particular urgency.
To prevent the immune system
from attacking donated organs,
doctors suppress the immune sys
tem, so that the new organ (or
graft) can survive. The main
immunosuppressive technique in
use today is drugs.
Cyclosporine, currently the
best and most common immuno
suppressive, reduces the ability of
the immune system to combat the
new organ graft, but does so at
the cost of weakening all immune
responses.
Transplant patients, who must
undergo continued cyclosporine
treatment for the rest of their
lives, are thus at a great risk for
infection or developing cancer.
This problem plagues all current
immunosuppressive drugs, as
does their inherent toxicity, which
limits the strength of the dose that
can be administered safely.
Exactly what mechanism is at
work here is not yet fully under
stood. The prevailing theory at the
lab focuses on the role of the LFA
-1 enzyme in immune reactions. T
cells are the scouts of the immune
system. In the presence of foreign
antigens (i.e., chemicals marking a
transplanted organ as foreign) and
two other triggers, they signal the
rest of the immune system to
begin attacking the foreign object.
One of the two additional trig
gers is LFA-1. With the LFA-1
neutralized by the injected anti
body, the LFA-1 is unable to trig
ger the T-cell. When T-cells
receive only one of the two needed
triggers, they become "functional
ly disabled," that is, they continue
to reproduce and live, but are
incapable of releasing the hor
mones that would start a full
rejection reaction.
There has been a great deal of

research in this direction in the
past, but it was all in vitro, in a
test-tube laboratory environ
ment. After looking in medical
and biochemical journals, the

team noticed that anti LFA-1
interferes with immune responses
and decided to try it as an
immunosuppressive. Nakakura
says the team was "surprised no
one had noticed this before."

As it turns out, two other
research groups noticed at about
the same time the Stanford group
did. After publishing their prelimi
nary findings in the January issue

of the Journal of Heart and Lung
Transplant, the team noticed that
a Japanese biochemical firm
together with Harvard published a
similar study in February, and the
National Cancer Institute pub-

lished another in April.
Like so much in science, every
one noticed the same thing at the
same time. The Stanford tech
nique is somewhat different, how
ever, and appears to offer signifi
cantly better long-term survival.
The future of anti LFA-1 anti
body therapy is not yet set. The
technique seems promising, and
studies involving monkeys, with
more human-like immune sys
tems, are soon to begin.
If these prove successful, clini
cal trials could begin within a few
years. So far, the antibody has
only been tested on heart trans
plants, but Nakakura thinks
there is a good chance it may work
on other organs as well.
Organ transplant immunosup
pressive drugs are currently a $1
billion a year business. By 1995
that figure is projected to grow by
50 percent.

Currently, the majority of this
business goes to cyclosporine, but
other drugs are beginning to gain
popularity.
RS-61443 and rapamycin, two
drugs that work well in combina
tion with cyclosporine, and that
were also researched by the
Kovitz Laboratory, are beginning
to enter general use over the next
few years.
