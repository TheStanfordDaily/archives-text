# New HIV vaccine shows promise
## Despite initial success, vaccine not a cure, scientists say 
### Benjamin Jeremiah Morgan 
AIDS researchers are encouraged
by recent findings that suggest a vac
cine is successful in reducing
amounts of HIV in the blood of
patients who are in the early stages
of HIV infection.
U.S. Army doctor Robert Redfield
and his team of researchers made
the finding in a recent study. Its
results were reported by one of the
researchers in a guest lecture at
Stanford earlier this month.
"This does not suggest that there
is a cure," said Edgar Engleman, a
Stanford pathology professor and
researcher.
However, Engleman said, "The
previous pessimism about the likeli
hood of having a vaccine or an effec
tive therapy for HIV-infection is giv
ing way to optimism."
The study conducted by Redfield
examined several hundred patients
who were infected with HIV, but
who were not yet sick, according to
David Katzenstein, a professor of
medicine and infectious diseases.
The results of the three-year
study suggest that HIV proteins or
vaccines administered to HIV-infect
ed patients reduce the amount of
virus in the body "consistently and
dramatically," Engleman said.
"Whether or not this result will
be obtained in all HIV-infected indi
viduals or not, we don't know yet,"
Engleman said. "The results are bet
ter in some individuals than others."
"We only have a three-year fol
low-up so far, but I am quite encour
aged by these findings."
Despite Engleman's optimism, he
cautioned that it is "inappropriate
and unfortunate if this kind of infor

mation led to false hopes because we
do not have confirmation of long
term benefits."
The results of the study are still
"very, very tenuous," Katzenstein
said. There needs to be further fol
low-up with larger groups of individ
uals, he said.
The news about this particular
research has not been widespread
because over the past five to 10 years
so many spectacular claims and
cures in the media have made the
public "gun shy," Engleman said.
"Scientific research is an ongoing
event which results in a gradual
accumulation of better or worse
tools," Katzenstein said. The media
wants to report on a "breakthrough
with a capital 'B,'" but researchers
cannot do this, he said.
The vaccination approach of
treating those already infected is a
novel one, Engleman said. It appears
that the key to this vaccination
approach, however, is that early
detection is absolutely critical in
order for the vaccine to work, he
said.
"It's an interesting scientific
manipulation of immunization
response," Katzenstein said. There
is, however, "a long slow process of
getting it optimized," he said.
Katzenstein said that once opti
mized, there exists another timely
step of manipulating the doses and
finding out how much of the vaccine
to administer, how often, and to
whom.
Additionally, the vaccine might
have to be given repeatedly and per
haps forever, Engleman said.
"The purpose of a vaccine is to
sensitize the immune system to the
virus," Engleman said. "But if there

is no immune system, no matter how
much vaccine is used, you will not be
able to create immune sensitiza
tion."
The vaccine, therefore, will most
likely not be very useful in patients
with late-stage HIV, Engleman said.
The actual vaccine is a protein,
specifically the envelope protein
which is the protein the HIV uses to
protect itself, Katzenstein said.
When administered to individuals,
the body produces an immune
response to the protein, he said.
During this immune response,
the body's T-cells are sensitized to
the protein, multiply and are capable
of killing the HIV-infected cells.
Vaccines from many different
drug companies seem to create simi
lar effects, yet they are not currently
sold because they are being tested,
Engleman said.
So far there have been no signifi
cant side effects caused by the vac
cine, Engleman said.
"I think that there is a possibility
that within a couple of years this
vaccine could be available for the
infected individuals," he said.
More clinical trials need to be pro
duced before a vaccine could be
implemented for the public, said
Tom Merrigan, who directs the Cen
ter for AIDS Research at Stanford.
Three or four years is probably more
likely, he said. â€¢
If there are many sources from
which to obtain the vaccine, the com
petition will create a "price pres
sure," thus creating affordable treat
ment, Engleman said.
If this treatment is shown to be
effective, those who were hesitant
about getting tested might be more
likely to do so, Engleman said.
