# Thomas broke policy, judicial probe finds
## 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Senior Stuart Thomas violated
University policy in connection
with a Sept. 22 sexual assault in a
Stem Hall dormitory, the Stan
ford Judicial Council has deter
mined.
The council held its hearing on
the case last month and will send
a report to University President
Donald Kennedy within the next
two weeks, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
While she would not comment
on the charge or punishment rec
ommended by the council, she
said that a report is only sent to
the president if a violation has
been found.
A range of punishments are
available to the council, according
to Cole. Thomas' degree could be
held for a designated number of
quarters or it may never be grant
ed; he could also face monetary
fines, community service obliga
tions or a combination of the
penalties, Cole said.
The case is unprecedented in
Stanford's history. It is the first
time a University investigation of
alleged sexual misconduct has led
to formal charges against a stu
dent, according to Cole.
While the outcome of judicial
affairs cases are normally confi
dential, Cole said she hopes

Kennedy will authorize her to
release more information about
Thomas' case.
She said doing so would act as
an instructional tool and a deter
rent. "We would get significant
educational mileage out of a wide
ly publicized student misconduct
case," Cole said.
Gail Prichard, coordinator of
the Campus Sexual Assault
Response and Recovery Team,
agreed. "If the University chooses
to disclose its own interned ruling,
then it will absolutely function as
a deterrent," she said. "Often we
don't alter our behaviors until it's
clear what the consequences to us
will be."
The details of the charge and
Thomas' punishment would prob
ably not be released until fall
quarter, Cole said, so she can pro
vide "feedback to the community"
while students are here.
Thomas pleaded no contest to
two misdemeanors — statutory
rape and providing alcohol to a
minor — in January, and was sen
tenced to two years of probation,
100 hours of community service
and a $1,000 fine.
A 17-year-old freshman woman
had reported to Stanford Police
Sept. 23 that Thomas had raped
her the day before in his Casa Zap
ata room.
When Thomas was arrested
nine days later — and the details
of the incident were printed in
local newspapers — the case
sparked a campus debate on
acquaintance rape and the bound
aries of consent.
Thomas earned enough units
to graduate fall quarter, but his
degree was withheld pending the
outcome of the University's judi
cial affairs investigation.
The council, an appointed body
of 11 students and faculty, makes
the final evaluation of judicial
affairs violations before sending a
report to the University presi
dent.
The report includes the coun

cil's reasoning in arriving at the
conclusion that a student violated
University policy and its recom
mended penalty, according to
Cole.
She said "it's usually the case"
that the University president
"agrees with the reasoning" of the
council and approves its recom
mendation.
Violations of University policy
include violations of the Honor
Code, the campus disruption poli
cy and the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Given the circumstances of
Thomas' case, "it sure seems like
ly" that he fell under the jurisdic
tion of a Fundamental Standard
violation, Cole said. But she said
she would not elaborate on the
specifics of the council's opinion
because the draft of its report has
not yet been approved by all of the

council's members.
Judicial affairs investigations
very rarely progress far enough
that the council must hold a hear
ing, according to Cole. Most cases
end at the fact-finding stage
when the evidence of the case is
presented to determine whether
the investigation should continue
— or when students admit a vio
lation.
Thomas' is the only case this
academic year that has been
examined by the council, and the
body did not examine any cases
last year, Cole said.
The fact-finding hearing in
Thomas' case was held in mid-
March, Cole said. He was repre
sented by a Palo Alto attorney
during that hearing, and repre
sented himself during the coun
cil's hearing last month, she
added.
