# Thomas broke policy, judicial probe finds
## 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Senior Stuart Thomas violated
University policy in connection
with a Sept. 22 sexual assault in a
Stem Hall dormitory, the Stan
ford Judicial Council has deter
mined.
The council held its hearing on
the case last month and will send
a report to University President
Donald Kennedy within the next
two weeks, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole.
While she would not comment
on the charge or punishment rec
ommended by the council, she
said that a report is only sent to
the president if a violation has
been found.
A range of punishments are
available to the council, according
to Cole. Thomas' degree could be
held for a designated number of
quarters or it may never be grant
ed; he could also face monetary
fines, community service obliga
tions or a combination of the
penalties, Cole said.
The case is unprecedented in
Stanford's history. It is the first
time a University investigation of
alleged sexual misconduct has led
to formal charges against a stu
dent, according to Cole.
While the outcome of judicial
affairs cases are normally confi
dential, Cole said she hopes

Kennedy will authorize her to
release more information about
Thomas' case.
She said doing so would act as
an instructional tool and a deter
rent. "We would get significant
educational mileage out of a wide
ly publicized student misconduct
case," Cole said.
Gail Prichard, coordinator of
the Campus Sexual Assault
Response and Recovery Team,
agreed. "If the University chooses
to disclose its own interned ruling,
then it will absolutely function as
a deterrent," she said. "Often we
don't alter our behaviors until it's
clear what the consequences to us
will be."
The details of the charge and
Thomas' punishment would prob
ably not be released until fall
quarter, Cole said, so she can pro
vide "feedback to the community"
while students are here.
Thomas pleaded no contest to
two misdemeanors — statutory
rape and providing alcohol to a
minor — in January, and was sen
tenced to two years of probation,
100 hours of community service
and a $1,000 fine.
A 17-year-old freshman woman
had reported to Stanford Police
Sept. 23 that Thomas had raped
her the day before in his Casa Zap
ata room.
