Earthquake sparked nightmares
Bay Area college students suffered through an
unusually large number of nightmares for at least a
month following the October 1989 earthquake,
according to the findings of a recent study.
Although exposure to a traumatic event supposed
ly sparks particularly vivid nightmares according to
some clinical assumptions, students described most
nightmares — even those incorporating a quake
theme — as only slightly to moderately intense.
The study, conducted by psychologists at the Uni
versity of Arizona in Tucson, included data from 56
Stanford students, 35 San Jose State students and 97

University of Arizona students, who acted as controls.
During the study, three-quarters of the San Jose
State students and two-thirds of the Stanford stu
dents reported at least one nightmare.
