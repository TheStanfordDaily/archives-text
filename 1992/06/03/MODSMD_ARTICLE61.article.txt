A # Considering the fact that you go to
• Stanford, T.S., there is surprisingly lit
tle relativism in your questions. Allow me to
correct you:
Why are the soles of your feet so ticklish?
Is this the most ticklish part of your body?
Ticklishness, like most psychophysical
phenomena, is a fairly subjective experience.
Some people have ticklish feet, while others
respond more strongly to titillation (yes,
folks, that's what it means) of the abdomen,
inner arm or earlobe.
Many citizens of this great democracy are
ticklish in different degrees on varying parts
of their anatomy. To further complicate mat
ters, their ticklishness at each of these loci
may vary from day to day. A few of us aren't
ticklish at all.
The bottom line: Ticklishness is an individ
ual thing. Your feet may very well be the most
ticklish part of your body, but that's you. To
figure out why it's feet for you would probably
take years of psychoanalysis and myriad expen
sive calls to your mother — and for what?
Your third question, about the cause of tick
lishness in general, is a bit more interesting.
Charles Darwin, whose day job involved
giving fundamentalist Christians one more
thing to whine about, was the first to point
out that the innate response to tickling is an
effort to withdraw from the source of stimu
lus. This might be a defense reaction, he sug
gested, designed to protect against attacks on
vulnerable portions of the body.
The actual mechanism by which tactile
stimulus is translated into a tickle is not well
understood, although it is thought to involve
the triggering of pressure receptors in some
indeterminate way.
Unfortunately, since Darwin, AIDS, can
cer, world hunger and an impending environ
mental catastrophe have drawn the biomedi
cal research community's attention away
from the physiological causes of ticklishness.
In the field of psychology, however, few
such utilitarian distractions exist. Not sur
prisingly, this discipline has a substantial
amount of wisdom to offer on the subject of
ticklishness.
Some years ago, tenured Yale professors
with nothing better to do observed that
babies less than one year old were 15 times
more likely to laugh when tickled by their
mothers than when tickled by an unfamiliar
woman. When confronted by the strangers,
the babies usually just squirmed and cried.
From this, the researchers concluded that

infants laugh when tickled only when they
perceive the tickling as a mock attack.
This theory explains why the Yale babies
cried at strangers, but giggled at their moth
ers. The tickler must impersonate an aggres
sor, but simultaneously be known by the vic
tim to be harmless. With a stranger, little
folks just can't be sure.
Even with the babies' own mothers, the
infants alternately laughed and looked appre
hensive. In the investigators' opinion, it was
precisely the dissipation of this tension, upon
realizing that they had nothing to fear, that
caused the infants to laugh as they squirmed.
Thus, the rule of the tickling game is, "Let
me be frightened for a little while, so that I
can enjoy the relief."
In the case of Stanford students and other
"adults," the situation is a bit more complex.
One observation accessible to all, however,
provides insight into adult ticklishness: You
cannot tickle yourself. According to Chuck
Darwin, this is because "the precise point of
tickling must not be known." From this, we
can tentatively conclude that ticklishness is
due to one's appreciation for a temporary loss
of control over an interaction.
If this hypothesis is correct, we might
expect tickling to assume sexual overtones, as
indeed it does.
Recall also that death is often used in lit
erature as a metaphor for orgasm. This sug
gests an alternative reading of the expression
"to be tickled to death" that is — to say the
least — titillating.

Chris Patil is tickled to death that the year is
almost over. If you have questions over the
summer, write him do The Daily, Storke
