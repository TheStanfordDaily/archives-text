# New black journal published
## 'Enigma' reflects diverse identities within one community 
### Kimberly Chrisman Editorial staff 
The name of Stanford's new journal of black
expression, "Enigma," refers to the ambiguity and
diversity of black identity, according to its two edi
tors.
"There's this enormous plurality of black experi
ences, and that's one of the things we tried to convey
in 'Enigma,' " said senior Omar Wasow. "It's not
quite multicultural, but it's multifaceted within a
black perspective."
"We've tried in the first issue to have a diversity
of voices, not just people who are active in the core
community," added senior Danzy Senna. "I think
that can open dialogue about what blackness is."
More than 1,000 copies of the journal will be dis
tributed to dorms and departments around campus
this week following a reading and reception at Uja
maa last night.
"Enigma" includes more than 100 pages of
poems, short stories, essays, drawings and pho
tographs by 23 students and two University admin
istrators, Keith Archuleta and Earl Black.
Eeatured in the first issue is an interview with
Stanford graduate Trey Ellis, author of an essay on
what he calls "the New Black Aesthetic" and a novel,
"Platitudes."
"His essay talks about redefining black identity to
be more inclusive of the experiences of middle class
and upper middle class blacks, rather than straight
ghetto men," Wasow said. "A lot of the issues he
deals with are relevant to other communities of
color."
Although nearly all of the journal's contributors
are black, Wasow said he thinks future issues should

include "pieces dealing with dialogue between blacks
and non-blacks."
But Senna said she thinks the journal will be of
interest to students of all ethnicities.
"Often a poem or short story can say much more
to people than a political article," she said.
According to Wasow, "Enigma" is "very political
but very subtle. It expresses politics in creative
ways." The journal was produced by minority-owned
printing and linotronic companies "to bring some
sort of political agenda to the whole project," Wasow
said.
The journal represents an attempt to create an
artistic community within the black community at
Stanford — an especially difficult task in the face of
budget cuts to the performing arts.
"Basically, there didn't seem to be much of a
black arts community at Stanford," Wasow said.
"There were a lot of pre-professionals and engineers,
but not as many fuzzy people.
"At the same time, it's clear that a lot of people do
write poetry or create art at the same time as being
engineers," he added. "One way to bring those peo
ple together was through a publication."
The editors soon found themselves overwhelmed
by submissions. Ultimately, "each person probably
got about a third of their stuff run," Wasow said.
"The first issue of something is usually the hard
est to put out, but it was so easy to get people to sub
mit things to this," Senna said. "There was a lot
more creativity here than I thought."
The project was funded by various dorms, the
Black House, the Black Community Services Center
and the Publications Board.
"We still have a few checks to pay," Wasow said.
"But we'll come out in the black, as it were."
