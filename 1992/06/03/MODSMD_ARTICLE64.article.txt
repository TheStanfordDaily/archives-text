Students representing MEChA and El Centro
Chicano joined members of the Justice for Janitors
organization at a rally in White Plaza Friday to
protest the low wages earned by Stanford janitors
contracted by ACME Building Maintenance.
But University officials say ACME's contracts are
private negotiations, and the University has no place
in such matters.
At the rally, group members distributed a flier
explaining that ACME "recruits almost exclusively
Latino immigrants for this hard work that pays
$5.80 - $6.30 per hour." ACME janitors service aca
demic and office areas on campus.
Ihe flier urged University students not to "let
injustice be committed in your name."
Community Action Coalition member Adriana
Martinez, who headed the rally, told the crowd of
about 75, "All we are asking for is justice."
Martinez urged students to "pressure the admin
istration to directly pressure ACME" into negotiat
ing a better contract for the janitors.

After the rally, the crowd marched through cam
pus to University President Donald Kennedy's
office. They wanted to schedule a meeting to plan a
University investigation of the ACME contract
Kennedy, however, was not in his office at the tim^.
But Herbert Fong, the University Manager
Operations and Maintenance, said the University
has no control over the ACME janitors' wages.
According to Fong, a consortium in the Sant£
Clara and San Mateo Counties negotiates wages with
the local unions. After the wage has been establishea,
private companies belonging to the consortium, like
ACME, pay the negotiated wage to their employees]
Fong said it is his responsibility to "ensure that
ACME is providing the services that we have con
tracted them to do." Because the janitors' wages are
not part of the University's contract, "the Universi
ty will not interfere with contractors' negotiations
with the union," Fong said.
According to Keith Smith, University manager 0f
employee relations, the University has sent a letter
to both ACME and Justice for Janitors urging them
to negotiate "a fair and equitable settlement."
