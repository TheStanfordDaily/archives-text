# New Haas Center on the way
## Ground-breaking celebrates beginning of construction 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Approximately 175 donors, fac
ulty, staff, students and govern
ment officials attended the ground
breaking ceremony for the new
14,000-square-foot Haas Center
for Public Service building yester
day afternoon.
The new building, which will
have four and a half times as much
workable space as the present
Owen House, is due to be complet
ed around January.
Tim Stanton, acting director of
the Haas Center, described the
ceremony as marking "the near
completion of a long, hard strug
gle to put public service on Stan
ford's map"
The ceremony, led by Universi
ty president Donald Kennedy, con
sisted of a brief summary of public
service at Stanford, the annual

presentation of the McNair schol
arships to Upward Bound seniors,
a recognition of the center's major
contributors and a ceremonial
ground-breaking.
Opening the ceremony,
Kennedy described the event as "a
terrific moment" that celebrates
"the rising of a new building and
sends off terrific young people to
start a building of their own."
Kennedy said the new Haas
Center "will enable many existing
and new projects to flourish in ways
they couldn't do in the space limita
tions of the present building."
Haas Center staff and volun
teers echoed Kennedy's sentiment
about the new space. Catherine
Milton, the director of the Haas
Center who has spent the past year
in Washington, D.C., said the new
building is "a dream come true."
She added that volunteers,
who currently are often forced to

work in the halls or in their own
dorms because of limited space in
the Owen House, will appreciate
the larger facilities.
The added space will allow for
good, interactive working condi
tions "between the students, staff
and groups concentrating on differ
ent kinds of service," as well as give
additional groups, such as Volun
teers in Asia, a "permanent home. "
Sophomore Joanna Lin, a
Stanford in Government J. E.
Wallace Sterling fellow, said
believes that the additional space
will give the students great ideas,
pride and motivation to do work
for the community.
In addition to more working
space, the new building will include
a conference room to be named after
Kennedy, an outside area for recep
tions and classrooms for small con
ferences, meetings and programs
with East Palo Alto students.
So far, there are no plans to fill
the existing space in Owen House
once the Haas Center moves ou£,
but Milton says the Law School
tentatively plans to use the sec
ond floor of the building.
When Tom Ford, chairman of
the Haas Center Advisory Board,
presented the McNair scholar
ships, he said that "without the
vision of Donald Kennedy and the
generosity of the Haas family" the
center would not be a reality.
Ford cited Upward Bound, a
program in which Stanford stu
dents work with low income, first
generation college-bound
as a "classic example of what the
Haas center and Stanford stu
dents can do." \
The $1,000 McNair Scholar
ships were given to the eleven
local high school seniors in this
year's program to go toward their
college educations.
Kennedy specifically recog
nized the contributions of Tom
and Susan Ford and Peter
Mary Haas. Milton also acknowl
edged the hundreds of donations

of the Haas Center for Public Service, present a plaque to Mimi Haas
at yesterday's ground breaking for the center's new building.
from students, faculty, staff,
alumni and community members
to fund the new project.
The Haas family, through
donations and endowment, gave
$1.5 million to the $3.25 million
project.
Sophomore Neal Black, one of
the Ravenswood-Stanford Tutor
ing Program coordinators in the
Haas Center, said he believes it is
"very significant that people are
willing to give money to public
service and show their confidence
in Stanford student groups."
In the ceremony, Mimi Haas
said that seeing students so
dedicated and committed to
public service provides a ray of
hope in an otherwise depressed
society.
Before the ceremony, Peter
Haas said that it is "important to
believe in public service" so as to
one day put the best people in
government.
During a symbolic ceremony of
passing the ground-breaking
shovel among everyone present at
the ceremony, a few students
remarked on what community
service means to them.
The program concluded with
brief remarks from Haas Centen
nial Professor John Gardner.
Gardner praised Kennedy's lead
ership for "embedding the idea of
public service into this great Uni
versity."
Gardner described the new
building as a place that will
"house a dream that will glow
from within."
