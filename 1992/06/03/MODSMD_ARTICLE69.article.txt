# INTERMISSION
## THE 						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY The 						Year in Review 
### Joel Stein 
Wednesday, June 3, 1992

I know what you people want.
You want someone to tell
you what a tough year it was
and what brave little soldiers you
are for getting through it.
Maybe you're expecting cute lit
tle phrases to sum things up, like
"The Year of Great Change" or
"The Year of Instability" or "The
Year People Spent Lots of Money
on What they Could Have Seen for
Free on Saturday Night Live."
Well, I'm not going to give you
the pleasure.
Because you didn't give it to me.
Instead, I'm going to remind
you for one last time that you have
terrible memories and that you,
along with the rest of society, are
going to repeat the same mistakes
over and over again until you're
forced to split up Germany one
final time.
So now, I present to you, with
out sparing any of the gruesome
details or esoteric analogies, the
Year in Review.
• Don Kennedy "Resigns."
(Summer — when no one could
write a humor column about it)
Although D.K.'s resignation has
no connection with the indirect
cost thing, many people, much to
Hume's chagrin, foolishly make
assumptions of causality.
"Actually," said a close adviser
to the president, "he just got tired
of having people yell 'Stop, it's
Hamrdla time' every time he start
ed to speak."
• Stuart Thomas Trial. (,4//
quarter long, like a demented EBF
party) Creative lawyers seize upon
Clarence Thomas/Long-Dong Sil
ver hysteria to create the now infa
mous "big penis" defense. Denny
Green considers adding it to the
play book.
In a creative move of his own,
"Stu" Thomas pays off the Review
and, in a separate yet related deal,
avoids having to play villain for the
entire year by inventing another
clever plan and paying off Keith
Rabois.
• Centennial Celebration.
[About 100 years after we started)
The Doobie Brothers and Jean-
Pierre Rampal put aside their dif
ferences and demand that the
1891 time-capsule thing in the
Inner Quad be opened to deter
mine the cause of Zachary Tay
lor's death. Instead, the campus
receives a frighteningly beautiful
Muzak version of "Jesus is Just
Alright."

• Delt House Burns. (A hot
autumn night) Old, useless Delt
House burns as fraternity brothers
run to collect insurance money.
"Let's just say we have friends
in low places," explains an
unnamed fraternity member.
• Gay Rights Protest Aimed at
Governor. (October, hut before
dressing in Little 80-Peep outfits is
truly acceptable) Students lob
frozen oranges at Pete Wilson, in a
political version of a Big Game
half-time show. Wilson catches an
orange bare-handed and considers
it a political/masculine victory.
• Friday Flicks. [Ask a grad stu
dent) Socially stymied ASSU
members scrap such ideas as "Oil
Wrestling Night" and "Naked
Mechanical Bull Riding Night"
and come up with this radical
plan.
"Between the Tuesday Films,
Flicks and new Classic Flicks,
there is no need to be alone in the
dark anymore," said one ASSU
member.
• Break-in at the Band Shak.
[November) A not-so-intelligent
thief breaks into the band "shak"
and tries to steal stuff. Band folks
get last laugh when thief runs off
with four rats, two moldy keg taps
and several venereal diseases.
• Big Game. [In the heat of
November) We won the Axe, wept
for joy, and then immediately put
it into a glass case next to the bath
rooms and Tresidder Ticket
Office. Cal hotshot Brian Treggs
regrets promise when he receives a
barrage of calls from John-Edward,
cain 111 less than 24 hours later.
• Art for Art's Sake Rally.
[Late, dark November) University
tells angry drama students to do
their first real improvising.
Instead, artistes attack campus
with a day of endless a cappella
renditions of "Brown-Eyed Girl."
• Biddle Announces He Will
Leave to Run for Office. [The
part of December when you 're still
wearing T-shirts even though it
makes your nipples hard) Bringing
his own brand of phlegm-infested
realism into the world of politics,
Paul Biddle runs on the "Save
money — put K-12 in one big
classroom" campaign. Benno
Schmidt considers taking role of
campaign organizer.
• Benny Sandoval Chooses
Bowling Green State's Mary
Edmonds as Vice President for
Student Resources. [Very begin
ning of what deceptively looked

like a decent year) Lame duck
Kennedy is visibly shaken over
Sandoval's willingness to disclose
information to The Daily.
"Secrets are secrets, and Don
feels a little hurt," said a close
adviser. "It's sad, but I guess the
whole 'cross your heart hope to die'
thing just doesn't mean anything
anymore."
• Three Stanford Rhodes
Scholars named. [December, right
near Kwanzaa) Cory Booker, excit
ed about receiving the prestigious
award, was sure that it, along with
his other sundry accomplish
ments, would help land him one of
them Daily columns.
• 300-lb. Cyst Removed from
Otherwise Svelte Woman.
[December, the day it finally
rained) Entire campus gets big,
ugly rug pulled over its eyes by
practical joke. Food service, how
ever, plays an even bigger one.
• Soto returns. (Mid-January)
Giving a sick twist to the classic
Lassie plot, six young men, calling
themselves Daryl and wearing
Groucho glasses, returned a large
cement dog to its rightful home.
Soto residents cried. The cement
dog didn't.
• Denny Green leaves. ( Jan.
10, 1 p.m. — 3 p.m. in Minneapo
lis) After big Aloha Bowl loss,
Green, disgusted by 300-lb. men
crying in 200 degree heat, decides
to head off to more temperate cli
mates.
• Bill Walsh returns. [Less than
a week later) Students scream, do
little dance and suddenly acquire
fond, non-classic rock retro-excite
ment over the '70s. Although busy
hiring a new staff, meeting players
and reacquainting with college
football, Coach Walsh finds time
to do cheesy radio spots for the
Athletics Department.
"What I really love is the peo
ple," he said between "Dream
Weaver" and"In a Gadda Da
Vida."
• Provost James Rosse Quits
for Newspaper Job. [Just the time
when we needed a provost most)
Confused himself as to what a
provost is supposed to do, Rosse
decides to stop the madness and
put an end to his eight-year reign.
• Music Program Made Really
Small. [Julie Andrews' birthday)
As part of the first budget cut, the
arts program was put on the cut
ting board.


"Let's just say, after what we did
to it, it's a soprano now," confided
one budget-cutting insider.
• Keith Rabois Becomes the
Anti-Christ. [Ask Michael Jackson)
Rabois provides entire campus
with opportunity to be PC for a day
at absolutely no extra cost. One
young, forgetful frosh becomes
ostracized by his entire dorm for
failing to write his own angry, anti-
Rabois letter to The Daily.
"I'm a first-year CIV student,"

the freshman told The Daily. "1
know what I have and haven't to
write."
• Bookstore Scam Uncovered.
(Groundhog Day) An in-depth
report by The Daily uncovers that
the Stanford Bookstore is spending
money from expensive textbooks
on a giant fleet of cars. Entire cam
pus feigns surprise. Although trav
eling incognito, senior staff writer
John Wagner is shooed angrily out
of the second-floor "pens" section.
• Defenders of Self-Defense
Class Storm Kennedy's Bastille.

[Mid-February) Accustomed to
such intrusions, the no-longer
pusillanimous president prepared
to face the angry women.
"Uh, hi. Do you have some
thing for me?" he calmly asked.
The protesters immediately
jumped into position, placed their
hands in front of their mouths and
yelled, sending Kennedy back into
an expensive Baccarat vase.
"Ooops," apologized one protester.
"We thought he said, 'I have some
thing for you, baby.'"
"But he was probably thinking

it," said another.
• Big, Scary Tuition Hike
Announced. [End of February)
"Stanford has always been selec
tive," said one official. "And there
are plenty of smart, rich kids out
there."
• Survey Reveals that 60 Per
cent of Students Cheat. [Feb. 13)
A second survey reveals that the
other 40 percent lie.
• Student Gets in Altercation
with Police Officers. (End of Jan
uary, darkest day of the year) At a
particularly wild Kairos party,

Baird Mac Guinneas played
Lawrence Taylor to Captain Raoul
Niemeyer's Bill Parcells and
poured beer on a group of unsus
pecting officer's heads.
"Considering the fact that the
only contact between him and
them was a liquid, they were han
dling him pretty roughly," com
mented one repressed observer in
the next day's Daily.
"It wasn't like these police offi
cers acted like Bob Whitfield.
Mac Guineas was in complete con
trol the whole time," explained a
senior from Simi Valley.
• Kirk Varnedoe Named as
Commencement Speaker. (March
hare) Indirect-cost controversy
takes its toll as the best we can
muster up is a museum curator.
Baffled students are angered by
administration's lame unconvinc
ing argument: "There's no joke
here," a University official said,
"we just like saying the name
'Varnedoe.'"
• Gerhard Casper Named New
President. (March 17) Students
experience scary nightmares about
being woken up late at night and
being forced to march circles in the
Oval. Professor Dement calms
them with large slides showing
students that Casper looks just
like Leslie Nielson.
• Intermission's Short Story
Reaches Climax. (Ooooh, who
can forget) Dominic Nulpart curs
es three times in one sentence. Edi
tors don't notice in supreme act of
modernism.
• Nightline Tries to Bring
Famous People Here. (April 10)
Actually, it was just Pat Buchanan,
ferry Brown and Jesse Jackson, but
we got to get a real close look at
Koppel's "hairline."
• Milburn, Students First Get
50-Yard Line Seats. (The day the
music began to die) No, really. I
swear. Well, I mean, we did speak
to him and we did get the seats. I
never drew any conclusions. You'll
stop whining when you're sitting
10 feet away from Bill's crotch. I
know I will.
• Fake Edit Endorses I Prefer
Not to Have a COP. (Deep, dark
April) Wacky pranksters using the
Review's business phone stop the
presses and insert their own edito
rial. Daily puts up large, colorful,
Old West-like posters threatening
to perform Inquisition-like torture
upon anyone with information.
Everyone forgets about it the next
day. Except me.
• I Prefer Not Wins. (The day
that will live in infamy) Students
everywhere begin to prefer not to
do homework, prefer not to pay
their tuition bills and prefer not to
use urinals. I prefer to make vague
ly threatening calls to Ed Mun's
mother.
• Students View Their Records.
(One crazy week) Several deflated
students hear the first pseudo-nega
tive comments of their lives, discov

er Dean lean wasn't the innocent
goddess they had created and decide
to throw themselves Fawn Hall
style into the shredder. Dean Mon
toya laughs ironically.
• Rodney King Protests [Right
after the verdict) Black and non
black students join hands, wear
black, try to figure out what
MEChA has to do with any of this
and block traffic on a small street
in Palo Alto.
"If we can come together to take
over Ramona Avenue, just imag
ine what we could do to Emerson,"
said an overzealous protester who
once had trouble returning a gift to
Copeland Sports.
• Jerry Brown to Come to Terra.
( Early May) At the last minute
Brown decides to hold his fund-rais
er at a local church instead.
"It's not that it's raunchy,"
explained a Brown coordinator.
"It's just that they shower togethr
er. Even Jerry thinks that's gross.";
• Dethroned Leader Michaej
Gorbachev Returns. [May, what
better month to wed communism
and capitalism!) The Beatlesesqui
hoopla just wasn't there this time
as Gorby, stepping full-bodied and
bald-headed into the wild, wacky
world of capitalism, spoke to a$
many Stanford students as he
could fit in one place, plugging his
new autobiography as if he were
completely familiar with the West
ern tradition of late-night televir
sion.
• Carrina Merrick Stalks Guy
Through E-Mail. ( Mid-May)
Techies all around campus invent
strange fantasies that she is follow
ing them, too. They create strange
bulletin boards about such fan
tasies. Ex-Med school guru Gerald
Silverberg considers joining on.
• Queerland Protests Convert
ed-Lesbian Speaker. [C'mon. It
was like two weeks ago) About 800
gay-rights supporters showed up at
a Campus Crusade for Christ
meeting and had a hoot of a time
threatening to give them the
cooties.
"Can't Jesus protect you from
the cooties?" taunted one gay
rights activist.
Well there you have it, the
ugliness exposed for
everyone to see.
Don't fret, kids. Just think of all
the comedy ahead. A German pres
ident, more budget cuts and two
more years of Keith Rabois. It's
like a Mel Brooks character's
dream come true.
So stick around and stay a while,
take a few less units and learn to
love this place. It's here to stay as
long as we keep paying off that U.S.
News and World Report guy.

Joel Stein's year rivaled the Uni

summer hiatus, so clip out some
old ones, pace yourself and pre

members scrap such ideas as "Oil
Wrestling Night" and "Naked
Mechanical Bull Riding Night"

Flicks and new Classic Flicks,
there is no need to be alone in the
dark anymore," said one ASSU
member.
• Break-in at the Band Shak.

thief breaks into the band "shak"
and tries to steal stuff. Band folks
get last laugh when thief runs off
with four rats, two moldy keg taps
and several venereal diseases.
• Big Game. [In the heat of
November) We won the Axe, wept
for joy, and then immediately put
it into a glass case next to the bath
rooms and Tresidder Ticket
Office. Cal hotshot Brian Treggs
regrets promise when he receives a
barrage of calls from John-Edward,
cain 111 less than 24 hours later.

part of December when you 're still
wearing T-shirts even though it
makes your nipples hard) Bringing

Paul Biddle runs on the "Save
money — put K-12 in one big
classroom" campaign. Benno
Schmidt considers taking role of
campaign organizer.
• Benny Sandoval Chooses
Bowling Green State's Mary
Edmonds as Vice President for
Student Resources. [Very begin
ning of what deceptively looked

like a decent year) Lame duck
Kennedy is visibly shaken over
Sandoval's willingness to disclose
information to The Daily.
"Secrets are secrets, and Don
feels a little hurt," said a close
adviser. "It's sad, but I guess the
whole 'cross your heart hope to die'
thing just doesn't mean anything
anymore."
• Three Stanford Rhodes
Scholars named. [December, right
near Kwanzaa) Cory Booker, excit

ugly rug pulled over its eyes by
practical joke. Food service, how
ever, plays an even bigger one.

Lassie plot, six young men, calling
themselves Daryl and wearing
Groucho glasses, returned a large
cement dog to its rightful home.

to head off to more temperate cli
mates.
• Bill Walsh returns. [Less than
a week later) Students scream, do
little dance and suddenly acquire
fond, non-classic rock retro-excite
ment over the '70s. Although busy
hiring a new staff, meeting players
and reacquainting with college
football, Coach Walsh finds time

Athletics Department.
"What I really love is the peo
ple," he said between "Dream
Weaver" and"In a Gadda Da
Vida."
• Provost James Rosse Quits

Small. [Julie Andrews' birthday)

to it, it's a soprano now," confided
one budget-cutting insider.
• Keith Rabois Becomes the
Anti-Christ. [Ask Michael Jackson)
Rabois provides entire campus

John Wagner is shooed angrily out
of the second-floor "pens" section.
• Defenders of Self-Defense
Class Storm Kennedy's Bastille.

[Mid-February) Accustomed to
such intrusions, the no-longer
pusillanimous president prepared
to face the angry women.
"Uh, hi. Do you have some
thing for me?" he calmly asked.
The protesters immediately
jumped into position, placed their
hands in front of their mouths and
yelled, sending Kennedy back into
an expensive Baccarat vase.
"Ooops," apologized one protester.
"We thought he said, 'I have some
thing for you, baby.'"
"But he was probably thinking

it," said another.

pecting officer's heads.
"Considering the fact that the
only contact between him and
them was a liquid, they were han
dling him pretty roughly," com
mented one repressed observer in
the next day's Daily.
"It wasn't like these police offi
cers acted like Bob Whitfield.
Mac Guineas was in complete con
trol the whole time," explained a
senior from Simi Valley.

here," a University official said,
"we just like saying the name
'Varnedoe.'"
• Gerhard Casper Named New

modernism.

• Milburn, Students First Get
50-Yard Line Seats. (The day the
music began to die) No, really. I
swear. Well, I mean, we did speak
to him and we did get the seats. I
never drew any conclusions. You'll
stop whining when you're sitting
10 feet away from Bill's crotch. I
know I will.
• Fake Edit Endorses I Prefer
Not to Have a COP. (Deep, dark
April) Wacky pranksters using the
Review's business phone stop the
presses and insert their own edito
rial. Daily puts up large, colorful,
Old West-like posters threatening
to perform Inquisition-like torture
upon anyone with information.
Everyone forgets about it the next
day. Except me.
• I Prefer Not Wins. (The day
that will live in infamy) Students
everywhere begin to prefer not to
do homework, prefer not to pay
their tuition bills and prefer not to
use urinals. I prefer to make vague
ly threatening calls to Ed Mun's
mother.

(One crazy week) Several deflated
students hear the first pseudo-nega
tive comments of their lives, discov

er Dean lean wasn't the innocent
goddess they had created and decide
to throw themselves Fawn Hall
style into the shredder. Dean Mon
toya laughs ironically.
• Rodney King Protests [Right
after the verdict) Black and non
black students join hands, wear
black, try to figure out what
MEChA has to do with any of this
and block traffic on a small street

over Ramona Avenue, just imag
ine what we could do to Emerson,"
said an overzealous protester who
once had trouble returning a gift to
Copeland Sports.
• Jerry Brown to Come to Terra.
( Early May) At the last minute
Brown decides to hold his fund-rais
er at a local church instead.

explained a Brown coordinator.
"It's just that they shower togethr
er. Even Jerry thinks that's gross.";
• Dethroned Leader Michaej
Gorbachev Returns. [May, what
better month to wed communism
and capitalism!) The Beatlesesqui
hoopla just wasn't there this time
as Gorby, stepping full-bodied and
bald-headed into the wild, wacky
world of capitalism, spoke to a$
many Stanford students as he
could fit in one place, plugging his
new autobiography as if he were
completely familiar with the West
ern tradition of late-night televir
sion.
• Carrina Merrick Stalks Guy
Through E-Mail. ( Mid-May)
Techies all around campus invent
strange fantasies that she is follow
ing them, too. They create strange
bulletin boards about such fan
tasies. Ex-Med school guru Gerald
Silverberg considers joining on.
• Queerland Protests Convert
ed-Lesbian Speaker. [C'mon. It
was like two weeks ago) About 800
gay-rights supporters showed up at
a Campus Crusade for Christ
meeting and had a hoot of a time
threatening to give them the
cooties.
"Can't Jesus protect you from
the cooties?" taunted one gay
rights activist.
Well there you have it, the
ugliness exposed for
everyone to see.
Don't fret, kids. Just think of all
the comedy ahead. A German pres
ident, more budget cuts and two
more years of Keith Rabois. It's
like a Mel Brooks character's
dream come true.
So stick around and stay a while,
take a few less units and learn to
love this place. It's here to stay as
long as we keep paying off that U.S.
News and World Report guy.

Joel Stein's year rivaled the Uni
versity's. His column will be on
summer hiatus, so clip out some
old ones, pace yourself and pre
tend they're repeats.
Wednesday, June 3, 1992

I know what you people want.
You want someone to tell
you what a tough year it was
and what brave little soldiers you
are for getting through it.
Maybe you're expecting cute lit
tle phrases to sum things up, like
"The Year of Great Change" or
"The Year of Instability" or "The
Year People Spent Lots of Money
on What they Could Have Seen for
Free on Saturday Night Live."
Well, I'm not going to give you
the pleasure.
Because you didn't give it to me.
Instead, I'm going to remind
you for one last time that you have
terrible memories and that you,
along with the rest of society, are
going to repeat the same mistakes
over and over again until you're
forced to split up Germany one
final time.
So now, I present to you, with
out sparing any of the gruesome
details or esoteric analogies, the
Year in Review.
• Don Kennedy "Resigns."
(Summer — when no one could
write a humor column about it)
Although D.K.'s resignation has
no connection with the indirect
cost thing, many people, much to
Hume's chagrin, foolishly make
assumptions of causality.
"Actually," said a close adviser
to the president, "he just got tired
of having people yell 'Stop, it's
Hamrdla time' every time he start
ed to speak."
• Stuart Thomas Trial. (,4//
quarter long, like a demented EBF
party) Creative lawyers seize upon
Clarence Thomas/Long-Dong Sil
ver hysteria to create the now infa
mous "big penis" defense. Denny
Green considers adding it to the
play book.
In a creative move of his own,
"Stu" Thomas pays off the Review
and, in a separate yet related deal,
avoids having to play villain for the
entire year by inventing another
clever plan and paying off Keith
Rabois.
• Centennial Celebration.
[About 100 years after we started)
The Doobie Brothers and Jean-
Pierre Rampal put aside their dif
ferences and demand that the
1891 time-capsule thing in the

mine the cause of Zachary Tay

wearing T-shirts even though it
makes your nipples hard) Bringing

money — put K-12 in one big

Schmidt considers taking role of
campaign organizer.
• Benny Sandoval Chooses
Bowling Green State's Mary
Edmonds as Vice President for

like a decent year) Lame duck
Kennedy is visibly shaken over

feels a little hurt," said a close
adviser. "It's sad, but I guess the
whole 'cross your heart hope to die'
thing just doesn't mean anything
anymore."
• Three Stanford Rhodes
Scholars named. [December, right
near Kwanzaa) Cory Booker, excit

Lassie plot, six young men, calling
themselves Daryl and wearing
Groucho glasses, returned a large
cement dog to its rightful home.

dog didn't.
• Denny Green leaves. ( Jan.
10, 1 p.m. — 3 p.m. in Minneapo
lis) After big Aloha Bowl loss,
Green, disgusted by 300-lb. men
crying in 200 degree heat, decides
to head off to more temperate cli
mates.
• Bill Walsh returns. [Less than
a week later) Students scream, do
little dance and suddenly acquire
fond, non-classic rock retro-excite
ment over the '70s. Although busy
hiring a new staff, meeting players
and reacquainting with college
football, Coach Walsh finds time
to do cheesy radio spots for the
Athletics Department.
"What I really love is the peo
ple," he said between "Dream
Weaver" and"In a Gadda Da
Vida."
• Provost James Rosse Quits

Small. [Julie Andrews' birthday)

one budget-cutting insider.

Anti-Christ. [Ask Michael Jackson)
Rabois provides entire campus
with opportunity to be PC for a day
at absolutely no extra cost. One

failing to write his own angry, anti-
Rabois letter to The Daily.
"I'm a first-year CIV student,"

the freshman told The Daily. "1

write."
• Bookstore Scam Uncovered.
(Groundhog Day) An in-depth
report by The Daily uncovers that

Class Storm Kennedy's Bastille.

[Mid-February) Accustomed to
such intrusions, the no-longer
pusillanimous president prepared
to face the angry women.
"Uh, hi. Do you have some
thing for me?" he calmly asked.
The protesters immediately
jumped into position, placed their
hands in front of their mouths and
yelled, sending Kennedy back into
an expensive Baccarat vase.
"Ooops," apologized one protester.
"We thought he said, 'I have some
thing for you, baby.'"
"But he was probably thinking

it," said another.

Niemeyer's Bill Parcells and
poured beer on a group of unsus
pecting officer's heads.
"Considering the fact that the
only contact between him and
them was a liquid, they were han
dling him pretty roughly," com
mented one repressed observer in
the next day's Daily.
"It wasn't like these police offi
cers acted like Bob Whitfield.
Mac Guineas was in complete con
trol the whole time," explained a
senior from Simi Valley.
• Kirk Varnedoe Named as
Commencement Speaker. (March
hare) Indirect-cost controversy
takes its toll as the best we can
muster up is a museum curator.
Baffled students are angered by
administration's lame unconvinc
ing argument: "There's no joke
here," a University official said,
"we just like saying the name
'Varnedoe.'"
• Gerhard Casper Named New

modernism.

Actually, it was just Pat Buchanan,
ferry Brown and Jesse Jackson, but
we got to get a real close look at
Koppel's "hairline."
• Milburn, Students First Get
50-Yard Line Seats. (The day the
music began to die) No, really. I
swear. Well, I mean, we did speak
to him and we did get the seats. I
never drew any conclusions. You'll
stop whining when you're sitting
10 feet away from Bill's crotch. I
know I will.
• Fake Edit Endorses I Prefer
Not to Have a COP. (Deep, dark
April) Wacky pranksters using the
Review's business phone stop the
presses and insert their own edito
rial. Daily puts up large, colorful,
Old West-like posters threatening
to perform Inquisition-like torture
upon anyone with information.
Everyone forgets about it the next
day. Except me.
• I Prefer Not Wins. (The day
that will live in infamy) Students
everywhere begin to prefer not to
do homework, prefer not to pay
their tuition bills and prefer not to
use urinals. I prefer to make vague
ly threatening calls to Ed Mun's
mother.
• Students View Their Records.
(One crazy week) Several deflated
students hear the first pseudo-nega
tive comments of their lives, discov

er Dean lean wasn't the innocent
goddess they had created and decide
to throw themselves Fawn Hall
style into the shredder. Dean Mon
toya laughs ironically.
• Rodney King Protests [Right
after the verdict) Black and non
black students join hands, wear
black, try to figure out what
MEChA has to do with any of this
and block traffic on a small street
in Palo Alto.
"If we can come together to take
over Ramona Avenue, just imag
ine what we could do to Emerson,"
said an overzealous protester who
once had trouble returning a gift to
Copeland Sports.
• Jerry Brown to Come to Terra.
( Early May) At the last minute
Brown decides to hold his fund-rais
er at a local church instead.
"It's not that it's raunchy,"
explained a Brown coordinator.
"It's just that they shower togethr
er. Even Jerry thinks that's gross.";
• Dethroned Leader Michaej
Gorbachev Returns. [May, what
better month to wed communism
and capitalism!) The Beatlesesqui
hoopla just wasn't there this time
as Gorby, stepping full-bodied and
bald-headed into the wild, wacky
world of capitalism, spoke to a$
many Stanford students as he
could fit in one place, plugging his
new autobiography as if he were
completely familiar with the West
ern tradition of late-night televir
sion.
• Carrina Merrick Stalks Guy
Through E-Mail. ( Mid-May)
Techies all around campus invent
strange fantasies that she is follow
ing them, too. They create strange
bulletin boards about such fan
tasies. Ex-Med school guru Gerald
Silverberg considers joining on.
• Queerland Protests Convert
ed-Lesbian Speaker. [C'mon. It
was like two weeks ago) About 800
gay-rights supporters showed up at
a Campus Crusade for Christ
meeting and had a hoot of a time
threatening to give them the
cooties.
"Can't Jesus protect you from
the cooties?" taunted one gay
rights activist.
Well there you have it, the
ugliness exposed for
everyone to see.
Don't fret, kids. Just think of all
the comedy ahead. A German pres
ident, more budget cuts and two
more years of Keith Rabois. It's
like a Mel Brooks character's
dream come true.
So stick around and stay a while,
take a few less units and learn to
love this place. It's here to stay as
long as we keep paying off that U.S.
News and World Report guy.

Joel Stein's year rivaled the Uni
versity's. His column will be on
summer hiatus, so clip out some
old ones, pace yourself and pre
tend they're repeats.
Wednesday, June 3, 1992

I know what you people want.
You want someone to tell
you what a tough year it was
and what brave little soldiers you
are for getting through it.
Maybe you're expecting cute lit
tle phrases to sum things up, like
"The Year of Great Change" or
"The Year of Instability" or "The
Year People Spent Lots of Money
on What they Could Have Seen for
Free on Saturday Night Live."
Well, I'm not going to give you
the pleasure.
Because you didn't give it to me.
Instead, I'm going to remind
you for one last time that you have
terrible memories and that you,
along with the rest of society, are
going to repeat the same mistakes
over and over again until you're
forced to split up Germany one
final time.
So now, I present to you, with
out sparing any of the gruesome
details or esoteric analogies, the
Year in Review.
• Don Kennedy "Resigns."
(Summer — when no one could
write a humor column about it)
Although D.K.'s resignation has
no connection with the indirect
cost thing, many people, much to
Hume's chagrin, foolishly make
assumptions of causality.
"Actually," said a close adviser
to the president, "he just got tired
of having people yell 'Stop, it's
Hamrdla time' every time he start
ed to speak."
• Stuart Thomas Trial. (,4//
quarter long, like a demented EBF
party) Creative lawyers seize upon
Clarence Thomas/Long-Dong Sil
ver hysteria to create the now infa
mous "big penis" defense. Denny
Green considers adding it to the
play book.
In a creative move of his own,
"Stu" Thomas pays off the Review
and, in a separate yet related deal,
avoids having to play villain for the
entire year by inventing another
clever plan and paying off Keith
Rabois.
• Centennial Celebration.
[About 100 years after we started)
The Doobie Brothers and Jean-
Pierre Rampal put aside their dif
ferences and demand that the
1891 time-capsule thing in the
Inner Quad be opened to deter
mine the cause of Zachary Tay
lor's death. Instead, the campus
receives a frighteningly beautiful
Muzak version of "Jesus is Just
Alright."

• Delt House Burns. (A hot
autumn night) Old, useless Delt
House burns as fraternity brothers
run to collect insurance money.
"Let's just say we have friends
in low places," explains an
unnamed fraternity member.
• Gay Rights Protest Aimed at
Governor. (October, hut before
dressing in Little 80-Peep outfits is
truly acceptable) Students lob
frozen oranges at Pete Wilson, in a
political version of a Big Game
half-time show. Wilson catches an
orange bare-handed and considers
it a political/masculine victory.
• Friday Flicks. [Ask a grad stu
dent) Socially stymied ASSU
members scrap such ideas as "Oil
Wrestling Night" and "Naked
Mechanical Bull Riding Night"
and come up with this radical
plan.
"Between the Tuesday Films,
Flicks and new Classic Flicks,
there is no need to be alone in the
dark anymore," said one ASSU
member.
• Break-in at the Band Shak.
[November) A not-so-intelligent
thief breaks into the band "shak"
and tries to steal stuff. Band folks
get last laugh when thief runs off
with four rats, two moldy keg taps
and several venereal diseases.
• Big Game. [In the heat of
November) We won the Axe, wept
for joy, and then immediately put
it into a glass case next to the bath
rooms and Tresidder Ticket
Office. Cal hotshot Brian Treggs
regrets promise when he receives a
barrage of calls from John-Edward,
cain 111 less than 24 hours later.
• Art for Art's Sake Rally.
[Late, dark November) University
tells angry drama students to do
their first real improvising.
Instead, artistes attack campus
with a day of endless a cappella
renditions of "Brown-Eyed Girl."
• Biddle Announces He Will

a week later) Students scream, do
little dance and suddenly acquire
fond, non-classic rock retro-excite
ment over the '70s. Although busy
hiring a new staff, meeting players
and reacquainting with college
football, Coach Walsh finds time
to do cheesy radio spots for the
Athletics Department.
"What I really love is the peo
ple," he said between "Dream
Weaver" and"In a Gadda Da
Vida."
• Provost James Rosse Quits
for Newspaper Job. [Just the time
when we needed a provost most)
Confused himself as to what a
provost is supposed to do, Rosse
decides to stop the madness and
put an end to his eight-year reign.
• Music Program Made Really
Small. [Julie Andrews' birthday)
As part of the first budget cut, the
arts program was put on the cut
ting board.


"Let's just say, after what we did
to it, it's a soprano now," confided
one budget-cutting insider.
• Keith Rabois Becomes the
Anti-Christ. [Ask Michael Jackson)
Rabois provides entire campus
with opportunity to be PC for a day
at absolutely no extra cost. One
young, forgetful frosh becomes
ostracized by his entire dorm for
failing to write his own angry, anti-
Rabois letter to The Daily.
"I'm a first-year CIV student,"

the freshman told The Daily. "1
know what I have and haven't to
write."
• Bookstore Scam Uncovered.
(Groundhog Day) An in-depth
report by The Daily uncovers that
the Stanford Bookstore is spending
money from expensive textbooks
on a giant fleet of cars. Entire cam
pus feigns surprise. Although trav
eling incognito, senior staff writer
John Wagner is shooed angrily out
of the second-floor "pens" section.
• Defenders of Self-Defense
Class Storm Kennedy's Bastille.

[Mid-February) Accustomed to
such intrusions, the no-longer
pusillanimous president prepared
to face the angry women.
"Uh, hi. Do you have some
thing for me?" he calmly asked.
The protesters immediately
jumped into position, placed their
hands in front of their mouths and
yelled, sending Kennedy back into
an expensive Baccarat vase.
"Ooops," apologized one protester.
"We thought he said, 'I have some
thing for you, baby.'"
"But he was probably thinking

it," said another.
• Big, Scary Tuition Hike
Announced. [End of February)
"Stanford has always been selec
tive," said one official. "And there
are plenty of smart, rich kids out
there."
• Survey Reveals that 60 Per
cent of Students Cheat. [Feb. 13)
A second survey reveals that the
other 40 percent lie.
• Student Gets in Altercation
with Police Officers. (End of Jan
uary, darkest day of the year) At a
particularly wild Kairos party,

Baird Mac Guinneas played
Lawrence Taylor to Captain Raoul
Niemeyer's Bill Parcells and
poured beer on a group of unsus
pecting officer's heads.
"Considering the fact that the
only contact between him and
them was a liquid, they were han
dling him pretty roughly," com
mented one repressed observer in
the next day's Daily.
"It wasn't like these police offi
cers acted like Bob Whitfield.
Mac Guineas was in complete con
trol the whole time," explained a
senior from Simi Valley.
• Kirk Varnedoe Named as
Commencement Speaker. (March
hare) Indirect-cost controversy
takes its toll as the best we can
muster up is a museum curator.
Baffled students are angered by
administration's lame unconvinc
ing argument: "There's no joke
here," a University official said,
"we just like saying the name
'Varnedoe.'"
• Gerhard Casper Named New
President. (March 17) Students
experience scary nightmares about
being woken up late at night and
being forced to march circles in the
Oval. Professor Dement calms
them with large slides showing
students that Casper looks just
like Leslie Nielson.
• Intermission's Short Story
Reaches Climax. (Ooooh, who
can forget) Dominic Nulpart curs
es three times in one sentence. Edi
tors don't notice in supreme act of
modernism.
• Nightline Tries to Bring
Famous People Here. (April 10)
Actually, it was just Pat Buchanan,
ferry Brown and Jesse Jackson, but
we got to get a real close look at
Koppel's "hairline."
• Milburn, Students First Get
50-Yard Line Seats. (The day the
music began to die) No, really. I
swear. Well, I mean, we did speak
to him and we did get the seats. I
never drew any conclusions. You'll
stop whining when you're sitting
10 feet away from Bill's crotch. I
know I will.
• Fake Edit Endorses I Prefer
Not to Have a COP. (Deep, dark
April) Wacky pranksters using the
Review's business phone stop the
presses and insert their own edito
rial. Daily puts up large, colorful,
Old West-like posters threatening
to perform Inquisition-like torture
upon anyone with information.
Everyone forgets about it the next
day. Except me.
• I Prefer Not Wins. (The day
that will live in infamy) Students
everywhere begin to prefer not to
do homework, prefer not to pay
their tuition bills and prefer not to
use urinals. I prefer to make vague
ly threatening calls to Ed Mun's
mother.
• Students View Their Records.
(One crazy week) Several deflated
students hear the first pseudo-nega
tive comments of their lives, discov

er Dean lean wasn't the innocent
goddess they had created and decide
to throw themselves Fawn Hall
style into the shredder. Dean Mon
toya laughs ironically.
• Rodney King Protests [Right
after the verdict) Black and non
black students join hands, wear
black, try to figure out what
MEChA has to do with any of this
and block traffic on a small street
in Palo Alto.
"If we can come together to take
over Ramona Avenue, just imag
ine what we could do to Emerson,"
said an overzealous protester who
once had trouble returning a gift to
Copeland Sports.
• Jerry Brown to Come to Terra.
( Early May) At the last minute
Brown decides to hold his fund-rais
er at a local church instead.
"It's not that it's raunchy,"
explained a Brown coordinator.
"It's just that they shower togethr
er. Even Jerry thinks that's gross.";
• Dethroned Leader Michaej
Gorbachev Returns. [May, what
better month to wed communism
and capitalism!) The Beatlesesqui
hoopla just wasn't there this time
as Gorby, stepping full-bodied and
bald-headed into the wild, wacky
world of capitalism, spoke to a$
many Stanford students as he
could fit in one place, plugging his
new autobiography as if he were
completely familiar with the West
ern tradition of late-night televir
sion.
• Carrina Merrick Stalks Guy
Through E-Mail. ( Mid-May)
Techies all around campus invent
strange fantasies that she is follow
ing them, too. They create strange
bulletin boards about such fan
tasies. Ex-Med school guru Gerald
Silverberg considers joining on.
• Queerland Protests Convert
ed-Lesbian Speaker. [C'mon. It
was like two weeks ago) About 800
gay-rights supporters showed up at
a Campus Crusade for Christ
meeting and had a hoot of a time
threatening to give them the
cooties.
"Can't Jesus protect you from
the cooties?" taunted one gay
rights activist.
Well there you have it, the
ugliness exposed for
everyone to see.
Don't fret, kids. Just think of all
the comedy ahead. A German pres
ident, more budget cuts and two
more years of Keith Rabois. It's
like a Mel Brooks character's
dream come true.
So stick around and stay a while,
take a few less units and learn to
love this place. It's here to stay as
long as we keep paying off that U.S.
News and World Report guy.

Joel Stein's year rivaled the Uni
versity's. His column will be on
summer hiatus, so clip out some
old ones, pace yourself and pre
tend they're repeats.
