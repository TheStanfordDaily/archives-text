## THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY The
						Year in Review 
### Joel Stein 
Wednesday, June 3, 1992

I know what you people want.
You want someone to tell
you what a tough year it was
and what brave little soldiers you
are for getting through it.
Maybe you're expecting cute lit
tle phrases to sum things up, like
"The Year of Great Change" or
"The Year of Instability" or "The
Year People Spent Lots of Money
on What they Could Have Seen for
Free on Saturday Night Live."
Well, I'm not going to give you
the pleasure.
Because you didn't give it to me.
Instead, I'm going to remind
you for one last time that you have
terrible memories and that you,
along with the rest of society, are
going to repeat the same mistakes
over and over again until you're
forced to split up Germany one
final time.
So now, I present to you, with
out sparing any of the gruesome
details or esoteric analogies, the
Year in Review.
• Don Kennedy "Resigns."
(Summer — when no one could
write a humor column about it)
Although D.K.'s resignation has
no connection with the indirect
cost thing, many people, much to
Hume's chagrin, foolishly make
assumptions of causality.
"Actually," said a close adviser
to the president, "he just got tired
of having people yell 'Stop, it's
Hamrdla time' every time he start
ed to speak."
• Stuart Thomas Trial. (,4//
quarter long, like a demented EBF
party) Creative lawyers seize upon
Clarence Thomas/Long-Dong Sil
ver hysteria to create the now infa
mous "big penis" defense. Denny
Green considers adding it to the
play book.
In a creative move of his own,
"Stu" Thomas pays off the Review
and, in a separate yet related deal,
avoids having to play villain for the
entire year by inventing another
clever plan and paying off Keith
Rabois.
• Centennial Celebration.
[About 100 years after we started)
The Doobie Brothers and Jean-
Pierre Rampal put aside their dif
ferences and demand that the
1891 time-capsule thing in the
Inner Quad be opened to deter
mine the cause of Zachary Tay
lor's death. Instead, the campus
receives a frighteningly beautiful
Muzak version of "Jesus is Just
Alright."

• Delt House Burns. (A hot
autumn night) Old, useless Delt
House burns as fraternity brothers
run to collect insurance money.
"Let's just say we have friends
in low places," explains an
unnamed fraternity member.
• Gay Rights Protest Aimed at
Governor. (October, hut before
dressing in Little 80-Peep outfits is
truly acceptable) Students lob
frozen oranges at Pete Wilson, in a
political version of a Big Game
half-time show. Wilson catches an
orange bare-handed and considers
it a political/masculine victory.
• Friday Flicks. [Ask a grad stu
dent) Socially stymied ASSU
members scrap such ideas as "Oil
Wrestling Night" and "Naked
Mechanical Bull Riding Night"
and come up with this radical
plan.
"Between the Tuesday Films,
Flicks and new Classic Flicks,
there is no need to be alone in the
dark anymore," said one ASSU
member.
• Break-in at the Band Shak.
[November) A not-so-intelligent
thief breaks into the band "shak"
and tries to steal stuff. Band folks
get last laugh when thief runs off
with four rats, two moldy keg taps
and several venereal diseases.
• Big Game. [In the heat of
November) We won the Axe, wept
for joy, and then immediately put
it into a glass case next to the bath
rooms and Tresidder Ticket
Office. Cal hotshot Brian Treggs
regrets promise when he receives a
barrage of calls from John-Edward,
cain 111 less than 24 hours later.
• Art for Art's Sake Rally.
[Late, dark November) University
tells angry drama students to do
their first real improvising.
Instead, artistes attack campus
with a day of endless a cappella
renditions of "Brown-Eyed Girl."
• Biddle Announces He Will
Leave to Run for Office. [The
part of December when you 're still
wearing T-shirts even though it
makes your nipples hard) Bringing
his own brand of phlegm-infested
realism into the world of politics,
Paul Biddle runs on the "Save
money — put K-12 in one big
classroom" campaign. Benno
Schmidt considers taking role of
campaign organizer.
• Benny Sandoval Chooses
Bowling Green State's Mary
Edmonds as Vice President for
Student Resources. [Very begin
ning of what deceptively looked

like a decent year) Lame duck
Kennedy is visibly shaken over
Sandoval's willingness to disclose
information to The Daily.
"Secrets are secrets, and Don
feels a little hurt," said a close
adviser. "It's sad, but I guess the
whole 'cross your heart hope to die'
thing just doesn't mean anything
anymore."
• Three Stanford Rhodes
Scholars named. [December, right
near Kwanzaa) Cory Booker, excit
ed about receiving the prestigious
award, was sure that it, along with
his other sundry accomplish
ments, would help land him one of
them Daily columns.
• 300-lb. Cyst Removed from
Otherwise Svelte Woman.
[December, the day it finally
rained) Entire campus gets big,
ugly rug pulled over its eyes by
practical joke. Food service, how
ever, plays an even bigger one.
• Soto returns. (Mid-January)
Giving a sick twist to the classic
Lassie plot, six young men, calling
themselves Daryl and wearing
Groucho glasses, returned a large
cement dog to its rightful home.
Soto residents cried. The cement
dog didn't.
• Denny Green leaves. ( Jan.
10, 1 p.m. — 3 p.m. in Minneapo
lis) After big Aloha Bowl loss,
Green, disgusted by 300-lb. men
crying in 200 degree heat, decides
to head off to more temperate cli
mates.
• Bill Walsh returns. [Less than
a week later) Students scream, do
little dance and suddenly acquire
fond, non-classic rock retro-excite
ment over the '70s. Although busy
hiring a new staff, meeting players
and reacquainting with college
football, Coach Walsh finds time
to do cheesy radio spots for the
Athletics Department.
"What I really love is the peo
ple," he said between "Dream
Weaver" and"In a Gadda Da
Vida."
• Provost James Rosse Quits
for Newspaper Job. [Just the time
when we needed a provost most)
Confused himself as to what a
provost is supposed to do, Rosse
decides to stop the madness and
put an end to his eight-year reign.
• Music Program Made Really
Small. [Julie Andrews' birthday)
As part of the first budget cut, the
arts program was put on the cut
ting board.
