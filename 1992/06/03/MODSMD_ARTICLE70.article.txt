## 'Xodus' marks X Clan's vainglorious return 
### Cheo H. Coker Staff writer 
Young L. Robert Carson was unwillingly
dragged to another community meeting by his
father. Sonny Carson, a political activist, had
more plans for his son than allowing him to
spend an afternoon playing baseball in the
street; he wanted the youngster to come into
contact with the most important leaders of the
black revolution, including the chairman of the
meeting that evening.
When confronted with the leader, the boy
invariably asked what any child might in simi
lar circumstances: "Daddy, why does that black
man have those spots [ freckles J on his face?"
But the spokesman's presence ended up
making a lasting impression on the youngster's
life. While Malcolm X, the "freckled revolution
ary" in question, had his life cut short by an
assassin's bullets, many aspects of his self
empowering message have been preserved and
perpetuated in the music of the kid who
remembers spilling ice cream on his suit.
Carson, more widely recognized by the Hip-
Hop Nation as Professor X, is the leader of X
Clan, a black nationalist rap group from the
Crown Heights area of Brooklyn. Brother J is

the main rapper, while Professor X, from the
side, adds his unique form of commentary, all
backed up by the foundation of D.J. Paradise's
rhythm tracks.
With their debut release "To The East
Blackwards," the group made a giant splash on
the hip-hop world two years ago with its combi
nation of Parliament-Funkadelic samples, deft
rapping and black nationalist themes. The
"vainglorious" symbolism of the group's
iconography, from Egyptian Ankhs and wooden
staffs to the "Pink Caddy" and the Cosmic Ark,
is familiar to hip-hop fans all over the world.
The group's latest effort is "Xodus: The New
Testament." More than two years in the mak
ing, the new release is virtually devoid of the
heavy P-Funk influence that characterized the
production of the first LP. Instead, it samples
from other sources as a means to demonstrate
the band's musical growth.
"P-Funk was an influence in the beginning,
and it continues to be one," Professor X said
during a recent conversation. "We try to chan
nel the vibe of the funk, but its obvious that
everybody's just going after [the sound of) P
funk, and we didn't want to ride that same
boat."
With over 11 thumpin' tracks, the new

release, for the most part, upholds the legacy
left by the first release. Brother J, as expected,
catches vocal wreck with ease, featuring enough
innovative changes in rhyme cadence to keep
the listeners on their toes.
Professor X even jumps into the fray, depart
ing from his role as commentator to throw in a
clever rhyme in "Cosmic Ark."
While the best tracks on the album, "Fire
And Earth," "Ooh Baby" and "Verbal Papp" use
more obscure (i.e., unused) samples, some fans
might be miffed by the way the group has seem
ingly "recycles" beats that have already been
established by other artists.
"A.DA.M.," "XODUS," "F.T.P." and "Holy
Rum Swig," despite the fact that they slam on
their own merits, jack beats from Heavy D, D-
Nice, Special Ed, Terminator X, and BDP. Pro
fessor X, however, defends the album from crit
icism ataut originality.
"I've been hearing comments [about it)
already," he said. "But this album was two
years in the making. Before a few of those other
albums came out, we had used those beats pre
viously."
"We believe that some beats can be used dif-
