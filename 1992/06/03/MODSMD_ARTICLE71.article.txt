# Doc Severinsen ventures into Las Vegas-style classical music
## 
### Russell Hancock Staff writer 
If you're like most people,
you're having serious Johnny Car
son withdrawal symptoms right
now, and it's not just because of
Jay's garish purple set, or the
manic quality of his monologue.
No, you're missing Doc Sev
erinsen squealing away on those
high notes with his big band.
Marsalis' tuneless jazz just doesn't
compare to the blazing alloy we
used to take for granted on late
nights.
Fortunately, help is available.
Telarc has released a recording of
the Doctor playing with Erich Kun
zel and the Cincinnati Pops, and
you can have your squeals at bed
time just like you used to.
Only this is the Doc with a
twist: he's playing classical tunes.
And why not? He's eminently
qualified. He had a symphony
career going before he landed a
chance club date with Skitch Hen
derson and"The Tonight Show"

band in 1962.
Turns out Skitch's gig was good
for 30 years, but avid "Tonight
Show" viewers know that Severin
sen took almost as much time off
as Johnny himself during the
show's run (why else would they
let Newsome's dour face cross the
screen?}. Why? Because he was
traveling the country as featured
soloist in "pops" concerts.
Telarc managed to catch up
with him, and the recorded out
come will help us get past our late
night privation. This recording
does nothing to diminish his sta
tus as one of America's finest liv
ing trumpeters. And fans who fear
they won't like Doc playing serious
music needn't worry: this isn't
really serious music. This is a
snappy, humorous and flashy set
of variations on some well-known
classics.
In fact, if Doc were to be criti
cized, it will be because the
arrangements have that unmistak
able Las Vegas stamp to them.
We're talking about the Dis

neyesque pretty music. Purists
won't want to have anything to do
with the nervy arrangement of
Bach's "Chaconne"; they will hate
the flamboyant, extraneous intro
ductions to Rimsky-Korsakov's
"Flight of the Bumblebee."
But if pyro-fiddler Heifitz could
turn "Bumblebee" into a tour de
force for the violin, why not allow
the good Doctor the same privi
lege? His high notes are never
short of spectacular, and the dizzy
ing speed of the sixteenth notes
reveal his astonishing facility in a
way we never got to hear on John
ny.
Here's what else we never
heard: his low range, and his
pianissimos. Both are in abun
dance on Schuman's "Traumerei"
or Bach's "Jesu Joy of Man's Desir
ing," executed with extreme legato,
a clear sense of phrasing, and a
gentle, caressing touch that
approaches vibrato.
The warm, rich tone can be
breathtaking, and in hearing it we
come to understand that Severin

sen is surely more than the wacky,
flamboyant dresser on Carson. We
won't call him sensitive, because
he's got his reputation to worry
about. Let's just say the man's got
depth, and hope this doesn't get
back to the guys in the band.
Telarc cares a lot about digital
processing. Their engineers go to
remarkable lenghts to utilize the
latest and best technology, to place
the bell of the trumpet at precisely
optimal distances from the mikes,
to give us delicate highs and beefy
bass. Nothing here is objection
able.
Likewise, Kunzel and the
Cincinnatis provide excellent
back-up, solidifying their stature
as the only logical alternative to
the Boston Pops.
The upshot is a spirited, pleas
ant excursion into the lighter vein
of serious music, with tantalizing
occasional asides into jazz and
blues. We will rarely see the full
range of the trumpet exploited as
we do here, at the hands of the
master, the Doctor.


Although his
time on "The
Tonight Show"
is done, Doc
Severinsen's
music can still
be appreciat
ed on his new
release.
