# Hearts Cafe's 'cucina creativa' is California dining at its best
##

California, as we all know, has made
•many important contributions to world
culture, but one of the coolest tilings to
come out of California is a bunch of cre
ative ideas about food. "California cui
sine" is characteristically light and loaded
with the fresh vegetables that grow abun
dantly here.
Hearts Cafe, down on California Avenue,
specializes in a sort of Italian-Califomian
fusion. "Cucina creativa," they call it.

Hearts is a spacious, well-lit cheery
restaurant, with an atmosphere as light as
the food they serve. Tables arc spread out
through a large dining room, and I can't
imagine it ever getting too loud and rau
cous, even with a lot of people there. Ser
vice is prompt but mellow. Very laid-back
and comfortable.
Also, bread is fresh and served with vir
gin olive oil instead of butter. Nice.
The menu lives up to its "creative"
billing. A couple of unique appetizers and
salads grace the antipasti section. They
make a salad with grilled scallops and

mozzarella that isn't bad, and there is also
an interesting grilled eggplant appetizer, if
you're into that.
There are about 15 pasta dishes on the
menu, and every single one looked really
good. We tried o. *e with smoked artichoke
hearts and grilled (not. smoked) salmon in
an olive oil and basil sauce. It was good,
but the salmon was just a little bit diy.
The cavatelli cacciatore — pasta in a red
wine, tomato and light olive oil sauce with
chicken — sounds very promising.
Anyway, all the pasta dishes are
between $10 and $12, which is good —

that way you can pick whichever one is
most appealing without worrying too
much about prices.
One thing Hearts does exceptionally
well is seafood. They only have one fish
entree per day, but it can always be relied
upon to be fresh (they are picky about buy
ing their fish). Last Saturday night, the fish
112 the day was grilled swordfish in a light
i ion mustard sauce, and it was excellent.
The swordfish steak was thin, delicate
and not overcooked. Also, it was pretty
big, and came with a pile of asparagus, so I
was not left hungry, which often happens

with seafood dishes. Also, $11.75 is a lot
less than you could expect ..to pay foj
swordfish at most places.
If you are up lor dessert,
ry crisp with a glomph of ice cream on top
is a good call.
Hearts is not a restaurant where every
thing on the menu is perfect. But for
extremely good, very reasonably priced
seafood and some creative pasta ideas, it
would be tough to beat.
