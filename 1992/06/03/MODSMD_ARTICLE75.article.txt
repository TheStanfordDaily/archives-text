## New a cappella CDs a varied bunch, but uniformly enjoyable

With summer almost here, you'll soon
be facing three months without Lake Lag,
Flicks, Wilbur food service — and, of
course, your favorites cappella groups.

But while you can't send a truck over to
your house with a batch of warmed-over
walnut loaf, you can take home one or all
of the new releases from the Mendicants,
Talisman or Mixed Company.
And, to get you in the mood to hear the
sounds of Stanford all summer long, here's
a look at each of the albums.

"Feline Casanova"
Don't let the slinky-sounding title fool
you — this is the "feel-good" album of the
summer.
With their spiffy white baseball jer
seys and marked lack of facial hair, the
Mendicants look like the kind of boys
your parents always wished you'd bring

home. And, as their latest album shows,
they even sound like it.
While their performances are fun and
visual, they create a different kind of per
formance in their recordings — one that
allows them to develop their characteris
tic sound and quality.
Their barbershop sound is as clean-cut
as they look in performance. Their songs
basically fall into two categories — their
fast, upbeat tracks and their sentimental
ballads that make you want to curl up in
a ball on a rainy day and think of your
first crush in junior high.
For example, their dreamy rendition
of "Fallen" is so romantic, you can almost
picture them serenading beneath some
lucky gal's balcony.
This slower style is contrasted by their
more upbeat songs. "Runaround Sue"
reflects the enthusiasm and pep of a bar
bershop quartet.
And no Mendicants album would be
complete without their trademark song
"Brown-Eyed Girl." This live version,
recorded at their Mardi Gras concert last
quarter, beats the canned jukebox ver
sion (oh-so familiar to the CoHo crowd)
any day.
The Mendicants are so all-American
that they close "Feline Casanova" with
an impressive rendition of "The Star-
Spangled Banner" — an infamous chal
lenge for vocalists — that makes our
national anthem sound like a piece of
cake. Or is that apple pie?
However, while "Jungle Love" is a
favorite in live performance, the electron
ic effects and the added drum track of the
recorded version make it a contrived and
uncomfortable cross between pop and a
cappella.
But hey, let the boys experiment. Oth
erwise, they've got an all-American gem
of an album.
"No Murmur, No Zealots"
The sleeve of the album explains that
the title is supposed to embody the chal
lenge a new group faces in attracting fol
lowers. Without eliciting a response —
"murmurs" — there will be no interest —
"zealots."
Talisman has successfully met this
challenge by carving its niche in the

realm of Stanford a cappella. The group
follows its bold vision of exploring a vari
ety of cultural and religious influences.
Listening to this album could satisfy
the non-western distribution require
ment, with pieces sung in Zulu, Swahili,
Spanish and Tagalog, a Filipino dialect.
Much of the album's success stems
from the fact that the original songs were
meant to have a vocal emphasis with sec
ondary instrumentation. Without the
burden of having to imitate background
instruments, Talisman members let their
vocal abilities shine through.

With their spiffy white
baseball jerseys and marked
lack of facial hair, the Men
dicants look like the kind
of boys your parents always
wished you'd bring home.

The added conga drum gives backbone
and earthy feeling to their vocals without
overpowering them.
Director and founder Joe Pigato
describes Talisman's songs as "music
with meaning to it," whether it be cultur
al, political or religious.
Even the listener who doesn't know
that "By the Rivers of Babylon" details
the political injustices of Jamaica can
detect the sincerity and depth reflected in
the group's music.
Because of this emphasis on sound,
Talisman translates beautifully into an
audio recording. For example, the haunt
ing, soulful beauty of "Keep Your
Lamps" will remain with the listener
long after hearing it.
Because they concentrate on singing
instead of the gesticulations, movements
and skits of other groups, nothing is lost
going from live performance to CD. What
you hear is what they are.
"Unanimous" fun
"Dip, potato chip, potato dip ..."

Mixed Company performs their characteristic blend of a cappella and comedy during Orientation last year.
Goofy and fun are the trade
marks of Mixed Company's ener
getic style.
However, flashes of humor like the
"potato chip" scat in "All Blues" are
like those "you had to be there" jokes.
"Unanimous" offers some strong
tracks that reflect the incredible

energy of the group, like the adven
turous "Up on the Roof/ On Broad
way" and the stirring "Blackbird."
Nevertheless, the impact is lost
without the facial expressions and
choreographed moves integral to
their overall style.
"Unanimous" makes it clear
that Mixed Company has very tal
ented soloists, but the heavy back
ground harmonies don't do the
solos justice. The overly-enunciat
ed scats create a dominating, grat

ing machine-gun effect.
"In Your Eyes" and"And She
Was" are examples of strong solos
that are drowned out by too many
"ba-bas" and "doo-wops."
On the other hand, "Mad
About You" is an example of a
background that compliments a
strong soloist. But the most
impressive quality of this song is
that it captures the spirit of the
original Sting version without
imitating it too directly.
