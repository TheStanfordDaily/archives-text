## Making their voices heard Talisman, Balladeers bring unique sound to the a cappella arena 
### Travis Farr Staff writer 
A cappella may not be new to Stanford, but the
craze for the musical form has led to the creation of
two groups in the past few years that are definitely
something new. Talisman and the Stanford A Cap
pella Traveling Balladeers, with their unique styles
and music choices, are new twists on the old form.
Talisman was founded two and a half years ago by
then-sophomore Joe Pigato to fill a gap in the Stanford
a cappella scene. Pigato's goal was to create a group
whose performance style was somewhere between the
entertainment emphasis of most Stanford a cappella
groups and the musical seriousness of a chorale.
In addition to the more serious nature of the
group's music, Talisman stood out because of their
selections — they have concentrated from the begin
ning on spirituals, international music, and jazz as
well as pop songs. The group's music also has a heavy
African-American influence.
Pigato characterizes Talisman as generally less
aggressive than other groups. He says the group is not as
ambitious financially as some of the others, nor are they
as careful to get a lot of high-profile public appearances.
Despite that fact, Talisman is beginning to boom.
Their spring show, with guests including a gospel
choir from East Palo Alto, packed Kresge Auditorium.
They have also begun to do more and more frequent
shows for University President Donald Kennedy,
Pigato said.

Talisman recently produced their first compact
disc. Sales have been surprisingly good so far — of the
1,500 delivered three weeks ago, 800 have already
been sold, both on and off campus. Pigato believes
that Talisman's style may give it a wider appeal than
some of Stanford's other groups, and that this wider

appeal has helped to boost sales in places like Pigato's
native Santa Barbara.
Next year, they may produce a holiday CD, as part
of the group's tradition of seasonal shows. For the
past two years, Talisman has put on a candlelight hol
iday show. The performance is immensely popular,
and it packed the Toyon lounge this year.
Talisman's short history is indeed a success story;
in just two and a half years the group has made the
"big five" a cappella groups on campus into the "big
six." Another campus group, however, is still looking
for its recognition.

Like Talisman, the Balladeers
see their unique music as their
strength and defining characteris
tic. Their whole performance is tied
to the music — the singers wear

capes and take their pitches from a
recorder rather than a pitch pipe.
The members of the group share
an interest both in the early music
they perform and in the period it
comes from. The attraction of the
period is probably related to its
romance; the themes of love and
tragedy pervade the music of the
Bafladeers.
The past two years have been
less spectacular for the Balladeers
than for Talisman. Group mem

bers say that it is generally hard to
attract performers to the group,
and that there is a high rate of
attrition among those that start
out. The Balladeers are rarely
invited to group shows, and are not
generally recognized as one of the
main campus groups.
Despite these problems, the
group has been showing steady, if
slow, progress in achieving its goal
of bringing early music to the Stan
ford community.
