## 'Night on Earth' takes taxi ride into psychological humor 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
Two strangers meet in a cab, briefly
interact, then go about their separate
ways, never to speak again.
Sure it's familiar, but to sit through a
film that examines the above scenario
from five perspectives asks a bit much of
an intelligent audience, right?
Fortunately for Jim Jarmusch, none of
the crowd at the Aquarius theater in Palo
Alto looked intimidated into sitting
through "Night On Earth." In fact, hyster
ical laughter seemed indicative of the audi
ence's approval and satisfaction with Jar
musch's screenplay and direction.
In the style of "New York Stories,"
"Night On Earth" acts as a peephole into
the lives of five taxi cab drivers in Los
Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome and
Helsinki. Jarmusch presents each driver
when he or she is most vulnerable, often
rendering them extremely accessible to
their customers and the audience as well.
This position, though compromising, is

instrumental in providing a temporary
tunnel into the psyche of the driver as well
as his or her customers, just long enough
for audiences to analyze the nature of each
character, if for no other reason than to
laugh themselves sick.

The Los Angeles seg
ment featuring Winona
Ryder and Gena Row
lands falters the most.

This process is made possible by Jar
musch's clever synthesis of dialogue and
film technique, as well as the charisma
generated by the entire cast.
The Los Angeles segment featuring
Winona Ryder and Gena Rowlands falters
the most. After several desperate attempts

at humor, it crashes miserably, due main
ly to the women's inability to strike a mid
dle ground during their ride from the air
port to Beverly Hills.
Rowlands, the high-maintainence cast
ing agent, lacks ability to communicate on
a personal level with Ryder, the tomboy
auto mechanic, making the skit little more
than an escapade into vagueness.
On the other hand, the New York
sequence starring Armin Mueller-Stahl,
Giancarlo Esposito, and Rosie Perez suf
fers from comic overload.
Whereas the Los Angeles sequence
focused too heavily on the cab ride, the
New York sequence seems intent on bang
ing slapstick and tomfoolery over the head
of the audience, perhaps to compensate for
the dryness of its forerunner. Mueller-
Stahl and Perez function more as cartoons
than everyday people.
Fortunately, as the film continues, and
as Jarmusch leaves America for Europe,
"Night on Earth" takes a turn for the bet
ter.
The Paris segment, starring Beatrice

Dalle and Isaach De Bankole, shines as
the most convincing amalgamation of
comic wit and matter-of-fact narration.
Bankole, a cab driver from the Ivory Coast,
and Dalle, a blind French woman, are suc
cessful largely because of the absence of

cast.

slapstick and stereotype. Jarmusch pre
sents them as average Joes and Joannes
biased by experience, not by his direction.
Roberto Benigni's amazingly charis
matic performance as the Roman taxi
driver functions as a comical tour de force
in the style of the New York skit. Yet the

same laughter solicited by Mueller-Stahl's
and Perez's verbally and physically abusive
performances is collected with an over
whelming finesse by Benigni's cerebral
contortions.
Finally, the Helsinki skit, lacking the
physicality of New York and the intellec
tualism of Rome, is best remembered for
the solid performances of Matti Pellonpaa
and his co-stars. It functions as the most
intentionally serious of all the skits, mak
ing it a refreshing as well as sobering way
to end the film.
Artistically, the greatest asset of "Night
on Earth" is its ensemble cast. They trans
form it from a clever gamble into a truly
enjoyable showcase of talent.
And Jarmusch's use of location shots
crown "Night On Earth" with a neo-realist
edge that serious film students, as well as
audiences out for a good time, will appre
ciate.
Unless you're a big fan of Ryder or Row
lands, skip the first 15 minutes. Then
sneak into the back of the Aquarius and
enjoy the two-hour ride.
