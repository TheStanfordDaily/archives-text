## Huge strives for recognition in the daunting music industry 
### Kiri Zooper Staff writer 
Stanford graduates often have to
choose between playing it safe and going
after what they really want from life.
Marc Geller has chosen door number
two.
Geller, a drummer and guitarist, has
spent the last year preparing to assault
the music industry with his sound. He
calls himself "Huge."
Huge has just recorded a four-song EP
that is being sold at live performances
and is doubling as a demo tape for inde
pendent record labels. In addition, he will
be performing in several San Francisco
clubs over the summer in order to fine
tune his live show.
I recently caught his first local perfor
mance. Huge, on lead vocals and guitar,
is a solid performer who obviously enjoys
playing live. His music — while hinting
at such influences as XTC, the Police,
and Edie Brickell — is fresh and fun, and
his lyrics are very original, reflecting a
quirky, humorous outlook. The guitar
based sound is smooth and enjoyable on
the EP, but has extra energy and dance
ability in a live show.
Chatting with Huge for an hour or so,
I learned a great deal about the disap
pointments, sacrifices, and joys of pursu
ing a such a goal.
Intermission: How did you decide to pur
sue this?
Huge: Actually, what I did in campus
music has very little to do with how I
decided to do this. I always wanted to
play in a band. I've been playing drums
since seventh grade and I've never been
in a rock band — I played in a jazz band.
I got to Stanford my sophomore year
and I didn't have my drums and I really
missed playing. So summer after sopho
more year I got a van ... I drove my
drum set out. That fall I formed Marci

and the Moongods with my friend Robby
who played bass ... we had trials and
tribulations. We sort of ended that band
in the form of the Funkin' Einsteins. I
was playing drums and managing. And
then we sort of reincarnated ourselves to
Virginia Sigh.
Intermission: So what was happening in
your personal music at that point?
Huge: I was writing these sort of ballads
and sorta singing ... no one in the band
liked my voice so I was like 'Oh, okay,
fine — I'll just do this for myself.'
I wasn't really considering going into
[music] and then some people heard my
songs, and they really liked them. And I
thought 'Hey, people like these?'
Then I made this really cheap demo
tape in my living room on a 4-track and
it sounded like hell, and some people
really liked it. Somewhere along the line I
decided that this was something I really
wanted to do.
Intermission: So what's happening with
the band now?
Huge: I've been talking to all kinds of
people . . . anyone I can get my hands on
that has industry experience and connec
tions .. . mostly just to learn about the
industry at this point. So it's sort of the
formative stages.
Basically, my goal in making the
demo tape was that I would be the worst
thing on it. So that if it wasn't good
enough it was because I wasn't good
enough ... I wanted to make sure that it
was me that was being judged.
Intermission: Will you be playing live?
Huge: Yes, we're working on the live
show, because you can network all you
want, but if you have no live show . . .
say you're sitting on the desk of the pres
ident of Sony and he says, "Great, where
are you playing," you need an answer.
So we've been having two or three
practices a week trying to work up these
tunes. By the end of the summer, 1 hope

'Whenever you tell people
your name and they laugh
at you, it keeps you pretty
honest.'

to have played at least one or two of the
original clubs in SF and maybe have
made some more contacts.
Intermission: Tell me more about the
name "Huge."
Huge: The main reason I call myself
Huge is because it's so ridiculous. To me,
Huge reminds me of how daunting the
music industry is, and it is.
It also reminds me and sort of mocks
me simultaneously that huge is what I
want to be ... not just in music but in
my personal life. In many, many ways I
want to be huge, and I think everyone
else does too, even if it's only in a small
way.
It also reminds me that I'm not
[Huge], and not only in music. So it
keeps me honest. 'Cause whenever you
tell people your name and they laugh at
you, it keeps you pretty honest.
Intermission: So how do you feel about
all the work you've done so far? Has it
been worth it?
Huge: Well, you know, I wasn't sure
exactly what I wanted to do with my life,
but I was sure that I wanted people to pay
me to tell them what I thought about the
world.
[Music] seemed like by far the most
fun way to do that. But you can't half do
it. You don't work a forty-hour-a-week
job and do music.
This isn't whether or not I can play
music for the rest of my life, it's whether
or not I can support myself by playing
music. But hey, I can always go back to
my living room.

else does too, even if it's only in a small
way.
It also reminds me that I'm not
[Huge], and not only in music. So it
keeps me honest. 'Cause whenever you
tell people your name and they laugh at
you, it keeps you pretty honest.
Intermission: So how do you feel about
all the work you've done so far? Has it
been worth it?
Huge: Well, you know, I wasn't sure
exactly what I wanted to do with my life,
but I was sure that I wanted people to pay
me to tell them what I thought about the
world.
[Music] seemed like by far the most
fun way to do that. But you can't half do
it. You don't work a forty-hour-a-week
job and do music.
This isn't whether or not I can play
music for the rest of my life, it's whether
or not I can support myself by playing
music. But hey, I can always go back to
my living room.

Stanford graduates often have to
choose between playing it safe and going
after what they really want from life.
Marc Geller has chosen door number
two.
Geller, a drummer and guitarist, has
spent the last year preparing to assault
the music industry with his sound. He
calls himself "Huge."
Huge has just recorded a four-song EP
that is being sold at live performances
and is doubling as a demo tape for inde
pendent record labels. In addition, he will
be performing in several San Francisco
clubs over the summer in order to fine
tune his live show.
I recently caught his first local perfor
mance. Huge, on lead vocals and guitar,
is a solid performer who obviously enjoys
playing live. His music — while hinting
at such influences as XTC, the Police,
and Edie Brickell — is fresh and fun, and
his lyrics are very original, reflecting a
quirky, humorous outlook. The guitar
based sound is smooth and enjoyable on
the EP, but has extra energy and dance
ability in a live show.
Chatting with Huge for an hour or so,
I learned a great deal about the disap
pointments, sacrifices, and joys of pursu
ing a such a goal.
Intermission: How did you decide to pur
sue this?
Huge: Actually, what I did in campus
music has very little to do with how I
decided to do this. I always wanted to
play in a band. I've been playing drums
since seventh grade and I've never been
in a rock band — I played in a jazz band.
I got to Stanford my sophomore year
and I didn't have my drums and I really
missed playing. So summer after sopho
more year I got a van ... I drove my
drum set out. That fall I formed Marci

and the Moongods with my friend Robby
who played bass ... we had trials and
tribulations. We sort of ended that band
in the form of the Funkin' Einsteins. I
was playing drums and managing. And
then we sort of reincarnated ourselves to
Virginia Sigh.
Intermission: So what was happening in
your personal music at that point?
Huge: I was writing these sort of ballads
and sorta singing ... no one in the band
liked my voice so I was like 'Oh, okay,
fine — I'll just do this for myself.'
I wasn't really considering going into
[music] and then some people heard my
songs, and they really liked them. And I
thought 'Hey, people like these?'
Then I made this really cheap demo
tape in my living room on a 4-track and
it sounded like hell, and some people
really liked it. Somewhere along the line I
decided that this was something I really
wanted to do.
Intermission: So what's happening with
the band now?
Huge: I've been talking to all kinds of
people . . . anyone I can get my hands on
that has industry experience and connec
tions .. . mostly just to learn about the
industry at this point. So it's sort of the
formative stages.
Basically, my goal in making the
demo tape was that I would be the worst
thing on it. So that if it wasn't good
enough it was because I wasn't good
enough ... I wanted to make sure that it
was me that was being judged.
Intermission: Will you be playing live?
Huge: Yes, we're working on the live
show, because you can network all you
want, but if you have no live show . . .
say you're sitting on the desk of the pres
ident of Sony and he says, "Great, where
are you playing," you need an answer.
So we've been having two or three
practices a week trying to work up these
tunes. By the end of the summer, 1 hope

'Whenever you tell people
your name and they laugh
at you, it keeps you pretty
honest.'

to have played at least one or two of the
original clubs in SF and maybe have
made some more contacts.
Intermission: Tell me more about the
name "Huge."
Huge: The main reason I call myself
Huge is because it's so ridiculous. To me,
Huge reminds me of how daunting the
music industry is, and it is.
It also reminds me and sort of mocks
me simultaneously that huge is what I
want to be ... not just in music but in
my personal life. In many, many ways I
want to be huge, and I think everyone
else does too, even if it's only in a small
way.
It also reminds me that I'm not
[Huge], and not only in music. So it
keeps me honest. 'Cause whenever you
tell people your name and they laugh at
you, it keeps you pretty honest.

exactly what I wanted to do with my life,

world.
