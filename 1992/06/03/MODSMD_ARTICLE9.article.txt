# ASSU Senate takes a look back at year
## Senators say they had problems hearing student needs, funding campus groups 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
After handing over the reins of student gov
ernment last month, members of the recently
retired ASSU Senate gave themselves high
marks for procedure but cited problems with
keeping in touch with student wishes and
funding campus groups.
Some senators said a problem with the sen
ate was its lack of attention to student con
cerns. "We were too distant with what the
opinion of the student body was in general,"
undergraduate senator Jason Snyder said.
"What probably wasn't there was a dedica
tion on the part of every senator to get in
touch with the student body," said undergrad
uate senator Ron Brown, who will be next
year's senate chair.
Both Brown and Snyder mentioned the
ASSU town meetings as a failed effort to stay
in touch with the students. The program,
coordinated by Snyder, sponsored meetings in
different campus residences where students
could come and talk to senators.
However, few students went to the meetings,
and the program was cancelled. Both Snyder
and Brown said more efforts to stay in contact
with students need to be made in the future.
Deputy Senate Chair Neil Crellin said he
believes the senate spent too much time dis
cussing issues that were not relevant to the
student body. Crellin said he was especially
disappointed with the large amount of time
the senate spent discussing election regula
tions.

'It was a procedurally fair
senate. We ... [decided] to
stick to Robert's Rules of
Order and the bylaws.'

"Debates of this nature are one of the most
ludicrous wastes of senators time I can imag
ine," he said.
"The senate is stili trying to redefine its
role," Crellin added. "It has still not figured
out how to be effective as a student govern
ment."
But Kevin Warsh, the outgoing senate
chair, said he felt the body was "a lot better"
than in the past because all senators had a
chance to express their opinions on issues.
"It was a procedurally fair senate. We were
reinventing the wheel this year, deciding to
stick to Robert's Rules of Order and the [ASSU]
bylaws," Warsh said. "That's a large reason for
why these meetings went on and on."

While many senators cited programs they
personally liked, two actions in particular
seemed to garner the approval of multiple sen
ators: the creation of an wilderness Orienta
tion program and the senate's rejection of a
proposed change in the University's standard
of proof.
Snyder said he thought the best program
approved by the senate was the "First Year
Trips" program which will allow all first-year
undergraduate, graduate and transfer stu
dents to take wilderness or public service trips
during Orientation. Snyder called the pro
gram a "good, solid project that will last for
years."
Many senators also lauded the senate's
rejection of a recommended change in the Uni
versity's judicial standard from "beyond a rea
sonable doubt" to a "clear and convincing evi
dence." In voting down the proposal, made by
the Committee of 15, the senate prevented the
University from adopting the new standard.
"It is the first time in four years that stu
dents have stood up and said 'We disagree
with what you're calling for'," Warsh said.
Graduate senator Peter Thiel said the C-15
vote "was really quite unprecedented. .. . Peo
ple sat back and thought about it and realized
[the proposed change) went too far."
Party politics
One characteristic of this year's senate
seems to have been a diminished — but still
present — role for campus political parties.
Many senators said they believe party politics
played a much smaller role in this year's sen
ate than in years past.
"The party structure that used to exist was
much less strongly felt in this year's senate,"
Crellin said. "There have been specific shifts
in alliances on certain issues . .. there were
votes which were completely undergraduate
versus graduate issues."
For example, Crellin said votes on ASSU
election reform issues tended to be split along
undergraduate/graduate lines.
But Snyder said he felt parties still played a
large role in senate politics, especially on "ide
ological issues" such as the proposed change in
the burden of proof.
Out of the 15 roll-call votes taken by Febru
ary, at least 75 percent of senators voted along
party lines in only six cases. And votes that are
taken by roll call tend to be on hotly contend
ed issues, such as those Snyder characterized
as "ideological" in nature.
Appropriations questions
Some students involved in government said
they felt the senate's greatest problem was a
breakdown in the process used to fund student
groups.
"The senate was probably poorest in its
appropriations of funding," said Council of
Presidents member Beth Morgan. She added
that the appropriations process was "signifi

cantly less organized than last year."
Morgan said this year's appropriations pro
cess moved slowly, forcing some student
groups to wait longer for money this year than
in the past. "It hurts student groups if they
don't get their money on time," she said.
Ruben Garcia, director of the ASSU Publi
cations Board, the group that makes funding
proposals for student publications, said the
appropriations process was more problematic
this year than in the past.

'What... wasn't there was
a dedication on the part of
every senator to get in
touch with the student
body.'
— Ron Brown

The board was "much less a part of the pro
cess" than last year, Garcia said, and "there
was very little solicitation of our opinion" by
the senate.
Garcia said the appropriations committee
had a "conflict of interest problem" that
involved the appropriations committee raising
the board's recommendation for funding for
the Stanford Review. Thiel is one of the
Review's founders.
"The Pub Board felt the Review did not
have the same need for Pub Board money that
other publications do," Garcia said. "It was a
question of the existence of some publications
as opposed to the existence of the Review for
five more issues in the spring."
Thiel, however, said the appropriations
committee was not pursuing any ideological
agenda. "We had a very diverse committee,"
he said. Thiel said that all decisions on appro
priations for specific groups were agreed on by
majority rule in the committee.
Conflict with the publications board may
have been caused by closer scrutiny of board
recommendations taken by this year's com
mittee than previous committees, he said. "We
scrutinized groups far more closely than in the
past. We chose not to rubber stamp things."
The close scrutiny did force the committee
to make judgements on some groups, he said,
but the body was not carrying out a political
program.
"Obviously, when you do this (scrutinize
recommendations more closely), there are
some substantive value judgements involved,"
Thiel said. "The more you do, the more con
troversial this will be."
However, Thiel admited the appropriations
process worked too slowly this year. "There
was a significant problem, in the process level,
as far as getting things done on time," he said.

Out of the 15 roll-call votes taken by Febru
ary, at least 75 percent of senators voted along
party lines in only six cases. And votes that are
taken by roll call tend to be on hotly contend
ed issues, such as those Snyder characterized
as "ideological" in nature.
Appropriations questions
Some students involved in government said
they felt the senate's greatest problem was a
breakdown in the process used to fund student
groups.
"The senate was probably poorest in its
appropriations of funding," said Council of
Presidents member Beth Morgan. She added
that the appropriations process was "signifi

cantly less organized than last year."
Morgan said this year's appropriations pro
cess moved slowly, forcing some student
groups to wait longer for money this year than
in the past. "It hurts student groups if they
don't get their money on time," she said.
Ruben Garcia, director of the ASSU Publi
cations Board, the group that makes funding
proposals for student publications, said the
appropriations process was more problematic
this year than in the past.

a dedication on the part of
every senator to get in
touch with the student
body.'

The board was "much less a part of the pro
cess" than last year, Garcia said, and "there
was very little solicitation of our opinion" by
the senate.
Garcia said the appropriations committee
had a "conflict of interest problem" that
involved the appropriations committee raising
the board's recommendation for funding for
the Stanford Review. Thiel is one of the
Review's founders.
"The Pub Board felt the Review did not
have the same need for Pub Board money that
other publications do," Garcia said. "It was a
question of the existence of some publications
as opposed to the existence of the Review for
five more issues in the spring."
Thiel, however, said the appropriations
committee was not pursuing any ideological
agenda. "We had a very diverse committee,"
he said. Thiel said that all decisions on appro
priations for specific groups were agreed on by
majority rule in the committee.
Conflict with the publications board may
have been caused by closer scrutiny of board
recommendations taken by this year's com
mittee than previous committees, he said. "We
scrutinized groups far more closely than in the
past. We chose not to rubber stamp things."
The close scrutiny did force the committee
to make judgements on some groups, he said,
but the body was not carrying out a political
program.
"Obviously, when you do this (scrutinize
recommendations more closely), there are
some substantive value judgements involved,"
Thiel said. "The more you do, the more con
troversial this will be."
However, Thiel admited the appropriations
process worked too slowly this year. "There
was a significant problem, in the process level,
as far as getting things done on time," he said.
After handing over the reins of student gov
ernment last month, members of the recently
retired ASSU Senate gave themselves high
marks for procedure but cited problems with
keeping in touch with student wishes and
funding campus groups.
Some senators said a problem with the sen
ate was its lack of attention to student con
cerns. "We were too distant with what the
opinion of the student body was in general,"
undergraduate senator Jason Snyder said.
"What probably wasn't there was a dedica
tion on the part of every senator to get in
touch with the student body," said undergrad
uate senator Ron Brown, who will be next
year's senate chair.
Both Brown and Snyder mentioned the
ASSU town meetings as a failed effort to stay
in touch with the students. The program,
coordinated by Snyder, sponsored meetings in
different campus residences where students
could come and talk to senators.
However, few students went to the meetings,
and the program was cancelled. Both Snyder
and Brown said more efforts to stay in contact
with students need to be made in the future.
Deputy Senate Chair Neil Crellin said he
believes the senate spent too much time dis
cussing issues that were not relevant to the
student body. Crellin said he was especially
disappointed with the large amount of time
the senate spent discussing election regula
tions.

'It was a procedurally fair
senate. We ... [decided] to
stick to Robert's Rules of
Order and the bylaws.'
— Kevin Warsh

"Debates of this nature are one of the most
ludicrous wastes of senators time I can imag
ine," he said.
"The senate is stili trying to redefine its
role," Crellin added. "It has still not figured
out how to be effective as a student govern
ment."
But Kevin Warsh, the outgoing senate
chair, said he felt the body was "a lot better"
than in the past because all senators had a
chance to express their opinions on issues.
"It was a procedurally fair senate. We were
reinventing the wheel this year, deciding to
stick to Robert's Rules of Order and the [ASSU]
bylaws," Warsh said. "That's a large reason for
why these meetings went on and on."

While many senators cited programs they
personally liked, two actions in particular
seemed to garner the approval of multiple sen
ators: the creation of an wilderness Orienta
tion program and the senate's rejection of a
proposed change in the University's standard
of proof.
Snyder said he thought the best program
approved by the senate was the "First Year
Trips" program which will allow all first-year
undergraduate, graduate and transfer stu
dents to take wilderness or public service trips
during Orientation. Snyder called the pro
gram a "good, solid project that will last for
years."
Many senators also lauded the senate's
rejection of a recommended change in the Uni
versity's judicial standard from "beyond a rea
sonable doubt" to a "clear and convincing evi
dence." In voting down the proposal, made by
the Committee of 15, the senate prevented the
University from adopting the new standard.
"It is the first time in four years that stu
dents have stood up and said 'We disagree
with what you're calling for'," Warsh said.
Graduate senator Peter Thiel said the C-15
vote "was really quite unprecedented. .. . Peo
ple sat back and thought about it and realized
[the proposed change) went too far."
Party politics
One characteristic of this year's senate
seems to have been a diminished — but still
present — role for campus political parties.
Many senators said they believe party politics
played a much smaller role in this year's sen
ate than in years past.
"The party structure that used to exist was
much less strongly felt in this year's senate,"
Crellin said. "There have been specific shifts
in alliances on certain issues . .. there were
votes which were completely undergraduate
versus graduate issues."
For example, Crellin said votes on ASSU
election reform issues tended to be split along
undergraduate/graduate lines.
But Snyder said he felt parties still played a
large role in senate politics, especially on "ide
ological issues" such as the proposed change in
the burden of proof.
Out of the 15 roll-call votes taken by Febru
ary, at least 75 percent of senators voted along
party lines in only six cases. And votes that are
