In-store delis and take-out sections are fairly common in supermarkets
these days. You can find a roasted chicken, roast beef sandwich, and
macaroni salad just about anywhere.
What you won't find anywhere else but Whole Foods Market, however, is
our innovative, mouth-watering array of gourmet prepared foods, deli
sandwiches, and freshly made salads for lunch or dinner take out.
At Whole Foods Market, we prepare specialty items from our own recipes
every day. We offer delicious prepared foods like chicken adobo casse
role, teriyaki ginger tofu, vegetarian lasagne, and brown rice sushi. Our
salads include southwestern black bean, tortellini with sun dried tomatoes,
Thai black rice, and spicy eggplant, just to name a few.
We like to think of it as "home cooking to go" because it's the kind of food
you'd be proud to prepare and serve for a special meal at home.
