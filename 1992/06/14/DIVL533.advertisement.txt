Perfected on the
Peninsula.
The concept is so uniquely European. A delightful
urban village full of life's little luxuries, tucked in where
Palo Alto, Los Altos and Mountain View meet.
Domizile. A concept born in Europe and imported to
the Peninsula. An idea so timely and sophisticated it has,
in just a matter of weeks, sold out fifty percent in
the first phase and garnered such accolades as
liWZ's Best Residential Condominium.
Domizile is the epitome of a civilized European residence
with a uniformed doorman/concierge,
health spa, pool, and a sculpture gar
den courtyard. The 1- and 2-bedroom
homes are priced from just $170,000.
Special financing packages available.

finest import, call (415) 691-9222.
