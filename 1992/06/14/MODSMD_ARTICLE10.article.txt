# She left dolphins for Stanford
## 
### Sara Skinner Staff writer 
Her freckled shoulders and southern drawl
offer clues to Carol Smith's colorful life before
attending Stanford.
Smith is hardly your typical graduating senior.
At 38, she is nearly twice as old as the students
she will join in the Stadium for Commencement.
While her Stanford classmates were still
watching Saturday morning cartoons and playing
in Little League, she was training dolphins in the
Florida Keys.
The day after she graduated from high school,
Smith said, she took off for Florida. "The world
was a different one than the world now," she said.
In the days of Woodstock and flower children, one
"could not be a teenager without being infected
with the spirit of anti-establishment.
"You could sleep outside in the hammock at
night and not be afraid for your life. There was a
naive sense of trust," she said.
Smith said she doesn't regret her years of wan
dering, which she calls an "experiential education.
It really forced you to confront the world. It
changed me — I was raised a preacher's daughter
with strict regulations and rules."
Smith discovered dolphin training when she
took her grandmother, who was visiting, to an
aquarium on the Gulf of Mexico.

"I fell madly in love with the dolphins from the
first minute," she said, her eyes crinkling into a
smile.
Her grandmother talked to the aquarium
workers and discovered they were looking for
temporary help. "I got a job for the summer and
stayed nine years," she said.
Her 12-hour days began at 6 a.m., helping pre
pare food for the 30 dolphins in the aquarium,
each of which ate 20 pounds of fish a day. She
spent the rest of the day training the dolphins for
shows and emergency procedures in case they
needed medical treatment.
The aquarium changed ownership and began
conducting research on the dolphins. The prima
ry purpose of the research was to prove dolphin
intelligence in order to discourage whaling, since
dolphins are close relatives of whales.
Smith said she worked with the dolphins on
abstract concepts, like "same and different." Train
ers invented a simple syntax language using a sound
device like a "primitive musical instrument," and
taught the dolphins to associate sounds with objects.
The dolphins were then asked to demonstrate basic
reasoning capabilities by following commands.
By accident, the trainers discovered that the
dolphins could even identify human speech. Two
trainers were sitting by the water talking about

flippers and one of the dolphins
started waving at them, she said.
They realized that the dolphins
knew their names and other
often-repeated words.
Smith likens her experience to
an "intense family," of both
humans and dolphins. Each ani
mal has its own personality, she
said. "Some are real shy, some
have a real sly sense of humor,
some are downright giddy, some
have big egos," she said.
She described one dolphin that
liked to dig up garbage from the sea
floor to get a laugh from the train
ers. "Tercy would come up from
the bottom with a pair of old panty
hose draped across her face, or a
size 40 pair of corduroy pants."
After nine years, the 12-hour
days and continuous work with
out vacations eventually became
too much for Smith, she said. "I
just loved [dolphins] so complete
ly. They were my life. You can't
just do them a little bit."
Smith also said she grew uncom
fortable with seeing the animals in

captivity. Even though the dolphins
couldn't be released and survive on
their own after living so long in cap
tivity, Smith said she believes they
"don't belong in tanks jumping
through hoops for humans."
A year after she quit working
with the dolphins, she began tak
ing night classes at a community
college and "got totally addicted to
the experience," Smith said.
"It was just like eating potato
chips," she said. "I was so in love
with being in school."
"I didn't have any burning
career ambitions," she said. "I just
wanted to be taught to think more
clearly ... to find language for
these thoughts and feelings that
needed expression."
Smith attended two colleges,
then transferred to Wellesley. "I
did not fit there at all," she said.
"Wellesley is very patronizing to
older women."
"I didn't want to be reminded
every day . . . that this is an age
ist world," she said. "So I trans
ferred to Stanford."
Stanford is not only sensitive
to sexism and racism, she said,
but age discrimination.
Unlike Wellesley, "here there's
no big deal made out of what part
of the country you come from or
what your age is," she said. "It
was so relaxed I felt like I was on
a vacation in the islands."
Smith, who has also worked as a
manual laborer, was surprised,
however, by the attitude of some
Stanford students toward blue-col
lar workers. "People who haven't
had that chance (to be educated]
are not inferior human beings,"

she said. "If you're fortunate
enough to have this experience, it
shouldn't be used as a bludgeon
against people who haven't."
Smith said she feels "I've got
ten more out of the educational
experience than if I'd gone at 18.
It matters to me so much.
"The last day of class I was real
ly surprised — I got all choked up."
Smith plans to work as a
research assistant in the Univer
sity's Anthropology Department
for the summer, but said it
wouldn't be part of her nature to
plan beyond that. "I just don't
have a clue," she said. "You make
up your life as you go along."

ers. "Tercy would come up from
the bottom with a pair of old panty
hose draped across her face, or a
size 40 pair of corduroy pants."
After nine years, the 12-hour
days and continuous work with
out vacations eventually became
too much for Smith, she said. "I
just loved [dolphins] so complete
ly. They were my life. You can't
just do them a little bit."
Smith also said she grew uncom
fortable with seeing the animals in

captivity. Even though the dolphins
couldn't be released and survive on
their own after living so long in cap
tivity, Smith said she believes they
"don't belong in tanks jumping
through hoops for humans."
A year after she quit working
with the dolphins, she began tak
ing night classes at a community
college and "got totally addicted to
the experience," Smith said.
"It was just like eating potato
chips," she said. "I was so in love
with being in school."
"I didn't have any burning
career ambitions," she said. "I just
wanted to be taught to think more
clearly ... to find language for
these thoughts and feelings that
needed expression."
Smith attended two colleges,
then transferred to Wellesley. "I
did not fit there at all," she said.
"Wellesley is very patronizing to
older women."
"I didn't want to be reminded
every day . . . that this is an age
ist world," she said. "So I trans
ferred to Stanford."
Stanford is not only sensitive
to sexism and racism, she said,
but age discrimination.
Unlike Wellesley, "here there's
no big deal made out of what part
of the country you come from or
what your age is," she said. "It
was so relaxed I felt like I was on
a vacation in the islands."
Smith, who has also worked as a
manual laborer, was surprised,
however, by the attitude of some
Stanford students toward blue-col
lar workers. "People who haven't
had that chance (to be educated]
are not inferior human beings,"

she said. "If you're fortunate
enough to have this experience, it
shouldn't be used as a bludgeon
against people who haven't."
Smith said she feels "I've got
ten more out of the educational
experience than if I'd gone at 18.
It matters to me so much.
"The last day of class I was real
ly surprised — I got all choked up."
Smith plans to work as a
research assistant in the Univer
sity's Anthropology Department
for the summer, but said it
wouldn't be part of her nature to
plan beyond that. "I just don't
have a clue," she said. "You make
up your life as you go along."
Her freckled shoulders and southern drawl
offer clues to Carol Smith's colorful life before
attending Stanford.
Smith is hardly your typical graduating senior.
At 38, she is nearly twice as old as the students
she will join in the Stadium for Commencement.
While her Stanford classmates were still
watching Saturday morning cartoons and playing
in Little League, she was training dolphins in the
Florida Keys.
The day after she graduated from high school,
Smith said, she took off for Florida. "The world
was a different one than the world now," she said.
In the days of Woodstock and flower children, one
"could not be a teenager without being infected
with the spirit of anti-establishment.
"You could sleep outside in the hammock at
night and not be afraid for your life. There was a
naive sense of trust," she said.
Smith said she doesn't regret her years of wan
dering, which she calls an "experiential education.
It really forced you to confront the world. It
changed me — I was raised a preacher's daughter
with strict regulations and rules."
Smith discovered dolphin training when she
took her grandmother, who was visiting, to an
aquarium on the Gulf of Mexico.

"I fell madly in love with the dolphins from the
first minute," she said, her eyes crinkling into a
smile.
Her grandmother talked to the aquarium
workers and discovered they were looking for
temporary help. "I got a job for the summer and
stayed nine years," she said.
Her 12-hour days began at 6 a.m., helping pre
pare food for the 30 dolphins in the aquarium,
each of which ate 20 pounds of fish a day. She
spent the rest of the day training the dolphins for
shows and emergency procedures in case they
needed medical treatment.
The aquarium changed ownership and began
conducting research on the dolphins. The prima
ry purpose of the research was to prove dolphin
intelligence in order to discourage whaling, since
dolphins are close relatives of whales.
Smith said she worked with the dolphins on
abstract concepts, like "same and different." Train
ers invented a simple syntax language using a sound
device like a "primitive musical instrument," and
taught the dolphins to associate sounds with objects.
The dolphins were then asked to demonstrate basic
reasoning capabilities by following commands.
By accident, the trainers discovered that the
dolphins could even identify human speech. Two
trainers were sitting by the water talking about

flippers and one of the dolphins
started waving at them, she said.
They realized that the dolphins
knew their names and other
often-repeated words.
Smith likens her experience to
an "intense family," of both
humans and dolphins. Each ani
mal has its own personality, she
said. "Some are real shy, some
have a real sly sense of humor,
some are downright giddy, some
have big egos," she said.
She described one dolphin that
liked to dig up garbage from the sea
floor to get a laugh from the train
ers. "Tercy would come up from
the bottom with a pair of old panty
hose draped across her face, or a
size 40 pair of corduroy pants."
