# She left dolphins for Stanford

Her freckled shoulders and southern drawl
offer clues to Carol Smith's colorful life before
attending Stanford.
Smith is hardly your typical graduating senior.
At 38, she is nearly twice as old as the students
she will join in the Stadium for Commencement.
While her Stanford classmates were still
watching Saturday morning cartoons and playing
in Little League, she was training dolphins in the
Florida Keys.
The day after she graduated from high school,
Smith said, she took off for Florida. "The world
was a different one than the world now," she said.
In the days of Woodstock and flower children, one
"could not be a teenager without being infected
with the spirit of anti-establishment.
"You could sleep outside in the hammock at
night and not be afraid for your life. There was a
naive sense of trust," she said.
Smith said she doesn't regret her years of wan
dering, which she calls an "experiential education.
It really forced you to confront the world. It
changed me — I was raised a preacher's daughter
with strict regulations and rules."
Smith discovered dolphin training when she
took her grandmother, who was visiting, to an
aquarium on the Gulf of Mexico.

"I fell madly in love with the dolphins from the
first minute," she said, her eyes crinkling into a
smile.
Her grandmother talked to the aquarium
workers and discovered they were looking for
temporary help. "I got a job for the summer and
stayed nine years," she said.
Her 12-hour days began at 6 a.m., helping pre
pare food for the 30 dolphins in the aquarium,
each of which ate 20 pounds of fish a day. She
spent the rest of the day training the dolphins for
shows and emergency procedures in case they
needed medical treatment.
The aquarium changed ownership and began
conducting research on the dolphins. The prima
ry purpose of the research was to prove dolphin
intelligence in order to discourage whaling, since
dolphins are close relatives of whales.
Smith said she worked with the dolphins on
abstract concepts, like "same and different." Train
ers invented a simple syntax language using a sound
device like a "primitive musical instrument," and
taught the dolphins to associate sounds with objects.
The dolphins were then asked to demonstrate basic
reasoning capabilities by following commands.
By accident, the trainers discovered that the
dolphins could even identify human speech. Two
trainers were sitting by the water talking about
