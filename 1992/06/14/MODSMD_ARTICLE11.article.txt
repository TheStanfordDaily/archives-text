# Kennedy's self-assurance was powerful, flawed tool
## The 						style that moved Stanford also stoked cost controversy 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Leading reporters on a tour
of campus to unveil
another of Stanford's
seemingly endless stream
of new buildings during the early
1980s, Donald Kennedy moved
quickly, nearly leaving the string
of reporters behind.
"Then he stopped, turned. . .
and suggested that we pick up the
pace or else we'd get lost," said
Paul Witteman, senior editor of
Time magazine, who was one of
the reporters on the tour.
As university president dur
ing the past 12 years, Donald
Kennedy was a bold, self-confl
dent leader whose direct and open
style was the driving force behind
many of the improvements made
during his tenure.
During his presidency,
Kennedy used his leadership to
push for a number of projects
that made concrete advances in
the '80s, including undergradu
ate education, public service and
a fund-raising campaign that
raised nearly $1.3 billion.
And his personal interaction
with students — by being a fresh
man adviser, by holding inter
views on KZSU, by speaking in
dormitories and teaching classes
— reinforced his image as an
accessible leader.
"He maximizes people through
his own energy," said Albert Has
torf, a professor emeritus in psy
chology who was Kennedy's first
provost. For example, Hastorf
said, "the Humanities Center was
created (in 1980) because
Kennedy thought it was a good
idea and breathed energy into it."
But just as Kennedy's leader
ship style is credited with driving

'The world is full
of institutions
that tend toward
inertia/ but

is 'certain kinds
of leaders to give
the institution a
big shove.'

the successes of his administra
tion, it is also blamed for its fail
ures. Many say that Kennedy's
approach to the indirect-cost con
troversy in its early stages
showed that his self-assurance
can often be interpreted as over
confidence.
"Don is a pretty self-confident
guy," Witteman said. "He was
perceived by some as being too
arrogant."
Although many say a pres
ident has little actual
power in a university —
power comes from the
bottom up, rather than top down
— the role of a president's leader
ship cannot be discounted.
Despite the fact that the presi
dent may be only one individual
within a large and highly complex
institution, his or her leadership

has a measurable influence on
university policy.
Just the mystique of the presi
dential position itself often trans
lates into influence. "I think pres
idents are listened to partly
because they are assumed to have
more power than they really do,"
Kennedy said in an interview.
"That certainly gives them a
power of persuasion."
So when a president makes a
visible commitment to a project
or a policy, that alone can often
generate stronger support for —
or against — an issue.
Kennedy's advocacy of
undergraduate studies,
for example, has been
instrumental in the
development of stronger under
graduate programs during his
presidency.
Last March, Kennedy
announced $7 million in new pro
grams to improve undergraduate
teaching and "increase the reso
nance between teaching and
research."

The programs
— made possible
in large part by a
$5 million gift
from Stanford
trustee Peter
Bing — provide
funds for develop
ing new courses
and cash bonuses
for outstanding

teachers, among other things.
"A visible commitment from
the president (to undergraduate
education) means a lot," said Car
olyn Lougee, who was dean of
undergraduate studies from 1982
until 1987. "Now there are more
honors programs, minority stud
ies and stronger writing pro
grams. It's stronger in general."
Stanford leaned more heavily
toward research before Kennedy
became president, focusing most
of its attention and resources
toward graduate students,
Lougee said.
Kennedy has been praised for
helping shift some of that focus
toward undergraduates.
The most well-known
Kennedy trait was his
personal touch. His jogs
to the Dish, his constant
attendance of athletic events, his
visits to student dorms and his
regular performances with his
wife, Robin, in Gaieties all indi
cated to the Stanford community
that Kennedy was an open presi
dent.
Numerous personal anecdotes
about Kennedy — including one
about him posing in Speedos with
the swim team after it won the
1986 national championship —
demonstrate Kennedy's direct
and personal style of dealing with
students, faculty and staff.
"He has an outgoing, likeable
personality and is willing to have
fun with students," said Political
Science Prof. David Abernethy.
"The shift from the classroom to
the presidency didn't diminish
his touch with students."
Robert Beyers, who was the
director of Stanford News Service
for 28 years, noted that Kennedy
had a "personal knowledge of
what students were saying on a
variety of different issues."
Kennedy said such interaction
is simply a necessary part of
being a university president.
"Part of the presidential role is
to be in the institution and sam

pling what is going on," he said.
"You need to get out to stu
dent residences a lot," he added.
"You need to meet with the facul
ty a lot, in both formal and infor
mal circumstances. You need to
get out on the road and talk to
alumni a lot to find out what is
bothering them. You need to be
somewhat externally directed."
Public service has been one
area where nearly every
one — friends and foes
alike — have given him
credit for solid leadership.
"A series of quite identifiable
things come from his style . . .
The Haas Center was one. It's a
pretty remarkable organization. I
don't know of another university
with something like this," said
Doyle McManus, a Stanford
trustee and Los Angeles Times
reporter.
"He helped push the whole
principle that students ought to
do public service and look at it as
something to do as a career,"
McManus said.
Fund raising is another aspect
of the presidency that depends on
individual leadership style,
because it requires a great deal of
personal contact with donors.
Stanford's five-year Centenni
al Campaign, whose goal was to
raise $1.1 billion, ended up rais
ing $1,269 billion — one of the
most successful fund-raising
drives ever. Many say Kennedy
was a strong fund-raiser, who
used his personality to attract the
big gifts.
"Don is a very persuasive per
son when he wants something,"
said Provost Gerald Lieberman, a
long-time Stanford professor who
was Faculty Senate chair in 1987-
88.
According to Richard Bennett,
associate campaign director,
Kennedy is "mentally very quick
and he can pick up on somebody's
signals when they don't like a

particular idea."
"He's quick to reach back into
his head and say, 'Forget about
that [idea], how about this?' "
The coolness and self
assurance that carried
Kennedy through his
first 12 years as president
did not come through for him
during the worst crisis of his
presidency — in fact, it may have
been what hurt him the most.
As the attention of the media
and the government focused on
Stanford, Kennedy should not
have been so dismissive in his
public statements, many say.
"It's always more effective to
defuse one's critics by being more

Time's Henry Muller spoke to Kennedy privately about
his resignation a few days before his decision. 'I'll
never forget those conversations. I was so impressed by
Don's total self awareness, and his perfect analysis of
the situation of the campus. I have encountered others
in such situations, but it is rare to find others which
such clear perceptions — he was not sorry for himself
or worried about his reputation. He was analytical,
finding what would be the right thing to do. Others
would lose control, and not be that cool or thoughtful.'

self-deprecating," said Witteman,
the Time senior editor. "Had he
been more self-deprecating he
would have defused some of the
venom."
Kennedy acknowledged that
he should not have been so confi
dent at first.
"Early in the process we
should have withheld all judge
ments until we got a really good
external audit of the situation,"
Kennedy said. "I think there were
some early statements that in
retrospect now reflect a little
more confidence than was justi
fied at the time."
Kennedy's response was puz
zling to many, who had long con
sidered Kennedy's media savvy
one of his strong points as presi
dent.
"I was surprised that he was so
ineffective during indirect costs,"
said Economics Prof. Kenneth
Arrow, who was faculty senate
chair in 1986-87. "He waffled too
much and was not very clear
about what he wanted."
Kennedy's usually good per
ception failed him during indirect
costs, Witteman said. "He under
estimated the public response
and reaction to these serious
accusations," Witteman said. "He
probably misunderstood initially
the serious level to which the
media was interested in this
story."
But once he assessed the
fallout of the controver
sy, some said, he
regrouped and took a
strong leadership role in coping
with the $43 million budget
deficit that will be one of the lega
cies of indirect costs. •
Unlike his initial handling of
the controversy, Kennedy's lead
ership in the budget-cutting pro

cess has been generally praised.
"He had a good grasp of the situ
ation and immediately started
budget trimming," Arrow said.
He praised Kennedy for having
"the statesmanship" to start bud
get cuts himself rather than leav
ing the job to incoming Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper.
Kennedy has also been credit
ed for being being more open and
communicative during the whole
budget-cutting process, which —
surprisingly — has not provoked
an outcry from students or facul
ty, as has happened at many
other universities this year.
Trustee George Hume pointed
out that Columbia has also had to
implement budget cuts this year,

but there has been tremendous
faculty-administration tension
there, unlike at Stanford.
Hume, president of Basic
American Foods, Inc., praised
Kennedy for how he has handled
his job since his resignation
announcement. "It was amazing
how much was done, despite the
fact that we had a lame duck
president," Hume said.
Kennedy's announcement
that he would resign last
summer, effective
August 1992, was a
wrenching decision for him that
was institutionally necessary and
showed Kennedy's personal dig
nity, many said.
"There was so much anxiety
and loss of confidence in the
administration overall that some
thing had to give," said Henry
Muller, Time's managing editor
and a member of Stanford's
Board of Trustees. "He was
courageous to resign to defuse
the situation, to allow life to
return to normal. ... The politi
cal gesture had to be made."
Muller said he talked to
Kennedy privately about his res
ignation a few days before his
decision.
"I'll never forget those conver
sations," he said. "I was so
impressed by Don's total self
awareness, and his perfect analy
sis of the situation of the campus.
I have encountered others in such
situations, but it is rare to find
others which such clear percep
tions — he was not sorry for him
self or worried about his reputa
tion. He was analytical, finding
what would be the right thing to
do. Others would lose control,
and not be that cool or thought
ful."
According to Beyers, Kennedy

"lost credibility" and had to
resign — but that was not an end
in itself for Kennedy. "There is
life after Stanford," he said.
And according to English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz — often a
Kennedy critic — the outgoing
president has done "a remarkable
job" overall.
"It's a pity that his presidency
should end this way," Rebholz
said.

Regardless of the indirect
cost controversy and his
subsequent resignation,
Kennedy's reputation is
secure, many said.
If a vote were taken now by the
American Association of Univer

sities to determine the "most
effective" university president,
Kennedy would rank in the top
three, said Michael Hayman,
chancellor of UC-Berkeley from
1980 to 1990 and a former AAU
member.
Indirect costs, at least in how
it affects Kennedy's legacy, "will
disappear," said Emeritus Law
Prof. John Merryman. "That'll
be a blip. In the longer view, he
has been a good president. . ..
The plusses have been a lot more
important than the minuses."
For Hastorf, Donald Kennedy
suited Stanford during the 1980's
just as Wallace Sterling and
Richard Lyman, two other strong
presidents, suited their eras.
Sterling, president from 1949
until 1968, helped define Stan
ford in the early stages of its rise
into national prominence, Has
torf said, while Lyman played an
important role in steadying the
University during the riots of the
late '60s and early '70s.
Lyman, Hastorf said, "was a
bit of a curmudgeon, saying, 'Be
careful, let's think about that,'
and he was a great president who
steadied us during a difficult
time," Hastorf said.
Kennedy, on the other hand,
"was not a curmudgeon at all,
and was always saying 'Let's
go,' " Hastorf said.
Perhaps that dynamism was
just what Stanford needed during
the 1980's. The University had
already risen to a certain level of
prominence, but needed a strong
leader like Kennedy to focus its
energies further.
"The world is full of institu
tions that tend toward inertia,"
McManus said, but what they
need is "certain kinds of leaders
to give the institution a big
shove."
