# Jazz, groove, harmony — thanks to Pigato
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Whether it be jazz polyphony, soulful
groove or pure, lilting harmony, the sound of
Talisman owes its richness and depth to
senior Joe Pigato.
Graduating this week in psychology and
Italian, this Santa Barbara native founded the
co-ed a cape 11a group in the fall of '89.
Talisman sings a wide range of pieces from
traditional gospel songs to African folk songs.
"A lot of stuff is done in foreign languages"
such as Swahili, Spanish and Tagalog, said
Pigato.
"I wanted it to be entirely musical focused,
not mainstream pop," he said, stressing Talis
man's uniqueness among the other five campus
a cape 11a groups. The group promised to "be an
alternative to what most people were doing."
Surprisingly, Pigato does not have years of
musical training — composing and arranging
experience — behind him.
"I had the standard however-many-years in
elementary school on the piano, that's it. I'm a
singer."
Currently, Talisman consists of 18 singers —
divided into tenor, bass, alto and soprano sec
tions — and one congo player. They practice two
or three times a week for two and a half hours

each time and every so often, hold retreats with
four or five hours of intensive singing.
"Everyone is opinionated on musical and
artistic things, but we get very down-to-earth
people," he said of the make-up of Talisman.
"Anytime you get a group of people togeth
er whose focus it is to put together a beautiful
sound, you will get a good group of people."
The commitment to making Talisman suc
cessful definitely took its toll on Pigato. "It's
been a huge amount of work that has taken
away a lot, especially from academics."
To this day, he said he still asks himself
"Am I going to look back and ask, has this
been a proper diversion?"
Yet Pigato claimed he learned more about
business, music and psychology from putting
the group together than he could have gotten
from any of his classes.
"A few grades are definitely lower because
of the group," he admitted. "I wish grad school
would know this."
In spite of the costs, Pigato learned one
valuable lesson. "You find out what you are
good at" as well as your limitations, he said.
"Starting a group like this is like being a
mom," Pigato said. "You create it, you worry
about it night and day, then later you realize
you have to let it go on its own."
But with Pigato's strong direction and

guidance, Talisman is prepared to make that
journey.
Reflecting on whether he achieved his orig
inal goals for the group, Pigato explained that,
at first, he envisioned Talisman packing
Memorial Auditorium which seats about
1,500 people.
"In the end, we packed Kresge [which holds
closer to 500J," he said "You evolve and
become more realistic."
Talisman has attained significant achieve
ments. Currently, they are selling their first
album, "no murmur, no zealots." The album,
which cost close to $10,000 to produce, was
funded by community interest. Talisman sold
numerous tapes before the album was released.
As for the future, Pigato said finding people
at Stanford to maintain Talisman's unique edge
will be the big problem. "I don't want the group
to either lose its diversity within the singers or
the songs — to go mainstream, that is."
Pigato — who now works in Public Affairs
here at Stanford as the head coordinator of
Tour Guides — wavered, then said he would
not do something like this in the future.
"I say no, but I so have it in me," he said.
"After a while, it becomes an addiction."
Although Pigato does not plan a career in
music he admits, "I know myself. Something
will crop up."
