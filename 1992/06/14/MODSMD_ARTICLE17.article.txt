# Surviving four years of fun
## 
### Tracy Goode 
As I sit down to write this article, I am reflecting
on all of the changes that I have witnessed at Stan
ford over the past four years. It seems as though it
were just yesterday that Frenchie Perry greeted me
at Soto with "Hi Tracy!" My immediate response
was "Mom, I want to go home." Against my wishes,
my parents made me stay in this tiny room that I
had to share with someone I had never seen before.
Today, when I think back, I'm glad my parents
made me stay. My freshman year was a blast, char
acterized by going to bed at 5 a.m. and getting up at
9 a.m. so I could go to class and get more sleep. I had
to sleep in class because if I slept in the dorm I might
miss something. There was always something going
on in Soto freshman year.
Like all good things, my year in Soto had to come
to an end. This ending came with much anxiety
caused by this supernatural phenomenon called the
Draw. My draw group of seven had several meetings
to decide what to put on our draw card. We eventu
ally ended up listing Roble first — with a big laugh
because we knew that we would never draw that
well. But we drew 79 and ended up in a dorm that
we knew nothing about. None of us had gone to the
open house because everyone knows once you're in
Wilbur you're there for life.
We broke into Roble several times late at night so
we could pick out rooms for the in-house draw.

Roble was much bigger than Soto and took a lot
of getting used to. We adjusted by having weekly
draw group dinners so we could rank the different
RA's and even talked about wait listing back into
Soto. Eventually, we decided that we would stick it
out and have as much fun as we could in Roble,
including everything from fountain hopping with
my hallway to Jello sliding with Ann and Evan Por
teus to sleeping with 47 people on a ski trip in a
condo made for 10. I had so much fun in Roble that
I decided to stick around a little while longer —
actually two more years, but who's counting?
As I end this column and my Stanford career, I
would like to thank Stanford and all the special
friends I have made here over the years for all the
wonderful memories. I would also like to thank Stan
ford for allowing me to regress back to juvenile behav
ior that would probably not be accepted anywhere
else. Above all, I would like to thank my parents for
encouraging me to stay on that first day of Orienta
tion when all I wanted to do was leave.
Finally, I would like to pay tribute to some Stan
ford Traditions that seem to be leaving us: Fountain
Hopping, The Draw, Jello Sliding, Manzanita Park,
Donald Kennedy, Greg Ricks, the Bookstore's Vaca
tion Home and Western Culture — NOT!

Tracy Goode would like to thank Mom, Dad, Terry,
Aunt Lucinda, Uncle Richard, James, Roble 1C
1990-91, Roble 2b/2-Center 1991-92.
