# On the Rhodes to success
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
When Robert Sternfels got the
big thumbs-down from the Stan
ford-in-Oxford program, he didn't
just lie down and wallow in self-pity.
Instead, he chose to follow a
different path to the prestigious
English university. He applied for
a Rhodes scholarship.
And now Sternfels is among
three Stanford students chosen as
Rhodes Scholars for 1992.
A senior majoring in economics
and history, Sternfels and Cory
Booker, Class of '91, were among
32 Americans chosen for the award
this year. The other Stanford stu
dent, senior Omphemetse Mooki,
was chosen to represent his native
country, South Africa.
The Rhodes scholarship requires
applicants to excel in "academics,
leadership, athletics and the ability to
fight the world's fight," Sternfels said.
Each of the final applicants goes
through three stages of day-long
interviews, during which academic,
personal and ethical questions are
asked by a panel of former scholars.
Sternfels, a water polo player,
started a business with his room
mate during the summer because
he needed to find local employ
ment in order to stay on campus
for workouts. The company, Liti

gation Support Services, hires out
Stanford students to summarize
depositions for local law firms.
Booker, like Sternfels, was a
division-one athlete, playing tight
end for the Stanford football team
during his four years here.
He said he was surprised to dis
cover he was one of the few football
players nominated for the award.
"Football enabled me to get a
Rhodes scholarship. It gave me
the discipline," he said.
Although football took up
much of his time, Booker became
heavily involved in community
service and student government,
earning the J. E. Wallace Sterling
award for public service last year.
Booker, who was a senior class
president, also devoted much of his
time to the Bridge, the campus peer
counseling center, where he spent
last year as a live-in counselor.
"The Bridge has been the back
bone of my college career," he said.
"It gave me an opportunity to find
out things about Stanford that I
otherwise wouldn't have seen."
After finishing a master's in soci
ology this year, Booker will enter an
Oxford master's program in politics,
philosophy and economics in order
to "fill in the one hole in my tran
script — economics."
Booker said he is looking forward
to the international experience the

Rhodes scholarship will afford him.
"I've never been out of the
country .... I really have a very
Americana perspective."
Eventually, Booker, like Stern
fels, hopes to go to law school,
where he said most Rhodes schol
ars end up. Afterward, he intends
to work full time at a public ser
vice organization and then possi
bly work in the government.
"I'm no genius. I'll never claim
to be a genius. The most impor
tant thing I can do with my edu
cation is to apply it. I'll never be a
Nobel laureate physicist. I just
want to take my degree and help
people," Booker said.
Mooki, 23, a senior majoring in
microbiology and immunology,
divides his time between his stud
ies, his lab work and his member
ship in the Stanford Running Club.
After finishing his high-school
equivalency test, Mooki left his
home in Mmabatho, South Africa,
to attend Milton Academy in
Boston for a year through a schol
arship aimed at black South
Africans established by the
preparatory school.
While he was there he complet
ed a research paper about AIDS,
which propelled him into the
research he has conducted for the

ry, anticipates continuing his research in England.
last three years at the Center for
AIDS Research at Stanford.
Of the nine South Africans
chosen to receive the scholarship,
Mooki was the only one to have
studied abroad, he said.
Working with the drug
ofloxacin and the HIV virus in the
laboratory, Mooki has helped
investigate the possible effects of
the yet-untested drug on humans.
Although in direct contact with
the virus, Mooki said fear never
deterred him from his research.
"It never scared me so much
that I'm freaked out by it. I don't
have nightmares or anything," he
said. "There's always an element
of risk in this type of work. I guess
there's an element of risk in just
about everything."
After completing the Human
Biology core, Mooki decided to
major in microbiology and
immunology, a small major that
has since been discontinued.
Mooki said he will use his schol
arship to further study microbiol
ogy, possibly using the grant to get
a doctorate in the subject. After
ward, he said, he will return to
South Africa to teach.
"I feel that it is important for
me personally to return to my
country," he said.

during his four years here.
He said he was surprised to dis
cover he was one of the few football
players nominated for the award.
"Football enabled me to get a
Rhodes scholarship. It gave me
the discipline," he said.
Although football took up
much of his time, Booker became
heavily involved in community
service and student government,
earning the J. E. Wallace Sterling
award for public service last year.
Booker, who was a senior class
president, also devoted much of his
time to the Bridge, the campus peer
counseling center, where he spent
last year as a live-in counselor.
"The Bridge has been the back
bone of my college career," he said.
"It gave me an opportunity to find
out things about Stanford that I
otherwise wouldn't have seen."
After finishing a master's in soci
ology this year, Booker will enter an
Oxford master's program in politics,
philosophy and economics in order
to "fill in the one hole in my tran
script — economics."
Booker said he is looking forward
to the international experience the

Rhodes scholarship will afford him.
"I've never been out of the
country .... I really have a very
Americana perspective."
Eventually, Booker, like Stern
fels, hopes to go to law school,
where he said most Rhodes schol
ars end up. Afterward, he intends
to work full time at a public ser
vice organization and then possi
bly work in the government.
"I'm no genius. I'll never claim
to be a genius. The most impor
tant thing I can do with my edu
cation is to apply it. I'll never be a
Nobel laureate physicist. I just
want to take my degree and help
people," Booker said.
Mooki, 23, a senior majoring in
microbiology and immunology,
divides his time between his stud
ies, his lab work and his member
ship in the Stanford Running Club.
After finishing his high-school
equivalency test, Mooki left his
home in Mmabatho, South Africa,
to attend Milton Academy in
Boston for a year through a schol
arship aimed at black South
Africans established by the
preparatory school.
While he was there he complet
ed a research paper about AIDS,
which propelled him into the
research he has conducted for the

last three years at the Center for
AIDS Research at Stanford.
Of the nine South Africans
chosen to receive the scholarship,
Mooki was the only one to have
studied abroad, he said.
Working with the drug
ofloxacin and the HIV virus in the
laboratory, Mooki has helped
investigate the possible effects of
the yet-untested drug on humans.
Although in direct contact with
the virus, Mooki said fear never
deterred him from his research.
"It never scared me so much
that I'm freaked out by it. I don't
have nightmares or anything," he
said. "There's always an element
of risk in this type of work. I guess
there's an element of risk in just
about everything."
After completing the Human
Biology core, Mooki decided to
major in microbiology and
immunology, a small major that
has since been discontinued.
Mooki said he will use his schol
arship to further study microbiol
ogy, possibly using the grant to get
a doctorate in the subject. After
ward, he said, he will return to
South Africa to teach.
"I feel that it is important for
me personally to return to my
country," he said.
