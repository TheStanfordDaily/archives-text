# Marshall Scholar has healthy future abroad
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Imagine the chance to live in Great
Britain — all expenses paid — for up to
three years. Senior Carlos Lerner will soon
have that opportunity as a recipient of the
Marshall Scholarship.
The national scholarship is awarded
each year to those students who demon
strate intellectual ability and character
through both their academic transcripts
and extracurricular activities.
The goal of the scholarship is to allow
American students to experience England's
culture and education system while at the

same time allowing them to contribute to
life at British universities. Forty students
received the scholarship this year.
Lerner earned the award through his
work as a public policy major and his
extracurricular activities, including playing
trumpet in the Stanford Band and being a
resident assistant in Mirlo. Lerner also
serves as coordinator of Stanford volun
teers for a day-care program in East Palo
Alto.
An open and friendly person, Lerner
said he considers his RA job to be invalu
able, adding that he has always considered
his dorm "a center of social and intellectu
al activity."

Although he intends to study medicine
and become a pediatrician, Lerner said he
first hopes to complete his master's degree in
health economics at the University of York.
Lerner said his overriding goal is to learn
enough to "find some way to help change the
American health system." A degree in
health economics would be useful, he added,
because of its interdisciplinary nature, com
bining medicine, economics and statistics.
Currently, the most serious problem for
the health community is the "lack of a sys
tem," Lerner said. "We are spending more
money (on health care) than any other
country in the world, yet we still have 37
million people without health insurance

and limited access to health care," he said.
Lerner said he does not see a solution to
the health-care crisis in the near future. "
He said he believes most segments of the
population would benefit from a change in
the health care system, because the poor
would get health services and the middle
class would have to bear less of the costs.
Given the power to change anything about
the U.S. health care system, Lerner said he
"would find some way so everyone has access
to medical care," including creating equal
incentives to treat all the ill.
Lerner said he views his time in Great
Britain as a chance to "gain personally and
academically."
