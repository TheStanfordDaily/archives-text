# Lag fulfills catalog promises
## Class of '92 finally frolics in first full lake in four years 
### Kathleen Mallery

claimed a definitive victory over
mud volleyball last Saturday, the
blissful beginning of another
sunny weekend at Lake Lagunita.
Boats, people, dogs and even
tadpoles have found their niche at
the lake since the Lake Commis
sion decided in March to fill it
with runoff from a reservoir in
the foothills.
If there had been less rain and
the Lake Commission had decided
otherwise, this year's seniors
could have graduated without
ever having a real lake. Lag hasn't
been open since 1988.
The catalog pictures of dorms
encircling a campus lake filled
with windsurfers, rubber rafts,
swimmers and sail boats that
lured undecided prospective
freshmen away from red brick

and ivy walls would have lied.
And when the boat house was
torn down several years ago,
traces of the lake's boating and
windsurfing days could only be
found in memories — it seemed
University officials had decided
the drought would never end.

'It has never been
filled in my entire
career here.'
— James Reichmuth

Then it began to rain. Maybe it
wasn't quite forty days and forty
nights. But it was long enough for
rumors to pour through the cam
pus — "Maybe they'll fill the
lake."
And then, with more rain —

"They're going to fill the lake."
As the first weekend after the
April 7 opening day approached,
bodies dreamed of basking in the
sun and cooling off in the novelty
of lake water.
But that weekend, it rained.
The excuse not to study wasn't
supplied by a sunny day. Instead,
students had to watch the drizzle
from dorm room windows.
"The weather was bad. There
were basically just dogs," said
Lake Lag's lifeguard, senior
James Reichmuth, who added
that he wondered if he'd ever
have to resuscitate a dog.
"It had never been filled in my
entire career here," Reichmuth
added.
But since then, the weather
has not disappointed.
What does Reichmuth think
now? "I think it's awesome," he
said.
