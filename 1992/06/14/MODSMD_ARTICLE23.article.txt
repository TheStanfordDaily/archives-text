# Grad students finish films
## Documentary makers pursue 'craftperson's media' 
### Lydia Lee Staff writer 
In the basement of McClatchy Hall, sentient
beings are lurking. It is early Saturday morning and
graduate students in the documentary film pro
gram at Stanford are rushing to finish their spring
films.
"I left at one a.m. — not very late," said Sara
Whiteley, a first year student, who often stays in the
building all night.
The nine students in this year's program have
each created three short films. The process of film
making, Whiteley said, is quite complicated — a
"craftperson's media."
Prior to actual filming, students must do pre-pro
duction research and coordinate countless logistical
details.
When she decided to film in an old house in Oak
land, Whiteley had to make sure the building's elec
trical system could handle the high-voltage lights
used in filming.
During the actual shoot, film and sound are
recorded separately. "That's what the clapper board
(in film takes) is used for," said Whiteley, "to syn
chronize the sound with the frame."
Another difference between film and video is
that film cameras do not make automatic adjust
ments for light. A production assistant must take
constant light meter readings to help the camera
operator. The students in the program have filled

various positions on each other's film crews,
learning the different aspects of production first
hand.
For a film of seven minutes, forty minutes are
shot. After the film comes back from the developer,
it is edited, along with the soundtrack. The splicing
is done the same way it was in thel92os — manual
ly.
The film is cut and taped together. A print, or per
fect copy, may then be made from the resulting work
copy.
The film Whiteley is adding the finishing touches
to is called "Rapture." Its premise, she said, involves
body piercing and "ecstatic dancing."
Whiteley, who has a background in sculpture
and performance art, calls herself a "non-fiction
filmmaker." She said she was attracted to the
medium because "it persists — it's not ephemer
al."
Her colleague editing in the next room,
Jonathan Halperin, said he finds documentary film
a combination of his two interests, theater and
journalism. He said he was inspired by the Errol
Morris' documentary "A Thin Blue Line."
Halperin's film about a school for wrestlers was
inspired by a newspaper advertisement, he said.
Whiteley said her films come from "long-standing
obsessions.
"You are forced to interact with people in the
world, with their own lives, and their own agendas;
you can't script everything," Whiteley said.
