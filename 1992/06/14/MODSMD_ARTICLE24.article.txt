# Coffee cake and lake water, anyone?

Two weeks ago the four Senior
Class Presidents sealed away
what they felt summed up their
last year at Stanford in the Class
of *92 time capsule.
For the past few weeks, Damien
Atkins, Verno Kuo, Lance
McDaniel and Jen Steele have
been trying to decide exactly what
to put in the capsule.
"We tried to ask around to see

what people thought capped the
year," said Kuo.
They looked at all the major
events that occurred over the
school year and how they were
documented. This included
retrieving clippings from The
Daily and finding "tangible items
to go with them," Steele said.
Steele added that the four "also
tried to represent the differing
opinions and views in the class."
Items ranged from the tradi
tional Class of '92 t-shirts and

Flicks passes to the more unex
pected, such as water from Lake
Lag and a coupon for Hobee's cof
fee cake.
Once they had finished filling
the capsule with these artifacts,
they made some last-minute addi
tions. "Anything else you got on
you to add?" Atkins asked. They
all searched their pockets, finding
items such as 1992 pennies and
expired Visa cards.
The event was particularly
meaningful this year because Waid

Hall, who has been responsible for
building and sealing the capsules
for the past 14 years, is retiring.
Hall's signature is one of the items
in the capsule.
Every year, Hall, a University
maintenance worker, has made
the 15-inch by 15-inch by five
inch metal capsule to hold the
memorabilia. After the Senior
Class Presidents fill it, the cap
sule is sealed shut for 100 years.
"It's no biggie," Hall said of his
job.
