In response to University budget cuts, the
class of 1992 will donate money to the Dis
ability Resource Center as its class gift,
according to Senior Class President Lance
McDaniel.
The four Senior Class Presidents —
McDaniel, Jen Steele, Verna Kuo, and Damien
Atkins — met with a group of about three
other seniors to choose this year's gift.
They considered their small budget and
decided to give the University "a practical
gift because of the budget cuts," McDaniel
said.
Using approximately $2,000 left over from

the Senior Class Presidents' budget, the offi
cers will buy various items that will benefit
the approximately 150 mentally and physical
ly disabled students on campus.
McDaniel listed portable FM receivers,
cassette recorders and ramps as some sug
gested items that could be purchased with
the funds.
Portable FM receivers would help hearing
impaired students hear lectures better.
Instead of listening to a professor from a dis
tance, students will be able to use the
receivers to pick up the signal from the profes
sor's microphone.
Blind students will be able to listen to books
on tape with the portable cassette recorders.
Portable ramps can allow access to some

buildings that do not provide wheelchair
access now.
The group rejected a proposal to fund a
public service scholarship, because it would
only benefit one student.
Another suggestion was to help support the
SWOPSI class, Self-Defense for Women, but
the course had already received funding from
the Feminist Studies department.
While the specifics of the gift to the Disabil
ity Resource Center have not yet been decided,
Molly Sandperl, the center's acting director,
said she was excited about it.
"There are so many possibilities of how the
money could be used," she said. "The Disabil
ity Resource Center is very appreciative of the
Senior Class Gift."
