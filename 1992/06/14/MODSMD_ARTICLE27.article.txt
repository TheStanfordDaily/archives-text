# Four Years In Sports
## Looking back: a celebration of sports memories 
### Tyson Vaughan Senior staff writer 
In the fall of 1988, the Stan
ford Axe Committee distributed
copies of the "Handbook of Stan
ford University" to the newly
arrived Class of 1992. Among
other things, that booklet con
tained a list of all the Farm's
national champions.
And it said, "Stanford has
won 37 NCAA team champi
onships. Only USC and UCLA
have won more, while Oklahoma
State has also won 37."
It's now safe to say that the
Cowboys have been left in the
dust.
Four years have whizzed by,
and the Cardinal has added
another 12 NCAA champions to
its list, along with one NIT
crown and countless NCAA indi
vidual titles.
Add to that list a number of
near-misses and might-have
beens and the fact that virtually
every Cardinal team has been
ranked nationally, and you have
one of the top athletic programs
in the country — if not the top.
And in the fall of 1988, not
only did the new freshmen begin
to learn this, they also began to
contribute. In women's volley
ball, freshmen Kristin Klein and
Amy Cooper were instrumental
in lifting the young team to a No.
2 national ranking.
In women's soccer — an up
and-coming squad with a new
coach — spectacular freshman
sweeper Heather Mclntyre pro
vided a foundation to build upon.
In football, a freshman named
Tuan Van Le blocked Robbie
Keen's last-second field goal
attempt to preserve a tie and
keep the Axe where it belonged.
But it was winter and spring
that provided the big thrills of
the inaugural year for the Class
of '92. With six seniors on the
men's basketball team, includ
ing All-Pacific 10 Conference
forward Howard Wright and All-
American guard Todd "the God"
Lichti, the Cardinal men's bas
ketball team went to the NCAA
Tournament for the first time
since 1942.
It was a dream season, high
lighted by the Miracle at Maples
II — a come-from-behind victory
over Pac-10 power Arizona
behind Lichti's 25-point, second
half explosion.
Meanwhile, the young,
upwardly-mobile women's bas
ketball team romped undefeated
through the Pac-10 en route to a
No. 4 national ranking. Com
bined with the men's No. 13
ranking, Stanford had the dis
tinction of being the "best bas
ketball school in the land."
And as it had been for years,
Stanford remained the best ten
nis school in the land. Dick
Gould's men's team rose from
No. 6 to No. 1 and eventually
won its second straight champi
onship in Athens over the home
team. A member of the Class of
'92 named Alex O'Brien went
undefeated in team play, keying
the victory.
Frank Brennan had what he

deemed to be the "greatest
women's collegiate tennis team
ever." And few could argue
when, led by Tami Whitlinger
and Sandra Birch, the team went
undefeated and won its fourth
consecutive championship.
While Brennan was fortifying
his dynasty, women's swimming
coach Richard Quick was dis
mantling his. The first-year
coach had won five straight
crowns at Texas, but now he was
at the helm of the Cardinal.
Keyed by Michelle Griglione's
performances, Quick's squad
was able to dethrone his old
team.
The next year brought anoth
er trio of titles and a lot more
memorable moments. Two of
those moments involved land
mark regular season wins for
Cardinal teams. Women's soccer,
boosted by frosh phenom Julie
Foudy, battled the nine-time
defending champion Tar Heels of
North Carolina to a 0-0 tie. But it
was a win for Stanford.
The 'Heels went 24-0-1 that
year.
The Cardinal posted a win
ning season and barely missed
the NCAA Tournament, just a
couple of years after it had been
— at best — a mediocre squad.
That 0-0 win proved that the
team had arrived on the national
scene.
Similarly, a monumental win
established the women's basket
ball team as a member of the

national elite. The Cardinal
women demolished the powerful
defending champion Tennessee
Volunteers.
Dur ing the course of their 32-
1 season the women captured the
Bay Area's imagination, and
then the country's, as in March
the nation watched National
Player of the Year Jennifer Azzi
lead her team home to her native
Tennessee to win the NCAA title.
Stephen F. Austin women's

basketball coach Gary Blair
called that team "one of the
three greatest teams of all time."
But while Tara VanDerveer's
troops were shooting down their
opponents in Knoxville, Bren
nan's squad was working on top
ping their previous year's per
formance. This team was even
better than the one before it, and
that one had been"the greatest
ever" and had gone undefeated.
This team did the same, rarely
even being pushed into doubles,
and won its fifth straight cham
pionship while extending an
unbelievable winning streak to
nearly 70 matches.
At one point that year, Class
of '92 member Debbie Graham
was ranked No. 4 in the country
— and she was the Cardinal's
No. 3 player! She also won the
singles championship that year
and was a finalist in the doubles.
And once again, O'Brien
swept his NCAA matches and
the men's tennis team ripped its
tournament opponents, winning
its third straight championship.
Stanford was indeed the "tennis
capital" of the college world.
Last year, however, that title
was challenged a little bit. The
men's tennis team, despite play
ing perhaps the most talented
line-up of any collegiate team in
history, was plagued by injuries.
The squad fell in the NCAA
semifinals to eventual champ
USC.
And the women made nation-

al sports news when The Streak
was shattered at 76 matches by
Florida in a 6-0 blowout. When
they played for the NCAA cham
pionship at Stanford Tennis Sta
dium, they were also going up
against a "home-court jinx" —
no host team had ever won it all
on its home court.
But the women pulled
through, breaking the jinx and
capturing their incredible sixth
consecutive national champi

onship.
Only one other crown made it
back to the Farm last year. But
it was just as exciting. The
men's basketball team, behind
the play of four seniors and
junior Adam Keefe, traipsed
through the NIT and claimed a
national title of sorts in Madison
Square Garden.
It was all the more thrilling
because inspirational leader
Andrew Vlahov, who had been
sidelined for some time after foot
surgery, returned and played as
well as he ever had, propelling
the Cardinal's triumph.
But some of the greatest
sports moments were not cham
pionship moments.
The football program had
been on the rise since the hiring
of coach Denny Green in 1989,
and it appeared on the verge of a
breakthrough when Tommy
Vardell rushed for four touch
downs and keyed the Cardinal
upset of Notre Dame. For his
performance, Vardell was
dubbed "Touchdown" Tommy
Vardell.
And of course, there were
those impossible, perfect,
dreamlike "12 seconds over
Berkeley." Before the game, it
would have been difficult to
imagine a scenario that would
adequately avenge the Play of
1982. But when revenge finally
came, the blood of the dirty
Golden Bear tasted sweeter than
molasses.
When the Class of '92 arrived,
Stanford held the Axe. The class
would never see it leave. This
year, behind Vardell's 39 carries,
Stanford overran California in
Big Game, 38-21. The Cardinal
went 8-4 and played in a bowl
game for the first time since 1986.
But just when it appeared
that Green was on the verge of

constructing a national football
power, he left for the NFL. For a
short while Stanford football afi
cionados were glum. But it was
not to last:
In a move that shocked many,
former Stanford and San Fran
cisco 49er head coach Bill Walsh
returned to the Farm to replace
Green. Suddenly the future of
Cardinal football looked brighter
than ever.
And that was just one piece of
a bundle of good news for Stan-

And of course, there
were those impossible,
perfect, dreamlike "12

difficult to imagine a
scenario that would

Play of 1982.

ford athletics this year. The
other pieces include five NCAA
team championships, tying the
record set by UCLA in 1981-82.
One of the most exciting bits
of news was not a championship,
but the return of the men's bas
ketball team to the NCAA Tour
nament. Adam Keefe, who as a
freshman was the high scorer in
Stanford's upset loss to Siena in
1989, made good on his vow to
return.
After several years of under
achieving in the postseason or
suffering from injuries, the
men's gymnastics team finally
performed to its potential and
claimed the national champi

onship behind the astounding
performances of senior Tim
Ryan and junior Jair Lynch.
The women's basketball team
made something of a recovery
from the past, as well. The squad
had been hampered by injuries
to key players in 1991, and had
barely made it to the Final Four.
But this year the team was
healthy — and hungry, too.
On the play of Molly Gooden
bour and Ail-American Val Whit
ing, the Cardinal squeaked by
top-ranked Virginia in this
year's Final Four in Los Angeles,
staging a come-from-behind one
point thriller. Then Stanford
destroyed Western Kentucky in
the finals to capture its second
title in three years.
The women's swimming team
found its championship touch
again. Led by two of the world's
greatest swimmers, Olympians
Summer Sanders and Jenny
Thompson, the women were
heavily favored from the begin
ning, and they did not disappoint.
Neither did the men, who
hadn't won since 1987. After they
trounced everyone at the NCAAs
this year, this edition of the Car
dinal was called "the best colle
giate men's swimming team
ever." Their leader was an
Olympian, record-holding back
stroker Jeff Rouse.
The final crown this year was
garnered by the men's tennis
team. Behind the inspired and
unstoppable play of senior captain
Alex O'Brien, the netters over
came the naysayers and won
their fourth championship in
five tries.
In addition, O'Brien won both
the singles and doubles titles,
becoming the first man to win
the "Triple" — the team, singles,

and doubles championships —
since John Whitlinger in 1974.
Whitlinger, who was a Cardinal
Ail-American back then, is now a
Stanford assistant coach.
Of all the sports memories that
1992's graduates will take with
them, many — probably most —
will not be championships. They
might be games or entire seasons
or brief moments. Like Lichti's
dramatic reverse dunk against
Cal, drawing the foul.
Or the astounding overtime
comeback win by the women's
basketball team against Ten
nessee on Dec. 14, 1991, when
Whiting scored 11 points in the
last three minutes of the game to
help erase a 13-point deficit.
Or the incredible Long Beach
State volleyball game two years
ago when the Cardinal pulled off
an implausible fifth-game come
back victory.
Or Tara VanDerveer getting
soaked in ice-water by her play
ers in 1992.

Or the infamous WTVA coin
toss of 1989, causing Scott For
tune, Dan Hanan and Co. to
travel a long, hard road to the
NCAA finals, where UCLA
awaited them.
Or the look on Thompson's
face when she saw her world
record time.
Or the roar of the Maples
crowd greeting the return of
Andrew Vlahov.
Or the amazing 37-game hit
ting streak of Jeffrey Hammonds
and the 59-12 season of the 1990
Cardinal baseball team — which
some still feel was the best ever.
Or the nightmare of Siena
guard Marc Brown knocking
down three after three.
Or the spirit of Tami
Whitlinger, climbing back from a
5-2 third-set hole to defeat
USC's Trisha Laux — despite
stomach pains nearly requiring
hospitalization.
Or the ecstasy on the faces of
brand-new champions rushing
their teammates in fulfilled joy
— on tennis courts, pool decks,
gymnastics floors, basketball
courts — wherever champions
may be crowned.

ning season and barely missed
the NCAA Tournament, just a
couple of years after it had been
— at best — a mediocre squad.
That 0-0 win proved that the
team had arrived on the national
scene.
Similarly, a monumental win
established the women's basket
ball team as a member of the

national elite. The Cardinal
women demolished the powerful
defending champion Tennessee
Volunteers.
Dur ing the course of their 32-
1 season the women captured the
Bay Area's imagination, and
then the country's, as in March
the nation watched National
Player of the Year Jennifer Azzi
lead her team home to her native
Tennessee to win the NCAA title.
Stephen F. Austin women's

basketball coach Gary Blair
called that team "one of the
three greatest teams of all time."
But while Tara VanDerveer's
troops were shooting down their
opponents in Knoxville, Bren
nan's squad was working on top
ping their previous year's per
formance. This team was even
better than the one before it, and
that one had been"the greatest
ever" and had gone undefeated.
This team did the same, rarely
even being pushed into doubles,
and won its fifth straight cham
pionship while extending an
unbelievable winning streak to
nearly 70 matches.
At one point that year, Class
of '92 member Debbie Graham
was ranked No. 4 in the country
— and she was the Cardinal's
No. 3 player! She also won the
singles championship that year
and was a finalist in the doubles.
And once again, O'Brien
swept his NCAA matches and
the men's tennis team ripped its
tournament opponents, winning
its third straight championship.
Stanford was indeed the "tennis
capital" of the college world.
Last year, however, that title
was challenged a little bit. The
men's tennis team, despite play
ing perhaps the most talented
line-up of any collegiate team in
history, was plagued by injuries.
The squad fell in the NCAA
semifinals to eventual champ
USC.
And the women made nation-

al sports news when The Streak
was shattered at 76 matches by
Florida in a 6-0 blowout. When
they played for the NCAA cham
pionship at Stanford Tennis Sta
dium, they were also going up
against a "home-court jinx" —
no host team had ever won it all
on its home court.
But the women pulled
through, breaking the jinx and
capturing their incredible sixth
consecutive national champi

onship.
Only one other crown made it
back to the Farm last year. But
it was just as exciting. The
men's basketball team, behind
the play of four seniors and
junior Adam Keefe, traipsed
through the NIT and claimed a
national title of sorts in Madison
Square Garden.
It was all the more thrilling
because inspirational leader
Andrew Vlahov, who had been
sidelined for some time after foot
surgery, returned and played as
well as he ever had, propelling
the Cardinal's triumph.
But some of the greatest
sports moments were not cham
pionship moments.
The football program had
been on the rise since the hiring
of coach Denny Green in 1989,
and it appeared on the verge of a
breakthrough when Tommy
Vardell rushed for four touch
downs and keyed the Cardinal
upset of Notre Dame. For his
performance, Vardell was
dubbed "Touchdown" Tommy
Vardell.
And of course, there were
those impossible, perfect,
dreamlike "12 seconds over
Berkeley." Before the game, it
would have been difficult to
imagine a scenario that would
adequately avenge the Play of
1982. But when revenge finally
came, the blood of the dirty
Golden Bear tasted sweeter than
molasses.
When the Class of '92 arrived,
Stanford held the Axe. The class
would never see it leave. This
year, behind Vardell's 39 carries,
Stanford overran California in
Big Game, 38-21. The Cardinal
went 8-4 and played in a bowl
game for the first time since 1986.
But just when it appeared
that Green was on the verge of

constructing a national football
power, he left for the NFL. For a
short while Stanford football afi
cionados were glum. But it was
not to last:
In a move that shocked many,
former Stanford and San Fran
cisco 49er head coach Bill Walsh
returned to the Farm to replace
Green. Suddenly the future of
Cardinal football looked brighter
than ever.
And that was just one piece of
a bundle of good news for Stan-

And of course, there

Play of 1982.

ford athletics this year. The
other pieces include five NCAA
team championships, tying the
record set by UCLA in 1981-82.
One of the most exciting bits
of news was not a championship,
but the return of the men's bas
ketball team to the NCAA Tour
nament. Adam Keefe, who as a
freshman was the high scorer in
Stanford's upset loss to Siena in
1989, made good on his vow to
return.
After several years of under
achieving in the postseason or
suffering from injuries, the
men's gymnastics team finally
performed to its potential and
claimed the national champi

onship behind the astounding
performances of senior Tim
Ryan and junior Jair Lynch.
The women's basketball team
made something of a recovery
from the past, as well. The squad
had been hampered by injuries
to key players in 1991, and had
barely made it to the Final Four.
But this year the team was
healthy — and hungry, too.
On the play of Molly Gooden
bour and Ail-American Val Whit
ing, the Cardinal squeaked by
top-ranked Virginia in this
year's Final Four in Los Angeles,
staging a come-from-behind one
point thriller. Then Stanford
destroyed Western Kentucky in
the finals to capture its second
title in three years.
The women's swimming team
found its championship touch
again. Led by two of the world's
greatest swimmers, Olympians
Summer Sanders and Jenny
Thompson, the women were
heavily favored from the begin
ning, and they did not disappoint.
Neither did the men, who
hadn't won since 1987. After they
trounced everyone at the NCAAs
this year, this edition of the Car
dinal was called "the best colle
giate men's swimming team
ever." Their leader was an
Olympian, record-holding back
stroker Jeff Rouse.
The final crown this year was
garnered by the men's tennis
team. Behind the inspired and
unstoppable play of senior captain
Alex O'Brien, the netters over
came the naysayers and won
their fourth championship in
five tries.
In addition, O'Brien won both
the singles and doubles titles,
becoming the first man to win
the "Triple" — the team, singles,

and doubles championships —
since John Whitlinger in 1974.
Whitlinger, who was a Cardinal
Ail-American back then, is now a
Stanford assistant coach.
Of all the sports memories that
1992's graduates will take with
them, many — probably most —
will not be championships. They
might be games or entire seasons
or brief moments. Like Lichti's
dramatic reverse dunk against
Cal, drawing the foul.
Or the astounding overtime
comeback win by the women's
basketball team against Ten
nessee on Dec. 14, 1991, when
Whiting scored 11 points in the
last three minutes of the game to
help erase a 13-point deficit.
Or the incredible Long Beach
State volleyball game two years
ago when the Cardinal pulled off
an implausible fifth-game come
back victory.
Or Tara VanDerveer getting
soaked in ice-water by her play
ers in 1992.

Or the infamous WTVA coin
toss of 1989, causing Scott For
tune, Dan Hanan and Co. to
travel a long, hard road to the
NCAA finals, where UCLA
awaited them.
Or the look on Thompson's
face when she saw her world
record time.
Or the roar of the Maples
crowd greeting the return of
Andrew Vlahov.
Or the amazing 37-game hit
ting streak of Jeffrey Hammonds
and the 59-12 season of the 1990
Cardinal baseball team — which
some still feel was the best ever.
Or the nightmare of Siena
guard Marc Brown knocking
down three after three.
Or the spirit of Tami
Whitlinger, climbing back from a
5-2 third-set hole to defeat
USC's Trisha Laux — despite
stomach pains nearly requiring
hospitalization.
Or the ecstasy on the faces of
brand-new champions rushing
their teammates in fulfilled joy
— on tennis courts, pool decks,
gymnastics floors, basketball
courts — wherever champions
may be crowned.
In the fall of 1988, the Stan
ford Axe Committee distributed
copies of the "Handbook of Stan
ford University" to the newly
arrived Class of 1992. Among
other things, that booklet con
tained a list of all the Farm's
national champions.
And it said, "Stanford has
won 37 NCAA team champi
onships. Only USC and UCLA
have won more, while Oklahoma
State has also won 37."
It's now safe to say that the
Cowboys have been left in the
dust.
Four years have whizzed by,
and the Cardinal has added
another 12 NCAA champions to
its list, along with one NIT
crown and countless NCAA indi
vidual titles.
Add to that list a number of
near-misses and might-have
beens and the fact that virtually
every Cardinal team has been
ranked nationally, and you have
one of the top athletic programs
in the country — if not the top.
And in the fall of 1988, not
only did the new freshmen begin
to learn this, they also began to
contribute. In women's volley
ball, freshmen Kristin Klein and
Amy Cooper were instrumental
in lifting the young team to a No.
2 national ranking.
In women's soccer — an up
and-coming squad with a new
coach — spectacular freshman
sweeper Heather Mclntyre pro
vided a foundation to build upon.
In football, a freshman named
Tuan Van Le blocked Robbie
Keen's last-second field goal
attempt to preserve a tie and
keep the Axe where it belonged.
But it was winter and spring
that provided the big thrills of
the inaugural year for the Class
of '92. With six seniors on the
men's basketball team, includ
ing All-Pacific 10 Conference
forward Howard Wright and All-
American guard Todd "the God"
Lichti, the Cardinal men's bas
ketball team went to the NCAA
Tournament for the first time
since 1942.
It was a dream season, high
lighted by the Miracle at Maples
II — a come-from-behind victory
over Pac-10 power Arizona
behind Lichti's 25-point, second
half explosion.
Meanwhile, the young,
upwardly-mobile women's bas
ketball team romped undefeated
through the Pac-10 en route to a
No. 4 national ranking. Com
bined with the men's No. 13
ranking, Stanford had the dis
tinction of being the "best bas
ketball school in the land."
And as it had been for years,
Stanford remained the best ten
nis school in the land. Dick
Gould's men's team rose from
No. 6 to No. 1 and eventually
won its second straight champi
onship in Athens over the home
team. A member of the Class of
'92 named Alex O'Brien went
undefeated in team play, keying
the victory.
Frank Brennan had what he

deemed to be the "greatest
women's collegiate tennis team
ever." And few could argue
when, led by Tami Whitlinger
and Sandra Birch, the team went
undefeated and won its fourth
consecutive championship.
While Brennan was fortifying
his dynasty, women's swimming
coach Richard Quick was dis
mantling his. The first-year
coach had won five straight
crowns at Texas, but now he was
at the helm of the Cardinal.
Keyed by Michelle Griglione's
performances, Quick's squad
was able to dethrone his old
team.
The next year brought anoth
er trio of titles and a lot more
memorable moments. Two of
those moments involved land
mark regular season wins for
Cardinal teams. Women's soccer,
boosted by frosh phenom Julie
Foudy, battled the nine-time
defending champion Tar Heels of
North Carolina to a 0-0 tie. But it
was a win for Stanford.
The 'Heels went 24-0-1 that
year.
The Cardinal posted a win
ning season and barely missed
the NCAA Tournament, just a
couple of years after it had been
— at best — a mediocre squad.
That 0-0 win proved that the

team championships, tying the
record set by UCLA in 1981-82.
One of the most exciting bits
of news was not a championship,
but the return of the men's bas
ketball team to the NCAA Tour
nament. Adam Keefe, who as a
freshman was the high scorer in
Stanford's upset loss to Siena in
1989, made good on his vow to
return.
After several years of under
achieving in the postseason or
suffering from injuries, the
men's gymnastics team finally
performed to its potential and
claimed the national champi

onship behind the astounding
performances of senior Tim
Ryan and junior Jair Lynch.
The women's basketball team
made something of a recovery
from the past, as well. The squad
had been hampered by injuries
to key players in 1991, and had
barely made it to the Final Four.
But this year the team was
healthy — and hungry, too.
On the play of Molly Gooden
bour and Ail-American Val Whit
ing, the Cardinal squeaked by
top-ranked Virginia in this
year's Final Four in Los Angeles,
staging a come-from-behind one
point thriller. Then Stanford
destroyed Western Kentucky in
the finals to capture its second
title in three years.
The women's swimming team
found its championship touch
again. Led by two of the world's
greatest swimmers, Olympians
Summer Sanders and Jenny
Thompson, the women were
heavily favored from the begin
ning, and they did not disappoint.
Neither did the men, who
hadn't won since 1987. After they
trounced everyone at the NCAAs
this year, this edition of the Car
dinal was called "the best colle
giate men's swimming team
ever." Their leader was an
Olympian, record-holding back
stroker Jeff Rouse.
The final crown this year was
garnered by the men's tennis
team. Behind the inspired and
unstoppable play of senior captain
Alex O'Brien, the netters over
came the naysayers and won
their fourth championship in

and doubles championships —
since John Whitlinger in 1974.
Whitlinger, who was a Cardinal
Ail-American back then, is now a
Stanford assistant coach.
Of all the sports memories that
1992's graduates will take with
them, many — probably most —
will not be championships. They
might be games or entire seasons
or brief moments. Like Lichti's
dramatic reverse dunk against
Cal, drawing the foul.
Or the astounding overtime
comeback win by the women's
basketball team against Ten
nessee on Dec. 14, 1991, when
Whiting scored 11 points in the
last three minutes of the game to
help erase a 13-point deficit.
Or the incredible Long Beach
State volleyball game two years
ago when the Cardinal pulled off
an implausible fifth-game come
back victory.
Or Tara VanDerveer getting
soaked in ice-water by her play
ers in 1992.

Or the infamous WTVA coin
toss of 1989, causing Scott For
tune, Dan Hanan and Co. to
travel a long, hard road to the
NCAA finals, where UCLA
awaited them.
Or the look on Thompson's
face when she saw her world
record time.
Or the roar of the Maples
crowd greeting the return of
Andrew Vlahov.
Or the amazing 37-game hit
ting streak of Jeffrey Hammonds
and the 59-12 season of the 1990
Cardinal baseball team — which
some still feel was the best ever.
Or the nightmare of Siena
guard Marc Brown knocking
down three after three.
Or the spirit of Tami
Whitlinger, climbing back from a
5-2 third-set hole to defeat
USC's Trisha Laux — despite
stomach pains nearly requiring
hospitalization.
Or the ecstasy on the faces of
brand-new champions rushing
their teammates in fulfilled joy
— on tennis courts, pool decks,
gymnastics floors, basketball
courts — wherever champions
may be crowned.
In the fall of 1988, the Stan
ford Axe Committee distributed
copies of the "Handbook of Stan
ford University" to the newly
arrived Class of 1992. Among
other things, that booklet con
tained a list of all the Farm's
national champions.
And it said, "Stanford has
won 37 NCAA team champi
onships. Only USC and UCLA
have won more, while Oklahoma
State has also won 37."
It's now safe to say that the
Cowboys have been left in the
dust.
Four years have whizzed by,
and the Cardinal has added
another 12 NCAA champions to
its list, along with one NIT
crown and countless NCAA indi
vidual titles.
Add to that list a number of
near-misses and might-have
beens and the fact that virtually
every Cardinal team has been
ranked nationally, and you have
one of the top athletic programs
in the country — if not the top.
And in the fall of 1988, not
only did the new freshmen begin
to learn this, they also began to
contribute. In women's volley
ball, freshmen Kristin Klein and
Amy Cooper were instrumental
in lifting the young team to a No.
2 national ranking.
In women's soccer — an up
and-coming squad with a new
coach — spectacular freshman
sweeper Heather Mclntyre pro
vided a foundation to build upon.
In football, a freshman named
Tuan Van Le blocked Robbie
Keen's last-second field goal
attempt to preserve a tie and
keep the Axe where it belonged.
But it was winter and spring
that provided the big thrills of
the inaugural year for the Class
of '92. With six seniors on the
men's basketball team, includ
ing All-Pacific 10 Conference
forward Howard Wright and All-
American guard Todd "the God"
Lichti, the Cardinal men's bas
ketball team went to the NCAA
Tournament for the first time
since 1942.
It was a dream season, high
lighted by the Miracle at Maples
II — a come-from-behind victory
over Pac-10 power Arizona
behind Lichti's 25-point, second
half explosion.
Meanwhile, the young,
upwardly-mobile women's bas
ketball team romped undefeated
through the Pac-10 en route to a
No. 4 national ranking. Com
bined with the men's No. 13
ranking, Stanford had the dis
tinction of being the "best bas
ketball school in the land."
And as it had been for years,
Stanford remained the best ten
nis school in the land. Dick
Gould's men's team rose from
No. 6 to No. 1 and eventually
won its second straight champi
onship in Athens over the home
team. A member of the Class of
'92 named Alex O'Brien went
undefeated in team play, keying
the victory.
Frank Brennan had what he

deemed to be the "greatest
women's collegiate tennis team
ever." And few could argue
when, led by Tami Whitlinger
and Sandra Birch, the team went
undefeated and won its fourth
consecutive championship.
While Brennan was fortifying
his dynasty, women's swimming
coach Richard Quick was dis
mantling his. The first-year
coach had won five straight
crowns at Texas, but now he was
at the helm of the Cardinal.
Keyed by Michelle Griglione's
performances, Quick's squad
was able to dethrone his old
team.
The next year brought anoth
er trio of titles and a lot more
memorable moments. Two of
those moments involved land
mark regular season wins for
Cardinal teams. Women's soccer,
boosted by frosh phenom Julie
Foudy, battled the nine-time
defending champion Tar Heels of
North Carolina to a 0-0 tie. But it
was a win for Stanford.
The 'Heels went 24-0-1 that
year.
The Cardinal posted a win
ning season and barely missed
the NCAA Tournament, just a
couple of years after it had been
— at best — a mediocre squad.
That 0-0 win proved that the
team had arrived on the national
scene.
Similarly, a monumental win
established the women's basket
ball team as a member of the

national elite. The Cardinal
women demolished the powerful
defending champion Tennessee
Volunteers.
Dur ing the course of their 32-
1 season the women captured the
Bay Area's imagination, and
then the country's, as in March
the nation watched National
Player of the Year Jennifer Azzi
lead her team home to her native
Tennessee to win the NCAA title.
Stephen F. Austin women's

basketball coach Gary Blair
called that team "one of the
three greatest teams of all time."
But while Tara VanDerveer's
troops were shooting down their
opponents in Knoxville, Bren
nan's squad was working on top
ping their previous year's per
formance. This team was even
better than the one before it, and
that one had been"the greatest
ever" and had gone undefeated.
This team did the same, rarely
even being pushed into doubles,
and won its fifth straight cham
pionship while extending an
unbelievable winning streak to
nearly 70 matches.
At one point that year, Class
of '92 member Debbie Graham
was ranked No. 4 in the country
— and she was the Cardinal's
No. 3 player! She also won the
singles championship that year
and was a finalist in the doubles.
And once again, O'Brien
swept his NCAA matches and
the men's tennis team ripped its
tournament opponents, winning
its third straight championship.
Stanford was indeed the "tennis
capital" of the college world.
Last year, however, that title
was challenged a little bit. The
men's tennis team, despite play
ing perhaps the most talented
line-up of any collegiate team in
history, was plagued by injuries.
The squad fell in the NCAA
semifinals to eventual champ
USC.
And the women made nation-

al sports news when The Streak
was shattered at 76 matches by
Florida in a 6-0 blowout. When
they played for the NCAA cham
pionship at Stanford Tennis Sta
dium, they were also going up
against a "home-court jinx" —
no host team had ever won it all
on its home court.
But the women pulled
through, breaking the jinx and
capturing their incredible sixth
consecutive national champi

onship.
Only one other crown made it
back to the Farm last year. But
it was just as exciting. The
men's basketball team, behind
the play of four seniors and
junior Adam Keefe, traipsed
through the NIT and claimed a
national title of sorts in Madison
Square Garden.
It was all the more thrilling
because inspirational leader
Andrew Vlahov, who had been
sidelined for some time after foot
surgery, returned and played as
well as he ever had, propelling
the Cardinal's triumph.
But some of the greatest
sports moments were not cham
pionship moments.
The football program had
been on the rise since the hiring
of coach Denny Green in 1989,
and it appeared on the verge of a
breakthrough when Tommy
Vardell rushed for four touch
downs and keyed the Cardinal
upset of Notre Dame. For his
performance, Vardell was
dubbed "Touchdown" Tommy
Vardell.
And of course, there were
those impossible, perfect,
dreamlike "12 seconds over
Berkeley." Before the game, it
would have been difficult to
imagine a scenario that would
adequately avenge the Play of
1982. But when revenge finally
came, the blood of the dirty
Golden Bear tasted sweeter than
molasses.
When the Class of '92 arrived,
Stanford held the Axe. The class
would never see it leave. This
year, behind Vardell's 39 carries,
Stanford overran California in
Big Game, 38-21. The Cardinal
went 8-4 and played in a bowl
game for the first time since 1986.
But just when it appeared
that Green was on the verge of

constructing a national football
power, he left for the NFL. For a

Cal, drawing the foul.
Or the astounding overtime
comeback win by the women's
basketball team against Ten
nessee on Dec. 14, 1991, when
Whiting scored 11 points in the
last three minutes of the game to
help erase a 13-point deficit.
Or the incredible Long Beach
State volleyball game two years
ago when the Cardinal pulled off
an implausible fifth-game come
back victory.
Or Tara VanDerveer getting
soaked in ice-water by her play
ers in 1992.

Or the infamous WTVA coin
toss of 1989, causing Scott For
tune, Dan Hanan and Co. to
travel a long, hard road to the
NCAA finals, where UCLA
awaited them.
Or the look on Thompson's
face when she saw her world
record time.
Or the roar of the Maples
crowd greeting the return of
Andrew Vlahov.
Or the amazing 37-game hit
ting streak of Jeffrey Hammonds
and the 59-12 season of the 1990
Cardinal baseball team — which
some still feel was the best ever.
Or the nightmare of Siena
guard Marc Brown knocking
down three after three.
Or the spirit of Tami
Whitlinger, climbing back from a
5-2 third-set hole to defeat
USC's Trisha Laux — despite
stomach pains nearly requiring
hospitalization.
Or the ecstasy on the faces of
brand-new champions rushing
their teammates in fulfilled joy
— on tennis courts, pool decks,
gymnastics floors, basketball
courts — wherever champions
may be crowned.
