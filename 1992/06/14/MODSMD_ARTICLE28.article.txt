# King Keefe held court for four years
## Cardinal big man led team to NIT Championship, NCAA Tourney

Pacific 10 Conference basketball coaches
hastily wrote their own script for Terminator
3, and it called for the immediate neutraliza
tion of Stanford power forward Adam Keefe.
In a blockbuster adventure acted out on the
courts of the Pac-10, defenses relentlessly
hunted for Keefe throughout the conference
season.
In eveiy game Stanford played the defense
targeted Keefe, the omnipotent 6-foot-9 man
in the middle for the Cardinal.
The All-America candidate faced double
teams, box-and-ones, sagging zones and
Schwarzenegger-style defenders sent into the
game commando-style to attack until defeat
ed.
Keefe had added a lethal offensive arsenal
in the off-season and thus gunned the surpris
ing Cardinal to a 18-13 record overall, 10-8 in
the Pac-10. Stanford, which had been picked
to finish as low as eighth in the conference,
stunned everyone and came in fourth behind
three national powerhouses.
Keefe took the defensive attention and
twisted it to his advantage. When teams mus
cled him inside, he buried outside jumpers,
passed to open teammates or waited patiently
to score off rebounds. If allowed to get the ball
inside, he scored.
"Adam has really had his head in the game
as far as knowing what he needs to do to help
us win," said head coach Mike Montgomery.
"How many of Brent's (Williams) and Pete's
(Dukes) 40 points (at Oregon Jan. 11) came
because of what they were doing to stop
Keefe?"
Keefe, who at 240 pounds is 10 pounds

stronger than last year, spent the summer
preparing for a vicious Pac-10 onslaught. He
worked on his outside game as a starter for
the Pan American team, then worked on his
inside toughness with the Yoda of centers, for
mer UCLA and NBA great Bill Walton.
"We talked basketball for a week and it was

'I kind of have to (focus
on things besides scor
ing), but it's not by
choice. You have to do
something out there so
you don't feel like a stiff.
I get adrenaline out of
watching other people
hit open jumpers.'

a really good experience," said Keefe, who
stayed at Walton's home for a week. "He
taught me some of the mental aspects of play
ing the post, as well as some new skills. He
gave me a sense of what it takes to go to the
next level and be successful."
Playing power forward — instead of center
as he did last year — allowed Keefe to escape
some of the banging inside and score from the
perimeter.
And when teams tried to wear Keefe out by
fouling him, he punished them with an 86 per
cent free throw rate.

"Teams like USC and Arizona will just
keep sending guys to foul me," said Keefe ear
lier in the season. "Fortunately, Coach has
given me the opportunity to step away from
the basket and shoot the ball, and that should
help me."
And help it did. Keefe finished the season
11th in the nation in scoring at 25.3 points
per-game and fourth in rebounding (12.2 rpg).
He became the school's all-time leading
rebounder and No. 2 all-time scorer. Despite
the constant defensive attention, Keefe was
not just great or consistent, but consistently
great.
In a 78-57 Pac-10 win at Oregon, the Duck
zone smothered Keefe, so he turned into a
passing and rebounding machine. While limit
ed to a season-low 10 shots, Keefe snagged a
career-high 22 rebounds, left lots of room for
Peter Dukes and Brent Williams to shoot from
the perimeter, yet still wound up with 17
points of his own.
"I kind of have to (focus on things besides
scoring), but it's not by choice," said Keefe.
"You have to do something out there so you
don't feel like a stiff. I get adrenaline out of
watching other people hit open jumpers."
Keefe's all-around improvement helped
lead the Cardinal to its fifth consecutive post
season tournament appearance, an NCAA
Tournament contest against SEC-power
Alabama.
Although Alabama capitalized on a late sec
ond half surge to win, 80-75, Keefe finished
with a game-high 23 points and nine
rebounds.
Stanford will miss Keefe, but opponents
won't.

Keefe will enter the NBA Draft on June 26.
