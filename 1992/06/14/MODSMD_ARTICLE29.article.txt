# Vardell bulldozed his way into Stanford's record books

The crowd focuses on the opponents' end
zone and begins to cheer. As the scoreboard
flashes six more points for the Cardinal, the
announcer shouts: "Touchdown — number
44, Tommy Vardell!"
This scenario occurred so often last year,
Cardinal head coach Denny Green nicknamed
senior fullback Tommy Vardell "Touchdown
Tommy." And the name stuck.
"I enjoy the name," Vardell said. "It's fun.
A lot of people don't know who the hell
Tommy Vardell is, but they know who
'Touchdown Tommy' is."
This season Vardell established himself as
one the best fullbacks in college football and
one of the toughest goal-line runners in the
nation.
The fifth-year senior from El Cajon, Cali
fornia accumulated 1,084 rushing yards on
226 carries this season, third in the Pac-10.
Vardell turned in seven 100-yard rushing day
in 11 regular-season games. His 20 touch
downs for the season not only led the Pac-10,
but hurled him over Darrin Nelson's 1981
school record of 16 single season touchdowns.
Vardell also set the school record for most
points in a season with 120.
Green compares Vardell's powerful, tough
and slashing style of play to that of a "run
away freight train."
"He plays hard, physical football," Green
said.

Vardell's wide range of abilities on the field
has led him to be considered a "complete"
football player by coaches and teammates
alike.
"Tommy epitomizes what an all-around
football player is," quarterback Steve Sten
strom said. "He can run, he can catch, he can
block."
Despite the fact that he must concentrate
on numerous tasks during a rushing attack,
Vardell has learned to focus his energies effec
tively.
"My goal is to make the most of what I've
been given," Vardell said. "To hit the seams,
hit them hard, to maintain good body lean and
to run hard. Aggressive-style running is my
style. That's what I've found is most produc
tive."
After redshirting as a freshman, Vardell
has made steady improvement each season.
He has developed from a 219-pound full
back/running back, to a solid 6-foot-3, 235-
pound fullback.
"His progress has been tremendous both
on the field and off," said running backs coach
Tyrone Willingham. "There's a natural
maturing process for the body as it gets older,
but a lot of it has been dedication on his part."
"I've learned a lot about myself, about peo
ple in general," Vardell said. "I've grown in
my approach to the game."
Vardell started in five games as a junior
and appeared in 10 games during that season.
He was second on the team with 237 rushing
yards and he led the team with three rushing

touchdowns. He began the next season as a
backup to Ellery Roberts, but moved into the
starting lineup in game two. He rushed for a
school record of 14 touchdowns from an
aggregate 28 yards out, and scored a total of
84 points. He was tied with Cal's Russell
White for the most touchdowns in the Pac-10.
In the 1991 season, Vardell put up even more
impressive numbers.
"I'm surprised with some of the things that
have happened," Vardell said. "It's certainly
been a goal and it's not something ... that I
wasn't hoping for, or working towards. But
last year ... I didn't envision myself running
50 yards without being caught by a lineman."
Vardell's 182 rushing yards and three
touchdowns against California put him over
the 1000-yard mark. More importantly, how
ever, the Cardinal's 38-21 victory in this
year's Big Game left Vardell and the rest of
the fifth-year seniors undefeated against the
Golden Bears.
"It's a great feeling [to be undefeated],"
Vardell said. "A lot of their players are think
ing they've never beaten Stanford. I'm glad
I'm on the other side of the coin."
"I'm sorry that [my Stanford career] will be
over," Vardell said. "It's gonna be tough, but
I'm real glad that we've got something going
here and that we have something estab
lished."

In the April 26 NFL draft, Vardell was the
first running back selected, nabbed by the
Cleveland Browns with the ninth pick.
