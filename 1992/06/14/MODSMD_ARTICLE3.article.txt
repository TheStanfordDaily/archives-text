# Stanford shock
## Grad overcomes 'cultural illiteracy' 
### Ashok Rai 
"I'm Ashok," I tell people
whom I have never met before.
"Ashok, like artichoke." It has
taken me most of my four years at
Stanford to perfect this introduc
tion — a dubious achievement.
My name, which I share with a
renowned Buddhist emperor who
ruled over India 2,000 years ago,
is now being likened to a Califor
nian vegetable.
As a freshman in America for
the first time, I was culturally
quite illiterate when I came to
Stanford. I had never seen Star
Wars nor played Tetris, much to
the dismay of my roommate who
seemed preoccupied by both. I
had never heard the word
"psychedelic." I had never eaten a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Many in my all-frosh dorm
were perhaps as surprised by me
as I was by them. I had a
"strange" accent yet spoke perfect
English. I was easily impressed,
even by a drive-thru McDonald's.
I had flown for nearly 20 hours to
get an education halfway around
the world.

Today, as I find myself on the
verge of graduating, the awk
wardness of freshman year seems
so far away. I could not have
hoped for a more satisfying
undergraduate experience. I have
introduced my American friends
to eating Indian food with fingers
instead of silverware, Indian clas
sical music, the politics of religion

in India and cricket (the game,
not the insect). They have
exposed me to, among so many
other things, the Grateful Dead,
volleyball, presidential cam
paigns, feminism, and their per
sonal and diverse histories.
Not everyone has been friendly
and accepting, though. An unpro
voked and intoxicated dormmate
once told me in front of several
others to go back where I came
from and then lapsed into obscen
ities. Another kept insisting,
based on what he claims were
images from television, that the
reason why so many Indians
starved was that they had no
teeth and could not eat. I did not
share his sense of humor.
As a freshman, I remember
being quiet and a little intimidat
ed. Americans around me seemed
to talk freely and forever about
politics, about their feelings,
about sex, about classes. Today I
am part of that noise. I make the
controversial statements that
generate endless arguments.
I suggest sometimes that India
has as much, if not more, diversi
ty and history than the whole of
Europe, but the University gives
disproportionate attention to the
latter.
There are academic theme
houses and several levels of lan
guage instruction on France, Ger
many, Italy, Russia and Eastern
Europe, and East Asia. Yet huge
chunks of the developing world,
like the Middle East, South Asia
and Africa, are largely ignored.
I have learned from you Amer
icans through comparison, con
trast and similarity. Those of you
whom I know have hopefully been
influenced by me in much the
same way. Occasionally I have felt
like the non-western requirement
would if it were a person. I usual
ly enjoy playing this role. I have
been wonderfully fortunate to
have been a part of your world,
and I urge you to be a part of
mine: to travel or work in a non
western, less developed, ancient
civilization — India, for instance
— and understand our issues and
our challenges.

majored in Economics and will
start a Ph.D. at the University of
