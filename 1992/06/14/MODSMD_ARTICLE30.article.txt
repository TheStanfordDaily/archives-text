# Rouse's finishes far from average

Jeff Rouse is the boy next door.
He's the kid you splashed around
with in the community pool every
summer. He's the kind of guy who
would call your dad "sir" and your
mom "ma'am."
He's also the world record hold
er in the 100-meter backstroke.
"I'd prefer to be thought of as
one of the guys ... an average
Joe," Rouse said, a senior majoring
in economics.
Rouse's accomplishments, how
ever, are anything but average.
The senior ended his amazing
collegiate career in grand fashion,
setting five American records and
leading Stanford to a 632 point,
first-place performance at the
NCAA finals March 26-28 in Indi
anapolis. Rouse won three individ
ual events and swam on three win
ning relay teams during the three
day meet.
"I ended my career with a meet
that I couldn't have scripted bet
ter," Rouse said. "This was my
ultimate challenge and the reward
has been fantastic."
Rouse captured the individual
title in the 200-yard backstroke
with a record time of 1:40.64, near
ly two seconds faster than his time
in the preliminaries, which also
beat the standing American
record. Rouse won the NCAA title
in the 200-yard backstroke in 1989
as well.
Rouse was equally impressive
in the 100 back, winning in 46.12
and earning another national
record. It was the senior's fourth
consecutive NCAA crown in the
event.
He finished up his individual
success with a victory in the 200
Individual Medley.
Rouse also led the Cardinal to a
sweep of the five relay events,

anchoring the 400-free team, and
swimming backstroke on the 200-
and 400-medley squads.
"Jeff Rouse is the defmition of a
great athlete, someone who makes
everybody around him better by
the things he does ... his quality
and work ethic in practice," said
men's swimming coach Skip Ken
ney. "Yet he's never boastful. You

could talk with him for hours and
you'd never guess he was a great
swimmer. He lets his actions speak
for themselves."
His major feat to date
remains the world record, which
he swam in last summer's Pan
Pacific games. Rouse stands as the

Jeff Rouse, the world's No. 1 backstroker, set one world and five
American records while at Stanford. After leading the Cardinal to an
overwhelming victory at the NCAA Championships, Rouse hopes to
win a gold medal in Barcelona this summer.
first person in history to break 55
seconds in the 100-meter back with
a 53.93.
The record came as a surprise
for Rouse, who became the best in
the world leading off a 400 medley
relay, after he had failed to do so in
two individual 200-meter back
swims.
Rouse shocked the swimming
community with his time, bypassing
54 seconds even after the implemen
tation of a new rule which banned
the extended underwater dolphin
kick — a rule which was supposed to
slow down backstrokers.
"I'm not even sure it's sunk in
yet," Rouse said. "I don't think of
myself as the best swimnAer in the
world. I'm definitely not invincible.
I still have to look at all the compe
tition equally and see that they can
beat me if I let them."
With the Olympics only weeks
away, Rouse is trying to deal with
the country's expectations of him.
In many people's eyes, world
record holders should win gold

medals. Rouse sees it differently.
"In 1988 (at the Olympic Trials)
I failed miserably. I was ranked No.
2, but I kept thinking of what I saw
as everyone else's expectations of
me," Rouse said.
"I was thinking about my fami
ly, friends, neighbors, barber,
teammates, and coaches, and what
I felt were their expectations," he
joked. "It was never, 'I've got to
make the team.' It just broke me
down, but now I've learned to deal
with that pail of my emotions.
"Going to the Olympics and
winning a gold medal would mean
that all the years, the past fifteen to
seventeen years of swimming every
single day ... those days paid off."
Rouse is quick to explain that
his time at Stanford has been well
spent. As an athlete, Rouse enjoys
water skiing, snow skiing, and dirt
bike riding, but has put those pur
suits on hold, for now. "Sometimes
I'm bummed that I couldn't go to
Tahoe, but I made the choice to do
swimming. It's a trade-off for
something greater. I can go to
Tahoe for the rest of my life."
Even as a world-ranked swim
mer, Rouse liked to appear a nor
mal Stanford student who, like

most, "enjoys more than anything
hanging out and procrastinating
on school work.
"I hate it when I meet people
and I'm introduced as a world
record holder, or an Olympic hope
ful," Rouse explained. "I'm kind of
a quiet guy. It scares me that I'd be
interpreted as stuck-up or cocky."
Rouse is still improving his
times, and plans to stay competi
tive as long as he's getting better
and "milk it for all it's worth."
"I'm so glad I got to share in Jeff
Rouse, and the experience of coach
ing him," Kenney said. "He's the
strongest swimmer, in the water,
that I've ever coached ... but he
always gives to others and never
takes."
"I'm not the type of guy who
goes looking for a lot of attention.
I'm not a playboy or a show off,"
Rouse asserts. "If you passed by
my room and saw me sitting there,
you probably wouldn't even think I
was an athlete."
Until you saw him swim.

Rouse will represent the United
States in Barcelona this summer
and continue swimming competi
tively until 1994.
