# Rouse's finishes far from average

Jeff Rouse is the boy next door.
He's the kid you splashed around
with in the community pool every
summer. He's the kind of guy who
would call your dad "sir" and your
mom "ma'am."
He's also the world record hold
er in the 100-meter backstroke.
"I'd prefer to be thought of as
one of the guys ... an average
Joe," Rouse said, a senior majoring
in economics.
Rouse's accomplishments, how
ever, are anything but average.
The senior ended his amazing
collegiate career in grand fashion,
setting five American records and
leading Stanford to a 632 point,
first-place performance at the
NCAA finals March 26-28 in Indi
anapolis. Rouse won three individ
ual events and swam on three win
ning relay teams during the three
day meet.
"I ended my career with a meet
that I couldn't have scripted bet
ter," Rouse said. "This was my
ultimate challenge and the reward
has been fantastic."
Rouse captured the individual
title in the 200-yard backstroke
with a record time of 1:40.64, near
ly two seconds faster than his time
in the preliminaries, which also
beat the standing American
record. Rouse won the NCAA title
in the 200-yard backstroke in 1989
as well.
Rouse was equally impressive
in the 100 back, winning in 46.12
and earning another national
record. It was the senior's fourth
consecutive NCAA crown in the
event.
He finished up his individual
success with a victory in the 200
Individual Medley.
Rouse also led the Cardinal to a
sweep of the five relay events,

anchoring the 400-free team, and
swimming backstroke on the 200-
and 400-medley squads.
"Jeff Rouse is the defmition of a
great athlete, someone who makes
everybody around him better by
the things he does ... his quality
and work ethic in practice," said
men's swimming coach Skip Ken
ney. "Yet he's never boastful. You

could talk with him for hours and
you'd never guess he was a great
swimmer. He lets his actions speak
for themselves."
His major feat to date
remains the world record, which
he swam in last summer's Pan
Pacific games. Rouse stands as the
