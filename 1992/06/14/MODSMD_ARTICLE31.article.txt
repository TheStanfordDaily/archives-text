# Klein always put team first
## 
### George Malone Editorial staff 
Senior Kristin Klein of the
Stanford women's volleyball team
was named the 1991 Volleyball
Monthly Player of the Year and
led the Cardinal in kills and hit
ting percentage. She captained the
team to a 30-2 record, including
an unprecedented 28-game win
ning streak. Under her leadership,
Stanford went to the West Region
al Finals before losing to eventual
champion UCLA. She is certainly
one of the greatest women's vol
leyball players ever to wear the
Cardinal uniform.
The thing that might just set
her apart from other great play
ers, however, is her awareness of
how individuals need to fade into
the background in volleyball and
how truly important everyone else
on a team is.
Instead of speaking about her
own accolades and honors (which
are many), Klein always chan
neled all discussion towards the
team as a whole. But it's impor
tant to understand that she
doesn't evade questions about
herself by talking about the team
instead of herself. To her, the
team is most important.
"As far as I am concerned, we
could have the best player in the
world on our team, but if the other
five people don't help and con
tribute, or if those people don't get
along and play together, they
won't win," she said earlier this
season.
In that context Klein saw her
higher level of play this year as
part of an overall team improve
ment.
"I think I've been having my
best year so far at Stanford," she
said before the team travelled to
Hawaii. "Each person on our team
has jumped up a level.
"We have a really good team
that meshes together and plays
together. That's one of our big
strengths . .. .There may even be
another team in the country that
some people would say had more
talent than us, but I don't think
that someone could say that they
played together better than we
do."
The fact that the team was
much more experienced this year
made a huge difference in Klein's

eyes. She and her teammates
moved beyond simply working
together, she said.
"A lot of times, especially in the
back row, [Kathy Jurgens] and I
or [Laurie Sawin] and I — we just
know what ball the other person is
going to get. You don't just know
that after playing with someone
for six months. It takes a couple of
years or a couple of seasons."
A perfect example of Klein's
faith in her teammates came when
she had her worst performance of
the season against Washington in
Seattle. The Husky players con
centrated their blocks on her and
she couldn't get on track, she said.

"They were just keying on me,"
Klein said. "I was getting roofed.
But, that's OK, we still won in
three. We just go to someone else.
"I think teams have learned. In
the beginning, I don't know if they
respected some of our hitters as
much and they would tend to key
on Bev [Odenl or myself. I think
they've learned now that they
have to because they can key on us
and we'll still beat them 3-0,
because we'll just set the ball to
someone else."

improvement of her all-around

With soft dinks like this in addition to her trademark powerful
spikes, Kristin Klein captained the Cardinal women's volleyball
team to its most successful year ever. The team had a 30-2 record
and an unprecedented 28-game winning streak. Klein was named
1991 Volleyball Monthly Player of the Year.
game was her experience on the
U.S. National B Team this sum
mer. Klein, along with teammates
Amy Cooper and Oden, played
against top international teams in
the Pan Am Games and the World
University Games.
"I played a different role on our
team this summer," she said. "I
played a lot of back row. I was one
of the shorter people on my team
so I passed almost the whole court
and played lots of defense .... It's
really satisfying to pass the ball
and play defense too.
"When I did get set, I was hit
ting against a right-side middle
blocker that was 6-foot-3 and a top
international player, so I had to
find a way to put the ball down. I
think that's where I learned to
vary my attack."
And throughout the season,
teams learned to fear Klein.

Klein will either play professionally
in Italy or join the U.S. National
team after this summer's Olympics.

U.S. National B Team this sum
mer. Klein, along with teammates
Amy Cooper and Oden, played
against top international teams in
the Pan Am Games and the World
University Games.
"I played a different role on our
team this summer," she said. "I
played a lot of back row. I was one
of the shorter people on my team
so I passed almost the whole court
and played lots of defense .... It's
really satisfying to pass the ball
and play defense too.
"When I did get set, I was hit
ting against a right-side middle
blocker that was 6-foot-3 and a top
international player, so I had to
find a way to put the ball down. I
think that's where I learned to
vary my attack."
And throughout the season,
teams learned to fear Klein.

Klein will either play professionally
in Italy or join the U.S. National
team after this summer's Olympics.
