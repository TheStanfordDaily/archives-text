# It's like a 9 o'clock you're not allowed to skip
## 
### 
I know exactly where you're going to be
this time next year. And it ain't pretty.
Your alarm clock will go off at about the
same time Willard Scott is choosing a
rodent-like toupee and stuffing jelly donuts
into his mouth. And you'll slowly turn
around in your big, empty bed and reach
for the snooze button like a defeated,
Pavlovian Ferris Bueller.
Until this point in the story, your new,
high-powered corporate job and my tran
quil Stanford existence seem pretty simi
lar, if financially dichotomous.
But the difference between you and I is
that when I tell those annoying Lamont
and Tennelli guys to shut up, they'll shut
up. Meanwhile, you'll be dragging yourself
out of bed and blow-drying your hair for a 9
o'clock you're not allowed to skip.
I know what you're thinking. "Joel, peo
ple don't really blow-dry their hair any
more, do they?"
Yes, my little Horatio Algers, people do
blow-dry their hair in the real world. They
also shower instead of trying to get by with
that deodorant-and-a-baseball-cap fashion
excuse. And they make meaningless, disen
franchised, kiss-up small talk about their
boss' hair.
And while I'm out frolicking with my
dormmates, enjoying an afternoon of Intra
mural Hot-Oil Wrestling, you'll be with

your fellow workers — meekly volleying
lines from last weekend's Saturday Night
Live over your tiny cubicle walls.
Because as much as you promise your
self not to, you will watch television. And
I'm not just talking about "Studs" and
"David Letterman." I'm talking the whole
big, ugly, hour-long, morality-play influ
enced ball of wax.
And eventually, you'll come to the
frightening realization that it's cheaper
and less embarrassing to subscribe to TV
Guide. And not too long after that, you'll
start skimming the articles. And you'll
relate to your parents a whole lot better

than you have in a long, long while.
There's no doubt you'll try to stem the
tide. You'll begin doing things on a regular
basis that you've only seen in James Spad
er movies. You'll "go dancing" in the city or
"hang out" at a bar or "experiment" with
Stuart Reges.
But deep in your heart, you'll know that
all this while, you're getting old.
Your Blockbuster bills will increase sub
stantially. You'll know who Jay Leno is
having on several days in advance. And in
your desperate attempt to build a social
life, you'll invite people over for "dinner
parties."
You will go to garage sales. You will
notice other people's wallpaper when you
visit their homes. You will read local papers
and consider joining "clubs." You will eat
pasta at an uncomfortably regular rate.
Worst of all, you will go to your first
friend's wedding. And your parents will
start to nag you about getting into a serious
relationship. And you'll grab the safest part
ner you can, call it love, buy a cake and send
fancy, embroidered invitations to all your
relatives with the all-too-obvious subtext:
"I'd like you to come and meet the person I
am having sex with on a regular basis."
But not me, babe. I'll be free. No wife to
worry about, no boss to report to, no handi
wipes to run over small, unsanitary bot

toms. The only thing on my mind will be
perfecting my already impressive oral sex
skills. And volleyball. Lots of volleyball.
No landlords to deal with, no cabinets to
divvy up and no undue excitement over
double coupon days.
I'll be living in a dorm room, surrounded
by people my own age, people who are hip
to the whole college scene.
So while you're at some bar, searching
for an excuse not to give your phone num
ber to middle-aged, single parents with a
little too much Dep in their noticeably too
young haircut, I'll be enjoying EANABS at
a party conveniently located just a couple of
blocks away.
But deep inside I'll be jealous. You'll be
making money. You'll be in control of your
lives. You'll redefine the word autonomy
and not worry about having to get the
spelling right. Your free time will be com
pletely yours. And you'll finally have the
time to dedicate to finding out what's going
on in the real world, and how "Hard Copy"
feels about that issue.
Should have gone to grad school, eh?

Joel Stein will miss you greatly, even
though he never had the slightest bit of sex
ual interaction with any of you. He will
gladly write you personal letters on a week
ly basis — for a price.

notice other people's wallpaper when you
visit their homes. You will read local papers
and consider joining "clubs." You will eat
pasta at an uncomfortably regular rate.
Worst of all, you will go to your first
friend's wedding. And your parents will
start to nag you about getting into a serious
relationship. And you'll grab the safest part
ner you can, call it love, buy a cake and send
fancy, embroidered invitations to all your
relatives with the all-too-obvious subtext:
"I'd like you to come and meet the person I
am having sex with on a regular basis."
But not me, babe. I'll be free. No wife to
worry about, no boss to report to, no handi
wipes to run over small, unsanitary bot

toms. The only thing on my mind will be
perfecting my already impressive oral sex
skills. And volleyball. Lots of volleyball.
No landlords to deal with, no cabinets to
divvy up and no undue excitement over
double coupon days.
I'll be living in a dorm room, surrounded
by people my own age, people who are hip
to the whole college scene.
So while you're at some bar, searching
for an excuse not to give your phone num
ber to middle-aged, single parents with a
little too much Dep in their noticeably too
young haircut, I'll be enjoying EANABS at
a party conveniently located just a couple of
blocks away.
But deep inside I'll be jealous. You'll be
making money. You'll be in control of your
lives. You'll redefine the word autonomy
and not worry about having to get the
spelling right. Your free time will be com
pletely yours. And you'll finally have the
time to dedicate to finding out what's going
on in the real world, and how "Hard Copy"
feels about that issue.
Should have gone to grad school, eh?

Joel Stein will miss you greatly, even
though he never had the slightest bit of sex
ual interaction with any of you. He will
gladly write you personal letters on a week
ly basis — for a price.


Joel Stein
