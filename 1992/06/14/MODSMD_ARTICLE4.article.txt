# Varnedoe to defend arts in address
## 
### Julie Makinen Staff writer 
Kirk who? Glad you asked.
Putting function over form,
Stanford has chosen art curator
Kirk Varnedoe as this year's
commencement speaker. And
although his may not be a house
hold name, Varnedoe promises
to deliver a substantive two
cents on a number of topics,
including the arts and humani
ties at Stanford and beyond.
"So much important informa
tion in the world today is visu
al," Varnedoe said. "Being able
to control, generate and under
stand visual media is at least as
important as reading books in
contemporary society."
Varnedoe, director of the
Department of Painting and
Sculpture at New York's Museum
of Modern Art, regards his selec
tion as a recognition of the impor
tance of the arts at Stanford.
"I'm someone to speak for the
side of a Stanford education, rep
resenting the arts and a well-lived
life," he said. "I want to empha
size the importance of arts in edu
cation and serve as a spokesman
of the arts in general."
Varnedoe, who received his

master's and doctoral degrees in
art history from Stanford in 1970
and 1972, said he has been affect
ed by recently proposed cuts to
art programs as both a museum
curator and a Stanford alumnus.
"At [the museum], we've
been forced to rethink our pro
gramming priorities as we've
been faced with reduced funds,"
he said. "It's inspired what we
like to call 'creative thinking.' "
Varnedoe has also been keep
ing abreast of the proposed cuts
at Stanford. "I wrote a letter on
behalf of the art and photo
departments," he said. "Deep
cuts in arts and humanities are
the wrong way to go."
Varnedoe has a history of
defending what he values. As a
Stanford student in the political
ly turbulent days of the early
19705, he was involved in sever
al violent conflicts between stu
dent demonstrators and police.
"The whiff of tear gas is a dis
tinct memory," Varnedoe said.
"There were nightly confronta
tions and demonstrations on
campus. In these frays, profes
sors were standing out defend
ing the new art building. Every
one was totally obsessed with
the day-to-day drama, and peo

pie were defending what was
important to them."
Art Prof. Albert Elsen
remembers that in one clash,
Varnedoe was sprayed with tear
gas, stumbled into the art build
ing and had to be rinsed off by
people inside.
But Varnedoe prefers the
more peaceful memories of his
student life. "I had an exception
ally good educational experience
at Stanford," he said. "I was able

to take courses from all around
the university, in departments
such as French and Italian. It
was excellent."
As a curator, Varnedoe has
organized exhibits on everything
from "Protest Art from California
Campuses" to "Realism and Sym
bolism in Scandinavian Paint
ing." He has taught at Stanford,
Columbia and New York Univer
sity's Institute of Fine Arts.
Varnedoe's research interests
include the drawings of Auguste
Rodin and the history of photog
raphy.
In 1984, Varnedoe received a
Mac Arthur Foundation Fellow
ship, which resulted in his book "A
Fine Disregard: What Makes Mod
ern Art Modern." He has also writ
ten on other topics, most recently
modern art and popular culture.
Varnedoe said he has never
spoken at a graduation before
and that in fact, he did not
attend his own Stanford gradua
tion because he was doing
research in Europe.
"The problem for me as an
artist is that I'm used to two
slide projectors in a darkened
room," he said. "Stanford Stadi
um and 30,000 people is a little
different."
