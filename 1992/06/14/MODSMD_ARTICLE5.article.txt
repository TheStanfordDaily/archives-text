# Grads find 'freedom' far from home
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Between overcoming cultural barriers,
obtaining a work permit, and finding time to
visit distant family, international students
have post-graduation worries beyond the tra
ditional "job or graduate school" dilemma.
Senior Radah Rangarajan said she is going
to use the next year as a time to reconcile her
traditional Indian culture with the feminist
studies courses she took at Stanford by work
ing at a magazine in India. Eventually, she
hopes to come back to Stanford for graduate
school.
Rangarajan said that the hardest part of
being an international student was adjusting
to a completely new culture, which included
things as common as coin-operated washing
machines and automatic teller machines.
"I was fairly protected when I was growing
up, and the first thing I realized when I came
here was I was completely on my own," she

said. "I shied away from a bit of life's experi
ences.
"For me, [Stanford] was home in America
and there was no place else to go," she said,
adding that often she felt "lost" because of
Stanford's size.
For Anthony Alles, though, an Australian
student graduating with a MBA, his culture
does not differ very much from Stanford's.
"From a quality of life standpoint, I miss
Australia," he said. "It is almost identical to
this place but a lot cheaper."
One of the few regrets Alles had about com
ing to Stanford is the cost, which was an espe
cially big shock since education in Australia is
free, he said.
Senior Omphemetse Mooki said he had a
very different perspective than other under
graduates because of his life in South Africa.
His education at Stanford gave him a model to
compare to the public school system there, he
said.
Mooki, who majored in immunology and

microbiology, said he would never have come
here directly from South Africa, and only
learned of Stanford through the private
boarding school in the United States he
attended on scholarship.
His future plans include a lot more school
before returning to South Africa to teach. Next
year he is attending Oxford University to work
towards a master's degree in microbiology.
"My goal is to go back home and try to
make students aware of some of the benefits
I've had studying abroad," he said.
Far from home
However, not every one wants to go back
home. Costis Skiadas, a Greek student gradu
ating with his Ph.D. in Operations Research,
said he has also always wanted to stay in this
country to work. Next year, he will fulfill that
wish by teaching at Northwestern Universi
ty's Kellogg School of Business.
But not all international stu
dents have such settled futures in
the U.S. Alles' current concerns
are his visa status and finding a
job, preferably in Silicon Valley.
Although Silicon Valley is in the
midst of a recession, Alles said he
has a better chance of finding a job
here than in Australia because of
the amount of competition between
companies in the United States.
"Silicon Valley is like heaven,"
he said, pointing out that there
are only one or two companies in
Australia that could use his skills

in product management.
Alles said he and his wife Malini,
an undergraduate, argue about
whether or not to return to Aus
tralia "All of us would like to go back
at some stage ... but we need to
have a job to go back to," he said.
Freedom to explore
But jobs and majors weren't the
only concern of these students.
Rangarajan said that she found
time to take several feminist stud
ies classes despite majoring in biol
ogy, and even taught the SWOPSI
Self-Defense for Women class.
She said her most valuable
experience was taking feminist
studies courses, which helped her
"crystallize" her views on femi

nism, the third world and her cul
ture. The classes "marked for me
the beginning of being an
activist," she said.
However, she added that she
still felt some familial pressure
when it came to choosing her
major. "If I had done something
non-scientific, I don't think my
parents would have been as
happy. But the final decision was
mine," Rangarajan said.
Alles said he regrets not taking
more classes "across the street"
and outside the business school.
Alles said he would have liked to
get more involved in other aspects
of Stanford life, but that business
school is a bit "isolated."
Skiadas said, he likes the open

ness that allowed him to take
courses from many departments.
Mooki agreed that the best thing
about Stanford is its "philosophy
about education" and its "effort to
have undergraduates partake in
what other schools would consider
graduate programs."
He has taken advantage of
research opportunities by working
at the Center for AIDS Research
since he was a sophomore, Mooki
said. He added that a combination
of scientific research and humani
ties programs has given him a
broader perspective on issues.
"No more assignments, no
more late nights, no more bills,"
Alles said, counting the advan
tages of graduation.
