# Grads find 'freedom' far from home
##

Between overcoming cultural barriers,
obtaining a work permit, and finding time to
visit distant family, international students
have post-graduation worries beyond the tra
ditional "job or graduate school" dilemma.
Senior Radah Rangarajan said she is going
to use the next year as a time to reconcile her
traditional Indian culture with the feminist
studies courses she took at Stanford by work
ing at a magazine in India. Eventually, she
hopes to come back to Stanford for graduate
school.
Rangarajan said that the hardest part of
being an international student was adjusting
to a completely new culture, which included
things as common as coin-operated washing
machines and automatic teller machines.
"I was fairly protected when I was growing
up, and the first thing I realized when I came
here was I was completely on my own," she

said. "I shied away from a bit of life's experi
ences.
"For me, [Stanford] was home in America
and there was no place else to go," she said,
adding that often she felt "lost" because of
Stanford's size.
For Anthony Alles, though, an Australian
student graduating with a MBA, his culture
does not differ very much from Stanford's.
"From a quality of life standpoint, I miss
Australia," he said. "It is almost identical to
this place but a lot cheaper."
One of the few regrets Alles had about com
ing to Stanford is the cost, which was an espe
cially big shock since education in Australia is
free, he said.
Senior Omphemetse Mooki said he had a
very different perspective than other under
graduates because of his life in South Africa.
His education at Stanford gave him a model to
compare to the public school system there, he
said.
Mooki, who majored in immunology and

microbiology, said he would never have come
here directly from South Africa, and only
learned of Stanford through the private
boarding school in the United States he
attended on scholarship.
His future plans include a lot more school
before returning to South Africa to teach. Next
year he is attending Oxford University to work
towards a master's degree in microbiology.
"My goal is to go back home and try to
make students aware of some of the benefits
I've had studying abroad," he said.
Far from home
However, not every one wants to go back
home. Costis Skiadas, a Greek student gradu
ating with his Ph.D. in Operations Research,
said he has also always wanted to stay in this
country to work. Next year, he will fulfill that
wish by teaching at Northwestern Universi
ty's Kellogg School of Business.
