# Coming out to reality
## 
### Tom Shepard 
I forget sometimes what a unique envi
ronment Stanford is. Where else can you
attend talks by Angela Davis, William Buck
ley and Jesse Jackson all in the same week?
But as someone who struggled in this envi
ronment for three years — coming out as
bisexual, feeling alienated in my freshman
dormitory, feeling silenced in my singing
group, feeling excluded in classes in which
compulsory heterosexuality was an unchal
lenged norm — I certainly have harbored
my share of cynicism toward Stanford. But
I came out. What is it about this communi
ty that provided enough safety to reveal my
deepest secrets?

Part of it, I realize, is an atmosphere in
which students and faculty are encouraged
to challenge the status quo, to name dis
criminatory behaviors and policies and to
propose change. It is this kind of atmo
sphere which prompted the curricular over
haul made in the Western Culture program;
it is this kind of atmosphere which has pro
gressively increased enrollment of minority
students and faculty at Stanford; and it is
this kind of atmosphere which enabled the
establishment of Queerland, a campus
activist group committed to increasing the
visibility of gay, lesbian and bisexual people.
Why Queerland? Many people around

here accept homosexuality as long
as it doesn't involve them; as long
as it's over there — "not in my
backyard." I know several people
who are out to their families and
yet their homosexuality is never
discussed.
The parents know their chil
dren are gay and never ask them
about same-sex relationships or
their involvement in gay activi
ties.
The children, in turn, never
volunteer any discussion of their
gay identity. It's as if "it" doesn't
exist, even if "it" was proclaimed.
At a societal level, this attitude
keeps many people from coming
out.
A mere intellectual acknowl
edgement of homosexuality main
tains a safe distance from the real
issues at hand. It does little to
examine the roots of homophobia
and heterosexism that pervade
our culture. It does not ask the
basic question: What is it that is
so threatening about men loving
men and women loving women?
The implications of publicly
coming out and openly discussing
this question are not radical. For
one thing, a redefinition of the
American family might finally
emerge.
In an era in which family com
position has become extremely
diverse — single-parent families,
extended step-parents and step
siblings, commune spaces and of
course gay and lesbian families —
maybe we can finally get rid of the

Beaver Cleaver image of the
American family, an ideal which
is continually perpetuated by the
media.
By ignoring the existence of
gay and lesbian families, some can
pretend that such an unrealistic
ideal exists.
By not fully acknowledging the
diversity of relationships in soci
ety and the value of those rela
tionships, we run the risk of pro
tecting a mythic status quo and
thus perpetuating a hegemonic
ideology — that of a two parent,
heterosexual family.
Do we want to live our lives
under ideologies which complete
ly dismiss real human beings? In
terms of race, class and gender,
we've been doing it for so long
that maybe we don't know any
other way.
I, for one, want people to know
about same-sex relationships. So
Queerland and other organiza
tions, like the Bisexual, Gay, Les
bian Alliance at Stanford, get out
there and educate people. We cre
ate classes and hold conferences.
We organize events and speakers
and produce informative litera
ture. We speak out in classrooms
and dormitories in the hopes of
educating people and dispelling
myths about homosexuality and
bisexuality. We organize safer-sex
workshops — workshops that
both straight and gay people uti
lize. We coalesce with campus
groups to discuss how heterosex
ism intersects with other oppres
sions. And we throw great parties.
While it is sometimes disheart
ening to see our fliers torn down
by our own resident assistants, or
to hear bombastic name-calling as

we enter the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center, or
to clip stories about gay bashing
in nearby Redwood City, or to
hear about gay-related suicides
(which outnumber any other
teenage suicides), we are still
using the most powerful ammuni
tion possible — education. And if
several people "come out" as a
result of our work, then it is
worthwhile. If straight friends
become more informed regarding
queer oppression, then our work
is substantiated.
This has been the most excit
ing process for me in college. And
although there exist many gaps at
Stanford — for example, the
establishment of a Gay, Lesbian,
and Bisexual Studies program
like that of UC-Santa Cruz —
there exists, at very least, an
atmosphere of questioning and
listening. I wish this community
had existed when some of these
issues came up for me in high
school. I wish this community
existed for everyone who ques
tions basic heterosexual experi
ence.
Yet Stanford does not repre
sent the real world. I am remind
ed of this as I prepare to graduate
and visit my home town, where
the Colorado for Family Values is
currently passing out anti-gay
petitions in businesses and
schools throughout the city. And
people are signing them.
