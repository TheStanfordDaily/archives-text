# Coming out to reality

### Tom Shepard 
I forget sometimes what a unique envi
ronment Stanford is. Where else can you
attend talks by Angela Davis, William Buck
ley and Jesse Jackson all in the same week?
But as someone who struggled in this envi
ronment for three years — coming out as
bisexual, feeling alienated in my freshman
dormitory, feeling silenced in my singing
group, feeling excluded in classes in which
compulsory heterosexuality was an unchal
lenged norm — I certainly have harbored
my share of cynicism toward Stanford. But
I came out. What is it about this communi
ty that provided enough safety to reveal my
deepest secrets?

Part of it, I realize, is an atmosphere in
which students and faculty are encouraged
to challenge the status quo, to name dis
criminatory behaviors and policies and to
propose change. It is this kind of atmo
sphere which prompted the curricular over
haul made in the Western Culture program;
it is this kind of atmosphere which has pro
gressively increased enrollment of minority
students and faculty at Stanford; and it is
this kind of atmosphere which enabled the
establishment of Queerland, a campus
activist group committed to increasing the
visibility of gay, lesbian and bisexual people.
Why Queerland? Many people around
