# Stanford is still sexist
## 
### d'Layne L. Kerr 
Reflecting on my four years at Stanford,
I had a difficult time deciding on one thing
to write about. Then I heard about Keith
Archuleta and I had a whole series of reac
tions. How could someone who has done so
much for the black community turn around
and, by his actions, ignore a whole set of
other issues?
I thought about the ways in which this
society forces people to isolate issues into
separate categories so that those striving for
racial equality and justice may be completely
unaware of gender inequality and injustice.
I find it interesting that when women
come together to talk about women's issues

and self-defense, they are said to be alienat
ing men. But if men get together to look at
the swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated .. .
well, that's different.
I can't tell you how many people have told
me sexism doesn't really exist at Stanford.
Unfortunately it does, both explicitly
and implicitly.
Here are some examples of ways in which
women's issues are not addressed — and even
sometimes blatantly ignored — at Stanford:
•Senior Stuart Thomas was convicted of
statutory rape of a fresh woman after a
party in Casa Zapata and was given proba
tion.
