# Stanford is still sexist
## 
### d'Layne L. Kerr 
Reflecting on my four years at Stanford,
I had a difficult time deciding on one thing
to write about. Then I heard about Keith
Archuleta and I had a whole series of reac
tions. How could someone who has done so
much for the black community turn around
and, by his actions, ignore a whole set of
other issues?
I thought about the ways in which this
society forces people to isolate issues into
separate categories so that those striving for
racial equality and justice may be completely
unaware of gender inequality and injustice.
I find it interesting that when women
come together to talk about women's issues

and self-defense, they are said to be alienat
ing men. But if men get together to look at
the swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated .. .
well, that's different.
I can't tell you how many people have told
me sexism doesn't really exist at Stanford.
Unfortunately it does, both explicitly
and implicitly.
Here are some examples of ways in which
women's issues are not addressed — and even
sometimes blatantly ignored — at Stanford:
•Senior Stuart Thomas was convicted of
statutory rape of a fresh woman after a
party in Casa Zapata and was given proba
tion.


d'Layne Kerr
• Less than 10 percent of
tenured faculty at Stanford are
women.
• One female student received
repeated, unsolicited and unde
sired phone calls from a professor
who asked her out insistently.

• Keith Archuleta, Stanford
Assistant Dean of Students and
Resident Faculty, is arrested for
videotaping female students
undressing.
• In a survey conducted last
year, 32 percent of women at
Stanford reported they have been
coerced into vaginal, oral or anal
intercourse.
• When a man allegedly assault
ed a fellow female dorm resident,

University housing would not
remove the perpetrator. But when
a student steals compact discs
from other students' rooms, he is
kicked out of housing within a day.
Where, when does it end?
I wrote this to make people
aware of the many ways sexism
exists here at Stanford, a place that
emphasizes equal opportunity and
multiculturalism. I want people to
recognize even the subtle, seeming

ly innocent examples because now
we are graduating and heading out
into the "real world" where it is
even more pervasive.
I do not want to alienate men.
Both men and women need to be
aware of the subtleties of gender
expectations, discrimination and
oppression so we all can begin to
end them. Both men and women
are negatively impacted.
Therefore, we must get away

from thinking about these issues as
women'B issues. The gender catego
ry is similar to race, ethnicity, sexu
al orientation, socio-economic class,
religion, physical ability, age and all
the other categories in which we
place people. One cannot advocate
gender equality without also fight
ing for gay rights or improving the
status of children in America or jus
tice for all racial and ethnic groups.
For political efficiency, people
often try to separate human rights
issues into categories to be

addressed one at a time. For exam
ple, womej? who are sexually
assaulted are told to "keep it quiet"
if it might divide a racial communi
ty. We need to stop trying to sepa
rate all the issues into neat little
categories. Gender. Race. Sexual
orientation. Physical disability.
And all the other ways we separate
and divide people and issues. They
are all human rights issues.
