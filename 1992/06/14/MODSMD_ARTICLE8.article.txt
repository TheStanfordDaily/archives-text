# Playing resume roulette
## Grads fight losing battle for gainful employment 
### Holly Hacker Senior staff writer 
Craig Klugman doesn't know what he's
doing after graduation.
The senior anthropology major applied
to graduate school last fall but later decid
ed that a Ph.D. in anthropology wasn't for
him. So over the past month, he's mailed
out 198 resumes.
And so far, he's received 75 rejection
letters.
Wayne Chavez, a senior in American
Studies, said he applied to more than 30
accounting and management consulting
firms. He received only one job offer, but
turned that down because "I would have
been selling myself short," he said.
Chavez eventually found a position with a
consulting firm in Ecuador, but he could be
let go at any time. Even though he has no job
security, Chavez said it was easier to find a
job in a third-world country than in the U.S.
Klugman and Chavez are far from being
anomalies in the Class of 1992. As the job
market continues to look dismal, seniors
are having a tougher time than ever finding
a way to put their $90,000 degrees to use.
At the same time, many seniors have
lost interest in the careers they'd planned
to pursue.
Chavez, for example, had planned to go
to law school. But the summer before his
senior year, he realized he didn't want to
become an attorney.
He switched gears and put himself on
what he called "the CPPC track" — the
process of sending out resumes and inter
viewing with various firms.
During the winter quarter, Chavez
said, the time he spent job-hunting "was
the equivalent of a 10-unit class."
But his work yielded only one offer, which

would have had him "crunching numbers
like your stereotypical accountant." He
turned down that job and, on a last-minute
whim, applied for the job in Ecuador.
Another senior, Peter Chessick, is so
discouraged by the prospects of finding a
job in the U.S. that he's decided to go
abroad in search of work.
An international relations major, Ches
sick said he'd initially planned to visit Rus
sia before looking for a job in Washington,
D.C., preferably with the State Department.
But, after some initial inquiries, Ches
sick realized that finding a job in D.C.
"would take months and months of time
and a lot of work. That's not my scene."
So after spending the summer teaching
English in Prague, Chessick plans to go to
Russia and take it from there.
Fierce competition
Other graduating seniors are limited not
just by the economy, but also by the fierce
ly competitive nattire of their chosen fields.
Senior Jason Gische said that even as a
computer science major at "one of the best
institutions in the country" — in the heart of
the Silicon Valley, no less — he can't get a job.
"Most people I've sent resumes to
haven't responded at all," he said.
And while he said he's not panicking,
Gische said he is "definitely frustrated."
Not only must he find a way to support
himself, he also has to start paying back
hundreds of dollars in student loans.
But Gische is determined. "I will con
tinue to look for a job until I find one," he
said.
Jen Derwingson, an English major,
wants to work in theater as a writer or
director. The field is already notoriously
difficult to enter, and the reces
sion has made it even tougher,
Derwingson said. Many small the
aters are having financial prob
lems, and internships which used
to pay now do not. Derwingson
said she never expected to "hop
into a job right away."
After spending the summer
working with a theater company
in Bali, Derwingson will return to
the U.S. or possibly go to Eng
land. "I just want to see what hap
pens," she said.
Jonathan Morrill, a senior in

economics and history, said his
dream job would be playing full
time with the band he helped form
a year and a half ago. But, given
the tough nature of the music
business, he's been looking for
more conventional work.
But Morrill has yet to find such
a job.
Nonetheless, his spirits remain
relatively high. After spending two
weeks at home in New York after
graduation, Morrill said he will
return to the Bay Area, "find some
where to crash and look for jobs."
"Whatever happens will hap
pen," Morrill said. At worst, he
said, he can always go back to
Haagen Dazs, where he worked in
high school.

In the face of unemployment,
some seniors have found a way to
laugh at themselves. Last quarter,
several residents of the American
Studies House started a "wall of
rejection," plastering their rejec
tion letters over a large portion of
a third-floor hallway.
Participants kept score of who
had the most rejections. To further
ease the pain, they highlighted or
commented on portions of letters
they found particularly insulting.
"It found it to be a very cathar
tic experience," said Chavez, who
received the most rejections.
"You're really revealing yourself
and saying, 'Look, I failed,' but at
the same time you're saying, "I
can take it.' "

ed that a Ph.D. in anthropology wasn't for
him. So over the past month, he's mailed
out 198 resumes.
And so far, he's received 75 rejection
letters.
Wayne Chavez, a senior in American
Studies, said he applied to more than 30
accounting and management consulting
firms. He received only one job offer, but
turned that down because "I would have
been selling myself short," he said.
Chavez eventually found a position with a
consulting firm in Ecuador, but he could be
let go at any time. Even though he has no job
security, Chavez said it was easier to find a
job in a third-world country than in the U.S.
Klugman and Chavez are far from being
anomalies in the Class of 1992. As the job
market continues to look dismal, seniors
are having a tougher time than ever finding
a way to put their $90,000 degrees to use.
At the same time, many seniors have
lost interest in the careers they'd planned
to pursue.
Chavez, for example, had planned to go
to law school. But the summer before his
senior year, he realized he didn't want to
become an attorney.
He switched gears and put himself on
what he called "the CPPC track" — the
process of sending out resumes and inter
viewing with various firms.
During the winter quarter, Chavez
said, the time he spent job-hunting "was
the equivalent of a 10-unit class."
But his work yielded only one offer, which

would have had him "crunching numbers
like your stereotypical accountant." He
turned down that job and, on a last-minute
whim, applied for the job in Ecuador.
Another senior, Peter Chessick, is so
discouraged by the prospects of finding a
job in the U.S. that he's decided to go
abroad in search of work.
An international relations major, Ches
sick said he'd initially planned to visit Rus
sia before looking for a job in Washington,
D.C., preferably with the State Department.
But, after some initial inquiries, Ches
sick realized that finding a job in D.C.
"would take months and months of time
and a lot of work. That's not my scene."
So after spending the summer teaching
English in Prague, Chessick plans to go to
Russia and take it from there.
Fierce competition
Other graduating seniors are limited not
just by the economy, but also by the fierce
ly competitive nattire of their chosen fields.
Senior Jason Gische said that even as a
computer science major at "one of the best
institutions in the country" — in the heart of
the Silicon Valley, no less — he can't get a job.
"Most people I've sent resumes to
haven't responded at all," he said.
And while he said he's not panicking,
Gische said he is "definitely frustrated."
Not only must he find a way to support
himself, he also has to start paying back
hundreds of dollars in student loans.
But Gische is determined. "I will con
tinue to look for a job until I find one," he
said.
Jen Derwingson, an English major,
wants to work in theater as a writer or
director. The field is already notoriously
difficult to enter, and the reces
sion has made it even tougher,
Derwingson said. Many small the
aters are having financial prob
lems, and internships which used
to pay now do not. Derwingson
said she never expected to "hop
into a job right away."
After spending the summer
working with a theater company
in Bali, Derwingson will return to
the U.S. or possibly go to Eng
land. "I just want to see what hap
pens," she said.
Jonathan Morrill, a senior in

economics and history, said his
dream job would be playing full
time with the band he helped form
a year and a half ago. But, given
the tough nature of the music
business, he's been looking for
more conventional work.
But Morrill has yet to find such
a job.
Nonetheless, his spirits remain
relatively high. After spending two
weeks at home in New York after
graduation, Morrill said he will
return to the Bay Area, "find some
where to crash and look for jobs."
"Whatever happens will hap
pen," Morrill said. At worst, he
said, he can always go back to
Haagen Dazs, where he worked in
high school.

In the face of unemployment,
some seniors have found a way to
laugh at themselves. Last quarter,
several residents of the American
Studies House started a "wall of
rejection," plastering their rejec
tion letters over a large portion of
a third-floor hallway.
Participants kept score of who
had the most rejections. To further
ease the pain, they highlighted or
commented on portions of letters
they found particularly insulting.
"It found it to be a very cathar
tic experience," said Chavez, who
received the most rejections.
"You're really revealing yourself
and saying, 'Look, I failed,' but at
the same time you're saying, "I
can take it.' "
