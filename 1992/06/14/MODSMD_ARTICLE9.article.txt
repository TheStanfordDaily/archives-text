# Giving flight to fallen angels
## Memorial Church still closed for repairs, but not for long 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
A continuous string of Satur
day weddings and midnight organ
music will return to the Quad
when Stanford's most famous
and cherished building — Memo
rial Church — loses the web of
scaffolding that has surrounded it
for more than a year in order to
reopen this fall.

Extensive renovations on
Memorial Church will be finished
at the end of September after the
completion of repairs to damage
suffered during the Loma Prieta
earthquake of October 1989.
Repairs on the church, which
suffered considerable structural
and cosmetic damage, began in
July 1991.
According to Project Director
Olivier Pieron, all of the struc
tural work is completed, and the
construction team is concentrat
ing on cosmetic repairs, electrical
work and lighting.

Pieron said the team is now
working on the Round Room roof
structure and finishing the
mosaics at the top of the four main
arches of the church's crossing.
One of the main goals of the ren
ovation was to prevent the four
angel mosaics from collapsing by
strengthening supports at the top
of the four main arches of the
church's crossing.
This is where the majority of the

construction was concentrated
because this area was not rebuilt
after the quake of 1906.
The renovation also includes
the restoration of the stucco in
the dome, the repair of the rail
ings and stone masonry, the
replacement of cork flooring and
the reopening of all balconies.
Pieron said the renovation has
gone as planned and that no
major problems have occurred.
"We're still within our bud
get,"he added.
The construction is being paid
for by a $10 million fund estab

lished in Septemberl99o to repair
the church. The fund is currently
about $50,000 short of reaching
its goal, according to Elizabeth
Sloan, Office Of Development
Communications director.
She said $8.5 million is part of
the renovation fund and the
remaining $1.5 million is part of
an innovative maintenance
endowment fund which will pay
for maintenance costs such as
upkeep of the stained glass win
dows and cleaning costs.
In addition to the reopening of
the church, the balconies, which
had been closed for 20 years for
not meeting fire codes, will reopen
with new sprinkler systems and
an additional fire exit.
The work on Memorial Church
included additional strengthening
to ensure that in the event of
another earthquake, there
wouldn't be any life-threatening
accidents.
During the Loma Prieta quake,
a large portion of one of the
mosaics and several chunks of
stone broke loose and fell to the
ground. No one was hurt.
Three chunks of the northeast
angel mosaic which had fallen
during the quake and had been
taken as souvenirs were returned
anonymously to the church in
April in a shopping bag.
The broken section of the mosa
ic is about two feet by ten feet and
each of the returned chunks were
about one square foot. The
remaining gaps are expected to be
filled with new tiles from Venice.
Wedding reservations will not
be accepted until the wedding
coordinator returns on August 3,
and no weddings will take place
until November, according to stu
dent assistant Sara Willburn.
