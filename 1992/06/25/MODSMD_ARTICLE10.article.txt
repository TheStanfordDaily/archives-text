## Archuleta faces arraignment today 
### 
Former Asst. Dean of Students
Keith Archuleta will be arraigned
on four misdemeanor counts of
eavesdropping today for secretly
videotaping female students
changing clothes in his Mirrielees
apartment.

Archuleta
resigned his posi
tion June 2, days
after he was
arrested by
Stanford Police
for allegedly
videotaping sever
al women during
various still pho
tography sessions

in his apartment.
Tapes confiscated from
Archuleta's apartment show
women fully clothed, partially
clothed and nude, according to
the Stanford Police's report of
their investigation.
Some of the tapes also depict
consensual sex acts involving
Archuleta, according to the
report.
He will be arraigned this
morning in municipal court in
Palo Alto. Archuleta faces a maxi
mum of four years in jail and a
$10,000 fine for the four counts.
Only six of the female students
and staff members who were
identified by police from the tapes
wished to press charges, the
report said.
Police first learned of the tap
ings after one of the victims, a
female student who lived in
Mirrielees, stole some of the
videocassettes and gave them to
the police.
According to the report,
Archuleta asked the woman, an
acquaintance of his, to pose for a
still photo session at his apart
ment. Archuleta told her the pho
tos would be used for a portfolio
of black women.
The victim was asked by
Archuleta to bring various out
fits, including short sundresses,
high heels and brightly colored
clothing.
When the woman needed to
change clothing between poses,
Archuleta would leave the inner
room of his two-bedroom apart
ment, the location of the photo
shoot. The victim told the police
she never changed in front of
Archuleta.
During the photo session, the
victim noticed a video camera sit
ting on a VCR on top of a television
in the room. As the shoot pro
gressed, the victim noticed that the
video camera was repositioned by
Archuleta when she changed poses,
allowing the camera a full view of
her exposed undergarments.
The victim, according to the
report, became alarmed and quick
ly left Archuleta's apartment.
The following day the victim
contacted Residence Dean Alice
Supton and set up an appoint
ment with her for the following
week. Later that day, however,
the victim became curious about
the video camera and tapes and
decided to attempt to inspect
them, according to the report.
The victim borrowed a master
key from a resident assistant
under the pretext that she was
locked out of her room. She
entered Archuleta's apartment
with her roommate when he was
away and searched for the video
tapes, the report said.
After some time, the woman
found some unmarked videotapes
in a desk drawer with sex toys and
condoms. The victim took two tapes
she believed contained footage of
herself. After viewing the tapes
with her boyfriend, the victim gave
the evidence to Stanford Police,
who then arrested Archuleta.
Archuleta did not return sev
eral phone calls yesterday. His
attorney, Tom Nolan, declined to
comment on the charges.
