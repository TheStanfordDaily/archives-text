# Freidenrich new board president

Silicon Valley venture capital
ist John Freidenrich was elected
president of the Board of
Trustees June 12. He predicts
that the next year will present a
"challenging" transition for the
University, but he said it should
be a "rewarding" experience.
Freidenrich will take over as
president July 1, replacing James
Gaither, who has headed the
board since 1988.
Gaither decided not to run for
reelection this year, after serving
three one-year terms. Freidenrich
praised Gaither's "tremendous
effort" as president, and added
that he is sure Gaither — after a
difficult year of budget-cutting —
is "looking forward to a some
what less active role."
But "budget issues and prob
lems" will remain a concern for
the board, Freidenrich said. The
operating budget accepted by the
trustees in April projected a $10-
$15 million annual deficit, despite
the $43 million of cuts already
put into place this year.

University
President Donald
Kennedy, howev
er, has said the
trustees are com
mitted to avoid
ing additional
academic cuts.
Freidenrich
said he also plans
to work with

incoming University President
Gerhard Casper and "be available
to help him in any way I can dur
ing the transition and the early
stages of his presidency."
Freidenrich, who has been a
board member since 1987, earned
two degrees from Stanford — his
bachelor's in economics in 1959
and his law degree in 1963.
He is a director of the Stanford
University Hospital and the
Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital and serves on the
Jewish Studies Program advisory
board.
In addition, Freidenrich was
national co-chair of the major
gifts committee of Stanford's
five-year Centennial Campaign,
which raised nearly $1.3 billion.
In 1968, Freidenrich helped
found the Palo Alto law firm
Ware and Freidenrich; eight
years later, he formed the Silicon
Valley venture capital firm Bay
Partners.
