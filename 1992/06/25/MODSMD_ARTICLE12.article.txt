# Four new trustees elected by alumni
## 
### 
Alumni have elected four new
members to the Board of
Trustees, selecting the most
diverse group in the 20 years
since they began voting for a por
tion of the board's membership.

The new mem
bers will officially
join the 30-person
board Sept. 1.
Their names were
announced by
Stanford Alumni
Association offi
cials earlier this
month, after the

organization con-

ducted a two-year search for appli
cants and handled the election.
San Diego attorney Michael
Perez, '87, is the first Latino
elected to the board. The election
of such a diverse group, Perez
said, is "a good thing," because
Stanford has a diverse student
population and the board should
reflect that.
But he added that he thinks
the new members were elected
not because of their ethnicity or
gender, but because of the quali
ties and skills they bring to the
board.
Mernoy Harrison, 4 69, an

administrator at California State
University-Sacramento, said
Stanford should gear its teaching
toward interests "outside of the
classroom" so that students
receive as broad an education as
possible.
Harrison is black, while the
two other elected members —
Anne Bingaman, '65, and
Mariann Byerwalter, '82 — are

women.
Bingaman, a
Washington,
D.C. lawyer, and
Harrison were
elected in the 36-
and-over catego
ry; Perez and
Byerwalter, a
partner with the
San Francisco-

based America First Financial
Corporation, were elected in the
35-and-under category.
The Alumni Association
divides the pool of candidates by
age and selects a nominating
committee that is roughly repre
sentative of Stanford's popula
tion in age, gender and ethnicity.
This procedure is "one
avenue" to diversify the board,
according to Peggy Gray, assis
tant to the president of the
Alumni Association.
The Board of Trustees has
final approval of the candidates
elected to the board, but allows
the Alumni Association to super
vise the entire election process.
"One of the things the trustees
like about our handling of the
process is that we bring the
diverse candidates to them,"
Gray said.
Eight slots on the board are
always filled by alumni-elected
members, who serve five-year
terms. The others are appointed
by the board's nominating com
mittee.
