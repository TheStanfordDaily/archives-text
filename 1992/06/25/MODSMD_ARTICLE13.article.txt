# Report: Reduce size of administration
## 
### 
Stanford's current administra
tive structure is large and
unwieldy, a Faculty Senate com
mittee reported at the June 11
meeting.
The Senate Committee on
Education and Scholarship at
Stanford reached that conclusion
in its final report on "Phase
Two," the proposed administra
tive restructuring of the
University.
The committee's report focus
es on three faculty concerns: the
administration, the School of
Humanities and Sciences and
undergraduate education.
Committee Chair Richard
Zare, who presented the report at
the meeting, said staff should be
delegated more power at lower
levels.
Staff who make decisions
should both be held responsible
and rewarded, he said.
The committee also recom
mended giving more voice on the
University Cabinet to the School
of Humanities and Sciences.
Other possibilities which the
committee said deserved consid
eration ranged from dividing
Humanities and Sciences into
three smaller schools of humani
ties, natural sciences and social
sciences, to investing more
resources and decision-making
power in the school's three senior
deans.
In undergraduate education,
the committee recommended
that Stanford appoint an official
advocate for undergraduate edu
cation who could protect it from
deeper budget cuts by using
such "real sources of influence"
as a budget and ability to con
tribute in faculty appointment
decisions.
Another idea is the creation of
a council of faculty members
drawn from schools and adminis
trative areas serving undergradu
ates.
Senate Chair James Sheehan

told the senate that the commit
tee's report will be discussed in
detail next year, as "long-range
developments begin to be thought
further about in a new year, by a
somewhat new cast of charac
ters."
Following one of the commit
tee's earlier recommendations,
the School of Humanities and
Sciences will form a faculty coun
cil of its own through elections to
be held this summer.
