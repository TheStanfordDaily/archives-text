# Kennedy presented, with some fishy gifts
## 
### 
The Faculty Senate gave
University President Donald
Kennedy a warm tribute and a
prolonged standing ovation at his
final senate meeting as
Stanford's president.
English Prof. Nancy Packer,
History Prof. David Kennedy and
Psychology Prof. Albert Hastorf
made presentations during the
tribute two weeks ago. They also
gave Kennedy, an avid fisherman,
a fly-fishing rod and reel and sev
eral other fishing gifts.
Kennedy praised the role that
the faculty plays in governing the
University, citing the fact that
the president and provost are
publicly accountable to the senate
every two weeks.
"I don't believe there is anoth
er piece of academic governance
in the United States like this,"
Kennedy said.
He also thanked those profes
sors who at times have criticized
and challenged him in the sen
ate.
"There have been things said
in the senate that I haven't want
ed to hear," Kennedy said, citing
a particularly hard-hitting report
on the state of humanities, prod
ding on indirect costs and English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz's "repeated
urgings that we remember to do
the right thing."
"That's been a real important
element in the life of this place,
and we would have been much
poorer without it," Kennedy said.
In other business, the senate
unanimously approved the
Graduate Program in the
Humanities for the maximum
five years.
After redesigning its core
requirements over the last two
years, the program received a
"very strong" recommendation
from the Committee on Graduate
Studies.
Outgoing Senate Chair James
Sheehan, a history professor,
was thanked for his leadership
during the last year, especially
during the senate's contentious
budget discussions.
Pediatrics Prof. William
Northway, the chair-elect,
praised Sheehan's ability to
"relieve the tension which was
associated with these difficult
issues" and "promote and focus
discussions without limiting
them."
