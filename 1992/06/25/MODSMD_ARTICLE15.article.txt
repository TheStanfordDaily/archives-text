# Student commits suicide in Chicago
## 
### 
Junior Charles Cargill, a phi
losophy major from Millwood,
N.Y., committed suicide at
Chicago's O'Hare Airport June
13. The 21-year-old Cargill hung
himself in a basement room of
the airport, according to Chicago
police.
Cargill had been experiencing
substance abuse problems for
several years, said his mother,
Susan Cargill. Prior to his death,
Cargill had telephoned his par
ents and explained that his alco
hol and drug problems had
become uncontrollable.
Cargill was in Chicago on a
layover on a flight home from
San Francisco.
Cargill's substance abuse "had

been a long-term problem that
had been growing," said Susan
Cargill. "But he kept it well hid
den from everybody."
Cargill stopped out of Stanford
spring quarter and was living in
San Francisco.
Susan Cargill said his alcohol
problems probably began in high
school but increased during the
last year.
Three days before his death,
Cargill told his parents in a tele
phone conversation "his life was
out of control," said his mother.
At the time, he sounded rational
and expressed a desire to enter a
rehabilitation program.
"We're very, very at a loss to
explain what happened on the
way from San Francisco," she
said.
Cargill was interested in the
environment and wanted to
attend law school after graduat
ing.
He also enjoyed playing the
violin and performing in a rock
band. He was a member of the
Alpha Delta Phi fraternity.
"He was a really special per
son," Susan Cargill said. "This
is very hard to understand for
us."
He is survived by his parents,
Slade and Susan Cargill; a sister,
Elizabeth King of Syracuse, N.Y.;
and a grandmother, Elizabeth
Harris of Union City, Ga.
