# Long, Schneider awarded MacArthurs
## 
### 
Two Stanford biology profes
sors were awarded more than
$250,000 each last week as recipi
ents of the prestigious
Mac Arthur Fellowships.
Sharon Long and Stephen
Schneider were honored by the
Mac Arthur Foundation for their
contributions to science and can
spend the prize money as they
desire.
Unlike other grants, the

money does not
have to be tar
geted toward a
specific research
project. But both
scientists said
they will dedi
cate most of
their award to
further their
research.

Long, who is in her eleventh
year at Stanford, said she will use
the prize to study new technolo
gies in chemistry, microbiology
and image analysis.
"Training myself in new tech
nologies is the best investment I
could make," she said.
She said she also plans to
donate 15 percent of the fellow
ship to a church program that
tutors East Palo Alto teenagers in
reading.
Long, who teaches in the biolo
gy core and graduate level plant
biochemistry, studies the symbi
otic relationships between bacte
ria and legumes.
The results of Long's research
may someday allow farmers to
treat specific crops without allow
ing pests to acquire resistance or
assisting the growth of undesired
plant species.
Schneider was a visiting pro
fessor on leave from the National
Center for Atmospheric Research
in Boulder, Colo., last year, and
he will become a permanent
member of the faculty this fall.
He said he will use his award
to establish his laboratory at
Stanford and continue his
research in climatology.
Schneider will spend the sum
mer in the North Pole releasing
buoys as part of an international
study on the environment.
His research also focuses on
the effects of climate war ming on
the northern ranges of birds and
how this disrupts ecological com
munities.
