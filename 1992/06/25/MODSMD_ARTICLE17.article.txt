# Crossing the Bayshore Divide

On one end of University Avenue,
people "can buy any kind of dope
they want," said Jim Burklo, a
local minister. "There's some pretty
heavy duty poverty, police problems, a
disproportionate number of people on
food stamps."
And just across the highway lies
Stanford.
The proximity of Stanford to East Palo
Alto has fostered a relationship that has
been both long-standing and multi
faceted. For more than 20 years, many
students from Stanford have lived,
worked and volunteered in East Palo
Alto.
"East Palo Alto has so many needs,"
said Frances Morales, director of El
Centro Chicano. "It provides a great
opportunity for a relationship to devel

op.
However, tensions can develop
between the two communities. Stanford
students' well-meaning service programs
do not always mesh with the needs and
wishes of East Palo Alto residents.
Helping can be "tricky" at times, said
Tim Stanton, acting director of the Haas
Center for Public Service. He said that
volunteers sometimes unintentionally act
in ways that seem condescending or hurt
ful to those they are trying to help.
There is a "fierce pride and indepen
dence in East Palo Alto," Stanton said.
He added that while Stanford students
should help as much as possible, "the
help should be controlled by East Palo
Alto."
Although the city is poor in resources,
it is rich in culture and history — a point
that some volunteers tend to overlook,
Burklo said. He also directs the Urban
Ministry of Palo Alto, an organization
which provides services to homeless in
the area.
"The developed politics, history and
culture [of East Palo Alto] need to be
worked with," he said. "The place is not
just some kind of blank slate that people
can write their social programs on."
Burklo, who once taught a SWOPSI

course on homelessness, added that vol
unteers must show respect for the city's
history and "learn the ways of the land"
when they offer aid.
Some students have approached com
munity service with "paternalistic, inter
ventionists" attitudes, he said. An atti

they're out there and
not do anything about
it.'

between them is the most fruitful way for
both parties to bridge the gap that sepa
rates them.
Stanford graduate Magdalena Fatoria,
who now works in East Palo Alto, said
some East Palo Alto residents are skepti
cal about Stanford's commitment to their
community because often it has been "too
short-term" in the past.
Stanton, who has overseen students'
volunteer activities at Haas for six years,
also said there is "not enough concern for
continuity on Stanford's part."
Volunteers "kind of came and went,"
Fatoria added.
She said the University should main
tain more consistent contact with East
Palo Alto and "recognize a larger commu
nity as [its] own."
"It's easier for Stanford to separate
itself" from a city like East Palo Alto
because the University is not directly
located in an urban area, Fatoria added.
But service in East Palo Alto is "a little
different" for many members of the black
and Latino communities, according to

Joyce King, who graduated from Stanford
in 1969.
While they still face obstacles in their
service endeavors, many members of
these communities also possess a unique
advantage —insight that comes from hav
ing lived in similar places.
East Palo Alto's population of 23,500
is approximately 43 percent black and 32
percent Latino.
Economically privileged students may
have a slightly different approach to ser
vice in cities like East Palo Alto than stu
dents "whose families are still there,"
King said.
"A lot [of Latino students] came from
communities that also didn't have the
opportunities," Morales said. "I think
students still want to maintain the con
nection to the community," she added.
Senior Angela Hilton, community ser
vice coordinator at the Black House, said
many black students also "know these
kinds of areas."
Black students felt an especially close
tie with East Palo Alto in the 19605,
when Stanford's black population barely
reached 1 percent.
For King, moving to East Palo Alto as
a sophomore at that time was "very nat
ural." The community offered her a place
where she could "feel at home," she said.
Hilton said, "There are so many of our
people in East Palo Alto who are on
drugs, dropping out. We can't just sit by
and know that they're out there and not
do anything about it.
"When I East Palo Alto] is the closest
black community [to Stanford] and it's in
so much trouble, you can't help but won
der what to do to help," she continued.
In the fall, black students will launch a
new program in East Palo Alto called the
Nia Community Project. "Nia" is a word
that means "purpose" in Swahili.
The project is aimed at increasing the
graduation rate of black students in the
Ravenswood City School District through
long-term student tutorial arrangements.
But Hilton added that the goal of black
Stanford students is "not to stay in East
Palo Alto forever, but to help East Palo
Alto get to a point where it can help
itself."
