# Teens share EPASSA experience

Melinda Esquivel and Jody Goundar, two teenagers participat
ing in the East Palo Alto Stanford Summer Academy, ponder gov
ernment, racial issues and teen-aged boys as they eagerly wait for
their next class after lunch outside Wilbur Hall.
While they do not come from particularly privileged or educa
tionally elite backgrounds, their views on politics, people and their
own futures reflect a diverse sense of awareness of their surround
ings.
Most government officials "have never been poor before, and
they've never been hungry before," Melinda, 13, said, explaining her
frustrations with the government.
Jody vocied a similar sentiment, adding that "none of the presi
dential candidates are qualified" enough to lead the country.
Through the summer academy, taught by Stanford students,
Melinda and Jody said they've enjoyed many experiences and
opportunities that they otherwise would not have had in their
schools.
The academy combines classes with personal growth workshops
and recreation programs to create a diverse educational experience
for seventh and eighth grade students from the surrounding school
districts.
"We get to do everything here, try everything here," Melinda
beamed with a smile of satisfaction. She explained that her school
is underfunded. "In school there's a big class and one teacher. It's
hard for them to pay attention to you."
Jody and Melinda, who both returned to the academy for a sec
ond summer, agreed that the workshops — which address various
issues such as drugs, self-esteem and sex education— offer them
unique opportunities to communicate with peers.
"In school you talk mostly among your friends" and not a larger
group of students your own age, Melinda said.
Jody then chimed in with a simpler version of problems in her
school "We don't have enough garbage cans."
Another problem with school is that "people don't pay atten
tion," Melinda added.
At the academy, each student is assigned an individual tutor
who helps them with homework, listens to their personal problems
and occasionally takes them on outings in the city.
"The tutors are like older brothers and sisters," Melinda said,
adding that she discussed "boy problems, friends, family" and her
future with her tutor.
"They understand what we are talking about," she said.
"They're not like our teachers."
Melinda recalled taking a trip to San Francisco with her tutor to
view and learn about different buildings, after she had told her
tutor she wanted to be an architect.
But that was a year ago. "Now I want to be an author and screen
writer," she said, giggling at her capricious nature.
Jody said she is currently wavering between becoming a pediatri
cian or an animal trainer.

For LaTanya Reed, 13, this will be her first summer in the acad
emy. She is hoping to enjoy an experience similar to that of the two
year veterans.
LaTanya said she would like to feel more confident about herself
and "not be embarassed" so much.
Jody said she feels more confident in herself now, because of
various experiences and discussions she has had with her past acad
emy tutor.
"The power to achieve is the power to believe,'" she said, recit
ing an inspirational rhyme her tutor told her.
Jody said she also makes up her own rhymes. "I write about
love, death and fairy tale poems," she said.
Melinda vocalized her shared interest in writing, eagerly volun
teering an account of her sixth grade language arts project in which
she wrote a story called "Superpup" and then read it to a kinder
garten class.
Having clearly expressed her interest in language and literature
Melinda eventually explains her views on free speech and the recent
Supreme Court ruling on fighting words.
"I'm for freedom of speech so long as it doesn't hurt anybody,"
she said. But Melinda added that "if you start banning things, you
will end up banning everything, and nobody's gonna hear what we
really feel."
