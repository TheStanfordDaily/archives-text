# Tutors close educational gap

Senior Roberto Lara is frustrated
with the Stanford community.
Lara, a coordinator for Barrio
Assistance — one of several
Stanford programs that tutor East
Palo Alto students — said he
believes not enough people are inter
ested in balancing the numerous
inequities between Stanford and
East Palo Alto.
In spite of the programs that do
exist, such as Barrio Assistance,
East Palo Alto Summer Academy
and Upward Bound, Lara said he
senses apathy among many Stanford
students.
He added that he is surprised at
how "people have taken such a long
time to awaken" to the socio-eco
nomic disadvantages that plague
East Palo Alto. "The problems have
always been there, but Stanford stu
dents are so detached."
Lara, who used to live in East
Palo Alto, said that he uses Barrio
Assistance as an outlet for his
"angry energy."
Bridging the Barrio gap
Barrio Assistance is a tutoring pro
gram that focuses mostly on Latino
children from immigrant families.
But more attention is given to
interpersonal relationships and
motivation than to academics,
according to senior Lucila Ek, one of
the program's five coordinators.
Each of the 55 children in the
program is matched to a Stanford
student, and they meet every
Saturday for breakfast, an hour and
a half of tutoring and then a 30-
minute arts and crafts session.

Ek noted that "many of the kids
are doubly deficient in Spanish and
English."
East Palo Alto student Salomo
Chavez said, "Sometimes we read
ancient history or comic books and if
I don't understand some of the
words [my tutor] tells me what they
mean and how to pronounce them."
Barrio Assistance concentrates on
immigrant children because "they
don't get what kids normally get in
elementary school," said sophomore
Arturo Soria, a third coordinator.
"The system in [East Palo Altol is
messed up . . . little money, few
teachers — we provide extra support
so they can stay on par."
Following the acadcmic track
East Palo Alto Stanford Summer
Academy targets seventh and eighth
graders in an enrichment program
that "has a very strong academic
emphasis," according to junior
Shana Keenan, who directs the pro
gram.
In the summer the academy spon
sors a six-week seminar for the stu
dents that supplements what stu
dents have learned in school. During
the school year, each participant
receives tutoring from a Stanford
mentor once a week.
Mentor Eva Silva said she felt
the additional contact the academy
has with the students over the sum
mer gives the tutors more exposure
to them. "You get the chance to get
to know them better and have more
of an impact on them."
While the emphasis is placed on
academics, the academy's main goal
is to "spark [in the kids] some
excitement" for learning, Keenan
said. The hope is that the students
will continue on to Upward Bound

— a similar program for high school
students.
Although there are no formal ties
between the two groups,
Upward Bound Director Arcadio
Morales said that he has "a nice
pipeline envisioned where the transi
tion [between the academy to
Upward Bound] is perfect."
Onward and upward
Upward Bound aims to get
Hispanic high school students from
East Palo Alto into college.
The tutoring program, which
starts in the ninth grade, aids stu
dents in personal development,
assists them with the college prepa
ration process and helps students
obtain housing and financial aid.
"The tutor and student form
close bonds," said sophomore Oanh
Maroney, who coordinates the
tutors.
"There is a lot of trust involved
and this family aspect makes a dif
ference."
Ninety percent of the high school
seniors in Upward Bound go on to
four-year colleges.
"The program is more than show
ing up three hours a week every
Saturday — it's getting involved in a
kid's life," said Director Arcadio
Morales.
He added that tutoring is "tai
lored to each student's needs."
Through talks with the teachers at
the student's school, certain areas
are earmarked for improvement.
"We don't have the attitude that
we're going in there and telling the
community how to function,"
Morales said. "We're responding to a
need the community says they have
— we don't pretend to know more
than them."
