## Keefe stolen by Hawks 
### Noah Blake Editorial staff 
Adam Keefe wasn't taken as
high in last night's NBA draft as
most people expected, but he may
have ended up better off.
The conventional wisdom had
Keefe going to either Denver,
Washington, or Sacramento,
teams with the fifth, sixth and
seventh picks respectively, as his
hard-nosed play, work ethic and
excellent post skills had suppos
edly moved him up in the draft.
But when these clubs, as well
as Milwaukee and Philadelphia,
passed on Keefe, he fell to Atlanta
with the tenth selection overall.
The Hawks may very well have
gotten the steal of the first round.
Atlanta just missed the play
offs last year, even though they
were without Dominique Wilkins
for me?t of the season. In
Wilkins' absence, the talented,
young Hawks' nucleus gained
maturity, a quality which the
team has often lacked over the
years. They have also lacked a
power forward, but that is no
longer the case.
Keefe should fit perfectly into
the Hawks lineup, allowing Kevin
Willis to move to center and
Stacey Augmon to stay at small
forward.

He is the classic NBA power
forward — big, tough, and agile.
Although Keefe may have lost
more than $1 million a year in
salary because he was picked
lower than expected, he did not
seemed bothered at all.
"This has been a dream come
true," Keefe said. "I think I can
contribute to Atlanta by being a

solid player who scores points and
grabs rebounds."
Lack of talent has never
stopped the Hawks — lack of
heart and discipline has. Keefe
has heart and discipline in
spades, and these qualities could
be as important to the Hawks as
any points and rebounds he con
tributes. .

Although this contribution will
start tomorrow, when he flies to
Atlanta, Keefe took a few
moments to relax from the stress
he has recently been under:
"After all of the talk about the
draft in recent weeks, it'll be nice
to get things back to normal."
They did well
Atlanta was not the only team
to significantly improve itself in
this year's draft.
The Magic, of course, took
Shaquille O'Neal, who should be
one of the league's best players
for years to come .. . The addition
of Alonzo Mourning may make
Charlotte the NBA's best young
team . . . Harold Miner is the
shooter the Heat needs . . . The
Bucks grabbed Arkansas' May-
Day combination...

Adam Keefe drives to the basket during the 1991-92 season.
Although many NBA observers had been touting him to be picked as
high as fifth overall, Keefe said he was not disappointed and "thrilled
to be in the top 10."
