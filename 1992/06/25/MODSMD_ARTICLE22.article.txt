# NOSE TO NOSE
## Which standard? 
### 
Should athletes be held to a
higher standard of conduct
than the average Joe? I say yes.
Advertisers have told us
that athletes should be emu
lated not just for their playing
ability, but also for their per
sonal lives. Gatorade tells us
to "Be Like Mike." Not Play
Like Mike, but Be like him.
The tremendous publicity
athletes receive turns them
into larger-than-life public fig
ures and role models. This can
be a tremendous burden to
bear for young men and
women, but it is a role that
society has thrust upon them.
Kids, as well as adults, look
up to athletes, not just for tips
on how to play, but also on
how to live. Thus athletes can
have a huge influence on the
choices a youngster makes.
Anyone who questions the
influence that athletes have
on kids hasn't heard, as I
have, a teenager justify his dip
habit by saying, "Well,
Carlton Fisk chews, so it can't
be bad for you."
Besides the role-model bur
den, athletes have the same
social responsibilities the rest
of us have — to act as good
citizens and make the world a
better place.
Athletes can make even
greater contributions to the
community because of their
immense wealth and fame.
Baseball players, who make
an average of over $1 million
a year, are inherently more
able to give to deserving chari
ties than a middle-class family
which earns $40,000.
Further, athletes can set
the tone for their communi
ties by giving not only their
money, but also their time. By
volunteering to help disabled
youngsters or teach illiterate
adults, athletes encourage
others to do likewise.
The influence is substantial;
therefore, the example should
be worthy (but not James
Worthy!) of emulation.
Athletes have been given a bur
den to uphold, and they must
be aware that, as role models,
they have different responsibil
ities than the rest of us.

In a perfect world, Sean, I
would agree with you — it
would be great if athletes con
trolled their conduct. But let's
get out of Fantasyland. Many
athletes just aren't going to do
that, and to expect them to is
absurd and counterproductive.
We're talking about young
adults in their early twenties,
a lot of whom are millionaires.
Many have breezed through
school while their tests were
taken for them. Many have
had their sexual, narcotic, or
violent indiscretions covered
up for them by people who are
supposedly looking out for
their best interests. True,
some athletes are able to
avoid these pitfalls.
But all athletes, even the
ones that study hard and stay
out of trouble, are treated as a
different class of people by
society, and that's the core of
the problem. If someone can
hit a ball or block a shot, we
don't care if that person is a
responsible adult or if he or
she is just a child in a
grownup's body. All we care
about is their athletic perfor
mance.
But when an athlete then
goes out and hurts somebody,
you blame the athlete! Now
don't get me wrong, I certain
ly think Mike Tyson and Pete
Rose should have gone to
prison — they committed
crimes and were rightfully
punished.
But the responsibility for
stopping more of these crimes
from occurring lies with soci
ety, not with the athlete. Of
course athletes will continue to
act above the law until we tell
them that they are not above
it. It is our responsibility to
teach them responsibility.
Steve Howe was caught
using cocaine seven times over
his career, and yet he was
repeatedly allowed to pitch just
because he could get people out.
As a society, we can't allow ath
letes to participate if they can't
control their conduct. We must
remind our heroes, as well as
our children and ourselves, that
athletes just have God-given
talent. They are not gods.
