# Burning up the track in New Orleans
## 
### Tyson Vaughn Senior staff writer 
Recent Stanford graduate Chryste Gaines did
not accomplish her ultimate goal this summer, but
she gained plenty of experience for her future as a
professional sprinter, including a possible date in
the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
The Texas native made it to the June 20 semifi
nals of the women's 100 meters at the Olympic track
and field trials in New Orleans, but just missed qual
ifying for the finals by one place and .04 seconds.
Only the top four finishers in each semifinal heat
qualified for the finals. Gaines finished fifth with an
11.53 second time. Unfortunately for her, the top
three finishers in her semifinal heat were the same
three women who eventually won the finals: Gwen
Torrance, Gail Devers and Evelyn Ashford.
Gaines, the 1992 NCAA champion in the 100-

meter dash, found herself competing against a cou
ple of other recent champions in that event:
Carlette Guidry, the 1991 winner from Texas, and
Esther Jones, the 1990 champ from LSU.
Other competitors included the 35-year old
Ashford, who will be running in her fourth
Olympics, and Marion Jones, the 16-year old sensa
tion who finished fifth in the finals.
Although Gaines missed her chance to join her
classmate Jackie Edwards in Barcelona, she set her
sights squarely on Atlanta in 1996. Edwards, the 1992
NCAA long jump champion and triple jump runner
up, has already made the team in her native Bahamas.
Another Cardinal alum, PattiSue Plumer, '84, also
earned her ticket to Barcelona. Plumer won the 3000
meters at the U.S. trials, running a personal best of
8:40.98. Plumer's time was the second-fastest time
run in the world this year, and this clocking should
make her a medal favorite for Barcelona.
