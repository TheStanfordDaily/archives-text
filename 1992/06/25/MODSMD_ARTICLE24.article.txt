# Entertainment
## Something to satisfy every appetite

and the living is easy. Or so the song goes.
While it is true that for many, summer is a time of leisure
and recreation, the entertainment industry has taken a
decidedly eclectic opinion as to what the public wants.
Film studios roll out their biggest (although not nec-

essarily their best), while television puts on
programs that make test patterns look
exciting. Rock stars hit the road for mega
tours, but the "finer" arts (theater, sympho
ny, etc.) let their hair down for lighter fare
or take a vacation altogether.
But the common thread seems to be the
easy-to-digest nature of summer entertain
ment. There should be enough on the menu
to satisfy anyone's appetite.
Movies: The perennial staple of a summer
entertainment diet, films released between
Memorial Day and Labor Day tend to fall

into two categories: big and funny.
This year there's big, funny and
Batman, as in "Batman

Returns," the mammoth

blockbuster against which
no other film dared

open. With more
than $45 million in

tickets in its

opening week
end, Tim

Burton's

ture is the

one, if for no
other reason than

to say you've seen
it.

After "Batman

Returns," the most eagerly

awaited film is probably the

(Jeena Davis-Madonna-Tom

1 ianks comedy, "A League of Their

Own," about women's baseball during
World War 11.

Eddie Murphy and Clint Eastwood each
return to their roots in two films designed to get hack
to the genres that made them stars.

Murphy's "Boomerang" is a romantic comedy, more in
the style of the early "Trading Places" than the "Beverly
Hills Cop" or "48 Hours" pictures. "Boomerang" hopes to
remind fans of just how genuinely funny Murphy can be
when nothing's exploding nearby.
In "Unforgiven," Eastwood hops back in the saddle,
directing, producing and starring in a traditional Western.
Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman and Richard Harris also
star with the aging tough guy.
Also notable is "Cool World," a "Roger Rabbit" style film
combining live action with saucy animated characters, such
as Holli Would, a cross between Marilyn Monroe and Jessica
Rabbit.
After last summer's surprise success of " 101 Dalmatians,
Disney is rereleaaing the classic "Pinocchio" this summer,
with a newly restored print and soundtrack as a bonus.

Disney will also offer "Honey, I Blew Up the Kid," the
sequel to "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids."
Many other titles will, of course, also pass through the
aters in the coming months, including "Pet Semetary II,"
"Bebe's Kids" and "Mo' Money."
Although release dates toward the end of the summer tra
ditionally are subject to rapid change, look for David Lynch's
"Fire: Walk With Me," the prequel to TV's "Twin Peaks", as
well as Alec Baldwin and Meg

Ryan in the screen version of "Prelude to a Kiss" sometime
in late summer or early fall.
Theater: Speaking of "Prelude to a Kiss," Theatre Works
has already kicked off the 1992-93 season with the original
stage version.
One of the few local theaters that does not take the sum
mer ofT, Theatre Works will also present "The Human Come
dy," based on the William Saroyan screenplay and novel
about life in a small California town during World War 11,
and "M. Butterfly," David Henry Hwang's award-winning
play involving political intrigue and gender identity.
Playwright Craig Lucas' work is well-represented in
South Bay theater. In addition to "Prelude to a Kiss," his
play "Reckless" will be presented by South San Jose's City
Lights Theater Company.
More locally, Palo Alto Children's Theatre offers five pro
ductions this summer. "Meet Me in St. Louis," "The

CocoanuLs," "Bye Bye Birdie," "The King and I" and "'Bare
foot in the Park" will all star people 16 to 24 years old.
Further south Shakespeare Santa Cruz presents "Taming
of the Shrew," "A Doll's House" and "Macbeth." An outdoor
theater and innovative interpretations of old classics high
light SSC's summer festival.
Many smaller theaters produce works during the summer
in San Francisco, but the flagship of Bay Area theater is
probably Carole Shorenstein Hays and James M. Neder
lander's "Best of Broadway" series.

"Lost in Yonkers," the first production in the cur
rent Broadway package closes this weekend, while July
and August will bring "Lettice and Lovage," "Richard III"
and the national tour premiere engagement of Tony
Award-winner "The Will Rogers Follies."
Music: After last summer's dismal concert ticket
sales, it's surprising that so many big acts are venturing
out on the road this summer.

Oddly, advance word on many mega-acts vis-

iting the Bay Area has been quiet. So

even though stars like Elton

John with Eric Clap-

ton and U2

(return
ing from

Europe for
another U.S.

sweep) are out
and about this

summer, no one's
saying if they're drop-

ping by the area soon.

What will be dropping by is

the first stop in a return

engagement of the only true con-

cert success last summer, the Lolla

palooza Tour.

Starring the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Min
try, Ice Cube, Soundgarden, The Jesus and

Mary Chain, Pearl Jam and Lush, Lollnpalooza kicks ofT

at the already sold-out Shoreline Amphitheatre July 18.

Also visiting Shoreline this summer are James Taylor,
Paula Abdul with Color Me Badd, Natalie Cole, Michael
Bolton, The Jerry Garcia Band, The Allman Brothers Band,
Crosby, Stills and Nash, Jimmy BufTett, Santana and others.
Elsewhere in the Bay Area, the Cure will appear at San
Jose State University and Garth Brooks plays in Oakland,
although his show sold out in under half an hour.
Fine Arts: Once again, the San Francisco Symphony
puts away Mozart and his pals and cuts loose with the county
fair flavor of the San Francisco Symphony POPS. Kicking off
with "Stars, Stripes and Sousa" on July 15, POPS will bring
in a wide variety of guest artists to perform in the Civic Audi
torium.
Love songs from World War 11, the best of Rodgers and

Hammerstein, jazz night with
Dave Brubeck, country tunes with
Chet Atkins, Broadway classics
with Bernadette Peters, zydeco
and mambo, Vikki Carr and a
night with the Four Tops are all on
the summer schedule.
Best of all, the Civic Auditorium
floor seating is replaced with picnic
tables for POPS, and audience
members are encouraged to bring
their own meals to the show.
Also notable in the City is the
two-week engagement of the
JofTrey Ballet, performing numer
ous San Francisco and JofTrey pre
miere works, including (I swear I
am not making this up) a pas de
deux to a piece of music by Prince
called "Billboards."
Even though the San Francisco
Opera takes a summer hiatus,
Pocket Opera will perform three
works, Offenbach's "La Belle
Helene," Mozart's "Bastien and
Bastienne" (which he wrote when
he was 12), and Schubert's "The
Conspirators," which will be per
formed in German.
Stanford: But there's no need
to venture all the way to San
Francisco or San Jose for some
first-class entertainment. The Farm
will host a variety of performances
and presentations throughout the
summer.

Frost Amphitheater will once
again play host to the South Bay
Comedy Picnic on Sunday. All the
scheduled comics are past winners or
finalists of the San Francisco
International Stand Up Comedy
Competition, including last year's
winner Don McMillan, a Stanford
alum. Every week, the Coffee
House will host various musical
acts on Tuesday and Thursday.
Stanford regulars Cliff Gold
macher and Adlai Alexander are
among the scheduled performers.
Of course, the hottest music at
Stanford this summer will come
from the annual Stanford Jazz
Workshop, which plays host to some
of the top artists in the world ofjazz.
This year, the Workshop will
close its 20th summer with a 75th
birthday celebration for jazz legend
Dizzy Gillespie. Unfortunately,
Gillespie has been ill and may not
actually attend the event, but the
performance will feature jazz
artists performing Gillespie's work.
Finally, those looking for a sim
ple, pleasant, free way to relax can
sample the weekly film series at
Tresidder Memorial Union every
Wednesday night. Set in the cool
night air on the Back Patio, the
films to be shown are "Dr. No,"
"Annie Hall," "A Fish Called
Wanda" and "Mo' Better Blues."

Details for many of these events can
be found on The Weekly's Calendar
page or by calling the appropriate
box office.

More locally, Palo Alto Children's Theatre offers five pro
ductions this summer. "Meet Me in St. Louis," "The

CocoanuLs," "Bye Bye Birdie," "The King and I" and "'Bare
foot in the Park" will all star people 16 to 24 years old.
Further south Shakespeare Santa Cruz presents "Taming
of the Shrew," "A Doll's House" and "Macbeth." An outdoor
theater and innovative interpretations of old classics high
light SSC's summer festival.
Many smaller theaters produce works during the summer
in San Francisco, but the flagship of Bay Area theater is
probably Carole Shorenstein Hays and James M. Neder
lander's "Best of Broadway" series.

"Lost in Yonkers," the first production in the cur
rent Broadway package closes this weekend, while July
and August will bring "Lettice and Lovage," "Richard III"
and the national tour premiere engagement of Tony
Award-winner "The Will Rogers Follies."
Music: After last summer's dismal concert ticket
sales, it's surprising that so many big acts are venturing
out on the road this summer.

Oddly, advance word on many mega-acts vis-

iting the Bay Area has been quiet. So

even though stars like Elton

John with Eric Clap-

ton and U2

(return
ing from

Europe for
another U.S.

sweep) are out
and about this

summer, no one's
saying if they're drop-

ping by the area soon.

What will be dropping by is

the first stop in a return

engagement of the only true con-

cert success last summer, the Lolla

palooza Tour.

Starring the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Min
try, Ice Cube, Soundgarden, The Jesus and

Mary Chain, Pearl Jam and Lush, Lollnpalooza kicks ofT

at the already sold-out Shoreline Amphitheatre July 18.

Also visiting Shoreline this summer are James Taylor,
Paula Abdul with Color Me Badd, Natalie Cole, Michael
Bolton, The Jerry Garcia Band, The Allman Brothers Band,
Crosby, Stills and Nash, Jimmy BufTett, Santana and others.
Elsewhere in the Bay Area, the Cure will appear at San
Jose State University and Garth Brooks plays in Oakland,
although his show sold out in under half an hour.
Fine Arts: Once again, the San Francisco Symphony
puts away Mozart and his pals and cuts loose with the county
fair flavor of the San Francisco Symphony POPS. Kicking off
with "Stars, Stripes and Sousa" on July 15, POPS will bring
in a wide variety of guest artists to perform in the Civic Audi
torium.
Love songs from World War 11, the best of Rodgers and

Hammerstein, jazz night with
Dave Brubeck, country tunes with
Chet Atkins, Broadway classics
with Bernadette Peters, zydeco
and mambo, Vikki Carr and a
night with the Four Tops are all on
the summer schedule.
Best of all, the Civic Auditorium
floor seating is replaced with picnic
tables for POPS, and audience
members are encouraged to bring
their own meals to the show.
Also notable in the City is the
two-week engagement of the
JofTrey Ballet, performing numer
ous San Francisco and JofTrey pre
miere works, including (I swear I
am not making this up) a pas de
deux to a piece of music by Prince
called "Billboards."
Even though the San Francisco
Opera takes a summer hiatus,
Pocket Opera will perform three
works, Offenbach's "La Belle
Helene," Mozart's "Bastien and
Bastienne" (which he wrote when
he was 12), and Schubert's "The
Conspirators," which will be per
formed in German.
Stanford: But there's no need
to venture all the way to San
Francisco or San Jose for some
first-class entertainment. The Farm
will host a variety of performances
and presentations throughout the
summer.

Frost Amphitheater will once
again play host to the South Bay
Comedy Picnic on Sunday. All the
scheduled comics are past winners or
finalists of the San Francisco
International Stand Up Comedy
Competition, including last year's
winner Don McMillan, a Stanford
alum. Every week, the Coffee
House will host various musical
acts on Tuesday and Thursday.
Stanford regulars Cliff Gold
macher and Adlai Alexander are
among the scheduled performers.
Of course, the hottest music at
Stanford this summer will come
from the annual Stanford Jazz
Workshop, which plays host to some
of the top artists in the world ofjazz.
This year, the Workshop will
close its 20th summer with a 75th
birthday celebration for jazz legend
Dizzy Gillespie. Unfortunately,
Gillespie has been ill and may not
actually attend the event, but the
performance will feature jazz
artists performing Gillespie's work.
Finally, those looking for a sim
ple, pleasant, free way to relax can
sample the weekly film series at
Tresidder Memorial Union every
Wednesday night. Set in the cool
night air on the Back Patio, the
films to be shown are "Dr. No,"
"Annie Hall," "A Fish Called
Wanda" and "Mo' Better Blues."

Details for many of these events can
be found on The Weekly's Calendar
page or by calling the appropriate
box office.

and the living is easy. Or so the song goes.
While it is true that for many, summer is a time of leisure
and recreation, the entertainment industry has taken a
decidedly eclectic opinion as to what the public wants.
Film studios roll out their biggest (although not nec-

essarily their best), while television puts on
programs that make test patterns look
exciting. Rock stars hit the road for mega
tours, but the "finer" arts (theater, sympho
ny, etc.) let their hair down for lighter fare
or take a vacation altogether.
But the common thread seems to be the
easy-to-digest nature of summer entertain
ment. There should be enough on the menu
to satisfy anyone's appetite.
Movies: The perennial staple of a summer
entertainment diet, films released between
Memorial Day and Labor Day tend to fall

into two categories: big and funny.
This year there's big, funny and
Batman, as in "Batman

Returns," the mammoth

blockbuster against which
no other film dared

open. With more
than $45 million in

tickets in its

one, if for no
other reason than

to say you've seen
it.

After "Batman

Returns," the most eagerly

awaited film is probably the

(Jeena Davis-Madonna-Tom

1 ianks comedy, "A League of Their

Own," about women's baseball during
World War 11.

Eddie Murphy and Clint Eastwood each
return to their roots in two films designed to get hack
to the genres that made them stars.

Murphy's "Boomerang" is a romantic comedy, more in
the style of the early "Trading Places" than the "Beverly
Hills Cop" or "48 Hours" pictures. "Boomerang" hopes to
remind fans of just how genuinely funny Murphy can be
when nothing's exploding nearby.
In "Unforgiven," Eastwood hops back in the saddle,
directing, producing and starring in a traditional Western.
Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman and Richard Harris also
star with the aging tough guy.
Also notable is "Cool World," a "Roger Rabbit" style film
combining live action with saucy animated characters, such
as Holli Would, a cross between Marilyn Monroe and Jessica
Rabbit.
After last summer's surprise success of " 101 Dalmatians,
Disney is rereleaaing the classic "Pinocchio" this summer,
with a newly restored print and soundtrack as a bonus.

Disney will also offer "Honey, I Blew Up the Kid," the
sequel to "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids."
Many other titles will, of course, also pass through the
aters in the coming months, including "Pet Semetary II,"
"Bebe's Kids" and "Mo' Money."
Although release dates toward the end of the summer tra
ditionally are subject to rapid change, look for David Lynch's
"Fire: Walk With Me," the prequel to TV's "Twin Peaks", as
well as Alec Baldwin and Meg

Ryan in the screen version of "Prelude to a Kiss" sometime
in late summer or early fall.
Theater: Speaking of "Prelude to a Kiss," Theatre Works
has already kicked off the 1992-93 season with the original
stage version.
One of the few local theaters that does not take the sum
mer ofT, Theatre Works will also present "The Human Come
dy," based on the William Saroyan screenplay and novel
about life in a small California town during World War 11,
and "M. Butterfly," David Henry Hwang's award-winning
play involving political intrigue and gender identity.
Playwright Craig Lucas' work is well-represented in
South Bay theater. In addition to "Prelude to a Kiss," his
play "Reckless" will be presented by South San Jose's City
Lights Theater Company.

ductions this summer. "Meet Me in St. Louis," "The
