## Return to Gotham 
### 
"Batman Returns"
Unmistakably, denying the suc
cess of director Tim Burton's
"Batman Returns" is futile. But
the sequel's efforts at capturing
the aura and profits of summers
past should be taken with the
standard grain of salt.
Burton's stylistic changes are
many and conspicuous. Beginning
with the opening credits, we see a
gloomy, snow-covered Gotham
City, 33 years in the past. It's
doubtful that an audience would
have tolerated another tracing of
the Bat-logo even with an excep
tional Bat-theme.
Instead, Burton chooses to
sketch the origins of Penguin/Oscar
Cobblepot (Danny DeVito), whose
passage along the murky depths of
the Gotham sewer system parodies
baby Moses' voyage on the river
Nile. Unfortunately for baby Oscar,
there's no beautiful Egyptian
princess to raise him as an adopted
prince. Oscar gets arctic birds.
Also different is downtown
Gotham's once burdensome Goth
ic styling. Bo Welch's decidedly
low-key set design escorts the
Dark Knight's city into the '90s
forever, departing from the retro
spective '40s atmosphere of "Bat
man" conceived by Anton Furst.
It's a very Manhattanesque city,
perfect for penguins that fly, bats
that drive and cats that roar.
The use of characters proves
the most refreshing of the sequel's
changes. The cast — starring
Michael Keaton (Batman /Bruce
Wayne), DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer
(Catwoman/Selina Kyle) and
Christopher Walken (Max Shreck)
— often functions as a talented col
lective despite the presence of a
definite power struggle.
Even when Keaton's pre
dictably dead-pan but less-starchy
hero is nowhere to be found, the
three villains frequently wrestle
for command of the screen.
Their jockeying successfully
italicizes the complex duality that
each grapples with.
The film's brief character stud
ies, especially of Catwoman and
the Penguin, are exceptional.
However, through no fault of
Keaton's, Batman is once again
left a mystery to the audience and
maybe even to himself. The great
est single challenge of the original
"Batman" was to get inside the
central character's head.
Burton chose instead to focus
on Nicholson's Joker. Given a sec
ond chance, he has accomplished
nothing more.
"Batman Returns" derives its
entertainment value from its per
formances, Stefan Czapsky's cine
matography, screenwriter Daniel
Waters' dialogue and Chris Leben
zon's editing. Only the story suf
fers.
The film regularly introduces
plot points that are carelessly for
gotten. But the average filmgoer
intent on having a good time
won't mind this casual careless
ness, especially considering the
sequel's incredible showing in
other areas.
Fortunately, Waters' ("Hea

thers") agile screenplay brims
with intelligent dialogue and
memorable wit.
In the near future, you might
hear a random "Honey, I'm home,"
in honor of Catwoman /Kyle's habit
ual salute of a nonexistent hus
band. And remember, only try the
Penguin's "French flipper trick"
with suitable protection.
While waiting in line at San
Francisco's Coronet theater, a
group of avid Bat-freaks, including
myself, were cautioned by a
motorist about the quality of "Bat
man Returns." That assessment
could not have been further from
the truth. One can only question
the poor soul's planet of origin —
maybe Krypton.
