# Muddled 'Games'

"Patriot Games "
When a film studio wants a big
budget action film but the film
makers aspire to an intelligent
political thriller, the result is
often a muddled story offering
few thrills and uninventive action
sequences. Such is the case with
"Patriot Games," the new film
based on the Tom Clancy novel.
Harrison Ford stars as Jack
Ryan, a former CIA analyst whose
family vacation in England is
interrupted when he becomes
entangled in an Irish Republican
Army attack. After thwarting the
attack, Ryan is faced with the
challenge of defending his family
from the vengeance of the terror
ist whose brother he killed.
Clancy's novel, a paranoid

techno-thriller, asks readers to
believe that the IRA would attack
someone on U.S. soil. His vivid
descriptions of modern technology
and weaponry, as well as his zeal
ous belief in the superiority of
U.S. intelligence, make the novel
somewhat readable, though never
entirely plausible.
But in the hands of the film's
screenwriters, W. Peter Iliff ("Point
Break") and Oscar-winner Donald
Stewart ("Missing"), "Patriot
Games" becomes nothing more
than a standard action-revenge pic

ture with pretensions of being a
cerebral, political thriller.
The film's political intrigue is
more puzzling than cerebral. For
instance, the IRA terrorists slip in
and out of the U.S. twice, but
unlike Clancy, the filmmakers
never explain how they do so.
The story jumps from England
to Ireland and from the U.S. to
North Africa, but the global impli
cations of the events are never
impressed upon the audience.
The action sequences are large
ly uninventive, even though the
first few are exciting. But the
director, Philip Noyce, shows lit
tle ability to build tension. The
film lurches from event to event,
giving the audience scant indica
tion of the mounting threat to the
Ryan family.
You never feel the Ryans' ter
ror of being stalked by a terrorist
group, partly because there is no
time frame for these events. Were
they being stalked for a week or
for a year?
Harrison Ford, though believ
able in the film's action sequences,
is a man of few expressions. His
repertoire consists of a dopey, boy
ish grin, an intense, thoughtful
look, an angry scowl and a sur
prised look, which doubles for a
fearful one. These expressions
characterize every role Ford has
played, from Han Solo to Indiana
Jones.
When a Navy friend asks him
why he intervened in the London
attack, he replies with that dopey
grin, "It was rage." But you never
saw Ryan's rage, just that angry
scowl on his face.
Similarly, when Ryan watches
as his daughter is brought into
the hospital in critical condition, a
single tear rolls over Ford's
intense look. It's as if Indiana
Jones swallowed a pepper and was
trying hard not to show it.
His portrayal of Ryan's tran
sition from a peaceful man
forced into action to a man who
actively pursues his enemies
isn't quite believable. But Ford
is not to blame for the faults of
"Patriot Games." He is merely a
victim of the filmmakers who
attempted to transcend the

action film genre and failed.
