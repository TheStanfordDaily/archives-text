"Housesitter"
"Housesitter," starring Goldie
Hawn and Steve Martin, man
aged to sneak into theaters just
before the Batwave hit.
And when unlucky moviego
ers arrive to find "Batman
Returns" is sold out until next
Tuesday, they could do worse
than this slightly goofy but lik
able comedy.
With two bonafide members of
comedic royalty as its stars,
"Housesitter" would have had a
very difficult time not being
funny. So the only question cen
tered on just how funny it would
be. Thankfully, Martin and Hawn
did more than just show up at the
set every day.
Martin plays Newton Davis, an
architect recently spurned by the
love of his life (Dana Delaney) and
now saddled with Gwen (Hawn), a
woman who's got the whole town
thinking she's his wife.
The film's strength, surprising
ly, comes from the plausibility of
Gwen's continuous string of lies
designed to keep the scam going.
As Davis says, she's "the
Ernest Hemingway of bullshit."
The detail in her outlandish
fabrications is what snows the
town and also what makes the
film succeed.
Slack-jawed incredulity mixes
with amusement when Gwen
describes how her full facial ban
dages were removed for the first
time at her wedding to Davis in
the hospital.
"Housesitter" could easily have
been botched if the lies created by
Gwen and later Davis (who keeps
up the scam in order to win back
Delaney) weren't as believable to
the audience as they are to the
town.
Knowing you would probably
swallow these tales in real life
makes the skillful comedy of
Hawn and Martin even more
enjoyable.
