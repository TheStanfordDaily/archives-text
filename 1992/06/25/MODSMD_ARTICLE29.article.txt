# Switched-at-marriage scenario provides infectious fun

### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Craig Lucas' "Prelude to a Kiss" starts
Theatre Works' 1992 season with high
energy and pure fun, regardless of diffi
culty with its serious scenes.
The comedy/drama opens with the
soon-to-be couple, Peter (James Matthew
Campbell) and Rita (Sara Noah), being
introduced at a party. A courtship ensues
almost immediately, and after two
months, they are marching down the
aisle.
At their wedding, a strange old man
(George Ward) crashes the reception and
wanders over to the bride. He gawks at
Rita's vitality before asking if he may kiss
her. At the same moment, Rita wishes she
were old, romanticizing what it would be
like, before granting the old man the
honor.
As soon as their lips touch, unexplained
magic causes Rita and the old man to
switch bodies. For the rest of the play, the
old man re-experiences youth and health
while Rita discovers old age isn't all she
thought it was.
Unfortunately, "Prelude" recycles an
old Hollywood gimmick — "Switch," "Vice
Versa," "Freaky Friday" — as a means to
explore the old man's regretted past and
Rita's youthful cynicism, rather than
tackling these strong emotions in a mean
ingful manner.
And because "Prelude" doesn't reveal
the severe plot change until well into the
play, the serious part works about as well
with the comedy as mayonnaise does with
peanut butter on rye.

As a result, "Prelude" comes across as
melodramatic and trite. The contrivance
of a deeper meaning drowns other legiti
mate themes, such as Rita and Peter's dis
connection with their respective families
and the issue of how a partner deals with
changes in a significant other after mar
riage.
Given the situation where one lover
changes physically to a point where he or
she repulses his or her lover, the manner in
which these two cope with that transforma
tion raises potentially mesmerizing issues.
But that potential is lost in a scene
which can only be powerful if the drama is
sincere: Peter and the old man, who is
really Rita according to the gimmick, kiss.
Instead, the scene stands out as unneces
sary.
Yet the play continues to hold the audi
ence's interest. Fresh characterizations
and lively dialogue keep the audience car
ing about the characters, and strong per
formances by Ward and by Keith Bentley
and Miriam Babin (as Rita's parents, Mr.
and Mrs. Boyle) provide plenty of humor
and delight.
Ward superbly impersonates Noah's
portrayal of quirky Rita, from her silly
intonation to her little ritual that express
es a variety of emotions ranging from
frustration to excitement. First she
extends her arms and waves her fists
while hopping up and down, then opens
her hands and wildly shakes them about.
Ward's stellar performance not only
has the audience in stitches, but his fellow
cast members have trouble staying in
character once he gets going, thus making
comical scenes even more hilarious.

Bentley and Babin's portrayal of the
crazy parents also lend much to the
humor of "Prelude." The scene where Rita
first brings Peter home to meet the par
ents couldn't be more hysterical.
Everyone who has been in this situa
tion can relate to the embarrassing and
awkward "first meeting" of a significant
other's parents, and this scene definitely

depicts one of the worse such meetings.
Whether it's through these slice-of-life
scenes or those where Ward steals the
spotlight, it's clear that the cast has fun
with "Prelude." This contagious fun radi
ates out to the audience and swiftly
infects everyone, overcoming the play's
failed attempt to include weightier subject
matter.
