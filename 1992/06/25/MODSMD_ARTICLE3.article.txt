## Column Democracy, my dear... 
### 
Of all the memories of my
Stanford experience to date,
one from freshman year still
looms large in my mind. I remem
ber sitting in a friend's room, being
grilled as to the nature of govern
ment in my country.
I had just finished my mono
logue on the patriarchal tribal
based system of government that
is in power when a second friend
walked in the room.
At this point the person to
whom I had been talking turned
to the newcomer and said with a
look of disbelief, "His country
doesn't have democracy and he
thinks that that's okay ..."
I believe at that point he was
fairly sure that I had been the
recent recipient of a frontal lobot
omy.
I had already explained that
back home in the United Arab
Emirates there is no unemploy
ment and both education and
health services are free. And
there are no taxes ... other than
on cigarettes and alcohol.
However, these and other vari
ous pros of the system had failed
to outweigh in his mind the
intrinsic con of the fact that the
process wasn't democratic. In his
mind, the system had lost before
it had even started, simply
because of that fact.
It's not that I consider democ
racy to be a bad form of govern
ment; rather that I consider it,
like all forms of government, to
have its pros and cons, which can
be evaluated rationally and com
pared to other forms of govern
ment.
What I find disturbing is the
idea that in some sense democra
cy is right, that it is morally supe
rior to any other form of govern
ment.
The principle of freedom of
choice is one that is deeply
imbedded in the American psych.
As in government and everything
else, one must have the right to
choose; democracy is imbued
with an intrinsic good in that it
guarantees that choice. Hence
my friend's horror in discovering
that I, for one, am not dreaming
of a democratic future for my
country.
I find the idea of any doctrine
that comes attached with a sense
of moral righteousness to be
rather dubious, for two reasons.
Firstly, I question whether
anyone has the right to deter
mine that the doctrine he/she
adheres to is right absolutely for
the rest of humanity.
Secondly, history has shown
us nothing if not that the worst
crimes have invariably been com
mitted in the name of some doc
trine that had been determined
to be "right."
And yet in general this seems
to be the position of the over
whelming majority of Americans
— that democracy is the answer,
regardless of what the question is.
But this position has a fated flaw.
When you come to the conclu
sion that your particular system
is right absolutely, you no longer
question it. And by "questioning
the system," I mean more than
just wonder if Bush could be
doing a better job ...
I think that it is important
that people be able to stand back
from a system for a moment and
question their fundamental
assumptions about it. For exam
ple, the democratic process
ensures that all views are repre
sented, and that everyone has
political expression.
While in theory, democracy
provides everyone with a chance
to vote, the current form of
democracy in America is a two
party system that makes the suc
cessful appearance of a third

party virtually impossible.
Unless you are of the opinion
that there are only two viable
ways in which to run the country
at any given time, this system
simply allows for a choice of two,
and in general will ensure that
voting for any party other than
the two main contenders will be a
pointless exercise.
The success of Perot in this
election year only reaffirms this.
But Perot's success has come at
Clinton's expense; recent analy
ses of the electoral college sce
nario show that despite a good
showing in all states, Clinton
would receive virtually no votes in
the electoral college, because he is
unable to muster enough support
to place first in any given state.
Some would say at this point
that this is not a criticism of
democracy, but rather its current
incarnation in the United States.
However, the ideal theoretical
democracy may well be impossi
ble to implement, and blind sup
port for a system on the basis of a
commitment to a possibly unat
tainable ideal can only be to the
detriment of the citizens of the
country.
You have to question the sys
tem, because when you cease that
process of questioning, that same
system becomes subject to abuse,
as shown by the Watergate and
Iran-Contra scandals.
Questioning the system serves
as a self-checking mechanism, in
that it will lead to an awareness
of the ways in which the system
can be abused. Armed with this
knowledge it becomes far easier
to prevent the occurrence of
those abuses. Without it, it is
merely a matter of sitting around
and waiting for them to happen.
There is an even greater rea
son to question the system under
which the country is governed.
No one is asking whether current
economic problems might be due
to the nature of the democratic
process — invariably it is blamed
on the actors within that process.
The general opinion is that if
there is a recession, it is due to
George Bush or some other indi
vidual.
That people are disgruntled by
the current state of domestic
affairs is obvious — hence Ross
Perot's unexpected popularity,
due to a general feeling that the
traditional parties have failed to
provide solutions to the country's
current woes.
But the scapegoating of the
individual actors within the sys
tem merely sidesteps the need to
question whether the current
form of governmental process
may not yet be the heart of the
problem.
I'm not saying that the prob
lems facing this country are nec
essarily due to the democratic
process. What I am saying is that
unless we are at a point where we
are willing to ask that question,
how will we know that that is not
the answer?
