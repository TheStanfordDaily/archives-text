# Stanford Band runs off the field and into the studio
## 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
Who would have thought that those
raunchy-looking guys and gals who rush the
football field eveiy home game would want to
cut an album? Anyone who washed up at the
Farm in the last couple of years might not have
guessed.
Even though many New Kids on the Quad
might not be aware that the Leland Stanford
Junior (pause) University Marching Band cuts
albums, some upperclass students — those
guys who should have graduated years ago, but
just can't bear leaving this place — are as
familiar with their productions as the mtyority
of us are with. . . well, catchy cheerleading
phrases like "Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity."
Familiarity, however, doesn't imply that
our beloved seventh-year seniors have pur

chased, let alone listened to, early Stanford
Band recordings, much less their latest release,
"The Band is Not Helping."
Sadly, like many other campus-produced
albums, Band albums probably have sat in
spiffy Bookstore displays for years at a time,
purchased by only the avid fan or sympathetic
a cappella group member who periodically
buys rival group albums in the spirit of good
sportsmanship.
Regardless, the Band has got to be feeling
pretty good about its seventh production. "The
Band Is Not Helping" is a compilation of 21
arrangements "of classic and contemporary
rock-and-roll, adroitly spiced with a few tradi
tional songs, that elicits illicit longings among
[the] listening audience." If you like the above
excerpt from Jason Friedman's and Benjamin
Myers' liner notes from the album, you just
might get a warm-fuzzy feeling from the musi
cal arrangements as well.

Jokes aside, the album is well produced. It's
clear that painstaking effort was jammed into
everything from the front/back cover design, to
the liner notes, to the actual songs. When not
running in place, or twisting and shouting
while performing, you really get a sense of just
how good the Band really is.
In fact, after listening to the Band's rendi
tion of Steve Miller's "Livin' in the USA," the
Cure's "Love Cats," the Doors' "Touch Me," or
even the Tubes' "White Punks On Dope," you
might have a new respect for the group's on
field/on-the-road performances.
At least you may not mind them "playing,
dancing, sweating, and drawing the audience
into an excited orgy of music and spirit" any
more. Then again, you may continue to loathe
the Band.
But remember, these musicians, like the
Golden State Warriors, just came to play —
and have fun. So don't take it personal.
