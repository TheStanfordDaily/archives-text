## Progress made, but why not publicly? 
### 
THE SCHOOL OF Medicine has come a long
way since last summer's charges of
entrenched sexism at the school — but there
is a long way to go yet.
The attitudes in our society that give rise to sex
ism and sexual harassment are deeply rooted, and
often manifest themselves in subtle ways. What is
needed to combat these attitudes is patience and
openness.
On the part of Medical School administrators,
only the former has so far been evident. While they
have shown a willingness to stay involved with the
problem and allow time for real change to occur,
they have remained secretive about the results of
their investigations into alleged sexual harassment.
Making such information public would be a valu
able educational tool for concerned community
members.
The Medical School has made adequate progress
in implementing several of the proposals made by
students and community members in the wake of
Prof. Frances Conley's resignation last summer.
The school has started gender sensitivity work
shops, has established a permanent panel to investi
gate sexual harassment cases and now has a clear
system of managing such cases. In addition, the
University is currently working on a comprehensive
sexual harassment policy. The long-delayed draft of
the policy should be finished and made public in a
timely fashion.
Yet results cannot materialize overnight. It will
take a sustained effort on the part of the administra
tion and members of the community to change the
attitudes that are the root cause of this problem.
In the meantime, things are going to be tense.

Students at the school have expressed their feelings
that some professors are running scared.
Professors are afraid of being labeled as sexist
and are carefully choosing words and actions to
escape the label. In doing so, communication
between teacher and student, as well as between
colleagues, becomes strained.
But things do not have to continue this way. Part
of the problem is that the school community has
turned inward and shunned publicity.
Many faculty were upset by the recent coverage
of Prof. Margaret Billingham's confidential letter
citing sexism in the radiology department.
Their concern with the confidentiality of such
complaints is clear. Their distress over the negative
publicity at such a difficult time is also clear.
But it was media coverage that brought the prob
lem into focus to begin with. Continued coverage
should become a motivation for the community to
continue to move forward on this front.
This publicity may at times be bitter medicine to
swallow, but without open dialogue, members of the
community will continue to feel scared, communica
tion will be limited at best, and the school runs a
real risk of burying the problem instead of solving
it.
Conley's resignation last summer revealed an
erosion of faith among the school's female mem
bers.
The school's attempts to restore their faith are
clearly moving in the right direction. However,
unless the community perseveres — and unless it
chooses to have a more open discussion than it has
so far — the progress may not last long enough, nor
reach deep enough.
