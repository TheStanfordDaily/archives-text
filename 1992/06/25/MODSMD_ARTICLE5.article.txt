Editorial's look at
Pentagon's policy
simplistic, hoaky
The Daily's May 26 editorial,
"Find another symbol," was both
pleasing and frustrating. The rea
soned discourse regarding the
University's acceptance of Army,
Air Force and Navy ROTC schol
arship moneys was refreshing
and sound.
We applaud your conclusion that
refusing such "hardworking stu
dents" — who in many cases have
no other means to attend Stanford
— "to make a symbolic jab at a bad
Pentagon policy is absurd."
Operation Desert Storm, The
Daily's article on President
Kennedy's signing of an ACLU
petition and the recent introduc
tion by Rep. Pat Schroeder of a bill
designed to repeal the Department
of Defense's ban on homosexual
uniformed personnel has resulted
in a surge of media attention on
the issue both nationally, and obvi
ously, here at Stanford.
This is to be welcomed.
We were dismayed, however,

by The Daily's handling of the
matter at the end of the editorial
in question.
According to The Daily, "the
government's justifications are
varied" and include the contention
that " 'Fags' are too 'girly' for
combat." We find it extremely
unlikely that the government,
either officially or unofficially,
cites such a justification for the
policy — let alone does so in such
terms, as The Daily's use of quota
tion marks seems to imply.
That 1,000 homosexual veterans
of Operation Desert Storm have
been discharged and, more impor
tantly, the fact that many were not
expelled until the conclusion of the
conflict erodes The Daily's already
tenuous position that the
Department uses this argument.
The Daily further asserts that
the government claims "gays and
lesbians can't be trusted with
secrets." Since homosexuals are
banned from military service, the
argument goes, they are presum
ably more susceptible to blackmail
and hence a greater security risk.
While this was a point of the
policy in the past, it quite simply
is no longer.
The June 1 issue of Newsweek

states that "gay civilians are wel
come in the Pentagon," and many
of them have access to more sensi
tive information than most uni
formed personnel. Further,
Newsweek also quotes Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney conced
ing "that the security argument
was 'a bit of an old chestnut.' "
It is unfortunate that the
Daily, in covering such a contro
versial issue, failed — either by
choice or lack of information — to
apprise its readers of more than
six words of the Defense
Department's lengthy official pol
icy. It is not our position to defend
(or attack) the policy; we aim sim
ply to encourage the debate.
It would be foolish to assert
that bigotry does not exist among
some members of the armed ser
vices. It is equally foolish,
though, for The Daily to cite
false, unattributed arguments for
the government's justification
and to assert that such are
"hoaky cloaks for bigotry."
Indeed, to do so could be labeled a
hoaky cloak for journalism.
