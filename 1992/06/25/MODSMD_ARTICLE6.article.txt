# Art, life and flying by the seat of your pants

Wearing expressions of exuberance and
relief along with their caps and gowns,
Stanford's Class of 1992 heard Donald
Kennedy give a dramatic final speech as
University president and pondered speaker
Kirk Varnedoe's contention that art is an
expression of life's uneasy complexity at
the June 14 Commencement.
After the degrees were conferred, grad
uates joined with campus a cappella group
Fleet Street in a rap performance of the
"Stanford Hymn," and leapt to the Band's
rendition of "All Right Now" for the first
time as alumni, while being cheered by
nearly 25,000 giddy parents and specta
tors. .
Approximately 3,200 participating grad
uates entered Stanford Stadium in an
orderly manner, marching around both
sides of the track toward an enormous
white pavilion in the middle of the field.
However, as the students approached
their seats, all semblance of order dis
solved into chaos.
Some pulled frisbees from under their
robes, while others revealed stuffed ani
mals. One group of students came dressed

as a cow, centipede style.
A few students went so far as to disrobe
as they prepared to slide down a stretch of
tarpaulin coated with soapy water.
"I think it's wild. It's probably more dis
orderly than the (football) half-time
show," said junior Colleen Horan.
With their Commencement antics, the
graduates showed that they could go
through years of university education and
still maintain joviality worthy of fresh
men.
But there was more to Com
mencement than just an unconventional
processional.
Varnedoe, director of the department of
painting and sculpture at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, gave a thought
ful address on the "vague, rogue and inde
terminate" nature of life and art.
"Art can make you pay attention to the
things you take for granted [and] change
your relation to life's actualities and its
possibilities," Varnedoe said.
Varnedoe advised students to use their
Stanford education "sort of like the seat of
your pants: You can rest on it, or just use
it to cover your butt, but you use it best
and most artfully when you fly by it."
