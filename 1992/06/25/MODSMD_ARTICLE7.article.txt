# Kennedy says farewell to Stanford
## Speech asks graduates to 'take responsibility' and to keep the faith 
### Gloria Tzuang Howard Libit 
Commencement marked
University President Donald
Kennedy's farewell, and, like
most of what he has done at
Stanford, he went out with
style.
Although Kennedy began by
asking if there is "life after
Stanford," his speech to the
graduates addressed a subject
common to the final 18 months
of his presidency — assuming
responsibility.
Kennedy resigned last
August in the wake of the
University's indirect-cost con
troversy.
"I hope you will not shirk
from that special form of
responsibility that will require
you to stand up, state that pro
gram, accept the risks and
bear the consequences," he
said.
"Even at their worst, and
you are hearing this from an
expert, they're not intolerable
— not if you acted from convic
tion and know you did the right
thing."
Kennedy advised the gradu
ates to deal with the conse

quences of their actions. "Raise
your hand, acknowledge the
foul, take the penalty," he said.
He told the graduates to have
faith in their ability to handle
crises, saying Stanford "has
equipped you well to take
responsibility."
As one example of scapegoat
ing and avoiding responsibility,
Kennedy cited the Bush admin
istration's recent attempt to
blame the Los Angeles riots on
programs created by President
Johnson.
Both the content of his
speech and his farewell brought
a long standing ovation from the
crowd, as Dean of the School of
Education Marshall Smith and
Commencement Speaker Kirk
Varnedoe thanked Kennedy for
his contributions to the
University and higher educa
tion.
Students appreciated his
willingness to talk about the
controversy that forced him to
resign.
"It was kind of interesting
that he was talking about
responsibility," said Charles
Kankelborg, a graduate student
in physics. "It took courage for
him to raise that issue."
