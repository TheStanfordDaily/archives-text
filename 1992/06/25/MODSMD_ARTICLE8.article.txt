# A school under scrutiny
## 
### Grace Lee Editorial staff 
The School of Medicine, after several well-publicized tussles
over subtle sexism and sexual harassment within the school, has
responded with a number of policy changes that have kept atten
tion on the issue. But some say living under the microscope has
made for a tense atmosphere in the classroom, and strained facul
ty-student relationships.

Professors in the School of Medicine
have been telling the same jokes for
decades. But now they are no longer
funny.
As allegations of sexism at the school
continue to make headlines, professors are
"holding back" on their repertoire of sexist
witticisms, said first-year medical student
Martha Arroyo, vice president of the
Stanford Medical Students Association.
Since Prof. Frances Conley's resigna
tion last summer first drew attention to
the issue, the Medical School has respond
ed to concerns of subtle sexism and sexual
harassment with a flurry of programs and
policy changes.
But some students feel the heightened
awareness over the past year — resulting
from a combination of these measures and
the harsh glare of national attention
focused on the Medical School — has also
created an atmosphere of tension and
restraint in the classroom.
"It's like [professors are] stepping on
glass," Arroyo said, adding that it is "very
obvious" that teachers are choosing their
words and actions very carefully.
When Conley resigned her tenured posi
tion in the Neurosurgery Department in
May 1991, citing pervasive sexism, Medical
School students and faculty demanded
that the school address the issue with
more definitive approaches.
Since last year, the Dean's office has
issued a clear procedure for managing sex
ual harassment cases, has formed a perma
nent panel to hear and investigate allega
tions of harassment and has established
sensitivity workshops.
A policy that clearly defines different
levels of unacceptable sexual conduct is
still being finalized.
The sensitivity workshops — currently
targeted at faculty leaders, such as admin
istrators and department chairs — are

part of Medical School Dean David Korn's
two-year-old cultural diversity program
designed to create a more open atmosphere
for minorities.
According to the program's administra
tive director, Michael Cowan, the work
shops address issues such as racism, sex
ism and homophobia in both large and
small group discussions. The exact content
of the sessions is kept confidential, she
said.
So far, three groups of about 18 faculty
leaders each have attended the initial one-

and-a-half day work
shops, which are con
ducted by Equity
Institute, a national
consulting firm that
helps institutions
achieve cultural
change. The first
group of participants
has also attended a
follow-up session,
which was held three
months after the
original meeting.

"I think people feel that they have a bet
ter understanding of individual differ
ences" after they attend the workshop,
Cowan said. "The feedback we get from
people is really positive."
Arroyo said older medical students had
told her about sexist jokes that professors
used to pass on from year to year.
"This year, there are no (sexist)
mnemonics," she said, adding that she
does not recall hearing any discriminatory
remarks from her professors.
However, while professors have
changed their visible actions, Arroyo said
she doubts that many are genuinely chang
ing their principles, which she believes are
deeply rooted in "all this [male] bonding
that went on when the medical profession
was predominantly male."
"It's really hard to break the habits
they've developed," she said.
