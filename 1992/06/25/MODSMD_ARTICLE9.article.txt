# SEXUAL HARASSMENT AT THE MED SCHOOL: A ONE-YEAR RECAP

Arroyo added that many faculty mem
bers may only be modifying their behavior
because of a fear of being "tagged" as sex
ist. "Primarily it's the scare," she said.
But Arroyo also said that there hasn't
been enough time to gauge real progress
within the Medical School.
And just recently, a new case of gender
discrimination captured local headlines.

A month ago, Prof.
Margaret Billingham,
director of a Medical
School program de
signed to create a sup
portive atmosphere for
women, accused the
Radiology Department
of sexism in a memo to a
senior administrator
that was leaked to the
San Jose Mercury News.
She wrote the memo
based on interviews
with eight women in the
department.
A committee appoint
ed by Korn is currently
conducting an investiga
tion that is expected to
be completed soon.
Despite the recent
allegations, Cowan said
change is happening at

the Medical School — it is just subtle. "We
can't just sort of take our pulse everyday
and expect to find change," she said.
But despite some initial cynicism about
the program's effectiveness, faculty mem
bers who participated in the workshops
said they felt the sessions were helpful.
"Going into the program, I was skepti
cal about attitudinal and behavioral
changes" that would result, said Roy
King, associate professor of psychiatry.
But afterward, he said, he was sur
prised at the program's success in "uncov
ering almost unconscious, deeply held
biases."
Prof. Mary Lake Polan, chief of gyne
cology and obstetrics, said the session was
"highly personalized."

gender sensitivity as an area of improve
ment, Cowan said it will soon be modified
to encompass this issue.
She added that she thinks the Medical
School is "deeply committed to making
this environment feel better to every
body."
Arroyo, however, expressed concern

that — while faculty
members are becom
ing more aware of gen
der issues — faculty
student relationships
may suffer from the
strain of such a highly
sensitive environment.
She described the
increased inhibitions
that faculty and stu
dents seem to feel now
when establishing a
relationship with each
other.
There are "clear
ly tensions" in Medical
School Prof. Mark
Perlroth's classroom,
she said. Last June,
the University bro
ught three charges of
professional miscon-

duct against Perlroth,
including one for sexual harassment.
After an investigation, the University
announced in February that his case had
been formally resolved, but the details of
the agreement were not released.
Arroyo said students' awareness of
Perlroth's case "made it hard" for some to
approach him.
"It would be nice to get to a point
where .... professors don't have to watch
their every word and where men and
women could have a good rapport with
each other," she said.
She added that in Perlroth's final
remarks to the class, he seemed to address
a loss of communication. He cited a
Doonesbury cartoon in which a
Commencement speaker had deleted all
politically incorrect comments.
