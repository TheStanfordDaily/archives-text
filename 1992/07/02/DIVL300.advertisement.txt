TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:
A CALL TO ELIMINATE
RACISM
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:
No American can look with indifference upon the tragedy relentlessly unfolding
in our cities. Its causes lie beyond a particular verdict or a particular act of
oppression. The fires and deaths in Los Angeles are only symptoms of an old
congenital disease eating at the vitals of American society, a disease that has
plagued our country ever since slaves were brought from Africa to these shores
by their early settlers.
The Abolitionist movement, the Gvil War, the Reconstruction, the various
legislative acts dealing with civil rights, are so many milestones on the path of
progress, but they have fallen far short of society's needs and have not eliminated
the ingrained racism that blights our existence as a nation. America's history is a
history of advance and retreat, efforts toward improvement and the
abandonment of such efforts before they had borne fruit.
The solution to the problem of racism is not simple. Its material requirements are
well known. They include the provision of economic security and elimination of
poverty, the education of the young and care of the old. But the spiritual
requirements have been persistently neglected. America has not done enough to
demonstrate her commitment to the equality and the unity of faces, to the
dignity of all human beings whatever their color, arid to the moral imperative of
extending love and respect to the entire human family.
Ever since its inception a century ago the American Bahi'i community, inspired
by the teachings of Bahi'ulLih has made the elimination of racism one of its
principal goals. Baha'is have ceaselessly warned that discrimination and
oppression would lead to strife, that "enmity will increase day by day, and the
final result will be hardship and ... bloodshed." They have worked, and pledge to
continue to strive, for the eradication of all forms of prejudice, hatred, arid
injustice and for the fulfillment of the noble dream of peace and unity of all
peoples, races, and creeds.
We appeal to you, Mr. President, and to all our fellow citizens, not to turn away
from this "most vital and challenging issue." We plead for a supreme effort on
the part of public and private institutions, schools and the media, business and
the arts, and most of all to individual Americans to join hands, accept the
sacrifices this issue must impose, show forth the "care and vigilance it demands,
the moral courage and fortitude it requires, the tact and sympathy it necessitates"
so that true and irreversible progress may be made and the promise of this great
country may not be buried under the rubble of our cities.
