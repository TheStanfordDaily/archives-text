# NOT A SAVIOR?
## 
### 
Many who oppose Stan
ford's controversial speech
code see Gerhard Casper as
their savior.
Once dean of the
University of Chicago's con
servative law school, Stan
ford's next president has said
a number of times that
speech should not be crimi
nalized or hindered by limits.
But Casper said in an
interview that he has not yet
closely examined Stanford's
speech code, although it is on
his agenda for the next
month, and plans to act only
if he develops "a sense of
urgency" on the issue.
And he said that any deci
sion on his part to reopen
debate on the code must
reflect Stanford's values
rather than his own. Stanford
has "gone through this debate
rather recently," and has
done so articulately, Casper
said, adding that a renewed
battle over the Grey interpre
tation may not be advisable.
Although Casper said a
private institution "need not
follow the First Amendment
as law" or "change its behav
ior every time the Supreme
Court makes a decision," he
hopes that Stanford's policy
does not "deviate too far
from the standards of our
community."
