# ABORTION ACTIVISTS LEFT UNSATISFIED WITH JUDICIAL OUTCOME
## 
### Grace Lee Editorial staff 
At a university whose only
mobilized student group
on abortion is pro-choice
— and in a state with one of the
nation's most liberal abortion
policies — there were few who
found comfort in Monday's
Supreme Court ruling that pro
tected legalized abortion, but
broadened the restrictions states
can impose.
The Supreme Court reached
its long-awaited decision in the
case Monday, with a 5-4 vote
to uphold Roe vs. Wade, the
1973 landmark decision that
made abortion a constitutional
right.
While maintaining Roe, how
ever, the Court also upheld most
of a Pennsylvania law's restric
tions on abortion, such as a
parental consent requirement
for minors and a 24-hour wait
ing period before the abortion is
performed.
By allowing states to place
certain restrictions on abortion,
the court undermines Roe's orig
inal intention of guaranteeing
all women the right to an abor
tion, said Law Prof. Deborah
Rhode.
"The net effect [of the ruling]
is to retain women's right to
obtain an abortion in form but
not for many women in fact,"
she said.
Pro-lifers in the community
felt an equal sense of defeat,
even though the high court
ruled to uphold four of the five
restrictions on abortion that
were considered in the highly
publicized case, Planned
Parenthood vs. Casey.
"We were happy with the
parts that it upheld," said
Stanford graduate Betsy Powell,
who is currently vice president
of the Bay area chapter of the
California Pro Life Council, an
affiliate of the National Right to
Life Committee.
But Powell added that the
court's essential ruling to main
tain Roe was disappointing.
Powell contends that the pro
visions of the Pennsylvania law
are "very, very modest."
"I can't figure out why [abor
tion proponents] refer to it as a
highly restrictive law," she said.
For Stanford students seek
ing an abortion, the
Pennsylvania ruling has no
direct affect.
They, along with all other
women in California, are guar
anteed the right to an abortion
through a privacy clause written
into the state constitution.
But Rhode said she was con
cerned about the false sense of
security the ruling provides.
She said by giving states per
mission to place restrictions on
abortion, the court is "allowing
states to do indirectly what they
could not do directly," which is
to overturn Roe vs. Wade.
According to John Dorman,
director of community relations
at Cowell Student Health
Center, there are "a fair number
of women who do get abortions
at Stanford."
He estimated that about 80 to
90 Stanford women had abor
tions in 1991.
But. sophomore Shana
Yansen, a member of the
Stanford Pro-Choice Alliance,
said some women feel there are
still hindrances to obtaining an
abortion.
Yansen said she knows one
woman who performed a self
induced abortion at Stanford
because of a general climate of
restriction she felt existed here.
"I did not think that some
thing like that could happen on
campus," she added.
The court ruling Monday

"frustrated" Yansen, who com
plained of the extra restrictions.
"If the essence of Roe had
truly been preserved, I would be
content with the decision," she
said.
Yansen said she is worried
that people may react too posi
tively to the current ruling.
"I would have been more
excited if [Roe] had been over
turned," she said, suggesting
that an actual reversal would
have incited "more massive and
effective mobilization" to sup
port the pro-choice cause.
Many people have also raised
questions about the "undue bur
den" clause in the court's ruling,

which prohibits states
from enacting restric
tions that may be too
difficult for some
women to bear.
The newly added
term is ambiguous, and
will likely require more
court cases on abortion
to clarify it, said
Political Science Prof.
Richard Brody.
The courts "are going
to be busy with abortion
for a while until states
recognize what the lim
its of their limitations
are," Brody said.
Rhode said state
restrictions may prove
"burdensome" for many
younger or economically
disadvantaged women,
especially those who
need to travel from
more remote areas in
order to obtain an abor
tion.
And with the 24-hour
waiting period, women
will face an even greater
strain, said Gynecology
Asst. Prof. Kate
O'Hanlan.

"Now we're adding an
overnight hotel bill or a second
round-trip visit, which is costly,
inconvenient and arbitrary," she
said.
"The Supreme Court in this
decision has continued a practice
of sustaining [Roe vs. Wade]
while chipping away at its mar
gins," Rhode added.
With the court's ruling on the
Pennsylvania law, abortion
remains an option for women —
but only "for the affluent
woman," O'Hanlan said, adding
that the restrictions present sig
nificant obstacles for women of
lower economic status, younger
women and women of color.
"My initial thought was that
it was a racist, classist ruling,"

she said.
O'Hanlan said she has per
formed abortions on girls who
were as young as 12 years old.
She said she does not ask any
patients about parental consent.
Under the Pennsylvania law,
unmarried girls under 18 who
are not self-sufficient must ask
their parents or a judge for per
mission to get an abortion.
A similar law was passed in
California but has not been
enforced because it was chal
lenged in the courts.
While she informs the patient
that terminating the pregnancy
is "an irreversible procedure,"
O'Hanlan said she does not tell

the patient "that at six weeks
the fetus has a heartbeat, or at
12 weeks it could potentially
suck its thumb."
Some members of Stanford's
religious community sought to
redirect the abortion issue away
from politics toward more spiri
tual concerns.
Pastor Dorman Followwill of
the Peninsula Bible Church
related "the entire birthing
process" to God, and said he
would like to see Roe vs. Wade
overturned.
He said he opposes Roe
because it "puts a stamp — a
governmental okay — on the
choice of abortion."
And although he said he rec

ognizes the complexities many
women face when considering
this issue, he said "biblically, I
can't see any strong argument
for abortion."
Followwill, who also conducts
Tabletalk Bible study twice a
week for Stanford students,
added that "the tragedy in this
whole debate is that we have left
God out of the question."
He said that while he person
ally supports a pro-life stance,
he does not tell students in his
Bible study group to vote a spe
cific way.
Instead, he "encourages stu
dents to think biblically" about
abortion.

With the court's
ruling on abortion, the
debate is set to move
into the political arena
and dramatically im
pact both state and
national elections.
Roe vs. Wade was
preserved in the
Pennsylvania ruling by
one vote.
As Justice Harry
Blackmun prepares to
retire, pro-life and pro
choice groups are try
ing to ensure that
Blackmun's replace
ment — who almost
certainly will be the
deciding vote in the
next major abortion
ruling — will be sym
pathetic to their cause.
Brody said the
Pennsylvania decision
will "raise a lot of peo
ple's consciousness"
about their choice for
president.
"The next president
is going to matter a
whole lot," he said.
The Stanford Pro-

Choice Alliance has
been concentrating its
efforts on the fall election cam
paigns, working to elect pro
choice candidates.
Voters like O'Hanlan, who
spoke at a pro-choice rally at the
Palo Alto City Hall Monday
night, are planning to make the
upcoming election a single-issue
vote, choosing candidates solely
on the basis of their abortion
stance.
"Roe vs. Wade will be over
turned if there's one more [anti
abortion] appointment to the
Supreme Court," O'Hanlan said.
"That's why it's really impor
tant now to vote only single
issue and trust that it will be an
excellent litmus test for other
issues as well."

About 400 people showed their support for legalized abortion at a pro-choice rally In White Plaza three
years ago. The debate over the abortion issue continues to rage after an unexpected middle-of-the
road Supreme Court decision left both sides unsatisfied.
