## Hammonds is latest Card to fly to Baltimore 
### Scott Walker 
It's been a wild, wild month for former
Stanford baseball player Jeffrey
Hammonds.
Who said Stanford can't prepare you for
the "real" world?
If the real world involves a roller coast

er of emotions, then Hammonds has defi
nitely lived it since the end of May, when
Stanford was unceremoniously eliminated
from NCAA regional play.
From that disappointment, along with a
pain-filled final season with the Cardinal,
Hammonds has bounced back quite nicely,
thank you. First he was the fourth player

taken in the baseball amateur draft. He
was selected by the Baltimore Orioles, who
have given their fans hope for the future
with beautiful Camden Yards and a pretty
good baseball team to boot. Then,
Hammonds was named to the U.S.
Olympic baseball team, along with
Cardinal hurlers Rick Helling and Willie
Adams. This is Hammonds' second tour
with this elite group.
Pretty lofty heights. But, is this the
zenith of Hammonds meteoric rise? Not
even close, said Ed Sprague, Orioles' scout.
"He's a good, solid everyday player,"
said Sprague, a former Cardinal player.
And with "500 at-bats in the minors",
Sprague said, Hammonds could be in
Orioles doubleknits.
This is saying a great deal about
Hammonds' abilities, because Baltimore
has what experts agree is one of the
American League's better outfields.
"[Hammonds] is just a protection,"
Sprague said. Should Hammonds' develop
ment continue as scheduled, two years may
be all it will take for Hammonds to reach
the majors. Hammonds is currently
unsigned, and while negotiations continue,
he probably will remain unsigned until his
return from Barcelona in late August. And
even if he signs, it is doubtful that he will
don the colors of an Orioles farm club.
Stanford's season began in late January,
and Hammonds has been playing virtually
nonstop since then. "That's a pretty good
year of baseball," Sprague said.
If it seems like the overriding assump
tion here is that Hammonds is a "can't
miss" player, that's because most, includ
ing his future employers, have no doubts
about that. When asked about the level of
Hammonds' eventual minor league assign
ment, Sprague was uncertain. "It's up to
our development people," he said,
although he indicated that Hammonds

would probably find himself on the "high
A or AA" level.
Sprague cited familiarity as the only
thing standing between Hammonds and the
majors. He made special mention of
Hammonds' need to familiarize himself with
the wooden bat. But Sprague was confident
that this would not be a problem. "It's just a
matter of [ Hammonds! getting used to pro
fessional baseball," said Sprague.
Hammonds is just one of a string of
Cardinal ballplayers to be drafted by the
Orioles. Pitcher Brian Sackinsky joined
Hammonds in this year's draft, selected
40th by Baltimore. Jeff Ballard and cur
rent Oriole hurler Mike Mussina were also
Cardinal standouts drafted by the Orioles.
There had been minor questions of
Hammonds' ability to withstand the rigors
of professional baseball. The list of injuries
to the two-time Ail-American was as long
as his many hitting streaks. Hammonds
has missed games because of a badly
sprained ankle and two outfield collisions.
He also was disabled by a broken wrist,
which lead to both his very slow start and
his midseason trip home for recuperation.
But the Orioles are not concerned with
these injuries, or the possibility that the long
professional season will make them recur.
"They were just little nagging injuries.
They're part of the game," Sprague said.
While the Orioles and Hammonds have
not yet agreed to terms, signs say that the
honeymoon period has been good.
Hammonds has publicly expressed his
pleasure at being selected by a quality
team with minor league affiliates around
his New Jersey home. The Orioles are
understandably pleased at getting an
immense talent.
"We have a great outfield. There's
always room for another good player," said
Sprague.
May they live happily ever after.
