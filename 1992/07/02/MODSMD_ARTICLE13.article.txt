High on the grass
He was once at home on the
Farm, but these days is residing
on the grounds of Wimbledon.
Yesterday John McEnroe con
tinued his incredible run at the
All-England Club by getting a set
up on ninth-seeded Guy Forget 6-
2, 5-5 before rains postponed
action until today.
Should he win today, McEnroe
would face the winner of the Boris
Becker-Andre Agassi match post
poned yesterday with Agassi lead
ing 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 3-4. In the other
semifinal, Pete Sampras, who
downed Michael Stich, will square
off against Goran Ivanisevic, who
upset Stefan Edberg.
McEnroe's serve, forehand
and volley are not the only parts
of his game in fine form this past
week and a half â€” his mouth has
been excelling as well. As usual,
Mac has been giving the umpires
an earful and pounding his rac
quets into the turf. Like Jimmy
Connors, McEnroe seems to play
better when he is expressing him
self, and he's been expressing
plenty in this tournament.
Mac has hardly had an easy
road to the semis. He had to face
giant-killer Andrei Olhovskiy,
who put an end to all talk of a
possible men's Grand Slam by
eliminating top-seeded Jim
Courier. He also beat Pat Cash
and the talented David
Wheaton, who also used to call
the Farm home.
But McEnroe is not the only
ex-Card to excel on the grass in
the last two weeks. Patty
Fendick reached the round of
sixteen, where she gave second
seeded Steffi Graf a tough match
before falling in three sets.
Our futbol stadium
Stanford Stadium will be the
site of six games in the 1994
World Cup soccer tournament,
including a quarterfinal match.
Hopes were high that Stanford
would receive a semifinal match,

but the facility renovations nec
essary to Stanford Stadium
proved to costly a pill to swallow.
So the semifinal matches will be
played at Giants Stadium in New
Jersey and at Pasedena's Rose
Bowl, which will also be the site
for the finals.
Major renovations, including
widening the field and expanding
the pressbox, will still be neces
sary for the matches which will
be played at Stanford Stadium.
FIFA, international soccer's gov
erning body, is giving $1 million
for the renovations and Stanford
University will contribute $2
million.
Stanford will only be able to sell
about half of the 82,000 tickets
available for the matches, as half
the seats must be given to World
Cup USA '94, which governs soc
cer in this country, FIFA, and
reserved for sale to foreign visitors.
Tickets will probably average $50,
and may go for more than $100.
Gold rush
The 1,500 meters in Barcelona
will have the look of a Stanford
reunion, as former Card runners
Ilegina Jacobs and PattiSue
Plumer are both on the U.S.
team. Jacobs, who also competed
in Seoul in 1988, ran the fastest
time by an American this year at
the Olympic trials. Plumer, who
was hot on Jacobs' heels, will also
run the 3,000 meters in
Barcelona. . . . Also getting her
passport stamped in Spain will be
Kim Oden, former Card volley
ball standout and sister of current
Stanford star Bev Oden . . . .
Scott Fortune made the men's
volleyball team and shotputter
Pam Dukes is Olympic-bound as
well
Gold dust
Stanford baseball's superfrosh
first-baseman Dusty Allen was
honored this week by being
named to Baseball America's 1992
Freshman All-America team.
