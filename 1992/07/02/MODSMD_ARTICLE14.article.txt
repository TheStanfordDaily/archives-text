# NOSE TO NOSE
## More fun — minors or majors? 
### 
Call me crazy, Sean, but I'd rather go to a minor
league baseball game than a major league game.
Why? Because the reason I go to any baseball
game is to have fun, and minor league games are
more fun than major league games.
It's more fun to watch a hungry young player
run out a weak grounder than it is to watch mil-

lion-dollar bonus
babies loaf on fly
balls.
It's more fun
to talk to the play
ers and have them
sign autographs
for free than it is
to be ignored by
jerks who have
forgotten that the
fans really pay
their salaries.
It's more fun to
sit where you can
have a conversa
tion with the first

base coach than to sit where the batter looks like
he's holding a toothpick.
It's more fun to be able to bring a date or a
relative to a game than it is to only be able to
afford your own ticket, parking, and concessions.
It's more fun to get something back when you
go to the ballpark, as you do in the minors with
between-inning giveaways, than it is to watch
some stupid dots racing around an oval.
It's more fun to go to games in August and
September where players on bad teams care
more about performing well than about how far
they can hit a 3-iron.
It's more fun to watch a minor league game,
where a team will make any effort to please the
fan, than it is to watch a mtyor league game where
fans are simply counted.
Yes, mqjor league players are more talented.
But the atmosphere of a minor league game
more than makes up for the lesser talent exhibit
ed on the field.
And yes, most people feel that the big leagues
is the only game in town — but how many of
those people have ever seen a minor league game?
When the Giants leave, area baseball fans
should not make a beeline to the Coliseum. There
are better games to see in San Jose and Modesto
and Stockton and Salinas and Visalia ...

You're crazy, Noah.
Trust me, my friend, I am an expert. I live in
Rochester, N.Y., the minor-leaguest city in the
country, home of the Triple-A Red Wings. I am
well acquainted (and I do mean "quaint") with
minor league baseball.
And it can't touch the bigs.

Obviously, the
quality of play in
the major leagues
is superior to that
found in the
minors, however
much Indians fans
may disagree.
Frankly, I'd rather
see Minnesota vs.
Atlanta in the
real World Series
than lowa vs.
Toledo in the
Triple-A World
Series.

You claim that
minor league ballparks are old and "quirky", and
I couldn't agree more. Major league parks, how
ever, are venerable and classic.
Yankee Stadium, Wrigley Field, Fenway Park,
Camden Yards. While minor league parks may be
equally well known and loved in their own commu
nities, the above names are baseball in a way that
no other minor league ballyard could hope to be.
Of course, ballparks are nothing without
names. Human names. The spirits of heroes past
and present who inhabit every inch of a big league
park. Ruth. Robinson. Aaron. Mays. Jackson.
Murderers' Row. The Gashouse Gang.
Minor league baseball doesn't create heroes like
this. Luke Easter was a fabulous first-baseman for
Rochester in the 20's and 30's, yet he is not the
first-baseman of the time. Lou Gehrig is. I'm glad
I know of Easter, but I pang to see Gehrig.
Today's players may be whiners off the field.
But if you watch Rickey Henderson turn a walk
into a triple, you don't think, "He's a loser," but
rather, "Damn, can he play!"
Maybe you feel that the minor leagues repre
sent a pilgrimage to the roots of baseball. But the
real pilgrimage is going to a Dodger game and
rooting for Strawberry and Hershiser,
Valenzuela, Garvey, Sutton, Podres, Hodges,
Reese, Campanella...
