## Chili cook-off bubbles into Palo Alto festival 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Editorial staff 
An annual Fourth of July chili
cook-off expands to become a
family-oriented day of fun and
entertainment, as the Palo Alto
Recreation Special Events Office
hosts the 1992 Palo Alto Sum
mer Festival and Chili Cook-Off
this Saturday at Mitchell Park.
Originally sponsored by a
community service club, the chili
cook-off has been a Palo Alto
institution for 10 years. This
year, the City of Palo Alto decid
ed to "spiff it up," said Cheryl
Abbott of the Special Events
Office.
"We have a five-year plan to
really enhance this and make it a
big event," she said, adding that
they hope to attract nationally
known entertainers in the future.
But the featured entertain
ment in this inaugural year of
the Festival certainly won't dis
appoint. Starting with the Pan
pouri/Caribbean Steel Band at 11
a.m., the musical acts will
include the retro-'6os Psy
cherelics, folk rock artists The
Basics, California Zephyr per
forming country, bluegrass and
Cajun music, the original work of
Steve Seskin and guitarist Tony
Khalife.
Between acts, stunt-meister
Bert Peterson will entertain on a
bicycle, a unicycle and a skate
board (hopefully not simultane
ously, but you never know).
For the younger folks, the
Festival includes a "Kid's Cor
ral," featuring "craftsy fun
things for the kids to make or
wear or play with on the spot,"
said Abbott.
Face painting, arts and crafts,
balloon sculpting and pony rides
are all part of the fun in the Kid's
Corral, which will also begin at
11 a.m.
A variety of local businesses
and charity groups will offer a cor
nucopia of food and refreshments
for sale at the Festival, including
Compadres' famous margaritas
and Pete's Wicked Ale, as well as
Piazza's Fine Foods.
And of course, there's the
thing that started it all â€” the
chili.
About 30 entrants will offer
up their hot and tasty concoc
tions in hopes of being selected

the best chili by community lead
ers or as the People's Choice win
ner, voted by Festival goers.
The recipes are "closely guard
ed secrets, as you might imag
ine," noted Abbott, especially
since the grand prize is $500.
Judging begins at 3 p.m.
It's not all decadence, howev
er, as the athletically minded can
participate in the 5K Chili Chase
Run and Walk around the park.
On-site registration will take
place until 7:15 a.m., with the
race beginning at 8:30.
You can also enter your own
three man or woman soccer team
in a competition sponsored by
Budweiser and Adidas.
More than 100 teams will
compete for the top prize of a
Hawaiian vacation. The conclu
sion of the soccer tournament
will close out the day's festivities.
In the past, more than 5,000
people annually have attended
the chili cook-off, but with the
addition of the Summer Festival,
organizers hope many more will
join in the fun.

Mitchell Park is located at 3800
Middlefield Road in Palo Alto.
