The Palo Alto Summer Festival and Chili Cook

Perhaps the biggest event will be the San

Army Band.
On the children's stage, Pickle Family Circus
performers and Italian comedy will be among the
performers. A science and cultural activity tent
with exhibits from the San Francisco Zoo and the
Exploratorium, among others, will also keep the
kids (big and small) entertained.
And at 9:15 the fireworks begin, kept low this
year to beat the City's infamous fog. Most
notably, the Chronicle display is timed to music,
broadcast over a sound system across the field.
Closer to home, the Stanford Theatre offers a
patriotic double feature of 44 Yankee Doodle
Dandy" and "This is the Army.** Joan Leslie,
star of both films, will be in attendance at the
Saturday night showing.

raise much needed funds by hosting "Dancer-

include a barbecue, prizes, and presentation of
