"Music is your own thoughts, your expe
rience, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it
won't come out in your [instrument]. They
teach you there's a boundary line to music.
But, man, there's no boundaiy line to art."
Jazz legend Charlie "Yard Bird" Parker
spoke the truth when he uttered these
words some 40 years ago. Jazz is music and
music is art.
But if you don't quite trust Bird's state
ment, then you aren't a moment too soon
for the 20th annual Stanford Jazz Work
shop, held from July 3 to August 15.
At the Workshop, held at Braun Music
Center on the Stanford campus, the doubt
ing Thomas, jazz connoisseur and all others
along the spectrum will find an exciting mix
ture of classes and performances open to the
public and conducted by locally and nation
ally renowned musicians and instructors.
Twenty years ago, co-workshop founders,
Jim Nadel and Bert Carelli, noticed a defi
ciency in Bay Area jazz training. Hoping to
fill the deficit, the two launched a small
scale venture which serviced a limited num
ber of aspiring musicians.
Since then, the Stanford Jazz Workshop
has established itself as an independent,
non-profit entity, serving more than 200
students a year in two programs — the Jazz
Camp ( July 26-August 1) and the

Adult/Advanced Students Workshop
(August 2-8).
The Jazz Camp provides young musi
cians (ages 12-17) with the opportunity to
study under veteran jazz musicians and
instructors. The camp keeps attendees busy
offering a mixture of individualized instruc
tion, music theory and group instruction.
The program further augments musi
cians' experience, providing opportunities
for participation in jam sessions and small
combos with faculty and other students.
Keyboard instructor Smith Dob son con
siders the camp the most focused of its kind
in Northern California. Not only does the
camp turn kids on to jazz, Dobson said, but
it also presents the mechanics of the music,
not to mention provides interaction with
exceptional faculty.
Tbe Adult/Advanced Students Workshop
is a program similar to the Jazz Camp,
though aimed at adult beginners, experi
enced jazz musicians, and classically trained
musicians.
The advanced workshops are enhanced
by the Improvisation for Strings program
(August 2-8). Facilitated by the phenomenal
Turtle String Quartet, the class promises to
be a great experience for string musicians
interested in learning improvisational tech
niques for quartet formats.
Besides providing a powerful mixture of
courses, the workshop also functions as one
of the only small, indoor, concert-setting

venues for local and national acts like the
Bobby Hutcherson Quartet.
The Hutcherson Quartet will open the
the Workshop's Summer Jazz Concert
series on Friday in Campbell Recital Hall.
Considered by many to be the foremost
vibraphonist of his generation, Hutcherson
has played with such jazz legends as Eric
Dolphy, Sonny Rollins, the late Dexter Gor
don and Tommy Flanagan.

He has also been accompanied by musi
cians of the likes of Branford Marsalis,
Philly Joe Jones, Buddy Montgomery, Mul
grew Miller and Billy Higgins.
For the Friday performance, however,
the Hutcherson Quartet will include Smith
Dobson on piano, Jeff Chambers on bass
and Eddie Marshall on percussion.
Though Hutcherson's only contribution
to the Workshop is his Bay Area quartet's
two-set performance, he promises to inun
date his audience with a selection of recent
and weathered arrangements for their lis
tening and learning pleasure.
Hutcherson's performance is merely the
beginning. The Workshop has planned
more than 25 free concerts and nearly 20
ticketed performances, culminating in the
Dizzy Gillespie Diamond Jubilee (August
14-15), a celebration of Gillespie's 75th
birthday. The performance— which may
feature Gillespie himself — highlights his
amazing contributions to the fields of bebop
and Latin jazz.
The Stanford Jazz Workshop, celebrat
ing its 20th anniversary, seems poised to
offer Stanford and the rest of the Bay Area
an intense format of jazz instruction and
entertainment, as well as deliver doubters
from artistic evil.

The Bobby Hutcherson Quartet performs
Friday at 8 p.m. in Campbell Recital Hall.
Tickets are available by calling 725-ARTS.
