To serve and protect
"Unlawful Entry "
At a time when police popularity is sure
to have plummeted to new depths, ratio
nalizing the release of a Los Angeles psy
cho-cop thriller seems an exercise in futili
ty.
Nonetheless, "Unlawful Entry," a film
by Jonathan Kaplan ("The Accused"), is
destined to be a summer favorite, despite
its awkward handling of volatile civic
issues.
The film opens as Karen Carr
(Madeline Stowe) is jarred awake by an
odd noise. Fearing a break-in, husband
Michael (Kurt Russell) launches a clumsy
reconnaissance which leads to the discov
ery of a wild-eyed, cotton-headed black
man in the closet.
After a brief struggle, the terrified,
demoralized but unharmed husband and
wife are comforted by the arrival of
Officers Pete Davis (Ray Liotta) and Roy
Cole (Roger E. Mosley).
But Davis soon ventures beyond his
realm of duty, offering the Carrs a readily
accepted friendship that gets dangerously
out of hand.
Although technically unremarkable,
Kaplan's unobtrusive direction provides a
reasonable back-drop for the story and
cast, the most distinctive assets of
"Unlawful Entry."
In many respects, Lewis Colick's
screenplay mimics the form and style of
an agile long-jumper. With great concen
tration and little hoopla, the film starts
down its cinematic runway, periodically
planting minor, yet relevant plot points,
facilitating its acceleration until its
launch. It lands only after negotiating an
intense yet believable resolution.
While Colick's screenplay is possibly
the film's greatest strength, the three
major characters — Davis and the Carrs
— make the film a worthwhile endeavor.
The three work well together, playing off
each other's emotions in scene after tense
scene.
Liotta's interpretation of the lonely and
unstable police officer, however, is
"Unlawful's" key performance. Un
fortunately, the story fleshes out the sear
ing intensity of Davis too quickly and too
precisely, leaving nothing to the imagina
tion.
A major plot point focuses on Russell's
sudden mistrust of Liotta which plays
counterpoint to Stowe's trust. Un
fortunately, because the audience knows
too much, the couple's conflict falls pre

maturely into the sand pit.
The effects of this minor problem, how
ever, are negligible. More important is the
film's politics. In one fell swoop,
"Unlawful Entry" primitively discusses
the issues of crime, police brutality and
the Hollywood integration of nonwhite
talent.
Denial of police brutality or inner-city
crime is clearly a foolhardy position. But a
white police officer's brutal degradation of
a black man — criminal or not — whose
only function is as an ugly caricature for
mostly white audiences to hate, should
not be confused with entertainment. It
merely illustrates Hollywood's basic disre
gard for performers and audiences of
color.
Yet even with its insensitivity,
"Unlawful Entry" is a film difficult to dis
like.

"One False Move "
Films such as "Lethal Weapon 3,"
"Patriot Games" and "Batman Returns"
would have you believe that violent crime
is confined to the big city.
But "One False Move," a thriller from
director Carl Franklin, shows violent
crime as a plague spreading from the city
into America's heartland.
The story focuses on a trio of desperate
criminals, Fantasia (Cynda Williams), Ray
(Billy Bob Thornton), and Pluto (Michael
Beach). The film opens as they methodical
ly slaughter a South Central L.A. drug
dealer and his family for his drug cache
and money, then skip town.
Each of the three has their own agen
da. Fantasia is a naive young woman who

wants to return to her family in Star City,
Arkansas. Ray is her white trash, bully
ing boyfriend, who just wants to get high
with her. Their partner Pluto, a cold,
intelligent tactician, plans for them to sell
the drugs to some friends in Houston and
disappear.
But their volatile partnership, a nosy
highway cop and a betrayal force a trip to
Star City, Fantasia and Ray's hometown.
The local sheriff and good-ol'-boy, Dale
"Hurricane" Dixon, is oveijoyed when two
LA. detectives arrive to help apprehend the
trio. Hurricane struts his stuff before the

detectives, hoping than he can use the inves
tigation as his ticket to big city police work.
Franklin intercuts scenes of the fugitives
making their way to Star City and the police
investigation. This technique effectively
contrasts the growing friendship between
Hurricane and the detectives with the disin
tegrating partnership of the criminals.
He also builds tension relentlessly
throughout the film. Near the film's cli
max, Franklin cuts rapidly between the
criminals arriving at an abandoned house,
Hurricane lying in wait for them and the
L.A. detectives trying to find both
Hurricane and the fugitives, all to the
underscore of a wailing harmonica.
Paxton, whose most memorable perfor
mance was the terrified marine in "Aliens"
("Game over, man!"), has effectively made
the jump to leading man. He plays the
genial, backwards sheriff with charm and
humor, but uses his eyes and gestures to
communicate Hurricane's fierce intelli
gence and pride.
Franklin has also elicited great acting
from the supporting cast. Williams is sym
pathetic as Fantasia, who fights to survive
even though she is in over her head, and
Thornton out-sleazes even Mickey Rourke
as the paranoid, trigger-happy Ray.
But the film's most riveting perfor
mance is turned in by Beach as Pluto,
whose calculating, ruthless manner recalls
Wesley Snipes' in "New Jack City."
The film also examines current attitudes
towards race and miscegenation in the
South, without seeming forced or didactic.
Shot in a naturalistic style on location in
both Arkansas and L.A., "One False Move"
successfully combines both the urban and
rural film noir genres into an explosive and
thought-provoking thriller.

(Madeline Stowe) is jarred awake by an
odd noise. Fearing a break-in, husband
Michael (Kurt Russell) launches a clumsy
reconnaissance which leads to the discov
ery of a wild-eyed, cotton-headed black
man in the closet.
After a brief struggle, the terrified,
demoralized but unharmed husband and
wife are comforted by the arrival of
Officers Pete Davis (Ray Liotta) and Roy
Cole (Roger E. Mosley).
But Davis soon ventures beyond his
realm of duty, offering the Carrs a readily
accepted friendship that gets dangerously
out of hand.
Although technically unremarkable,
Kaplan's unobtrusive direction provides a
reasonable back-drop for the story and
cast, the most distinctive assets of
"Unlawful Entry."
In many respects, Lewis Colick's
screenplay mimics the form and style of
an agile long-jumper. With great concen
tration and little hoopla, the film starts
down its cinematic runway, periodically
planting minor, yet relevant plot points,
facilitating its acceleration until its
launch. It lands only after negotiating an
intense yet believable resolution.
While Colick's screenplay is possibly
the film's greatest strength, the three
major characters — Davis and the Carrs
— make the film a worthwhile endeavor.
The three work well together, playing off
each other's emotions in scene after tense
scene.
Liotta's interpretation of the lonely and
unstable police officer, however, is
"Unlawful's" key performance. Un
fortunately, the story fleshes out the sear
ing intensity of Davis too quickly and too
precisely, leaving nothing to the imagina
tion.
A major plot point focuses on Russell's
sudden mistrust of Liotta which plays
counterpoint to Stowe's trust. Un
fortunately, because the audience knows
too much, the couple's conflict falls pre

maturely into the sand pit.
The effects of this minor problem, how
ever, are negligible. More important is the
film's politics. In one fell swoop,
"Unlawful Entry" primitively discusses
the issues of crime, police brutality and
the Hollywood integration of nonwhite
talent.
Denial of police brutality or inner-city
crime is clearly a foolhardy position. But a
white police officer's brutal degradation of
a black man — criminal or not — whose
only function is as an ugly caricature for
mostly white audiences to hate, should
not be confused with entertainment. It
merely illustrates Hollywood's basic disre
gard for performers and audiences of
color.
Yet even with its insensitivity,
"Unlawful Entry" is a film difficult to dis
like.

Noir thriller travels well
"One False Move "
Films such as "Lethal Weapon 3,"
"Patriot Games" and "Batman Returns"
would have you believe that violent crime
is confined to the big city.
But "One False Move," a thriller from
director Carl Franklin, shows violent
crime as a plague spreading from the city
into America's heartland.
The story focuses on a trio of desperate
criminals, Fantasia (Cynda Williams), Ray
(Billy Bob Thornton), and Pluto (Michael
Beach). The film opens as they methodical
ly slaughter a South Central L.A. drug
dealer and his family for his drug cache
and money, then skip town.
Each of the three has their own agen
da. Fantasia is a naive young woman who

wants to return to her family in Star City,
Arkansas. Ray is her white trash, bully
ing boyfriend, who just wants to get high
with her. Their partner Pluto, a cold,
intelligent tactician, plans for them to sell
the drugs to some friends in Houston and
disappear.
But their volatile partnership, a nosy
highway cop and a betrayal force a trip to
Star City, Fantasia and Ray's hometown.
The local sheriff and good-ol'-boy, Dale
"Hurricane" Dixon, is oveijoyed when two
LA. detectives arrive to help apprehend the
trio. Hurricane struts his stuff before the

detectives, hoping than he can use the inves
tigation as his ticket to big city police work.
Franklin intercuts scenes of the fugitives
making their way to Star City and the police
investigation. This technique effectively
contrasts the growing friendship between
Hurricane and the detectives with the disin
tegrating partnership of the criminals.
He also builds tension relentlessly
throughout the film. Near the film's cli
max, Franklin cuts rapidly between the
criminals arriving at an abandoned house,
Hurricane lying in wait for them and the
L.A. detectives trying to find both
Hurricane and the fugitives, all to the
underscore of a wailing harmonica.
Paxton, whose most memorable perfor
mance was the terrified marine in "Aliens"
("Game over, man!"), has effectively made
the jump to leading man. He plays the
genial, backwards sheriff with charm and
humor, but uses his eyes and gestures to
communicate Hurricane's fierce intelli
gence and pride.
Franklin has also elicited great acting
from the supporting cast. Williams is sym
pathetic as Fantasia, who fights to survive
even though she is in over her head, and
Thornton out-sleazes even Mickey Rourke
as the paranoid, trigger-happy Ray.
But the film's most riveting perfor
mance is turned in by Beach as Pluto,
whose calculating, ruthless manner recalls
Wesley Snipes' in "New Jack City."
The film also examines current attitudes
towards race and miscegenation in the
South, without seeming forced or didactic.
Shot in a naturalistic style on location in
both Arkansas and L.A., "One False Move"
successfully combines both the urban and
rural film noir genres into an explosive and
thought-provoking thriller.

"Unlawful Entry "
At a time when police popularity is sure
to have plummeted to new depths, ratio
nalizing the release of a Los Angeles psy
cho-cop thriller seems an exercise in futili
ty.
Nonetheless, "Unlawful Entry," a film
by Jonathan Kaplan ("The Accused"), is
destined to be a summer favorite, despite
its awkward handling of volatile civic
issues.
The film opens as Karen Carr
(Madeline Stowe) is jarred awake by an
odd noise. Fearing a break-in, husband
Michael (Kurt Russell) launches a clumsy
