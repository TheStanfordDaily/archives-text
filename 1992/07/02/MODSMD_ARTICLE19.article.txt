# Editor's Notebook

I'm almost glad space limita
tions prevented running a
review of Penny Marshall's
new film "A League of Their
Own."
That's because no review,
with the requisite critical cyni
cism, could have done justice to
this nearly perfect film, which
opened yesterday.

Sure, it's as laugh-out-loud
funny as it appears to be in the
commercials and teasers, espe
cially when Madonna and Rosie
O'Donnell (a comic I absolutely
hated when she was a VJ on VII
-1) get going.
But what makes this one of the
best movies I've ever seen is the
skill with which it presents a nos
talgic look at a forgotten part of
America's past â€” the women's
baseball league of the '40s and
'50s.
I'll bet that in the near future,
people will be sporting Rockford
Peaches caps or Racine Belles
jerseys, and Phil or Oprah will
have a show featuring some real
life All-American Girls
Professional Baseball League
alums.
Marshall manages to tug at
the heartstrings largely without
resorting to cheap emotional
manipulation. I don't cry at

movies as a rule, but I spent a
great deal of this magnificent
film fighting that pesky lump in
my throat.
I can't get over how incredible
it must have been to be part of
something so exceptional, to get
the opportunity to do something
you love but never thought
would be available to you.
I also can't get over how well
Marshall and company (includ
ing the always wonderful Geena
Davis and Lori Petty, the true
star of the film) presented this
story. Maybe next time I'll even
let myself cry.
.. .The banner headline in the
Chronicle's Sunday Datebook
section reads "They said it would
never happen."
"It" is the latest entry in the
summer mega-concerts: Guns N'
Roses, Metallica and Faith No
More, a true headbanger's dream
ticket (if you managed to get one
when they went on sale last
Sunday).
While not in the same genre,
another hot ticket (one you may
actually still be able to get) is
Bernadette Peters' appearance at
the San Francisco Pops later this
month.
A modern-day grande dame of
the Broadway stage, Peters' per
formance last year at the Pops
was an absolute delight, and
she's sure to dazzle again this
year.
. . ."Batman Returns" missed
beating the record for passing
$100 million in ticket sales by

one day.
The original "Batman" set the
prevailing mark of 11 days in
1989; the sequel only scored
$96.8 million in the same
amount of time. Almost as big a
tragedy as Dan O'Brien, huh?
. . .Speaking of tragedy,
"Studs" recently got higher rat

ings than Arsenio Hall, the first
time any late-night syndicated
program has done that in three
years.
. . .The cheapest form of
Fourth of July entertainment
would probably be a hike to the
Dish to watch fireworks around
the Bay, although fog and dis

tance usually make the displays
much less impressive than you'd
expect.

Chris Shuttlesworth, The
Weekly's entertainment editor,
will be seeing a play this Fourth
of July, having done the Dish
thing last year.

The Rockford Peaches have plenty to smile about. "A League of Their Own," about the real-life
women's baseball league, should soon be a huge hit with movie audiences.
