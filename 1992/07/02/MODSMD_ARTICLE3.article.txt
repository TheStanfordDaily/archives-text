Middle-ground
decision fuels
abortion debate
Abortion activists,
I \#pro-choice and
pro-life alike, remain
unsatisfied with
Monday's Supreme Court
ruling. The Court's deci
sion neither fully sup
ports nor strikes down
Roe vs. Wade. Instead, the
judges added limitations
to the process of obtaining
an abortion which trans
form it from a fundamen
tal right to an inconve
nient procedure.
Stanford gynecology pro
fessor Kate O'Hanlan is
one of many activists tak
ing this debate to the
November polls.
