## Column Art is nice, said the doc 
### 
The strangest conversation I
ever had was with a certain
doctor back in New Jersey
where I grew up who was kind
enough to look after one of my
injuries on his day off.
That summer I accidentally
dropped a fairly heavy thing, a
railroad tie, and got my finger
smashed underneath. I was in a
lot of pain.
My mother thought I should
go to the emergency room. My
father thought I should just
shake it off. I was pulling for at
least getting a doctor to tell me if
it's broken or not.
The parents finally agreed to
try Doctor R. since he was a
friend of the family and stuff like
that. My father was willing to
drive me to his office, which was
local. My mother decided not to
come — a decision that proved
extremely wise.
I thought waiting for the doc
tor was going to be the hard part.
My brain was operating in the
red zone. In a way I thought it
was interesting how senses get
heightened with injuries. At least
at first they do. After that the
pain gets to be a considerable lia
bility. It took an hour for Doctor
R. to come along.
All during that time my father
thought it best to keep me talk
ing. And, when the doctor's car
finally pulled in, he wrapped it up
by giving me something to think
about. He reminded me that
given the time of my accident I
was probably interrupting the
doctor's dinner.
The first thing Dr. R. told me
was that even if my finger was
broken there was nothing he
could do about it. Doctors don't
put casts on fingers and there's
no procedure for setting a bone
as small as that. The course of
events, then, was to let it heal
and if it came out all wrong to
break it again.
That was a prospect I did not
cherish.
But he did notice I had a sub
dermal hematoma. To me that
meant bleeding under the finger
nail. This concerned him. And he
thought it best that the pressure,
which wasn't noticeable yet,
should be alleviated. My father
fell by the sidelines for this one.
That in itself was a comforting
notion.
And it all started pleasantly
enough. Being a friend of the
family, Doctor R. asked about
how my brother was. His son was
friends with him way back when.
And then we rolled through all
the relatives until everyone was
perfectly at ease.
In the meanwhile he was pass
ing a straightened paper clip over
the flame of an alcohol lamp
waiting for it to get white hot.
After that he was planning on
plunging the thing through my
nail and thereby making an exit
route for the blood that was
building up.
The whole procedure sounded
very medieval to me, but I was
only the patient — my opinion
was not needed.
The paper clip was supposed
to burn right through the nail
material and the blood was sup
posed to squirt out and I was sup
posed to not be afraid. I was con
cerned. Even my father was con
cerned.
Dr. R. tried to calm me down
again, this time by inquiring into
my personal life. He was especial
ly interested in what classes I
was taking. I had already been in
a couple of disagreements with
my parents over such things so I
started out on the safe side.
I told him I had taken comput
er science courses, calculus and
requirements as well. Then

Doctor R. started to tell me about
his son who was planning on
going to law school. And he made
a joke, "Just what we need —
another goddamn lawyer!"
Then he asked what other
courses I was taking. I said I was
interested in a sculpture class.
He came at me, "A sculpture
class?" Then it must have hit him
that such indignation would not
get me any more comfortable.
He made a speedy about face,
"0 it's probably for a require
ment or something." And a few
seconds later he tried again, "Do
they cost as much as other class
es?"
Then my father contributed
something that only he and the
doctor shared in. But, and I can't
remember how this happened,
my father went too far and made
some additional comment on all
the non-practicality of what I was
studying.
The good doctor got angry at
that and said something about
how my father just really didn't
understand what it was like to be
a student and how I ought to
take advantage of learning while
I still could. And at that my
father went dead silent. I was
getting to like Doctor R.
But I was severely confused.
This was the same guy who just a
minute ago couldn't contain him
self when I mentioned sculpture
— even though the last thing in
the world he wanted to do was
get me upset.
Within a very short time
frame, Doctor R. had with equal
vehemence attacked me for tak
ing art classes and my father for
not appreciating these classes.
All I could think of was that he
might have had similar difficul
ties with his parents when it
came to studying biology and
chemistry. I was hoping we had
at least one thing in common.
That was when the paper clip
burnt into my finger. I remember
thinking, "Wow there are nerve
endings under my fingernail
too!"
After it was all over he asked
me very seriously what my major
was. I told him it was a double
major: Art & Math. "Art!" he
screamed. It was not what he
expected but he also saw I was
nonplussed what with the pain
and the weird joking going on.
He tried one last time to sal
vage the doctor-patient relation
ship, this time by making an hon
est attempt at telling me the
secret of life — well, so far as he
could make it out with his fifty
years of experience. And his
words stuck with me a long time
after that. He said, "Art is nice.
Drinking beer is nice. Going out
with girls is nice."
That's where my memory
winks out. The next thing that
must have happened was the rit
ual explaining to my mother of
what went on at the doctor's
office. It's no wonder.

math degree before he completely
loses all interest in science.
