THIS WEEK'S SUPREME COURT ruling on
the Pennsylvania law restricting abortion
heralds the emergence of a "center bloc" on
the court that may wield a great deal of influence on
the outcome of future cases brought before it.
At the same time, the ruling shifts the abortion
debate from the legal to the political arena — where
voters can control it — and makes the upcoming
presidential elections all the more important for the
future of the court.
The ruling, by a 5-4 majority, did uphold unwar
ranted restrictions in the Pennsylvania law on
women's right to choose to end their pregnancies.
But it was encouraging in that the center-right bloc
decided to uphold the fundamental principles of the
1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.
By voting with the two liberal members of the
court, justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony
Kennedy, both of them Stanford graduates appoint
ed to the high court by Reagan, and David Souter, a
Bush appointee, showed that they would not bind
themselves to the political agenda of the adminis
tration that appointed them.
Rather, the three justices emphasized the impor
tance of taking guidance from previous decisions by
the court in order to maintain the court's credibility,
thus sending a powerful message: The Supreme Court
must not be undermined by a public perception that it
has become a political arm of the administration.
But the power of the newly emergent "middle of
the road" bloc may be short-lived. The Roe decision
was upheld by a single vote, one which may be lost
when Justice Harry Blackmun retires. "I am 83
years old," wrote Blackmun, the author of the Roe
decision, in uncharacteristically personal language.

"I cannot remain on this court forever, and when I
do step down, the confirmation process for my suc
cessor well may focus on the issue before us today."
Whoever the voters place in the Oval Offioe this
November will likely try to choose someone whose
alignment is assured rather than appoint a "dark
horse" whose position would only become clear with
the next court case. The president elected this year
could control the constitutional path that the
United States will take for years to come.
State election results will also be important.
Under the ruling, state legislatures will be able
to restrict abortions so long as they do not place
"undue burden on a woman's ability" to choose an
abortion. In this year's state elections, voters will
determine how far — if at all — they are willing to
have abortion restricted.
The principle of placing restrictions on the right to
abortion is worrisome. Restrictions of any type mere
ly inject state bureaucracy into women's private lives,
and discriminate against poor women especially.
As the restrictions mount, it is entirely possible
that the right to have an abortion will become a the
oretical one, available only to those who have the
skills and the financial ability to navigate their way
through a labyrinth of state regulations.
By making the decision they did, O'Connor,
Kennedy and Souter maintained the credibility of
the court as an independent and objective inter
preter for the nation's constitutional mandate.
They have also passed the buck to the voters on
how they want abortions handled in this country.
The voters can only blame themselves if they elect a
candidate likely to produce, as Blackmun said, "the
single vote necessary to extinguish the light."
