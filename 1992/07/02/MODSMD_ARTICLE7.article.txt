Two-sided copies
can reduce paper
stacks, save trees
I have only been here a week
and I am pleased to see recycling
bins placed all over campus.
However, I have just discovered
that there is not a single coin-oper
ated copy machine on the entire
campus that prints double-sided.
This is dumbfounding. Twenty
two thousand people at Stanford
University amounts to forests
being chopped down every year.
I understand that people are
really good at recycling on campus,
but I am still critical. Recycling
companies have more paper and
bottles than they can handle and
there are few, if any, federal incen
tives to make recycling profitable.
The United States in particu
lar is in the destructive habit of
making waste first and then
inventing some "techno-fix" solu
tion to mop it up. This method is
both expensive and inefficient.
Why make the mess in the
first place? Why not strive to be
as energy-efficient and non-pol
luting as possible at the outset of

everything we do?
I am therefore making a plea
to every department on campus
to trade their coin-operated sin
gle-sided copy machines for dou
ble-sided ones, and to put signs
over the machines that remind
users to conserve paper and to
inform them that a stack of paper
four feet high equals one tree.

Poverty is product
of class hierarchy
not personal faults
Your May 28 editorial on
"Economic Diversity" attempted
to address an issue that is fre
quently overlooked by the largely
affluent Stanford community
but, it also had the unfortunate
effect of furthering certain harm
ful conceptions of what it means
to be economically disadvantaged
(i.e. lower class).
The editorial warns that "mak
ing an issue out of class differences
will bring uncomfortable attention"
to some lower-income students.

While this may be true, the edi
torial unfortunately never explic
itly problematizes — and there
fore tacitly accepts — the notion
that poverty is a shameful thing.
Our capitalist culture holds that
wealth is the result of intelligence
and hard work, and thus that the
poor are stupid and/or lazy. This
belief is obviously unfounded.
Recent studies reported in The
New York Times, for instance,
reveal that one's economic posi
tion is largely determined by that
of one's parents and that social
mobility in the United States is,
in practice, quite limited.
Lower class persons, born into
poverty, are very unlikely to ever
become rich, regardless of their
intelligence or motivation.
Your call for "awareness and
sensitivity," is a rather tepid plea
for understanding without address
ing or problematizing the fact that
Stanford — like other elite univer
sities — has a student body which
is overwhelmingly composed of
individuals from the upper classes.
It fails to challenge the politi
cal economy or cultural attitudes
which make class an issue in the
first place.
