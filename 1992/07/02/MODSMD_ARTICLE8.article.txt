Budget plan to tap
endowment, borrow
Stanford will significantly
increase its endowment payout
rate and borrow more than $45
million to soften the blow of the
University's projected two-year
$125 million budget shortfall,
according to a plan approved by
the Board of Trustees.
The plan is a marked depar
ture from past short-term budget
remedies, which typically rely on
spending unrestricted reserves.
The $125 million deficit is pro
jected for the current fiscal year as
well as the two-year period when
the University's deficit-reduction
plan will be implemented.
Stanford recently completed a
$43 million plan containing sig
nificant administrative and acad
emic budget cuts that will be put
in place over a two-year period.
Large one-time expenditures,
such as a staff early retirement
program and expenses related to
improving the University's cost
accounting systems, added to the
projected shortfall, according to
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van
Etten.
The financing plan will provide
the "breathing room needed to
implement the budget cuts we
identified in January — $43 mil
lion over the next three years —
in phases instead of immediately.
That gives us important stability
in preserving academic programs
and jobs," Van Etten said in a
statement yesterday.
The endowment payout rate —
the amount of interest used as
operating budget revenue — will
increase by two percent, from
4.75 percent to 6.75 percent, for
the next two years and generate
an additional $44 million.
University Budget Director
Tim Warner said the endowment
payout rate could be temporarily
increased because of "superior

returns in the 1980s."
From 1983 to 1991, Stanford
earned an average 16 percent
return on the endowment, but
only 4.3 percent was spent in the
operating budget, Van Etten said.

Ironically,
several faculty
members as well
as the former
Council of
Presidents had
called on the
administration
last year to
increase the
endowment pay-

out rate to lessen the severity of
the impending budget cuts.
The deficit financing program,
approved by the trustees at their
June meeting, also calls for
Stanford to borrow $45 million
and spend $15 million from unre
stricted reserves.
University budget planners
must still identify $21 million to
cover the remainder of the $125
million shortfall. The borrowed
funds will be repaid over a 15-
year period.
By spending only a small
amount of unrestricted reserves,
Van Etten said he believes the
University will maintain better
financial flexibility in the long
run. He added that staying away
from the reserves will also help
maintain the University's strong
credit rating.
This plan replaces one adopted
by trustees last year that autho
rized the use of up to $100 mil
lion of unrestricted reserves to
cover short-term deficits.

Green to stay open
until midnight
Green Library will continue to
maintain its usual hours in the fall
— staying open until midnight

Sundays through Thursdays —
instead of closing at 10 p.m., as
library officials had proposed earli
er this year.
After staff members recorded
heavy use of the library during
later hours, library officials decided
to delete a budget reduction pro
posal to close two hours early next
year, according to Karen Nagy,
director of academic information
resources for the University's
libraries.
The decision to stay open until
midnight was made in the middle
of June, and officials are now
working on the "internal realloca
tion of funds" necessary to offset
the decision, Nagy said. The pro
posal to change Green's hours
would have saved the library
$75,000 to $100,000.
Nagy said the loss of savings
from the proposed cut of Green's
hours would not be reflected in
cuts to other libraries' hours. She
added that the amount saved
"wasn't that great."
Following the original proposal
to revise Green's hours, many
students complained. Library
administrators then conducted a
"user survey" by having staff
members tally the rates and
times different services in Green
and Cubberly libraries were used
during a week in mid-May.
Staff members "verified heavy
use of Green library between the
hours oflO and midnight, espe
cially for studying," Nagy said.
While Nagy said that student
concern was "certainly a factor in
the decision not the close early,"
she also said that the library was
planning to do the user survey all
along. She said the proposal to
cut hours would not have been
carried through without the sup
port of a survey.
The library administration's
decision not to close Green early
was good news to students who
use the library. Crystal Thorpe, a
first-year graduate student, said

it would have been "just ridicu
lous to close the library at 10 p.m.
during the academic year."
Thorpe said it is already difficult
to deal with the limited weekend
access to the library, which closes
at 6 p.m. on Friday and Saturday
and opens at noon on Sunday.
For students like Thorpe, who
cannot study in their residences
in the evenings because of noise
level and distractions, Green rep
resents an essential haven for
safe and quiet studying.
The decision to keep Green open
until midnight is part of a general
plan to reconfigure all library
hours. This plan is being formulat
ed by library officials as they
attempt to handle the budget crisis.
The complete details of the
library changes will be officially
announced June 15, Nagy said.
Some department libraries
may open at 9 a.m. instead of 8
a.m., but these changes are inde
pendent of the decision to keep
Green open until midnight, Nagy
said. She added that the changes
were made with full agreement of
departmental staff. She did not
want to say which libraries would
be opening later before the "offi
cial announcement."
Library officials may also
announce that Meyer library will
offer a 24-hour study hall on its
first floor. But this decision is a
"University facilities project deci
sion," Nagy said, and they are
"not going to hold up the staffing
decision announcement to wait
for the verdict on this project,"
which may not be available for
some time.
Library officials are also try
ing to streamline the hours for
Meyer's department services. The
media center, foreign language
lab, circulation reserves and the
computer cluster will all be acces
sible during the same hours
instead of being open on different
schedules, Nagy said.

Student aid bill
passes Senate
The U.S. Senate approved
compromise legislation Tuesday
that will help students from mid
dle-income families pay for col
lege with government grants and
loans.
The lawmakers approved a
"direct-loan" pilot program for
about 200 schools that would
eliminate banks and other inter
mediaries from the student loan
process. Congressional auditors
have estimated the government
could save nearly $1 billion a year
by replacing the current subsi
dized student loan system and its
middlemen banks.
The program was hailed as "a
major step toward changing the
way Americans pay for college"
by Sen. David Durenberger, R-
Minn, an author of the program.
Under the pilot program, the
government will lend the money
for college or trade schools direct
ly to students, rather than pay a
subsidy to banks to make the
loans.
The bill also requires all
lenders of federal guaranteed stu
dent loans to offer borrowers
either graduated or income-sensi
tive repayment options.
Sponsors of the bill expect it to
be approved in the House next
week and then be sent to
President Bush.
If the legislation is passed,
schools must apply to participate
in the pilot program, said a
spokesperson for Sen. John
Seymour's office yesterday.
Richard Huff, director of the
Financial Aid Office, said that
Stanford must examine the final
legislation before deciding
whether or not to participate in
the program.
In order to make subsidized
loans available to more middle
income families, the calculation


Van Etten
of assets used to determine stu
dent aid eligibility will no longer
take into account a family's equi
ty in their home and college sav
ings accounts.
Huff said the change in equity
calculations could cause the
University to spend more on stu
dent aid.
"The University now has a job
of finding out how to fund these
changes," Huff said.
In addition to the change in
equity calculations, the legislation
calls for raising income ceilings
for students seeking Pell grants of
up to $2,400 a year. The annual
family income cutoff of a student
from a family of four would be
raised from $30,000 to $42,000.
About 700 Stanford under
graduates currently receive Pell
grants, said Huff. His office has
not yet calculated how many
more students would be eligible
under the new income cutoff.
Huff said that he was pleased
with the legislation. "We can't
tell how Stanford students will
benefit in specific right now," he
said. "But it's a very positive
development."

Employee arrested
for cruelty to son
Daniel Blomquist, an assistant
manager in the Controller's
Office, was charged Friday
evening with cruelty to his son
after a series of severe spankings
apparently inspired by religious
fanaticism, according to a
Campbell Police report.
Blomquist, described by
acquaintances as a devout
Christian, is currently being held
at the Santa Clara County Jail for
corporal injury to his son. Bail was
set at $150,000. His wife, Ethel
Blomquist, is expected to be
arrested today and also charged
with cruelty to the child.
According to the report,
Blomquist's 11-year-old son
Steven had severe bruising on his
buttocks and "appeared to be
very malnourished."
Blomquist told police that he
was "given authority by God" to

spank his son. "We are to disci
pline our children. Steven was
not willing to accept that he was
wrong," said Blomquist, accord
ing to the report.
In addition to the spankings,

police documents show that
Blomquist only provided his son
with one quart of unprocessed raw
milk, three eggs and some "food
supplements" as food each day.
Although the child was severe

ly malnourished, he was never
taken to a hospital because his
parents believed "he was never
that bad," according to the
report. Blomquist told police that
a specialist would come to the
home to care for the child, but he
declined to identify the person.
The case came to the attention
of police when Steven Blomquist
became gravely ill last Friday and
paramedics were summoned to
the Blomquist home. As of
Tuesday, the boy was in stable
condition at Stanford's Lucile
Salter Packard Children's
Hospital. •
Bob Vanadagriff, associate
director of administration in the
Controller's Office and a former
boss of Blomquist, said that
Blomquist was a religious and
sincere man. "I am completely
amazed at his arrest,"
Vanadagriff said. But another
friend described the Blomquists
as "in their own world," accord
ing to the police report.

Archuleta sentenced
to probation, service
Keith Archuleta, former assis
tant dean of students, was sen
tenced last week to four years pro
bation and 200 hours of commu
nity service for secretly videotap
ing women changing clothes in his
Mirrielees apartment.
Archuleta pleaded no contest to
two misdemeanor counts of elec
tronic eavesdropping at his arraign
ment in Santa Clara County
Municipal Court in Palo Alto. He
was not present at the hearing.
"Mr. Archuleta feels very sad
dened by the pain he has caused
people," said his attorney, Tom
Nolan. "It's unfortunate that
someone who has done so much
for so many people finds himself
in this situation."
Archuleta admitted to The
Daily in June that he had a
"problem," and said he would
seek psychological counseling.
Nolan said Archuleta is currently
receiving counseling.
Supervising District Attorney
Margo Smith, who prosecuted the
case, said one of the victims told

her that placing Archuleta in jail
would be a "waste of his abilities."
The decision to try the case as
a misdemeanor rather than a
felony was motivated both by a
desire to prevent the victims from
having to testify as well as
Archuleta's cooperation with
police, said Smith.
"The conduct did not necessi
tate it being a felony. There was
no touching and all but one
(videotape) had no full nudity,"
said Smith. "There was no
improper conduct, no lewd words
(on the videotapes)."
"It was just kind of like a
Peeping Tom," she added.
Archuleta faced a maximum
sentence of two years in jail and a
$5,000 fine for the misdemeanor
counts.
Smith said Archuleta video
taped a total of 11 women. Six
women, including one University
staff member, pressed charges.
Smith added that tapes depict
ing sex acts involving personal
friends of Archuleta were not
used in the prosecution.
Archuleta originally faced four
misdemeanor eavesdropping
counts, but two were dropped by
Judge Rene Navarro. Navarro
also ordered that all the tapes be
destroyed 10 days after the hear
ing unless victims request to keep
personal footage.
Archuleta, a Stanford graduate
and an 11-year University
employee, was also director of the
Black Community Services
Center. He resigned June 2 after
being arrested for covertly video
taping women during still photog
raphy sessions in his apartment.
In addition to filming the
women changing outfits, Archuleta
used the video camera to shoot up
the victims' dresses during various
poses for his still camera
The police investigation began
after one of the victims used a
pass-key to enter Archuleta's res
ident fellow apartment and seize
some tapes.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said the University would
begin a national search this sum
mer for Archuleta's replacement.
Jackson said he hopes to find a
replacement by early fall.

approved by the trustees at their
June meeting, also calls for
Stanford to borrow $45 million
and spend $15 million from unre
stricted reserves.
University budget planners
must still identify $21 million to
cover the remainder of the $125
million shortfall. The borrowed
funds will be repaid over a 15-
year period.
By spending only a small
amount of unrestricted reserves,
Van Etten said he believes the
University will maintain better
financial flexibility in the long
run. He added that staying away
from the reserves will also help
maintain the University's strong
credit rating.
This plan replaces one adopted
by trustees last year that autho
rized the use of up to $100 mil
lion of unrestricted reserves to
cover short-term deficits.

Green to stay open
until midnight
Green Library will continue to
maintain its usual hours in the fall
— staying open until midnight

Sundays through Thursdays —
instead of closing at 10 p.m., as
library officials had proposed earli
er this year.
After staff members recorded
heavy use of the library during
later hours, library officials decided
to delete a budget reduction pro
posal to close two hours early next
year, according to Karen Nagy,
director of academic information
resources for the University's
libraries.
The decision to stay open until
midnight was made in the middle
of June, and officials are now
working on the "internal realloca
tion of funds" necessary to offset
the decision, Nagy said. The pro
posal to change Green's hours
would have saved the library
$75,000 to $100,000.
Nagy said the loss of savings
from the proposed cut of Green's
hours would not be reflected in
cuts to other libraries' hours. She
added that the amount saved
"wasn't that great."
Following the original proposal
to revise Green's hours, many
students complained. Library
administrators then conducted a
"user survey" by having staff
members tally the rates and
times different services in Green
and Cubberly libraries were used
during a week in mid-May.
Staff members "verified heavy
use of Green library between the
hours oflO and midnight, espe
cially for studying," Nagy said.
While Nagy said that student
concern was "certainly a factor in
the decision not the close early,"
she also said that the library was
planning to do the user survey all
along. She said the proposal to
cut hours would not have been
carried through without the sup
port of a survey.
The library administration's
decision not to close Green early
was good news to students who
use the library. Crystal Thorpe, a
first-year graduate student, said

it would have been "just ridicu
lous to close the library at 10 p.m.
during the academic year."
Thorpe said it is already difficult
to deal with the limited weekend
access to the library, which closes
at 6 p.m. on Friday and Saturday
and opens at noon on Sunday.
For students like Thorpe, who
cannot study in their residences
in the evenings because of noise
level and distractions, Green rep
resents an essential haven for
safe and quiet studying.
The decision to keep Green open
until midnight is part of a general
plan to reconfigure all library
hours. This plan is being formulat
ed by library officials as they
attempt to handle the budget crisis.
The complete details of the
library changes will be officially
announced June 15, Nagy said.
Some department libraries
may open at 9 a.m. instead of 8
a.m., but these changes are inde
pendent of the decision to keep
Green open until midnight, Nagy
said. She added that the changes
were made with full agreement of
departmental staff. She did not
want to say which libraries would
be opening later before the "offi
cial announcement."
Library officials may also
announce that Meyer library will
offer a 24-hour study hall on its
first floor. But this decision is a
"University facilities project deci
sion," Nagy said, and they are
"not going to hold up the staffing
decision announcement to wait
for the verdict on this project,"
which may not be available for
some time.
Library officials are also try
ing to streamline the hours for
Meyer's department services. The
media center, foreign language
lab, circulation reserves and the
computer cluster will all be acces
sible during the same hours
instead of being open on different
schedules, Nagy said.

Student aid bill
passes Senate
The U.S. Senate approved
compromise legislation Tuesday
that will help students from mid
dle-income families pay for col
lege with government grants and
loans.
The lawmakers approved a
"direct-loan" pilot program for
about 200 schools that would
eliminate banks and other inter
mediaries from the student loan
process. Congressional auditors
have estimated the government
could save nearly $1 billion a year
by replacing the current subsi
dized student loan system and its
middlemen banks.
The program was hailed as "a
major step toward changing the
way Americans pay for college"
by Sen. David Durenberger, R-
Minn, an author of the program.
Under the pilot program, the
government will lend the money
for college or trade schools direct
ly to students, rather than pay a
subsidy to banks to make the
loans.
The bill also requires all
lenders of federal guaranteed stu
dent loans to offer borrowers
either graduated or income-sensi
tive repayment options.
Sponsors of the bill expect it to
be approved in the House next
week and then be sent to
President Bush.
If the legislation is passed,
schools must apply to participate
in the pilot program, said a
spokesperson for Sen. John
Seymour's office yesterday.
Richard Huff, director of the
Financial Aid Office, said that
Stanford must examine the final
legislation before deciding
whether or not to participate in
the program.
In order to make subsidized
loans available to more middle
income families, the calculation


Van Etten
of assets used to determine stu
dent aid eligibility will no longer
take into account a family's equi
ty in their home and college sav
ings accounts.
Huff said the change in equity
calculations could cause the
University to spend more on stu
dent aid.
"The University now has a job
of finding out how to fund these
changes," Huff said.
In addition to the change in
equity calculations, the legislation
calls for raising income ceilings
for students seeking Pell grants of
up to $2,400 a year. The annual
family income cutoff of a student
from a family of four would be
raised from $30,000 to $42,000.
About 700 Stanford under
graduates currently receive Pell
grants, said Huff. His office has
not yet calculated how many
more students would be eligible
under the new income cutoff.
Huff said that he was pleased
with the legislation. "We can't
tell how Stanford students will
benefit in specific right now," he
said. "But it's a very positive
development."

Employee arrested
for cruelty to son
Daniel Blomquist, an assistant
manager in the Controller's
Office, was charged Friday
evening with cruelty to his son
after a series of severe spankings
apparently inspired by religious
fanaticism, according to a
Campbell Police report.
Blomquist, described by
acquaintances as a devout
Christian, is currently being held
at the Santa Clara County Jail for
corporal injury to his son. Bail was
set at $150,000. His wife, Ethel
Blomquist, is expected to be
arrested today and also charged
with cruelty to the child.
According to the report,
Blomquist's 11-year-old son
Steven had severe bruising on his
buttocks and "appeared to be
very malnourished."
Blomquist told police that he
was "given authority by God" to

spank his son. "We are to disci
pline our children. Steven was
not willing to accept that he was
wrong," said Blomquist, accord
ing to the report.
In addition to the spankings,

police documents show that
Blomquist only provided his son
with one quart of unprocessed raw
milk, three eggs and some "food
supplements" as food each day.
Although the child was severe

ly malnourished, he was never
taken to a hospital because his
parents believed "he was never
that bad," according to the
report. Blomquist told police that
a specialist would come to the
home to care for the child, but he
declined to identify the person.
The case came to the attention
of police when Steven Blomquist
became gravely ill last Friday and
paramedics were summoned to
the Blomquist home. As of
Tuesday, the boy was in stable
condition at Stanford's Lucile
Salter Packard Children's
Hospital. •
Bob Vanadagriff, associate
director of administration in the
Controller's Office and a former
boss of Blomquist, said that
Blomquist was a religious and
sincere man. "I am completely
amazed at his arrest,"
Vanadagriff said. But another
friend described the Blomquists
as "in their own world," accord
ing to the police report.

Archuleta sentenced
to probation, service
Keith Archuleta, former assis
tant dean of students, was sen
tenced last week to four years pro
bation and 200 hours of commu
nity service for secretly videotap
ing women changing clothes in his
Mirrielees apartment.
Archuleta pleaded no contest to
two misdemeanor counts of elec
tronic eavesdropping at his arraign
ment in Santa Clara County
Municipal Court in Palo Alto. He
was not present at the hearing.
"Mr. Archuleta feels very sad
dened by the pain he has caused
people," said his attorney, Tom
Nolan. "It's unfortunate that
someone who has done so much
for so many people finds himself
in this situation."
Archuleta admitted to The
Daily in June that he had a
"problem," and said he would
seek psychological counseling.
Nolan said Archuleta is currently
receiving counseling.
Supervising District Attorney
Margo Smith, who prosecuted the
case, said one of the victims told

her that placing Archuleta in jail
would be a "waste of his abilities."
The decision to try the case as
a misdemeanor rather than a
felony was motivated both by a
desire to prevent the victims from
having to testify as well as
Archuleta's cooperation with
police, said Smith.
"The conduct did not necessi
tate it being a felony. There was
no touching and all but one
(videotape) had no full nudity,"
said Smith. "There was no
improper conduct, no lewd words
(on the videotapes)."
"It was just kind of like a
Peeping Tom," she added.
Archuleta faced a maximum
sentence of two years in jail and a
$5,000 fine for the misdemeanor
counts.
Smith said Archuleta video
taped a total of 11 women. Six
women, including one University
staff member, pressed charges.
Smith added that tapes depict
ing sex acts involving personal
friends of Archuleta were not
used in the prosecution.
Archuleta originally faced four
misdemeanor eavesdropping
counts, but two were dropped by
Judge Rene Navarro. Navarro
also ordered that all the tapes be
destroyed 10 days after the hear
ing unless victims request to keep
personal footage.
Archuleta, a Stanford graduate
and an 11-year University
employee, was also director of the
Black Community Services
Center. He resigned June 2 after
being arrested for covertly video
taping women during still photog
raphy sessions in his apartment.
In addition to filming the
women changing outfits, Archuleta
used the video camera to shoot up
the victims' dresses during various
poses for his still camera
The police investigation began
after one of the victims used a
pass-key to enter Archuleta's res
ident fellow apartment and seize
some tapes.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said the University would
begin a national search this sum
mer for Archuleta's replacement.
Jackson said he hopes to find a
replacement by early fall.

Budget plan to tap
endowment, borrow
Stanford will significantly
increase its endowment payout
rate and borrow more than $45
million to soften the blow of the
University's projected two-year
$125 million budget shortfall,
according to a plan approved by
the Board of Trustees.
The plan is a marked depar
ture from past short-term budget
remedies, which typically rely on
spending unrestricted reserves.
The $125 million deficit is pro
jected for the current fiscal year as
well as the two-year period when
the University's deficit-reduction
plan will be implemented.
Stanford recently completed a
$43 million plan containing sig
nificant administrative and acad
emic budget cuts that will be put
in place over a two-year period.
Large one-time expenditures,
such as a staff early retirement
program and expenses related to
improving the University's cost
accounting systems, added to the
projected shortfall, according to
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van
Etten.
The financing plan will provide
the "breathing room needed to
implement the budget cuts we
identified in January — $43 mil
lion over the next three years —
in phases instead of immediately.
That gives us important stability
in preserving academic programs
and jobs," Van Etten said in a
statement yesterday.
The endowment payout rate —
the amount of interest used as
operating budget revenue — will
increase by two percent, from
4.75 percent to 6.75 percent, for
the next two years and generate
an additional $44 million.
University Budget Director
Tim Warner said the endowment
payout rate could be temporarily
increased because of "superior

returns in the 1980s."
From 1983 to 1991, Stanford
earned an average 16 percent
return on the endowment, but
only 4.3 percent was spent in the
operating budget, Van Etten said.

Ironically,
several faculty
members as well
as the former
Council of
Presidents had
called on the
administration
last year to
increase the
endowment pay-

out rate to lessen the severity of
the impending budget cuts.
The deficit financing program,
approved by the trustees at their
June meeting, also calls for
Stanford to borrow $45 million

Staff members "verified heavy
use of Green library between the
hours oflO and midnight, espe
cially for studying," Nagy said.
While Nagy said that student
concern was "certainly a factor in
the decision not the close early,"
she also said that the library was
planning to do the user survey all
along. She said the proposal to
cut hours would not have been
carried through without the sup
port of a survey.
The library administration's
decision not to close Green early
was good news to students who
use the library. Crystal Thorpe, a
first-year graduate student, said

it would have been "just ridicu
lous to close the library at 10 p.m.
during the academic year."
Thorpe said it is already difficult
to deal with the limited weekend
access to the library, which closes
at 6 p.m. on Friday and Saturday
and opens at noon on Sunday.
For students like Thorpe, who
cannot study in their residences
in the evenings because of noise
level and distractions, Green rep
resents an essential haven for
safe and quiet studying.
The decision to keep Green open
until midnight is part of a general
plan to reconfigure all library
hours. This plan is being formulat
ed by library officials as they
attempt to handle the budget crisis.
The complete details of the
library changes will be officially
announced June 15, Nagy said.
Some department libraries
may open at 9 a.m. instead of 8
a.m., but these changes are inde
pendent of the decision to keep
Green open until midnight, Nagy
said. She added that the changes
were made with full agreement of
departmental staff. She did not
want to say which libraries would
be opening later before the "offi
cial announcement."
Library officials may also
announce that Meyer library will
offer a 24-hour study hall on its
first floor. But this decision is a
"University facilities project deci
sion," Nagy said, and they are
"not going to hold up the staffing
decision announcement to wait
for the verdict on this project,"
which may not be available for
some time.
Library officials are also try
ing to streamline the hours for
Meyer's department services. The
media center, foreign language
lab, circulation reserves and the
computer cluster will all be acces
sible during the same hours
instead of being open on different
schedules, Nagy said.

Student aid bill
passes Senate
The U.S. Senate approved
compromise legislation Tuesday
that will help students from mid
dle-income families pay for col
lege with government grants and
loans.
The lawmakers approved a
"direct-loan" pilot program for
about 200 schools that would
eliminate banks and other inter
mediaries from the student loan
process. Congressional auditors
have estimated the government
could save nearly $1 billion a year
by replacing the current subsi
dized student loan system and its
middlemen banks.
The program was hailed as "a
major step toward changing the
way Americans pay for college"
by Sen. David Durenberger, R-
Minn, an author of the program.
Under the pilot program, the
government will lend the money
for college or trade schools direct
ly to students, rather than pay a
subsidy to banks to make the
loans.
The bill also requires all
lenders of federal guaranteed stu
dent loans to offer borrowers
either graduated or income-sensi
tive repayment options.
Sponsors of the bill expect it to
be approved in the House next
week and then be sent to
President Bush.
If the legislation is passed,
schools must apply to participate
in the pilot program, said a
spokesperson for Sen. John
Seymour's office yesterday.
Richard Huff, director of the
Financial Aid Office, said that
Stanford must examine the final
legislation before deciding
whether or not to participate in
the program.
In order to make subsidized
loans available to more middle
income families, the calculation


Van Etten
of assets used to determine stu
dent aid eligibility will no longer
take into account a family's equi
ty in their home and college sav
ings accounts.
Huff said the change in equity
calculations could cause the
University to spend more on stu
dent aid.
"The University now has a job
of finding out how to fund these
changes," Huff said.
In addition to the change in
equity calculations, the legislation
calls for raising income ceilings
for students seeking Pell grants of
up to $2,400 a year. The annual
family income cutoff of a student
from a family of four would be
raised from $30,000 to $42,000.
About 700 Stanford under
graduates currently receive Pell
grants, said Huff. His office has
not yet calculated how many
more students would be eligible
under the new income cutoff.
Huff said that he was pleased
with the legislation. "We can't
tell how Stanford students will
benefit in specific right now," he
said. "But it's a very positive
development."

Employee arrested
for cruelty to son
Daniel Blomquist, an assistant
manager in the Controller's
Office, was charged Friday
evening with cruelty to his son
after a series of severe spankings
apparently inspired by religious
fanaticism, according to a
Campbell Police report.
Blomquist, described by
acquaintances as a devout
Christian, is currently being held
at the Santa Clara County Jail for
corporal injury to his son. Bail was
set at $150,000. His wife, Ethel
Blomquist, is expected to be
arrested today and also charged
with cruelty to the child.
According to the report,
Blomquist's 11-year-old son
Steven had severe bruising on his
buttocks and "appeared to be
very malnourished."
Blomquist told police that he
was "given authority by God" to

spank his son. "We are to disci
pline our children. Steven was
not willing to accept that he was
wrong," said Blomquist, accord
ing to the report.
In addition to the spankings,

police documents show that
Blomquist only provided his son
with one quart of unprocessed raw
milk, three eggs and some "food
supplements" as food each day.
Although the child was severe

ly malnourished, he was never
taken to a hospital because his
parents believed "he was never
that bad," according to the
report. Blomquist told police that
a specialist would come to the
home to care for the child, but he
declined to identify the person.
The case came to the attention
of police when Steven Blomquist
became gravely ill last Friday and
paramedics were summoned to
the Blomquist home. As of
Tuesday, the boy was in stable
condition at Stanford's Lucile
Salter Packard Children's
Hospital. •
Bob Vanadagriff, associate
director of administration in the
Controller's Office and a former
boss of Blomquist, said that
Blomquist was a religious and
sincere man. "I am completely
amazed at his arrest,"
Vanadagriff said. But another
friend described the Blomquists
as "in their own world," accord
ing to the police report.

Archuleta sentenced
to probation, service
Keith Archuleta, former assis
tant dean of students, was sen
tenced last week to four years pro
bation and 200 hours of commu
nity service for secretly videotap
ing women changing clothes in his
Mirrielees apartment.
Archuleta pleaded no contest to
two misdemeanor counts of elec
tronic eavesdropping at his arraign
ment in Santa Clara County
Municipal Court in Palo Alto. He
was not present at the hearing.
"Mr. Archuleta feels very sad
dened by the pain he has caused
people," said his attorney, Tom
Nolan. "It's unfortunate that
someone who has done so much
for so many people finds himself
in this situation."
Archuleta admitted to The
Daily in June that he had a
"problem," and said he would
seek psychological counseling.
Nolan said Archuleta is currently
receiving counseling.
Supervising District Attorney
Margo Smith, who prosecuted the
case, said one of the victims told

her that placing Archuleta in jail
would be a "waste of his abilities."
The decision to try the case as
a misdemeanor rather than a
felony was motivated both by a
desire to prevent the victims from
having to testify as well as
Archuleta's cooperation with
police, said Smith.
"The conduct did not necessi
tate it being a felony. There was
no touching and all but one
(videotape) had no full nudity,"
said Smith. "There was no
improper conduct, no lewd words
(on the videotapes)."
"It was just kind of like a
Peeping Tom," she added.
Archuleta faced a maximum
sentence of two years in jail and a
$5,000 fine for the misdemeanor
counts.
Smith said Archuleta video
taped a total of 11 women. Six
women, including one University
staff member, pressed charges.
Smith added that tapes depict
ing sex acts involving personal
friends of Archuleta were not
used in the prosecution.
Archuleta originally faced four
misdemeanor eavesdropping
counts, but two were dropped by
Judge Rene Navarro. Navarro
also ordered that all the tapes be
destroyed 10 days after the hear
ing unless victims request to keep
personal footage.
Archuleta, a Stanford graduate
and an 11-year University
employee, was also director of the
Black Community Services
Center. He resigned June 2 after
being arrested for covertly video
taping women during still photog
raphy sessions in his apartment.
In addition to filming the
women changing outfits, Archuleta
used the video camera to shoot up
the victims' dresses during various
poses for his still camera
The police investigation began
after one of the victims used a
pass-key to enter Archuleta's res
ident fellow apartment and seize
some tapes.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said the University would
begin a national search this sum
mer for Archuleta's replacement.
Jackson said he hopes to find a
replacement by early fall.

Budget plan to tap
endowment, borrow
Stanford will significantly
increase its endowment payout
rate and borrow more than $45
million to soften the blow of the
University's projected two-year
$125 million budget shortfall,
according to a plan approved by
the Board of Trustees.
The plan is a marked depar
ture from past short-term budget
remedies, which typically rely on
spending unrestricted reserves.
The $125 million deficit is pro
jected for the current fiscal year as
well as the two-year period when
the University's deficit-reduction
plan will be implemented.
Stanford recently completed a
$43 million plan containing sig
nificant administrative and acad
emic budget cuts that will be put
in place over a two-year period.
Large one-time expenditures,
such as a staff early retirement
program and expenses related to
improving the University's cost
accounting systems, added to the
projected shortfall, according to
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van
Etten.
The financing plan will provide
the "breathing room needed to
implement the budget cuts we
identified in January — $43 mil
lion over the next three years —
in phases instead of immediately.
That gives us important stability
in preserving academic programs
and jobs," Van Etten said in a
statement yesterday.
The endowment payout rate —
the amount of interest used as
operating budget revenue — will
increase by two percent, from
4.75 percent to 6.75 percent, for
the next two years and generate
an additional $44 million.
University Budget Director
Tim Warner said the endowment
payout rate could be temporarily
increased because of "superior

returns in the 1980s."
From 1983 to 1991, Stanford
earned an average 16 percent
return on the endowment, but
only 4.3 percent was spent in the
operating budget, Van Etten said.

Ironically,
several faculty
members as well
as the former
Council of
Presidents had
called on the
administration
last year to
increase the
endowment pay-

out rate to lessen the severity of
the impending budget cuts.
The deficit financing program,
approved by the trustees at their
June meeting, also calls for
Stanford to borrow $45 million
and spend $15 million from unre
stricted reserves.
University budget planners
must still identify $21 million to
cover the remainder of the $125
million shortfall. The borrowed
funds will be repaid over a 15-
year period.
By spending only a small
amount of unrestricted reserves,
Van Etten said he believes the
University will maintain better
financial flexibility in the long
run. He added that staying away
from the reserves will also help
maintain the University's strong
credit rating.
This plan replaces one adopted
by trustees last year that autho
rized the use of up to $100 mil
lion of unrestricted reserves to
cover short-term deficits.

Green to stay open
until midnight
Green Library will continue to
maintain its usual hours in the fall
— staying open until midnight

Sundays through Thursdays —
instead of closing at 10 p.m., as
library officials had proposed earli
er this year.
After staff members recorded
heavy use of the library during
later hours, library officials decided
to delete a budget reduction pro
posal to close two hours early next
year, according to Karen Nagy,
director of academic information
resources for the University's
libraries.
The decision to stay open until
midnight was made in the middle
of June, and officials are now
working on the "internal realloca
tion of funds" necessary to offset
the decision, Nagy said. The pro
posal to change Green's hours
would have saved the library
$75,000 to $100,000.
Nagy said the loss of savings
from the proposed cut of Green's
hours would not be reflected in
cuts to other libraries' hours. She
added that the amount saved
"wasn't that great."
Following the original proposal
to revise Green's hours, many
students complained. Library
administrators then conducted a
"user survey" by having staff
members tally the rates and
times different services in Green
and Cubberly libraries were used
during a week in mid-May.

Student aid bill
passes Senate
The U.S. Senate approved
compromise legislation Tuesday
that will help students from mid
dle-income families pay for col
lege with government grants and
loans.
The lawmakers approved a
"direct-loan" pilot program for
about 200 schools that would
eliminate banks and other inter
mediaries from the student loan
process. Congressional auditors
have estimated the government
could save nearly $1 billion a year
by replacing the current subsi
dized student loan system and its
middlemen banks.
The program was hailed as "a
major step toward changing the
way Americans pay for college"
by Sen. David Durenberger, R-
Minn, an author of the program.
Under the pilot program, the
government will lend the money
for college or trade schools direct
ly to students, rather than pay a
subsidy to banks to make the
loans.
The bill also requires all
lenders of federal guaranteed stu
dent loans to offer borrowers
either graduated or income-sensi
tive repayment options.
Sponsors of the bill expect it to
be approved in the House next
week and then be sent to
President Bush.
If the legislation is passed,
schools must apply to participate
in the pilot program, said a
spokesperson for Sen. John
Seymour's office yesterday.
Richard Huff, director of the
Financial Aid Office, said that
Stanford must examine the final
legislation before deciding
whether or not to participate in
the program.
In order to make subsidized
loans available to more middle
income families, the calculation


Van Etten
of assets used to determine stu
dent aid eligibility will no longer
take into account a family's equi
ty in their home and college sav
ings accounts.
Huff said the change in equity
calculations could cause the
University to spend more on stu
dent aid.
"The University now has a job
of finding out how to fund these
changes," Huff said.
In addition to the change in
equity calculations, the legislation
calls for raising income ceilings
for students seeking Pell grants of
up to $2,400 a year. The annual
family income cutoff of a student
from a family of four would be
raised from $30,000 to $42,000.
About 700 Stanford under
graduates currently receive Pell
grants, said Huff. His office has
not yet calculated how many
more students would be eligible
under the new income cutoff.
Huff said that he was pleased
with the legislation. "We can't
tell how Stanford students will
benefit in specific right now," he
said. "But it's a very positive
development."

Employee arrested
for cruelty to son
Daniel Blomquist, an assistant
manager in the Controller's
Office, was charged Friday
evening with cruelty to his son
after a series of severe spankings
apparently inspired by religious
fanaticism, according to a
Campbell Police report.
Blomquist, described by
acquaintances as a devout
Christian, is currently being held
at the Santa Clara County Jail for
corporal injury to his son. Bail was
set at $150,000. His wife, Ethel
Blomquist, is expected to be
arrested today and also charged
with cruelty to the child.
According to the report,
Blomquist's 11-year-old son
Steven had severe bruising on his
buttocks and "appeared to be
very malnourished."
Blomquist told police that he
was "given authority by God" to

spank his son. "We are to disci
pline our children. Steven was
not willing to accept that he was
wrong," said Blomquist, accord
ing to the report.
In addition to the spankings,

police documents show that
Blomquist only provided his son
with one quart of unprocessed raw
milk, three eggs and some "food
supplements" as food each day.
Although the child was severe

ly malnourished, he was never
taken to a hospital because his
parents believed "he was never
that bad," according to the
report. Blomquist told police that
a specialist would come to the
home to care for the child, but he
declined to identify the person.
The case came to the attention
of police when Steven Blomquist
became gravely ill last Friday and
paramedics were summoned to
the Blomquist home. As of
Tuesday, the boy was in stable
condition at Stanford's Lucile
Salter Packard Children's
Hospital. •
Bob Vanadagriff, associate
director of administration in the
Controller's Office and a former
boss of Blomquist, said that
Blomquist was a religious and
sincere man. "I am completely
amazed at his arrest,"
Vanadagriff said. But another
friend described the Blomquists
as "in their own world," accord
ing to the police report.

Archuleta sentenced
to probation, service
Keith Archuleta, former assis
tant dean of students, was sen
tenced last week to four years pro
bation and 200 hours of commu
nity service for secretly videotap
ing women changing clothes in his
Mirrielees apartment.
Archuleta pleaded no contest to
two misdemeanor counts of elec
tronic eavesdropping at his arraign
ment in Santa Clara County
Municipal Court in Palo Alto. He
was not present at the hearing.
"Mr. Archuleta feels very sad
dened by the pain he has caused
people," said his attorney, Tom
Nolan. "It's unfortunate that
someone who has done so much
for so many people finds himself
in this situation."
Archuleta admitted to The
Daily in June that he had a
"problem," and said he would
seek psychological counseling.
Nolan said Archuleta is currently
receiving counseling.
Supervising District Attorney
Margo Smith, who prosecuted the
case, said one of the victims told

her that placing Archuleta in jail
would be a "waste of his abilities."
The decision to try the case as
a misdemeanor rather than a
felony was motivated both by a
desire to prevent the victims from
having to testify as well as
Archuleta's cooperation with
police, said Smith.
"The conduct did not necessi
tate it being a felony. There was
no touching and all but one
(videotape) had no full nudity,"
said Smith. "There was no
improper conduct, no lewd words
(on the videotapes)."
"It was just kind of like a
Peeping Tom," she added.
Archuleta faced a maximum
sentence of two years in jail and a
$5,000 fine for the misdemeanor
counts.
Smith said Archuleta video
taped a total of 11 women. Six
women, including one University
staff member, pressed charges.
Smith added that tapes depict
ing sex acts involving personal
friends of Archuleta were not
used in the prosecution.
Archuleta originally faced four
misdemeanor eavesdropping
counts, but two were dropped by
Judge Rene Navarro. Navarro
also ordered that all the tapes be
destroyed 10 days after the hear
ing unless victims request to keep
personal footage.
Archuleta, a Stanford graduate
and an 11-year University
employee, was also director of the
Black Community Services
Center. He resigned June 2 after
being arrested for covertly video
taping women during still photog
raphy sessions in his apartment.
In addition to filming the
women changing outfits, Archuleta
used the video camera to shoot up
the victims' dresses during various
poses for his still camera
The police investigation began
after one of the victims used a
pass-key to enter Archuleta's res
ident fellow apartment and seize
some tapes.
Dean of Students Michael
Jackson said the University would
begin a national search this sum
mer for Archuleta's replacement.
Jackson said he hopes to find a
replacement by early fall.
