# FREEDOM VS. REGULATION
## SPEECH CODE COULD FALL IN CHANGED CAMPUS POLITICAL CLIMATE 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Dozens of speech codes at colleges
across the country may fall as a
result of a Supreme Court ruling
that restricts bans on "hate speech," uni
versity officials and legal experts say.
And while Stanford, as a private institu
tion, faces fewer constitutional restraints,
many say the ruling may act as an impor
tant symbolic tool for those who oppose
the controversial Grey interpretation of
the Fundamental Standard, which was
enacted in 1990.
The ruling may even trigger a renewed
debate over the merits of the Grey inter
pretation — this time in a political climate
in which the activism of the multicultural
movement has been replaced by a more
conservative tone.
But the national ramifications of the
unanimous decision that struck down a St.
Paul city ordinance June 22 will not
become apparent until the Supreme Court
rules on similar cases and defines the
ambiguities of its decision, legal experts
say.
Justice Antonin Scalia's majority deci
sion — which was signed by five justices,
while four others sharply disagreed over
how to approach the case — takes a wide
swipe at speech codes and political correct
ness on campus, but leaves the thorniest
questions unresolved, many scholars say.
"The problem with Scalia's opinion is
he spends an enormous amount of time
talking about exceptions to the rule," said
Abner Green, a law professor at the
University of Chicago, where Scalia once
taught.
Scalia's decision, while acknowledging
that the government has the right to limit
speech, said it could not single out certain
types of speech for special punishment.
The danger, Scalia said, is that the govern
ment may unfairly favor one kind of
speech over another.
If the government is to regulate speech
— such as derogatory "fighting words,"
which Stanford's policy centers upon — it
must regulate all fighting words, not just
those that it finds distasteful, Scalia said.
But Scalia makes an exception to his
general principle for laws that regulate
conduct, such as those prohibiting sexual
discrimination or harassment.
Stanford's policy likely falls under that
exception, and would remain valid even if
Stanford were a public institution, said

Law Prof. Thomas Grey, the policy's
author.
"As long as you're generally regulating
conduct, and incidentally, as part of that,
catch speech, you're not caught up in this
ruling," he said. The intention of
Stanford's policy, Grey said, is to prohibit
discriminatory conduct, not to restrict cer
tain kinds of speech.
As an example, he said, "Sexual harass
ment prohibitions would catch up sexually
derogatory fighting words, along with
many other words."
Stanford's code punishes students who
use harsh, insulting language — aimed
directly at a person or small group of peo
ple — that is intended to stigmatize based
on ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual
orientation, physical handicap or religion.
Legal experts familiar with Stanford's
code agreed with Grey, saying the inter
pretation would probably remain valid
under the ruling. "Professor Grey has a
pretty good argument — but it's not a
slam dunk, because it's tough to see where
the (court's) decision is going," said
Charles Calleros, a law professor at
Arizona State University who was a visit
ing professor at Stanford last year.
Because the Grey interpretation begins
with a general prohibition of discriminatory
conduct, focusing on the idea that actions
creating a hostile environment for individu
als are impermissible, the code is probably
acceptable, Calleros said. "That's the kind
of thing Justice Scalia says his opinion
won't necessarily overrule," he said.
Nevertheless, many say that Stanford,
in the wake of a ruling that strongly
rebukes the idea of regulating some kinds
of speech but not others, should reexamine
its policy.
"We need to recognize an opportunity to
take a fresh look at the code we've got and
decide if we're pleased with it," said
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole, who
supported the Grey interpretation when it
was approved.
In the last few years, more than 100 col
leges nationwide have adopted some sort
of speech code, struggling to balance the
need to thwart racism on campus while
avoiding measures that would prevent the
free exchange of ideas.
But the codes have sparked criticism
from many who say such limits go too far
in hindering speech, instead succumbing
to the "political correctness" perceived as
dominating campus debate.
After the court's ruling, legal experts

say dozens of the codes could be threat
ened, and some schools are already work
ing to change their codes before they face
challenges in the courts.
At Stanford, the movement to enact a
speech code galvanized around a well-pub
licized racial incident at Ujamaa House in
late 1988, in which a poster of Beethoven
was defaced and given stereotypical black
features by two white freshmen. A poster
was later found in the house with the word
"Niggers" scrawled across it.
The incident was a symbolic impetus in
the debate over the speech code, coming in
the midst of widespread discussion of mul
ticultural and racial issues on campus.
Proponents of the code argued that a
speech code would make the guidelines for
student conduct explicit, preventing con
flicts over how to punish students for
racially offensive actions.
The code, Cole said, "is undeniably use
ful to someone such as I who is charged
with responding to student misconduct."
She cited the February incident at Otero,
in which law student Keith Rabois made
homophobic remarks directed at the resi
dence of the dormitory's resident fellow, as
an example. The incident "was not a viola
tion — that was clear," Cole said. "But
without the policy, we might have argued
for months."
Others, however, maintain that the
kinds of speech the code restricts are
unlikely to occur, and point out that the
code has not been invoked in the two years
since it was enacted. But the deadening
effect the code has had on speech is clear,
they say.
"It's thought to serve a symbolic pur
pose, showing campus opposition to
racism," said Law Prof. William Cohen,
who has been an outspoken opponent of
the code. "But I'm not sure you buy
enough symbolism with the chilling effect
that may occur."
Cohen added that most students are
uncertain about the exact prohibitions of
the code. "And what happens when you're
not sure is you run away."
Most agree that the political climate on
campus is vastly different from that of two
years ago — which may tilt the debate,
this time around, toward those who oppose
the speech code.
A Daily poll taken in May 1990, two
weeks before the Grey interpretation was
approved, found that more than 40 per
cent of students felt the code was either
fair or did not go far enough in limiting

discriminatory speech, while 35 percent
said the proposal went too far.
By spring of this year, as racial issues
have receded, it appears that opposition to
the interpretation has grown. An ASSU
advisory referenda on this year's student
election ballot found that of nearly 3,000
students who had an opinion, 63 percent
support rescinding the Grey interpreta
tion, while 37 percent say it should
remain.
Graduate student Douglas Bone, a for
mer ASSU senator who will be a member
of the Student Conduct Legislative
Council next year, said he hopes the coun
cil — which is the only body with the
power to change the Fundamental
Standard — will rescind the interpretation
next year.
The Supreme Court's ruling — and
other court rulings striking down hate
speech laws — "have highlighted to people
the importance of the First Amendment,"
Bone said.
Cole believes the code should be clari
fied, regardless of larger questions about
its value. During debate over the Rabois
incident, she said, administrators realized
that the Grey interpretation, as it is cur
rently written, applies only to verbal
assaults directed by a student toward
another student — not to assaults directed
by a student toward a staff or faculty
member.
That was never the intention of those
who originally proposed the speech code,
Cole said, adding that administrators hope
the SCLC will address the issue when it
begins meeting this fall. "That will provide
the opportunity to open it up to a wider
debate," she said.
Bone, for one, says he relishes the
opportunity to challenge the code. "The
fact that the Stanford speech code makes
it legal to say some things about some
groups and not other things about other
groups," he said, "seems to be exactly the
kind of conduct that the Supreme Court
was trying to eliminate."

speech code galvanized around a well-pub
licized racial incident at Ujamaa House in
late 1988, in which a poster of Beethoven
was defaced and given stereotypical black
features by two white freshmen. A poster
was later found in the house with the word
"Niggers" scrawled across it.
The incident was a symbolic impetus in
the debate over the speech code, coming in
the midst of widespread discussion of mul
ticultural and racial issues on campus.
Proponents of the code argued that a
speech code would make the guidelines for
student conduct explicit, preventing con
flicts over how to punish students for
racially offensive actions.
The code, Cole said, "is undeniably use
ful to someone such as I who is charged
with responding to student misconduct."
She cited the February incident at Otero,
in which law student Keith Rabois made
homophobic remarks directed at the resi
dence of the dormitory's resident fellow, as
an example. The incident "was not a viola
tion — that was clear," Cole said. "But
without the policy, we might have argued
for months."
Others, however, maintain that the
kinds of speech the code restricts are
unlikely to occur, and point out that the
code has not been invoked in the two years
since it was enacted. But the deadening
effect the code has had on speech is clear,
they say.
"It's thought to serve a symbolic pur
pose, showing campus opposition to
racism," said Law Prof. William Cohen,
who has been an outspoken opponent of
the code. "But I'm not sure you buy
enough symbolism with the chilling effect
that may occur."
Cohen added that most students are
uncertain about the exact prohibitions of
the code. "And what happens when you're
not sure is you run away."
Most agree that the political climate on
campus is vastly different from that of two
years ago — which may tilt the debate,
this time around, toward those who oppose
the speech code.
A Daily poll taken in May 1990, two
weeks before the Grey interpretation was
approved, found that more than 40 per
cent of students felt the code was either
fair or did not go far enough in limiting

discriminatory speech, while 35 percent
said the proposal went too far.
By spring of this year, as racial issues
have receded, it appears that opposition to
the interpretation has grown. An ASSU
advisory referenda on this year's student
election ballot found that of nearly 3,000
students who had an opinion, 63 percent
support rescinding the Grey interpreta
tion, while 37 percent say it should
remain.
Graduate student Douglas Bone, a for
mer ASSU senator who will be a member
of the Student Conduct Legislative
Council next year, said he hopes the coun
cil — which is the only body with the
power to change the Fundamental
Standard — will rescind the interpretation
next year.
The Supreme Court's ruling — and
other court rulings striking down hate
speech laws — "have highlighted to people
the importance of the First Amendment,"
Bone said.
Cole believes the code should be clari
fied, regardless of larger questions about
its value. During debate over the Rabois
incident, she said, administrators realized
that the Grey interpretation, as it is cur
rently written, applies only to verbal
assaults directed by a student toward
another student — not to assaults directed
by a student toward a staff or faculty
member.
That was never the intention of those
who originally proposed the speech code,
Cole said, adding that administrators hope
the SCLC will address the issue when it
begins meeting this fall. "That will provide
the opportunity to open it up to a wider
debate," she said.
Bone, for one, says he relishes the
opportunity to challenge the code. "The
fact that the Stanford speech code makes
it legal to say some things about some
groups and not other things about other
groups," he said, "seems to be exactly the
kind of conduct that the Supreme Court
was trying to eliminate."

TWO SUPREME COURT DECISIONS
ON THE CONTROVERSIAL
ISSUES OF FREE SPEECH
AND ABORTION PIT INDIVIDUAL
RIGHTS AGAINST ORDINANCES
THAT PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF
OTHERS. AS A RESULT, MANY AT
STANFORD ARE DEFINING WHAT
THIS MEANS FOR THE COMMUNITY.


Andy Efron — Daily file
Fliers hanging in Ujamaa House were defaced with racist graffiti in October 1988. This incident was one of a few which led to a revised
interpretation of the Fundamental Standard in 1990. Almost four years later, a Supreme Court ruling that restricts bans on speech has
some re-evaluating Stanford's speech code.

Dozens of speech codes at colleges
across the country may fall as a
result of a Supreme Court ruling
that restricts bans on "hate speech," uni
versity officials and legal experts say.
And while Stanford, as a private institu
tion, faces fewer constitutional restraints,
many say the ruling may act as an impor
tant symbolic tool for those who oppose
the controversial Grey interpretation of
the Fundamental Standard, which was
enacted in 1990.
The ruling may even trigger a renewed
debate over the merits of the Grey inter
pretation — this time in a political climate
in which the activism of the multicultural
movement has been replaced by a more
conservative tone.
But the national ramifications of the
unanimous decision that struck down a St.
Paul city ordinance June 22 will not
become apparent until the Supreme Court
rules on similar cases and defines the
ambiguities of its decision, legal experts
say.
Justice Antonin Scalia's majority deci
sion — which was signed by five justices,
while four others sharply disagreed over
how to approach the case — takes a wide
swipe at speech codes and political correct
ness on campus, but leaves the thorniest
questions unresolved, many scholars say.
"The problem with Scalia's opinion is
he spends an enormous amount of time
talking about exceptions to the rule," said
Abner Green, a law professor at the
University of Chicago, where Scalia once
taught.
Scalia's decision, while acknowledging
that the government has the right to limit
speech, said it could not single out certain
types of speech for special punishment.
The danger, Scalia said, is that the govern
ment may unfairly favor one kind of
speech over another.
If the government is to regulate speech
— such as derogatory "fighting words,"
which Stanford's policy centers upon — it
must regulate all fighting words, not just
those that it finds distasteful, Scalia said.
But Scalia makes an exception to his
general principle for laws that regulate
conduct, such as those prohibiting sexual
discrimination or harassment.
Stanford's policy likely falls under that
exception, and would remain valid even if
Stanford were a public institution, said

Law Prof. Thomas Grey, the policy's
author.
"As long as you're generally regulating
conduct, and incidentally, as part of that,
catch speech, you're not caught up in this
ruling," he said. The intention of
Stanford's policy, Grey said, is to prohibit
discriminatory conduct, not to restrict cer
tain kinds of speech.
As an example, he said, "Sexual harass
ment prohibitions would catch up sexually
derogatory fighting words, along with
many other words."
Stanford's code punishes students who
use harsh, insulting language — aimed
directly at a person or small group of peo
ple — that is intended to stigmatize based
on ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual
orientation, physical handicap or religion.
Legal experts familiar with Stanford's
code agreed with Grey, saying the inter
pretation would probably remain valid
under the ruling. "Professor Grey has a
pretty good argument — but it's not a
slam dunk, because it's tough to see where
the (court's) decision is going," said
Charles Calleros, a law professor at
Arizona State University who was a visit
ing professor at Stanford last year.
Because the Grey interpretation begins
with a general prohibition of discriminatory
conduct, focusing on the idea that actions
creating a hostile environment for individu
als are impermissible, the code is probably
acceptable, Calleros said. "That's the kind
of thing Justice Scalia says his opinion
won't necessarily overrule," he said.
Nevertheless, many say that Stanford,
in the wake of a ruling that strongly
rebukes the idea of regulating some kinds
of speech but not others, should reexamine
its policy.
"We need to recognize an opportunity to
take a fresh look at the code we've got and
decide if we're pleased with it," said
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole, who
supported the Grey interpretation when it
was approved.
In the last few years, more than 100 col
leges nationwide have adopted some sort
of speech code, struggling to balance the
need to thwart racism on campus while
avoiding measures that would prevent the
free exchange of ideas.
But the codes have sparked criticism
from many who say such limits go too far
in hindering speech, instead succumbing
to the "political correctness" perceived as
dominating campus debate.
After the court's ruling, legal experts

say dozens of the codes could be threat
ened, and some schools are already work
ing to change their codes before they face
challenges in the courts.
At Stanford, the movement to enact a
speech code galvanized around a well-pub
licized racial incident at Ujamaa House in
late 1988, in which a poster of Beethoven
was defaced and given stereotypical black
features by two white freshmen. A poster
