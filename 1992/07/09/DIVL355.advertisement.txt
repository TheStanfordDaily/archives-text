The New Male Sexuality:
The Truth About Men, Sex and Pleasure
Published by Bantam Books
When Dr. Bernie Zilbergeld wrote his landmark bestseller MALE SEXUALITY In 1978.
he felt he had explored the topic of sex thoroughly. More than 600.000 copies in print
later, Zilbergeld is back with an all-new pioneering look at male sexuality. The book
answers everything you want to know about sex, relationships, and more including even
the most sensitive questions regarding intimacy, pleasure and dysfunction. Dr. Zilbergeld
counsels men and the women who love them, both in and out of relationships, on
everything from how to talk to their partners — including actual scripts — to exercises
people can do alone or together to better their sex lives.
Dr. Zilbergeld dispels the myths surrounding male sexuality, and discusses the reality
of sex for men and women in the Nineties. The book includes chapters on everything
from how to approach someone sexually for the first time and how to enhance desire
and arousal, to how to keep sex in long relationships fun and exciting. Zilbergeld
provides a guide to communicating about sex and other key relationship issues, as well
as ways to address sexual problems without guilt blame or embarrassment.

book
The Voice of the Earth
Published by Simon and Schuster
Ozone depletion, toxic waste, the greenhouse effect and other environmental
problems have become the psychopathology of our everyday life," says Theodore
Roszak. ITie epidemic psychosis of our time is the lie of believing we have no ethical
obligation to our planetary home." In his latest book. The Voice of the Earth, Roszak
attempts lo bridge the gulf between the psychological and the ecological, to see the
needs of the planet and the person as a continuum.
The Voice of the Earth is a bold work, nothing less than a psychoanalysis of civilization, one
that looks at the psychological underpinnings of our ecological crisis. Roszak is trying to do for
our relationship with the earth what Freud did for our relationships with each other."
