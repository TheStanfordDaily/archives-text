Three years ago, Hoover Institution re
search fellow Judy Shelton was busy
writing a book about economic prob
lems in the Soviet Union entitled "The
Coming Soviet Crash."
Several months ago, her prophecy having
come true, Shelton took her anti-commu
nist diatribe from Hoover's sandstone
tower all the way to Moscow, joining a
Hoover delegation in aiding the fledgling
Russian Republic develop a viable market
economy.
During her trip, she advised Russian pol
icy makers on economic issues such as cur
rency convertibility and stabilization of the
ruble.
"If you're going to criticize, you eventu
ally have to offer something constructive,"
reflected Shelton.
Shelton's new role as an adviser is typical
of many Hoover scholars in the post-Cold
War era. Long known as a bastion of capi
talism that inveighed against the evils of the
Communist system, Hoover is now assum
ing a new, expanded role as a global advising
institution, making some practical contri
butions to former Communist states as they
attempt to build democratic institutions.
"Our people were in this ivory tower set
ting writing about communism in a compar
ative and static way," said Hoover's direc
tor, John Raisian. "Now, there's no longer a
payoff in criticizing. We need to change our
sights."
In the past three years, Hoover scholars
have aided government leaders from a num
ber of countries, including Bulgaria, Roma
nia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Russia. Much of the advice deals with each

nation's embrace of capitalism — a subject
Hoover knows well — and their transforma
tion to a market economy.
Richard Sousa, an assistant director of
Hoover, cites the institution's tradition of
archiving historical materials from Europe
as well as its reputation for constantly
speaking out against communism as two
reasons Hoover has such appeal with the
former communist nations in Eastern Eu
rope and the Soviet Union.
"There is a long standing recognition of
the Hoover Institution as saying commu
nism is bad and capitalism is good," Sousa
said. "And as these countries began to
change their way of thinking, they went to a

place that would have quite
a bit of experience in study
ing free market economics."
"We see it as doing our
part to encourage interac
tion with the new Russia
. . . and with the policymak
ers who are bringing a new
set of values to Russian so
ciety," explained Assoc. Di
rector Charles Palm.
Observers at other think
tanks say Hoover's popular
ity among former commu
nist states comes as no
great surprise.
"Hoover being asked to
provide advice to these
countries is not much of a
surprise given its position
against communism," said
Charles Heatherly, vice
president for academic rela
tions at the Heritage Foun
dation, a conservative think
tank in Washington, D.C.
"It's a return to long-stand
ing friends for assistance."
The dramatic changes
have provided an opportu
nity for fellows who study a
variety of issues, not just

Eastern European and Soviet policy, to par
ticipate in the advisory process. Many of the
Hoover scholars who regularly are consult
ed by emerging democracies are experts in
fields like tax policy, labor relations and
property rights who wish to get "involved in
the transition business," Raisian said.
"Many of our scholars have sort of reor
ganized their research," said Palm. "For ex
ample, some of our economists have become
very interested in how a closed society
makes a transition to an open, democratic
society."
The institution, founded in 1919 by
Stanford alumnus and trustee Her
bert Hoover nine years before he be
came President, began as a collection of
books and documents on World War I and
international humanitarian relief.
Not long after its formation, the institu
tion expanded its mission to collecting other
materials and sponsoring the research of
the political, economic and social changes of
the entire 20th century.
In the 1970s and 1980s, with the addition
of free market economists such as Milton
Friedman and George Steigler, Hoover de
veloped a reputation as a domestic policy

center. During the Reagan years, numerous
Hoover scholars went to Washington, D.C.,
taking active policy-making and advising
roles in the conservative president's admin
istration.
But now, as ultra-conservative economic
policies have become less popular domesti
cally, many Hoover scholars are shifting
their zeal for involvement to an interna
tional audience.
Hoover officials, however, downplay talk
about recent shifts in their mission. "We
like to think we are doing the same thing
we've always done. The world has changed;
we like to think we are changing with it,"
said Sousa. "But if you call what is happen-

ing in the world a radical change, then it has
been a radical change at Hoover."
"This is one of the most important activ
ities that is going on in the world today —
the reformation of this communist, basical
ly evil system, and changing it," Palm said.
Mikhail Bernstam is one of several
Hoover scholars whose research
scope has been changed significant
ly by the dramatic political and economic
transformation in Russia.
A Russian emigre who has been in the
United States for 15 years, Bernstam used
to study domestic economic issues, examin
ing large amounts of census data for his
work.
But now, the magnetic reels of American
demographic data rest on his bookshelf, col
lecting dust. For the past two years, Bern
stam has devoted his time to analyzing the
economic woes that plague his native coun
try.
Even before last year's failed coup, Bern
stam was asked by the leadership of the
Russian Parliament to develop an economic
reform plan. At the time, he said, Hoover
was the "one and only" Western think tank
that was working with the Russians and

Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
Since then, Bernstam has made seven
trips to Russia, working together with the
Federation's legislative and executive
branches as well as other Hoover scholars in
drafting and implementing plans for eco
nomic reform.
He Co-authored an economic reform pro
posal with eight other Hoover fellows and
four Russian scholars that was endorsed by
the Russian Parliament in April. The work
has been the only joint economic reform
proposal between Russians and the West
thus far, he said.
Parts of the proposal are already being
used by the government, added Bernstam.

Reflecting on the in
creased responsibilities
that accompany his new
role as an adviser, he said,
"The difference is that in
the past, my activities
could harm only myself.
But now what I'm doing
could potentially harm
many millions of people."
Yet he remains opti
mistic that his proposals,
including one calling for
the gradual privatization
of the energy sector, even
tually will succeed.
In February, Bernstam
was asked to prepare an
other paper on ways to im
plement further reforms
under the prevailing eco
nomic conditions, he said.
Last week, the speaker
of the Russian Parliament
approved of Bernstam's
work and said it will be dis
tributed and discussed as
one of the official courses
of future reform at the
Parliament's session this
month. Yeltsin's advisers
have also used the plan to

prepare the president's two-year reform
program.
"If our advice has helped him a little bit
and has helped them move toward democra
cy, then we must thank God that we did
something useful in our lives," said Bern
stam, who is leaving next week for yet an
other visit to Moscow.
But Bernstam added that Western advis
ers must understand their proper role. "We
are just advisers — not policy-makers," he
said. "Foreigners should never impose any
solutions and should never try to make pol
' . H
icy.
He is especially critical of current Inter
national Monetary Fund plans that would
impose foreign regulations on the course of
Russian economic reform. Although he said
he believes the cash infusion of several bil
lion dollars that the IMF might provide
would be beneficial, the organization's re
quest to lift price controls in the energy sec
tor would devastate Russian industry.
Bernstam said he thinks that Yeltsin will
soon turn the IMF plans down, and that
would place even more importance on
strong, internal reforms. "They don't need
a stabilizing fund if they conduct correct
policy at home," he explained.



Senior research fellow Mikhail Bernstam has provided instrumental eco
nomic advice to the Russian Republic as It attempts to embrace free mar
ket reforms. On his desk is a copy of the reform proposal he co-authored.

thus far, he said.
Parts of the proposal are already being
used by the government, added Bernstam.

Reflecting on the in
creased responsibilities
that accompany his new
role as an adviser, he said,
"The difference is that in
the past, my activities
could harm only myself.
But now what I'm doing
could potentially harm
many millions of people."
Yet he remains opti
mistic that his proposals,
including one calling for
the gradual privatization
of the energy sector, even
tually will succeed.
In February, Bernstam
was asked to prepare an
other paper on ways to im
plement further reforms
under the prevailing eco
nomic conditions, he said.
Last week, the speaker
of the Russian Parliament
approved of Bernstam's
work and said it will be dis
tributed and discussed as
one of the official courses
of future reform at the
Parliament's session this
month. Yeltsin's advisers
have also used the plan to

prepare the president's two-year reform
program.
"If our advice has helped him a little bit
and has helped them move toward democra
cy, then we must thank God that we did
something useful in our lives," said Bern
stam, who is leaving next week for yet an
other visit to Moscow.
But Bernstam added that Western advis
ers must understand their proper role. "We
are just advisers — not policy-makers," he
said. "Foreigners should never impose any
solutions and should never try to make pol
' . H
icy.
He is especially critical of current Inter
national Monetary Fund plans that would
impose foreign regulations on the course of
Russian economic reform. Although he said
he believes the cash infusion of several bil
lion dollars that the IMF might provide
would be beneficial, the organization's re
quest to lift price controls in the energy sec

Bernstam said he thinks that Yeltsin will
soon turn the IMF plans down, and that
would place even more importance on
strong, internal reforms. "They don't need
a stabilizing fund if they conduct correct
policy at home," he explained.



Senior research fellow Mikhail Bernstam has provided instrumental eco
nomic advice to the Russian Republic as It attempts to embrace free mar
ket reforms. On his desk is a copy of the reform proposal he co-authored.
Three years ago, Hoover Institution re
search fellow Judy Shelton was busy
writing a book about economic prob
lems in the Soviet Union entitled "The
Coming Soviet Crash."
Several months ago, her prophecy having
come true, Shelton took her anti-commu
nist diatribe from Hoover's sandstone
tower all the way to Moscow, joining a
Hoover delegation in aiding the fledgling
Russian Republic develop a viable market
economy.
During her trip, she advised Russian pol
icy makers on economic issues such as cur
rency convertibility and stabilization of the
ruble.
"If you're going to criticize, you eventu
ally have to offer something constructive,"
reflected Shelton.
Shelton's new role as an adviser is typical
of many Hoover scholars in the post-Cold
War era. Long known as a bastion of capi
talism that inveighed against the evils of the
Communist system, Hoover is now assum
ing a new, expanded role as a global advising
institution, making some practical contri
butions to former Communist states as they
attempt to build democratic institutions.
"Our people were in this ivory tower set
ting writing about communism in a compar
ative and static way," said Hoover's direc
tor, John Raisian. "Now, there's no longer a
payoff in criticizing. We need to change our
sights."
In the past three years, Hoover scholars
have aided government leaders from a num
ber of countries, including Bulgaria, Roma
nia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Russia. Much of the advice deals with each

nation's embrace of capitalism — a subject
Hoover knows well — and their transforma
tion to a market economy.
Richard Sousa, an assistant director of
Hoover, cites the institution's tradition of
archiving historical materials from Europe
as well as its reputation for constantly
speaking out against communism as two
reasons Hoover has such appeal with the
former communist nations in Eastern Eu
rope and the Soviet Union.
"There is a long standing recognition of
the Hoover Institution as saying commu
nism is bad and capitalism is good," Sousa
said. "And as these countries began to
change their way of thinking, they went to a

place that would have quite
a bit of experience in study
ing free market economics."
"We see it as doing our
part to encourage interac
tion with the new Russia
. . . and with the policymak
ers who are bringing a new
set of values to Russian so
ciety," explained Assoc. Di
rector Charles Palm.
Observers at other think
tanks say Hoover's popular
ity among former commu
nist states comes as no
great surprise.
"Hoover being asked to
provide advice to these
countries is not much of a
surprise given its position
against communism," said
Charles Heatherly, vice
president for academic rela
tions at the Heritage Foun
dation, a conservative think
tank in Washington, D.C.
"It's a return to long-stand
ing friends for assistance."
The dramatic changes
have provided an opportu
nity for fellows who study a
variety of issues, not just

Eastern European and Soviet policy, to par
ticipate in the advisory process. Many of the
Hoover scholars who regularly are consult
ed by emerging democracies are experts in
fields like tax policy, labor relations and
property rights who wish to get "involved in
the transition business," Raisian said.
"Many of our scholars have sort of reor
ganized their research," said Palm. "For ex
ample, some of our economists have become
very interested in how a closed society
makes a transition to an open, democratic
society."
The institution, founded in 1919 by
Stanford alumnus and trustee Her
bert Hoover nine years before he be
came President, began as a collection of
books and documents on World War I and
international humanitarian relief.
Not long after its formation, the institu
tion expanded its mission to collecting other
materials and sponsoring the research of
the political, economic and social changes of
the entire 20th century.
In the 1970s and 1980s, with the addition
of free market economists such as Milton
Friedman and George Steigler, Hoover de
veloped a reputation as a domestic policy

center. During the Reagan years, numerous
Hoover scholars went to Washington, D.C.,
taking active policy-making and advising
roles in the conservative president's admin
istration.
But now, as ultra-conservative economic
policies have become less popular domesti
cally, many Hoover scholars are shifting
their zeal for involvement to an interna
tional audience.
Hoover officials, however, downplay talk
about recent shifts in their mission. "We
like to think we are doing the same thing
we've always done. The world has changed;
we like to think we are changing with it,"
said Sousa. "But if you call what is happen-

ing in the world a radical change, then it has
been a radical change at Hoover."
"This is one of the most important activ
ities that is going on in the world today —
the reformation of this communist, basical
ly evil system, and changing it," Palm said.
Mikhail Bernstam is one of several
Hoover scholars whose research
scope has been changed significant
ly by the dramatic political and economic
transformation in Russia.
A Russian emigre who has been in the
United States for 15 years, Bernstam used
to study domestic economic issues, examin
ing large amounts of census data for his
work.
But now, the magnetic reels of American
demographic data rest on his bookshelf, col
lecting dust. For the past two years, Bern
stam has devoted his time to analyzing the
economic woes that plague his native coun
try.
Even before last year's failed coup, Bern
stam was asked by the leadership of the
Russian Parliament to develop an economic
reform plan. At the time, he said, Hoover
was the "one and only" Western think tank
that was working with the Russians and

Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
Since then, Bernstam has made seven
trips to Russia, working together with the
Federation's legislative and executive
branches as well as other Hoover scholars in
drafting and implementing plans for eco
nomic reform.
He Co-authored an economic reform pro
posal with eight other Hoover fellows and
four Russian scholars that was endorsed by
the Russian Parliament in April. The work
has been the only joint economic reform
proposal between Russians and the West
thus far, he said.
Parts of the proposal are already being
used by the government, added Bernstam.

Reflecting on the in
creased responsibilities
that accompany his new
role as an adviser, he said,
"The difference is that in
the past, my activities
could harm only myself.
But now what I'm doing
could potentially harm
many millions of people."
Yet he remains opti
mistic that his proposals,
including one calling for
the gradual privatization
of the energy sector, even
tually will succeed.
