However, Hoover has recently come
under fire from some who see the Institu
tion as force-feeding Moscow with far-right
economists and policy-makers.
Jon Weiner, a history professor at the
University of California at Irvine, wrote re
cently in The Nation that the Hoover advis
ers are "right-wing ideologues, Republican
consultants, former Reagan operatives and
old time hustlers (who) have hyped their in
fluence on Yeltsin."
Sousa and others at Hoover brush off
these criticisms, explaining that Hoover
does not attempt to "push" advice on peo
ple. "They're wise enough to decide whether
our advice is good or bad," he said.

Fellows are also quick to
point out that Hoover does
not try to solicit work from
foreign governments, but
rather will give advice to
any government on a "ba
sically pro bono" basis,
Raisian said.
He added that the group
that Hoover has been
sending to Russia is "rela
tively balanced," with two
members who are regis
tered Democrats.
Hoover's increased
networking in the
past few years has
become a two-way street,
with numerous foreign
diplomats and scholars
making visits to Stanford.
In fact, Hoover has almost
become a must-see stop on
the West coast for big
name foreign leaders.
In the last year, South
Korean Prime Minister
Roh Tae Woo, former Sovi
et President Mikhail Gor
bachev and prime minis
ters from several Eastern

European states have visited the Institu
tion.
Raisian said he believes these interac
tions with world leaders will allow Hoover
scholars greater access to resources when
studying future global issues such as the en
vironment and free trade.
Though Hoover officials credit the pres
ence of former Secretary of State George
Shultz for the high-profile visits in the last
two years, the Institution itself appeals to
many world leaders, Sousa said.
"I think it's natural people would look to
(Shultz) when searching out advice, but I
think it's the power of the ideas . .. really
more than any individual. .. . That is what
is basically attracting them," Palm said.
But not all of Hoover's recent visitors
have been widely known political figures.
A group of coal industry managers, labor
leaders and government representatives
from the Kuzbah region of Russia visited
the Institution recently, seeking advice on
the privatization of the coal industry.
"We came up with a scheme they are
going to try," Palm said. "It's a very practi
cal contribution that we are trying to
make."
But it is not just a one-way flow of infor

mation and advice, Hoover fellows say. "We
fell that we get something out of these in
teractions too," said Sousa, adding that
both sides have an opportunity to "pick each
other's brains" during these visits.
And sometimes a visitor's suggestion can
launch Hoover into a whole new program.
For example, Hoover's new "Young
Diplomat" training program was conceived
when a deputy minister from Poland told
Shultz that "all the young people that
worked for him were either trained in
Moscow or trained by Soviets and now in the
new world order they should have a differ
ent perspective in the world. They wanted
to know how Westerners think," Sousa said.

So Hoover met the request by establish
ing a quarter-long training program for 12
to 15 politicians from around the world that
is now in its second year. The "young diplo
mats" live in graduate student housing and
take seminars offered by Hoover on topics
such as economics, diplomacy and interna
tional institutions. The diplomats also can
attend Stanford classes, Sousa said.
Raisian also hopes to incorporate Stan
ford students into some of Hoover's semi
nars and workshops in the future. "When
we have, for example, a senior U.S. govern
ment official here, we'll make it a point to
spend a couple of extra hours to have a
round table discussion with students," he
said. "We'd like to give something back to
the Stanford community."
Hoover's famed archives, which house
one of the world's leading collections
of Russian and Soviet books, docu
ments and memorabilia, also have not es
caped the tides of change sweeping the In
stitution.
Founded in 1920, Hoover's archives con
tain such rarities as files from the czars' se
cret police, communiques from Russian
diplomatic outposts, I>eon Trotsky's origi

nal papers and newspapers from before the
1917 revolution. In addition, Hoover claims
to have a copy of every issue of Pravda and
virtually every book that has come out of
Russia since the revolution.
The Institution relies on an extensive
network of collectors in the region who send
interesting material to Stanford, sometimes
secretly, said Palm, the director of the li
brary and archives.
In the last year, as the Soviet Union col
lapsed, Hoover archivists have been busy
trying to document those changes.
"We increased our collection efforts after
the (recent) revolution in order to capture
material before it was dissipated and lost,"

Palm said. "And we think
we have been very success
ful in our effort."
Hoover's biggest success
was a scholarly coup only
eight months after the
failed Soviet military coup.
In April, the Russian Feder
ation decided to allow a
joint team of Hoover and
Russian scholars to micro
film the secret records of
the Communist party. The
massive, classified archives
are expected to contain the
secrets of the Communist
party from the 1917 revolu
tion until its downfall in
August 1991.
"The Communist Party
archives are probably the
largest untapped body of
data on the history of the
20th century," Palm said.
The $3 million project,
which begins this summer,
will take five years to com
plete and calls for more
than 25 million pieces of
paper to be microfilmed.
A committee of four Stan-

ford and three Russian
scholars will begin examining the archives
this summer. Hoover's team is comprised of
Palm, Robert Conquest, a senior research
fellow and curator of Hoover's Russian and
East European collection, senior fellow
John Dunlop and History Prof. Terrence
Emmons.
The Hoover group will work with the
Committee on Archival Affairs of the Russ
ian Federation in determining which docu
ments to copy. By next year, the group
hopes to have a catalog of the materials con
tained in the archives, said Dunlop.
But since none of the files have ever been
made public, Hoover experts don't know
quite what to expect. "There probably will
be some revelations, and some facts brought
out that we didn't know," said Palm. "The
most important scholarly consequence will
be a richer understanding of how the Soviet
system operated. It will be a chance to view
their decision-making processes at work."
Palm cautioned that some crucial docu
ments might have been destroyed by Com
munist leaders over the years. But many
classified records are still presumed to re
main untouched in the archives, as Yeltsin
ordered the Party archives sealed only days
after he assumed the presidency, prevent

ing mass destruction by former Communist
Party authorities.
Dunlop said the committee's first task it
to "find out what's there."
"It's bound to be an eye opener," said
Dunlop, who specializes in post-Stalin Sovi
et history. He said he will be looking for in
formation on the "terror aspects" of the
Communist system.
The reels of microfilm will be brought
back to Hoover in stages. Once at Stanford,
the film will be available to Stanford schol
ars as well as others.
In addition, Hoover will market the mi
crofilm, selling copies of selected reels to li
braries and other interested parties. Pro
ceeds from the sales will go toward promot
ing future scholarly exchanges between
Hoover and Russia. Some of the funds will
also be used to modernize the Russian
archives.
In exchange for the opportunity to copy
the Communist Party records, Hoover will
give the Russian archives microfilms of its
extensive collection of Russian and Soviet
history.
"It's a one-for-one exchange," said Palm.
The agreement between Hoover and the
Russians was struck because of "intense
personal interactions" between scholars at
Stanford and Rudolph Pichoya, the chief
archivist of the Russian Federation, said
Palm. He explained that Hoover sought to
develop a relationship with the Russian
archivist even before last year's failed coup.
The Hoover team is now in the process of
buying and shipping equipment to Moscow,
Palm said.
Heritage's Heatherly said the agree
ment to bring microfilm copies to the Unit
ed States is a historic breakthrough because
it guarantees that future Russian political
changes will not affect the accessibility of
the records.
"It's an invaluable record that needs to
be preserved," Heatherly said. "Hoover has
done a great service for research and schol
arship as well as mankind in general."


Former Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and his wife Raisa
toured an exhibit of Hoover's
Russian collection during their
visit to Stanford in May. With
them are Hoover Director John
Raisian, at left, and former Sec
retary of State George Shultz at
right. Gorbachev viewed some
of the Institution's prized arti
facts, including statements is
sued by Czar Nicholas II during
the 1917 revolution and some of
Leon Trotsky's original papers.

is now in its second year. The "young diplo
mats" live in graduate student housing and
take seminars offered by Hoover on topics
such as economics, diplomacy and interna
tional institutions. The diplomats also can
attend Stanford classes, Sousa said.
Raisian also hopes to incorporate Stan
ford students into some of Hoover's semi
nars and workshops in the future. "When
we have, for example, a senior U.S. govern
ment official here, we'll make it a point to
spend a couple of extra hours to have a
round table discussion with students," he
said. "We'd like to give something back to
the Stanford community."
Hoover's famed archives, which house
one of the world's leading collections
of Russian and Soviet books, docu
ments and memorabilia, also have not es
caped the tides of change sweeping the In
stitution.
Founded in 1920, Hoover's archives con
tain such rarities as files from the czars' se
cret police, communiques from Russian
diplomatic outposts, I>eon Trotsky's origi

nal papers and newspapers from before the
1917 revolution. In addition, Hoover claims
to have a copy of every issue of Pravda and
virtually every book that has come out of
Russia since the revolution.
The Institution relies on an extensive
network of collectors in the region who send
interesting material to Stanford, sometimes
secretly, said Palm, the director of the li
brary and archives.
In the last year, as the Soviet Union col
lapsed, Hoover archivists have been busy
trying to document those changes.
"We increased our collection efforts after
the (recent) revolution in order to capture
material before it was dissipated and lost,"

Palm said. "And we think
we have been very success
ful in our effort."
Hoover's biggest success
was a scholarly coup only
eight months after the
failed Soviet military coup.
In April, the Russian Feder
ation decided to allow a
joint team of Hoover and
Russian scholars to micro
film the secret records of
the Communist party. The
massive, classified archives
are expected to contain the
secrets of the Communist
party from the 1917 revolu
tion until its downfall in
August 1991.
"The Communist Party
archives are probably the
largest untapped body of
data on the history of the
20th century," Palm said.
The $3 million project,
which begins this summer,
will take five years to com
plete and calls for more
than 25 million pieces of
paper to be microfilmed.
A committee of four Stan-

ford and three Russian
scholars will begin examining the archives
this summer. Hoover's team is comprised of
Palm, Robert Conquest, a senior research
fellow and curator of Hoover's Russian and
East European collection, senior fellow
John Dunlop and History Prof. Terrence
Emmons.
The Hoover group will work with the
Committee on Archival Affairs of the Russ
ian Federation in determining which docu
ments to copy. By next year, the group
hopes to have a catalog of the materials con
tained in the archives, said Dunlop.
But since none of the files have ever been
made public, Hoover experts don't know
quite what to expect. "There probably will
be some revelations, and some facts brought
out that we didn't know," said Palm. "The
most important scholarly consequence will
be a richer understanding of how the Soviet
system operated. It will be a chance to view
their decision-making processes at work."
Palm cautioned that some crucial docu
ments might have been destroyed by Com
munist leaders over the years. But many
classified records are still presumed to re
main untouched in the archives, as Yeltsin
ordered the Party archives sealed only days
after he assumed the presidency, prevent

ing mass destruction by former Communist
Party authorities.
Dunlop said the committee's first task it
to "find out what's there."
"It's bound to be an eye opener," said
Dunlop, who specializes in post-Stalin Sovi
et history. He said he will be looking for in
formation on the "terror aspects" of the
Communist system.
The reels of microfilm will be brought
back to Hoover in stages. Once at Stanford,
the film will be available to Stanford schol
ars as well as others.
In addition, Hoover will market the mi
crofilm, selling copies of selected reels to li
braries and other interested parties. Pro
ceeds from the sales will go toward promot
ing future scholarly exchanges between
Hoover and Russia. Some of the funds will
also be used to modernize the Russian
archives.
In exchange for the opportunity to copy
the Communist Party records, Hoover will
give the Russian archives microfilms of its
extensive collection of Russian and Soviet
history.
"It's a one-for-one exchange," said Palm.
The agreement between Hoover and the
Russians was struck because of "intense
personal interactions" between scholars at
Stanford and Rudolph Pichoya, the chief
archivist of the Russian Federation, said
Palm. He explained that Hoover sought to
develop a relationship with the Russian
archivist even before last year's failed coup.
The Hoover team is now in the process of
buying and shipping equipment to Moscow,
Palm said.
Heritage's Heatherly said the agree
ment to bring microfilm copies to the Unit
ed States is a historic breakthrough because
it guarantees that future Russian political
changes will not affect the accessibility of
the records.
"It's an invaluable record that needs to
be preserved," Heatherly said. "Hoover has
done a great service for research and schol
arship as well as mankind in general."


Former Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and his wife Raisa
toured an exhibit of Hoover's
Russian collection during their
visit to Stanford in May. With
them are Hoover Director John
Raisian, at left, and former Sec
retary of State George Shultz at
right. Gorbachev viewed some
of the Institution's prized arti
facts, including statements is
sued by Czar Nicholas II during
the 1917 revolution and some of
Leon Trotsky's original papers.


Charles Palm, an associate director of Hoover, peers through manu
scripts in the Institution's vast archives. Hoover has one of the world's
leading collections of Russian and Soviet material.

However, Hoover has recently come
under fire from some who see the Institu
tion as force-feeding Moscow with far-right
economists and policy-makers.
Jon Weiner, a history professor at the
University of California at Irvine, wrote re
cently in The Nation that the Hoover advis
ers are "right-wing ideologues, Republican
consultants, former Reagan operatives and
old time hustlers (who) have hyped their in
fluence on Yeltsin."
Sousa and others at Hoover brush off
these criticisms, explaining that Hoover
does not attempt to "push" advice on peo
ple. "They're wise enough to decide whether
our advice is good or bad," he said.

Fellows are also quick to
point out that Hoover does
not try to solicit work from
foreign governments, but
rather will give advice to
any government on a "ba
sically pro bono" basis,
Raisian said.
He added that the group
that Hoover has been
sending to Russia is "rela
tively balanced," with two
members who are regis
tered Democrats.
Hoover's increased
networking in the
past few years has
become a two-way street,
with numerous foreign
diplomats and scholars
making visits to Stanford.
In fact, Hoover has almost
become a must-see stop on
the West coast for big
name foreign leaders.
In the last year, South
Korean Prime Minister
Roh Tae Woo, former Sovi
et President Mikhail Gor
bachev and prime minis
ters from several Eastern

European states have visited the Institu
tion.
Raisian said he believes these interac
tions with world leaders will allow Hoover
scholars greater access to resources when
studying future global issues such as the en
vironment and free trade.
Though Hoover officials credit the pres
ence of former Secretary of State George
Shultz for the high-profile visits in the last
two years, the Institution itself appeals to
many world leaders, Sousa said.
"I think it's natural people would look to
(Shultz) when searching out advice, but I
think it's the power of the ideas . .. really
more than any individual. .. . That is what
is basically attracting them," Palm said.
But not all of Hoover's recent visitors
have been widely known political figures.
A group of coal industry managers, labor
leaders and government representatives
from the Kuzbah region of Russia visited
the Institution recently, seeking advice on
the privatization of the coal industry.
"We came up with a scheme they are
going to try," Palm said. "It's a very practi
cal contribution that we are trying to
make."
But it is not just a one-way flow of infor

mation and advice, Hoover fellows say. "We
fell that we get something out of these in
teractions too," said Sousa, adding that
both sides have an opportunity to "pick each
other's brains" during these visits.
And sometimes a visitor's suggestion can
launch Hoover into a whole new program.
For example, Hoover's new "Young
Diplomat" training program was conceived
when a deputy minister from Poland told
Shultz that "all the young people that
worked for him were either trained in
Moscow or trained by Soviets and now in the
new world order they should have a differ
ent perspective in the world. They wanted
to know how Westerners think," Sousa said.

So Hoover met the request by establish
ing a quarter-long training program for 12
to 15 politicians from around the world that
is now in its second year. The "young diplo
mats" live in graduate student housing and
take seminars offered by Hoover on topics

be a richer understanding of how the Soviet
system operated. It will be a chance to view
their decision-making processes at work."
Palm cautioned that some crucial docu
ments might have been destroyed by Com
munist leaders over the years. But many
classified records are still presumed to re
main untouched in the archives, as Yeltsin
ordered the Party archives sealed only days
after he assumed the presidency, prevent

ing mass destruction by former Communist
Party authorities.
Dunlop said the committee's first task it
to "find out what's there."
"It's bound to be an eye opener," said
Dunlop, who specializes in post-Stalin Sovi
et history. He said he will be looking for in
formation on the "terror aspects" of the
Communist system.
The reels of microfilm will be brought
back to Hoover in stages. Once at Stanford,
the film will be available to Stanford schol
ars as well as others.
In addition, Hoover will market the mi
crofilm, selling copies of selected reels to li
braries and other interested parties. Pro
ceeds from the sales will go toward promot
ing future scholarly exchanges between
Hoover and Russia. Some of the funds will
also be used to modernize the Russian
archives.
In exchange for the opportunity to copy
the Communist Party records, Hoover will
give the Russian archives microfilms of its
extensive collection of Russian and Soviet
history.
"It's a one-for-one exchange," said Palm.
The agreement between Hoover and the
Russians was struck because of "intense
personal interactions" between scholars at
Stanford and Rudolph Pichoya, the chief
archivist of the Russian Federation, said
Palm. He explained that Hoover sought to
develop a relationship with the Russian
archivist even before last year's failed coup.
The Hoover team is now in the process of
buying and shipping equipment to Moscow,
Palm said.
Heritage's Heatherly said the agree
ment to bring microfilm copies to the Unit
ed States is a historic breakthrough because
it guarantees that future Russian political
changes will not affect the accessibility of
the records.
"It's an invaluable record that needs to
be preserved," Heatherly said. "Hoover has
done a great service for research and schol
arship as well as mankind in general."


Former Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and his wife Raisa
toured an exhibit of Hoover's
Russian collection during their
visit to Stanford in May. With
them are Hoover Director John
Raisian, at left, and former Sec

of the Institution's prized arti
facts, including statements is
sued by Czar Nicholas II during
the 1917 revolution and some of
Leon Trotsky's original papers.


Charles Palm, an associate director of Hoover, peers through manu
scripts in the Institution's vast archives. Hoover has one of the world's
leading collections of Russian and Soviet material.
