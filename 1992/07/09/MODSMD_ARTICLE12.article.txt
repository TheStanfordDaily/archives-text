## From the Stanford Farm to the farm system 
### Matthew Milliken Staff writer 
What happens when a Farm
hand joins a farm team?
It will take several seasons be
fore the answer is known. But the
question will be asked every year a
Stanford baseball player is eligible
for Major League Baseball's ama
teur draft.
Last month, a school-record
eleven Card players were taken in
the draft. Among them were junior
center fielder Jeffrey Hammonds,
an Olympian expected to make a big
impact in the major leagues, and
powerful right-handed pitcher Rick
Helling, who is also on the Olympic
traveling squad. But other choices
seemed somewhat eclectic. Pro
clubs drafted six juniors, even
though some lacked significant
playing time.
Risk-taking on the part of the
scouts? Not when the school in
question is Stanford, a traditional
college baseball power. Under
head coach Mark Marquess, the
Cardinal has earned 11 postseason
appearances in the last 12 years,
two NCAA championships and a
.663 winning percentage. Assis
tant Coach Tom Dunton has
taught several big league pitchers,
including Mike Mussina, Jack Mc-
Dowell and A 1 Osuna.
This success has come while
playing in the nation's toughest
baseball conference — the Pacific
-10 Southern Division, or Six-Pac.
The high-caliber competition has
influenced professional prospects
as well as pro scouts.
"The Pac-10's prepared me
pretty well for what I'm doing
now," says junior right-hander
Jamie Sepeda, who is in the
Phillies' organization. "There,
you're facing guys that are proba
bly better than guys you're facing
now, day in and day out."
Preparing to Play
Other Stanford draftees agree
that Six-Pac competition has

helped them improve their play.
"It's definitely made me more
of a competitor," says outfielder
Steve Solomon, now with Sepeda
on the Batavia Clippers in the New
York-Penn League. "I'd hate to be
a guy from a small school, playing
in front of a thousand fans, not
knowing what it means to he up
there in the bottom of the ninth in
ning, being the winning run at the
plate. I've been there before. ... It
can only help."
Aaron Dorlarque, a right-hander
taken by Kansas City, concurs. "Be
fore I decided to go to college I
thought, 'If I'm going to be able to
play professional baseball, I've got to
be able to play in the Six-Pac.' I was
able to compete there, so I'm right
where I want to be today." Dorlarque
is now with the Eugene Emeralds of
the Northwest League, which, like
the New York-Penn League, plays
short-season Class A ball. So far he
has taken a straightforward ap
proach to games: "I've just been
throwing down the middle and let
ting them hit it, and I've been suc
cessful doing that."
Things were not so straightfor
ward before the draft. Says Sepeda,
"I only talked to the Phillies twice,
late in the year. You really have no
idea who's going to take you." Left
fielder David Cornell, a 17th round
Royals pick, agrees. "I never heard a
word from Kansas City. I heard
from 15 teams and nothing from
them.... It was a mystery. There's
no way to know when or where or
who's going to take you."
A New Focus
All four feel that their college
years have set them apart from
high school players on their teams.
"I think the most important thing
Stanford taught me is discipline,"
Dorlarque said. "I've seen a few
guys here that haven't gone to col
lege and there's a big difference in
mental stability, if you will, in
knowing that there is an alterna
tive after baseball."
Cornell, who plays in Eugene

with Dorlarque, says that Stan
ford's program has had a big im
pact on him. "The first day I came
up here we were taking batting
practice and everyone's in the out
field shagging while there's a
group hitting," he recalls. "At
Stanford we're taught to go after
every fly ball just to get better.
Then, as soon as it's over they
called us in and guys start walking
in from the outfield. I'm sprinting
in. Aaron's doing the same, and
we're kind of sticking out like sore
thumbs — but that's just the way
we were trained."
While the game is the same, the
emphasis is different. "The goal of
the manager is to improve our abili
ties," says Solomon. "Winning isn't
the important thing." Dorlarque
concurs: "The intensity level is not
as great [as in college)."
Player goals can be very differ
ent, too. "People are making a liv
ing doing this," Solomon said.
"Some people have families and
they have to support them. .. . We

get our paycheck every two weeks
and that's it."
"There are days when you get
sick of the game," Dorlarque said
about the minors' heavy schedule.
Small Towns and Long Trips
The four find their new homes
much quieter than Stanford. Cor
nell, though, enjoys the Eugene
fans and says the ballpark is a
"classic" stadium. "I'd like to skip
a game one night and just go up
there and watch with the crowd."
But the towns often seem un
eventful.
"Another transition is the bus
rides," notes Dorlarque. "It's a de
cent bus, but you get 30 hours on
there and it doesn't seem that
nice. ..." And Solomon, a Los An
geles native, finds himself baffled
by the climate of upstate New
York.
Despite the new environments,
all four have a positive outlook on
the minors. "I feel really confident
about what I'm doing now," asserts

Sepeda. After spending years on
the Farm, he and his former team
mates would now like their baseball
future to blossom.

clubs drafted six juniors, even
though some lacked significant
playing time.
Risk-taking on the part of the
scouts? Not when the school in
question is Stanford, a traditional
college baseball power. Under
head coach Mark Marquess, the
Cardinal has earned 11 postseason
appearances in the last 12 years,
two NCAA championships and a
.663 winning percentage. Assis
tant Coach Tom Dunton has
taught several big league pitchers,
including Mike Mussina, Jack Mc-
Dowell and A 1 Osuna.
This success has come while
playing in the nation's toughest
baseball conference — the Pacific
-10 Southern Division, or Six-Pac.
The high-caliber competition has
influenced professional prospects
as well as pro scouts.
"The Pac-10's prepared me
pretty well for what I'm doing
now," says junior right-hander
Jamie Sepeda, who is in the
Phillies' organization. "There,
you're facing guys that are proba
bly better than guys you're facing
now, day in and day out."
Preparing to Play
Other Stanford draftees agree
that Six-Pac competition has

helped them improve their play.
"It's definitely made me more
of a competitor," says outfielder
Steve Solomon, now with Sepeda
on the Batavia Clippers in the New
York-Penn League. "I'd hate to be
a guy from a small school, playing
in front of a thousand fans, not
knowing what it means to he up
there in the bottom of the ninth in
ning, being the winning run at the
plate. I've been there before. ... It
can only help."
Aaron Dorlarque, a right-hander
taken by Kansas City, concurs. "Be
fore I decided to go to college I
thought, 'If I'm going to be able to
play professional baseball, I've got to
be able to play in the Six-Pac.' I was
able to compete there, so I'm right
where I want to be today." Dorlarque
is now with the Eugene Emeralds of
the Northwest League, which, like
the New York-Penn League, plays
short-season Class A ball. So far he
has taken a straightforward ap
proach to games: "I've just been
throwing down the middle and let
ting them hit it, and I've been suc
cessful doing that."
Things were not so straightfor
ward before the draft. Says Sepeda,
"I only talked to the Phillies twice,
late in the year. You really have no
idea who's going to take you." Left
fielder David Cornell, a 17th round
Royals pick, agrees. "I never heard a
word from Kansas City. I heard
from 15 teams and nothing from
them.... It was a mystery. There's
no way to know when or where or
who's going to take you."
A New Focus
All four feel that their college
years have set them apart from
high school players on their teams.
"I think the most important thing
Stanford taught me is discipline,"
Dorlarque said. "I've seen a few
guys here that haven't gone to col
lege and there's a big difference in
mental stability, if you will, in
knowing that there is an alterna
tive after baseball."
Cornell, who plays in Eugene

with Dorlarque, says that Stan
ford's program has had a big im
pact on him. "The first day I came
up here we were taking batting
practice and everyone's in the out
field shagging while there's a
group hitting," he recalls. "At
Stanford we're taught to go after
every fly ball just to get better.
Then, as soon as it's over they
called us in and guys start walking
in from the outfield. I'm sprinting
in. Aaron's doing the same, and
we're kind of sticking out like sore
thumbs — but that's just the way
we were trained."
While the game is the same, the
emphasis is different. "The goal of
the manager is to improve our abili
ties," says Solomon. "Winning isn't
the important thing." Dorlarque
concurs: "The intensity level is not
as great [as in college)."
Player goals can be very differ
ent, too. "People are making a liv
ing doing this," Solomon said.
"Some people have families and
they have to support them. .. . We

get our paycheck every two weeks
and that's it."
"There are days when you get
sick of the game," Dorlarque said
about the minors' heavy schedule.
Small Towns and Long Trips
The four find their new homes
much quieter than Stanford. Cor
nell, though, enjoys the Eugene
fans and says the ballpark is a
"classic" stadium. "I'd like to skip
a game one night and just go up
there and watch with the crowd."
But the towns often seem un
eventful.
"Another transition is the bus
rides," notes Dorlarque. "It's a de
cent bus, but you get 30 hours on
there and it doesn't seem that
nice. ..." And Solomon, a Los An
geles native, finds himself baffled
by the climate of upstate New
York.
Despite the new environments,
all four have a positive outlook on
the minors. "I feel really confident
about what I'm doing now," asserts

Sepeda. After spending years on
the Farm, he and his former team
mates would now like their baseball
future to blossom.

David Cornell is one of a host of Stanford players to slide into Major League Baseball's farm system after
the league's annual draft.
What happens when a Farm
hand joins a farm team?
It will take several seasons be
fore the answer is known. But the
question will be asked every year a
Stanford baseball player is eligible
for Major League Baseball's ama
teur draft.
Last month, a school-record
eleven Card players were taken in
the draft. Among them were junior
center fielder Jeffrey Hammonds,
an Olympian expected to make a big
impact in the major leagues, and
powerful right-handed pitcher Rick
Helling, who is also on the Olympic
traveling squad. But other choices
seemed somewhat eclectic. Pro
clubs drafted six juniors, even
though some lacked significant
playing time.
Risk-taking on the part of the
scouts? Not when the school in
question is Stanford, a traditional
