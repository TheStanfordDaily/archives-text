# NOSE TO NOSE
## Who should vote for the All-Star team? 
### 
It's that time of year again.
And yet again, I must renew
my call for the Lords of Baseball
to end the travesty. I am speak
ing of America's desperate need
to end fan balloting for the All-
Star Game, which will be on
Bastille Day.
People power made a wreck of
revolutionary France, and it is
making a veritable joke of base-

ball's greatest
day. Benito Santi
ago and Wade
Boggs were voted
into this year's
game, while Dar
ren Daulton and
Edgar Martinez
are left hoping for
a manager's inclu
sion on the roster.
And this is a good
year for the fans,
Nuff said.
0.K., so who
should pick the

All-Stars? The players? Nah,
they often have personal axes to
grind with each other.
How about the All-Star team
manager? Nope. We don't really
want to put all the power for
picking teams in one guy's
hands.
I say let the sportswriters pick
the teams. Two or three sports
writers per team will pick a far
better group of players than any
group of ballot box-stuffing fans.
And to me, better players mean a

better game.
Why sportswriters specifical
ly? I can think of three very solid
reasons:
Knowledge. Sportswriters
tend to watch a lot of ball, so
they gain more firsthand knowl
edge of players than those who
get to the park a couple times a
year. Writers also are better ed
ucated about, the game, so they

know what to
look for in an All-
Star
Competence. The
writers vote for the
end-of-year individ
ual winners and
they have shown an
almost inhuman
ability to use fair
judgment
in picking
the win
ners. They even
voted Rickey
MVP in 1990 -

that's a lot more honesty than I pos
sess.
Trust. If the Lords of Baseball
allow the sportswriters to select
the Hall of Fame (except in the
case of Pete Rose, of course),
then the writers can certainly be
trusted to pick a good All-Star
team.
The All-Star Game should be
for all-stars, not for bums.
Throw the bums out — let's have
sportswriters pick the deserving
players.

There you go again, Sean.
Just because a few players
who aren't having great years
make the All-Star team, you
overreact and want to junk the
whole system we have for select
ing players.
Sean, you don't go out and
buy a new car if your Porsche has
a scratch on it.
I admit that sometimes the fans

will vote some big
name player onto
the team that
doesn't deserve to
be there. And that's
precisely why the
manager picks the
All-Star non -start
ers, so your Mar
tinezes and
Daultons
can be on
the team
like they right- |
fully deserve.
But what's so

bad about having baseball's
biggest names start the game, if
that's the way the fans want it?
The fans keep baseball alive
by paying to see games. Baseball
owners wouldn't field teams if
they didn't make money.
Sean, let's take a closer look at
the process you find so distaste
ful. Joe and Jenny Lunchpail in
Cleveland go out to see their
woeful Indians play some ball.
While at the park, they are hand
ed All-Star ballots by an usher.

Joe and Jenny don't have cable,
and they don't live in a National
League city.
So on their ballots they select
Benito Santiago because he is a
player that Joe and Jenny never
get to see, except one night a year
in the All-Star game. Bob and
Betty in Atlanta punch out Wade
Boggs' name for the same reason.
And 500n....

I agree that
sportswriters
would do a better
job picking play
ers who deserve to
be All-Stars. But
the All-Star game
isn't for the play
ers — it's for the
fans.
Fans are the
stockholders in
the company of
baseball, and once
a year they should
get to see their

dream game.
In stark contrast to the oli
garchical system you propose,
fan voting appeals to our most
fundamental notions of democ
racy. We the people have the
power to decide who will play in
our game. Proposals like yours,
Sean, will never be implement
ed, because fan voting insures
that baseball, our sport of the
people, by the people and for the
people, shall not perish from
this Earth.

for all-stars, not for bums.
Throw the bums out — let's have
sportswriters pick the deserving
players.

There you go again, Sean.
Just because a few players
who aren't having great years
make the All-Star team, you
overreact and want to junk the
whole system we have for select
ing players.
Sean, you don't go out and
buy a new car if your Porsche has
a scratch on it.
I admit that sometimes the fans

will vote some big
name player onto
the team that
doesn't deserve to
be there. And that's
precisely why the
manager picks the
All-Star non -start
ers, so your Mar
tinezes and
Daultons
can be on
the team
like they right- |
fully deserve.
But what's so

bad about having baseball's
biggest names start the game, if
that's the way the fans want it?
The fans keep baseball alive
by paying to see games. Baseball
owners wouldn't field teams if
they didn't make money.
Sean, let's take a closer look at
the process you find so distaste
ful. Joe and Jenny Lunchpail in
Cleveland go out to see their
woeful Indians play some ball.
While at the park, they are hand
ed All-Star ballots by an usher.

Joe and Jenny don't have cable,
and they don't live in a National
League city.
So on their ballots they select
Benito Santiago because he is a
player that Joe and Jenny never
get to see, except one night a year
in the All-Star game. Bob and
Betty in Atlanta punch out Wade
Boggs' name for the same reason.
And 500n....

I agree that
sportswriters
would do a better
job picking play
ers who deserve to
be All-Stars. But
the All-Star game
isn't for the play
ers — it's for the
fans.
Fans are the
stockholders in
the company of
baseball, and once
a year they should
get to see their

dream game.
In stark contrast to the oli
garchical system you propose,
fan voting appeals to our most
fundamental notions of democ
racy. We the people have the
power to decide who will play in
our game. Proposals like yours,
Sean, will never be implement
ed, because fan voting insures
that baseball, our sport of the
people, by the people and for the
people, shall not perish from
this Earth.
