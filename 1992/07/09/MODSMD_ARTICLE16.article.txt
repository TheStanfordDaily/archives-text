# Noll on a roll
## 
### 
Economics Professor Roger
Noll testified last week in the
NFL antitrust trial. Noll said that
owners hide some of their profits
by labeling them as operating ex
penses. In an analysis which Noll
performed, he found that the
amount of money spent by owners
was unrelated to the number of
wins which their teams had.
