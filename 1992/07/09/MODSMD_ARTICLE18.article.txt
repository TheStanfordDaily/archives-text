If there's one thing the Bay
Area isn't short on, it's quality
theater. From local communi
ty productions to big Broadway
musicals, we've got it all.
With New York only recently
pulling out of a theater slump
and Los Angeles becoming ever
more commercial (if that's possi
ble), San Francisco and the Penin
sula is gaining a national reputation
as the place for thriving theater.
Voted "Theater of the Year" by
the San Jose Mercury News last
year, Palo Alto's Theatre Works of
fers three major productions this
summer, two at the stunning
Mountain View Center for the Per
forming Arts and the West Coast
premiere of a musical at Palo
Alto's Lucie Stern Theatre.
"Prelude to a Kiss" closes Sun
day, just in time to avoid confusion
with the movie of the same name
opening this weekend.
As "Prelude" leaves the Moun
tain View Center, "M. Butterfly,"
Stanford graduate David Henry
Hwang's charged tale of politics,
spies and hidden identities, begins
preparations for its August 15
opening.
"M. Butterfly" will star Francis
Jue in the role of Song Liling,
which Jue understudied on Broad
way and on the national tour. Stan
ford graduate student Mark Capri
plays Gallimard, the duped lover.
This weekend, the premiere of
"The Human Comedy" arrives at
the Lucie Stern Theatre. Set in the
fictional town of Ithaca, California
during World War 11, "The Human
Comedy" portrays the joys and
heartaches of life and coming-of
nge in small-town America during
this turbulent time.

Theatre Works recently added a
limited run of A.R. Gurney's
"Love Letters" to its summer
schedule. George Ward and Miri
am Babin, currently performing in
"Prelude to a Kiss," will star in
this remarkable piece involving
the reading of a life's worth of cor
respondence exchanged between
two people.
Right next door to the Lucie
Stern Theatre is the Palo
Alto Children's Theater.
Remarkably inexpensive and star
ring amazing local youth talent,
the Children's Theater offers
three different classes of shows, all
geared toward different age
groups.
The Wingspread Company fea
tures actors from 16 to 24 years of
age performing Broadway musi
cals. The first show, "Meet Me in St.
Ixmis," closes this weekend, with
"The Cocoanuts" opening next
weekend.
Other Wingspread shows this
summer include "Bye Bye Birdie,"
"The King and I" and "Barefoot in
the Park." While The Wingspread
Program occasionally offers works
with more mature themes, the
shows are usually suited for fami
ly viewing.
For the younger kids, the Chil
dren's Theatre offers "Doctor
Dolittle" and the West Coast pre
miere of "Ragged Child," a British
play about street children of the
1850s written for 10- to 18-year
old performers.
"Doctor Dolittle" opens this
weekend with a reception for Justin
Lofling, the grandson of the author
and a former Children's Theatre
member. Hugh lx>fling's Newberry
Medal and original artwork from
the book will be on display.
Youngsters will enjoy the Chil

dren's Theatre's "hot dog shows,"
outdoor performances of fairy
tales preceded by the sale of hot
dogs, lemonade, chips and other
goodies. "Clickety Clack," "Anoth
er Tower" and "No Rooms" are the
three hot dog shows this summer.
The Wingspread Company isn't
the only group performing the mu
sical version of "Anna and the
King of Siam." Peninsula Youth
Theater offers its production of
"The Kingand I" in late July, after
"Anything Goes" closes on July 19
at Spangenberg Theater.
Another local youth theatre
presents another Broadway classic
at Foothill College in Los Altos,
host of the sprawling Festival of
the Arts this summer.
Los Altos Youth Theatre's pro
duction of "Singin* in the Rain"
premieres Friday in the Smit hwick
Theatre on the Foothill campus.
It will find competition not very
far away at Foothill's Pavilion
Theatre with "Call Me Madam,"
an Irving Berlin election year mu
sical comedy. Part of Foothill's
Summer Stock program and the
Festival of the Arts, "Call Me
Madam" closes July 19.
Later this summer, Foothill
Summer Stock also presents
"Fiorello!" a musical about former
New York City mayor Fiorello La
Guardia. Another Festival of the
Arts presentation, "Fiorello!" won
the Pulitzer Prize, the Drama
Critics Award and the Tony Award
for Best Musical.
The Festival of the Arts will also
include L'ACT (Los Altos Commu
nity Theater) productions of Eu
gene O'Neill's "Moon for the Mis
begotten" and a musical tribute to
Noel Coward, "Oh Coward!"
Foster City's Hillbarn Theatre
will make the trek south to present
the contemporary musical "Closer

Than Ever" at Foothill, in addition
to its regular Summeßepertory
season at its Foster City stage.
"Tintypes," a musical about
turn-of-the-century America,
opens Hillbarn's summer season
tonight, with "The Elephant Man"
opening tomorrow as part of the
four-production repertory.
Shakespeare with a twist is
what you'll find at Shake
speare Santa Cruz, which pre
sents the first of three summer pro
ductions starting next weekend.
Shakespeare Santa Cruz has a
history of experimenting with the
Bard's (and others') classics, updat
ing time, place and other elements
to bring fresh life to the plays.
"The Taming of the Shrew"
kicks off the SSC season in its out
door Festival Glen theater. "Mac
beth" will also utilize the Festival
Glen, this time as a nighttime pre
sentation. Ibsen's "A Doll's
House" performs in the Perform
ing Arts Theater.
Each actor in a major SSC role
performs in two different produc
tions, such as Bruce A. Young
("Basic Instinct") as Petruchio in
"Shrew" and Macduff in "Mac
beth."
Much further north, of
course, is the rich theater
community of San Fran
cisco. The City offers not only
major productions of Broadway
hits but also encourages a rich en
vironment for independent and
new productions.
This weekend, a marathon of
one-act plays will be presented as
part of the BAIT (Bay Area Inde
pendent Theatre) Fringe Festival.
Presented at Fort Mason (home
of the Magic Theater, one of the
most notable cutting-edge the

aters), the Festival will include the
Tale Spinners Theater production
of Shoshana Marchand's "Big City
Down" and the Julian Theatre's
presentation of "Charlie" by Sla
womir Mrozek.
"Big City Down" focuses on
seven contemporary teens in a San
Francisco high school, while the ab
surd comedy "Charlie" focuses on a
visit to the eye doctor as a means to
examine social oppression.
In addition, the BAIT Fringe
Festival features 11 other plays.
The larger houses are, of
course, the biggest draw in San
Francisco theater. The Best of
Broadway series just bid farewell
to Neil Simon's Tony Award-win
ning "Lost in Yonkers" and will
soon welcome Julie Harris in "Let
tice and Lovage."
Other Best of Broadway pre
sentations this summer are
"Richard III" and the national
tour premiere of Tony winner
"The Will Rogers Follies."
The City's theatrical offerings
are too numerous to exhaustively
list, but some of the more notable
productions include Berkeley
Repertory Theatre's "The Con
vict's Return" at ACT's Stage
Door Theatre and "Ladies' Room"
at Theatre on the Square.
Non-traditional works, such as
the San Francisco Mime Troupe's
"Social Work — An Election Year
Fantasy" and Fratelli Bologna's
hilarious "The Bologna Medea"
are also San Francisco theatrical
trademarks.

Most local theater events are
served by the CAP A Box Office at
329-2652. Many San Francisco
productions sell tickets through
BASS at 762-BASS, while Shake
speare Santa Cruz can be reached
at 408-459-4168.
