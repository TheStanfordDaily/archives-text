Literal film 'Kiss' flops
"Prelude to a Kiss "
Theater-goers are different than movie
goers.
The team responsible for adapting the
smash play "Prelude to a Kiss" into a fea
ture film seems to have forgotten that, turn
ing an enjoyable and thoughtful theater
piece into a basically boring and flat movie
about the meaning of true love.
Meg Ryan and Alec Baldwin (who played
the same role on Broadway) play two lovers
who marry after a whirlwind courtship. At
the wedding, Ryan and an old man (Sydney
Walker, who played the same role at Berke
ley Rep) swap souls afler they kiss.
The second half of the film examines
Peter's (Baldwin) discovery of his wife's im
poster and his struggle to determine just
what it is he loves in Rita (Ryan), her physi
cal shell or her inner self.
In "Prelude to a Kiss," virtually every
word from the play survives intact. While
faithfulness is a great trait in dogs, it doesn't
necessarily make a good film.
Theater-goers are willing to listen more
than they watch, reveling in the spoken
word and the beauty of dialogue and ideas.
Movie-goers want the medium of film uti
lized, to show them pictures to go with the
words.
Put simply, the film talks too much.
Beautiful stretches of dialogue from the
play seem to last for years when put up on
the screen, and dramatic pauses necessary
for the full impact of the ideas can be used to
go out for popcorn and a soda.
Those ideas seem much less subtle on the
big screen as well. A thoughtful commen
tary on the nature of love and what is to be
treasured in life is turned into a pedantic
and insincere treatise.
The transition to film has improved as
pects of "Prelude to a Kiss," however. Actu
ally seeing the locales Peter and Rita inhab
it adds to the ambience, and in the case of
Rita's apartment, the settings provide key
character development.
Amazingly, Baldwin, known for being a
"difficult" actor ("The Marrying Man" fi
asco, losing his role in "Patriot Games"), is
one of the best elements carried over for
stage to screen. He brings great passion
and poignancy to the role of Peter, a part
easily played as two-dimensional and su
perficial.
When Baldwin weeps over discovering
the switch, his pain over losing his love is
genuine and heartfelt.
In contrast, stage veteran Walker stun
ningly falls flat as the old man. Understand
ing the switch has taken place is crucial to
the plot, but his portrayal of Rita is too un
derstated to make it clear. It's a struggle for
the audience to keep reminding themselves
that he's really Rita, especially when Ryan
plays the old man admirably.
Ultimately, the switch scenario just
doesn't play right on film. Set entirely in re
ality save for that twist, it's simply too hard
to swallow both the intensity of the message
and the absurdity of the premise at the same
time.
It's ironic that a play worthy of adapta

tion to screen suffers because of a too literal
translation. Theater's inability to truly cap
ture reality perhaps makes it easier to palate
certain things that just don't translate well
to film.

Murphy takes low road
"Boomerang"
The Eddie Murphy responsible for box of
fice smashes like "48 Hours," "Trading
Places" and "Beverly Hills Cop" was seem
ingly absorbed by flops like "Best Defense"
and "Harlem Nights" and consumed by Art
Buchwald's successful claim to the story of
"Coming to America."
To the relief of Murphy fans, he is back,
and he's come full circle with his new pro
duction, "Boomerang," directed by Regi
nald Hudlin. Instead of a rough, pistol-tot
ing vulgarian, he plays a suave/womanizing
(depending on your view) marketing execu
tive, Marcus Graham.
This movie will appeal most to fans of
Murphy's stand-up film "Raw" —
"Boomerang" is not for the easily offended.
The film revolves around sexual exploita
tion and most jokes require a lurid sense of
humor.
The adjectives "slimy," "cold" and
"harsh" apply to Murphy's character. But
Graham is smooth, yet how smooth depends
on the gullibility of his victim. Nonetheless,
Graham's reputation as a ladies' man pro
ceeds him.
Early in the film, he is attracted to Robin
Givens' character, Jacqueline, who plays
hard to get and is eventually responsible for

making Graham feel used. She breaks his
heart just as he has done to so many others
before. The player gets played.
David Allan Grier (Gerard) and Martin
Lawrence (Tyler) star as Graham's best
friends. While providing laughs unrelated to
the plot, their primary duty is to be amazed
by his success with women.
Even before Halle Berry (Angela) begins
dating Gerard, she falls for Graham. Initial
ly he is uninterested, but then everything
you expect to happen will. Despite pre
dictability, a heavy load of humor makes
"Boomerang" enjoyable.
While Murphy, Grier and Lawrence are
in fine form, some of the best laughs are pro
vided by minor characters.
Grace Jones, who plays the international
supermodel Strange, is wonderfully crass.
Her role flows from her so naturally it in
volves no acting. Jones is perfectly cast and
always thrusts the movie into high gear
when she appears.
Tony Award-winner Geoffrey Holder
(Nelson) is tremendously animated. His
menagerie of gestures and devilishly gleeful
grin express Nelson's immersion in the erot
ic fantasy that creates wickedly funny com
mercials for the firm.
Besides comparing Graham's heartbreak
to the break-up of rappers The Fat Boys,
"Saturday Night Live's" Chris Rock — the
nosey mailroom clerk Bony T — provides a
few laughs by making Graham's sex life his
pet project.
Like many contemporary films,
"Boomerang" fulfills its politically correct
requirement with a few token lines about
the ozone layer and a shot that includes a
condom wrapper on Graham's night
stand.
"Boomerang" will not come back to
haunt you like some of Murphy's more re
cent movies. Murphy steadily supplies a
plethora of not-so-subtle jokes, sight gags
and some truly hilarious scenes.

Grim tale packs power
"Zentropa "
"Zentropa," a stylish new film from
Danish director Lars Von Trier, opens
with the mesmerizing chant of the narra
tor trying to draw the audience into a state
of deep hypnosis. As railroad tracks flash
across the screen with the magnetic blur of
a fast-moving train, the voice commands
"On the count of ten, you will be in Eu
ropa."
From that moment on, "Zentropa" en
snares the audience in the grim world of
post-war Europe, and rarely releases its grip
for the remainder of the film. Although Von
Trier's palette of film-school cinematogra
phy gimmicks does wear out its welcome,
the movie's exploration of the chaos in Ger
many after World War II holds a great deal
of power.
His imagery is both vivid and unsettling,
ranging from anti-Utopian scenes of
bombed-out rubble toayoungchild carrying

out an assassination. Von Trier's film will
leave viewers with a vague sense of unease
— not because the film is poorly made, or too
"artsy," but because of this potency.
In the aftermath of the declaration of
peace, Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) ar
rives in Germany to begin work as a sleeping
car conductor with his fussy uncle. His mo
tivation, he says, is to participate in the re
building process. A German-American, he
had refused to take sides throughout the
war, abstaining from fighting for either the
Americans or the Nazis.
On his training ride to Frankfurt, he en
counters Katharina Hartmann (Barbara
Sukowa), the daughter of the owner of Zen
tropa, the railroad lines that stretch across
all of Europe, and were used during the war
to transport Jews and other prisoners to the
concentration camps.
The plot thickens quickly. In an apparent
attempt at seduction, Katharina invites
Leopold to her family's home for dinner.
But instead of a meal, he is served up far too
many courses of intrigue.
An American colonel forces him to utilize
his position as a conductor to spy on Germans
in the post-war climate of suspicion. The
owner of the railway is pressured by the
colonel to prove that he had no Nazi affilia
tions during the war. And Katharina does se
duce Leopold, revealing along the way that
she is a former member of the Werewolves, a
post-war, pro-Nazi group of terrorists that
strikes out against the new American regime.
The web tightens around Leopold, and
as the movie progresses, all of his assump
tions are torn away. A powerful series of un
winding revelations have strong and in
escapable effects and will carry viewers in
exorably into the true drama and tragedy of
the end, where Leopold's ambivalence
about choosing sides makes him the only
true criminal.
But lest it seem too serious, Von Trier has
provided for ample comic relief. Leopold's
interactions with his overly correct,
pompous uncle create some truly hilarious
moments and help to relieve the somber
tone of the film.
Indeed,the ambiance of the film is dark
and portentous. Mostly shot in black-and
white, Von Trier's landscapes are cluttered
with a post-modern sense of destruction and
chaos. Hungry masses battle for the chance
to use the trains along grim, rubble-strewn
streets that seem to be perpetually cloaked
in the gloom of dusk. Barbed-wire fences
and fences gates abound.
Yet Von Trier's habit of splashing in
tense scenes with color, presumably to high
light the moment, is distracting and limp.
Instead of augmenting the scenes, it robs
them of their power by focusing attention on
the gimmick, rather than the scene.
Von Trier's other toys have the same di
verting effect, and by the end, his whole
range of tricks becomes wearisome.
Regardless, he has constructed an ad
mirable and gripping film, and the final,
overwhelming message is a powerful depic
tion of the futility of straddling the fence in
a time of such chaos.
