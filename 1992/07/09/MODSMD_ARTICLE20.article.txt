# High energy rocks Coffee House
## 
### Matthew Kanuck Staff writer 
Jeffrey Halford brings his high
energy rock 'n' roll back to Stan
ford tonight. The Coffee House
will host this original song writer
for an 8 p.m. performance.
Halford and his band will be
serving up "just good rock and
roll," he says. "No gimmicks. No
longhair."
The main course will be acoustic
guitar and intelligent lyrics, but
don't be misled.
"I am by no means a folk singer,"
Halford says of his style. He promis
es to be upbeat and a little bit
bluesy.
Halford will be far from back
ground music. He is intent on
sharing his enthusiasm and wants
the audience to have fun.
"To write good songs is chal
lenging," says Halford. Crafted
with experience and care, he de
scribes his music as "lyric orient
ed."
Since he finds people most com
pelling, they are the focus of his
songs. Besides songs about rela
tionships and the classic boy
meets girl theme, Halford's sets
will include more unique selec
tions, such as an ode to artist
Frida Kahlo.
Halford's love for the guitar
began as a teenager when he saw
Ray Charles and 8.8. King live.
Since then he has played until his
"fingers turned blue," an experi
ence no venerable guitarist has es
caped.
Although he does not imitate,
Halford's compositions have been
influenced by a diverse range of
musical styles, including gospel,
country and rock 'n' roll. He par
ticularly enjoys the music of Tom
Waits, John Hyatt and Los Lobos.
Bahaman guitarist Joseph Spence
has had a recent impact on him.
Incorporating a wide spectrum
of rhythms, Halford's brand of
rock and roll will be refreshingly
different, yet retain the essential
qualities that have brought rock
and roll its audience.
Simply, Halford has added
more ingredients to the recipe for
good rock 'n* roll.
Halford's last record was com

pared to the work of Van Morrison.
Although flattered, Halford does
not necessarily like the "limiting
comparison." Because he feels his
music is novel, he prefers not to
have it compared to other artists'.
Halford is now working on a
new album — one that will en
hance his acoustic rock 'n' roll by
tapping into ethnic sounds.
"It's like putting the frosting on
a cake," Halford says of his plans to

spice up the album with conga
drums, tom-toms and maracas.
Producing the new album is
Steve Savage, a producer for
Robert Cray and Bonnie Hays.
The album is also supported by
Brian Rohan, who has worked
with Elvis Costello and the Grate
ful Dead.
Hal ford can also be seen July '24
at the Starry Plough in Berkeley.
