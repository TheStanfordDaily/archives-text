Universal Soldier," a
futuristic action film
opening tomorrow, isn't
trying to hide whose films it
takes inspiration from.
Starring the "Muscles From
Brussels," Jean-Claude van
Damme and "Rocky" bad guy
Dolph Lundgren, "Universal
Soldier" is about two part-

human, part-machine "per
fect" soldiers. Apparently the
two were killed during the Viet
nam War, and the drama of the
picture arises when one of
them begins to remember his
past.
So we've got ultimate killing
machines of the future fighting
each other, as well as one char
acter feeling he's had a past life
taken from him and hidden.
Hmmm....
Just in case you don't quite
get it, the commercials point
out that Tri-Star Pictures, the
distributors of "Universal
Soldier," also brought you
"Total Recall" and "Termina
tor 2."
Van Damme's said on many
talk shows in the past that he
admires the way a certain ac
tion star with a thick accent
built himself into a movie pow
erhouse and he feels he can eas
ily do the same, only bigger and
better.
I guess he decided to use his
Arnold-envy in a positive way,
figuring if you can't beat 'em,
join 'em.
. . . Some guy in Sunnyvale
won $30 million earlier this
year and announced he would
use the money to help the
homeless.
This weekend, he makes
good on his word by presenting
a two-day, 21-band benefit
concert at the Santa Clara
County Fairgrounds. Among
the scheduled artists are Pete
Escovedo, the Tubes, and Mick
ey Thomas and Starship.
But apparently they couldn't
think of a name for this thing,
so I don't know what you'll ask

for when you call for tickets.
. . . The Stanford Theatre
begins a "Thin Man" retro
spective Friday as part of its
William Powell festival.
A quirky blend of crime
thriller and screwball comedy a
la "His Girl Friday," the Thin
Man series starred Powell and
Myrna Loy (and their dog Asta)
as the famous detective team of
Nick and Nora.
. . . Circuses are a major
theme this week. First there's
the Bay Area return of the
amazing Cirque du Soleil
next Wednesday.
Its new show, "Saltim
banco," promises no dancing
poodles, only dazzling lights
and costumes more akin to the
ater than circus variety. And
the daredevil acts will make you
completely forget those silly
"Circus of the Stars" routines
(Look! Is that Erik Estrada on a
tightrope?!?).
Cirque du Soleil plays in San
Francisco until Aug. 9, then
comes to San Jose on Aug. 27.
More traditional, but in a
twisted way, is the "Jim Rose
Circus Side Show," playing
next Wednesday and Thursday
at the DNA Lounge in San
Francisco.
Celebrating the "seedy
underbelly of the circus," the
Side Show bills itself as "the
only freakshow still touring the
United States."
There's Rose, who sticks
broken glass in his face; Mr.
Lifto, who lifts weights with
"sensitive" body parts; Paul
the Sword Swallower; Tim the
Human Pin Cushion; Dolly
the Doll Lady, who feeds slugs,
worms and crickets to the cast;
and perhaps the grossest of
them all, Matt the Tube, who
drinks beer, chocolate syrup
and catsup, pumps it into his
stomach and brings it back out
for audience members to
drink.

Chris Shuttlesworth, The
Weekly's entertainment editor,
never wants to meet Matt the
Tube. Tickets for the Side
Show, Cirque du Soleil and the
21-band thing are available at
762-BASS.
