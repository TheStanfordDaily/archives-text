# Dynamic duo brings lush vocals, cool piano to Jazz Workshop
## 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
Independence Day festivities aren't the
only forms of entertainment worth closing
out with a pyrotechnic bang.
The 1992 Stanford Jazz Workshop Sum
mer Jazz Concert Series, for instance, is
sure to send more than a few audiences
rocketing into the stratosphere in an am
bling manner specific only to jazz.
The Workshop launched its assault on
the Bay Area last Friday night, showcasing
talented vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson
and his Quartet. This week the attack con
tinues with the unobtrusive elegance of the
Bobbe Norris/Larry Dunlap Quartet on Fri
day night and the "new world funk" of
U.n.i. (pronounced "you and I") on Satur
day.
The pair of events promises to offer jazz
junkies and curious cats alike a unique op
portunity to experience both the innovation

and urbanity of a truly American art form.
Practically everybody who's anybody
among local and national entertainment
writers have literally gushed about the dy
namism of Marin-born Bobbe Norris' jazz
vocals. A San Francisco Examiner music
critic declared that the musician is endowed
with "the best voice and singing style of any
Bay Area vocalist."
Critic Rex Reed has, on a number of oc
casions, christened Norris a virtuoso of her
craft, assuring readers that "her low, lush
vibrato is warmer than an open hearth on a
winter night."
But unless you're deep into the local jazz
scene, you've probably never heard of this
jazz legend.
Beginning her singing career back in the
late '50s, Norris briefly enjoyed the spot
light generally reserved for more main
stream pop artists like Barbra Streisand
and Diana Ross.
Unfortunately, an attempted crossover

from jazz to pop — the Columbia Record
recording "The Beginning" — left her
bankrupt, disoriented, and back in Califor
nia during the early '70s.
But with the support and encouragement
of husband/pianist Larry Dunlap, Norris
made a move to revive her career during the
early '80s, this time resolving to keep true to
herself and her first love — jazz.
Palo Alto Records released the vocalist's
second album, "Hoisted Sails," to pleasant
reviews. Since then, Norris' musicianship
has consistently won her praise from local
and national critics.
Yet the revival of her career would not have
been possible without the support, arrange
ments and accompaniments of husband Dun
lap, who is a fine pianist in his own right.
Primarily known for his collaborations
with the Pointer Sisters and Cleo Laine, the
Oregon-bred composer's arrangements of
true-tested standard and Brazilian jazz
tunes have also left their mark on the Bay

Area jazz scene.
His work has paved the way for the con
tinued success of Norris, whose agile inter
pretations of bebop, swing and everything
in between clearly speak for themselves.
On Saturday night, U.n.i will perform a
definition of jazz that combines bop, rock,
fusion, funk, African and Caribbean.
This septet, led by Bay Area saxophonist
Norbert Satchel, is sure to impress, if for no
other reason than the group's exotic mix
ture of soprano sax, bassoon, Akai
E.W.l.(electric wind instrument) synthesiz
er, flutes and percussion.
Back in December of'9l, U.n.i. madeabig
splash at Yoshi's in Berkeley, bringing the
ensemble its first mqjor notice. There's no
reason why the group shouldn't make the
same impression at Campbell Recital Hall.
