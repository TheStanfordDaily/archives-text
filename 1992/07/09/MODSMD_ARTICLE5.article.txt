If we are to believe current
media coverage of the recent
elections in Israel, the decisive
victory of the Labor party in the
Israeli elections is an overwhelm
ing vote for peace on the part of
the people of Israel. With the
Labor party in power, the possibil
ity of a lasting peace has increased
a hundredfold.
But has it?
In the afterglow of the Madrid
peace talks, the U.S. press had
proclaimed much the same news
â€” that the willingness of the vari
ous parties to congregate at the
same table signalled a new era in
Middle Eastern politics, where
peace was a serious prospect.
Yitzhak Shamir utilized the oc
casion to its fullest to harp on the
sincere desire on the part of his
government to achieve a compre
hensive peace, and on the opportu
nities for peace lost by "the Arabs"
due to their innate intransigence.
Even as he made these solemn
pronouncements, his government
continued to bomb innocent civil
ians in Southern Lebanon, and, as
was pointed out by several Pales
tinian delegates at the peace talks,
even more housing starts were
made in the West Bank.
Despite the conciliatory steps
taken by the Palestinian Libera
tion Organization to satisfy the
list of prerequisites that Israel
has set forth before a meeting
with that organization can even
take place, the PLO's "rejection
ism" is still seen as legitimate
grounds for the Israeli govern
ment to refuse to deal directly
with the government of the Pales
tinian people.
Israel's refusal to meet with the
PLO stems not from any Arab in
transigence.
If this were the case, the
Shamir government would have
agreed to meet with the leadership
of the PLO after the 19th Pales
tine National Council meeting, at
which the PLO rejected terrorism,
embraced UN Resolution 242 and
recognized the existence of the
State of Israel, thereby formally
fulfilling all the requirements set
forth by Israel.
The real basis for Israel's re
fusal to meet with the PLO is their
refusal to accept the right of the
Palestinian people to self-determi
nation as guaranteed by interna
tional law.
Shamir knew that to meet with
the PLO would have been to legit
imate the Palestinian claim to
self-determination, and therefore
to a Palestinian state.
And for the same reason,
Shamir could not bring himself to
meet with a separate Palestinian
delegation at the peace talks,
which instead had to form part of
a joint Palestinian-Jordanian con
federation.
In the end it was Shamir him
self who unmasked his true de
signs in an interview with the Is
raeli newspaper Maariv.
Shamir's admission to plans to
stall peace talks for a decade while
implementing massive settlement
of Jewish colonists in the West
Bank, and thereby finally making
a peace settlement impossible,
was undeniable proof of what had
been happening for the duration
of the peace talks under his gov
ernment.
To the Arab nations involved in
the peace talks, this had been
patently obvious, and Shamir's
failure in the Israeli elections was
greeted with no small sigh of re
lief.
But this sense of relief may be
shortlived.
The attraction of Mr. Rabin for
the Israeli people has not been his
more conciliatory position to
wards the Palestinian people.

Rather it has been his hard-line
approach in dealing with the In
tifada.
When the Palestinians of the
West Bank and Gaza began to ex
ercise their right to civil disobedi
ence, Rabin's solution was a policy
of "beatings," one that included a
"breaking bones" policy whereby
it became legal for Israeli military
authorities in the Occupied Terri
tories to break the bones of any
Palestinian caught throwing a
stone, a fact that was used as the
selling point of Rabin to the voting
public in Israel.
So now that Rabin is in power,
does this one-time member of the
Likud party represent an im
provement on the chances of a just
and lasting peace being the final
outcome of the peace talks?
Rabin has made it clear that he
is unwilling to consider a coalition
with any of the Arab parties with
in Israel, because of their Pales
tinian nationalist stance.
In order to balance the so called
dovishness of the Meretz party,
who are guaranteed to be in any
Labor-led coalition, Rabin instead
will go to one of the religious par
ties, who have all stated that terri
torial compromise is out of the
question.
Rabin appears keen on Pales
tinian "autonomy," a vague term
that according to Shamir meant
an agreement to allow Palestini
ans to empty their own garbage
cans, but may under Rabin, ex
tend as far as local elections in the
Occupied Territories.
On the other hand, Rabin has
reaffirmed that any territorial
concession will not include East
Jerusalem, nor the Jordan Val
ley, nor any other settlement that
the government deems "politi
cal," and has said that the gov
ernment will continue to expand
the aforementioned political set
tlements.
This will never be acceptable to
the Arab mind as a peace that is in
anyway just or lasting. To be
asked to sacrifice yet more of the
remaining 20 percent of their
country left to them may be more
than the Palestinian people can
bear.
In the end, the cards have fallen
in Mr. Rabin's favor.
As Hanan Ashrawi noted, the
Western media has portrayed
Rabin as the flexible negotiator
who can bring peace, and in the
face of that, the Palestinians will
be expected once more to compro
mise, or face more accusations of
intransigence and failure to seize
the opportunity to make peace.
Thus to the Palestinians and
the Arabs at large, Rabin's elec
tion may make the possibility of a
resolution to the conflict that does
justice to the Palestinian claim to
self-determination equally dis
tant.
