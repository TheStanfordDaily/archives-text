## A 						summertime civics lesson 
### 
POLITICAL CONVENTIONS, the convention
al wisdom now dictates, are passe. Elephantine
in scale but irrelevant as a forum for substan
tive debate or decision-making, critics say the con
ventions are just a spectacle, the equivalent of politi
cal junk food.
The three major networks, for example, are plan
ning sparse coverage this year — no more than an
hour during the prime time in any of the convention's
four nights. The Democratic Convention begins next
week, and network bosses are vowing that they won't
be force-fed by its organizers, who have the entire af
fair planned down to the minute.
But critics of the conventions neglect one simple
fact: they are watched. In an age when a television
hungry electorate is turning away from the print
media, voters glean the vast majority of their infor
mation — and shape their impressions about political
campaigns — from the tube.
By scaling back coverage so drastically, the net
works do a disservice to the American people.
The conventions are, in essence, a civic moment —
a brief interlude of political activity during summers
of deadening heat, car chase movies and lazy trips to
the beach. While it is true that they are staged,
canned and packaged for the public, the conventions
do spark interest in the candidates and begin to focus
the debate.
At least they did when the networks covered them
fully. Now, as the networks turn aWay, their future
as an educational device is not so certain. Without
coverage that reaches the saturation point, the con

ventions lose their luster, and Joe Six-Pac begins to
channel surf.
True, CNN and C-SPAN will still carry the con
ventions in-depth, but those stations are not accessi
ble to many Americans — ironically, mainly the poor
and minorities, who feel most disenfranchised and
shut out of the process.
Reducing coverage will only increase their disen
franchisement, closing one of the avenues they could
have previously used to familiarize themselves with
the candidates.
What viewers won't see will be much of the stuff
that lends the summer political season its color — the
roll call vote, for instance, in which delegates tout
their home states as they cast their ballots.
And the networks may not even cover New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo's nominating speech live this
year — a strange turnabout, considering that
Cuomo propelled himself into national political at
tention with his dynamic address at the 1984 Demo
cratic Convention.
As another example, speeches by Gov. Ann
Richards of Texas and former Rep. Barbara Jordan of
Texas — two orators who have ignited the convention
before with their strident rhetoric — may only be
seen in excerpts.
Something will be missing from the American po
litical scene this summer. The conventions, despite
their faults, are a valuable part of the process, and
should be covered in their entirety. They should not
be made into a one-hour nightly highlight film. Save
that for ESPN.
