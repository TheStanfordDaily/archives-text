Best method for
a male stranger:
Don't bother her
Peter Huyck and Alex Grego
ry's petty, sarcastic response to
Sharon Beaulaurier's call for un
derstanding highlights the unfor
tunate fact that some men are
still unable to listen to women
with open minds. Beaulaurier at
tempted to convey, in clear and
reasonable tones, that a male
stranger can be threatening in ap
proaching a woman simply be
cause she is alone.
In their letter to The Daily,
neither Peter Huyck nor Alex
Gregory seem capable of compre
hending that a woman traveling
alone might be distrustful and de
fensive toward unrequested at
tention. Neither Huyck nor Gre
gory comprehend Beaulaurier's
point that when a woman is
alone, men should not give them
selves an open invitation to in
vade her privacy and peace of
mind.
Beaulaurier spoke concerning
being alone in the hills. My own
experience is with New York City,
but her points apply equally there.

My female friends know that trav
eling alone on the subways is
never a pleasant experience. My
friends have quite oflen found
that Gregory and Huyck 's
"friendly, cordial" strangers have
groping hands and carry knives,
along with their smiles and hellos.
In the woods or in the cities,
people who appear to be "friendly
and cordial" can be as dangerous
as sullen, unpleasant people,
leaving alone people who want to
be by themselves can sometimes
be the friendliest, least hostile
thing to do. It is ludicrous to de
mand that women leave them
selves vulnerable to attack, just
because Gregory and Huyck be
lieve that being cautious and ask
ing men to be more considerate is
"paranoid and unrealistic."
I do not intend to imply that
Gregory and Huyck's own inten
tions are anything less than per
fectly honorable. Other men,
however, still consider women as
targets for unwanted attention,
and to many men, "no" still
means yes.' It is impossible for a
person without telepathic abili
ties to clearly know a stranger's
intentions. Outside of a clearly so
cial situation, when a woman is
not explicitly asking to be noticed,
the best way for a male stranger
to signal his good intentions to-

ward her is to leave her alone.
In this society, women and
men are not perceived equally. I,
as a man, enjoy a great deal of
freedom in being able to travel
alone, night or day, without fear.
Because of my gender, I am well
shielded against sexual harass
ment and assault. It is not fair
that men should turn a woman's
gender into a liability.
No man would want to feel vul
nerable because of his sex; in re
turn men should respect a
woman's personal space and her
desire for privacy.
