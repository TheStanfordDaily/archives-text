Cowell to cut
pediatric services
Beginning Aug. 1, graduate stu
dents will no longer be able to
bring their children to Cowell Stu
dent Health Center to receive
medical attention.
Cowell administrators decided
last Thursday to discontinue the
center's pediatric services. But a
plan to relocate affordable pedi
atric care to facilities on Welch
Road is currently in the works, ac
cording to John Dorman, Cowell's
director of public relations.
Parents expressed disappoint
ment and anger at the plans to
close Cowell's pediatric services.
"I was in disbelief," said Escondi
do Village resident Carolina
Montes, who has been taking her
three-year-old son to Cowell since
last year.
The Medical School's Faculty
Practice Program (FPP), which
currently provides pediatric ser
vices at Cowell, announced earlier
last week that it would reduce its
hours next year to only about 10
per week because there have not
been enough patients to sustain
the program financially.
Instead of accepting the cut
back in pediatric hours, which
would cripple Cowell's ability to
provide adequate care on demand
for its younger patients, Cowell
administrators opted to dissolve
its pediatric services completely.
"It is not in the best interests of
the student family population for
us to try to provide quality pedi
atric services on such a limited
basis," Dorman wrote in a draft of
a letter which will be sent to par
ents of all pediatric patients at
Cowell.
In previous years, physicians
from the Palo Alto Medical Clinic
provided pediatric care at Cowell.
But when the Medical School took
over last fall, many parents of
Cowell pediatric patients followed
their children's physicians back to
the Palo Alto clinic, decreasing the
number of patients dramatically.
Parents learned about Cowell's
possible termination of its pedi
atric services in mid-June and
were advised to find alternative
pediatric care for their children for
the next school year, Montes said.
In response, more than 90 par
ents sent petitions and letters to
Cowell in late June, urging its ad
ministrators to maintain its pedi
atric services.
Parents are now meeting with
each other to discuss the Cowell
plans. Many said they are also
planning to hold a "town meeting"
in the next few days to voice their
concerns to physicians and Cowell
administrators.
"Our main objective is to keep it
open," said Teresa Clement,
mother of a ten-month old son.
She said she is waiting for fur
ther information about the advan
tages of the Welch Road clinic,
compared to other area clinics be
fore she decides to transfer her
son's pediatric care there.
Since January, FPP had been
looking for more efficient alterna
tives for the student families, said
its Medical director, Peter Grego
ry.
While an average pediatrician
receives about 3,500-4,500 visits
per year, Cowell's pediatric service
receives about 800-900, according
to Gregory.
"We've known all year that we
needed to see more patients," said
pediatric nurse Mitzi Van Sant,
adding that a plan to attract more
graduate students to Cowell has
been "put on hold" by the recent
developments.
The Welch Road pediatric
group, which already serves many
student, families, is likely to up
grade current pediatric care by
providing more comprehensive
care seven days a week, Gregory
said. And patients will be able to
choose their physician from six
full-time board-certified pediatri
cians. Cowell currently offers one

half-time family practice physi
cian.
Gregory added that the costs
for parents will probably not differ
dramatically from the Cowell ser
vices, although Cowell's low im
munization fees will not be main
tained at the new location.
Cowell's pediatric care provides
substantial savings for low-in
come graduate students. For ex
ample, it offers a 15 percent dis
count over Stanford Clinic prices,
which are similar to those of other
local clinics, Van Sant said.
Also, because vaccines are pro
vided by the county, Cowell only
charges an administration fee of
$5.88 for each shot. Other clinics
charge between $35 and $45 each,
according to Van Sant.
And many graduate students
said they are worried that the
Welch Road location, if approved,
may prove to be more inconve
nient for them. While there is a
Marguerite shuttle that goes from
Escondido Village to Welch Road,
Cowell is within walking distance,
Montes said.
"It's so convenient for us,"
Clement said, adding that "it's
nice to know that you can walk
there — especially if you have a
sick baby."
Van Sant also said she was con
cerned about the attention many
international students would re
ceive "if they're set out into the
community where offices are a lot
bigger."
"It takes a lot of time with the
students in terms of bridging that
language barrier," she said,
adding that about half of Cowell's
pediatric patients are internation
al student families.
Montes expressed frustration
that many decisions were made
about Cowell pediatrics without
consulting the parents. "We're on
the tail-end" of the process, she
said. She added that because many
students are away during the sum
mer, there is a "smaller base" of
affected parents to oppose the
changes.
Gregory said FPP has been
working with Cowell so far, and
has not contacted the parents. But
they "would be delighted to talk
with parents," he said. "We really
do have the students' best inter
ests at heart."

Betas can't fill
house, lose it
More than 25 men who had
planned to live in the Beta Theta
Pi fraternity next year were forced
to change their plans late last
month when the University told
them that the fraternity will lose
its house for at least the next year

because members failed to attract
enough people to fill it.
The fraternity will become a co
ed, University-operated house
next year, open to students on the
waiting list. The 26 men slated to
live in the 38-bed house will be
guaranteed housing through the
waiting list, officials said.
"The University needs to re
ceive that revenue," said Janyce
Prothro, assistant director of the
Row. "Whether the University
was in a budget crunch or not, the
concern is we've got a house left
(partially) empty."
Despite the late notice, losing
the house "wasn't completely out
of the blue," said Beta President
Kurt Hurtado from his home in
Texas. He said members and new
pledges had realized before Rush
that the fraternity might have
trouble filling the house.
Although the Betas had a
strong Rush this year — attract
ing nine new pledges, after attract
ing only one last year — the hous
ing glut on campus prevented the
fraternity from recruiting enough
boarders to fill the remainder of
the house, Hurtado said. And a
number of upperclassmen have
left the fraternity early, creating a
"huge gap" in its membership, he
said.
Hurtado said fraternity mem
bers are "optimistic" that they will
be able to restructure the fraterni
ty during the next year and re
claim the house. Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Heather Dunn said she
plans to help reorganize the
"loosely structured" Betas next
year, and added that they "have a
really good chance" to return to
the house if the restructuring ef
fort is successful.
The fraternity has an agree
ment with the University that it
can reclaim the house when it re
cruits enough members to fill the
house to about three-quarters of
its capacity, Hurtado said.
The first step in the reorganiza
tion, he said, will be to reaffiliate
with the national chapter of Beta
Theta Pi, which dropped the Stan
ford fraternity two years ago. Hur
tado said he has already met with
national Beta representatives, and
added that they are receptive to
the idea of reaffiliating.
The fraternity must also build a
better structure by appointing
more officers to run different
functions, Hurtado said. The
house "was run basically like a
self-op the last few years, like any
other Row house," he said. "There
were not enough people to do the
jobs that fraternities require. Now
we have people interested in doing
those jobs."
Hurtado said the Betas also plan
more frequent activities during the
next year. "We're hoping to use this

as a chance to show that we're not
just a group of guys who live togeth
er, but rather a fraternity that can
survive with or without a house,"
he said. This year's pledge class, he
added, "still seems excited."
The decision to remove the
Betas from their house was made
June 12, when a group of "four or
five officers" met with Prothro
and told her they would not be able
to fill the house, Prothro said. The
Office of Residential Education,
she said, "felt there was no other
option" but to convert the frater
nity into a University-operated
house.
In letters dated June 28, Beta
members were sent Draw books
and "invited to enter the waiting
list," Prothro said.

Plan to renovate
housing released
Modular furniture, structural
repairs, computer upgrades and
cosmetic repairs are all part of the
10-year "Capital Improvements
Plan" to be implemented in the
next decade.
The plan, produced through a
cooperative effort between Resi
dential Education and Housing
and Food Services, calls for reno
vations in all student housing to
occur between 1992 and 2002,
with a projected cost of approxi
mately $80 million.
Members of a Board of Trustees
committee were concerned that as
the University begins its four-year
guaranteed housing pledge, some
students and administrators still
will complain about the equity of
the various campus housing.
"When you build a Kimball and
a Manzanita across the street, you
know you have to get into Wilbur
and do some renovations," said
Keith Guy, director of Housing
and Food Services.
Kiyon Chung, a senior who
spent two years in Soto House, ex
pressed a similar concern. "It's a
shame there's such a disparity of
housing when everyone pays
about the same amount," she said.
Housing and Food Services con
tracted Genesis Research, Inc.
earlier this year to administer a
market survey of student concerns
and complaints. Some of the im
provements students said they
wanted were greater computer ac
cess, more living space, modular
furniture, better sound proofing
and better lighting.
Housing and Food Services also
commissioned Intelligent Systems
and Engineering Services to make
structural recommendations, which
included earthquake safety in Lagu
nita Court, asbestos removal and
containment in Escondido Village

and better disability access.
The 10-year plan will upgrade
residences by selecting one large
dorm, several Row houses and
100-150 apartments each year to
renovate.
For example, 1992-1993 reno
vations will occur in Wilbur, Beta,
Storey, 553 Mayfleld, Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk and 150 Escondido Vil
lage apartments, and will include
structural repairs, furniture re
placement, roof repair, food ser
vice renovations and upgrades in
lighting and computer clusters.
Also, Escondido Village renova
tions will include removal and con
tainment of asbestos-containing
materials in the floor and ceilings
as well as more modern furniture
and appliances.
Plans for computer renovations
were based on input by resident
computer coordinators, and in
clude new clusters in Escondido
Village and the Row.
Also, as more students pur
chase personal computers of their
own, clusters may become smaller,
providing higher-end machines
and meeting more specific com
puting needs. In-room SUNet con
nections are also a goal, but the
cost and date of these renovations
are still uncertain.
The plan proposes to examine
the possibility of making all resi
dences accessible to people with
disabilities. Unfortunately, this
means only first-floor ramp ac
cess; elevators and lifts are not in
cluded in the current plan.
Some of the funding for the pro
ject will come from gifts and cost
cutting measures within Housing
and Food Services, but the majori
ty will come from loans to be re
paid in the next seven to 25 years.
8
However, the amount and type
of student input is still unclear,
and it is unlikely that students will
have a say in the renova
tions. Instead, they may help de
cide things such as paint color.
Although several students cited
"small dorm atmosphere" and lin
ear hallways as good things about
Wilbur, they also felt that renova
tions were long overdue.
"At this point, any change in
the Wilbur complex would be a
renovation," said Mike Duh, a for
mer Trancos resident.

Skaters stay away,
wary of fines
The threat of a $100 fine seems
to have deterred most skateboard
ers from defying a county ruling
that prohibits skateboarding in
the central academic campus, po
lice say.
Since the April 7 Santa Clara
County ruling, the number of
complaints police have received
about skateboarders has fallen
dramatically, said Stanford Police
Capt. Marvin Moore.
Although he said limited class
es and visitors during the summer
may be a factor, he believes the or
dinance is primarily responsible
for the decline in complaints.
The skateboarders disrupted
classes, damaged property and en
dangered pedestrians, said Andy
Doty, Stanford's director of com
munity relations.
According to Moore, until the
police finish posting signs stating
the restriction, officers respond
ing to complaints will give skate
boarders one warning. Violators'
names are added to a data base
now listing 200 to 300 names. Re
peat offenders are cited and sub
ject to the $ 100 fine.
Only a handful of skateboard
ers have actually been cited,
Moore said, but he added that offi
cers will not hesitate to enforce the
law if necessary.
Although sympathetic to stu
dents using skateboards only for
transportation, Moore said the de
partment "has no mechanism for

exceptions" and therefore must
take a "consistent stance" in light
of the ordinance.
The threat of fines has discour
aged most, but some skateboarders
said the threat has increased the
thrill of skateboarding on campus.
A few have chosen to defy the
law. One said, "All the cops want
you to do is kiss their butts for a
few minutes and they'll let you
go." This high school student and
his peers say they can always "just
run away." To maintain anonymi
ty, the skateboarders declined to
give their names.
Stanford's stretches of con
crete, broad steps and benches for
merly attracted skateboarders
from all over the Bay Area. A
group performing stunts near the
Post Office explained that Stan
ford offers a diverse selection of
terrain in a compact area. The re
maining skateboarders claim only
locals now venture into the terri
tory.
Although Palo Alto has con
structed d complex for skateboard
ers, it is not well liked. Because the
complex requires protective gear
and closes at 5 p.m., one skater
said the situation is "like giving us
something and then taking half of
it back."
Another said most skaters
would rather have the park open
from 5 to 9 p.m. rather than 9 to 5
p.m.
A group practicing at History
Corner said their options are limit
ed. They claim local skateboarders
must travel to San Francisco,
Berkeley or San Jose to find chal
lenging concrete formations or
risk being caught at Stanford.
The ordinance was sought by
the Stanford Police and the Office
of Public Affairs in response to
complaints from the faculty, staff
and public. Doty said skateboard
ers ignore requests or respond
with a rude attitude and vulgar
tongue.
The ordinance's intention,
Doty said, was to give leverage to
University authorities in eliminat
ing the problem. The desire was to
restore the academic environment
and promote safety.

Stanford applies
for housing project
Stanford and Sand Hill Senior
Partners, a group of local in
vestors, submitted an application
Thursday to the city of Palo Alto
for a long-awaited housing project
on West Campus.
The project consists of 1,210
units to be built on University
owned land between Sand Hill
Road and San Francisquito
Creek.
According to Andrew Doty, di
rector of community relations at
Stanford, the application process
is only the first step in the pro
ject's planning, which is expected
to take about two to three more
years, if all goes as scheduled.
Doty said the project expects to
get a "positive response" from the
Palo Alto City Council, which
must approve the project before
construction can begin.
Stanford's plans for building
housing on the vacant lot have

failed once already. In 1983, Stan
ford aborted a plan to construct
1,100 units when the city of Palo
Alto approved the plan, but im
posed conditions on areas outside
its jursidiction that Stanford felt
were "unfair," Doty said.
But in the past few years, Doty
said, Stanford "has been under
pressure. . .from both the city and
the county to build more housing,"
so the city is unlikely to impose re
strictions this time.
But he said the project expects
substantial resistance from Menlo
Park residents who may oppose
the construction of a large-scale
housing project next to their
homes. However, a 16-acre archae
ological preserve along San Fran
cisquito Creek that will separate
the project from the residents
should placate the ; r concerns,
Doty said.
Included in the building plan
are 750 University-owned housing
units, most of which will be rented
to faculty and staff. Remaining
University-owned units will be
rented by a "tiered priority system
to others working on Stanford
land, such as those working at the
shopping center," Doty said.
These units, which have been in
the planning stage for three to
four years, will cost the University
more than $160 million, according
to Doty. The cost will eventually
be offset by rental revenue, which
will be the sole source of the pro
ject's income, Doty said.
Sand Hill Senior Partners will
build an adjacent retirement com

munity consisting of 460 condo
minium units. The group will
lease University land formerly oc
cupied by the Childrens' Hospital.
The Sand Hill Senior Partners
project will also include an Age
Center for gerontology and educa
tion to be utilized by researchers
at Stanford.
"Surveys in the Sociology De
partment and in the School of
Medicine have shown much inter
est in having a group of seniors
close by for study and interview
ing," Doty said.
When planning is complete,
construction of the units is expect
ed to last one year, according to
Doty.

Blomquist faces
arraignment today
Daniel Blomquist, an assistant
manager in the Controller's Of
fice, will face two charges of child
abuse today when he is arraigned
for subjecting his son to unjustifi
able pain and suffering and endan
gering the boy's life.
Blomquist, who was arrested
July 1, is held on $150,000 bail at
the Santa Clara County Jail.
Blomquist's wife, Ethel
Blomquist, was arrested July 2 in
conjunction with the incident. She
is free on $5,000 bond and awaits
arraignment July 20.
Cynthia Sevely, the prosecut
ing attorney for Santa Clara Coun
ty, called it a "slam dunk case."

With Daniel Blomquist's confes
sion and the condition of the vic
tim on file, Sevely said she does not
foresee any difficulty in prosecut
ing the defendants. Although a
plea of "not guilty" is expected at
the arraignment, she anticipates a
plea bargain before the case would
go to trial.
If convicted, Daniel Blomquist
could serve a nine-year prison
term. The maximum sentence
Ethel Blomquist could serve is six
years.
Religious beliefs motivated
Blomquist to beat his son, who
was "rebellious," Blomquist told
Campbell police. Each evening,
Steven, 10, was spanked severely
with a 14-inch wooden spoon, "be
cause that's what the Bible says to
do," Blomquist told police.
Steven, now listed in fair condi
tion at the Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital, has been
treated for malnutrition, kidney
failure, dehydration and jaundice
and is expected to recover.
Steven received daily food ra
tions of unprocessed milk, three
eggs and food supplements. He
was near death when paramedics
responded to a call made by one of
the Blomquists' other three chil
dren, ages 4, 15 and 18.
The Blomquists' 15-year-old
daughter and 4-year-old son are in
custody of the state pending fur
ther developments. The children
could be placed in foster care or re
turned to their parents if they are
released.

Auto burglary
attempt thwarted
Stanford Police arrested Jorge
Nunez Toledo of San Jose in con
nection with an attempted auto
burglary in the Alumni House
parking lot Tuesday afternoon.
Toledo was first spotted in the
Lagunita Court parking lot at
12:25 p.m. by Stanford employee
Luis Chavez, who was eating his
lunch outside near the lot, said
Sgt. Del Bandy.
Toledo was examining the in
side of each car in the parking lot
and was attempting to break into a
car with a "slim jim," a thin metal
bar usually used by tow truck dri
vers to force open car doors, Bandy
said. Toledo was also wearing
gloves at the time, he added.
After calling police, Chavez ap
proached Toledo and asked him to
show some identification. Toledo
pulled out his car registration
form, showed it to Chavez and then
drove off, according to Bandy.
Chavez identified the suspect for
police in the Alumni House parking
lot at 12:49 p.m., Bandy said.
Toledo was booked into North
County Jail and charged with at
tempted burglary. Bail was set at
$5,000. Bandy said he may also be
charged with possession of bur
glary tools.
Over the last three months,
Stanford Police have observed a
consistent rate of auto burglaries,
Bandy said.

Hurtado said the Betas also plan
more frequent activities during the
next year. "We're hoping to use this

as a chance to show that we're not

he said. This year's pledge class, he
added, "still seems excited."
The decision to remove the
Betas from their house was made
June 12, when a group of "four or

members were sent Draw books

Plan to renovate
housing released
Modular furniture, structural
repairs, computer upgrades and
cosmetic repairs are all part of the
10-year "Capital Improvements
Plan" to be implemented in the
next decade.
The plan, produced through a
cooperative effort between Resi
dential Education and Housing
and Food Services, calls for reno
vations in all student housing to
occur between 1992 and 2002,
with a projected cost of approxi
mately $80 million.
Members of a Board of Trustees
committee were concerned that as
the University begins its four-year
guaranteed housing pledge, some
students and administrators still
will complain about the equity of
the various campus housing.
"When you build a Kimball and
a Manzanita across the street, you
know you have to get into Wilbur
and do some renovations," said
Keith Guy, director of Housing
and Food Services.
Kiyon Chung, a senior who
spent two years in Soto House, ex
pressed a similar concern. "It's a
shame there's such a disparity of
housing when everyone pays
about the same amount," she said.
Housing and Food Services con
tracted Genesis Research, Inc.
earlier this year to administer a
market survey of student concerns
and complaints. Some of the im
provements students said they
wanted were greater computer ac
cess, more living space, modular
furniture, better sound proofing
and better lighting.
Housing and Food Services also
commissioned Intelligent Systems
and Engineering Services to make
structural recommendations, which
included earthquake safety in Lagu
nita Court, asbestos removal and
containment in Escondido Village

and better disability access.
The 10-year plan will upgrade
residences by selecting one large
dorm, several Row houses and
100-150 apartments each year to
renovate.
For example, 1992-1993 reno
vations will occur in Wilbur, Beta,
Storey, 553 Mayfleld, Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk and 150 Escondido Vil
lage apartments, and will include
structural repairs, furniture re
placement, roof repair, food ser
vice renovations and upgrades in
lighting and computer clusters.
Also, Escondido Village renova
tions will include removal and con
tainment of asbestos-containing
materials in the floor and ceilings
as well as more modern furniture
and appliances.
Plans for computer renovations
were based on input by resident
computer coordinators, and in
clude new clusters in Escondido
Village and the Row.
Also, as more students pur
chase personal computers of their
own, clusters may become smaller,
providing higher-end machines
and meeting more specific com
puting needs. In-room SUNet con
nections are also a goal, but the
cost and date of these renovations
are still uncertain.
The plan proposes to examine
the possibility of making all resi
dences accessible to people with
disabilities. Unfortunately, this
means only first-floor ramp ac
cess; elevators and lifts are not in
cluded in the current plan.
Some of the funding for the pro
ject will come from gifts and cost
cutting measures within Housing
and Food Services, but the majori
ty will come from loans to be re
paid in the next seven to 25 years.

However, the amount and type
of student input is still unclear,
and it is unlikely that students will
have a say in the renova
tions. Instead, they may help de
cide things such as paint color.
Although several students cited
"small dorm atmosphere" and lin
ear hallways as good things about
Wilbur, they also felt that renova
tions were long overdue.
"At this point, any change in
the Wilbur complex would be a
renovation," said Mike Duh, a for

Skaters stay away,
wary of fines
The threat of a $100 fine seems
to have deterred most skateboard

that prohibits skateboarding in
the central academic campus, po

The ordinance's intention,
Doty said, was to give leverage to
University authorities in eliminat

Stanford applies
for housing project
Stanford and Sand Hill Senior
Partners, a group of local in
vestors, submitted an application
Thursday to the city of Palo Alto
for a long-awaited housing project
on West Campus.
The project consists of 1,210
units to be built on University
owned land between Sand Hill
Road and San Francisquito
Creek.
According to Andrew Doty, di
rector of community relations at
Stanford, the application process
is only the first step in the pro
ject's planning, which is expected
to take about two to three more
years, if all goes as scheduled.
Doty said the project expects to
get a "positive response" from the
Palo Alto City Council, which
must approve the project before
construction can begin.
Stanford's plans for building
housing on the vacant lot have

failed once already. In 1983, Stan
ford aborted a plan to construct
1,100 units when the city of Palo
Alto approved the plan, but im
posed conditions on areas outside
its jursidiction that Stanford felt
were "unfair," Doty said.
But in the past few years, Doty
said, Stanford "has been under
pressure. . .from both the city and
the county to build more housing,"
so the city is unlikely to impose re
strictions this time.
But he said the project expects
substantial resistance from Menlo
Park residents who may oppose
the construction of a large-scale
housing project next to their
homes. However, a 16-acre archae
ological preserve along San Fran
cisquito Creek that will separate
the project from the residents
should placate the ; r concerns,
Doty said.
Included in the building plan
are 750 University-owned housing
units, most of which will be rented
to faculty and staff. Remaining
University-owned units will be
rented by a "tiered priority system
to others working on Stanford
land, such as those working at the
shopping center," Doty said.
These units, which have been in
the planning stage for three to
four years, will cost the University
more than $160 million, according
to Doty. The cost will eventually
be offset by rental revenue, which
will be the sole source of the pro
ject's income, Doty said.
Sand Hill Senior Partners will
build an adjacent retirement com

munity consisting of 460 condo
minium units. The group will
lease University land formerly oc
cupied by the Childrens' Hospital.
The Sand Hill Senior Partners
project will also include an Age
Center for gerontology and educa
tion to be utilized by researchers
at Stanford.
"Surveys in the Sociology De
partment and in the School of
Medicine have shown much inter
est in having a group of seniors
close by for study and interview
ing," Doty said.
When planning is complete,
construction of the units is expect
ed to last one year, according to
Doty.

Blomquist faces
arraignment today
Daniel Blomquist, an assistant
manager in the Controller's Of
fice, will face two charges of child
abuse today when he is arraigned
for subjecting his son to unjustifi
able pain and suffering and endan
gering the boy's life.
Blomquist, who was arrested
July 1, is held on $150,000 bail at
the Santa Clara County Jail.
Blomquist's wife, Ethel
Blomquist, was arrested July 2 in
conjunction with the incident. She
is free on $5,000 bond and awaits
arraignment July 20.
Cynthia Sevely, the prosecut
ing attorney for Santa Clara Coun
ty, called it a "slam dunk case."

With Daniel Blomquist's confes
sion and the condition of the vic
tim on file, Sevely said she does not
foresee any difficulty in prosecut
ing the defendants. Although a
plea of "not guilty" is expected at
the arraignment, she anticipates a
plea bargain before the case would
go to trial.
If convicted, Daniel Blomquist
could serve a nine-year prison
term. The maximum sentence
Ethel Blomquist could serve is six
years.
Religious beliefs motivated
Blomquist to beat his son, who
was "rebellious," Blomquist told
Campbell police. Each evening,
Steven, 10, was spanked severely
with a 14-inch wooden spoon, "be
cause that's what the Bible says to
do," Blomquist told police.
Steven, now listed in fair condi
tion at the Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital, has been
treated for malnutrition, kidney
failure, dehydration and jaundice
and is expected to recover.
Steven received daily food ra
tions of unprocessed milk, three
eggs and food supplements. He
was near death when paramedics
responded to a call made by one of
the Blomquists' other three chil
dren, ages 4, 15 and 18.
The Blomquists' 15-year-old
daughter and 4-year-old son are in
custody of the state pending fur
ther developments. The children
could be placed in foster care or re
turned to their parents if they are
released.

Auto burglary
attempt thwarted
Stanford Police arrested Jorge
Nunez Toledo of San Jose in con
nection with an attempted auto
burglary in the Alumni House
parking lot Tuesday afternoon.
Toledo was first spotted in the
Lagunita Court parking lot at
12:25 p.m. by Stanford employee
Luis Chavez, who was eating his
lunch outside near the lot, said
Sgt. Del Bandy.
Toledo was examining the in
side of each car in the parking lot
and was attempting to break into a
car with a "slim jim," a thin metal
bar usually used by tow truck dri
vers to force open car doors, Bandy
said. Toledo was also wearing
gloves at the time, he added.
After calling police, Chavez ap
proached Toledo and asked him to
show some identification. Toledo
pulled out his car registration
form, showed it to Chavez and then
drove off, according to Bandy.
Chavez identified the suspect for
police in the Alumni House parking
lot at 12:49 p.m., Bandy said.
Toledo was booked into North
County Jail and charged with at
tempted burglary. Bail was set at
$5,000. Bandy said he may also be
charged with possession of bur
glary tools.
Over the last three months,
Stanford Police have observed a
consistent rate of auto burglaries,
Bandy said.

Cowell to cut
pediatric services
Beginning Aug. 1, graduate stu
dents will no longer be able to
bring their children to Cowell Stu
dent Health Center to receive
medical attention.
Cowell administrators decided
last Thursday to discontinue the
center's pediatric services. But a
plan to relocate affordable pedi
atric care to facilities on Welch
Road is currently in the works, ac
cording to John Dorman, Cowell's
director of public relations.
Parents expressed disappoint
ment and anger at the plans to
close Cowell's pediatric services.
"I was in disbelief," said Escondi
do Village resident Carolina
Montes, who has been taking her
three-year-old son to Cowell since
last year.
The Medical School's Faculty
Practice Program (FPP), which
currently provides pediatric ser
vices at Cowell, announced earlier
last week that it would reduce its
hours next year to only about 10
per week because there have not
been enough patients to sustain
the program financially.
Instead of accepting the cut
back in pediatric hours, which
would cripple Cowell's ability to
provide adequate care on demand
for its younger patients, Cowell
administrators opted to dissolve
its pediatric services completely.
"It is not in the best interests of
the student family population for
us to try to provide quality pedi
atric services on such a limited
basis," Dorman wrote in a draft of
a letter which will be sent to par
ents of all pediatric patients at
Cowell.
In previous years, physicians
from the Palo Alto Medical Clinic
provided pediatric care at Cowell.
But when the Medical School took
over last fall, many parents of
Cowell pediatric patients followed
their children's physicians back to
the Palo Alto clinic, decreasing the
number of patients dramatically.
Parents learned about Cowell's
possible termination of its pedi
atric services in mid-June and
were advised to find alternative
pediatric care for their children for
the next school year, Montes said.
In response, more than 90 par
ents sent petitions and letters to
Cowell in late June, urging its ad
ministrators to maintain its pedi
atric services.
Parents are now meeting with
each other to discuss the Cowell
plans. Many said they are also
planning to hold a "town meeting"
in the next few days to voice their
concerns to physicians and Cowell
administrators.
"Our main objective is to keep it
open," said Teresa Clement,
mother of a ten-month old son.
She said she is waiting for fur
ther information about the advan
tages of the Welch Road clinic,
compared to other area clinics be
fore she decides to transfer her
son's pediatric care there.
Since January, FPP had been
looking for more efficient alterna
tives for the student families, said
its Medical director, Peter Grego
ry.
While an average pediatrician
receives about 3,500-4,500 visits
per year, Cowell's pediatric service
receives about 800-900, according
to Gregory.
"We've known all year that we
needed to see more patients," said
pediatric nurse Mitzi Van Sant,
adding that a plan to attract more
graduate students to Cowell has
been "put on hold" by the recent
developments.
The Welch Road pediatric
group, which already serves many
student, families, is likely to up
grade current pediatric care by
providing more comprehensive
care seven days a week, Gregory
said. And patients will be able to
choose their physician from six
full-time board-certified pediatri
cians. Cowell currently offers one

half-time family practice physi
cian.
Gregory added that the costs
for parents will probably not differ
dramatically from the Cowell ser
vices, although Cowell's low im
munization fees will not be main
tained at the new location.
Cowell's pediatric care provides
substantial savings for low-in
come graduate students. For ex
ample, it offers a 15 percent dis
count over Stanford Clinic prices,
which are similar to those of other
local clinics, Van Sant said.
Also, because vaccines are pro
vided by the county, Cowell only
charges an administration fee of
$5.88 for each shot. Other clinics
charge between $35 and $45 each,
according to Van Sant.
And many graduate students
said they are worried that the
Welch Road location, if approved,
may prove to be more inconve
nient for them. While there is a
Marguerite shuttle that goes from
Escondido Village to Welch Road,
Cowell is within walking distance,
Montes said.
"It's so convenient for us,"
Clement said, adding that "it's
nice to know that you can walk
there — especially if you have a
sick baby."
Van Sant also said she was con
cerned about the attention many
international students would re
ceive "if they're set out into the
community where offices are a lot
bigger."
"It takes a lot of time with the
students in terms of bridging that
language barrier," she said,
adding that about half of Cowell's
pediatric patients are internation
al student families.
Montes expressed frustration
that many decisions were made
about Cowell pediatrics without
consulting the parents. "We're on
the tail-end" of the process, she
said. She added that because many
students are away during the sum
mer, there is a "smaller base" of
affected parents to oppose the
changes.
Gregory said FPP has been
working with Cowell so far, and
has not contacted the parents. But
they "would be delighted to talk
with parents," he said. "We really
do have the students' best inter
ests at heart."

Betas can't fill
house, lose it
More than 25 men who had
planned to live in the Beta Theta
Pi fraternity next year were forced
to change their plans late last
month when the University told
them that the fraternity will lose
its house for at least the next year

because members failed to attract
enough people to fill it.
The fraternity will become a co
ed, University-operated house
next year, open to students on the
waiting list. The 26 men slated to
live in the 38-bed house will be
guaranteed housing through the
waiting list, officials said.
"The University needs to re
ceive that revenue," said Janyce
Prothro, assistant director of the
Row. "Whether the University
was in a budget crunch or not, the
concern is we've got a house left
(partially) empty."
Despite the late notice, losing
the house "wasn't completely out
of the blue," said Beta President
Kurt Hurtado from his home in
Texas. He said members and new
pledges had realized before Rush
that the fraternity might have
trouble filling the house.
Although the Betas had a
strong Rush this year — attract
ing nine new pledges, after attract
ing only one last year — the hous
ing glut on campus prevented the
fraternity from recruiting enough
boarders to fill the remainder of
the house, Hurtado said. And a
number of upperclassmen have
left the fraternity early, creating a
"huge gap" in its membership, he
said.
Hurtado said fraternity mem
bers are "optimistic" that they will
be able to restructure the fraterni
ty during the next year and re
claim the house. Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Heather Dunn said she
plans to help reorganize the
"loosely structured" Betas next
year, and added that they "have a
really good chance" to return to
the house if the restructuring ef
fort is successful.
The fraternity has an agree
ment with the University that it
can reclaim the house when it re
cruits enough members to fill the
house to about three-quarters of
its capacity, Hurtado said.
The first step in the reorganiza
tion, he said, will be to reaffiliate
with the national chapter of Beta
Theta Pi, which dropped the Stan
ford fraternity two years ago. Hur
tado said he has already met with
national Beta representatives, and
added that they are receptive to
the idea of reaffiliating.
The fraternity must also build a
better structure by appointing
more officers to run different
functions, Hurtado said. The
house "was run basically like a
self-op the last few years, like any
other Row house," he said. "There
were not enough people to do the
jobs that fraternities require. Now
we have people interested in doing
those jobs."
Hurtado said the Betas also plan
more frequent activities during the
next year. "We're hoping to use this

as a chance to show that we're not
just a group of guys who live togeth
er, but rather a fraternity that can
survive with or without a house,"
he said. This year's pledge class, he
added, "still seems excited."
The decision to remove the
Betas from their house was made
June 12, when a group of "four or
five officers" met with Prothro
and told her they would not be able
to fill the house, Prothro said. The
Office of Residential Education,
she said, "felt there was no other

members were sent Draw books

Stanford applies
for housing project
Stanford and Sand Hill Senior
Partners, a group of local in
vestors, submitted an application
Thursday to the city of Palo Alto
for a long-awaited housing project
on West Campus.
The project consists of 1,210
units to be built on University
owned land between Sand Hill
Road and San Francisquito
Creek.
According to Andrew Doty, di
rector of community relations at
Stanford, the application process
is only the first step in the pro
ject's planning, which is expected
to take about two to three more
years, if all goes as scheduled.
Doty said the project expects to
get a "positive response" from the
Palo Alto City Council, which
must approve the project before
construction can begin.
Stanford's plans for building
housing on the vacant lot have

failed once already. In 1983, Stan
ford aborted a plan to construct
1,100 units when the city of Palo
Alto approved the plan, but im
posed conditions on areas outside
its jursidiction that Stanford felt
were "unfair," Doty said.
But in the past few years, Doty
said, Stanford "has been under
pressure. . .from both the city and
the county to build more housing,"
so the city is unlikely to impose re
strictions this time.
But he said the project expects
substantial resistance from Menlo
Park residents who may oppose
the construction of a large-scale
housing project next to their
homes. However, a 16-acre archae
ological preserve along San Fran
cisquito Creek that will separate
the project from the residents
should placate the ; r concerns,
Doty said.
Included in the building plan
are 750 University-owned housing
units, most of which will be rented
to faculty and staff. Remaining
University-owned units will be
rented by a "tiered priority system
to others working on Stanford
land, such as those working at the
shopping center," Doty said.
These units, which have been in
the planning stage for three to
four years, will cost the University
more than $160 million, according
to Doty. The cost will eventually
be offset by rental revenue, which
will be the sole source of the pro
ject's income, Doty said.
Sand Hill Senior Partners will
build an adjacent retirement com

munity consisting of 460 condo
minium units. The group will
lease University land formerly oc
cupied by the Childrens' Hospital.
The Sand Hill Senior Partners
project will also include an Age
Center for gerontology and educa
tion to be utilized by researchers
at Stanford.
"Surveys in the Sociology De
partment and in the School of
Medicine have shown much inter
est in having a group of seniors
close by for study and interview
ing," Doty said.
When planning is complete,
construction of the units is expect
ed to last one year, according to
Doty.

Blomquist faces
arraignment today
Daniel Blomquist, an assistant
manager in the Controller's Of
fice, will face two charges of child
abuse today when he is arraigned
for subjecting his son to unjustifi
able pain and suffering and endan
gering the boy's life.
Blomquist, who was arrested
July 1, is held on $150,000 bail at
the Santa Clara County Jail.
Blomquist's wife, Ethel
Blomquist, was arrested July 2 in
conjunction with the incident. She
is free on $5,000 bond and awaits
arraignment July 20.
Cynthia Sevely, the prosecut
ing attorney for Santa Clara Coun
ty, called it a "slam dunk case."

With Daniel Blomquist's confes
sion and the condition of the vic
tim on file, Sevely said she does not
foresee any difficulty in prosecut
ing the defendants. Although a
plea of "not guilty" is expected at
the arraignment, she anticipates a
plea bargain before the case would
go to trial.
If convicted, Daniel Blomquist
could serve a nine-year prison
term. The maximum sentence
Ethel Blomquist could serve is six
years.
Religious beliefs motivated
Blomquist to beat his son, who
was "rebellious," Blomquist told
Campbell police. Each evening,
Steven, 10, was spanked severely
with a 14-inch wooden spoon, "be
cause that's what the Bible says to
do," Blomquist told police.
Steven, now listed in fair condi
tion at the Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital, has been
treated for malnutrition, kidney
failure, dehydration and jaundice
and is expected to recover.
Steven received daily food ra
tions of unprocessed milk, three
eggs and food supplements. He
was near death when paramedics
responded to a call made by one of
the Blomquists' other three chil
dren, ages 4, 15 and 18.
The Blomquists' 15-year-old
daughter and 4-year-old son are in
custody of the state pending fur
ther developments. The children
could be placed in foster care or re
turned to their parents if they are
released.

Auto burglary
attempt thwarted
Stanford Police arrested Jorge
Nunez Toledo of San Jose in con
nection with an attempted auto
burglary in the Alumni House
parking lot Tuesday afternoon.
Toledo was first spotted in the
Lagunita Court parking lot at
12:25 p.m. by Stanford employee
Luis Chavez, who was eating his
lunch outside near the lot, said
Sgt. Del Bandy.
Toledo was examining the in
side of each car in the parking lot
and was attempting to break into a
car with a "slim jim," a thin metal
bar usually used by tow truck dri
vers to force open car doors, Bandy
said. Toledo was also wearing
gloves at the time, he added.
After calling police, Chavez ap
proached Toledo and asked him to
show some identification. Toledo
pulled out his car registration
form, showed it to Chavez and then
drove off, according to Bandy.
Chavez identified the suspect for
police in the Alumni House parking
lot at 12:49 p.m., Bandy said.
Toledo was booked into North
County Jail and charged with at
tempted burglary. Bail was set at
$5,000. Bandy said he may also be
charged with possession of bur
glary tools.
Over the last three months,
Stanford Police have observed a
consistent rate of auto burglaries,
Bandy said.

Cowell to cut
pediatric services
Beginning Aug. 1, graduate stu
dents will no longer be able to
bring their children to Cowell Stu
dent Health Center to receive
medical attention.
Cowell administrators decided
last Thursday to discontinue the
center's pediatric services. But a
plan to relocate affordable pedi
atric care to facilities on Welch
Road is currently in the works, ac
cording to John Dorman, Cowell's
director of public relations.
Parents expressed disappoint
ment and anger at the plans to
close Cowell's pediatric services.
"I was in disbelief," said Escondi
do Village resident Carolina
Montes, who has been taking her
three-year-old son to Cowell since
last year.
The Medical School's Faculty
Practice Program (FPP), which
currently provides pediatric ser
vices at Cowell, announced earlier
last week that it would reduce its
hours next year to only about 10
per week because there have not
been enough patients to sustain
the program financially.
Instead of accepting the cut
back in pediatric hours, which
would cripple Cowell's ability to
provide adequate care on demand
for its younger patients, Cowell
administrators opted to dissolve
its pediatric services completely.
"It is not in the best interests of
the student family population for
us to try to provide quality pedi
atric services on such a limited
basis," Dorman wrote in a draft of
a letter which will be sent to par
ents of all pediatric patients at
Cowell.
In previous years, physicians
from the Palo Alto Medical Clinic
provided pediatric care at Cowell.
But when the Medical School took
over last fall, many parents of
Cowell pediatric patients followed
their children's physicians back to
the Palo Alto clinic, decreasing the
number of patients dramatically.
Parents learned about Cowell's
possible termination of its pedi
atric services in mid-June and
were advised to find alternative
pediatric care for their children for
the next school year, Montes said.
In response, more than 90 par
ents sent petitions and letters to
Cowell in late June, urging its ad
ministrators to maintain its pedi
atric services.
Parents are now meeting with
each other to discuss the Cowell
plans. Many said they are also
planning to hold a "town meeting"
in the next few days to voice their
concerns to physicians and Cowell
administrators.
"Our main objective is to keep it
open," said Teresa Clement,
mother of a ten-month old son.
She said she is waiting for fur
ther information about the advan
tages of the Welch Road clinic,
compared to other area clinics be
fore she decides to transfer her
son's pediatric care there.
Since January, FPP had been
looking for more efficient alterna
tives for the student families, said
its Medical director, Peter Grego
ry.
While an average pediatrician
receives about 3,500-4,500 visits
per year, Cowell's pediatric service
receives about 800-900, according
to Gregory.
"We've known all year that we
needed to see more patients," said
pediatric nurse Mitzi Van Sant,
adding that a plan to attract more
graduate students to Cowell has
been "put on hold" by the recent
developments.
The Welch Road pediatric
group, which already serves many
student, families, is likely to up
grade current pediatric care by
providing more comprehensive
care seven days a week, Gregory
said. And patients will be able to
choose their physician from six
full-time board-certified pediatri
cians. Cowell currently offers one

half-time family practice physi
cian.
Gregory added that the costs
for parents will probably not differ
dramatically from the Cowell ser
vices, although Cowell's low im
munization fees will not be main
tained at the new location.
Cowell's pediatric care provides
substantial savings for low-in
come graduate students. For ex
ample, it offers a 15 percent dis
count over Stanford Clinic prices,
which are similar to those of other
local clinics, Van Sant said.
Also, because vaccines are pro
vided by the county, Cowell only
charges an administration fee of
$5.88 for each shot. Other clinics
charge between $35 and $45 each,
according to Van Sant.
And many graduate students
said they are worried that the
Welch Road location, if approved,
may prove to be more inconve
nient for them. While there is a
Marguerite shuttle that goes from
Escondido Village to Welch Road,
Cowell is within walking distance,
Montes said.
"It's so convenient for us,"
Clement said, adding that "it's
nice to know that you can walk
there — especially if you have a
sick baby."
Van Sant also said she was con
cerned about the attention many
international students would re
ceive "if they're set out into the
community where offices are a lot
bigger."
"It takes a lot of time with the
students in terms of bridging that
language barrier," she said,
adding that about half of Cowell's
pediatric patients are internation
al student families.
Montes expressed frustration
that many decisions were made
about Cowell pediatrics without
consulting the parents. "We're on
the tail-end" of the process, she
said. She added that because many
students are away during the sum
mer, there is a "smaller base" of
affected parents to oppose the
changes.
Gregory said FPP has been
working with Cowell so far, and
has not contacted the parents. But
they "would be delighted to talk
with parents," he said. "We really
do have the students' best inter
ests at heart."

Betas can't fill
house, lose it
More than 25 men who had
planned to live in the Beta Theta
Pi fraternity next year were forced
to change their plans late last
month when the University told
them that the fraternity will lose
its house for at least the next year

because members failed to attract
enough people to fill it.
The fraternity will become a co
ed, University-operated house
next year, open to students on the
waiting list. The 26 men slated to
live in the 38-bed house will be
guaranteed housing through the
waiting list, officials said.
"The University needs to re
ceive that revenue," said Janyce
Prothro, assistant director of the
Row. "Whether the University
was in a budget crunch or not, the
concern is we've got a house left
(partially) empty."
Despite the late notice, losing
the house "wasn't completely out
of the blue," said Beta President
Kurt Hurtado from his home in
Texas. He said members and new
pledges had realized before Rush
that the fraternity might have
trouble filling the house.
Although the Betas had a
strong Rush this year — attract
ing nine new pledges, after attract
ing only one last year — the hous
ing glut on campus prevented the
fraternity from recruiting enough
boarders to fill the remainder of
the house, Hurtado said. And a
number of upperclassmen have
left the fraternity early, creating a
"huge gap" in its membership, he
said.
Hurtado said fraternity mem
bers are "optimistic" that they will
be able to restructure the fraterni
ty during the next year and re
claim the house. Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Heather Dunn said she
plans to help reorganize the
"loosely structured" Betas next
year, and added that they "have a
really good chance" to return to
the house if the restructuring ef
fort is successful.
The fraternity has an agree
ment with the University that it
can reclaim the house when it re
cruits enough members to fill the
house to about three-quarters of
its capacity, Hurtado said.
The first step in the reorganiza
tion, he said, will be to reaffiliate
with the national chapter of Beta
Theta Pi, which dropped the Stan
ford fraternity two years ago. Hur
tado said he has already met with
national Beta representatives, and
added that they are receptive to
the idea of reaffiliating.
The fraternity must also build a
better structure by appointing
more officers to run different
functions, Hurtado said. The
house "was run basically like a
self-op the last few years, like any
other Row house," he said. "There
were not enough people to do the
jobs that fraternities require. Now
we have people interested in doing
those jobs."
Hurtado said the Betas also plan
more frequent activities during the
next year. "We're hoping to use this

as a chance to show that we're not
just a group of guys who live togeth
er, but rather a fraternity that can
survive with or without a house,"
he said. This year's pledge class, he
added, "still seems excited."
The decision to remove the
Betas from their house was made
June 12, when a group of "four or
five officers" met with Prothro
and told her they would not be able
to fill the house, Prothro said. The
Office of Residential Education,
she said, "felt there was no other
option" but to convert the frater
nity into a University-operated
house.
In letters dated June 28, Beta
members were sent Draw books
and "invited to enter the waiting
list," Prothro said.

Plan to renovate
housing released
Modular furniture, structural
repairs, computer upgrades and
cosmetic repairs are all part of the
10-year "Capital Improvements
Plan" to be implemented in the
next decade.
The plan, produced through a
cooperative effort between Resi
dential Education and Housing
and Food Services, calls for reno
vations in all student housing to
occur between 1992 and 2002,
with a projected cost of approxi
mately $80 million.
Members of a Board of Trustees
committee were concerned that as
the University begins its four-year
guaranteed housing pledge, some
students and administrators still
will complain about the equity of
the various campus housing.
"When you build a Kimball and
a Manzanita across the street, you
know you have to get into Wilbur
and do some renovations," said
Keith Guy, director of Housing
and Food Services.
Kiyon Chung, a senior who
spent two years in Soto House, ex
pressed a similar concern. "It's a
shame there's such a disparity of
housing when everyone pays
about the same amount," she said.
Housing and Food Services con
tracted Genesis Research, Inc.
earlier this year to administer a
market survey of student concerns
and complaints. Some of the im
provements students said they
wanted were greater computer ac
cess, more living space, modular
furniture, better sound proofing
and better lighting.
Housing and Food Services also
commissioned Intelligent Systems
and Engineering Services to make
structural recommendations, which
included earthquake safety in Lagu
nita Court, asbestos removal and
containment in Escondido Village

and better disability access.
The 10-year plan will upgrade
residences by selecting one large
dorm, several Row houses and
100-150 apartments each year to
renovate.
For example, 1992-1993 reno
vations will occur in Wilbur, Beta,
Storey, 553 Mayfleld, Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk and 150 Escondido Vil
lage apartments, and will include
structural repairs, furniture re
placement, roof repair, food ser
vice renovations and upgrades in
lighting and computer clusters.
Also, Escondido Village renova
tions will include removal and con
tainment of asbestos-containing
materials in the floor and ceilings
as well as more modern furniture
and appliances.
Plans for computer renovations
were based on input by resident
computer coordinators, and in
clude new clusters in Escondido
Village and the Row.
Also, as more students pur
chase personal computers of their
own, clusters may become smaller,
providing higher-end machines
and meeting more specific com
puting needs. In-room SUNet con
nections are also a goal, but the
cost and date of these renovations
are still uncertain.
The plan proposes to examine
the possibility of making all resi
dences accessible to people with
disabilities. Unfortunately, this
means only first-floor ramp ac
cess; elevators and lifts are not in
cluded in the current plan.
Some of the funding for the pro
ject will come from gifts and cost
cutting measures within Housing
and Food Services, but the majori
ty will come from loans to be re
paid in the next seven to 25 years.
8
However, the amount and type
of student input is still unclear,
and it is unlikely that students will
have a say in the renova
tions. Instead, they may help de
cide things such as paint color.
Although several students cited
"small dorm atmosphere" and lin
ear hallways as good things about
Wilbur, they also felt that renova
tions were long overdue.
"At this point, any change in
the Wilbur complex would be a
renovation," said Mike Duh, a for
mer Trancos resident.

Skaters stay away,
wary of fines
The threat of a $100 fine seems
to have deterred most skateboard
ers from defying a county ruling
that prohibits skateboarding in
the central academic campus, po
lice say.
Since the April 7 Santa Clara
County ruling, the number of
complaints police have received
about skateboarders has fallen
dramatically, said Stanford Police
Capt. Marvin Moore.
Although he said limited class
es and visitors during the summer
may be a factor, he believes the or
dinance is primarily responsible
for the decline in complaints.
The skateboarders disrupted
classes, damaged property and en
dangered pedestrians, said Andy
Doty, Stanford's director of com
munity relations.
According to Moore, until the
police finish posting signs stating
the restriction, officers respond
ing to complaints will give skate
boarders one warning. Violators'
names are added to a data base
now listing 200 to 300 names. Re
peat offenders are cited and sub
ject to the $ 100 fine.
Only a handful of skateboard
ers have actually been cited,
Moore said, but he added that offi
cers will not hesitate to enforce the
law if necessary.
Although sympathetic to stu
dents using skateboards only for
transportation, Moore said the de
partment "has no mechanism for

exceptions" and therefore must
take a "consistent stance" in light
of the ordinance.
The threat of fines has discour
aged most, but some skateboarders
said the threat has increased the
thrill of skateboarding on campus.
A few have chosen to defy the
law. One said, "All the cops want
you to do is kiss their butts for a
few minutes and they'll let you
go." This high school student and
his peers say they can always "just
run away." To maintain anonymi
ty, the skateboarders declined to
give their names.
Stanford's stretches of con
crete, broad steps and benches for
merly attracted skateboarders
from all over the Bay Area. A
group performing stunts near the
Post Office explained that Stan
ford offers a diverse selection of
terrain in a compact area. The re
maining skateboarders claim only
locals now venture into the terri
tory.
Although Palo Alto has con
structed d complex for skateboard
ers, it is not well liked. Because the
complex requires protective gear
and closes at 5 p.m., one skater
said the situation is "like giving us
something and then taking half of
it back."
Another said most skaters
would rather have the park open
from 5 to 9 p.m. rather than 9 to 5
p.m.
A group practicing at History
Corner said their options are limit
ed. They claim local skateboarders
must travel to San Francisco,
Berkeley or San Jose to find chal
lenging concrete formations or
risk being caught at Stanford.
The ordinance was sought by
the Stanford Police and the Office
of Public Affairs in response to
complaints from the faculty, staff
and public. Doty said skateboard
ers ignore requests or respond
with a rude attitude and vulgar
tongue.
The ordinance's intention,
Doty said, was to give leverage to
University authorities in eliminat
ing the problem. The desire was to
restore the academic environment
and promote safety.

Stanford applies

for its younger patients, Cowell
administrators opted to dissolve
its pediatric services completely.
"It is not in the best interests of
the student family population for
us to try to provide quality pedi
atric services on such a limited
basis," Dorman wrote in a draft of
a letter which will be sent to par
ents of all pediatric patients at
Cowell.
In previous years, physicians
from the Palo Alto Medical Clinic
provided pediatric care at Cowell.
But when the Medical School took
over last fall, many parents of
Cowell pediatric patients followed
their children's physicians back to
the Palo Alto clinic, decreasing the
number of patients dramatically.
Parents learned about Cowell's
possible termination of its pedi
atric services in mid-June and
were advised to find alternative
pediatric care for their children for
the next school year, Montes said.
In response, more than 90 par
ents sent petitions and letters to
Cowell in late June, urging its ad
ministrators to maintain its pedi
atric services.
Parents are now meeting with
each other to discuss the Cowell
plans. Many said they are also
planning to hold a "town meeting"
in the next few days to voice their
concerns to physicians and Cowell
administrators.
"Our main objective is to keep it
open," said Teresa Clement,
mother of a ten-month old son.
She said she is waiting for fur
ther information about the advan
tages of the Welch Road clinic,
compared to other area clinics be
fore she decides to transfer her
son's pediatric care there.
Since January, FPP had been
looking for more efficient alterna
tives for the student families, said
its Medical director, Peter Grego
ry.
While an average pediatrician
receives about 3,500-4,500 visits
per year, Cowell's pediatric service
receives about 800-900, according
to Gregory.
"We've known all year that we
needed to see more patients," said
pediatric nurse Mitzi Van Sant,
adding that a plan to attract more
graduate students to Cowell has
been "put on hold" by the recent
developments.
The Welch Road pediatric
group, which already serves many
student, families, is likely to up
grade current pediatric care by
providing more comprehensive
care seven days a week, Gregory
said. And patients will be able to
choose their physician from six
full-time board-certified pediatri
cians. Cowell currently offers one

half-time family practice physi
cian.
Gregory added that the costs
for parents will probably not differ
dramatically from the Cowell ser
vices, although Cowell's low im
munization fees will not be main
tained at the new location.
Cowell's pediatric care provides
substantial savings for low-in
come graduate students. For ex
ample, it offers a 15 percent dis
count over Stanford Clinic prices,
which are similar to those of other
local clinics, Van Sant said.
Also, because vaccines are pro
vided by the county, Cowell only
charges an administration fee of
$5.88 for each shot. Other clinics
charge between $35 and $45 each,
according to Van Sant.
And many graduate students
said they are worried that the
Welch Road location, if approved,
may prove to be more inconve
nient for them. While there is a
Marguerite shuttle that goes from
Escondido Village to Welch Road,
Cowell is within walking distance,
Montes said.
"It's so convenient for us,"
Clement said, adding that "it's
nice to know that you can walk
there — especially if you have a
sick baby."
Van Sant also said she was con
cerned about the attention many
international students would re
ceive "if they're set out into the
community where offices are a lot
bigger."
"It takes a lot of time with the
students in terms of bridging that
language barrier," she said,
adding that about half of Cowell's
pediatric patients are internation
al student families.
Montes expressed frustration
that many decisions were made
about Cowell pediatrics without
consulting the parents. "We're on
the tail-end" of the process, she
said. She added that because many
students are away during the sum
mer, there is a "smaller base" of
affected parents to oppose the
changes.
Gregory said FPP has been
working with Cowell so far, and
has not contacted the parents. But
they "would be delighted to talk
with parents," he said. "We really
do have the students' best inter
ests at heart."

Betas can't fill
house, lose it
More than 25 men who had
planned to live in the Beta Theta
Pi fraternity next year were forced
to change their plans late last
month when the University told
them that the fraternity will lose
its house for at least the next year

because members failed to attract
enough people to fill it.
The fraternity will become a co
ed, University-operated house
next year, open to students on the
waiting list. The 26 men slated to
live in the 38-bed house will be
guaranteed housing through the
waiting list, officials said.
"The University needs to re
ceive that revenue," said Janyce
Prothro, assistant director of the
Row. "Whether the University
was in a budget crunch or not, the
concern is we've got a house left
(partially) empty."
Despite the late notice, losing
the house "wasn't completely out
of the blue," said Beta President
Kurt Hurtado from his home in
Texas. He said members and new
pledges had realized before Rush
that the fraternity might have
trouble filling the house.
Although the Betas had a
strong Rush this year — attract
ing nine new pledges, after attract
ing only one last year — the hous
ing glut on campus prevented the
fraternity from recruiting enough
boarders to fill the remainder of
the house, Hurtado said. And a
number of upperclassmen have
left the fraternity early, creating a
"huge gap" in its membership, he
said.
Hurtado said fraternity mem
bers are "optimistic" that they will
be able to restructure the fraterni
ty during the next year and re
claim the house. Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Heather Dunn said she
plans to help reorganize the
"loosely structured" Betas next
year, and added that they "have a
really good chance" to return to
the house if the restructuring ef
fort is successful.
The fraternity has an agree
ment with the University that it
can reclaim the house when it re
cruits enough members to fill the
house to about three-quarters of
its capacity, Hurtado said.
The first step in the reorganiza
tion, he said, will be to reaffiliate
with the national chapter of Beta
Theta Pi, which dropped the Stan
ford fraternity two years ago. Hur
tado said he has already met with
national Beta representatives, and
added that they are receptive to
the idea of reaffiliating.
The fraternity must also build a
better structure by appointing
more officers to run different
functions, Hurtado said. The
house "was run basically like a
self-op the last few years, like any
other Row house," he said. "There
were not enough people to do the
jobs that fraternities require. Now
we have people interested in doing
those jobs."
Hurtado said the Betas also plan
more frequent activities during the
next year. "We're hoping to use this

as a chance to show that we're not
just a group of guys who live togeth
er, but rather a fraternity that can
survive with or without a house,"
he said. This year's pledge class, he
added, "still seems excited."
The decision to remove the
Betas from their house was made
June 12, when a group of "four or
five officers" met with Prothro
and told her they would not be able
to fill the house, Prothro said. The
Office of Residential Education,
she said, "felt there was no other
option" but to convert the frater
nity into a University-operated
house.
In letters dated June 28, Beta
members were sent Draw books
and "invited to enter the waiting
list," Prothro said.

Plan to renovate
housing released
Modular furniture, structural
repairs, computer upgrades and
cosmetic repairs are all part of the
10-year "Capital Improvements
Plan" to be implemented in the
next decade.
The plan, produced through a
cooperative effort between Resi
dential Education and Housing
and Food Services, calls for reno
vations in all student housing to
occur between 1992 and 2002,
with a projected cost of approxi
mately $80 million.
Members of a Board of Trustees
committee were concerned that as
the University begins its four-year
guaranteed housing pledge, some
students and administrators still
will complain about the equity of
the various campus housing.
"When you build a Kimball and
a Manzanita across the street, you
know you have to get into Wilbur
and do some renovations," said
Keith Guy, director of Housing
and Food Services.
Kiyon Chung, a senior who
spent two years in Soto House, ex
pressed a similar concern. "It's a
shame there's such a disparity of
housing when everyone pays
about the same amount," she said.
Housing and Food Services con
tracted Genesis Research, Inc.
earlier this year to administer a
market survey of student concerns
and complaints. Some of the im
provements students said they
wanted were greater computer ac
cess, more living space, modular
furniture, better sound proofing
and better lighting.
Housing and Food Services also
commissioned Intelligent Systems
and Engineering Services to make
structural recommendations, which
included earthquake safety in Lagu
nita Court, asbestos removal and
containment in Escondido Village

and better disability access.
The 10-year plan will upgrade
residences by selecting one large
dorm, several Row houses and
100-150 apartments each year to
renovate.
For example, 1992-1993 reno
vations will occur in Wilbur, Beta,
Storey, 553 Mayfleld, Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk and 150 Escondido Vil
lage apartments, and will include
structural repairs, furniture re
placement, roof repair, food ser
vice renovations and upgrades in
lighting and computer clusters.
Also, Escondido Village renova
tions will include removal and con
tainment of asbestos-containing
materials in the floor and ceilings
as well as more modern furniture
and appliances.
Plans for computer renovations
were based on input by resident
computer coordinators, and in
clude new clusters in Escondido
Village and the Row.
Also, as more students pur
chase personal computers of their
own, clusters may become smaller,
providing higher-end machines
and meeting more specific com
puting needs. In-room SUNet con
nections are also a goal, but the
cost and date of these renovations
are still uncertain.
The plan proposes to examine
the possibility of making all resi
dences accessible to people with
disabilities. Unfortunately, this
means only first-floor ramp ac
cess; elevators and lifts are not in
cluded in the current plan.
Some of the funding for the pro
ject will come from gifts and cost
cutting measures within Housing
and Food Services, but the majori
ty will come from loans to be re
paid in the next seven to 25 years.
8
However, the amount and type
of student input is still unclear,
and it is unlikely that students will
have a say in the renova
tions. Instead, they may help de
cide things such as paint color.
Although several students cited
"small dorm atmosphere" and lin
ear hallways as good things about
Wilbur, they also felt that renova
tions were long overdue.
"At this point, any change in
the Wilbur complex would be a
renovation," said Mike Duh, a for
mer Trancos resident.

Skaters stay away,
wary of fines
The threat of a $100 fine seems
to have deterred most skateboard
ers from defying a county ruling
that prohibits skateboarding in
the central academic campus, po
lice say.
Since the April 7 Santa Clara
County ruling, the number of
complaints police have received
about skateboarders has fallen
dramatically, said Stanford Police
Capt. Marvin Moore.
Although he said limited class
es and visitors during the summer
may be a factor, he believes the or
dinance is primarily responsible
for the decline in complaints.
The skateboarders disrupted
classes, damaged property and en
dangered pedestrians, said Andy
Doty, Stanford's director of com
munity relations.
According to Moore, until the
police finish posting signs stating
the restriction, officers respond
ing to complaints will give skate
boarders one warning. Violators'
names are added to a data base
now listing 200 to 300 names. Re
peat offenders are cited and sub
ject to the $ 100 fine.
Only a handful of skateboard
ers have actually been cited,
Moore said, but he added that offi
cers will not hesitate to enforce the
law if necessary.
Although sympathetic to stu
dents using skateboards only for
transportation, Moore said the de
partment "has no mechanism for

exceptions" and therefore must
take a "consistent stance" in light
of the ordinance.
The threat of fines has discour
aged most, but some skateboarders
said the threat has increased the
thrill of skateboarding on campus.
A few have chosen to defy the
law. One said, "All the cops want
you to do is kiss their butts for a
few minutes and they'll let you
go." This high school student and
his peers say they can always "just
run away." To maintain anonymi
ty, the skateboarders declined to
give their names.
Stanford's stretches of con
crete, broad steps and benches for
merly attracted skateboarders
from all over the Bay Area. A
group performing stunts near the
Post Office explained that Stan
ford offers a diverse selection of
terrain in a compact area. The re
maining skateboarders claim only
locals now venture into the terri
tory.
Although Palo Alto has con
structed d complex for skateboard
ers, it is not well liked. Because the
complex requires protective gear
and closes at 5 p.m., one skater
said the situation is "like giving us
something and then taking half of
it back."
Another said most skaters
would rather have the park open
from 5 to 9 p.m. rather than 9 to 5
p.m.
A group practicing at History
Corner said their options are limit
ed. They claim local skateboarders
must travel to San Francisco,
Berkeley or San Jose to find chal
lenging concrete formations or
risk being caught at Stanford.
The ordinance was sought by
the Stanford Police and the Office
of Public Affairs in response to
complaints from the faculty, staff
and public. Doty said skateboard
ers ignore requests or respond
with a rude attitude and vulgar
tongue.
The ordinance's intention,
Doty said, was to give leverage to
University authorities in eliminat
ing the problem. The desire was to
restore the academic environment
and promote safety.

Stanford applies
for housing project
Stanford and Sand Hill Senior
Partners, a group of local in
vestors, submitted an application
Thursday to the city of Palo Alto
for a long-awaited housing project
on West Campus.
The project consists of 1,210
units to be built on University
owned land between Sand Hill
Road and San Francisquito
Creek.
According to Andrew Doty, di
rector of community relations at
Stanford, the application process
is only the first step in the pro
ject's planning, which is expected
to take about two to three more
years, if all goes as scheduled.
Doty said the project expects to
get a "positive response" from the
Palo Alto City Council, which
must approve the project before
construction can begin.
Stanford's plans for building
housing on the vacant lot have

failed once already. In 1983, Stan
ford aborted a plan to construct
1,100 units when the city of Palo
Alto approved the plan, but im
posed conditions on areas outside
its jursidiction that Stanford felt
were "unfair," Doty said.
But in the past few years, Doty
said, Stanford "has been under
pressure. . .from both the city and
the county to build more housing,"
so the city is unlikely to impose re
strictions this time.
But he said the project expects
substantial resistance from Menlo
Park residents who may oppose
the construction of a large-scale
housing project next to their
homes. However, a 16-acre archae
ological preserve along San Fran
cisquito Creek that will separate
the project from the residents
should placate the ; r concerns,
Doty said.
Included in the building plan
are 750 University-owned housing
units, most of which will be rented
to faculty and staff. Remaining
University-owned units will be
rented by a "tiered priority system
to others working on Stanford
land, such as those working at the
shopping center," Doty said.
These units, which have been in
the planning stage for three to
four years, will cost the University
more than $160 million, according
to Doty. The cost will eventually
be offset by rental revenue, which
will be the sole source of the pro
ject's income, Doty said.
Sand Hill Senior Partners will
build an adjacent retirement com

munity consisting of 460 condo
minium units. The group will
lease University land formerly oc
cupied by the Childrens' Hospital.
The Sand Hill Senior Partners
project will also include an Age
Center for gerontology and educa
tion to be utilized by researchers
at Stanford.
"Surveys in the Sociology De
partment and in the School of
Medicine have shown much inter
est in having a group of seniors
close by for study and interview
ing," Doty said.
When planning is complete,
construction of the units is expect
ed to last one year, according to
Doty.

Blomquist faces
arraignment today
Daniel Blomquist, an assistant
manager in the Controller's Of
fice, will face two charges of child
abuse today when he is arraigned
for subjecting his son to unjustifi
able pain and suffering and endan
gering the boy's life.
Blomquist, who was arrested
July 1, is held on $150,000 bail at
the Santa Clara County Jail.
Blomquist's wife, Ethel
Blomquist, was arrested July 2 in
conjunction with the incident. She
is free on $5,000 bond and awaits
arraignment July 20.
Cynthia Sevely, the prosecut
ing attorney for Santa Clara Coun
ty, called it a "slam dunk case."

With Daniel Blomquist's confes
sion and the condition of the vic
tim on file, Sevely said she does not
foresee any difficulty in prosecut
ing the defendants. Although a
plea of "not guilty" is expected at
the arraignment, she anticipates a
plea bargain before the case would
go to trial.
If convicted, Daniel Blomquist
could serve a nine-year prison
term. The maximum sentence
Ethel Blomquist could serve is six
years.
Religious beliefs motivated
Blomquist to beat his son, who
was "rebellious," Blomquist told
Campbell police. Each evening,
Steven, 10, was spanked severely
with a 14-inch wooden spoon, "be
cause that's what the Bible says to
do," Blomquist told police.
Steven, now listed in fair condi
tion at the Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital, has been
treated for malnutrition, kidney
failure, dehydration and jaundice
and is expected to recover.
Steven received daily food ra
tions of unprocessed milk, three
eggs and food supplements. He
was near death when paramedics
responded to a call made by one of
the Blomquists' other three chil
dren, ages 4, 15 and 18.
The Blomquists' 15-year-old
daughter and 4-year-old son are in
custody of the state pending fur
ther developments. The children
could be placed in foster care or re
turned to their parents if they are
released.

Auto burglary
attempt thwarted
Stanford Police arrested Jorge
Nunez Toledo of San Jose in con
nection with an attempted auto
burglary in the Alumni House
parking lot Tuesday afternoon.
Toledo was first spotted in the
Lagunita Court parking lot at
12:25 p.m. by Stanford employee
Luis Chavez, who was eating his
lunch outside near the lot, said
Sgt. Del Bandy.
Toledo was examining the in
side of each car in the parking lot
and was attempting to break into a
car with a "slim jim," a thin metal
bar usually used by tow truck dri
vers to force open car doors, Bandy
said. Toledo was also wearing
gloves at the time, he added.
After calling police, Chavez ap
proached Toledo and asked him to
show some identification. Toledo
pulled out his car registration
form, showed it to Chavez and then
drove off, according to Bandy.
Chavez identified the suspect for
police in the Alumni House parking
lot at 12:49 p.m., Bandy said.
Toledo was booked into North
County Jail and charged with at
tempted burglary. Bail was set at
$5,000. Bandy said he may also be
charged with possession of bur
glary tools.
Over the last three months,
Stanford Police have observed a
consistent rate of auto burglaries,
Bandy said.

Cowell to cut
pediatric services
Beginning Aug. 1, graduate stu
dents will no longer be able to
bring their children to Cowell Stu
dent Health Center to receive
medical attention.
Cowell administrators decided
last Thursday to discontinue the
center's pediatric services. But a
plan to relocate affordable pedi
atric care to facilities on Welch
Road is currently in the works, ac
cording to John Dorman, Cowell's
director of public relations.
Parents expressed disappoint
ment and anger at the plans to
close Cowell's pediatric services.
"I was in disbelief," said Escondi
do Village resident Carolina
Montes, who has been taking her
three-year-old son to Cowell since
last year.
The Medical School's Faculty
Practice Program (FPP), which
currently provides pediatric ser
vices at Cowell, announced earlier
last week that it would reduce its
hours next year to only about 10
per week because there have not
been enough patients to sustain
the program financially.
Instead of accepting the cut
back in pediatric hours, which
would cripple Cowell's ability to
provide adequate care on demand
for its younger patients, Cowell
administrators opted to dissolve
its pediatric services completely.
"It is not in the best interests of
the student family population for
us to try to provide quality pedi

Plan to renovate
housing released
Modular furniture, structural
repairs, computer upgrades and
cosmetic repairs are all part of the
10-year "Capital Improvements
Plan" to be implemented in the
next decade.
The plan, produced through a
cooperative effort between Resi
dential Education and Housing
and Food Services, calls for reno
vations in all student housing to
occur between 1992 and 2002,
with a projected cost of approxi
mately $80 million.
Members of a Board of Trustees
committee were concerned that as
the University begins its four-year
guaranteed housing pledge, some
students and administrators still
will complain about the equity of
the various campus housing.
"When you build a Kimball and
a Manzanita across the street, you
know you have to get into Wilbur
and do some renovations," said
Keith Guy, director of Housing
and Food Services.
Kiyon Chung, a senior who
spent two years in Soto House, ex
pressed a similar concern. "It's a
shame there's such a disparity of
housing when everyone pays
about the same amount," she said.
Housing and Food Services con
tracted Genesis Research, Inc.
earlier this year to administer a
market survey of student concerns
and complaints. Some of the im
provements students said they
wanted were greater computer ac
cess, more living space, modular
furniture, better sound proofing
and better lighting.
Housing and Food Services also
commissioned Intelligent Systems
and Engineering Services to make
structural recommendations, which
included earthquake safety in Lagu
nita Court, asbestos removal and
containment in Escondido Village

and better disability access.
The 10-year plan will upgrade
residences by selecting one large
dorm, several Row houses and
100-150 apartments each year to
renovate.
For example, 1992-1993 reno
vations will occur in Wilbur, Beta,
Storey, 553 Mayfleld, Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk and 150 Escondido Vil
lage apartments, and will include
structural repairs, furniture re
placement, roof repair, food ser
vice renovations and upgrades in
lighting and computer clusters.
Also, Escondido Village renova
tions will include removal and con
tainment of asbestos-containing
materials in the floor and ceilings
as well as more modern furniture
and appliances.
Plans for computer renovations
were based on input by resident
computer coordinators, and in
clude new clusters in Escondido
Village and the Row.
Also, as more students pur
chase personal computers of their
own, clusters may become smaller,
providing higher-end machines
and meeting more specific com
puting needs. In-room SUNet con
nections are also a goal, but the
cost and date of these renovations
are still uncertain.
The plan proposes to examine
the possibility of making all resi
dences accessible to people with
disabilities. Unfortunately, this
means only first-floor ramp ac
cess; elevators and lifts are not in
cluded in the current plan.
Some of the funding for the pro
ject will come from gifts and cost
cutting measures within Housing
and Food Services, but the majori
ty will come from loans to be re
paid in the next seven to 25 years.

However, the amount and type
of student input is still unclear,
and it is unlikely that students will
have a say in the renova
tions. Instead, they may help de
cide things such as paint color.
Although several students cited
"small dorm atmosphere" and lin
ear hallways as good things about
Wilbur, they also felt that renova
tions were long overdue.
"At this point, any change in
the Wilbur complex would be a
renovation," said Mike Duh, a for

Skaters stay away,
wary of fines
The threat of a $100 fine seems
to have deterred most skateboard

that prohibits skateboarding in
the central academic campus, po

Since the April 7 Santa Clara
County ruling, the number of

Capt. Marvin Moore.
Although he said limited class

for the decline in complaints.
The skateboarders disrupted
classes, damaged property and en

Doty, Stanford's director of com

According to Moore, until the
police finish posting signs stating
the restriction, officers respond

Moore said, but he added that offi

The threat of fines has discour

Stanford applies
for housing project
Stanford and Sand Hill Senior
Partners, a group of local in
vestors, submitted an application
Thursday to the city of Palo Alto
for a long-awaited housing project
on West Campus.
The project consists of 1,210
units to be built on University
owned land between Sand Hill
Road and San Francisquito
Creek.
According to Andrew Doty, di
rector of community relations at
Stanford, the application process
is only the first step in the pro
ject's planning, which is expected
to take about two to three more
years, if all goes as scheduled.
Doty said the project expects to
get a "positive response" from the
Palo Alto City Council, which
must approve the project before
construction can begin.
Stanford's plans for building
housing on the vacant lot have

failed once already. In 1983, Stan
ford aborted a plan to construct
1,100 units when the city of Palo
Alto approved the plan, but im
posed conditions on areas outside
its jursidiction that Stanford felt
were "unfair," Doty said.
But in the past few years, Doty
said, Stanford "has been under
pressure. . .from both the city and
the county to build more housing,"
so the city is unlikely to impose re
strictions this time.
But he said the project expects
substantial resistance from Menlo
Park residents who may oppose
the construction of a large-scale
housing project next to their
homes. However, a 16-acre archae
ological preserve along San Fran
cisquito Creek that will separate
the project from the residents
should placate the ; r concerns,
Doty said.
Included in the building plan
are 750 University-owned housing
units, most of which will be rented
to faculty and staff. Remaining
University-owned units will be
rented by a "tiered priority system
to others working on Stanford
land, such as those working at the
shopping center," Doty said.
These units, which have been in
the planning stage for three to
four years, will cost the University
more than $160 million, according
to Doty. The cost will eventually
be offset by rental revenue, which
will be the sole source of the pro
ject's income, Doty said.
Sand Hill Senior Partners will
build an adjacent retirement com

munity consisting of 460 condo
minium units. The group will
lease University land formerly oc
cupied by the Childrens' Hospital.
The Sand Hill Senior Partners
project will also include an Age
Center for gerontology and educa
tion to be utilized by researchers
at Stanford.
"Surveys in the Sociology De
partment and in the School of
Medicine have shown much inter
est in having a group of seniors
close by for study and interview
ing," Doty said.
When planning is complete,
construction of the units is expect
ed to last one year, according to
Doty.

Blomquist faces
arraignment today
Daniel Blomquist, an assistant
manager in the Controller's Of
fice, will face two charges of child
abuse today when he is arraigned
for subjecting his son to unjustifi
able pain and suffering and endan
gering the boy's life.
Blomquist, who was arrested
July 1, is held on $150,000 bail at
the Santa Clara County Jail.
Blomquist's wife, Ethel
Blomquist, was arrested July 2 in
conjunction with the incident. She
is free on $5,000 bond and awaits
arraignment July 20.
Cynthia Sevely, the prosecut
ing attorney for Santa Clara Coun
ty, called it a "slam dunk case."

With Daniel Blomquist's confes
sion and the condition of the vic
tim on file, Sevely said she does not
foresee any difficulty in prosecut
ing the defendants. Although a
plea of "not guilty" is expected at
the arraignment, she anticipates a
plea bargain before the case would
go to trial.
If convicted, Daniel Blomquist
could serve a nine-year prison
term. The maximum sentence
Ethel Blomquist could serve is six
years.
Religious beliefs motivated
Blomquist to beat his son, who
was "rebellious," Blomquist told
Campbell police. Each evening,
Steven, 10, was spanked severely
with a 14-inch wooden spoon, "be
cause that's what the Bible says to
do," Blomquist told police.
Steven, now listed in fair condi
tion at the Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital, has been
treated for malnutrition, kidney
failure, dehydration and jaundice
and is expected to recover.
Steven received daily food ra
tions of unprocessed milk, three
eggs and food supplements. He
was near death when paramedics
responded to a call made by one of
the Blomquists' other three chil
dren, ages 4, 15 and 18.
The Blomquists' 15-year-old
daughter and 4-year-old son are in
custody of the state pending fur
ther developments. The children
could be placed in foster care or re
turned to their parents if they are
released.

Auto burglary
attempt thwarted
Stanford Police arrested Jorge
Nunez Toledo of San Jose in con
nection with an attempted auto
burglary in the Alumni House
parking lot Tuesday afternoon.
Toledo was first spotted in the
Lagunita Court parking lot at
12:25 p.m. by Stanford employee
Luis Chavez, who was eating his
lunch outside near the lot, said
Sgt. Del Bandy.
Toledo was examining the in
side of each car in the parking lot
and was attempting to break into a
car with a "slim jim," a thin metal
bar usually used by tow truck dri
vers to force open car doors, Bandy
said. Toledo was also wearing
gloves at the time, he added.
After calling police, Chavez ap
proached Toledo and asked him to
show some identification. Toledo
pulled out his car registration
form, showed it to Chavez and then
drove off, according to Bandy.
Chavez identified the suspect for
police in the Alumni House parking
lot at 12:49 p.m., Bandy said.
Toledo was booked into North
County Jail and charged with at
tempted burglary. Bail was set at
$5,000. Bandy said he may also be
charged with possession of bur
glary tools.
Over the last three months,
Stanford Police have observed a
consistent rate of auto burglaries,
Bandy said.

Cowell to cut
pediatric services
Beginning Aug. 1, graduate stu
dents will no longer be able to
bring their children to Cowell Stu
dent Health Center to receive
medical attention.
Cowell administrators decided
last Thursday to discontinue the
center's pediatric services. But a
plan to relocate affordable pedi
atric care to facilities on Welch
Road is currently in the works, ac
cording to John Dorman, Cowell's
director of public relations.
Parents expressed disappoint
ment and anger at the plans to
close Cowell's pediatric services.
"I was in disbelief," said Escondi
do Village resident Carolina
Montes, who has been taking her
three-year-old son to Cowell since
last year.
The Medical School's Faculty
Practice Program (FPP), which
currently provides pediatric ser
vices at Cowell, announced earlier
last week that it would reduce its
hours next year to only about 10
per week because there have not
been enough patients to sustain
the program financially.
Instead of accepting the cut
back in pediatric hours, which
would cripple Cowell's ability to
provide adequate care on demand
for its younger patients, Cowell
administrators opted to dissolve
its pediatric services completely.
"It is not in the best interests of
the student family population for
us to try to provide quality pedi
atric services on such a limited
basis," Dorman wrote in a draft of
a letter which will be sent to par
ents of all pediatric patients at
Cowell.
In previous years, physicians
from the Palo Alto Medical Clinic
provided pediatric care at Cowell.
But when the Medical School took
over last fall, many parents of
Cowell pediatric patients followed
their children's physicians back to
the Palo Alto clinic, decreasing the
number of patients dramatically.
Parents learned about Cowell's
possible termination of its pedi
atric services in mid-June and
were advised to find alternative
pediatric care for their children for
the next school year, Montes said.
In response, more than 90 par
ents sent petitions and letters to
Cowell in late June, urging its ad
ministrators to maintain its pedi
atric services.
Parents are now meeting with
each other to discuss the Cowell
plans. Many said they are also
planning to hold a "town meeting"
in the next few days to voice their
concerns to physicians and Cowell
administrators.
"Our main objective is to keep it
open," said Teresa Clement,
mother of a ten-month old son.
She said she is waiting for fur
ther information about the advan
tages of the Welch Road clinic,
compared to other area clinics be
fore she decides to transfer her
son's pediatric care there.
Since January, FPP had been
looking for more efficient alterna
tives for the student families, said
its Medical director, Peter Grego
ry.
While an average pediatrician
receives about 3,500-4,500 visits
per year, Cowell's pediatric service
receives about 800-900, according
to Gregory.
"We've known all year that we
needed to see more patients," said
pediatric nurse Mitzi Van Sant,
adding that a plan to attract more
graduate students to Cowell has
been "put on hold" by the recent
developments.
The Welch Road pediatric
group, which already serves many
student, families, is likely to up
grade current pediatric care by
providing more comprehensive
care seven days a week, Gregory
said. And patients will be able to
choose their physician from six
full-time board-certified pediatri
cians. Cowell currently offers one

half-time family practice physi
cian.
Gregory added that the costs
for parents will probably not differ
dramatically from the Cowell ser
vices, although Cowell's low im
munization fees will not be main
tained at the new location.
Cowell's pediatric care provides
substantial savings for low-in
come graduate students. For ex
ample, it offers a 15 percent dis
count over Stanford Clinic prices,
which are similar to those of other
local clinics, Van Sant said.
Also, because vaccines are pro
vided by the county, Cowell only
charges an administration fee of
$5.88 for each shot. Other clinics
charge between $35 and $45 each,
according to Van Sant.
And many graduate students
said they are worried that the
Welch Road location, if approved,
may prove to be more inconve
nient for them. While there is a
Marguerite shuttle that goes from
Escondido Village to Welch Road,
Cowell is within walking distance,
Montes said.
"It's so convenient for us,"
Clement said, adding that "it's
nice to know that you can walk
there — especially if you have a
sick baby."
Van Sant also said she was con
cerned about the attention many
international students would re
ceive "if they're set out into the
community where offices are a lot
bigger."
"It takes a lot of time with the
students in terms of bridging that
language barrier," she said,
adding that about half of Cowell's
pediatric patients are internation
al student families.
Montes expressed frustration
that many decisions were made
about Cowell pediatrics without
consulting the parents. "We're on
the tail-end" of the process, she
said. She added that because many
students are away during the sum
mer, there is a "smaller base" of
affected parents to oppose the
changes.
Gregory said FPP has been
working with Cowell so far, and
has not contacted the parents. But
they "would be delighted to talk
with parents," he said. "We really
do have the students' best inter
ests at heart."

Betas can't fill
house, lose it
More than 25 men who had
planned to live in the Beta Theta
Pi fraternity next year were forced
to change their plans late last
month when the University told
them that the fraternity will lose
its house for at least the next year

because members failed to attract
enough people to fill it.
The fraternity will become a co
ed, University-operated house
next year, open to students on the
waiting list. The 26 men slated to
live in the 38-bed house will be
guaranteed housing through the
waiting list, officials said.
"The University needs to re
ceive that revenue," said Janyce
Prothro, assistant director of the
Row. "Whether the University
was in a budget crunch or not, the
concern is we've got a house left
(partially) empty."
Despite the late notice, losing
the house "wasn't completely out
of the blue," said Beta President
Kurt Hurtado from his home in
Texas. He said members and new
pledges had realized before Rush
that the fraternity might have
trouble filling the house.
Although the Betas had a
strong Rush this year — attract
ing nine new pledges, after attract
ing only one last year — the hous
ing glut on campus prevented the
fraternity from recruiting enough
boarders to fill the remainder of
the house, Hurtado said. And a
number of upperclassmen have
left the fraternity early, creating a
"huge gap" in its membership, he
said.
Hurtado said fraternity mem
bers are "optimistic" that they will
be able to restructure the fraterni
ty during the next year and re
claim the house. Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Heather Dunn said she
plans to help reorganize the
"loosely structured" Betas next
year, and added that they "have a
really good chance" to return to
the house if the restructuring ef
fort is successful.
The fraternity has an agree
ment with the University that it
can reclaim the house when it re
cruits enough members to fill the
house to about three-quarters of
its capacity, Hurtado said.
The first step in the reorganiza
tion, he said, will be to reaffiliate
with the national chapter of Beta
Theta Pi, which dropped the Stan
ford fraternity two years ago. Hur
tado said he has already met with
national Beta representatives, and
added that they are receptive to
the idea of reaffiliating.
The fraternity must also build a
better structure by appointing
more officers to run different
functions, Hurtado said. The
house "was run basically like a
self-op the last few years, like any
other Row house," he said. "There
were not enough people to do the
jobs that fraternities require. Now
we have people interested in doing
those jobs."
Hurtado said the Betas also plan
more frequent activities during the
next year. "We're hoping to use this

as a chance to show that we're not
just a group of guys who live togeth
er, but rather a fraternity that can
survive with or without a house,"
he said. This year's pledge class, he
added, "still seems excited."
The decision to remove the
Betas from their house was made
June 12, when a group of "four or
five officers" met with Prothro
and told her they would not be able
to fill the house, Prothro said. The
Office of Residential Education,
she said, "felt there was no other
option" but to convert the frater
nity into a University-operated
house.
In letters dated June 28, Beta
members were sent Draw books
and "invited to enter the waiting
list," Prothro said.

ford aborted a plan to construct
1,100 units when the city of Palo
Alto approved the plan, but im
posed conditions on areas outside
its jursidiction that Stanford felt
were "unfair," Doty said.
But in the past few years, Doty
said, Stanford "has been under
pressure. . .from both the city and
the county to build more housing,"
so the city is unlikely to impose re
strictions this time.
But he said the project expects
substantial resistance from Menlo
Park residents who may oppose
the construction of a large-scale
housing project next to their
homes. However, a 16-acre archae
ological preserve along San Fran
cisquito Creek that will separate
the project from the residents
should placate the ; r concerns,
Doty said.
Included in the building plan
are 750 University-owned housing
units, most of which will be rented
to faculty and staff. Remaining
University-owned units will be
rented by a "tiered priority system
to others working on Stanford
land, such as those working at the
shopping center," Doty said.
These units, which have been in
the planning stage for three to
four years, will cost the University
more than $160 million, according
to Doty. The cost will eventually
be offset by rental revenue, which
will be the sole source of the pro
ject's income, Doty said.
Sand Hill Senior Partners will
build an adjacent retirement com

munity consisting of 460 condo
minium units. The group will
lease University land formerly oc
cupied by the Childrens' Hospital.
The Sand Hill Senior Partners
project will also include an Age
Center for gerontology and educa
tion to be utilized by researchers
at Stanford.
"Surveys in the Sociology De
partment and in the School of
Medicine have shown much inter
est in having a group of seniors
close by for study and interview
ing," Doty said.
When planning is complete,
construction of the units is expect
ed to last one year, according to
Doty.

Blomquist faces
arraignment today
Daniel Blomquist, an assistant
manager in the Controller's Of
fice, will face two charges of child
abuse today when he is arraigned
for subjecting his son to unjustifi
able pain and suffering and endan
gering the boy's life.
Blomquist, who was arrested
July 1, is held on $150,000 bail at
the Santa Clara County Jail.
Blomquist's wife, Ethel
Blomquist, was arrested July 2 in
conjunction with the incident. She
is free on $5,000 bond and awaits
arraignment July 20.
Cynthia Sevely, the prosecut
ing attorney for Santa Clara Coun
ty, called it a "slam dunk case."

With Daniel Blomquist's confes
sion and the condition of the vic
tim on file, Sevely said she does not
foresee any difficulty in prosecut
ing the defendants. Although a
plea of "not guilty" is expected at
the arraignment, she anticipates a
plea bargain before the case would
go to trial.
If convicted, Daniel Blomquist
could serve a nine-year prison
term. The maximum sentence
Ethel Blomquist could serve is six
years.
Religious beliefs motivated
Blomquist to beat his son, who
was "rebellious," Blomquist told
Campbell police. Each evening,
Steven, 10, was spanked severely
with a 14-inch wooden spoon, "be
cause that's what the Bible says to
do," Blomquist told police.
Steven, now listed in fair condi
tion at the Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital, has been
treated for malnutrition, kidney
failure, dehydration and jaundice
and is expected to recover.
Steven received daily food ra
tions of unprocessed milk, three
eggs and food supplements. He
was near death when paramedics
responded to a call made by one of
the Blomquists' other three chil
dren, ages 4, 15 and 18.
The Blomquists' 15-year-old
daughter and 4-year-old son are in
custody of the state pending fur
ther developments. The children
could be placed in foster care or re
turned to their parents if they are
released.

Auto burglary
attempt thwarted
Stanford Police arrested Jorge
Nunez Toledo of San Jose in con
nection with an attempted auto
burglary in the Alumni House
parking lot Tuesday afternoon.
Toledo was first spotted in the
Lagunita Court parking lot at
12:25 p.m. by Stanford employee
Luis Chavez, who was eating his
lunch outside near the lot, said
Sgt. Del Bandy.
Toledo was examining the in
side of each car in the parking lot
and was attempting to break into a
car with a "slim jim," a thin metal
bar usually used by tow truck dri
vers to force open car doors, Bandy
said. Toledo was also wearing
gloves at the time, he added.
After calling police, Chavez ap
proached Toledo and asked him to
show some identification. Toledo
pulled out his car registration
form, showed it to Chavez and then
drove off, according to Bandy.
Chavez identified the suspect for
police in the Alumni House parking
lot at 12:49 p.m., Bandy said.
Toledo was booked into North
County Jail and charged with at
tempted burglary. Bail was set at
$5,000. Bandy said he may also be
charged with possession of bur
glary tools.
Over the last three months,
Stanford Police have observed a
consistent rate of auto burglaries,
Bandy said.
