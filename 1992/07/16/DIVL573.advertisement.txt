The Voice of the Earth
Published by Simon and Schuster
"Ozone depletion, toxic waste, the greenhouse effect and other environmental
problems have become the psychopathology of our everyday life," says Theodore
Roszak. "The epidemic psychosis of our time is the lie of believing we have no ethical
obligation to our planetary home." In his latest book, The Voice of the Earth. Roszak
attempts to bridge the gulf between the psychological and the ecological, to see the
needs of the planet and the person as a continuum.
"The Voice of the Earth is a bold work, nothing less than a psychoanalysis of civilization, one
that looks at the psychological underpinnings of our ecological crisis. Roszak is trying to do for
our relationship with the earth what Freud did for our relationships with each other."
