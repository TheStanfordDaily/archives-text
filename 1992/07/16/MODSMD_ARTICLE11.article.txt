## Domestic partner benefits proposed 
### 
Domestic partners of Universi
ty employees should receive the
same benefits currently available
to husbands and wives of employ
ees, a Faculty Senate subcommit
tee recommended in a report.
The report advises that domes
tic partners be eligible for medical
and dental coverage, athletic and
library privileges, the tuition
grant program, and all other bene
fits now offered to spouses of em
ployees, said Law Prof. Barbara
Fried, chair of the Faculty Senate
Subcommittee on Domestic Part
ners' Benefits.
The subcommittee's report,
which was presented to the Uni
versity Committee on Faculty and
Staff Benefits last month, now
awaits approval from the full sen
ate in the fall.
University President Donald
Kennedy has also received a copy
of the report. But it remains un
clear who will need to approve the
recommendations — Kennedy or
incoming President Gerhard
Casper — or what involvement
the Board of Trustees will have in
the final outcome, according to
members of the subcommittee.
Domestic partners of students
were granted spousal benefits in
October 1990.
The issue of benefits for domes
tic partners of employees began in
the spring of 1991 when Gynecolo
gy Asst. Prof. Kate O'Hanlan in
troduced a proposal to the senate
requesting that the administra
tion extend the benefits.
The senate asked Kennedy to
appoint the subcommittee to ex
amine the implications of the bill.
The University defines domes
tic partnership as "two individuals
who live together in an intimate,
long-term relationship of indefi
nite duration, with an exclusive
mutual commitment similar to
that of marriage."
The subcommittee applied a de
finition of domestic partners that
was "similar, but not identical" to
this one, which is currently used
for students, the report said.
Because many of the benefits
are financial, the subcommittee
also required that domestic part
ners "agree to be financially re
sponsible for each others' debts,"
the report said.
Several factors, including the
"ethical, administrative, legal, and
cost implications of extending cov
erage" were considered in the sub
committee's decision, according to
the report.
Members of the subcommittee
"talked at length" about these is
sues, and also researched other
companies' policies on domestic
partners' benefits, Fried said.
While the subcommittee rec
ommended offering spousal privi
leges to both same-sex and oppo
site-sex partners, it stated that if
cost considerations limit the rec
ommendations, priority for receiv
ing the benefits should be granted
to gays and lesbians, who have no
legal option to marry.
Benefits for heterosexual part
ners would be reconsidered at a
later date if this were the case.
The subcommittee concluded
that the University's "core case"
for extending benefits to domestic
partners rested on its "express pol
icy barring discrimination in em
ployment ... on the basis of sexu
al orientation or marital status,"
the report said.
The subcommittee also found
that the financial costs of extend
ing the benefits were estimated to
be "relatively small, given the over
all benefits budget," according to
the report.
The potential damaging effects
on alumni relations were also con
sidered by the subcommittee. But
Fried said, "Fairness considerations
ultimately outweighed the possibly
negative (alumni] reactions."
The decision to offer students a
comprehensive domestic partners

policy in 1990 was met with criti
cism from some students and
many alumni.
But with the new policy, Stanford
became the first university in the na
tion to offer students a comprehen
sive domestic partners policy.
Based on the University's past
experience, the subcommittee rec
ognized in the report that, if
passed, the bill "would be unpopu
lar with at least a vocal minority of
alumni/ae." •
Benefits manager Jim
Franklin, also a member of the
subcommittee, said there was "no
way of knowing" the exact number
of employees the recommendation
could affect.
However, regarding medical
coverage, the subcommittee esti
mated that between 40 to 60 em
ployees would enroll as same-sex
domestic partners, and between
90 and 135 employees would enroll
as opposite-sex domestic partners.
The numbers could vary for
other benefits, the report said.
