# Fetter selected as Casper's assistant

### 
Searching for someone with the
"wide Stanford experience" that
he lacks, incoming University
President Gerhard Casper an
nounced this week that he has
named former dean of undergrad
uate admissions Jean Fetter as his
assistant.
The popular Fetter, who has
held administrative positions at
Stanford since 1975, will begin her
new job Sept. 1, the same day
Casper takes over as president.
"The variety of experience Ms.
Fetter has is obviously a tremen
dous attraction for me because I
will still have to learn about the
Stanford institution, Stanford
people and Stanford problems,"
Casper said.
Fetter, has been on sabbatical
for the past year, but served as ex
ecutive vice chair of the search

committee that
selected Casper
to be Stanford's
ninth president.
Fetter's expe
rience on the
search committee
was a factor in his
decision, v Jasper
said. During the
process of evalu-

ating candidates, the search com
mittee "first of all tried to find out
what bugs people," which means
Fetter is familiar with the con
cerns of people in most areas of the
University, he said.
Fetter, who has been writing a
book on undergraduate admis
sions during her leave, said she is
looking forward to her new job, al
though her exact responsibilities
have not yet been defined.
"From my perspective, the way
I can be most helpful is in the fact
that I have had wide-ranging expe
rience in the administration at
Stanford, both with undergradu
ate and graduate students," Fetter
said. "I've been here since 1975,
and it's very difficult for someone
coming from a different institu
tion to have an instantaneous his
torical knowledge of Stanford."
She added that she considers
the job "a wonderful opportunity"
for her "to continue working at
Stanford, the place I love, in what
I know is going to be an enormous
ly challenging position."
Fetter received a doctorate in
solar physics from St. Hugh's Col
lege of Oxford University in 1962,
and was a physics lecturer and as
sistant professor at San Jose State
University between 1966 and 1974.
Casper said he is "pleased" that
Fetter has a background in the nat
ural sciences. "Remember, I'm
only a lawyer," he said, adding that
"any kind of help as problems come
across my desk" in fields such as
engineering and the natural sci
ences "will be most welcome." Dur
ing the 1980s, Casper served as

provost and dean of the law school
at the University of Chicago.
Casper said he selected Fetter
from among a group of Stanford
candidates who had been suggest
ed to him. He examined only Stan
ford candidates, he said, because
"I needed someone with inside
Stanford experience."
Fetter served as assistant to the
president once before, from 1977
until the end of Richard Lyman's
presidency. When Donald Kennedy
succeeded Lyman in 1980, she be
came associate dean of graduate
studies and research.
In 1984, Fetter was appointed
dean of undergraduate admis
sions, and became affectionately
known as "Dean Jean" to the stu
dents she admitted.
Fetter expects the transition to
a Casper presidency to be "a very
exciting time for Stanford." One of
the most intriguing elements of
the transition, she said, "is that
people bring new ideas. It's the in
fusion of new ideas and change
that makes Stanford tick."
