# 35 Rodins donated to museum
## 
### 
B. Gerald Cantor, an invest
ment banker and art collector, and
his wife, Iris, have donated 35
works by sculptor Auguste Rodin
to the Stanford University Muse
um of Art.
Along with the Rodin bronzes and
plasters, seven sculptures by other
19th-century artists such as Jacob
Ebstein and A Jules Dalou were in
cluded as part of the gift, which was
appraised at $11.6 million.
The gift includes important
works that were until now on loan
to the University, such as "The
Gates of Hell" and"The Burghers
of Calais." Among the works that
are new to the University, one of
the most important is the life-size
work "The Three Shades," which
will be installed in the B. Gerald
Cantor Rodin Sculpture Garden
adjacent to the museum.
However, the piece will proba
bly not be installed for a few years,
because the sculpture is currently
on loan to the Los Angeles County
Museum, said Stanford Museum
Director Thomas Seligman.
Installation of other works from

the gift may be delayed until the
Stanford Museum, damaged in the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, re
opens in 1996. Until then, several
pieces will be on loan to the Uni
versity of Oregon Museum of Art
and the San Jose Museum of Art.
The gift will "undoubtedly
broaden the scope of learning and
research that goes on with Rodin
art and sculpture," Seligman said.
"More specifically," he added, "it
will draw more art lovers and
members of the community who
are interested modern sculpture."
Since the early 1980s, the Can
tors have donated a total of 187
Rodins to the museum, as well as
seven other 19th-century bronzes.
According to Seligman, Can
tor's gifts and loans to Stanford
were influenced by his friendship
with Art Prof. Albert Elsen. Al
though Cantor has no formal asso
ciation with Stanford, he was con
vinced by Elsen that the donation
and loan of his Rodins would "en
rich student and community life at
Stanford," Seligman said.
A Rodin scholar, Elsen also
originally conceived the idea of the
Rodin Sculpture Garden, which
opened in 1985.
Elsen recently returned from
Paris, where he was researching
and cataloging the Stanford Rodin
collection.
As a result of gifts from the
Cantors, Stanford currently holds
the second largest collection of
Rodin sculpture in the world. The
largest collection is in Paris.
