# Prof, to head Swedish schools
## 
### 
Stig Hagstrom, director of
Stanford's Center for Materials
Research, will leave the University
to become the head of the Swedish
university system Oct. 1.
Hagstrom, a tenured professor
of materials science engineering at
Stanford since 1986, will return to
his native country in a few weeks
to prepare for his six-year appoint
ment as chancellor of Sweden's 37
colleges and universities.
He said he plans to return to
Stanford at the end of his term.
"It's an exciting task,"
Hagstrom said, explaining his goal
is to recruit more students and im

prove the existing schools.
Hagstrom described the
Swedish system as a series of "pro
fessional schools." Among them is
the Karolinska Institute — the
medical school that decides the
Nobel Prize in medicine.
Although the system includes
schools for opera, theater and
journalism, each is specialized and
none provide what has become
known as a "liberal education."
Hagstrom said he hopes to offer
Swedish students "new opportu
nities."
Broadening the focus of Swe
den's system and providing a more
liberal education are also on his
list of goals, Hagstrom said.
He said he hopes the new struc
ture will attract more students,
doubling the attendance in five to
10 years. Currently 20 to 30 percent
of Sweden's students continue their
studies through the universities.
Sweden'B system had been sim
ilar to the University of California
system of five years ago, Hagstrom
explained. Students would apply
to a central agency and be assigned
to a school.
Since the socialist government
was voted out of power last year,
the system has been decentralized.
Potential graduate students
still apply directly to professors,
but Hagstrom said he prefers the
American system of applying to a
graduate school and then seeking
an adviser upon acceptance.
Attempts to "Americanize" the
system will improve competition and
therefore the quality of students, he
said, noting that the top U.S. gradu
ate schools are the best in the world.
Hagstrom said another aim is to
improve Sweden's international
academic networks since communi
cation and information sharing is
vital to scientific progress. Although
good links to the United States exist,
better connections need to be estab
lished within Europe, he said.
Hagstrom said he also plans to
schedule a leave of absence from his
new position in order to continue
advising his graduate students and
remain their thesis advisor. He said
his colleagues at Stanford would
manage them on a daily basis.
Hagstrom expects some of his
students to perform post-doctoral
work in Sweden.
