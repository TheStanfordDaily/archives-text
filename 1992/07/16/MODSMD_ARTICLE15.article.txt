# Clinton has the plan, Arrow says

### 
Economics Prof. Kenneth
Arrow is among a group of six
Nobel Prize-winning economists
who have endorsed Democratic
presidential candidate Bill Clin
ton's economic plan.
"The Clinton plan recognizes a
number of basic aspects that need
fixing in the economy," Arrow said.
The plan particularly addresses
the need for more infrastructure,
he said. "There are all sorts of rea
sons to believe that economic
growth has been retarded by the
lack of an adequate infrastruc
ture," said Arrow, who won the
Nobel Prize in 1972.
The core of the plan, unveiled
June 21, is to spend $200 billion
over four years on public invest
ment: building high-speed rail
roads and a national computer net
work, and improving education and
job training. The program, Clinton
claims, would increase productivity
and spur growth.
But Republicans, including
Vice President Dan Quayle, have
criticized the proposal, saying that
it does little to curb deficit spend
ing and overestimates the amount
of growth it would create.
The proposal "takes a bad prob
lem and it's probably going to
make it worse if [Clinton] is elect
ed," said Hoover Institution se
nior fellow Martin Anderson, who
had been Ronald Reagan's chief
domestic policy adviser. "Other
than that, it's pretty good."
"The question I'd ask," Ander
son added, "is of all the years I've
known Kenneth Arrow, I can't
think of a year when he hasn't en-

dorsed the Demo
cratic candidate's
economic propos
al. I think if Jesse
Jackson had an
economic propos
al, he'd endorse
that."
But Arrow
said, "I'm not
going to deny that

I'm a Democrat." He added that he
has "certainly criticized Democra
tic proposals in the past."
The plan contains a number of

benefits for the economy besides
boosting the infrastructure,
Arrow said. "Clinton's plan also
looks to the longer run of the econ
omy, and the fact that the growing
inequality in income really has the
effect of impoverishing us — not
just the poor, all of us," he said.
Responding to Republican criti
cism that the plan does too little to
reduce the deficit, Arrow said it
recognizes that "the level of taxa
tion does have to be increased."
"Past and present administra
tions have succeeded in keeping
taxes low only by unbridled deficit
spending," Arrow said. "The spend
thrift Republicans have run up
huge deficits, not the Democrats."
The others who endorsed the

plan, and the years in which they
won the Nobel Prize, are:
Lawrence Klein of the University
of Pennsylvania (1980), Franco
Modigliani of MIT (1985), Paul
Samuelson of MIT (1970), Robert
M. Solow of MIT (1987) and James
Tobin of Yale University (1981).
