University officials from the
West coast, including Stanford ad
ministrators, acknowledged yester
day that their research partnerships
with the federal government have
been strained by the indirect cost
scandal, but said the alliances are
still a vital investment in the future.
Administrators told the Presi
dent's Council of Advisors on Sci
ence and Technology that they're
trying to give a better accounting
of where the money is going. But
they said the government can do
its part by simplifying the bureau
cratic process.
The hearing at the University
of California at Berkeley was one
in a series the council is holding
nationwide to improve relation
ships between government and
universities.
Trouble in the multibillion-dol
lar partnerships surfaced in the
past year as federal auditors dis
closed that Stanford and a number
of other major universities over
charged the government millions
of dollars in research money.
"This partnership is based on
mutual trust, and that trust has
been strained," said Thomas Ever
hart, president of the California
Institute of Technology. "When
universities charge items to the
federal government that the public
thinks improper, trust is reduced."
Schools across the country
came under scrutiny after federal
auditors alleged that Stanford
overcharged more than $240 mil
lion from 1981 through 1988.

Stanford has paid back about
$2 million, including money for
maintenance of a 72-foot yacht,
but denies widespread overbilling.
Dean of Research Robert Byer,
addressing the panel, joked that
"those of us on Stanford's campus
in the last few years who have been
in administration have been walk
ing around with a large bullet tar
get on our chest."
has revamped its ac
counting practices and Byer said
the government also needs to
make some changes to simplify its
system of reimbursing indirect re
search costs so that the public and
elected officials can understand it.
Everhart said a number of fac
tors have damaged relations be
tween universities and govern
ment, including a loss of "can-do"
spirit and shrinking federal dollars.
UC-Berkeley Chancellor Chang
Lin-Tien said filling out grant
forms has turned into a full-time
job for faculty, taking away re
search and teaching time.
In addition to making the
process simpler, the chancellor
said government must become
more efficient at picking projects
now that money is tight.
"Tough decisions lie ahead," he
said. "How we respond.. .will rever
berate long into the new century."
