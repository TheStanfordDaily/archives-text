•Ideologically, there are few
groups further apart than the
Hoover Institution and the Socialist
Workers Party of the United States.
But now these organizations are
sharing a common interest — the
preservation of socialist literature.
Directors of Hoover's archives
announced on Tuesday the acqui
sition of original manuscripts and
letters written by Leon Trotsky,
including drafts of his biographies
of Lenin and Stalin, from the So
cialist Workers.
In addition, the Socialist party
has given the Institution many

documents detailing its activities
and involvement with Trotskyist
parties around the world.
"The materials from the Social
ist Workers Party, together with
those already held, make the
Hoover Archives and Library one
of the world's premier repositories
of holdings on the history of the In
ternational Trotskyist movement
from the 1920s to the present day,"
said archivist Anne Van Camp.
•Medical School Profs. Paul Berg
and Luigi Cavalli-Sforza have been
elected foreign members of Britain's
Royal Society for their "outstanding
service to science and the scientific
community." Only five foreign
scholars were chosen to join the
prestigious society this year.
Berg, professor of biochemistry,
was cited for "contributing the key
discoveries that started genetic en
gineering." He won the Nobel
Prize in chemistry in 1980, and
was the first person to construct a
recombinant DNA molecule. He
has also been credited for address
ing the ethical concerns posed by
DNA recombination technology.
Cavalli-Sforza, professor of ge
netics, was noted for his "system
atic models of human population
genetics, taking into account de
mographic factors, especially mat
ing structure of populations and
effects of inbreeding." He is cur
rently involved in a project to map
human genetic diversity by collect
ing DNA samples from up to 500
indigenous populations.
•Ted Mitchell, deputy to the
president and provost for the past
year, has been appointed dean of
the Graduate School of Education
at the University of California at
Los Angeles.
Mitchell, a Stanford graduate
and former trustee, took a leave of
absence from his position as chair of
Dartmouth College's school of edu
cation last year to assist the Univer
sity in its presidential transition
and act as a mediator between ad
ministrators, faculty and students
in the budget-cutting process.
