THEIR SUMMER FELLOWSHIPTO
TEACH CHILDREN IN SAN FRAN
CISCO'S MISSION DISTRICT RE
SPECT FOR PEOPLE, NATURE AND
THEMSELVES

A tropical rain forest flour
ishes in the asphalt jungle
of San Francisco — as
paper frogs, origami birds and the
pre-recorded sounds of wildlife
and rushing waters invade the
confines of Studio 3C in the Mis
sion Cultural Center.
This scene, created by a rain
forest mural and an accompany
ing cassette tape, are only part of a
multi-faceted approach two Stan
ford seniors are taking to educate
young students about the envi
ronment this summer.
Seniors Carlos Pineda and Max
Barnett each received a Haas Pub
lic Service Summer Fellowship for
their proposal to conduct classes
specifically geared toward increas
ing environmental awareness.
Together, they teach five class
es a week, each class consisting of
about seven middle school stu
dents. The class is taught at the
Mission Cultural Center, an orga
nization that promotes the study
of art and its relationship to cul
ture, located in San Francisco's
primarily Latino Mission district.
It is offered through the cen
ter's Multicultural Arts Summer
Program, a new program in the
San Francisco Unified School Dis
trict that focuses on improving
academic skills and interpersonal
relations through different cul
tural art forms.
"The basis for the whole pro
gram is respect," said Juan Carlos
Cuellar, director of education at
the center. "In the classes

[students are] taught to

respect people, the envi
ronment and them

selves."
Coming from urban
neighborhoods, many
of their students may

grow up feeling de
tached from nature,

which tends to be "put on a distant
level" for students living in the
city, Barnett said.
He said he hopes that, after
completing the class, "the kids
don't see the environment as
something that has to be outside
of their lives."
On some streets in the city, the
color green is more likely to be
found as grafitti scrawled on

building walls than as grass or
shrubbery. And the few palm trees
that line Army Street awkwardly
jut out of cement sidewalks.
While they are not aiming to
convert their students into bud
ding environmental activists,
Pineda said he and Barnett would
like to inspire in their students a
"positive outlook on the environ
ment."
Through the class, Pineda and
Barnett said they would like to
help their students find beauty in
their immediate environment as
well as "in the woods."
"I don't want these kids to
come away with the impression
that you have to drive four hours
to Yosemite to find nature," Pine
da said.
As students are beckoned to
class by the hypnotic rain
forest music that whistles
from two tiny speakers in the far
corner of the room, Pineda and
Barnett quickly review their "na
ture names," which are playfully
affiliated with different elements
or species found in nature. Pine
da's nature name is "Carlos
Cougar" and Barnett's is "Max
Mountain." One student's nature
name is "Israel Iguana."
After briefly discussing the dif
ferent qualities of rain forests,
students continue their mural
project, brainstorming more rain
forest-related species to cut and

paste onto the quickly fill
ing mural space: moss,
smaller trees for the back
ground, and many more
leaves.
A previous class project
— a cardboard box turned
into a recycling bin - stands

in one corner of the room,

waiting for students to feed it
scraps of paper from accidentally

mutilated leaves or paper frogs.

"Israel Iguana" eagerly flips
through the pages of a rain forest
calendar for ideas of what to cut
out next. Other students hover
around him or peer over at the
rain forest poster on the wall be
hind them.
When completed, the mural
will serve as the backdrop for a
play to be performed by the

students. The play will be orga
nized with cooperative efforts
from other art-oriented classes of
fered through the summer school
such as improvisational drama
and creative writing.
While it was not chosen specifi
cally for its environmental rele
vance, Pineda said the play
nonetheless contains a message of
significant ecological importance.
Based on a Nicaraguan folk leg-

end from the Miskito

Indian tribe, the

play is about three
hunters who find
a magic vine that
helps them hunt
for food on the
condition that
they don't abuse
their privileges by

exploiting the ani-

mals. The hunters

are subsequently cursed
by the vine when they begin sell
ing the meat and not giving any to
the village people.
The classes in the Summer Pro
gram, including Pineda and Bar
nett's, are taught through a
method developed at Stanford
called "complex instruction" in
which a cooperative rather than
competitive atmosphere is fos
tered among students, explained
Cuellar.
"It's a very human way of in
teracting," Cuellar said. "That's
why [complex instruction] is per
fect for dealing with the environ
ment."
Cuellar also emphasized that
with complex instruction's em
phasis on group interaction, stu
dents become more aware of their
actions — which then spills over
into creating a more positive rela
tionship with their environment.
Pineda and Barnett's original
plan for their class combined their
interests in the environment and
experiences working as bilingual
teachers' assistants in
Ravens wood classrooms during
the school year.
To complement the other class
es in the arts summer school,
Cuellar helped them "weave [the
topic of environmental issues]
into an integrated curriculum"
that used

art as a primary way of learning,
Pineda said.
Both facilitators agreed that
the artistic aspect improves the ef
fectiveness of their classes. "Using
art to express social concerns is an
incredible tool," Bamett said.
Pineda added that the art-re
lated activities "make [summer
classes] a little more enjoyable for
the kids."
Despite the wonders of art,

however, both student fa-

cilitators wish their
classes could spend
more time on outdoor
fieldtrips — for more
hands-on interaction
with the the environ
ment.

Currently, they

conduct "urban art"
classes in the afternoons,

in which they take students

on city tours to go to parks, view

murals or visit other sites of inter
est.

As the students industri
ously paint their additions
to the mural, Pineda
briefly interrupts, advising them
to curb their paint usage — which
was slightly reckless on the previ
ous day, he reminds them — by di
luting the potent drops of color in
a spoonful or so of water.
Even the less noticeable con
servational practices such as mon
itoring paint use make it into their
class.
But while Pineda and Barnett
express enthusiasm about the en-

vironment and fear its incipi
ent decline, both admit they

are not out-of-the-ordi
nary environmental fa-

natics.
"I'm not an envi
ronmental buddha,"

said Pineda, who
rides bikes or
takes buses
whenever possi-

ble, eats meat occa
sionally and recycles.

With the planet's dubious envi
ronmental situation, he said
"everybody should be doing these
things."

This behavior, Bamett added,
should not be anything "abnor

mal."
For Pineda and Barnett, envi
ronmental consciousness need not
be a distant concept designated
only for barefooted earth children
who subsist on diets of tofu and
sprouts and take fewer showers
than sanitaiy in order to conserve
water.
Through their classes, they
carry the message that ecological
awareness is within everyone's
reach.
While a class devoted solely to
environmental issues seems
somewhat atypical for the usual
public school curriculum, it is one
that should gain greater atten
tion, according to both classroom
facilitators.
Students are usually "very
poorly taught" about environ
mental systems, if they are taught
at all, said Pineda. He added that
students usually learn in school
about eco-systems in which hu
mans are placed at the "top of the
chain." This mentality may prove
problematic in developing an un
derstanding of the complete eco
logical picture with all of the other
organisms in the chain, Pineda
said.
"Environmental education in
the urban setting is really neglect
ed," Barnett said, adding that the
lack of rich forestry in the city
should not be used as an excuse for
not teaching students about the
natural environment.
But with a growing sense of
global ecological awareness, Pine
da said, "I think we're going to see
environmental education as more

of a common thing."
Pineda, who will go to
Costa Rica later this sum
mer to do research on con-

servation and development,
admitted that global changes
are inevitable, and said "most

of those changes are going to
be detrimental for natural sys-

tems. " But efforts can be made to
"try to make those changes as pos
itive as possible," he said.
"I don't think life is going to
disappear on this planet," Pineda
added. But he said that if the cur
rent environmental situation con
tinues to go unchecked, the world
"will be a very different place."



Bnan Bedell — Daily
Senior Carlos Pineda suggests other additions for the rain forest mural in the background at a morning
class last Tuesday. Pineda is one of two instructors teaching an environmental awareness class this sum
mer for children from San Francisco's Mission District.
