# FIRE SCARS FOOTHILLS
## Firefighters contain blaze, yet danger still lurks in hills 
### Ragiv Chandrasekaran Peter Robison Editorial staff 
The brushfire that swept across Stanford's
Foothills last week, blackening more
than 500 acres and sending thick, dark
clouds of smoke into the air over campus,
frightened many who were reminded of the
Oakland hills fire that destroyed 600 homes
and caused $1.5 billion worth of damage last
year.
But this fire was quickly contained by the re
sponse of more than 100 local firefighters, and
much of its fury was caused by the firefighters
themselves, who lit fires in front of it to use up
the dry brush and other fuel that could have fed
the flames.
Nevertheless, firefighters say the Foothills
blaze could have been worse; it signals the in
creased fire risk that threatens all of California
during a six-year drought that has left the
state's grassy areas dry and vulnerable.
And they say danger still lurks in the form of
state budget cuts — which may force local fire
stations to make do with less manpower — and
the public's tendency to let its preparation level
gradually slip as the memory of a major fire re
cedes.
"I walked the streets of Oakland after the
fire," said Redwood City Fire Marshal Louis
Vella, "and it could just have easily have been
up in Menlo Heights. We have houses, we have
urban and wildlife interface. The potential for
fires is the same."
At Stanford, $43 million worth of Universi
ty-wide budget cuts during the past year have
meant that some fire safety measures have not
been implemented, according to Fire Marshal
Ray Gamma.
In a May memo to various University ad
ministrators and local fire agencies, Gamma
called for the creation of 30-foot-wide fire
breaks throughout the Foothills to prevent the
spread of any large-scale grass fire.
But Gamma said that in some cases, his
warnings were not heeded — which was not a
factor in last week's fire, but could have been
under different circumstances.
He said that only 10-foot breaks were imple
mented on the perimeter of the Foothills and
only a few fire breaks were made along access
roads. Administrators, he said, "apparently
looked at [his memo) and determined there was
no money available to do it."
But Gamma expects that last week's fire will
provide an impetus for administrators. "The
breaks are definitely going to be larger now," he
said.
The blaze, the largest in the Foothills since
a July 1985 fire that damaged 16 houses,
began near the Dish at 2:15 p.m. last Fri
day.
No structures were damaged and no injuries
were reported during the fire, which was con
tained by 6:15 p.m., according to Palo Alto Bat
talion Chief Nick Marinaro.

But during the course of the afternoon, more
than 200 residences and University buildings
were evacuated. Residents along Junipero
Serra Blvd. were asked to leave their homes,
and staff at the solar observatory, the National
Bureau of Economic Research and the Center
for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences
were sent home early.
Panicked residents along Junipero Serra
rushed to pack their cars with photo albums,
artwork, jewelry and clothing after being told
by police to leave. Other homeowners attempt
ed to protect their homes by hosing down roofs
and watering grassy areas.
The cause of the fire has not yet been deter
mined, but a spokesperson for Palo Alto Fire

Chief Robert Wall said he will
probably release a report ei
ther Friday or Monday. He
has ruled out arson as a cause.
Some firefighters specu
late that fallen Pacific Gas
and Electric electrical lines in
the vicinity of the Dish start
ed the blaze. Several PG&E
trucks were present at the
firefighters' staging area near
the Dish during the fire.
Dan Rhodes, a Palo Alto
firefighter who spent the early
part of this week putting out
remaining "hot spots" in the
Foothills, said it was "a good
possibility" that the fallen
power lines started the fire.
Fire investigators and
PG&E crews were seen work
ing on the power lines near
the Dish early this week.
The fire was pushed by
strong wind gusts from the
Dish area east, toward Ju
nipero Serra, and south to
ward Page Mill Road. The
consistently changing direc
tion of winds initially made it
difficult for crews to control
the blaze, which was moving
at speeds of up to 40 miles per
hour, according to Marinaro.
Brain Robinson, a UC-
Davis student, was jogging in
the hills when he noticed an
other runner quickly ap
proaching him. When he
looked back, he saw smoke
and a line of fire. Robinson de-

bated whether to slow down
and watch. Instead, he said, "I thought of the
Oakland fire and sprinted back."
But reactions like Robinson's will be far
less common in the next few years, as (lie
memory of the Oakland hills fire and (he
Foothills fire fade, firefighters say.
"Certainly the Oakland fire raised every
body's awareness, but it's cyclical — unless
there are ongoing major fires, after a period nf
time people tend to forget," said Hal Hendrix,

Santa Clara County fire marshal.
And Gamma said that "everybody gets excit
ed about safety," after fires, "but then things
die down and people go back to their old, normal
habits."
Firefighters warn that if homeowners do not
take proper measures to safeguard their proper
ty — such as maintaining a 30-foot space of
cleared vegetation around their house and clean
ing needles and leaves from the roof — the risk of
a major fire is substantially increased.
And during a drought, when the stakes are
higher, the smallest factors may be critical. "In
this day and age, in a metropolitan area, just
letting a fire burn doesn't work anymore. Once
Mother Nature gets a head on, you can't control

her," said Jack Clark, fire
prevention officer for the
California Department of
Forestry's Santa Clara
County Ranger Unit.
Efforts to "aggressively
fight fires," Clark added,
must focus on safeguard
ing areas at risk and edu
cating the public about the
dangers before fires start.
"The Oakland hills fires
are the epitome of what we
have known all these years
in the fire service," Vella
said. "We knew that this
could happen here, but it's
very difficult to bring it
home to the citizens of our
Peninsula."
Local firefighters
worry that, as budget
constraints come
into focus over the next few
years, proper fire safety
measures may be sacrificed
by state lawmakers.
Budget cuts could
have "devastating effects
on many of the fire juris
dictions in California," said
Hal Hendrix, fire marshal
for Santa Clara County. He
added that although Gov.
Pete Wilson has pledged to
avoid large cuts in police
and fire departments, he is
not so sure Wilson will
keep his promise. "Every
thing's a possibility at this
point," Hendrix said.

The California Department of Forestry,
which assisted in fighting the Foothills fire last
week by making several 500-gallon water
drops, must cut its budget by 8.4 percent this
year.
Clark said firefighters are "concerned"
about the effect the cut might have on their
ability to prevent msyor fires, but are still un
certain about what the cuts may mean for local
ranger stations like his.
Cuts were made with the intention of doing

"everything we can to save our initial attack ca
pability," said Bill Teie, deputy director for fire
prevention for the California Department of
Forestry.
The department has not eliminated any en
pines, fire stations or helicopters, but has
"parked" six of 27 air tankers, closed nine look
out stations and dropped from 220 fire crews to
183, Teie said.
While the cuts will probably have a "mini
mal" effect on day-to-day operations, he said
they will have a much larger impact when the
department must fight "multiple fires or major

fires."
In the wake of budget cuts, Vella said, "it's
going to be a very challenging time."
The charred Foothills were reopened to the
public this week. Runners — along with
gawkers who merely wanted to have a
look at the blackened hills — began returning
to the area as cleanup crews finished their
work.
Until yesterday, fire crews maintained 24-
hour patrols, monitoring flare-ups and water
ing down any smoldering areas.
In a footnote to the fire, some residents have
received fraudulent calls from people who claim
to be collecting money for the victims of the fire.
"There is no fund, and there are no victims,"
Palo AHo Fire Chief Wall told the Associated
Press.
The hills will suffer no permanent damage,
Gamma said. He expects them to be restored
and green again by early next winter.
But the Foothills are not the only area of
campus that poses a fire risk, Gamma said. Al
though he said the central campus is generally
in compliance with his regulations, the grassy
areas along Palm Drive and near Frost Am
phitheater are potential fire hazards. Gamma
said he will recommend that those areas be
mowed, along with a general cleanup of other
parts of campus.
Vella said a fire like the one in the Oakland
hills is not out of the question — it will only
take the right match of circumstances.
"This time of year, at this hour of the day,
the wind picks up," he said. "I'm looking out
the window from my office.
There's a big flag in front of City Hall, and
the wind is going pretty good. From '2:30 on
wards — with the heat still pretty intense —
the smallest spark could start a fire and you
have the potentinl."
