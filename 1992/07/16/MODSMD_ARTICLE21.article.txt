# Oak-tree replanting project threatened by fire
## 
### June Mølgaard Staff writer 
The powerful fire that engulfed the
Foothills last Friday burned more
than just dry grass.
At stake were thousands of oak saplings
planted in the area and a local ecology
group's efforts to preserve the fragile eco
system of the Foothills.
Since 1984, Magic Inc. has been planting
more than 20,000 acorns in the Foothills,
and members saw their years of work jeop
ardized within a few hours.
"I was frightened. We had no idea of what
we would see the next morning," said Dave
Muffly, coordinator for Magic's oak regener
ation project.
Fortunately for the group, the larger
trees only suffered superficial damages, and
the burned zone included only about half of
the total area planted with seedlings, MufTly

said.
Stanford and
Magic began the oak
tree replanting pro
ject when it was ob
served that young
oaks were dying out at
an early stage — due
to grazing cattle and
the European grasses
that leave little water
for the acorn roots, ac
cording to campus

planner Drew Oman.
Although the cattle were fenced off, and
1,500 to 2,000 seedlings were subsequently
planted and protected with wire, the
drought was one threat that never went
away, and a smaller fire swept the area last
year.
"We were conscious that there was a pos
sibility that something like this would hap
pen," MufFly said, adding that preventing a
fire would be difficult. "You'd be fighting
Mother Nature."
Magic considered measures such as mow
ing around the small seedlings, but the idea
fell through because of the tremendous
labor involved.
The group did spread mulch chips around

some of the trees, which did not catch fire as
easily, MufTly said.
Cows and even goats may be reintro
duced in the future as a possible fire protec
tion measure, according to Oman.
The removal of the cattle may have been
a very large contributor to the potential of
fire, said Fire Marshal Ray Gamma.
In the past, their continuous grazing
maintained the height of the grass at so low
a level that fire had difficulty catching and
spreading.
MufTly said Magic is looking for a long
term, viable way to guard against fire dam
age which may include replacing the foreign
European grasses with the native bunch
grasses.
"We need to take a look at the whole eco
system, decide how to use the land and then
look at the risks and how to manage them,"
MufTly said. "We are moving toward a more
holistic approach."

The European an
nual grasses typical
ly deplete the soil of
moisture much
more rapidly that
the indigenous and
perennial bunch
grasses. These have
a much deeper root
system and stay
green longer.
There is also rea
son for optimism

with the nature of
the oaks themselves, Muffly said.
While about 80 to 90 percent of the oak
saplings were "burned to the ground,"
Muffly said it remains unclear whether the
burned seedlings have died.
Oaks are extremely fire-adaptive, he said,
adding that the stem of an oak may be
burned entirely and still resprout when the
rains come.
The oak regeneration project will, accord
ing to Muffly, continue. Three hundred sites
— most likely in the burned areas — will be
selected for the planting of acorns in the fall.
But the future of the project relies on the
amount of effort students and the University
will put into preserving the habitat, he said.
