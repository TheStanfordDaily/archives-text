# FIRE SCARS FOOTHILLS
## For hilltop scholars, burning memories 
### Mike Laris Senior staff writer 
Haunted by the memory of an Indian
sociologist whose manuscripts went
up in flames two decades before,
members of a research center in the
Foothills spent an anxious hour and a half
packing their cars with their computers and
watching Friday's blaze snake its way to
within several hundred yards of their offices
before being forced to evacuate.
"I'm getting out all the data stuff," said
Patrick Goebel, network administrator at
the Center for the Advanced Study of Be
havioral Sciences, an independent research
center on the north side of Stanford's usual
ly sedate foothills.
"Simple hardware is no problem,"
Goebel added shortly after 3 p.m. as he filled
his car, "but here are tapes of data."
Many scholars, including former Har
vard President Derek Bok, evacuated their
stunning hill-top vista before 3:30 p.m.
when about a dozen hold-outs were told a
strong wind could push the flames down to
ward the entrance road and strand them.
"All I care about is the hard disk," said
Ijarry Liu as he drove away.
After everyone else left, 24-year Center
veteran Alan Henderson was taking a final
check around.
"Am I the last soldier?" he asked.
"I keep thinking the road might stop it,
but I don't know."
Henderson was referring to the road that
leads from Junipero Serra toward the Dish.
Firefighters used it several minutes later to
hold back the flames.
In the uncertain moments before he left,
Henderson recalled an earlier fire at the
Center, set before dawn by arsonists, that
destroyed two office clusters.
"We had a big fire around here in 1970
that became famous for loss of data," Hen
derson said. "You have to be worried."
In an interview this week, Henderson ex
plained that the fire gutted the office of
prominent Indian sociologist M.N. Srinivas,
burning a compilation of his life's work on
the Indian caste system.
The fire was set during the campus' wide
spread — and sometimes violent — protests
against the Vietnam War, and many, includ
ing President Richard Nixon, thought Stan
ford students were responsible, although no
arrests were made.
According to Preston Cutler, associate
director of the Center at the time, the for
mer president expressed outrage about the
incident to the press. "Nixon said, 'Those

rascals tried to burn down the Center.' He
was referring to Stanford students."
Henderson said that Nixon also wrote
Srinivas a letter apologizing on behalf of the
United States.
Hoover Institution senior research fel
low John Bunzel, then a fellow at the Cen
ter, was reputed to be the target of the at
tack, and he and others lost some of their re
search.
Several scholars recalled the Srinivas
headlines before they evacuated on Friday,
but without the relatively happy ending;
Srinivas was given another fellowship,
funds for a junior scholar, and was able to
restore most of his work with field note
books he had in India, according to Hender
son.
At 4:50 p.m., several scholars from the
Center returned, including Director
Phillip Converse.
He pointed, relieved, to an enormous, di
lapidated "carriage house" that was a part
of the Lathrop estate and was built in the
1890s. Charles Lathrop was the brother of
Jane Lathrop Stanford.
Converse noted that if the brushfire
would have reached the cracked, century
old garage, it would have exploded in flames
and jumped onto the adjacent Center.
He said that Stanford is "in the process"
of taking down the "very ominous" carriage
house. He added sarcastically, "We are very
grateful they are taking this down next
week."
Robert Scott, the Center's associate di
rector, said the carriage house has been an
extreme fire danger for years. Several years
ago, Stanford students had Halloween par
ties there, and the barn is a "natural magnet
for drifters," Scott said.
Many individuals, including a man evict
ed by the police in late May, have "quietly
moved in," causing some concern about
safety, he added.
"The drifters will often use candles for
light," Scott said.
Friday's blaze may have spurred the Uni
versity to speed action on the building.
In a meeting yesterday of planning offi
cials, the University architect and a member
of Stanford's historical society, the Univer
sity made final decisions regarding destruc
tion of the old house, said Andy Doty, Stan
ford's director of community relations.
The University had come to the "tenta
tive conclusion earlier this year to raze the
building," he said.
"Today was the final meeting to say 'Yes.
lx?ts take the building down.' "

Henderson said that Nixon also wrote
Srinivas a letter apologizing on behalf of the
United States.
Hoover Institution senior research fel
low John Bunzel, then a fellow at the Cen
ter, was reputed to be the target of the at
tack, and he and others lost some of their re
search.
Several scholars recalled the Srinivas
headlines before they evacuated on Friday,
but without the relatively happy ending;
Srinivas was given another fellowship,
funds for a junior scholar, and was able to
restore most of his work with field note
books he had in India, according to Hender
son.
At 4:50 p.m., several scholars from the
Center returned, including Director
Phillip Converse.
He pointed, relieved, to an enormous, di
lapidated "carriage house" that was a part
of the Lathrop estate and was built in the
1890s. Charles Lathrop was the brother of
Jane Lathrop Stanford.
Converse noted that if the brushfire
would have reached the cracked, century
old garage, it would have exploded in flames
and jumped onto the adjacent Center.
He said that Stanford is "in the process"
of taking down the "very ominous" carriage
house. He added sarcastically, "We are very
grateful they are taking this down next
week."
Robert Scott, the Center's associate di
rector, said the carriage house has been an
extreme fire danger for years. Several years
ago, Stanford students had Halloween par
ties there, and the barn is a "natural magnet
for drifters," Scott said.
Many individuals, including a man evict
ed by the police in late May, have "quietly
moved in," causing some concern about
safety, he added.
"The drifters will often use candles for
light," Scott said.
Friday's blaze may have spurred the Uni
versity to speed action on the building.
In a meeting yesterday of planning offi
cials, the University architect and a member
of Stanford's historical society, the Univer
sity made final decisions regarding destruc
tion of the old house, said Andy Doty, Stan
ford's director of community relations.
The University had come to the "tenta
tive conclusion earlier this year to raze the
building," he said.
"Today was the final meeting to say 'Yes.
lx?ts take the building down.' "

A California Department of Forestry helicopter douses the hillside with one of many
500-gallon water drops last Friday afternoon. The blaze's thick black smoke darkened
campus and was visible in several surrounding communities.
