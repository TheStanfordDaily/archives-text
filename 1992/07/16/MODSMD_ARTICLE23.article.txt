## When the secondary is primary 
### M. Scott Walker Staff writer 
When the curtain goes up on
the Cardinal football season, most
people will look to stars such as
Walsh, Stenstrom, and Milburn to
lead Stanford to a happy ending.
But a pair of character actors
just may steal the show.
Vaughn Bryant and Darrien
Gordon, the starting Cardinal cor
nerbacks, may be the keys to an
other good year from Stanford's
defense.
"If me and Darrien can stop the
pass, then nine other guys can
stop the run," said Bryant.
They have proven they can do
just that. Bryant, a junior from
Detroit, started every game for the
Cardinal at cornerback last sea
son. Gordon, a senior from Okla
homa, is a two-year starter.
Gordon distinguished himself
near the end of last season. He was
second on the team in intercep
tions. This included a spectacular
42-yard interception return for a
touchdown against Washington
State. He has positioned himself
for possible preseason honors
from the Pacific 10 Conference.
Bryant started last year much
more slowly. He was converted to
cornerback from wide receiver
during 1991 spring practice.
He constantly improved over
the season, which he attributes to
consistent playing time. "It's
amazing what a year of experience
can do," Bryant said.
He explained the transition to
defensive excellence as a matter of
being comfortable. "It's mostly
mental. [Playing cornerback]
wasn't second nature. Because I
know it so well now, I don't have to
think about it in crucial situations."
Bryant requested the change to
defense, a request which he in no
way regrets. "I felt like I could
help the team better," he said.
Toward the end of the season,
Bryant's words began to ring true.
He seemed to be improving as
quickly as the team. His perfor
mance began to come together
during the team's seven-game
winning streak.
The request to play corner
wasn't necessarily the best public
ity move for Bryant. "Stanford is
just an offensive school," he said.

"l think [the defense is] appreciat
ed, but we just don't have the no
toriety."
The defensive unit, however, is
quickly gaining that notoriety.
Linebacker Ron George is a
tremendous athlete who will be a
high draft choice next year. Safety
Seyon Albert's steady play at safe
ty may merit him a chance in a pro
camp. And LB Dave Garnett
blends great defensive leadership
with savvy play to give the Cardi
nal defense another legitimate
star. This is the core of a defensive
unit which gelled tremendously
during Stanford's long winning
streak last season.
But, despite these standouts,
the Cardinal defense has some
weaknesses. Team speed may be
their biggest fault, a fault which
be severely tested in their Pigskin
Classic clash with Texas A&M.
But Bryant downplays this defi
ciency.
"Tom [Williams] and Coy
[Gibbs] aren't burners, but they
get the job done," Bryant said. He

mentioned George, Garnett, Gor
don, and himself as outside play
ers who have good speed. "If you
have perimeter speed, that's all
you really need," he said. He
quickly added, "You're not going
to go around us, you've got to go
through us."
Bryant doesn't believe teams
were picking on him during the
times when he was struggling. But
then, he disagrees with detractors
who say he had a horrible season.
"People could say I had a bad game
[against USC on October 19], but
they only caught two passes on
me," contended Bryant. He added,
"I only gave up one touchdown
[last season]."
His words are clearly the ones
of a man confident of his abilities.
His strengths? "Coverage. Man to
man, straight me and you cover
age," he said, showing a bold de
fensive mindset reminiscent of
Lester Hayes or Deion "Prime
Time" Sanders.
The lack of this mindset in
some facets of his game was ad

mittedly a part of his shortcom
ings last year. He felt his weakness
is "being real aggressive on the
run,"he said. "I just didn't have
the [defensive] mentality."
But that has definitely
changed. The new defensive atti
tude for the Cardinal has affected
Mr. Bryant also. Oh, by the way,
Vaughn, do you think offenses will
go after you this year?
"I hope so."
Enough said.

Seyon Albert, shown here sacking Cal's Mike Pawlawski, is one of the defensive backs that may be the
key to Stanford's season. The Cardinal defense returns 10 of last year's starters.
