Two recently departed
Card stars cashed in on their
Stanford educations this
week, signing big-time con
tracts with major league
teams. Hoopster Adam
Keefe, drafted three weeks
ago by the Atlanta Hawks,
will get seven million dollars
over five years. The terms of
the contract that baseball's
Jeffrey Hammonds signed
with the Baltimore Orioles
were not announced, but
Hammonds did receive a cool
million as a signing bonus.
