# Doin' just fine

Two other baseball alums
are already enjoying great
success. The White Sox's
Jack McDowell and the
Orioles' Mike Mussina were
All-Stars, and both pitched
masterfully. McDowell
mowed down Fred McGrifT,
Terry Pendleton, and Andy
Van Slyke, the three hitters
he faced. Not to be outdone,
Mussina retired Darren
Daulton, Gary Sheffield and
Ozzie Smith in order.
