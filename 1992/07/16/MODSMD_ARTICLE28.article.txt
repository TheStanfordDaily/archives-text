# NOSE TO NOSE
## Pusillanimous prognosticators pick postseason prizes 
### 
O.K. Sean, it's time for us to make
some baseball predictions that will make
us look really bad in three months. We're
halfway through the season, and here's
how I think all the races will end up.
Hatting Title: I've got to pick some
proven winners. In the American League,

Kirby Puckett will run
away with the crown. In
the National, Tony Gwynn
will rise to the top over a
sinking John Kruk.
MVP: In the AL, Kirby's
going to take this one too,
unless Mark McGwire hits,
like, 85 home runs. The NL
is wide-open, but the Ice
man cometh, and Tom
Glavine will prevail.
Cy Young: Glavine will
complete a rare sweep by
snagging this award as
well. The guy is just unhit
table (except in All-Star
play). Over in the AL, look

for Juan "Duck, Duck" Guzman to snag
the trophy.
We interrupt this column for a few
lesser-known award presentations
The Backup Singer for the Clash
Award: To Brave/Falcon Deion Sanders
— should he stay or should he go?
The Nobody Runs Like a Deere Award:

To Detroit's Rob Deer, who can't run.
The J. Danforth Quayle Award for
Spelling Proficiency : To Danny Jackson —
Come on, Danny, you can do it. L-O-S-E-R.
We now return you to the regular
ly scheduled column, already in
progress.

The Reds will pull a
Toronto and choke away
the NL West, making way
for the extremely talented
but politically incorrect
Braves. Atlanta will then
tomahawk-chop whatever
wretched team manages to
emerge from the NL Least.
It'll probably be the Cards.
On the junior circuit,
Toronto will win the East
yet again, but they will also
pull a Toronto and lose to
Minnesota in the ALCS.
Sorry, A's fans, but Elvis is
dead.
So we'll once again have a

Braves-Twins Series, and we all remember
how good the last one was. This one will
also come down to the wire, hut Atlanta will
get its revenge. In the ofT season, Puckett
will get a gazillion dollar contract and the
Giants will move to Cleveland, finally giv
ing that city a m<\ior baseball team. See ya
next week.

Such confidence, Noah. It's my philos
ophy that if you're going to make predic
tions, you should try to get them right. Let
me show you how its done.
Batting Title: All right, I'll give you
Puckett (lucky guess), but in the NL,
Pittsburgh's Andy Van Slyke will hold off

all comers for his first
crown.
MVP: Either Puckett or
the A's Mark McGwire, de
pending on which team wins
the AL West. I go with the
Twins and Fat Boy. Again, I
like Van Slyke in the NL.
Cy Young: Puckett and
Van Slyke. Whoops, I got
into a groove there. My real
picks are St. Louis' Bob
Tewksbury — another
Yankee reject who went on
to be a star elsewhere —
and Stanford/Baltimore's
Mike Mussina. Score one
for sentiment.

Earlier, at a much more obscure site,
the Magnificence Award winners were
chosen. Here are some highlights from
the ceremony.
The Funniest Player Award: To center
fielder Van Slyke, winning him my Triple
Crown. Recently, he made an unassisted
double play. That is not funny. What is

funny is that on his way to tag first base,
he dribbled the baseball on the Astroturf
all the way, then shoved the first-baseman
off the bag so he could touch it himself.
The "Hey, isn't that the guy on
90210?" Award: To the Orioles' Brady
Anderson. Nice sideburns, buddy. And fi-

nally. ..
The Cleveland Indians
Award: To the Cleveland
Indians, yet again.
But back to the real
world...
Playoff Predictions: In
the AL West — The A's get
C'B, and the Twins will re
peat. AL East — Balti
more goes undefeated to
beat Toronto by 45 games.
It'll happen. Really.
NL East — Who cares?
Pittsburgh by default. NL
West — Lou Pinella and
the Reds going away.
In the best-of-seven

League Championship Series, Cincinnati
will knock off the Pirates in five, and Bal
timore will take Minnesota in three.
I don't know who will win the World
Series, but I think it will be so close that it
will stretch the baseball season almost to
the end of October. What? It already
does? Oh well, that's another column.
