## A
						NEW WORLD EMERGES IN COMIC BOOKS 
### Janar Stewart Editorial staff 
Between super-bright, glossy
pages exist dreamweavers, men
who fly and women baring their
breasts.
For decades comic books have
taken their readers to scores of
other worlds, fulfilling fantasies
from the gamy to the sublime by de
picting the exploits of one or more
white male heroes.
Never known for literary value,
the strength of comics tended to lie
in the cleverly created wonderlands
inhabited by the heroes and vil
lains, the intensity of the battles be
tween the forces of good and evil
and the quality of artwork.
But recent efforts have been
made to appeal to an audience
broader than that of white, male ju
veniles.
For instance, writer Neil
Gaiman and artists Mike Dringen
berg and Malcolm Jones created
"Sandman: The Doll's House," a
comic that caters to older readers.
Gaiman toys with our under
standing of death and dreaming
through the surreal experiences of
main character Rose Walker, as the
Dream Vortex.
Dream, death, destiny, desire —
along with a couple other emotions
or human experiences that begin
with the letter "d" — are made sib
lings and given personas.
At some unknown time in the
past, an evil mortal seeking ever
lasting life meant to capture
Dream's sister, Death, but mistak
enly imprisons Dream (a.k.a. Mor
pheus). Ultimately failing in his
quest, the mortal dies, leaving Mor
pheus to go free.
During the time of his capture,
Morpheus lost track of the Vortex
(now 21-year-old Walker in the
90s), and the plot begins with his
search for Walker.
Morpheus must destroy her to
prevent all of the people on Earth
from merging minds with her in
their sleep, thus sharing one gigan
tic dream and damaging the dream
world beyond repair.
The storyline combines Walker's
discovery and understanding of her
past with the unraveling of the
writer's philosophy on death and
dreaming. The plot is more sophis
ticated than a superhero comic, yet
the artists, Dringenberg and Jones,
fall victim to the mysterious need to

draw women either naked or
with their breasts exposed,
striking feeble poses.
Gaiinan inadequately ex-

plains his in
clusion of

the means and motives of serial
murderers. Scenes where one of
Morpheus' creations, The Corinthi
an, goes astray and gauges out the
eyes of innocent, young males seem
out of place, adding nothing but un
necessary violence to the story.
"Elf Quest," by Wendy and
Richard Pini, avoids such unnec
essary violence with characters
who aim to resolve disagreements
on a higher level. Writer and artist
Wendy Pini creates a world that
exists on Earth, yet hidden from
humans.
In this world, the elves live
among trolls, wolves and other
species. They discuss their differ
ences and attempt to live in harmo
ny with one another, rather than
resorting to quick, short-term vio
lence to solve problems.
Although some violence exists in
the elf world, there are no "bad
guys." There are elves who have bad
sides and good sides. One elf, Ratek,
of the immortal species, feels superi
or to the mortal elves and clings to
an ideology that would harm the
mortal elves in the long run.
Rather than try to kill him, the
other elves force Ratek to face the

elves that he would hurt before
carrying through his plan. Ratek
must confront this immensely
more challenging moral dilem
ma in place of having a conve
nient battle with "good" elves.
A more violent comic, Frank
Miller and Dave Gibbons' "Give
Me Liberty," attempts to reach a
wider audience via political cor
rectness.
Readers witness the birth of
an unlikely hero within the pages
of this comic. Disadvantaged,
teenaged, female and black,
Martha Washington has to '

fight the entire Establish-

ment in this exaggeration
of American society set
between 1995 and 2011.
Washington was born
in Miller and Gibbons'
vision of the United
States in the near future
— a violent nation
plagued by severe eco
nomic division, rampant
political corruption, irre
versible ecological dam
age and the decay of police
and health services.
Black people live im
prisoned in a lower income
housing facility located

in Chicago known as the Cabrini
Green. Anyone who tries to escape
faces the wrath of Chicago's finest.
"Give Me Liberty" tracks Wash
ington's brutal escape from the pro
ject and pits her against all kinds of
evils as she joins PAX, the "peace"
keeping force — equivalent to the
U.S. army — and fights for survival
in a system that seethes with de
pravity.
Unfortunately, "Give Me Liber
ty" encounters difficulty in the polit
ical correctness department. Al
though many well-deserved blows
bludgeon the army, the media and
certain political figures, for some un
known reason members of the bigot
ed, bad-guy group Aryan Thrust are
white, male and gay. Finding the
connection here is impossible.
And all women other than Wash
ington are either mindless muscle-

heads or militant, man- and

marriage-hating femi-

nists.
Washing-

ton is bla
tantly
two-

dimensional and
rather unrealistic. She is
burned, shot, beaten up

and her identity is
stolen from her, yet
she overcomes all of
this with her fists, her
guns and her will to
survive. Superman
couldn't be more

sickening.
A better at
tempt at includ
ing a more cere
bral audience is
Frank Miller's
"Batman. . .The
Dark Knight Re
turns." In this
comic, which
chronicles Bruce
