## COMICS HIT THE SCREEN IN COOL WORLD 
### 
If you want to enjoy "Cool
World," Ralph Bakshi's new fanta
sy flick that blends animation with
live action, you have to enter the
theater in a certain state of mind.
Regress to when you were about
10 years old on an early Saturday
morning. You've just hauled your
self from bed, and marched heavy
lidded down to the TV. You're swad
dled in the warmth of your pajamas,
and you just want to have fun.
As the Road Runner speeds
across the screen, you never once
concern yourself with intricacies of
the plot or character development.
They're just cartoons, after all.
If you can somehow show up at
the theater in this magical state,
"Cool World" will be a blast. Other
wise, all of the huge inconsistencies

and tacky technical flaws will be
come intolerable.
The story is set along the same
lines as "Who Framed Roger Rab
bit?" And the two movies are tied by
more than a strong sense of dej& vu.
The similarities are chilling — the
kind that would get someone prose
cuted for Honor Code violations
around here.
The film opens in the 1940s
when a tragic accident transports
Frank Harris (Brad Pitt) to the car
toon universe Cool World, a chaotic
world where doodles wreak endless
mayhem.
Fifty years later, cartoonist Jack
Deebs (Gabriel Byrne) gets out of
jail, where he had created the Cool
World cartoon series to help pass
the days. He also created Holli
Would (voiced and played by Kim
Basinger) to help ease the loneliness
of his nights.
Deebs begins to spontaneously
teleport into Cool World, apparent
ly drawn by the lustful desires of
Holli. An ambitious and sleazy doo
dle, Holli hopes that Deebs will help
her become real, so that she can live
what she imagines is the better life
in the 'noid universe (our world).
However, Harris — now a detec
tive for the Cool World Police — im
mediately accosts Deebs and warns
him that the "oldest rule in Cool
World is that 'noids don't have sex
with doodles."
The conflict takes off from there,
rushing to an empty climax that is
all the more ridiculous because of its
attempt to be large and powerful.
But there are some wonderful
things about this movie. As a spec
tacle, it is impressive and entertain
ing. The backdrop that most of the
Cool World scenes are set against is
visually stunning. Buildings are
towering and surreal, and wind
through the cityscape with a life of
their own.
The main action sequences are
also populated by every style of car
toon character ever seen. Cute bun
nies skip through flowery lan dscapes
while cartoon gangsters wage war
around them. Safes continually
plummet from the sky and flatten
giggling doodles.
The pace is intense, and never re
leases its grip. At first these tan
gents are amusing distractions from
the main plot. But as the movie
draws to a close, they become over
whelming and detract from the film.
Surprisingly, much of the
humor of these sequences is a lot
more lewd that we've come to ex
pect from animation. At first star
tling, the occasional raunchy mo
ment provides some true hilarity
that matches the adult atmosphere
of the scene where Holli seduces
Deebs.
However, the artists unfortu
nately had a problem creating realis
tic meshes between the actors and
the doodles that they're supposedly
interacting with.
As a result, "Cool World" leaves
you with that "you're faking!" feel
ing that films like this should strive
to avoid.

NC-17 a bogus lure
"Lovers"
Ever since the motion picture
association replaced the X rating
with the NC-17, those who pushed
for the new rating hoped that it
would encourage filmmakers to
produce films that deal with adult
themes but were not pornograph
ic.
But few high quality NC-17
films have been made. Most com
mercial films try to avoid the rat
ing ("Basic Instinct"), and low
budget/art films use the rating as
an advertising tool.
Vincente Aranda's film,
"Lovers," falls into the latter cate
gory. It is the tale of Paco, an ex
soldier who is engaged to a maid

named Trini.
While she works in the coun
tryside, he works and lives in
Madrid. There he meets the sexu
ally adventurous Luisa, a widow
whose energetic lovemaking is a
far cry from the chaste kisses to
which Trini limits him. Paco's in
ability to decide whom he wants
leads to a tragic ending for all.
But "Lovers" doesn't deliver
the steamy sex scenes that its rat
ing promises. In fact, notwith
standing Luisa's inventive use of a
handkerchief in one scene, there is
no difference between this film
and the R-rated "Basic Instinct,"
which showed just how unerotic
graphic sex could be.
Nor does it boast much of a
story. Luisa supports herself as a
con artist, which is an important

plot point, but Aranda's screen
play haphazardly introduces this
and then brings it up only when
necessary.
The rest of the time, Luisa is ei
ther fighting with Paco over Trini
or throwing him down on her bed,
often in the same scene.
The film is told from the per
spective of Paco, who is the least
interesting of the characters.
What could have been a war be
tween the two women with Paco as
merely the battlefield — as in the
similarly themed "The Grifters"
— becomes a typical male fantasy:
the lovable male has both the
Whore and the Madonna fighting
to have sex with him.
Though the film boasts strong
performances by Victoria Abril
(Luisa) andMaribelVerdu (Trini),
their characters are developed al
most solely in their interactions
with Paco.
There's not even enough good
sex here to call "Lovers" exploita
tional. It exploits only the sizeable
audience that saw it and the NC
-17 rating it used to get them there.

Titanic clash sinks
"Universal Soldier "
For the first ten minutes, "Uni
versal Soldier" lives up to its
billing as the 1992 edition of
"Total Recall" and "T2."
But except for the beginning of
the film, which includes a spectac
ular rescue scene at Hoover Dam,
this movie pales in comparison.
Plot twists and the unexpected
are not in the production equation
for "Universal Soldier," but heavy
doses of action, explosions, blood,
guts, guns and death certainly
are.
The film brings an old premise
— the invincible soldier— to the
modern age, but fails to exploit the
idea. The most disappointing fea
ture of "Universal Soldier" is that
the concept has real potential, as
the first 10 minutes of the movie
proves.
Jean-Claude Van Damme and
Dolph Lundgren star as rival
unisols, bio-engineered soldiers of
super-human strength capable of
executing orders expertly and
without regard for their own bod
ies.
Van Damme is given ample op
portunities to demonstrate his su
perior martial arts skills and does
impress.
Conversely, Lundgren squan
ders an opportunity to become a
truly despicable villain, and in

stead develops into just an average
maniac killer. The most frighten
ing thing about Lundgren is how
stupid his character seems to be.
The imperfect soldier Van
Damme has flashbacks from his
days in Vietnam, where he died in
the process of killing his berserk
sergeant (Lundgren). As humani
ty starts to return to him, Van
Damme remembers some disturb
ing experiences and begins to mal
function.
Defying orders, he saves the life
of reporter Ally Walker and flees
the unisol compound with her.
Lundgren and the rest of the
unisol team then set out to hunt
down the fugitives, with shoot-to
kill directives.
The elite team of unisols is
based out of an extremely modi
fied 18-wheeler containing the sci
entists and equipment to provide
metabolic and surgical needs. In
stead of ominous, the overgrown
tractor-trailer appears laughable.
The explanation of the medical
phenomena allowing the existence
of the unisols is quick and pain
less, much less so than the giant
doses of memory-erasing serum
the unisols regularly have injected
just below the base of the skull or
the muscle enhancers seemingly
squeezed directly into the aorta.
Beyond the dramatic opening
scenes, plot development lacks
suspense or fear, and the potential
exposure of the true story behind
the unisols yields no tension.
Neither Van Damme nor Walk
er generate any emotional attach
ment from the audience, and
Walker's sympathy for Van
Damme is forced. She really pro
vides nothing to the plot except an
opportunity for Van Damme to es
cape and the hunt to begin.
Detachment from the charac
ters lessens the impact of the en
suing struggles and chases. Van
Damme just wants to go home and
Lundgren just wants to kill him.
Watching the film becomes noth
ing more than waiting for the 112 inal
confrontation.
As the impending collision of
Van Damme and Lundgren in
evitably grows nearer, innocent
civilians are trampled along the
path of destruction. At last the
greatly anticipated one-on-one
showdown is staged.
After pushing a syringe full of
muscle enhancer into their chests,
Van Damme and Lundgren pound
on each other for a while.
Finally, the main event — far
from a clash of titans — comes to a
gruesome end, punctuated with a
bad pun.
