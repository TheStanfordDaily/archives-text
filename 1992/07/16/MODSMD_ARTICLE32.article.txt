... ."Honey I Blew Up the Kid"
may not be high on your list of
new film releases to catch this
weekend, but it will offer one
added bonus that may make it
worth seeing.
"Off His Rockers" continues
the Disney mini-tradition of of
fering a cartoon short before the
company'B feature films. This
time it's not Roger Rabbit and
Baby Herman, but a computer
generated animated short that
will appear before "Honey."
.. ."Batman Returns" got
thumped — relatively speaking
— at the box office last week,
plummeting from numero uno

to number four. "A League of
Their Own" topped the charts,
with "Universal Soldier" and
"Boomerang" also besting the
Caped Crusader's $7.7 million.
. . .Imagine college without
David Letterman. You may have
to do that soon, unless Letterman
ends the uncertainty surround
ing the renegotiation of his con
tract, which will expire in April.
NBC is trying to prepare for the
future, as this week the network an
nounced that Dana Carvey has
signed to stay with NBC, but not nec
essarily with "Saturday Night Live."
Carvey with a late-night show?
A possibility, but let's hope it's bet
ter than fellow SNL alum Dennis
Miller's show or any of Carvey's
movies.
.. .The Lollapalooza Tour kicks
off this weekend in our own back
yard — Shoreline Amphitheatre in
Mountain View.
But if you don't already have tick
ets or don't want to pay scalpers'
prices, you'd be better off venturing
to the Century 10 Cinemas down
the road from Shoreline. "Batman
Returns" probably isn't sold out any
more, but the concert is.
.. .Speaking of concerts, it was
about a year ago that Axl Rose
caused that riot during a St. I»uis
Guns N' Roses concert.
Now the singer not only has
been arrested on four misde
meanor assault charges and one
damage to property charge, he's
also being sued by IJoyd's of Lon
don for the costs of the riot.
.. .Another concert, of a very dif
ferent nature, returns to Frost Am
phitheater tonight, and you'll prob
ably even be able to get tickets to
this one.
The Center for Computer Re
search in Music and Acoustics of
fers its annual Computer Music
Festival this evening, featuring the
cutting edge in sounds you didn't
know machines could make.
