... ."Honey I Blew Up the Kid"
may not be high on your list of
new film releases to catch this
weekend, but it will offer one
added bonus that may make it
worth seeing.
"Off His Rockers" continues
the Disney mini-tradition of of
fering a cartoon short before the
company'B feature films. This
time it's not Roger Rabbit and
Baby Herman, but a computer
generated animated short that
will appear before "Honey."
.. ."Batman Returns" got
thumped — relatively speaking
— at the box office last week,
plummeting from numero uno

to number four. "A League of
Their Own" topped the charts,
with "Universal Soldier" and
"Boomerang" also besting the
Caped Crusader's $7.7 million.
. . .Imagine college without
David Letterman. You may have
to do that soon, unless Letterman
ends the uncertainty surround
ing the renegotiation of his con
tract, which will expire in April.
