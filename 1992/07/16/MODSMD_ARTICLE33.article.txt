# On strength of its songs, 'Comedy' a nostalgic trip
## 
### Janar Stewart Editorial staff 
Prepare for a night of music and nostal
gia when planning to see Theatre Works'
"The Human Comedy."
The lively musical transports the audi
ence into another time — a time when it
was almost considered a crime to avoid
striking up a conversation with someone
passing on the street.
Adapted from the William Saroyan
novel of the same name, "The Human
Comedy" tells the story of an imaginary
Central Valley town called Ithaca, focusing
on one family, the Macauleys.
Family patriarch Matthew Macauley,
who died of ailments linked to old age two
years before, is survived by his widow and
four children — Marcus, the oldest child
now in the U.S. Army; Bess, a college stu
dent; Homer, a high school student; and
Ulysses, the youngest child.
Now that his father has died and Mar
cus is at the front, Homer must assume the
role of man-of-the-house. So he heads
down to the local Western Union branch
and asks for a job.
After proving to branch owner Span
gler that he can sing, Homer receives the
job of handing out telegrams to the towns
folk.
Homer enjoys his new-found responsi
bility — until he delivers his first telegram
bearing bad news.
Set in the early '40s, "The Human Com
edy" depicts the changes that take place in
Ithaca when many of the townsfolk lose
their sons during World War 11.
Typical of the time period, Ithaca
shrugs off the challenge the deaths pose
to their patriotism and their Christiani
ty-
"The Human Comedy" highlights this
refusal to deal with complicated issues in
the scene where Homer delivers news of
Ithaca's first loss to the war to a Mexican
resident.
Her cries of grief are mingled with the
ensemble singing the inane teen puppy
love song, "I Let Him Kiss Me Once."
This scene poignantly indicates just
how arduous it was for communities such
as Ithaca to seriously question their values
and the powers that be.
As the war rolls on and the death toll in

creases, Homer desires tc curse God and
everything else responsible for the fight
ing, but struggles with his Christian and
American conscience that tells him to do so
is wrong.
"Everything has changed," Homer
says, discouraged. His mother answers his
confusion with an all-too-convenient, "It's
all in your point of view," then breaks into
song.
An explanation like this makes perfect
sense coming from the mouth of the same
woman who, after Homer's little brother
Ulysses asks where Marcus has gone, says:
"Your brother Marcus had to go; we don't
ask what for."
Ithaca's avoidance of the moral ques
tion posed by the war — along with other
signs of the time period, such as the ex
tremely sexist scene where army brats flip
through a girlie magazine while singing
"How I Love Your Thingamajig" — will ir
ritate modern sensitivities.
Yet "The Human Comedy" redeems it
self with a scene in which Marcus writes
Homer a letter that expresses all of his fear
and doubt — he knows that he will proba
bly not live to see the end of the war.
Although "The Human Comedy" per
haps lacks a thorough exploration of the
emotions and fears of its characters, the
musical more than makes up for this with
its stellar score and the strong voices of the
cast.
Composed by Gait MacDermot of
"Hair" fame, the music never ceases to af
fect the audience, whether through
happy, upbeat pop songs or rich, soulful
gospel.
And the power of the tight harmony in
tensifies as cast members wander up and
down the aisles interacting with the audi
ence as they sing.
With songs like "Safe in the Arms of
Jesus," "In Our Little Town" and "If You
Give to a Thief," Ithaca becomes Anytown,
U.S.A. in the early 4 405.
For those who long for"the good ole
days," this nostalgic trip back to naivete
and simplicity is more than enough reason
to see "The Human Comedy."

"The Human Comedy" runs through Au
gust 8 at the Lucie Stern Theatre, 1305
Middlefield Road in Palo Alto. Tickets are
available by calling 329-2623.
