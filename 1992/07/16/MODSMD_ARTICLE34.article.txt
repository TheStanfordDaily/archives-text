# Turtle Islanders present their own brand of jazz
## 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
Since the dawn of the swing era back in the
'30s, the only string instruments to gain admit
tance into jazz combos and big bands have been
the guitar, banjo and string bass.
Cellos, violins and violas never seemed to
completely escape the lofty arrogance of the con
cert hall. But every once in a while you might
hear of a jazz violinist, and some of the driving
forces in jazz — Jimmy Blanton, Charles Mi ngus,
Ron Carter — have been string players, more
specifically bassists.
So why not incorporate the familiar foimat of
rlflssiral string quartets — two violins, viola, cello
— into jazz? The Turtle Island String Quartet an
swers that question Saturday as part of the Stan
ford Jazz Workshop's concert series.
In 1988, the group — Darol Anger, David Bal
akrishnan, Mark Summer, and Katrina Wreede —
released its debut album featuring such standards
as Dizzy Gillespie's "A Night In Tunisia" after
Summer (a former cellist with the Winnipeg Sym
phony) got together with Balakrishnan and Anger
(both progressive violinists) to play standards.
One-time principal violist of the San Jose
Civic Light Opera, Wreede, along with Summer,
brings more classically oriented techniques, like
bowing in unison, to the Quartet.
On the other hand, Anger's experimental ap
proach has helped fellow Islanders get in touch
with the "subtle shades and inflections" of their
instruments. Yet Balakrishnan, a conservative
player who holds a master's degree in composi
tion, adds yet another dimension, often checking
Anger's more adventurous streaks.
Kor an evening of jazz off the beaten path, the
Turtle Island String Quartet is definitely the group
to hear. They can't help but provide a stimulating
contrast to more traditionally attired jazz quartets.
A look at last week
After vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson and his
quartet packed Campbell Recital Hall on July 3,
it must have been slightly disconcerting for jazz
vocalist Bobbe Norris and pianist Larry Dunlap —

not to mention the organizers of the Stanford Jazz
Workshop Concert Series — to open to a crowd of
only 50 people in the auditorium last Friday.
Still, the Norris/Dunlap Quartet offered a
pleasant evening of familiar and more obscure
jazz standards, as well as a group of charming
original arrangements.
Dunlap's arrangement of Chet Baker's "You
or No One" dominated the group's first segment,
featuring the formidable musicianship of Norris,
bassist Seward McCain and drummer Eddie
Marshall.
Early in the performance, Dunlap established
his virtuosity of the keyboard. Similarly, Norris'
smooth, no-frills contralto entertained from
start to finish.
But nowhere else during the evening was Nor
ris' technique better illustrated than in her ren

dition of "Body And Soul." In the history of this
popular jazz classic, some musicians have per
formed the standard while others have offered
passionate, soul-wrenching interpretations.
Norris certainly falls into the latter category.
The aptitude of a jazz vocalist can usually be
determined by taking away his or her musical ac
companiment. Exceptional a cappella perfor
mances demand a musical integrity that cannot
be hidden amidst instrumentation.
With only a bass joining in her vision of "Body
and Soul," Norris aptly proved her worth as a Bay
Area jazz vocalist.

The Turtle Island String Quartet plays Saturday
at Bp.m. at Campbell Recital Hall. For more in
formation on The Stanford Jazz Workshop, call
386-8535; for tickets, call 725-ARTS.
