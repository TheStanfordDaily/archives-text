## Column Are all parents like mine? 
### 
My grandmother and my
parents live geographical
ly very close to each other.
And the truth is, they can't help
but to have other things in com
mon too.
For example, my grandmother
and my parents all have this way
of talking that instantly puts
things in their place.
My last talk with grandma was
during the last time I was really
home. It was the summer before
the gulf war. The U.S. Open was
on TV. I was rooting for Andre
Agassi. McEnroe's match was the
next day.
She saw I was interested and
told me that Agassi, who was then
the fifth-ranked men's tennis
player, looked like the wreck of the
Hesperus.
By the way, if anybody knows
what that means they should
write and tell me. Grandma also
told me, "He looks like he needs a
bath."
My mother and my father are a
little more subtle than that. But
underneath it's still the same.
Take my mother. When I got
back from the doctor there was a
sizable hole in my finger, a ban
dage wrapped around it that was
half red, and as soon as I stepped
in the door she wanted to know all
about it.
I had just spent 15-minute on
the car ride with my father back
from the doctor's — not talking.
And all I wanted to do was be alone
and work on a painting. I had set
up some space for myself in an out
of the way corner of the basement
for occasions like this.
My mother — she isn't much of
a believer in privacy. She's per
fectly willing to come bounding
through a door, even a bathroom
door, to tell me there's a phone
call.
(Still she thinks planting more
trees on the edges of our property
is a good idea.)
But even by her standards, she
had to go well out of her way to
reach me. It's not often that she
has legitimate business in the
basement.
Which means she had to have a
good reason. She found one and
used it over and over again: she
cares.
"Are you feeling all right?"
"Does it hurt much?" "How'syour
finger doing?" "I wouldn't do that
with that finger of yours." "I just
wanted to know how everything's
going." "I'm going to bed now."
She has this funny way of ask
ing the wrong kinds of questions.
She'll say, "That poison ivy of
yours, does it itch much?" Or, "O
that looks like a painting of a
shark. Can you see its teeth?"
(This is about my painting
which has nothing to do with
sharks or any other predators).
It's the way talking goes on in
our house. My parents are more
interested in saying things than
they are in talking.
Now take my father. He's a
hard guy to get along with if you
are not used to him.
Together they have this set-up
where they store up and exchange
a day's worth of information in
one shot. It takes about 15 min
utes. I can't stand it. But that's
the way my father likes to keep
things organized.
We generally eat at about six
o'clock, and it's a family thing that
we're all supposed to be together.
That's when the exchange takes
place. My father comes in the door
and he cues her, "So, how was
your day?" Then mom takes it
away.
The next night (because I
wasn't very hungry the day of the
accident) I tried to change the
usual course of events. After mom
had spun out a few paragraphs, I

asked dad, "how was your day?"
He said, "Oh, it's the same old
business over and over again." I
prodded, "Same old business?" He
persevered, "Yeah."
I figured it was going to take
more drastic measures. I interject
ed, "Isn't it funny how dad is
never willing to go to the store (ex
cept for buying hot dog rolls on the
Fourth of July), and if he does he'd
never buy cookies although he'll
hoot and holler if there are none in
the bread drawer?"
Now my mom — she gets a lit
tle excited when something unex
pected happens. She started off,
"Oh, I don't think that's the case"
and then lost her train of thought.
I tried to get back, "Oh, I do, I
think he's positively frightened."
Then dad cut into the conversa
tion and threw out converstion
stopper-number-one, "o'n you do,
do you?" Dad doesn't like talking
about himself.
Stopper number one is de
signed to interrupt any speaker
who begins a sentence with "I
think" or "I want."
Then he got us back on track
with something he must've been
saving for a rainy day. "Yeah, we
got this call in from a guy who says
he has orders in hand (it was a big
deal to be "in hand") for four Is
raeli warships and could we pro
vide the [something] for 1992."
That was a surprise. Sounded
interesting. I say, "Wow, that's re
ally interesting." He expertly ana
lyzed, "Well, ya know what's going
to happen is we're going to land in
Kuwait City ... Marines ... and
the Israelis have always been ...
and they're going to kill as many
Palestinians as they can while
they're there. It'll be three weeks
until there's a shooting war."
The hard thing about my dad's
stories is that he doesn't leave
very much to say. Still I gave it one
more try.
I started talking about McEn
roe's match. I had seen it with
mom that day. It was a good time.
We laughed, saw some amazing
tennis, especially at the net, and
had split reactions over the way
McEnroe argues.
So I said something about how
you can tell McEnroe really in
vests himself in the game by the
way he uses arguing to clear his
head.
Mom didn't go along. She said,
"He has so much talent that's just
wasted."
That irked me. Because that
was grandma talking. And I
wasn't going to let that slide. I said
"No — it's his passion for the
game."
My father must have imagined
his usually peaceful meal was
being assailed by a half-sane son
who takes art classes (I hope you
can get a job). He quickly remedied
the situation with conversation
stopper-number-two. He said,
"Well, I know you've had a hard
day."

Mark's address is P.O. Box 10071,
Stanford, CA 94309, but only for
the next month. So if you know
what the wreck of the Hesperus is,
send him the answer fast.

we're all supposed to be together.
That's when the exchange takes
place. My father comes in the door
and he cues her, "So, how was
your day?" Then mom takes it
away.
The next night (because I
wasn't very hungry the day of the
accident) I tried to change the
usual course of events. After mom
had spun out a few paragraphs, I

asked dad, "how was your day?"
He said, "Oh, it's the same old
business over and over again." I
prodded, "Same old business?" He
persevered, "Yeah."
I figured it was going to take
more drastic measures. I interject
ed, "Isn't it funny how dad is
never willing to go to the store (ex
cept for buying hot dog rolls on the
Fourth of July), and if he does he'd
never buy cookies although he'll
hoot and holler if there are none in
the bread drawer?"
Now my mom — she gets a lit
tle excited when something unex
pected happens. She started off,
"Oh, I don't think that's the case"
and then lost her train of thought.
I tried to get back, "Oh, I do, I
think he's positively frightened."
Then dad cut into the conversa
tion and threw out converstion
stopper-number-one, "o'n you do,
do you?" Dad doesn't like talking
about himself.
Stopper number one is de
signed to interrupt any speaker
who begins a sentence with "I
think" or "I want."
Then he got us back on track
with something he must've been
saving for a rainy day. "Yeah, we
got this call in from a guy who says
he has orders in hand (it was a big
deal to be "in hand") for four Is
raeli warships and could we pro
vide the [something] for 1992."
That was a surprise. Sounded
interesting. I say, "Wow, that's re
ally interesting." He expertly ana
lyzed, "Well, ya know what's going
to happen is we're going to land in
Kuwait City ... Marines ... and
the Israelis have always been ...
and they're going to kill as many
Palestinians as they can while
they're there. It'll be three weeks
until there's a shooting war."
The hard thing about my dad's
stories is that he doesn't leave
very much to say. Still I gave it one
more try.
I started talking about McEn
roe's match. I had seen it with
mom that day. It was a good time.
We laughed, saw some amazing
tennis, especially at the net, and
had split reactions over the way
McEnroe argues.
So I said something about how
you can tell McEnroe really in
vests himself in the game by the
way he uses arguing to clear his
head.
Mom didn't go along. She said,
"He has so much talent that's just
wasted."
That irked me. Because that
was grandma talking. And I
wasn't going to let that slide. I said
"No — it's his passion for the
game."
My father must have imagined
his usually peaceful meal was
being assailed by a half-sane son
who takes art classes (I hope you
can get a job). He quickly remedied
the situation with conversation
stopper-number-two. He said,
"Well, I know you've had a hard
day."

Mark's address is P.O. Box 10071,
Stanford, CA 94309, but only for
the next month. So if you know
what the wreck of the Hesperus is,
send him the answer fast.

My grandmother and my
parents live geographical
ly very close to each other.
And the truth is, they can't help
but to have other things in com
mon too.
For example, my grandmother
and my parents all have this way
of talking that instantly puts
things in their place.
My last talk with grandma was
during the last time I was really
home. It was the summer before
the gulf war. The U.S. Open was
on TV. I was rooting for Andre
Agassi. McEnroe's match was the
next day.
She saw I was interested and
told me that Agassi, who was then
the fifth-ranked men's tennis
player, looked like the wreck of the
Hesperus.
By the way, if anybody knows
what that means they should
write and tell me. Grandma also
told me, "He looks like he needs a
bath."
My mother and my father are a
little more subtle than that. But
underneath it's still the same.
Take my mother. When I got
back from the doctor there was a
sizable hole in my finger, a ban
dage wrapped around it that was
half red, and as soon as I stepped
in the door she wanted to know all
about it.
I had just spent 15-minute on
the car ride with my father back
from the doctor's — not talking.
And all I wanted to do was be alone
and work on a painting. I had set
up some space for myself in an out
of the way corner of the basement
for occasions like this.
My mother — she isn't much of
a believer in privacy. She's per
fectly willing to come bounding
through a door, even a bathroom
door, to tell me there's a phone
call.
(Still she thinks planting more
trees on the edges of our property
is a good idea.)
But even by her standards, she
had to go well out of her way to
reach me. It's not often that she
has legitimate business in the
basement.
Which means she had to have a
good reason. She found one and
used it over and over again: she
cares.
"Are you feeling all right?"
"Does it hurt much?" "How'syour
finger doing?" "I wouldn't do that
with that finger of yours." "I just
wanted to know how everything's
going." "I'm going to bed now."
She has this funny way of ask
ing the wrong kinds of questions.
She'll say, "That poison ivy of
yours, does it itch much?" Or, "O
that looks like a painting of a
shark. Can you see its teeth?"
(This is about my painting
which has nothing to do with
sharks or any other predators).
It's the way talking goes on in
our house. My parents are more
interested in saying things than
they are in talking.
Now take my father. He's a
hard guy to get along with if you
are not used to him.
Together they have this set-up
where they store up and exchange
a day's worth of information in
one shot. It takes about 15 min
utes. I can't stand it. But that's
the way my father likes to keep
things organized.
We generally eat at about six
o'clock, and it's a family thing that
we're all supposed to be together.
