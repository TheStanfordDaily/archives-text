## Election year politics breed cynicism 
### 
THE HIGHER EDUCATION Reauthorization Act
agreed upon by Congress and the Bush adminis
tration last week is a typical election-year bill.
The bill, at first glance, seems to provide more
money for existing federal loan and grant programs, as
well as include more students from middle income
families into the eligibility bracket for these programs.
In fact, legislators hailed this package as a com
promise that — at long last — pays attention to the
needs of middle income families.
But there are a lot of problems with this all-is-well
view that lawmakers seemed so eager to convey with
a unanimous Senate vote and a 419-7 House vote.
Some of the seemingly generous provisions in the
bill, for example, are extremely deceptive. The bill
would raise the maximum obtainable Pell grant, the
central plank in the federal aid platform, from $3,100 to
$3,700 a year. It would also increase the number of stu
dents eligible for the grants — by as much as a million
students in the first year, according to some estimates.
But Pell grants are likely to remain at their cur
rent levels of $2,400 a year given federal budgetary
constraints. Increasing the theoretical maximum for
the grants benefits no one if Congress will not allo
cate enough funds to pay out this maximum.
Lobbyists for student aid had campaigned to make
Pell grants an entitlement, and guarantee funding
for them. The proposal did not make it through the
legislative conference and congressional aides have
predicted that the average level of a Pell grant will
likely remain the same.
Furthermore, the American Council on Education
has argued that changes introduced by the bill in an
alyzing student need will exclude more than 200,000
unmarried students who are independent of their
parents from the program.
Instead of giving serious consideration to these es

timates, lawmakers chose to ignore the organization's
arguments, claiming their analysis models to be faulty.
And President Bush's acceptance of the bill's plan
to begin a direct loan pilot program, after he had ear
lier threatened to veto it, demonstrates his decision
to put votes ahead of policy positions.
Under the pilot program, the Department of Edu
cation must provide colleges with funds for direct
loans to eligible students.
By cutting out the middleman, the program makes
loans more accessible to students. And by tying re
payment to post-graduation income levels, students
will be free to choose professions, such as teaching,
that may not be very lucrative.
In addition, the Government Accounting Office esti
mates that using this method for all federal loans could
save the government up to $ 1.5 billion in bank subsidies.
Yet this program differs little from an earlier pro
posal that ran against the threat of a presidential veto.
The Secretary of Education had been saying that the
administrative costs of the program were too high.
The president likely accepted the bill for the same
reason congressional leaders hastened to endorse it
with such overwhelming majorities: it makes for
good campaign material.
As one analyst put it in the Chronicle of Higher
Education, the president "wants to have more than
rhetoric on his side."
Another fallacy buried in this bill lies in its disregard
for inflation rates. Financial aid advocates at Stanford
and at the state and federal levels point out that the in
creases in the bill will do little more than restore aid lev
els — in real dollars — to the levels of the early 1980s.
Students will take what they can get, but at a time
when voters seem disenchanted with this country's
political process, phony bills like the Reauthorization
Act do not help.
