Absolutes are seldom
correct; most copiers
at GSB are two-sided
To correct a statement made in
Kimberly Lawrence's letter to the
editor in the July 2 Weekly. Yes,
there is at least one single coin-op
erated copy machine on the Stan
ford campus that prints double
sided.
At least one is located in the
Jackson Library at the Graduate
School of Business. Most of the
staff copiers at the GSB also print
double-sided copies.
Absolutes are seldom correct.

U.S. should pressure
Israel for concessions
on Palestinian stance
Tariq Bujsaim's eloquent July
9 column, "Is it a New Begin
ning?" was convincingly pes

simistic about Yitzhak Rabin's in
tent to negotiate a just peace with
the Palestinians.
As Bujsaim pointed out, Rabin
is actively wooing a far right-wing
party, Tsomet, to be his partner in
the new Labor coalition.
Tsomet is headed by retired
General Rafael Eitan, the 1982
commander of the Israeli troops in
Beirut who stood by while 900
Palestinian refugees were massa
cred at Sabra and Shatila.
Eitan has referred to Palestini
ans in the occupied West Bank as
"roaches in a bottle," and Rabin
himself recently threatened to use
the "iron fist" against them.
But although pessimism is in
order, it is not enough. The new Is
raeli government will face power
ful forces within its own ranks urg
ing recognition of the Palestinians'
right to self-determination.
At the same time, Israel's crip
pled economy is more than ever
dependent on U.S. aid. The United
States can play a constructive role
in the peace process by supporting
Israeli as well as Palestinian peace
activists and by refusing to subsi
dize continued repression of the
Palestinians.

At a minimum, we should insist
that before it receives more aid, Is
rael must stop seizing Palestinian
land for new settlements; stop the
torture of Palestinian prisoners;
disband the death squads that
roam the West Bank disguised as
Arabs; allow Palestinian schools to
remain open without interruption;
and permit Palestinians to dig irri
gation wells, build homes for their
families, and go about their daily
lives without crippling restrictions.
Only by taking these and simi
lar steps can Israel demonstrate
its sincerity in seeking peaceful co
existence with the Palestinians
and legitimately ask the Palestini
ans, in turn, to end their protests.
