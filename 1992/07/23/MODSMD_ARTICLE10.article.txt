Pediatric cuts irk
student parents
With the final days of Cowell's
pediatric services rapidly ap
proaching, both graduate students
and Cowell administrators are
working to minimize the inconve
niences of the short-notice transi
tion.
Beginning Aug. 1, the Medical
School's Faculty Practice Pro
gram — Cowell's current pedi
atric care provider — will no
longer serve student families at
Cowell, but instead has arranged
to continue offering on-campus
pediatric care through the pedi
atric group of Harvey, Ball and
Sharron on Welch Road.
Low numbers of patients,
which created budgetary short
falls, forced Cowell to discontinue
the program.
Officials at Cowell said no for
mal agreements on discount rates
or other exclusive provisions have
been made with the private prac
tice. They emphasized that the
Welch Road group is merely being
offered as an immediate and near
by alternative, and students are
free to choose to go elsewhere for
pediatric care.
Many graduate students are
now scrambling to explore their
options, trying to gather data on
different practices and clinics in
the area. And while they held a
town meeting last Thursday to
discuss their concerns with ad
ministrators and learn more about
the changes, many students said
they still don't feel adequately in
formed about the current situa
tion.
"We're still in a bit of a vacuum
as to what our options might be,"
said graduate student Keith
Hampson, noting that administra
tors at the meeting provided stu
dents with few concrete facts on
the logistics of the transition.
At the meeting, which was at
tended by about 45 parents, ad
ministrators said they were still
uncertain about what would hap
pen to Cowell's low-cost immu
nization service — which would
not be available at the Welch Road
practice — and other specific mea
sures pertaining to cost and ac
cess.
Cowell administrators are now
planning to relocate the immu
nization service to Escondido Vil
lage, offering it twice a month
through Cowell nurses and the
FPP, said Jane Meier, associate
director of Cowell. But details
have not yet been finalized, she
added.
Administrators at Cowell may
also consider efforts to expand
the Marguerite shuttle bus ser
vice for student families. Cur
rently, mid-day shuttles go di
rectly to the the Harvey, Ball and
Sharron group on Welch Road,
while shuttles at other times drop
passengers off at the corner of
Welch and Quarry.
Several students walked out of
the meeting, shaking their heads
in disappointment and frustra
tion. Many said the meeting
proved largely ineffective because
most of the decisions had already
been made by July 2, without their
input. For many of them, the
meeting was their first chance to
speak with Cowell administrators
about the decision.
While Cowell administrators
originally "did not want to unduly
burden" parents about the uncer
tain future of Cowell's pediatric
services, Meier said that in retro
spect, they should hav6 included
parents in the decision-making
process.
Handouts regarding options
for pediatric care and prices will
soon be released by Cowell, ac
cording to Meier. Pediatric nurse
Mitzi Van Sant will be visiting
area pediatric providers with par
ents and helping them evaluate
their options.
Although parents were initially
informed that six pediatrians
would be available at the new loca

tion, several parents who have
called the Welch Road practice
said they found only two are cur
rently taking more patients.
According to Dr. Gary Sharron,
however, the fluctuation of avail
able pediatricians is nothing un
usual. He said the number of pedi
atricians in the group who are
available at a particular tin?, is
usually about three or four.
While physicians at Cowell and
FPP have assured parents that pe
diatric fees at the Harvey, Ball and
Sharron group are comparable to
those offered at Cowell, some stu
dents dispute this claim.
"Prices are tremendously dif
ferent," said Escondido Village
resident Debbie Abma, who said
she has compared Cowell fees with
the private practices'.
Abma said that without a guar
antee of affordability, Cowell's de
cision to close its doors is a "giant
leap backwards."
FPP's choice to offer pediatric
care through the Harvey, Ball and
Sharron group comes from a pre
vious arrangement in which the
group has agreed to see FPP fami
lies, according to John Dorman,
director of public relations at Cow
ell.
FPP was awarded a three-year
contract to provide Cowell with pe
diatric services last fall, replacing
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic as the
•provider of pediatric care at Cow
ell. But the program proved to be
financially unsuccessful after a
year, falling short by about
$50,000.
But many parents contend that
had Cowell made a better effort to
market their pediatric services
and obtain new patients, there
would have been a sufficient clien
tele to support the program.
Meier said the tenuous situa
tion of Cowell's pediatric services
this year and in the past made it
difficult to market the service well.
Nevertheless, many parents
said they feel betrayed by the sud
den change.
"Cowell's promise of service
doesn't exactly excite me," said
Mary Lea McAnally, a doctoral
student in the Business School.
Unsatisfied with the course of
events, a group of parents orga
nized the Stanford Children's
Health Task Force, an official
group working to reinstate Cow
ell's pediatric practices.
According to McAnally, one of
the task force's members, the
group is currently searching for
local physicians or residents who
would be willing to set up their
practice at Cowell or to work at
Cowell a few days a week.
The task force, consisting of a
core of six parents, is also planning
to bring their concerns to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
And beginning in August, the
group will start a door-to-door
campaign at Escondido Village to
reinstate Cowell's pediatric ser
vices.

Arson might have
caused brush fires
Arson is the likely cause of
three small brush fires near the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter during the last week, Palo Alto
Fire Department investigators
said Tuesday.
The three fires, each less than
one acre, burned in unincorporat
ed areas of San Mateo County that
border property owned by Stan
ford. No structures were damaged
and no injuries were reporterd as a
result of the fires.
The first blaze, which occurred
last Friday, singed a grassy area
along Alpine Road.
Fire investigators discovered a
pair of matches at the scene which
they believe is related to the cause
of the fire, said fire investigator
Jim Timko.
The second fire started at 4:30
p.m. on Monday, near the intersec
tion of Junipero Serra and Alpine
Roads. Firefighters from Palo
Alto, Menlo Park and Woodside
controlled the blaze in 15 minutes
and no damages were reported,
said Palo Alto Fire Capt. Mick
MacDonald.
The closure of Alpine Road
near the fire snarled evening traf
fic in the area for hours as fire
crews and investigators worked at
the scene.
On Tuesday, local fire crews re
sponded to a third fire outside the
rear gate of SLAC which burned

about 100 square yards before
being brought under control.
All three fires were within a
short distance of each other, a fact
that investigators find concern
ing.
"These fires are very suspi
cious," said MacDonald. "We've
ruled out lightning, and to have
these three fires started by cat
alytic converters is pretty doubt
ful."
He said all the fires have been
dangerous because of their prox
imity to residential areas and
roads. Friday's fire came within 20
feet of a house, MacDonald said.
He cites training exercises and
rapid responses from local fire dis
tricts as reasons why the blazes
were controlled so quickly.
MacDonald said while these
fires are not related to the fire in
the Foothills, which blackened
more than 500 acres two weeks
ago, they may be linked to recent
blazes in Woodside. Investigators
have come close to determining
the cause of the Foothills blaze
and arson is not suspected, he
said.
Timko, who is investigating all
four fires, said a preliminary re
port detailing the cause of the
Foothills fire would be released
next week.

Blomquist pleads
not guilty
Daniel Blomquist, an assistant
manager in the Controller's Of
fice, and his wife, Ethyl
Blomquist, pleaded not guilty July
20 to charges of endangering their
son's life and causing him unjusti
fiable pain and suffering.
Daniel Blomquist has also
pleaded not guilty to a charge of in
flicting great bodily ir\jury on his
son.
Although the Blomquists were
arrested and arraigned separately,
the cases have now been combined
for further prosecution.
If convicted, the father and
mother could serve nine-year and
six-year prison terms, respective
ly-
Steven Blomquist, 10, remains
at Lucile Salter Packard Chil
dren's Hospital where he was ad
mitted in late June, suffering from
severe malnutrition and related
complications.
He is recovering and currently
in good condition, according to
hospital officals. No release date
has been set.
According to police documents,

Daniel Blomquist said he spanked
Steven severely each evening in an
effort to curb his son's unruly be
havior and help him keep his food
down. The boy's buttocks, black
with bruises, were left with scabs
from the beatings.
Religious fanaticism apparent
ly prompted the punishments.
Blomquist told police his actions
were specified in the Bible.
Cynthia Sevely, prosecuting at
torney for Santa Clara County,
said she expects the case to settle
before moving to trial. Daniel
Blomquist's confession is on file
with police. According to Sevely,
98 percent of similar cases do not
go to trial but result in plea bar
gains.
The Blomquists are permitted
to enter a change of plea when
they return to court on July 29 for
a prelimary setting, where they
will receive a date for their prelim
inary hearing.
Police were first alerted to
Steven's condition when neigh
bors saw the parents carry their
son outside on a chaise lounge to
get some sun. The boy appeared
sick for months, said neighbors.
During an initial investigation
in April, police found no indication
of child abuse. But in late June,
paramedics were called to the
Campbell residence and found
Steven near death.
Following his hospitalization,
arrest warrants were issued for
the Blomquists.
According to police, the family's
health care was provided by holis
tic practitioners, not medical doc
tors. The Blomquists' children
were educated at their home,
which was licensed as a private
school.

Stanford defends
fund-raising drives
A national association repre
senting college fundraisers recent
ly criticized large fund-raising
campaigns such as Stanford's $1.3
billion Centennial Campaign, but
University officials refute the crit
icisms and do not intend to alter
their fund-raising practices.
Peter Buchanan, president of
the Council for Advancement and
Support of Education, recently
lambasted the campaigns at the
council's annual meeting, calling
the mega-drives "the dumbest
thing I've ever seen," according to
the Chronicle of Higher Educa-


Brian Bedell - Weekly
Palo Alto Fire Investigator Bob Brouchoud looks for clues at the site of a "suspicious" grass fire along
Alpine Road last Monday.
tion.
Buchanan claims that large dri
ves require an unwarranted
amount of energy by university of
ficials and cause the public to be
come skeptical about why an edu
cational institution needs so much
money.
Buchanan also cited the futility
of promoting a campaign, only to
shut it down, knowing that the in
stitution will "crank it up again"
under a different guise. He favors
developing and then maintaining
the fund-raising momentum gen
erated during the campaigns.
Stanford officials disagree with
Buchanan's position in light of the
success of the University's Cen
tennial Campaign, which exceeded
its goal of $1.1 billion by $167 mil
lion.
"Stanford's campaign experi
ences show Buchanan's observa
tions do not ring true," said
Stephen Peeps, associate vice
president of the Office of Develop
ment.
Peeps regards campaigns as an
"invaluable focal point." A contin
uous fund-raising effort is limit
ing, while a campaign is "vision
raising" and "emotionally engag
ing," he said.
Peeps said campaigns are im
portant because they create an
awareness of Stanford among its
alumni and friends, allowing the
concerns and ambitions of the
University to reach the potential
donors more easily, he said.
For example, residential educa
tion and undergraduate housing
are necessary for Stanford to pur
sue its educational goals but with
out a campaign it is difficult to
convince donors to fund such
needs, Peeps said.
Peeps explained that a cam
paign allows the University to ask
for more unrestricted gifts —
funds not earmarked for specific
purposes.
Individual and corporate
donors are more receptive to the

idea of unrestricted gifts during a
period when the apparent necessi
ty is publicized.
Peeps said campaigns are re
sponsible for much more than en
couraging gifts. During the Cen
tennial Campaign, the primary
academic goals of the University
were reviewed. It was an opportu
nity for "self-assessment and in
ternal change," he said.
Elaine Battles, director of the
Annual Fund at the Office of De
velopment, said a campaign helps
many non-donors make their first
contribution. It also encourages
regular donors to increase the
amount of their gifts, she said.
Battles said the Centennial
Campaign was very successful in
both areas. The Campaign also in
spired many new volunteers to
serve the University, she said.
"The Campaign brought the
University to a new fund-raising
plateau," Peeps said.

Rush policy to
stay unchanged
Despite three alcohol-related
incidents during last spring's
Rush, policies for the two-week
fraternity-recruiting event will re
main relatively unchanged, ac
cording to Fraternal Affairs Advis
er Heather Dunn.
However, one fraternity will be
required to write a letter of apolo
gy, and all three involved must
sponsor a common bring-your
own-beer party to set a positive ex
ample for the Greek community,
Dunn said.
Because the three incidents oc
curred when Rush was not re
quired to be alcohol-free, the fra
ternities did not violate any Rush
rules, she said.
The Interfraternity Council
sanctioned dry Rush is held Mon
day through Thursday for three
weeks, but the rules allow frater
nities to sponsor events with alco
hol during the weekends.

Any changes in Rush policy
need to come from within the
Greek system and from its mem
bers, she said.
The three fraternities who were
involved in the incidents and re
sulting complaints were Sigma
Nu, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and
Sigma Chi.
A letter from Portola State
Park Ranger Carl Burger to the
University accused the SAE and
Sigma Nu fraternities of several
"penal and California code viola
tions" — including illegal alcohol
use, vandalism and littering — at
separate April 25 retreats.
When confronted for playing
soccer on protected lands, the
Sigma Nus stopped their game,
but the letter cited specific inci
dences of damage caused by the
SAEs.
The SAEs' "progressively
worsening behavior" was finally
halted at 4 a.m. when rangers
doused their fire and commanded
them to clean up their campsite.
In a separate incident, the
Sigma Chi fraternity was caught
with minors drinking from a keg
in a road-bound van, Dunn said.
The SAEs are required to write
a letter of apology to the park by
Dec. 1, and all three fraternities
must sponsor a common bring
your-own-beer party in order to
learn the "responsible manage
ment" of alcohol, Dunn said.
Ways to curb alcohol-related
problems and promote a responsi
ble Rush will be addressed by the
fraternity system in an "honest
and forthright manner," Dunn
said.
The action of "each fraternity
reflects on the whole Greek sys
tem," Dunn said. She added that it
is unfortunate that one fraternity
can taint the image of a responsi
ble system.
Recent changes in Stanford's
alcohol policy as well as societal
changes are responsible for a de
crease in "students ending up at
the police station or hospital" as a
result of alcohol,.she said.

Dunn said she does not foresee
any "raids coming down the pike,"
but added she expects "additional
changes in the format of hosting
parties."
"The 'Animal House' mentality
will not be tolerated on campus or
anywhere else," Dunn said. She
said the University continues to

treat students as adults and ex
pects them to comply with the law
She said she hopes a leader
ship retreat planned for Septem
ber will provide a forum to con
tinue developing an understand
ing of expectations and responsi
bilities.
