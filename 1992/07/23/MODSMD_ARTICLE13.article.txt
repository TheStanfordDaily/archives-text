# Budget cuts may cripple campus libraries
## An increasing number of profs fear the fiscal crisis will damage stacks and services 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Edward Courtney, a Classics professor
who has been at Stanford for the past
15 years, worries that his "laborato
ry" — Stanford's library system — is falling
apart.
Courtney is among a growing number of
professors who fear that the enormous budget
cuts the library system faces will inevitably
have a long-term effect, threatening their abil
ity to do top-quality research at Stanford.
"It poses the danger of Stanford ceasing
to be a msyor research library," says English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz. "You have to acquire
all the important books that people in your
field believe should be in the library — and
the definition of importance will shift with
the pressure of the budget."
Jarred by cuts that will slice a quarter of
its budget by fall 1993, the library system
has eliminated Meyer Library's reference
desk and most of the periodicals and books in
its collection; closed the Food Research In
stitute's library ; sharply cut back the num
ber of books and journals it buys; and plans
to lay ofT 67 people beginning in September.
"Being in the Classics department, I am a
humanist," Courtney says."The library is
therefore my laboratory. Scientists would
not put up with a laboratory being run on a
shoestring, as my laboratory is."
The cuts, Courtney says, will make it
"very difficult to do serious humanistic re
search at Stanford" — and it is getting hard
er already, he adds.
As a result of the cuts, many professors
and researchers say, the book collection is
gradually becoming less comprehensive, de
veloping damaging gaps in some areas. And
the library simply works more slowly —
processes that once took days now some
times take weeks, they say.
"I think the library will fall behind," says
Asst. Philosophy Prof. Rachel Cohon.
"There's going to be a pretty rapid loss of
quality compared with other good universi
ty libraries."
Courtney and other professors believe

that Libraries and Informa
tion Resources — the vice
presidential area that in
cludes the library system —
should have been given
higher priority as the Uni
versity debated ways to cut
its budget by $43 million.
Already hit hard by a 16
percent cut during "reposi
tioning" last year, the li
braries were eventually
forced to slash another $3.1
million, or 10 percent, in the
most recent round of cuts.
Asked what effect the
cuts will ultimately have on
the libraries, Frederick
Biedenweg — the assistant
vice president who supervis
es library planning — is
blunt. "What do you think?"
he says. "Less service."
The problems created
by the repositioning
cuts, which went into

effect this past year, were at their peak in
mid-March, professors and librarians say.
Green Library, understaffed and under
managed, was unable to keep its books on
the shelves. Rows of carts, filled with books
that staffers had not had time to shelve,
piled up downstairs.
"It was preposterous," says Philosophy
Prof. Wilbur Knorr. "Books were getting
lost in the storage system. I got into the
habit of not returning books — I figured I
might have to look at them again."
Administrators say the problem was
symptomatic of the cuts the library
system has been forced to bear. "We knew
when we took those cuts that we would have
to do some fine-tuning later on," Biedenweg
says.
But he adds that since April, when ad
ministrators decided to shift staffers from
Meyer Library to Green Library to help
shelve books, "the problem is mostly

solved."
Larry Dahl, head
of Green's Stack Di
vision, agrees. "We're
actually doing better
than we were a few
months ago," he says.
"We haven't had any
backlogs like we had
in February and
March."
But he cautions
that at the current
level, his division is
"basically staying

above water." As long as "they don't do any
thing drastic to us," Dahl says, "we'll be able
to keep the books on the shelves."
Whether or not reshelving re-emerges as
a problem this fall, when the number of
users returns to its regular levels, libraiy
administrators say other disruptions in ser
vice remain a possibility.
Although "every individual who has been
affected" by the cuts has been notified,
Biedenweg says the scheduled layoffs have
not actually taken effect yet — they will be
made in two rounds, beginning Sept. 1 of

'Books were getting lost in
the storage system. I got

ing books — I figured I
might have to look at them
again.'

this year and Sept. 1 of next year.
"People are still here, in many cases,
doing their jobs," Biedenweg says, adding
that "it will be hard to assess the impact of
the cuts" until the layoffs actually begin.
And Biedenweg is especially concerned
about the effects of earthquake repair in
Green, which will force the closure of sever
al sections of Green while remodeling is
done, beginning this year.
Administrators have plans to create a
temporary "satellite library" on Serra
Street and move "a large number of collec
tions there for three or four years" while the
earthquake-damaged west wing of Green is
rebuilt, Biedenweg says.
At the same time, 65 employees in
Green's technical services department in
the west wing will be moved to the fourth
floor of Meyer — which will have only one
floor housing books next year, as most of its
collection has been moved to Green.

"The tremen
dous dislocations
associated with this
move are going to
cause bigger service
problems" than
many that currently
trouble professors
and researchers,
Biedenweg says.
But he adds that
"we have some good
things going on,
too." noting that the
libraries' plan for au-

tomated circulation is proceeding on sched
ule. By the end 0f1993, Green library should
be completely automated, Biedenweg says.
Library administrators attempted to
make cuts in ways that will allow them to
develop library technology, according to
Biedenweg. But several professors say they
still worry that Stanford's technology may
fall behind.
"Stanford is, in spite of what some people
like to tell us, not at the cutting edge of li
brary technology," says History Prof. Mark
Mancall. "The real question is whether

these cuts will prevent Stanford from mov
ing up to the cutting edge."
But Biedenweg says the libraries recently
opened a series of new databases on Folio, the
computerized library access system, which
will improve patrons' access to materials.
And the libraries will continue to "make
investments in the future" in areas such as
"access to information, document delivery,
and enhancing the (computer) network,"
Biedenweg says. Electronic databases and
"mechanisms to deliver them efficiently, in
a timely manner" will be a priority, accord
ing to Biedenweg.
Many of the problems that professors
cite when discussing the library
cuts at first seem like minor incon
veniences. It takes longer to get books and
periodicals, they say. Books are mislabelled
or misplaced, apparently by staffers pressed
for time. Some books, listed as available,
mysteriously disappear.
Lines at the reference desk are longer.
The microfilm readers, eliminated at Meyer,
are booked solid at Green because under
graduates can no longer work at Meyer.
But all of those apparently trifling exam
ples, many professors say, combine to create
a frustrating experience — one that some
times leads them to give up and go elsewhere.
Cohon says she was recently looking for a
book she needed, onhr to discover that the
one copy of the book "had disappeared and it
was not being replaced."
"I ended up going to a used bookstore and
buying myself a copy," Cohon says, adding,
"This was not an obscure book; it was a book
that was in print."
Many professors say they fear for the
long term, when cuts in the libraries' bud
get for acquiring new books and journals
may begin to take their toll on the quality of
Stanford's collections.
Although the University allowed the li
braries a 9 percent increase in its budget for
library materials, Biedenweg says journal
prices have been rising at more than double
that rate — 23 percent. And the University
asked the libraries to cut $450,000 from its

acquisitions budget, "a sub
stantial hit," Biedenweg
says.
If researchers "are de
pending on books that are
current," Rebholz says,
their work may be hindered
as gaps in acquisitions be
come apparent in the next
few years. He fears that as
budgetary constraints come
into focus, "books that had
been formerly regarded as
important will not be ac
quired because it takes
money to acquire them."
As library officials make
choices about what they can
afford in the next few years,
Rebholz worries that they
will allow the budget to over
shadow what should be
purely academic considera
tions. "The professional
judgement," he says, "will be
skewed somewhat by the
lack of money."

Meyer Library to Green Library to help
shelve books, "the problem is mostly

solved."
Larry Dahl, head
of Green's Stack Di
vision, agrees. "We're
actually doing better
than we were a few
months ago," he says.
"We haven't had any
backlogs like we had
in February and
March."
But he cautions
that at the current
level, his division is
"basically staying

above water." As long as "they don't do any
thing drastic to us," Dahl says, "we'll be able
to keep the books on the shelves."
Whether or not reshelving re-emerges as
a problem this fall, when the number of
users returns to its regular levels, libraiy
administrators say other disruptions in ser
vice remain a possibility.
Although "every individual who has been
affected" by the cuts has been notified,
Biedenweg says the scheduled layoffs have
not actually taken effect yet — they will be
made in two rounds, beginning Sept. 1 of

ing books — I figured I

this year and Sept. 1 of next year.
"People are still here, in many cases,
doing their jobs," Biedenweg says, adding
that "it will be hard to assess the impact of
the cuts" until the layoffs actually begin.
And Biedenweg is especially concerned
about the effects of earthquake repair in
Green, which will force the closure of sever
al sections of Green while remodeling is
done, beginning this year.
Administrators have plans to create a
temporary "satellite library" on Serra
Street and move "a large number of collec
tions there for three or four years" while the
earthquake-damaged west wing of Green is
rebuilt, Biedenweg says.
At the same time, 65 employees in
Green's technical services department in
the west wing will be moved to the fourth
floor of Meyer — which will have only one
floor housing books next year, as most of its
collection has been moved to Green.

"The tremen
dous dislocations
associated with this
move are going to
cause bigger service
problems" than
many that currently
trouble professors
and researchers,
Biedenweg says.
But he adds that
"we have some good
things going on,
too." noting that the
libraries' plan for au-

tomated circulation is proceeding on sched
ule. By the end 0f1993, Green library should
be completely automated, Biedenweg says.
Library administrators attempted to
make cuts in ways that will allow them to
develop library technology, according to
Biedenweg. But several professors say they
still worry that Stanford's technology may
fall behind.
"Stanford is, in spite of what some people
like to tell us, not at the cutting edge of li
brary technology," says History Prof. Mark
Mancall. "The real question is whether

these cuts will prevent Stanford from mov
ing up to the cutting edge."
But Biedenweg says the libraries recently
opened a series of new databases on Folio, the
computerized library access system, which
will improve patrons' access to materials.
And the libraries will continue to "make
investments in the future" in areas such as
"access to information, document delivery,
and enhancing the (computer) network,"
Biedenweg says. Electronic databases and
"mechanisms to deliver them efficiently, in
a timely manner" will be a priority, accord
ing to Biedenweg.
Many of the problems that professors
cite when discussing the library
cuts at first seem like minor incon
veniences. It takes longer to get books and
periodicals, they say. Books are mislabelled
or misplaced, apparently by staffers pressed
for time. Some books, listed as available,
mysteriously disappear.
Lines at the reference desk are longer.
The microfilm readers, eliminated at Meyer,
are booked solid at Green because under
graduates can no longer work at Meyer.
But all of those apparently trifling exam
ples, many professors say, combine to create
a frustrating experience — one that some
times leads them to give up and go elsewhere.
Cohon says she was recently looking for a
book she needed, onhr to discover that the
one copy of the book "had disappeared and it
was not being replaced."
"I ended up going to a used bookstore and
buying myself a copy," Cohon says, adding,
"This was not an obscure book; it was a book
that was in print."
Many professors say they fear for the
long term, when cuts in the libraries' bud
get for acquiring new books and journals
may begin to take their toll on the quality of
Stanford's collections.
Although the University allowed the li
braries a 9 percent increase in its budget for
library materials, Biedenweg says journal
prices have been rising at more than double
that rate — 23 percent. And the University
asked the libraries to cut $450,000 from its

acquisitions budget, "a sub
stantial hit," Biedenweg
says.
If researchers "are de
pending on books that are
current," Rebholz says,
their work may be hindered
as gaps in acquisitions be
come apparent in the next
few years. He fears that as
budgetary constraints come
into focus, "books that had
been formerly regarded as
important will not be ac
quired because it takes
money to acquire them."
As library officials make
choices about what they can
afford in the next few years,
Rebholz worries that they
will allow the budget to over
shadow what should be
purely academic considera
tions. "The professional
judgement," he says, "will be
skewed somewhat by the
lack of money."

Graduate student Christian Meyers studies for a class among the scantily stacked periodical section In Meyer Library last fall quarter.
Edward Courtney, a Classics professor
who has been at Stanford for the past
15 years, worries that his "laborato
ry" — Stanford's library system — is falling
apart.
Courtney is among a growing number of
professors who fear that the enormous budget
cuts the library system faces will inevitably
have a long-term effect, threatening their abil
ity to do top-quality research at Stanford.
"It poses the danger of Stanford ceasing
to be a msyor research library," says English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz. "You have to acquire
all the important books that people in your
field believe should be in the library — and
the definition of importance will shift with
the pressure of the budget."
Jarred by cuts that will slice a quarter of
its budget by fall 1993, the library system
has eliminated Meyer Library's reference
desk and most of the periodicals and books in
its collection; closed the Food Research In
stitute's library ; sharply cut back the num
ber of books and journals it buys; and plans
to lay ofT 67 people beginning in September.
"Being in the Classics department, I am a
humanist," Courtney says."The library is
therefore my laboratory. Scientists would
not put up with a laboratory being run on a
shoestring, as my laboratory is."
The cuts, Courtney says, will make it
"very difficult to do serious humanistic re
search at Stanford" — and it is getting hard
er already, he adds.
As a result of the cuts, many professors
and researchers say, the book collection is
gradually becoming less comprehensive, de
veloping damaging gaps in some areas. And
the library simply works more slowly —
processes that once took days now some
times take weeks, they say.
"I think the library will fall behind," says
Asst. Philosophy Prof. Rachel Cohon.
"There's going to be a pretty rapid loss of
quality compared with other good universi
ty libraries."
Courtney and other professors believe

that Libraries and Informa
tion Resources — the vice
presidential area that in
cludes the library system —
should have been given
higher priority as the Uni
versity debated ways to cut
its budget by $43 million.
Already hit hard by a 16
percent cut during "reposi
tioning" last year, the li
braries were eventually
forced to slash another $3.1
million, or 10 percent, in the
most recent round of cuts.
Asked what effect the
cuts will ultimately have on
the libraries, Frederick
Biedenweg — the assistant
vice president who supervis
es library planning — is
blunt. "What do you think?"
he says. "Less service."
The problems created
by the repositioning
cuts, which went into

effect this past year, were at their peak in
mid-March, professors and librarians say.
Green Library, understaffed and under
managed, was unable to keep its books on
the shelves. Rows of carts, filled with books
that staffers had not had time to shelve,
piled up downstairs.
"It was preposterous," says Philosophy
Prof. Wilbur Knorr. "Books were getting
lost in the storage system. I got into the
habit of not returning books — I figured I
might have to look at them again."
Administrators say the problem was
symptomatic of the cuts the library
system has been forced to bear. "We knew
when we took those cuts that we would have
to do some fine-tuning later on," Biedenweg
says.
But he adds that since April, when ad
ministrators decided to shift staffers from
Meyer Library to Green Library to help
shelve books, "the problem is mostly

this year and Sept. 1 of next year.

cite when discussing the library
cuts at first seem like minor incon
veniences. It takes longer to get books and
periodicals, they say. Books are mislabelled
or misplaced, apparently by staffers pressed
for time. Some books, listed as available,
mysteriously disappear.
Lines at the reference desk are longer.
The microfilm readers, eliminated at Meyer,
are booked solid at Green because under
graduates can no longer work at Meyer.
But all of those apparently trifling exam
ples, many professors say, combine to create
a frustrating experience — one that some
times leads them to give up and go elsewhere.
Cohon says she was recently looking for a
book she needed, onhr to discover that the
one copy of the book "had disappeared and it
was not being replaced."
"I ended up going to a used bookstore and
buying myself a copy," Cohon says, adding,
"This was not an obscure book; it was a book
that was in print."
Many professors say they fear for the
long term, when cuts in the libraries' bud
get for acquiring new books and journals
may begin to take their toll on the quality of
Stanford's collections.
Although the University allowed the li
braries a 9 percent increase in its budget for
library materials, Biedenweg says journal
prices have been rising at more than double
that rate — 23 percent. And the University
asked the libraries to cut $450,000 from its

acquisitions budget, "a sub
stantial hit," Biedenweg
says.
If researchers "are de
pending on books that are
current," Rebholz says,
their work may be hindered
as gaps in acquisitions be
come apparent in the next
few years. He fears that as
budgetary constraints come
into focus, "books that had
been formerly regarded as
important will not be ac
quired because it takes
money to acquire them."
As library officials make
choices about what they can
afford in the next few years,
Rebholz worries that they
will allow the budget to over
shadow what should be
purely academic considera
tions. "The professional
judgement," he says, "will be
skewed somewhat by the
lack of money."
