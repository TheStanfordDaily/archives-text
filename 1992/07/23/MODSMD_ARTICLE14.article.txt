# BARCELONA 1992
## SIMMER GAMES CARDINAL TURNS TO GOLD 
### Noah Blake Editorial staff 
They have all practiced on the Farm for countless
hours. Every day, in the cold, wee hours of the
morning, swimmers Summer Sanders, Jenny
Thompson and Jeff Rouse have swum innumerable laps
in DeGuerre pool.
On the hot, afternoon track in the Stadium, Jackie Eld
wards has run wind sprints and perfected her long jump
eveiy afternoon for the past four years.
In the cages behind Sunken Diamond, Jeffrey Ham
monds, Willie Adams and Rick Helling have hit and
pitched baseballs until their hands and arms needed to be
soaked in ice.
And in the dark, musty confines of old Roble Gym,
fencer Nick Bravin has spent hours on end behind a mesh
mask jousting with his foil. But now, in time-honored tra
dition, these athletes and many others who wear the car
dinal and white will put their dedication and practice to
the test in the Games of the 25th Olympiad.
All in all, 32 indivduals associated with Stanford are
going to Barcelona — a delegation widely believed to be
the largest of any university in the world, and certainly
larger than many small countries.

In fact, if Cardinal athletes perform as well as expect
ed and if Stanford were a country unto itaelf, the Farm
might easily make the top-twenty list of medal winning
nations.
But athletic success is nothing new to Stanford. In
1988, incoming freshman Janet Evans was the star of the
Seoul games, winning four golds and a bronze. In this
past year, Cardinal teams have won five NCAA Division I
team championships, tying a national record.
"I think Stanford is one of the truly great institutions
in the world," says Stanford women's swimming coach
Richard Quick, who will be an assistant swimming coach
in Barcelona."The standards set in academics and ath
letics are unparalleled."
Not all of Stanford's competitors are fresh off the
Farm, though. Many graduated years ago — but
their attachment to Stanford has not waned.
Pablo Morales may be the Cardinal's most incredible
Olympian. In 1984, he won a gold and two silvers in Los
Angeles. In 1988, he didn't even make the Olympic team,
and it seemed like his career was over for sure.
Now, at the ripe old age of 27, Pablo is back after
spending the last year training on the Farm. In a sport
where youth is king, this living legend has a great chance

to medal in the 100 butterfly.
In another sport where being young ia usually an ad
vantage, PattiSue Plumer and Regina Jacobs beat the
clock and made the U.S. trad: team. Plumer and Jacobs
will run side by side in the 1500 meters, and Plumer will
also compete in the 3000.
Kim Oden will also be strutting her stuff in Barcelona.
Kim and her sister Elaina (who didn't go to Stanford) are
the first sibling combination in history to compete in
women's Olympic volleyball.
Oden, who was a four-time All-American and a na
tional Player of the Year, would like nothing better than
to add a gold medal to her list of accomplishments.
Scott Fortune already has a gold medal, which he won in
Seoul as a member of the U.S. men's volleyball team. For
tune was one of the younger members of the 1988 team, but
in Barcelona he will be a team leader as the U.S. goes for
back to back golds. And don't forget Andrew Vlahov, who
will be bumping and dunking for the Australian hoops
team.
In addition to student participation, a number of Stan
ford coaches, including men's volleyball coach Fred
Sturm and men's soccer coach Colin Lindores, will be
leading United States teams in Barcelona.

Olympic glory will not necessarily end with
medal-winning performances in Barcelona.
Success in Spain will assuredly translate into
personal financial windfalls for athletes and also serve
to enhance Stanford's recruiting program.
Sanders decided last April to quit the Stanford swim
ming team so that she would be able to avoid the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association's stringent regu
lation of athletic endorsements. A good performance
this summer could translate into a seven-figure income
from endorsements, say many advertising experts.
In addition, Olympic success for Cardinal athletes
could significantly help Cardinal recruiting, according
to Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland.
"It gives us tremendous visibility," Leland said, "and
visibility always helps in recruiting."
While Leland thinks that this visibility helps Stanford
athletics in general, he specifically singled out swimming
as a sport where recruiting could be greatly impacted.
But beyond recruiting gains, Leland sees an even
greater benefit in Stanford athletes participating in the
Olympics. "It's the culmination of a lot of work on part of
the coach and athlete," Leland said, "and that's a wonder
ful thing."

Jackie Edwards

Most people would call becoming
an Olympian at 17 "peaking too
soon."
But most people don't know the
talent of Jackie Edwards.
This list may include Edwards her
self. She called her third place perfor
mance in the triple jump at the NCAA
Indoor Championships "a surprise."
But while none may know her full
potential, her feats show tremendous
capabilities.

The Bahamian National Team member finished first at
this year's NCAA Championships in the long jump, her
Olympic event. She had a leap of 21' 7 1/2", which is still
short of her career best 21' 8 3/4", set at last year's NCAA
Championships. She also placed 10th in the event in last
year's World Championships.
Edwards established herself as a top triple jumper, fin
ishing second at this season's NCAA Championships with
a 43' 4 1/2" effort. Early on in her Stanford career, it ap
peared that Edwards might have peaked too soon. She
could only muster long jumps of 20' 1" and 20' 5" in fresh
man and sophomore seasons, respectively. This is in con
trast to the 20' 7" long jump best she established before
she had set foot on the Stanford Stadium runway.
But things began to turn around for her in her junior
campaign. The best long jumper in Stanford history fin
ished second in that event in the Pacific 10 Championships
in 1991. She won the triple jump at the same competition.
Then, she finished second in the nation in the long jump.
So, the critics may have been right about Jackie Ed
wards. She just might have peaked too soon. But, there is
a funny thing about great athletes.
They just seem to have more peaks.

Lea Loveless

For Lea Loveless, deciding where to
attend college after a sensational high
school evHrnming career was the hardest
decision she's ever had to make. And she
had to make it twice.
A highly recruited backstroker com
ing out of high school in Crestwood,
New York, three years ago, Loveless
narrowed her choices to Florida, Stan
ford and California before finally set
tling on Florida.
A bad move, she discovered a year

later. Florida's coach, Randy Reese, quit after her freshman
season; several of her teammates then decided to leave, drop
ping Florida from serious contention for the national title.
"Probably the first thing I said was that I should have gone
to Stanford in the first place," Loveless said. She transferred
to the Farm and redshirted dining the 1991 season, as re
quired by NCAA regulations.
Sitting out a year was hard, said Loveless, who calls team
competition "the best aspect" of swimming. "It makes you ap
preciate it more, makes you want to take advantage of every
opportunity you have," she said.
Last season, in her first year of Stanford eligibility, Love
less carved out a niche for herself on the nation's perenially
top-ranked swim team. Competing in the 100 and 200-yard
backstroke, Loveless won the Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship in both events, and a national championship in the
100 backstroke.
She was also a member of Stanford's 400-yard medley relay
team, which easily outpaced UCLA to win the national title.
In the Olympics, Loveless is not favored to win a medal in
her two events, the 100 and 200-meter backstroke. But she
may qualify for a spot on the 400-meter medley relay team,
which is nearly guaranteed to win a gold.

Jair Lynch

You hate to have doubts about a tal
ented athlete, but there were some
doubts about Jair Lynch. Most were
minor objections, but one was more lin
gering. It was the belief that Jair Lynch
was not consistent.
Lynch obliterated that criticism.
The gymnast used his recently com
pleted junior season to remove the
questions about his past performance.
In the process, he lifted the Stanford
men's gymnastics team to its first na

tional title in history.
There had been no doubt about Lynch's ability — but con
sistency had always been a problem, although Lynch re
mained Stanford's top all-around gymnast.
This year changed that perception. Meet after meet, Lynch
kept putting up great numbers. "I can see his [strength] im
proving rapidly now," said his coach, Sadao Hamada, earlier
this year.
The improvement began to manifest itself at the Winter
Nationals. Lynch turned himself from Olympic hopeful to
U.S. National Team member, finishing 12th despite a miscue
in the floor exercise.
He followed this performance with a better one in the U.S.
Championships in late May. Lynch finished third in this com
petition, garnering a berth on the Olympic team.
In between, Lynch accomplished another one of his goals as
the Cardinal won an NCAA Championship. Lynch scored a
sparkling 59.025 during the team competition to lead the way.
Lynch was also named Pacific 10 Conference Gymnast of
the Year.
Lynch goes to Barcelona with plenty of weight behind him.
He carries both weighty expectations md weighty credentials.
But he will not carry the weight of doubt.
—Af. Scott Walker

Jeff Rouse

Jeff Rouse takes his strokes in
stride.
A throe-time NCAA champion in the
100-yard backstroke and a world record
holder in the 100-meter backstroke,
Rouse has been swimming religiously
every day for"the past 15 or 17 years."
World-ranked for the past three
years, Rouse is also a two-time Pacific
10 Conference 100-yard back champi
on as well as the 1989 NCAA champi
on in the 200-yard backstroke.

But he sports a laid-back attitude.
"You could talk with him for hours and you'd never guess
he was a great swimmer," said men's swimming coach Skip
Kenney earlier this year.
Of the 1992 Olympic Trials, Rouse said in February, "I
have to think of it as just another meet."
For Rouse, this easy-going outlook paired with his
diehard dedication has proven to be a winning combination.
At the Olympic Trials he broke the U.S. Open record set
last year by Martin Zubero, and also came within two
tenths of a second from the world record he set in the Pan-
Pacific Games last summer — when he became the first
person in history to break 55 seconds in the 100-meter back,
with a 53.93.
Rouse holds two of the fastest 100-back times ever swum in
the United States, as well as six of the nine fastest times overall.
"Going to the Olympics and winning a gold medal would
mean that all those years.. .of swimming every single day
[would have] paid ofT," Rouse said earlier this year.
At Barcelona this summer, he is half way there.
And if Rouse wins a gold medal in the 100-meter back
stroke as expected, Barcelona will likely become much more
than "just another meet" for him.

Summer Sanders

Topping off two incredible swim
ming seasons at Stanford, Summer
Sanders will swim in four individual
events in the 1992 Olympics — more
individual events than any other U.S.
swimmer.
Sanders' status in the Olympics is
added glory to an already outstanding
record. Named 1991 and 1992 NCAA
Swimmer of the Year, Sanders won six
NCAA individual titles and helped
four relay teams to victory in those
two seasons.

In the Olympics, Sanders will swim the 200 and 400-
meter individual medley (consisting of equal lengths of but
terfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle) and the 100
and 200-meter fly. She placed first in the Olympic Trials in
all these events but the 100 fly, where she took second place.
As the 1991 world champion in the 200-meter fly, and
second and third place winner at the championships in the
200 and 400-meter LMs, respectively, Sanders' potential for
success in the Olympics is outstanding.
At home in Ro Seville, Calif. Sanders began swimming
when she was four years old. Her first claim to real fame
came in the 1990 Goodwill Games, where she beat Janet
Evans in the 400 IM — the event in which Evans held the
Olympic gold medal.
Unfortunately for Stanford, Sanders has given up her
final two years of NCAA eligibility. This will allow her to ac
cept funds from the U.S. Olympic committee and U.S.
Swimming, as well as pursue commercial endorsements.
Although she will return to Stanford in the fall to con
tinue her education, Sanders' junior year will not be spent
adding her talent to the swim team's pursuit of victory.
But she will always be Stanford's golden girl of summer.
—Rebecca Walker

Jenny Thompson

Jenny Thompson was a relatively
unknown freshman swimmar from
New Hampshire before the United
States Olympic Trials last March.
And then, in an early morning pre
liminary 100-meter freestyle heat,
Thompson did what no other Ameri
can swimmer had done in the last 59
years — she smashed a world record,
cruising to the wall in 54:48.
"I just started bawling after I
touched the wall," she said. "It was the

first time I've ever cried of happiness."
The previous time of 54:73 was set by the Kristin Otto,
the East German star of the 1988 games.
But Thompson couldn't say that she got what she came
to Indianapolis for until that evening, when she accom
plished her "biggest goal" by winning the 100-free final and
earning a spot on the Olympic team.
"Jenny had a phenomenal swim," explained Stanford
swimming coach Richard Quick of Thompson's record
breaking performance. "She has trained and thought and
performed well. I'm not surprised."
Now the 19-year-old Thompson is widely regarded as the
world's foremost short-distance swimmer and is a likely
prospect to capture five medals during the next throe weeks.
She is favored to win handily both the 50 and 100-meter
freestyle races.
A muscular 5-foot-10-inch swimmer, Thompson special
izes in quick starts and powerful, rapid-fire strokes.
She will also anchor the 400-meter freestyle and 400-
meter medley relay teams. Both are expected to garner the
gold.
In addition, Thompson will compete in the 200-meter
freestyle race, where she should be a medalist as well.

Victor Cheng — Daily file
Jair Lynch was strong enough at the NCAA championships to lead the Cardinal to a national title. A reded
ication to his training regimen has transformed this once inconsistent performer into a force to be reck
oned with in any event Now as one of six gymnasts on the U.S. national team, he's going for gold.









Joshua Folk — Oaiiy lile
World record holder Jeff Rouse glides through the water with the greatest of ease. He's won three NCAA
championships in the 100 backstroke, and over the past three years has proved that In this event, there's
nobody better. Rouse should soon be crowned with laurels, the symbol of an Olympic champion.
They have all practiced on the Farm for countless

A muscular 5-foot-10-inch swimmer, Thompson special

gold.

Victor Cheng — Daily file
Jair Lynch was strong enough at the NCAA championships to lead the Cardinal to a national title. A reded
ication to his training regimen has transformed this once inconsistent performer into a force to be reck
oned with in any event Now as one of six gymnasts on the U.S. national team, he's going for gold.









Joshua Folk — Oaiiy lile
World record holder Jeff Rouse glides through the water with the greatest of ease. He's won three NCAA
championships in the 100 backstroke, and over the past three years has proved that In this event, there's
nobody better. Rouse should soon be crowned with laurels, the symbol of an Olympic champion.
They have all practiced on the Farm for countless
hours. Every day, in the cold, wee hours of the
morning, swimmers Summer Sanders, Jenny
Thompson and Jeff Rouse have swum innumerable laps
in DeGuerre pool.
On the hot, afternoon track in the Stadium, Jackie Eld
wards has run wind sprints and perfected her long jump
eveiy afternoon for the past four years.
In the cages behind Sunken Diamond, Jeffrey Ham
monds, Willie Adams and Rick Helling have hit and
pitched baseballs until their hands and arms needed to be
soaked in ice.
And in the dark, musty confines of old Roble Gym,
fencer Nick Bravin has spent hours on end behind a mesh
mask jousting with his foil. But now, in time-honored tra
dition, these athletes and many others who wear the car
dinal and white will put their dedication and practice to
the test in the Games of the 25th Olympiad.
All in all, 32 indivduals associated with Stanford are
going to Barcelona — a delegation widely believed to be
the largest of any university in the world, and certainly
larger than many small countries.

In fact, if Cardinal athletes perform as well as expect
ed and if Stanford were a country unto itaelf, the Farm
might easily make the top-twenty list of medal winning
nations.
But athletic success is nothing new to Stanford. In
1988, incoming freshman Janet Evans was the star of the
Seoul games, winning four golds and a bronze. In this
past year, Cardinal teams have won five NCAA Division I
team championships, tying a national record.
"I think Stanford is one of the truly great institutions
in the world," says Stanford women's swimming coach
Richard Quick, who will be an assistant swimming coach
in Barcelona."The standards set in academics and ath
letics are unparalleled."
Not all of Stanford's competitors are fresh off the
Farm, though. Many graduated years ago — but
their attachment to Stanford has not waned.
Pablo Morales may be the Cardinal's most incredible
Olympian. In 1984, he won a gold and two silvers in Los
Angeles. In 1988, he didn't even make the Olympic team,
and it seemed like his career was over for sure.
Now, at the ripe old age of 27, Pablo is back after
spending the last year training on the Farm. In a sport
where youth is king, this living legend has a great chance

to medal in the 100 butterfly.
In another sport where being young ia usually an ad
vantage, PattiSue Plumer and Regina Jacobs beat the
clock and made the U.S. trad: team. Plumer and Jacobs
will run side by side in the 1500 meters, and Plumer will
also compete in the 3000.
Kim Oden will also be strutting her stuff in Barcelona.
Kim and her sister Elaina (who didn't go to Stanford) are
the first sibling combination in history to compete in
women's Olympic volleyball.
Oden, who was a four-time All-American and a na
tional Player of the Year, would like nothing better than
to add a gold medal to her list of accomplishments.
Scott Fortune already has a gold medal, which he won in
Seoul as a member of the U.S. men's volleyball team. For
tune was one of the younger members of the 1988 team, but
in Barcelona he will be a team leader as the U.S. goes for
back to back golds. And don't forget Andrew Vlahov, who
will be bumping and dunking for the Australian hoops
team.
In addition to student participation, a number of Stan
ford coaches, including men's volleyball coach Fred
Sturm and men's soccer coach Colin Lindores, will be
leading United States teams in Barcelona.

Olympic glory will not necessarily end with
medal-winning performances in Barcelona.
Success in Spain will assuredly translate into
personal financial windfalls for athletes and also serve
to enhance Stanford's recruiting program.
Sanders decided last April to quit the Stanford swim
ming team so that she would be able to avoid the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association's stringent regu
lation of athletic endorsements. A good performance
this summer could translate into a seven-figure income
from endorsements, say many advertising experts.
In addition, Olympic success for Cardinal athletes
could significantly help Cardinal recruiting, according
to Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland.
"It gives us tremendous visibility," Leland said, "and
visibility always helps in recruiting."
While Leland thinks that this visibility helps Stanford
athletics in general, he specifically singled out swimming
as a sport where recruiting could be greatly impacted.
But beyond recruiting gains, Leland sees an even
greater benefit in Stanford athletes participating in the
Olympics. "It's the culmination of a lot of work on part of
the coach and athlete," Leland said, "and that's a wonder
ful thing."

Jackie Edwards

Most people would call becoming
an Olympian at 17 "peaking too
soon."
But most people don't know the
talent of Jackie Edwards.
This list may include Edwards her
self. She called her third place perfor
mance in the triple jump at the NCAA
Indoor Championships "a surprise."
But while none may know her full
potential, her feats show tremendous
capabilities.

The Bahamian National Team member finished first at
this year's NCAA Championships in the long jump, her
Olympic event. She had a leap of 21' 7 1/2", which is still
short of her career best 21' 8 3/4", set at last year's NCAA
Championships. She also placed 10th in the event in last
year's World Championships.
Edwards established herself as a top triple jumper, fin
ishing second at this season's NCAA Championships with
a 43' 4 1/2" effort. Early on in her Stanford career, it ap
peared that Edwards might have peaked too soon. She
could only muster long jumps of 20' 1" and 20' 5" in fresh
man and sophomore seasons, respectively. This is in con
trast to the 20' 7" long jump best she established before
she had set foot on the Stanford Stadium runway.
But things began to turn around for her in her junior
campaign. The best long jumper in Stanford history fin
ished second in that event in the Pacific 10 Championships
in 1991. She won the triple jump at the same competition.
Then, she finished second in the nation in the long jump.
So, the critics may have been right about Jackie Ed
wards. She just might have peaked too soon. But, there is
a funny thing about great athletes.
They just seem to have more peaks.
—Af. Scott Walker

Lea Loveless

For Lea Loveless, deciding where to
attend college after a sensational high
school evHrnming career was the hardest
decision she's ever had to make. And she
had to make it twice.
A highly recruited backstroker com
ing out of high school in Crestwood,
New York, three years ago, Loveless
narrowed her choices to Florida, Stan
ford and California before finally set
tling on Florida.
A bad move, she discovered a year

later. Florida's coach, Randy Reese, quit after her freshman
season; several of her teammates then decided to leave, drop
ping Florida from serious contention for the national title.
"Probably the first thing I said was that I should have gone
to Stanford in the first place," Loveless said. She transferred
to the Farm and redshirted dining the 1991 season, as re
quired by NCAA regulations.
Sitting out a year was hard, said Loveless, who calls team
competition "the best aspect" of swimming. "It makes you ap
preciate it more, makes you want to take advantage of every
opportunity you have," she said.
Last season, in her first year of Stanford eligibility, Love
less carved out a niche for herself on the nation's perenially
top-ranked swim team. Competing in the 100 and 200-yard
backstroke, Loveless won the Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship in both events, and a national championship in the
100 backstroke.
She was also a member of Stanford's 400-yard medley relay
team, which easily outpaced UCLA to win the national title.
In the Olympics, Loveless is not favored to win a medal in
her two events, the 100 and 200-meter backstroke. But she
may qualify for a spot on the 400-meter medley relay team,
which is nearly guaranteed to win a gold.
—Peter Robison

Jair Lynch

You hate to have doubts about a tal
ented athlete, but there were some
doubts about Jair Lynch. Most were
minor objections, but one was more lin
gering. It was the belief that Jair Lynch
was not consistent.
Lynch obliterated that criticism.
The gymnast used his recently com
pleted junior season to remove the
questions about his past performance.
In the process, he lifted the Stanford
men's gymnastics team to its first na

tional title in history.
There had been no doubt about Lynch's ability — but con
sistency had always been a problem, although Lynch re
mained Stanford's top all-around gymnast.
This year changed that perception. Meet after meet, Lynch
kept putting up great numbers. "I can see his [strength] im
proving rapidly now," said his coach, Sadao Hamada, earlier
this year.
The improvement began to manifest itself at the Winter
Nationals. Lynch turned himself from Olympic hopeful to
U.S. National Team member, finishing 12th despite a miscue
in the floor exercise.
He followed this performance with a better one in the U.S.
Championships in late May. Lynch finished third in this com
petition, garnering a berth on the Olympic team.
In between, Lynch accomplished another one of his goals as
the Cardinal won an NCAA Championship. Lynch scored a
sparkling 59.025 during the team competition to lead the way.
Lynch was also named Pacific 10 Conference Gymnast of
the Year.
Lynch goes to Barcelona with plenty of weight behind him.
He carries both weighty expectations md weighty credentials.
But he will not carry the weight of doubt.
—Af. Scott Walker

Jeff Rouse

Jeff Rouse takes his strokes in
stride.
A throe-time NCAA champion in the
100-yard backstroke and a world record
holder in the 100-meter backstroke,
Rouse has been swimming religiously
every day for"the past 15 or 17 years."
World-ranked for the past three
years, Rouse is also a two-time Pacific
10 Conference 100-yard back champi
on as well as the 1989 NCAA champi
on in the 200-yard backstroke.

But he sports a laid-back attitude.
"You could talk with him for hours and you'd never guess
he was a great swimmer," said men's swimming coach Skip
Kenney earlier this year.
Of the 1992 Olympic Trials, Rouse said in February, "I
have to think of it as just another meet."
For Rouse, this easy-going outlook paired with his
diehard dedication has proven to be a winning combination.
At the Olympic Trials he broke the U.S. Open record set
last year by Martin Zubero, and also came within two
tenths of a second from the world record he set in the Pan-
Pacific Games last summer — when he became the first
person in history to break 55 seconds in the 100-meter back,
with a 53.93.
Rouse holds two of the fastest 100-back times ever swum in
the United States, as well as six of the nine fastest times overall.
"Going to the Olympics and winning a gold medal would
mean that all those years.. .of swimming every single day
[would have] paid ofT," Rouse said earlier this year.
At Barcelona this summer, he is half way there.
And if Rouse wins a gold medal in the 100-meter back
stroke as expected, Barcelona will likely become much more
than "just another meet" for him.
—Grace Lee

Summer Sanders

Topping off two incredible swim
ming seasons at Stanford, Summer
Sanders will swim in four individual
events in the 1992 Olympics — more
individual events than any other U.S.
swimmer.
Sanders' status in the Olympics is
added glory to an already outstanding
record. Named 1991 and 1992 NCAA
Swimmer of the Year, Sanders won six
NCAA individual titles and helped
four relay teams to victory in those
two seasons.

In the Olympics, Sanders will swim the 200 and 400-
meter individual medley (consisting of equal lengths of but
terfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle) and the 100
and 200-meter fly. She placed first in the Olympic Trials in
all these events but the 100 fly, where she took second place.
As the 1991 world champion in the 200-meter fly, and
second and third place winner at the championships in the
200 and 400-meter LMs, respectively, Sanders' potential for
success in the Olympics is outstanding.
At home in Ro Seville, Calif. Sanders began swimming
when she was four years old. Her first claim to real fame
came in the 1990 Goodwill Games, where she beat Janet
Evans in the 400 IM — the event in which Evans held the
Olympic gold medal.
Unfortunately for Stanford, Sanders has given up her
final two years of NCAA eligibility. This will allow her to ac
cept funds from the U.S. Olympic committee and U.S.
Swimming, as well as pursue commercial endorsements.
Although she will return to Stanford in the fall to con
tinue her education, Sanders' junior year will not be spent
adding her talent to the swim team's pursuit of victory.
But she will always be Stanford's golden girl of summer.
—Rebecca Walker

Jenny Thompson

Jenny Thompson was a relatively
unknown freshman swimmar from
New Hampshire before the United
States Olympic Trials last March.
And then, in an early morning pre
liminary 100-meter freestyle heat,
Thompson did what no other Ameri
can swimmer had done in the last 59
years — she smashed a world record,
cruising to the wall in 54:48.
"I just started bawling after I
touched the wall," she said. "It was the

first time I've ever cried of happiness."
The previous time of 54:73 was set by the Kristin Otto,
the East German star of the 1988 games.
But Thompson couldn't say that she got what she came
to Indianapolis for until that evening, when she accom
plished her "biggest goal" by winning the 100-free final and
earning a spot on the Olympic team.
"Jenny had a phenomenal swim," explained Stanford
swimming coach Richard Quick of Thompson's record
breaking performance. "She has trained and thought and
performed well. I'm not surprised."
Now the 19-year-old Thompson is widely regarded as the
world's foremost short-distance swimmer and is a likely
prospect to capture five medals during the next throe weeks.
She is favored to win handily both the 50 and 100-meter
freestyle races.
A muscular 5-foot-10-inch swimmer, Thompson special
izes in quick starts and powerful, rapid-fire strokes.
She will also anchor the 400-meter freestyle and 400-
meter medley relay teams. Both are expected to garner the
gold.
In addition, Thompson will compete in the 200-meter
freestyle race, where she should be a medalist as well.

As the 1991 world champion in the 200-meter fly, and
second and third place winner at the championships in the
200 and 400-meter LMs, respectively, Sanders' potential for
success in the Olympics is outstanding.
At home in Ro Seville, Calif. Sanders began swimming
when she was four years old. Her first claim to real fame
came in the 1990 Goodwill Games, where she beat Janet
Evans in the 400 IM — the event in which Evans held the
Olympic gold medal.
Unfortunately for Stanford, Sanders has given up her
final two years of NCAA eligibility. This will allow her to ac
cept funds from the U.S. Olympic committee and U.S.
Swimming, as well as pursue commercial endorsements.
Although she will return to Stanford in the fall to con
tinue her education, Sanders' junior year will not be spent
adding her talent to the swim team's pursuit of victory.
But she will always be Stanford's golden girl of summer.

Jenny Thompson

Jenny Thompson was a relatively
unknown freshman swimmar from
New Hampshire before the United
States Olympic Trials last March.
And then, in an early morning pre
liminary 100-meter freestyle heat,
Thompson did what no other Ameri
can swimmer had done in the last 59
years — she smashed a world record,
cruising to the wall in 54:48.
"I just started bawling after I
touched the wall," she said. "It was the

first time I've ever cried of happiness."
The previous time of 54:73 was set by the Kristin Otto,
the East German star of the 1988 games.
But Thompson couldn't say that she got what she came
to Indianapolis for until that evening, when she accom
plished her "biggest goal" by winning the 100-free final and
earning a spot on the Olympic team.
"Jenny had a phenomenal swim," explained Stanford
swimming coach Richard Quick of Thompson's record
breaking performance. "She has trained and thought and
performed well. I'm not surprised."
Now the 19-year-old Thompson is widely regarded as the
world's foremost short-distance swimmer and is a likely
prospect to capture five medals during the next throe weeks.
She is favored to win handily both the 50 and 100-meter
freestyle races.
A muscular 5-foot-10-inch swimmer, Thompson special
izes in quick starts and powerful, rapid-fire strokes.
She will also anchor the 400-meter freestyle and 400-
meter medley relay teams. Both are expected to garner the
gold.
In addition, Thompson will compete in the 200-meter
freestyle race, where she should be a medalist as well.

Victor Cheng — Daily file
Jair Lynch was strong enough at the NCAA championships to lead the Cardinal to a national title. A reded
ication to his training regimen has transformed this once inconsistent performer into a force to be reck
oned with in any event Now as one of six gymnasts on the U.S. national team, he's going for gold.









Joshua Folk — Oaiiy lile
World record holder Jeff Rouse glides through the water with the greatest of ease. He's won three NCAA
championships in the 100 backstroke, and over the past three years has proved that In this event, there's
nobody better. Rouse should soon be crowned with laurels, the symbol of an Olympic champion.
They have all practiced on the Farm for countless
hours. Every day, in the cold, wee hours of the
morning, swimmers Summer Sanders, Jenny
Thompson and Jeff Rouse have swum innumerable laps
in DeGuerre pool.
On the hot, afternoon track in the Stadium, Jackie Eld
wards has run wind sprints and perfected her long jump
eveiy afternoon for the past four years.
In the cages behind Sunken Diamond, Jeffrey Ham
monds, Willie Adams and Rick Helling have hit and
pitched baseballs until their hands and arms needed to be
soaked in ice.
And in the dark, musty confines of old Roble Gym,
fencer Nick Bravin has spent hours on end behind a mesh
mask jousting with his foil. But now, in time-honored tra
dition, these athletes and many others who wear the car
dinal and white will put their dedication and practice to
the test in the Games of the 25th Olympiad.
All in all, 32 indivduals associated with Stanford are
going to Barcelona — a delegation widely believed to be
the largest of any university in the world, and certainly
larger than many small countries.

In fact, if Cardinal athletes perform as well as expect
ed and if Stanford were a country unto itaelf, the Farm
might easily make the top-twenty list of medal winning
nations.
But athletic success is nothing new to Stanford. In
1988, incoming freshman Janet Evans was the star of the
Seoul games, winning four golds and a bronze. In this
past year, Cardinal teams have won five NCAA Division I
team championships, tying a national record.
"I think Stanford is one of the truly great institutions
in the world," says Stanford women's swimming coach
Richard Quick, who will be an assistant swimming coach
in Barcelona."The standards set in academics and ath
letics are unparalleled."
Not all of Stanford's competitors are fresh off the
Farm, though. Many graduated years ago — but
their attachment to Stanford has not waned.
Pablo Morales may be the Cardinal's most incredible
Olympian. In 1984, he won a gold and two silvers in Los
Angeles. In 1988, he didn't even make the Olympic team,
and it seemed like his career was over for sure.
Now, at the ripe old age of 27, Pablo is back after
spending the last year training on the Farm. In a sport
where youth is king, this living legend has a great chance

to medal in the 100 butterfly.
In another sport where being young ia usually an ad
vantage, PattiSue Plumer and Regina Jacobs beat the
clock and made the U.S. trad: team. Plumer and Jacobs
will run side by side in the 1500 meters, and Plumer will
also compete in the 3000.
Kim Oden will also be strutting her stuff in Barcelona.
Kim and her sister Elaina (who didn't go to Stanford) are
the first sibling combination in history to compete in
women's Olympic volleyball.
Oden, who was a four-time All-American and a na
tional Player of the Year, would like nothing better than
to add a gold medal to her list of accomplishments.
Scott Fortune already has a gold medal, which he won in
Seoul as a member of the U.S. men's volleyball team. For
tune was one of the younger members of the 1988 team, but
in Barcelona he will be a team leader as the U.S. goes for
back to back golds. And don't forget Andrew Vlahov, who
will be bumping and dunking for the Australian hoops
team.
In addition to student participation, a number of Stan
ford coaches, including men's volleyball coach Fred
Sturm and men's soccer coach Colin Lindores, will be
leading United States teams in Barcelona.

Olympic glory will not necessarily end with
medal-winning performances in Barcelona.
Success in Spain will assuredly translate into
personal financial windfalls for athletes and also serve
to enhance Stanford's recruiting program.
Sanders decided last April to quit the Stanford swim
ming team so that she would be able to avoid the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association's stringent regu
lation of athletic endorsements. A good performance
this summer could translate into a seven-figure income
from endorsements, say many advertising experts.
In addition, Olympic success for Cardinal athletes
could significantly help Cardinal recruiting, according
to Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland.
"It gives us tremendous visibility," Leland said, "and
visibility always helps in recruiting."
While Leland thinks that this visibility helps Stanford
athletics in general, he specifically singled out swimming
as a sport where recruiting could be greatly impacted.
But beyond recruiting gains, Leland sees an even
greater benefit in Stanford athletes participating in the
Olympics. "It's the culmination of a lot of work on part of
the coach and athlete," Leland said, "and that's a wonder
ful thing."

Jackie Edwards

Most people would call becoming
an Olympian at 17 "peaking too
soon."
But most people don't know the
talent of Jackie Edwards.
This list may include Edwards her
self. She called her third place perfor
mance in the triple jump at the NCAA
Indoor Championships "a surprise."
But while none may know her full
potential, her feats show tremendous
capabilities.

The Bahamian National Team member finished first at
this year's NCAA Championships in the long jump, her
Olympic event. She had a leap of 21' 7 1/2", which is still
short of her career best 21' 8 3/4", set at last year's NCAA
Championships. She also placed 10th in the event in last
year's World Championships.
Edwards established herself as a top triple jumper, fin
ishing second at this season's NCAA Championships with
a 43' 4 1/2" effort. Early on in her Stanford career, it ap
peared that Edwards might have peaked too soon. She
could only muster long jumps of 20' 1" and 20' 5" in fresh
man and sophomore seasons, respectively. This is in con
trast to the 20' 7" long jump best she established before
she had set foot on the Stanford Stadium runway.
But things began to turn around for her in her junior
campaign. The best long jumper in Stanford history fin
ished second in that event in the Pacific 10 Championships
in 1991. She won the triple jump at the same competition.
Then, she finished second in the nation in the long jump.
So, the critics may have been right about Jackie Ed
wards. She just might have peaked too soon. But, there is
a funny thing about great athletes.
They just seem to have more peaks.
—Af. Scott Walker

Lea Loveless

For Lea Loveless, deciding where to
attend college after a sensational high
school evHrnming career was the hardest
decision she's ever had to make. And she
had to make it twice.
A highly recruited backstroker com
ing out of high school in Crestwood,
New York, three years ago, Loveless
narrowed her choices to Florida, Stan
ford and California before finally set
tling on Florida.
A bad move, she discovered a year

later. Florida's coach, Randy Reese, quit after her freshman
season; several of her teammates then decided to leave, drop
ping Florida from serious contention for the national title.
"Probably the first thing I said was that I should have gone
to Stanford in the first place," Loveless said. She transferred
to the Farm and redshirted dining the 1991 season, as re
quired by NCAA regulations.
Sitting out a year was hard, said Loveless, who calls team
competition "the best aspect" of swimming. "It makes you ap
preciate it more, makes you want to take advantage of every
opportunity you have," she said.
Last season, in her first year of Stanford eligibility, Love
less carved out a niche for herself on the nation's perenially
top-ranked swim team. Competing in the 100 and 200-yard
backstroke, Loveless won the Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship in both events, and a national championship in the
100 backstroke.
She was also a member of Stanford's 400-yard medley relay
team, which easily outpaced UCLA to win the national title.
In the Olympics, Loveless is not favored to win a medal in
her two events, the 100 and 200-meter backstroke. But she
may qualify for a spot on the 400-meter medley relay team,
which is nearly guaranteed to win a gold.
—Peter Robison

Jair Lynch

You hate to have doubts about a tal
ented athlete, but there were some
doubts about Jair Lynch. Most were
minor objections, but one was more lin
gering. It was the belief that Jair Lynch
was not consistent.
Lynch obliterated that criticism.
The gymnast used his recently com
pleted junior season to remove the
questions about his past performance.
In the process, he lifted the Stanford
men's gymnastics team to its first na

tional title in history.
There had been no doubt about Lynch's ability — but con
sistency had always been a problem, although Lynch re
mained Stanford's top all-around gymnast.
This year changed that perception. Meet after meet, Lynch
kept putting up great numbers. "I can see his [strength] im
proving rapidly now," said his coach, Sadao Hamada, earlier
this year.
The improvement began to manifest itself at the Winter
Nationals. Lynch turned himself from Olympic hopeful to
U.S. National Team member, finishing 12th despite a miscue
in the floor exercise.
He followed this performance with a better one in the U.S.
Championships in late May. Lynch finished third in this com
petition, garnering a berth on the Olympic team.
In between, Lynch accomplished another one of his goals as
the Cardinal won an NCAA Championship. Lynch scored a
sparkling 59.025 during the team competition to lead the way.
Lynch was also named Pacific 10 Conference Gymnast of
the Year.
Lynch goes to Barcelona with plenty of weight behind him.
He carries both weighty expectations md weighty credentials.
But he will not carry the weight of doubt.
—Af. Scott Walker

Jeff Rouse

Jeff Rouse takes his strokes in
stride.
A throe-time NCAA champion in the
100-yard backstroke and a world record
holder in the 100-meter backstroke,
Rouse has been swimming religiously
every day for"the past 15 or 17 years."
World-ranked for the past three
years, Rouse is also a two-time Pacific
10 Conference 100-yard back champi
on as well as the 1989 NCAA champi
on in the 200-yard backstroke.

But he sports a laid-back attitude.
"You could talk with him for hours and you'd never guess
he was a great swimmer," said men's swimming coach Skip
Kenney earlier this year.
Of the 1992 Olympic Trials, Rouse said in February, "I
have to think of it as just another meet."
For Rouse, this easy-going outlook paired with his
diehard dedication has proven to be a winning combination.
At the Olympic Trials he broke the U.S. Open record set
last year by Martin Zubero, and also came within two
tenths of a second from the world record he set in the Pan-
Pacific Games last summer — when he became the first
person in history to break 55 seconds in the 100-meter back,
with a 53.93.
Rouse holds two of the fastest 100-back times ever swum in
the United States, as well as six of the nine fastest times overall.
"Going to the Olympics and winning a gold medal would
mean that all those years.. .of swimming every single day
[would have] paid ofT," Rouse said earlier this year.
At Barcelona this summer, he is half way there.
And if Rouse wins a gold medal in the 100-meter back
stroke as expected, Barcelona will likely become much more
than "just another meet" for him.
—Grace Lee

Summer Sanders

Topping off two incredible swim
ming seasons at Stanford, Summer
Sanders will swim in four individual
events in the 1992 Olympics — more
individual events than any other U.S.
swimmer.
Sanders' status in the Olympics is
added glory to an already outstanding
record. Named 1991 and 1992 NCAA
Swimmer of the Year, Sanders won six
NCAA individual titles and helped
four relay teams to victory in those
two seasons.

In the Olympics, Sanders will swim the 200 and 400-
meter individual medley (consisting of equal lengths of but
terfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle) and the 100
and 200-meter fly. She placed first in the Olympic Trials in
all these events but the 100 fly, where she took second place.
As the 1991 world champion in the 200-meter fly, and
second and third place winner at the championships in the
200 and 400-meter LMs, respectively, Sanders' potential for
success in the Olympics is outstanding.
At home in Ro Seville, Calif. Sanders began swimming
when she was four years old. Her first claim to real fame
came in the 1990 Goodwill Games, where she beat Janet
Evans in the 400 IM — the event in which Evans held the
Olympic gold medal.
Unfortunately for Stanford, Sanders has given up her
final two years of NCAA eligibility. This will allow her to ac
cept funds from the U.S. Olympic committee and U.S.
Swimming, as well as pursue commercial endorsements.
Although she will return to Stanford in the fall to con
tinue her education, Sanders' junior year will not be spent
adding her talent to the swim team's pursuit of victory.
But she will always be Stanford's golden girl of summer.

on as well as the 1989 NCAA champi
on in the 200-yard backstroke.

But he sports a laid-back attitude.
"You could talk with him for hours and you'd never guess
he was a great swimmer," said men's swimming coach Skip
Kenney earlier this year.
Of the 1992 Olympic Trials, Rouse said in February, "I
have to think of it as just another meet."
For Rouse, this easy-going outlook paired with his
diehard dedication has proven to be a winning combination.
At the Olympic Trials he broke the U.S. Open record set
last year by Martin Zubero, and also came within two
tenths of a second from the world record he set in the Pan-
Pacific Games last summer — when he became the first
person in history to break 55 seconds in the 100-meter back,
with a 53.93.
Rouse holds two of the fastest 100-back times ever swum in
the United States, as well as six of the nine fastest times overall.
"Going to the Olympics and winning a gold medal would
mean that all those years.. .of swimming every single day
[would have] paid ofT," Rouse said earlier this year.
At Barcelona this summer, he is half way there.
And if Rouse wins a gold medal in the 100-meter back
stroke as expected, Barcelona will likely become much more
than "just another meet" for him.

Summer Sanders

Topping off two incredible swim
ming seasons at Stanford, Summer
Sanders will swim in four individual
events in the 1992 Olympics — more
individual events than any other U.S.
swimmer.
Sanders' status in the Olympics is
added glory to an already outstanding
record. Named 1991 and 1992 NCAA
Swimmer of the Year, Sanders won six
NCAA individual titles and helped
four relay teams to victory in those
two seasons.

In the Olympics, Sanders will swim the 200 and 400-
meter individual medley (consisting of equal lengths of but
terfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle) and the 100
and 200-meter fly. She placed first in the Olympic Trials in
all these events but the 100 fly, where she took second place.
As the 1991 world champion in the 200-meter fly, and
second and third place winner at the championships in the
200 and 400-meter LMs, respectively, Sanders' potential for
success in the Olympics is outstanding.
At home in Ro Seville, Calif. Sanders began swimming
when she was four years old. Her first claim to real fame
came in the 1990 Goodwill Games, where she beat Janet
Evans in the 400 IM — the event in which Evans held the
Olympic gold medal.
Unfortunately for Stanford, Sanders has given up her
final two years of NCAA eligibility. This will allow her to ac
cept funds from the U.S. Olympic committee and U.S.
Swimming, as well as pursue commercial endorsements.
Although she will return to Stanford in the fall to con
tinue her education, Sanders' junior year will not be spent
adding her talent to the swim team's pursuit of victory.
But she will always be Stanford's golden girl of summer.
—Rebecca Walker

Jenny Thompson

Jenny Thompson was a relatively
unknown freshman swimmar from
New Hampshire before the United
States Olympic Trials last March.
And then, in an early morning pre
liminary 100-meter freestyle heat,
Thompson did what no other Ameri
can swimmer had done in the last 59
years — she smashed a world record,
cruising to the wall in 54:48.
"I just started bawling after I
touched the wall," she said. "It was the

first time I've ever cried of happiness."
The previous time of 54:73 was set by the Kristin Otto,
the East German star of the 1988 games.
But Thompson couldn't say that she got what she came
to Indianapolis for until that evening, when she accom
plished her "biggest goal" by winning the 100-free final and
earning a spot on the Olympic team.
"Jenny had a phenomenal swim," explained Stanford
swimming coach Richard Quick of Thompson's record
breaking performance. "She has trained and thought and
performed well. I'm not surprised."
Now the 19-year-old Thompson is widely regarded as the
world's foremost short-distance swimmer and is a likely
prospect to capture five medals during the next throe weeks.
She is favored to win handily both the 50 and 100-meter
freestyle races.
A muscular 5-foot-10-inch swimmer, Thompson special
izes in quick starts and powerful, rapid-fire strokes.
She will also anchor the 400-meter freestyle and 400-
meter medley relay teams. Both are expected to garner the
gold.
In addition, Thompson will compete in the 200-meter
freestyle race, where she should be a medalist as well.

Victor Cheng — Daily file
Jair Lynch was strong enough at the NCAA championships to lead the Cardinal to a national title. A reded
ication to his training regimen has transformed this once inconsistent performer into a force to be reck
oned with in any event Now as one of six gymnasts on the U.S. national team, he's going for gold.









Joshua Folk — Oaiiy lile
World record holder Jeff Rouse glides through the water with the greatest of ease. He's won three NCAA
championships in the 100 backstroke, and over the past three years has proved that In this event, there's
nobody better. Rouse should soon be crowned with laurels, the symbol of an Olympic champion.
They have all practiced on the Farm for countless
hours. Every day, in the cold, wee hours of the
morning, swimmers Summer Sanders, Jenny
Thompson and Jeff Rouse have swum innumerable laps
in DeGuerre pool.
On the hot, afternoon track in the Stadium, Jackie Eld
wards has run wind sprints and perfected her long jump
eveiy afternoon for the past four years.
In the cages behind Sunken Diamond, Jeffrey Ham
monds, Willie Adams and Rick Helling have hit and
pitched baseballs until their hands and arms needed to be
soaked in ice.
And in the dark, musty confines of old Roble Gym,
fencer Nick Bravin has spent hours on end behind a mesh
mask jousting with his foil. But now, in time-honored tra
dition, these athletes and many others who wear the car
dinal and white will put their dedication and practice to
the test in the Games of the 25th Olympiad.
All in all, 32 indivduals associated with Stanford are
going to Barcelona — a delegation widely believed to be
the largest of any university in the world, and certainly
larger than many small countries.

In fact, if Cardinal athletes perform as well as expect
ed and if Stanford were a country unto itaelf, the Farm
might easily make the top-twenty list of medal winning
nations.
But athletic success is nothing new to Stanford. In
1988, incoming freshman Janet Evans was the star of the
Seoul games, winning four golds and a bronze. In this
past year, Cardinal teams have won five NCAA Division I
team championships, tying a national record.
"I think Stanford is one of the truly great institutions
in the world," says Stanford women's swimming coach
Richard Quick, who will be an assistant swimming coach
in Barcelona."The standards set in academics and ath
letics are unparalleled."
Not all of Stanford's competitors are fresh off the
Farm, though. Many graduated years ago — but
their attachment to Stanford has not waned.
Pablo Morales may be the Cardinal's most incredible
Olympian. In 1984, he won a gold and two silvers in Los
Angeles. In 1988, he didn't even make the Olympic team,
and it seemed like his career was over for sure.
Now, at the ripe old age of 27, Pablo is back after
spending the last year training on the Farm. In a sport
where youth is king, this living legend has a great chance

to medal in the 100 butterfly.
In another sport where being young ia usually an ad
vantage, PattiSue Plumer and Regina Jacobs beat the
clock and made the U.S. trad: team. Plumer and Jacobs
will run side by side in the 1500 meters, and Plumer will
also compete in the 3000.
Kim Oden will also be strutting her stuff in Barcelona.
Kim and her sister Elaina (who didn't go to Stanford) are
the first sibling combination in history to compete in
women's Olympic volleyball.
Oden, who was a four-time All-American and a na
tional Player of the Year, would like nothing better than
to add a gold medal to her list of accomplishments.
Scott Fortune already has a gold medal, which he won in
Seoul as a member of the U.S. men's volleyball team. For
tune was one of the younger members of the 1988 team, but
in Barcelona he will be a team leader as the U.S. goes for
back to back golds. And don't forget Andrew Vlahov, who
will be bumping and dunking for the Australian hoops
team.
In addition to student participation, a number of Stan
ford coaches, including men's volleyball coach Fred
Sturm and men's soccer coach Colin Lindores, will be
leading United States teams in Barcelona.

Olympic glory will not necessarily end with
medal-winning performances in Barcelona.
Success in Spain will assuredly translate into
personal financial windfalls for athletes and also serve
to enhance Stanford's recruiting program.
Sanders decided last April to quit the Stanford swim
ming team so that she would be able to avoid the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association's stringent regu
lation of athletic endorsements. A good performance
this summer could translate into a seven-figure income
from endorsements, say many advertising experts.
In addition, Olympic success for Cardinal athletes
could significantly help Cardinal recruiting, according
to Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland.
"It gives us tremendous visibility," Leland said, "and
visibility always helps in recruiting."
While Leland thinks that this visibility helps Stanford
athletics in general, he specifically singled out swimming
as a sport where recruiting could be greatly impacted.
But beyond recruiting gains, Leland sees an even
greater benefit in Stanford athletes participating in the
Olympics. "It's the culmination of a lot of work on part of
the coach and athlete," Leland said, "and that's a wonder
ful thing."

Jackie Edwards

Most people would call becoming
an Olympian at 17 "peaking too
soon."
But most people don't know the
talent of Jackie Edwards.
This list may include Edwards her
self. She called her third place perfor
mance in the triple jump at the NCAA
Indoor Championships "a surprise."
But while none may know her full
potential, her feats show tremendous
capabilities.

The Bahamian National Team member finished first at
this year's NCAA Championships in the long jump, her
Olympic event. She had a leap of 21' 7 1/2", which is still
short of her career best 21' 8 3/4", set at last year's NCAA
Championships. She also placed 10th in the event in last
year's World Championships.
Edwards established herself as a top triple jumper, fin
ishing second at this season's NCAA Championships with
a 43' 4 1/2" effort. Early on in her Stanford career, it ap
peared that Edwards might have peaked too soon. She
could only muster long jumps of 20' 1" and 20' 5" in fresh
man and sophomore seasons, respectively. This is in con
trast to the 20' 7" long jump best she established before
she had set foot on the Stanford Stadium runway.
But things began to turn around for her in her junior
campaign. The best long jumper in Stanford history fin
ished second in that event in the Pacific 10 Championships
in 1991. She won the triple jump at the same competition.
Then, she finished second in the nation in the long jump.
So, the critics may have been right about Jackie Ed
wards. She just might have peaked too soon. But, there is
a funny thing about great athletes.
They just seem to have more peaks.
—Af. Scott Walker

Lea Loveless

For Lea Loveless, deciding where to
attend college after a sensational high
school evHrnming career was the hardest
decision she's ever had to make. And she
had to make it twice.
A highly recruited backstroker com
ing out of high school in Crestwood,
New York, three years ago, Loveless
narrowed her choices to Florida, Stan
ford and California before finally set
tling on Florida.
A bad move, she discovered a year

later. Florida's coach, Randy Reese, quit after her freshman
season; several of her teammates then decided to leave, drop
ping Florida from serious contention for the national title.
"Probably the first thing I said was that I should have gone
to Stanford in the first place," Loveless said. She transferred
to the Farm and redshirted dining the 1991 season, as re
quired by NCAA regulations.
Sitting out a year was hard, said Loveless, who calls team
competition "the best aspect" of swimming. "It makes you ap
preciate it more, makes you want to take advantage of every
opportunity you have," she said.
Last season, in her first year of Stanford eligibility, Love
less carved out a niche for herself on the nation's perenially
top-ranked swim team. Competing in the 100 and 200-yard
backstroke, Loveless won the Pacific 10 Conference champi
onship in both events, and a national championship in the
100 backstroke.
She was also a member of Stanford's 400-yard medley relay
team, which easily outpaced UCLA to win the national title.
In the Olympics, Loveless is not favored to win a medal in
her two events, the 100 and 200-meter backstroke. But she
may qualify for a spot on the 400-meter medley relay team,
which is nearly guaranteed to win a gold.

Jair Lynch

You hate to have doubts about a tal
ented athlete, but there were some
doubts about Jair Lynch. Most were
minor objections, but one was more lin
gering. It was the belief that Jair Lynch
was not consistent.
Lynch obliterated that criticism.
The gymnast used his recently com
pleted junior season to remove the
questions about his past performance.
In the process, he lifted the Stanford
men's gymnastics team to its first na

tional title in history.
There had been no doubt about Lynch's ability — but con
sistency had always been a problem, although Lynch re
mained Stanford's top all-around gymnast.
This year changed that perception. Meet after meet, Lynch
kept putting up great numbers. "I can see his [strength] im
proving rapidly now," said his coach, Sadao Hamada, earlier
this year.
The improvement began to manifest itself at the Winter
Nationals. Lynch turned himself from Olympic hopeful to
U.S. National Team member, finishing 12th despite a miscue
in the floor exercise.
He followed this performance with a better one in the U.S.
Championships in late May. Lynch finished third in this com
petition, garnering a berth on the Olympic team.
In between, Lynch accomplished another one of his goals as
the Cardinal won an NCAA Championship. Lynch scored a
sparkling 59.025 during the team competition to lead the way.
Lynch was also named Pacific 10 Conference Gymnast of
the Year.
Lynch goes to Barcelona with plenty of weight behind him.
He carries both weighty expectations md weighty credentials.
But he will not carry the weight of doubt.
—Af. Scott Walker

Jeff Rouse

Jeff Rouse takes his strokes in
stride.
A throe-time NCAA champion in the
100-yard backstroke and a world record
holder in the 100-meter backstroke,
Rouse has been swimming religiously
every day for"the past 15 or 17 years."
World-ranked for the past three
years, Rouse is also a two-time Pacific
10 Conference 100-yard back champi
on as well as the 1989 NCAA champi
on in the 200-yard backstroke.

But he sports a laid-back attitude.
"You could talk with him for hours and you'd never guess
he was a great swimmer," said men's swimming coach Skip

tenths of a second from the world record he set in the Pan-

Rouse holds two of the fastest 100-back times ever swum in
the United States, as well as six of the nine fastest times overall.
"Going to the Olympics and winning a gold medal would
mean that all those years.. .of swimming every single day
[would have] paid ofT," Rouse said earlier this year.
At Barcelona this summer, he is half way there.
And if Rouse wins a gold medal in the 100-meter back
stroke as expected, Barcelona will likely become much more
than "just another meet" for him.
