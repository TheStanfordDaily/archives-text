## How to maintain a tradition of winning 
### Matthew Milliken Staff writer 
"I think I'm scared to death
every year of whether or not we're
going to do okay."
The Stanford baseball office is
decorated by photographs of the
team's two NCAA championships,
but assistant coach and head re
cruiter Dean Stotz knows that
past victories can never ensure a
triumphant future.
In fact, success can sometimes
complicate matters. While Stan
ford's baseball accomplishments are
attractive, Stotz says many
prospects are intimidated by the
school's reputation: "The kid [often |
fears being able to play or being able
to do the work academically."
"We take a pretty aggressive ap
proach," Stotz said. "We are not
the easiest road." The coach's
main job is to find players who can
rise to the challenge.
Assistant coach David Esquer
says that Stanford's athletic renown
creates other recruiting complica
tions: "The kind of high-caliber ath
lete we want is the same kind of ath
lete that pro scouts look for."
That means that many prospec
tive Stanford athletes will be
drafted. "There's really two re
cruiting seasons," says Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "First
you compete against other
schools; then you compete against
Major league Baseball."
"That's becoming more and
more difficult," Stotz confesses.
Stanford Athletic Director Ted
Leland notes that the sport and
the school create two unusual

Helling signed a contract with

announced.
Helling is currently in

Workin' 9 to 5
The Department of Athletics
has been reorganizing its staff,
and various employees arc getting
new titles and responsibilities.
Cheryl Levick was named se
nior associate athletic director,
and it will be her job to oversee 21
intercollegiate sports, as well as
personnel, sports medicine, and
eligibility.
Tom Beckett will be the asso
ciate athletic director for external
affairs, which include the Stan
ford golf course, marketing and
promotions, the Stanford Band,
and the ticket office, among oth
ers.
Recruiting Coordinator Keith
Sparks was named assistant ath
letic director of student services
and Karen Bennett is the new
associate athletic director in
charge of accounting.
Athletic Director Ted Leland
explained the moves: "We have
downsized our department, and
this has meant additional respon
sibilities for many people .... We
now have a management team in
place and are ready to move
ahead."

problems. Since the majors draft
so many players, Marquess can
lose more players than coaches in
other sports. Stanford's draw
back.
But a pro contract does not al
ways mean a pro career. There are
only 625 major league players. As
Stotz points out, "you have about
as much chance playing in the big

leagues as you do of being a Con
gressman."
Accordingly, Marquess says his
"biggest concern is that the play
ers graduate." As Stotz explains,
"there's no use going to Stanford if
you're not going to walk out of
here with a piece of paper that says
Stanford. Academics always take
priority over baseball."

This is true even for juniors.
Esquer — who has two Stanford
degrees— asserts that the players
"all have something going for
them beyond baseball."
Although many coaches have
complained about recent NCAA
restrictions on practice time, the
baseball program has adjusted
with relative ease. In the past,

class conflicts usually prevented
most players from practicing more
than 20 hours a week.
Stotz is critical, however, of the
mandatory day oft. "When a play
er comes to you and says, 'Hey, I'm
really getting this, can I work with
you one-on-one?' you have to look
him in the eye and say 'No.' It frus
trates the athlete to no end."
The NCAA postseason tourna
ment selection committee has also
been troublesome. "You're not
going to go to LSU or Texas or
Florida State and win too often,"
Stotz. Hostile crowds are less chal
lenging than time zones. Last
May, Stanford players woke at
3:30 a.m. California time for post
season competition in Tallahas
see, Florida. "That's a tough
task," says Stotz.
The Cardinal faces another
tough task in 1993. "We've never
ever had to play with this young a
team," says Stotz. The Cardinal
will have only one veteran starting
pitcher and must replace its catch
er as well as the entire outfield.
Stanford will need talented
freshman and sophomores to do
that successfully. "If we can hold
this recruiting class, where 10 guys
were drafted — that's a pretty good
recruiting class," says Stotz.
But can they bring victory?
"There's going to have to be some
players who are going to have to
have their very best years next
year," Esquer said.
Such are the difficulties caused
by success. The Stanford baseball
program has earned a host of hon
ors, but its coaches still face a
swarm of concerns.

"We've defied the odds," said Cardinal head coach Mark Marquess. His teams made 11 trips to postsea
son play in the last 12 years.
