# NOSE TO NOSE
## What's the scoop on U.S. hoop? 
### 
Sean, as a political science
msyor, you of all people should
understand why the United
States created the ultimate
nightmare to the sport of bas
ketball, the Dream Team.
We want to destroy and hu
miliate all the other countries at
the Olympics.
This has nothing to do with
sports or sportsmanship, my
good buddy. This is all about po
litical superiority.
With the Soviet Union turn

ing into a big
jigsaw puzzle,
we are now the
only bully on
the block. Dur
ing the Gulf
War, we re
minded every
one how tough
we were by
beating up on
the Republican
Guard. These
Iraqi "elite tank
divisions" were
more overrated

than Clyde Drexler, but the
army's spin doctors made it
sound like we were trying to
slam dunk over Manute 801.
So of course we kicked some
serious butt and proved just how
big and strong we really were.
If you think about it, this is ex
actly the scenario which the
Dream Team will follow. They
warmed up against a few Latin
American patsies, not unlike the
Marines did in Grenada and
Panama. Now that they've
stretched their muscles and made
sure that they won't tear a ham
string, the members of the Dream
Team are ready to go into combat.
The team's head spin doctor,
coach Chuck Daly, is telling
everybody that he hopes that we

won't get beat by the Croatian
and Lithuanian juggernauts.
Yeah, sure Chuck, and Dan
Quayle might be able to spell
potato. But I digress. ...
So we're building up these
oh-so-scary enemies that we will
absolutely demolish when we
get them on the court. The gold
medal will signify yet another
beating inflicted on the world by
the baddest kid on the block, the
United States of America.
We've been having some

problems with
the New World
Order lately, but
that will all
change after the
Olympics. No
body, not even
people in the
U.S., wants to
buy American
goods. Not sur
prisingly, we've
got a bizillion
dollar trade
deficit.
But not unlike

the schoolyard bully who steals
lunch money from the weaker
kids on the playground, we are
gonna get rid of that deficit by
shaking down all the other coun
tries. This is great! We'll send
the Dream Team to Japan next,
I'm sure.
This all sounds a little far
fetched, but I'm being semi-seri
ous here. Some genius some
where figured out a way to
reestablish our country as the
world's policeman without
spilling a drop of blood. Just
kick the stuffing out of the An
golan basketball team.
Think about it Sean, George
Bush has got to do something
drastic to catch up to Clinton in
the polls.

Love it or leave it, Noah.
Where's your spirit? The
Olympics are about every nation
sending its best athletes to com
pete.
The Dream Team is our best,
and if it's a lot better than every
body else's best, so be it. Hell,
the Soviets/Russians/Whatev
ers dominated Olympic hockey
tournaments for 30-plus years.
Far as I can see, there's nothing
wrong with us winning one little
gold medal.

Sport and na
tionalism have
always been in
extricably inter
twined. In other
international
sports, like ten
nis or soccer, peo
ple always follow
the progress of
their home coun
try. Can you
imagine Brazil
sending its best
college futbol
players to the

World Cup?
The Olympics have been no
less about nationalism. The gold
medal winner's national an
them is played at the medal cer
emony — how much more na
tionalistic can you be. Didn't it
seem wrong that the Olympic
hymn was played when the
Commonwealth of Independent
States' hockey team won their
gold medals in Albertville?
But there are other, basket
ball-oriented reasons why the
Dream Team isn't that bad an
idea, Noah. Look at the long
term. The international com
munity has always risen to the
level of whatever greatness is
displayed at the Olympics. Our
1960 basketball team, with the

likes of collegians Jerry West
and Oscar Robertson, was ab
solutely unbeatable, but in 20
yedrs, many nations had
reached the level of our best col
lege players.
Now it's time to go to the next
level. Who knows, in twenty
years, maybe every nation will
have a Dream Team. And as a
fan, that's all right with me.
And t he Dream Team is really
no more elitist than our old
Olympic teams. It's always just

twelve guys who
get to go to the
Olympics, be
they pros or col
legians. Give
Adam Keefe four
or eight years,
and maybe he'll
get his shot as
well.
In fact, I
would say that
USA Basketball
should quit the
college tokenism
altogether. Does

Christian Laettner really belong
on this team? They could have
hired someone to carry the play
ers' bags — they didn't have to
fill up a roster spot with a porter.
I know you'll love this Tin
Man reference, Noah, but have a
heart. Think about Larry and
Magic, who never got a chance at
the Olympics in college. Won't
they look good in gold?
Most importantly, just enjoy
the theater. You like pro
wrestling, and that's even more
predetermined than this
Olympics. This is an event you'll
probably never see again, the
twelve greatest basketball play
ers in the world on the same
team. It's not competitive, but it
sure is fun.
