## SIX WHO SING ... AND MORE Fresh from Arsenio, JOYFULL NOIZE Hits Stanford 
### Matthew Kanuck Staff writer 
The fresh gospel sound of Joy
full Noize is rapidly becoming
known across the nation. Tonight
at 8 p.m., the six person a capella
group will flood the Coffee House
with their vocal instrumentation.
Soon to appear in a page-one
profile in the Wall Street Journal,
Joyfull Noize has performed on
the Arsenio Hall Show and
opened for two-time Grammy
winners the Winans at the Circle
Star Theater.
Joyfull Noize's jazzy-rap vocals
span various styles of a capella
song, with an emphasis on tradi
tional gospel. The intimate set
ting of the Coffee House should
provide an excellent opportunity
to experience the tremendous tal
ent of these emerging stars —
Shawn and Epheann Lloyd of
Hercules, Greg and Janice Cobbs
of Pinole, Lisa DeVore of Pacifica
and Mike Nelson.
Along with enlightening
gospel, tonight's sets will include
renditions of songs by Bobby Mc-
Ferrin, Lee Adams, Cole Porter
and Boyz II Men. Joyfull Noize
has great versatility and will cer
tainly intermingle the flavor of
old styles with jazz and Top 40
songs.
"We like to talk to the audience
before the show," said Epheann
Lloyd. "Being open and receptive,
we can find out what they want to
hear. It breaks the ice and lets us
stimulate the audience with a
powerful opener."
The sextet has found much
success with their original gospel
pieces. While jazzy and updated,

the songs of Joyfull Noize retain
the soulful roots that make gospel
music so alluring. Joyfull Noize's
tight harmony combined with
rocking pop elements create a
splendidly rich sound.
"We like to think it's a capella
at its finest," said Epheann Lloyd.
The group believes producing
distinctive music will bring them
to stardom. Joyfull Noize will
tour the country for two months,
beginning in September.

'We like to talk to the
audience before the
show. It breaks the ice
and lets us with stimu
late the audience with
a powerful opener.'

Upon their return, the group
will begin developing a new
album. Their hope is that Joyfull
Noize will be signed by a major
recording label so their music will
reach an audience beyond gospel
fans.
Within the group are the song
writers, arrangers, musicians,
producers, graphic artists and
fashion designers that bring Joy
full Noize's show to the stage.
It is a full-time job for manager
Epheann Lloyd, whose responsi
bilities include operating the
group's own publishing and
recording companies.
Fashion designer Janice Cobbs
has translated the classy yet ener

getic nature of Joyfull Noize into
artful dress for the singers. The
refined performers rejoice with a
modern, confident and enthusias
tic look.
"We try to project a positive
self image," said Epheann Lloyd.
"Too many groups today focus on
negative themes."
Joyfull Noize celebrates the
positive elements of life and
wants to encourage achievement.
"People should strive for their
own goals," said Epheann Lloyd.
Shawn and Epheann Lloyd
founded the group in 1989, adopt
ing the odd spelling of "Joyfull
Noize" to avoid confusion between
the Bay Area sensation and an
Ohio gospel band of the same
name.
Although rehearsals are still
held at the Lloyds' residence, Joy
full Noize has been on a rocket to
the stars for the past three years.
Even after appearing with
modern gospel sensations the
Winans and being guests on the
Arsenio Hall Show, Joyfull
Noize's members do not feel like
celebrities yet. Although destined
to be stars, they are still humble
when complemented by the likes
of Bill Cosby.
Most recently, Joyfull Noize
has returned from an extended
stay in Las Vegas where they did a
show "every hour on the hour for
five days" at the National Home
builders Association's conven
tion, said Epheann Lloyd.
Since the Black Filmmakers'
Annual Hall of Fame invited them
to appear two years ago, Joyfull
Noize has been in demand. Before
returning to the Hall of Fame to
perform at the 1991 event, Joyfull
Noize worked on the soundtrack
for "Back to the Future - Part III"
and sang at the movie's premiere.
Later, the singers represented
the Bay Area in gospel music at
the 1991 Black Expo in Oakland,
and the nationally syndicated
television show "Soul Beat"
played their video.
In February, Joyfull Noize held
a concert at Kimball's East, the
same venue that hosts performers
including Patti Austin, Dizzie
Gillespie and Lou Rawls. The Mu
sician's Coffeehouse Concert Se
ries in Walnut Creek brought the
sextet to the stage in May.
Last year, KQED hosted Joy
full Noize for a live national per
formance during National Public
Radio's "West Coast Weekend."
Radio stations KM EL and KDIA
currently play selections from
Joyfull Noize's album "Can't
Stop."
Bay Area Music Magazine
writer Steve Stolder compared
the recorded collection to the
music of Take 6. He described
Joyfull Noize's work as "comfort
ing" and "soul cleansing."
The six singers are all mem
bers of the Church of Christ. Fol
lowing their belief that the Bible
instructs people to praise the
Lord vocally instead of instru
mentally, they have developed
their a capella troupe.


Joyfull Noize, an a capella group that emphasizes traditional gospel,
performs tonight at the Coffee House at 8 p.m.
