Northern 'Adjuster'
"The Adjuster"
When most people think of
Canadian film, wildlife documen
taries or puerile comedies ("Meat
balls," "Strange Brew") are all
that come to mind.
Yet several Canadian directors
are on the cutting edge of narra
tive film, such as David Cronen
berg, who led Canada's New Wave
with such films as "The Fly" and
"Naked Lunch."
Atom Egoyan, an Egyptian-
Canadian filmmaker, has quietly
made a name for himself. His
films examine the deteriorating
nuclear family and the effect of
technology on human relation
ships. Egoyan's latest release,
"The Adjuster," is his most cohe
sive and assured yet.
Noah Render (Elias Koteas) is
a handsome insurance adjuster
taking care of clients who have
lost their homes to fire and other
catastrophes. He puts them all up
in the same motel and tends to
their every need — both in and out
of bed.
Meanwhile, his wife Hera (Ar
sinee Khanjian), a government
censor, secretly records the most
violent and sexually explicit parts
of the films that she classifies.
When a wealthy ex-football
player named Bubba (Maury
Chaykin) takes over Noah's home
to make a film starring his lover,
Noah is forced to move into the
motel, where his carefully con
structed life slowly falls apart.
The film opens by cutting be
tween scenes of Noah, Hera, and
Bubba engaged in their respective
activities. At first, nothing seems
to be related. Slowly, Egoyan
brings the characters together in
a series of confrontations that
builds toward an unsettling fi
nale.
Egoyan's style frequently sub
verts the viewer's assumptions
and expectations. Noah appears
to be overly solicitous of his
clients' needs, giving them what
ever he thinks they need, includ
ing himself. But his obsequious
ness masks a sociopathy that
Egoyan slowly reveals.
Similarly, when Hera's boss
confronts her with her surrepti
tious videotaping, believing that
he has found a kindred spirit who
enjoys the censored material, her
motives are completely different
from what the audience expects.
In this film, form meets con
tent. The Renders live in the iso
lated model home of a bankrupt
housing development, effectively
symbolizing their isolation from
the rest of the world and from

each other.
The film's images are often
breathtaking. This is Egoyan's
second 35 mm film, and he has al
ready mastered the format. He
uses skewed composition and ex
aggerated close-ups in an almost
subliminal way, unsettling the
viewer as much as the story.
The acting is first-rate. Koteas
makes Noah's manipulation
seem uncalculated, making his
character even more disturbing.
Chaykin, whose creepy lieu
tenant unnerved audiences in
"Dances With Wolves" surpasses
his previous performance as the
sympathetic, yet menacing
Bubba.
And Khanjian — also the direc
tor's wife — plays Hera with a
fierce intelligence and quiet inner
strength.
Egoyan describes "The Ad
juster" as "a film about believable
people doing believable things in
an unbelievable way." His ap
proach creates a film that is as un
settling as "Blue Velvet," without
relying on any of David Lynch's
shock value. For that alone, his
film stands as a towering achieve
ment.

Multiple channels
"Man Trouble"
Seeing "Man Trouble," the ro
mantic comedy starring Jack
Nicholson and Ellen Barkin, is
like watching television when
someone else has the remote con
trol.
There are about six or seven
halfway decent films going on
throughout "Man Trouble," but
just as one aspect of the movie be
comes interesting, someone
changes the channel.
Barkin plays Joan, a classical
singer who begins to experience
"mysterious events." Her apart
ment gets trashed but nothing's
stolen. After moving to her sis
ter's palatial home, she's fright
ened by a drunken gardener and a
creepy message on the answering
machine.
But none of these events seems
{jarticularly disturbing, especial
y because Joan's overreaction to
them downplays their true seri
ousness. Her decision to rent a
guard dog from Harry Bliss
(Nicholson) seems silly and mere
ly a contrivance to get Barkin and
Nicholson together.
Of course, Barkin and Nichol
son shouldn't have to do much
more than stare at each other to
make the movie screen begin to
smolder at the edges.
But their romance appears to
happen in two or three different
films simultaneously, and you
wish they'd just stick to one ro
mantic development.

Barkin's character makes no

sense, and her progression from
helpless victim to take-no-prison
ers savior of her sister (Beverly
D'Angelo) is unmotivated and
jarring.

Flashes of a pret
ty decent movie
or two pass by as
director Bob
Rafelson flips
from channel to
channel.

Perhaps it makes sense, then,
that Nicholson never really
seems that interested in Barkin.
It's almost as if he didn't want to
hurt her feelings by leaving her in
her time of distress.
The saddest part is Nichol
son's throwaway character. Sup
posedly a con man with a heart of
gold, doing what he has to do to
survive, Harry Bliss is all
pablum.
Occasionally a fleeting refer
ence to his shady past is thrown
out, but he's not bad enough to
make any sort of transformation
(of which there is none) heart
warming.

Thrown in are piecemeal bits
of subplot, such as D'Angelo's
kidnapping by her ex-boyfriend, a
shady businessman or gangster
or drug dealer... or something.
There's also a serial killer
loose in the film (but only in the
newspapers), a "Fatal Attrac
tion"-like obsession, and
glimpses of Harry's shady past,
including his marriage to an of
fensive Asian stereotype Harry
refers to as "Iwo Jima."
It's all one big mess, despite
flashes of a pretty decent movie
or two passing by as director Bob
Rafelson flips from channel to
channel. Several interesting
characters, like D'Angelo's Andy
or her boyfriend (Harry Dean
Stanton) are talked about
throughout the film, but only for
a brief moment do we even get to
meet them.
Heck, even the dog is under
used. Harry's attachment to his
best dog doesn't materialize until
the scene where he has to give
him up, so who cares?
Various plot elements are re
solved underneath the closing
credits, a cheap and lazy way to
conclude a film. But at least it ties
up some of the loose ends, since
quite a few pesky ones remain
even after the movie ends. Or
rather, when the filmmakers
press the off button.

A comedy smash
"A Stranger Among Us "
Disney's Hollywood Pictures
has just released this summer's
funniest film. Funnier than "Sis
ter Act," "A League of Their
Own" and "Boomerang" put to
gether, the screenplay and lead
performances combine to elicit
constant laughter, often to the
point of tears.
But "A Stranger Among Us"
isn't supposed to be a comedy. Di
rected by Sidney Lumet ("Dog
Day Afternoon"), the film stars
Melanie Griffith as Emily Eden, a
New York police officer who goes
undercover in the reclusive Ha
sidic Jewish community to solve a
murder.
Her relationship with the
rabbi's son Ariel (Eric Thai)
forces her to confront her spiritu
al emptiness and lack of family.
Though the concept doesn't
sound comic, its execution cer
tainly is. Robert J. Avrech's
screenplay appears to have been
put together with a sledgeham
mer.
The murder investigation is all

but forgotten as Eden and Ariel
fall in love. Avrech never estab
lishes why Eden would find the
straight-laced Ariel interesting,
making subsequent scenes of the
lovers expressing their mutual
angst laughable.
Many of the scenes portraying
the rules of Hasidic life are played
for laughs. Eden comes to ques
tion the rabbi wearing a short
skirt and sleeveless top, then
looks askance as the rabbi's
daughter tries to cover her bare
skin.
A subsequent scene where she
almost puts a carton of milk in
the meat fridge is handled in
much the same way.
Griffith is completely miscast
as Emily Eden. Though the film
makers describe her as a "hard
ened cop," they must have been
referring to a different film. Grif
fith's babyish, high-pitched voice
and slow cadence undermine the
audience's ability to believe in
her.
But the fault is not hers alone.
The opening scenes, as Eden
botches an arrest and then shoots
down a fleeing suspect, are hilar
iously over the top. Eden is so
clueless about Jews that she has
to ask what "the camps" are.
Griffith is also saddled with
such great cop lines as "It's going
down," "I shot the perp" and
"We're dealing with some serious
scumbags here."
The mediocrity of the dialogue
is surpassed only by that of the
characters. In order to show just
how "Jewish" Eden has become,
Avrech partners her with Levine,
a Jewish cop who publicly and
vulgarly derides the Hasidic way
of life and constantly begs Eden
to sleep with him.
If the source of his derision
had been explained, Levine could
have been a compelling character
instead of an offensive one.
The film's only saving grace is
its naturalistic shots of the Ha
sidim in prayer, at religious cere
monies and at play.
These scenes are fascinating,
but more suited to a good docu
mentary. In "A Stranger Among
Us," however, they only seem out
of place because little context is
given to help understand them.
The filmmakers said they al
ways wanted to make a film about
the Hasidim. Yet Lumet, Avrech,
and Howard Rosenman, the
film's producer — all of whom are
Jewish — have managed to create
an atrocious and sometimes of
fensive film. Fortunately for
them, the Hasidim won't be see
ing this film anytime soon.

Insurance adjuster Noah Render (Elias Koteas) bones up on his archery skills In"The Adjuster," a new
film from Egyptian-Canadian Atom Egoyan.
Northern 'Adjuster'
"The Adjuster"
When most people think of
Canadian film, wildlife documen
taries or puerile comedies ("Meat
balls," "Strange Brew") are all
that come to mind.
Yet several Canadian directors
are on the cutting edge of narra
tive film, such as David Cronen
berg, who led Canada's New Wave
with such films as "The Fly" and
"Naked Lunch."
Atom Egoyan, an Egyptian-
Canadian filmmaker, has quietly
made a name for himself. His
films examine the deteriorating
nuclear family and the effect of
technology on human relation
ships. Egoyan's latest release,
"The Adjuster," is his most cohe
sive and assured yet.
Noah Render (Elias Koteas) is
a handsome insurance adjuster
taking care of clients who have
lost their homes to fire and other
catastrophes. He puts them all up
in the same motel and tends to
their every need — both in and out
of bed.
Meanwhile, his wife Hera (Ar
sinee Khanjian), a government
censor, secretly records the most
violent and sexually explicit parts
of the films that she classifies.
When a wealthy ex-football
player named Bubba (Maury
Chaykin) takes over Noah's home
to make a film starring his lover,
Noah is forced to move into the
motel, where his carefully con
structed life slowly falls apart.
The film opens by cutting be
tween scenes of Noah, Hera, and
Bubba engaged in their respective
activities. At first, nothing seems
to be related. Slowly, Egoyan
brings the characters together in
a series of confrontations that
builds toward an unsettling fi
nale.
Egoyan's style frequently sub
verts the viewer's assumptions
and expectations. Noah appears
to be overly solicitous of his
clients' needs, giving them what
ever he thinks they need, includ
ing himself. But his obsequious
ness masks a sociopathy that
Egoyan slowly reveals.
Similarly, when Hera's boss
confronts her with her surrepti
tious videotaping, believing that
he has found a kindred spirit who
enjoys the censored material, her
motives are completely different
from what the audience expects.
In this film, form meets con
tent. The Renders live in the iso
lated model home of a bankrupt
housing development, effectively
symbolizing their isolation from
the rest of the world and from

each other.
The film's images are often
breathtaking. This is Egoyan's
second 35 mm film, and he has al
ready mastered the format. He
uses skewed composition and ex
aggerated close-ups in an almost
subliminal way, unsettling the
viewer as much as the story.
The acting is first-rate. Koteas
makes Noah's manipulation
seem uncalculated, making his
character even more disturbing.
Chaykin, whose creepy lieu
tenant unnerved audiences in
"Dances With Wolves" surpasses
his previous performance as the
sympathetic, yet menacing
Bubba.
And Khanjian — also the direc
tor's wife — plays Hera with a
fierce intelligence and quiet inner
strength.
Egoyan describes "The Ad
juster" as "a film about believable
people doing believable things in
an unbelievable way." His ap
proach creates a film that is as un
settling as "Blue Velvet," without
relying on any of David Lynch's
shock value. For that alone, his
film stands as a towering achieve
ment.

Multiple channels
"Man Trouble"
Seeing "Man Trouble," the ro
mantic comedy starring Jack
Nicholson and Ellen Barkin, is
like watching television when
someone else has the remote con
trol.
There are about six or seven
halfway decent films going on
throughout "Man Trouble," but
just as one aspect of the movie be
comes interesting, someone
changes the channel.
Barkin plays Joan, a classical
singer who begins to experience
"mysterious events." Her apart
ment gets trashed but nothing's
stolen. After moving to her sis
ter's palatial home, she's fright
ened by a drunken gardener and a
creepy message on the answering
machine.
But none of these events seems
{jarticularly disturbing, especial
y because Joan's overreaction to
them downplays their true seri
ousness. Her decision to rent a
guard dog from Harry Bliss
(Nicholson) seems silly and mere
ly a contrivance to get Barkin and
Nicholson together.
Of course, Barkin and Nichol
son shouldn't have to do much
more than stare at each other to
make the movie screen begin to
smolder at the edges.
But their romance appears to
happen in two or three different
films simultaneously, and you
wish they'd just stick to one ro
mantic development.

Barkin's character makes no

sense, and her progression from
helpless victim to take-no-prison
ers savior of her sister (Beverly
D'Angelo) is unmotivated and
jarring.

Flashes of a pret
ty decent movie
or two pass by as
director Bob
Rafelson flips
from channel to
channel.

Perhaps it makes sense, then,
that Nicholson never really
seems that interested in Barkin.
It's almost as if he didn't want to
hurt her feelings by leaving her in
her time of distress.
The saddest part is Nichol
son's throwaway character. Sup
posedly a con man with a heart of
gold, doing what he has to do to
survive, Harry Bliss is all
pablum.
Occasionally a fleeting refer
ence to his shady past is thrown
out, but he's not bad enough to
make any sort of transformation
(of which there is none) heart
warming.

Thrown in are piecemeal bits
of subplot, such as D'Angelo's
kidnapping by her ex-boyfriend, a
shady businessman or gangster
or drug dealer... or something.
There's also a serial killer
loose in the film (but only in the
newspapers), a "Fatal Attrac
tion"-like obsession, and
glimpses of Harry's shady past,
including his marriage to an of
fensive Asian stereotype Harry
refers to as "Iwo Jima."
It's all one big mess, despite
flashes of a pretty decent movie
or two passing by as director Bob
Rafelson flips from channel to
channel. Several interesting
characters, like D'Angelo's Andy
or her boyfriend (Harry Dean
Stanton) are talked about
throughout the film, but only for
a brief moment do we even get to
meet them.
Heck, even the dog is under
used. Harry's attachment to his
best dog doesn't materialize until
the scene where he has to give
him up, so who cares?
Various plot elements are re
solved underneath the closing
credits, a cheap and lazy way to
conclude a film. But at least it ties
up some of the loose ends, since
quite a few pesky ones remain
even after the movie ends. Or
rather, when the filmmakers
press the off button.

A comedy smash
"A Stranger Among Us "
Disney's Hollywood Pictures
has just released this summer's
funniest film. Funnier than "Sis
ter Act," "A League of Their
Own" and "Boomerang" put to
gether, the screenplay and lead
performances combine to elicit
constant laughter, often to the
point of tears.
But "A Stranger Among Us"
isn't supposed to be a comedy. Di
rected by Sidney Lumet ("Dog
Day Afternoon"), the film stars
Melanie Griffith as Emily Eden, a
New York police officer who goes
undercover in the reclusive Ha
sidic Jewish community to solve a
murder.
Her relationship with the
rabbi's son Ariel (Eric Thai)
forces her to confront her spiritu
al emptiness and lack of family.
Though the concept doesn't
sound comic, its execution cer
tainly is. Robert J. Avrech's
screenplay appears to have been
put together with a sledgeham
mer.
The murder investigation is all

but forgotten as Eden and Ariel
fall in love. Avrech never estab
lishes why Eden would find the
straight-laced Ariel interesting,
making subsequent scenes of the
lovers expressing their mutual
angst laughable.
Many of the scenes portraying
the rules of Hasidic life are played
for laughs. Eden comes to ques
tion the rabbi wearing a short
skirt and sleeveless top, then
looks askance as the rabbi's
daughter tries to cover her bare
skin.
A subsequent scene where she
almost puts a carton of milk in
the meat fridge is handled in
much the same way.
Griffith is completely miscast
as Emily Eden. Though the film
makers describe her as a "hard
ened cop," they must have been
referring to a different film. Grif
fith's babyish, high-pitched voice
and slow cadence undermine the
audience's ability to believe in
her.
But the fault is not hers alone.
The opening scenes, as Eden
botches an arrest and then shoots
down a fleeing suspect, are hilar
iously over the top. Eden is so
clueless about Jews that she has
to ask what "the camps" are.
Griffith is also saddled with
such great cop lines as "It's going
down," "I shot the perp" and
"We're dealing with some serious
scumbags here."
The mediocrity of the dialogue
is surpassed only by that of the
characters. In order to show just
how "Jewish" Eden has become,
Avrech partners her with Levine,
a Jewish cop who publicly and
vulgarly derides the Hasidic way
of life and constantly begs Eden
to sleep with him.
If the source of his derision
had been explained, Levine could
have been a compelling character
instead of an offensive one.
The film's only saving grace is
its naturalistic shots of the Ha
sidim in prayer, at religious cere
monies and at play.
These scenes are fascinating,
but more suited to a good docu
mentary. In "A Stranger Among
Us," however, they only seem out
of place because little context is
given to help understand them.
The filmmakers said they al
ways wanted to make a film about
the Hasidim. Yet Lumet, Avrech,
and Howard Rosenman, the

scumbags here."
The mediocrity of the dialogue
is surpassed only by that of the
characters. In order to show just
how "Jewish" Eden has become,
Avrech partners her with Levine,
a Jewish cop who publicly and
vulgarly derides the Hasidic way
of life and constantly begs Eden
to sleep with him.
If the source of his derision
had been explained, Levine could
have been a compelling character
instead of an offensive one.
The film's only saving grace is
its naturalistic shots of the Ha
sidim in prayer, at religious cere
monies and at play.
These scenes are fascinating,
but more suited to a good docu
mentary. In "A Stranger Among
Us," however, they only seem out
of place because little context is
given to help understand them.
The filmmakers said they al
ways wanted to make a film about
the Hasidim. Yet Lumet, Avrech,
and Howard Rosenman, the
film's producer — all of whom are
Jewish — have managed to create
an atrocious and sometimes of
fensive film. Fortunately for
them, the Hasidim won't be see
ing this film anytime soon.

Insurance adjuster Noah Render (Elias Koteas) bones up on his archery skills In"The Adjuster," a new
film from Egyptian-Canadian Atom Egoyan.
Northern 'Adjuster'
"The Adjuster"
When most people think of
Canadian film, wildlife documen
taries or puerile comedies ("Meat
balls," "Strange Brew") are all
that come to mind.
Yet several Canadian directors
are on the cutting edge of narra
tive film, such as David Cronen
berg, who led Canada's New Wave
with such films as "The Fly" and
"Naked Lunch."
Atom Egoyan, an Egyptian-
Canadian filmmaker, has quietly
made a name for himself. His
films examine the deteriorating
nuclear family and the effect of
technology on human relation
ships. Egoyan's latest release,
"The Adjuster," is his most cohe
sive and assured yet.
Noah Render (Elias Koteas) is
a handsome insurance adjuster
taking care of clients who have
lost their homes to fire and other
catastrophes. He puts them all up
in the same motel and tends to
their every need — both in and out
of bed.
Meanwhile, his wife Hera (Ar
sinee Khanjian), a government
censor, secretly records the most
violent and sexually explicit parts
of the films that she classifies.
When a wealthy ex-football
player named Bubba (Maury
Chaykin) takes over Noah's home
to make a film starring his lover,
Noah is forced to move into the
motel, where his carefully con
structed life slowly falls apart.
The film opens by cutting be
tween scenes of Noah, Hera, and
Bubba engaged in their respective
activities. At first, nothing seems
to be related. Slowly, Egoyan
brings the characters together in
a series of confrontations that
builds toward an unsettling fi
nale.
Egoyan's style frequently sub
verts the viewer's assumptions
and expectations. Noah appears
to be overly solicitous of his
clients' needs, giving them what
ever he thinks they need, includ
ing himself. But his obsequious
ness masks a sociopathy that
Egoyan slowly reveals.
Similarly, when Hera's boss
confronts her with her surrepti
tious videotaping, believing that
he has found a kindred spirit who
enjoys the censored material, her
motives are completely different
from what the audience expects.
In this film, form meets con
tent. The Renders live in the iso
lated model home of a bankrupt
housing development, effectively
symbolizing their isolation from
the rest of the world and from

each other.
The film's images are often
breathtaking. This is Egoyan's
second 35 mm film, and he has al
ready mastered the format. He
uses skewed composition and ex
aggerated close-ups in an almost
subliminal way, unsettling the
viewer as much as the story.
The acting is first-rate. Koteas
makes Noah's manipulation
seem uncalculated, making his
character even more disturbing.
Chaykin, whose creepy lieu
tenant unnerved audiences in
"Dances With Wolves" surpasses
his previous performance as the
sympathetic, yet menacing
Bubba.
And Khanjian — also the direc
tor's wife — plays Hera with a
fierce intelligence and quiet inner
strength.
Egoyan describes "The Ad
juster" as "a film about believable
people doing believable things in
an unbelievable way." His ap
proach creates a film that is as un
settling as "Blue Velvet," without
relying on any of David Lynch's
shock value. For that alone, his
film stands as a towering achieve
ment.

Multiple channels
"Man Trouble"
Seeing "Man Trouble," the ro
mantic comedy starring Jack
Nicholson and Ellen Barkin, is
like watching television when
someone else has the remote con
trol.
There are about six or seven
halfway decent films going on
throughout "Man Trouble," but
just as one aspect of the movie be
comes interesting, someone
changes the channel.
Barkin plays Joan, a classical
singer who begins to experience
"mysterious events." Her apart
ment gets trashed but nothing's
stolen. After moving to her sis
ter's palatial home, she's fright
ened by a drunken gardener and a
creepy message on the answering
machine.
But none of these events seems
{jarticularly disturbing, especial
y because Joan's overreaction to
them downplays their true seri
ousness. Her decision to rent a
guard dog from Harry Bliss
(Nicholson) seems silly and mere
ly a contrivance to get Barkin and
Nicholson together.
Of course, Barkin and Nichol
son shouldn't have to do much
more than stare at each other to
make the movie screen begin to
smolder at the edges.
But their romance appears to
happen in two or three different
films simultaneously, and you
wish they'd just stick to one ro
mantic development.

Barkin's character makes no

sense, and her progression from
helpless victim to take-no-prison
ers savior of her sister (Beverly
D'Angelo) is unmotivated and
jarring.

Flashes of a pret
ty decent movie
or two pass by as
director Bob
Rafelson flips
from channel to
channel.

Perhaps it makes sense, then,
that Nicholson never really
seems that interested in Barkin.
It's almost as if he didn't want to
hurt her feelings by leaving her in
her time of distress.
The saddest part is Nichol
son's throwaway character. Sup
posedly a con man with a heart of
gold, doing what he has to do to
survive, Harry Bliss is all
pablum.
Occasionally a fleeting refer
ence to his shady past is thrown
out, but he's not bad enough to
make any sort of transformation
(of which there is none) heart
warming.

Thrown in are piecemeal bits
of subplot, such as D'Angelo's
kidnapping by her ex-boyfriend, a
shady businessman or gangster
or drug dealer... or something.
There's also a serial killer
loose in the film (but only in the
newspapers), a "Fatal Attrac
tion"-like obsession, and
glimpses of Harry's shady past,
including his marriage to an of
fensive Asian stereotype Harry
refers to as "Iwo Jima."
It's all one big mess, despite
flashes of a pretty decent movie
or two passing by as director Bob
Rafelson flips from channel to
channel. Several interesting
characters, like D'Angelo's Andy
or her boyfriend (Harry Dean
Stanton) are talked about
throughout the film, but only for
a brief moment do we even get to
meet them.
Heck, even the dog is under
used. Harry's attachment to his
best dog doesn't materialize until
the scene where he has to give
him up, so who cares?
Various plot elements are re
solved underneath the closing
credits, a cheap and lazy way to
conclude a film. But at least it ties
up some of the loose ends, since
quite a few pesky ones remain
even after the movie ends. Or
rather, when the filmmakers
press the off button.

A comedy smash
"A Stranger Among Us "
Disney's Hollywood Pictures
has just released this summer's
funniest film. Funnier than "Sis
ter Act," "A League of Their
Own" and "Boomerang" put to
gether, the screenplay and lead
performances combine to elicit
constant laughter, often to the
point of tears.
But "A Stranger Among Us"
isn't supposed to be a comedy. Di
rected by Sidney Lumet ("Dog
Day Afternoon"), the film stars
Melanie Griffith as Emily Eden, a
New York police officer who goes
undercover in the reclusive Ha
sidic Jewish community to solve a
murder.
Her relationship with the
rabbi's son Ariel (Eric Thai)
forces her to confront her spiritu
al emptiness and lack of family.
Though the concept doesn't
sound comic, its execution cer
tainly is. Robert J. Avrech's
screenplay appears to have been
put together with a sledgeham
mer.
The murder investigation is all

but forgotten as Eden and Ariel
fall in love. Avrech never estab
lishes why Eden would find the
straight-laced Ariel interesting,
making subsequent scenes of the
lovers expressing their mutual
angst laughable.
Many of the scenes portraying
the rules of Hasidic life are played
for laughs. Eden comes to ques
tion the rabbi wearing a short
skirt and sleeveless top, then
looks askance as the rabbi's
daughter tries to cover her bare
skin.
A subsequent scene where she
almost puts a carton of milk in
the meat fridge is handled in
much the same way.
Griffith is completely miscast
as Emily Eden. Though the film
makers describe her as a "hard
ened cop," they must have been
referring to a different film. Grif
fith's babyish, high-pitched voice
and slow cadence undermine the
audience's ability to believe in
her.
But the fault is not hers alone.
The opening scenes, as Eden
botches an arrest and then shoots
down a fleeing suspect, are hilar
iously over the top. Eden is so
clueless about Jews that she has
to ask what "the camps" are.
Griffith is also saddled with
such great cop lines as "It's going
down," "I shot the perp" and
"We're dealing with some serious
scumbags here."
The mediocrity of the dialogue
is surpassed only by that of the
characters. In order to show just
how "Jewish" Eden has become,
Avrech partners her with Levine,
a Jewish cop who publicly and
vulgarly derides the Hasidic way
of life and constantly begs Eden
to sleep with him.
If the source of his derision
had been explained, Levine could
have been a compelling character
instead of an offensive one.
The film's only saving grace is
its naturalistic shots of the Ha
sidim in prayer, at religious cere
monies and at play.
These scenes are fascinating,
but more suited to a good docu
mentary. In "A Stranger Among
Us," however, they only seem out
of place because little context is
given to help understand them.
The filmmakers said they al
ways wanted to make a film about
the Hasidim. Yet Lumet, Avrech,
and Howard Rosenman, the
film's producer — all of whom are
Jewish — have managed to create
an atrocious and sometimes of
fensive film. Fortunately for
them, the Hasidim won't be see
ing this film anytime soon.
