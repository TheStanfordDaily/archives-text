# Jazz concerts sure to satisfy
## 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
Occasionally the Stanford campus experiences a
weekend so chock-full of tremendously entertaining
happenings, that residents within a 12-mile radius
become inebriated with anxiety, disbelief and deliri
um, unable to decide upon a single selection from the
brimming bounty of delectable marvels.
Sadly, the next one isn't due until 2099.
Fortunately the Stanford Jazz Workshop Concert
Series has assembled a duo of musical diversions, in
cluding the sophisticated vocals of Kitty Margolis and
the geomusical escapades of trumpet legend Don
Cherry and the Hieroglyphics Ensemble.
The Workshop's weekend begins on Friday with
Margolis and the Dick Hindman Trio. This musically
endowed songstress is sure to dazzle anyone suffering
from exceptional jazz-vocal deprivation.
"Jazz Times" heralded her as "the discovery of the
1989 Monterey Jazz Festival." Ayear later, she pilfered
a frenzied standing ovation from Monterey's 1990 Fes
tival audience, a difficult feat in itself due to the usual
ly high expectations of jazz fans in attendance.
Living up to her early successes hasn't been very
difficult for this versatile performer, though. Her
first album, "Kitty Margolis: Live at the Jazz Work
shop, " won her nationwide acclaim and radio air play.
Since then, Margolis has continued to reap her share
of success.
Growing up in the Bay Area, Margolis was influ
enced by jazz-style vocalists like Nat "King" Cole,
Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday from an early age.
She began her singing career in fourth grade, and
continued her musical growth through junior high
and high school.
Margolis studied briefly at Harvard where she ma
jored in Visual and Environmental Studies, before re
turning to the Bay Area and the Broadcast and Com
munication department of San Francisco State.
"It was at S.F. State," she said, " that I fell in love
with the risk-taking, the spontaneity, the creative
freedom of jazz."
Upon graduation, she began her own private stud
ies of the vocal art, including observation of and in
teraction with jazz musicians as they passed through
San Francisco.

One need only glance at her current success to un
derstand the benefits of her "graduate school" edu
cation. However, her words still describe it best:
"Singingjazz involves your mind, your heart, your
spirit and your body, and you have to integrate them
all in a split second. It's an incredibly disciplined
process, yet the best jazz singers take a lot of chances
and make it all seem effortless. A lot of the secret boils
down to trusting yourself, and it doesn't hurt to have
a sense of humor."
A sense of humor can be nice, but audiences won't be
listening for Don Cherry's wit Saturday night. Instead
they'll be listening for a truly magnificent musician in
action with Berkeley's own Hieroglyphics Ensemble.
A group of musicians who aren't strangers to col
laborative efforts, Cherry and the Hieroglyphics'
blend of Nigerian, Afro-Cuban, and reggae
polyrhythms, smothered over jazz arrangements and
improvisation, entice the music down the familiar
trail of dance music.
"I think it's important to recognize that when
great musicians like Louis Armstrong and Coleman
Hawkins were breaking away from melodies and
playing improvised solos, it was all music that was
being danced to," explained Hieroglyphics leader
Peter Apfelbaum.
What they have done is take the standard format of
the big swing band of the '30s and '40s, and season it
with a masala of various ethnic music forms and in
struments.
Cherry, often a featured performer of the group,
applies his improvisational skills, adding yet another
sumptuous layer to the thick melodic molasses.
He has lent his musical talents to the genius of Or
nette Coleman as well as Sonny Rollins, has toured
extensively in Europe and Africa, and has taught at
Dartmouth College.
While this weekend's workshop lineup won't nec
essarily hold you until 2099, it's definitely a musical
prescription that only the dullest of couch potato(e)s
might abhor.

Kitty Margolis and the Dick Hindman Trio will ap
pear Friday at 8 p.m. in Campbell Recital Hall. Don
Cherry and the Hieroglyphics will appear Saturday
at Bp.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. For more infor
mation, call 725-ARTS.
