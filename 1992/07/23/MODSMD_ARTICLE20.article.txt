# 'Sadomusicism' jams

Five untested local bands will
get a chance in the spotlight to
morrow night during the "Stan
ford Summer Jam '92," a free
community concert targeted at
Bay Area youth organizations.
Among the bands scheduled to
perform is MC Player and the DP
Posse, interviewed by Fab 5 Fred
dy earlier this year on the popular
MTV program, "Yo! MTV Raps."
The concert — which is located
on Tresidder's front patio and be
gins at 7 p.m. — is sponsored by
"Stanford Sadomusicism," a
group founded this summer by
sophomore Leslie Shen and junior
John Newsome.
The group's goal, Shen said, is
to "bring music to the communi
ty" — particularly to its more
needy members, such as youths
and the elderly.
Much of the group's previous
work this summer has focused on
organizing concerts for retire
ment homes, but Bay Area youth

organizations — such as the Day
break Shelter, which houses
homeless kids aged 16 to 19 —
have received special invitations
to this concert.
Shen said she and Newsome
have been calling the youth organi
zations, and they have "been really
receptive about bringing people
here."
Transportation to Stanford
shouldn't be a problem, Shen ex
plained, because most shelters
have vans. "We thought this way,
we'd benefit more people than if we
went to one place and focused on
one group," she said. But she added
that she has "no idea" of precisely
how many people will show up.
To attract performers for the
concert, Shen and Newsome posted
fliers in the area. They lured local
bands like DBT & DJ Aztech, a rap
group, and Fated Flower, a Stan
ford band that will perform an
eclectic mix of covers, ranging from
the Red Hot Chili Peppers to
Suzanne Vega.
The band also plays original
songs, Shen said.
