I hope I have to work this Sunday. I need
a convenient excuse to avoid having to
choose between two events sure to be
solidly entertaining — the San Francisco
Chronicle's 12th Annual Comedy Day and
the Children's Health Council 33rd Annu
al Pops in the Park Summer Symphony at
Frost Amphitheatre.
When I was 17,1 went to one of the early
Comedy Days, back when it was held at the
Randshell in Golden Gate Park. My best
friend and I rode BART, took a long bus ride
to the edge of the park and then walked for
what seemed like forever, only to find the
remaining good spot was directly behind a
tree about a mile from the stage.
But after four hours and 60 comics, it
didn't matter. We'd laughed ourselves silly
and been treated to the surprise appear
ance of Whoop i Goldberg, who'd been film
ing "Jumpin' Jack Flash" in the City and
popped by the celebration to say hello.
It's clear the event is a major bonding

experience for the huge San Francisco
comedy scene, and it's great fun to be a part
of it. They've since moved the event to the
park's Polo Field, where presumably no
trees will get in your way.
Picnics are still welcome.
A picnic would also go nicely with Pops

in the Park, which overlaps slightly with
Comedy Day. A jazz band will entertain
during pre-concert picnicking, and then
Melissa Manchester and the San Francisco
Ballet Orchestra take the stage for this
benefit concert.
I seem to recall that around the same
time I went to Comedy Day for the first
time, Melissa Manchester was pretty popu
lar. The song I remember the most: "You

Should Hear How He Talks About You."
This could be a blast-from-the-past over
load weekend.
.. -Although "Man Trouble" certainly
isn't anywhere close to being on my list of
movies I'd recommend seeing (see review,
page 16), I was most disappointed by the
turnout at the Park Theater Monday
evening.
If this film were playing in one of the gi
gaplexes, there'd be at least a dozen people
at the midday showing. For some reason, a
theater with only one or two screens scares
people, and it's a darn shame.
While the "art house" theaters around
town — like the Park, the Guild and the
Varsity — may not have the menu-like se
lections of the Century 9000s, they more
than make up for it with style.
Many of the artsy fdms that show at
these theaters are quite exceptional. Per
sonally, I can't wait for Daniel Day-Lewis in
"The Last of the Mohicans," opening soon.

But what really makes these houses a
treat is the old-time feel they evoke. Cur
tains that part as the feature begins. Deco
rative painted ceilings and wall sconces.
Tickets from a roll or a slot in the counter,
not computerized ones telling you the
cashier's name.
The only movie theater in my home
town was called the Park. It's now a Chris
tian revival center. Sigh. . .ah, the good ole'
days.
.. .FOX finally broke into the big time
last week, winning a night in the Nielsen
ratings for the first time in its history. With
its brand new Wednesday night lineup, in
cluding "Beverly Hills 90210" and "Mel
rose Place," FOX beat coverage of the De
mocratic National Convention on the other
networks.

Chris Shuttles worth. The Weekly's enter
tainment editor, is feeling mighty nostalgic
this week.
