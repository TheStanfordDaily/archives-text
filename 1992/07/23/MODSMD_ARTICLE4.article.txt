Arson in the
Foothills
7 Palo Alto Fire
Department investi
gators said arson is the
likely cause of three
small brush fires last
week. One of the three
blazes closed roads and
clogged traffic in the area
for hours, but no dam
ages or injuries were
reported in any of the
fires. In addition, the
proximity of the three
fires worried fire investi
gators. "These fires are
very suspicious," said
Palo Alto fire Capt. Mick
Mac Donald.

Libraries lose out
8 Coping with the blows
of budget cuts,
Stanford's stacks face the
threat of being unable to
provide adequate service
for the community. An
increasing number of pro
fessors fear that the sys
tem will suffer in the
long term and handicap
their ability to produce
quality research. Said
Asst. Philosophy
Professor Rachel Cohon,
'There's going to be a
pretty rapid loss of quali
ty compared with other
good university
libraries."

medals as a reward for

dedication. Women's
swimming coach Richard
Quick said of Stanford,
"The standards set in
academics and athletics
are unparalleled."
