## Column Election '92 at midpoint 
### 
We are midway through the
1992 presidential election
year: The primaries are
over, Ross Perot's 'almost' candi
dacy is finished, and the Democra
tic convention is behind us. The
general outline of what lies ahead
is now clear.
This is a good time to take stock
and to try to anticipate how the
primaries, the Perot candidacy
and the Democratic convention
will affect the remainder of elec
tion 1992.
The 1992 primaries were a
compound of familiar elements. It
should not surprise us that a suc
cessful and, therefore, popular
president seeking renomination
will face weak opposition within
his own party and that the compe
tition for the other party's nomi
nation will be among political fig
ures who are 'less than the best.'
One year before the 1992 pri
mary elections began — the time
when politicians interested in the
presidency evaluate their
prospects — President Bush ap
peared to be headed for renomina
tion without challenge and for
'certain' re-election.
Many Democratic leaders who
were expected to compete for the
nomination decided to sit it out.
Inexplicably, these leaders were
unwilling, unprepared or other
wise unable to reverse their deci
sions when President Bush's pop
ularity began to decline.
Six months before the pri
maries began, the economy re
emerged as the main domestic
news story. The news was not good
and, as usual, bad news took its toll
on support for the president.
The 1992 primaries illustrate
once again the power of media ex
pectations: On the Republican
side, without serious opposition,
George Bush was expected to win
in a walk.
Wresting the nomination from
an incumbent president — even a
moderately unpopular incumbent
— is no easy task; only the quixot
ic try it. By New Year's Day 1992
the only challenger willing to
enter the lists against President
Bush was Pat Buchanan.
On the Democratic side, Gover
nor Clinton was considered the
frontrunner in a weak field. Clin
ton was expected to do well in New
Hampshire and lock up the nomi
nation on Super Tuesday.
Both the Bush and Clinton can
didacies suffered from negative
news and from opponents able to
exploit this negative information.
The media portrayed Bush and
Clinton as damaged goods.
Buchanan limited President
Bush to sixty percent of the vote in
New Hampshire. After New
Hampshire Buchanan got a steady
thirty-plus percent of the Republi
can primary vote until the nomi
nation was settled.
Initially, Paul Tsongas ap
peared as Clinton's rival for the
nomination; his first place finish
in New Hampshire, was interpret
ed as Clinton's failure rather than
the success of a regional candidate.
As the limits of Paul Tsongas'
appeal beyond New England be
came apparent and Governor
Brown did unexpectedly well in a
primary or two, media attention
switched its focus to Brown and
his generally nihilistic and specifi
cally anti-Clinton message.
Brown dominated media cover
age between Tsongas' withdrawal
and the New York primary. Ini
tially this news was positive — fo
cusing primarily on his style of
campaigning and his success in
building an anti-Clinton coalition.
But after Brown's success in
Connecticut, press attention
shifted to his program and his per
formance as governor of Califor
nia. New York ended the game for

Brown.
The Buchanan and Tsongas-
Brown insurgencies, although
they failed to prevent the nomina
tions of President Bush and Gov
ernor Clinton, gave rise to the
Perot candidacy. Perot began to
attract a following after it became
clear that Bush and Clinton were
the two party nominees.
In other words, Perot's attrac
tiveness rose at the point that the
limited but sizeable 'anyone but
Bush' and 'anyone but Clinton'
sentiment could no longer attach
to a candidate in the major parties.
Unlike the candidates of splin
ter parties, the news and 'talk
show' media treated Perot as a le
gitimate alternative to the major
party candidates because of his
success in business and his ex
pressed willingness to devote a
considerable amount of his own
funds to the effort.
Perot's remarkable showing in
the polls — from mid-May through
mid-June he led all the three-way
'trial heat' polls — earned him the
kind of coverage that attaches to
front runners; namely, lots of cov
erage, very close scrutiny of the
record, prominent display and a
'warts and all' presentation.
With Perot in the lead and
Bush close behind, Clinton began
to be treated as an 'also ran.' Clin
ton's coverage was limited in June
but what was there proved helpful
to his candidacy. By June, Clin
ton's 'character flaws' were no
longer news.
His non stop campaigning and,
in contrast to Perot, his willingness
to present the specifics of his eco
nomic policies received a positive
reception in the press. By July the
absence of attack from active oppo
nents — Bush and Perot were di
recting their attacks at each other
— the presence of generally posi
tive press and the advent of the
convention brought Clinton even
with his rivals for the presidency.
On the eve of the convention —
with the selection of Senator Gore
as his running mate, which was
well received by Democratic party
leaders and given a sympathetic
response by the media — Clinton
moved into first place in the polls.
Since the 1970 rewriting of the
rules of the Democratic party, the
nomination of the candidate for the
president has been settled in the
primaries. The party's convention,
having lost its traditional role of se
lecting the nominee, has taken on
the task of kicking off the general
election campaign by presenting
the nominee to the American elec
torate in the best possible light.
A feature of this presentation is
portraying the nominee as leading
a party whose disparate elements
have been welded into a unit. The
extent the party succeeds in this
effort can be gauged by the
'bounce' in the nominee's stand
ing in the polls.
In this respect, the 1992 Demo
cratic convention was a success. It
is impossible to separate the con
vention bounce in support for
Clinton from the boost he received
from Perot's stepping aside. But
