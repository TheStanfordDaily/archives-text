## Openness would have averted tension 
### 
Tensions between graduate student
parents and administrators at the Cowell Stu
dent Health Center could and should have been
avoided with better communication and openness in
the decision-making process.
While graduate students with children are under
standably concerned about the loss of pediatric
health care at Cowell, they should understand that
the center could not afford to continue a program
that loses $50,000 a year.
But Cowell administrators deserve much of the
blame for not providing the parents with the infor
mation they needed earlier. They owe it to their
clients to keep them informed of major changes like
this one while they are still in the proposal stage.
Much of the frustration shown by the graduate stu
dents was generated by the lack of information on the
proposal until it was a fait accompli.
Now, with the decision finalized, Cowell expects to
release information later this week about the quality
and cost of care that will be available at the Welch
Road practice — the Harvey, Ball, and Sharron group
— that has agreed to provide pediatric services for
students in place of Cowell.
The information comes a little late in the process
for many graduate students, who will have only a
week to find another doctor for their children before
Cowell closes its pediatric services Aug. I.'
That is unfair to students, and could have been
avoided if Cowell had solicited the input of those peo
ple who would be most affected by the discontinua
tion of these services — student parents.
Instead, the decision was made silently and with
out formal notification of parents. Those who learned
of the proposal did so through 'the grapevine.' Let

ters written by parents asking Cowell to reconsider
apparently had no effect.
In fact, the first meeting between concerned stu
dents and administrators came last Thursday, after
the decision had been finalized.
The result of this approach is that students were
shocked by Cowell's decision and left with little time
to look for alternative care for their children.
Clearly, open dialogue is what is needed to ensure
that the campus' children will not lack health care
simply because their parents study at Stanford. Stu
dents need to be informed of the kind of service that
will be available to them and about other alternatives
they could pursue.
On their part, the students should make an effort
to understand Cowell's position. The pediatric ser
vices are being discontinued because the center can
not afford them. The switch may ultimately have no
effect on the quality of pediatric care, if indeed the
Welch Road practice is able to provide comparable
service at a comparable cost.
The practice's location on Welch Road may be far
ther from Escondido Village than Cowell, but the in
convenience is by no means prohibitive — it certain
ly does not merit sustaining a $50,000 annual loss to
avoid it.
The key concerns then are openness, communica
tion and effort by the University to ensure that the
level of service and the cost of pediatric health care
will not change drastically. The University owes this
much consideration to its students.
In any administrative decision, there is a sure
method to avoid conflict and make optimal choices —
to involve, from the beginning, those who will be
most affected.
