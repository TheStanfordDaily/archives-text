How to go after a
woman: Don't be
thick, be friendly
A couple of students (Sharon
Beaulaurier and now Richard
Juang) have maintained on these
pages that the way for strangers to
respect a woman's fear of rape is to
not approach her or be friendly to
her when she is by herself.
But the only people who could
possibly be moved by this advice
are people who interact with oth
ers with an eye to what is mutual
ly desirable. Rapists are by defini
tion not this sort.
Women's reasons to fear would
not be ameliorated, but a heavy
cost would be imposed. The biggest
complaint — the saddest most con
sistent complaint — that I hear
from my women friends is that
they don't get asked out.

Some of the sexiest women I
have ever known, when they do not
happen to be placed in a circle of
friends or people at work that con
tain love interests for them, have
the worst time meeting men.

Sure they get approached by
some unappealing sorts, but the
nice guys all seem to be holding
back, and if an appealing man does
approach, it is glancing and he
fails to make it effectual by secur
ing some way to communicate fur
ther.
The needed advice runs exactly
the opposite of what is being given.
If a man feels a keen interest in
knowing the first thing about
some woman who attracts him, he
should by all means look for some
way to extend that interest and
give her a chance to pick up on it if
she wants to.
As for being just friendly with
out any advance interest, or any in
terest conditional upon attraction,
I fail to understand the objection.
When I am mountain biking
and overtake someone, I almost al
ways slow down for a chat with the
rare compatriot, male or female.
I find I like almost everyone I
meet, and have several times
found the companionship so com
plaisant that we have finished a
whole ride together.
It is easy enough to tell if some
one wants to be left alone. Thus it
is entirely gratuitous — and to my
mind not at all kind — to restrain

one's interest in other people
based on a presumption that oth
ers don't want one to be friendly.
Paternalism is ill advised here
for the same reason it is generally
ill advised: because it occludes
valuable opportunities.
The Art of Life (as J.S. Mill
called it) consists in learning to
not throw away value, both in how
we proceed individually and in
how we interact with others.
That being said, there is plenty
of room for advice about how to
understand each other.
For men, the obvious thing is to
renounce any tendency to be thick
about a woman's desires. The only
place where one can ever find
value is in the truth. But that
doesn't mean be hypersensitive.
If she only seems a little ner
vous, don't be deterred. She has
nothing to fear from you and
should be credited with the same
interest in meeting friendly people
as anyone else. (If she does have
reason to fear that your desires for
interaction will be irrespective of
her desires, go jump ofT a cliff.)
To women, my advice is, don't
feel that you cannot be friendly. I
