## ASSU, Tresidder propose merger 
### 
A proposal to consolidate the
accounting functions of the ASSU
Business Office with Tresidder
Union management has been met
with some criticism from several
present and former ASSU offi
cials.
The plan, which is being dis
cussed by a committee of Universi
ty and ASSU officials, calls for sev
eral changes to be made in the
ASSU's relationship with Tresid
der, including the possible reloca
tion of some business projects, the
reorganization of office space and
a sharing of accounting services.
Under a plan that Tresidder is
proposing, the ASSU's two ac
countants would move their of
fices into the Tresidder financial
office, said Derek Miyahara, the
summer senate chair. The ASSU
financial staff would be "cross
trained" to perform both student
and Tresidder financial work, he
said.
"We are working to build a clos
er relationship with the ASSU,"
said Roberta Braden, Tresidder's
director. "And we are looking at
streamlining as a way of saving
money in both offices."
Paul Szczesiul, an associate di
rector of Tresidder, said the Uni-

versity and the
ASSU had been
examining how to
consolidate oper
ations for the past
two years.
He said the
need to merge
similar functions
became more
pressing after the

University cut its more than
$100,000 per year contribution to
the ASSU's operating budget. The
University money had been used
to pay for the ASSU's costs in act
ing as a banking service to student
organizations.
Szczesiul said that by consoli
dating operations, the cost of pro
viding banking services would be
much less, providing a net savings
to the University.
"We are trying to work with the
ASSU in helping them to evolve
with the times and through the
budget-cutting process, as well as
working to keep in place a system
that allows them to manage re
sources effectively," said Dean of
Students Michael Jackson.
But Douglas Bone, a former
graduate senator, doesn't see any
significant cost savings in the pro
posal.
"I'd hate to see more bureau
cracy put in the way of students
using their funds," said Bone.
"This proposal will not necessarily
create improved economies of
scale."
He said he is worried about the
quality of a University-run system
in serving students. "I'm afraid
the University will be less respon
sive to students' needs. It could
turn out to be too complicated and
involved for student groups to deal
with," he said.
Former Council of Presidents
member John Overdeck said the
consolidation does not represent
"a forfeiture of any real power to
the University — but there is a
good reason to be worried if no
body is monitoring the (universi
ty's actions) on the ASSU side."
"It seems like a power grab by
Tresidder," he said.
But Tresidder officials say they
do not want to take control of the
organization, only trim excess fat.
"We have no interest in wanti
ng to control the business of the
ASSU, providing the accounting is
done properly and there is suffi
cient oversight over transactions,"
Szczesiul said. "The money in the
care of the ASSU must be carried
out carefully. But this is not an at
tempt to take control and make de
cisions for the ASSU."
Jackson said the consolidation

will allow the University to pro
vide guidance and advice to the
ASSU, since the University has fi
nancial oversight of the student
government.
Overdeck sees the merger as
detrimental to the ASSU "because
much of what the ASSU does is fi
nance-related. It makes the ASSU
less important because many of
the useful things the ASSU does
for students is in the banking
area."
In addition, it is possible that
the ASSU will no longer provide
student group banking services
after this year. If that happens,
most student organizations will
probably be allowed to bank inde
pendently, saving the ASSU thou
sands of dollars in administrative
costs, Jackson said.
The committee will also discuss
the possibility of moving the
ASSU Shirt Shackinto the infor-

mation window's
first floor space.
The more promi
nent location,
Miyahara said,
will help boost
sales.
The group will
consider creating
a joint ASSU-
Tresidder recep-

tion area in the ASSU's office area.
While the committee will meet
again next week, Braden said she
does not expect anything more
than office moves to occur before
fall quarter. Changes in the bank
ing system most likely will not be
finalized until later in the year,
she said.
Miyahara said he is opposed to
the changes and will introduce a
bill at the summer senate's first
meeting next month to "state our
position" on the reorganization.
"Tresidder looks like they're
going to do it,"he said. "We've got
to try and make it happen in our
best interests."

University President Donald Kennedy talks to 40 high school students at Branner Hall on Tuesday.
Kennedy advised the students about how to choose a college, telling them that a good academic experi
ence "should open your eyes to the joy of mental work."
A proposal to consolidate the
accounting functions of the ASSU
Business Office with Tresidder
Union management has been met
with some criticism from several
present and former ASSU offi
cials.
The plan, which is being dis
cussed by a committee of Universi
ty and ASSU officials, calls for sev
eral changes to be made in the
ASSU's relationship with Tresid
der, including the possible reloca
tion of some business projects, the
reorganization of office space and
a sharing of accounting services.
Under a plan that Tresidder is
proposing, the ASSU's two ac
countants would move their of
fices into the Tresidder financial
office, said Derek Miyahara, the
summer senate chair. The ASSU
financial staff would be "cross
trained" to perform both student
and Tresidder financial work, he
said.
"We are working to build a clos
er relationship with the ASSU,"
said Roberta Braden, Tresidder's
director. "And we are looking at
streamlining as a way of saving
money in both offices."
Paul Szczesiul, an associate di
rector of Tresidder, said the Uni-

versity and the
ASSU had been
examining how to
consolidate oper
ations for the past
two years.
He said the
need to merge
similar functions
became more
pressing after the

University cut its more than
$100,000 per year contribution to
the ASSU's operating budget. The
University money had been used
to pay for the ASSU's costs in act
ing as a banking service to student
organizations.
Szczesiul said that by consoli
dating operations, the cost of pro
viding banking services would be
much less, providing a net savings
to the University.
"We are trying to work with the
ASSU in helping them to evolve
with the times and through the
budget-cutting process, as well as
working to keep in place a system
that allows them to manage re
sources effectively," said Dean of
Students Michael Jackson.
But Douglas Bone, a former
graduate senator, doesn't see any
significant cost savings in the pro
posal.
"I'd hate to see more bureau
cracy put in the way of students
using their funds," said Bone.
"This proposal will not necessarily
create improved economies of
scale."
He said he is worried about the
quality of a University-run system
in serving students. "I'm afraid
the University will be less respon
sive to students' needs. It could
turn out to be too complicated and
involved for student groups to deal
with," he said.
Former Council of Presidents
member John Overdeck said the
consolidation does not represent
"a forfeiture of any real power to
the University — but there is a
good reason to be worried if no
body is monitoring the (universi
ty's actions) on the ASSU side."
"It seems like a power grab by
Tresidder," he said.
But Tresidder officials say they
do not want to take control of the
organization, only trim excess fat.
"We have no interest in wanti
ng to control the business of the
ASSU, providing the accounting is
done properly and there is suffi
cient oversight over transactions,"
Szczesiul said. "The money in the
care of the ASSU must be carried
out carefully. But this is not an at
tempt to take control and make de
cisions for the ASSU."
Jackson said the consolidation

will allow the University to pro
vide guidance and advice to the
ASSU, since the University has fi
nancial oversight of the student
government.
Overdeck sees the merger as
detrimental to the ASSU "because
much of what the ASSU does is fi
nance-related. It makes the ASSU
less important because many of
the useful things the ASSU does
for students is in the banking
area."
In addition, it is possible that
the ASSU will no longer provide
student group banking services
after this year. If that happens,
most student organizations will
probably be allowed to bank inde
pendently, saving the ASSU thou
sands of dollars in administrative
costs, Jackson said.
The committee will also discuss
the possibility of moving the
ASSU Shirt Shackinto the infor-

mation window's
first floor space.
The more promi
nent location,
Miyahara said,
will help boost
sales.
The group will
consider creating
a joint ASSU-
Tresidder recep-

tion area in the ASSU's office area.
While the committee will meet
again next week, Braden said she
does not expect anything more
than office moves to occur before
fall quarter. Changes in the bank
ing system most likely will not be
finalized until later in the year,
she said.
Miyahara said he is opposed to
the changes and will introduce a
bill at the summer senate's first
meeting next month to "state our
position" on the reorganization.
