# Casper arrives, gets to work

### 
Incoming University President
Gerhard Casper is expected to
work "shoulder to shoulder" with
Donald Kennedy during the next
month, as part of a transition peri
od intended to more fully familiar
ize Casper with Stanford before he
officially takes over Sept. 1.
Casper arrived on campus
Tuesday, and immediately set up
an office in the Foothills, at the se
cluded Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences.
As Casper prepares for the
presidency, he plans to continue

doing what he has for the past five
months: brushing up on Stanford
history, meeting with University
officials and researching reports
by University committees.
But Casper and Kennedy will
also work together during the
transition so that Casper becomes
acquainted with some of the prob
lems "that may bubble to the sur
face," Kennedy said.
"I'm just making sure that I lo
cate all the land mines for him,"
Kennedy said. "I just don't want to
forget any."
The task is proving to be "very
demanding," Kennedy said — and
it is "emotionally non-trivial" as
well, as he realizes from time to
time that he "is doing some of
these things for the last time."
Ted Mitchell, the deputy to the
president and provost who has
acted as Casper's aide during the
transition, said Casper and
Kennedy "will try to take as much
advantage of the overlap as possi
ble — to sort of work shoulder to
shoulder on projects so that there
won't be any down time at the be
ginning of September."
Jean Fetter — who will become
Casper's assistant Sept. 1 and al
ready has her "shoulder to the
wheel," according to Mitchell —
said she is looking forward to
working with Casper during the
transition.
But it will be challenging be
cause of the "steep learning curve
for everybody involved," she said.
Meanwhile, an eight-member
committee of faculty and staff is
preparing for Casper's Oct. 2 inau
guration, which many say will be
more highly anticipated than past
ceremonies because Casper comes
to Stanford as an outsider.
"Don Kennedy was known, and
respected by many of us," said De
velopmental Biology Prof. David
Clayton, chair of the committee
planning the inauguration. But
about Casper, "most people only
know what they've read in the
newspaper or seen at a press con
ference — or heard from their col
leagues at Chicago."
And Fetter said "there is always
some uncertainty with unknown
quantities — everybody is eager to
meet him."
Classes have been canceled for
the day of the inauguration, which
will take place in Frost Amphithe
ater.
Stephen Peeps, an associate
vice president in the Office of De
velopment who is one of the com
mittee members, said the inaugu
ration will be a relatively "short
and simple" affair, with "no
hoopla."
The inauguration ceremony
will begin at 9 a.m., and Casper's

speech — his first public address
to the Stanford community — will
be its highlight.
Board of Trustees President
John Friedenrich will also speak,
and planners are hoping that
Kennedy and former University
President Richard Lyman will
speak as well, Peeps said.
No other speakers are planned,
he said. After the speeches in
Frost, there will be a reception at
mid-day in the Inner Quad, with a
receiving line so that Casper and

his wife, Regina,
can meet people.
They will be
available "as long
as it takes to get
everyone greet
ed," Peeps said.
Casper will
not give a speech
to next year's
freshman class

during Orientation, as the univer
sity president traditionally does,
because it would have "preempt
ed" his inaugural address, Peeps
said.
Instead, Casper intends to
"make a special point of address
ing new students" within his
broader remarks at the inaugura
tion, according to Peeps.
Peeps expects a "large" audi
ence for the ceremony, because of
the heightened anticipation over
hearing Casper's first public
speech, but he is uncertain about
exactly how many people might at
tend.
Tickets will be distributed to all
faculty, staff and students on a
first-come, first-served basis some
time during the week of Sept. 28,
when students arrive for classes.
