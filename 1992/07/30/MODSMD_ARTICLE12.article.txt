# Kennedy reflects on his presidency
## 
### 
In an informal talk to about 40
high school students on Tuesday,
University President Donald
Kennedy assessed the achieve
ments of his presidency and evalu
ated the state of Stanford after
budget cuts — along with giving
his anxious audience some fatherly
advice on picking the right college.
Kennedy's talk, made in Bran
ner Hall to students taking cours
es in Stanford's summer school
program, was his last visit to a dor
mitory before he steps down Aug.
31 and is replaced by Gerhard
Casper.
Although he was hesitant to
evaluate his own performance,
comparing it to telling a "long, ram -
bling joke" that loses its effect,
Kennedy outlined four accomplish
ments that he considers his most

enduring legacies. They were:
• The University's five-year
Centennial fund-raising cam
paign, which raised nearly $1.3
billion. Although Kennedy said
many other university presidents
consider fund raising a "vulgar
and disgusting" chore — and "it
certainly isn't something I like to
do" — he said he could not down
play the "huge success" of the
drive, which raised $167 million
more than its goal.
• The "gradual and sustained
improvement" in the "character"
of Stanford residential life. Im
provement often came in the
midst of trying experiences,
Kennedy said. A "couple of un
pleasant incidents" at Ujamaa in
1988 "brought unfavorable pub
licity," he said, but were impor
tant in precipitating discussion on
racial issues.
By the end of his tenure as pres
ident, Kennedy said, Stanford stu
dents had emerged "more confi
dent" in discussing race and treat
ed each other with more "respect"
in the multicultural dorm envi
ronment.
• The "public service move
ment" that led to the establish
ment of the Haas Public Service
Center and encouraged more stu
dents to work in public service.
"The epiphany for me," Kennedy
said, "was that so many students
are now anxious to make a differ
ence and get involved."
• The controversial 1988
switch of the freshman core cur
riculum from Western Culture to
Cultures, Ideas and Values, which
includes more non-Western au
thors. Although conservatives at
tacked the move as a rejection of
Western culture, Kennedy said
Stanford merely bore the brunt of
criticism because it was among the
first colleges to advocate the
changes.
Two years later, he said, a num
ber of other colleges had followed
Stanford in making curricular re
visions, but did so with relatively
little negative publicity. "We lost
the battle, but we won the war,"
Kennedy said. "That was enor
mously gratifying."
During his talk, Kennedy also
evaluated Stanford's financial
outlook after two grueling rounds
of budget cuts.
Overall, Kennedy said, the Uni
versity is "in good, stable financial
health, but we've been through a
rough patch."
He said the University's bud
get-cutting measures over the past
year, along with the Board of
Trustees' plan to finance short
term budget deficits through in
creased borrowing and a tempo
rary higher payout rate from the
endowment, would be sufficient to
compensate for the financial
shortfall.
The University, Kennedy said,
has made budget cuts "without se
rious costs to the quality of educa
tion — indeed, without any costs
that the average student will no
tice at all."
But most of Kennedy's talk was
more lighthearted as he advised
the students about how to choose a
college — and pitched the benefits
of Stanford to the group of poten
tial freshmen.
A good academic experience,
Kennedy said, "should open your
eyes to the joy of mental work — a
piece of writing, a new form of
analysis, a design for an experiment
— and make you realize that it can
be beautiful and provoke a pride
that you haven't experienced."
Kennedy was invited to speak
at Branner by former senior class
president Cory Booker, the dorm's
resident fellow during the sum
mer.
Booker said the students in the
summer school program were sur
prised that Kennedy would come
to Branner — some because they
hadn't realized a university presi
dent would speak at a dormitory,
