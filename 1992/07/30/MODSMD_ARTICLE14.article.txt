# Pauling steps down at Institute
## 
### 
Two-time Nobel laureate Linus
Pauling says he's had enough of
being an administrator and wants
to focus on what he knows best —
vitamin C and nuclear physics.
Pauling, professor emeritus of
chemistry, announced Wednesday
he would step down as chair of the
Linus Pauling Institute of Science
and Medicine, an organization he
founded 20 years ago.
"I seem to have more scientific
interests than ever before. I have

so many ideas,
you know, I'm
sort of an ideas
man," he said in a
telephone inter
view from his
home in Big Sur.
Pauling, who
has published
more than 1,000
papers and books

since 1923, has been a staunch de
fender of the strength of vitamin C
in fighting cardiovascular disease
and cancer.
"I'm looking forward to set
tling down tomorrow to make
some calculations relating to a
paper on nuclear structure. And of
course, I'm very much interested
in the work on vitamin C and how
it relates to cancer," he said.
Pauling won the Nobel Prize
for Chemistry in 1954 for unravel
ing the mysteries of chemical
bonds in molecules. And in 1962,
he won the Nobel Peace Prize for
his effort to ban atmospheric test
ing of nuclear weapons.
In May, he told the Associated
Press he was recovering from

prostate cancer. He said he contin
ues to take huge doses of vitamin
C, 18,000 milligrams a day, or
three times the recommended
daily requirement.
Pauling will become research
director at the Palo Alto-based in
stitute while his eldest son Linus
Pauling, Jr. is scheduled to take
over as chairman.
The 91-year-old scientist said
he will continue to publish 12 to 15
papers a year. But with the admin
istrative burden lifted, he said he
"wouldn't be surprised" if he pub
lished more.
"As I've grown older, I'm slow
er in action, but I'm not sure I
have any evidence of that."
