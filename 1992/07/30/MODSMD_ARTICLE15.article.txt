# Researchers find way to grow blood
## 
### 
Stanford researchers are devel
oping a new procedure to grow
human blood systems from single
regenerating "stem" blood cells.
In a project that may prove to
be the cornerstone for combating
such diseases as AIDS, diabetes
and osteoporosis, Medical School
Cancer Biologist Irving Weissman
and a team of other scientists are
exploring the possibilities of re
placing lost or destroyed blood
with the rare stem cells, which
would then reproduce themselves.
Blood stem cells are thought to
have a special internal program
ming capable of regenerating en
tire human blood systems. Weiss
man has estimated that the occur
rence of these cells is one in every
2,000 human bone marrow cells.
They have already been shown
effective in reproducing blood sys
tems in mice. Although evidence
for probable human blood-form
ing stem cells was revealed in
April, the existence of such cells
has "not yet been proven," accord
ing to Don Gibbons, associate di
rector of communications at the
Medical School.

Final proof of the human stem
cell requires testing in humans,
when scientists will attempt to re

populate the blood system
through bone marrow transplants
of the stern cells.
Gibbons said there is no date
set for these tests, but they may
take place within a year.
The human tests will be run at
the Stanford Hospital, Gibbons said,
but they will be coordinated through
Systemix Inc., a company co-found
ed by Weissman and researcher
Michael McCune for private sector
work on the stem cell project.
The new technique, if proven
successful, will allow bone marrow
transplants to take place with only

a few cells.
The amount of marrow needed
for current blood system regenera
tion methods is about 100,000
times more than is required with
the new technology.
Stem cell use should prevent
the spread of disease that some
times occurs with donor marrow
transplants, researchers say.
In operations such as cancer
treatment, using the stem cell proce
dure would significantly reduce the
risk of reinfusing cancerous cells.
Stem cell research also promises
much more than this direct use, as it

may be used in a variety of genetic
therapy applications. According to
Gibbons, the top priority will be the
development of AIDS immunity.
Researchers at Systemix are
working to develop a gene that
may be inserted in the stem cells to
help them generate blood systems
with T-cells immune to the HIV
virus, Gibbons said.
Genetic therapy applications of
stem cell research may also in
clude treatment for diabetes and
osteoporosis.
Researchers say they expect to
find stem cells similar to those
found in the blood system that will
make possible the creation of in
sulin and perhaps even bone.
