# Act to require disabled access
## 
### 
The Americans with Disabili
ties Act, which went into effect
Monday, will force University offi
cials to construct new housing
that is completely wheelchair ac
cessible, but will not require Stan
ford to make changes to any exist
ing dormitories and buildings.
However, University housing
officials say plans are underway to
propose ways to gradually improve
access in older buildings.
The Act, passed by Congress ear
lier this year, mandates equal access
to facilities; bans employment dis
crimination of individuals with
physical and mental handicaps; and
requires equal public accommoda
tions, transportation and telecom
munication services for the disabled.
According to housing officials,
almost all existing dormitories,
Row houses and academic and ad
ministrative buildings at Stanford
now provide limited or first-floor
access to disabled persons.
The biggest barrier to modify
ing current structures, officials
say, is financial. Retrofitting
buildings is extremely expensive,
and the University's tight budget
constraints do not allow excess
funds for construction.
But the University has assem
bled a task force to research the
problem and propose improve
ments, according to Keith Guy, di
rector of housing and food services.
The new committee will focus
on improving access and changing
procedures for the Draw, seeking
to find a compromise satisfactory
to both the disabled community
