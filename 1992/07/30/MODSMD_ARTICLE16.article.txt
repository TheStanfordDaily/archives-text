# Act to require disabled access
## 
### 
The Americans with Disabili
ties Act, which went into effect
Monday, will force University offi
cials to construct new housing
that is completely wheelchair ac
cessible, but will not require Stan
ford to make changes to any exist
ing dormitories and buildings.
However, University housing
officials say plans are underway to
propose ways to gradually improve
access in older buildings.
The Act, passed by Congress ear
lier this year, mandates equal access
to facilities; bans employment dis
crimination of individuals with
physical and mental handicaps; and
requires equal public accommoda
tions, transportation and telecom
munication services for the disabled.
According to housing officials,
almost all existing dormitories,
Row houses and academic and ad
ministrative buildings at Stanford
now provide limited or first-floor
access to disabled persons.
The biggest barrier to modify
ing current structures, officials
say, is financial. Retrofitting
buildings is extremely expensive,
and the University's tight budget
constraints do not allow excess
funds for construction.
But the University has assem
bled a task force to research the
problem and propose improve
ments, according to Keith Guy, di
rector of housing and food services.
The new committee will focus
on improving access and changing
procedures for the Draw, seeking
to find a compromise satisfactory
to both the disabled community
and the University, Guy said.
Dormitories are required to
have both rooms and a lounge that
are accessible to the disabled. Cur
rently, only one-quarter of Uni
versity housing meets those speci
fications, said Housing Center Di
rector William Georges.
Many older dormitories, such as
Toyon and Branner, were designed
in a manner that does not allow ac
cess for the disabled. The newly built
Kimball Hall and the Manzanita II
project are accessible only on the first
floor. But Georges said Housing's
current plan to remodel older dormi
tories — the 10-year "Capital Im
provements Plan" — includes provi
sions for increased access.
Although the process of retro
fitting the buildings for wheel
chair access has yet to be deter
mined, Georges said that "changes
may be made systematically or on
an ad-hoc basis in response to indi
vidual requests."
Besides the actual housing, the
Draw is often unfair and insensi
tive to disabled students, accord
ing to Disability Resource Center
Director John Asheim.
Disabled students are currently
exempted from the Draw, but, un
like other students who may draw
in a group of up to eight, only the
exempted student's roommate
may also be exempted, he said.
"God forbid a disabled student
should have more than one
friend," Asheim said. "We're not
demanding eight, but four or five
would be nice."
It is likely that the task force
will examine the possibility of in
creasing the number of exemp
tions, housing administrators
said.
And in compliance with the Act,
two new undergraduate dormito
ries scheduled to be completed in
the fall of 1994 will have to be fully
wheelchair accessible, according
to administrators.
Disabled students also have ex
pressed concern about the accessi
bility of academic buildings, many
of which are even older than the
dormitories.
Asheim said History and Math
Corners are the only areas of the
Quad fully accessible to disabled
students. He said that when a dis

abled student enrolls in a class
held in an inaccessible location,
the department is required to
move the class to another site. But
this practice does not solve prob
lems in attending office hours and
social events, Asheim said.
Guy said the task force will ad
dress all aspects of building access,
including legal requirements, fi
nancial capabilities and institu
tional principles. Decisions are ex
pected in the early fall, he said.
