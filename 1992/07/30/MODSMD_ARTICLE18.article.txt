# Scientists work on space antenna
## 
### 
Using a satellite and a 12-mile
long copper cable, Stanford re
searchers plan to turn the space
shuttle Atlantis into the largest
ever orbiting antenna during its
flight tomorrow.
The scheduled experiment, in
tended to study the Earth's upper
atmosphere, will involve tethering
an Italian-built research satellite
to the cargo bay of the shuttle with
12 miles of cable.
Inside the cargo bay, a $10 mil
lion instrument designed by Stan
ford and two other universities
will measure voltage and current
in the cable.
"As the shuttle orbits at high ve
locity, the tether will function like
the alternator in your car, moving
rapidly through the Earth's mag
netic field to generate an electrical
potential," explained Peter Banks,
dean of engineering at the Univer
sity of Michigan. He is currently
doing research at Stanford's
Space, Telecommunications and
Radioscience laboratory.
The scientists say they hope to
use the experiment to learn more
about the Earth's ionosphere, a re
gion of the atmosphere filled with
charged particles, by studying the
electrodynamics of the tethered
cable.
The goal is to use the tethered
satellite experiment to help scien
tists learn how to harness electri
cal energy from the orbital motion
of a spacecraft.
"The experiment tells us a lot
about the future opportunity to
use tethers, as well as providing ar
tificial gravity and getting rid of
garbage on a space station," said

Roger Williamson, a senior re
search scientist in Stanford's de
partment of electrical engineering.
He said very short tethers were
used on Gemini missions in the
19705, but the length and scale
was not comparable to the current
experiment.
"We're breaking new ground,"
said Williamson, who has been
working on the tethered satellite
experiment for eight years.
"There's a tremendous amount of
attention in the scientific commu
nity concerning this experiment."
A team of Stanford researchers
will assist the shuttle crew in per
forming experiments from the
Johnson Space Center in Hous
ton. After the mission, the scien
tists will work with Electrical En
gineering Prof. Allen Peterson to
analyze the collected data.
