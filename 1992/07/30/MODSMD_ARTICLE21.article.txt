# Hopkins at 100
## Hopkins Marine Station allows students and professors to conduct research in the most colossal laboratory on earth — the ocean.

At the Hopkins Marine Station, early
morning diving expeditions often take
the place of a jog to the Dish.
The sign in the library warns, "Please, no
wetsuits in the library."
Calculated scientific research at Hopkins
has always been carried out against the back
drop of frolicking seals and crashing waves in
Monterey Bay.
This summer marks the 100 th anniver
sary of Hopkins and its marriage to the sea.
Since 1892, students and professors at
Hopkins — the second oldest marine labora
tory in the country — have been privy to a di
verse ecological aquarium in which to con
duct their research.
With the bay as its backyard, Hopkins has
gathered a collection of scientists as diverse
as the surrounding marine life, while also en
hancing its research facilities.
In the last 100 years, it has remained a
unique opportunity for intensive undergrad
uate research and has also become an enclave
for world-renowned biologists.
Two qualities make Hopkins particularly
attractive, visitors say — a bustling marine
research community and a bay that is safe
guarded against any ecologically damaging
actions.
Hopkins is nestled in a cluster of about
half a dozen other marine research institu
tions, including the Monterey Bay Aquarium
Research Institute and the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
Just recently, the federal government des
ignated the waterways extending from south
of San Francisco Bay to Point Sur — a region
that encompasses Monterey Bay — as a na
tional marine sanctuary. This measure
guards the waters against environmentally
destructive actions such as offshore oil
drilling.
The waters around Hopkins have also
been declared a wildlife refuge by the state of
California, with Hopkins mandated to care
for it and ensure that it is used only for recre
ational or scientific purposes. A number of
areas in the refuge are now being set aside
specifically for research.
For Biology Prof. David Epel, a morning
at the station may easily begin before
the sun comes up — at 5:30 a.m. — as
he and his cell biology class drive out to the
mud flats in nearby Moss Landing to collect
fresh worms for the day's upcoming experi
ments.
The work of other scientific scholars may
require them to venture further out to sea in
order to obtain detailed photographic footage
for their research or to collect deep-sea or
ganisms.
Monterey Bay is "just teeming with excit
ing wildlife," said Hopkins Director Dennis
Powers. While he acknowledges that many
other areas in the world also qualify for this
distinction, Powers maintains that the diver
sity of organisms found there are "very acces
sible" for research purposes.
Another distinguishing feature of the bay,
Powers added, is its classification as a "tran
sition zone" for many species.
Just north and south of this region, sever
al species of marine life stop and new species
take over, marking this particular area as a
prime point from which to observe the transi
tions made from one species to another. "Bi
ologically, it's a unique area," Powers said.
Researchers can descend to depths of
1,000 feet using a submersible — a subma
rine operated from above the water — owned
by a neighboring institute.
In the 19605, Hopkins participated in sev
eral deep sea expeditions abroad — including
a three-year exploration of the Indian Ocean
— aboard its own 130-foot schooner.
But due to the high costs of such extensive
journeys, Stanford continued distant water
research in the early 19705, turning Hopkins'
attention inward to laboratory biology.
Located in Pacific Grove, Calif., the ma
rine station is about 90 miles away from
Stanford.
"The worst thing about being here is that
we're an hour and a half away from Stan
ford," Povers said. But he quickly added,
"The best thing about being here is that we're
an hour and a half awav from Stanford."

According to Powers, the environment
around Hopkins allows students "total im
mersion in the scientific experience" — an
opportunity not available on campus.
Hopkins extends to students "an open
ended invitation to be as creative as they can
be and fully experience the excitement of dis
covery," Powers said.
Participants in the program at Hopkins
are "given the key to the lab," he said, and
"can work around the clock" if they so desire.
But while the atmosphere at Hopkins af
fords complete immersion in research, it also
allows adequate escape whenever necessary.
"I look at the lifestyle the seals are living
as opposed to mine," Powers said, "and I
wonder who has it better sometimes."
When Powers experiences "too much
stress," he said he goes for a walk out by the
water and gets a "different perspective on
life."
At Hopkins, researchers "can work in a
pleasant atmosphere and be able to still have
the most sophisticated tools of molecular and
cellular biology," Powers said.
One year after Stanford opened its doors,

Hopkins was tounded, ottering summer
classes in physiology and developmental biol
ogy. Sixteen Stanford undergraduates en
rolled in the first program.
Today, participants at Hopkins range
from all levels of graduate students to award
winning visiting scholars.
Hopkins also offers undergraduate class
es, each worth 15 units, during the spring
and summer quarters. About 24 undergradu
ates enroll each spring and up to 100 partici
pate in the summer, Powers said.
"Teaching [at Hopkins] is wonderful,"
said Biology Assoc. Prof. Mark Denny. "All
[students arel doing is taking your particular
course."
Epel, who teaches the spring course for
undergraduates, added that "the teaching we
do here is a very intensive, all-day, complete
involvement type of experience" for students.
Students "don't take calculus at 11,
French at 1, biology at 2," Epel explained.
They "don't keep shifting their focus.
They're just focusing on one area, and I find
that very exciting."
With no textbooks, no tests, no home
work, Hopkins offered Stanford
graduate Mea Ha a chance to partici
pate in "a different kind of learning — an ac
tive learning," she said.
Although a quarter at Hopkins often
means at least eight hours of lab work each
day, participants say they find the research
experience both refreshing and rewarding.
"It's more liberal and creative," Ha said. She
spent spring quarter of her junior year at Hop
kins, studying cell mitosis in sea urchin eggs.
In the undergraduate classes at Hopkins,
students carry out their own research pro
jects, in which they do not "just follow some
body's recipe," Denny said.
And they are often able to work one-on
one with a professor. "There's no such thing
as office hours," Ha said. "You just go and

find the person."
At the end of the quarter, they present the
results of their research to their classmates.
Many participants also publish their papers
in scientific journals.
Ha remembered the hours spent outside
the lab as vividly as those spent inside.
Bonfires on the beach with professors and
fellow students, she said, were especially pop
ular. "TGIF barbecues and outdoor movies
on the weekends were pretty standard," too,
she said.
Senior Christina Lee described her experi
ence at Hopkins with enthusiasm similar to
Ha's. "To do research eight hours a day was a
really great experience."
Studying the neurobehavioral develop
ment of squid, Lee would typically spend her
day feeding the squid, videotaping their ac
tivities and analyzing the taped sequences on
computer.
Lee, who enrolled in the spring last year,
ended up also staying in the summer and said
she plans to do more research at Hopkins in
the coming year.
Classes at Hopkins are open to students in

all majors. Its not only the bio types that
you think you're going to meet there," said
Lee, an anthropology major, adding that art
history and political science students can also
be found at Hopkins.
Although Hopkins mainly focuses on ma
rine biology, Powers said marine organisms
are often used as model systems for studying
other aspects of cell, molecular and organis
mic biology.
Fish and squid, he said, can be used to
study neurobiology, and sea urchins can be
used to study fertilization of eggs.
According to Denny, "There are things
you can experiment with [in the marine envi
ronment] that would take you a century to do
in a forest."
Hopkins is a branch of Stanford's Depart
ment of Biological Sciences, but obtains a
substantial amount of its research funding
from federal grants and private institutions,
Powers said.
Using funds from both private and federal
sources, Hopkins awards between 40 and 50
tuition scholarships to Stanford undergradu
ates each year, mainly during the summer,
Powers said.
However, Epel said Stanford undergradu
ates compose only one-third of his current
class.
"We have applicants from around the
country and around the world," he said, "but
not as many from Stanford as we'd like."
Professors attribute the limited student
enrollment, at least in part, to the lack of
housing facilities. Students and other visi
tors to the station must search for housing on
their own, which Powers said can sometimes
be difficult.
Powers emphasized that proper housing
facilities for students as well as visiting facul
ty are "desperately needed." But he said
there is "nothingon the horizon so far."
If student housing becomes available,
however, Powers said he envisions Hopkins

expanding to a year-round program.
Powers said the marine station would also
be an ideal location to hold other classes that
are not strictly related to science: "I can't
think of a better place to take a literature
course on John Steinbeck," he said, citing the
proximity of Steinbeck country and adding
that in 1923, Steinbeck was also a student at
Hopkins.
I lopkins is also exploring the option of set
ting up microwave links with Stanford, al
lowing students at Hopkins to take lecture
classes on campus and vice versa
On its 100 th anniversary, the station is
now well on its way to recovering from
an unstable recent past.
In the early 19705, Hopkins w«nt through
a time of transition, switching from an
oceanographic focus to a more lab-oriented
one. At the same time, the station faced a lean
operating budget and a dwindling faculty.
But after carefully reviewing the station's
uncertain condition, the University decided
to continue and rejuvenate its operations at
Hopkins.
Three years ago, a second review of Hop
kins brought in Powers, a prominent molecu
lar biologist, to lead Hopkins into new direc
tions in the marine sciences. Scientist are ex
cited about the potential advances that may
be made as molecular biology is applied to
marine organisms.
In the most recent University budget cri
sis, Hopkins faced cuts "similar to those faced
by other departments," Powers said, "which
made it more difficult to meet our teaching
obligations."
Plans to expand Hopkins have been slight
ly scaled back. Of two new faculty positions
originally promised by the University, one
will now be a chair endowed by David
Packard.
Hopkins, however, is still edging forward
and looking ahead optimistically toward its
future.
Powers said using "molecular tools to ad
dress fundamental issues of conservation bi
ology" will "be a growing area for us in the fu
ture."
Powers emphasized that there is no speci
fied research agenda for the station in the
coming years, and that at the station "every
body follows their scientific interest."
Hut he noted his own "growing interest"
in the environment, and said many of the new
faculty that Hopkins is looking to recruit
demonstrate strong interest in conservation
biology and other environmental concerns, in
addition to their interests in other areas of bi
ology.
"One of the biggest challenges for the fu
ture is to try to assess the impact of man's ac
tions on the oceans," Powers said, citing
changes in water temperature, climate and
species' metabolisms as a few of the possible
effects.
One student under Powers is studying the
impact the depleting ozone layer has on cer
tain types of marine algae, examining how
higher levels of Ultraviolet B radiation affect
the ability of marine plants to harvest light.
"Eventually we hope to go down to the
Antarctic and look at the effects there," Pow
ers said, adding that a "mf\jor ozone hole" ex
ists over this region.
Complementing the increasing concern
for environmental conservation and preser
vation, researchers at Hopkins have devel
oped "a non-evasive method [of experiment
ing with animals] so you don't have to kill the
animal," Powers said.
This method involves performing small
biopsies on animals without hurting them,
and then using molecular techniques to am
plify genes and do I)NA fingerprinting or se
quencing.
And this summer, Epel added a new focus
to his course, "Cell Biology of Early Develop
ment," for the first time in his 15 years of
teaching it. He and his class will examine how
factors in the environment, such as ultravio
let radiation, temperature, bacteria and pol
lutants, interact with the early development
of marine life.
Epel said that while the direction of his
work is not shifting, it "will be focused on two
fronts." He said he is exploring new ideas
about "how the egg is turned on at fertiliza
tion" while continuing to pursue his environ
mental interests.

ates enroll each spring and up to 100 partici
pate in the summer, Powers said.
"Teaching [at Hopkins] is wonderful,"
said Biology Assoc. Prof. Mark Denny. "All
[students arel doing is taking your particular
course."
Epel, who teaches the spring course for
undergraduates, added that "the teaching we
do here is a very intensive, all-day, complete
involvement type of experience" for students.
Students "don't take calculus at 11,
French at 1, biology at 2," Epel explained.
They "don't keep shifting their focus.
They're just focusing on one area, and I find
that very exciting."
With no textbooks, no tests, no home
work, Hopkins offered Stanford
graduate Mea Ha a chance to partici
pate in "a different kind of learning — an ac
tive learning," she said.
Although a quarter at Hopkins often
means at least eight hours of lab work each
day, participants say they find the research
experience both refreshing and rewarding.
"It's more liberal and creative," Ha said. She
spent spring quarter of her junior year at Hop
kins, studying cell mitosis in sea urchin eggs.
In the undergraduate classes at Hopkins,
students carry out their own research pro
jects, in which they do not "just follow some
body's recipe," Denny said.
And they are often able to work one-on
one with a professor. "There's no such thing
as office hours," Ha said. "You just go and

find the person."
At the end of the quarter, they present the
results of their research to their classmates.
Many participants also publish their papers
in scientific journals.
Ha remembered the hours spent outside
the lab as vividly as those spent inside.
Bonfires on the beach with professors and
fellow students, she said, were especially pop
ular. "TGIF barbecues and outdoor movies
on the weekends were pretty standard," too,
she said.
Senior Christina Lee described her experi
ence at Hopkins with enthusiasm similar to
Ha's. "To do research eight hours a day was a
really great experience."
Studying the neurobehavioral develop
ment of squid, Lee would typically spend her
day feeding the squid, videotaping their ac
tivities and analyzing the taped sequences on
computer.
Lee, who enrolled in the spring last year,
ended up also staying in the summer and said
she plans to do more research at Hopkins in
the coming year.
Classes at Hopkins are open to students in

all majors. Its not only the bio types that
you think you're going to meet there," said
Lee, an anthropology major, adding that art
history and political science students can also
be found at Hopkins.
Although Hopkins mainly focuses on ma
rine biology, Powers said marine organisms
are often used as model systems for studying
other aspects of cell, molecular and organis
mic biology.
Fish and squid, he said, can be used to
study neurobiology, and sea urchins can be
used to study fertilization of eggs.
According to Denny, "There are things
you can experiment with [in the marine envi
ronment] that would take you a century to do
in a forest."
Hopkins is a branch of Stanford's Depart
ment of Biological Sciences, but obtains a
substantial amount of its research funding
from federal grants and private institutions,
Powers said.
Using funds from both private and federal
sources, Hopkins awards between 40 and 50
tuition scholarships to Stanford undergradu
ates each year, mainly during the summer,
Powers said.
However, Epel said Stanford undergradu
ates compose only one-third of his current
class.
"We have applicants from around the
country and around the world," he said, "but
not as many from Stanford as we'd like."
Professors attribute the limited student
enrollment, at least in part, to the lack of
housing facilities. Students and other visi
tors to the station must search for housing on
their own, which Powers said can sometimes
be difficult.
Powers emphasized that proper housing
facilities for students as well as visiting facul
ty are "desperately needed." But he said
there is "nothingon the horizon so far."
If student housing becomes available,
however, Powers said he envisions Hopkins

expanding to a year-round program.
Powers said the marine station would also
be an ideal location to hold other classes that
are not strictly related to science: "I can't
think of a better place to take a literature
course on John Steinbeck," he said, citing the
proximity of Steinbeck country and adding
that in 1923, Steinbeck was also a student at
Hopkins.
I lopkins is also exploring the option of set
ting up microwave links with Stanford, al
lowing students at Hopkins to take lecture
classes on campus and vice versa
On its 100 th anniversary, the station is
now well on its way to recovering from
an unstable recent past.
In the early 19705, Hopkins w«nt through
a time of transition, switching from an
oceanographic focus to a more lab-oriented
one. At the same time, the station faced a lean
operating budget and a dwindling faculty.
But after carefully reviewing the station's
uncertain condition, the University decided
to continue and rejuvenate its operations at
Hopkins.
Three years ago, a second review of Hop
kins brought in Powers, a prominent molecu
lar biologist, to lead Hopkins into new direc
tions in the marine sciences. Scientist are ex
cited about the potential advances that may
be made as molecular biology is applied to
marine organisms.
In the most recent University budget cri
sis, Hopkins faced cuts "similar to those faced
by other departments," Powers said, "which
made it more difficult to meet our teaching
obligations."
Plans to expand Hopkins have been slight
ly scaled back. Of two new faculty positions
originally promised by the University, one
will now be a chair endowed by David
Packard.
Hopkins, however, is still edging forward
and looking ahead optimistically toward its
future.
Powers said using "molecular tools to ad
dress fundamental issues of conservation bi
ology" will "be a growing area for us in the fu
ture."
Powers emphasized that there is no speci
fied research agenda for the station in the
coming years, and that at the station "every
body follows their scientific interest."
Hut he noted his own "growing interest"
in the environment, and said many of the new
faculty that Hopkins is looking to recruit
demonstrate strong interest in conservation
biology and other environmental concerns, in
addition to their interests in other areas of bi
ology.
"One of the biggest challenges for the fu
ture is to try to assess the impact of man's ac
tions on the oceans," Powers said, citing
changes in water temperature, climate and
species' metabolisms as a few of the possible
effects.
One student under Powers is studying the
impact the depleting ozone layer has on cer
tain types of marine algae, examining how
higher levels of Ultraviolet B radiation affect
the ability of marine plants to harvest light.
"Eventually we hope to go down to the
Antarctic and look at the effects there," Pow
ers said, adding that a "mf\jor ozone hole" ex
ists over this region.
Complementing the increasing concern
for environmental conservation and preser
vation, researchers at Hopkins have devel
oped "a non-evasive method [of experiment
ing with animals] so you don't have to kill the
animal," Powers said.
This method involves performing small
biopsies on animals without hurting them,
and then using molecular techniques to am
plify genes and do I)NA fingerprinting or se
quencing.
And this summer, Epel added a new focus
to his course, "Cell Biology of Early Develop
ment," for the first time in his 15 years of
teaching it. He and his class will examine how
factors in the environment, such as ultravio
let radiation, temperature, bacteria and pol
lutants, interact with the early development
of marine life.
Epel said that while the direction of his
work is not shifting, it "will be focused on two
fronts." He said he is exploring new ideas
about "how the egg is turned on at fertiliza
tion" while continuing to pursue his environ
mental interests.


Brian Bedell — Weekly
A seal converses with a bird on a rock not far off the Hopkins Marine Station shore.
At the Hopkins Marine Station, early
morning diving expeditions often take
the place of a jog to the Dish.
The sign in the library warns, "Please, no
wetsuits in the library."
Calculated scientific research at Hopkins
has always been carried out against the back
drop of frolicking seals and crashing waves in
Monterey Bay.
This summer marks the 100 th anniver
sary of Hopkins and its marriage to the sea.
Since 1892, students and professors at
Hopkins — the second oldest marine labora
tory in the country — have been privy to a di
verse ecological aquarium in which to con
duct their research.
With the bay as its backyard, Hopkins has
gathered a collection of scientists as diverse
as the surrounding marine life, while also en
hancing its research facilities.
In the last 100 years, it has remained a
unique opportunity for intensive undergrad
uate research and has also become an enclave
for world-renowned biologists.
Two qualities make Hopkins particularly
attractive, visitors say — a bustling marine
research community and a bay that is safe
guarded against any ecologically damaging
actions.
Hopkins is nestled in a cluster of about
half a dozen other marine research institu
tions, including the Monterey Bay Aquarium
Research Institute and the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
Just recently, the federal government des
ignated the waterways extending from south
of San Francisco Bay to Point Sur — a region
that encompasses Monterey Bay — as a na
tional marine sanctuary. This measure
guards the waters against environmentally
destructive actions such as offshore oil
drilling.
The waters around Hopkins have also
been declared a wildlife refuge by the state of
California, with Hopkins mandated to care
for it and ensure that it is used only for recre
ational or scientific purposes. A number of
areas in the refuge are now being set aside
specifically for research.
For Biology Prof. David Epel, a morning
at the station may easily begin before
the sun comes up — at 5:30 a.m. — as
he and his cell biology class drive out to the
mud flats in nearby Moss Landing to collect
fresh worms for the day's upcoming experi
ments.
The work of other scientific scholars may
require them to venture further out to sea in
order to obtain detailed photographic footage
for their research or to collect deep-sea or
ganisms.
Monterey Bay is "just teeming with excit
ing wildlife," said Hopkins Director Dennis
Powers. While he acknowledges that many
other areas in the world also qualify for this
distinction, Powers maintains that the diver
sity of organisms found there are "very acces
sible" for research purposes.
Another distinguishing feature of the bay,
Powers added, is its classification as a "tran
sition zone" for many species.
Just north and south of this region, sever
al species of marine life stop and new species
take over, marking this particular area as a
prime point from which to observe the transi
tions made from one species to another. "Bi
ologically, it's a unique area," Powers said.
Researchers can descend to depths of
1,000 feet using a submersible — a subma
rine operated from above the water — owned
by a neighboring institute.
In the 19605, Hopkins participated in sev
eral deep sea expeditions abroad — including
a three-year exploration of the Indian Ocean
— aboard its own 130-foot schooner.
But due to the high costs of such extensive
journeys, Stanford continued distant water
research in the early 19705, turning Hopkins'
attention inward to laboratory biology.
Located in Pacific Grove, Calif., the ma
rine station is about 90 miles away from
Stanford.
"The worst thing about being here is that
we're an hour and a half away from Stan
ford," Povers said. But he quickly added,
"The best thing about being here is that we're
an hour and a half awav from Stanford."

According to Powers, the environment
around Hopkins allows students "total im
mersion in the scientific experience" — an
opportunity not available on campus.
Hopkins extends to students "an open
ended invitation to be as creative as they can
be and fully experience the excitement of dis
covery," Powers said.
Participants in the program at Hopkins
are "given the key to the lab," he said, and
"can work around the clock" if they so desire.
But while the atmosphere at Hopkins af
fords complete immersion in research, it also
allows adequate escape whenever necessary.
"I look at the lifestyle the seals are living
as opposed to mine," Powers said, "and I
wonder who has it better sometimes."
When Powers experiences "too much
stress," he said he goes for a walk out by the
water and gets a "different perspective on
life."
At Hopkins, researchers "can work in a
pleasant atmosphere and be able to still have
the most sophisticated tools of molecular and
cellular biology," Powers said.
One year after Stanford opened its doors,

Hopkins was tounded, ottering summer
classes in physiology and developmental biol
ogy. Sixteen Stanford undergraduates en
rolled in the first program.
Today, participants at Hopkins range
from all levels of graduate students to award
winning visiting scholars.
Hopkins also offers undergraduate class
es, each worth 15 units, during the spring
and summer quarters. About 24 undergradu
ates enroll each spring and up to 100 partici
pate in the summer, Powers said.
"Teaching [at Hopkins] is wonderful,"

lar biologist, to lead Hopkins into new direc
tions in the marine sciences. Scientist are ex
cited about the potential advances that may
be made as molecular biology is applied to
marine organisms.
In the most recent University budget cri
sis, Hopkins faced cuts "similar to those faced
by other departments," Powers said, "which
made it more difficult to meet our teaching
obligations."
Plans to expand Hopkins have been slight
ly scaled back. Of two new faculty positions
originally promised by the University, one
will now be a chair endowed by David
Packard.
Hopkins, however, is still edging forward
and looking ahead optimistically toward its
future.
Powers said using "molecular tools to ad
dress fundamental issues of conservation bi
ology" will "be a growing area for us in the fu
ture."
Powers emphasized that there is no speci
fied research agenda for the station in the
coming years, and that at the station "every
body follows their scientific interest."
Hut he noted his own "growing interest"
in the environment, and said many of the new
faculty that Hopkins is looking to recruit
demonstrate strong interest in conservation
biology and other environmental concerns, in
addition to their interests in other areas of bi
ology.
"One of the biggest challenges for the fu
ture is to try to assess the impact of man's ac
tions on the oceans," Powers said, citing
changes in water temperature, climate and
species' metabolisms as a few of the possible
effects.
One student under Powers is studying the
impact the depleting ozone layer has on cer
tain types of marine algae, examining how
higher levels of Ultraviolet B radiation affect
the ability of marine plants to harvest light.
"Eventually we hope to go down to the
Antarctic and look at the effects there," Pow
ers said, adding that a "mf\jor ozone hole" ex
ists over this region.
Complementing the increasing concern
for environmental conservation and preser
vation, researchers at Hopkins have devel
oped "a non-evasive method [of experiment
ing with animals] so you don't have to kill the
animal," Powers said.
This method involves performing small
biopsies on animals without hurting them,
and then using molecular techniques to am
plify genes and do I)NA fingerprinting or se
quencing.
And this summer, Epel added a new focus
to his course, "Cell Biology of Early Develop
ment," for the first time in his 15 years of
teaching it. He and his class will examine how
factors in the environment, such as ultravio
let radiation, temperature, bacteria and pol
lutants, interact with the early development
of marine life.
Epel said that while the direction of his
work is not shifting, it "will be focused on two
fronts." He said he is exploring new ideas
about "how the egg is turned on at fertiliza
tion" while continuing to pursue his environ
mental interests.


Brian Bedell — Weekly
A seal converses with a bird on a rock not far off the Hopkins Marine Station shore.
At the Hopkins Marine Station, early
morning diving expeditions often take
the place of a jog to the Dish.
The sign in the library warns, "Please, no
wetsuits in the library."
Calculated scientific research at Hopkins
has always been carried out against the back
drop of frolicking seals and crashing waves in
Monterey Bay.
This summer marks the 100 th anniver
sary of Hopkins and its marriage to the sea.
Since 1892, students and professors at
Hopkins — the second oldest marine labora
tory in the country — have been privy to a di
verse ecological aquarium in which to con
duct their research.
With the bay as its backyard, Hopkins has
gathered a collection of scientists as diverse
as the surrounding marine life, while also en
hancing its research facilities.
In the last 100 years, it has remained a
unique opportunity for intensive undergrad
uate research and has also become an enclave
for world-renowned biologists.
Two qualities make Hopkins particularly
attractive, visitors say — a bustling marine
research community and a bay that is safe
guarded against any ecologically damaging
actions.
Hopkins is nestled in a cluster of about
half a dozen other marine research institu
tions, including the Monterey Bay Aquarium
Research Institute and the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
Just recently, the federal government des
ignated the waterways extending from south
of San Francisco Bay to Point Sur — a region
that encompasses Monterey Bay — as a na
tional marine sanctuary. This measure
guards the waters against environmentally
destructive actions such as offshore oil
drilling.
The waters around Hopkins have also
been declared a wildlife refuge by the state of
California, with Hopkins mandated to care
for it and ensure that it is used only for recre
ational or scientific purposes. A number of
areas in the refuge are now being set aside
specifically for research.
For Biology Prof. David Epel, a morning
at the station may easily begin before
the sun comes up — at 5:30 a.m. — as
he and his cell biology class drive out to the
mud flats in nearby Moss Landing to collect
fresh worms for the day's upcoming experi
ments.
The work of other scientific scholars may
require them to venture further out to sea in
order to obtain detailed photographic footage
for their research or to collect deep-sea or
ganisms.
Monterey Bay is "just teeming with excit
ing wildlife," said Hopkins Director Dennis
Powers. While he acknowledges that many
other areas in the world also qualify for this
distinction, Powers maintains that the diver
sity of organisms found there are "very acces
sible" for research purposes.
Another distinguishing feature of the bay,
Powers added, is its classification as a "tran
sition zone" for many species.
Just north and south of this region, sever
al species of marine life stop and new species
take over, marking this particular area as a
prime point from which to observe the transi
tions made from one species to another. "Bi
ologically, it's a unique area," Powers said.
Researchers can descend to depths of
1,000 feet using a submersible — a subma
rine operated from above the water — owned
by a neighboring institute.
In the 19605, Hopkins participated in sev
eral deep sea expeditions abroad — including
a three-year exploration of the Indian Ocean
— aboard its own 130-foot schooner.
But due to the high costs of such extensive
journeys, Stanford continued distant water
research in the early 19705, turning Hopkins'
attention inward to laboratory biology.
Located in Pacific Grove, Calif., the ma
rine station is about 90 miles away from
Stanford.
"The worst thing about being here is that
we're an hour and a half away from Stan
ford," Povers said. But he quickly added,
"The best thing about being here is that we're
an hour and a half awav from Stanford."

According to Powers, the environment
around Hopkins allows students "total im
mersion in the scientific experience" — an
opportunity not available on campus.
Hopkins extends to students "an open
ended invitation to be as creative as they can
be and fully experience the excitement of dis
covery," Powers said.
Participants in the program at Hopkins
are "given the key to the lab," he said, and
"can work around the clock" if they so desire.
But while the atmosphere at Hopkins af
fords complete immersion in research, it also
allows adequate escape whenever necessary.
"I look at the lifestyle the seals are living
as opposed to mine," Powers said, "and I
wonder who has it better sometimes."
When Powers experiences "too much
stress," he said he goes for a walk out by the
water and gets a "different perspective on
life."
At Hopkins, researchers "can work in a
pleasant atmosphere and be able to still have
the most sophisticated tools of molecular and
cellular biology," Powers said.
One year after Stanford opened its doors,

Hopkins was tounded, ottering summer
classes in physiology and developmental biol
ogy. Sixteen Stanford undergraduates en
rolled in the first program.
Today, participants at Hopkins range
from all levels of graduate students to award
winning visiting scholars.
Hopkins also offers undergraduate class
es, each worth 15 units, during the spring
and summer quarters. About 24 undergradu
ates enroll each spring and up to 100 partici
pate in the summer, Powers said.
"Teaching [at Hopkins] is wonderful,"
said Biology Assoc. Prof. Mark Denny. "All
[students arel doing is taking your particular
course."
Epel, who teaches the spring course for
undergraduates, added that "the teaching we
do here is a very intensive, all-day, complete
involvement type of experience" for students.
Students "don't take calculus at 11,
French at 1, biology at 2," Epel explained.
They "don't keep shifting their focus.
They're just focusing on one area, and I find
that very exciting."
With no textbooks, no tests, no home
work, Hopkins offered Stanford
graduate Mea Ha a chance to partici
pate in "a different kind of learning — an ac
tive learning," she said.
Although a quarter at Hopkins often
means at least eight hours of lab work each
day, participants say they find the research
experience both refreshing and rewarding.
"It's more liberal and creative," Ha said. She
spent spring quarter of her junior year at Hop
kins, studying cell mitosis in sea urchin eggs.
In the undergraduate classes at Hopkins,
students carry out their own research pro
jects, in which they do not "just follow some
body's recipe," Denny said.
And they are often able to work one-on
one with a professor. "There's no such thing
as office hours," Ha said. "You just go and

find the person."
At the end of the quarter, they present the
results of their research to their classmates.
Many participants also publish their papers
in scientific journals.
Ha remembered the hours spent outside
the lab as vividly as those spent inside.
Bonfires on the beach with professors and
fellow students, she said, were especially pop
ular. "TGIF barbecues and outdoor movies
on the weekends were pretty standard," too,
she said.
Senior Christina Lee described her experi
ence at Hopkins with enthusiasm similar to
Ha's. "To do research eight hours a day was a
really great experience."
Studying the neurobehavioral develop
ment of squid, Lee would typically spend her
day feeding the squid, videotaping their ac
tivities and analyzing the taped sequences on
computer.
Lee, who enrolled in the spring last year,
ended up also staying in the summer and said
she plans to do more research at Hopkins in
the coming year.
Classes at Hopkins are open to students in

all majors. Its not only the bio types that
you think you're going to meet there," said
Lee, an anthropology major, adding that art
history and political science students can also
be found at Hopkins.
Although Hopkins mainly focuses on ma
rine biology, Powers said marine organisms
are often used as model systems for studying
other aspects of cell, molecular and organis
mic biology.
Fish and squid, he said, can be used to
study neurobiology, and sea urchins can be
used to study fertilization of eggs.
According to Denny, "There are things
you can experiment with [in the marine envi
ronment] that would take you a century to do
in a forest."
Hopkins is a branch of Stanford's Depart
ment of Biological Sciences, but obtains a
substantial amount of its research funding
from federal grants and private institutions,
Powers said.
Using funds from both private and federal
sources, Hopkins awards between 40 and 50
tuition scholarships to Stanford undergradu
ates each year, mainly during the summer,
Powers said.
However, Epel said Stanford undergradu
ates compose only one-third of his current
class.
"We have applicants from around the
country and around the world," he said, "but
not as many from Stanford as we'd like."
Professors attribute the limited student
enrollment, at least in part, to the lack of
housing facilities. Students and other visi
tors to the station must search for housing on
their own, which Powers said can sometimes
be difficult.
Powers emphasized that proper housing
facilities for students as well as visiting facul
ty are "desperately needed." But he said
there is "nothingon the horizon so far."
If student housing becomes available,
however, Powers said he envisions Hopkins

expanding to a year-round program.
Powers said the marine station would also
be an ideal location to hold other classes that
are not strictly related to science: "I can't
think of a better place to take a literature
course on John Steinbeck," he said, citing the
proximity of Steinbeck country and adding
that in 1923, Steinbeck was also a student at
Hopkins.
I lopkins is also exploring the option of set
ting up microwave links with Stanford, al
lowing students at Hopkins to take lecture
classes on campus and vice versa
On its 100 th anniversary, the station is
now well on its way to recovering from
an unstable recent past.
In the early 19705, Hopkins w«nt through
a time of transition, switching from an
oceanographic focus to a more lab-oriented
one. At the same time, the station faced a lean
operating budget and a dwindling faculty.
But after carefully reviewing the station's
uncertain condition, the University decided
to continue and rejuvenate its operations at
Hopkins.
Three years ago, a second review of Hop
kins brought in Powers, a prominent molecu
lar biologist, to lead Hopkins into new direc

originally promised by the University, one
will now be a chair endowed by David

and looking ahead optimistically toward its
future.

dress fundamental issues of conservation bi
ology" will "be a growing area for us in the fu
ture."
Powers emphasized that there is no speci
fied research agenda for the station in the
coming years, and that at the station "every

in the environment, and said many of the new
