## Card swimmers stroke to medal success 
### Matthew Milliken Staff writer With AP wire reports 
The Cardinal contingent, which
was involved in several swimming
upsets, has made quite a splash at
Barcelona. Long shot Pablo
Morales pulled out a surprising
win, Jenny Thompson started off
slow but posted a world-record per
formance, and Summer Sanders is
still searching for success.
Among the more than 10,500
competitors who have converged
upon Barcelona, only 35 players and
coaches have Stanford connections.
Nevertheless, victories have come
quickly. Today's competition —
which features Summer Sanders,
Jenny Thompson, Janet Evans and
JefT Rouse in swimming — should
increase the medal count.
Sanders, who swims in today's
200-meter individual medley, will
be looking to make up for two sub
par races. On Sunday, Sanders had
to settle for a bronze in the 400 in
dividual medley, the event consid

ered her weakest. Yesterday she
placed sixth in the 100 butterfly,
her other weak event. The 200 IM
and Friday's 200 butterfly are
Sanders' strongest races, and she is
favored to win gold in both.
The men's swim captain, Pablo
Morales, set an inspiring example
by taking the gold in Monday's 100-
meter butterfly. It was what one
commentator called "the greatest
comeback in Olympic history" —
Morales won a silver in the 100 but
terfly in 1984, but quit the sport
after failing to qualify for the 1988
games.
Me left his Santa Clara home to
enroll at Cornell Law School, but
couldn't resist the lure of Olympic
competition. Morales returned to
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney and
managed to qualify for the team de
spite only six months of training.
At 27, he is the oldest American
male swimmer.
Many of Morales' teammates
have experienced only mixed suc
cess.
Freshman Jenny Thompson

endured dual disappointments in
the first two days of competition.
She set an Olympic record in the
100 freestyle qualifying heats on
Sunday. But .despite holding the
world record for that event,
Thompson earned only a silver
when China's Zhuang Yong beat
her with a time of 54.64 seconds.
"I guess that shows that a world
record doesn't always translate
into Olympic gold," she said.
The next day Thompson failed to
reach the finals of the 200 freestyle.
She blamed her poor performance
on the previous day's setback. De
moralized, the swimmer later had
herself tattooed — with a rub-on
picture of a heart pierced by a sword.
But things turned around on
Tuesday when Thompson helped
propel the American 400 freestyle
relay team to a record finish.
Thompson overtook Le Jingyi of
China by swimming the final leg of
the race in a world-best 54.01 sec
onds. The Stanford swimmer corn-

To date, the Olympics have been bittersweet for Stanford athletes.
Pablo Morales (above) won a gold in the 100-meter butterfly, achiev
ing a goal he has been striving after for more than a decade. Summer
Sanders (left), however, has yet to stand at the top of the medal plat
form and hear the Star Spangled Banner play. She has won a bronze,
and she goes for gold today in the 200 individual medley.
