## Card swimmers stroke to medal success 
### Matthew Milliken Staff writer With AP wire reports 
The Cardinal contingent, which
was involved in several swimming
upsets, has made quite a splash at
Barcelona. Long shot Pablo
Morales pulled out a surprising
win, Jenny Thompson started off
slow but posted a world-record per
formance, and Summer Sanders is
still searching for success.
Among the more than 10,500
competitors who have converged
upon Barcelona, only 35 players and
coaches have Stanford connections.
Nevertheless, victories have come
quickly. Today's competition —
which features Summer Sanders,
Jenny Thompson, Janet Evans and
JefT Rouse in swimming — should
increase the medal count.
Sanders, who swims in today's
200-meter individual medley, will
be looking to make up for two sub
par races. On Sunday, Sanders had
to settle for a bronze in the 400 in
dividual medley, the event consid

ered her weakest. Yesterday she
placed sixth in the 100 butterfly,
her other weak event. The 200 IM
and Friday's 200 butterfly are
Sanders' strongest races, and she is
favored to win gold in both.
The men's swim captain, Pablo
Morales, set an inspiring example
by taking the gold in Monday's 100-
meter butterfly. It was what one
commentator called "the greatest
comeback in Olympic history" —
Morales won a silver in the 100 but
terfly in 1984, but quit the sport
after failing to qualify for the 1988
games.
Me left his Santa Clara home to
enroll at Cornell Law School, but
couldn't resist the lure of Olympic
competition. Morales returned to
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney and
managed to qualify for the team de
spite only six months of training.
At 27, he is the oldest American
male swimmer.
Many of Morales' teammates
have experienced only mixed suc
cess.
Freshman Jenny Thompson

endured dual disappointments in
the first two days of competition.
She set an Olympic record in the
100 freestyle qualifying heats on
Sunday. But .despite holding the
world record for that event,
Thompson earned only a silver
when China's Zhuang Yong beat
her with a time of 54.64 seconds.
"I guess that shows that a world
record doesn't always translate
into Olympic gold," she said.
The next day Thompson failed to
reach the finals of the 200 freestyle.
She blamed her poor performance
on the previous day's setback. De
moralized, the swimmer later had
herself tattooed — with a rub-on
picture of a heart pierced by a sword.
But things turned around on
Tuesday when Thompson helped
propel the American 400 freestyle
relay team to a record finish.
Thompson overtook Le Jingyi of
China by swimming the final leg of
the race in a world-best 54.01 sec
onds. The Stanford swimmer corn-

To date, the Olympics have been bittersweet for Stanford athletes.

petes today in the 4 x 100 medley relay. She
swims Friday in the 50-meter freestyle, in
which she owns 1992's fastest time.
Despite struggling a bit, incoming fresh
man Joe Hudepohl collected two medals in
men's relay action. He led off a bronze
medal effort in Monday's 800 freestyle
relay, which the U.S. had won in all previous
Olympic races. Yesterday he was in fourth
place after swimming the opening leg of the
400 freestyle relay. It took the efforts of ex-
California star Matt Biondi to put the U.S.
on the gold medal platform.

Ex-Stanford star Janet Evans suffered
disappointment in her Barcelona debut
when Germany's Dagmar Hase beat her
out for the 400 freestyle gold. "I died a little
at the end," said Evans, who has spent four
years struggling with a maturing body and
collegiate complications. She hadn't lost
the 400 freestyle in six years, but was beat
en by a time that was more than three sec
onds slower than Evans' 1988 world record
of 4:03.85. Evans hopes for redemption in
today's 800 freestyle.
Junior Lea Loveless' Olympics have al
ready been a success. She outperformed ex
pectations when she won the bronze in
Tuesday's 100-meter backstroke.
Volleyballs, fly balls and cue balls

The members of the United States
men's volleyball team staged a silent — and
hairless — protest by shaving their heads
before Tuesday's match against Canada.
On Monday, the International Volleyball
Federation transformed victory into defeat
when it overruled a referee's call and
awarded Sunday's match to the Japanese.
"I feel like someone has come into my
home, stolen my property and violated me,"
said team captain Scott Fortune. At match
point American Bob Samuelson received
his second yellow card for protesting a call.
Officials should have ejected him and
awarded a match-winning technical point
to Japan. However, the contest was allowed
to proceed and the U.S. played to a five
game victory.
The American baseball team lost a big
game yesterday. Their five-run first inning
wasn't enough to withstand the offensive
onslaught of gold-medal favorite Cuba.
Stanford's Rick Helling, kept on the team
due to his luck against the Cubans, surren
dered a grand slam to Antonio Pacheco in
the third inning of yesterday's game. Re
liever Daron Kirkreit lost the lead for good
in the fourth.
Team USA, however, had no problem
winning its first three games and staying in
the medal hunt. Center fielder Jeffrey
Hammonds had his best game Tuesday,
when he earned two RBI in a 10-run
shutout of Italy. The team bested Spain and
Puerto Rico in its other wins.
The Games of the 25th Olympiad are
less than a week old. For some, like Morales
and Loveless, the quest is over. For
Sanders, Thompson and Evans, among
others, there's still work to be done.
