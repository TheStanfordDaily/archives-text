## Triple Cast and pay-per-view: how dangerous? 
### 
"Pay-per-view, go home!"
This is the message being given to NBC
during the Olympics. At last look, the net
work was taking a bath on its overvalued,
pay-per-view (henceforth PPV) TripleCast.
The TripleCast is a $125, commercial-free
way to watch the Olympics that was devised

by Cablevision and NBC.
Subscribers get three sepa
rate channels which offer a
wide variety of live competi
tion, from basketball to gym
nastics to canoeing. Normal
Olympic telecasts are com
mercial-laden and almost in
variably taped, due to the
time differential between
here and Barcelona.
I hate this plan, not
specifically because of what
such gross commercialism
does to the Olympics, but
l>ecause of the effect the
Triple Cast will have on TV

executives in other sports.
You can be sure that the heads of the
other networks are watching very closely
to see how this experiment works. Should
it be a financial bonanza for NBC, PPV will
become an immediately attractive option
to financially strapped networks. We can
not allow this to happen.
Major sports have always been the do
main of free TV. While cable stations such
as ESPN have increased the number of
games and variety of sports programming,
fans without cable have not lost access to
inqjor events on free TV.
Listen, I'm not just some stick-in-the

mud who lies on his couch and lets progress
pass him by. In fact, I think I'm a very pro
gressive guy. My problem is with the rea
son why this "progress" had to happen.
Throughout the '80s and '90s, TV net
works consistently paid U>o much for the
right to broadcast sports. This lack of finan-

rial discipline on the part of
the networks has forced the
major sports leagues to
make concessions so that the
networks can recoup their
foolishly high investments.
More commercial breaks.
Longer commercial breaks.
More, longer commercial
breaks. Less actual play.

And now, pay-per
view.
It's time to

stop. Networks, stop
giving out $400 mil
lion to televise one
Olympics, and $1 billion

to show baseball for four years,
leagues, realize that you must get your
own finances in order so that you don't
have to ruin your products in order to beg
for more money from TV.
Fans, do not buy pay-per-view sports.
That will only encourage the networks.
The Triple Cast as a slippery slope has
probably been avoided, but another such
slope will come. Before you know it, the
Super Bowl and World Series may be on
PPV TV. I mean, please, eventually even
the Cleveland Indians will expect us to pay
to watch them play.
Fans of the world, unite!

Sean, Sean, Sean. Just because commu
nism is dead and the biggest weapon in
Saddam Hussein's mighty arsenal is a
Super Soaker Water Pistol, you don't have
to make up enemies that are trying to de
stroy the good old U.S. of A.
The Olympics TripleCast and pay-per

view are not fiendish plots
by network executives to
alx)lish all free sports TV.
Sure, they're trying to get
back st)me money on the ob
scene fees they've paid for
rights to the Games. But the
fans have the control, Sean.
If they won't buy it, the PPV

menace can't
overwhelm us.
You've done
an excellent job
outlining the motives

of the network execu
tives. When bidding for
rights to the Olympics and
baseball, these bigwig idiots

thought that they were bidding for a B-2
Stealth Bomber instead and paid a Godzil
lion dollars.
So of course they're trying to pass some
of that expense on to consumers with the
Triple Cast. But people are already getting
plenty of free Olympic coverage, so they
just aren't buying any more. I mean, why
chase the ice cream truck when you've got
Ben & Jerry's in the freezer?
I see nothing wrong with the Triple-
Cast. If you really want to see the prelimi
naries in roller hockey and kayaking, NBC
is providing you with a valuable service, a

service for which you probably should have
to pay. These events do not have wide
spread appeal and NBC has to spend
money to produce them, so the audience
should fork over some dough.
This is not unlike when a fight is broad
cast on PPV, and a small but loyal group is

willing to subscribe. As for
the rest of us, for whom
one-hundred-plus hours of
Olympic coverage is enough
and boxing is either too
crooked or too bloody, the
Triple Cast and PPV are not
threats.
Yes, NBC is stupid, but
they're not stupid enough
to believe that Americans
will start paying for basic
Olympic coverage or for
football games on Sunday.
In this country we believe
that watching free sports is
a God-given right. In fact,
isn't it written into the Con-

stitution between the right to freedom of re
ligion and the right to sing in the shower?
Sean, you're making a big deal about
nothing. Triple Cast is a nice service for
some dedicated Olympic junkies. Unfortu
nately this service will not exist again for a
while because the networks will be afraid of
losing a ton of money. As for PPV in gener
al, the motives of network executives are
unimportant. Of course they'd like to
squeeze the public at large for every dollar
we're worth, but we won't let them. Amer
icans are too smart, too stubborn, and too
used to seeing sports for free.

view are not fiendish plots
by network executives to
alx)lish all free sports TV.
Sure, they're trying to get
back st)me money on the ob
scene fees they've paid for
rights to the Games. But the
fans have the control, Sean.
If they won't buy it, the PPV

menace can't
overwhelm us.
You've done
an excellent job
outlining the motives

of the network execu
tives. When bidding for
rights to the Olympics and
baseball, these bigwig idiots

thought that they were bidding for a B-2
Stealth Bomber instead and paid a Godzil
lion dollars.
So of course they're trying to pass some
of that expense on to consumers with the
Triple Cast. But people are already getting
plenty of free Olympic coverage, so they
just aren't buying any more. I mean, why
chase the ice cream truck when you've got
Ben & Jerry's in the freezer?
I see nothing wrong with the Triple-
Cast. If you really want to see the prelimi
naries in roller hockey and kayaking, NBC
is providing you with a valuable service, a

service for which you probably should have
to pay. These events do not have wide
spread appeal and NBC has to spend
money to produce them, so the audience
should fork over some dough.
This is not unlike when a fight is broad
cast on PPV, and a small but loyal group is

willing to subscribe. As for
the rest of us, for whom
one-hundred-plus hours of
Olympic coverage is enough
and boxing is either too
crooked or too bloody, the
Triple Cast and PPV are not
threats.
Yes, NBC is stupid, but
they're not stupid enough
to believe that Americans
will start paying for basic
Olympic coverage or for
football games on Sunday.
In this country we believe
that watching free sports is
a God-given right. In fact,
isn't it written into the Con-

stitution between the right to freedom of re
ligion and the right to sing in the shower?
Sean, you're making a big deal about
nothing. Triple Cast is a nice service for
some dedicated Olympic junkies. Unfortu
nately this service will not exist again for a
while because the networks will be afraid of
losing a ton of money. As for PPV in gener
al, the motives of network executives are
unimportant. Of course they'd like to
squeeze the public at large for every dollar
we're worth, but we won't let them. Amer
icans are too smart, too stubborn, and too
used to seeing sports for free.

"Pay-per-view, go home!"
This is the message being given to NBC
during the Olympics. At last look, the net
work was taking a bath on its overvalued,
pay-per-view (henceforth PPV) TripleCast.
The TripleCast is a $125, commercial-free
way to watch the Olympics that was devised

by Cablevision and NBC.
Subscribers get three sepa
rate channels which offer a
wide variety of live competi
tion, from basketball to gym
nastics to canoeing. Normal
Olympic telecasts are com
mercial-laden and almost in
variably taped, due to the
time differential between
here and Barcelona.
I hate this plan, not
specifically because of what
such gross commercialism
does to the Olympics, but
l>ecause of the effect the
Triple Cast will have on TV

executives in other sports.
You can be sure that the heads of the
other networks are watching very closely
to see how this experiment works. Should
it be a financial bonanza for NBC, PPV will
become an immediately attractive option
to financially strapped networks. We can
not allow this to happen.
Major sports have always been the do
main of free TV. While cable stations such
as ESPN have increased the number of
games and variety of sports programming,
fans without cable have not lost access to
inqjor events on free TV.
Listen, I'm not just some stick-in-the

mud who lies on his couch and lets progress
pass him by. In fact, I think I'm a very pro
gressive guy. My problem is with the rea
son why this "progress" had to happen.
Throughout the '80s and '90s, TV net
works consistently paid U>o much for the
right to broadcast sports. This lack of finan-

rial discipline on the part of
the networks has forced the
major sports leagues to
make concessions so that the
networks can recoup their
foolishly high investments.
More commercial breaks.
Longer commercial breaks.
More, longer commercial
breaks. Less actual play.

And now, pay-per
view.
It's time to

stop. Networks, stop
giving out $400 mil
lion to televise one
Olympics, and $1 billion

to show baseball for four years,
leagues, realize that you must get your
own finances in order so that you don't
have to ruin your products in order to beg
for more money from TV.
Fans, do not buy pay-per-view sports.
That will only encourage the networks.
The Triple Cast as a slippery slope has
probably been avoided, but another such
slope will come. Before you know it, the
Super Bowl and World Series may be on
PPV TV. I mean, please, eventually even
the Cleveland Indians will expect us to pay
to watch them play.
Fans of the world, unite!

Sean, Sean, Sean. Just because commu
nism is dead and the biggest weapon in
Saddam Hussein's mighty arsenal is a
Super Soaker Water Pistol, you don't have
to make up enemies that are trying to de
stroy the good old U.S. of A.
