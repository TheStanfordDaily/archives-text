## Not just for cows anymore Santa Clara County Fair opens tonight 
### Matthew Kanuck 
here's a sneak preview tonight and it lasts six hours.
The next trilogy in the "Star Wars" saga it is not, but it
does promise to be stellar. It's the 1992 Santa Clara County
Fair.
The 48th edition of the fair officially opens Friday, but it
will be in full swing by 5 p.m. this evening, complete with
Monster Truck Madness in the grandstand and the Cojl
Jerks Motown Dance Party in the amphitheater.
For 18 days, celebrity entertainment, exciting new attrac
tions, returning favorites, fantastic food, carnival rides ar d
games, traditional exhibits and zany contests will transform
the fairgrounds' 170 acres into a wonderland of family fun.
The 1992 fair boasts two new featured attractions com
bining education and entertainment, the U.S. High Diving

Team Stage and Stunt Show plus the fair's own World of Discovery exhibit.
Comprised of world-class diving champions, the diving team's 25-minute show features

Olympic caliber springboard diving, 45-foot platform diving,
and concludes with a death-defying high dive from a perch 90

feet above the ground. The last show each day ends
with an insanely spectacular and fiery plunge.
The World of Discovery includes four exhibits show
casing traditional and current faces of technology,
agriculture, environment, and water resources
throughout the county and world.

Coordinated by the Tech Museum of Innova- 1
tion, the technology area offers interactive ex
hibits, a history of Silicon Valley and the making of
the microprocessing chip, a hands-on computer de
sign station, a talking robot and more.
The agriculture area focuses on Santa Clara Coun
ty's rural roots. Educational shows feature livestock

available for hands-on learning. Jett's Petting Zoo con
tains many exotic creatures, including an anteater, emus,

wallabies, tropical birds, a 300-pound tortoise and
llamas, in addition to the standard farmyard ani
mals.
Children can also test their luck in the corn stalk
maze near the working farm area and greenhouse
display presenting plant agriculture.
The interactive and informational exhibits at the
environment area feature Joe Krawthwohl's
Trained Bird and Endangered Species Show pre
senting birds from throughout the world, including
a condor with a nine-foot wingspan. Activities also
center around simple things kids can do to preserve
the environment.

The water resource area demonstrates water-
conscious products and drought-tolerant gardens to
incorporate into Santa Clara County's water conservation

measures.
World-renowned master hypnotist Steve Bayner is back by
popular demand for the duration of the fair.

Jeff Allen's Magic Window Exhibit will also dazzle with an extensive collection of holo
grams and '21st century technology like holographic television and virtual reality displays.

On Saturday, the Second Annual His
panic Heritage Day will feature a "Festival of
the Mariachi and Bandas" followed by Gram-

my-winning Tex-Mex favorite
Little Joe Y La Familia.

The night will light up when
the day finishes with the

traditional Fiesta
Del Castillo, com
prised of two 50-foot
* towers of pyrotech
nics combined with
I aerial fireworks in a
20-minute spectac
ular. Besides this
artful display, fire
works will ignite the
sky every night at 10
p.m.

Other local
cultures will be
celebrated
throughout the
fair. The colorful
Aztec Indian
Dancers will per
form in the Indian

Village and the sounds of the
Caribbean will be furnished
each night by steel drum band

Harmonics.
This year's fair has the widest variety

of music to ever appear at the fairgrounds. From a
Motown dance or a night of reggae to old-fash
ioned rock 'n' roll or the blues, there is sure to be
at least one night of music for everyone.

The grandstand features some of biggest names in
rock, pop and country music Friday though Sunday

evenings. The Oakridge Boys, The
Charlie Daniels Band, Peabo
Bryson, Peter Frampton, The Storm
and Y & T all perform at no extra
charge to fairgoers.
The amphitheater will host a
myriad of performers, including two
nights with the Tower of Power
horns as well as rock 'n' roll tributes
to the Beatles, Rod Stewart and

Elton John. 1
Nostalgia will hit when Chubby
Checker takes the stage, and Diamond
Rio and Riders in the Sky will play coun
try music to shake up any hoedown.
There will be no lack of comedy at the
fair either. Comedy Sportz's new and dif
ferent brand of improvisational humor
involving audience participation will be
showcased four nichts ner woek

In addition to providing
laughs, Buzzie and R.J. the
Magic Clown will host con
tests between fairgoers.
Cracker Eat and Whistle,
Licorice Rope Off, Orange
Peel and Eat, Watermelon
k Feed, Pie Eating and Bub

ble-Gum Blowing are a few of the contests designed to be silly fun for
participants and spectators alike.
The nation's latest fad will be fattened by the Karyoke Showcase,
where more than 1,000 titles are available for patrons to sing. Finalists
selected from weekend contests will compete on the fair's last day in the
amphitheater.

Besides all the fun, some serious competitions will also be held.
Thousands of ribbons and almost $ 190,000 will be awarded to the best of
the best. From "Best Food of the Fair" to crop and livestock prizes, there
will be much excitement generated by these classic events.
Pig racing, complete with hurdles this year, consistently draws a crowd to
watch the overpresent swine hustle around a track toward the ultimate re
ward of an Oreo cookie.

The magnificent Budweiser Clydesdale Horses will parade each evening
during the opening weekend. Quarter horse and harness-racing events will also

be held daily at Fair Downs.
No fair would be complete without dizzying carnival rides and lots of junk food. The

"Swinger" and the "Falling Star" rides are among the over
40 choices sure to test any stomach stuffed full of

cotton candy, candied apples, corn dogs,
peanuts and popcorn.
In addition to braving the mechanical

rides, adventurous fairgoers can really take a
ride on the wild side. The elephant and camel
! J iL • la.

rides available this year are suit
able for all ages, while the
youngsters can also take pony

rides.
The carnival midway also
invites fairgoers to try their
hand at games of skill like
basketball shooting, flip-a
frog and dart throwing.

Successful contestants will naturally
receive oversized stuffed animals to carry in tri

umph for the rest of the day. Some will even get live
goldfish to flush down the toilet when they get home.

More than 400 vendors will be on hand to trace the
fair's roots back to the days when it was an open air mar
ket where merchants would sell their wares at bargain
prices.
At today's fair, three contained shopping venues offer
excellent places to find all kinds of unique products, ser
vices and gadgets. Individual booths with specialties like
"Olde Time Victorian Photos" and spas can be found
throughout the fairgrounds.
For those eager to check out Northern California's
largest county fair, tonight is a great opportunity since
tickets are only $4.

Regular daily adult admission is $6.50 but many dis
counts are available, including half-price Mondays, a
season pass for $25, and a special $20 family admis
sion for up to six family members. Thursday nights

tween 7th and 10th streets, from noon to 11 p.m. week

days, and 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. weekends.
