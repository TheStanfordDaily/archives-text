7 University President
Donald Kennedy laid
out his legacies for an
audience of 40 high
school students on
Tuesday. Among those
legacies was his influence
in the decision to change
the face of Western
Culture here at Stanford.
As a result, other colleges
followed Stanford's lead
and revised their curricu
lums. "We lost the battle
but we won the war,"
Kennedy said.
