"Mo * Money "
Can anything truly positive be
said about Hollywood's recent
treatment of the "Hip Hop/Home
Boy" sub-genre of black film?
Maybe, maybe not.
It really depends on your will
ingness to accept Damon Wayans'
latest release, "Mo' Money," as a
"phantastic" action comedy about
a crooked brotha' whose collision
with a sexy junior executive con
vinces him that life's straight and
narrow path is smooth like butter.
Early in the film, it is explained
that Johnny Stewart (Wayans)
and his on-screen/off-screen
brother Seymour (Marlon
Wayans) are really good guys.
They've just embraced America's
capitalistic ideas in an illegal way.
The film's story, written by
Wayans, attempts to function on
three independent, yet related,
levels. "Mo' Money" is the funny
story of two brothers in search of a
quick and painless way to get paid.
It's also an upbeat urban romance.
Finally, "Mo' Money" is a
quick-paced action film about a
harmless con artist's accidental
involvement in an inter-company
credit card scam.
As a whole, the film succeeds in
entertaining, despite its some
times tacky attempts at humor, an
overindulgence in violence and a
predictable storyline. What really
helps are the Wayans brothers,
whose on-screen chemistry is sur
prisingly entertaining.
Other characters like Johnny's
romantic interest, Amber (Stacey
Dash), or Lt. Walsch (Joe Santos),
the concerned ex-partner of the
brothers' dead father, are believ
able but are not given enough time
or space to successfully make the
jump from big city caricatures to
real people.
The only character who man
ages to avoid this unfortunate pit
fall for the majority of the film is
John Diehl's diabolical manager of
security, the man responsible for
dragging "I wanna be straight"
Johnny into the credit card scam.
Diehl is cool, good-natured and
plastic, just what you'd expect
from a man involved in a covert
scheme.
Unfortunately for him, though,
he too is caught by the story's pow
erful undertow. Late in the film,
the cool intelligence that has al
lowed him to hide his illegal activi
ties from his company conflicts
with his actions.
For example, as he tears his
company's office building apart in
search of Johnny, Seymour and
Amber, one can't help wondering
how he plans to clean up the awful
mess he made.
It's then that you realize that it
doesn't really matter, because the
story's predictability has remind
ed you that Wayans, as the unlike
ly hero, cannot lose.
The humor, though occasional
ly trite, single-handedly rescues
"Mo' Money" from often near dis
aster.
"Mo' Money" illustrates, as did
the "Beverly Hills Cop" series,
that with a decent script and the
competent acting of a box office

draw, anything is possible. Even
with its problems, Wayans' second
major release this year will have no
problem finding and entertaining
an audience.

Maturity check
"Mom and Dad Save
the World"
Warner Brothers is clearly
afraid of "Mom and Dad Save the
World," a new family film starring
Teri Garr, Jeffrey Jones and Jon
Lovitz.
Originally scheduled for release
last summer, the movie has been
given the leper's treatment by the
studio, with a delayed release and
scant publicity.
But the surprising thing about
"Mom and Dad Save the World" is
that it really isn't bad. If you're a
kid or a kid-at-heart, it's actually a
pretty funny and entertaining
film.
Lovitz stars as the evil Tod
Spengo, the emperor of a tiny plan
et he's named after himself. Just
as he prepares to incinerate Earth
with his big deathray, Spengo
spies the love of his life, suburban
housewife Marge Nelson (Garr).
After bringing Marge and her
couch-potato husband Dick (called
"Earth Dick" by the planet's in
habitants) to his domain, Lovitz
prepares for his wedding/destruc
tion of Earth, while Dick tries to
rescue his wife with the help of
rebels.
The twist that makes the movie
enjoyably silly rather than just
stupid is that Spengo is a planet of
idiots — literally.
Their most efficient anti-per
sonnel weapon is the light
grenade, which only killsyou if you
pick it up. So why would anyone
pick it up, asks Dick.
Because it's got "Pick Me Up"
written on it,"and sure enough,
one light grenade — hidden under

a blanket conspicuously labeled
"Earthman's bed: Do not touch"
— destroys an entire platoon of
foot soldiers, one at a time.
Populated with idiots, bulldog
guards and goldfish handmaidens,
the planet is a cartoonish, almost
comforting combination of Willy
Wonka's factory and twisted Dr.
Seuss.
Indeed, the film's biggest ap
peal (at least for this overgrown
kid) is its consistent juvenile men
tality. All the grown-ups on this
planet are just dumb enough to
make the ten-year-olds in the au
dience feel superior, without mak
ing it obvious.

Letterman regular Garr, as al
ways, is magnificent as the ultra
suburban, ultra-domestic Marge,
who captures their entire escapade
in pictures ("Smile, honey, I want
to get of picture of you with Sat
urn").
And Jones makes a wonderful
transition from sedentary
whipped husband to reluctant
weekend-warrior, saving his love
from the clutches of a man who
scatters statues of himself around
the planet with phrases like
"Tod=Wisdom," "Tod=Pleasure"
and so on.
Oddly, Lovitz doesn't take his
role as Spengo as far as you might

expect "Saturday Night Live's"
Master Thespian to go. Although
he's still enjoyable as the narcis
sistic leader, his scenes could have
been much bigger and even more
cartoony without detracting from
the film.
For those who can check their
maturity at the door, "Mom and
Dad Save the World" provides
plenty of giggles in a pleasantly
fantastic setting.

in pictures ("Smile, honey, I want
to get of picture of you with Sat
urn").
And Jones makes a wonderful
transition from sedentary
whipped husband to reluctant
weekend-warrior, saving his love
from the clutches of a man who
scatters statues of himself around
the planet with phrases like
"Tod=Wisdom," "Tod=Pleasure"
and so on.
Oddly, Lovitz doesn't take his
role as Spengo as far as you might

expect "Saturday Night Live's"
Master Thespian to go. Although
he's still enjoyable as the narcis
sistic leader, his scenes could have
been much bigger and even more
cartoony without detracting from
the film.
For those who can check their
maturity at the door, "Mom and
Dad Save the World" provides
plenty of giggles in a pleasantly
fantastic setting.

Hip-hop humor
"Mo * Money "
Can anything truly positive be
said about Hollywood's recent
treatment of the "Hip Hop/Home
Boy" sub-genre of black film?
Maybe, maybe not.
It really depends on your will
ingness to accept Damon Wayans'
latest release, "Mo' Money," as a
"phantastic" action comedy about
a crooked brotha' whose collision
with a sexy junior executive con
vinces him that life's straight and
narrow path is smooth like butter.
Early in the film, it is explained
that Johnny Stewart (Wayans)
and his on-screen/off-screen
brother Seymour (Marlon
Wayans) are really good guys.
They've just embraced America's
capitalistic ideas in an illegal way.
The film's story, written by
Wayans, attempts to function on
three independent, yet related,
levels. "Mo' Money" is the funny
story of two brothers in search of a
quick and painless way to get paid.
It's also an upbeat urban romance.
Finally, "Mo' Money" is a
quick-paced action film about a
harmless con artist's accidental
involvement in an inter-company
credit card scam.
As a whole, the film succeeds in
entertaining, despite its some
times tacky attempts at humor, an
overindulgence in violence and a
predictable storyline. What really
helps are the Wayans brothers,
whose on-screen chemistry is sur
prisingly entertaining.
Other characters like Johnny's
romantic interest, Amber (Stacey
Dash), or Lt. Walsch (Joe Santos),
the concerned ex-partner of the
brothers' dead father, are believ
able but are not given enough time
or space to successfully make the
jump from big city caricatures to
real people.
The only character who man
ages to avoid this unfortunate pit
fall for the majority of the film is
John Diehl's diabolical manager of
security, the man responsible for
dragging "I wanna be straight"
Johnny into the credit card scam.
Diehl is cool, good-natured and
plastic, just what you'd expect
from a man involved in a covert
scheme.
Unfortunately for him, though,
he too is caught by the story's pow
erful undertow. Late in the film,
the cool intelligence that has al
lowed him to hide his illegal activi
ties from his company conflicts
with his actions.
For example, as he tears his
company's office building apart in
search of Johnny, Seymour and
Amber, one can't help wondering
how he plans to clean up the awful
mess he made.
It's then that you realize that it
doesn't really matter, because the
story's predictability has remind
ed you that Wayans, as the unlike
ly hero, cannot lose.
The humor, though occasional
ly trite, single-handedly rescues
"Mo' Money" from often near dis
aster.
"Mo' Money" illustrates, as did
the "Beverly Hills Cop" series,
that with a decent script and the
competent acting of a box office

draw, anything is possible. Even
with its problems, Wayans' second
major release this year will have no
problem finding and entertaining
an audience.

Maturity check
"Mom and Dad Save
the World"
Warner Brothers is clearly
afraid of "Mom and Dad Save the
World," a new family film starring
Teri Garr, Jeffrey Jones and Jon
Lovitz.
Originally scheduled for release
last summer, the movie has been
given the leper's treatment by the
studio, with a delayed release and
scant publicity.
But the surprising thing about
"Mom and Dad Save the World" is
that it really isn't bad. If you're a
kid or a kid-at-heart, it's actually a
pretty funny and entertaining
film.
Lovitz stars as the evil Tod
Spengo, the emperor of a tiny plan
et he's named after himself. Just
as he prepares to incinerate Earth
with his big deathray, Spengo
spies the love of his life, suburban
housewife Marge Nelson (Garr).
After bringing Marge and her
couch-potato husband Dick (called
"Earth Dick" by the planet's in
habitants) to his domain, Lovitz
prepares for his wedding/destruc
tion of Earth, while Dick tries to
rescue his wife with the help of
rebels.
The twist that makes the movie
enjoyably silly rather than just
stupid is that Spengo is a planet of
idiots — literally.
Their most efficient anti-per
sonnel weapon is the light
grenade, which only killsyou if you
pick it up. So why would anyone
pick it up, asks Dick.
Because it's got "Pick Me Up"
written on it,"and sure enough,
one light grenade — hidden under

a blanket conspicuously labeled
"Earthman's bed: Do not touch"
— destroys an entire platoon of
foot soldiers, one at a time.
Populated with idiots, bulldog
guards and goldfish handmaidens,
the planet is a cartoonish, almost
comforting combination of Willy
Wonka's factory and twisted Dr.
Seuss.
Indeed, the film's biggest ap
peal (at least for this overgrown
kid) is its consistent juvenile men
tality. All the grown-ups on this
planet are just dumb enough to
make the ten-year-olds in the au
dience feel superior, without mak
ing it obvious.

Letterman regular Garr, as al
ways, is magnificent as the ultra
suburban, ultra-domestic Marge,
who captures their entire escapade
in pictures ("Smile, honey, I want
to get of picture of you with Sat
urn").
And Jones makes a wonderful
transition from sedentary
whipped husband to reluctant
weekend-warrior, saving his love
from the clutches of a man who
scatters statues of himself around
the planet with phrases like
"Tod=Wisdom," "Tod=Pleasure"
