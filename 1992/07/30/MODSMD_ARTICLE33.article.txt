# Colorful 'Carmina' is raucous fun
## 
### Tracy Shinn Staff writer 
Let's face it, we've all dreamed of carousing in thir
teenth-century upper Bavaria with scandalous, lasciv
ious defrocked clergymen, haven't we?
You may think you could never imagine such a col
orful fantasy, but the Stanford Summer Symphony
and Chorus' Tuesday performance of Carl OrfFs pop
ular choral work "Carmina Burana" may make you
wonder if medieval times haven't somehow always en
chanted your subconscious mind.
As the chorus and soloists sing of raucous nights at
the tavern, among other escapades, it's easy to get
caught up and be swept away, seduced by this brash
piece of western culture.
The texts of OrfFs famous piece are taken from thir
teenth-century manuscripts found in the debris of a
secularized monastery at Benedictbeuern in upper
Bavaria — hence the name "Carmina Burana (Songs
from Benedictbeuern)."
Written by monks and wandering scholars, these
texts recapture what Martin Cooper describes as "the
lost world of rebels, or simple drop-outs from the ranks
of the early medieval clergy — hard drinkers, great
lechers, perpetually on the move and celebrating their
abject poverty in impudent begging letters, gargantu
an drinking songs, hymns to a very earthy Venus and
to the ecstatic experience of spring."
Conducting "Carmina" will be Stephen Sano, a
fourth-year doctoral student in choral conducting. Ex
pressive and dynamic in his work, Sano has served as
director of numerous Stanford ensembles and is a
principal guest conductor with the Peninsula Sym
phony Orchestra.
Featured soloists will include soprano Maureen
Chowning, tenor Gregory Wait and baritone George
Shepherd. Returning to Stanford for an anchor to her
sparkling performance as the Queen of the Night in
Stanford's 1992 production of Mozart's "Magic

Flute," Chowning is sure to delight with her polished
tone and remarkable range.
Wait, conductor of the Schola Cantorum, experi
enced soloist and popular Stanford voice instructor, al
ways receives rave reviews for his performances of the
role he will play in this Tuesday's concert — the roast
ing swan, who wails as he turns on the spit.
Shepherd, a Stanford graduate student in econom
ics who has been startling both audiences and his fel
low musicians with his vocal power and precision ever
since he arrived on campus, is also not to be missed.

It's easy to get caught up and
be swept away, seduced by
this brash piece of western
culture.

Setting the stage for "Carmina" Tuesday evening
will be a performance of Howard Hanson's Symphony
No. 2 "Romantic," conducted by doctoral student
Melissa Mcßride.
The most often recorded and performed of all of
Hanson's symphonic works, this piece builds from a
brooding introduction to a dramatic allegro, which
then alternates with tender, lyrical melodies.
Of these two motifs, the feeling of sweetness and
contentment prevails, yet the two are mixed just
enough to bring the work to an exciting and satisfying
close.

The Stanford Summer Chorus and Orchestra will pre
sent Hanson's Second Symphony and Orff s "Carmi
na Burana" Tuesday, Aug. 4 in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um. Tickets are $7general, $4 students and are avail
able at 723-4317.
