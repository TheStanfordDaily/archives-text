# Spontaneity, improv rain down in Stanford Jazz Workshop
## 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
Spontaneity and improvisation continue to be the
foundations of fine jazz, as this summer's Stanford
Jazz Workshop concert series has proven with agility
and consistency.
For the past seven days, a host of local and nation
al musicians have rained down on Stanford, flooding
the campus with solid, entertaining acts.
If you missed the storm's opening, however, don't
fret. You'll have eight more evenings of continuous
jazz in which to get soaking wet.
The storm will rage in full force this evening in
Campbell Recital Hall, where audiences will enjoy the
double bill of the John McKenna/Phil Grenadier
Quartet and the Mad Duran/Jessica Williams Quar
tet, featuring Tootie Heath.
The jazz quartet — which typically features a pi
anist, percussionist, bassist and a featured musician,
who might play anything from guitar to saxophone to
piccolo — is a band formation that has endured since
the early days of blues and swing-style jazz.
The format was quickly adopted once band leaders
realized that the intensity of a small group of exquis
ite-sounding jazzmen could elicit the same wild en
thusiasm from audiences that a big band could, but at
lower costs to the band leader.
Recently the importance of stretching the jazz dol
lar may or may not be as significant, but the intima
cy of the "personal big band" has yet to lose its appeal.
The talent of quartets like those playing this
evening is obvious — no one gets up on a jazz stage to
make a fool of themselves. Instead, they take the
stage in order to share with others their melodic vi
sion of the world around them, even if they play the
same song twice in one set.
After a Friday night lull, the concert series will
continue Saturday night with the Bay Area Guitar
Summit featuring Bruce Forman, Rick Vandivier and
Randy Vincent.

Though one might assume that jazz guitarists are
among the minority musicians of today's jazz per
formers, their constant contribution to the art form
has been felt across the decades.
The Summit's Saturday performance in Campbell
Recital Hall is followed on Sunday with the Mark
Levine Quintet presenting the music of Larry Young,
and Harvey Wainapel and Friends.
Wainapel in particular is known for his fine musi
cianship as a master of the soprano, alto and tenor
saxophones. He has studied at the prestigious
Berklee College of Music in Boston, played in and led
a number of jazz bands, has toured throughout Eu
rope and is a gifted musical instructor.
Known for traveling with his "book," which fea
tures an extensive collection of rare jazz classics as
well as originals, Wainapel and Friends, along with
well-known band leader Irvine, offer a pleasant al
ternative to the "Sunday Night Movie of the Week."
On Monday, Ann Dyers will show why her distinct
alto voice and extraordinary range have been hailed
by critics and audiences alike. It would be truly sur
prising if this Monterey Jazz Festival veteran didn't
deliver.
The week continues impressively with the perfor
mances of the Mel Martin Quartet on Tuesday and
Madeline Eastman and Mark Murphy on Wednesday.
Both residents of the Bay Area, Martin and East
man have placed their mark on the Bay Area jazz
scene in their respective focuses.
As a reed player, Martin performed in and orga
nized dozens of bands. He has worked with Dizzy
Gillespie, Benny Carter, Freddy Hubbard and others.
Though still considered a new face among jazz vo
calists, Eastman's success in the Bay Area has been
fast and furious. She has received high marks for her
performances at a host of California jazz festivals, in
cluding Monterey's and San Francisco's.
