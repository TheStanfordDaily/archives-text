I admit it: I'm hooked on the Olympics.
And I don't even have the Triple Cast. I
bet the network executives are trying to
figure out how to script dramatic stories as
Rood as those being played out in the are
nas, fields and pools of Barcelona.
At least the Olympics are making up for a
lackluster movie season. Although the rev
enues have been decent — probably the third
biggest grossing year in history — the prod
uct's been a little disappointing.
It just doesn't seem like movie season any
more. I used to have this ritual of going to a
matinee every week during the summer.
Frequently I wouldn't even pick the movie
ahead of time. I'd just go and choose from
whatever movies started within the hour.
It didn't really matter because everything
was at least decent, and sometimes I'd even

make a great discovery, like Jim Henson's
last film, "The Witches."
But now I look at the movie page, and
nothing convinces me why I shouldn't wait
for video for most of the new releases.
All the big releases have been pretty big
disappointments so far, with no must-sees

shaking out of the whole bunch. Last week
end, in the height of the summer movie sea
son, only two films opened. Damon Wayans'
"Mo' Money" and "Mom and Dad Save the
World," a leftover from last summer.
Heck, even "Pinocchio" has already left
many theaters, a victim of people ftdling out

of the movie habit after one-too-many disap
pointing films recently.
But perhaps something good will come of
it. Maybe the studios will look at what's fail
ing — the traditional action picture or the
dumb comedy — and realize that the conven
tional wisdom of gearing "mass" appeal pic
tures to the mentality of 15-year-old boys just
won't sell anymore.
Look at what has worked this season:
"Sister Act," starring an intelligent female
comedian (who also happens to be black); "A
League of Their Own," yet another in a se
quence of "girl films" to surprisingly hit it big,
and sharp, classy art films like "The Player"
or "Howards End."
But it's the disappointment factor that
seems to be hitting audiences hard. Films
that seem great in previews aren't living up
to our expectations.

Maybe our expectations are too high.
Maybe $7 ticket prices and films like "Termi
nator 2" are numbing us to sitting back and
simply enjoying a solidly decent film or two.
.. .Luckily, other entertainment options
are realizing the state of the economy and
making it easier for us to splurge. Such is the
case at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, fight
ing to stay alive in the shadow of the local Dis
neyland wanna-be, Great America.
Every Monday and Tuesday night, the
Boardwalk — which has never charged an ad
mission fee — celebrates "1907 nights" by of
fering all rides and many food items, like hot
dogs and Cokes, for only 45 cents each. And
they've even pot a brand new roller coaster.

Chris Shuttlesuvrth, The Weekly's entertain
ment eiiitor, would like to remind you that hot
dogs and Cokes cost over $2 each at the men les.
