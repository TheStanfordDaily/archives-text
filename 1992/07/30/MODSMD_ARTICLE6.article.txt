After Mr. Baker's recent talks
with Mr. Rabin in
Jerusalem, the subject of
loan guarantees is once more on
the table.
So, to loan guarantee or not to
loan guarantee?
The answer to this question is
not so easy as some would have us
believe.
For the many Russian Jewish
immigrants to Israel, the journey
has been far from a bundle of
laughs. Arriving in Israel, having
had few other possible places to
which to migrate, they discovered
a country in economic disarray
and a government that had little
interest in providing them with ei
ther jobs or housing.
Despite being in general re
markably well-qualified, most
were forced into low-paying posi
tions, if they could find jobs at all.
And there was no option to
leave, the Catch-22 being that de
parture is contingent on repaying
the Israeli government the entire
cost of relocation from Russia,
which tended to price the option of
a second immigration out of the
market.
It's unsurprising, then, though
a little ironic, that the mtyority of
East European Jews these days
are choosing to immigrate to Ger
many to escape anti-Semitism.
In the context of humanitarian
aid, the decision to provide loan
guarantees seems simple.
The United States is commit
ted to supporting Israel. And, as
the Israeli government is econom
ically unable to finance the mass
emigration of Russian Jews, it fol
lows that this burden should fall
on the American government.
» But, even setting aside Israel's
poor credit rating, there are rea
sons why these loan guarantees
should not go through.
Originally, the U.S. gave Israel
a choice between $2 billion over
the next year, if all housing starts
were cancelled except those al
ready in progress, or alternatively,
the full $ 10 billion over five years if
all housing starts including those
already in progress were halted.
With this move, the American
government finally enforced what
had been official policy since 1967
— that colonial expansion into the
West Bank and Gaza is in violation
of international law.
In so doing, the Bush adminis
tration recognized that there
could be no peace while the effec
tive annexation of the territories
continued unabated.
After the Israeli elections, it
seems that the Bush administra
tion is now particularly anxious to
provide the new "moderate" gov
ernment of Mr. Rabin with the
$10 billion guarantees.
In the shortterm, such a move is
self-serving for the Bush adminis
tration: it is an election year, and
President Bush does not want to
appear too hard on Israel and there
by damage his re-election chances.
Furthermore, Mr. Rabin's gov
ernment has made the right move
in declaring a temporary halt to
settlements. Although by the
most optimistic estimates the pro
posed halt is going to only affect a
tiny minority of the total number
of housing starts, it is enough to
provide Mr. Bush with an excuse
to grant loan guarantees where
previously he has chosen not to.
If the Bush administration is
interested in seeing its efforts for
Middle East peace bear fruit, the
granting of the $10 billion must be
accompanied by an absolute halt
to the continued colonization of
the West Bank and Gaza.
There are several reasons for
this. Firstly, the Bush administra
tion, and Mr. Baker in particular,
have so far managed to maintain
their credibility as honest brokers

in the Middle East peace talks.
However, they are bound to
lose that status in the eyes of the
Arabs if they fold to pressure and
provide the loan guarantees pure
ly on the basis of symbolic rather
than substantive gestures on the
part of the Rabin government.
Furthermore, if the loan guar
antees are granted while Mr.
Rabin embarks on a program of
colonial expansion of those settle
ments that he deems necessary for
"security," the Bush administra
tion will be seen as underwriting
that expansion, further under
mining their credibility.
Probably the greatest foresee
able effect of granting the loan
guarantees without an agreement
to halt settlements absolutely, is
that the peace talks might break
down altogether.
The return of the Palestinian
delegation to the next round of
peace talks is contingent on the
abatement of settlement activity.
For the Palestinian delegation, the
subject of negotiations is the status
of the Occupied Territories, with
the objective being the creation of
an independent Palestinian state
at some time in the future.
If the Israeli government is
continuing with a policy of colo
nization of the Occupied Territo
ries, then the objectives of the
Palestinian delegation at a peace
conference have already been
ruled out by the actions of that
government in the territories.
Whether that land is being colo
nized because Mr. Rabin has
deemed it necessary for "security"
is irrelevant; to paraphrase Hanan
Ashrawi, how do you differentiate
between legal and illegal theft?
Acceptance by a Palestinian
delegation of the appropriation of
yet more Palestinian land before
negotiations have even begun
would make their attendance
pointless in that it renders their
objective unattainable.
For the Bush administration,
the loan guarantees remain the
lever with which they can exert in
fluence on the actions of the Is
raeli government, and one that
should not be given up for the re
cent symbolic gestures by Mr.
Rabin's government.
If Mr. Rabin is serious about
peace, he must be willing to call a
halt to all settlement activity. Only
then will the peace talks be placed
in a context that is meaningful to
all parties, and only then would the
granting of the loan guarantees not
be detrimental to the peace talks,
and the impartial standing of the
Bush administration.
This leaves Bush in a dilemma.
If he grants the loan guarantees
now, before more substantive
progress is made to reassure both
sides that the peace talks are being
taken seriously, he may set the
peace process back, and make the
further participation of his admin
istration in the process suspect.
And then again, if he fails to
grant the loan guarantees and ap
pease the electorate, he just might
not get re-elected at all. . ..

leave, the Catch-22 being that de
parture is contingent on repaying
the Israeli government the entire
cost of relocation from Russia,
which tended to price the option of
a second immigration out of the
market.
It's unsurprising, then, though
a little ironic, that the mtyority of
East European Jews these days
are choosing to immigrate to Ger
many to escape anti-Semitism.
In the context of humanitarian
aid, the decision to provide loan
guarantees seems simple.
The United States is commit
ted to supporting Israel. And, as
the Israeli government is econom
ically unable to finance the mass
emigration of Russian Jews, it fol
lows that this burden should fall
on the American government.
» But, even setting aside Israel's
poor credit rating, there are rea
sons why these loan guarantees
should not go through.
Originally, the U.S. gave Israel
a choice between $2 billion over
the next year, if all housing starts
were cancelled except those al
ready in progress, or alternatively,
the full $ 10 billion over five years if
all housing starts including those
already in progress were halted.
With this move, the American
government finally enforced what
had been official policy since 1967
— that colonial expansion into the
West Bank and Gaza is in violation
of international law.
In so doing, the Bush adminis
tration recognized that there
could be no peace while the effec
tive annexation of the territories
continued unabated.
After the Israeli elections, it
seems that the Bush administra
tion is now particularly anxious to
provide the new "moderate" gov
ernment of Mr. Rabin with the
$10 billion guarantees.
In the shortterm, such a move is
self-serving for the Bush adminis
tration: it is an election year, and
President Bush does not want to
appear too hard on Israel and there
by damage his re-election chances.
Furthermore, Mr. Rabin's gov
ernment has made the right move
in declaring a temporary halt to
settlements. Although by the
most optimistic estimates the pro
posed halt is going to only affect a
tiny minority of the total number
of housing starts, it is enough to
provide Mr. Bush with an excuse
to grant loan guarantees where
previously he has chosen not to.
If the Bush administration is
interested in seeing its efforts for
Middle East peace bear fruit, the
granting of the $10 billion must be
accompanied by an absolute halt
to the continued colonization of
the West Bank and Gaza.
There are several reasons for
this. Firstly, the Bush administra
tion, and Mr. Baker in particular,
have so far managed to maintain
their credibility as honest brokers

in the Middle East peace talks.
However, they are bound to
lose that status in the eyes of the
Arabs if they fold to pressure and
provide the loan guarantees pure
ly on the basis of symbolic rather
than substantive gestures on the
part of the Rabin government.
Furthermore, if the loan guar
antees are granted while Mr.
Rabin embarks on a program of
colonial expansion of those settle
ments that he deems necessary for
"security," the Bush administra
tion will be seen as underwriting
that expansion, further under
mining their credibility.
Probably the greatest foresee
able effect of granting the loan
guarantees without an agreement
to halt settlements absolutely, is
that the peace talks might break
down altogether.
The return of the Palestinian
delegation to the next round of
peace talks is contingent on the
abatement of settlement activity.
For the Palestinian delegation, the
subject of negotiations is the status
of the Occupied Territories, with
the objective being the creation of
an independent Palestinian state
at some time in the future.
If the Israeli government is
continuing with a policy of colo
nization of the Occupied Territo
ries, then the objectives of the
Palestinian delegation at a peace
conference have already been
ruled out by the actions of that
government in the territories.
Whether that land is being colo
nized because Mr. Rabin has
deemed it necessary for "security"
is irrelevant; to paraphrase Hanan
Ashrawi, how do you differentiate
between legal and illegal theft?
Acceptance by a Palestinian
delegation of the appropriation of
yet more Palestinian land before
negotiations have even begun
would make their attendance
pointless in that it renders their
objective unattainable.
For the Bush administration,
the loan guarantees remain the
lever with which they can exert in
fluence on the actions of the Is
raeli government, and one that
should not be given up for the re
cent symbolic gestures by Mr.
Rabin's government.
If Mr. Rabin is serious about
peace, he must be willing to call a
halt to all settlement activity. Only
then will the peace talks be placed
in a context that is meaningful to
all parties, and only then would the
granting of the loan guarantees not
be detrimental to the peace talks,
and the impartial standing of the
Bush administration.
This leaves Bush in a dilemma.
If he grants the loan guarantees
now, before more substantive
progress is made to reassure both
sides that the peace talks are being
taken seriously, he may set the
peace process back, and make the
further participation of his admin
istration in the process suspect.
And then again, if he fails to
grant the loan guarantees and ap
pease the electorate, he just might
not get re-elected at all. . ..

After Mr. Baker's recent talks
with Mr. Rabin in
Jerusalem, the subject of
loan guarantees is once more on
the table.
So, to loan guarantee or not to
loan guarantee?
The answer to this question is
not so easy as some would have us
believe.
For the many Russian Jewish
immigrants to Israel, the journey
has been far from a bundle of
laughs. Arriving in Israel, having
had few other possible places to
which to migrate, they discovered
a country in economic disarray
and a government that had little
interest in providing them with ei
ther jobs or housing.
Despite being in general re
markably well-qualified, most
were forced into low-paying posi
tions, if they could find jobs at all.
And there was no option to
leave, the Catch-22 being that de
parture is contingent on repaying
the Israeli government the entire
cost of relocation from Russia,
which tended to price the option of
a second immigration out of the
market.
It's unsurprising, then, though
a little ironic, that the mtyority of
East European Jews these days
are choosing to immigrate to Ger
many to escape anti-Semitism.
