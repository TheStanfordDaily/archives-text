## Expectation game skews Olympic feats 
### 
THE BARCELONA OLYMPICS should be a
time of celebration for Stanford. Athletes affil
iated with the University have already captured
eight medals in the opening days, and they expect to
win many more as the Games continue.
But the headlines speak not of stellar perfor
mances and close races, but of disappointment and
sorrow: "Great expectations unfulfilled," in the
words of one local newspaper.
Stanford's swimmers were expected to bring gold
medals back to The Farm, and anything less is
thought to be unacceptable.
But unacceptable to whom? Should Jenny Thomp
son really be disappointed to have won only a silver
medal after her first two races?
"I thought I should be on the top but I blew it,"
Thompson said Monday after failing to qualify for the
finals in the 200-meter freestyle.
"But, I mean, a silver medal in the Olympics isn't
bad and so I shouldn't gripe. I should be happy and so
I am happy."
Few other swimmers would say a silver medal
"isn't bad." For them, it would be a dream come true
— the fulfillment of something they had worked their
entire life to achieve.
But Thompson — and the other Stanford favorites
such as Summer Sanders and Jeff Rouse — are
thought to be something different.
The media picked its favorites weeks ago and
crowned them gold medal winners, writing that the
only question was whether the athlete in question
would set a world record on the way to his or her
championship.
Many athletes appeared to take the pre-Olympic
hype to heart, believing that anything less than a
gold-medal, record-breaking performance would be a
disappointment.
Thompson admitted Monday that she needs to win

a gold medal in Friday's 50-meter freestyle for her to
consider the Olympics a success, saying that she had
"choked big time" during her silver-medal, 100-
meter freestyle performance.
How sad it is that both Thompson and the media
treat the race as one in which she "choked." Can no
one look beyond American athletes to the rest of the
world?
It is true that Thompson was the world-record
holder in the event, but maybe, just maybe, she was
simply beaten by someone who had a better day.
Zhuang Yong of China swam the race of her life, and
she deserves credit for it.
Some Stanford athletes, however, truly deserve
sympathy. Everyone's heart had to go out to gymnast
Jair Lynch after his tragic tumble on the vault.
Yet the Olympics never fail to produce stories of
inspiration, and the Games in Barcelona are no ex
ception.
Who can help but be touched by the gold-medal
performance of Stanford graduate Pablo Morales,
who returned from his 1984 silver-medal "disap
pointment" and failure to qualify for the 1988 Games
to win the 100-meter butterfly at age 27.
Sanders and Thompson were predicted to be the
"golden girls" of the Games, following Mary Lou Ret
ton and Janet Evans into fame and fortune. Perhaps
they will still assume that role.
But even if they do not win another medal, they
should still walk away from Barcelona with their
heads held high.
In fact, all of Stanford's athletes in Barcelona
should return home with a feeling of pride, for they
were selected to represent their country and per
formed the best they could against the greatest ath
letes in the world.
After all, even if they leave the Games empty
handed, they are still Olympians.
