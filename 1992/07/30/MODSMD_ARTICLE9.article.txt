## Don't be 'cheap' — save this planet 
### 
One Friday I stood my right
foot down on the pedal, brought
the other leg around, and wheeled
my bike onto Palm Drive. Then I
pulled up my head and saw some
thing unusual.
Delicate white tentacles were
hanging over the hills behind
Memorial Church. Unusual: visi
ble low-hanging moisture is a
very rare sight in Northern Cali
fornia, in mid-summer, in this
sixth year of drought, ...
Smoke. I thought of the Oak
land hills inferno from November
1990 and tried to switch off the
images of fire.
Smoke was the more likely
possibility.
As it happened, the fire burned
out in a matter of hours, scorch
ing 'only' 500 acres or so of cam
pus land in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains — the Foothills — up by the
Dish. Still, the July 10 fire pro
vides yet another reminder that
we here in California are always
vulnerable to natural disaster.
But while we cannot avoid
being vulnerable, we need not be

victims. In the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake, Stanford and much
of the Bay Area avoided death, se
rious injury and overwhelming
property damage largely because
of careful planning. The lack of
that ingredient played a signifi
cant role in the Oakland hills fire.
There, lax regulations let con
tractors and landscapers create a
residential zone full of materials
which exacerbated, rather than
retarded, fire.
A dearth of care also led to the
deaths of thousands in the 1989
earthquake that ravaged Armenia.
Then, hundreds of buildings col
lapsed because contractors had di
luted the concrete so they could
sell the pilfered material for black
market profits.
Time and again we have learned
that by disregarding nature we only
cheat ourselves. The price tag con
tinues to mount, for humanity has
engaged in foolhardy pursuits. We
build near beaches that are subject
to hurricanes and tidal waves. We
build on plains that suffer torna
does and flooding. We build in

deserts scorched by sun.. ..
Not only do humans defy the
environment, we assault it —
again, to our own detriment. In
dustrial pollution has combined
with automobile exhaust to trans
form city air into a health hazard.
Medical refuse flows into the
ocean, and onto the beaches.
The planet, besieged by human
consumption and human emission,
hardly seems able to support life in
a suitable fashion for much longer.
Are things likely to get better or
worse? Today, Stanford University
is training thousands of scientists,
engineers, corporate executives and
public officials. But while I have
faith in the ingenuity of my class
mates, I doubt that they wall ward
ofTenvironmental catastrophe.
Having lived in several Stanford
dorms, I have witnessed firsthand
the carelessness of the nation's
smartest students. Every day, and
each weekend, trash accumulates
in the dining halls, the hallways,
the lounges, the bathrooms.
