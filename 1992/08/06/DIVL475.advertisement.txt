Last year's disasters were the most devastating in the
history of Red Cross disaster relief. Our disaster relief
funds are gone. And we still haven't faced the spring
floods or tornadoes we know are coming.
Victims count on us 24 hours a day, so we can't
shorten hours or cut back disaster services.
Our only choice is to raise millions immediately.
To make sure we're able to provide the relief victims
count on.
To expect less of the Red Cross is unthinkable.
Please help.
