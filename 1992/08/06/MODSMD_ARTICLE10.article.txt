# Rooting out the 'Impostors'
## A 						Hoover scholar issues a scathing attack on academia, but the academics have a few words of their own 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Scapegoating the "eggheads" has a
long tradition in American history.
In that context, Martin Ander
son's scathing attack on academia — con
tained in his new book, "Impostors in the
Temple" — is nothing new.
But, during an election year in which
"cultural elites" and "family values" have
become buzzwords, Anderson puts a new
twist on the practice. In his book, he de
nounces academics as "corrupt priests"
who have intellectually, ethically and
morally bankrupted America's places of
learning.
A member of the Hoover Institution
since 1971, Anderson frequently aims his
barbs at Stanford. He skewers Stanford's
multicultural movement, rehashes the
fight over locating the Reagan Library on
campus in the mid-'Bos, and compares the
indirect-cost controversy to a Greek
tragedy.
"Perhaps someday we shall see a play
written about how some of the gifted intel
lectuals of our time who crossed the bound
aries of their moira were brought down by
a nemesis named Biddle," Anderson
writes.
Published this month, the book claims
as its forebears two recent conservative
critiques of higher education, Dinesh
D'Souza's "Illiberal Education" and Allan
Bloom's "The Closing of the American
Mind."
Liberal critics, however, have savaged
"Impostors," arguing that Anderson does
nothing more than compile nasty anec
dotes and half-truths — but without the
witty edge of his predecessors.
Meanwhile, Anderson's conservative al
lies — including William F. Buckley and
William Bennett — have hailed the book,
arguing that it puts a dent in the "political
ly correct" monolith.
"He will need a division of marines to
defend him," Buckley writes in "advance
praise" on the book's back cover, "but I can
think of plenty of volunteers: everyone
who has a son or daughter at college."
A former senior adviser to Presidents
Reagan and Nixon, Anderson makes a
sweeping attack on American universities
and intellectuals in his book, criticizing
everything from academics' left-leaning
politics to the "corrupting impact" of big
time college athletics.

But Alan Ryan, a political science pro
fessor at Princeton who reviewed Ander
son's book for The Washington Post,
thinks the book will have virtually no im
pact on the debate about how to fix the
American university system, which has
come under increasing attack in recent
years.
"Everybody has said more or less the
same thing 70 times already," Ryan said in
an interview. "People are getting very tired
of this kind of mud-slinging at universi
ties."

The style Ander
son employs to
make his points,
Ryan adds, re- i
minds him of "the /

kind of tasteless,

Willie Horton
like stuff that his
employers used J
to specialize in." I

The "hu
bris" ol
the aca

demic intellec
tuals — their
arrogance and

"haughty
pride" in the
face of their

demonstrated corrup

tion — is what concerns Anderson.
Subtitled "American Intellectuals
are Destroying our Universities and
Cheating our Students of Their Future,"
his book indicts American universities for
promising students something they don't
receive — quality teaching by researchers
whose work makes a difference in the real
world.
In an interview in his office, Anderson
repeatedly criticizes the quality of teaching
and research, although less caustically
than he does in his book. Focusing on elite
institutions like Stanford and the Ivy
League schools, Anderson argues that
their quality has declined since he attend
ed Dartmouth as an undergraduate, and
MIT as a graduate student, in the late
1950s and early 19605.
"I've been thinking about this for close
to 30 years," says Anderson, a gray-haired,
gnomish man whose office walls are deco
rated with the bounty collected during his
years in conservative administrations —
among them, a framed portrait of Ronald

Reagan wearing a cowboy hat.
A large mirror runs the length of the wall
beside Anderson's desk, and a replica of "The
Thinker" stands in a corner of the office.
Anderson leans forward intently, lacing
his hands together, as he emphasizes his
central point. The main problem in Ameri
can universities today is not "political cor
rectness," as critics of higher education like
D'Souza have argued. The real problem is
teaching and research — "the whole ques
tion of who teaches college and university
students and how research is conducted,"
Anderson says. "Are universities doing what
they say they do?"

Too often, he argues, they
are not. Courses

are mcreas
. ingly taught
' by teaching as
sistants —

112 often foreign
' graduate stu
dents who
"don't speak,

112 write or under
stand English
very well," he
writes in his book
— or by professors

[I who are more inter
/ ested in producing a
[bulk of research
than in teaching
well.

I "Real teach
ing," Anderson says,

consists of more than
just giving lectures — professors must also
lead discussions, personally grade the
exams and sit down with students to dis
cuss career options.
But instead of working to improve
teaching, Anderson says, universities cut
back on library hours and use more gradu
ate students to teach classes. At the same
time, he adds, universities spend big
money to hire football coaches — he singles
out the reported $350,000 salary for Stan
ford's new coach, Bill Walsh — and are im
plicated in financial scandals like the indi
rect-cost controversy.
"I think I know where the money is
going," Anderson says.
And even in research, billed as a strong
suit, much of the work produced by Ameri
can academics is irrelevant — something
Anderson says he learned while working as
a policy-maker in Washington for more

than a decade.
"The vast mtgority of what is being
written today is not completely worthless,
but close to it,"he says. In his book An
derson is even more critical, calling acad
emic research and writing "the greatest
intellectual fraud of the twentieth centu
ry."
Anderson recommends a number of so
lutions, including prohibiting student
teaching, separating the teachers from the
researchers, ferreting out athletic and in
stitutional corruption, and ending the sys
tem of faculty tenure.
But Anderson saves his most vehe
ment prose to attack the values of the
academic intellectuals — to lament
the "death of integrity in the heart of high
er education."
In doing so, his critics charge, he ignores
much of the complexity of the situation,
and degenerates into telling a collection of
nasty anecdotes.
Anderson defends his book, saying, "I
didn't do that stuff, I just wrote about it."
And he adds that academics, because of
their "intellectual arrogance," don't take
criticism well anyway. "They treat any
criticism as an affront," he says. "They
tend to lump it together."
But Ryan says he was dismayed by the
"malice" of Anderson's book, adding that
"because it's all done in this kind of broad
brush way, there's no suggestion that
some places might be doing something bet
ter than others."
University President Donald Kennedy,
whose outspoken liberalism and long-run
ning feud with former Hoover Director W.
Glenn Campbell irked conservatives like
Anderson, is singled out for some sharp
criticism in the book — although Anderson
also praises Kennedy's initiatives to im
prove undergraduate education.
The book's index directs readers toward
the "liberal politics of," "salary of," and "fi
nancial scandal attached to" Stanford's
outgoing president.
Kennedy, who "glanced through" the
book, says it "will certainly anger people
because of the sharp nature of some of the
attacks." But he believes the book "is not
going to have much of an impact."
Perhaps speaking more candidly than
he might have were he not stepping down
at the end of the month, Kennedy says:"I
think he's determined to get his revenge by
writing badly."

Scapegoating the "eggheads" has a
long tradition in American history.
In that context, Martin Ander
son's scathing attack on academia — con
tained in his new book, "Impostors in the
Temple" — is nothing new.
But, during an election year in which
"cultural elites" and "family values" have
become buzzwords, Anderson puts a new
twist on the practice. In his book, he de
nounces academics as "corrupt priests"
who have intellectually, ethically and
morally bankrupted America's places of
learning.
A member of the Hoover Institution
since 1971, Anderson frequently aims his
barbs at Stanford. He skewers Stanford's
multicultural movement, rehashes the
fight over locating the Reagan Library on
campus in the mid-'Bos, and compares the
indirect-cost controversy to a Greek
tragedy.
"Perhaps someday we shall see a play
written about how some of the gifted intel
lectuals of our time who crossed the bound
aries of their moira were brought down by
a nemesis named Biddle," Anderson
writes.
Published this month, the book claims
as its forebears two recent conservative
critiques of higher education, Dinesh
D'Souza's "Illiberal Education" and Allan
Bloom's "The Closing of the American
Mind."
Liberal critics, however, have savaged
"Impostors," arguing that Anderson does
nothing more than compile nasty anec
dotes and half-truths — but without the
witty edge of his predecessors.
Meanwhile, Anderson's conservative al
lies — including William F. Buckley and
William Bennett — have hailed the book,
arguing that it puts a dent in the "political
ly correct" monolith.
"He will need a division of marines to
defend him," Buckley writes in "advance
praise" on the book's back cover, "but I can
think of plenty of volunteers: everyone
who has a son or daughter at college."
A former senior adviser to Presidents
Reagan and Nixon, Anderson makes a
sweeping attack on American universities
and intellectuals in his book, criticizing
everything from academics' left-leaning
politics to the "corrupting impact" of big
time college athletics.

But Alan Ryan, a political science pro
fessor at Princeton who reviewed Ander
son's book for The Washington Post,
thinks the book will have virtually no im
pact on the debate about how to fix the
American university system, which has
come under increasing attack in recent
years.
"Everybody has said more or less the
same thing 70 times already," Ryan said in
an interview. "People are getting very tired
of this kind of mud-slinging at universi
ties."

The style Ander
son employs to
make his points,
Ryan adds, re- i
minds him of "the /

kind of tasteless,

Willie Horton
like stuff that his
employers used J
to specialize in." I

The "hu
bris" ol
the aca

demic intellec
tuals — their
arrogance and

"haughty
pride" in the
face of their

demonstrated corrup

tion — is what concerns Anderson.
Subtitled "American Intellectuals
are Destroying our Universities and
Cheating our Students of Their Future,"
his book indicts American universities for
promising students something they don't
receive — quality teaching by researchers
whose work makes a difference in the real
world.
In an interview in his office, Anderson
repeatedly criticizes the quality of teaching
and research, although less caustically
than he does in his book. Focusing on elite
institutions like Stanford and the Ivy
League schools, Anderson argues that
their quality has declined since he attend
ed Dartmouth as an undergraduate, and
MIT as a graduate student, in the late
1950s and early 19605.
"I've been thinking about this for close
to 30 years," says Anderson, a gray-haired,
gnomish man whose office walls are deco
rated with the bounty collected during his
years in conservative administrations —
among them, a framed portrait of Ronald

Reagan wearing a cowboy hat.
A large mirror runs the length of the wall
beside Anderson's desk, and a replica of "The
Thinker" stands in a corner of the office.
Anderson leans forward intently, lacing
his hands together, as he emphasizes his
central point. The main problem in Ameri
can universities today is not "political cor
rectness," as critics of higher education like
D'Souza have argued. The real problem is
teaching and research — "the whole ques
tion of who teaches college and university
students and how research is conducted,"
Anderson says. "Are universities doing what
they say they do?"

Too often, he argues, they
are not. Courses

are mcreas
. ingly taught
' by teaching as
sistants —

112 often foreign
' graduate stu
dents who
"don't speak,

112 write or under
stand English
very well," he
writes in his book
— or by professors

[I who are more inter
/ ested in producing a
[bulk of research
than in teaching
well.

I "Real teach
ing," Anderson says,

consists of more than
just giving lectures — professors must also
lead discussions, personally grade the
exams and sit down with students to dis
cuss career options.
But instead of working to improve
teaching, Anderson says, universities cut
back on library hours and use more gradu
ate students to teach classes. At the same
time, he adds, universities spend big
money to hire football coaches — he singles
out the reported $350,000 salary for Stan
ford's new coach, Bill Walsh — and are im
plicated in financial scandals like the indi
rect-cost controversy.
"I think I know where the money is
going," Anderson says.
And even in research, billed as a strong
suit, much of the work produced by Ameri
can academics is irrelevant — something
Anderson says he learned while working as
a policy-maker in Washington for more

than a decade.
"The vast mtgority of what is being
written today is not completely worthless,
but close to it,"he says. In his book An
derson is even more critical, calling acad
emic research and writing "the greatest
intellectual fraud of the twentieth centu
ry."
Anderson recommends a number of so
lutions, including prohibiting student
teaching, separating the teachers from the
researchers, ferreting out athletic and in
stitutional corruption, and ending the sys
tem of faculty tenure.
But Anderson saves his most vehe
ment prose to attack the values of the
academic intellectuals — to lament
the "death of integrity in the heart of high
er education."
In doing so, his critics charge, he ignores
much of the complexity of the situation,
and degenerates into telling a collection of
nasty anecdotes.
Anderson defends his book, saying, "I
didn't do that stuff, I just wrote about it."
And he adds that academics, because of
their "intellectual arrogance," don't take
criticism well anyway. "They treat any
criticism as an affront," he says. "They
tend to lump it together."
But Ryan says he was dismayed by the
"malice" of Anderson's book, adding that
"because it's all done in this kind of broad
brush way, there's no suggestion that
some places might be doing something bet
ter than others."
