## In tranquil setting, Casper gets busy 
### 
After spending a week at Stan
ford's stunning research center in
the Foothills, where he leaves the
door of his wood-panelled office
open and holds meetings in a
shady grove overlooking campus,
Gerhard Casper says he is recon
sidering becoming Stanford's
president.
"This is the greatest thing
they've ever done by allowing me
to stay up here," said Casper, who
arrived at the secluded Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences last Tuesday to prepare
to take over as president. He re
places Donald Kennedy Sept.l.
Casper said he once received an
offer to study at the center in the
mid-19705, but, for some reason,
decided not to come. "I've been
getting increasingly angry at my
self for turning down that offer,"
he said.
But the relaxed setting at the
center has been a sharp contrast to
the demanding pace he has kept as
he girds himself for the presiden
cy. "Everybody is pushing papers
on me," said Casper, who has been
brushing up on Stanford history
as if it were a homework assign
ment for the past five months
The complex task of reorganiz
ing Stanford's administrative
structure, which he immediately
announced as one of his goals
when he was named president in
mid-March, is the only issue on
which Casper said he has made
substantial progress. But he de
clined to go into detail, saying the
topic is "nothing I am prepared to
talk about yet."
Casper meets with faculty
members and administrators for
about 10 to 12 hours each day, in
cluding several hours with
Provost Gerald Lieberman, a long
time faculty member and former
chair of the Faculty Senate.
In the months before Casper
takes over, some on campus have
worried that his outsider status
and his tenure at the more tradi
tional University of Chicago will
prevent his smooth integration
into the Stanford community.
In addition, an April speech he
made, questioning the long-term
feasibility of need-blind admis
sions, jolted many on campus and
sparked a letter-writing campaign
by nervous students who urged
him to retain the policy.
Casper, however, said his dis
cussions have not been hindered
by any stereotypes or mispercep
tions people may have of him. "But
that may be because people are not
very likely to repeat [their con
cerns] to my face," he said, even
though "they may be privately
worried."
The incoming president said he
often feels besieged, receiving mail
about "every possible issue," from
need-blind admissions to the often
irreverent Stanford Band.
The two issues span the range
of his concern. About the first,
Casper said he is firmly committed
to maintaining the policy; about
the second, he said, "I have no
views on the marching band" and
quickly began asking those around
him, "Do you have any views on
the marching band?"
Casper has been working close
ly with Kennedy during the transi
tion, already meeting with him
several times. Asked whether he
had come across any of the "land
mines" that Kennedy had said he
would try to locate for him, Casper
replied: "If I had come across land
mines, I wouldn't tell you. I would
try to remove them so that some
body wouldn't trip on them."
Casper has avoided making de
finitive statements about his plans
for Stanford, arguing that as an out
sider, he must first learn about it.
And he said yesterday that he won't
offer any clues during his highly an
ticipated inaugural address, either.
Past presidents have used their
inaugurations to lay out new di
rections. Kennedy, for instance,

announced the creation of the
Stanford Humanities Center and
made a powerful statement about
the importance of teaching during
his 1980 inaugural address. But
Casper said his speech will defi
nitely not be "an announcement to
the world about specific plans or
the state of higher education."
Instead, he said, it will be "an
affair of Stanford University, for
Stanford University — it will not
be an event of any sort."
