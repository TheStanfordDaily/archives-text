# Search underway for replacements
## 
### 
University officials are con
ducting a nationwide search for a
new assistant dean of students
and a multicultural educator to re
place Keith Archuleta and Greg
Ricks, respectively.
The University has established a
search committee consisting of fac
ulty, students and staff for the assis
tant dean of students position, ac
cording to senior Nelda Brown, one
of three students on the committee.
The committee is being chaired by
Education Prof. John Baugh.
A search committee for the
multicultural educator has not
been chosen completely yet, ac
cording to Dean of Students
Michael Jackson.
Student members of the com
mittee have already been chosen —
on the basis of their work on Ricks'
multicultural programs, public
service in the black community or
experience as a resident assistant.
Both jobs are being nationally
advertised, Jackson said. The ap
plication deadline is Aug. 28, and
the search committees will begin
interviewing applicants shortly
after, he added.

Former Multi
cultural Educator
Greg Ricks an
nounced on May
12 that he was
leaving the Uni
versity to become
vice president for
education and
training at City
Year, a non-profit

"urban peace corps" in Boston.
Keith Archuleta, formerly one
of 12 assistant deans and director
of the Black Community Services
Center, resigned in June after he
was arrested for secretly videotap
ing several women while they
changed clothes in his bedroom

photography studio.
Jackson expressed optimism at
having a new multicultural educa
tor chosen and "starting work
right away by October."
A new assistant dean of students
and BCSC director will be chosen

after the school
year starts, and
will begin work
Jan. 1 of next
year, according to
Brown.
"Michael
Jackson let it be
known that he
wanted student
input," Brown

said. "A final decision would not be
made until the students got back."
Students make up half of a six
member search committee for the
new assistant dean, which consists
of a culturally diverse set of indi
viduals from different facets of
campus life who are "very familiar
with the Black Community Ser
vices Center," Brown added.
Barbara Smith, assistant direc
tor of the Black Community Ser
vices Center, is temporarily filling
Archuleta's role as acting director
and assistant dean.
Smith "has been here for sever
al years and has worked with the
students" and Archuleta already,
Brown said. Smith's experience
working with student leaders and
volunteers on issues important to
the community made the transi
tion easier, she added.
"It was back to business as nor
mal" after Archuleta resigned,
Brown said, citing the successful
Black Baccalaureate program in
June as an example of how
smoothly Smith settled into the
position.
No interim multicultural edu
cator will be designated for the
time being, said Ann Porteus, di
rector of Residential Education.
"There are a lot of resources on
campus," she said. And while the
Res Ed office "needs somebody to
think of programming," Porteus
said her office "can still offer
that."
"We wish there were somebody
here" for the present time, she said.
"But these searches take longer
than that."
For Orientation, Assoc. Dean of
Memorial Church Diana Akiyama
will direct the Faces of Communi
ty Program, a multimedia cultural
presentation introducing fresh
men to Stanford's diversity.
