# Freelen retires from Public Affairs
## 
### 
Robert Freelen, the Universi
ty's vice president for public af
fairs, announced Friday that he
will retire Feb. 28.
Freelen, 58, has served in the
position since 1983.
During the last three years,
Freelen helped manage some of
the University's most high-profile
public events, including its Cen
tennial Celebration and two visits
by former Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
His office also dealt with Stan
ford's biggest public-relations crisis
— the controversy over the Univer
sity's recovery of indirect costs of
government-sponsored research.
Freelen said yesterday that he
does not know what he will do after
leaving Stanford, but said he might
take an administrative position at
another college or university.
"It seems like a natural time to
do something else," Freelen said.
Freelen and his office were
heavily criticized for the handling
of the indirect costs controversy,
as well as the ousting of Bob Bey
ers, the former director of Stan
ford News Service, in 1990.

Beyers, known for
the candor with
which News Ser
vice disclosed Uni
versity news,
claimed the ad
ministration was
muzzling honest
journalism in
favor of corporate
style public rela-

tions. Freelen argued that Beyers
was a poor manager.
But the criticism stuck, and
some observers said Stanford,
under Freelen, was increasingly
"managing" University news.
Freelen heads an office that in
cludes the departments of commu
nity relations, government rela
tions, university relations, events
and services, the news service and
Stanford Publication Services.
The University has not said
when or how a successor to Freelen
will be named, but some insiders
are speculating that the position
may be eliminated entirely if the
office is reorganized under incom
ing President Gerhard Casper.
Freelen has worked at Stanford
for 31 years, starting in the devel
opment office before becoming
dean of students, director of gov

ernment relations and associate
vice president for public affairs.
