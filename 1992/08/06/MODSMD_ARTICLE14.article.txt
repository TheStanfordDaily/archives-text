# Business lecturer may buy Giants
## 
### 
In an effort to keep the San
Francisco Giants in the Bay Area,
millionaire businessman and
Graduate School of Business lec
turer H. Irving Grousebeck re
vealed last week he may spearhead
a group of investors interested in
purchasing the baseball team.
Other potential buyers have
threatened to move the team out
of town, but Grousebeck said he
would make keeping the team in
the San Francisco area a priority.
Grousebeck, who is reportedly
worth more than $100 million, is
currently examining the team's fi
nancial statements and will decide
whether to invest in several weeks.
"I haven't yet had any conversa
tions with Bob Lurie (the Giants'
owner)," said Grousebeck. "We're
currently looking through the vo
luminous financial documents
that he has provided us with."
Grousebeck, a Portola Valley res
ident, said he will first try sites for a
new ballpark in San Francisco but, if
unsuccessful, will look at locations
in the Peninsula. The Giants cur
rently play at San Francisco's Can
dlestick Park, which has been criti
cized as too cold and windy.
"I think the Giants are a civic
asset and I'd like to be a part of the
process to keep them here,"
Grousebeck said. Other interested
purchasers have suggested mov
ingtheclub, 51-56 so for this year,
to other cities, including St. Pe
tersburg, Florida.
If he purchases the team,
Grousebeck said his primary goal
would be to develop a winning ball
club. He said that he hoped not to
lose money and would try to get
the franchise to break even or turn
a marginal profit.
Grousebeck would not comment
on how much money he would be
willing to invest in the team.
Financial analysts place the
team's value near $100 million, ac
cording to the San Francisco
Chronicle.

Mayor Frank Jordan to keep the

investment.
Grousebeck said he has followed
the Giants since he was young, lis
tening to the then New York Giants
from his Massachusetts home.
According to a recent Forbes
magazine article, Grousebeck
earned part of his fortune from in
vesting in cable television. He owns
a 10 percent share of Continental
Cablevision Inc., a Boston-based
cable television company which he
co-founded in 1983 with a $4,000
investment.
Grousebeck, 58, has been on the
Business School faculty for seven
years and lectures on entrepreneur
ial issues. He teaches a second-year
M.B.A. elective titled "Entrepre
neurship - Forms of New Ventures."
If he purchases the team,
Grousebeck said he would have to
cut back his teaching load, but
would still teach one class each
year. "I can't bear the thought of
giving it up," he said.
