# New auxiliary library planned
## 
### 
In order to complete repairs of
damages sustained to Green Li
brary's West Wing in the 1989
earthquake, University officials
plan to move approximately
750,000 books from Green to a
soon-to-be-constructed $6.2 mil
lion auxiliary library.
The second Stanford Auxiliary
Library, known as SAL 2, will be
constructed adjacent to the cur
rent auxiliary library on Pampas
Lane by January 1993.
The two libraries will be fused
into one building capable of holding
1.5 million volumes. The completed
auxiliary library will also include a
staff area and a separate reading
space, according to Joan Krasner,
chief of access services at Green.
About $2 million for the project
is expected to come from the Fed
eral Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), although this
contribution has not been final
ized, said Philip Leighton, build
ings projects manager for Libraries
and Information Resources.
The remainder of the project
will be financed by Stanford's
Earthquake Facilities Reserve.
According to Krasner, SAL 2
will hold lesser-used volumes from
Green Library's West Wing while
the wing is repaired. In general,
the books in the auxiliary libraries
will be the only copies available,
but in some cases other copies will
be available elsewhere in the Stan
ford library system.
Although leasing space would
be a less expensive way to store the
displaced books, Leighton said
that building SAL 2 makes more
sense in the long term.
"The libraries are currently
close to full working capacity. This
is a chance to get long-term bene
fits from these funds and augment
space," he said.
SAL 2 will have the same hours
as the current auxiliary library,
Monday through Friday 1 to 5
p.m. Although these hours may be
inconvenient for some students
and faculty, officials plan to ex
tend SAL's paging service from
five to seven days per week.
Using this paging service, li
brary users may request books
from SAL and the books will be de
livered to the Green loan desk
within 24 hours.
The paging service has not been
used extensively in the past, but
administrators expect greater
usage as a result of SAL 2 and
week-long availability. Krasner
said she has not heard any com
plaints about the system, and does
not foresee any problems with the
increased volume.
Volumes will be periodically re
viewed in order to determine what
will return to Green and what will
stay in SAL after the West Wing
repairs are completed, said Tony
Angiletta, acting director of col
lections.

In addition to the construction
of SAL 2, the 3-year restoration of
Green's West Wing will require
the Johnsson Library of Govern
ment Documents to be temporari
ly relocated to Green's South
Stacks, where it was located in
1987 and 1988.
The Johnsson Library is now lo
cated on floors one, two and three
of the West Wing. The library is de
signed to be open to the public, and
its relocation to the South Stacks
poses some challenges to the li
brary administration.
In order to provide access to the
public, Johnsson will be caged off
from the rest of the South Stacks,
and patrons will enter using the
stairway located in the plaza be
tween Green and Meyer, said
Leigh ton.
However, this solution may not
satisfy all users. If they are unable
to use the stairs, patrons with phys
ical disabilities will have to be es
corted through Green to Johnsson.
Molly Sandperl, director of the
Disability Resource Center, ex
pressed some reservations about
this situation, which would in
volve a separate entrance for peo
ple with physical disabilities.
"It's not great, but it's a tempo
rary thing and they are providing a
way to get in," Sandperl said. "I
would hope [the library staff] would
make a clear procedure for people
with disabilities to use the library."
Sandperl added that the
arrangement is not a violation of
disability access laws, but does not
really uphold the spirit of the law
because people with disabilities
may feel like they have to use the
"back door."
