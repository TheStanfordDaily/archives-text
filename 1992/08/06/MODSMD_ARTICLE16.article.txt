# Rosse finds new job challenging
## 
### 
When former Provost James
Rosse left Stanford last April to
head Freedom Newspapers, he
probably thought he had left bud
get cuts and presidential search
controversies behind. But he was
back in the thick of it recently,
when the Orange County Regis
ter, one of Freedom's subsidiaries,
ran an editorial urging President
Bush to quit the presidential race.
Rosse's duties as the newspaper
chain's president and chief execu

tive officer do not bring him into the
editorial arena, but instead allow
him a more laissez-faire approach.
"My principle job is as the strategic
leader of the paper," he said.
He contrasted this position with
his provost's post, saying that at
Stanford, he was a "more hands-on
operator."

Rosse said he
was surprised at
the public's reac
tion of shock at
the editorial last
Sunday and their
mistaken belief
that the Orange
County Register
is a Republican
newspaper.

"I felt some consternation at it
being described as a Republican
newspaper," he said, "which it is
not."
And while Orange County is
considered a Republican strong
hold, Rosse said the county was
"strongly Perot-oriented" until
the independent candidate
dropped out of the race last month.
Rosse described the Orange
County paper as a "free-thinking
newspaper" and said that if the
Register holds one political view
point strongly, it is libertarianism.
Besides the Orange County
Register, Irvine-based Freedom
Newspapers owns 25 other daily
newspapers, five weeklies, five
television stations and a cable
news service.
One of the "really interesting
challenges" of heading such a
wide-reaching organization, Rosse
said, is learning how to manage
the many "strongly independent
organizations within it."
The newspaper chain, with
about 7,000 employees, is "pretty
close to the size of Stanford,"
Rosse noted.
And while Rosse said he gained
some similar management experi
ence from his seven and a half years
as University provost, he said it is
"quite an extreme experience" at
Freedom. "Here the lines of re
sponsibility and accountability are
much more clearly drawn," he said.
But Rosse meets the rigors of the
job with enthusiasm. "I find it chal
lenging and rewarding," he said.
And so far there are no budget
problems, Rosse added.
