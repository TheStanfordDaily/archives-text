# Construction disrupts stoplights

### 
A Redwood City contractor acci
dentally cut the underground sen
sors regulating two traffic lights on
Stanford Avenue, meaning that
traffic on the road will continue to
be slowed for about three weeks,
City of Palo engineers said.
The problem began two weeks
ago, when the West Valley Con
struction Company severed one of
the "loops" under the road as it re
placed water mains in the College
Terrace area, according to Palo
Alto project manager Chuck Borg.
Since then, the lights — which
normally turn green as cars ap
proach them on Stanford Avenue
— have been placed on "fixed
timer" and now stay red at fixed
intervals, even if there are no cars
on the less-traveled roads that in
tersect Stanford Avenue — Escon
dido and Hanover streets.
But the sensors will not be re
paired for about another three
weeks, when the contractor is sched
uled to work on the area near the two
traffic lights, Borg said. The lights
are within 50 yards of each other on
Stanford Avenue, which is the main
artery leading to El Camino Real on
the east side of campus.
"It's a little inconvenient, and I
understand it, and we're going to
get to it as soon as we can," Borg
said. To repair the delicate traffic
sensor system, the contractor must
replace the entire loop, he said.
"When you cut a loop, you can't
go back and just repair that loop,"
Borg said. "What you have to do is
take the whole thing out. Then
you put down your new paving, a
saw puts a new loop in and you put
your wire back."
The lights on Stanford Avenue
are normally "traffic demand re
sponsive" or "traffic actuated" sig
nals, according to City Traffic En
gineer Ashok Aggarwal.
That means they stay in an "all
red mode" — red for traffic in all
four directions — until a car ap
proaches. When that happens,
"the loop tells the controller, 'Hey,
look, there is traffic in that direc
tion. Go green,"' Aggarwal said.
But because the loop is cut,
"whether there is traffic or not,
every so often the signal is going to
go green for the side streets," he

said. "That's why there are delays
on Stanford Avenue."
It is a recurring problem, ac
cording to the traffic engineer.
"It's unfortunate these things hap
pen, but they happen all the time,"
Aggarwal said. "There's nothing
we can do, other than to keep harp
ing on these contractors to be more
careful when they work."
He said the contractor must pick
up the tab for repairing the severed
loop. "Whatever it cost, they have
to pay for it," Aggarwal said.
