•The Office of Naval Research,
which sets the overhead rate for
federally supported research at
Stanford and 43 other universi
ties, announced last week that it
will centralize control of rate nego
tiations by reorganizing its office
of university business affairs.
The agency said it will replace
its local teams of negotiators with
a single team of experts that will
go to all 44 of the universities, a
change intended to make the nego
tiation process more uniform from
institution to institution.
The agency will also have re
gional offices report directly to the
director of the business affairs of
fice in Washington.

• Defense Contract Audit Agency
staff are calling Stanford staff
members to check up on facts in
the University's rate studies.
Agency officials have also visited
a handful of Stanford departments.
Steven Jung, a managing audi
tor in Stanford's internal audit de
partment, said the questions are
"part of [the agency's] ongoing
audit responsibility," though it
failed to do so for a number of
years in the 1980s.
"They were notable for their
absence for awhile," Jung said.
Now "they're here, they're audit
ing (and) that's the way we like it."
