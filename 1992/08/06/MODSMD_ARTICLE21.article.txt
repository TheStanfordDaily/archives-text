# Walsh's revelation: Football on the Farm
## 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
He was just cruising along Inter
state 280 in his black Porsche, on
his way to meet with San Fran
cisco 49ers head coach George Seifert
about returning to the team. But as he
passed the Stanford campus, Bill Walsh
had a revelation.
"Just like that, it came to me," he says.
A few days earlier, Walsh had been ap
proached by boosters and Athletic Direc
tor Ted Leland about taking over as head
coach of the Cardinal football team. But
the former 49ers head coach, three-time
Super Bowl mastermind and NBC foot
ball commentator was widely expected to
sign another lucrative broadcasting con
tract or rejoin his old franchise. There was
talk of him eventually moving into the
general manager position at the 49ers.
And although he had golden opportuni
ties in front of him, Walsh couldn't get
Stanford out his head as he was driving
along. It was where he got his start as a
head coach, leading the Cardinal to two
post-season bowl victories in 1977 and 78.
Thoughts began racing through his
head that January afternoon. Terry Shea,
the head coach at San Jose State, was the
piece that made the puzzle fit in his mind.
"If he could join me, we could be very
viable," Walsh reflected.
One by one, former players and assis
tants of his at the 49ers sprang to mind.
Quickly a coaching staff began to gel. And
without any begging, pleading, arm-twist
ing or very lucrative offers, Walsh decided
to return to the Farm. Just like that.
In the next couple of days, Walsh met
twice with Leland, including one late
night chat at Stickney's coffee shop.
"He was serious from the very begin
ning," recalls Leland. "It only took us an
hour and a half to hammer out his con
tract."
Later that week, Leland introduced
Walsh as Stanford's new football coach to
more than 600 giddy students, faculty,
alumni and fans.
"We were looking for Moses," one long
time fan told the San Francisco Examiner
at the ceremony, "and we got God."
Why would someone of Walsh's
caliber and accomplishments
want to return to collegiate
coaching, the minor leagues of football?
"Broadcasting was fine, but it didn't

have any intriguing qualities to it. A cer
tain humorous remark would be the only
high point of the day," reflects the 60-
year-old Walsh. "That life didn't do it for
me. This does. The coaches, the players,
there's something occurring that you di
rect all your attention to. You sacrifice,
you concentrate, you strategize, you
teach. You are part of a movement trying
to accomplish something."
And going back to the NFL in a man
agerial role, Walsh says, would not have
provided the thrill of coaching a team to
victory. "I was a person in management
and I did a satisfactory job at that, but the
basis of my interest is in coaching football.
"The college atmosphere, the people on
campus, especially the undergraduates,
are more appealing to me at this stage in
my life. There is a redeeming quality to
what I do. You're contributing to some
body's life and at the same time getting
those needs that I have fulfilled," Walsh
explains.
At the collegiate level, he says,"the
athletes are playing because they love the
game and I'm teaching because I love the
game. That's the best chemistry possi
ble."
Walsh, who signed a five-year $1.75
million contract, shrugs off rumors that
he is just using the Stanford job to land an
NFL general manager position. "I will
stay as long as I'm a viable coach and I can
contribute. There's no value in a stepping
stone at my age.
"This is what I choose to do."
Having a three-time Super Bowl
winner as a coach can be an over
whelming experience at first.
Just ask junior Steve Stenstrom, the Car
dinal's starting quarterback.
One day after practice last year, former
Cardinal coach Dennis Green introduced
Stenstrom to Walsh. The simple "Hi, I'm
Bill Walsh" line was such a memorable
moment for Stenstrom that he went
around telling his friends for days who he
had met.
Admittedly, the first weeks of spring
practice were a little awkward for the
players. "Everyone was in a sense of awe,"
says Mike Jerich, a junior offensive tack
le. "They were saying, 'Oh my God — this
is Bill Walsh', but then he just became one
of the guys."
Walsh says he is getting closer to devel
oping the kind of rapport he wants with
his players. "In the first few meetings,

when I was trying to be humorous, they
(the players) would be staring ahead, not
sure about whether to laugh or not."
Now, Walsh and many players say that
the initial formalities have been pushed
aside and they are ready to work.
"He really makes you feel comfortable.
He doesn't look at himself as a coach who
has won three Super Bowls. He treats you
as an equal, as a friend," explains Jerich.
But even though Walsh's players are
growing accustomed to his presence on
the sidelines, the local media still follows
his every move. Yesterday's opening prac
tice was attended by a horde of sports
writers and photographers, anxious to
catch a glimpse of the master in action.
While the constant spotlight can get
tiresome for Walsh, players like Glyn Mil
burn say that it takes some of the pres
sure off players like him. "All the atten
tion on him has allowed the rest of us to be
more relaxed as the season starts," he
says.
"His style makes him a good fit for
Stanford," says Leland. "Most coaches
constantly talk about toughness and
about being a man. Bill's vocabulary is dif
ferent.
"He brings a kind of a scholarly ap
proach to football."
A meticulous planner, Walsh has
been at work since he accepted
the job, setting out first to make
the coaching staff he had envisioned on
the highway a reality.
Shea, the former head coach at San
Jose State, immediately became the offen
sive coordinator. In 1990, he led the Spar
tans to a 9-2-1 record, a national ranking
and a California Bowl victory.
Walsh kept Dave Tipton and Scott
Schumann, members of Green's staff,
added former 49ers assistant Fred von
Appen as defensive coordinator and for
mer Pacific head coach Bill Singler as spe
cial teams coach.
He rounded out his staff with five for
mer 49er players: Guy Banjamain, Tom
Holmoe, Bill Ring, Keena Turner and
Mike Wilson. The combined coaching ex
perience of the five is one year — Holmoe
spent last season at Brigham Young.
But Walsh says he feels confident in
the abilities of his younger coaches. "They
bring enthusiasm and immediate experi
ence to the team. They are familiar with
my philosophy and they have been on
championship teams. They know what it
takes to win."
Milburn, a senior and team leader,
says, "What they lack in experience they
make up in their attitude toward coach
iri££.
Walsh also sees himself in a dual men
tor role, coaching players as well as his
coaches. But leading his assistants to
greatness is nothing new to him. Several
NFL coaches, including Green (now head
coach of the Minnesota Vikings), Tampa
Bay Buccaneer coach Sam Wyche and
Green Bay Packers coach Mike Holmgren
Green Bay have been Walsh protoges.
In the next three weeks, Walsh will be
running practices at an intense pace,
gearing up for a pre-season match-up
Aug. 26 against national powerhouse
Texas A&M at the Pigskin Classic in Ana
heim.
"We're treating this particular game
like a bowl game," says Walsh. "Virtually
everything we're going to be doing for the
next three weeks will be directed toward
that game."
At the team's first official practice yes
terday morning, Walsh, dressed in the
requisite cardinal and white, led his 94
players through several hours of exercises
and drills. He was always in the middle of
the action, running from one group of
players to another, interrupting his assis
tants when he wanted to add his perspec
tive or opinion.
He spends hours studying game tapes,
paying attention to the smallest details.
Every moment of each practice is planned,
every play is painstakingly scripted.
Walsh even keeps a large calendar on a
table in his office with each practice and
every game marked. Drills are penciled in
— to the minute.
The Texas A&M game "will focus the
team and will provide a severe test" for his
players, says Walsh. "But I'm hopeful

that we'll play well and it's very conceiv
able that we could win."
Although Walsh will sorely miss the
presence of star fullback Tommy Vardell,
who rushed for a school record 20 touch
downs last year, and massive offensive
lineman Bob Whitfield, the new coach
says his squad has what it takes to be com
petitive.
In fact, several pre-season magazines
have ranked the Cardinal in the top 20 na
tionally and expect the team to finish sec
ond in the Pac-10, behind Washington.
Walsh will be looking to Ail-American
candidate Milburn, a deft running back,
to provide ball-carrying power. Although
Milburn had a disappointing season last
year, Walsh remains optimistic about his
performance this fall.
"I think Glyn will be in a critical role
much as Vardell had last year, but unlike
Tommy, he'll be catching more passes and

carrying the ball to the outside," Walsh
predicts.
Stenstrom, who topped the Pac-10 in
passing efficiency as a sophomore last
year, will start at quarterback. After an
arm injury sidelined him for much of the
spring season, he is once again healthy.
"Stenstrom can be one of the top quar
terbacks in the country this year, and if he
stays well, statistically, he could be the
best," says Walsh, comparing Sten
strom's passes to those of Joe Montana.
Walsh also plans to institute some
changes in the team's playing style,
adding a "49ers touch." He wants to slim
down the offensive line and experiment
with a no-huddle of-

fense more often.
But Walsh admits that this year's team
has less depth and "big play people" than
he would like. The lack of experience at
wide receiver — with the loss of graduates
Chris Walsh and Ed Pickney — could
prove the team's obstacle to greatness
this season, says Walsh.
"If we had a player like Jerry Rice, a big
play man, then we could be really compet
itive," he says.
Of the four contenders for the receiver
position, "somebody is going to have to
catch 70 passes and the other 50. That's
an awful lot to ask from people who
haven't caught any."
He is, however, quite optimistic about
the upcoming season. "As a team this year
were as good as anybody. In the long haul
people might say that we don't have the
depth that other schools have, but in any
given game we can be very competitive,"

Walsh says.
Walsh may have already started
off on a winning note with this
year's class of freshman re
cruits, which many writers are calling one
of the best in the school's history. Of the
20 new players, seven are high school All-
Americans. Only Washington, last year's
co-national champion, is reported to have
as many top prospects.
The nation's top-rated offensive line
man, Jeff Buckey, a 6-foot-5, 290 pound
offensive lineman from Bakersfield, had
decided not to attend Stanford after
Green left. He instead planned to enroll at
either UCLA, Notre Dame or Washington
— all perennial football powerhouses. But
the day after Walsh was hired, he visited
the lineman in Southern California, and
now Buckey is wearing cardinal and

white.
Linebacker Justin Morabito had
already committed to
Notre

Dame when Walsh was hired. He too
changed his mind.
And the Cardinal even got placekicker
Eric Abrams, a Southern Californian who
was Parade magazine's high school foot
ball player of the year.
In fact, these days, Stanford can get
just about any high school player it wants
— but with a catch. They have to be good
students, too. The Cardinal lost out on Ar
mani Toomer, one of the best wide re
ceivers in the country, because his grades
were not up to Stanford's standards.
Walsh says the school needs to target
potential stars like Toomer, who is now at
Michigan, and motivate them early to dis
tinguish themselves in the classroom as
well as the field.
But he doesn't view Stanford's admis
sions requirements, the most stringent of
any Division I-A school, as hindering re
cruiting.
"It's more of a challenge for the coach
es and players, there's no question about
it," Walsh says. "But I can see us having
the quality of student-athlete that could
compete for a national championship."
For an athletic department that had
a deficit of more than $300,000 and
a $2.1 million accumulated debt
last year, getting Walsh back on the Farm
was like robbing a bank.
"A fabulous spinoff is that Bill's image
and reputation has created an excitement
that has been a financial boon to the de
partment," Leland says.
The Pigskin Classic will pay the school
nearly $600,000, according to Sports In
formation Director Gary Migdol.
Season tickets have been selling at a
hectic pace. According to director of ticket
operations Konn Rauschenbach, more
than 4,000 more full-price season tickets
have been sold compared to this time last
year. Student sales are expected to top
4,500, significantly greater than last
year's figure.
Stanford's portion of tickets for the
games at Notre Dame and California are
already sold out, the fastest sell-out of Cal
tickets in ten years.
If the school can reach the same level of
ticket sales that occurred during Walsh's
first tenure on the Farm during 1977-78,
it would translate into more than $1.5
million additional revenue per year, fig
ures Leland.
And this year's schedule, says
Rauschenbach, is not very attractive for
sales. "Wait until next year, when Notre
Dame, UCLA and Cal play on the Farm,"
she says.
Immediately after the announcement
that Walsh was taking over as coach, the
phones were "ringing off the hook" at the
ticket office, says Rauschenbach. A sepa
rate voice mail line was added to handle
the large volume of calls. Rauschenbach
says the office received about 1,600 in
quiries in the weeks after the announce
ment, and since tickets were not yet on
sale, all the names were put on a waiting
list.
The enormous success of ticket sales
even prompted one office employee to
hang a hand-drawn caricature of Walsh
and Leland standing atop a phone booth
with the caption, "Bill and Ted's Excel
lent Adventure."
The department is also seeing a rise in
donations related to Walsh's return. The
Buck-Cardinal Club, an organization of
athletic boosters, is currently running
about seven percent ahead in yearly gifts.
"That's a pretty positive sign given the
current economic situation," says Direc
tor of Annual Giving John Denney.
Money will also be reaped from the
media's fascination with Walsh's return.
The new coach's presence could entice
ABC, which has a contract to televise Pac
-10 games, to cover more Stanford games.
And cable channels such as ESPN and
Prime Ticket are vying to cover other Car
dinal games. Every televised game trans
lates into additional revenue for the pro
gram.
Migdol says the increased television in
terest is "directly related to Bill Walsh."
And a new radio contract has also been
finalized which will pay the school signifi
cantly more than the approximately
$190,000 it received in 1991. Athletic de
partment officials decided to switch from
KCBS to Magic-61 to get a station "that

will talk about Stanford all the time," says
Leland. Because of its 24-hour news for
mat, KCBS was unable to do that, he
notes.
According to Leland, plans are also in
the works for a national Stanford radio
network; the school currently has 30 sta
tions lined up in several major markets.
"We have a national athletic program,"
says Leland. "Bill just brings national
prominence to the football program."
In the past few years, the athletic de
partment, faced with a revenue shortfall,
instituted administrative reductions sim
ilar to other University departments. But
Leland, who took the helm of the depart
ment last year, was determined not to
compromise the breadth of Stanford's
programs. And while programs like swim
ming, tennis and gymnastics garner na
tional championships, they do not gener
ate revenue. A money-generating football
program was needed to sustain the de
partment.
"People have been saying you can't sus
tain this athletic program, it's too big, too
ambitious. But I think we can. Bill's pres
ence will help us do that," Leland argues.
What about a Rose Bowl appear
ance, something the Cardinal
faithful have wanted for the
past 20 years, since their last appearance

in the 1972 season?
"Stanford is more able and capable of
being a Rose Bowl school than we were a
few years ago," Walsh says.
He won't put a timetable on a trip to
Pasadena or talk of when Stanford will
win a national championship, only saying
that it might be a distinct possibility in
the near future.
Going to another bowl game this year is
much more likely, speculates Walsh.
"There are so many bowl games out there
that you can hardly miss if you win more
(games) than you lose."
However, these days Walsh is think
ing only toward the immediate future
and his first collegiate game in 14
years.
He feels the pressure and the expecta
tion to continue his winning tradition at
Stanford, but says much of the pressure is
self-inflicted.
"I can't do the job any other way," he
say 8.
But whether he's sitting in his modest
office on a slow Saturday afternoon or
walking the sidelines during practice,
there's a certain content look on his face.
One can tell he's enjoying what he's
doing.
Perhaps he expressed his feelings best
back in January when he accepted the job,
stating simply, "This is my bliss."
