## Continued success as Olympics roll on

day in her best event, the 200 but
terfly. She trailed entering the last
leg of the race, but with 25 meters
to go pulled ahead of China's Xiao
hong Wang. Her victory margin
was .43 seconds, and after the race
Sanders told an interviewer that
she had been lucky to be able to
finish on stroke and to punch the
timer quickly. However, the swim
mer smiled all the way to the
medal stand, where she completed
a full set of individual medals.
Sanders did not say if she will com
pete in the 1996 Games.
Jeff Rouse's experiences
matched those of Sanders. Canadi
an Mark Tewksbury upset the world
record-holder in Thursday's 100
backstroke. Rouse was just .06 sec
onds behind Tewksbuiy's Olympic
best time. But the following day the
backstroker lowered his own world
record with a 53.86 second swim in
the men's 4 x 100 medley relay.
Pablo Morales also helped swim the
team to a gold — and a tie for the
world record — in a time 0f3:36.93.
A happy ending was in store for
Janet Evans, who was visibly shaken
when she took a silver in the 400
freestyle. But her tears after Thurs
day's 800 free were happy ones. The
1988 three-time gold medalist domi
nated the pool on the way to her first
Barcelona gold. Evans became only
the second American woman to win
four gold medals. She hinted that
her racing days were probably over.
The long run
Long distance runner PattiSue
Plumer represented early hopes
for a Stanford track-and-field
medal, but injuries hindered her

Swift strokes and speedy sprints
all contributed to a collection of Car
dinal medals in the past week, and
more may come in track-and-field
and team play during the final days
of the Games. Among last week's
standouts were six Stanford swim
mers who turned in gold-medal per
formances. But expectations have
been upset along the way — as ex
emplified by U.S. losses yesterday in
baseball and water polo.
Slippery when wet
Swimmers comprised the
strongest group of Stanford ath
letes at the Games. Jenny Thomp
son led the way Thursday when she
and Lea Loveless helped the U.S. 4
x 100-meter-medley relay team
break a world record in 4:02.54. It
was Thompson's second relay gold,
and her third medal.
It was also her last. Yang Wenyi
of China broke her own world
record time in 27.49 seconds dur
ing the 50 freestyle on Friday, the
last day of swimming. Thompson
placed fifth.
Summer Sanders entered the
Games as a favorite to win multi
ple gold medals but earned only a
bronze in early events. Then, last
Thursday, Lin Li of China cracked
the world record for the 200 indi
vidual medley and Sanders got a
silver. She did pick up a gold that
day, but just as an alternate in the
medley relay.
But individual golden glory fi
nally came Sanders' way the next

efforts in the 3000-meter race.
The 30-year-old Palo Alto attor
ney, who in 1990 was the world's
top-ranked female runner, was in
severe pain and placed fifth in
Sunday's event. After finishing
she sprawled on the track and
clutched her left leg, wincing in
agony as her teammates gathered
around her. Plumer's physical dif
ficulties stem from a back injury
caused by a 1987 car crash.
However, Plumer qualified yes
terday for Saturday's 1500-meter
race, which features tough interna
tional competition. Stanford's Regi
na Jacobs will also run in that event.
Bad to the bone
The Barcelona Baldies were
known as the U.S. men's volleyball
team until they shaved their heads in
protest of an International Volley
ball Federation decision that gave
Japan a win on a technical violation.

The team was 4-1 entering the quar
terfinals, having beaten world cham
pion Italy on Monday. Team captain
Scott Fortune, when asked what
might happen if the team dropped
another match, said "Maybe we'll
shave our entire bodies."
That didn't happen yesterday,
as the U.S. picked up a victory over
the Unified Team and a ticket to
tomorrow's semifinals against
Brazil. The Americans are looking
to become the first volleyball team
to win three straight golds. The
volleyball finals are Sunday.
The U.S. water polo team, with
Eric Fischer and Craig Klass,
dropped a 3-1 lead and was upset 8-
5 yesterday by the Unified Team.
The U.S., which hopes for a gold,
needs to beat or tie Germany today
in order to stay in the hunt. The
Americans finished second in the
last two Olympics to Yugoslavia,
which is not competing in team

sports this year because of the po
litical upheaval in that country.
Blue moon
"We have nothing to show for
this but fond memories," said a dis
appointed Jeffrey Hammonds after
an 8-3 loss to Japan in yesterday's
bronze medal game. He scored once
and went 2-for-4 with a double and
an RBI. In Sunday's 7-1 loss Ham
monds, who accounted for almost a
third of American hit totals this
week, hit a solo home run.
All right now
Hammonds and other Stanford
athletes will return home next Sun
day. Some will have medals, and
some will not. Although some Card
athletes will be disappointed with
their performances at the Games, all
will have benefitted from their time
in Barcelona. The thrill of competi
tion, after all, is what it's all about.

It took Summer Sanders longer than expected, but she finally got the individual gold medal which she
came to Barcelona for. Sanders won the 200-meter butterfly and afterwards she embraced her coach,
Stanford's own Richard Quick.
