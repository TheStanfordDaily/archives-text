# NOSE TO NOSE
## How should we choose who goes for gold? 
### 
Dan O'Brien did not make the U.S.
Olympic team. Carl Lewis barely did, as did
Hetty Okino.
This is what is wrong and right with the
system the United States uses to determine
its Olympians. In most sports, Olympians
are determined at the Trials, a one-time-

only, top-two-or-three
advance, thanks-for
your-effort-but-what-
have-you-done-for-me-
lately competition.
There are no second
chances and no consid
erations of past perfor
mance in the Olympic
selection process.
Imagine if applying
to colleges were this dif
ficult. I now give you a
scene at the Office of
Admissions:
"Dean Olympictrials,
look at this young stu-

dent. She has a 4.0 GPA, was an All-American
in three sports and has made guest cello per
formances with the Cleveland Symphony."
"What was her SAT score?"
"Only 1200, but she had typhoid fever at
the time, and she had to walk through a bliz
zard to take it. If she took them again. .
"She may not take them again! You
know the rules. One SAT test, top 1500 get
in. No exceptions.''

Not a pretty sight, is it? This is the same
thing that happened to O'Brien and Lewis.
O'Brien is the reigning world champion
in the decathlon. Due to a slight tactical
mistake in the Trials, he will not be com
peting in Barcelona.
Lewis is track and field's demigod. World

record-holder (set just
last year) in the 100 me
ters, one of the greatest
sprinters in history, and
anchor of two gold
medal-winning U.S.
relay teams. He was
slightly ill at the Trials,
and so he failed to quali
fy for the U.S. team in
any of the above events.
Betty Okino is testa
ment to how Olympic
teams should be picked.
She was hurt for the
Olympic Gymnastics
Trials. However, the

team was not picked solely on the basis of
Trials performance. The top six Trials per
formers, plus Okino and one other athlete,
went to a special pre-Olympic camp, at which
the six-woman team was chosen. Okino
went to Barcelona, where she finished 12th
in the all-around. Betty Okino was one of the
12 best gymnasts in the world.
Surely Carl and Dan could do even bet
ter than that.

Dan is a commentator at the Olympics.
Carl is competing in the long jump and fill
ing in on the 4xloo relay. So what?
The Olympics are the ultimate competi
tion because athletes from all countries are
going head-to-head to prove who's the best
in the world. Everybody gets one chance,

one shot, to be the best.
Why should the Tri
als be any different?
Sean, your SAT anal
ogy is cute, but it's also
not a good parallel.
The SAT is a bad mea
sure of how well a stu
dent will do in college. It
has gender and cultural
biases built into it and it
weeds out great students
who do poorly on stan
dardized tests. Using the
SAT as the sole consider
ation for college admis
sion would be ludicrous.

But the Olympic Trials are no SAT.
They are a fabulous measure of how an a
athlete will do in his or her Olympic event.
Why? Because the athlete has to perform
that same event at the Trials.
Take Dan O'Brien. His "slight tactical
mistake" at the Trials was a complete in
ability to pole vault. He was not ready to
perform well in all of the decathlon's
events. Sure, he may be the best nonathlon

competitor in the world, but they have to do
ten events in Barcelona — one more than
Dan can do.
Carl Lewis? Puh-leeze. He's over-the
hill, as he proved at the Trials with his sixth
place finish in the 100 meters. If Lewis was
still as great as his reputation, he would

have earned a spot, not
needed one as a gift.
And as for Betty
Okino, she is a great
gymnast — nobody is
doubting that. But this
"special pre-Olympic
camp" was nothing
more than Okino's
coach, Be la Karolyi, rail
roading her onto the
team. Bela is the com
manding force in U.S.
women's gymnastics,
and he created the spe
. cial camp for the sole
purpose of getting Okino

onto a team on which she didn't belong.
I'm glad you enjoyed watching Okino so
much, Sean. But don't forget that she took
someone else's place on the Olympic team.
Some young girl who earned her way to
Barcelona at the Trials sat at home while
Okino went instead, just because Okino's
coach was powerful enough to cheat her
onto the team.
Now that sounds fair, doesn't it?
