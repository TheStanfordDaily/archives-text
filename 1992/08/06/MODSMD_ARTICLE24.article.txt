hancing space, art has

many other unique abilities

Obviously art can transform plain

regions into areas of interest, but the value of art is
not its aesthetic appeal alone. Some art exists just to
tantalize the eyes while other works may elicit emo
tion from the viewer. Art is adept at establishing a
mood.
Art is also a window into the lives, feelings and cul
tures of other people. It allows one to travel into the
past, visit other societies and make treks into the
imagination of an individual.
Visiting the large metropolitan museums is not
necessary to get a sense of other people through art.

Palo Alto has several local galleries

and exhibition halls dedicated to

showing a variety of works and ex

panding the community's appre
ciation of fine art.

The Palo Alto Cultural
Center is one such
place. This non-profit
organization is responsible

for advancing many as
pects of culture into the

Palo Alto community
with fine arts as a pri-

Mary focus.
The gallery at the

cultural center con
sists of three exhibi

tion halls featuring

independent

shows changed

approximately

every three
months. Cur

rently two ex
hibits are

available for
public view
ing.

The City of Palo Alto

permanent collection, administered

by the Cultural Center, recently received a gift

of 31 prints. The addition becomes part of one of the
most extensive two-dimensional collections held by
U.S. cities of similar size.
All but one of the prints were produced at Smith
Anderson Editions, a Palo Alto press founded as a
fine art etching press by one of the collaborative
donors.
Presented as "New Acquisitions from Smith An
derson Editions," the donated artwork empha
sizes the monotype medium long advocated by the
press's founder.

The prints represent the work of many artists and

have been prepared by a master printer in associ

ation with the artist at the press. The selections

are quite diverse. Some rely on the impact of

drastic shape and color while others are more

subdued and require greater patience to ab

sorb the effect of the piece.

Also at the Palo Alto Cultural Cen
ter is a collection of artwork titled "pART

nership:Cubberley Studio Artists," com

prised of juried selections from the works

of local artists at the Cubberley Studio.

The 20 featured artists utilize a vast

array of media, including photogra

phy, pastel, oil, watercolor, ink,
and acrylic.

Two-dimensional
artwork appears not only
on traditional surfaces but
also on steel, wool and rag. Sev

eral three-dimensional pieces are
nstructed of materials including

wood, paper, wax, metal and sand

Instead of fine art, a few of these artists pro

duce fine crafts. Among these selections are

ornate weavings and decorative clothing.
Although still functional, these works

approach the line between art and
craft, media versus form and function.

Previously a school, the Cubberley

Studio classrooms were converted
for the use of artists in the com
munity. But education continues
through the cultural center's
Project Look which provides an i
opportunity for local children
to experience many forms of
art on a regular basis.
The Palo Alto Cultural Cen
ter allows members of the com
munity to er\joy art and experience

a variety of works. Besides operating class

es for adults and maintaining

the city's collection,
the cultural center
is committed to

continually pro
viding quality
contemporary
art for viewing.
Another local
gallery open
to the public

at no cost is the Syntex
Gallery. Located within a

high-tech corporate com

plex in Palo Alto, the

gallery serves to show art

work of a less traditional and

more experimental nature.
The exhibit currently on

display, "To Fool the Eye," focus

es on illusion. Most of the works in

volve the nature of deception in gen

erating an image of reality. Others

are simply imaginative and filled with
fantasy.

Many of the paintings attempt to re

move the plane of the canvas and create

a window into the world beyond. Appar

ent spatial incongruities and seemingly inter

twined planes make the works enjoyable to solve.

Some of the works have been artificially aged, with
cracks and tears painted over what appears to be a
fading ancient mural suffering from the abuses of
time.

Three-dimensionality is also successfully created
by painting around the edge of the main canvas plane
onto the sides of the wrapped canvas. With this tech
nique, an impressively realistic painting of window
blinds almost begs for a window behind it.

In conjunction with real

lighting, false shadows

play a tremendous role

in a tricky piece that

makes some facial

features appear to

hover in front of

the remainder

of the por

trait.

The true

three-di

mensional

pieces are also

excellent.

Columns and

pedestals apparently

sculpted of authentic

materials like granite,

limestone and black dia

mond are actually wood with

a veneer of mixed media. Tile frag

ments look as if they were pulled up from a

Renaissance courtyard.
An antique desk set complete with

chair and wastebasket tests the eye's ability

to identify the painted features among the pre

sent objects and actual wear.
While not inciting great emotion or awe, the ex
hibit provides an enjoyable experience. It will cer
tainly make any visitor more aware of artists' abili
ties to mimic reality and even wary of their applica
tion in the real world.

Expert at en

hancing space, art has

many other unique abilities

Obviously art can transform plain

regions into areas of interest, but the value of art is
not its aesthetic appeal alone. Some art exists just to
tantalize the eyes while other works may elicit emo
tion from the viewer. Art is adept at establishing a
mood.
Art is also a window into the lives, feelings and cul
tures of other people. It allows one to travel into the
past, visit other societies and make treks into the
imagination of an individual.
Visiting the large metropolitan museums is not
necessary to get a sense of other people through art.

Palo Alto has several local galleries

and exhibition halls dedicated to

showing a variety of works and ex

panding the community's appre
ciation of fine art.

The Palo Alto Cultural
Center is one such
place. This non-profit
organization is responsible

for advancing many as
pects of culture into the

Palo Alto community
with fine arts as a pri-

Mary focus.
The gallery at the

cultural center con
sists of three exhibi

tion halls featuring

independent

shows changed

approximately

every three
months. Cur

rently two ex
hibits are

available for
public view
ing.

The City of Palo Alto

permanent collection, administered

by the Cultural Center, recently received a gift

of 31 prints. The addition becomes part of one of the
most extensive two-dimensional collections held by
U.S. cities of similar size.
All but one of the prints were produced at Smith
Anderson Editions, a Palo Alto press founded as a
fine art etching press by one of the collaborative
donors.
Presented as "New Acquisitions from Smith An
derson Editions," the donated artwork empha
sizes the monotype medium long advocated by the
press's founder.

The prints represent the work of many artists and

have been prepared by a master printer in associ

ation with the artist at the press. The selections

are quite diverse. Some rely on the impact of

drastic shape and color while others are more

subdued and require greater patience to ab

sorb the effect of the piece.

Also at the Palo Alto Cultural Cen
ter is a collection of artwork titled "pART

nership:Cubberley Studio Artists," com

prised of juried selections from the works

of local artists at the Cubberley Studio.

The 20 featured artists utilize a vast

array of media, including photogra

phy, pastel, oil, watercolor, ink,
and acrylic.

Two-dimensional
artwork appears not only
on traditional surfaces but
also on steel, wool and rag. Sev

eral three-dimensional pieces are
nstructed of materials including

wood, paper, wax, metal and sand

Instead of fine art, a few of these artists pro

duce fine crafts. Among these selections are

ornate weavings and decorative clothing.
Although still functional, these works

approach the line between art and
craft, media versus form and function.

Previously a school, the Cubberley

Studio classrooms were converted
for the use of artists in the com
munity. But education continues
through the cultural center's
Project Look which provides an i
opportunity for local children
to experience many forms of
art on a regular basis.
The Palo Alto Cultural Cen
ter allows members of the com
munity to er\joy art and experience

a variety of works. Besides operating class

es for adults and maintaining

the city's collection,
the cultural center
is committed to

continually pro
viding quality
contemporary
art for viewing.
Another local
gallery open
to the public

at no cost is the Syntex
Gallery. Located within a

high-tech corporate com

plex in Palo Alto, the

gallery serves to show art

work of a less traditional and

more experimental nature.
The exhibit currently on

display, "To Fool the Eye," focus

es on illusion. Most of the works in

volve the nature of deception in gen

erating an image of reality. Others

are simply imaginative and filled with
fantasy.

Many of the paintings attempt to re

move the plane of the canvas and create

a window into the world beyond. Appar

ent spatial incongruities and seemingly inter

twined planes make the works enjoyable to solve.

Some of the works have been artificially aged, with
cracks and tears painted over what appears to be a
fading ancient mural suffering from the abuses of
time.

Three-dimensionality is also successfully created
by painting around the edge of the main canvas plane
onto the sides of the wrapped canvas. With this tech
nique, an impressively realistic painting of window
blinds almost begs for a window behind it.

In conjunction with real

lighting, false shadows

play a tremendous role

in a tricky piece that

makes some facial

features appear to

hover in front of

the remainder

of the por

trait.

The true

three-di

mensional

pieces are also

excellent.

Columns and

pedestals apparently
