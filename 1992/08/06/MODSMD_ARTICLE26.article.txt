"Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" is no ray of
sunshine in a summer overcast with disap
pointing movies.
While genuinely amusing at times, this
movie squanders a great opportunity to
spoof horror films and the classic tales of
vampires.
The most obvious problem with "Buffy
the Vampire Slayer" is its attempt at re
spectability. This film would have had great
success just mocking monster movies.
Instead the film tries to be suspenseful,
scary and dramatic while simultaneously
being a romantic comedy. Unfortunately,
neither goal is attained, and the result is a
generally unsatisfying movie.
Set in Southern California, "BufTy the
Vampire Slayer" relies on inane Valley girls
and high school jock lunkheads to provide
humor that moviegoers have already seen
too many times.
Kristy Swanson stars as Buffy, the
stereotypical witless blond cheerleader with
a supposedly cool boyfriend and a clique of
snobby yet ever-so-popular mall girls. Des
tined to be the heroine, this product of pop
culture finds herself confronted with a re
sponsibility she initially refuses to accept
but later grasps with newfound zeal and ma
turity.
Tragically, the characters played by big
names remain largely undeveloped. Direc
tor Fran Rubel Kuzui seems to have diffi
culty establishing a purpose for the plot and
mood for the characters.
Donald Sutherland is very bland as Mer
rick, whose timeless duty is to transform the
chosen one (in this case Buffy) into the next
vampire slayer.
Training slayers for centuries has appar
ently taken its toll on Merrick. He plods
through his chore without emotion or en
thusiasm.
The incomprehensibly limited role of the
villain Lothos is played by Rutger Hauer. He
looks quite menacing but the audience
rarely sees him.
When he does appear, his behavior is con
fused. In one scene he seems dearth and
ruthless and in the next light and sympa
thetic.
Better known for his Big Adventure as
Pee Wee Herman, Paul Reubens is the only
highlight in the movie. He portrays Amilyn,
Lothos' right hand vampire.
Enjoying his perverse lifestyle, the cer
tainly demented Amilyn secures the atten
tion of the audience with his radical behav
ior and strange antics. The best scenes in
the film belong to Reubens and his brand of
humor.
Luke Perry of "Beverly Hills 90210"
fame makes his film debut as Pike, a rebel
lious outsider falling in love with the new,
fierce Buffy. The spirit-sipping high school
burnout Pike is willing to accept Buffy's
mission and stand by her side, even if he is
of little help.
Although it isn't much of a stretch for
him, Perry is convincing in his role as a
deadbeat reformed by love.
The film's title alone creates anticipa
tion of comedy and almost demands an ab
sence of seriousness. But "Buffy the Vam
pire Slayer" is instead a ridiculous ro
mance, with humor only coming sporadi
cally.

And Hawn's Helen Sharp, Madeline's
lifelong rival who has also taken the myste
rious potion, sports a flawless hole in her
mid-section, courtesy of a shotgun blast
from Madeline.
But if you've seen the previews, you've
seen just about everything worthwhile in
"Death Becomes Her." Screenwriters Mar
tin Donovan and David Koepp take eons to
set up a bitchy rivalry between Madeline
and Helen, but with two scenery-devouring
actors like Streep and Hawn, it's a waste of
time. Cut to the catfight between the living
dead already. . ..
Ironically, once the film finally reaches
that point, it hurries past it toward a high
handed, preachy conclusion pitting vanity
against acceptance of mortality as the
women try to get Menville to take the po
tion so he can repair their cracking and
peeling bodies forever.
But by this point, the costs of maintain
ing a body forever have become so ridicu
lously high, it would be ludicrous to expect
Menville to give in. The film's moralistic
coda rings false and contrived.
In the movie's middle section, however,
a few entertaining moments not contained
in the previews do emerge. Sydney Pollack,

as the doctor who first examines the de
ceased but animate Madeline, practically
steals the film with his deadpan diagnosis
of her condition.
Perhaps the biggest problem with
"Death Becomes Her" is the complete
waste of its stars' talent. Streep especially
shows a definite flair for comedy, but except
for the scene where she buys the potion
from an exotic and scantily clad beauty (Is
abella Rossellini), even her evil qualities
aren't endearing enough to keep the audi
ence interested in her fate.
Like Madeline, Hawn's Helen is also
two-dimensional, and while having such
plastic characters drives home the point of
the film, it sure doesn't make for engaging
cinema.
And Willis' tame Menville is a character
barely worth having in the film. He's only
there, it seems, to serve as the women's ob
ject of contention and as the good to their
evil in the finale.
Although all three roles are nearly per
fectly cast, the writing and Robert Zemeck
is' direction throw away the opportunity to
finally offer a film that transcends its pre
views.
