"Death Becomes Her"
Give the summer movie season an A for
consistency.
Yet again, a film has failed to live up to its
own advance publicity, with the trailer re
vealing all that's worth seeing in the movie.
This time the culprit is "Death Becomes
Her," a mildly amusing black comedy star
ring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce
Willis.
Streep plays Madeline Ashton, an aging
actress who, in her quest for lost beauty,
takes a potion offering eternal youth.
But an unfortunate side effect of the
tonic arises when Madeline is killed by her
weenie of a husband, plastic surgeon Ernest
Menville (Willis). Although she is immortal,
her body is technically dead, and she's
forced to walk around in a decaying shell.
As promised in the teasers, special ef
fects highlight the dead Madeline scenes,
with her broken neck flopping and spinning
in chillingly hysterical fashion.
