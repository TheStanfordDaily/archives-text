"The Hairdresser's Husband "
Under a cerulean sky, a gang of young
French boys sporting Speedo-esque swim
ming trunks attempt to build a dam of sand
perpendicular to the seashore.
A thin freshet nullifies their efforts and
causes all but one boy, young Antoine, to give
up on the task.
Although his enthusiastic shoveling ac
complishes nothing, little Antoine does not
give up. Instead he flags down a nearby trac
tor driver and enlists him to plug up the
freshet.
Unfortunately, this simple scene, which so
beautifully depicts Antoine's determination,
is about as meaningful as Patrice Leconte's
"The Hairdresser's Husband (La Coiffeuse)"
ever gets.
The plot begins with 12-year-old Antoine
discovering at Madame Shaeffer's, the town
hairdresser, just how stimulating a good
shampoo can be.
After sneaking a peek at her partially ex
posed breast on one of his all-too-frequent
hair appointments, Antoine vows to marry a
hairdresser.
Yet "The Hairdresser's Husband" makes
no effort to explain why Antoine carries this
strange obsession into later life. If Leconte
had opted for stressing the absurdity of it all
through comedy in place of wasting precious
movie hours attempting to arouse the audi
ence, the film might have been entertaining.
For the remainder of "The Hairdresser's
Husband," Antoine (Jean Rochefort) and
Mathilde (Anna Galiena), the hairdresser he
meets at age 40-something and marries in a
New York minute, spend countless days hav
ing intercourse, seeing clients and digitally
stimulating each other while seeing clients.
From then on, "The Hairdresser's Hus
band" plateaus into an hour or so of their un
bearably claustrophobic love affair. For 10
years of carnal marriage, the two of them ven
ture outside the salon a total of two times.
Even worse, "The Hairdresser's Hus
band" culminates in the only way a meaning
less film with two-dimensional characters can
— that is, via the death of a main character.
If it weren 't for the highly entertaining vis
its of Mathilde's more intriguing clients —
such as Little Edouard, the juvenile terror —
"The Hairdresser's Husband" would speedily
spiral down to the realm of Nyquil-couldn't
put-you-to-sleep-faster. Instead, it plummets
several feet, rises a few, then plummets again.
Leconte does succeed at enhancing
Madame Shaeffer's and Mathilde's sensuali
ty with close-ups and plenty of body part
shots. However, scant comedy and profuse
eroticism do not a movie make.
