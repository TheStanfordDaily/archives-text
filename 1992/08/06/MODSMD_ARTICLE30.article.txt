# Legendary star's films come to the Stanford
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Editorial staff 
With "She Done Him Wrong"
and "Bringing Up Baby" this
weekend, the Stanford Theatre be
gins its two-month festival of Gary
Grant films.
Such notable titles as "Topper,"
in which Grant plays a ghost
haunting his former banker, "His
Girl Friday" with its lightning-fast
repartee and the Hitchcock thriller
"North by Northwest" are among
the 36 films to be showcased dur
ing the celebration.
As is usual for the non-profit
Theatre, dedicated to the preserva
tion and showing of classic films,
the Cary Grant festival offers
unique opportunities to view rare
prints of films previously suffering
from deterioration.
"This is the Night," Grant's
first feature film, is one such print,
preserved by the UCLA Film
Archive and on loan to the Stan
ford Theatre.
In addition, the Film Archive
recently restored "Holiday," star
ring Grant and Katherine Hep
burn, and the Theatre will present
its first showing of this new print
in mid-September.
Grant's two Academy Award

nominated performances, "Penny
Serenade" and "None But the
Lonely Heart," will also be shown.
Like many prolific actors of his
day, Grant also starred in a few
films markedly different from his
larger body of work.
In "Night and Day," Grant
plays legendary composer Cole
Porter, even singing the classic
tune "You're the Top." He also
showcases his singing voice in
"Suzy," where he portrays a
French pilot.
The Stanford Theatre will also
try to introduce the work of the
great 1920s silent film star Busier
Keaton to a wider audience.
Every Wednesday, a Keaton
film will be shown, accompanied by
an organist on the Theatre's
"mighty Wurlitzer," which rises
from the theater's orchestra pit.
While mainstream audiences
may think of silent films as melo
dramatic and quaint, Keaton's
"The General," for example, is just
as exciting as many of today's ac
tion features.
In an effort to attract more pa
trons to the Wednesday night
Keaton features, the Stanford
Theatre will show one of his silent
shorts before many of its Saturday
and Sunday Cary Grant films.
