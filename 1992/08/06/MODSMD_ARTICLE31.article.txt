# Editor's Notebook
## 
### 
Perhaps this week's editor's
notebook should be reti
tled "Believe It or Not" in
honor of some of the strange go
ings-on in the world of enter
tainment.
First is the report that Maria
Maples debuted this week on
Broadway in the Tony Award
winning "The Secret Garden."
Rumors persist that fiance Don
ald Trump got her the role, but
Maples and the show's produc
ers deny he had any sway.

And Macauley Culkin is set to
star as the Prince in a screen ver
sion of Tchaikovsky's "The Nut
cracker." Seems the million-dol
lar boy studied at the American
School of Ballet, which is affiliat
ed with the New York Ballet, the
company performing in the film.
To top it all off, superstar
Michael Jackson recently pre
vented a man from committing
suicide by waving at him. The
man had threatened to throw
himself from a window ledge un
less the gloved one made an ap
pearance.
Not as unbelievable, but cer
tainly still strange, is the an
nouncement from Turner
Broadcasting of a new cable
channel, joining 24-hour news,
music videos and comedy.
It's the Cartoon Network, of
fering 24-hour-a-day cartoons.
.. .On a more genuinely dis
turbing note, Hollywood's at
tempt to make more films with
female leads has started to take
a troublesome turn.

Apparently the only way a
film can show a "strong" female
character is by having her ter
rorized by a man. This weekend
both "Whispers in the Dark" and
"Raising Cain" feature women
stalked by psychotic men.
Add that to the converse —
psycho woman preys on men, as
in "Basic Instinct" — and you
don't get a very pretty picture of
what it's like to be a woman in
the cinematic world.
.. .Ice-T recently announced
he would pull the controversial
song "Cop Killer" off his "Body
Count" album after protests
that the song promoted violence
against police officers.
While I don't doubt the sin
cerity of the rapper's gesture
(which includes distributing the
single for free), I'll bet that sales
of "Body Count" with the song
have picked up considerably
since the announcement.
. . .On Monday, the first
round of the 17th Annual San
Francisco International Stand-
Up Comedy Competition will
begin at the Punchline in San
Francisco.
This year's competition fea
tures a strong South Bay repre
sentation. Round One, featur
ing half of the 40-comic field,
will be hosted by last year's win
ner and Stanford alum Don
McMillan.
And "cut night," the last per
formance before 10 semifinal
ists are chosen, will take place at
the South Bay's own Rooster T.
Feathers on Aug. 16 (Round
One) and Aug. 23 (Round Two).

Chris Shuttlesworth, The Weekly's
entertainment editor, saw the fi
nals of the 14th S.F. Comedy Com
petition — believe it or not.
