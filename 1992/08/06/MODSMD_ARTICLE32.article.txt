# Four jazz greats equal one musical force
## 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
This Friday evening the Stanford Workshop Con
cert Series will define "musical tour de force" as four
stylishly versatile jazzmen playing together in tradi
tional quartet format.
Throughout their careers, Jimmy Heath, brother
Albert "Tootie" Heath, Ray Drummond and Kenny
Barron have collaborated with many of jazz's most
visible personalities in a variety of capacities, includ
ing composers, arrangers, band and combo leaders,
and sidemen.
After devoting 40 years of his life to jazz as a musi
cian, composer and teacher, it is difficult to imagine
what saxophonist Jimmy Heath may attempt as an
encore.
He has played with practically every jazz great
under the sun, performed on well over 75 record al
bums and taught jazz studies at a variety of college
campuses and programs including City College of
New York and Jazzmobile. He also holds a professor
ship at Queens College.
Maybe jazz musicians follow the music's unwrit
ten rules too closely. One demands that musicians in
volve themselves in as many different music-related
activities as can possibly be tolerated.
This explains why Professor Barron of Rutgers
University's Mason Gross School of the Arts is a re
spected instructor, composer and pianist.
A professional sideman since high school, Barron,
like Jimmy Heath, has played with many of jazz's
most memorable icons, including Dizzy Gillespie,
Ron Carter and Stan Getz. He has also kept busy
recording and touring with his own quintet.
Drummer Tootie Heath is another talent to be
showcased Friday night. The youngest of the Heath
brothers has just as impressive a side-list as the other
members of the all-star quartet.
Heath has also involved himself in a variety of video
and film productions including the film "Jo Jo Dancer"
and the CBS television series, "Frank's Place."
His devotion to jazz and young musicians prompt
ed him to form Albert Tootie Heath Productions, Inc.,
a clearing house of sorts for booking, concert produc
tion and jazz promotion.
While bassist Drummond has said, "When I solo,
I'm not always easy to follow," it's doubtful that his
musical presence will confound his compatriots.

Instead, it's extremely likely that any personal in
tensity the sought-after musician brings to the stage
will only embellish the quartet's presentations.
He has sided with Bobby Hutcherson, Wynton
Marsalis, Betty Carter and many other talented mu
sicians and voÂ«dists. Essentially a self-taught musi
cian, Drummond developed a hearty appetite for jazz
at an early age, receiving most of his training on the
bandstand from more seasoned musicians.
An accomplished touring and recording artist,
Drummond completes the quartet with competent flair
and intensity, promising a true tour de force, jazz style.

Jimmy Heath, Kenny Barron, Ray Drummond and
Tootie Heath perform Friday at Bp.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. For tickets call 725-ARTS.
