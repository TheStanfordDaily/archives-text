## Column A model of tolerance

Before coming to Stanford, I
had been under the impres
sion that here was my great
est opportunity to engage in what
is termed a 'liberal education.'
The fact that such an education
gave one the opportunity to ex
plore such a breadth of fields in
academia was one of the rea
sons that I chose to attend univer
sity here rather than in England,
as had been my initial intention.
For a 17-year-old with little
clue as to what he wanted to do at
university let alone after it, the
freedom one has in these United
States in determining one's
was extremely attractive.
As much as all of this, Stanford
promised to challenge all of the as
sumptions by which I had, to that
point, led my life.
(I think it actually says that
somewhere in the "Stanford
Today" manual. .. .)
However, I was unaware at the
time of the spread of the much
vaunted multicultural approach
to education that was taking place
in this country, and of Stanford's
position at the forefront of this at
tempt to radically alter traditional
Western approaches to education.
In his last in-dorm speech at
Branner Hall, President Kennedy
announced that one of the suc
cesses of multiculturalism was to
create an open-dorm environment
where people were able to discuss
previously sensitive questions of
race and religion, as well as the
rote stuff of politics.
But, unless my dorm experi
ence to date has somehow been
way out of step with the norm, it
seems that the people discussing
these issues are rarely disagreeing
or attempting to gain insight into
one another's position, but rather
tend to vehemently agree on the
topic in question.
The reason for this, in my opin
ion, is that during the course of
their average freshman year of
Multicultural Education, anyone
who happens to disagree with the
generally left-leaning agenda of the
University decides that it is proba
bly not worth mentioning that they
were ever to the right of center.
I remember sitting down to
what I had expected to be a quiet
lunch when a young woman pro
ceeded to explain why no one
should buy Domino's pizza, be
cause the top management was, of
all abominable things, pro-life.
At the time I was having
enough trouble negotiating my
way around the campus, let alone
the subtleties of American buzz
politics, and so I said, perhaps a
little naively, "Well, what's wrong
with being pro-life?"
After all, it was just a position
some people held, right?
Wrong. For my troubles, the
person in question and half the
rest of the table proceeded to lec
ture me at length on the evils of
pro-lifers. So much for a quiet
lunch.
Well, I'd been Educated, and
made a mental note not to men
tion the words pro-life again.
At the end of the year, the sister
of a certain dorm member came to
visit Stanford.
The dorm member in question
had already gained some notoriety
for his outspoken conservative
views, and somehow the rest of
the dorm got wind of the fact that
his sister had the same dangerous
political leanings.
As I walked past her brother's
room with a couple of friends, we
spied her talking to some other
dorm members. One of my friends
turned to the other and said, "My
God, that's her! Did you know she's
a Republican ? Isn't that awful?"
I wonder what she thought of
our tolerant dorm, with its accep
tance of diverse opinions.

And as for our discussions on
race, I think the most enlightened
that discourse ever got was when
one of our resident assistants in
formed a friend that he should no
longer refer to himself as simply
American, but rather as Cau
casian American.
We wondered if he had tem
porarily taken leave of his senses
â€” but no, he was serious.
This overly sensitized formula
tion of discussions of race made
their occurrence extremely rare.
Which is not to say that stereo
types and racist opinions did not
exist within the dorm.
Far from it. I realized this the
moment, or rather several mo
ments, that various people in the
dorm decided to make wisecracks
about terrorists at my expense.
It didn't take too high an IQ to
correlate the direction of terrorist
comments to my person and my
status as the only Arab in the
dorm. But the most unfortunate
thing is that the jokes weren't
even funny.
Oh, well. I was still glad that
these issues were open to discus
sion in our exploratory dorm envi
ronment.
And the list goes on.
It is my sincerest belief that
this stifled environment, where
people feel unable to express any
opinion that differs from the polit
ically correct, results directly from
the efforts of Residential Educa
tion.
While there is little possibility
of empirically establishing causal
ity, you only have to witness the
en masse changes in political affil
iation that take place in the dorms
to make some connection.
From the moment you arrive,
you are made aware that there are
some views you can't express here,
whether it is Ingrid Nava telling
the entire freshman class that
they are personally responsible for
the oppression of her people or
your RA telling you that maybe
you shouldn't have said what you
just did.
The most obvious example of
the limitation on speech within
the campus environment is the
Grey Standard, now more clearly
in violation of the First Amend
ment than ever after the recent
Supreme Court ruling.
My problem with this approach
on the part of Res Ed is that it fails
to be constructive. While on the
surface it may appear that every
one has been educated, it is rarely
the case; rather, those views so op
posed by the institution remain,
unexpressed.
People continue under the pre
tence of an open environment, but
the reality is that one intolerant
environment has just been re
placed with another.
If people are unable to express
publicly the views they hold due to
the fact that that opinion has been
declared unacceptable, how will
they have a chance to have those
views sincerely challenged?
Which, after all, was the point.
Wasn't it?
