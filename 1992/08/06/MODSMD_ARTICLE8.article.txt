## Negative campaigns threaten process 
### 
THE ONLY WAY for President Bush to catch up
with Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton is to resort to
massive negative campaigning — or so the an
alysts tell us.
Under their reasoning, Bush's four years as presi
dent have not produced many positive achievements
to carry him into a second term.
The disturbing thing, however, is that Bush seems
to agree.
In campaigning for a second term, he promises to
solve many of the problems that have characterized the
last 12 years. But instead of explaining why he never
tried to solve these problems before, he tries to convince
Americans that Clinton cannot possibly do a good job.
For the first time in four years, Bush is talking
about health care for all Americans.
For the first time in four years, Bush has pushed
through a budget that supported education — partic
ularly higher education.
For the first time in four years, Bush is giving the
environment and economic growth some space in his
speeches.
One cannot help but ask where all of this was when
elections were farther off than 'just around the corner.'
Clinton's response to the less-than-heart-warm
ing prospect is disappointing. The Democratic cam
paign has already started its own 'preemptive' at
tacks, as evidenced by Clinton's recent speeches on
Bush's record on crime and on health care.
At the same time, the Clinton campaign has dili
gently avoided the one area where Bush is perceived
to have achieved some success: foreign policy.
This is a dangerous attitude to adopt with the world
in a state of such rapid transition. The next president
of the United States needs a clear mandate on the for
eign policy direction that this country will take.
In an era where global factors dominate, the U.S. can
not hope to expand its economy and improve the quality
of life for its citizens while ignoring the rest of the world.

The Clinton campaign needs to address foreign
policy and needs to challenge Bush's claims of foreign
policy successes.
Our reaction to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
new economic needs of the emerging republics, the
conflicts in Eastern Europe and the plight of Bosnia-
Herzegovina can hardly be called timely or successful.
The continuing saga of Saddam Hussein brought
back into the limelight by last week's events also shows
serious flaws in Bush's handling of foreign affairs.
And the double standard the administration
showed in dealing with brutal attacks on democracy
in China and Algeria, simply because the present gov
ernments are perceived as friendly, can by no means
give America the role of international leadership it
needs to assume.
The Democrats' silence on these issues gives cre
dence to Bush's claim that he is the 'experienced' in
ternational character and gives him a way to put a
chink in Clinton's armor.
It is precisely when candidates avoid serious dis
cussion of the issues that they step on the bumpy and
nauseating journey of negative campaigning.
But it is also worth asking whether we, the voters,
are not responsible for this trend.
When a meager 20 percent of registered voters
turns out to vote, the other 80 percent has no busi
ness complaining of the outcome.
And when candidates are carried into office on the
strength of campaigns like the 1988 one, we can hard
ly blame anyone but ourselves for negative campaigns
and the absence of serious discussions on the issues.
The higher education community should feel par
ticularly responsible for combating these trends that
threaten the political process in this country.
Gov. Clinton has advocated the view that a better
educated nation is a more prosperous nation. He may
be right — but only if better education means more
interest in selecting responsible leaders.
