Olympic coverage
gives little credit
to women's teams
We are writing to express our
distress at NBC's coverage of
women's basketball at the 1992
Summer Olympic Games.
During the "Olympic News"
segment of last Thursday's tele
cast, NBC announced that the
American women's basketball
team had defeated Czechoslovakia
by a margin of more than 2 to 1,
with a final score of 111-55.
Yet, although this represents
an Olympic record both for scoring
and victory margin, NBC did not
broadcast even a single moment of
game highlights.
Perhaps one could argue that
such a blowout is not worthy of
television coverage. Or at least,
one could if' one were not broad
casting the men s team's blowouts
in their entirety during prime
time.

As if to drive the point home,
NBC followed the video-less an
nouncement of the women's score
with several minutes of video of
Michael Jordan playing golf!
Then, to add insult to injury,
NBC tossed in the evening's only
'action sequence' of a female bas
ketball player: a Chinese woman
posing fawningly for photogra
phers with — of course — the
men's "Dream Team."
We do not begrudge the Dream
Team its publicity, and we can un
derstand that commercial con
straints may prohibit broadcast
ing women's basketball games in
full.
Women's team sports, NBC
seems to be saying, are not even as
important as what male athletes
do in their time off.
At best, female basketball play
ers are a bit of comic relief — awk
ward, graceless, oversized and ap
propriately deferential toward
their male counterparts.
Here at Stanford, sellout
crowds of men and women alike
have repeatedly packed the gym to

watch talented, poised, aggressive
female athletes play basketball at
a level that would make any sports
fan proud.
Apparently, the Dream Team
agrees: according to The New
York Times, seven men's team
members were in the stands
cheering during the women's
game with Czechoslovakia.
Said Barkley after the game,
"The women are a great team. We
should play them."
Or at least, maybe NBC should
broadcast them. If women's team
sports can win a loyal and
enthusiastic following here at
Stanford, we believe that it can
happen in the rest of America as
well.
But only if television viewers
see America's best when they are
playing at their best. NBC, your
coverage shapes the dreams of fu
ture generations and the Dream
Teams of future Olympics. Don't
blow it.
