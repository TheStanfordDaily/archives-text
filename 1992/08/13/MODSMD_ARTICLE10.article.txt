## Rice to address GOP convention 
### 
Gearing up for next week's na
tional convention, the Republi
cans are seeking to paint them
selves as the party of diversity —
one that isn't afraid to publicly air
squabbles like the bitter platform
debate over abortion.
Party leaders have certainly
found a diverse pair of back-to
back speakers for the convention's
opening night: Assoc. Political Sci
ence Prof. Condoleezza Rice, the
widely respected Bush adminis
tration veteran, followed by ultra
right wing political commentator
Pat Buchanan, the defeated presi
dential candidate.
Rice is scheduled to speak dur
ing the 7 p.m. time slot (5 p.m.
PDT) on Monday. Buchanan's
speech will follow hers, and former
President Ronald Reagan's
keynote address will bring the
opening night to a close.
A former senior adviser to Pres
ident Bush on Soviet affairs, Rice
said she plans to make foreign pol
icy — more specifically, the rea
sons "why we won the Cold War"
— the focus of her speech.
Noting that "our domestic and
foreign policies are inextricable
things," Rice said she plans to ex
plore "the challenges we face in
the new world and also the chal
lenges we face at home."
But it won't be merely a policy
speech — Rice plans to make a con
vincing case for Bush's political
record, too. "I believe strongly in
the things that George Bush has
done in his term," she said.
The theme of the convention's
opening night is "The American
Spirit and the World." Kyle Sim
mons, the convention's spokesper
son, said Rice's experience in the
administration makes her "a per
fect person to address global issues
of foreign policy and national secu
rity."
And, Simmons added, Presi
dent Bush "is a fan and a big sup
porter" of her.
Rice said she was approached
by the Republican National Com-

mittee to give the
speech, but would
not go into fur
ther detail about
how she was se
lected.
During their
convention last
month, the De
mocrats spotlight
ed their women

candidates, and criticized the Re
publicans for their party's stand
against abortion rights and their
treatment of Anita Hill during
Clarence Thomas' confirmation
hearings for the Supreme Court last
fall.
Rice, who is pro-choice, is seen
by some as an antidote to the De
mocrats' claim to women's issues.
She is the only black woman to
have served in a top Bush adminis
tration position, and is considered
a rising star within the Republican
party.
But Rice said the Republicans
are not using her speech as any
sort of counterweight.
"I'm qualified to be here. I've
not given much thought to other

motives for doing it," Rice said,
adding that she is not "Anita Hill's
twin."
She arrived in Houston on Sat
urday, and has been acting as an
adviser to the committee that is
drafting the foreign policy portion
of the Republican platform. The
work has been tiring, Rice said,
noting that a meeting Monday
lasted for nine hours without a
break. "I haven't worked that
hard since I left the government,"
she said.
Ironically, Rice said she had al
ways pitied convention speakers,
whose speeches are often ignored
by delegates more interested in
the shuffle of activity on the con
vention floor.
"I always thought it would be
one of the hardest kinds of speech
es to give," Rice said. "I don't
think most of the people in the hall
pay attention to all of the speak
ers. But I'm sure they'll pay atten
tion to Ronald Reagan."
Rice, who is also a California
delegate to the convention, re
turned to Stanford last August
after serving in the Bush adminis
tration for nearly two years. She
was special assistant to President
Bush for national security affairs,
and senior director for Soviet af
fairs for the National Security
Council.
