# Conference for women begins
## 
### 
What happens when 1,500
women from around the world
gather in one place to discuss
women's issues? Stanford will
soon find out.
The International Federation
of University Women will kick off
its 24th triennial world confer
ence, titled "Women's Role in
Changing Society: Working for
Personal Development, Cultural
Development and Sustainable De
velopment," on campus today.
Delegates from nearly 50 coun
tries are scheduled to attend the
10-day conference, which will ad
dress issues such as equal educa
tional opportunity, the deteriorat
ing environment and women's
roles in top-level decision making.
More than 80 workshops —
some conducted in English and oth
ers in Spanish — will cover issues as
broad as violence, cultural tradi
tions and sports, as well as more
specific topics such as the role of In
dian housewives in nation-building.
At the conference, the IFUW
will also induct new members
from several countries, including
Estonia, Lithuania, Czechoslova
kia, Russia and Malaysia.
While the IFUW has tradition
ally addressed inequities facing

women in higher education, IFUW
President Mary Purcell said the or
ganization has recently recognized
that the problem "begins very
early," undermining women's self
confidence and independence.
According to Purcell, a "new
focus" for the organization will be
early education. For example, a re
cent study of American classrooms
sponsored by the American Associ
ation of University Women found
that girls receive substantially less
attention than boys. In some Asian
and African countries, girls do not
even have access to an education,
Purcell said.
The IFUW will also discuss envi
ronmental issues at its conference.
The organization sent delegates to
the Rio conference in June, but ac
cording to Purcell, "women had a
vepr difficult time getting their
voices heard in that conference."
The IFUW was founded in 1919
to advance the status of women,
promote peace and protect human
rights. Despite the current empha
sis on girls' education and the envi
ronment, the IFUW still remains
committed to the principles on
which it was founded, Purcell said.
As a league of university-educat
ed women, the IFUW is in a power
ful position to enact change, Purcell
said. "We who have had the highest
privilege of education need to lead."
IFUW membership is open to

men and women who have gradu
ated from recognized four-year
colleges and universities. The or
ganization has 180,000 members
from 54 countries.
While women have been thrust
into the political spotlight in the
United States this year — 1992 has
been hailed as 'The Year of the
Woman' and record numbers of
women are currently vying for gov
ernment positions — this "sudden
breakthrough" is not apparent in
the rest of the world, Purcell said.
Purcell contends that the global
women's movement has "clearly
been moving backward" in the past
seven years. She cited an increase in
the numbers of illiterate women and
the inequities that still exist between
women and men in the workplace.
Seven years ago the United Na
tions held the Nairobi Conference
for Women, resolving to improve the
status of women around the world.
While nations created laws to ad
here to the new resolutions, many
women today still remain unaware
of their legal rights, and the laws are
not put into practice, Purcell said.
The worldwide conference al
lows IFUW members to "see them
selves more clearly as a force for
change.... to see what a power we
can be," Purcell said.
According to Chris Winter, past
president of the AAUW's California
chapter, the IFUW meeting is a
"mass networking of women to
learn new skills, form new ideas,
and talk about the successes they've
had in their different countries."
She said she expects the meet
ing to bring about a "renewed
sense of energy to furthering the
women's agenda."
