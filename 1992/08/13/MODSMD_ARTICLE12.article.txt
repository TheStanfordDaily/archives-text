# Research institute to be disbanded
## 
### 
Stanford's Institute for Mathe
matical Studies in the Social Sci
ences will close this fall — 33 years
and 700 research papers after its
founding in 1959 by Philosophy
Prof. Patrick Suppes and Nobel
laureate Kenneth Arrow.
The IMSSS is closing now be
cause Suppes, the only senior fac
ulty member at the institute, will
retire this fall and there is no one
to take his place.
The IMSSS research group will
relocate to the Center for the Study

of Language and
Information Sept.
1. Although Sup
pes will continue
to head this group,
he will no longer
hold an adminis
trative office after
IMSSS closes.
"From a re
search standpoint

there will not be a big change," Sup
pes said, adding that the closing
will simply "reduce (Stanford's) ad
ministrative offices by one."
The IMSSS has generated diverse
programs, from half-hour radio
broadcast lessons for children in
Nicaragua, to courses taught entire
ly by computer — such as Suppes'
own course in introductory logic.
Computer-assisted courses
have also been developed for read
ing, axiomatic set theory, founda
tions of probability, music, philos
ophy and Russian through IMSSS.
Suppes, who has directed the in
stitute since 1959, said it was the
first research group to use comput
er programs as a teaching method
for deaf students — a practice that
is now used nationwide.
Bill Graham, a graduate student
in philosophy who has been with
the IMSSS for five years, said Sup
pes has been crucial to the insti
tute's activities. "Everything that
has been done has been [because of]
Suppes' interests," he said.
Suppes said the closure is a pos
itive move and that the University
"needs to be able to shut down of
fices when the time is right."
The IMSSS began with two
branches: one in mathematical
psychology and education, and one
in mathematical economics. The
economics branch closed in 1989.
At its highpoint in the 19605,
the IMSSS had a staff of about
150, according to Suppes. It now
employs only about 10-12 people,
and has an operating budget of
$500,000, he said.
Suppes said the downsizing of
the IMSSS can be blamed partly on
the fact that he has been writing
fewer grant proposals in the past
few years.
Suppes, 70, also holds professor

ial appointments in education, psy
chology and statistics at Stanford.
He is a decorated scholar, holding
the National Medal of Science and
the Distinguished Scientific Con
tributrion Award of the American
Psychological Association.
