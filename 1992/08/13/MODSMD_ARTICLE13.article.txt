# Mem Chu back in wedding business

### 
Wedding bells will soon be ring
ing again in Memorial Church.
The 89-year-old landmark,
closed for nearly three years be
cause of the Loma Prieta earth
quake, will begin hosting wed
dings again in November.
The church's wedding coordina
tor is back on the job after an earth
quake-induced hiatus, and has al
ready signed up about 30 couples,
and has had inquiries from about
70 more.
The couples are "all pleased
they're going to be able to realize
this," said the coordinator, Betsy
Koester. "Many of them are plan
ning their weddings without ever
having been in the church. So
they're very eager to be able to go
inside and see it."
The church is scheduled to re
open in late September or early
October. During a typical year,
about 200 weddings are held in the
church, Koester said.
She began taking reservations
Aug. 3, and they are already going
fast. But she said the church is
never booked solid — those who
really want a reservation, and are
flexible about the time and date,
can always get one.
"There is always flux," Koester
said. "Some people decide to get
married elsewhere, or unhappily
their plans do not go on as expect
ed." Speaking more ornately, she
added: "Nothing is ever fixed in
concrete — or sandstone. .. .Not
in earthquake country."
In 1989, Koester had the frus
trating chore of telling the hun
dreds of couples who had sched
uled weddings that they would
have to look elsewhere.
"The task was made more diffi
cult by the fact that the church
looked so intact from the outside,"
Koester said. "It was hard to be
lieve that the church sustained the
amount of damage that it did."
Only couples with some Stan
ford University or Stanford Med
ical Center connection can be mar
ried in the church. The bride,
groom or one of their parents must
be a student, a Stanford graduate,
or a member of the faculty or staff.
Fees for use of the church are
$700 for currently enrolled students
and $1,000 for all others. Koester
said she is taking only reservations
for 1992 and 1993 now.
