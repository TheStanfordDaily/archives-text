■ Composer John Cage, who
was at the forefront of America's
musical avant-garde for decades
with works that used pianos with
screws between the strings, ra
dios, vegetables, and sometimes
only silence, died yesterday.

Cage died at St. Vincent's Hos
pital in Manhattan after suffering
a stroke, hospital spokeswoman
Valerie Gundersen said.
Earlier this year, the Stanford
departments of art, drama, Eng
lish and music presented John
Cage Week, a celebration honoring
the composer's 80th birthday.
Cage both lectured and performed
for Stanford audiences through
out the week in January.
In addition to composing
music, Cage also wrote poetry, es
says and lectures, painted and
etched, and was a mycologist, an
expert on mushrooms.
Among his most notorious com
positions was one that consisted
simply of silence. A pianist stepped
onstage, sat at the piano in silence
for several minutes, then walked
off to applause.

■ H. Irving Grousbeck, a mil
lionaire businessman and Gradu
ate School of Business lecturer,
announced Tuesday that he will
not make an offer to purchase the
San Francisco Giants.
His announcement came four
days after Giants owner Bob
Lurie announced a tentative
agreement to sell the team to a
Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla., in
vestment group.
Grousbeck was viewed as the
most promising investor interest
ed in purchasing the team and
keeping it in the Bay Area. But he
said that he could not come close to
matching the $111 million offer
made by the Florida group.
"I am disappointed for both Gi
ants fans in the Bay Area and for
myself," Grousbeck said.
He said the two principal rea
sons behind his decision were the
large losses the team is projected to
sustain over the next several years
while playing at Candlestick Park,

as well as the uncertainty sur
rounding the construction of a new
stadium in the San Francisco area.
"I tried nine ways to make the
numbers work, something that
even a halfway reasonable person
would be willing to invest in,"
Grousbeck told the San Francisco
Chronicle. "I just couldn't do it."
■ Harry BanofT, an associate
professor of opthamology, was
sentenced last week to three years
of probation, a $5,000 fine and 200
hours of community service after
pleading no contest to a charge of
voluntary manslaughter.
BanofT admitted to strangling
his wife after a failed attempt to
make her overdose on painkillers.
Alice Banoff had been chroni
cally ill for the last 20 years and
had asked her husband to help her
end her life, according to Banoff s
defense attorney, Ken Robinson.
According to the probation re
port, Alice Banoff suffered from
diabetes, hypertension and colon
cancer, and her husband's actions
were the result of the long-term
strain of caring for her.
The probation officers recom
mended leniency, asserting that
Banoff represented no threat to
the community.
Olga Olivas — the clerk to Santa
Clara County Judge John T. Ball,
who sentenced Banoff — said
Banoff is also obligated to seek psy
chiatric treatment and to wear an
electronic monitoring device for the
first six months of his probation.
Robinson said he feels "the sen
tence was appropriate under the
circumstances," but added that
the electronic monitoring device
was "not really necessary."
According to Robinson, Banoff
will most likely serve his hours of
community service by providing
medical care through a volunteer
agency.
