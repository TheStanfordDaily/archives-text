# summer Scrapbook
## 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Peter Robison Editorial staff 
Stanford can be a deceptive
ly lazy place during the
summer. Free of the thou
sands of students bustling to class or
zipping through White Plaza on
their bicycles, the campus scene does
a neat turnabout each summer: it
seems calm, even boring.
But beneath the surface, activity
subtly churns along. A retired
welder makes some extra money,
and helps build Stanford's Red Barn
a new corral in the process. A father,
struggling to finish his doctorate
while raising a precocious 3-year-old,
helps the youngster learn how to
paint. And, just as during the school
year, a student (middle left) com
pletes a daily ritual: checking his
post office box for mail, the Holy
Grail of the college years.
I | idden behind a protective
"l I mask, Jacob Stoll welds
I together pieces of scrap
metal to build a new corral at the sta
bles near the Red Barn Tuesday
(above right).
New corrals cost upwards of
$2,000, but by chopping up used pipe

and recycling the metal, Stoll expects
his project to cost only a few hundred
dollars.
"I only do this for about three or
four hours a day, but it gives me good
spending money," said Stoll, a re
tired PG&E worker.
The job is one of three projects the
59-year-old Menlo Park resident is
currently working on. "I've been
telling my wife that I need a vaca
tion," he said.
Making its third appearance at
the Coffee House, "Road House" en
ergizes an enthusiastic crowd Tues
day night (middle right). The group
plays a free-wheeling style of blues,
from popular oldies to their own
original songs.
Between two and five bands play
at the Coffee House each week, said
Jo Townson, who has worked there
for about a year. "It makes it a lot
less boring," she said, and because
the bands draw people from outside
Stanford, "it helps to add variety."
Construction worker Don Mayjof
fo throws a wooden plank from the
third floor of the new Cecil H. Green
Earth Sciences Building near the
Durand Building yesterday (lower
right). Mayjoffo, who has been a car
penter for 13 years, is building wood
en forms to hold the concrete that

will be poured in the three-story
building.
Marcos Montes proudly watches
his son, Nico, learn to paint outside
his Escondido Village apartment
Tuesday evening (center). Raising
the youngster is getting easier,
Montes said, "but there are still
some phases when he's just really ac
tive and really stubborn."
Montes said that painting, which
Nico took up for the first time a few
weeks ago, seems to help. He added
that his son does other "cute things,"
like chasing squirrels and feeding
them "little crumbs of bread, tortilla
chips, crackers — anything."
Montes' wife, Carolina, said rais
ing Nico — along with caring for up
to five other toddlers in a day-care
service she runs — can be a handful.
"I do feel a bit pressed," she said.
"Our apartment is nice, but it can get
small."
At the Campus Bike Shop, a fix
ture on the Row for more than 60
years, employee Ed vonEmster me
thodically repairs a pedal on one of
the 15,000 bicycles the shop has re
paired under its current owner,
Keith Morenz (lower left).
The number is an estimate,
Morenz admits. "I'll be honest with
you, I don't stop to count 'em," he

said. But during his 10 years as
owner, he figures the store has fixed
an average of 40 bikes a day, from re
placing broken brake cables to mend
ing flat tires.
Ken Fesler, a teaching assistant
for a summer astronomy class,
places a solar filter over the 14-inch
solar telescope at the student obser
vatory Tuesday (upper left).
Fesler, who has been doing re
search on the Farm for "quite a few
years," prepares to examine the late
afternoon sun for the presence of
sun spots.
But the telescope is not in a good
location for serious research, Fesler
said. The lights from the University,
surrounding communities and espe
cially the West Campus tennis courts
create a glow in the Foothills that
hampers visibility.
"All the light pollution from down
there just creates an amazing glare
up here," he said.
Normally the observatory doesn't
attract much attention, Fesler said.
But during the last year's solar
eclipse, the building was deluged by
people wanting to get a closer look at
the sun.
"We must have had 50 people
crowded inside and another hundred
outside waiting to get in,"he said.

Jo Townson, who has worked there
for about a year. "It makes it a lot
less boring," she said, and because
the bands draw people from outside
Stanford, "it helps to add variety."

third floor of the new Cecil H. Green
Earth Sciences Building near the

penter for 13 years, is building wood

Marcos Montes proudly watches
his son, Nico, learn to paint outside
his Escondido Village apartment
Tuesday evening (center). Raising
the youngster is getting easier,
Montes said, "but there are still
some phases when he's just really ac
tive and really stubborn."
Montes said that painting, which
Nico took up for the first time a few
weeks ago, seems to help. He added
that his son does other "cute things,"
like chasing squirrels and feeding
them "little crumbs of bread, tortilla
chips, crackers — anything."
Montes' wife, Carolina, said rais
ing Nico — along with caring for up
to five other toddlers in a day-care
service she runs — can be a handful.
"I do feel a bit pressed," she said.
"Our apartment is nice, but it can get
small."
At the Campus Bike Shop, a fix
ture on the Row for more than 60
years, employee Ed vonEmster me
thodically repairs a pedal on one of
the 15,000 bicycles the shop has re
paired under its current owner,
Keith Morenz (lower left).
The number is an estimate,
Morenz admits. "I'll be honest with
you, I don't stop to count 'em," he

said. But during his 10 years as
owner, he figures the store has fixed
an average of 40 bikes a day, from re
placing broken brake cables to mend
ing flat tires.
Ken Fesler, a teaching assistant
for a summer astronomy class,
places a solar filter over the 14-inch
solar telescope at the student obser
vatory Tuesday (upper left).
Fesler, who has been doing re
search on the Farm for "quite a few
years," prepares to examine the late
afternoon sun for the presence of
sun spots.
But the telescope is not in a good
location for serious research, Fesler
said. The lights from the University,
surrounding communities and espe
cially the West Campus tennis courts
create a glow in the Foothills that
hampers visibility.
"All the light pollution from down
there just creates an amazing glare
up here," he said.
Normally the observatory doesn't
attract much attention, Fesler said.
But during the last year's solar
eclipse, the building was deluged by
people wanting to get a closer look at
the sun.
"We must have had 50 people
crowded inside and another hundred
outside waiting to get in,"he said.
