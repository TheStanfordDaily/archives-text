## Wizard leads Stanford to Magic Kingdom 
### M. Scott Walker Staff writer 
It's pretty funny how things
come full circle.
The Stanford Athletic Depart
ment rejected a bid for the football
team to end last year's break
through season in Anaheim's
Freedom Bowl. Yet Anaheim is
where the Cardinal will begin
what could be another banner
year, as Stanford faces Texas
A&M in the Pigskin Classic 111 on
Aug. 26.
The first step on the road to
Pasadena involves a season-open
ing clash with the Aggies. The Or
ange County Sports Association,
which organizes this annual af
fair, has set up a game which
should only be rivaled in the early
season by Michigan-Notre Dame
on Sept. 12.
An early season contest like the
Pigskin Classic can often come
down to execution, which is the
responsibility of the respective
coaches. Two of college football's
finest field generals will be on dis
play at the game.
Bill Walsh is the marquee
name. He has a 17-7 lifetime
record at the helm of the Cardinal.
But you probably know him for
his 102-63-1 record and three
Super Bowl championships as the
head coach of the San Francisco
49ers. He is a legend, no doubt,
and his stature as a great football
mind is richly deserved.
It may be heresy in the Bay
Area to compare any coach to
Walsh, but R.C. Slocum is a coach
who deserves the honor of com
parison. Slocum has been remark
able at Texas A&M, and his ac
complishments rival what Walsh
did in his first Stanford stint.
Slocum has a 27-9-1 record at
Texas A&M. He has taken the Ag
gies to three consecutive bowl
games. Last season, his team fin
ished an undefeated Southwest
Conference season, winning its
fourth SWC title in six years.
The coaching staffs are both
very competent. The similarities
of the teams continue, as both
squads will rely on stifling defens
es.
Stanford returns 10 starters
from a defense which gelled dur
ing Stanford's hot streak last
year. The linebacking corps is the

jewel of the defense, as the unit is
ranked in the top-10 nationally.
The "G-Men", Ron George and
Dave Garnett, lead this solid
group of backers. The defensive
line is underrated and has im
proved significantly in practice.
The secondary should work well
as a unit, as they lost only Albert
Richardson. He will be replaced by
part-time starter John Lynch.
Texas A&M has a similar de
fensive composition. Preseason
All-American Marcus Buckley
leads a very talented linebacking
unit. Buckley follows Quentin
Coryatt (second pick in 1992
draft) and Aaron Wallace as domi
nant outside linebackers.
As with Stanford, Texas A&M
has an underrated secondary and
defensive line. Patrick Bates was
voted one of the nation's hardest
hitters from his strong safety po
sition. Sam Adams, an aggressive

pass-rusher, and Eric England re
turn from the Aggies' "Six-Pack"
unit which provides great depth
on the defensive line.
These units combine to form
"The Wrecking Crew," which lead
the nation in total defense last
season. While Washington re
ceives plenty of well deserved
credit for their defensive prowess,
Texas A&M may have the best de
fense Stanford will face this year.
Two stellar coaches, two stellar
defenses. . .all signs point to a
tight game decided in the last min
utes. The similarity of the offen
sive personnel suggests nothing
different.
Both teams have quality offen
sive lines. The Sporting News
ranks Stanford's offensive line
third in the nation, while the Ag
gies check in at No. 10. Each team
returns four starters from solid
units.

These lines will have some
great backs for whom to open
holes. Glyn Milburn and Greg Hill
will each begin their Heisman
Trophy quests on the Anaheim
Stadium turf.
Last year, Milburn may not
have had the standout season he
did in 1990, but he still had over
1500 all-purpose yards. "There is
no question that many of our
thoughts toward running the ball
center around Glyn Milburn," of
fensive coordinator Terry Shea
said. Milburn looks to regain his
1990 form as Stanford's feature
back.
His counterpart, Greg Hill, is
simply marvelous. Hill's 1216
yards last season in his freshman
campaign were better than any
other SWC rusher. Hill finished
twelfth in the nation in rushing.
The passing games are where
the similarities end. The Aggies

have experienced receivers, led by
junior Tony Harrison. For Stan
ford, four inexperienced receivers
will see playing time, led by se
niors David Calomese and Mike
Cook. Ryan Wetnight and Greg
Schorp will hold down the tight
end duties for Stanford and Texas
A&M, respectively.
Stanford's only big edge comes
at quarterback. Steve Stenstrom
has looked brilliant in practice for
Stanford. Matt Miller, a redshirt
freshman, has a tenuous hold on
the position for the Aggies.
This game clearly sets the tone
for the rest of Stanford's season.
"There will be far more important
football games to be played than
the Washington game," said Shea,
and this may be the one he meant.
The Pigskin Classic is followed by
three very winnable home games
for the Cardinal. "If we play well
in those three games. . .that's got
to be the foundation of our pro
gram," Shea said.
The coaches do expect big
things from this Cardinal team.
"Whenever you have some of your
best players as seniors, then you
always have a chance to have a
successful year," Shea said.
Walsh was a bit more specific.
"I think we should be a very solid
Pac-10 contender in 1992," he
said in the team's media guide.
The critics seem to agree, with
most pollsters placing Stanford
second or third in the conference.
But it all starts with the Aggies.

backer. .. .Gibbs is still recover
ing from a knee injury... .Vince
Otupal has rejoined the

Dinny Hansen for academic rea
sons made this possible. .. .Quote
of the Week (L.A. Times): Walsh
on the opening game: "I was real

we could have had seminars and,
perhaps, a little polo during the
