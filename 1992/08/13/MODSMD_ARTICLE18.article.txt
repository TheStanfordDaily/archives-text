## Giants playing last S.F. games — who's to blame? 
### 
The Giants are gone. Long live the Giants.
Oh, I know all the newspapers are still
holding out hope that the owners or Fay Vin
cent or Zeus or someone will save them for
San Francisco, but the newspapers need a
clue. The Giants are history, and San Fran
cisco deserves better.

A mtyor-league city
deserves to have a mfgor
league team. San Fran
cisco is the major
leaguest of cities, and not
only should it have a ball
club, but it should have
one a lot better than the
Giants.
"Sure," the naysay -
ers naysay, "but the Bay
Area already has a base
ball team — the A's.
Fans from the Peninsula
can just go up to the Col
iseum."
But these people are
missing the point. The

Bay Area is not one metro area that needs
only one team. It is two independent cities,
each of which can support a separate fran
chise. Hence the Oakland A's and the San
Francisco Giants.
How ironic that the man who saved the
Giants from moving to Toronto in the mid
'70s, owner (for now) Bob Lurie, is the

same bitter, beaten man who will now sell
to the first city available.
Yes, Candlestick Park really stinks, but
its not reason enough to take a team away.
This is a personal issue for Lurie now.
Four times in the last decade, most re
cently this spring in San Jose, voters have

turned down proposals
for new stadiums paid
for entirely by public
funds.
But let's be honest
here. The last thing vot
ers want to do in bad
economic times is fork
over $400 million for a
baseball park.
Lurie should take a
hint from Washington
Redskins owner Jack
Kent Cooke. When Cooke
wanted a glistening new
stadium, he didn't go
straight to the taxpayers.
He himself volunteered

to pay much of the cost, and guess what? He's
going to get a new stadium in Alexandria, Vir
ginia.
San Franciscans have been showing in
the last week how badly they want to keep
the Giants. What a shame it is that Bob
Lurie won't let someone else become the
next Bob Lurie.

Oh, boo-hoo, poor San Francisco is los
ing the Giants, a team which this city has
shown time after time that it couldn't care
less about.
All of a sudden, now that the Giants are
going, politicians like Mayor Frank Jordan
and Supervisor Angela Alioto are crying

out against the move.
It's probably too late to
save the Giants, of
course, but it's not too
late to save their politi
cal necks.
San Francisco's solu
tion to the move? Blame
big bad Bob Lurie for
selling out the people of
the Bay Area.
This finger-pointing
makes me absolutely
sick — the people of San
Francisco have no one
to blame but them
selves.
All Bob Lurie asked

for was a ballpark that didn't feel like it
was on the Artie Circle, so people would
come out to the games.
Cleveland hardly has the financial means
of San Francisco, and yet that city is build
ing a new ballpark for the Indians, a team
that doesn't even play major-league quality
ball.

San Franciscans may like the idea of
having a major-league baseball team and
the prestige associated with it. But when it
came time for them to put their money
where their mouths were, they voted down
ballpark initiative after initiative.
You can only reject somebody so many

times before they start to
realize that you don't
like them. And Bob
Lurie finally got the
message that San Fran
cisco voters were send
ing him: "Leave if you
want, we don't care."
Maybe the voters
chose to bluff Lurie.
"Sure," they said, "he's
losing tons of money
every year because the
Giants can't even draw
two million fans, but he'd
never sell the team." You
should never take some
one for granted.

Sure, I wish the Giants were staying. I
think it's kind of fun in a masochistic way
to go out to the 'Stick and see a game, as
only real baseball fans will brave the freez
ing winds. But obviously San Francisco
doesn't have many real baseball fans —
this city's fans are definitely of the fair
weather variety.
