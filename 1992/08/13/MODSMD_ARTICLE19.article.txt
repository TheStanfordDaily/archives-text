## Jazz Workshop ends season with tribute to Diz 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
In 1984, during the 12th season
of the Stanford Jazz Work
shop, Dizzy Gillespie, the con
summate performer, joined the
ranks of the program's faculty-en
tertainers at age 67.
Now celebrating its 20th sea
son, the Workshop has organized a
two-performance salute to Gille
spie this weekend in honor of his
75th birthday in October.

Many amazing individuals have
participated in the Workshop as
performers and instructors since
it opened its doors for educational
instruction and the presentation
of jazz. But few have bathed in the
world-wide recognition and ac
claim that trumpet master Gille
spie has encountered.
Born John Birks Gillespie,
Dizzy, together with saxophonist
Charlie "Yard Bird" Parker,
turned the music world inside
out with their early bebop record

bop, fusion and world.
Gillespie's music has made use
of the majority of these deriva
tives, and many of the musicians
performing in "Celebrating the
Diz" (Friday) and "To Diz with
Love: The Dizzy Gillespie Dia
mond Jubilee at Stanford" (Sat
urday), have helped him to devel
op and use them effectively.
One of the mtyor quartets to
move out of the cool movement
during the '50s was the Modern
Jazz Quartet (MJQ), which fea
tured four black musical sophisti
cates whose skill, intensity and
love for the music have enabled
them to continue a successful mu
sical career to this day.
The vibraphonist from the
group, Milt Jackson, endures
today as one of the leading practi
tioners of his craft and is known to
be one of Gillespie's closest
friends.
His name alone evokes great
excitement from jazz fans every
where, and any performance in
which he participates can't help
being a wonderful listening expe
rience.
Also performing this weekend
is saxophonist James Moody, who
first played with Gillespie during
the late '40s in New York. His
early association with Gillespie
and other jazz giants like Jackson
and Thelonius Monk was indica
tive of his obvious talent.
It wasn't until a recording date
in Sweden produced "Moody's
Mood for Love," however, that
his talent as a jazz musician was
fully realized.
Said to be one of the 10 most
recognized sax players alive,
Moody is a musician whose
modesty has kept him honest,
sincere and interpretively re
freshing.
■ Trombonist Slide Hampton
I has been described as a "virtu
oso melodist with blues-tinged
fire, immaculate intonation and
the rare skills reflected in the
continuity, variety and drama of
his improvisations."
The above indicates, in elabo
rate and technical terms, that
Hampton is one baaad cat.

Starting at an early age, Hamp
ton mastered the trombone with
out formal instruction before
touring with the big bands of Max
Roach, Art Blakey, Thad Jones
and Gillespie as well.
He's toured extensively abroad
and in the United States as both a
sideman and band leader, and in
1962 he formed the "Slide Hamp
ton Octet."
Hampton has also played a key
role in the orchestration of the
Workshop's tribute to Gillespie,
including the composing of sever
al new arrangements of tradition
al Gillespie tunes like "Night in
Tunisia."
Gillespie once said of conga
drummer Giovanni "Manengui
to" Hidalgo: "In Puerto Rico there
is a grand musician — Giovanni
Hidalgo.
"By my standards, he is one of
the greatest percussionists ever;
he takes it from where Chano
Pozo (a pioneering Cuban percus
sionist) left off."
Hidalgo, like Jackson, Moody
and Hampton, will perform at the
Workshop's two Gillespie trib
utes, acting as an emissary of the

Afro-Cuban-influenced jazz that
remains a hallmark of Gillespie's
illustrious career.
A graduate of the Puerto Rico
Conservatory of Music, Hidalgo
has played with a variety of jazz
and pop artists including Art
Blakey, Tito Puente, Carlos San
tana, George Benson and the R&B
group Cameo.
He is also a current member of
Gillespie's United Nations Or
chestra and plays extensively
around the world in various jazz
festivals and performances.
Jackson, Moody, Hampton and
Hidalgo are a fairly broad mix
ture of the talent scheduled for
both tributes, although more
than a dozen other musicians will
be in attendance, making this an
undoubtedly worthwhile experi
ence.

"Celebrating the Diz" takes place
Friday at 8 p.m. in the Fairmont
Hotel's Venetian Room, S.F. "The
Dizzy Gillespie Diamond Jubilee "
takes place Saturday at 2 p.m. in
Frost Amphitheater, Stanford.
For tickets, call 386-8535 (Friday)
or 725-ARTS (Saturday).

in Sweden produced "Moody's
Mood for Love," however, that
his talent as a jazz musician was
fully realized.
Said to be one of the 10 most
recognized sax players alive,
Moody is a musician whose
modesty has kept him honest,
sincere and interpretively re
freshing.
■ Trombonist Slide Hampton
I has been described as a "virtu
oso melodist with blues-tinged
fire, immaculate intonation and
the rare skills reflected in the
continuity, variety and drama of
his improvisations."
The above indicates, in elabo
rate and technical terms, that
Hampton is one baaad cat.

Starting at an early age, Hamp
ton mastered the trombone with
out formal instruction before
touring with the big bands of Max
Roach, Art Blakey, Thad Jones
and Gillespie as well.
He's toured extensively abroad
and in the United States as both a
sideman and band leader, and in
1962 he formed the "Slide Hamp
ton Octet."
Hampton has also played a key
role in the orchestration of the
Workshop's tribute to Gillespie,
including the composing of sever
al new arrangements of tradition
al Gillespie tunes like "Night in
Tunisia."
Gillespie once said of conga
drummer Giovanni "Manengui
to" Hidalgo: "In Puerto Rico there
is a grand musician — Giovanni
Hidalgo.
"By my standards, he is one of
the greatest percussionists ever;
he takes it from where Chano
Pozo (a pioneering Cuban percus
sionist) left off."
Hidalgo, like Jackson, Moody
and Hampton, will perform at the
Workshop's two Gillespie trib
utes, acting as an emissary of the

Afro-Cuban-influenced jazz that
remains a hallmark of Gillespie's
illustrious career.
A graduate of the Puerto Rico
Conservatory of Music, Hidalgo
has played with a variety of jazz
and pop artists including Art
Blakey, Tito Puente, Carlos San
tana, George Benson and the R&B
group Cameo.
He is also a current member of
Gillespie's United Nations Or
chestra and plays extensively
around the world in various jazz
festivals and performances.
Jackson, Moody, Hampton and
Hidalgo are a fairly broad mix
ture of the talent scheduled for
both tributes, although more
than a dozen other musicians will
be in attendance, making this an
undoubtedly worthwhile experi
ence.
