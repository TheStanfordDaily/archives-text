# Some tips for the jazz neophyte
## 
### Victor Haseman Staff writer 
With the wealth of jazz music
floating around the Bay Area, it's
difficult to distinguish between the
musical wheat and chaff.
If, however, you're really inter
ested in starting a jazz collection or
getting to know the music and its
people, start with your local jazz
station on the FM band and/or an
artist whose name you're most fa
miliar with.
A suitable station is the College
of San Mateo's KCSM (91.1 FM).
It's the only jazz station in the Bay
Area that's non-commercial, and
for Stanford listeners, it gets better
reception than the Bay Area's pre
mier jazz station, KJAZ (92.7 FM).
An artist you might sample is
Dizzy Gillespie, possibly one of the
most recognized jazz musicians still
alive today. His list of musical ac
complishments and recordings is
never-ending, which makes him a
particularly appealing candidate
for the exploring listener.
On a single compact disc record
ing, the daring listener may find
anything: swing, bop, Afro-Cuban
or Latin jazz and maybe even the
semblance of R&B/soul.
Finding recordings of his music
isn't a problem — finding good
recordings, however, can be. Many
of the small record labels on which
Dizzy and many other jazzheads
recorded between the '40s and '60s

were either forced out of the indus
try by larger labels or lost the abili
ty to attract big-name artists.
Fortunately, these early record
ings aren't lost to the econo-collec
tor forever. Instead they've been
scooped up by specialty labels who
buy the rights to recordings for sec
ondary distribution.
These recordings exist as the
best and worst bet for the cautious
listener. The best: they generally
run a bit cheaper than regular CD
and tape recordings. The worst: a
great price won't always mean a
grand sound.
The European recording label
Vogue, for instance, is one sec
ondary distributor you can trust.
Its Jazz Heritage collection offers
European recordings of some of the
all-time jazz greats, including vo
calist Sarah Vaughn, saxophonist
Stan Getz, and of course the Dtz
himself.
Vogue's Gillespie release,
"S'Wonderful," is fabulous listen
ing. It features ballads and slower
tunes recorded by Gillespie in Paris
during the early'sos.
Accompanied by several differ
ent ensembles, Gilflptpfe plays a
mixture of standards" ("Ev*ryti\ing
Happens to Me," "She's Funny that
Way," "My Man") and original
tunes ("Watch Out" and "Moon
Nocturne").
Gillespie and company's fine im
provisation and stylistic interpreta
tions enhance the innate beauty of

the arrangements 10,000-fold.
Since his early days in bebop,
Gillespie has distinguished himself
as an interpretive genius and tonal
gymnast. His leaps, dives and
twists up and down the trumpet's
register are delivered with aston
ishing fluidity.
On the other hand, many of his
original tunes strike far more inter
esting Afro-Cuban and Latin
rhythms, adding a sensuousness to
interpretation and improv that is
difficult to rival. The majority of
Gillespie's early solo recordings al
ternate between familiar standards
and spicy ethnic numbers.
Another independent label, Ob
ject Enterprises Ltd., offers a
recording, "Lady Be Good," that fo
cuses on several quick-paced, Afro-
Cuban/Latin favorites like "Night
in Tunisia," "Manteca" and"Tin
Tin Deo."
Unfortunately, this econo
priced CD offers poor recordings of
great tunes, making the purchase a
bittersweet escapade.
The moral of the story is start
cheap and feel around for the sec
ondary labels that offer the jazz
musicians you want with a sound
quality you can tolerate.
But sometimes it's better to
spend a few dollars more for tin
recording that feel as if
you're up in the bandstand with
Dizzy, as opposed to listening
through the wall with a glass to
your ear.
