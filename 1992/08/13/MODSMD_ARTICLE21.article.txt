Back in the saddle
"Unforgiven "
Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven"
marks his triumphant return to
the Western. As both director and
star, Eastwood proves he knows
how to captivate an audience.
"Unforgiven" is a comprehensive
character study and an introspec
tive treatise on human nature.
Eastwood's experience in West
erns is quite evident. He delivers a
very good film, but "Unforgiven"
misses classic status on a few ac
counts. While extremely enjoyable
to watch, this film lacks a hook
similar to those that make his
spaghetti Westerns so memorable.
Eastwood obviously learned
much about Westerns while play
ing roles in Italy. Like the classic
spaghetti Western "The Good, the
Bad and the Ugly" directed by Ser
gio Leone, Eastwood's film has a
slow pace allowing complex char
acters time to develop.

'Unforgiven' is a
Western without a
hero — no white
hats, no sparkling
spurs and no shiny
badges.

Eastwood plays William
Munny, an ex-bounty hunter.
Transformed into a respectable
man by his deceased wife, Munny
is reluctant to return to his past.
But failure as a hog farmer drives
Munny into the hunt for two cow
boys responsible for terribly scar
ring the face of a prostitute. An
older man retired to a kinder life,
Munny has abandoned his past
and only returns to it out of ne
cessity.
Eastwood does not provide pop
culture with another distinctive
one-liner. Instead, Munny makes
many dry and humorous yet for
gettable remarks while squinting
at his target.
While "Unforgiven" is a char
acter study, what Eastwood fails
to include is a higher level of in
terrelationship between the main
characters. Each is well devel
oped as an individual, but their
interaction provides no deep in
sights into their relationships.
Expanding these associations
would have been a great asset to
the film overall.
The film isn't packed with sa
loon brawls or gunfights, and the
violence that does exist is limited
to what complements the other
elements of the character devel
opment, in addition to establish
ing and concluding the plot.
The simple plot proceeds with
care, and while nothing is hurried
or omitted, the pace does not
seem sluggish. Rather it allows
the audience time to acquire a
sense of the struggles within the
characters from many angles.
Big Whiskey's lawman, Little
Bill, is played by Gene Hackman.
Little Bill is the bad guy on the
right side of the law. his concern
for justice comes after his desire
for revenge and will to keep order
in the town through his brand of
preventative maintenance.
Morgan Freeman as Ned
Logan, Munny's old partner, and
Richard Harris as English Bob
play limited roles, but allow the
demonstration of Little Bill's
brutal and corrupt character.
Logan's retreat from the hunt
emphasizes the idea that pulling
the trigger requires a certain cal
lousness ruffians can lose.
"Unforgiven" is a Western
without a hero. There are no
white hats, no sparkling spurs
and no shiny badges. Every main

character is evil in his own right.
The bounty hunters and the law
man are cruel and cold-blooded.
"Unforgiven" makes a strong
statement about the nature of
men willing to kill.

Sex and stupidity
"Whispers in the Dark "
For those who were offended by
the portrayal of women — lesbian,
bisexual or heterosexual — in
"Basic Instinct," a sort of revenge
is at hand. Paramount's "Whis
pers in the Dark" shows hetero
sexual men as bumbling, self-pity
ing, neurotic and a danger to
women.
Unfortunately, just as the men
in "Instinct," the women are at
best stupid and at worst spectacu
larly incompetent.
"Whispers" stars Annabella
Sciorra ("Jungle Fever," "The
Hand That Rocks the Cradle") as
therapist Ann Hacker. As her per
sonal life deteriorates, she be
comes obsessed with the sado
masochistic relationship in which
a female patient of hers, Eve
(Deborah Unger), is involved.
Subsequently, she dates a man
(Jamey Sheridan) who may be the
same person her patient tells her
about.
Unfortunately, this film was
written and directed by a man
(Christopher Crowe) who cannot
follow up on his compelling psy
chological premise. Instead, the
film shifts into a murder mystery,
abandoning all sense of plausibili
ty.
For example, a character who
wants to convince Ann that he
wasn't the killer breaks into her
house, hogties and gags her, then
proceeds to threaten her with a lit
cigarette and garden shears. When
that doesn't convince her, said
character cuts her loose and runs
out onto the ledge, whereupon she
tries to save him.
The dialogue isn't much better.
After telling Ann how her lover
made her stand on a chair and put
her head through a noose while he
threatened to kill her, Eve says,
"Then he went down on me. I
never came so hard in my life."
The audience never laughed that
hard in a long time, either.
Crowe is also very disingenuous
about his film. He said in an inter
view that he spoke to several
women about their fantasies so
that the film would reflect them.

But whose fantasy do you think it
is for Ann's female patient to come
in, undress, and masturbate in
front of her?
And in Ann's soft-focus wet
dreams about her patient's sto
ries, why is it that the only body
parts that are distinguishable are
the woman's?
Women will not be able to take
much solace in an intelligent fe
male protagonist. Ann is com
pletely unaware of the violent his
tory of another of her patients and
remains involved with her man
even when all clues point to him as
the killer. Clearly, sex-induced
stupidity is not the province of
Michael Douglas alone.
The film does contain some
good performances. Sciorra,
Sheridan and Anthony LaPaglia
as the intrepid police investigator
are all credible, though they are
often undermined by the outra
geous dialogue they must deliver.
Alan Alda is fine as Ann's solici
tous mentor until the end, where
he overacts hilariously.
But the real find of this film is
John Leguizamo ("Hangin' with
the Homeboys"), whose intense
and nuanced performance sur

vives Crowe's over-the-top direc
tion.
Films are often accused of
misogyny, while occasionally films
are accused of man-bashing, and
rarely will everyone agree. Howev
er, a double-bill of "Basic Instinct"
and "Whispers in the Dark" could
be described with a single word:
misanthropy. And no one would
have a problem with that.

A near thrillomedy
"Raising Cain "
Brian DePalma, the self-styled
heir to Alfred Hitchcock, took an
extended vacation from the thriller
genre with such films as "The Un
touchables" and "Casualties of
War." Now, two years after his
much publicized flop "Bonfire of
the Vanities," he has returned to
the genre that made him famous.
"Raising Cain," set right here
on the Peninsula, is the story of
Carter Nix (John Lithgow), a child
psychologist who becomes ob
sessed with his young daughter.
He and his evil twin Cain (also
Lithgow) kidnap young children

for their father Dr. Nix (again
Lithgow), who wants to use them
in his personality experiments.
When Carter discovers that his
wife Jenny (Lolita Davidovich)
and an old flame, Jack (Steven
Bauer), are having an affair, he
plots her murder.
DePalma uses his considerable
bag of tricks to scare the audience.
What makes the film so interest
ing is that he uses those same
techniques to elicit laughter.
An over-the-top makeout scene

DePalma throws in
plot twists almost ar
bitrarily, giving the
film a haphazard and
disorganized feel.

between Jenny and Jack in front
of his comatose wife leaves the au
dience in stitches, as does the
film's climax, a parody of DePal
ma's "Odessa Steps" sequence in
"The Untouchables."
DePalma's penchant for long
Steadicam takes is less successful.
He uses them during long bouts of
exposition, which is more inter
esting than watching talking
heads. These takes also have a
subliminal effect, because the au
dience is waiting for a cut but
doesn't know it. Unfortunately,
the lack of perfect focus during
these shots can make for a small
headache.
The script is the weakest part
of an otherwise good film. DePal
ma throws in plot twists almost
arbitrarily, giving the film a hap
hazard and disorganized feel. The
audience also feels cheated be
cause they have no chance at all to
predict what will happen next.
DePalma parodies his own
techniques well, but he is unable
to parody the thriller genre.
Though he throws in allusions to
"Psycho," "Peeping Tom" and his
own "Sisters" and "Dressed to
Kill," his script isn't constructed
to parody the genre. Had he done
so, "Cain" would have been the
first true "thrillomedy."
Lithgow is both creepy and
chameleon-esque in his different
roles. Davidovich and Bauer are
suitably deadpan, playing straight
man to the material's funny man.
But the true star of "Raising
Cain" is its director, who is serving
notice that his two-year layoff has
not blunted his edge. I n the absence
of Hitchcock, DePalma's claim to
the title of master of suspense is at
least as good as anyone else's.
