# Men allowed in 'Ladies' Room'
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Editorial staff 
As you walk into San Francis
co's Theatre on the Square, an
usher tells a male patron, "I'm
sorry, sir, this is the ladies' room,"
then giggles at his own bad joke.
The joke is that the title of the
play is "Ladies' Room," but you
don't need to be a woman to enjoy
this insanely entertaining comedy
set in the women's bathroom of a
trendy Mexican restaurant during
happy hour.
Originally a 10-minute sketch by
the Groundlings comedy troupe in
Los Angeles, "Ladies' Room" at
first seems to offer men a sneak
peek at what goes on when women
leave en masse to powder their nose.
But this is comedy, and much of
what takes place is just over-the
top enough to make the women in
the audience lean over and tell their
dates, "Women don't really shave
their legs in public bathrooms."
The nominal plot revolves
around three ad agency co-workers
all lusting after their boss. Amidst
a variety of activities conducted in
the lounge, the women discuss
their infatuations and come to real
ize what a heel the object of their
dreams really is.
But the pedantic "men are pigs"
mentality is the weakest part of the
play, and when career woman Liz
(Robin Riker) laments the ticking
of her biological clock, it's time to
slip out to the real ladies' room.
It's to Riker's credit that she cre
ates an endearing personality out
of such a clich6d character, the
"Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford
[surely added when the play moved
north I who's well-read, speaks two
foreign languages and owns her
own condo," but who still can't rec
oncile her career with her desire for

a man and children.
Luckily, her moanings are bro
ken up by a trio of waitresses and
two catty airheads on the prowl for
guys. Every time the bathroom
door swings open, another breath
of hysterical comedy blows in.
Although many of the charac
ters are a bit too broadly drawn —
like Liz's borderline-alcoholic,
slightly overweight best friend
Kathleen (Ellen Ratner) — the per
formers are what really makes
"Ladies' Room" shine.
In particular, Christie Mellor
and Lisa Kudrow as the two tacky
Valley Girlesque friends Romy and
Michelle bring down the house
with their dishes at the other
women in the restroom and com
ments about the men at the bar
("Don't you think guys are cuter

when they have rullee good jobs?").
Most of what's funny about
"Ladies' Koom" revolves around
these comedy-of-life moments.
Robin SchifFs script, when not
overly preachy about the value of
men, offers witty dialogue about
potentially crass subjects like penis
size, diuretics and bikini wax.
Small comedic touches make po
tentially boring scenes hilarious,
such as when boss Joel (Sam
Fontana) gets trapped in one of the
stalls, listening to the women fight
over him, eavesdropping on their
private conversation, just as the au
dience is eavesdropping through
out the entire play.

"Ladies 'Room "plays at Theatre on
the Square, 450 Post St., S.F. Call
433-9500 for tickets.
