# Prof. recreates America
## 
### Peter Robison Editorial staff 
In her critically acclaimed performance
pieces, Anna Deavere Smith can assume
the identity of anyone from columnist Herb
Caen to a Brooklyn rapper.
By juxtaposing diverse viewpoints on
racial tension, Smith has been creating a
telling — and often jarring — collage of
city life in contemporary America for
nearly 10 years.
Earlier this month, Smith, a Stanford
drama professor, was commissioned by the
prestigious Mark Taper Forum in Los An
geles to write a new play about the city's
May riots.
The commission comes in the midst of
the New York run of "Fires in the Mirror,"
Smith's Obie Award-winning theater piece
examining racial violence in the Crown
Heights section of Brooklyn.
The piece's critical and popular success
brought national attention to the 41-year
old Smith, who was profiled in Newsweek,
The New York Times and the Los Angeles
Times this summer. And it led to specula
tion that she may leave her position at
Stanford.
But Ron Davies, a Drama Department
administrator, said Smith has decided to
stay.
"Everybody was worrying about
whether she would return to Stanford, and
the answer is yes, she will," he said.
Since 1983, Smith's incisive plays have
dissected racial issues. She sets each of
them in a different city, and calls her series
"On the Road: A Search for American
Character."
After interviewing dozens of people,
Smith recreates their mannerisms and
voices onstage, using portions of the inter
views verbatim. In "Fires in the Mirror,"
she takes on nearly 30 different identities,
from radical feminist Angela Davis to a
Jewish housewife.
For her San Francisco play "From the
Outside Looking In," performed at the Eu
reka theater in 1990, she mimicked Caen
and Mayor Art Agnos, among others.
But Smith's strength lies in her ability
to present multiple perspectives without
taking sides — she merely acts as a conduit
for expression, creating a "semi-documen
tary," her admirers say.

"The success of her work so far has been
the way that she's remained somehow neu -
tral," Davies said. "She performs people
without criticizing them — she lets them
speak for themselves. People can go and
hear the different points of view and not
feel that one perspective is right and an
other perspective is wrong."

For her San Francisco play
"From the Outside Looking
In," Smith mimicked Herb
Caen and Mayor Art Agnos.

One of Smith's interview subjects,
Assoc. Drama Prof. William Eddelman,
agreed. A friend of Smith's since she joined
the faculty two years ago, Eddelman was
interviewed for her San Francisco piece.
Eddelman described her as an "incredibly
tolerant individual" who can "find some
thing of value and interest" in all of her in
terview subjects.
"What I like particularly about Anna is
that her mind is so open — she's always
searching and always looking for interest
ing viewpoints," Eddelman said.
He expects Smith's new play, scheduled
to run June 3 through July 18 at the Los
Angeles theater nfext summer, to continue
in the same vein. Smith will probably inter
view subjects ranging from a white police
man to a Korean grocery store owner, Ed
delman said.
And Davies speculated that she may in
terview anyone from former Los Angeles
Police Chief Daryl Gates to Mayor Tom
Bradley to a member of the Crips or
Bloods.
But even though Smith's works are
based on impersonations of others, her
artistic voice is always present, Eddelman
said. "She gives you enough of the person
alities so you recognize them," he said,
"but she's not completely subsumed by
them."
Smith has been on leave from Stanford
for the past year, on a fellowship at Rad
cliffe College's Bunting Institute. She will
return to Stanford this fail to teach a
Drama Department workshop called "Be
yond Stereotypes of Race and Gender."
