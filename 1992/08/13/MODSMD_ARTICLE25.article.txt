Comics and Comix in Palo
Alto welcomes its own little
bit of celebrity to the shop
on Tuesday with the visit of John
Byrne, a veritable demigod in the
world of cartoon superheroes.
Byrne, who has been writ
ing/drawing comic books for
more than a decade, sold more
than 1 million copies (in comic
book terms, a gargantuan num
ber) of the first issue in his "Man
of Steel" series, a retelling of Su
perman's origins.

Author of a who's who in
comics (X-Men, Superman, Spi
derman, Batman, Fantastic
Four and more), Byrne might
even offer a sneak peek at his
new work, "Next Men."
. . .I'm so embarrassed. An
astute caller pointed out that
last week's column contained a
factual error regarding Maria
Maples' Broadway debut.
She's performing in"The
Will Rogers Follies" (soon to hit
S.F. on its national tour), not an
other Tony Award winner, "The
Secret Garden." Well, at least I
know someone's reading this.
Speaking of S.F. theater,
"Bar None," the longest-run
ning comedy in the City, claims
that it will close Aug. 29. If you
haven't caught this interactive
murder mystery during its four
year run, you'd better hurry.
.. .I'd like to thank Weekly
Sports Editor Noah Blake for
not handing out his own
"medals" for the recently com
pleted Summer Olympics. It
seems like every television and

sports writer in the entire uni
verse decided to give out cheeky
awards to Bob Costas and
Charles Barkley for being a good
anchor and mouthy athlete, re
spectively.
But if / were to give out an
award of my own, it would be a
Sour Grapes to McDonald's,
who not once gave me a Michael
Jordan cup. Anybody wanna
trade for a few John Stocktons?
. . .A public service an
nouncement of sorts: two popu
lar upcoming concerts have im
portant news for ticket-holders.
A sad day for Deadheads, as
Jerry Garcia is suffering from
exhaustion, forcing the Grateful
Dead to cancel their three
Mountain View shows at the end
of August.
And the mega Guns N'
Roses/Metallica/Faith No More
concert has been moved up a day
to allow them more time to set up
their next show down the road.
I'd hate to be the security guard
working at the Oakland Stadium
the next day when a few hundred
Axl Rose lookalikes show up for
the concert a day late.
Personally, I'm a bit miffed
that the Indigo Girls aren't play
ing any closer than Berkeley
when they pass through the Bay
Area. While Berkeley's Greek
Theatre may hold some fond
memories for me (I saw Euryth
mics and The Go-Gos there dur
ing high school), it's about as
pleasant as Candlestick Park â€”
cold and hard concrete steps to
sit on.

Chris Shuttlesworth, The Week
ly's entertainment editor, would
sit in Candlestick Park for a
whole week if the Giants would
stay.
