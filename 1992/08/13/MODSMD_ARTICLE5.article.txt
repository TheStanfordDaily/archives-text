## Column A 						grad student welcome 
### 
Dear President Casper —
Welcome to Stanford!
I know that many people
have already expressed this senti
ment but I felt that you might like
to know that some members of the
graduate student population here
at Stanford are also happy to meet
you.
More than likely, your office
has been filling you in on various
important issues that face the
campus today. Members of the fac
ulty and staff will present issues
with respect to our budget crisis
and how the loss of funds hurts
their respective departments.
And you will more than likely be
confronted with a barrage of issues
from the more active members of
the Stanford community once they
return from summer break.
But at this time, while the grad
uate population temporarily domi
nates the campus, I thought you
might be interested in hearing from
our "quiet majority" that resides in
the dungeons and hallways of the
various academic departments.
Perhaps I may pique your in
terest in some issues that my fel
low graduate students and I often
think about.
Graduate housing
This is one of the most important
issues that all graduate students
face. While we commend the Uni
versity for reaching the undergrad
uate "holy grail" — four years of
guaranteed housing — a large per
centage of graduate students often
find their housing hopes cast upon a
song and a prayer every year.
Stories abound of doctoral stu
dents storing their worldly belong
ings in the corners of laboratories
while waiting for the magical day
that wait-listed people can enter
into possible graduate housing.
There are also stories of the un
lucky who are faced with the
prospect of devoting as much as
three times the cost of living on
campus to live ofT-campus. And
with the inclusion of domestic
partners, a larger first-year stu
dent population, and the switch
over of previously held graduate
residences, housing slots are be
coming harder and harder to find.
Efforts to modernize graduate
housing are moving at a slow and
plodding pace. It would be nice if
Crothers Memorial and Escondido
Village could move into the 1990s
before the turn of the century.
Deteriorating programs
Programming in the graduate
residences continues to deterio
rate. A few years ago, new gradu
ate students were provided with a
"Graduate Student Welcome"
from the Graduate Studies Office.
With the elimination of the
Graduate Studies Office, the bur
den has been shifted to the academ
ic departments and the residences.
But in the residences, program
monies have decreased to one-third
of what they were three years ago.
If you include the fact that the
number of incoming students has
increased in the last few years, you
may well imagine that program
ming is becoming even less effec
tive than ever. On top of that,
GRA's are being paid a pittance
compared to the services they pro
vide for their residences.
These programs should be as
important in graduate residences
as they are in undergraduate ones.
Academics are not the end-all and
be-all of graduate life.
Health care
This is a primary need since
most, if not all, graduate students
must now face the responsibility of
finding their own health care.
Though the cost of Cowell's in
surance plan has gone up only slight
ly in the past three years, services

from Cowell have been reduced and
treatments that once were covered
in the insurance premium have now
become a paid service.
Financial aid
As with any situation, money is a
root of many evils. Graduate stu
dents find their plans for advanced
degrees often shot down due to lack
of funding from either their depart
ments or the federal government.
I must say that first-year stu
dents are provided with many fi
nancial enticements to come to
Stanford, but continued funding
is often extremely difficult to find.
And with some departments'
budgets cut to the core, it is not sur
prising to see many students disap
pearing after the first year. With
the need for professors and ad
vanced degrees ever increasing in
the United States, can you find
some way to address this issue?
Facilities
When I first arrived at Stanford,
I was impressed with the facilities
and access I had to the various li
braries and computer clusters.
But with the budget cuts in the
last three years, hours have been
restricted and funding has been
reduced to a point that hurts the
many programs that utilize the li
braries as their laboratories.
How can a university that so
prides itself on its forward think
ing maintain a library system that
is slowly but surely slipping into
obsolescence? How can papers and
theses be completed when entire
public access computer clusters
are being closed down at prime
working hours (at least prime
graduate student hours)?
Academic diversity
Quality of education is an issue
no different than an undergradu
ate student's need, but it is an im
portant one to point out.
The dilution and dissolution of
various programs in Humanities
and Sciences is not healthy to the
academic fiber or life of our com
munity. Please make an effort to
maintain the academic diversity
that makes Stanford great — Sci
ences without Humanities makes
for very cold walls.
I know these are issues that can
be seen in universities across the na
tion and abroad, but they are very
important to us. We are aware of the
budget crisis that the University has
faced and the need for tough choices.
But I wanted you to be aware
that graduate students are affected
by these things. Many people think
graduate students are just tran
sient members of the community
— whether here for a single year to
get a fast master's degree or six
years to complete a doctorate.
We are contributing members
of the Stanford community as well
and would like to have our issues
addressed as much as the more vo
ciferous members. We are quiet,
but we are also concerned. Please
do not forget us.

campus to live ofT-campus. And
with the inclusion of domestic
partners, a larger first-year stu
dent population, and the switch
over of previously held graduate
residences, housing slots are be
coming harder and harder to find.
Efforts to modernize graduate
housing are moving at a slow and
plodding pace. It would be nice if
Crothers Memorial and Escondido
Village could move into the 1990s
before the turn of the century.
Deteriorating programs
Programming in the graduate
residences continues to deterio
rate. A few years ago, new gradu
ate students were provided with a
"Graduate Student Welcome"
from the Graduate Studies Office.
With the elimination of the
Graduate Studies Office, the bur
den has been shifted to the academ
ic departments and the residences.
But in the residences, program
monies have decreased to one-third
of what they were three years ago.
If you include the fact that the
number of incoming students has
increased in the last few years, you
may well imagine that program
ming is becoming even less effec
tive than ever. On top of that,
GRA's are being paid a pittance
compared to the services they pro
vide for their residences.
These programs should be as
important in graduate residences
as they are in undergraduate ones.
Academics are not the end-all and
be-all of graduate life.
Health care
This is a primary need since
most, if not all, graduate students
must now face the responsibility of
finding their own health care.
Though the cost of Cowell's in
surance plan has gone up only slight
ly in the past three years, services

from Cowell have been reduced and
treatments that once were covered
in the insurance premium have now
become a paid service.
Financial aid
As with any situation, money is a
root of many evils. Graduate stu
dents find their plans for advanced
degrees often shot down due to lack
of funding from either their depart
ments or the federal government.
I must say that first-year stu
dents are provided with many fi
nancial enticements to come to
Stanford, but continued funding
is often extremely difficult to find.
And with some departments'
budgets cut to the core, it is not sur
prising to see many students disap
pearing after the first year. With
the need for professors and ad
vanced degrees ever increasing in
the United States, can you find
some way to address this issue?
Facilities
When I first arrived at Stanford,
I was impressed with the facilities
and access I had to the various li
braries and computer clusters.
But with the budget cuts in the
last three years, hours have been
restricted and funding has been
reduced to a point that hurts the
many programs that utilize the li
braries as their laboratories.
How can a university that so
prides itself on its forward think
ing maintain a library system that
is slowly but surely slipping into
obsolescence? How can papers and
theses be completed when entire
public access computer clusters
are being closed down at prime
working hours (at least prime
graduate student hours)?
Academic diversity
Quality of education is an issue
no different than an undergradu
ate student's need, but it is an im
portant one to point out.
The dilution and dissolution of
various programs in Humanities
and Sciences is not healthy to the
academic fiber or life of our com
munity. Please make an effort to
maintain the academic diversity
that makes Stanford great — Sci
ences without Humanities makes
for very cold walls.
I know these are issues that can
be seen in universities across the na
tion and abroad, but they are very
important to us. We are aware of the
budget crisis that the University has
faced and the need for tough choices.
But I wanted you to be aware
that graduate students are affected
by these things. Many people think
graduate students are just tran
sient members of the community
— whether here for a single year to
get a fast master's degree or six
years to complete a doctorate.
We are contributing members
of the Stanford community as well
and would like to have our issues
addressed as much as the more vo
ciferous members. We are quiet,
but we are also concerned. Please
do not forget us.

Dear President Casper —
Welcome to Stanford!
I know that many people
have already expressed this senti
ment but I felt that you might like
to know that some members of the
graduate student population here
at Stanford are also happy to meet
you.
More than likely, your office
has been filling you in on various
important issues that face the
campus today. Members of the fac
ulty and staff will present issues
with respect to our budget crisis
and how the loss of funds hurts
their respective departments.
And you will more than likely be
confronted with a barrage of issues
from the more active members of
the Stanford community once they
return from summer break.
But at this time, while the grad
uate population temporarily domi
nates the campus, I thought you
might be interested in hearing from
our "quiet majority" that resides in
the dungeons and hallways of the
various academic departments.
Perhaps I may pique your in
terest in some issues that my fel
low graduate students and I often
think about.
Graduate housing
This is one of the most important
issues that all graduate students
face. While we commend the Uni
versity for reaching the undergrad
uate "holy grail" — four years of
guaranteed housing — a large per
centage of graduate students often
find their housing hopes cast upon a
song and a prayer every year.
Stories abound of doctoral stu
dents storing their worldly belong
ings in the corners of laboratories
while waiting for the magical day
that wait-listed people can enter
into possible graduate housing.
There are also stories of the un
lucky who are faced with the
prospect of devoting as much as
three times the cost of living on
campus to live ofT-campus. And
with the inclusion of domestic
partners, a larger first-year stu
dent population, and the switch
over of previously held graduate
residences, housing slots are be
coming harder and harder to find.
Efforts to modernize graduate
housing are moving at a slow and
plodding pace. It would be nice if
Crothers Memorial and Escondido
Village could move into the 1990s
before the turn of the century.
