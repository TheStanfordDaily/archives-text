## The 						task: Ferreting out mediocre teaching 
### 
WHEN DONALD KENNEDY took office in
1980, he pledged the "reformation" of under
graduate education at Stanford. While that
may be too grand a word to describe what has actual
ly happened during Kennedy's tenure, the quality of
teaching has certainly improved.
That improvement is due, in large part, to the pub
lic emphasis that Kennedy has placed on the impor
tance of teaching. By planting his weight as president
firmly behind a long-neglected facet of the University,
Kennedy pushed through initiatives that have led to
stronger academic counseling, more honors programs
and more minority programs for undergraduates.
But that does not mean the job is done. The quali
ty of teaching, while better than it was 12 years ago,
remains spotty. All too often, the value of a student's
Stanford education depends on ephemeral factors
that should matter little — the section or the quarter
in which a class is taken, the professor teaching it, the
amount of time the professor has to do thoughtful
grading and provide the feedback necessary for stu
dents to improve.
If Stanford is to become the kind of top-notch in
stitution in teaching that it has already become in re
search, it must continue to carefully scrutinize what
it does well, along with working to improve what can
undeniably be made better.
Kennedy's successor, Gerhard Casper, has taken a
solid course by immediately making a public commit
ment to ferreting out poor teaching. Even an institu
tion like Stanford, he said in his first press confer
ence, "can be mediocre in some ways."
Casper, who formed a council that examined com
mon teaching problems at the University of Chicago,
would be well-advised to begin his chores at Stanford in
the area of professor-student feedback. It is an area
that Kennedy, in his inaugural address, called the
"thoughtful criticism of ideas" — and unfortunately,

there is still not enough of it in many Stanford courses.
In too many cases, professors and teaching assis
tants — either harried, lazy or indifferent — write no
comments on papers or written exams. Just receiving
a grade, or simply the word "good" scribbled next to a
"B," tells students nothing about their performance
or ways to improve it. In order to truly provide stu
dents with a quality education, constructive criticism
and feedback is an absolute necessity.
More writing requirements would be another pos
itive step. In some Stanford courses, students can get
away with taking only a midterm and a final. Individ
ual departments should move toward requiring more
writing-intensive courses.
The most effective way to develop a broad under
standing of issues, in a way that the memory will re
tain long after the facts and statistics are forgotten, is
through developing theses and supporting them in
writing. A lot of writing.
Another problem, one that math and science
courses particularly suffer from, is consistency. Un
fortunately, the amount of material covered in the
same course, from quarter to quarter, varies widely.
Departments should create guidelines that lay out
the scope of each class, so that students who take a
class, no matter what the quarter, can be assured
that they will receive the preparation necessary to
move to the higher levels.
Like Kennedy, Casper's task will be to find the
mediocrities in teaching — and eliminate them.
These are just a few suggestions, but it will be
Casper's obligation to find more of the mediocrities,
through talking with faculty, meeting with students
and relying on his own observations.
Casper has the ability to make Stanford deliver on
its promise of undergraduate education. What it will
take is patience, and a willingness to use the presi
dent's power of persuasion to make sure it happens.
