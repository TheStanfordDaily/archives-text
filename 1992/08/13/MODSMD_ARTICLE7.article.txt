Wild cacophony of
voices there if you
open up your ears
It is unfortunate that Tariq
Bujsaim (column, Aug. 6) feels sti
fled by Residential Education and
the so-called "political correct
ness" of Stanford. But perhaps
Tariq should examine himself and
the things that are making him
uncomfortable more closely.
He notes that upon asking,
"What's wrong with being pro-life,"
the people whom he addressed pro
ceeded to lecture him "on the evils
of pro-lifers."
Sometimes students tend to be
a little too ready to debate issues.
However, someone who proffers
an opinion, especially on a vital
issue where many strong opinions
abound, should be ready to de
fend his or her viewpoint.
Or perhaps he or she should
eat lunch silently. The idea of tol
erating diversity does not mean
that the University should en
courage a bland, mindless, silent

acceptance of any and every view.
I have heard too many people
whine, complain and accuse some
vague, undefined "political cor
rectness" of preventing them from
expressing their opinions.
However, these people often
fail to realize that one of the pur
poses of education is not only to
have an opinion, but also to be
able to explain and defend it.
I find that many people who
feel themselves stifled by the Uni
versity's "left-leaning agenda" of
sensitizing students to issues of
race, gender and sexual orienta
tion often have difficulty defend
ing their own beliefs and fears.
An important complement to
having your opinions accepted is
the willingness to examine, de
bate and change them. And yes,
sometimes the process hurts.
It is true that there are many
opinions that are strongly dis
couraged. As far as I know, Resi
dential Education has never ac
tively encouraged anyone to advo
cate slavery. Nor has the Univer
sity opened its doors to speakers
from the Nazi party. I would agree
that these more barbaric views

are stifled here. I don't miss them.
On the other hand, I have yet
to see either the University or
Residential Education endorse
any clear, specific ideology. Tariq
vaguely claims that Stanford sup
ports a "left-leaning agenda" and
"political correctness."
But Tariq refuses to specify what
he means by "left," and certainly
fails to define "center." Nor does he
define "political correctness," a term
used so often, in so many contradic
tory ways, that it has become a
meaningless buzzword. Instead, the
University that I know contains the
conservative voices of the Stanford
Review, as well as the feminist voic
es of the Critical Bitch.
The Residential Education
that I know has invited both the
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Speak
ers Bureau, and the Campus Cru
sade for Christ to dormitories.
Rather than whine about some
phantom political correctness,
Tariq should open up his ears to
the wild and fantastic cacophony of
arguing and conflicting voices avail
able to him and his fellow students.
