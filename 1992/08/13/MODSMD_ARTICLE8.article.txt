## Ari Cartun Victims' cries must be answered; Stop the slaughter 
### 
We at Hillel were shocked and
outraged to learn that the United
States has known about the geno
cide currently taking place in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia
"for weeks and months," and yet
did nothing of substance to stop
it.
This willful turning away from
the cries of victims of the new
death camps is a nightmarish re
minder of the time our govern
ment knew of Auschwitz and yet
did nothing — not even bomb the
railroad tracks — to slow down or
stop the holocaust.
The world should have learned

-50 years ago that mere 'verbal
condemnation' does nothing but
inspire contempt from the archi
tects of the evil ominously de
scribed here as "ethnic cleans
ing."
It is our moral obligation as
citizens of the nation that sees it
self as an example to the world to
do all in our power to stop this
murder from continuing.
We believe that it is the United
States' moral duty to take the
lead in organizing whatever ac
tion — including military action
— is necessary to put an immedi
ate end to the forced transporta

tion of civilians to concentration
camps and the mass killings of
civilians.
The administration has recent
ly demonstrated its ability to as
semble a multinational force and
this skill should be employed to
recruit NATO and the United Na
tions to join forces to bring an end
to these atrocities.
Even if the administration is
unsuccessful in recruiting such a
force, however, the United States
must do it alone or lose any claim
to moral leadership in the world.
We must speak out vigorously
and repeatedly until we can per

suade our nation to end these
abominations. Economic sanc
tions do not work well enough or
fast enough.
Surely if we could mobilize Op
eration Desert Storm, when the
moral imperative was not nearly
so clear, we can galvanize one for
this series of concentration camps
and village massacres: overt
avowed genocide under the evil
euphemism of "ethnic cleansing."
"Clean" in German is "rein";
hence the word "Juden-rein "
meant "cleansed of Jews." The
Serbs are simply saying "Muslim
rein " and "Croat-rein."
