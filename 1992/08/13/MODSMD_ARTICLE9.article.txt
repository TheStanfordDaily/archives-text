# Dingila's medicine man
## A 						Stanford Library specialist establishes a relief foundation to replenish empty medical supply shelves at his brothers hospital in Zaire 
### Grace Lee Editorial staff 
When Hoover Library staff
member Abdul Rahman Oki
tukunda visited his brother's
hospital in Zaire two years ago, he found
the sick beds full and the medicine
shelves empty.
After going on a complete tour of the
Dingila Community Hospital, and wit
nessing firsthand the lack of medical sup
plies like aspirin and common vaccines,
Okitukunda immediately decided he had
to help.
So he set up the Dingila Health Foun
dation, a non-profit relief organization
that provides direct aid to the isolated
hospital where his younger brother
Atoko is a doctor.
The foundation solicits donations of
basic medical supplies from health
organizations and other companies and
then ships them directly to the hospital.
"What I saw with my own eyes ....
that's what really gave me the courage to
go about trying to create the founda
tion," Okitukunda says.
Atoko is one of only two doctors at the
hospital, which usually has about 40 or
50 patients in its care. Serving a commu
nity of about 200,000 people, the hospital
is the only one within a 220-mile radius.
In addition to being "overwhelmed by
the amount of work," Okitukunda says,
the doctors are also "overwhelmed by the
lack of [medical supplies] to make their
job possible."
What little equipment they have is old,
increasing the difficulty of the doctors'
jobs, Okitukunda says. For example,
"one [electrical] generator is supposed to
run the whole hospital. But you don't
know if that generator's going to go out
on you while you operate on somebody."
Okitukunda recalls the rows of empty
supply shelves and sparsely furnished
hospital rooms in which many patients
lie on the floor for lack of adequate bed
ding. Of the hospital's 120 beds, many
are mere metal frames, lacking every
thing from blankets and sheets to mat
tresses, he says.
"These conditions are extremely de
pressing. But they will not be on the press
anywhere," says Okitukunda. "Nobody
has been there; nobody will talk about
it."
However, for himself, the memory of
these scenes serves as the sole motivation
for his current efforts.
What "got me very, very an
noyed," Okitukunda says,
"is that children die of things
like diarrhea" and other maladies which
are easily curable or preventable with the
proper vaccines or medications. Atoko's
son died of diarrhea at age 2, while the
doctor was away at a neighboring village
making a housecall.
One of Okitukunda's two children was
also facing medical problems a few years
ago. But, with access to American med
ical care, he received proper treatment.
"Now he can talk, walk and do things
that [doctors] said he would not be able to
do," Okitukunda beams gratefully. "If he
was somewhere else, he'd be dead right
now."
"What I'm doing is really an extension
of the miracle I saw from him," Oki
tukunda says. "So if I can help another
child somewhere who doesn't have the
same chance he had, that to me is a goal
worth pursuing."
For the past year and a half, Okitukun
da has buried himself in the process of
legally establishing a non-profit organiza
tion, filling out paperwork and using a
substantial portion of each paycheck to
pay for a different application fee.
For example, with one check, he paid
for an IRS application for tax-exempt sta
tus. Then he waited for his next paycheck
to send his next application.
"I'm now at the point where I've been
granted exemptions," he says with relief.
"Even though I didn't have the money to
do this, I just went out and did the best I
could."
He has received help and guidance
from a few friends on his project and has

attended seminars on how to run non
profit organizations. "But it takes more
than just going to seminars," he admits,
saying that he would welcome any advice
or suggestions he could get on how to
conduct his organization.
Okitukunda, who has been employed
at Hoover for the past five years, is con
sidering eventually devoting himself to
the foundation full-time.
He is adamant about establishing "di
rect contact" with the community and
the hospital, rather than going through
the Zaire government. He expresses
strong doubt that the medicines would
arrive at the hospital if

they were sent
through government
officials.
"I do not want my
effort to go to the gov
ernment," he says de
fiantly. "If I get one
pound of aspirin, I
want that one pound of
aspirin to go directly to
the hospital."
The hospital, which
lies about 100 miles
from where Okitukun-

da and his three brothers grew up, was
formerly run by the government.
But since 1985, when the government de
cided to stop funding state hospitals, it
has had to find its own funds to sustain
itself.
"The government is basically broke,"
explains Okitukunda.
Zaire, which used to be known as the
Belgian Congo, became independent in
1960. Since 1965, the central African
country has been ruled by President
Mobutu Sese Seko, who took over the
government with a military coup.
When Okitukunda visited his
brother in 1990, he brought
with him two stethoscopes
as a belated medical school graduation
gift for Atoko. He had not seen his
younger brother since 1976, when he left
the country to pursue his education in
Europe. A few years later, he came to the
United States.
As a child, Atoko would always want to
touch the doctor's stethoscope. Still too
young to speak in coherent sentences, he
would eagerly "pat his chest" to commu
nicate his interest to the doctor. Ok i •
tukunda says he was amazed to learn
that Atoko, who had been practicing

'They lack basically
everything. As a doctor,
you can only diagnose,
but you won't be able to
fill the prescription.'

Okitukunda

medicine for several years already, did
not own a stethoscope before his visit.
"They lack basically everything," Oki
tukunda says. "As a doctor, you can only
diagnose, but you won't be able to fill the
prescription.
"If you're lucky, they might have
something to help your condition. If
you're not lucky, they'll give you a pre
scription and you will have to go and find
the medication yourself."
But in Upper Zaire, stores and phar
macies are even rarer finds than the hos
pital. "The patient will usually go and
find something on the black market,"
Okitukunda says

nonchalantly,
explaining that it
is common prac
tice for the iso
lated villagers to
make journeys to
the capital city of
Kinchassa in
order to fill pre
scriptions with
dubious-looking
bottles of medi
cine.
"These are

medications that are not really con
trolled. You don't know what you're buy
ing. You don't know how old it is, if it's
expired," he cautions. "Those are the
risks that you run.
"Things we take for granted here [in
the United States] are hard to come by
there," says Okitukunda.
Deep-set wrinkles appear on his fore
head as Okitukunda explains his broth
er's plight. Atoko, 35, works seven days a
week, often leaving his wife and two chil
dren for days at a time as he makes
housecalls at different villages on his mo
torcycle. Many people cannot afford to go
to the hospital every time they are ill.
But poorly built roads, which are fre
quently washed out by rains, significant
ly increase the doctor's traveling time. By
the time he arrives, it is sometimes "too
late," says Okitukunda.
For his services, Okitukunda's broth
er receives little money. Rather than
"paying" him, his patients give him
"gifts" of food or whatever else they can
afford to give. Bartering is still common
in Dingila, with hard currency a scarce
commodity. The chief of the village once
gave Atoko a 15-acre coffee plantation in
appreciation for the medical care he re
ceived.

Okitukunda spends two hours
each night writing individual
letters to possible medical sup
ply donors, financial contributors and
other prospective partners in his project.
His weekends are spent in a similar way.
When he decided to create the relief
foundation, Okitukunda surrendered his
leisure time. He used to go dancing occa
sionally, but now Okitukunda cannot re
member the last time he went. But he has
found the switch of priorities rewarding.
In response to the many letters he has
sent out all across the country, he has re
ceived four replies promising him aid and
supplies on a regular basis. A few other
organizations have said they will donate
supplies on the condition that he ship
them immediately to the hospital.
Although he calls the response "very
positive," the difficulty of procuring
funds to ship the supplies has stalled his
efforts. Okitukunda used his own money
to pay for the first shipment in July. In
cluded in the four boxes were supplies
such as aspirin, penicillin and latex
gloves.
He has already collected 10 more boxes
of donated medicines at his house that he
has no money to ship.
"I'm convinced that every donation,
every penicillin, every antibiotic will save
a life," he says, clenching his fists.
"I would like to do this every two
months," says Okitukunda, both resolute
and optimistic about his goal of shipping
at least 40 to 50 pounds of medication di
rectly to his brother's hospital on a regu
lar basis.
And while several other countries in
sub-Saharan Africa, such as Somalia and
Ethiopia, are also in desperate need of re
lief, Okitukunda emphasizes that "the
goal of this organization is to be able to
make a difference even on a small scale."
In naming the foundation, Okitukun
da says he intentionally retained the vil
lage's name, Dingila, as a reminder of the
concentrated scope of the foundation.
"Dingila" means "peaceful" in the Bam
bala dialect.
He says he wants to concentrate his ef
forts specifically on the village of Dingila,
one which he feels very close to and whose
suffering he has observed with his own
eyes.
"I haven't ever thought, 'Oh, I'm going
to help everybody,'" he says. "But if I can
help this one particular hospital, I can
make a difference."

"I'm convinced that every donation,
every penicillin, every antibiotic will save
a life," he says, clenching his fists.
"I would like to do this every two
months," says Okitukunda, both resolute
and optimistic about his goal of shipping
at least 40 to 50 pounds of medication di
rectly to his brother's hospital on a regu
lar basis.
And while several other countries in
sub-Saharan Africa, such as Somalia and
Ethiopia, are also in desperate need of re
lief, Okitukunda emphasizes that "the
goal of this organization is to be able to
make a difference even on a small scale."
In naming the foundation, Okitukun
da says he intentionally retained the vil
lage's name, Dingila, as a reminder of the
concentrated scope of the foundation.
"Dingila" means "peaceful" in the Bam
bala dialect.
He says he wants to concentrate his ef
forts specifically on the village of Dingila,
one which he feels very close to and whose
suffering he has observed with his own
eyes.
"I haven't ever thought, 'Oh, I'm going
to help everybody,'" he says. "But if I can
help this one particular hospital, I can
make a difference."

Without adequate funds to ship recently donated medical supplies to Zaire, Hoover Library staff member Abdul Rahman Oki
tukunda finds temporary storage space in his house. Okitukunda paid for the first shipment in July with his own money.
When Hoover Library staff
member Abdul Rahman Oki
tukunda visited his brother's
hospital in Zaire two years ago, he found
the sick beds full and the medicine
shelves empty.
After going on a complete tour of the
Dingila Community Hospital, and wit
nessing firsthand the lack of medical sup
plies like aspirin and common vaccines,
Okitukunda immediately decided he had
to help.
So he set up the Dingila Health Foun
dation, a non-profit relief organization
that provides direct aid to the isolated
hospital where his younger brother
Atoko is a doctor.
The foundation solicits donations of
basic medical supplies from health
organizations and other companies and
then ships them directly to the hospital.
"What I saw with my own eyes ....
that's what really gave me the courage to
go about trying to create the founda
tion," Okitukunda says.
Atoko is one of only two doctors at the
hospital, which usually has about 40 or
50 patients in its care. Serving a commu
nity of about 200,000 people, the hospital
is the only one within a 220-mile radius.
In addition to being "overwhelmed by
the amount of work," Okitukunda says,
the doctors are also "overwhelmed by the
lack of [medical supplies] to make their
job possible."
What little equipment they have is old,
increasing the difficulty of the doctors'
jobs, Okitukunda says. For example,
"one [electrical] generator is supposed to
run the whole hospital. But you don't
know if that generator's going to go out
on you while you operate on somebody."
Okitukunda recalls the rows of empty
supply shelves and sparsely furnished
hospital rooms in which many patients
lie on the floor for lack of adequate bed
ding. Of the hospital's 120 beds, many
are mere metal frames, lacking every
thing from blankets and sheets to mat
tresses, he says.
"These conditions are extremely de
pressing. But they will not be on the press
anywhere," says Okitukunda. "Nobody
has been there; nobody will talk about
it."
However, for himself, the memory of
these scenes serves as the sole motivation
for his current efforts.
What "got me very, very an
noyed," Okitukunda says,
"is that children die of things
like diarrhea" and other maladies which
are easily curable or preventable with the
proper vaccines or medications. Atoko's
son died of diarrhea at age 2, while the
doctor was away at a neighboring village
making a housecall.
One of Okitukunda's two children was
also facing medical problems a few years
ago. But, with access to American med
ical care, he received proper treatment.
"Now he can talk, walk and do things
that [doctors] said he would not be able to
do," Okitukunda beams gratefully. "If he
was somewhere else, he'd be dead right
now."
"What I'm doing is really an extension
of the miracle I saw from him," Oki
tukunda says. "So if I can help another
child somewhere who doesn't have the
same chance he had, that to me is a goal
worth pursuing."
For the past year and a half, Okitukun
da has buried himself in the process of
legally establishing a non-profit organiza
tion, filling out paperwork and using a
substantial portion of each paycheck to
pay for a different application fee.
For example, with one check, he paid
for an IRS application for tax-exempt sta
tus. Then he waited for his next paycheck
to send his next application.
"I'm now at the point where I've been
granted exemptions," he says with relief.
"Even though I didn't have the money to
do this, I just went out and did the best I
could."
He has received help and guidance
from a few friends on his project and has

attended seminars on how to run non
profit organizations. "But it takes more
than just going to seminars," he admits,
saying that he would welcome any advice
or suggestions he could get on how to
conduct his organization.
Okitukunda, who has been employed
at Hoover for the past five years, is con
sidering eventually devoting himself to
the foundation full-time.
He is adamant about establishing "di
rect contact" with the community and
the hospital, rather than going through
the Zaire government. He expresses
strong doubt that the medicines would
arrive at the hospital if

they were sent
through government
officials.
"I do not want my
effort to go to the gov
ernment," he says de
fiantly. "If I get one
pound of aspirin, I
want that one pound of
aspirin to go directly to
the hospital."
The hospital, which
lies about 100 miles
from where Okitukun-

da and his three brothers grew up, was
formerly run by the government.
But since 1985, when the government de
cided to stop funding state hospitals, it
has had to find its own funds to sustain
itself.
"The government is basically broke,"
explains Okitukunda.
Zaire, which used to be known as the
Belgian Congo, became independent in
1960. Since 1965, the central African
country has been ruled by President
Mobutu Sese Seko, who took over the
government with a military coup.
When Okitukunda visited his
brother in 1990, he brought
with him two stethoscopes
as a belated medical school graduation
gift for Atoko. He had not seen his
younger brother since 1976, when he left
the country to pursue his education in
Europe. A few years later, he came to the
United States.
As a child, Atoko would always want to
touch the doctor's stethoscope. Still too
young to speak in coherent sentences, he
would eagerly "pat his chest" to commu
nicate his interest to the doctor. Ok i •
tukunda says he was amazed to learn
that Atoko, who had been practicing

'They lack basically
everything. As a doctor,
you can only diagnose,
but you won't be able to
fill the prescription.'
— Abdul Rahman
Okitukunda

medicine for several years already, did
not own a stethoscope before his visit.
"They lack basically everything," Oki
tukunda says. "As a doctor, you can only
diagnose, but you won't be able to fill the
prescription.
"If you're lucky, they might have
something to help your condition. If
you're not lucky, they'll give you a pre
scription and you will have to go and find
the medication yourself."
But in Upper Zaire, stores and phar
macies are even rarer finds than the hos
pital. "The patient will usually go and
find something on the black market,"
Okitukunda says

nonchalantly,
explaining that it
is common prac
tice for the iso
lated villagers to
make journeys to
the capital city of
Kinchassa in
order to fill pre
scriptions with
dubious-looking
bottles of medi
cine.
"These are

medications that are not really con
trolled. You don't know what you're buy
ing. You don't know how old it is, if it's
expired," he cautions. "Those are the
risks that you run.
"Things we take for granted here [in
the United States] are hard to come by
there," says Okitukunda.
Deep-set wrinkles appear on his fore
head as Okitukunda explains his broth
er's plight. Atoko, 35, works seven days a
week, often leaving his wife and two chil
dren for days at a time as he makes
housecalls at different villages on his mo
torcycle. Many people cannot afford to go
to the hospital every time they are ill.
But poorly built roads, which are fre
quently washed out by rains, significant
ly increase the doctor's traveling time. By
the time he arrives, it is sometimes "too
late," says Okitukunda.
For his services, Okitukunda's broth
er receives little money. Rather than
"paying" him, his patients give him
"gifts" of food or whatever else they can
afford to give. Bartering is still common
in Dingila, with hard currency a scarce
commodity. The chief of the village once
gave Atoko a 15-acre coffee plantation in
appreciation for the medical care he re
ceived.

Okitukunda spends two hours
each night writing individual
letters to possible medical sup
ply donors, financial contributors and
other prospective partners in his project.
His weekends are spent in a similar way.
When he decided to create the relief
foundation, Okitukunda surrendered his
leisure time. He used to go dancing occa
sionally, but now Okitukunda cannot re
member the last time he went. But he has
found the switch of priorities rewarding.
In response to the many letters he has
sent out all across the country, he has re
ceived four replies promising him aid and
supplies on a regular basis. A few other
organizations have said they will donate
supplies on the condition that he ship
them immediately to the hospital.
Although he calls the response "very
positive," the difficulty of procuring
funds to ship the supplies has stalled his
efforts. Okitukunda used his own money
to pay for the first shipment in July. In
cluded in the four boxes were supplies
such as aspirin, penicillin and latex
gloves.
He has already collected 10 more boxes
of donated medicines at his house that he
has no money to ship.
"I'm convinced that every donation,
every penicillin, every antibiotic will save
a life," he says, clenching his fists.

afford to give. Bartering is still common
in Dingila, with hard currency a scarce
commodity. The chief of the village once

appreciation for the medical care he re
ceived.

Okitukunda spends two hours
each night writing individual
letters to possible medical sup
ply donors, financial contributors and
other prospective partners in his project.
His weekends are spent in a similar way.
When he decided to create the relief

leisure time. He used to go dancing occa

found the switch of priorities rewarding.
In response to the many letters he has
sent out all across the country, he has re
ceived four replies promising him aid and
supplies on a regular basis. A few other
organizations have said they will donate
supplies on the condition that he ship
them immediately to the hospital.
Although he calls the response "very
positive," the difficulty of procuring
funds to ship the supplies has stalled his
efforts. Okitukunda used his own money
to pay for the first shipment in July. In
cluded in the four boxes were supplies
such as aspirin, penicillin and latex
gloves.

has no money to ship.
"I'm convinced that every donation,
every penicillin, every antibiotic will save

and optimistic about his goal of shipping
at least 40 to 50 pounds of medication di
rectly to his brother's hospital on a regu

sub-Saharan Africa, such as Somalia and
Ethiopia, are also in desperate need of re

In naming the foundation, Okitukun
da says he intentionally retained the vil
lage's name, Dingila, as a reminder of the

"Dingila" means "peaceful" in the Bam
bala dialect.
He says he wants to concentrate his ef
forts specifically on the village of Dingila,
one which he feels very close to and whose
suffering he has observed with his own
eyes.
"I haven't ever thought, 'Oh, I'm going
to help everybody,'" he says. "But if I can
help this one particular hospital, I can
make a difference."

Without adequate funds to ship recently donated medical supplies to Zaire, Hoover Library staff member Abdul Rahman Oki
tukunda finds temporary storage space in his house. Okitukunda paid for the first shipment in July with his own money.
When Hoover Library staff
member Abdul Rahman Oki
tukunda visited his brother's
hospital in Zaire two years ago, he found
the sick beds full and the medicine
shelves empty.
After going on a complete tour of the
Dingila Community Hospital, and wit
nessing firsthand the lack of medical sup
plies like aspirin and common vaccines,
Okitukunda immediately decided he had
to help.
So he set up the Dingila Health Foun
dation, a non-profit relief organization
that provides direct aid to the isolated
hospital where his younger brother
Atoko is a doctor.
The foundation solicits donations of
basic medical supplies from health
organizations and other companies and
then ships them directly to the hospital.
"What I saw with my own eyes ....
that's what really gave me the courage to
go about trying to create the founda
tion," Okitukunda says.
Atoko is one of only two doctors at the
hospital, which usually has about 40 or
50 patients in its care. Serving a commu
nity of about 200,000 people, the hospital
is the only one within a 220-mile radius.
In addition to being "overwhelmed by
the amount of work," Okitukunda says,
the doctors are also "overwhelmed by the
lack of [medical supplies] to make their
job possible."
What little equipment they have is old,
increasing the difficulty of the doctors'
jobs, Okitukunda says. For example,
"one [electrical] generator is supposed to
run the whole hospital. But you don't
know if that generator's going to go out
on you while you operate on somebody."
Okitukunda recalls the rows of empty
supply shelves and sparsely furnished
hospital rooms in which many patients
lie on the floor for lack of adequate bed
ding. Of the hospital's 120 beds, many
are mere metal frames, lacking every
thing from blankets and sheets to mat
tresses, he says.
"These conditions are extremely de
pressing. But they will not be on the press
anywhere," says Okitukunda. "Nobody
has been there; nobody will talk about
it."
However, for himself, the memory of
these scenes serves as the sole motivation
for his current efforts.
What "got me very, very an
noyed," Okitukunda says,
"is that children die of things
like diarrhea" and other maladies which
are easily curable or preventable with the
proper vaccines or medications. Atoko's
son died of diarrhea at age 2, while the
doctor was away at a neighboring village
making a housecall.
One of Okitukunda's two children was
also facing medical problems a few years
ago. But, with access to American med
ical care, he received proper treatment.
"Now he can talk, walk and do things
that [doctors] said he would not be able to
do," Okitukunda beams gratefully. "If he
was somewhere else, he'd be dead right
now."
"What I'm doing is really an extension
of the miracle I saw from him," Oki
tukunda says. "So if I can help another
child somewhere who doesn't have the
same chance he had, that to me is a goal
worth pursuing."
For the past year and a half, Okitukun
da has buried himself in the process of
legally establishing a non-profit organiza
tion, filling out paperwork and using a
substantial portion of each paycheck to
pay for a different application fee.
For example, with one check, he paid
for an IRS application for tax-exempt sta
tus. Then he waited for his next paycheck
to send his next application.
"I'm now at the point where I've been
granted exemptions," he says with relief.
"Even though I didn't have the money to
do this, I just went out and did the best I
could."
He has received help and guidance
from a few friends on his project and has

attended seminars on how to run non
profit organizations. "But it takes more
than just going to seminars," he admits,
saying that he would welcome any advice
or suggestions he could get on how to
conduct his organization.
Okitukunda, who has been employed
at Hoover for the past five years, is con
sidering eventually devoting himself to
the foundation full-time.
He is adamant about establishing "di
rect contact" with the community and
the hospital, rather than going through
the Zaire government. He expresses
strong doubt that the medicines would
arrive at the hospital if

they were sent
through government
officials.
"I do not want my
effort to go to the gov
ernment," he says de
fiantly. "If I get one
pound of aspirin, I
want that one pound of
aspirin to go directly to
the hospital."
The hospital, which
lies about 100 miles
from where Okitukun-

da and his three brothers grew up, was
formerly run by the government.
But since 1985, when the government de
cided to stop funding state hospitals, it
has had to find its own funds to sustain
itself.
"The government is basically broke,"
explains Okitukunda.
Zaire, which used to be known as the
Belgian Congo, became independent in
1960. Since 1965, the central African
country has been ruled by President
Mobutu Sese Seko, who took over the
government with a military coup.
When Okitukunda visited his
brother in 1990, he brought
with him two stethoscopes
as a belated medical school graduation
gift for Atoko. He had not seen his
younger brother since 1976, when he left
the country to pursue his education in
Europe. A few years later, he came to the
United States.
As a child, Atoko would always want to
touch the doctor's stethoscope. Still too
young to speak in coherent sentences, he
would eagerly "pat his chest" to commu
nicate his interest to the doctor. Ok i •
tukunda says he was amazed to learn
that Atoko, who had been practicing

'They lack basically
everything. As a doctor,
you can only diagnose,
but you won't be able to
fill the prescription.'
— Abdul Rahman
Okitukunda

medicine for several years already, did
not own a stethoscope before his visit.
"They lack basically everything," Oki
tukunda says. "As a doctor, you can only
diagnose, but you won't be able to fill the
prescription.
"If you're lucky, they might have
something to help your condition. If
you're not lucky, they'll give you a pre
scription and you will have to go and find
the medication yourself."
But in Upper Zaire, stores and phar
macies are even rarer finds than the hos
pital. "The patient will usually go and
find something on the black market,"
Okitukunda says

nonchalantly,
explaining that it
is common prac
tice for the iso
lated villagers to
make journeys to
the capital city of
Kinchassa in
order to fill pre
scriptions with
dubious-looking
bottles of medi
cine.
"These are

medications that are not really con
trolled. You don't know what you're buy
ing. You don't know how old it is, if it's
expired," he cautions. "Those are the
risks that you run.
"Things we take for granted here [in
the United States] are hard to come by
there," says Okitukunda.
Deep-set wrinkles appear on his fore
head as Okitukunda explains his broth
er's plight. Atoko, 35, works seven days a
week, often leaving his wife and two chil
dren for days at a time as he makes
housecalls at different villages on his mo
torcycle. Many people cannot afford to go
to the hospital every time they are ill.
But poorly built roads, which are fre
quently washed out by rains, significant
ly increase the doctor's traveling time. By
the time he arrives, it is sometimes "too
late," says Okitukunda.
For his services, Okitukunda's broth
er receives little money. Rather than
"paying" him, his patients give him
"gifts" of food or whatever else they can
afford to give. Bartering is still common
in Dingila, with hard currency a scarce
commodity. The chief of the village once
gave Atoko a 15-acre coffee plantation in
appreciation for the medical care he re
ceived.

each night writing individual
