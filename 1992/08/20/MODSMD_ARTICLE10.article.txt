# SLAC progresses with Z particles
## 
### 
The Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center recently became the
first research facility in the world
able to generate Z particles using a
polarized beam.
The heaviest elementary parti
cles ever discovered, Z particles
are produced by clashing a beam of
polarized electrons with an unpo
larized beam of positrons, the an
tiparticles of electrons.
While other linear colliders
around the world can also produce
Z particles, the Stanford Linear
Collider's use of the polarized
beam has the unique ability to
yield Z particles that "bear the
mark" of being produced by a po
larized electron, said Bill Kirk, as

sistant to the director at SLAC.
Even after these Z particles
have decayed into other particles
— which happens very rapidly —
he said the particles can still be
recognized as having been pro
duced by polarized electrons.
Study of the marked Z particles
should help scientists confirm
their present understanding of the
Standard Model of particle
physics, a theory that contends
that the universe is composed sole
ly of about 12 particles that inter
act with each other in a set num
ber of ways, Kirk said.
SLAC produced the first Z par
ticle using the polarized beam of
electrons earlier this spring. But
the international team of about
150 scientists who study Z parti
cles at SLAC wanted to accumu
late more evidence — about
10,000 Z particles — before they
announced their results to the
physics community.
"It's not a question of doing it
once," Kirk said. "We wanted to be
able to do it consistently enough to
make an important physics state
ment."
They unveiled their work at the
26th International Conference on
High Energy Physics earlier this
month in Dallas.
Work on the Z particle at SLAC
began over five years ago, Kirk
said, but for several years the col
lider was "sort of limping along
not doing very well." However,
with gradual improvements, it is
finally performing up to par and
since June, the collider's perfor
mance has been "going like gang
busters," Kirk said.
"The machine doesn't work
very well unless beams of particles
are incredibly small — having a
cross-section 10 times smaller
than the diameter of human hair,"
he explained. "Getting beams to be
so small, and then getting them to
collide with each other is techno
logically very hard."
Kirk said many of his physics
colleagues are "astounded that it
works at all, let alone that it works
pretty well."
Scientists at SLAC are now
working on ways to increase the
production rate of Z particles from
about 20 per hour to about 50.
While SLAC's unique ability
does not automatically translate
into increased future funding for
SLAC projects, Kirk called the
new production capacity "a feath-
Erin our cap."
Kirk said SLAC's method of
producing the Z particle will likely
create "a special little niche that
we can fill" in the international
physics community.
