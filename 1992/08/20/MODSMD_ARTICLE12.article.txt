## Spinal disorder study funded 
### 
A team of Medical School re
searchers has received a $1 million
grant from the National Institute
of Health to study syringomyelia,
a mysterious spinal cord malfor
mation that weakens muscle tis
sue and leads to a loss of sensation
and touch.
By studying a sub-population of
patients who have a type of mal
formation called Chiari I, the re
searchers hope to improve treat
ment, and ultimately attempt to
predict which patients may devel
op syringomyelia.
"We're not talking about pre
venting cancer or curing heart dis
ease," said Assoc. Radiology Prof.
Norbert Pelc, a co-investigator in
the study. He noted that the num
ber of Chiari I patients nationwide
is "very small."
Hut by studying only those pa
tients, he and his co-investigator,
Radiology Prof. Dieter Enzmann,
hope to "learn some things that
have more widespread applicabili
ty" about how to treat and prevent
syringomyelia, Pelc said.
"The important thing about it
is it's curable, if you catch it early
enough," Enzmann said.
In syringomyelia, a cyst or cavi
ty — called a syrinx — forms in the
brain stem or at the top of the
spinal cord. The cavity gradually
expands, filling with cerebrovas
cular fluid, eventually damaging
nerve fibers.
The Chiari I malformation ob
structs spinal fluid flow at the base
of the skull where it connects to
the spine. In recent years, the de
velopment of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) has made the accu
rate diagnosis and study of the dis
ease easier.
"There is absolutely no doubt
that there are a lot more syrinxes
than anybody appreciated prior to
MRI," Pelc said. "We're finding all
these syrinxes in people who were
not known to have them."
By studying Chiari I malforma
tion, Enzmann said doctors may
eventually be able to intervene be
fore victims of the debilitating dis
ease become afflicted with its very
severe symptoms.
The first symptoms usually ap
pear in early childhood. Those af
flicted with the disease are unable
to feel pain or temperature
changes in the neck, shoulders or
arms and hands, causing them to
suffer burns and injure them
selves without realizing it.
Victims of the disease also expe
rience a weakening of muscles in
the same region and some loss of
sensation and touch. In its more
advanced stages, the disease caus
es an abnormal stiffness and rigid
ity in the legs, leading to paraple
gia or quadriplegia.
During the four-year study, the
researchers hope to study 50 pa
tients. The federal grant will cover
free MRI scans for the study par
ticipants as well as MRI follow-up
after surgical treatment. When
successful, the surgery, which is
covered by most patients' insur
ance, leads to the collapse of the
cysts.
"It's not that we want to go
after this nit-picky subject, but
when you study science it's impor
tant to make sure you're looking
at one thing," Pelc said. "If we pro
posed to study all syrinxes we
would be open to scientific criti
cism that we were looking at a
whole range of diseases and con
fusing them."
After studying the Chiari I mal
formation, Pelc said, the re
searchers can move to the next
step: applying the lessons learned

from "this one population to the
more general case."
