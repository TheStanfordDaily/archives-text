# Chinese health collection begins
## 
### 
The Health Library at the Stan
ford Shopping Center officially
opened a Chinese language collec
tion Monday evening — the best
collection of its kind in the coun
try, according to Dr. Ruey Sung, a
professor of cardiovascular medi
cine at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter.
Conceived by Sung about eight
months ago, the new collection
will serve the needs of the Bay
Area's large Chinese-speaking
population — estimated by Sung
to be well over 100,000.
The Health Library is a non
profit community service estab
lished by the Stanford Hospital
three years ago.
Sung said that as an immi
grant, he recognized that even
when native Chinese speakers are
relatively fluent in English, they
can still have much difficulty un
derstanding medical books writ
ten in English.
Mary Beth Train, the librarian
at the Health Library, said the col
lection "will provide those who
speak and read Chinese with the
comfort of learning about their or
a relative's illness in a familiar lan
guage."
More than 250 people from the
Bay Area attended the ceremony
Monday night to celebrate the new
collection, Train said. Speakers in
cluded Stanford Medical Center
President Kenneth Bloem and Di
rector of Community Relations
Jeanne Kennedy.
Relying completely on private
donors for financial support, the
Library currently houses 2,100
books and 200 videos, as well as
600 clipping files and 90 newslet
ters, journals, and periodicals. The
books range from general press
books on a variety of health sub
jects to medical textbooks.
In keeping with the diversity of
the library, the Chinese language
collection offers 200 up-to-date
books and 30 videos on topics from

AIDS and cancer to prenatal care
and emotional wellness, Sung
said.
Initial financial suport for the
collection was provided by the Tai
wanese-American Chamber of
Commerce, a group that is very ac
tive in supporting the Chinese
community in the Bay Area, ac
cording to Sung. Engineering the
project were the co-directors of the
library, Linda Romley-Irvine and
Kristine Irving.
As far as the future of the col
lection is concerned, Sung said
that the first necessity will be to
mold it to fit users' needs.
He estimated expenses for up
keep and possible expansion at
$5,000 per year, which will be pro
vided by private donations made to
the library.
Sung stressed that he envi
sioned the collection as a part of a
"mission not just for the Chinese
community," but rather as a step
toward meeting the health care
needs of ethnic groups whose na
tive languages are not English.
He said he sees the collection as
"one outreach toward internation
al care" and that he hopes in par
ticular to see the library make a
similar effort for a Spanish and
Japanese language collection in
the near future.
