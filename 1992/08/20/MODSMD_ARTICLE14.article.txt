# University Women set global agenda
## 
### 
After nearly 10 days of discus
sions and workshops on women's
issues, the International Federa
tion of University Women will con
clude its conference at Stanford
this weekend with a renewed call
to action.
The federation will launch a
new triennial theme for change
called "Women's Future, World
Future: Education for Survival
and Progress," hoping to focus on
improving formal and informal ed
ucation for girls and impacting
policies on cross-sectoral issues
such as environment and health.
The theme is intended to guide
the nearly 1,500 conference par
ticipants and almost 180,000
IFUW members around the world

in their ongoing effort to achieve
equality for women in the arenas
of educatioa and politics.
According to Sarah Harder, a
member of the IFUW's Status of
Women and Cultural Relations
Committee, the focus "urges
women to become much more in
volved and active defining solu
tions and decisions at local and na
tional levels."
Women have "believed in a
magic of words and paper too
much," she said, but "word magic
and paper magic" will not make
change.
Harder challenged women in a
speech in Memorial Auditorium
Tuesday to not only issue reports
to government committees but to
pressure for action as well.
"Women's organizations tradi
tionally engaged in study or ser
vice rather than action," she said,
adding that while study and ser
vice should be carried out, they do
not carry the weight of policy
making in pursuing change.
The IFUW emphasizes educa
tion, both inside and outside the
classroom, as a "tool" for enacting
change.
The IFUW sponsors literacy
programs in developing countries,
where many girls have little access
to education, and also supple
ments existing school systems
with education focused on subjects
such as political skills. It also pro
motes family planning.
And while the IFUW is not nec
essarily a political organization,
Harder said, "There is no way to
affect public policy without being
political any more than you can
make an omelet without breaking
an egg."
Harder expressed confidence
that the American Association of
University Women would work ac
tively to affect public policy.
"Our organization can't be ac
cused of running off at the
mouth," she said, adding that the
AAUW "can provide the statisti
cal backup and models of change"
necessary to support their caus
es.
In the United States, the
AAUW has organized voter educa
tion programs and candidate fo
rums this election vear.

They have also voiced their con
cern about issues such as girls' ed
ucation and reproductive choice to
candidates.
Harder said afterward that if
candidates for public office "begin
to hear the same issues often
enough [they will] understand
that this isn't just some random
fringe here."
