It was getting late on a Friday afternoon last May
and George Shultz, meeting with international
leaders assembled for a conference at Stanford,
was visibly frustrated.
Speaking candidly after a long day of discussions
and speeches, the former Secretary of State told the
world leaders that he had become increasingly disillu
sioned with the missed opportunities of the past few
years.
The end of the Cold War, Shultz said, had provided
a chance to "start fresh," to throw aside the obsolete
assumptions and deteriorating systems of the past 50
years, and construct something new
But instead, "we're drifting along," without clear
leadership or concerted policies, Shultz told the mem
bers of the advisory council of Stanford's Institute for
International Studies.
The council, a blue-ribbon panel of world leaders in
politics, business and academia — such as Canadian
prime minister Brian Mulroney and Fuji Xerox chair
Yotaro Kobayashi — meets once a year to advise the
Stanford institute.
"There is a sense that there has been big change —
and there has been," Shultz said, speaking at the final
discussion session of the council's two-day meeting in
mid-May. "I share the frustration of trying to dig into
these deep problems that are, for the moment, influ
enceable — and three or four years from now, are not
going to be influenceable."
Established in 1988, the institute is attempting to
grapple with precisely those dilemmas: how to create
links between Stanford researchers studying world
problems from different angles, and make their ideas
have an impact on policy-makers in a position to im
plement them.
"The concept for the lIS is to ensure that work here
has as much influence as is possible, and as much of a
sense of global relevance as it can," Shultz said at the
advisory council meeting.
While the institute itself is fairly new, its com
ponent parts — the various campus depart
ments and centers that study international
issues — are well-established. Hanging from the Cen
ter for International Security and Arms Control to the
Asia-Pacific Research Center, the research groups
have long given Stanford a presence in international
issues.
The institute's goal is to bring coherence to Stan
ford's often divergent international programs, and
encourage cooperative work between all types of re
searchers — lawyers, biologists, political scientists —
to solve the world's problems.
And, by establishing connections with policy-mak
ers, the institute hopes to make Stanford a "world uni
versity," a player in the international scene.
But the institute's early challenge has been to jus
tify its existence to a sometimes skeptical faculty, who
are wary of intrusions into their work and wonder
whether the institute could ever accomplish the ambi
tious goals it has outlined. The University's budget
crisis will also slow the institute's plans to expand, its
directors said.
"It's tough to make anything grow in a university
that is in straitened circumstances,'' said former Stan
ford president Richard Lyman, who founded the insti
tute and retired as director last year. "This is not a
great time to build anything."
But Lyman and others remain optimistic about the
institute's potential, saying that it is beginning to
build a base of support that translates into concrete
accomplishments — like a health research center in
Chiapas, Mexico, run by Medical School Prof. Gary
Schoolnik, that has received support and funding
from advisory council members.
And many say the established organizations under
the institute's umbrella, like the arms control center
and the Asia-Pacific Research Center, are expanding
their clout with policy-makers in Russia, Japan and
the United States. Members of the centers attribute
some of their recent inroads to the increased support
they have received from the institute.
"We feel that we've opened up a channel of commu
nication, and even a hotline during periods of crises in
the relationship, to discuss the major outstanding is
sues between Japanese and American leaders," said
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Daniel Okimoto, the di
rector of the Asia-Pacific Research Center since 1982.
The institute has often been highly effective in
wielding influence over policy, according to Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy, who plans to join the
institute's environmental policy core after he steps
down this year.
Kennedy singled out the arms control center,
which has spearheaded policy talks between members
of the defense industry in the former Soviet Union and
their counterparts in the U.S. "Whether the other
pieces of lIS can do as well as that, j don t know,"he
said. "But we certainly ought to try
Founded just before the collapse of the Soviet
Union and the implosion of the communist
world, the institute is now poised to make a dif
ference in an international system more fluid than it
has been since the end of World War 11
"This is a period when so many things are uncer
tain, when so many things are up in the air, said Po

litical Science Prof. David Holloway, co-director of the
arms control center. "It's just at this point that it's
possible to make a maximum impact."
The realization of that opportunity helped to quick
en the pace of the institute's early development and
strengthened the University's resolve to support it,
according to Law Prof. Thomas Heller, its deputy di
rector.
When the institute first opened, it occupied a small
office in Room B-14 in the basement of the Littlefield
Management Center. Today, the institute's offices
take up about half of the second floor of Encina Hall,
and its administrative staff has nearly doubled.

It has also hired a full-time fund-raising director, to
help lure the money from outside donors that will be
essential to continued growth as budget cuts begin to
limit the amount the University can provide.
The institute plans a three-pronged attack on fun
damental world problems, clustering its research
around issues critical to the post-Cold War world: sov
ereignty and statehood, international security, and
the global environment.
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice, an
arms control expert who was a senior adviser to Pres
ident Bush for nearly two years, said she plans to work
extensively on the issue of statehood — and the insti
tute will be an important aid.
Sovereignty is a critical issue, Rice said, noting the
current conflict in the Balkans. "We've lived with this

state system for nearly 400 years,
and it's really teetering," she said.
"We're in the process of redefining
the international system. lIS can
have a lot to say about the prob
lems that are really vexing to the
international system right now."
But other faculty members re
main unconvinced that an acade
mic institution can make a mea
surable contribution to shaping
policy. Lyman cautioned that aca
demics' complete failure to predict
the fall of communism raises ques
tions about the role of academics
in general.
"Seldom have so many been so
wrong about so much," he said.
"It's enough to give one pause as
to whether academics can have an
influence on anything."
Establishing an identity on
campus, and receiving the
support of faculty members
competing for increasingly scarce
funds, has been an uphill battle for
the institute.
"It's tough for anything that
seems a bit of a luxury," said
Nancy Okimoto, the institute's as
sociate director. But she argued
that the institute, by helping to
map out the directions of future
research and coordinating it with
different departments and
schools, prevents faculty members
from working at cross purposes.
"There is now a lot more over
lap and dialogue," she said. "I
think we have a long way to go on
that, but I feel pretty good about

it."
The highly visible advisory council meetings have
been the main vehicle for boosting the fledgling insti
tute's prestige as it struggles to carve out a niche for
itself.
Assembled by Shultz using his government experi
ence and connections with foreign leaders, the 40-
member council consists of prominent figures like for
mer President Gerald Ford, former Australian prime
minister Bob Hawke, Korean prime minister Roh Tae
Woo, and former West German chancellor Helmut
Schmidt.
"If it's possible to bring people of this stature to the

University, then people take you more seriously,"
Lyman said. He called Shultz, the chair of the adviso
ry council, the "heart and soul" of the meetings.
Some faculty members, however, have criticized
the high-profile meetings as a waste of money, argu
ing that whirling world leaders in and out in two days
has little actual effect in helping Stanford influence
policy.
"I have the suspicion that it may well have been an
extravagant waste," said one faculty member, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. "Stanford should
start moving from the meretricious to the substantive
in education, and this conference may be one more ex
ample of the meretricious."
But institute directors say the meetings are a cor
nerstone of the effort to reach out into the policy arena
— and they are funded by

outside donors, who would
not give money for anything
else. Questioning the meet
ings' cost is "a natural criti
cism in this day when you're
being asked to save paper
clips," Lyman said.
The advisory council has
opened up an array of oppor
tunities for Stanford re
searchers that would not
have been possible other
wise, Heller said. He singled
out Schnoolnik's health re
search project in Chiapas,
along with a joint project on
biodiversity in Chile, as ex
amples of efforts aided by
the presence of Mexican and
Chilean policy-makers on
the advisory council.
And the arms control center
has benefited directly from
Shultz's help in making con
nections with world leaders,
Holloway said. In 1988, Mar
shall Sergei Akhromeev,
then the chief of the Soviet
military's general staff —
the equivalent of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff — visit
ed Shultz.
During the visit, Akhromeev
agreed to begin a joint re
search project between the
center and members of the
general staff — an unprece
dented relationship that had
to be approved by the Polit
buro, Holloway said.
"Now, Akhromeev is gone,

Gorbachev is gone and the Soviet Union is gone, but in
fact we have continued this work and certainly know
that the results of our meetings are being fed into the
Russian government and the policy-making process,"
Holloway said.
The institute is also participating in talks with "a
leading group of business organizations" that is seek
ing a post-Rio Summit agenda for the environment,
Heller said. The talks are "sensitive," so Heller would
say only that they are all "Top 50 companies."
Because of the institute's efforts to make contacts
with policy-makers, Heller said that Stanford re
searchers are now "more likely to have an impact on
things, rather than simply writing reports that are
thrown out on the waters."
The relationship between the United States and
Japan, tense for much of the 1980s, has cooled
considerably — due in no small part, Okimoto
said, to the efforts of American academics to bridge
the gap between the two countries' governments.
"They've made a significant contribution to the
maintenance of a close, cooperative relationship,"
Okimoto said, citing recent efforts to iron out poten
tial conflicts over trade and Japan's contribution to
the Persian Gulf War.
The Asia-Pacific Research Center is currently en
gaged in a number of projects — working in conjunc
tion with members of business and government in
both Japan and the United States — that are having a
concrete influence on policy, Okimoto said.
One example is a project examining the relative
strengths of the computer industry in Japan and the
United States. The project is a joint venture of the
Business School, the Engineering School and the in
stitute.
The team works closely with members of the com
puter industry in Japan, Okimoto said. "We have a lot
to learn from them, and they can benefit from the
work that we do here," he said.
The Asia-Pacific Research Center also organizes a
yearly meeting between U.S. congressmen and mem
bers of the Japanese parliament to discuss issues such
as trade and security, Okimoto said. New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley and Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, both
members of the institute's advisory council, have led
the American delegation in previous years.
Such interaction, Okimoto said, provides Stanford
researchers with "a direct pipeline" into the policy
making process.
Although the institute's efforts in Europe have not
gone as far as those on the Pacific Rim, Heller said
long-range plans call for the establishment of a Euro
pean research center based in Berlin.
It would be modeled after the Stanford Japan Cen
ter based at Kyoto University, which opened in 1989
and has been a magnet for research and academic ex
change between Stanford and Japanese scholars and
businesses.
As a prelude to the expanded European push, the
institute initiated last year the Stanford Berlin Sym
posium on Transition in Europe, an annual confer
ence that attracts prominent Germans and Americans
in politics, business and academia.
It also attracts attention from the German press.
This year's convention, held May 23, prompted a
front-page article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine, the
German equivalent of the New York Times. And the
conference touched off a "huge controversy," Heller
said, by posing the question, "Does Russia really mat
ter?"
Inviting policy-makers to participate in their dis
cussions is the key to making research more immedi
ate and effective, Heller said. "They're seeing work in
progress and have a chance to either buy into or criti
cize it or shape it in some way," he said.
Most agree that the institute has made a sound
start, overcoming some early obstacles to es
tablish itself more firmly on campus, and
Stanford more firmly in the world.
But much of that success has been due to the parts
of the institute already entrenched at Stanford before
the institute was founded, many said.
Further success will depend on the ability of the in
stitute to spearhead new projects, like those on envi
ronmental policy and sovereignty, and to help map out
an effective international research agenda for Stan
ford.
By doing that, Holloway said, the institute can
truly begin to meet its goal — changing the world, and
teaming up Stanford researchers to do it.
"The potential is considerable, because I think peo
ple are now looking for answers to new problems,"
Holloway said. But he worries that the "window of op
portunity" is rapidly closing.
"I wish there was a greater sense of urgency about
it,"he said. "The opportunity to affect change will
narrow greatly after time, because we will settle into
some new pattern of operations. The decisions we
make now will have a long-term effect."
And Shultz, too, is searching for leadership. At the
end of World War 11, Shultz said in his remarks to the
advisory council, there was a "burst of creativity" that
established the systems that "we have, in a sense,
been depending on for the last 40 years."
A similar burst of creativity is needed now, he said,
"but the frustrating thing is we're not taking advan
tage of it."

The end of the Cold War, Shultz said, had provided
a chance to "start fresh," to throw aside the obsolete
assumptions and deteriorating systems of the past 50
years, and construct something new
But instead, "we're drifting along," without clear
leadership or concerted policies, Shultz told the mem
bers of the advisory council of Stanford's Institute for
International Studies.
The council, a blue-ribbon panel of world leaders in
politics, business and academia — such as Canadian
prime minister Brian Mulroney and Fuji Xerox chair
Yotaro Kobayashi — meets once a year to advise the
Stanford institute.
"There is a sense that there has been big change —
and there has been," Shultz said, speaking at the final
discussion session of the council's two-day meeting in
mid-May. "I share the frustration of trying to dig into
these deep problems that are, for the moment, influ
enceable — and three or four years from now, are not
going to be influenceable."
Established in 1988, the institute is attempting to
grapple with precisely those dilemmas: how to create
links between Stanford researchers studying world
problems from different angles, and make their ideas
have an impact on policy-makers in a position to im
plement them.
"The concept for the lIS is to ensure that work here
has as much influence as is possible, and as much of a
sense of global relevance as it can," Shultz said at the
advisory council meeting.
While the institute itself is fairly new, its com
ponent parts — the various campus depart
ments and centers that study international
issues — are well-established. Hanging from the Cen
ter for International Security and Arms Control to the
Asia-Pacific Research Center, the research groups
have long given Stanford a presence in international
issues.
The institute's goal is to bring coherence to Stan
ford's often divergent international programs, and
encourage cooperative work between all types of re
searchers — lawyers, biologists, political scientists —
to solve the world's problems.
And, by establishing connections with policy-mak
ers, the institute hopes to make Stanford a "world uni
versity," a player in the international scene.
But the institute's early challenge has been to jus
tify its existence to a sometimes skeptical faculty, who
are wary of intrusions into their work and wonder
whether the institute could ever accomplish the ambi
tious goals it has outlined. The University's budget
crisis will also slow the institute's plans to expand, its
directors said.
"It's tough to make anything grow in a university
that is in straitened circumstances,'' said former Stan
ford president Richard Lyman, who founded the insti
tute and retired as director last year. "This is not a
great time to build anything."
But Lyman and others remain optimistic about the
institute's potential, saying that it is beginning to
build a base of support that translates into concrete
accomplishments — like a health research center in
Chiapas, Mexico, run by Medical School Prof. Gary
Schoolnik, that has received support and funding
from advisory council members.
And many say the established organizations under
the institute's umbrella, like the arms control center
and the Asia-Pacific Research Center, are expanding
their clout with policy-makers in Russia, Japan and
the United States. Members of the centers attribute
some of their recent inroads to the increased support
they have received from the institute.
"We feel that we've opened up a channel of commu
nication, and even a hotline during periods of crises in
the relationship, to discuss the major outstanding is
sues between Japanese and American leaders," said
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Daniel Okimoto, the di
rector of the Asia-Pacific Research Center since 1982.
The institute has often been highly effective in
wielding influence over policy, according to Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy, who plans to join the
institute's environmental policy core after he steps
down this year.
Kennedy singled out the arms control center,
which has spearheaded policy talks between members
of the defense industry in the former Soviet Union and
their counterparts in the U.S. "Whether the other
pieces of lIS can do as well as that, j don t know,"he
said. "But we certainly ought to try
Founded just before the collapse of the Soviet
Union and the implosion of the communist
world, the institute is now poised to make a dif
ference in an international system more fluid than it
has been since the end of World War 11
"This is a period when so many things are uncer
tain, when so many things are up in the air, said Po

litical Science Prof. David Holloway, co-director of the
arms control center. "It's just at this point that it's
possible to make a maximum impact."
The realization of that opportunity helped to quick
en the pace of the institute's early development and
strengthened the University's resolve to support it,
according to Law Prof. Thomas Heller, its deputy di
rector.
When the institute first opened, it occupied a small
office in Room B-14 in the basement of the Littlefield
Management Center. Today, the institute's offices
take up about half of the second floor of Encina Hall,
and its administrative staff has nearly doubled.

It has also hired a full-time fund-raising director, to
help lure the money from outside donors that will be
essential to continued growth as budget cuts begin to
limit the amount the University can provide.
The institute plans a three-pronged attack on fun
damental world problems, clustering its research
around issues critical to the post-Cold War world: sov
ereignty and statehood, international security, and
the global environment.
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice, an
arms control expert who was a senior adviser to Pres
ident Bush for nearly two years, said she plans to work
extensively on the issue of statehood — and the insti
tute will be an important aid.
Sovereignty is a critical issue, Rice said, noting the
current conflict in the Balkans. "We've lived with this

state system for nearly 400 years,
and it's really teetering," she said.
"We're in the process of redefining
the international system. lIS can
have a lot to say about the prob
lems that are really vexing to the
international system right now."
But other faculty members re
main unconvinced that an acade
mic institution can make a mea
surable contribution to shaping
policy. Lyman cautioned that aca
demics' complete failure to predict
the fall of communism raises ques
tions about the role of academics
in general.
"Seldom have so many been so
wrong about so much," he said.
"It's enough to give one pause as
to whether academics can have an
influence on anything."
Establishing an identity on
campus, and receiving the
support of faculty members
competing for increasingly scarce
funds, has been an uphill battle for
the institute.
"It's tough for anything that
seems a bit of a luxury," said
Nancy Okimoto, the institute's as
sociate director. But she argued
that the institute, by helping to
map out the directions of future
research and coordinating it with
different departments and
schools, prevents faculty members
from working at cross purposes.
"There is now a lot more over
lap and dialogue," she said. "I
think we have a long way to go on
that, but I feel pretty good about

it."
The highly visible advisory council meetings have
been the main vehicle for boosting the fledgling insti
tute's prestige as it struggles to carve out a niche for
itself.
Assembled by Shultz using his government experi
ence and connections with foreign leaders, the 40-
member council consists of prominent figures like for
mer President Gerald Ford, former Australian prime
minister Bob Hawke, Korean prime minister Roh Tae
Woo, and former West German chancellor Helmut
Schmidt.
"If it's possible to bring people of this stature to the

University, then people take you more seriously,"
Lyman said. He called Shultz, the chair of the adviso
ry council, the "heart and soul" of the meetings.
Some faculty members, however, have criticized
the high-profile meetings as a waste of money, argu
ing that whirling world leaders in and out in two days
has little actual effect in helping Stanford influence
policy.
"I have the suspicion that it may well have been an
extravagant waste," said one faculty member, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. "Stanford should
start moving from the meretricious to the substantive
in education, and this conference may be one more ex
ample of the meretricious."
But institute directors say the meetings are a cor
nerstone of the effort to reach out into the policy arena
— and they are funded by

outside donors, who would
not give money for anything
else. Questioning the meet
ings' cost is "a natural criti
cism in this day when you're
being asked to save paper
clips," Lyman said.
The advisory council has
opened up an array of oppor
tunities for Stanford re
searchers that would not
have been possible other
wise, Heller said. He singled
out Schnoolnik's health re
search project in Chiapas,
along with a joint project on
biodiversity in Chile, as ex
amples of efforts aided by
the presence of Mexican and
Chilean policy-makers on
the advisory council.
And the arms control center
has benefited directly from
Shultz's help in making con
nections with world leaders,
Holloway said. In 1988, Mar
shall Sergei Akhromeev,
then the chief of the Soviet
military's general staff —
the equivalent of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff — visit
ed Shultz.
During the visit, Akhromeev
agreed to begin a joint re
search project between the
center and members of the
general staff — an unprece
dented relationship that had
to be approved by the Polit
buro, Holloway said.
"Now, Akhromeev is gone,

Gorbachev is gone and the Soviet Union is gone, but in
fact we have continued this work and certainly know
that the results of our meetings are being fed into the
Russian government and the policy-making process,"
Holloway said.
The institute is also participating in talks with "a
leading group of business organizations" that is seek
ing a post-Rio Summit agenda for the environment,
Heller said. The talks are "sensitive," so Heller would
say only that they are all "Top 50 companies."
Because of the institute's efforts to make contacts
with policy-makers, Heller said that Stanford re
searchers are now "more likely to have an impact on
things, rather than simply writing reports that are
thrown out on the waters."
The relationship between the United States and
Japan, tense for much of the 1980s, has cooled
considerably — due in no small part, Okimoto
said, to the efforts of American academics to bridge
the gap between the two countries' governments.
"They've made a significant contribution to the
maintenance of a close, cooperative relationship,"
Okimoto said, citing recent efforts to iron out poten
tial conflicts over trade and Japan's contribution to
the Persian Gulf War.
The Asia-Pacific Research Center is currently en
gaged in a number of projects — working in conjunc
tion with members of business and government in
both Japan and the United States — that are having a
concrete influence on policy, Okimoto said.
One example is a project examining the relative
strengths of the computer industry in Japan and the
United States. The project is a joint venture of the
Business School, the Engineering School and the in
stitute.
The team works closely with members of the com
puter industry in Japan, Okimoto said. "We have a lot
to learn from them, and they can benefit from the
work that we do here," he said.
The Asia-Pacific Research Center also organizes a
yearly meeting between U.S. congressmen and mem
bers of the Japanese parliament to discuss issues such
as trade and security, Okimoto said. New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley and Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, both
members of the institute's advisory council, have led
the American delegation in previous years.
Such interaction, Okimoto said, provides Stanford
researchers with "a direct pipeline" into the policy
making process.
Although the institute's efforts in Europe have not
gone as far as those on the Pacific Rim, Heller said
long-range plans call for the establishment of a Euro
pean research center based in Berlin.
It would be modeled after the Stanford Japan Cen
ter based at Kyoto University, which opened in 1989
and has been a magnet for research and academic ex
change between Stanford and Japanese scholars and
businesses.
As a prelude to the expanded European push, the
institute initiated last year the Stanford Berlin Sym
posium on Transition in Europe, an annual confer
ence that attracts prominent Germans and Americans
in politics, business and academia.
It also attracts attention from the German press.
This year's convention, held May 23, prompted a
front-page article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine, the
German equivalent of the New York Times. And the
conference touched off a "huge controversy," Heller
said, by posing the question, "Does Russia really mat
ter?"
Inviting policy-makers to participate in their dis
cussions is the key to making research more immedi
ate and effective, Heller said. "They're seeing work in
progress and have a chance to either buy into or criti
cize it or shape it in some way," he said.
Most agree that the institute has made a sound
start, overcoming some early obstacles to es
tablish itself more firmly on campus, and
Stanford more firmly in the world.
But much of that success has been due to the parts
of the institute already entrenched at Stanford before
the institute was founded, many said.
Further success will depend on the ability of the in
stitute to spearhead new projects, like those on envi
ronmental policy and sovereignty, and to help map out
an effective international research agenda for Stan
ford.
By doing that, Holloway said, the institute can
truly begin to meet its goal — changing the world, and
teaming up Stanford researchers to do it.
"The potential is considerable, because I think peo
ple are now looking for answers to new problems,"
Holloway said. But he worries that the "window of op
portunity" is rapidly closing.
"I wish there was a greater sense of urgency about
it,"he said. "The opportunity to affect change will
narrow greatly after time, because we will settle into
some new pattern of operations. The decisions we
make now will have a long-term effect."
And Shultz, too, is searching for leadership. At the
end of World War 11, Shultz said in his remarks to the
advisory council, there was a "burst of creativity" that
established the systems that "we have, in a sense,
been depending on for the last 40 years."
A similar burst of creativity is needed now, he said,
"but the frustrating thing is we're not taking advan
tage of it."


Brian Bedell — Weekly
The Center for International Security and Arms Control has spearheaded a number of talks between policy
makers in the United States and the former Soviet Union on defense conversion. David Holloway, the cen
ter's co-director, above, said the Institute for International Studies plays a catalytic role in the process.
It was getting late on a Friday afternoon last May
and George Shultz, meeting with international
leaders assembled for a conference at Stanford,
was visibly frustrated.
Speaking candidly after a long day of discussions
and speeches, the former Secretary of State told the
world leaders that he had become increasingly disillu

The council, a blue-ribbon panel of world leaders in
politics, business and academia — such as Canadian
prime minister Brian Mulroney and Fuji Xerox chair
Yotaro Kobayashi — meets once a year to advise the
Stanford institute.
"There is a sense that there has been big change —
and there has been," Shultz said, speaking at the final
discussion session of the council's two-day meeting in
mid-May. "I share the frustration of trying to dig into
these deep problems that are, for the moment, influ
enceable — and three or four years from now, are not
going to be influenceable."
Established in 1988, the institute is attempting to
grapple with precisely those dilemmas: how to create
links between Stanford researchers studying world
problems from different angles, and make their ideas
have an impact on policy-makers in a position to im
plement them.
"The concept for the lIS is to ensure that work here
has as much influence as is possible, and as much of a
sense of global relevance as it can," Shultz said at the
advisory council meeting.
While the institute itself is fairly new, its com
ponent parts — the various campus depart
ments and centers that study international
issues — are well-established. Hanging from the Cen
ter for International Security and Arms Control to the
Asia-Pacific Research Center, the research groups
have long given Stanford a presence in international
issues.
The institute's goal is to bring coherence to Stan
ford's often divergent international programs, and
encourage cooperative work between all types of re
searchers — lawyers, biologists, political scientists —
to solve the world's problems.
And, by establishing connections with policy-mak
ers, the institute hopes to make Stanford a "world uni
versity," a player in the international scene.
But the institute's early challenge has been to jus
tify its existence to a sometimes skeptical faculty, who
are wary of intrusions into their work and wonder
whether the institute could ever accomplish the ambi
tious goals it has outlined. The University's budget
crisis will also slow the institute's plans to expand, its
directors said.
"It's tough to make anything grow in a university
that is in straitened circumstances,'' said former Stan
ford president Richard Lyman, who founded the insti
tute and retired as director last year. "This is not a
great time to build anything."
But Lyman and others remain optimistic about the
institute's potential, saying that it is beginning to
build a base of support that translates into concrete
accomplishments — like a health research center in
Chiapas, Mexico, run by Medical School Prof. Gary
Schoolnik, that has received support and funding
from advisory council members.
And many say the established organizations under
the institute's umbrella, like the arms control center
and the Asia-Pacific Research Center, are expanding
their clout with policy-makers in Russia, Japan and
the United States. Members of the centers attribute
some of their recent inroads to the increased support
they have received from the institute.
"We feel that we've opened up a channel of commu
nication, and even a hotline during periods of crises in
the relationship, to discuss the major outstanding is
sues between Japanese and American leaders," said
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Daniel Okimoto, the di
rector of the Asia-Pacific Research Center since 1982.
The institute has often been highly effective in
wielding influence over policy, according to Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy, who plans to join the
institute's environmental policy core after he steps
down this year.
Kennedy singled out the arms control center,
which has spearheaded policy talks between members
of the defense industry in the former Soviet Union and
their counterparts in the U.S. "Whether the other
pieces of lIS can do as well as that, j don t know,"he
said. "But we certainly ought to try
Founded just before the collapse of the Soviet
Union and the implosion of the communist
world, the institute is now poised to make a dif
ference in an international system more fluid than it
has been since the end of World War 11
"This is a period when so many things are uncer
tain, when so many things are up in the air, said Po

litical Science Prof. David Holloway, co-director of the
arms control center. "It's just at this point that it's
possible to make a maximum impact."
The realization of that opportunity helped to quick
en the pace of the institute's early development and
strengthened the University's resolve to support it,
according to Law Prof. Thomas Heller, its deputy di
rector.
When the institute first opened, it occupied a small
office in Room B-14 in the basement of the Littlefield
Management Center. Today, the institute's offices
take up about half of the second floor of Encina Hall,
and its administrative staff has nearly doubled.

It has also hired a full-time fund-raising director, to
help lure the money from outside donors that will be
essential to continued growth as budget cuts begin to
limit the amount the University can provide.
The institute plans a three-pronged attack on fun
damental world problems, clustering its research
around issues critical to the post-Cold War world: sov
ereignty and statehood, international security, and
the global environment.
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice, an
arms control expert who was a senior adviser to Pres
ident Bush for nearly two years, said she plans to work
extensively on the issue of statehood — and the insti
tute will be an important aid.
Sovereignty is a critical issue, Rice said, noting the
current conflict in the Balkans. "We've lived with this

state system for nearly 400 years,
and it's really teetering," she said.
"We're in the process of redefining
the international system. lIS can
have a lot to say about the prob
lems that are really vexing to the
international system right now."
But other faculty members re
main unconvinced that an acade
mic institution can make a mea
surable contribution to shaping
policy. Lyman cautioned that aca
demics' complete failure to predict
the fall of communism raises ques
tions about the role of academics
in general.
"Seldom have so many been so
wrong about so much," he said.
"It's enough to give one pause as
to whether academics can have an
influence on anything."
Establishing an identity on
campus, and receiving the
support of faculty members
competing for increasingly scarce
funds, has been an uphill battle for
the institute.
"It's tough for anything that
seems a bit of a luxury," said
Nancy Okimoto, the institute's as
sociate director. But she argued
that the institute, by helping to
map out the directions of future
research and coordinating it with
different departments and
schools, prevents faculty members
from working at cross purposes.
"There is now a lot more over
lap and dialogue," she said. "I
think we have a long way to go on
that, but I feel pretty good about

it."
The highly visible advisory council meetings have
been the main vehicle for boosting the fledgling insti
tute's prestige as it struggles to carve out a niche for
itself.
Assembled by Shultz using his government experi
ence and connections with foreign leaders, the 40-
member council consists of prominent figures like for
mer President Gerald Ford, former Australian prime
minister Bob Hawke, Korean prime minister Roh Tae
Woo, and former West German chancellor Helmut
Schmidt.
"If it's possible to bring people of this stature to the

University, then people take you more seriously,"
Lyman said. He called Shultz, the chair of the adviso
ry council, the "heart and soul" of the meetings.
Some faculty members, however, have criticized
the high-profile meetings as a waste of money, argu
ing that whirling world leaders in and out in two days
has little actual effect in helping Stanford influence
policy.
"I have the suspicion that it may well have been an
extravagant waste," said one faculty member, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. "Stanford should
start moving from the meretricious to the substantive
in education, and this conference may be one more ex
ample of the meretricious."
But institute directors say the meetings are a cor
nerstone of the effort to reach out into the policy arena
— and they are funded by

outside donors, who would
not give money for anything
else. Questioning the meet
ings' cost is "a natural criti
cism in this day when you're
being asked to save paper
clips," Lyman said.
The advisory council has
opened up an array of oppor
tunities for Stanford re
searchers that would not
have been possible other
wise, Heller said. He singled
out Schnoolnik's health re
search project in Chiapas,
along with a joint project on
biodiversity in Chile, as ex
amples of efforts aided by
the presence of Mexican and
Chilean policy-makers on
the advisory council.
And the arms control center
has benefited directly from
Shultz's help in making con
nections with world leaders,
Holloway said. In 1988, Mar
shall Sergei Akhromeev,
then the chief of the Soviet
military's general staff —
the equivalent of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff — visit
ed Shultz.
During the visit, Akhromeev
agreed to begin a joint re
search project between the
center and members of the
general staff — an unprece
dented relationship that had
to be approved by the Polit
buro, Holloway said.
"Now, Akhromeev is gone,

Gorbachev is gone and the Soviet Union is gone, but in
fact we have continued this work and certainly know
that the results of our meetings are being fed into the
Russian government and the policy-making process,"
Holloway said.
The institute is also participating in talks with "a
leading group of business organizations" that is seek
ing a post-Rio Summit agenda for the environment,
Heller said. The talks are "sensitive," so Heller would
say only that they are all "Top 50 companies."
Because of the institute's efforts to make contacts
with policy-makers, Heller said that Stanford re
searchers are now "more likely to have an impact on
things, rather than simply writing reports that are
thrown out on the waters."
The relationship between the United States and
Japan, tense for much of the 1980s, has cooled
considerably — due in no small part, Okimoto
said, to the efforts of American academics to bridge
the gap between the two countries' governments.
"They've made a significant contribution to the
maintenance of a close, cooperative relationship,"
Okimoto said, citing recent efforts to iron out poten
tial conflicts over trade and Japan's contribution to
the Persian Gulf War.
The Asia-Pacific Research Center is currently en
gaged in a number of projects — working in conjunc
tion with members of business and government in
both Japan and the United States — that are having a
concrete influence on policy, Okimoto said.
One example is a project examining the relative
strengths of the computer industry in Japan and the
United States. The project is a joint venture of the
Business School, the Engineering School and the in
stitute.
The team works closely with members of the com
puter industry in Japan, Okimoto said. "We have a lot
to learn from them, and they can benefit from the
work that we do here," he said.
The Asia-Pacific Research Center also organizes a
yearly meeting between U.S. congressmen and mem
bers of the Japanese parliament to discuss issues such
as trade and security, Okimoto said. New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley and Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, both
members of the institute's advisory council, have led
the American delegation in previous years.
Such interaction, Okimoto said, provides Stanford
researchers with "a direct pipeline" into the policy
making process.
Although the institute's efforts in Europe have not
gone as far as those on the Pacific Rim, Heller said
long-range plans call for the establishment of a Euro
pean research center based in Berlin.
It would be modeled after the Stanford Japan Cen
ter based at Kyoto University, which opened in 1989
and has been a magnet for research and academic ex
change between Stanford and Japanese scholars and
businesses.
As a prelude to the expanded European push, the
institute initiated last year the Stanford Berlin Sym
posium on Transition in Europe, an annual confer
ence that attracts prominent Germans and Americans
in politics, business and academia.
It also attracts attention from the German press.
This year's convention, held May 23, prompted a
front-page article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine, the
German equivalent of the New York Times. And the
conference touched off a "huge controversy," Heller
said, by posing the question, "Does Russia really mat
ter?"
Inviting policy-makers to participate in their dis
cussions is the key to making research more immedi
ate and effective, Heller said. "They're seeing work in
progress and have a chance to either buy into or criti
cize it or shape it in some way," he said.
Most agree that the institute has made a sound
start, overcoming some early obstacles to es
tablish itself more firmly on campus, and
Stanford more firmly in the world.
But much of that success has been due to the parts
of the institute already entrenched at Stanford before
the institute was founded, many said.
Further success will depend on the ability of the in
stitute to spearhead new projects, like those on envi
ronmental policy and sovereignty, and to help map out
an effective international research agenda for Stan
ford.
By doing that, Holloway said, the institute can
truly begin to meet its goal — changing the world, and
teaming up Stanford researchers to do it.
"The potential is considerable, because I think peo
ple are now looking for answers to new problems,"
Holloway said. But he worries that the "window of op
portunity" is rapidly closing.
"I wish there was a greater sense of urgency about
it,"he said. "The opportunity to affect change will
narrow greatly after time, because we will settle into
some new pattern of operations. The decisions we
make now will have a long-term effect."
And Shultz, too, is searching for leadership. At the
end of World War 11, Shultz said in his remarks to the
advisory council, there was a "burst of creativity" that
established the systems that "we have, in a sense,
been depending on for the last 40 years."
A similar burst of creativity is needed now, he said,
"but the frustrating thing is we're not taking advan
tage of it."


Brian Bedell — Weekly
The Center for International Security and Arms Control has spearheaded a number of talks between policy
makers in the United States and the former Soviet Union on defense conversion. David Holloway, the cen
ter's co-director, above, said the Institute for International Studies plays a catalytic role in the process.
It was getting late on a Friday afternoon last May
and George Shultz, meeting with international
leaders assembled for a conference at Stanford,
was visibly frustrated.
Speaking candidly after a long day of discussions
and speeches, the former Secretary of State told the
world leaders that he had become increasingly disillu
sioned with the missed opportunities of the past few
years.
The end of the Cold War, Shultz said, had provided
a chance to "start fresh," to throw aside the obsolete
assumptions and deteriorating systems of the past 50
years, and construct something new
But instead, "we're drifting along," without clear
leadership or concerted policies, Shultz told the mem
bers of the advisory council of Stanford's Institute for
International Studies.

politics, business and academia — such as Canadian
prime minister Brian Mulroney and Fuji Xerox chair

discussion session of the council's two-day meeting in
mid-May. "I share the frustration of trying to dig into
these deep problems that are, for the moment, influ
enceable — and three or four years from now, are not
going to be influenceable."
Established in 1988, the institute is attempting to
grapple with precisely those dilemmas: how to create
links between Stanford researchers studying world
problems from different angles, and make their ideas
have an impact on policy-makers in a position to im
plement them.
"The concept for the lIS is to ensure that work here
has as much influence as is possible, and as much of a
sense of global relevance as it can," Shultz said at the
advisory council meeting.
While the institute itself is fairly new, its com
ponent parts — the various campus depart
ments and centers that study international
issues — are well-established. Hanging from the Cen
ter for International Security and Arms Control to the
Asia-Pacific Research Center, the research groups
have long given Stanford a presence in international
issues.
The institute's goal is to bring coherence to Stan
ford's often divergent international programs, and
encourage cooperative work between all types of re
searchers — lawyers, biologists, political scientists —
to solve the world's problems.
And, by establishing connections with policy-mak
ers, the institute hopes to make Stanford a "world uni
versity," a player in the international scene.
But the institute's early challenge has been to jus
tify its existence to a sometimes skeptical faculty, who
are wary of intrusions into their work and wonder
whether the institute could ever accomplish the ambi
tious goals it has outlined. The University's budget
crisis will also slow the institute's plans to expand, its
directors said.
"It's tough to make anything grow in a university
that is in straitened circumstances,'' said former Stan
ford president Richard Lyman, who founded the insti
tute and retired as director last year. "This is not a
great time to build anything."
But Lyman and others remain optimistic about the
institute's potential, saying that it is beginning to
build a base of support that translates into concrete
accomplishments — like a health research center in
Chiapas, Mexico, run by Medical School Prof. Gary
Schoolnik, that has received support and funding
from advisory council members.
And many say the established organizations under
the institute's umbrella, like the arms control center
and the Asia-Pacific Research Center, are expanding
their clout with policy-makers in Russia, Japan and
the United States. Members of the centers attribute
some of their recent inroads to the increased support
they have received from the institute.
"We feel that we've opened up a channel of commu
nication, and even a hotline during periods of crises in
the relationship, to discuss the major outstanding is
sues between Japanese and American leaders," said
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Daniel Okimoto, the di
rector of the Asia-Pacific Research Center since 1982.
The institute has often been highly effective in
wielding influence over policy, according to Universi
ty President Donald Kennedy, who plans to join the
institute's environmental policy core after he steps
down this year.
Kennedy singled out the arms control center,
which has spearheaded policy talks between members
of the defense industry in the former Soviet Union and
their counterparts in the U.S. "Whether the other
pieces of lIS can do as well as that, j don t know,"he
said. "But we certainly ought to try
Founded just before the collapse of the Soviet
Union and the implosion of the communist
world, the institute is now poised to make a dif
ference in an international system more fluid than it
has been since the end of World War 11
"This is a period when so many things are uncer
tain, when so many things are up in the air, said Po

litical Science Prof. David Holloway, co-director of the
arms control center. "It's just at this point that it's
possible to make a maximum impact."
The realization of that opportunity helped to quick
en the pace of the institute's early development and
strengthened the University's resolve to support it,
according to Law Prof. Thomas Heller, its deputy di
rector.
When the institute first opened, it occupied a small
office in Room B-14 in the basement of the Littlefield
Management Center. Today, the institute's offices
take up about half of the second floor of Encina Hall,
and its administrative staff has nearly doubled.

It has also hired a full-time fund-raising director, to
help lure the money from outside donors that will be
essential to continued growth as budget cuts begin to
limit the amount the University can provide.
The institute plans a three-pronged attack on fun
damental world problems, clustering its research
around issues critical to the post-Cold War world: sov
ereignty and statehood, international security, and
the global environment.
Assoc. Political Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice, an
arms control expert who was a senior adviser to Pres
ident Bush for nearly two years, said she plans to work
extensively on the issue of statehood — and the insti
tute will be an important aid.
Sovereignty is a critical issue, Rice said, noting the
current conflict in the Balkans. "We've lived with this

state system for nearly 400 years,
and it's really teetering," she said.
"We're in the process of redefining
the international system. lIS can
have a lot to say about the prob
lems that are really vexing to the
international system right now."
But other faculty members re
main unconvinced that an acade
mic institution can make a mea
surable contribution to shaping
policy. Lyman cautioned that aca
demics' complete failure to predict
the fall of communism raises ques
tions about the role of academics
in general.
"Seldom have so many been so
wrong about so much," he said.
"It's enough to give one pause as
to whether academics can have an
influence on anything."
Establishing an identity on
campus, and receiving the
support of faculty members
competing for increasingly scarce
funds, has been an uphill battle for
the institute.
"It's tough for anything that
seems a bit of a luxury," said
Nancy Okimoto, the institute's as
sociate director. But she argued
that the institute, by helping to
map out the directions of future
research and coordinating it with
different departments and
schools, prevents faculty members
from working at cross purposes.
"There is now a lot more over
lap and dialogue," she said. "I
think we have a long way to go on
that, but I feel pretty good about

it."
The highly visible advisory council meetings have
been the main vehicle for boosting the fledgling insti
tute's prestige as it struggles to carve out a niche for
itself.
Assembled by Shultz using his government experi
ence and connections with foreign leaders, the 40-
member council consists of prominent figures like for
mer President Gerald Ford, former Australian prime
minister Bob Hawke, Korean prime minister Roh Tae
Woo, and former West German chancellor Helmut
Schmidt.
"If it's possible to bring people of this stature to the

University, then people take you more seriously,"
Lyman said. He called Shultz, the chair of the adviso
ry council, the "heart and soul" of the meetings.
Some faculty members, however, have criticized
the high-profile meetings as a waste of money, argu
ing that whirling world leaders in and out in two days
has little actual effect in helping Stanford influence
policy.
"I have the suspicion that it may well have been an
extravagant waste," said one faculty member, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. "Stanford should
start moving from the meretricious to the substantive
in education, and this conference may be one more ex
ample of the meretricious."
But institute directors say the meetings are a cor
nerstone of the effort to reach out into the policy arena
— and they are funded by

outside donors, who would
not give money for anything
else. Questioning the meet
ings' cost is "a natural criti
cism in this day when you're
being asked to save paper
clips," Lyman said.
The advisory council has
opened up an array of oppor
tunities for Stanford re
searchers that would not
have been possible other
wise, Heller said. He singled
out Schnoolnik's health re
search project in Chiapas,
along with a joint project on
biodiversity in Chile, as ex
amples of efforts aided by
the presence of Mexican and
Chilean policy-makers on
the advisory council.
And the arms control center
has benefited directly from
Shultz's help in making con
nections with world leaders,
Holloway said. In 1988, Mar
shall Sergei Akhromeev,
then the chief of the Soviet
military's general staff —
the equivalent of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff — visit
ed Shultz.
During the visit, Akhromeev
agreed to begin a joint re
search project between the
center and members of the
general staff — an unprece
dented relationship that had
to be approved by the Polit
buro, Holloway said.
"Now, Akhromeev is gone,

Gorbachev is gone and the Soviet Union is gone, but in
fact we have continued this work and certainly know
that the results of our meetings are being fed into the
Russian government and the policy-making process,"
Holloway said.
The institute is also participating in talks with "a
leading group of business organizations" that is seek
ing a post-Rio Summit agenda for the environment,
Heller said. The talks are "sensitive," so Heller would
say only that they are all "Top 50 companies."
Because of the institute's efforts to make contacts
with policy-makers, Heller said that Stanford re
searchers are now "more likely to have an impact on
things, rather than simply writing reports that are
thrown out on the waters."
The relationship between the United States and
Japan, tense for much of the 1980s, has cooled
considerably — due in no small part, Okimoto
said, to the efforts of American academics to bridge
the gap between the two countries' governments.
"They've made a significant contribution to the
maintenance of a close, cooperative relationship,"
Okimoto said, citing recent efforts to iron out poten
tial conflicts over trade and Japan's contribution to
the Persian Gulf War.
The Asia-Pacific Research Center is currently en
gaged in a number of projects — working in conjunc
tion with members of business and government in
both Japan and the United States — that are having a
concrete influence on policy, Okimoto said.
One example is a project examining the relative
strengths of the computer industry in Japan and the
United States. The project is a joint venture of the
Business School, the Engineering School and the in
stitute.
The team works closely with members of the com
puter industry in Japan, Okimoto said. "We have a lot
to learn from them, and they can benefit from the
work that we do here," he said.
The Asia-Pacific Research Center also organizes a
yearly meeting between U.S. congressmen and mem
bers of the Japanese parliament to discuss issues such
as trade and security, Okimoto said. New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley and Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, both
members of the institute's advisory council, have led
the American delegation in previous years.
Such interaction, Okimoto said, provides Stanford
researchers with "a direct pipeline" into the policy
making process.
Although the institute's efforts in Europe have not
gone as far as those on the Pacific Rim, Heller said
long-range plans call for the establishment of a Euro
pean research center based in Berlin.
It would be modeled after the Stanford Japan Cen
ter based at Kyoto University, which opened in 1989
and has been a magnet for research and academic ex
change between Stanford and Japanese scholars and
businesses.
As a prelude to the expanded European push, the
institute initiated last year the Stanford Berlin Sym
posium on Transition in Europe, an annual confer
ence that attracts prominent Germans and Americans
in politics, business and academia.
It also attracts attention from the German press.
This year's convention, held May 23, prompted a
front-page article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine, the
German equivalent of the New York Times. And the
conference touched off a "huge controversy," Heller
said, by posing the question, "Does Russia really mat
ter?"
Inviting policy-makers to participate in their dis
cussions is the key to making research more immedi
ate and effective, Heller said. "They're seeing work in
progress and have a chance to either buy into or criti
cize it or shape it in some way," he said.
Most agree that the institute has made a sound
start, overcoming some early obstacles to es
tablish itself more firmly on campus, and
Stanford more firmly in the world.
But much of that success has been due to the parts
of the institute already entrenched at Stanford before
the institute was founded, many said.
Further success will depend on the ability of the in
stitute to spearhead new projects, like those on envi
ronmental policy and sovereignty, and to help map out
an effective international research agenda for Stan
ford.
By doing that, Holloway said, the institute can
truly begin to meet its goal — changing the world, and
teaming up Stanford researchers to do it.
"The potential is considerable, because I think peo
ple are now looking for answers to new problems,"
Holloway said. But he worries that the "window of op
portunity" is rapidly closing.
"I wish there was a greater sense of urgency about
it,"he said. "The opportunity to affect change will
narrow greatly after time, because we will settle into
some new pattern of operations. The decisions we
make now will have a long-term effect."
And Shultz, too, is searching for leadership. At the
end of World War 11, Shultz said in his remarks to the
advisory council, there was a "burst of creativity" that
established the systems that "we have, in a sense,
been depending on for the last 40 years."
A similar burst of creativity is needed now, he said,
"but the frustrating thing is we're not taking advan
tage of it."

The Center for International Security and Arms Control has spearheaded a number of talks between policy
makers in the United States and the former Soviet Union on defense conversion. David Holloway, the cen
ter's co-director, above, said the Institute for International Studies plays a catalytic role in the process.
