## VanDerveer: At the helm of a Card dynasty 
### Matthew Milliken Staff writer 
It's off-season for most basketball play
ers, but for Tara VanDerveer and the Stan
ford women's basketball team, practice has
just begun. Next week they fly to Europe to
represent the United States in the 1992 Eu
rostars Tournament.
The six-team competition begins
Wednesday and features five professional
teams from Europe and the Commonwealth
of Independent States. Spain's Valence is
expected to challenge for the 1992 Euro
pean title. Challes is the reigning French
championship team, Kiev is the Common
wealth champ, and Starres Zagora holds the
Bulgarian national title. Stanford, of
course, is the 1992 NCAA champion.
The Cardinal will be hard-pressed to win
against professional teams. VanDerveer
openly admires the international game: "I
like the fast tempo, the excitement, the
three point shooting. . . ." VanDerveer, a
three-year starting guard at Indiana, tried
out twice for the U.S. national team and
tries to model her Stanford squad in the
mold of the international game.
But VanDerveer doesn't seem too con
cerned about the upcoming tournament.
She has learned from her victories and her
losses.
"After 1990 (when Stanford won its first
women's basketball title), I never wanted
1991 to start," VanDerveer said. "I really
liked winning with that team." Graduates
Jennifer Azzi and Katy Steding weren't re
turning — but the basketball season was,
and with it came pressure. When Stanford
played Tennessee in the 1991 Final Four,
injuries sidelined starters Julie Zeilstra and
Trisha Stevens. The result: a 68-60 loss to
the eventual champion Lady Volunteers.
VanDerveer played it differently for
1991-92. She had one goal going into the
campaign: "To have fun." The experts
thought the Cardinal would have a rebuild
ing year — Stevens and Sonja Henning had
graduated, and Zeilstra was out for the sea
son. What the experts forgot was how close
Stanford's second-stringers had played
Tennessee.
Still having fun
VanDerveer's goal hasn't changed after
last year's title. "It doesn't feel like we're de
fending national champions," she says.
These days the coach looks more like a
head counselor with her T-shirt, shorts and
walkie-talkie. She's responsible for 1200
athletes attending women's basketball
camp at Stanford this summer. But one look

in her office reveals that VanDerveer isn't a
typical camp administrator.
Her walls are neatly ringed with plaques
and photographs, and one cabinet is reserved
for game tapes. More impressive, perhaps, is
what isn't on display: on the floor next to the
couch is a photograph of President Bush,
VanDerveer and her '92 squad standing on
the White House basketball court.
You can tell that VanDerveer is thinking
about the future. When a potential recruit
calls, VanDerveer drops everything to talk
to the player.
All the stars from the 1992 squad return
this year, but after this season the team's
nucleus — seniors Molly Goodenbour, Chris
MacMurdo, Angela Taylor and Val Whiting
— will depart. VanDerveer will recruit six
players for the 1993-94 season.
By then a seasoned group must be ready
to step forward, among them current junior
Chris MacMurdo and four skilled sopho
mores. They include 1992 Fac-10 Freshman
of the Year Rachel Hemmer; center Anita
Kaplan, 1991 New York State high school
player of the year; and walk-on point guard
Kate Paye, who played well under pressure
during last year's Final Four.
Two players, however, will never again
don the cardinal and white. They are gradu
ate Ann Adkins and junior Kelly Dougherty,
who recently transferred to Vanderbilt. Van-
Derveer didn't discuss Dougherty's reasons
for leaving, but said that a player shouldn't
remain in a situation where she is unhappy.
Stanford track coach Brooks Johnson
has also departed, for Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo. For the past eight years he was re
sponsible for player conditioning. Van-
Derveer credited him with the above-aver
age strength and endurance that con
tributed to last year's NCAA trophy.
Yet VanDerveer has learned from work
ing with the coach, and says there will be
few differences in her coaching strategy
next year. "We try to build and work up to
the NCAA tournament. . . .Why change
something that's working?"
No easy road
But the level of the sport is improving,
and winning a third title won't be easy.
"Young girls are more and more skilled,"
says VanDerveer. So are college teams. Last
year's Final Four had Southwest Missouri
State and Western Kentucky, two relative
unknowns. Conference play also saw nu
merous upsets from unexpectedly strong
teams. The Cardinal won its fourth straight
Pac-10 title, but saw stiff competition from
USC and UCI.A and suffered defeats to Cal
ifornia, Arizona State and Oregon State.

What's more, Stanford's schedule fea
tures national powerhouses like Tennessee,
Texas and Connecticut — not to mention up
and-coming teams like Texas Tech and UC-
Santa Barbara. The Cardinal knocked both
those teams out of the NCAA tournament
last year, and neither is likely to forget that.
"I'll bet they're a little more scared [than
us)," VanDerveer smiles. "[But] we're going
to be bringing out the best in everyone.". ..
Stanford is everyone's big rival." Van-
Derveer says that last year's losses were
proof that her team has to be ready to com

pete in every single game.
If anyone can motivate a team to play at
its best every night, it's VanDerveer. Last
year she constantly altered the starting
lineup in order to field the strongest team.
"I'll be really sad to see this team go," she
says. "But then there's always the challenge
of a new team. . . . it's like a new puzzle. And
when you figure out that puzzle there's a
tremendous sense of accomplishment."
And sometimes there's also a national
title to go along with that sense of accom
plishment.

Women's basketball coach Tara VanDerveer demands total commitment from Molly
Goodenbour and the rest of her team. Of her coaching style, VanDerveer says "Why
change something that's working?" With two national titles to her credit, VanDerveer
has a very good point.
