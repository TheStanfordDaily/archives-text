# NOSE TO NOSE
## Stanford nickname sparks summer's last debate 
### 
Noah Blake: Well, Sean, we've
had eight weeks of this fighting
over various sports issues, and this
is our last column. What do you
want to argue about?
Sean May: I hardly think that
these have been arguments; argu
ment implies a fair fight, and you
sure haven't held up your end of
the bargain.
N. 8.: This from a man who thinks
that "Cardinal" is a good nick
name for Stanford sports teams.
S.M.: What's the matter with
that, would you prefer something
like Wildcats or Bulldogs? Does
N.B. stand for No Brain?
N. 8.: Does S.M. stand for Simple
Mind? If we got rid of Cardinal, we
wouldn't have to replace it with
something fascistic like Cats, Dogs
or Trojans. We could choose a
name that's distinctly Stanford.
S.M.:I don't understand this
burning need for change. Cardinal
is distinctly Stanford — kind of
weird and quirky and singular all
at the same time. As a singular
university, I believe Stanford
should have a singular nickname.
N. 8.: I always knew you support
ed the status quo — you'll proba
bly vote for Bush/QuayKe), too.
But when the status quo isn't
working, change is needed. And
Cardinal just doesn't work.

It's just a bad copy of Harvard's
nickname, the "Crimson." We
don't play football like a bunch of
weak, nerdy, pampered babies-
S.M.: Not any more.
N. 8.: -so why should we have a

nickname like
Harvard's? Al
though this
university was
founded to imi
tate the Ivies,
Stanford is
now far superi
or. I just want
us to have a far
superior nick
name to match.
S.M.: And I'm
sure you have
oodles of better
ideas.
N. 8.: As a mat
ter of fact, I do.

How about "Philosopher-Kings"?
Or "Trolls"? Or "Robber Harons"?
Or even "Rabid Squirrels"?
Note that all of these are weird
and quirky, and all except Trolls is
distinctly Stanford. Trolls, I think,
is just cool, but Philosopher-Kings
is my favorite.
S.M.: Trolls reminds me of those
stupid little toys that have all the
hair sticking straight up — I hate
them. Call 'em Ogres instead.

Then the yell leaders can be the
Lady Ogres.
N. 8.: They're cheerleaders, Sean,
and some of them are male.
S.M.: Heh, heh. I won't touch that
one wearing rubber gloves and a

sanitation suit. Wait, I have an
idea, perhaps the Stanford Billy
Goats GrufT? It would raise Big
Game to new levels of humiliation:
"Billy Goats Gruff 45, Golden
Bears 3."
N. 8.: Well I'm glad to see that you
recognize that Cardinal is not suf
ficient for this great university.
Cardinal is a color conccpt, after
all. The media always screws it up
and calls us the Cardinals, and

who wants a nickname that is so
damn abstract.
S.M.: It's not our fault that the
media is stupid. You want to be the
Philosopher-Kings, but philoso
phy is nothing if not abstract. Ob-

viously, you like
abstractness,
and therefore,
you just bolster
my argument
that Cardinal is
a pretty darn
cool nickname.
N. 8.: Alas, some
of this paper's
readers would
argue that it is
precisely our
fault that the
media is stupid.
But the only one
around here
that likes ab-

straction is you, Mr. Political Sci
ence Major. As Descartes put it,"I
think, therefore I am." Philoso
pher-Kings think, and therefore
are. Cardinal does not think, and
isn't. There's nothing at all abstract
about Philosopher-Kings, the soon
to-be Stanford nickname.
S.M.: Your logic is impenetrable.
You are definitely a Communica
tion major. I'm sure we're becom
ing a little obtuse to the reader.

Let's pet back on track. I like Car
dinal, and I haven't seen anything
good enough to be worth changing
to.
N. 8.: I' m not saying that my sug
gestions are that great. But I'm
sure that somebody affiliated with
Stanford is smart enough to come
up with a perfect nickname for this
school. In fact, anyone with a sug
gestion please bring it into The
Daily or mail it to:
Nicknames
P.O. Box 6484
Stanford, CA 94309
So, Sean, we've reached the end
of our last column. Anything to
add?
S.M.: Yes, I want to keep the very,
ah, different nature of our athletic
program. I love the Band, I love
the Tree, I hate the c/ieerleaders,
and I like our very peculiar nick
name. If a suitable replacement
can be found, I may be willing to
support it. Nothing inspirational;
the sillier, the better.
And I'd like it to be noted for the
record that we made it through
this entire column without mak
ing one Cleveland Indians
joke. . . .oops, I guess we didn't.
N.B. If you got that last joke, we
salute you for reading us all sum
mer. Go Cardinal/Philosopher-
Kmgs and, as always, Beat Cal.

Bears 3."
N. 8.: Well I'm glad to see that you
recognize that Cardinal is not suf
ficient for this great university.
Cardinal is a color conccpt, after
all. The media always screws it up
and calls us the Cardinals, and

who wants a nickname that is so
damn abstract.
S.M.: It's not our fault that the
media is stupid. You want to be the
Philosopher-Kings, but philoso
phy is nothing if not abstract. Ob-

viously, you like
abstractness,
and therefore,
you just bolster
my argument
that Cardinal is
a pretty darn
cool nickname.
N. 8.: Alas, some
of this paper's
readers would
argue that it is
precisely our
fault that the
media is stupid.
But the only one
around here
that likes ab-

straction is you, Mr. Political Sci
ence Major. As Descartes put it,"I
think, therefore I am." Philoso
pher-Kings think, and therefore
are. Cardinal does not think, and
isn't. There's nothing at all abstract
about Philosopher-Kings, the soon
to-be Stanford nickname.
S.M.: Your logic is impenetrable.
You are definitely a Communica
tion major. I'm sure we're becom
ing a little obtuse to the reader.

Let's pet back on track. I like Car
dinal, and I haven't seen anything
good enough to be worth changing
to.
N. 8.: I' m not saying that my sug
gestions are that great. But I'm
sure that somebody affiliated with
Stanford is smart enough to come
up with a perfect nickname for this
school. In fact, anyone with a sug
gestion please bring it into The
Daily or mail it to:

So, Sean, we've reached the end
of our last column. Anything to
add?
S.M.: Yes, I want to keep the very,
ah, different nature of our athletic
program. I love the Band, I love
the Tree, I hate the c/ieerleaders,
and I like our very peculiar nick
name. If a suitable replacement
can be found, I may be willing to
support it. Nothing inspirational;
the sillier, the better.
And I'd like it to be noted for the
record that we made it through
this entire column without mak
ing one Cleveland Indians
joke. . . .oops, I guess we didn't.
N.B. If you got that last joke, we
salute you for reading us all sum
mer. Go Cardinal/Philosopher-
Kmgs and, as always, Beat Cal.


Sean May and Noah Blake
Noah Blake: Well, Sean, we've
had eight weeks of this fighting
over various sports issues, and this
is our last column. What do you
want to argue about?
Sean May: I hardly think that
these have been arguments; argu
ment implies a fair fight, and you
sure haven't held up your end of
the bargain.
N. 8.: This from a man who thinks
that "Cardinal" is a good nick
name for Stanford sports teams.
S.M.: What's the matter with
that, would you prefer something
like Wildcats or Bulldogs? Does
N.B. stand for No Brain?
N. 8.: Does S.M. stand for Simple
Mind? If we got rid of Cardinal, we
wouldn't have to replace it with
something fascistic like Cats, Dogs
or Trojans. We could choose a
name that's distinctly Stanford.
S.M.:I don't understand this
burning need for change. Cardinal
is distinctly Stanford — kind of
weird and quirky and singular all
at the same time. As a singular
university, I believe Stanford
should have a singular nickname.
N. 8.: I always knew you support
ed the status quo — you'll proba
bly vote for Bush/QuayKe), too.
But when the status quo isn't
working, change is needed. And
Cardinal just doesn't work.

It's just a bad copy of Harvard's
nickname, the "Crimson." We
don't play football like a bunch of
weak, nerdy, pampered babies-
S.M.: Not any more.
N. 8.: -so why should we have a

nickname like
Harvard's? Al
though this
university was
founded to imi
tate the Ivies,
Stanford is
now far superi
or. I just want
us to have a far
superior nick
name to match.
S.M.: And I'm
sure you have
oodles of better
ideas.
N. 8.: As a mat
ter of fact, I do.

How about "Philosopher-Kings"?
Or "Trolls"? Or "Robber Harons"?
Or even "Rabid Squirrels"?
Note that all of these are weird
and quirky, and all except Trolls is
distinctly Stanford. Trolls, I think,
is just cool, but Philosopher-Kings
is my favorite.
S.M.: Trolls reminds me of those
stupid little toys that have all the
hair sticking straight up — I hate
them. Call 'em Ogres instead.

Then the yell leaders can be the
Lady Ogres.
N. 8.: They're cheerleaders, Sean,
and some of them are male.
S.M.: Heh, heh. I won't touch that
one wearing rubber gloves and a

sanitation suit. Wait, I have an
idea, perhaps the Stanford Billy
Goats GrufT? It would raise Big
Game to new levels of humiliation:
"Billy Goats Gruff 45, Golden
Bears 3."
