As Stanford grad Carey Perloff
begins rehearsals this week
for August Strindberg's
"Creditors" — her first produc
tion as the new artistic director
for San Francisco's American
Conservatory Theater — she is
clear about the future of one of
America's largest and most re
spected regional companies.
"I hope that it will be a major
player in the national theater
scene," she says, "a great classical
theater and a theater that creates
innovative new work."
And although she notes that
"the two go together inextrica
bly," the personal vision of this
1980 graduate in classics and
comparative literature has al
ready had an impact on ACT's
26th season, one which features
classic works by Strindberg, .John
Webster, Euripides, Dickens and
Moliere.
"It's something that's missing
in this country. Very few theaters
are left doing great literature,"
Perloff laments. "The mission of
anyone in theater is to keep cul
ture alive.
"I have a strong personal aes
thetic," she adds, "and I want to
rearticulate what |ACT'sJ aes
thetic is and what kind of artists
it embraces."
Those artists will include a fair
share of well-known actors in this
season's schedule, including Jean
Stapleton in ACT's annual New
Year's piece and in the season
ending "The Learned Ladies,"
which also stars Sydney Walker,
fresh from his performance in the
screen version of "Prelude to a
Kiss."
Perloff feels that the selection
of time-honored pieces plays a
large part in attracting "really ex
traordinary actors who nurture
the actors who are here" as part

of ACT's Conservatory Program,
the only fully accredited non-col
lege or university program to
offer a Master of Fine Arts degree
in acting.
"Classical theater allows you to
offer a really good actor a really

great role, especially women," and
more notably, older women for
whom there are very few choice
acting opportunities, says Perloff.
Recalling fond memories of
her undergraduate years, "the
greatest time of [her| life,"
Perloff credits Stanford with nur
turing her love for the classics.
Arriving at the Farm from
Philadelphia, she had no idea
what to major in, save that she
wanted to be an archaeologist.
An invitation from the Classics
Department — who had noted
her background in Latin — "to
have a glass of sherry" at a wel
coming reception set her on the
road to her future course of
study, which included completing
the demanding Humanities Hon
ors Program.
Taking classes in ancient
Greek and Latin, art history,
dance, psychology, history and
literary criticism, in addition to

acting and directing work in the
Drama Department and a stint
with the now defunct Summer
Theater Festival, has served her
well to this day.
"If you want to be a director,
any kind of rigorous education is
useful," says Perloff, who also
studied at Oxford University on a
Fulbright Fellowship.
The third artistic director to
head ACT, Perloff faces the chal
lenge of asserting her vision in
the shadow of Edward Hastings,
artistic director for the previous
six years, and William Ball,
ACT's founder and leader for 20
years, both of whom left indelible
marks on the character of the
company.
One of those marks, the much
lauded ethnic diversification of
ACT under Hastings, provided
Perloff with her first challenge in
helming the company.
Some members of the compa
ny expressed discomfort at the in
clusion of Ken Ludwig's "Lend
Me a Tenor" in ACT's season be
cause of the play's use of a black
face device. The unexpected avail
ability of Dario Fo's "The Pope
and the Witch" allowed Perloff to
drop "Tenor" from the schedule,
although some decried the deci
sion as a form of censorship.
"Terms like 'politically cor
rect' are easy to throw around,
but this is in no way a statement
about political correctness," she
says, noting that the Fo piece is
"much more consonant with the
mission of ACT.
"We found something more ap
propriate for the company," she
adds.
Eager to put the "Tenor" flap
behind her, Perloff speaks eagerly
of "Creditors," a new production of
the play she recently directed with
much acclaim at CSC Repertory,
the ofT-Broadway New York com
pany where she served as artistic
director for the past six years.

"It's a tense, erratic, suspense
ful Strindberg play, a thriller,"
she says.
Calling it "enormously rele
vant," she invites just about
everyone to the black comedy by
noting "if you've ever had a bad
relationship, this is your play."
And Perloff already feels wel
come as ACT embarks on its new
season and the much anticipated

repair of its home, the Geary The
ater, severely damaged in the
Loma Prieta earthquake and tar
geted to reopen in October 1993
after a major capital campaign
Perloff is spearheading.
"The company's been extreme
ly excited. Change is always a ter
rifying and exhilarating experi
ence. We're really ready to get to
work."
