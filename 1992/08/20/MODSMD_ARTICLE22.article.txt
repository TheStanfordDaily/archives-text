### June Mølgaard Staff writer 
When Robert Kelley says "No one else
does things quite like this," he is re
ferring to Theatre Works, the unique
theater company he founded in 1970.
But the description applies equally to
him. Twenty-two years later, this Hay Area
native and Stanford graduate adheres to his
position as artistic director of a company
that maintains the artistic and social ideals
that inspired it.
Kelley founded Theatre Works during
the difficult years of social unrest, which
primarily affected the young, at the request
of Ralph Shrom, the director of a communi
ty theater in Palo Alto.
The idea was to get together a group of
college- and high school-age kids of differ
ent backgrounds within the community and
involve them with the theater.
"As you know, those were years of great
turmoil," Kelley says.
Since then, Theatre Works has evolved
into a successful company, attracting actors
from throughout the Bay Area and winning
acclaim for its many new, daring and very
frequently multicultural pieces. The diver
sity of its staff and cast has proven to be the
driving force behind the theater.

"Theatre-
Works is ex
tremely proud
of its work, and
its representa
tions, in terms
of its multicul
tural cast and
thinking," Kel
ley says. "It's an
ongoing goal for
the company."
According
to Kelley, one
of the reasons
the Bay Area is
so attractive to
him is that the
wealth of peo
ple from dif
ferent hack-

grounds one
can draw on provides an excellent place to
base a theater.
But when Kelley graduated from Stan
ford with a degree in English, those weren't
the kind of judgements he expected to he
making. His real ambition was to become a
fiction writer. He had been involved with
the arts throughout his life as an early par
ticipant in theater, as a pianist, as a member

of various bands
and as an actor
and producer
while at Stan
ford.
"I didn't
really expect to
start my own the
ater company,"
Kelley says," but
then I realized
that I knew a little
about a lot of
things and that
they maybe pro
vided the right
combination to
make an artistic
director. I do hope
though, that I've
developed artisti
cally."
Kelley co
directed Theatre-
Works' current
show, "M. But
terfly," bas*»d on
the story of a
male French
diplomat's affair
with a supposed
ly female Chi
nese opera star
who turns out to

be a male spy. The play was written by anoth
er Stanford graduate, David Henry Hwang,
and stars Mark Capri, a Stanford graduate
student in drama.
Stanford affiliates have played promi
nent parts in this season's first three pro
ductions, and Kelley continues to see Stan
ford theater productions as frequently as he
can, most recently "The Death of the Last

Black Man in the Whole Entire World," di
rected by Prof. Harry Elam.
Elam, who runs Stanford's Committee
on Black Performing Arts, will be directing
one of Theatre Works' upcoming plays, "Jar
the Floor," which tells the story of four gen
erations of black women.
The originality and independence of The
atre Works' productions does put the com
pany in a slightly difficult position, particu
larly during these financially stringent
times.
"I have felt the tug of temptation to do
more well-known stuff," Kelley admits.
"There have been subscribers that have
told us they will only renew their subscrip
tions when the economic situation im
proves."
Even its more well-known productions,
such as "M. Butterfly," pose a risk because
of the cost and difficulty of sets and cos
tumes, and because the national tour passed
through the Bay Area only a year ago.
But Theatre Works decided to do the play
because it is simply "one of the best plays
written over the last ten years," says Kelley.
And according to Theatre Works marketing
and public relations manager, Linda Henry,
"M. Butterfly" set an all-time record in sin
gle-ticket sales.
Kelley, whose ultimate goal for the com
pany is a restructuring into professional
status, emphasizes the tenacity of Theatre-
Works' ideal.
"We don't want to change what we do in
order to change the way we do it. Art is dri
ving these decisions," he says.
And as for Kelley, he has no intention of
leaving.
"This is my community, and I have no
bones about it. There are very few artistic
directors that have stayed around any
where for 22 years."
