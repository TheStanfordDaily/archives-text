"Single White Female"
Director/producer Barbet
Schroeder's latest film, "Single
White Female," is by no means a
squandering of six to seven dol
lars. But its predictable conflict
and resolution only reinforces the
conclusion that Hollywood, with
few exceptions, has refused to
allow the psychothriller genre to
advance much past the sophistica
tion of "Fatal Attraction."
Allie Jones (Bridget Fonda)
throws her fiance Sam out after
learning of his infidelity. Left
alone in their large apartment, she
places an advertisement for a
roommate which is quickly an
swered by Hedi Carlson (Jennifer
Jason Leigh).
Hedi accepts the responsibili
ties of roommate and friend with
great relish until Sam and Allie de
cide to reunite, at which point she
flies over the cuckoo's nest and
they all live miserably ever after.
Leigh and Fonda present fine
performances, as do their co-stars
Steven Weber and Peter Fried
man. However, none — save Leigh
— is given the opportunity to truly
flaunt his or her talent.
For more than three quarters
of the film, Leigh plays a timid
mouse whose sole purpose in life
centers on becoming Allie's best
friend and confidante.
The last quarter of "Single
White Female," however, presents
Hedi's more sexually violent and
manipulative side. Sadly, this
showing of force does little to flesh
out her character. It instead pro
vides an excuse for torrid bursts of
unnecessary violence not to men
tion her bloody scuffle with Fonda.

Of course you can't hold the ac
tresses accountable for this. The
responsibility lies instead on the
shoulders of the producers, direc
tor and possibly the writers associ
ated with the film.
It is all too clear that many of
the scenes involving sex and vio
lence exist only because some pro
ducer far from the filming process
was convinced that Leigh and
Fonda, bearing their bodies and
beating the living daylights out of
each other and their co-stars,
might attract crowds.
Nonetheless, the women's bod
ies are essential to the underlying
mood of the film, a mood that sug
gests innocent sexuality, an ex
treme comfortableness with self
and others, and a healthy amount
of vulnerability.
It's truly unfortunate that this
crucial element is suffocated be
neath a ton of soft porn.
Likewise, it's obvious the major
ity of violence presented through
out "Single White Female" is
meant to dredge up audience
cringes, cries, hollers and moans.
Though effective, it fails in adding
substance to the film's story.
Schroeder's directing is more
than adequate, despite the fact
that the first 10 minutes run the
risk of losing some audiences par
tially and others completely until
the violence and more explicit sex
shift into high gear.
It is difficult to distinguish the
screenplay as a job well done from
start to finish, or as a revamping of
ajob botched before. Even still, the
story escapes harsh scrutiny only
because of its bumpy ride down ac
tion road.
As a whole, "Single White Fe
male" is a film difficult not to like,
until one looks closer at what the
film might have been if not imped
ed by Hollywood's version of
progress.
