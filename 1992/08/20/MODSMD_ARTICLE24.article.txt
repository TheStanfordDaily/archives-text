# A 						lovely 'April'

"Enchanted April"
"Enchanted April" is, in a
word, a lovely film. Set in both
Italy and England in the years fol
lowing World War I, the loveli
ness of this romantic comedy is
primarily an asset, but at times a
disadvantage.
The story-line is fairly simple:
four variously discontented Eng
lish women meet when they agree
to collectively rent a castle on the
Italian Riviera. All are trying to
escape their troubles (primarily
men, dead or otherwise) but soon
discover the place affords an ex
cellent opportunity to come to
terms with those problems.
The film is also very much
about the extremely funny ex
changes and confrontations be
tween the four who are, mildly
put, very different from one an
other. The four actresses (Miran
da Richardson, Joan Plowright,
Josie Lawrence, and Polly Walk
er) provide very strong perfor
mances and demonstrate, in the
early stages of the film, facial ex
pressiveness that borders on the
amazing.
Director Mike Newell proves to
be a master of the camera, setting
the pace of the film and adding a
great deal of wit with his manipu
lation of angles and distances.
He essentially divides the film
into two parts: a dynamic, wet
and witty London part, and a lan
guid, sunny and serene Italy part,
with breathtaking scenes of the
Italian countryside. The only flaw
occurs when the focus occasional
ly slips, but that is barely percep
tible.
A more important flaw, howev

er, is the focus of the narrative.
The film isn't very interested in
Italians or the essence of Italy.
Nor does it regard the very real
difficulties of the age.
It isn't even about women, per
se, nor does it take a feminist ap
proach, as one might suspect. One
could accuse it of being too neatly
packaged.

The four actresses
demonstrate, in
the early stages of
the film, facial ex
pressiveness that
borders on the
amazing.

Its Merchant Ivory-like style
also smacks a little too much of
the usual "northern stifled drea
riness" versus "southern passion
ate intensity" scenario.
But only ifyou want the film to
be a very different kind of picture
might you find "Enchanted
April" wanting in substance. If
you can accept that "Enchanted
April" is a light, funny and beau
tiful film about happiness and not
much more, you should have no
problems enjoying it enormously.
In fact, it is the kind of film
that grows on you, and which be
comes all the more pleasant to
think about a few days later. If the
ending annoys you, you have to
allow that the film is, after all, one
about enchantment.
