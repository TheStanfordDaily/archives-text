# Local 'Butterfly' takes flight

### Janar Stewart Editorial staff 
"Only a man knows how a
woman is supposed to act," de
clares Rene Gallimard, the main
character in David Henry
Hwang's piercing "M. Butterfly."
This sexist remark exemplifies
the direct language and straight
forward tone of Theatre Works*
latest presentation.
Written as a criticism of Pucci
ni's opera "Madame Butterfly,"
the Tony Award-winning "M.
Butterfly" successfully unveils
the racism and sexism within the
opera through its language and
challenges the Western Euro
peans and Americans who love the
opera to reexamine that adoration
by portraying Gallimard's pathet
ic life story.
A French diplomat assigned to
China before the Vietnam War,
Gallimard (Mark Capri), a
"Madame Butterfly" aficionado,
finds himself infatuated with
Song Liling (Francis Jue), whom
Gallimard first encounters play
ing the title heroine of "Madame
Butterfly."
Yet the notion that he could be
come like "Madame Butterfly's"
Pinkerton and "capture" his own
butterfly — namely an Asian
woman who would revere him
simply because he is white — ap
peals to Gallimard even more.
From a French prison cell, Gal
limard opens "M. Butterfly" by in
troducing his and Song's affair
that spans two decades. Unfortu
nately for him, the French discov
er that his lover is a communist
spy and a man masquerading as a
woman.
When the French government
punishes Gallimard for sharing
sensitive information with Song
and reveals their homosexual re
lationship to the public, Galli
mard sinks into an intense phase
of denial from which he never re
covers.
To Gallimard, Song is the per
fect woman — delicate, non
threatening, servile. It matters
little that his ideal is derived from
male fantasy.
One can easily understand
why Gallimard, a gaunt, unat
tractive man doubtful of his sexu
al appeal and prowess, tenacious
ly clings to the inferior image he
has created.
More complex, however, is
the larger picture — the rela
tionship between the East and
the West.
In one scene, Gallimard tells a
member of the French embassy,
"Orientals will always submit to a
greater force." He reminds the au

dience of the white world's "inter
national rape mentality" by
claiming that the method of deal
ing with Eastern countries de
mands bigger guns and superior
power.
Capri delivers his lines with a
caustic bite that passes judge
ment on the words parting his
lips.
Jue's effortless performance as
both a man and a woman equally
impresses. Marked differences in
mannerisms, intonation and de
meanor flawlessly evidence his in
credible acting ability.
A majestic set design, authen
tic music and beautiful costumes
accompany the acting, making for
a superb production.
Nothing escapes the scathing
commentary of "M. Butterfly."
After citing the examples of God's
treatment of Eve and King
Solomon's treatment of Jezebel,
Gallimard joyfully cries out, "God
is a man."
Although the biblical refer

ences illuminate the point more
formidably than Gallimard's ut
terance, "M. Butterfly" success
fully illustrates how sexism per
vades the very core of Western so
ciety's Puritanical value system.
Hwang masterfully exposes
and then explores domination and
subjugation in all of its varying
forms and brilliantly encapsu
lates several mature themes in
one two-act play.
Even the nudity, described as
"brief in the show's disclaimers,
is justified by the scenes in which
it appears.
"M. Butterfly" speaks loudest
to men and policy makers, espe
cially well-meaning liberals, caged
by their Western upbringing. In
the scene where Song — now re
vealed as a man — attempts to
convince Gallimard to continue
their relationship, Hwang is dar
ing both males attracted to sub
missiveness and policy makers to
break free from their confining
value system.


Rene Gallimard (Mark Capri, right) faces the ultimate deception from
his lover Song Liling (Francis Jue) in the intriguing "M. Butterfly."
