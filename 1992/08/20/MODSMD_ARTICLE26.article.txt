# Editor's Notebook
## 
### 
If someone had told me at the
beginning of the summer
that I'd be mentioning Guns
N' Roses in half of my columns,
I wouldn't have believed it.
But sigh, I guess it's only for
the public good to make sure
those hardy GNR fans know
that tonight's concert is now
postponed.
The guitarist for co-headlin
er Metallica suffered burns a
while back, and the band needs
time to find a replacement.

Until then, all concerts are off.
. . .At least reeeeally early
GNR traffic won't interfere
with today's San Francisco
Chronicle 50th birthday party
for The Little Man.
Yes, they're throwing a huge
celebration for the fellow in the
derby hat who offers at-a-glance
ratings on movies and plays in
the Datebook section of the
Chron. Festivities start at 11:30
a.m. in Justin Herman Plaza,
despite the fact the Little Man's
real birthday is Sunday.
The birthday cake will be
pink in honor of the Sunday
Datebook — better known as
the Pink Section — and cast

members from Beach Blanket
Babylon will sing "Happy Birth
day" to the little guy.
Personally, I'm surprised
how many people are confused
by the Little Man system, so
here's a quick primer.
— Empty chair
— Little Man asleep
— Little Man sitting up at
tentively
— Little Man applauding
— Little Man jumping out of
his chair, hat falling off head,
cheering, applauding, spitting
milk out of his nose, etc. etc.
Of course, it's more fun to act
the descriptions out.
. . .In 19th century England,
those wacky Brits used to enter
tain themselves with the
"tableau vivant," recreations of
paintings using live actors.
On Sunday, Aug. 30, the
Committee for Art at Stanford
will present a tableau vivant of
the Stanford family painting
"Palo Alto Spring" in the Rodin
Sculpture Garden.
At least the Centennial was
good for one thing: the winners of
the Centennial Jane and Leland
look-alike contest will reprise
their roles in the tableau vivant.

Chris Shuttlesworth, now The
Weekly's former entertainment
editor, thanks you for reading
this summer.
