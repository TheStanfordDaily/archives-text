If fall classes began just one
month earlier, the Stanford noon
time ritual of gathering around the
dorm TV to watch "All My Children"
would become very special indeed.
That's because junior Summer
Sanders, fresh from her four
medal performance at the Olympic
Games, will appear as herself in
the episode slated to air Sept. 4.
"She said she was nervous, but
she came across very relaxed," said
Sheryl Fuchs, a publicist for the
ABC soap opera. "Everyone was
really excited to meet her."
In her scene, Sanders is visiting
the pediatrics wing of Pine Valley's
hospital to show her medals to the
sick children. She gets "a bit lost"
and runs into characters Stuart
(David Canary) and nurse Gloria
(Teresa Blake), who recognize her
from her notoriety in Barcelona.
They talk for a few minutes,
and Sanders gets to show off her
Olympic hardware. Fuchs said
taping of the scene took about 15
minutes, and Sanders got to watch
the rest of Tuesday's filming.

Her mother also appears as an
extra in the episode.
In an appearance on "Late
Night With David Letterman" last
week, Sanders said she was offered
the cameo when show producers
heard she was a fan of the popular
daytime drama.
While in New York, Sanders
also appeared on NBC's "Today"
