Can you name the one-stop shop for ba
bies' booties, fused glass totem poles and
raku pottery? This might seem like the mak
ings of an impossible shopping quest, but
never fear.
You'll find it all — along with live enter
tainment and tasty cuisine — at the eclectic
Palo Alto Celebrates the Arts Festival Sat
urday and Sunday on University Avenue.
Now in its 11th year, the festival is tra
ditionally an extravaganza, with nearly 300
artists and craftspersons displaying their
work, continuous music, outdoor garden
cafes and wine tasting. Hailed by many as
one of the finest outdoor arts and crafts ex
hibitions on the West Coast, Palo Alto's fes
tival is sure to have something for every
one.
Both innovative and traditional arts and
crafts will be on display, including sculp
ture, paintings, jewelry, stained glass,
weavings, ceramics, photography, textile
designs, masks, leather work and wood
working.
Artists and craftspersons from Arizona,
Texas, Oregon and Washington, along with

California's best, will be on hand to discuss
their works with festival-goers. This will be
a great opportunity to talk face to face with
exhibitors about techniques, inspiration
and interpretation.
You might even order custom work.
Many artists are glad to discuss special re
quests, so if you like someone's style and
have a particular thing in mind, don't be
shy.
The festival's entertainment line-up is
equally worth coming out for. Featuring a
number of jazz artists along with a musical
theater presentation, the performances will
keep the positive energy flowing all weekend.
One highlight will be the annual Tea
Dance, featuring an open swing dance com
petition. Taking place Saturday from 3 to 6
p.m., the event features music by the San
Francisco All-Star Big Band led by David
Hardiman. This 19-piece band and featured
vocalist Denise Perrier will perform famous
tunes by Duke Fllington, Count Basie and
Glenn Miller.
Among Sunday's special shows will be a
Theatre Works presentation of selections
from Steven Sondheim's "Into the Woods"
at 12:45 p.m., followed by some jazz from
saxman Ritchie Cole.

The cafes will also showcase special
wines from six different vintners, and the
Webster Street cafe will feature the jazz
piano playing of Palo Alto native Dick Freg
ulia.

Plan on coming hungry, because there
will be five outdoor cafes along the Univer
sity Avenue festival route and several Palo
Alto restaurants nearby, in addition to the
booths of various gourmet food vendors.
