## Staff Notebook Taking the color out of rap 
### 
Several months ago, the rap
group House of Pain released
its debut single, "Jump
Around."
While it wasn't a mind-blowing
addition to recent hip-hop develop
ment, it did make many of urban
music's most devout connoisseurs
sit up and take notice.
What remained to be seen,
however, was the group's musical
consistency. Practically any sim
pleton, with suitable financial
backing of course, can run, gauge
the musical climate and produce a
hit single once.
If our unfortunate simpleton de
cides to plop seven other disastrous
recordings on a tape or compact disc
and call it an album, the hip-hop
consumer gets stuck with ice
baby/wild side clowns, cross-over
rappers who dig diapers and Rick
James, or commercialized militants
who occasionally sound profound.
Well, the album came out a cou
ple of weeks ago, and to my amaze
ment, there wasn't a cut that I
could really bag on without be
coming subjective.
Not since the Beastie Boys' first
album had I encountered an all
white rap group whose sound,
style and verbal delivery hit me as
hard as this posse's did.
Their tracks are rugged and in
ventive, the ideal mixture of per
cussion and other musically de
rived bass lines and obscure, as well
as more familiar, samples. What's
more, the album is extremely ver
satile listening, offering a little for
all of the various species of hip-hop
listeners.
For the brotha with the
"boomin' system" in his ride, every
track hits crisp and hard. If forced
to rate the tracks, however, I'd
have to reserve the number one po
sition for "House of Pain Anthem."
Its constant bass, which isn't so
much a drum rhythm as it is a se
ries of bass notes strung together
in an ominous array, sticks to the
brain long after it's finished.
Further, the delivery of lyrics
by group members Everlast and
"Danny Boy" O'Conner suggests a
hard, no joke attitude often char
acteristic of motorists who choose
to indulge in maximum volume
listening.
And let's not forget that the
primary goal of the arrangement
is to convince listeners that the
band of self-proclaimed "Celtic
savages" can verbally — and per
haps physically — annihilate any
doddering fool, silly enough to
cross them.
This image, in my opinion, even
more so than their hearty rhyth
mic offering, will shoot "House of
Pain" to the top of the hip-hop in
dustry in the next several months
as it did for the Beastie Boys and,
more recently, for the Latino
group Cypress Hill.
The reasons are simple. Ap
pearances and styles of popular
artists in the hip-hop aesthetic, if
you will, are equally important if
not more important than the
music itself.
If you think you're "the shit,"
are damn proud of it, and can ef
fectively convince others of your
superiority, your marketing battle
is 75% won.
Further, though an urban art
form developed primarily by and for
city-dwelling blacks, the majority of
the music's listeners appear to be
young males — especially whites —
living in mainstream America.
Make no mistake about it, if the
only kids listening to Two Live
Crew, Public Enemy or Ice-T were
little black statistics, Tipor Gore
might find something better to do
with her time and leave the deci
sion of what the minds of tomor
row's listeners listen to up to the
minds that conceived them.
No, hip-hop is extremely com

mercial and incredibly profitable
for recording labels wise enough
to sign good artists.
Just like every Joey and
Tommy wants to be like Mike,
every little Irving and Andy Jr.
wants desperately to run around
his neighborhood wearing the lat
est in hip-hop fashion, holding his
crotch and spewing various ob
scenities and slang.
Why, you ask?
Because he'd like to be the
"nigga ya love to hate."
At any rate, for what seemed an
eternity, the easiest way to join
the "nigga" club has been to listen
to his music, and thousands of
young white males have faithfully
paid their dues every time their fa
vorite hip-hop artists released an
other album.
Even though, over the years,
scores of individuals have con
tributed to the molding of the
music, it appears that, in the last
several years especially, non-black
artists have made a larger and
more lasting impression on hip
hop than ever before.
More importantly, these artists
have proven that blackness is not
a prerequisite to make exceptional
hip-hop, nor is it necessarily re
quired to create a marketable style
and image that a majority of con
sumers will appreciate.
Cypress Hill stands as the
model of this phenomenon. Rap
pers B-Real and Simm Dog togeth
er with their D.J., Muggs, released
a hard-hitting funk spectacular
which shot to the status of hip-hop
classic faster than you could say,
"How I Could Just Kill a Man."
Their secret is logical and simple.
They told the urban music world
that they were "the shit" and then
set about proving it. But that
doesn't sound any different from
what a black rapper might do, right?
Yes, and no.
The problem with non-black
hip-hop in the past was that rap
pers and their labels were afraid to
let them be themselves. There ex
isted a sentiment that in order to be
a rapper, you had to kiss a brother's
rear end in order to show that you
were down.
Hence, there emerged groups
like Beastie Boys who did not 'come
out of the closet' as white rappers
until after their single "She's
Crafty" crossed over into main
stream America.
Cypress Hill as a Latino group
had the lyrics and beats to make
the hardest of the hardcore listen
ers say, "Damn that shit's hype,"
and the machismo and pride to
make the hip-hop audience sit up
and take notice.
House of Pain has the potential
to make an even bigger impact on
the world of rap than Cypress Hill,
simply by virtue of their being
white.
The mainstream audience of
urban music may no longer need
to look to Black hip-hop as the blue
print — instead looking to itself to
define the new music.

what a black rapper might do, right?
Yes, and no.
The problem with non-black
hip-hop in the past was that rap
pers and their labels were afraid to
let them be themselves. There ex
isted a sentiment that in order to be
a rapper, you had to kiss a brother's
rear end in order to show that you
were down.
Hence, there emerged groups
like Beastie Boys who did not 'come
out of the closet' as white rappers
until after their single "She's
Crafty" crossed over into main
stream America.
Cypress Hill as a Latino group
had the lyrics and beats to make
the hardest of the hardcore listen
ers say, "Damn that shit's hype,"
and the machismo and pride to
make the hip-hop audience sit up
and take notice.
House of Pain has the potential
to make an even bigger impact on
the world of rap than Cypress Hill,
simply by virtue of their being
white.
The mainstream audience of
urban music may no longer need
to look to Black hip-hop as the blue
print — instead looking to itself to
define the new music.

Several months ago, the rap
group House of Pain released
its debut single, "Jump
Around."
While it wasn't a mind-blowing
addition to recent hip-hop develop
ment, it did make many of urban
music's most devout connoisseurs
sit up and take notice.
What remained to be seen,
however, was the group's musical
consistency. Practically any sim
pleton, with suitable financial
backing of course, can run, gauge
the musical climate and produce a
hit single once.
If our unfortunate simpleton de
cides to plop seven other disastrous
recordings on a tape or compact disc
and call it an album, the hip-hop
consumer gets stuck with ice
baby/wild side clowns, cross-over
rappers who dig diapers and Rick
James, or commercialized militants
who occasionally sound profound.
Well, the album came out a cou
ple of weeks ago, and to my amaze
ment, there wasn't a cut that I
could really bag on without be
coming subjective.
Not since the Beastie Boys' first
album had I encountered an all
white rap group whose sound,
style and verbal delivery hit me as
hard as this posse's did.
Their tracks are rugged and in
ventive, the ideal mixture of per
cussion and other musically de
rived bass lines and obscure, as well
as more familiar, samples. What's
more, the album is extremely ver
satile listening, offering a little for
all of the various species of hip-hop
listeners.
For the brotha with the
"boomin' system" in his ride, every
track hits crisp and hard. If forced
to rate the tracks, however, I'd
have to reserve the number one po
sition for "House of Pain Anthem."
Its constant bass, which isn't so
much a drum rhythm as it is a se
ries of bass notes strung together
in an ominous array, sticks to the
brain long after it's finished.
Further, the delivery of lyrics
by group members Everlast and
"Danny Boy" O'Conner suggests a
hard, no joke attitude often char
acteristic of motorists who choose
to indulge in maximum volume
listening.
And let's not forget that the
primary goal of the arrangement
is to convince listeners that the
band of self-proclaimed "Celtic
savages" can verbally — and per
haps physically — annihilate any
doddering fool, silly enough to
cross them.
This image, in my opinion, even
more so than their hearty rhyth
mic offering, will shoot "House of
Pain" to the top of the hip-hop in
dustry in the next several months
as it did for the Beastie Boys and,
more recently, for the Latino
group Cypress Hill.
The reasons are simple. Ap
pearances and styles of popular
artists in the hip-hop aesthetic, if
you will, are equally important if
not more important than the
music itself.
If you think you're "the shit,"
are damn proud of it, and can ef
fectively convince others of your
superiority, your marketing battle
is 75% won.
Further, though an urban art
form developed primarily by and for
city-dwelling blacks, the majority of
the music's listeners appear to be
young males — especially whites —
living in mainstream America.
Make no mistake about it, if the
only kids listening to Two Live
Crew, Public Enemy or Ice-T were
little black statistics, Tipor Gore
might find something better to do
with her time and leave the deci
sion of what the minds of tomor
row's listeners listen to up to the
minds that conceived them.
No, hip-hop is extremely com

mercial and incredibly profitable
for recording labels wise enough
to sign good artists.
Just like every Joey and
Tommy wants to be like Mike,
every little Irving and Andy Jr.
wants desperately to run around
his neighborhood wearing the lat
est in hip-hop fashion, holding his
crotch and spewing various ob
scenities and slang.
Why, you ask?
Because he'd like to be the
"nigga ya love to hate."
At any rate, for what seemed an
eternity, the easiest way to join
the "nigga" club has been to listen
to his music, and thousands of
young white males have faithfully
paid their dues every time their fa
vorite hip-hop artists released an
other album.
Even though, over the years,
scores of individuals have con
tributed to the molding of the
music, it appears that, in the last
several years especially, non-black
artists have made a larger and
more lasting impression on hip
hop than ever before.
More importantly, these artists
have proven that blackness is not
a prerequisite to make exceptional
hip-hop, nor is it necessarily re
quired to create a marketable style
and image that a majority of con
sumers will appreciate.
Cypress Hill stands as the
model of this phenomenon. Rap
pers B-Real and Simm Dog togeth
er with their D.J., Muggs, released
a hard-hitting funk spectacular
which shot to the status of hip-hop
classic faster than you could say,
"How I Could Just Kill a Man."
Their secret is logical and simple.
They told the urban music world
that they were "the shit" and then
set about proving it. But that
doesn't sound any different from
