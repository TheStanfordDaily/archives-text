## Doublespeak only delays the pain 
### 
IT IS SOMETIMES EASY to forget that budget
cuts cause real pain to real people. The use of
terms like "repositioning," "reshaping" and "re
structuring" makes it even easier.
But when it finally comes down to people being
laid off, these euphemisms are of no help to them or
to the people around them.
The University, having been forced into several
rounds of budget cuts, should not hide behind such
vocabulary.
And administrators should not try to fool them
selves or the rest of the community into thinking that
all is still well.
Yet, such euphemisms are not solely the domain of
administrators facing difficult decisions.
Politicians use them to put a positive face on neg
ative situations, as, for example, in the case of Presi
dent Bush's "revenue enhancement" â€” taxes.
Advertisers use much the same mechanism when
they price something at 99 cents instead of a dollar in
order to lure the consumer into buying their product.
Each of us uses the same approach when we look
for the 'silver lining' in every cloud.
But this is not leadership.
Instead, facing the crisis begins by acknowledging
its existence.
The University cannot afford to adopt the os
trich's approach to solving problems. Nor can we af
ford to resort to deception in order to fool ourselves
into accepting bitter medicine.
Instead, we should be able to acknowledge that a
crisis exists and that the solution will be painful.
The University should not hide behind eu

phemisms. It needs to make it clear that cutting peo
ple is not an easy choice.
This is not done by denying the inevitable. This is
done by cutting the 'doublespeak' and making deci
sions and publicizing them promptly.
Involving those most affected in the decision-mak
ing process cannot hurt either. People need to under
stand how the decisions are being made and what fac
tors are involved in making them.
To keep those affected by the cuts outside the de
cision process until everything is finalized and then
call the cuts "reshaping" or "reconstructing" simply
breeds cynicism and disaffection.
It would be naive to think that Stanford will never
again face similar crises or that it will never again
have to reduce its budget or critically examine pro
grams and services.
But we need to look back on the events of the last
two years and derive from them lessons that may
help us in the future.
The need for openness, for involving the commu
nity, for making decisions promptly and for making
evaluation criteria public are among the more impor
tant lessons for us to learn.
As for trying to euphemise reality, it may work for
a while. It may delay the realization of what is to
come. And it may delay the pain.
But when the axe finally falls and there is no es
caping the true meaning of "reconstruction" and
"repositioning," these words can only exacerbate the
effect on morale and performance.
Such cynical use of semantics simply keeps people
in the dark until reality inevitably hits.
