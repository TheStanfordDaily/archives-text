University should
publicize student
disciplinary cases
Your June 3 issue quotes Judi
cial Affairs Officer Sally Cole as
saying "we would get significant
educational mileage out of a widely
publicized student conduct case."
If this is true for the sexual as
sault case to which Cole refers,
why not make it the rule on all
findings of guilt in student disci
plinary cases?
To single one case out makes
the University seem arbitrary. To
require consent of the guilty prior
to publication is demeaning.
The present system of secrecy
robs campus disciplinary action
of any educational value.
When students, faculty or staff
are found guilty of misconduct,
that fact should be published by the
University, together with a sum
mary of the basic findings and a
reply of reasonable length from the
defendant.
Until that happens, there is lit
erally no way to clear the names
of students never found guilty of
misconduct years or even decades
afler they have graduated.

With 150,000 alumni, those
kind of questions arise with
growing frequency.

Vitamin 'C' can lower
death rates — do not
limit to prescription
Nobel Laureate Linus Paul
ing's daily dose of vitamin C —
18,000 mg or 300 times the rec
ommended daily allowance —
calls into question the RDA.
I have no clue as to why the
RDA is so low. A recent mayor
study of 11,000 Americans (report
ed in the journal Epidemiology)
showed that the lowest death rate
was achieved by those typically
taking five times the RDA of vita
min C.
The ever-intrusive Food and
Drug Administration is currently
seeking legal power to restrict
the sale of large doses of vitamins
to "prescription only."
I wonder if Pauling and others
like myself (I've been taking 50
times the RDA of vitamin C for
years) will be allowed to continue
to take these high levels of vita
min C that have been shown to

lower death rates.

Focus on education,
not entertainment;
Humility is in order
The Stanford sports program
is in need of a dose of humility
and, as a practical matter, a bit of
down-sizing.
Why must you be tennis cham
pions each year? How about a few
mediocre teams without Olympic
stars who play for one or two sea
sons and then appear on the front
of a cereal box?
And football. .. my God.
Stanford playing an extra pre
season game in mid-August at
Disneyland. What, pray tell, does
that have to do with education?
Have you changed from an educa
tional to an entertainment insti
tution?
I graduated in 1964. In 1960,
Stanford football was 0-10.1 am
comfortable with an occasional
zero-win season more than I am
with playing an extra game at
Disneyland in August.
After pride comes the fall.
