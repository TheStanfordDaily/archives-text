## Bookstore getting rid of perquisites 
### 
While the California Attorney
General's office continues its in
vestigation of the Stanford Book
store's compensation practices,
the Bookstore's managers have
disposed of many of the perquisites
previously provided to senior em
ployees, and its board of directors
has outlined reforms for the Book
store's governance.
The directors plan to retain all
the current management, accord
ing to Law Prof. Robert Weisberg,
the board's spokesperson.
Five of the cars formerly pro
vided to senior employees have
been sold, Weisberg said. The lease
on a sixth car has been cancelled.
But the salaries of those employ
ees formerly provided with cars
will be increased this fall to reflect
the loss of the cars, Weisberg said.
The salaries of Eldon Speed and
Philip Chiaramonte, the store's two

top managers, will
also be increased.
Weisberg added
that the increase
will be "less than
what we think (is)
the value of the
perquisites they
will be giving up."
Weisberg
would not reveai

the amount of the salary adjust
ments. "We are not going to be dis
closing publicly financial details of
the Bookstore," Weisberg said.
The board is also attempting to
unravel the Bookstore's financial
arrangement in regard to a vaca
tion home in Twain Harte, Califor
nia. For the past several years, the
Bookstore has leased the home
from Colleagues Management Ser
vices, a consulting firm privately
owned by Speed and Chiaramonte.
Weisberg said the Bookstore
will be "very, very heavily recom
pensed for the money it has put in"
to the house. The Bookstore, a tax
exempt, non-profit corporation
run independently of the Univer
sity, had effectively been paying
off $209,000 in loans Speed and
Chiaramonte obtained in the mid
' Bos to finance the construction of
the home.
Weisberg would not estimate
how much might be repaid.
The resolution could take the
form of a large cash refund or a
fractional share in the ownership
of the house, which would then be
sold immediately, Weisberg said.
The Bookstore has also secured
a lien on the property of former
Controller Patrick McDonald, who
owes the Bookstore $60,000 in con
nection with an unsuccessful in
vestment club he previously man
aged. Weisberg said the debt is "in
collection . . . but not paid back."
The board has outlined a plan
for its own reorganization and
more aggressive oversight of
Bookstore operations.
Under the proposal, the board's
size will be nearly doubled to 15
members. Weisberg said the board
would include "some very sophis-

ticated business
people," adding
that it "will really
start running this
bookstore as
never before."
The revamped
board may meet
as often as six
times a year,
Weisberg said. It

would have several committees
with responsibilities for invest
ments, compensation and nomina
tion of new directors.
The Bookstore's association —
a group of Stanford faculty, staff
and students who elect the store's
directors — would also be disband
ed. Several members have recently
criticized the arrangement, argu
ing that they have no authority
over Bookstore operations.
Weisberg said the association's
involvement has consisted mainly
of an annual dinner meeting and

the election of the board.
The proposal has to be ap
proved by the association, but
Weisberg said it is "extremely un
likely" that its members will resist
the dissolution.
The board has already elected
Los Angeles attorney Mort Win
ston to fill the vacancy left by the
resignation from the board of Soci
ology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch.
Winston was a member of the com
mittee hired by the Bookstore in
May to audit its compensation and
investment practices.
Election of next year's board
has been moved up to October.
The new directors may be elected
by the membership before it abol
ishes itself or they may be selected
by the current board, Weisberg
said.
Weisberg said he did not know
whether any of the current board
members would seek re-election.
History Prof. Peter Stansky, the
board's current president, will be
on sabbatical next year.
The state Attorney General's
office expects to finish its investi
gation early next month. "We don't
know what it will say," Weisberg
said. "They see us as doing things
that are necessary to a complete
resolution. We just don't know if
they're sufficient."
The investigation was prompt
ed by a report in The Daily that the
Bookstore provided its senior em
ployees with a host of lavish
perquisites unheard of elsewhere
in the college-bookstore industry.
The perquisites included use of
a $50,000 motor home, a Book
store-owned sailboat and the vaca
tion home, which the Bookstore
had furnished with a jacuzzi and
satellite dish.

has outlined reforms for the Book
store's governance.
The directors plan to retain all
the current management, accord
ing to Law Prof. Robert Weisberg,
the board's spokesperson.
Five of the cars formerly pro
vided to senior employees have
been sold, Weisberg said. The lease
on a sixth car has been cancelled.
But the salaries of those employ
ees formerly provided with cars
will be increased this fall to reflect
the loss of the cars, Weisberg said.
The salaries of Eldon Speed and
Philip Chiaramonte, the store's two

top managers, will
also be increased.
Weisberg added
that the increase
will be "less than
what we think (is)
the value of the
perquisites they
will be giving up."
Weisberg
would not reveai

the amount of the salary adjust
ments. "We are not going to be dis
closing publicly financial details of
the Bookstore," Weisberg said.
The board is also attempting to
unravel the Bookstore's financial
arrangement in regard to a vaca
tion home in Twain Harte, Califor
nia. For the past several years, the
Bookstore has leased the home
from Colleagues Management Ser
vices, a consulting firm privately
owned by Speed and Chiaramonte.
Weisberg said the Bookstore
will be "very, very heavily recom
pensed for the money it has put in"
to the house. The Bookstore, a tax
exempt, non-profit corporation
run independently of the Univer
sity, had effectively been paying
off $209,000 in loans Speed and
Chiaramonte obtained in the mid
' Bos to finance the construction of
the home.
Weisberg would not estimate
how much might be repaid.
The resolution could take the
form of a large cash refund or a
fractional share in the ownership
of the house, which would then be
sold immediately, Weisberg said.
The Bookstore has also secured
a lien on the property of former
Controller Patrick McDonald, who
owes the Bookstore $60,000 in con
nection with an unsuccessful in
vestment club he previously man
aged. Weisberg said the debt is "in
collection . . . but not paid back."
The board has outlined a plan
for its own reorganization and
more aggressive oversight of
Bookstore operations.
Under the proposal, the board's
size will be nearly doubled to 15
members. Weisberg said the board
would include "some very sophis-

ticated business
people," adding
that it "will really
start running this
bookstore as
never before."
The revamped
board may meet
as often as six
times a year,
Weisberg said. It

would have several committees
with responsibilities for invest
ments, compensation and nomina
tion of new directors.
The Bookstore's association —
a group of Stanford faculty, staff
and students who elect the store's
directors — would also be disband
ed. Several members have recently
criticized the arrangement, argu
ing that they have no authority
over Bookstore operations.
Weisberg said the association's
involvement has consisted mainly
of an annual dinner meeting and

the election of the board.
The proposal has to be ap
proved by the association, but
Weisberg said it is "extremely un
likely" that its members will resist
the dissolution.
The board has already elected
Los Angeles attorney Mort Win
ston to fill the vacancy left by the
resignation from the board of Soci
ology Prof. Sanford Dornbusch.
Winston was a member of the com
mittee hired by the Bookstore in
May to audit its compensation and
investment practices.
Election of next year's board
has been moved up to October.
The new directors may be elected
by the membership before it abol
ishes itself or they may be selected
by the current board, Weisberg
said.
Weisberg said he did not know
whether any of the current board
members would seek re-election.
History Prof. Peter Stansky, the
board's current president, will be
on sabbatical next year.
The state Attorney General's
office expects to finish its investi
gation early next month. "We don't
know what it will say," Weisberg
said. "They see us as doing things
that are necessary to a complete
resolution. We just don't know if
they're sufficient."
The investigation was prompt
ed by a report in The Daily that the
Bookstore provided its senior em
ployees with a host of lavish
perquisites unheard of elsewhere
in the college-bookstore industry.
The perquisites included use of
a $50,000 motor home, a Book
store-owned sailboat and the vaca
tion home, which the Bookstore
had furnished with a jacuzzi and
satellite dish.

While Stanford Bookstore managers have disposed of many perquisites, they have not yet decided what
to do with the Bookstore's leased vacation home in Twain Harte, Calif. The house is furnished with a
Jacuzzi and satellite dish purchased through Bookstore funds.
