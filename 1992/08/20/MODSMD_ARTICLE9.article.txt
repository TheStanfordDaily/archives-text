# Rice speech rouses GOP

Calling the U.S. military "the
real Dream Team," Condoleezza
Rice praised President Bush for
his handling of the Persian Gulf
War and credited him with helping
to end the Cold War in her speech
Monday night at the Republican
National Convention.
"Military power is not the an
swer to every question, but to
some questions it is the only an
swer," said Rice, an associate polit
ical science professor. "And
George Bush knows the differ
ence."
Rice's speech, which was inter
rupted several times by cheering
delegates, began just as the televi
sion networks tuned in for their
prime-time coverage at 7 p.m.
It was a highly visible platform
for Rice, Bush's former senior for
eign policy adviser, who is now
considered a rising star within the
Republican party. By contrast,
California's two Republican candi
dates for Senate, John Seymour

and Bruce Herschensohn, had to
settle for early-morning speeches
on Monday.
Rice praised Bush for guiding
"the historic change that has
taken place since 1988," and for

laying "the
groundwork for
the triumphs of
democracy,"
from Nicaragua
to Eastern Eu
rope.
Criticizing the
Democrats for
trying to "come to
terms" with com-

munism, Rice said Bush and for
mer President Ronald Reagan
stood firm. Their policies, she said,
sent a message of freedom "so loud
and so clear that even the KGB
couldn't jam it."
Rice highlighted Bush's victory
in the Persian Gulf War, and
warned that "dangers still
abound" in hot spots around the
world. But Bush is the man who
can contain them, she said.
"As the community of peaceful
nations grows, the desperadoes
and outlaws from Baghdad to Bel
grade are still there and must be
dealt with," Rice said. "In a per
ilous world, President George
Bush knows that you cannot put a
price tag on peace."
Rice linked her comments on
foreign policy to a traditional Re
publican theme — values — and
implicitly criticized Bill Clinton,
the Democratic nominee, for lack
ing them.
"Today, we hear much about
the need for change," Rice said.
"But if change is not firmly
grounded in values, we will only
confuse our allies and embolden
our foes."
Rice is the only black woman to
have served in a top Bush adminis
tration position. She echoed the
comments made by another black
woman — Texas Rep. Barbara
Jordan at the 1976 Democratic
convention — when she discussed
the impact race has had on her life.
"When the Founding Fathers
said, 'We the people,' they did not
mean me," Rice said. "To them,
my ancestors were property."
Noting that the Republican
party's first platform in 1866
called for the abolishment of slav
ery, Rice said the party deserves
credit for making '"We the people'
more inclusive."
She added: "We should be for
ever mindful that the world looks
to us for an assurance that a
democracy made of many races,
creeds and colors can succeed."
Rice's comments were a strik
ing contrast to those of the speak
er who immediately followed her,
conservative commentator and de
feated presidential Pat Buchanan,
who said: "We must take back our
cities and take back our culture
and take back our country."
In an interview after her

speech, Rice said she enjoyed giv
ing it, and thought it was well-re
ceived. "It was very energizing,"
she said. "There were a lot of peo
ple out there."
And Rice got a final reward: a
thumbs-up from the president,
who called to congratulate her im
mediately after she finished
speaking. "Fie mostly thanked me
for the speech and for the reminis
cences of the end of the Cold War,"
Rice said.
