# Northwestern/Stanford Match-ups
## 
### 
Len Williams had a career day
in the Northwestern season open
er against third-ranked Notre
Dame, completing 26 of 40 passes
for 281 yards and no intercep
tions. However, the following
week against Boston College, he
had what may have been his worst
collegiate start, completing only
two of eight passes for a total of 19
yards and an interception. In
addition to passing woes, Williams
will also have to worry about Ron
George; in two games George has
five quarterback sacks for a loss of
36 yards.

Wildcat running back Terry
Smith has established himself as
the Northwestern running back
of the present. Against Boston
College, Smith accounted for all
but eight of his team's yards on
offense, and currently leads the
team in carries and total yards
gained. However, he has a tough
mission in going up against the
Cardinal defense. Tom Williams
and company are allowing their
opponents under 60 yards of
rushing per game so far this sea
son, and running backs are aver
aging a measly 1.9 yards a carry
against them.

Ellery Roberts had an out
standing performance against
Oregon, carrying the ball 22 times
for a career-high 54 yards. While
the big fullback has a tough time
replacing a player of Tommy
VardelTs stature, his effectiveness
is essential if the Cardinal is to
open up the passing attack. It will
be the responsibility of Steve
Ostrowski and the other Wildcat
linebackers to try hold the Cardi
nal running game to a non-threat
so as to concentrate more on the
passing attack.

Defensive backfields are find
ing it more and more difficult to
stop Steve Stenstrom. Against the
Ducks, the sophomore quarter
back threw for a career-best 353
yards on 26 completions. Greg
Gill is probably the best talent in
the defensive backfield for the
Wildcats, and will most likely see a
lot of action in double coverage
and touchdown-saving tackles
when Glyn Milburn breaks into
the secondary.

What could Bill Walsh and
Northwestern head coach Gary
Barnett possibly have in com
mon? They are both first year
head coaches in their respective
stints. Bennett hasn't had the
best of luck with his new team so
far his team has been outscored
91-7. Walsh, on the other hand,
has three Super Bowl rings. The
early nod is going to have to go in
the slight favor of the latter.

With an average GMAT score
of 665, the Stanford Business
School destroys Northwestern's
Kellogg B-School's anemic 640.
But more importantly, the aver
age Stanford grad pulls $60,500
their first year in the field while
the kids from Evanston have to
scrape by with $54,000. To add
insult to injury, Northwestern's
tuition is $75 more per year. And
not only is it twice as easy to get
into Kellogg, but yuppies-in-train
ing are twice as likely to get their
tongues stuck to a flagpole during
their three years there.
