# Improving Northwestern seeking to upset
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Having alumni like NFL com
mentators Brent Musburger, Irv
Cross and Mike Adamle, the
Northwestern Wildcats may talk
about football better than they
play it.
Long known as one of the worst
squads in Division I, Northwest
ern has done nothing to rid itself
of that reputation in a 42-7 loss to
Notre Dame and a 49-0 shutout at
the hands of Boston College.
However, there were a few
bright spots for the Wildcats
opening week. The Fighting Irish
had only a touchdown lead head
ing into the third quarter and
Northwestern amassed more
than 400 yards in total offense.
Wildcat quarterback Len
Williams had a career day against
Notre Dame. He completed 26 of
40 passes for 281 yards. However,
he didn't continue the respectable
performance against Boston Col
lege.
Williams connected on only 2
of 8 attempts for 19 yards. The
Eagles held the Northwestern
offense to 75 yards in the game
and zero first downs in the second
half.
While the Wildcats got up for
the clash with then-No. 3 Notre
Dame, they could not sustain
that high against Boston College.
"If we don't play at an emo

tional peak, we are not physically
good enough to play the teams on
our schedule," said first-year
head coach Gary Barnett.
And since Northwestern plays
seven 1991 bowl teams this year,
the Wildcats will be hard pressed
to win even with an emotional
edge.

Barnett left his post of offen
sive coordinator at Colorado to
take over the reins at Northwest
ern. He hopes to bring a winning
tradition with him and continues
to be optimistic despite the
defeats.
However, Barnett follows a
string of successful coaches who
have been unable to win in
Evanston, 111. Among those is
Dennis Green, current Minneso
ta Vikings head coach and former
Stanford helmsman who led the
Cardinal to an Aloha Bowl bid
last year.
Barnett is trying to model his
squad after Stanford. Northwest
ern is the only private school in
the Big Ten and its admission
standards are considered a major
hurdle to building a successful
football program.
But what might be just as
large of an obstacle is North west
ern's tradition of losing. The
Wildcats have notched only seven
victories in the last four seasons.
Three of those came in 1991
when Northwestern upset both
Illinois and Michigan State.

The media guide tells readers
to "Expect Victory," but a posi
tive attitude alone is unlikely to
make winners out of the Wild
cats. The squad has shown little
prowess in the First two games
and will face an experienced Stan
ford defense and a sophisticated
offense led by Steve Stenstrom
and Glyn Milburn.
"Glyn Milburn is a great play
er," Barnett said. "They all play
so well within Coach (Bill)
Walsh's system. We must stop
Milburn to have any chance for
success."
That will be a difficult task for
the Wildcat defense, which has
already been plagued by injuries.
Three linebackers and one defen
sive back were hurt before the
season started, and strong safety
Korey Singleton suffered a
pinched nerve recently and may
not play.
Also questionable are quarter
back Len Williams and right
guard Jeff Pietrowski.
The good news for the Wild
cats is that sophomore running
back Dennis Lundy is expected to
return to action. In a back-up role
last year, he ran for 568 yards on
142 carries.
The two teams have met only
four times and Stanford leads the
series 2-1-1.
But Northwestern won the
most recent matchup 28-0
back in 1958.
