# Abrams kicks life into Cardinal game
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
Against the University of Ore
gon Ducks last Saturday, Stan
ford fans saw what could be a
bright future for the kicking game
as freshman Eric Abrams took
the field for the first time.
In the first game of this season,
a 10-7 loss to Texas A&M in the
Disneyland Pigskin Classic,
junior Aaron Mills missed his lone
field goal attempt. Although
hardly a disaster, Mills' failure to
produce prompted head coach Bill
Walsh to give Abrams his colle
giate debut.
Abrams was informed of the
change the day following the first
game. When he stepped in front
of the Stanford Stadium crowd of
43,656, he was understandably
nervous.
Kicking from the right hash
mark, Abrams nailed the 29-yard
field goal to put the Cardinal
ahead, 3-0, with 4:38 remaining
in the first quarter.
"In my mind, there's no such
thing as a chip shot. That first
field goal was real important to
me," said Abrams, "After that, I
was as relaxed as could be."
On the last play of the first half,
Abrams proved how relaxed he
was by kicking a 38-yarder from
the left side. The play before,
coach Walsh had postponed the
attempt, ostensibly to get closer
for Abrams. As he has shown both
in high school and in practice, the
extra yards were unnecessary.
"Psychologically it helped,"
said Abrams. "But that kick
would have gone from the previ
ous spot."

Abrams attended La Jolla
Country Day near San Diego,
Calif. The schools in his league
were small and played eight-man
football. If he had played any
other position, the transition to
major college football would have
been extremely difficult.
"For me it's the same," said
Abrams of the change from eight
to eleven-man football. "Kicking
is one position where you're kind
of isolated. All you need is a good
snapper and holder, and we have
that."
In high school, Abrams hit
field goals as long as 53 yards. In
addition, he set the national
record for most extra points
kicked in a high school career.
Abrams chose between the
UCLA and Stanford. Leaning
heavily towards Stanford because
of the academics, he only hesitat
ed because of the chance to stay
closer to home. His parents have
supported him by coming up last
Saturday, and they are expected
to be in attendance today.
Although Abrams has not
been given any indication that
the job is his permanently, it's
probably safe to assume that it's
his to lose.
"The controversy will never
end," said Abrams. "On the other
hand, they don't want to play
musical kicker. It just means I'm
kicking to help the team win and
to remain the starter."
With his perfect performance
last Saturday, Abrams took a big
step towards securing the start
ing job. Stanford fans can only
hope that the Oregon game is a
harbinger of the bright future of
the kicking game.
