# 'Cats no match for Card

### Mike Langford Editorial staff 
It would have been the perfect
reunion. Stanford's Denny Green
facing his old team, Northwest
ern. Athletes always love to go up
against their old team, and Green
would have taken the opportunity
to show the Wildcats exactly what
kind of coach they had lost.
It would have been the perfect
time. The fourth-year coach
would have been given a chance
to show college football and the
NFL just what he had done with a
mediocre-at-best team in four
short years. The vision of past
versus present which would end
up telling the nation just what
the Stanford Cardinal had
become, and just what kind of
coach it possessed.
It would have been perfect.
But the Minnesota Vikings
pounced upon Green and invest
ed in his great talents before any
one had the chance to see them so
exhibited. So now what kind of
show is the nation stuck with?
The timing couldn't possibly
have been better. The then NBC
football analyst Walsh was about to
return to the San Fransisco 49ers,
with whom he had three Super
Bowl victories and laid the ground
work for a fourth. However, it was

about that time that the Vikings
snatched up Green, creating a
vacancy in the head coaching posi
tion at Stanford. And so it was on a
drive one day that Walsh decided
that he would return to the school
where he had coached 14 years ago.
So Stanford loses their beloved
and successful coach, but gets his
legendary mentor. And now this
game is not just a chance for the
1992 Cardinal to show everyone
the Pac-10 powerhouse that it has
become, as it would have been with
Green. With Walsh, it is not only
an assumed victory, but it is simply
a short stop on the way to an
expected date on New Year's Day.
But while today's game with
Northwestern (0-2) should be a
mismatch, the No. 18-ranked
Cardinal will be able to use the
contest to test themselves and to
overcome some internal obstacles.

In each of its two games so far
this season, the Stanford offense
has performed below expectations.
Although it faced one of the top
defenses in the country in the
opening game of the season, Bill
Walsh-run offenses are expected
to produce big numbers and learn
the weaknesses of opposing
defenses as the game progresses,
which didn't happen against the
Aggies. In game two, the Cardinal
offense showed more promise, yet

still showed room for improve
ment. Stanford did score 21 points
against a sub-par Oregon Duck
defense, but had the opportunity
to put much more on the board if
not for four turnovers.
And the Wildcats are no
slouches. Although they did get
shut out by Boston College last
weekend, Northwestern had an
excellent showing against Notre
Dame in the season opener. Quar
terback Len Williams and his
team gained over 400 yards
against the vaunted Irish defense.
But Stanford's most intriguing
and perhaps most important battle
will be against itself. Can the
offense produce the points that it is
capable of? Can the defensive back
field continue to improve as it faces
better and better passing attacks?
Can the offense replace Bob Whit
field and Tommy Vardell?
These questions will obviously
be answered as more games are
played. Meanwhile, the new head
coach, legend or no legend, is still
a new head coach, and he must
learn and adjust with each game.
Just as Denny Green did three
years ago, Bill Walsh will have to
make careful and methodical
changes to improve the team.
He has three and a half months
until Jan. 1. That should be
enough time.
