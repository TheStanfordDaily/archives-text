The Children and Society Curriculum
is pleased to announce two opportunities for the Fall quarter:
■ History 274:
The Social History of Children in the United States
Professor Margo Horn
Students interested in the Children and Society Curriculum are encouraged
to take this course exploring the place of children in the U.S. from the mid
nineteenth century to the present. How were children perceived and cared for
within families? What was growing up like for children of different classes, ethnic
groups, and genders? What discourse about childhood was developed by emerging
"experts" on children and by society in general? Specific topics include changing
ideas about the nature of childhood as a stage of life, changing prescriptions on
proper child nurture, and the development of child-care institutions.
Enrollment is limited to 25. The class will focus on close reading of required
texts. Class meetings will be Wednesday 1:15-3:05, for 5 units credit."
■ Research Assistant positions
Four quarter-time positions are open this fall for students to work with a
professor on research looking at violence and hate in families and neighborhoods
around the Bay area. These positions carry a stipend of $750 for 10 hours per
week, with no tuition credit. This professor is also willing to consider students
interested in working for credit alone.
Call Don Mordecai at 725-1289 or drop by the Family Studies Center in
building 460 for more information. We are listed in Courses and Degrees under
"Children and Society Curriculum."
