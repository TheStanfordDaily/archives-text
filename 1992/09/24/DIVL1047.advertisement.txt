ME99 allows students to explore answers to these and
many other questions through a series of mechanical
dissection labs. A byproduct of this experience is greater
confidence in "hands-on" skills. Lab time will include
formal and informal oral presentations and a final paper
concerning function and history.
Prerequisites: A keen sense of curiosity. No prior
dissection experience required.
