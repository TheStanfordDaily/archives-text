Applied Earth Sciences - AES 150/250
MINERALS AND WORLD AFFAIRS
This course will examine the role of mineral resources in the
changing international economy of the '90s - and beyond. The
outcome of new political and economic uncertainties in the
area of world trade will be influenced by the extent,
distribution, and potential availability of mineral resources,
placing economic geology at the interface between science and
society Intrinsic mineral wealth must inevitability contribute
to the economic rescue of developing nations; how and by
whom will that wealth be exploited? Emphasis will be on non
fuel minerals. Topics will include (but not be limited to):
International mineral endowment; economic, legal, and
political factors supporting or constraining resource
development (national and international); environmental and
land use issues; trends in substitution and recycling, trading
patterns; factors influencing production/consumption
forecasts; and national policy strategies.

OVERSEAS STUDIES
BERLIN • FLORENCE • KYOTO • OXFORD • PARIS • ROME • SANTIAGO
Beginning Autumn 1993-94 the revised program in Florence offers students with three or more quarters of
Italian language the opportunity to study specially designed humanities and social science courses during Autumn
and Winter Quarters. In addition, students with advanced preparation will be encouraged to pursue their research interests. A
preliminary information sheet will be available early this Autumn Quarter.
Overseas Studies is also in the initial stages of creating a new onequarter academic program in Moscow which may be open for Autumn Quarter
1993-94. We will expect students to have a minimum of three quarters of Russian language background. In later years we may also be able to offer
limited research opportunities for students with advanced preparation. If you are interested, please come in to pick up a preliminary information sheet
and leave us your name and phone number.
In addition, Overseas Studies intends to create a number of research modules at several sites abroad. This Winter we will offer two research modules
in Santiago, one on "Ecology Policy'' and one on "Political Economy of Higher Education and Human Resource Development." In Winter 1994,
we plan to offer a pair of moaules in Puebla, Mexico, that will investigate the cultural and social scientific consequences of North American
integration.
Other opportunities for research are currently under consideration as well. Details regarding the necessary preparation will be available
in the Overseas Studies Office. -
