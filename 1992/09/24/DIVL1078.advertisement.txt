What Do You Really Want
From Your
Financial
Institution?
A T-shirt? Or the best deal around ?
Stanford Federal Credit Union knows the answer.
That's why we make it easy to get free checking. Why we charge no ridiculous fees for going to a teller
or calling about your account and no annual fee the first year for new Student VISAs. Why we start
students with a $1,000 credit line on VISAs, process Student Loans overnight, and keep loan rates low.
And why we believe no promotional gimmick can substitute for low fees on the services you need.
Is the Credit Union really better than the banks?
Decide for yourself.
How the Credit Union does it
We're a non-profit financial cooperative owned by 26,600 Stanford
students, faculty, staff, alumni, and other members of the Stanford
Community. Compared with profit-driven banks, we have different
priorities—and better policies—you can enjoy now and for years to come.
For the best deal around...
If you want the best deal on checking, a truly low-cost Student VISA,
your Student Loan processed overnight, and a lot of fee-free services, the
Credit Union is the place to go.
...stop by the Credit Union
To join the Credit Union and get the best deal on financial services, come
to Tresidder Union, Monday through Friday, September 21 to 25, and
Monday through Friday, September 28 to 30, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Or for
