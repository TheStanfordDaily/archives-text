Give this one to a math major and
watch their brain fry.
Here's a puzzle simple enough for
the average liberal arts major.
We're definitely playing mind games here and we don't mean Psyche
101. Take your best shot at completing 100 increasingly challenging
puzzles that will make you forget what college you're at.
"...Lazlos' Leap is a certified brain-drainer."

Royal Flush scores big points.
The secret "T" combo racks up
your score by multiplying points!
Here's a high stakes game of chance that makes getting the classes you want
look easy. Skill and luck of a poker game combine with the mental manipula
tion and concentration of fast-paced puzzle action. Hey, does this sound like
what your counselor might say?
"...one of the most entertaining hand-held
brain teasers to come out yet."
