# Casper seeks to improve undergraduate education
## 
### Martha Brockenbrough Senior staff writer 
Stanford's new president began his teaching
career at a county jail.
Gerhard Casper joined the UC-Berkeley faculty
as a political science professor in 1964, at the birth
of the free speech movement. One morning early fall
quarter, about half the students were missing from
his class of 150.
"I was told they were all in the Alameda County jail,"
Casper said, characteristically deadpan. Apparently, the
students had been arrested at a free-speedi rally.
"The judge said he would release them on their
professor's recognizance," he explained. "So off I
marched to jail to get my students back."
As Stanford's president, Casper said he plans to
go to bat for students again — by improving the
quality of undergraduate teaching. Casper, formerly
provost and law school dean at the University of
Chicago, said he wants Stanford to be thought of not
only as a great research institution, but as a great
teaching institution.
The first Stanford president in 25 years to be
brought in from the outside, Casper was widely
described as scholarly, witty and diplomatic when he

was named Stanford's ninth president March 17
after a highly secretive, six-month search process.
He assumed the presidency Sept. 1, replacing
Donald Kennedy, who had led Stanford since 1980.
Plucked from a pool of 677 nominees, Casper decid
ed to take the job after a long conversation March 16
with then-Board of Trustees President James Gaither,
who assured Casper that financial support would be
available for growth and "intellectual innovation."
Stanford spent much of last year struggling with
the grim task of cutting its operating budget by $43
million, or 10 percent. The fiscal crisis forced deep
cuts in the drama and music departments, the
administration and the libraries, along with the clo
sure of an overseas campus in Salamanca, Spain.
Casper, however, was convinced that Stanford
would have the resources to rebound. "If the notion
was that for the next few years the administration
had no other task but to reduce expenditures," he
said, "the job was not for me."
Only nine days after taking office, Casper took a
step toward cutting costs by announcing a major
restructuring of the University's administration,
which had come under growing criticism for its
unnecessary, corporate-style com
plexity.
The moves, announced Sept. 9,
reduce the number of vice presi
dential positions to four, down
from the 10 established under
Kennedy.
Casper's first major action as
president was applauded by most
faculty members, who had wor
ried that Stanford's academic
mission was becoming increasing
ly overshadowed by a top-heavy
administration during the 1980s.
"It's giving the University back
to the faculty," Art History Prof.
Albert Elsen said.
The restructuring is expected
to save as much as $1 million.
Casper plans to divert the savings
to the University's library system,
which has been forced to shed a
quarter of its budget by fall 1993.
Taking on teaching
In the months before he took
office, Casper continually stressed
his commitment to improving the
quality of teaching at Stanford.
His own fame as a teacher with a
good sense of humor seems sur
prising given his traditional aca
demic background and upright,
deliberate bearing.
A graduate of German univer
sities in Freiburg and Hamburg,

Casper came to the United States
to study law — and remained
because he was "captivated" by
American universities.
He graduated from Yale Law
School in 1962, then taught polit
ical science at UC-Berkeley. After
joining the University of Chicago
law school faculty in 1969, Casper
served as dean of the law school
from 1979-87 and provost from
1989 until June 1992.
Casper said he has rarely had a
discussion with students in which
his own opinion of some things
hasn't been changed. "Students
challenge faculty on their very
own academic ground."
Douglas Baird, who graduated
from Stanford Law School in
1979 and is now a law professor at
the University of Chicago, said
Casper's commitment to teaching
was legendary.
Casper deserves credit for a
"dramatic improvement in the
quality of teaching in the law
school. ... he won the hearts and
minds of students," Baird said.
In a press conference during his
first visit to Stanford last spring,
Casper said even an institution
with Stanford's reputation can be
"mediocre in some ways." Mediocre
teaching — if he fmds it — is some
thing he intends to ferret out.
Casper plans to put himself on
the line, too. In his first day on
the job Sept. 1, he announced that
he will teach an undergraduate
course on constiti ,f ional law, his

specialty, next year.
Plans to listen
Casper's management style
echoes his attitude: Listen and
you will learn.
He said he plans to talk with
students, faculty and staff before
making specific plans.
At Chicago's law school,
Casper set up town meetings
where he met with students.
Baird, who was Casper's associate
dean, said discussions ranged
from faculty hiring to the price of
coffee at the school.
Casper called his perspective as
an outsider a strength because it
enables him to ask questions that
others may have overlooked for a
while.
But some faculty have
expressed concern that an admin
istrator from a reputedly conser
vative place like Chicago will
undermine progress toward diver
sity that Stanford has made under
Kennedy. But Casper denies that
Chicago is traditionalist.
"That is one of those stereo
types that is about as correct as
the opposite stereotype that at
Stanford, students play tennis all
day,"he said. "[Chicago] has not
been traditional except that it has
always put a lot of emphasis on
the quality of scholarship that
takes place at the university."

quality of undergraduate teaching. Casper, formerly
provost and law school dean at the University of
Chicago, said he wants Stanford to be thought of not
only as a great research institution, but as a great
teaching institution.
The first Stanford president in 25 years to be
brought in from the outside, Casper was widely
described as scholarly, witty and diplomatic when he

was named Stanford's ninth president March 17
after a highly secretive, six-month search process.
He assumed the presidency Sept. 1, replacing
Donald Kennedy, who had led Stanford since 1980.
Plucked from a pool of 677 nominees, Casper decid
ed to take the job after a long conversation March 16
with then-Board of Trustees President James Gaither,
who assured Casper that financial support would be
available for growth and "intellectual innovation."
Stanford spent much of last year struggling with
the grim task of cutting its operating budget by $43
million, or 10 percent. The fiscal crisis forced deep
cuts in the drama and music departments, the
administration and the libraries, along with the clo
sure of an overseas campus in Salamanca, Spain.
Casper, however, was convinced that Stanford
would have the resources to rebound. "If the notion
was that for the next few years the administration
had no other task but to reduce expenditures," he
said, "the job was not for me."
Only nine days after taking office, Casper took a
step toward cutting costs by announcing a major
restructuring of the University's administration,
which had come under growing criticism for its
unnecessary, corporate-style com
plexity.
The moves, announced Sept. 9,
reduce the number of vice presi
dential positions to four, down
from the 10 established under
Kennedy.
Casper's first major action as
president was applauded by most
faculty members, who had wor
ried that Stanford's academic
mission was becoming increasing
ly overshadowed by a top-heavy
administration during the 1980s.
"It's giving the University back
to the faculty," Art History Prof.
Albert Elsen said.
The restructuring is expected
to save as much as $1 million.
Casper plans to divert the savings
to the University's library system,
which has been forced to shed a
quarter of its budget by fall 1993.
Taking on teaching
In the months before he took
office, Casper continually stressed
his commitment to improving the
quality of teaching at Stanford.
His own fame as a teacher with a
good sense of humor seems sur
prising given his traditional aca
demic background and upright,
deliberate bearing.
A graduate of German univer
sities in Freiburg and Hamburg,

Casper came to the United States
to study law — and remained
because he was "captivated" by
American universities.
He graduated from Yale Law
School in 1962, then taught polit
ical science at UC-Berkeley. After
joining the University of Chicago
law school faculty in 1969, Casper
served as dean of the law school
from 1979-87 and provost from
1989 until June 1992.
Casper said he has rarely had a
discussion with students in which
his own opinion of some things
hasn't been changed. "Students
challenge faculty on their very
own academic ground."
Douglas Baird, who graduated
from Stanford Law School in
1979 and is now a law professor at
the University of Chicago, said
Casper's commitment to teaching
was legendary.
Casper deserves credit for a
"dramatic improvement in the
quality of teaching in the law
school. ... he won the hearts and
minds of students," Baird said.
In a press conference during his
first visit to Stanford last spring,
Casper said even an institution
with Stanford's reputation can be
"mediocre in some ways." Mediocre
teaching — if he fmds it — is some
thing he intends to ferret out.
Casper plans to put himself on
the line, too. In his first day on
the job Sept. 1, he announced that
he will teach an undergraduate
course on constiti ,f ional law, his

specialty, next year.
Plans to listen
Casper's management style
echoes his attitude: Listen and
you will learn.
He said he plans to talk with
students, faculty and staff before
making specific plans.
At Chicago's law school,
Casper set up town meetings
where he met with students.
Baird, who was Casper's associate
dean, said discussions ranged
from faculty hiring to the price of
coffee at the school.
Casper called his perspective as
an outsider a strength because it
enables him to ask questions that
others may have overlooked for a
while.
But some faculty have
expressed concern that an admin
istrator from a reputedly conser
vative place like Chicago will
undermine progress toward diver
sity that Stanford has made under
Kennedy. But Casper denies that
Chicago is traditionalist.
"That is one of those stereo
types that is about as correct as
the opposite stereotype that at
Stanford, students play tennis all
day,"he said. "[Chicago] has not
been traditional except that it has
always put a lot of emphasis on
the quality of scholarship that
takes place at the university."

Incoming University President Gerhard Casper talks with students soon after he accepted the presi
dency. Casper, formerly provost and law school deari at the University of Chicago, was the first Stan
ford president in 25 years to be brought in from the outside.
Stanford's new president began his teaching
career at a county jail.
Gerhard Casper joined the UC-Berkeley faculty
as a political science professor in 1964, at the birth
of the free speech movement. One morning early fall
quarter, about half the students were missing from
his class of 150.
"I was told they were all in the Alameda County jail,"
Casper said, characteristically deadpan. Apparently, the
students had been arrested at a free-speedi rally.
"The judge said he would release them on their
professor's recognizance," he explained. "So off I
marched to jail to get my students back."
As Stanford's president, Casper said he plans to
go to bat for students again — by improving the
