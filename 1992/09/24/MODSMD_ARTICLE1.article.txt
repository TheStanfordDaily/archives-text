# Casper seeks to improve undergraduate education

Stanford's new president began his teaching
career at a county jail.
Gerhard Casper joined the UC-Berkeley faculty
as a political science professor in 1964, at the birth
of the free speech movement. One morning early fall
quarter, about half the students were missing from
his class of 150.
"I was told they were all in the Alameda County jail,"
Casper said, characteristically deadpan. Apparently, the
students had been arrested at a free-speedi rally.
"The judge said he would release them on their
professor's recognizance," he explained. "So off I
marched to jail to get my students back."
As Stanford's president, Casper said he plans to
go to bat for students again â€” by improving the
quality of undergraduate teaching. Casper, formerly
provost and law school dean at the University of
Chicago, said he wants Stanford to be thought of not
only as a great research institution, but as a great
teaching institution.
The first Stanford president in 25 years to be
brought in from the outside, Casper was widely
described as scholarly, witty and diplomatic when he

was named Stanford's ninth president March 17
after a highly secretive, six-month search process.
He assumed the presidency Sept. 1, replacing
Donald Kennedy, who had led Stanford since 1980.
Plucked from a pool of 677 nominees, Casper decid
ed to take the job after a long conversation March 16
with then-Board of Trustees President James Gaither,
who assured Casper that financial support would be
available for growth and "intellectual innovation."
Stanford spent much of last year struggling with
the grim task of cutting its operating budget by $43
million, or 10 percent. The fiscal crisis forced deep
cuts in the drama and music departments, the
administration and the libraries, along with the clo
sure of an overseas campus in Salamanca, Spain.
Casper, however, was convinced that Stanford
would have the resources to rebound. "If the notion
was that for the next few years the administration
had no other task but to reduce expenditures," he
said, "the job was not for me."
Only nine days after taking office, Casper took a
step toward cutting costs by announcing a major
restructuring of the University's administration,
which had come under growing criticism for its
