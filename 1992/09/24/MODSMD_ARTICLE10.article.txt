# Economy improves unevenly
##

WASHINGTON (AP) - Eco
nomic activity improved slowly
this month in most of the nation.
But a few areas of the country,
notably California, are still declin
ing, the Federal Reserve said
yestersday in its last review of
business conditions before
November's presidential election.
Analysts said the central
bank's latest "beige book" report,
named after the color of its cover,
appeared a shade more optimistic
than its previous report in early
August.
"Economic activity has been
improving slowly in most of the
nation, but the pace of recovery
has been uneven across regions
and sectors," the report said.
The modest improvement
noted by some business people in
discussions with the Federal

Reserve's 12 regional banks will
not be enough to prevent mone
tary policymakers from cutting
interest rates again to boost eco
nomic growth, analysts predicted.
Bush administration officials,
anxious for a pre-election eco
nomic stimulus, continue to press
for lower rates.
"Last time, the glass was half
empty. This time, it's half full.
There might be a slightly more
upbeat tone there, but I don't
really see much difference," said
economist Robert G. Dederick of
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
The report found weakening
conditions only in the areas cov
ered by its San Francisco and
Chicago banks.
"Weakness persists in Califor
nia," the San Francisco bank
said. "Pessimism is increasing

among. . .business leaders."
It said aerospace and defense
manufacturers continued to cut
production. Tourism jobs are
down in Los Angeles because of
the riots. A cut in state assistance
is expected to produce layoffs by
local governments.
"California represents about
an eighth of the national econo
my. It's weak and it appears to be
getting weaker, not stronger,"
said economist Paul Get man of
Regional Financial Associates in
West Chester, Pa.
"It's really impossible for the
United States to have a robust
recovery if California is still in a
recession," he said.
In addition, the report said
Hurricane Andrew probably will
stimulate the economies of Flori
da and Louisiana.
