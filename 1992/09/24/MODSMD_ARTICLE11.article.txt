# Casper's Movers & Shakers
## 
### 
Geoffrey Cox
Vice Provost for institutional Plan
ning
Age: 36
Degrees: Knox College — 8.A.,
philosophy, 1977; University of
Chicago — M.A., philosophy,
1978; Ph.D., philosophy, 1987.
Time at Stanford: 0
Cox, who worked closely with
Gerhard Casper as an associate
provost at the University of
Chicago, will begin work at
Stanford Nov. 1.
He will assume a new post
created by Casper this month as
a part of his administrative
restructuring.
Cox will report to both
Casper and Provost Gerald

Lieberman, working as an "academic troubleshooter" in evaluating
and developing long-range academic policies.
"This is a person who has the trust of the president," said one fac
ulty member familiar with administrative issues. "This person is a
real facilitator. Casper needs someone he can tell, 'Help me do Pro
gram X,' and this person will know how to push the right buttons."
Cox said he plans to keep in contact with all the University offices,
from student affairs to the academic departments, and also act as a
link to the University's financial side.
When both he and Casper were at the University of Chicago, Cox
said, they "spent a good part of many days together trying to piece
together the budget issues" that the University faced.

Officially, she is to "pro
vide support for the academic
mission of the University," but as Edmonds says, her main goal is to
"get them (students) here and keep them here."
Her main responsibility is enhancing the quality of Stanford stu
dent life. All the departments that affect student life — such as
Housing, Residential Education, Food Service and even fraternities
and sororities — report to her.
While each of these departments will basically be managing them
selves, Edmonds will be setting general policy.
Edmonds herself reports directly to Provost Gerald Lieberman,
but she will also be working closely with Gerhard Casper. She says
she expects to have a role in shaping the University during the next
few years of change.
"It's one of the challenges 1 knew was facing me here," she said.

Mary Edmonds
Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs
Degrees: Spelman College —
A.8., Biology, 1953; University of
Wisconsin at Madison — Certifi
cate in Physical Therapy, 1954;
Case Western Reserve — M.S.,
Health Studies, 1962; Case
Western Reserve — M.S.,
Ph.D., Sociology, 1982.
Time at Stanford: 6 months
Although the title has
changed from "Vice President
for Student Resources" to "Vice
Provost for Student Affairs,"
Edmonds' job has remained the
same.

Jean Fetter
Assistant to the President
Age: 54
Degrees: St. Hugh's College of
Oxford University — 8.A.,
physics, 1959; M.A., Ph.D.,
physics, 1962.
Time at Stanford: 17 years
Fetter, the former dean of
undergraduate admissions
known affectionately as "Dean
Jean," begins a new position that
is substantially less public but
decidedly more powerful — "chief
of staff"" of the president's office.
Selected as Gerhnrd Casper's
top assistant in July, Fetter
assumes a job given a vastly
expanded set of responsibilities
since Casper restructured the
administration this month.

Along with managing Casper's staff in Building 10, Fetter will
head most of the offices that had been under Vice President for Pub
lic Affairs Bob Freelen, whose job will be eliminated after he steps
down Feb. 28.
These four offices include Government Relations, which will play
a critical role in solidifying Stanford's financial future by helping to
negotiate a new indirect-cost rate.
Fetter served as assistant to the president once before — from
1977-80, during Richard Lyman's presidency.

John Freidenrich
President, Board of Trustees
Age: 55
Degrees: Stanford University —
8.A., economics, 1959; Stanford
University — law, 1963.
Time at Stanfo r d: 5 years
Elected last June, Freiden
rich will follow James Gaither as
president of the Board of
Trustees.
Freidenrich, who was
elected as a board member in
1987, says that budget cuts and
problems will still remain a large
concern of the board. Last April,
the trustees accepted an operat
ing budget plan that projected a
$10-15 million annual shortfall,
despite the implementation of

the University's $43 million deficit-reduction plan.
The board usually has the final say on any policy changes.
For instance, deficit-reduction plans and tuition increases must be
approved by the board.
Last year, it conducted the national search for a University presi
dent that resulted in the selection of Gerhard Casper.
Freidenrich says he plans to work with Casper to help him during
"the transition and the early stages of the presidency."
Freidenrich has worked with Stanford over the years in several
capacities, serving as national co-chair of Stanford's five-year Cen
tennial Campaign, which raised nearly $1.3 billion, and as director of
Stanford Hospital and Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital.

Gerald Lieberman
Provost
Age: 66
Degrees: Cooper Union —
B.M.E, mechanical engineering,
1948; Columbia University —
A.M., mathematical statistics,
1949; Stanford University —
Ph D., statistics, 1953.
Time at Stanford: 40 vears

A Stanford faculty member
since 1952, Lieberman is an
important mainstay in an upper
administration that has under
gone nearly a complete turnover
in the last two years.
As the University's highest
ranking academic officer, Lieber
man faces the challenging task of
protecting academic programs —
and generating new ones — dur
ing the current fiscal crunch.

Lieberman was named "interim" provost by former University
President Donald Kennedy in February, and is expected to serve only
until new president Gerhard Casper selects his own provost some
time this year.
But Casper won't rush Lieberman out the door because he consid
ers the 40-year veteran an invaluable resource. A former Faculty
Senate chair and dean of research, Lieberman served as Casper's
main adviser during the months before he took office this summer.
The two met for several hours each day as Lieberman brought
Casper, an outsider to Stanford, up to speed.
Lieberman's many years of service to the University have earned
him great trust and respect from the faculty — something Casper
must have as he implements his own ideas.

William Northway
Faculty Senate Chair
Age: 59
Degrees: Stanford — B. A.,
1954; M.D., 1957.
The faculty senate chair is
responsible for leading the bi
weekly meetings.
The faculty senate is a rep
resentative body of the Academ
ic Council, which includes about
1,300 Stanford professors. It
approves degrees and sets Uni
versity policy on curriculum,
academic programs, admissions
and research.
Some issues that the sen
ate has debated in the past year
included easing CIV require-

ments for transfer students and
allowing students to drop courses until immediately before the final
exam begins.
"I mainly see my role as listening to the faculty, keeping the dis
cussion moving and making sure the Senate can talk about what it
wants," Northway said.
But the senate chair, who is elected every year, also sets the tone
for the meetings and can encourage debate on certain matters.
The senate devoted much of last year to discussing the Universi
ty's budget cuts.

John Raisian
Director, Hoover Institution
Age: 43
Degrees: Ohio University —
8.A., mathematics and eco
nomics, 1971; UCLA - Ph.D.,
economics, 1978.
Time at Stanford: 6 years
As director of the fiercely
independent, conservative
Hoover Institution, Raisian has
been credited with improving its
often rocky relationship with
Stanford.
Since he replaced the irasci
ble W. Glenn Campbell, the
institution's head for 30 years,
in 1988, Raisian has cultivated a
smooth working relationship
with the University's top admin
istration.

As a signal of the Stanford-Hoover detente, Raisian was appointed
two years ago to the University Cabinet — Stanford's highest policy
making body, which determines University positions on everything
from multiculturalism to the budget.
The Stanford-Hoover relationship reached its nadir in the mid
1980s, when faculty successfully resisted plans to locate the Reagan
Presidential Library on campus, and a movement to bring Hoover
under "normal academic governance" received strong support.
Campbell, widely regarded as a roadblock to a more constructive
relationship, was forced to step down from Hoover's directorship to
assume the title of "counselor" four years ago.
He had built up an impressive list of adversaries who were glad to
see him go, including University President Donald Kennedy and
Board of Trustees President James Gaither.

Peter Van Etten
Chief Financial Officer
Age: 45
Degrees: Columbia University —
B.A, music and international rela
tions; Harvard University —
M.8.A., 1973.
Time at Stanford:l year
Van Etten is responsible for
overseeing the overall finances
of the University.
Recently, his most important
role has been in negotiating a
new indirect-cost rate with the
federal government. Van Etten
has also supervised Stanford's
short-term deficits, announcing
plans over the summer to pay
for a projected three-year short
fall of $125 million.

This year, with the elimination of the position of the vice president
for planning and management, Van Etten is now also responsible for
overseeing facilities activities such as maintenance, construction and
building planning.
Though a great part of his position still entails looking over and
implementing budget cuts, Van Etten says he will "play a role" in
determining such things as tuition rates, employee salaries and new
building construction.
He said that with the new administration coming in, there will
come "a number of new initiatives reviewing the way the University
has been doing business for the past 10 years — a re-examination of
the issues."
