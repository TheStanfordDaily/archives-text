# Budget plan set to strike first blows
## 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
How can a university overcome a deficit of
approximately $43 million a year?
No one quite knows for sure, but the Stan
ford community is about to find out as the
University begins implementing its carefully
crafted deficit-reduction plan.
This most recent financial plan comes only
two years after "repositioning" — the Univer
sity's euphemism for slicing $22 million from
administrative expenses.
Administrators attribute the most recent
deficit to a number of causes, but the biggest
factors are the huge drop in the government's
indirect-cost rate, smaller increases than
expected in research volume and the recession.
In reducing the deficit by $43 million — a
figure that represents roughly 10 percent of
the University's operating budget — adminis
trators, students and faculty spent almost all
of last year debating and arguing as they strug
gled to reach a consensus over what to cut.
For instance, when a proposal surfaced to
cut the arts in early November, more than 600
people jammed White Plaza to protest. While
their efforts managed to stave off the total
elimination of drama and music, those depart

ments were still among the hardest hit by cuts.
While little (if anything) in the University
escaped the budget ax unscathed, some areas
received particularly large reductions, includ
ing the humanities, the libraries and adminis
trative staff support. The cuts will be imple
mented over a two-year period, and their
impact is already being felt, even in the little
conveniences that the Stanford community
has become accustomed to.
The impact of some cuts, such as those on
the libraries, may not be fully understood until
several years down the line. For instance, the
libraries may lack the money to purchase all of
the books needed to keep a scholarly area cur
rent and comprehensive, leaving the collection
with irreparable damage.
Layoffs have been kept to a minimum
through attrition and an attractive early
retirement plan, but the final tally of staff
reductions is not expected until next month.
The students, however, have already seen
the deficit-reduction plan in action, particular
ly in fall quarter bills.
Stanford was forced to abandon its pledge
to limit tuition hikes to 1 percent over infla
tion, and tuition jumped 9.5 percent this year.
"We made a commitment about holding
down costs, but we have made a much more

fundamental commitment to maintain the
qualify of a Stanford education," said former
Provost James Rosse in announcing the
increase. "We have found that we can no longer
meet both of those commitments at once."
Student services are also likely to feel a
crunch, as they fight a shrinking budget.
Meanwhile, the University is accepting a high
er number of students because several schools
chose to increase the size of their master's
programs to generate more revenue.
While the cuts are being implemented, the
University has been forced to find creative
ways to pay off the short-term deficit, which is
expected to total $125 million.
In a marked departure from past remedies,
the Board of Trustees over the summer agreed
to increase the amount of money taken from the
endowment as well as borrow more than $45
million. But even this deficit-reduction plan is
not expected to balance Stanford's finances.
Last spring, University budget planners
warned of possible annual deficits of perhaps
as much as $10-$l5 million.
While the trustees have committed to avoid
future academic budget reductions, it is
unclear what else can be cut, particularly in
light of the fact that the administrative areas
have borne the brunt of the cuts twice in a row.
