## Marine Mammal Center handles record number of patients 
### Aaron Thode Editorial staff 
"Ophelia," a 220-pound male Califor
nia Sea Lion, was one of over 700 animals
that have been treated this year at the
California Marine Mammal Center in
Sausilito — a record for the center.
He was also one of ten animals that
needed to be transferred last Friday
evening from his spacious holding pen
into a small traveling cage.
M.chael Thode, a 6-foot 5-inch volun
teer vith many years of experience at the
center, looked inside the pen where
Ophelia and his four companions lounged
arouid a swimming pool.
"Let's get it over with," he grimaced.
Alter wheeling the cage inside the pen,
six volunteers grabbed wooden shields and
advanced on the angry animal. The center
managers try not to befriend the wild sea
lions and seals under their care, so that
they do not become attached to humans.
They didn't have to worry about Ophe
lia. He led the group on a merry chase
around, behind, over and into the pool,
near y knocking a board out of one man's
hanc. But the volunteers were careful;
after all, several have been bitten before.
Finally, after much cussing by both
man and animal, Ophelia was herded into
the :age and loaded onto the center's
four wheel drive truck. The adult sea lion
took a while to calm down, giving the
truck suspension system quite a workout.
Nights like these happen often at the
MM2!. Founded in 1975 on an abandoned
missile silo, the center has since cured
thousands of seals and sea lions that have
beer orphaned or injured by both nature
and man.
A non-profit organization with a $1.4
million budget, the center survives because
of the efforts of more than 525 registered
volunteers, 20 of whom are scheduled for
the Friday night shift. Last Friday, they
fed 65 seal lions, 11 harbor seals, eight ele
phar.t seals and one harbor seal. They also
received a rarely-seen Stellar sea lion pup.
Denize Springer, MMC spokeswoman,
said that ordinary citizens often alert the
center about injured animals. If someone
sees an animal that appears sick, "they
should stay away from it, but observe its
behavior," advised Springer.
Since seals and sea lions are protected
by tie Federal Marine Mammal Act, it is
unlawful to touch or harass them in any
way, unless one is licensed. Anyone who
observes an animal in distress should

note if the animal is underweight, weak
or injured. Then they should call 289-
SEAL and give the animal's exact loca
tion if possible.
After an animal is brought to the cen
ter, it is weighed, tagged and given both a
name and physical exam by a qualified
veterinarian. Blood and fecal samples can
give clues as to the cause of its trouble. If
neurological damage is suspected, the
animal receives a spinal tap, wherein
some spinal fluid is drawn from the
spinal column. Finally, volunteers place
the animal in an outdoor pen with a few
other animals of the same species.
"This place is just like a hospital," said
year-long volunteer John McKeon as he
pulled out a file on one of the animals.
"We keep track of every animal." Each
folder compiles the laboratory test
results, prescriptions and volunteer
observations of each seal or sea lion.
As McKeon was checking the files,
another volunteer made a sea lion
breathe medicinal vapor in order to
loosen mucus in its lungs. Others busily
stuffed vitamins and medications into the

gills of herring, carefully labeling which
fish goes to what animal. Thode said
most animals typically eat four to five
pounds of fish per night.

Before 1992 the center
treated 37 gunshot
injuries over an eight-year
period. This year alone 77
animals have been shot
for unknown reasons.

Although one can see the Pacific Ocean
from its headquarters, the center ships its
fish from the East Coast. "We're a non
profit [organization], and it is most eco
nomical to get our supplies from the East,"
McKeon said. "It is the first — and last —
time these animals will eat these fish."
Some animals, however, refuse to eat
any fish at all. These are usually the young
elephant and harbor seals, who often do

not know that fish is their natural food.
These youngsters have to be force-fed a
mixture of whipped cream, blended fish
and ground vitamins and minerals.
The young pups bite readily, so Vi
Brown, shift supervisor, showed a new
volunteer how to feed a young animal
called Kempo: throw a towel over his head,
grab him behind the neck and pin him to
the ground, while straddling his back.
"Get him down immediately," Brown
said. "Don't get your hands on his teeth.
And remember his file — he has diar
rhea."
Cautiously avoiding both ends, the vol
unteer held the squirming pup while
Brown applied shots and another volunteer
fed a sterilized plastic tube down his throat.
"You don't force it — you use the swal
low reflex," she explained. She blew into
the tube and listened for the tell-tale gur
gle that indicates that it is in the stomach,
and not the lungs. Then she poured the
mixture into a funnel connected to the
tube. Squeezing the tube, she pumped the
liquid fish into his stomach. The pups are
"tubed" three times nightly.

"After we tube them for a while,"
Thode said, "we send them to 'fish
school', where volunteers teach the pups
to eat solid fish." They wave fish in front
of their noses, or hose them with water
while hiding, a technique that sometimes
stimulates them to start eating.
"Maybe it reminds them of a rain
storm at sea," Brown said.
After about a week, the slow-learners
are forced to swallow fish to get them
used to the taste.
Eventually either the animal gets well
and gains enough weight to be released, or
it dies. In the latter case, the center per
forms a necropsy to determine the cause
of death and safely disposes of the body.
Last year the center accepted 422
patients — a record at the time. This year
they have already treated more than 700.
Last month more than 200 pinnipeds
overflowed into the parking lot. "We ran
out of tags," McKeon recalled. "We final
ly had to mark them with bleach in order
to keep track of them." They also had a
hard time naming them all
Brown explained that El Nino, the
periodic change in weather that alters
ocean currents off the California coast,
was responsible for much of the trouble.
Normally during the spring, surface cur
rents move offshore, drawing up cold
water rich in nutrients along the shore.
These nutrients allow fish populations to
feed near the surface.
When El Nino occurs, the surface cur
rents hug the shore, no upwelling occurs
and both nutrients and fish remain in
deep water. Young mammals weighing
less than 30 pounds typically cannot
swim deep enough to find food, and they
begin to starve.
To make matters worse, the one fish
easily caught by the young mammals, the
Opah, harbors lungworm parasites. Since
yearlings often beach together, any dis
ease spreads rapidly.
Gunshot wounds are another source of
trouble. Before 1992 the center treated
37 gunshot injuries over an eight-year
period. This year alone 77 animals have
been shot for unknown reasons.
The center has just opened a facility
for sea otters, and within the next five
years it hopes to build cetacean tanks at
another location to treat dolphins and
small whales.
The MMC is open to the public from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Fri
day. Springer said that the center always
welcomes additional volunteers.
