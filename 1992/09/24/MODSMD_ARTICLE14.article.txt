# How one bolt screwed up tether test flight
## 
### Aaron Thode Editorial staff 
Hundreds of people, tens of organi
zations, two nations, millions of dollars
and 14 years had been invested in last
July's space shuttle mission.
Scientists had crammed 13 experi
ments into the Atlantis' cargo bay in
order to observe, measure and evaluate
the world's first attempt to use a large
scale tether to produce power.
After lifting a 1,139-pound satellite
out of the shuttle's bay with a 40-foot
boom, the satellite's thrusters should
have gently pulled 12.5 miles of .1 inch
diameter copper-cored tether out into
the highly charged environs of the iono
sphere, the beachhead between inter
planetary space and the Earth's atmo
sphere.
The combination of the Earth's mag
netic field and the shuttle's motion
might have created a 5000-volt poten
tial across the tether, generating up to
750 milliamps of current — a major
step in establishing a power source for
future space activities.
But a single bolt ruined everything,
and astronauts were almost forced to
pull in the satellite by hand.
To the outside world, the mission
seemed a failure. But Scott Williams,

Stanford project Manger for one of the
mission's experiments, believes that the
use of tethers was actually vindicated
by the mishaps. NASA apparently
agrees, for the space agency is
rescheduling another attempt, perhaps
in another 18 months.
If NASA decides to try again, it is
because the rewards for success are
great. According to a NASA report, had
the tether been fully extended, its five
mile per second motion through the
earth's magnetic field would have gen
erated a large voltage, driving electrons
through a wire inside the tether and
into the shuttle bay, making the satel
lite positive and the shuttle negative.
•The satellite would reduce its grow
ing positive charge by collecting elec
trons from the surrounding ionosphere.
The shuttle would get rid of its excess
negative charge by firing electrons back
into space using electron "guns," or
generators. Thus a complete circuit
would be formed, one leg being the teth
er, the other being space itself. The
shuttle could then draw large amounts
of power from the current.
By expending power to reverse the
flow of current, the shuttle might also
be able to use a tether as a small
thruster.
The project Stanford was involved

with, the Shuttle Electrodynamic Teth
er System, would have measured the
tether current and monitored exactly
how the electron generators dissipated
charge.
That's what should have happened.
But the tether jammed after 800 feet
had been reeled out. A "level-wind"
mechanism, which insures that the
tether unwinds evenly across the
breadth of its storage drum, jammed
against a bolt. Williams said that the
bolt was a last-minute addition to the
payload after engineers had decided
that the original support structure
might not withstand the vibrations
upon launch.
The mishap "was both disappointing
and encouraging at same time,"
Williams said. It was encouraging
because the tether actually worked. The
extended tether did generate 60 volts
and 20 milliamps of current, and the
massive satellite exerted less than a
pound of force on the tether. The astro
nauts expected the tether to vibrate,
twist or be unstable. To their surprise,
the stuck cable was completely still and
steady.
In addition, Williams said the SETS
experiment worked well.
"We got a substantial amount of data
on the outside environment of the shut
tle at three different altitudes," he said.
Such information will be needed to
effectively understand how well the
tether will work.
Stanford is responsible for the data
analysis of the measurements. "We
have months of work ahead," said
Williams.
The SETS system also produced data
about a technique that might boost a
future tether's power. Williams
explained that if one used a "flash-evap
orator" to squirt water vapor around a
negatively charged object, the object's
effective surface area increases, allow
ing the shuttle to slough off electrons
much faster than present electron guns
can.
The faster the shuttle can get rid of
its excess charge, the greater the cur
rent — and thus the power — it can
produce.
Before the tether was extended, the
SETS experiment measured how elec
trons interacted with samples of water
vapor released into the bay. Unfortu
nately, gas from the thrusters also
entered the bay, shorting out the gener
ator's filament. The group used a spare
generator to run the tether circuit
itself.
Williams is confident tethers will fly
again. According to him, NASA is con
sidering another flight as early as
Febuary 1994. He noted that since the
equipment is already built, it would be
"one of the cheapest shuttle flights
ever."

As the space shuttle moves through the Earth's magnetic field, electrons are
forced down the tether into the shuttle's cargo bay (left). From there an elec
tron gun ejects electrons back Into space, while the satellite (not to ecale) col
lects electrons. The shuttle draws power from the completed circuit By apply
ing power to reverse the current flow, a tether might also be uaad to produce
thrust (right).
