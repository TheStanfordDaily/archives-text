# High-Tech dino hunting
## Scientists help search for largest dinosaur 
### Aaron Thode Editorial staff 
Most people visualize dinosaur hunt
ing as rough-hewn men wielding picks
and shovels, not scientists using ground
penetrating radar, amino acid analysis
and radiation detectors.
But that is exactly what is happening
seven miles beyond the gravel pits at San
Ysidro, New Mexico, where Seis
mosaurus, the world's largest known
dinosaur, lies buried.
Based on comparisons with its distant
cousin, Diplodocus, Wilson Bechtel of the
Southwest Paleontology Foundation
estimated Seismosaurus to be about 150
feet long. If true, this dinosaur would be
the longest animal ever discovered. Even
the largest whales are only slightly
longer than 100 feet. Bechtel cautioned,
however, that the size estimate i3 very
rough and subject to change.
Two hours away from the site, at Los
Alamos National Laboratory, scientists
have spent the past seven years revolu
tionizing paleontology with new methods
of analyzing and even locating bones.
Using X-ray florescence studies,
Roland Hagan and his companions in the
Nuclear Materials Technology group dis
covered that Seismosaurus is remarkable
in more than just size. Its fossils are actu
ally bone, not silicified rock. Thus, close
study of these remains has offered a rare
glimpse into the process of fossilization.
Hagan recalled that by means of X-ray
diffraction and electron microscopy, his
group revealed that the apatite crystals
comprising the bone were not crushed.
Following that discovery they managed
to measure the size, shape, and orienta
tion of the crystals.
Neutron activation analysis cata
logued the chemical elements in the
bone.
Based on radioactive dating of both
the bone and surrounding rock, other
Los Alamos scientists tentatively estab
lished the fossils' age to be between 125
to 150 million years. All of this informa
tion will yield clues as to how and why
this dinosaur died, Hagan said.
Meanwhile, Dale Spall and his col
leagues in the Analytical Chemistry Divi
sion made history by extracting protein
from dinosaur bones.
The group described their procedure in
a recent paper. After crushing a core sam
ple from the pelvis and dissolving it in
acid, they studied the resulting solution
by means of high-performance liquid
chromatography and amino acid analysis.
They identified traces of collagen, a com
mon protein found in bone, but the major
ity of the protein remains unidentified.
"I could tell you a lot of protein is

there, but I can't tell you what it is,"
Spall said.
Currently his group is trying to
sequence the protein, but all they cur
rently know is that it has at least 150
amino acids, and that its purpose was to
direct the formation of the apatite crys
tals that are the source of a bone's
strength. According to Spell, the group's
ultimate goal is "to understand the pro
cess of fossilization."
Because the dinosaur's remains are
bone, not rock, its physical properties dif
fer greatly from its enclosing matrix. Sci
entists have thus had great success in
using remote sensing techniques to char
acterize the excavation site. Their efforts
have helped diggers unearth most of the
spinal column, a third of the tail, the
pelvic area, and part of the trunk.
For example, Bechtel explained that
sound travels three times faster in bone
than it does in sandstone. A technique
called Acoustic Diffraction Technology
takes advantage of this fact. Bechtel out
lined the procedure: place a sensor array
in a shaft and then fire an 8-gauge shot
gun into the ground at several locations
along a line. By measuring how long it
takes the shock waves to reach the sen
sor, one can calculate whether a large
mass of bone is nearby.
From the use of ADT and ground-pen
etrating radar, scientists predicted that
the dinosaur was lying on its side. Fur
ther excavation proved them right.
The head, legs and shoulders are still
missing. Bechtel believes that the rest of
the skeleton has been eroded away and
lies buried along a wash leading away
from the mesa. "Several neck vertebrae
have already been found at this location
60 feet away from the main site," he said.
Unfortunately, the surrounding area
is very large and contorted. "The bones
could be one inch away (from the site), or
not there at all," Bechtel said. "I don't
know how you feel about moving rock,
but we want to be certain there is a bone
there before we dig."
Los Alamos is considering two possi
bilities for finding the bones.
Trace minerals in the bone fluoresce,
or glow in the dark. Hagan says one "far
out idea" is to use an ultraviolet laser to
sweep across a mesa or clifT face, and to
pick up any signals with a sensitive
detector. John Lyman of Los Alamos is
currently testing samples of bone with a
laser. "It doesn't look too promising,"
Lyman says."The bones aren't fluoresc
ing enough to be seen."
Another surprising property of the
bone is that it is much more radioactive
than its enclosing rock matrix. This is
true because small pores in the
bone leached out and concentrated
trace minerals in passing ground
water for a brief time after the
dinosaur's death. Thus the bones
have uranium concentrations of
over 150 times that of adjacent

rock, and thus emit strong gamma
radiation.
During the previous excava
tion, scientists used radiation
detectors to detect overlooked
bones around the original site.
Although reliable, the equipment
was bulky and slow.
The latest suggestion the scien
tists are mulling over is to string
thousands of Thermal-Lumines
cent Dosimeters, or "radiation

badges," in intersecting lines
across the river washes below the
site. After a few days, the badges
would be collected and examined.
As the erosion has been fairly
recent, the scientists hope that the
bones are buried relatively close to
the surface, where their radioac
tivity will expose the badges.
"With these 'dinosaur lines' we
would be fishing for dinosaurs,"
Hagan said.
