## Ex-president a master fund-raiser

New students will never expe
rience the presidency of Donald
Kennedy, but they cannot help
but be touched by the legacy he
left behind.
Kennedy, who announced his
resignation more than a year ago
and formally relinquished his
office at the beginning of this
month, has, in many people's
view, led the transformation of
Stanford into a world university.
"There's no doubt that in the
last 10 or 12 years Stanford has
gone from being a top American
university to being one of the
greatest universities in the
world," Charles Hill, a senior
research fellow at the Hoover
Institution, said last spring.
The changes under Kennedy
range from a greater emphasis
on undergraduate education and
public service to a tripling of
Stanford's endowment to rough
ly $2 billion.
Stanford's five-year Centenni
al Campaign exceeded its $1.1
billion goal, making it the largest
university fundraiser in history.
"Not only was he a good artic
ulator of vision but he was will
ing and able to go out and ask for
large sums of money in a very
persuasive, compelling, profes
sional way," said Elizabeth
Sloan, director of communica
tions in the Office of Develop
ment.
Stanford added several new
overseas campuses as well as a
Stanford-in-Washington pro
gram, where Kennedy will serve

as the resident professor winter
quarter.
Kennedy was also at the fore
front of the battle over Western
Culture, which the University
eventually changed to Cultures,
Ideas and Values. The impor
tance of multiculturalism was
also emphasized during the
Kennedy era.
But despite the many accom
plishments of his presidency, it
was the indirect-cost controversy
that forced him to resign and
may forever be tied to his name.
Almost two years ago Stanford
became the target of the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations as it examined
how the University was reim
bursed by the federal govern
ment for indirect costs. These
are the expenses associated with
research that cannot be attribut
ed to any specific project, such as
utilities and libraries.
While Kennedy was never
accused of any personal wrong
doing, he became closely tied to
the controversy, testifying before
the subcommittee and vigorously
defending the University against
government auditors alleging
hundreds of millions of dollars in
overbillings.
"It is very difficult, I have con
cluded, for a person identified
with a problem to be the
spokesman for its solution,"
Kennedy said in his letter of res
ignation.
After a sabbatical during fall
and spring quarters, Kennedy
pledges to work on global envi
ronmental issues at the Institute
for International Studies as well

as return to teaching, which is
where he left his first major
mark on Stanford when he creat
ed the Human Biology Program.
Kennedy will also study at the
World Resources Institute, a
Washington D.C.-based think
tank, while beginning an envi
ronmental studies program at
Stanford-in-Washington winter
quarter.
In the end, many campus

observers predict that Kennedy's
legacy will not be indirect :osts
but the dramatic growth in Stan
ford's national and international
prestige.
"[lndirect costsl will be a
blip," said Emeritus Law Prof.
John Merryman. "In the longer
view, he has been a good presi
dent. . . . The plusses have been a
lot more important than the
minuses."
