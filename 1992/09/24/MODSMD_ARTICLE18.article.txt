# Orientation continues usual focus on multiculturalism
## Programs still emphasize diversity despite loss of educator 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Emphasis on Stanford's reli
gious and ethnic diversity contin
ues during Orientation, despite
smaller budgets and the continu
ing search for a new multicultural
educator and a director of the
Black Community Service Center.
Last year's Orientation includ
ed several programs and welcome
receptions by each ethnic commu
nity and a series of ethnic ban
quets. One program, Faces of
Community, was created by for
mer Multicultural Educator Greg
Ricks and emphasizes Stanford's
diversity and history.
Faces of Community will be
offered this year, although the
work for it has been taken over by
Assoc. Dean of Memorial Church
Diana Akiyama. Ricks resigned
May 12 to take a job as vice presi
dent for education and training at
City Year, a non-profit "urban
peace corps" in Boston.
Akiyama said she helped Ricks
last year and was "basically copy
ing his program. The people will
be new, but everything else will be
the same."
The historical slides in the pro
gram represent "different issues
students have confronted over the
years, and the program centers on
diversity," she said.
In addition to the Faces of
Community program, a religious
diversity program organized by

Akiyama titled "Time and Time
Again" will examine different reli
gions' views of time, said Orienta
tion Coordinator James Wu.
The program will take the form
of a panel discussion with six peo
ple from different religious com
mittees.
In addition, some ethnic cen
ters are sponsoring "parent social
hours" to help parents get
through their fears about leaving
their children, said Barbara
Smith, the acting associate dean of
students and director of the Black
Community Service Center.
Multicultural banquets, tradi
tionally part of Orientation, will
not be held this year, Wu said (see
related article, page 12A).
Smith said the ethnic activities
during Orientation provide "an
opportunity for students of the
various ethnic backgrounds to
know there are systems in place
and forums to allow them to
enrich their cultural heritage."
Replacing Ricks
Ricks' resignation has not
affected Orientation, said Wu and
Assoc. Director of Residential
Education Ann Porteus.
"Because there is no person in
that specific position (multicul
tural educator) doesn't mean
those elements are missing from
Orientation," Wu said. "What
Greg brought to us is still here
with us."
Porteus, who is a member of

the search committee for a new
multicultural educator, said the
group hopes to fill the position by
the beginning of winter quarter.
The committee is made up of fac
ulty, staff and students.
The committee has received
and is now reading about 140
applications. They hope to reduce
that number to 10 or 15 by the
middle of this month, she said.
Eventually the finalists will be
brought to campus and inter
viewed, Porteus added.
Whoever takes over as multi
cultural educator "will both
enhance the community centers
and the University as a whole,"
Smith said.
BCSC looks forward
The position of multicultural
educator is not the only adminis
trative vacancy in Stanford's eth
nic communities. Another com
mittee of faculty, students and
staff has been formed to choose a
new assistant dean of students
and director of the Center, Dean
of Students Michael Jackson said.
The seven-member committee
has received about 80 applications
for the position, he said.
Smith has served as acting
director since Keith Archuleta
resigned June 2 following his
arrest for secretly videotaping
women during photography ses
sions in his apartment.
Archuleta was later sentenced
to four years probation and 200

hours of community service after
pleading no contest to two misde
meanor counts of electronic
eavesdropping.
Education Prof. John Baugh,
the chair of the search committee
said the person who fills the posi
tion will have to be experienced,
service-oriented and flexible.
"We need someone who on the
one hand can talk to the president
or Board of Trustees and on the
other interact informally with
students," he said.
Smith said she is looking for
ward to working with a new
director who has "new ideas and
different perspectives. We did go
through a pretty tough time but I
also feel that by going through
that we have learned and
healed."
However, Smith also said that
she would miss Archuleta. "Keith
contributed a hell of a lot — not just
to the black community but to the
Stanford community and the sur
rounding community," she said.
In terms of qualifications for
either position, "race, in and of
itself, is not the most important
thing to consider," Jackson said.
"There are a number of things you
look for. You look for the best."
Jackson said he is looking for
ward to the future and is "confi
dent we will be able to find two
great people to fill these spots.
Clearly we miss the folks, but it's
also clear we have a lot to go
ahead with."

Former Multicultural Educator Greg Ricks leads a May protest
against the Rodney King beating verdict outside Palo Alto City Hall.
Ricks, the first person to hold the position of Multicultural Educator,
created the "Faces of Community" orientation program and empha
sized that all students are "ethnic."
Emphasis on Stanford's reli
gious and ethnic diversity contin
ues during Orientation, despite
smaller budgets and the continu
ing search for a new multicultural
educator and a director of the
Black Community Service Center.
Last year's Orientation includ
ed several programs and welcome
receptions by each ethnic commu
nity and a series of ethnic ban
quets. One program, Faces of
Community, was created by for
mer Multicultural Educator Greg
Ricks and emphasizes Stanford's
diversity and history.
Faces of Community will be
offered this year, although the
work for it has been taken over by
Assoc. Dean of Memorial Church
Diana Akiyama. Ricks resigned
May 12 to take a job as vice presi
dent for education and training at
City Year, a non-profit "urban
peace corps" in Boston.
Akiyama said she helped Ricks
last year and was "basically copy
ing his program. The people will
be new, but everything else will be
the same."
The historical slides in the pro
gram represent "different issues
students have confronted over the
years, and the program centers on
diversity," she said.
In addition to the Faces of
Community program, a religious
diversity program organized by

Akiyama titled "Time and Time
Again" will examine different reli
gions' views of time, said Orienta
tion Coordinator James Wu.
The program will take the form
of a panel discussion with six peo
ple from different religious com
mittees.
In addition, some ethnic cen
ters are sponsoring "parent social
hours" to help parents get
through their fears about leaving
their children, said Barbara
Smith, the acting associate dean of
students and director of the Black
Community Service Center.
Multicultural banquets, tradi
tionally part of Orientation, will
not be held this year, Wu said (see
related article, page 12A).
Smith said the ethnic activities
during Orientation provide "an
opportunity for students of the
various ethnic backgrounds to
know there are systems in place
and forums to allow them to
enrich their cultural heritage."
Replacing Ricks
Ricks' resignation has not
affected Orientation, said Wu and
Assoc. Director of Residential
Education Ann Porteus.
"Because there is no person in
that specific position (multicul
tural educator) doesn't mean
those elements are missing from
Orientation," Wu said. "What
Greg brought to us is still here
with us."
Porteus, who is a member of

the search committee for a new
multicultural educator, said the
group hopes to fill the position by
the beginning of winter quarter.
The committee is made up of fac
ulty, staff and students.
The committee has received
and is now reading about 140
applications. They hope to reduce
that number to 10 or 15 by the
middle of this month, she said.
Eventually the finalists will be
brought to campus and inter
viewed, Porteus added.
Whoever takes over as multi
cultural educator "will both
enhance the community centers
and the University as a whole,"
Smith said.
BCSC looks forward
The position of multicultural
educator is not the only adminis
trative vacancy in Stanford's eth
nic communities. Another com
mittee of faculty, students and
staff has been formed to choose a
new assistant dean of students
and director of the Center, Dean
of Students Michael Jackson said.
The seven-member committee
has received about 80 applications
for the position, he said.
Smith has served as acting
director since Keith Archuleta
resigned June 2 following his
arrest for secretly videotaping
women during photography ses
sions in his apartment.
Archuleta was later sentenced
to four years probation and 200

hours of community service after
pleading no contest to two misde
meanor counts of electronic
eavesdropping.
Education Prof. John Baugh,
the chair of the search committee
said the person who fills the posi
tion will have to be experienced,
service-oriented and flexible.
"We need someone who on the
one hand can talk to the president
or Board of Trustees and on the
other interact informally with
students," he said.
Smith said she is looking for
ward to working with a new
director who has "new ideas and
different perspectives. We did go
through a pretty tough time but I
also feel that by going through
that we have learned and
healed."
However, Smith also said that
she would miss Archuleta. "Keith
contributed a hell of a lot — not just
to the black community but to the
Stanford community and the sur
rounding community," she said.
In terms of qualifications for
either position, "race, in and of
itself, is not the most important
thing to consider," Jackson said.
"There are a number of things you
look for. You look for the best."
Jackson said he is looking for
ward to the future and is "confi
dent we will be able to find two
great people to fill these spots.
Clearly we miss the folks, but it's
also clear we have a lot to go
ahead with."
