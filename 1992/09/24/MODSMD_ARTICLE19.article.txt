# Lack of money, organization forces cancellation of Banquets
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Tightening budgets, managerial diffi
culties and the stress of the Orientation
calendar have contributed to the post
ponement and possible cancellation of
the traditional Orientation multicultural
banquets.
Last year's banquets ranged from
"Slices of America" to a "Mid-Autumn
Moon Festival" sponsored by the Asian-
American New Student Orientation Com
mittee. Students had the option of attend
ing a dinner which reflected their own

heritage or experimenting with one which
didn't. Most new students attended the
banquets, according to Ann Porteus, asso
ciate director of Residential Education.
But the banquets were expensive, diffi
cult to plan and usually too large for stu
dents to connect with the community, Por
teus said. "We wanted to see what would
happen if we put the money that went into
the banquets back into the community.
"We're trying to cut back this year,
and we've had to leliminate the ban
quets] in the spirit of budget reduction,"
she added. "That's not the real reason for
doing it, but it entered into the decision."

However, Barbara Smith, acting direc
tor of the Black Community Services
Center, said the decision comes down to a
need to cut expenses. "We're not doing
banquets in an attempt to redirect funds
and offer a variety of programs," she said.
Porteus said the ethnic communities
also wanted to move the banquets,
because that would give them a chance to
"look inward" and analyze how to use
their smaller budgets most effectively.
According to Orientation Coordinator
James Wu, each ethnic committee is plan
ning a banquet later in the school year in
order to include upperclassmen. Another

advantage of postponing the banquets
would be a lightening of the always-full
Orientation calender, he added.
Porteus noted that the programs later
in the quarter would not necessarily be
banquets, but would serve as a communi
ty welcome to new students.
The banquets served a dual purpose:
to show students of different ethnic back
grounds cultural support, while at the
same time inviting students of different
cultures to join in the community's activ
ities, Porteus said.
Wu said that holding the banquets
during Orientation defeated these pur

poses because they became so large it was
difficult for the ethnic communities to
provide a personal welcome without the
assistance of upperclassmen. Any ban
quets held later in the year would still be
funded jointly by the Orientation com
mittee and the ethnic centers, he said.
Smith, who is also acting assistant
dean of student affairs, said the events
organized by the campus' ethnic commu
nities during Orientation are "an oppor
tunity for students of the various ethnic
backgrounds to know there are systems
in place and forums to allow them to
enrich their cultural heritage."
