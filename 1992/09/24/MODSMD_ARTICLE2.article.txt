# New indirect-cost rate pending
## University stands to lose at least $8 million a year 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Stanford and the federal gov
ernment are expected to reach
agreement on a new indirect-cost
rate very soon, but the University
will continue to be shortchanged
at least $8 million per year,
according to Chief Financial Offi
cer Peter Van Etten.
Indirect costs are the expenses
associated with research that can
not be attributed to any individu
al project, such as utilities and
libraries, and they represent more
than 20 percent of the operating
budget.
Negotiations for a cost-recov
ery rate for this fiscal year have
been continuing since last month,
and University officials said they
hope to agree on a final number
within a week.

Although neither the govern
ment nor the University would
comment on the actual negotia
tions, separate rules established in
the wake of the indirect-cost con
troversy suggest that the rate
would, in Stanford's best-case sce
nario, be no higher than 70 percent.
An indirect-cost rate of 70 per
cent means that for every $100 of
a grant, the University also
receives an additional $70 to
cover indirect costs.
"The negotiations will
undoubtedly result in a rate less
than actual costs" because of a cap
on the reimbursement of adminis
trative costs, Van Etten said.
In the wake of revelations of
indirect-cost overbilling at univer
sities nationwide and in particular
Stanford, Congress approved a
measure last summer limiting the
amount of government reimburse

ment for administrative expenses
to 26 percent of the cost of a grant.
The University's actual admin
istrative costs justify an indirect
cost rate of about 32 percent,
according to Van Etten.
The 26 percent cap costs Stan
ford about 6 percentage points, and
each percent equates to roughly
$1.3 million, he said. The overall
University loss from the new law
translates to $8-$9 million per year.
Indirect-cost reimbursement to
universities is handled through two
government agencies â€” the Official
of Naval Research and Health and
Human Services. Stanford falls
under the auspices of the Navy.
Even if Navy negotiators were
to agree to compensate the Uni
versity for all other expenses
related to indirect costs, Stanford
will still lose money by doing gov
ernment research.
But given the political climate
surrounding indirect costs, it
seems likely that a negotiated
indirect-cost rate would result in
additional deficits above and
beyond the administrative cap.
For 1991-92, University negotia
tors proposed a rate of 76 percent to
reflect actual costs. When the two
sides could not agree on a number,
the Office of Naval Research unilat
erally imposed a rate of 55.5 percent
on Stanford, costing the University
roughly $28 million per year.
Stanford's indirect cost rate in
1990-91 was 74 percent, but Paul
Biddle, the on-campus Navy regu
lator, began making noise that
the University's indirect-cost rate
was too high.
He convinced the House Sub
committee on Oversight and
Investigations to begin examining
the University's reimbursement
practices.

The Navy reduced Stanford's
rate twice before retroactively
imposing a rate of 55.5 percent in
April 1991 for that academic year.
Stanford has appealed that
mid-year rate reduction to the
Armed Services Board of Contract
Appeals, and the legal appeal is
"still ongoing and active," accord
ing to Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs.
Reports from the Defense Con
tract Audit Agency have also
alleged that the University over
charged the government $310 mil
lion during the 1980s, but those
allegations have never been proven.
Subsequent investigations and
hearings by the subcommittee
have revealed overbilling prob
lems at universities nationwide.
Meanwhile, the sharp reduc
tion in the cost recovery rate was
the biggest factor behind the Uni
versity's $43-million deficit.
Assuming that an agreement
on a new rate is reached, Stan
ford's financial problems will be
relieved to some extent, but new
regulations have made continuing
shortfalls from indirect costs
inevitable.
