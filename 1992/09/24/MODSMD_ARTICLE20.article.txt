# ASSU finds self without presidents
## 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Stanford's student govern
ment will undergo major
changes this year as it finds
itself without an executive body.
Last spring, students voted
not to have a Council of Presi
dents, electing the slate calling
itself "I Prefer Not to Have a
COP."
The slate of four candidates
pledged to abolish the COP —
the ASSU's executive body —
leaving the ASSU Senate as the
only elected contact between
students and the University
administration on such issues as
budget cuts and race relations.
The election of a COP whose
only promise was to abolish itself
fed on continuing discontent with

student government, coming only
two years after Bart Simpson was
elected to the senate.
Even without an elected
executive body, the ASSU is
expected to continue to func
tion.
ASSU internal affairs will be
handled by the ASSU Executive
Committee, led by senate chair
Ron Brown, and graduate sena
tor Derek Miyahara will chair a
newly formed University Rela
tions Committee to serve as a
liaison between the senate and
the administration.
Among the more important
functions of the executive com
mittee will be overseeing the
business projects that provide
valuable campus services,
including lecture notes, typeset
ting and Flicks.

These projects are self-sup
porting and do not rely on funds
from the ASSU fee that is
assessed to all students on their
University bills.
The fee, which is usually
about $35, goes to directly sup
port student groups such as
KZSU radio and the Stanford
Volunteer Network.
In the spring general elec
tion, students vote on the spe
cial fee requests of student
groups. A new ASSU fee is cal
culated after the election and
the University bills students
that amount.
Students who do not want to
give their money to specific
groups can request refunds at
the ASSU office by a specific
deadline several weeks into the
quarter.
