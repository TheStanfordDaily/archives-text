# Stanford accepts most diverse group of freshmen in history
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Representing all 50 states and
28 foreign countries, this year's
freshmen comprise the most eth
nically diverse class in Stanford
history.
Dean of Admissions James
Montoya said the "level of energy
and overall commitment to aca
demic excellence" sets apart the
1,600-student class of 1996.
This will be the first class
selected by Montoya, who assumed
his position after the class of 1995
had been selected.
For the first time in several
years, every state is represented
by at least one freshmen. Last
year's class lacked citizens of
West Virginia and Wyoming.
California is home to 40 percent
of the class, followed by Texas, New
York, Washington and Illinois.
Eighty-five international stu
dents come from countries includ
ing Russia, Singapore, Japan,
Bulgaria, South Africa, Pakistan,
Canada, Malaysia, Greece and
Germany.
"I was pleased because of the
fact we were able to achieve diver
sity while maintaining incredibly
high academic standards," Mon
toya said.
Forty-six percent of the fresh
men come from minority groups
this year, compared with last
year's 42.8 percent.
Montoya said he was "extreme
ly pleased" with the qualifications
of the 13,206 freshman applicants.
One admissions dean even
commented that "he was amazed
at the quality of students placed
on the waiting list," Montoya
added. Sixty students were admit
ted from the wait list this year.
While 4.4 percent fewer stu
dents applied to Stanford last
year, Montoya said the new class
still "faced incredible competi
tion." Approximately 22 percent
of the hopefuls were admitted.
The "yield rate" — or percent
age of accepted students who chose
to come to Stanford — dropped
this year, from 56 to 55 percent.
The freshman class is almost
evenly divided between men and
women, 70 percent of whom come

from public high schools. The size of
the class increased by 74 students.
In the area of academic achieve
ment, 22 percent scored better
than 700 on the verbal section of
the SATs and 58 percent scored
that well on the math section.
GPAs of 4.0 were earned by 42
percent of entering freshman.
Members of the class of 1996
were the first to receive Mon
toya's "very personal" acceptance
letter, he said. After meeting with
freshmen, he decided to print
"Congratulations" in big letters
on the outside of the packet.
The freshmen felt the new fea
ture "would have relieved a lot of
pressure," according to Montoya.
The 143 transfer students are
also a diverse group, coming to
Stanford from as far as Russia
and China. Minority students
make up 25 percent of the class.
Men outnumber women

among the transfers, making up
56 percent of the total. Twenty
five percent come from communi
ty colleges, and they represent a
total of 90 different schools.
Sixty-four percent of the trans
fers have a college GPA of at least
3.6, and half have a combined
SAT score of 1300 or above. Get
ting in as a transfer was tougher
than as a freshman, with only 15
percent of the 1,265 applicants
receiving acceptance letters.
Montoya said his appearance
in Big Game Gaieties last year —
his line, "My name is James Mon
toya, you killed my student, pre
pare to die," was adapted from
"The Princess Bride" — was his
main contact with students.
Now, he said, he looks forward
to getting to know his first class
by advising four freshmen in Uja
maa, sitting in on lectures and
visiting residences.

Representing all 50 states and
28 foreign countries, this year's
freshmen comprise the most eth
