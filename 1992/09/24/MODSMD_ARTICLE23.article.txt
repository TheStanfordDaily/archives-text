# Construction includes earthquake repairs, new buildings
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Campus construction is making
more room for a variety of things,
including athletics, public service and
even classes.
Buildings recently finished, current
ly in the works and still in the planning
stages will soon give students, stall and
faculty more room for a number of
activities.
The status of the following buildings
under construction comes from a report
prepared by Valerie Veronin, assistant
vice president for facilities management,
and was presented to the Board of
Trustees earlier this month.
Student Housing: Manzanita 11, an
upperclass student residence consisting
of two houses, was just completed and
opens for the first time this year. The
houses, named Lantana and Castano
will hold approximately 200 students.
Still in the design mode is the Knoll
Student Housing — two houses which
will hold a total of 180 beds. The project
is scheduled to be completed by Septem

ber 1994.
Haas Center for Public Service:
Currently under construction, the new
Haas Center will be a three-story build
ing located on Salvatierra Walk.
The added space will allow for good,
interactive working conditions "between
the students, stafT and groups concen
trating on different kinds of service," as
well as giving additional groups a "per
manent home," said Catherine Milton,
the former director of the center.
Earthquake Repairs: Only seniors
remember the inside of Memorial Church,
but in October all students will be able to
enter the newly reconstructed building.
Memorial Church was severely dam
aged during the October 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake.
In addition to the Church, reairs to
Building 60 will be completed in Decem
ber and Building 1 is expected to be fin
ished by March.
Green Library: The project to repair
Green Library's West Wing, also dam
aged during the Loma Prieta earthquake,
is still in the planning stages, but it is
expected to be completed by June 1995.

However, before the project can
begin, the Green Library West Surge
Facility must be completed.
Scheduled to be finished in Decem
ber, the area will hold many of the
materials from the Library while the
West Wing is being repaired.
Stanford Sports Center: Expect
ed to be completed in May, the Stanford
Sports Center will contain everything
from a weight training room and a reg
ulation basketball court to administra
tive offices.
Its completion will allow Encina
Gym and the Athletics Department
administration building to be emptied
and repaired.
Information Sciences A: Informa
tion Sciences A, a four-story building
still being planned, will house robotics,
a computer systems laboratory and sys
tems division, a theory division and
educational affairs.
The building will cost over $26 mil
lion, $6 million of which was provided
through a donation earlier this month by
William Gates, chairman and chief execu
tive officer of Microsoft Corporation.
