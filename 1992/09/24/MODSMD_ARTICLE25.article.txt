# Res Ed Orientation fraud discovered
## 
### 
Call me Oliver Stone, but
this wHole Orientation
thing reeks of some
ornate conspiracy between Res
Ed and the people at Stanley
Kaplan.

As I see it, every spring the
Kaplan folk drop off a little
payola in Res Ed Director Alice
Supton's office, and come fall
the official Orientation system
is in place to damage your self
esteem so badly that law school
seems the only viable option.
The insulting part is there's
no subtlety to it. F'or role mod
els they give you giddy sopho
mores who wear ugly T-shirts
and carry luggage for free.
Then, just when you're as vul
nerable and desperate as one of
those "Preemie" Cabbage
Patch Dolls waiting for adop

tion, they make you square
dance. Just thinking about it
makes me sicker than greasy
fried chicken left out in the hot
MuFuUnSun.
Even as a young, impres
sionable, and not-unattractive
freshman, I saw through this
scam as clearly as a nipple
through Jessica Hahn's blue
dress in those Loveline com
mercials.
But the painful irony — the
one that tortures not only my
soul, but my entire gastroin
testinal system to this very day
— is that despite my bat-like
perception I had no choice, but
to "follow the band."
After spending several
hours on the phone with Jean
Dixon to accurately predict the
number of holes which would
appear on my wall come year's
end, I "slipped a placemark" on
the Donner page and left my
room to figure out what all that
darn noise was, and why it so
resembled bad '70s hits. It was
there that I fell in love.
Everyone simply referred to
her as "Dollie," but I knew bet
ter. The way she slapped her
hands against her inner thighs,
the way she made her little
pony tail spin in delicate circles
