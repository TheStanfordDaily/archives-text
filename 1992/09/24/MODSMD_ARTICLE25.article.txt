# Res Ed Orientation fraud discovered
## 
### 
Call me Oliver Stone, but
this wHole Orientation
thing reeks of some
ornate conspiracy between Res
Ed and the people at Stanley
Kaplan.

As I see it, every spring the
Kaplan folk drop off a little
payola in Res Ed Director Alice
Supton's office, and come fall
the official Orientation system
is in place to damage your self
esteem so badly that law school
seems the only viable option.
The insulting part is there's
no subtlety to it. F'or role mod
els they give you giddy sopho
mores who wear ugly T-shirts
and carry luggage for free.
Then, just when you're as vul
nerable and desperate as one of
those "Preemie" Cabbage
Patch Dolls waiting for adop

tion, they make you square
dance. Just thinking about it
makes me sicker than greasy
fried chicken left out in the hot
MuFuUnSun.
Even as a young, impres
sionable, and not-unattractive
freshman, I saw through this
scam as clearly as a nipple
through Jessica Hahn's blue
dress in those Loveline com
mercials.
But the painful irony — the
one that tortures not only my
soul, but my entire gastroin
testinal system to this very day
— is that despite my bat-like
perception I had no choice, but
to "follow the band."
After spending several
hours on the phone with Jean
Dixon to accurately predict the
number of holes which would
appear on my wall come year's
end, I "slipped a placemark" on
the Donner page and left my
room to figure out what all that
darn noise was, and why it so
resembled bad '70s hits. It was
there that I fell in love.
Everyone simply referred to
her as "Dollie," but I knew bet
ter. The way she slapped her
hands against her inner thighs,
the way she made her little
pony tail spin in delicate circles


Joel Stein
around her head — and, more
than anything — the way she
embraced the task of imitating a
horse with three other identically
dressed women hinted at the kind
of intelligent women my new col
legiate career would bring.
But before I could even start
this long debate in my mind about
whether to find out her name so
that if I ever ran into her any
where I could, well, know her
name, someone blew a whistle
and my Joyceian vision flitted
away. And as she was leaving, this
Res-Ed-sent succubus pursed her
lips and exhaled, in barely percep
tible tones, the following words:
"It'll take at least six figures, cow
boy. So you'd better start think
ing LSATs. And thinking fast."
With Hoover Tower as my
Polaris, I headed back to my room,
unable to cry into my new, plastic
ensconced pillow, but excited
about the possibility of using it to
practice "safe" kissing skills.
There's only one safe way to
avoid the elaborate Kaplan/Supton
trap. First, keep accurate notes
about who's really getting off on

this Orientation thing. The females
among them wiJl go on to join a
sorority. They will invite you to go
to their formals. Start filling the
Saturday nights in your calendar
now. The males will be self-evident.
They will also ask to borrow a num
ber two pencil during the practice
tests. At that point it's too late.
More importantly, don't
square dance. Regardless how
attractive the partner, how
tempting the phrase "swing,"
don't enter the ring. Remember
what happened tb Brando.
Remember what happened to
those poor hicks Hugs Bunny sent
into the hay baler.
So why not go out and drown
your loneliness in a big refreshing
tub of EANAB. And if Alice Sup
ton asks why you didn't square
dance, look her in the eye and say
"logic games." Odds are, she
won't bother you anymore. And
that's a good thing.
Better depressed than
repressed.
