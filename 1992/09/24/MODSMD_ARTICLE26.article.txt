# Totally random or carefully picked?
## Roommate selection explained

Do they shuffle the deck and
pick two cards blindfolded? Or is
the task of assigning freshman
roommates a procedure that more
closely resembles rocket science?
Actually, the secret formula
for making freshman roommate
assignments is found somewhere
in the unsatisfying, vague middle
ground — in mid-August at the
Stanford Housing Center.
According to Bill Georges,
director of the Housing Center,
freshmen are first placed into
dorm groups. Then roommates
are paired based on "basic com
mon sense things" such as finding
a balance between students' simi
larities and differences. "It's not
like we're trying out experi
ments," he said.
But for those students whose
curiosities are not abated with this
answer, senior Kristine Ewing, one
of the two coordinators of the New
Undergraduate Student Informa
tion Project, offered a more precise
example of that top-secret room
mate assigning process.
"We just sit down and talk
back and forth," she said —
adding that two freshman can be

placed together based on such
random conversations as, "'I have
a sax player who loves Zen medi
tation. Do you think he'll work
well with someone who plays gui
tar and is on the rugby team?"'
And while one coordinator
might "feel very strongly" about a
particular match, the other might
pose an all-important make-or
break question to decide the fate
of the two roommates: "Oh, wait,
one's from Southern California
and the other's from Arizona,
should we do that?" (Translated,
this question means, "Is it too
close geographically to form a
viable pair?")
Project coordinators agonize
— possibly more than the fresh
men they hold in suspense all
summer — over questions as
seemingly trivial as this one. Fol
lowing the same never-to-be-bro
ken rules of thumb for the match
makers, two varsity athletes will
not be placed in the same room
together, and students in the
same CIV track will never be
roommates.
"Our general philosophy is to
try to pair students who have
some differences so they can learn
