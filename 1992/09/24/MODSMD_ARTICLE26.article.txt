# Totally random or carefully picked?
## Roommate selection explained 
### Grace Lee Editorial staff 
Do they shuffle the deck and
pick two cards blindfolded? Or is
the task of assigning freshman
roommates a procedure that more
closely resembles rocket science?
Actually, the secret formula
for making freshman roommate
assignments is found somewhere
in the unsatisfying, vague middle
ground — in mid-August at the
Stanford Housing Center.
According to Bill Georges,
director of the Housing Center,
freshmen are first placed into
dorm groups. Then roommates
are paired based on "basic com
mon sense things" such as finding
a balance between students' simi
larities and differences. "It's not
like we're trying out experi
ments," he said.
But for those students whose
curiosities are not abated with this
answer, senior Kristine Ewing, one
of the two coordinators of the New
Undergraduate Student Informa
tion Project, offered a more precise
example of that top-secret room
mate assigning process.
"We just sit down and talk
back and forth," she said —
adding that two freshman can be

placed together based on such
random conversations as, "'I have
a sax player who loves Zen medi
tation. Do you think he'll work
well with someone who plays gui
tar and is on the rugby team?"'
And while one coordinator
might "feel very strongly" about a
particular match, the other might
pose an all-important make-or
break question to decide the fate
of the two roommates: "Oh, wait,
one's from Southern California
and the other's from Arizona,
should we do that?" (Translated,
this question means, "Is it too
close geographically to form a
viable pair?")
Project coordinators agonize
— possibly more than the fresh
men they hold in suspense all
summer — over questions as
seemingly trivial as this one. Fol
lowing the same never-to-be-bro
ken rules of thumb for the match
makers, two varsity athletes will
not be placed in the same room
together, and students in the
same CIV track will never be
roommates.
"Our general philosophy is to
try to pair students who have
some differences so they can learn
from each other," said Georges.
At the same time, coordinators
ensure that "students have some
interests in common upon which
they can build a friendship."
But compatibility, rather than
best-friendship, is the goal of the
roommate assigning process,
Georges added.
The most common request
regarding room assignments,
Ewing said, is for a non-smoking
roommate. "Neat, but not anal
retentive" roommates are also in
high demand, Ewing said.
Even when the two coordina
tors have agreed that they
couldn't have composed a more
perfect pair, they still might have
to start over and reshuffle. For
example, if the last pair of room
mates seems hopelessly incom
patible or have the same CIV
track, Ewing said, "We'll go and
break up our favorite pair and
shuffle the pairs around again."
After they've spent painstak
ing hours trying to make the best
match, the coordinators will find
these breakups slightly disap
pointing. "We get really excited
about some of the pairs — and
then we have to break them up."
While the project coordinators
alternated between triumph over

a good match and chagrin over a
mediocre one, many students
expressed their curiosity over
unrevealed matches, resulting in
a steady stream of roommate
related phone calls to the Housing
Center throughout the summer.
Stanford's policy of withhold
ing all roommate information
from freshmen, however, is actu
ally not intended to promote this
state of perpetual anxiety among
freshmen-to-be. Its aim is to elim
inate any preconceptions students
may form about their roommates
— even though it means that stu
dents will not be able to confer
about who will bring the stereo
and telephone before they arrive.
"We really want people to
arrive on an equal footing with
their roommates," Ewing said.
What comprises a "great pair"
of roommates is "really subjec
tive," Ewing said. "You can only
get so much [information] from a
two-dimensional piece of paper
when you're dealing with three
dimensional people. In certain
ways, it's a stab in the dark."
However, "It's definitely easier
when people fill out more informa
tion," she added. "With people who
write more, we can at least feel like
we know them a little better.
"One student wrote (in the 'Any
thing else we should know about
you' section), 'No snorers, manic
depressives, or baseball fans. We
can accommodate that.'"
