# How did they know your name?
## Residence staff, Res Ed welcome frosh 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
Just who were those people in front of your
dorm who took your luggage and gave you all
those forms to fill out? And how did they know
your name?
They are your resident assistants (more
affectionately called RAs) and they assume a
myriad of different roles within the dorm. They
are role models, leaders, crisis counselors, and a
constant source of advice (especially during
those first clueless weeks). And they may also
become some of your best friends.
"We want residents to come out of their
rooms and get to know people," said Junior
Lorri Leard, a Larkin RA. "We want them to
feel at home."
RAs handle everything from the menial

tasks of unlocking the doors of those locked
out of their rooms to the more complicated
task of organizing dorm ski trips and guest

comfort and ease all the

speakers. RAs also supervise house govern
ment and spend countless hours hanging out
with residents in their rooms, in the hallways

and at mealtimes.
"Our overall role is to make this place a
home for the residents. We have roles as edu
cators, counselors, liaisons with the Universi
ty and a general resource as well," said second
year Branner RA Christine Giviskos.
Nancy Stone, a former Roble RA who now
works in the Residential Education office said
of life as an RA: "Where you live is where you
work. It gets to be very bizarre at times — it
becomes sort of like a lifestyle because you're
on call 24 hours a day."
But at Stanford, unlike many other univer
sities, RAs do not act as hall monitors or dorm
police officers. They allow residents to make
their own decisions about issues such as
drinking and overnight visitors.
"In terms of alcohol, we're not
going to tell residents not to drink,"
said (liviskos. "But if someone looks
like they're going to harm them
selves or get themselves into trou
ble, we're going to talk to them.
"Most people come to college to
try to be independent. We're just
trying to help them do that," she
added.
RAs arrived on campus two
weeks ago to prepare for Orienta
tion, attending various work
shops and meetings. And in their
spare time, they memorized your
name and face from that photo
you sent them over the summer.
RAs join student advising asso

ciates (AAs); residence computer
coordinators (RCCs) and theme
assistants (TAs) in ethnic theme
houses in comprising a dormito
ry's residence staff.
RCCs live in most houses and
oversee the computer clusters.
RCCs also lead computer training
workshops and are experts at
helping you out when your Mac
says it can't read the file with
your 10-page paper in it.
The residence staff reports to
the resident fellows (RFs), who are
faculty or staff members who live
in dorms. RFs oversee the house
and work with the RAs to coordi
nate dorm activities and program
ming.
"We try to act as community
builders, helping residents make a
connection between academic f.nd
residential learning," said Laririn

RF Sue Harvey. "That's what a
liberal education is all about."
Although KFs are not supposed
to be your surrogate parents, they
do check up on students' academic
progress and personal concerns.
They even get a copy of your grade
report every quarter.
"Being an RF gives you a bet
ter sense of student culture, and
it's definitely a culture," said Har
vey, who is a Freshman English
lecturer. "And the more you know
about students, the better you can
teach them."
The RAs and RFs are ail part of
Stanford's Residential Education
program which coordinates the
activities of 106 RAs and 41 RFs
and oversees the general tone of
dorm life.
"Res Ed is a system that aims
to build safe and secure communi

ties and residences. We want to
provide a place where students
can discover new ideas, grow
intellectually and personally,
experience things the curriculum
doesn't cover, and explore social
issues and relationships that
come with living together,"
explained Ann Porteus, an associ
ate director of Res Ed.
According to Forteus, one of
Res Ed's main goals is to help the
University move toward its com
mitment to becoming a multicul
tural, pluralistic community.
"We're not looking for comfort
and ease all the time. Sometimes
there's tension and stress, but
we try to provide an environment
where it can be explored and
lived with," says Porteus. "It's
an effort to find common
ground."

it's definitely a culture," said Har
vey, who is a Freshman English
lecturer. "And the more you know
about students, the better you can
teach them."
The RAs and RFs are ail part of
Stanford's Residential Education
program which coordinates the
activities of 106 RAs and 41 RFs
and oversees the general tone of
dorm life.
"Res Ed is a system that aims
to build safe and secure communi

ties and residences. We want to
provide a place where students
can discover new ideas, grow
intellectually and personally,
experience things the curriculum
doesn't cover, and explore social
issues and relationships that
come with living together,"
explained Ann Porteus, an associ
ate director of Res Ed.
According to Forteus, one of
Res Ed's main goals is to help the
University move toward its com
mitment to becoming a multicul
tural, pluralistic community.
"We're not looking for comfort
and ease all the time. Sometimes
there's tension and stress, but
we try to provide an environment
where it can be explored and
lived with," says Porteus. "It's
an effort to find common
ground."
