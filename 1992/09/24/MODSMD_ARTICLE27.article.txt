Just who were those people in front of your
dorm who took your luggage and gave you all
those forms to fill out? And how did they know
your name?
They are your resident assistants (more
affectionately called RAs) and they assume a
myriad of different roles within the dorm. They
are role models, leaders, crisis counselors, and a
constant source of advice (especially during
those first clueless weeks). And they may also
become some of your best friends.
"We want residents to come out of their
rooms and get to know people," said Junior
Lorri Leard, a Larkin RA. "We want them to
feel at home."
RAs handle everything from the menial

tasks of unlocking the doors of those locked
out of their rooms to the more complicated
task of organizing dorm ski trips and guest

comfort and ease all the

speakers. RAs also supervise house govern
ment and spend countless hours hanging out
with residents in their rooms, in the hallways

and at mealtimes.
"Our overall role is to make this place a
home for the residents. We have roles as edu
cators, counselors, liaisons with the Universi
ty and a general resource as well," said second
year Branner RA Christine Giviskos.
Nancy Stone, a former Roble RA who now
works in the Residential Education office said
of life as an RA: "Where you live is where you
work. It gets to be very bizarre at times — it
becomes sort of like a lifestyle because you're
on call 24 hours a day."
But at Stanford, unlike many other univer
sities, RAs do not act as hall monitors or dorm
police officers. They allow residents to make
their own decisions about issues such as
drinking and overnight visitors.
