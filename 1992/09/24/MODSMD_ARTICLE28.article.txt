# Survival advice for life on the Farm

### 
Where do I go to pay my Uni
versity bill?
To pay your bill, go to the Oak
West lounge on the second floor of
Tresidder. If you already have a
check written out for the proper
amount, the process is simple —
just look for the big box in which
to deposit your yellow envelope. If
you suspect an error in your bill,
need to get loan disbursements or
have to pick up scholarship
monies, there are several specific
counters to assist you. But if you
need to get questions answered,

come early. Otherwise the lines
get really, really long. And for
those who have no clue, there is
even a "No Clue" line to stand in.
I)o 1 need to take the Math
Placement Test?
If you do not have Advanced
Placement credit or college trans
fer credit and wish to take a math
class, you need to take the math
placement test. All math place
ment tests are taken using com
puters in the residential computer
clusters and are one hour long.

Students should plan to take this
test before they meet with their
academic advisers. Your score,
which you will get as soon as you
finish the test, will help you deter
mine which math class you should
enroll in.
Do I need to take the Chem
istry Placement Test?
All students (including those
with AP credit) must take the
chemistry placement test in order
to enroll in a chemistry class at
Stanford. Check your Orientation

calendar for times and locations
of the test.
Do I need to take a Foreign
Language Placement Test?
If you have studied a foreign
language and plan to take the
same language at Stanford, you
need to take the placement test.
The University requires all stu
dents to achieve competency in a
foreign language equal to a third
quarter, first-year course. If you
do not have AP language credit or
have not completed a third-year
high school language course, you
should plan to take this test. Even
if you have AP credit, you should
check with the proper language
department to find out if you are

required to take the language
test.
Where can I buy a season
football ticket?
Season tickets — including one
for Big Game — are available for
$34 in White Plaza from Sept. 24
to Sept. 30. Bring your Stanford
ID. You can also purchase tickets
at the Athletic Department on
Galvez Street.

Where can I go to register my
bicycle?
Go to the Tresidder Recreation
Center with your bicycle and
$3.50 to register. Know your
bike's serial number and make.
California law requires that all
bikes must be registered. Regis
tration makes it easier for police
to track down your bike if it is
stolen.

How can I avoid spending all
my money on books?
Buy used books. The Stanford
Bookstore sells used textbooks in
the same textbook area for slightly
less than the new ones. Store your
receipts from book purchases in
the brown Bookstore rebate enve
lope. Turn the envelope in during
April to receive a percentage rebate
on your purchases. Visa or Master

card book purchases do not count
toward your rebate.
The ASSU also sells used books
in front of the Bookstore during
the first few weeks of each quarter.
Buying books directly from other
students is another way to save
money; many students post fliers
in dorms and especially outside lec
ture halls to advertise their used
books.

Where can I register to vote
in California for local and
national elections?
A voter registration booth will
be set up in White Plaza today for
students who have never been
registered or are registered at a
different address. Various stu
dent political groups will also hold
voter registration drives when
school begins.
