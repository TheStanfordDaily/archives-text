# Fast-paced college life lures RFs back to campus
## Raising six kids and 210 students in Toyon proves rewarding, challenging 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Not even memories of psycho
logical crises, late-night medical
emergencies and the occasional
food fight could keep Jim and
Margaret Fox away from Toyon
Hall's resident fellow cottage.
The couple left Wilbur Hall in
1980 to recover from five years of
living with freshmen, but the lure
of dorm life convinced them to
return to campus two years ago.
"I felt like I was losing over the
years the feeling of being part of
Stanford," explained Jim Fox, an
associate anthropology professor.
He said the benefits — for exam
ple, he believes close contact with
students improves his teaching —
far outweigh the negatives.
Those can range from stu
dents' allergy attacks and appen
dicitis to helping residents cope
when a dormmate committed sui
cide last year.
The time commitment and
lack of privacy, along with prob
lems with vandalism, convinced
the Foxes to move off campus 12
years ago.
They also left behind "drunken
episodes in the middle of the
night," Jim Fox noted. Hut they

realized they missed close rela
tionships with students and the
financial benefits of being RFs.
Also, the youngest of their six
children hadn't lived on the Stan
ford campus. "It has been a very
good experience for our children,"
said Margaret Fox, an accountant
in the University controller's office.
The couple's three young
daughters — Rachel, 14, Suzie,
10, and 7-year-old Kristine — love
the attention, she said.
"Last year, [Toyon) had a play
that used all three of our
youngest children," Jim Fox
added. While the girls do get "too
used to late nights and student
party activities" from being
around residents, he said they
also find friends their own age
among other RF children.
John Fox, their 18-year-old son,
has fond memories of growing up
in Wilbur. Being invited to student
rooms was especially fun, he said.
"We would bomb people out
side with water balloons," said
the UC-Santa Cruz freshman.
The Foxes' oldest son is 22 and
a student at the University of Col
orado. One daughter, Sharman, is
a junior at Stanford.

Toyon Resident Fellows Jim and Margaret Fox can't stay away from the adventures of dorm life. This
year is likely to add another twist to their jobs — as their daughter Sharman, a Stanford junior, becomes
a Toyon resident.
