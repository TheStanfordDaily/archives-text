# Fast-paced college life lures RFs back to campus
## Raising six kids and 210 students in Toyon proves rewarding, challenging 
### Miranda Doyle Editorial staff 
Not even memories of psycho
logical crises, late-night medical
emergencies and the occasional
food fight could keep Jim and
Margaret Fox away from Toyon
Hall's resident fellow cottage.
The couple left Wilbur Hall in
1980 to recover from five years of
living with freshmen, but the lure
of dorm life convinced them to
return to campus two years ago.
"I felt like I was losing over the
years the feeling of being part of
Stanford," explained Jim Fox, an
associate anthropology professor.
He said the benefits — for exam
ple, he believes close contact with
students improves his teaching —
far outweigh the negatives.
Those can range from stu
dents' allergy attacks and appen
dicitis to helping residents cope
when a dormmate committed sui
cide last year.
The time commitment and
lack of privacy, along with prob
lems with vandalism, convinced
the Foxes to move off campus 12
years ago.
They also left behind "drunken
episodes in the middle of the
night," Jim Fox noted. Hut they

realized they missed close rela
tionships with students and the
financial benefits of being RFs.
Also, the youngest of their six
children hadn't lived on the Stan
ford campus. "It has been a very
good experience for our children,"
said Margaret Fox, an accountant
in the University controller's office.
The couple's three young
daughters — Rachel, 14, Suzie,
10, and 7-year-old Kristine — love
the attention, she said.
"Last year, [Toyon) had a play
that used all three of our
youngest children," Jim Fox
added. While the girls do get "too
used to late nights and student
party activities" from being
around residents, he said they
also find friends their own age
among other RF children.
John Fox, their 18-year-old son,
has fond memories of growing up
in Wilbur. Being invited to student
rooms was especially fun, he said.
"We would bomb people out
side with water balloons," said
the UC-Santa Cruz freshman.
The Foxes' oldest son is 22 and
a student at the University of Col
orado. One daughter, Sharman, is
a junior at Stanford.

Toyon Resident Fellows Jim and Margaret Fox can't stay away from the adventures of dorm life. This
year is likely to add another twist to their jobs — as their daughter Sharman, a Stanford junior, becomes
a Toyon resident.
Sharman "was sort of taken
aback" when she learned her par
ents planned to be RFs again,
according to Margaret Fox. "We've
been pretending she's a long way
away," she added. "We don't con
tact her, she contacts us."
This year, however, they will
become their daughter's RFs
when she takes advantage of the
Foxes' extra dorm room in Toyon.
The University provides RFs
with free room and board during the
year and use of the cottages in the
summer. Those perks make living
in the area affordable, Jim Fox said.

The couple said they spend an
average of 10 hours a week doing
everything from meeting with staff
to planning dorm programs. Dur
ing staff selection and training, the
time commitment can triple.
The RFs work with Resident
Assistants to put on dorm plays,
musicals, discussions and guest
speakers.
He also teaches dorm-based
classes open to all undergradu
ates. Last year's seminar was on
Mayan mythology, and this year
he said he will be exploring the
Battle of Little Big Horn.
While the Office of Residential
Education has drawn fire in recent
years — some accuse it of forcing
an inflexible multicultural agenda
on students — the Foxes say they

have been impressed by the
amount of freedom they are given.
"We agree with the basic phi
losophy of Res Ed . . . but we don't
try to push it really hard," Mar
garet Fox said.
Her husband agreed. "We like
ethnic diversity and diversity of
opinion to be a natural part of all
our events," he said, "rather than
lectures on multiculturalism."
He also praised Res Ed for
accepting different opinions from
staff members. The Foxes are both
"quite politically conservative," he
said. "I think I'm the world's only
Republican anthropologist."
Getting to know Toyon's 210
residents can be a tall order. The
couple said they often invite small
groups to their cottage for dinner

or to visit with a guest speaker.
They also had to learn to sup
port students without becoming
surrogate parents. "We don't have
a disciplinary role," Jim Fox said,
explaining that Residence Deans
are given that responsibility.
The Residence Deans are new
features in the Res Ed system
since the Foxes' first experiences
in the dorms. Another difference,
he said, is in student respect for
their living quarters.
Behavioral problems and "bla
tant vandalism" were a few rea
sons for leaving Wilbur, Fox said.
But they haven't had the same
difficulties with the current gen
eration of students.
"You don't hear of food fights
anymore." he said.
