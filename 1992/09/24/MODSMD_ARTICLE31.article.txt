# Students lend minds, muscles through public service center
## 
### Grace Lee Editorial staff 
Burying yourself under a
mountain of books is one way to
spend your days at Stanford. But
directing your energies outward,
channeling some of that hard
earned Stanford education back
into the local community, can be
an equally rewarding and perhaps
more enjoyable way to spend
time.
As thousands of students have
already found, public service oppor
tunities at Stanford are about as
endless as a dV reading list.
Stepping into the Haas Center
for Public Service, the Universi
ty's hub of service-related activi
ties, interested students can find
a myriad of service opportunities
waiting to be filled. The center is
located in Owen House, next to
the Campus Bike Shop.
Haas' Public and Community
Service Opportunities Clearing
house is devoted solely to helping
match students with the volunteer
work that best suits their inter
ests, abilities and time constraints.
Besides browsing through the
many binders stuffed full with
volunteer service openings, stu
dents can also search a computer

database — Odyssey — which
lists over 600 service opportuni
ties offered locally, nationally and
internationally.
Odyssey is easily accessible at
the Clearinghouse during its

dents have already

opportunities at Stan
ford are about as
endless as a CIV
reading list.'

office hours (weekdays, 11 a.m.-5
p.m.), or 24 hours a day through
any computer hooked to the Uni
versity network, including those
in dorm computer clusters and
campus libraries.
In addition, a public service
column listing volunteer positions
appears every Monday in The
Daily.
The annual Volunteer Oppor
tunities Fair will be held Oct. 6,
from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. in White
Plaza, with about 80 community

organizations expected on cam
pus. Haas will also host an open
house Oct. 8.
And if you feel swamped by all
of the information you find, there
are five Clearinghouse peer coun
selors (CPAs) to answer your
questions and help you sort out
your options. Each counselor has
an area of specialty, such as
women's issues or youth in educa
tion.
Haas also provides funding and
fellowships to students who wish
to pursue public service projects.
Students who wish to combine
study and service can obtain
information through the Haas
Center about Stanford in Wash
ington, a program for juniors and
seniors which integrates classes
with internships in government
and policy-making organizations.
Other service groups operate
out of the various campus ethnic
organizations.
For example, following the Los
Angeles riots, many students
joined members of Stanford's
black community In launching
and revitalizing efforts to reach
out to the nearby impoverished
community of East Palo Alto.
While many organizations ask
for a steady time commitment

from their volunteers, other
opportunities are also available
for students who cannot volun
teer on a regular basis.
A program known as Alterna
tive Spring Break Projects allows
students to immerse themselves
for a week in service experiences

that deal with issues ranging from
homelessness to environmental
protection.
Service events such as the cam
pus-wide Reach Out Today, which
is currently scheduled for Hal
loween, also spur student volun
teer efforts among those who do

bury themselves in their books.
Through this program, students
can participate in community ser
vice for one day (often through
dorm-sponsored activities), with
out making a long-term commit
ment, returning to their studies
when the day is done.
