# Don't hit the snooze — Stanford's not-to-be missed classes
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Many freshmen start merrily on the
"major path" — taking the basic courses
required for a major. Others begin by try
ing to fulfill all the distribution require
ments necessary to graduate.
But by limiting themselves to "practi
cal" or "sensible" courses, students often
lock themselves into a major — or even a
job — that doesn't really interest them.
So, the best advice is to experiment.
Try something a little different with your
course load.
While a look at Courses and Degrees
can throw any carefree Stanford student
into a cloud of confusion, academic advis
ers, advising associates, resident assis
tants and upperclassmen are all foun

tains of information about which classes
are good, bad and unmentionable.
Here are just a few of the classes past
freshmen (and upperclassmen) have cho
sen as the picks of the lot:
American Studies 179: Introduc
tion to American Law. A large lecture
that seems much smaller because of the
efforts of Prof. Lawrence Friedman, this
class is a fun change in reading assign
ments. Instead of textbooks, students
read case law and participate in discus
sions about history-making court cases.
Offered fall quarter this year, last year's
class was so popular that many students
took the midterm sprawled on the floor of
the hallway outside the classroom.
Art 70: Photography I. Photo I is a
time-consuming but enjoyable class that
causes many students to live with their

cameras for the quarter. Roommates and
friends of photo students should beware
of winding up in the students' portfolios,
especially since the class is open to any
one with a 35mm camera.
Civil Engineering 170: Environ
mental Science and Technology. One
of the few 8 a.m. classes that students
actually get up for, CE 170 is taught only
in the fall. Prof. Gil Masters' three early
morning lectures present a small barrier,
but the class still overflows every fall —
especially during exams. Although not
the easiest class, it does fulfill distribu
tion requirement six while focusing stu
dents' attention on the plight of the envi
ronment.
Communications 1: Mass Commu
nications and Society. With a good lec
turer and usually no exams, Mass Com

munications is a great course to take fall
quarter. A five unit class with both large
lectures and small sections, it fulfills a
distribution requirement and is a prereq
uisite for most communications courses.
Computer Science 1: Using Com
puters. CS 1 is a one-unit class almost
mandatory for anyone who doesn't
understand the Macintosh. Take it fall
quarter, in a friendly, local computer
cluster to learn the tools necessary to
write papers, send electronic mail and
more.
English 90: Fiction Writing. Sleep
ing bags are required equipment for this
class. Due to the popularity of this class,
students sleep out the night before sign
ups to ensure themselves a space. Taught
every quarter in small sections where
students critique each other's work, Fic

tion Writing is a class not to be missed.
Human Biology 10: Human Sexu
ality. Many parents wouldn't approve of
this class, but students sure do. Students
earn three units for spending the winter
listening to a coherent and even enter
taining professor talking about human
sexuality. It's a rough job, but hey, some
body's got to do it, right?
Human Biology 11: Sleep and
Dreams. Sleeping in class is not allowed,
despite the topic of the class. The profes
sor would even say that sleeping in class
indicates a sleep disorder, since one of the
goals of the class is to teach students to
improve their own sleeping habits. While
sometimes a bit technical, Sleep and
Dreams offers fun gatherings and movies
outside of class in addition to the tradi
tional lectures.
