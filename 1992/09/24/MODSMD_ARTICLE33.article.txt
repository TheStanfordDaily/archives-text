For those of you who forgot to bring your
piggy bank, one of the first things you'll want
to do is to open a bank account.
The Palo Alto area has several banks to
which students can entrust their precious
money. Three institutions — the Stanford
Federal Credit Union, Wells Fargo Bank and
Bank of America — offer services that are
especially convenient for Stanford students.
The Stanford Federal Credit Union, co
owned by 26,000 students, faculty, staff and
alumni, offers a great deal on a checking
account. The account earns interest and has
no monthly fee if a $500 minimum balance is
maintained (they charge $4 per month during
the school year if you drop below the mini
mum). The plan offers unlimited check-writ
ing and no per-check charges.
The credit union's offices are located on
Pampas Lane, but it also has a 24-hour ATM
at Tresidder Union. For a nominal fee, their
ATM card can be used at more than 70,000
locations nationwide.
The credit union also offers a student Visa
card with no annual fee for the first year, a
$1000 credit line and a 15 percent interest
rate.
To join, the credit union charges a $5 mem
bership fee.
Wells Fargo Bank offers three checking
plans for students. The "ATM Checking" pro
gram limits customers to transactions only
through the automated teller machines. Sum
mers are free, and during the school year the
monthly fee is $4,50. "Stagecoach Checking"
charges no monthly fee if a $750 minimum
balance is kept in the account. And you can
earn interest on your account if you keep a bal
ance of at least $1500.
Wells Fargo also offers a student Visa card
with no charges for the first year. The bank
has a branch office and several ATM machines

school year and no charges during the summer
