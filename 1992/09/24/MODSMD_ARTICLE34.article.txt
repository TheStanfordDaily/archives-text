# Coping with culture shock
## Ethnic centers provide resources, programs for frosh 
### Victor Haseman Editorial staff 
For many incoming students of color, nothing
short of dashing home to family and community can
completely numb the jolting effects of campus cul
ture shock. But Stanford's four ethnic centers can
offer some relief.
These student-staffed and University-funded
centers coordinate events and programs throughout
the year that showcase the rich cultural heritage of
the campus' four largest communities of color
(Asian-American, Black/African-American, Chi
cano/Latino and Native American), in addition to
serving the needs of the communities.
Asian American Activities Center
The Lunar New Year Celebration, Day of
Remembrance and Stanford Luau represent only a
few of the events sponsored annually by the AC
(pronounced "A cubed C"). Considered the "hub" of
the Stanford Asian-American community since
1978, the center — located in the Old Union Club
House — also serves as the home of over 35 Asian
student organizations.
Center Director Richard Yuen has headed the
center's staff since 1989, when the Dean of Stu
dent's Office developed the position in response to
the needs and demands of the campus' flourishing
Asian-American community. Yuen, who is also
assistant dean of students , is assisted by a full
time program coordinator and several student
interns.
Besides offering a library of books, videos and
Asian periodicals, the center provides organization
al advice, opportunities for community service, cul
tural and educational programming. The center
links the Asian community to the rest of campus.

Black Community Services Center
The BCSC, affectionately called the "Black
House," caters to the needs of the African-American
community on campus. It is located between Bow
man Alumni House and Harmony House.
Acting Director Barbara Smith and the BCSC
student staff are responsible for overseeing the cen
ter's activities such as advising and coordinating
services for all Black Voluntary Student Organiza
tions (BSVOs) and offering leadership and service
opportunities to interested students.
The "Grapevine," a monthly newsletter pub
lished by the center, keeps students aware of
upcoming events within the black community as
well as on the rest of campus. The center also holds
leadership workshops during winter and spring
quarters.
The BCSC sponsors many cultural and educa
tional programs in the Black community including
the annual Martin Luther King Jr. program, Black
Liberation Month programs, Club Ujamaa, Malcolm
X Week, the Soul Food Dinner and a host of others.
El Centro Chicano
Established in 1978, "El Centro Chicano de
Estanford" seeks to serve Stanford's Chicano/Lati
no community by fostering an environment that cel
ebrates and promotes the history, contributions and
empowerment of Chicanos and Latinos.
The center, under the direction of Assistant Dean
of Students Frances Morales and her student staff,
helps coordinate cultural programs, student activi
ties, and community service.
Art exhibitions, speaking engagements, work
shops and film viewings are just a few of the many
forums the center employs to explore and celebrate
Latino and Chicano culture. Throughout the year,
El Centro sponsors such events as La Gran Posada,

Zoot Suit Week, Cinco De Mayo and Chicano Grad
uation.
Over 20 Chicano and Latino student groups uti
lize El Centro space and advising services. Individu
al members of the community can also participate in
the center's various leadership and training oppor
tunities.
El Centro provides support for many public ser
vice programs including Bario Assistance and Pro
ject Motivation, and sponsors the publication of
"Noticias," a community newsletter.
El Centro Chicano is located in the basement of
the Nitery in Old Union.
Native American Cultural Center
The NACC, located in the basement of the Old
Union Clubhouse, has been the center of Stanford's
Native American community since its organization
in 1974. With Assistant Dean of Students James
Larimore as director, the center functions as a
resource center, meeting place and headquarters for
over 15 groups including the Stanford Native Amer
ican Arts and Crafts Organization, Native American
Issues League and the Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO).
The SAIO — a social and political organization
for the Native American community — along with
the NACC staff and volunteers, plans and present
many cultural events during the year including
Native American Orientation, community potluck
dinners, an annual engineering job fair and the
Stanford Powwow.
The Stanford Powwow is the community's
largest annual event, attracting more than 20,000
attendees each year. Other events sponsored by the
NACC and SAIO include an annual leadership
retreat held each spring and a graduation awards
dinner.
