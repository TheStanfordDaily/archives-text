Out of the closet, and into — the Fire
Truck House?
Located on the second floor of this cam
pus landmark is the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center, which
serves as the bustling center of activity for
many of Stanford's gay, lesbian and bisex
ual students, faculty members and staff.
The LGBCC offers many resources,
such as a library and archives, for anyone
interested in learning more about gay
issues. It also serves as home base to
many organizations that promote the
interests of gays, lesbians and bisexuals
on campus.
The center sponsors many activities
such as films, discussion groups, guest
speakers and social events throughout the
year.
Last year, the campus group Queerland
organized "Queer Carnival," a festive and

informative event — attended by several
hundred students and other members of
the Stanford community — intended to
promote a positive image of gays.
Students can enter the LGBCC
through an outdoor staircase or a less vis
ible indoor staircase.
While some students are "out" to
everyone and casually sport Queerland T
shirts, others are more reticent about
"coming out." For those who wish to talk
about issues of sexual orientation in a
comfortable atmosphere, the center spon
sors several discussion groups.
To kick off the year, the LGBCC will
host an Orientation Celebration for stu
dents, faculty and staff Oct. 8, from 6 to
10 p.m. at the Oak West Room in Tresid

A 24-hour recorded message line spon
