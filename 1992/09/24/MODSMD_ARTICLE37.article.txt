# Physical, academic access for disabled
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Editorial staff 
It's often hard for freshmen to
adjust to the college environment.
Finding classes, making new
friends and keeping up in CIV can
be a challenge. But disabled stu
dents face an entirely different set
of challenges, along with the tradi
tional freshman blues.
That's why Stanford has the Dis
ability Resource Center, a service
and community center advocating
the needs of disabled and temporar
ily disabled students.
According to Program Director
John Asheim, the purpose of the
DIIC is "to provide both physical
and academic access to the Univer
sity to students who have ... all
kinds of disabilities."
The center, located on the first
floor of Meyer Library, serves
approximately 150 self-declared
disabled students, along with tem
porarily disabled students, Asheim
said. Its programs range from aca
demic services to career placement
to support groups.
Academic services
The primary type of services
offered by the DRC is academic sup
port services, Asheim said.
Reader services are available to
blind and learning disabled stu
dents, along with a collection of
books on tape. Notetakers and
interpreters may be helpful to stu
dents in large classes.
Stenocaptioning, which tran
scribes lectures verbatim to a lap
top computer, is also available to
deaf students.
Study and exam assistants
including scribes, typists, tutors
and transcribers are employed bv
the DRC.
Access
Asheim said Stanford is "pretty
accessible compared to schools like
Harvard, because of the terrain. We
do have some students who have
chosen to come to Stanford over
eastern schools, because we're so
far ahead in terms of attitude,
awareness, community and access."
According to housing officials,
almost all existing structures now
provide limited or first floor access
to disabled persons. The University
Housing Center's 10-vear "Capital

Improvements Flan" includes pro
visions for increasing access for dis
abled students.
The Americans with Disabilities
Act, which went into effect July 27,
will force University officials to
make new housing completely
wheelchair accessible, but will not
require Stanford to make changes
to any existing structures.
Disabled students scheduled to
take classes or exams in rooms that
are not wheelchair-accessible can
have them rescheduled to accessible
rooms. However, it may be difficult
for disabled students to attend
office hours or social functions in
non-accessible buildings. History
and Math Corners are the only
areas of the Quad fully accessible to
disabled students, according to
Asheim.
Although many residences are
already wheelchair-accessible,
structural modifications can be
made to residences to accommodate
disabled students. Disabled stu
dents are given priority for on-cam
pus housing. And while the Univer
sity normally requires that only
registered Stanford students reside
in campus housing, this require
ment can be waived for live-in assis
tants of disabled students.
A wheelchair access map of the
Stanford campus is available from
the DRC.
Transportation
Although Stanford's Marguerite
shuttle is not equipped to carry
wheelchairs, the Marguerite Para
transit Service is wheelchair-accessi
ble and offers dispatched, wheelchair
accessible van service from 6:30 a.m.
to 5 p.m. on weekdays.
The student operated DisGO
CART Service provides free trans
portation to students with tempo
rary and long-term disabilities, 8:30
a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays. Golf carts
are also available for rentals of one
week or more from Cowell Student
Health Center.
After dark, the SURE Escort
Service provides carts and walking
escorts. A map of disabled parking
spaces on campus is available
through the DRC.
"Access Stanford," a 90-page
guide to services and support
groups for the disabled community
at Stanford, was released by the
DRC in Mav.
