# Dating at Stanford — dis-festival 101
## 
### Jeff Brock Editorial staff 
Yes, people do date at Stanford.
In their dreams.
Why does this rumor persist? Because Ori
entation issues of The Daily always run a
story about it? No, the rumor persists because
it is true.
One old joke asserts that nine out of every
10 women in California are beautiful and the
other goes to Stanford. Another equally old
joke says that nine out of every 10 California
men are obnoxious, and they all go to Stan
ford. With this kind of animosity going
around, it's no wonder there's no dating.
Oh, sure, some upperclassperson will try to
convince you they've gone out on dates here.
And, the poor souls, they actually think they
have gone out on dates.
But going to Flicks with someone is not a
date. Going bowling with the dorm and shar
ing bowling balls with the most attractive per
son in the dorm is not a date. Asking someone
to a wild night of studying in Meyer or Green
is not a date.
Jogging together is not a date. Sharing the
same grimy joystick of the "Teenage Mutant
Super Mario Bros." game at the Tresidder
game room is not a date, unless you both wear
pocket protectors. Going to The City for a wild
night on the town is a date, but the percentage
of students who actually leave this little bub
ble to go off-campus is negligible.
Why is there such a dearth of romance? It's
called homework. Extracurriculars. Staying in
shape. On the surface, we have to look calm
and collected, but underneath the water our
legs are flailing like mad. We feel guilty if
we're not doing something "productive."
However, even though most students here
are dateless, there are a few who have to take
up the slack. One of these individuals will
undoubtedly be your roommate.

The folks at Res Ed, who relish their power
to assign roomies and ruin lives, will probably
pair you up with Mr. or Ms. Studmuffin
Deluxe so the two of you can "learn how to
find common ground."
Sure, a lot of people will come by and visit
your room, but it won't be to see you. Then
there are the phone calls. You pick up the
phone. The voice says, "Oh hi." (Long, awk
ward pause.) "Is your roommate there?"
If you begin to bemoan your sorry state,
don't fret. My first quarter at Stanford was a
dis-festival.

Oh, well, at least the "other
man" for whom I was dumped
was a sixty-year-old Mexican
political figure and not my
roommate.

During the first few weeks of the quarter, I
began to realize that a blond dormmate of
mine — who had the enviable distinction of
being the only frosh from North Dakota —
was a goddess. As we grew a little closer, I
eagerly overstepped my boundaries and
walked out on a limb: I asked her if she want
ed to get something at the Coffee House.
Answer: "No, I've got a lot of work to do
tonight."
This is only the second week of the quarter,
I thought. So I interpreted this as a dis. Later,
however, I realized that intense studying was
her thing. She studied all the time, it seemed.
So maybe it wasn't really a dis? Oh, get
real. It was.
Strike One.
Later, when the dorm purchased San Fran
cisco Symphony tickets, I decided that a pleas
ant trip to The City — elegant dinner, public

transportation and all — with another dorm
mate would be just peachy. She was not easily
convinced of the good karma of such an idea,
though, and I found myself groveling for a date.
Eventually she agreed — reluctantly — and
I made plans.
And then I got dissed.
Cuatehemoc Cardenas, a Mexican opposi
tion leader, was coming to campus the same
night as the concert. As soon as I heard that
news, I knew it'd only be a matter of time
before I heard that knock on my door.
"Jeff, did you know that Cardenas is going
to be here the night of the concert?"
Oh, well, at least the "other man" for whom
I was dumped was a sixty-year-old Mexican
political figure and not my roommate.
Strike Two.
A week or two later I rode with a bunch of
friends to Los Angeles to see the Stanford-
USC football game. Another dormmate —
let's call her "Zelda" — and I shared the driv
ing, and part of the time the group stayed at
her house.
I was enjoying myself immensely, and actu
ally got the impression that this might be
something undissable. There was a spark, or
at least some static electricity.
After we returned to Stanford, she asked
me what I was doing for Thanksgiving. "Noth
ing," I replied eagerly. "Well," she said, "How
would you like to spend it with me and my
family in L.A.?"
Fireworks shot off in my head. Zelda and I,
alone, traveling to L.A. together, seeing the
sights (or whatever it is you do in L.A.). Dur
ing the next week I picked out china patterns
and names for our future children.
Then she dropped the dis-bomb.
"Jeff, I don't think you're going to be able to
go with me for Thanksgiving. I'd already asked
four other people and now the car is full."
Strike Three.
Dude, yer out.

Not everyone is this lucky. Dating at Stanford is a rare find.
