# Don't become a victim: Sensible advice to protect yourself from campus crime
## 
### Kimberly Chrisman Editorial staff 
Along with the traditional crop of
unsuspecting freshmen, fall quarter usu
ally brings an influx of crime to the Stan
ford campus. But with a few minor pre
cautions and a lot of common sense, new
students can avoid becoming just another
statistic.
According to Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of
the Stanford Police, most campus crimes
are committed by intruders from off
campus.
"We have an open campus, so anyone
can drift in and out of here," he said.
"Students shouldn't be afraid to confront

suspicious people. If the person doesn't
seem legitimate, they should call 911."
The most common campus crimes are
theft and burglary of dormitories and
vehicles, according to Niemeyer.
"It continues to be a problem, although
students have been getting better about
reporting suspicious characters and our
apprehensions have gone up," he said.
Most burglars enter residences
through unlocked doors, typically during
the lunch and dinner hours, he added.
"People need to lock their rooms when
they leave them, or even when they're in
there studying or sleeping."
Vehicles should also be kept locked.
Niemeyer suggested a "really good alarm

system" as the best deterrent to vehicle
theft, adding that "you probably
wouldn't want to leave any valuables
such as skis or tennis rackets in your car.

"We patrol the parking lots as much as
we can, but we can't be everywhere," he
said. "Nowhere is safe."
Bicycle theft is also common, with

thieves carting off stolen bikes by the
truckload, according to Niemeyer.
"Typically, these next two months are
going to be murder, because freshmen
bring their fancy new bikes and don't
lock them to anything, and thieves know
that," he said.
Niemeyer recommended that bikers
invest in "a really good quality U-lock"
and always lock their bikes to a station
ary object.
"The new U-locks are particularly
effective, especially if they have (security
enhancing devices) called Bad Bones,
which are very difficult to break. That's
the only kind of lock I would have."
Although assaults have decreased in

recent years, Niemeyer advised joggers
and pedestrians to travel in groups, espe
cially at night, and to "stay away from
dark, bushy areas."
The student-operated SURE escort
service (72f)-SURE) offers free bicycle,
golf cart and pedestrian escorts from 7
p.m. to 1 a.m. nightly.
A map of suggested routes for night
time pedestrian and bicycle travel is
available from the Department of Public
Safety.
Last spring, the University installed
eight new public phones at various loca
tions around campus in an effort to
increase campus safety. The phones hive
free 911 service to the police.
