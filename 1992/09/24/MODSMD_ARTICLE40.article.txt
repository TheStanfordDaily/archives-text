# Campus traditions: full moon to fully nude
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
When you make a new group of friends, it's
not until you've established all the little ritu
als — the secret handshake, the inside joke,
the mock insults — that you feel like you
belong.
So consider Stanford your really, really big
group of new friends. It's not until you've
kissed anonymous upperclassmen in the
Quad, arranged blind dates for dances, chant
ed "the Axe" cheer, had a paper fight with sev
eral hundred people, danced on a grave,
screamed at midnight and attended a party
wearing pantyhose — and nothing else — that
you really become a part of Stanford.
Sound like a fraternity hazing ritual? Don't
worry. Within a year, as you take part in each
of these Stanford traditions, they will all
become normal — maybe even routine —
aspects of your life here.
For Full Moon on the Quad, hundreds of
naive young freshmen — and desperate sopho
mores — gather in the Quad to become real
Stanford women or men by kissing a Stanford
senior in the Quad on the designated autumn
night.
Soon, though, the excitement over mashing
lips with some unknown person who had

nothing better to do gives in to giddy anxiety
over whether your roommate is going to be
able to set you up with that cute guy in your
freshman English class in time for your
dorm's Screw-Your-Roommate dance.
Meanwhile, you spend your Fridays making
colorful, imaginative and insulting signs to dis
play at Saturday football games — unless, of
course, you decide to camp out at the stadium
the night before to save your dorm a place in line.
At the game, you'll learn the art of syn
chronized leaping as you listen carefully for
the right moment to jump in unison with the
crowd as The Leland Stanford Junior (pause)
University Marching Band plays "All Right
Now," the University's unofficial anthem.
By the time Big Game rolls around (our
yearly humiliation of that inferior educational
institution across the Bay, otherwise known
as "Cal"), you'll have perfected the leap, along
with other skills such as face painting and
screaming the famous Axe cheer.
The cheer — which consists mainly of the
phrases "Give 'em the Axe," "Where?" and
"Right in the neck" repeated over and over again
— is supposed to bolster our team's determina
tion to win the Axe, an actual lumberman's axe
that a Stanford yell leader used in 1899 to chop
down an efTigy of Cal's golden bear.
Despite the sunburn (or frostbite, depend

ing on the day) and the sore throat you're sure
to get from the game, you'll still have energy
to go to the biggest paper fight of your life the
following night, at Sunday Flicks in Mem Aud.
Come and learn to cheer or boo at movie cred
its for no particular reason.
Another Stanford tradition is the annual
Halloween party at the Mausoleum. After
searching the local Salvation Army for a cos
tume fitting the somewhat-macabre and defi
nitely-bizarre quality of the party, you'll be
dancing over the resting place of dear old
Leland and Jane Stanford, the respected
founders of our luminous university.
But frightening howls in the night aren't
just limited to Oct. 31. When Dead Week hits —
that awful period before finals when you realize
you've only read two of your CIV books — stu
dents' screams of anguish are heard simultane
ously at midnight all over campus.
For screams of amazement and laughter,
there's nothing quite like the Exotic Erotic,
held in April and well attended by all of us
closet exhibitionists and voyeurs. The more
outrageous your costume — and the less you
wear — the better your chances of getting into
the party.
So, remember — whether it's this weekend
or next spring — just act wild and a little crazy
and you'll fit right in as a Stanford student.
