# Fitness on the Farm — where to work out
## 
### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
New students typically find that with CIV and
freshman English — not to mention financial aid
applications and course schedules — Stanford
offers plenty of mental exercise.
But to maintain your health and your sanity,
your body needs a workout too. So if you want to
escape from the mountain of forms accumulating
on your desk (or simply want to get away from your
next door neighbor's ranting about Chinese philoso
phers), take time to explore some of the physical
exercise opportunities on campus.
A good pair of running shoes is all that's required
for a quick jog or walk around campus, to Palo Alto
or up in the Foothills behind campus. The Campus
Drive loop is approximately four miles and is a good
way to familiarize yourself with Stanford's layout.
I he "faculty ghetto" in the streets branching off
May field Avenue offers quiet streets and pleasant
residential views.
Beyond the ghetto to the south lie the Foothills,
a favorite spot for runners and walkers alike. You
may enter the fenced area at three points along
Junipero Serra Boulevard: near the intersection of
Campus Drive East, at the intersection of Stanford
Avenue or up a driveway near the intersection of
Frenchman's Street.
The main, circular path is slightly more than
three miles — approximately five kilometers — but
there are plenty of other dirt paths if you wish to
increase or decrease your trip length. "The Dish"
(Stanford's large satellite dish) and the solar obser
vatory are located in the area, and the hills are
home to a variety of wildlife, including jackrabbits,
squirrels, moles, snakes, skunks, foxes and birds.
Stanford's golf course — located at the intersec
tion of Campus Drive West and Junipero Serra — is
another respite from the hustle and bustle of cam
pus. Mondays (when the course is closed) are par
ticularly enjoyable, since you don't have to worry
about dodging golf balls, golf carts and golfers that
have gone astray. But watch out for the sprinklers.
Lagunita, approximately nine-tenths of a mile
in circumference, is another good place for a stroll —
particularly in the spring when the lake is full.
If biking is more your speed, take a ride around
Palo Alto for starters. For ideas on longer rides, a
guide to local bike paths is available at the Book
store, or contact the Stanford Cycling Club. Don't
forget your helmet!

Rollerblading is becoming increasingly popular
on campus. For smooth cruising, try the pavement
in front of the Physics Tank on the west side of the
Quad, or try the Quad's sandstone walkways (but
beware of pedestrians).
In-line skates can be rented for about $10 a day at
a number of local stores such as Palo Alto Sport Shop
and Toy World. Helmets, knee guards and wrist
guards are also available for a little extra. Be warned
that skateboarding is frowned upon bv campus police.
If you prefer indoor exercise, Stanford offers sev
eral facilities to non-varsity athletes. Free weights,
weight machines and exercise bicycles are available
at Encina and Roble Gyms. Stairmasters and Life
cycles are located in the Ford Center.
Racquetball courts and outdoor swimming facili

ties are located in the deGuerre complex between
the Tennis Stadium and Sunken Diamond near the
stadium on the north side of campus. Tennis courts
are located at the corner of Arguello Way and Serra
Streets, in Escondido Village and across from the
golf driving range near Governor's Corner.
Intramural and club sports, in addition to regu
lar Athletic Department activities, are a way to
build physical fitness into your busy Stanford life.
Course offerings change quarterly, and sign-ups are
held on the day before classes begin every quarter.
If you've never seriously exercised before, or
would like to develop a structured exercise program,
contact a physician at Cowell Student Health Cen
ter for advice. Cowell's nutritionist is also available
by appointment.
