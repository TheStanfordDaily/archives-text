# What to do when your wallet gets empty: How to get a part-time job
## 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
After buying football season tickets,
lots of overpriced Stanford apparel,
enough posters to wallpaper your hall
way and two baskets full of fall quarter
CIV books at the Bookstore, many
freshmen discover that both their wal
lets and newly-opened checking
accounts are drained after just a couple
of weeks on the Farm.
And that check mom and dad gave
you as you left home was supposed to
last the whole quarter. . . .
Time to get a job.
Whether you need to find part-time
work to satisfy a financial aid obligation
or just want to make some extra spend
ing money to carry you through the
quarter, Stanford offers several
resources for students seeking employ
ment.
The Financial Aids Office provides a
job listing service for students on finan
cial aid who are eligible to participate in
work-study programs.
The office publishes job listings in a
student employment folder called
Odyssey in Folio, the University's com
puter network. Folio can be accessed

from Old Union, the libraries, the
Career Planning and Placement Center
and all dorm computer clusters.
Most jobs listed in Folio are located
on campus and include work in
libraries, academic departments, labs
and university administrative offices.
The minimum hourly wage of Folio
listed jobs is $7.16.
"The listing is one great resource,"
says Kathy Campbell, a coordinator of
student employment services at the
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter. "All the departments that need stu
dent employees first advertise through
Financial Aids. It's a huge listing of
opportunities."
Approximately one-third of the jobs
in Odyssey are limited to federal work
study students, the neediest segment of
students eligible for work-study. To
prevent students who are not eligible
for work-study from applying for these
jobs, the listing service does not tell the
user the location of the job.
To get more information about
prospective jobs, students must write
down the job number at the end of the
listing and visit the Financial Aids
Office where they can receive addition
al information.

The Financial Aids OfTice is located
in Old Union, room 321. During regis
tration on Sept. 24 and 25, the office
will answer questions on the second
floor of Tresidder Union.
Those looking for jobs under the
work-study program are encouraged to
begin their search quickly.
"The funding is somewhat limited
for federal work-study and having eligi
bility doesn't necessarily guarantee you
getting money," says V.J. Nair, a finan
cial aids assistant. "You should take
care of it as soon as possible."
For students who do not qualify for
work-study, the CPPC has part-time
job binders which list on- and ofT-cam
pus jobs. Some of the job categories list
ed include research, tutoring, garden
ing and clerical work. Many of the ofT
campus jobs are within biking distance
of the University and salaries start at
around $7 per hour.
Campbell also advises freshmen to
seek out "major campus employers"
such as the Bookstore, the libraries and
University Food Service.
"If you go and visit these employers,
you may be able to hear about some
positions before they're advertised,"
says Campbell.
