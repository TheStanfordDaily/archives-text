# Diversity characterizes campus religious life
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
While many new students will enjoy hear
ing the Stanford Fleet Street Singers sing
about praying to "the God of Partial Credit,"
the song barely scratches the surface of the
University's multi-faceted religious communi
ty-
Stanford's religious life is characterized by
diversity, with an emphasis on faith as an edu
cational as well as a spiritual experience.
Approximately 30 campus organizations
represent Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Bud
dhist, Islamic, Bahai and Humanist faiths.
Although new students may find all the
choices somewhat overwhelming, Floyd
Thompkins, associate dean of Memorial
Church, advises keeping an open mind.
'God in all kinds of containers'
"New students should 'shop' for whatever
suits them," says Thompkins. "Don't get
locked into your first experience with a reli
gious group, especially if you don't feel com
fortable."
According to Thompkins, several events
aimed at introducing students to Stanford's
religious community are scheduled for Orien
tation. "The chaplaincies will be peddling
their wares and offering God in different kinds
of containers," he says.
For students who are exploring religion or

are unsure of their faith, Robert Gregg, dean
of the chapel of Memorial Church, offers infor
mal classes through the chapel office that
"explore faith in general." Students can con
tact the Memorial Church chapel office for
more information.
University public worship services, held
every Sunday at 10 a.m. in Memorial Church,
are open to people of all faiths. While Thomp
kins says that although the services are usual
ly "generic Protestant," traditions from other
faiths are sometimes included.
Memorial Church serves as the Universi
ty's umbrella organization for all campus reli
gious groups, regardless of denomination.
'Don't check in your brain at the door*
The Stanford religious community empha
sizes personal and intellectual growth not only
through one's chosen faith, but also through
exposure to other religions, according to
Thompkins.
"Religion is an important part of a stu
dent's Stanford career, and more students
participate in religious activities as a whole
than any other, except for maybe public ser
vice," he says. "We hope people will grow to
learn about and appreciate other religions."
Gregg emphasizes that religion should be
an "expansion of the imagination and pursuit
of good information."
Spirituality consists of "intellectual, per
sonal and social factors all in one," according

to Thompkins, and a lack of any one of these
"results in an imbalance of some kind."
Gregg agrees, and explains that "religious
thought and questioning and searching does
not require checking in your brain at the
door."
There are rougher places to be*
Thompkins describes Stanford's religious
community as fairly "safe," since — unlike
more urban campuses — religious cults are
not a significant presence.
"Most groups are fairly innocuous," he
says. "There are rougher places to be."
However, he does warn against unofficial
ministries, such as the Boston Church of
Christ and the San Francisco Church of
Christ. "These groups that we have not
approved often do not have ethical practices,"
Thompkins notes. "We try to insure that all of
these [approved] groups have integrity."
All of the official campus organizations are
listed in "Religious Life at Stanford," a pam
phlet published by Memorial Church and
included in new students' Orientation pack
ets.
Students may also voice any concerns about
the University's religious life to the Memorial
Church chapel, says Thompkins. "If students
are feeling badgered or belittled by any orga
nization, or if their faith is not represented, I
urge them to call the chapel."
