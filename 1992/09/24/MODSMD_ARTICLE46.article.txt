# Dazed and confused? Answers for your financial aid questions
## 
### 
For freshmen with financial aid, paying the Uni
versity bill can involve long lines, a dozen forms and
computations complicated enough to deserve math
credit.
Instead of standing in the line marked "No Clue"
when payment comes due Tuesday, you can check
out this guide to the most commonly asked ques
tions.
Prepared by Cynthia Rife, an assistant director in
the Financial Aids Office, it should be helpful in
decoding the sometimes tortuous process of settling
your bill.
Question. I have received my financial aid award
or have had changes in my award since I received the
first University Bill in August from the Bursar's
Office. Given these changes, how do I know what to
pay the University?
Answer. The Bursar's Office will produce a new
bill on the weekend before the quarter begins. That
bill will be available to you Monday and Tuesday at
the "No Bill" line in the Oak Lounge of Tresidder
Union (second floor).
Q. I am expecting awards from organizations out
side Stanford to help meet my educational costs.
How do I know if these funds have been received by
the University?
A. If the check from the outside organization was
made payable to the University (not to you or you

and the University) and was received by the Finan
cial Aids Office (FAO) by Sept. 17, it was sent to the
Bursar's Office and it will most likely be reflected as
money on deposit on the new bill available Monday.
Checks which come in after the Sept. 17 deadline
will continue to be forwarded to the Bursar's Office
but will appear on your later bill(s).
If the check from the outside organization was
made payable to you or to you and the University
and was received by the FAO by Sept. 25, it will be
available for you to pick up from FAO personnel in
the Birch Room at Tresidder Union (also second
floor) on Monday and Tuesday. If these checks come
in after the Tuesday, you can pick them up from the
FAO in Old Union Room 214.
Q. I have a student loan (Perkins, University
Long-term, Stafford, SLS), and it doesn't appear on
the bill. How and when can I get this money to pay
my bill, buy books and meet my other educational
costs?
A. Student loans don't appear as credit on the
University Bill. However, if you are borrowing
Perkins or University loan funds, check the loan
lists which will be posted on Monday and Tuesday
outside the Birch Room and in the glassed hallway at
Tresidder. The list indicates when the Bursar's
Office expects your Perkins or University loan check
will be ready for you to pick up.

There are several lines for loan pick-up in Oak
Lounge. After Tuesday, you pick these loans up
from the Bursar's Office in Old Union. Perkins and
University loan borrowers may attend the FAO's
loan information sessions which are listed in the
1992-93 Orientation Calendar.
If you are borrowing Stafford loan funds, the pro
cedures are different. Stafford loan borrowers who
are freshmen are not allowed by current legislation
to get a loan disbursement until 30 days into their
first quarter.
If you are a freshman, Nov. 2 will be the first day
you can receive this money. In the meantime, how
ever, you should plan to attend one of the loan infor
mation sessions. Attendance is required for all new
Stafford borrowers.
Q. Do I have to attend a loan information meet
ing?
A. You must attend one of these sessions if you
are borrowing a Stafford Loan for the first time dur
ing the 1992-93 academic year. The FAO sends a list
of future sessions with the financial aid award.
Future sessions are also posted in the FAO, Old
Union Room 315. Perkins and University Long-term
loan borrowers may also attend these sessions.
Q. What should I do if my Stafford loan check (or
other known financial aid resources) will not be
available by the Bursar's Tuesday payment dead

line?
A. The University makes available a deferment
loan program which you may use to cover current
term charges to avoid the risk of registration cancel
lation, late payment fees, etc. The Bursar will have
deferment loan applications available in the Oak
Lounge at Tresidder on Monday and Tuesday. These
loans are for 45 days.
If you must use the deferment loan for the por
tion of your University Bill which will be covered by
financial aid resources, when the check arrives, e.g.,
the proceeds from the Stafford Loan, take it to the
Bursar's Office. They will give you change for the
difference if your check exceeds your deferment loan
amount.
If you put the funds into your own account and
pay the deferment loan with a personal check, the
Bursar's Office will charge you fees and interest.
Q. Where can I get help with my financial aid and
billing questions?
A. First, read the information provided by both
the FAO and the Bursar's Office. Refer to the Bur
sar's publication called "The University Bill, How
To Read It, How To Pay It." If those resources fail
you, the FAO will have an information table on the
second floor of Tresidder Union on Monday and
Tuesday.

How do I know if these funds have been received by
the University?
A. If the check from the outside organization was
made payable to the University (not to you or you

and the University) and was received by the Finan
cial Aids Office (FAO) by Sept. 17, it was sent to the
Bursar's Office and it will most likely be reflected as
money on deposit on the new bill available Monday.
Checks which come in after the Sept. 17 deadline
will continue to be forwarded to the Bursar's Office
but will appear on your later bill(s).
If the check from the outside organization was
made payable to you or to you and the University
and was received by the FAO by Sept. 25, it will be
available for you to pick up from FAO personnel in
the Birch Room at Tresidder Union (also second
floor) on Monday and Tuesday. If these checks come
in after the Tuesday, you can pick them up from the
FAO in Old Union Room 214.
Q. I have a student loan (Perkins, University
Long-term, Stafford, SLS), and it doesn't appear on
the bill. How and when can I get this money to pay
my bill, buy books and meet my other educational
costs?
A. Student loans don't appear as credit on the
University Bill. However, if you are borrowing
Perkins or University loan funds, check the loan
lists which will be posted on Monday and Tuesday
outside the Birch Room and in the glassed hallway at
Tresidder. The list indicates when the Bursar's
Office expects your Perkins or University loan check
will be ready for you to pick up.

There are several lines for loan pick-up in Oak
Lounge. After Tuesday, you pick these loans up
from the Bursar's Office in Old Union. Perkins and
University loan borrowers may attend the FAO's
loan information sessions which are listed in the
1992-93 Orientation Calendar.
If you are borrowing Stafford loan funds, the pro
cedures are different. Stafford loan borrowers who
are freshmen are not allowed by current legislation
to get a loan disbursement until 30 days into their
first quarter.
If you are a freshman, Nov. 2 will be the first day
you can receive this money. In the meantime, how
ever, you should plan to attend one of the loan infor
mation sessions. Attendance is required for all new
Stafford borrowers.
Q. Do I have to attend a loan information meet
ing?
A. You must attend one of these sessions if you
are borrowing a Stafford Loan for the first time dur
ing the 1992-93 academic year. The FAO sends a list
of future sessions with the financial aid award.
Future sessions are also posted in the FAO, Old
Union Room 315. Perkins and University Long-term
loan borrowers may also attend these sessions.
Q. What should I do if my Stafford loan check (or
other known financial aid resources) will not be
available by the Bursar's Tuesday payment dead

line?
A. The University makes available a deferment
loan program which you may use to cover current
term charges to avoid the risk of registration cancel
lation, late payment fees, etc. The Bursar will have
deferment loan applications available in the Oak
Lounge at Tresidder on Monday and Tuesday. These
loans are for 45 days.
If you must use the deferment loan for the por
tion of your University Bill which will be covered by
financial aid resources, when the check arrives, e.g.,
the proceeds from the Stafford Loan, take it to the
Bursar's Office. They will give you change for the
difference if your check exceeds your deferment loan
amount.
If you put the funds into your own account and
pay the deferment loan with a personal check, the
Bursar's Office will charge you fees and interest.
Q. Where can I get help with my financial aid and
billing questions?
A. First, read the information provided by both
the FAO and the Bursar's Office. Refer to the Bur
sar's publication called "The University Bill, How
To Read It, How To Pay It." If those resources fail
you, the FAO will have an information table on the
second floor of Tresidder Union on Monday and
Tuesday.
