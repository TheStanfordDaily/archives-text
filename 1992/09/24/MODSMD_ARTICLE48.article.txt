# Cardinal Olympians: A golden summer in Spain
## 
### Andy Eiser Editorial staff 
They happen but once every
four years, and they last only 16
days.
They are the Summer
Olympics, a showcase for some
athletes and the pratfall of count
less others, where lifelong gold
medal dreams are either realized
or dashed in a matter of
moments.
For Stanford athletes past and
present, the 1992 Games of the
XXVth Olympiad in Barcelona,
Spain were a testimony to their
ability to compete and win not
only in the collegiate arena, but
also against an ever-improving,
ever-expanding international
field.
The Cardinal has been repre
sented in previous Olympic
Games, but this year's 38-mem
ber delegation truly reigned in
Spain, earning medals and turn
ing in honorable performances
nearly every day in a wide range
of sports and events.
In the end, Stanford achieved
as if it were a nation unto itself.
Its 19 total medals — 10 gold,
four silver, and five bronze —
would have placed the university
in 13th position in the final stand
ings (in a three-way tie with Italy
and Poland), just one medal
behind Great Britain and one
ahead of Canada and Romania.
Its 10 top finishes alone would
have made the Cardinal the
ninth-most-golden nation of the
172 competing, ahead of the likes
of France, Australia and Japan.
Aquatic dominance
Perhaps simultaneously the
most and least surprising aspects
of Stanford's Olympic success
could be found in the pool. When
the Cardinal captured both the
NCAA men's and women's swim
ming championships by record
margins last March, predictions
of a big Olympics were rampant.
However, what nobody could have
predicted was the onslaught of 17
medals — 10 gold, four silver and
three bronze — to be bestowed in
one short week upon Stanford
swimmers. All told, the school's
representatives were rewarded
with a sizable haul of precious
metal, the total value of which
would have been surpassed only
by the United States itself if Car
dinal swimmers were indepen
dent.

Even more remarkable than
the sum of Stanford's in-pool
Olympic accomplishments, though,
was the composition of its swim
ming delegation, one that repre
sented the totality of Cardinal
dominance in the past, present
and — hopefully — the future.
There was 27-year-old Pablo
Morales, a budding attorney who
took time off from law school to
relive his glory days of yesteryear.
He earned his long-coveted 100-
meter butterfly gold this year
after coming up with a near-miss
silver in Los Angeles in 1984 and
failing to qualify in the event at
the 1988 U.S. trials. While he last
competed for the Cardinal in the
mid-1980s, Morales returned to
train with Stanford coach Skip
Kenney for this year's Olympics,
where he also grabbed a second
gold and a world record by swim
ming the fly leg of the U.S. 400
medley relay.
On the other end of the spec
trum, there was 18-year-old Joe
Hudepohl, an incoming freshman
who figures to extend Cardinal
control of collegiate competition
well into the '90's. Coming off of a
world-record showing at the U.S.
Trials in March, the Ohio-based
high school senior raced to a gold
and a bronze in Spain while lead
ing off the 400 and 800 freestyle
relays, respectively, for the Unit
ed States.
Filling the generation gap were
all of today's familiar faces:
•Summer Sanders, who forfeit
ed her collegiate eligibility this
year, topped Stanford's individual
medalist standings by garnering
two golds, a silver and a bronze.
Included in her total were two
golds — for swimming the quali
fying fly leg in the U.S. 400 relay
and the individual 200 fly — as
well as two American records
gained for a silver-medal perfor
mance in the 200 individual med
ley and a bronze-medal showing
in the 400 IM. Sanders' Olympic
appearance, in addition to bring
ing in countless endorsement
offers, enabled her to appear on
"Late Night with David Letter
man" and to fulfill a longtime
dream by making a cameo appear
ance on the soap opera "All My
Children."
•Jenny Thompson, now a Car
dinal sophomore, finished one
tick below Sanders by racking up
three Olympic medals, including
an individual silver in the 100
freestyle and two golds as part of

world record-setting 400 freestyle
and medley relays.
•Janet Evans, who gave up her
remaining NCAA eligibility in
1991, emerged from Barcelona
with a gold in the 800 freestyle
and a silver in the 400 freestyle.
After more than a year away from
Stanford, Evans will return to the
classroom this fall.
•Jeff Rouse, a 1992 Stanford
graduate, earned a silver in the
100 backstroke and established a
world record while leading off the
record-setting U.S. 400 medley
relay.
•Lea Loveless, who will be
returning for her senior season in
1993, earned a bronze in the 100
backstroke and a world record
and a gold for her part in the U.S.
400 medley relay.
The only non-swimming
Olympic medals earned by Cardi
nal athletes came on the volley
ball courts of Barcelona, where
Kim Oden and Scott Fortune

were part of the bronze medal
winning U.S. women's and men's
teams, respectively. Oden, a mid
dle blocker, was a 1986 graduate
of Stanford, receiving several all
conference and All-American hon
ors in her four years here; the
Irvine, Calif, native is a sister of
current Stanford star Bev Oden.
Fortune, an outside hitter
from Laguna Beach, Calif, is cur
rently a star on the Association of
Volleyball Professionals beach
tour, and spent some time in a
Cardinal uniform in the mid
1980s. To add to the gold medal
he earned as a member of the
1988 U.S. team, Fortune was
named "Best Digger" among all
participants in the 1992 Olympic
tournament.
Incidentally, Fred Sturm, who
coached Fortune and the Olympic
men's volleyball team but did not
receive a medal, was Oden's coach
when she was at Stanford.

No cigars
Olympic glory is not derived
solely from placing in the top
three, however. Several non
medal-winning performances of
note were turned in by current
and former Stanford athletes.
The U.S. baseball team, which
wound up finishing a mildly dis
appointing fourth, featured three
members of the 1992 Stanford
squad. Jeffrey Hammonds, a cen
terfielder who finished a three
year collegiate career last spring
before becoming the first-round
pick of the Baltimore Orioles
(fourth overall) in the June ama
teur draft, was one of America's
top Olympic sluggers.
Rick Helling, a hard-throwing
hurler who graduated in June,
took an Olympic detour on the
way to reporting to the Texas
Rangers, who had snagged him in
the June draft. Willie Adams,
another pitcher, will return to

Stanford for his junior season in
1993.
Other current Stanford dele
gates included two competitors
who will be seniors in the upcom
ing school year, Jair Lynch and
Nick Bravin. Lynch, who led the
Cardinal men's gymnastics team
to its first-ever NCAA crown in
April, helped the U.S. team to a
sixth-place showing in Barcelona;
he also picked up a sixth-place in
the parallel bars in the individual
all-around competition. Bravin,
who has highlighted an improv
ing Cardinal fencing program for
the past three seasons, took 39th
in the individual foil event in
Spain.
The most notable foreign per
former for the Cardinal, Aus
tralia's Andrew Vlahov, brought
to mind images of the 1991 NIT
Championship earned by the
men's basketball team. Vlahov, a

power forward for both Stanford
and the Aussies, never did com
pete against the United States'
"Dream Team," but came away
with a sixth-place and a trip to
Europe for his troubles.
Two former Stanford water
polo players, Erich Fischer and
Craig Klass, proved that swim
mers aren't the only ones who can
garner aquatic prowess for the
Cardinal, while PattiSue Plumer,
a Cardinal track star of yesteryear,
was America's most successful
women's distance runner, earning
a fifth place in the 3000 meters
and a 10th in the 1500 meters.
Best ever?
The list of individual success
stories goes on, as all 38 athletes
realized the culmination of their
lifelong dreams. For many, the
Olympic Games would be the
zenith of their athletic lives, and
in 1992, Barcelona provided the
stage on which Stanford athletics
were to steal the show.
Many once and future Cardi
nal competitors will find their
way back to the 1996 Games in
Atlanta, Georgia, and to Olympics
beyond that, but they may never
again achieve the collective dis
tinction they saw in Barcelona.

On the other end of the spec
trum, there was 18-year-old Joe
Hudepohl, an incoming freshman
who figures to extend Cardinal
control of collegiate competition
well into the '90's. Coming off of a
world-record showing at the U.S.
Trials in March, the Ohio-based
high school senior raced to a gold
and a bronze in Spain while lead
ing off the 400 and 800 freestyle
relays, respectively, for the Unit
ed States.
Filling the generation gap were
all of today's familiar faces:
•Summer Sanders, who forfeit
ed her collegiate eligibility this
year, topped Stanford's individual
medalist standings by garnering
two golds, a silver and a bronze.
Included in her total were two
golds — for swimming the quali
fying fly leg in the U.S. 400 relay
and the individual 200 fly — as
well as two American records
gained for a silver-medal perfor
mance in the 200 individual med
ley and a bronze-medal showing
in the 400 IM. Sanders' Olympic
appearance, in addition to bring
ing in countless endorsement
offers, enabled her to appear on
"Late Night with David Letter
man" and to fulfill a longtime
dream by making a cameo appear
ance on the soap opera "All My
Children."
•Jenny Thompson, now a Car
dinal sophomore, finished one
tick below Sanders by racking up
three Olympic medals, including
an individual silver in the 100
freestyle and two golds as part of

world record-setting 400 freestyle
and medley relays.
•Janet Evans, who gave up her
remaining NCAA eligibility in
1991, emerged from Barcelona
with a gold in the 800 freestyle
and a silver in the 400 freestyle.
After more than a year away from
Stanford, Evans will return to the
classroom this fall.
•Jeff Rouse, a 1992 Stanford
graduate, earned a silver in the
100 backstroke and established a
world record while leading off the
record-setting U.S. 400 medley
relay.
•Lea Loveless, who will be
returning for her senior season in
1993, earned a bronze in the 100
backstroke and a world record
and a gold for her part in the U.S.
400 medley relay.
The only non-swimming
Olympic medals earned by Cardi
nal athletes came on the volley
ball courts of Barcelona, where
Kim Oden and Scott Fortune

were part of the bronze medal
winning U.S. women's and men's
teams, respectively. Oden, a mid
dle blocker, was a 1986 graduate
of Stanford, receiving several all
conference and All-American hon
ors in her four years here; the
Irvine, Calif, native is a sister of
current Stanford star Bev Oden.
Fortune, an outside hitter
from Laguna Beach, Calif, is cur
rently a star on the Association of
Volleyball Professionals beach
tour, and spent some time in a
Cardinal uniform in the mid
1980s. To add to the gold medal
he earned as a member of the
1988 U.S. team, Fortune was
named "Best Digger" among all
participants in the 1992 Olympic
tournament.
Incidentally, Fred Sturm, who
coached Fortune and the Olympic
men's volleyball team but did not
receive a medal, was Oden's coach
when she was at Stanford.

No cigars
Olympic glory is not derived
solely from placing in the top
three, however. Several non
medal-winning performances of
note were turned in by current
and former Stanford athletes.
The U.S. baseball team, which
wound up finishing a mildly dis
appointing fourth, featured three
members of the 1992 Stanford
squad. Jeffrey Hammonds, a cen
terfielder who finished a three
year collegiate career last spring
before becoming the first-round
pick of the Baltimore Orioles
(fourth overall) in the June ama
teur draft, was one of America's
top Olympic sluggers.
Rick Helling, a hard-throwing
hurler who graduated in June,
took an Olympic detour on the
way to reporting to the Texas
Rangers, who had snagged him in
the June draft. Willie Adams,
another pitcher, will return to

Stanford for his junior season in
1993.
Other current Stanford dele
gates included two competitors
who will be seniors in the upcom
ing school year, Jair Lynch and
Nick Bravin. Lynch, who led the
Cardinal men's gymnastics team
to its first-ever NCAA crown in
April, helped the U.S. team to a
sixth-place showing in Barcelona;
he also picked up a sixth-place in
the parallel bars in the individual
all-around competition. Bravin,
who has highlighted an improv
ing Cardinal fencing program for
the past three seasons, took 39th
in the individual foil event in
Spain.
The most notable foreign per
former for the Cardinal, Aus
tralia's Andrew Vlahov, brought
to mind images of the 1991 NIT
Championship earned by the
men's basketball team. Vlahov, a

power forward for both Stanford
and the Aussies, never did com
pete against the United States'
"Dream Team," but came away
with a sixth-place and a trip to
Europe for his troubles.
Two former Stanford water
polo players, Erich Fischer and
Craig Klass, proved that swim
mers aren't the only ones who can
garner aquatic prowess for the
Cardinal, while PattiSue Plumer,
a Cardinal track star of yesteryear,
was America's most successful
women's distance runner, earning
a fifth place in the 3000 meters
and a 10th in the 1500 meters.
Best ever?
The list of individual success
stories goes on, as all 38 athletes
realized the culmination of their
lifelong dreams. For many, the
Olympic Games would be the
zenith of their athletic lives, and
in 1992, Barcelona provided the
stage on which Stanford athletics
were to steal the show.
Many once and future Cardi
nal competitors will find their
way back to the 1996 Games in
Atlanta, Georgia, and to Olympics
beyond that, but they may never
again achieve the collective dis
tinction they saw in Barcelona.
They happen but once every
four years, and they last only 16
days.
They are the Summer
Olympics, a showcase for some
athletes and the pratfall of count
less others, where lifelong gold
medal dreams are either realized
or dashed in a matter of
moments.
For Stanford athletes past and
present, the 1992 Games of the
XXVth Olympiad in Barcelona,
Spain were a testimony to their
ability to compete and win not
only in the collegiate arena, but
also against an ever-improving,
ever-expanding international
field.
The Cardinal has been repre
sented in previous Olympic
Games, but this year's 38-mem
ber delegation truly reigned in
Spain, earning medals and turn
ing in honorable performances
nearly every day in a wide range
of sports and events.
In the end, Stanford achieved
as if it were a nation unto itself.
Its 19 total medals — 10 gold,
four silver, and five bronze —
would have placed the university
in 13th position in the final stand
ings (in a three-way tie with Italy
and Poland), just one medal
behind Great Britain and one
ahead of Canada and Romania.
Its 10 top finishes alone would
have made the Cardinal the
ninth-most-golden nation of the
172 competing, ahead of the likes
of France, Australia and Japan.
Aquatic dominance
Perhaps simultaneously the
most and least surprising aspects
of Stanford's Olympic success
could be found in the pool. When
the Cardinal captured both the
NCAA men's and women's swim
ming championships by record
margins last March, predictions
of a big Olympics were rampant.
However, what nobody could have
predicted was the onslaught of 17
medals — 10 gold, four silver and
three bronze — to be bestowed in
one short week upon Stanford
swimmers. All told, the school's
representatives were rewarded
with a sizable haul of precious
metal, the total value of which
would have been surpassed only
by the United States itself if Car
dinal swimmers were indepen
dent.

Even more remarkable than
the sum of Stanford's in-pool
Olympic accomplishments, though,
was the composition of its swim
ming delegation, one that repre
sented the totality of Cardinal
dominance in the past, present
and — hopefully — the future.
There was 27-year-old Pablo
Morales, a budding attorney who
took time off from law school to
relive his glory days of yesteryear.
He earned his long-coveted 100-
meter butterfly gold this year
after coming up with a near-miss
silver in Los Angeles in 1984 and
failing to qualify in the event at
the 1988 U.S. trials. While he last
competed for the Cardinal in the
mid-1980s, Morales returned to
train with Stanford coach Skip
Kenney for this year's Olympics,
where he also grabbed a second
gold and a world record by swim
ming the fly leg of the U.S. 400
medley relay.

Cardinal uniform in the mid
1980s. To add to the gold medal
he earned as a member of the
1988 U.S. team, Fortune was
named "Best Digger" among all
participants in the 1992 Olympic
tournament.
Incidentally, Fred Sturm, who
coached Fortune and the Olympic
men's volleyball team but did not
receive a medal, was Oden's coach
when she was at Stanford.

No cigars
Olympic glory is not derived
solely from placing in the top
three, however. Several non
medal-winning performances of
note were turned in by current
and former Stanford athletes.
The U.S. baseball team, which
wound up finishing a mildly dis
appointing fourth, featured three
members of the 1992 Stanford
squad. Jeffrey Hammonds, a cen
terfielder who finished a three
year collegiate career last spring
before becoming the first-round
pick of the Baltimore Orioles
(fourth overall) in the June ama
teur draft, was one of America's
top Olympic sluggers.
Rick Helling, a hard-throwing
hurler who graduated in June,
took an Olympic detour on the
way to reporting to the Texas
Rangers, who had snagged him in
the June draft. Willie Adams,
another pitcher, will return to

Stanford for his junior season in
1993.
Other current Stanford dele
gates included two competitors
who will be seniors in the upcom
ing school year, Jair Lynch and
Nick Bravin. Lynch, who led the
Cardinal men's gymnastics team
to its first-ever NCAA crown in
April, helped the U.S. team to a
sixth-place showing in Barcelona;
he also picked up a sixth-place in
the parallel bars in the individual
all-around competition. Bravin,
who has highlighted an improv
ing Cardinal fencing program for
the past three seasons, took 39th
in the individual foil event in
Spain.
The most notable foreign per
former for the Cardinal, Aus
tralia's Andrew Vlahov, brought
to mind images of the 1991 NIT
Championship earned by the
men's basketball team. Vlahov, a

power forward for both Stanford
and the Aussies, never did com

"Dream Team," but came away
with a sixth-place and a trip to
Europe for his troubles.
Two former Stanford water
polo players, Erich Fischer and
Craig Klass, proved that swim
mers aren't the only ones who can
garner aquatic prowess for the
Cardinal, while PattiSue Plumer,
a Cardinal track star of yesteryear,
was America's most successful
women's distance runner, earning
a fifth place in the 3000 meters
and a 10th in the 1500 meters.
Best ever?
The list of individual success
stories goes on, as all 38 athletes
realized the culmination of their
lifelong dreams. For many, the
Olympic Games would be the
zenith of their athletic lives, and
in 1992, Barcelona provided the
stage on which Stanford athletics
were to steal the show.
Many once and future Cardi
nal competitors will find their
way back to the 1996 Games in
Atlanta, Georgia, and to Olympics
beyond that, but they may never
again achieve the collective dis
tinction they saw in Barcelona.
