# Stanford high-fived at NCAA's

Dynasty.
The name conjures images of power
and success. It is a title that fits Stan
ford athletics.
The players responsible for the suc
cess are as diverse as the actors in the
soap opera of the same name. However,
for the Cardinal, it is not Linda Evans
or Joan Collins, but Summer Sanders
and Tara VanDerveer. Nor is John
Forsythe the leader of this clan, but
Ted Leland, who in his first full year
presided over one of the most success
ful intercollegiate athletic programs in
history.
1992 will go down in Stanford aca
demic history as a time of accounting
woes and budget blunders. However,
the athletic annals will chronicle this as
the Year of Champions, as Stanford
won five team titles in only 66 days,
tying a record set by in 1981-82
for most titles in a school year.
The NCAA titles garnered by both
swim teams, along with men's tennis,
further solidified their claims to dynas
ties. The women's basketball team's
second title in three seasons stamped
Tara VanDerveer as one of the best
program builders in college basketball,
regardless of gender. And the men's
gymnastics team peaked at the right
time, culminating in its first national
title.
When it comes to penthouse living,
tennis coach Dick Gould has a lifetime
lease. Since 1973, Gould has led Stan
ford to twelve team titles. His numbers
border on gaudy. Four titles in the last
five years. Five titles in the past seven
years.
The 1992 title, won in Athens, Geor
gia, culminated the most dominating
performance seen in those parts since
Sherman made mincemeat of the Con
federacy. Only four matches were lost
in the NCAA Championships, including
the first shutout in tournament finals,
a 5-0 pasting of Notre Dame.
Alex O'Brien was the all-everything
leader of the squad. He earned his third
All-America selection while posting a
20-5 record in singles play. He capped
off his Stanford career by winning an
unheard-of "triple" — in addition to
contributing to the team title, he also
won the singles and doubles titles (with
sophomore Chris Cocotos in the latter).
This championship, however, had a
special feel to it."I honestly felt we'd be
a second-5 team," Gould said. "To do
better than that was better than any
thing I thought possible."

O'Brien, of course, was a known
quantity. "We knew we had an out
standing No. 1 player," Gould said. He
cited Mike Flanagan and Cocotos as
players who made up the slack for the
loss of two current professionals, Jared
Palmer and Jonathan Stark.
Of all his titles, Gould cited this one
as being the most special. "It was with
out a doubt the most gratifying," Gould
said. "It takes a lot of luck; it takes a lot
of work. Stanford should be very proud
of them, on and off the court."
The pride should extend from the
courts to the pool, as deGuerre housed
two national champions. It also is the
unofficial swimming capital of the
world, as Stanford swimmers were the
world's most successful contingent at
the Barcelona Games.
The fact that this was an Olympic
year was a large motivating factor for
both teams. "The Olympics were the
focus," assistant women's swimming
coach Ross Geary said.
The timing of the year's major com
petitions played a part in Stanford's
success. The Olympic trials were held
ten days prior to the women's champi
onships. This meant that most of the
pressure was gone when the national
title was on the line. "Emotionally, the
worst part was over. At the NCAA's, we
could just let go and swim fast," Geary
said.
They did just that. Among the seven
records set were American bests in the
400-meter medley relay and the 200
individual medley (by Summer
Sanders). Stanford finished with 735.5
points, easily besting the host team
from Texas. Richard Quick, women's
swimming coach, remarked, "That was
probably the best team effort I've ever
seen." That is high praise from a man
who has won seven national titles in his
coaching career, the last two coming
with Stanford in 1989 and 1992.
As dominating as the women's team
performance was, the men seized the
spotlight a week later at the champi
onships in Indianapolis. They also set
seven American records, while winning
all the relays for the first time in NCAA
history. The team eclipsed an NCAA
Championship point record while scor
ing the most lopsided victory ever.
Led by NCAA Swimmer of the Year
Jeff Rouse, Stanford continued its
aquatic dynasty, winning its fourth
title in eight seasons. All of Stanford's
18 swimmers contributed, with each
member of the squad earning Ail-
American status. The performance of
this dynamic squad helped Skip Ken
nev earn NCAA Coach of the Year hon

ors for the fifth time.
A newcomer to the championship
block was men's gymnastics. Coach
Sadao Hamada won his first title since
coming to the Farm 20 years ago. Led
by Olympian Jair Lynch, Stanford set
the record for most points ever in an
NCAA competition — and did it at the
NCAA Championships.
Despite such a heroic effort, Stan
ford defeated the host Nebraska Corn
huskers by only .625 points. Jeff Ben
der clinched the victory with a 9.775 on
the high bar.
The team was a perfect example of
how to peak at the right time. Right
after the victory, Hamada was quoted
as saying, "Two weeks ago, in the West
Regional, I said we wanted to be about
80 or 90 percent, and then 95 percent
last night (in the NCAA Semifinals)
and today — 100 percent."
He got just what he wanted.
Tara VanDerveer may have received
more than she wanted. At the begin
ning of practice, she considered her
squad a ".500 team."
But VanDerveer was not the only
skeptic. With three All-Pacific 10 Con
ference performers gone, chances of a
third straight Final Four seemed unre
alistic at best.
Yet the team gelled tremendously.
Molly Goodenbour conjured images of
her great point-guard predecessors,
Sonja Henning and Jennifer Azzi. Val
Whiting became the best interior play
er in the collegiate game. Plus, the
fabulous freshmen performed
admirably.
But, had this team not defeated Ten
nessee in an early season showdown,
the confidence the squad needed in
March may never have appeared.
The winner of this annual regular
season clash has gone on to win the
national title in each of the last three
seasons. Form held last year, as Stan
ford squeezed out a 96-95 overtime tri
umph in the most exciting game ever to
grace the hardwood of Maples Pavilion
It took one more epic victory, how
ever, to secure the team's second
national title in three seasons. The
national semifinal pitted the Cardinal
against Virginia, the tournament's
top-ranked team. Val Whiting's two
free throws late in the game propelled
Stanford to a 66-65 heart-stopping vic
tory. The next day, Stanford over
whelmed an overmatched Western
Kentucky, and the national title and
the balance of power in women's bas
ketball returned to the Farm.
Five national championships. Sixty
six davs. What a ride.

season. It was one of five national championships earned by Cardinal athletes.
