# 'He's the intermediate between scientist and politician'
## Biologist Ehrlich stirs controversy—and loves it 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Moving from the sphere of academia
to the more ambiguous world of popular
activism has always been tricky.
"I've been called a Marxist by the far
right and a fascist by the far left," said
Biological Sciences Prof. Paul Ehrlich,
one of the world's most well-known pop
ulation biologists and a member of the
Stanford faculty since 1959.
Other names the controversial scien
tist has been called range from the
"doomsday" scientist to a "latter-day
Malthus for Palo Alto" to "the Cassan
dra of the contraceptive set" to simply
"infallibly wrong."
But despite the criticism, Ehrlich still
managed to win the 1990 Crafoord prize
— the ecologist's equivalent of the
Nobel prize — for his work in popula
tion studies.
He first made headlines in 1968 with
the publication of his book "The Popula
tion Bomb," which explored the rela
tionship between the size of the human
population and the environment.
Robert Simoni, the chair of the Bio
logical Sciences Department, said he
ranked Ehrlich's book with Rachel Car
son's "The Silent Spring" — the book
considered by many to be the spark for
the environmental movement.
"It sounded the alarm and it had the
same kind of impact about the role of

population in the environment — that
all problems of a global nature can be
traced back to population," Simoni said.
Ehrlich said he wrote "The Popula
tion Bomb" at the encouragement of
David Brower, who was then the head of
the Sierra Club. Brower asked Ehrlich
to write down his findings in a way that
non-scientists could understand.
The book, which sold over 2 million
copies, has been acknowledged by many
as a great influence on the developing
environmental movement of the late
1960s and the 19705.
But that's not the only reason
Ehrlich has appeared on "The Tonight
Show" more than 20 times.
He's become a popular national fig
ure because of his straightforward way
of speaking and for his unorthodox,
attention-grabbing statements.
"Paul always states things in terms of
hype," said Biological Sciences Prof.
Peter Ray. "He tends to exaggerate
because he wants to get people's atten
tion, and stirring up controversy is the
way to do it.
"As scientists, one doesn't tend to
make overstatements. But as politicians
one does .. . and he's the intermediate
between scientist and politician. I think
that'B very valuable," Hay said.
In the early 19705, for instance, he
demanded that both Richard Nixon and

appearances, is no stranger to fame. His two-million copy 1968 bestseller "The Popu
lation Bomb" heavily Influenced the environmental movement.
Lyndon B. Johnson be tried as
war criminals for "ecocide."
But while Ehrlich's sugges
tions have sometimes been called
ridiculous, he generally has had
the support of many scientists.
For instance, when he and two
other scientists drafted the "Scien
tist's Statement on Birth Control
Encyclical" in 1968 — a protest
against the Pope's stand on birth
control — the statement was signed
by more than 2,000 other scientists.
"That's just Paul," Simoni
said. "It's what makes him very
effective, because he's provocative
and makes people think about
controversial issues."
Ehrlich also has the support of
many of Stanford's scientists,
including former University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy. In a letter
to the San Francisco Chronicle,
Kennedy defended Ehrlich's pro
fessional qualifications, which
had been questioned by some.
"We are not necessarily in
unanimous agreement with him

about the details of proposed
political solutions to the popula
tion crises," Kennedy wrote. "But
we emphatically do agree that a
crisis exists."
Of course, that is where much
of the controversy lies — over
exactly what action should be
taken to solve the environmen
tal/population crisis.
Some of Ehrlich's writings call
ing for government-imposed birth
control and praising China's one
child policy have received heavy
criticism.
Ehrlich said he doesn't mind
provoking people — even to the
point of getting threats, adding,
"if I don't get responses out of
people, then I don't feel like I'm
doing enough."
His most recent work, published
in 1990, is "The Population Explo
sion," which updated some of the
information from the 1968 book.
As with many of his 30-plus
books, it was co-authored by his
wife Anne, who is a senior
research biologist at Stanford.
Almost everything he has writ
ten has "related back to the sam 6
thing about population and envi
ronment," Ehrlich said, "even

when I write about birds."
He said he is working on a
review of "The Population Bomb"
right now, "looking at the mis
takes in the book and making
changes to update things."
Not that any of his basic ideas
have changed, though — just
some of the details, he said.
"The world knows a lot more
now, and I know a lot more now,"
Ehrlich said.
But even though the world
moved forward, Ehrlich says that
Ronald Reagan and the 1980s
"turned back the clock" on the
ecological progress of the 19705.
"We've had 12 years of Marxist
presidents," Ehrlich said. "Not as
in Karl Marx, but as in Groucho
Marx, who said, 'Why should we
care about posterity? What have
those bastards ever done for us?' "
He said Stanford has been
"going in the right direction" for a
long time, but that "public inter
est comes and goes." The prob
lem, he says, is that people aren't
open enough to accept less con
ventional ideas and solutions.
"If someone tells you, 'You can't
tell me x, x, and x,' then you really
can't tell them anything," he said.

"infallibly wrong."
But despite the criticism, Ehrlich still
managed to win the 1990 Crafoord prize
— the ecologist's equivalent of the
Nobel prize — for his work in popula
tion studies.
He first made headlines in 1968 with
the publication of his book "The Popula
tion Bomb," which explored the rela
tionship between the size of the human
population and the environment.
Robert Simoni, the chair of the Bio
logical Sciences Department, said he
ranked Ehrlich's book with Rachel Car
son's "The Silent Spring" — the book
considered by many to be the spark for
the environmental movement.
"It sounded the alarm and it had the
same kind of impact about the role of

population in the environment — that
all problems of a global nature can be
traced back to population," Simoni said.
Ehrlich said he wrote "The Popula
tion Bomb" at the encouragement of
David Brower, who was then the head of
the Sierra Club. Brower asked Ehrlich
to write down his findings in a way that
non-scientists could understand.
The book, which sold over 2 million
copies, has been acknowledged by many
as a great influence on the developing
environmental movement of the late
1960s and the 19705.
But that's not the only reason
Ehrlich has appeared on "The Tonight
Show" more than 20 times.
He's become a popular national fig
ure because of his straightforward way
of speaking and for his unorthodox,
attention-grabbing statements.
"Paul always states things in terms of
hype," said Biological Sciences Prof.
Peter Ray. "He tends to exaggerate
because he wants to get people's atten
tion, and stirring up controversy is the
way to do it.
"As scientists, one doesn't tend to
make overstatements. But as politicians
one does .. . and he's the intermediate
between scientist and politician. I think
that'B very valuable," Hay said.
In the early 19705, for instance, he
demanded that both Richard Nixon and

appearances, is no stranger to fame. His two-million copy 1968 bestseller "The Popu
lation Bomb" heavily Influenced the environmental movement.
Lyndon B. Johnson be tried as
war criminals for "ecocide."
But while Ehrlich's sugges
tions have sometimes been called
ridiculous, he generally has had
the support of many scientists.
For instance, when he and two
other scientists drafted the "Scien
tist's Statement on Birth Control
Encyclical" in 1968 — a protest
against the Pope's stand on birth
control — the statement was signed
by more than 2,000 other scientists.
"That's just Paul," Simoni
said. "It's what makes him very
effective, because he's provocative
and makes people think about
controversial issues."
Ehrlich also has the support of
many of Stanford's scientists,
including former University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy. In a letter
to the San Francisco Chronicle,
Kennedy defended Ehrlich's pro
fessional qualifications, which
had been questioned by some.
"We are not necessarily in
unanimous agreement with him

about the details of proposed
political solutions to the popula
tion crises," Kennedy wrote. "But
we emphatically do agree that a
crisis exists."
Of course, that is where much
of the controversy lies — over
exactly what action should be
taken to solve the environmen
tal/population crisis.
Some of Ehrlich's writings call
ing for government-imposed birth
control and praising China's one
child policy have received heavy
criticism.
Ehrlich said he doesn't mind
provoking people — even to the
point of getting threats, adding,
"if I don't get responses out of
people, then I don't feel like I'm
doing enough."
His most recent work, published
in 1990, is "The Population Explo
sion," which updated some of the
information from the 1968 book.
As with many of his 30-plus
books, it was co-authored by his
wife Anne, who is a senior
research biologist at Stanford.
Almost everything he has writ
ten has "related back to the sam 6
thing about population and envi
ronment," Ehrlich said, "even

when I write about birds."
He said he is working on a
review of "The Population Bomb"
right now, "looking at the mis
takes in the book and making
changes to update things."
Not that any of his basic ideas
have changed, though — just
some of the details, he said.
"The world knows a lot more
now, and I know a lot more now,"
Ehrlich said.
But even though the world
moved forward, Ehrlich says that
Ronald Reagan and the 1980s
"turned back the clock" on the
ecological progress of the 19705.
"We've had 12 years of Marxist
presidents," Ehrlich said. "Not as
in Karl Marx, but as in Groucho
Marx, who said, 'Why should we
care about posterity? What have
those bastards ever done for us?' "
He said Stanford has been
"going in the right direction" for a
long time, but that "public inter
est comes and goes." The prob
lem, he says, is that people aren't
open enough to accept less con
ventional ideas and solutions.
"If someone tells you, 'You can't
tell me x, x, and x,' then you really
can't tell them anything," he said.
Moving from the sphere of academia
to the more ambiguous world of popular
activism has always been tricky.
"I've been called a Marxist by the far
right and a fascist by the far left," said
Biological Sciences Prof. Paul Ehrlich,
one of the world's most well-known pop
ulation biologists and a member of the
Stanford faculty since 1959.
Other names the controversial scien
tist has been called range from the
"doomsday" scientist to a "latter-day
Malthus for Palo Alto" to "the Cassan
dra of the contraceptive set" to simply
"infallibly wrong."
