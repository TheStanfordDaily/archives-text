# 'He's the intermediate between scientist and politician'
## Biologist Ehrlich stirs controversy—and loves it

Moving from the sphere of academia
to the more ambiguous world of popular
activism has always been tricky.
"I've been called a Marxist by the far
right and a fascist by the far left," said
Biological Sciences Prof. Paul Ehrlich,
one of the world's most well-known pop
ulation biologists and a member of the
Stanford faculty since 1959.
Other names the controversial scien
tist has been called range from the
"doomsday" scientist to a "latter-day
Malthus for Palo Alto" to "the Cassan
dra of the contraceptive set" to simply
"infallibly wrong."
But despite the criticism, Ehrlich still
managed to win the 1990 Crafoord prize
— the ecologist's equivalent of the
Nobel prize — for his work in popula
tion studies.
He first made headlines in 1968 with
the publication of his book "The Popula
tion Bomb," which explored the rela
tionship between the size of the human
population and the environment.
Robert Simoni, the chair of the Bio
logical Sciences Department, said he
ranked Ehrlich's book with Rachel Car
son's "The Silent Spring" — the book
considered by many to be the spark for
the environmental movement.
"It sounded the alarm and it had the
same kind of impact about the role of

population in the environment — that
all problems of a global nature can be
traced back to population," Simoni said.
Ehrlich said he wrote "The Popula
tion Bomb" at the encouragement of
David Brower, who was then the head of
the Sierra Club. Brower asked Ehrlich
to write down his findings in a way that
non-scientists could understand.
The book, which sold over 2 million
copies, has been acknowledged by many
as a great influence on the developing
environmental movement of the late
1960s and the 19705.
But that's not the only reason
Ehrlich has appeared on "The Tonight
Show" more than 20 times.
He's become a popular national fig
ure because of his straightforward way
of speaking and for his unorthodox,
attention-grabbing statements.
"Paul always states things in terms of
hype," said Biological Sciences Prof.
Peter Ray. "He tends to exaggerate
because he wants to get people's atten
tion, and stirring up controversy is the
way to do it.
"As scientists, one doesn't tend to
make overstatements. But as politicians
one does .. . and he's the intermediate
between scientist and politician. I think
that'B very valuable," Hay said.
In the early 19705, for instance, he
demanded that both Richard Nixon and

Biological Sciences Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a veteran of more than 20 "Tonight Show"
appearances, is no stranger to fame. His two-million copy 1968 bestseller "The Popu
lation Bomb" heavily Influenced the environmental movement.
