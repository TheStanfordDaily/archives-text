If it hadn't been for a controversial call at a cru
cial moment of the "Cardinal's opening game against
Texas A&M, Stanford could be 3-0 heading into this
Saturday's game with Bay Area rival San Jose
State.
On Aug. 26, Stanford kicked off the 1992 college
football season with an impressive, though frus
trating, 10-7 loss to the Aggies in the Disneyland
Pigskin Classic. With the Cardinal leading at the
intermission, Stanford's offense sputtered in the
second half and never seriously threatened again.
Despite outgaining the Aggies in total yards, 236-
196, and holding them to just 64 yards rushing, the
game slipped away in the fourth quarter when
Texas A&M managed all of its 10 points.
The game turned on a crucial call in the fourth
quarter which upset the rhythm of the contest.
Quarterback Steve Stenstrom attempted a pass to a
tailback Glyn Milburn in the flat which was ruled an
interception. However, replays showed that not only
was the ball possibly trapped by an Aggie defender,
but also that Milburn may have been interfered
with.
Stenstrom completed 17 of 33 passes for 161
yards with two interceptions on the game. The
offensive line, clearly damaged by the loss of left
tackle Bob Whitfield to the Atlanta Falcons, surren
dered five sacks and generally failed to give Sten
strom enough time to throw.
After the opening loss, head coach Bill Walsh had
two weeks to prepare his team for its Pacific 10
Conference opener against the University of Ore
gon at Stanford Stadium. The extra week of prac
tice showed as the Cardinal improved in many areas
and handed the Ducks a 21-7 defeat.
Stenstrom and Milburn had big games for the
Cardinal. Stenstrom was 26 of 40 for a career-high
331 yards. Milburn brought all facets of his game to
bear on the Ducks, compiling 305 yards of total
offense. He rushed 13 times for 133 yards, caught
eight passes for 94 yards, and tallied 78 return
yards.
"Milburn is a marvel," Walsh said, reflecting the
sentiments of the 43,656 fans in attendance. The
highlight of Milburn's performance was a 68-yard
run where he exploded through a hole and raced up
the right side for a touchdown.
Starting his first collegiate game, freshman
placekicker Eric Abrams contributed two field goals
and was perfect in his debut.
Frank about his own performance as well as the
team's, Walsh saw the coaching as the biggest

improvement over the first game. Speaking of what
he calls "game management," Walsh admitted to
having a subpar performance in the Texas A&M
game and said of this game, "We managed this one
reasonably well."
This past Saturday, Stanford was expected to roll
over the Northwestern Wildcats, the traditional
roadkill of the Big-10. Favored by 35 points, the
Cardinal got a little more than they bargained for
but won easily, 35-24.
Many see the final score as an ominous note for
the future of the Cardinal this season. The game
was not nearly as close as the score would indicate
though, with long punt returns contributing to a
couple of second half scores after Stanford had
widened its lead to 35-10.
Walsh agrees. "We let them off the hook, obvi
ously," he said. "We got a little reckless with our
calls."
Sophomore Justin Armour, starting just his sec
ond game since making the switch from quarter
back to flanker, emerged as a key target for Sten
strom. He caught six passes lor 126 yards and a
touchdown.
Milburn collected 115 yards on just 19 carries.
His running complemented another solid effort
from Stenstrom, who threw for 297 yards on 21-of
-29 passing. The Northwestern secondary was just
so much Swiss cheese for Stenstrom, who had more
time to throw than he had received in the previous
two games.
"I felt better about our pass protection," Walsh
said. "As the season moves on they're going to play
up to their full potential."
The Wildcats demonstrated a lot of resolve, espe
cially given that their schedule has presented them
with the prospect of an 0-11 season. They managed
186 yards of rushing offense against the Cardinal,
which outdid either of Stanford's previous two
opponents.
Rushing defense and special teams play were
Stanford's clearest weaknesses, and must be
improved as Stanford heads into games against San
Jose State, Notre Dame and UCLA.
Cardinal players were critical of their own per
formance. "To be honest, they came to play and we
didn't," senior outside linebacker Ron George said.
"We can't afford to make mistakes on special
teams," linebacker Vince Otoupal said. "I think
we're all a little sobered."
After three games and a 2-1 record, sobered is
the best way to describe the Stanford Cardinal as it
heads into the heart of its season. This Saturday at
Stanford Stadium, look for everything to pull
together against the Spartans of San Jose State.
