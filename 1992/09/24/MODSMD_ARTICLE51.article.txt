# Frosh kicks away all doubt

### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
The morning is cool. On the other side of the
fence, the whistles, grunts and yells of a college
football team hard at work fill the air. On this field,
the only sound is foot meeting ball as kick after kick
sails through the uprights. The ritual is the same:

begin with the shortest distances, kicking from
both hash marks and everywhere in between.
For freshman placekicker Eric Abrams, the
world both at practice and in games is one of rela
tive isolation. Only on the field for a few seconds at
a time, his position requires a concentration and
precision that can influence the outcome of a game
dramatically.

Abrams grew up playing soccer and kicked field
goals for fun during halftime of his games. As he
grew older, his coaches saw that he had an excep
tional foot for his age and encouraged him to try
football.
Abrams attended La Jolla Country Day, a small,
private high school near San Diego that participat
ed in an eight-man football league. From any other
position, making the transition to major college
football would have been nearly impossible.
"For me it's the same," Abrams said of the
change from eight- to eleven-man football. "Kicking

is one position where you 're kind of isolated. All you
need is a good snapper and holder, and we have
that."
In high school, Abrams demonstrated a range
and consistency that is hard to find even in the col
legiate ranks. He twice made 53-yard field goals and
also set the national high school record for most
extra points in a career.
Unlike most positions, kickers aren't heavily
recruited. Abrams expressed interest in Stanford by
sending films of his kicks to the team.
When it came time to make the choice,
UCLA was the only hitch in his decision to
attend Stanford.
"At UCLA, you get more privileges as a
player than you do here," he said. "Plus I
would have played closer to home."
Abrams made the decision to come here
largely because of Stanford's academic rep
utation. Although currently undecided, he
plans to major in psychology. Instead of
enjoying plush off-campus housing, as
Bruin players reputedly receive, Abrams
will be living in Serra this year.
When this season began, Abrams was the
backup behind junior Aaron Mills. After the
team's first game against Texas A&M, in
which Mills missed his lone field goal
attempt, Abrams was named the starter.
When Abrams stepped in front of the Stanford
Stadium crowd of 43,656 for the Oregon
game, he was understandably nervous.
Kicking from the right hash mark,
Abrams nailed a 29-yard field goal to put
the Cardinal ahead, 3-0, with 4:38 remain
ing in the first quarter.
"In my mind, there's no such thing as a
chip shot. That first field goal was real

important to me," Abrams said. "After
that, I was as relaxed as could be."
Abrams continued his successful debut
by nailing a 38-yard attempt from the left
side on the last play of the half. He finished
the game with eight points: two field goals
and two extra points.
He appears to have the confidence that is
so crucial for a placekicker. He articulates
the philosophy of his craft with cold suc
cinctness. "When you're kicking you're out
there by yourself," he said, "it's 100 per
cent mental. If you don't miss in practice,
you shouldn't miss in the games."
This is not to say that Abrams is perfect.
The misses will inevitably come, as one did
against the Northwestern Wildcats last
Saturday. He missed a 50-yarder on a play
where the field goal unit was clearly rushed
because of indecision over whether the
offense should try for a first down.
"I wasn't exactly set," Abrams said.
"The clock was running down and I looked
at it and got kind of unsettled. The snap
and hold were perfect, though, and I still
should have been able to hit it."
Even a missed field goal couldn't ruin
the day, however, and the Cardinal won by
a 35-24 count. After the game, Abrams
walked out of the stadium with his parents,
signed a couple of autographs and looked
forward to his next chance to split the
uprights in front of the Stanford crowd.
