# Booters look past injuries, toward NCAA tournament
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Stanford women's soccer coach Berhane Ande
berhan built a top-10 program, but after seemg the
1992 squad hampered by a familiar curse, he is cau
tiously optimistic about the team's chances this
year.
After a 15-3-1 record in 1990 and a 17-2-0 mark
last year, No. 2 Stanford is poised to challenge for
national supremacy.
The Cardinal started out on the right foot with
victories against San Francisco State and Sonoma
State. The team recently wrapped up a two-game
East Coast road trip and hosts San Francisco today
at 4 p.m. and Washington on Sunday at 1 p.m.
However, several injuries have retarded the Car
dinal's progress. The "Curse of Jen" has returned,
bestowing injuries on several key Stanford players
named Jennifer. As was the case two years ago, Jen
Potok and Jen Gardiner have been sidelined.
Gardiner is recovering from two knee surgeries
and is suffering shin problems. Potok fractured her
nose when she and another player battled for the
ball and it squirted up and hit her in the face.
Sophomore Andrea Johnson, Stanford's third
leading scorer last season, is just beginning to work
her way back after spraining her knee.
"Since we've been slowed by injuries, we've had
to back off fitness and try to gradually build toward
maximum match fitness," Andeberhan said.
He added that his biggest concern was making up
for players lost at the end of last year, especially
sweeper Heather Mclntyre, who graduated. Kerry
Stivsdetti also graduated and Kristen Wair trans
ferred for financial reasons.
These holes will have to be filled by less experi
enced upperclassmen or freshmen. Sophomores
Laura Wilkes, Melinda Minstrell and junior Anita
Koshy will be counted on to pick up the slack. Ande
berhan hopes freshman Jessica Fischer, sweeper on
the Under-19 national team, can fill Mclntyre's
slot.
"Indue time she will probably be as good as

Heather but we've got to be patient with her," he
said.
Freshman Carmel Murphy has also nailed down
a starting spot, playing midfield along side 1991
Soccer America's Player of the Year Julie Foudy.
Dena Dey has also contributed in her Cardinal
debut, scoring three goals in the first three games.
The forward has shown a knack for the net which
pleases her coach, but he wants her to improve her
defense.
"She's been doubling in soccer and track so her
game needs a little polishing," Andeberhan said.
"She'll learn .. . and if she keeps scoring while
improving then that's all the better."
With several other talented recruits, Andeberhan
ranks this class even with those of the past few
years.
He called the pool of potential recruits (players
who not only were accepted but also wanted to
attend Stanford) "by far the best ever. Unbeliev
able." The group included two starting midfielders
on the Under-19 national team.
However, by the signing deadline Andeberhan
still did not have any scholarships to offer, although
he had been told repeatedly that women's soccer
was the next team in line for financial support.
Many of the top recruits took scholarships from
other schools.
Finally, in the spring of last year, Andeberhan
got his way and the Athletic Department gave the
program three scholarships for 1992, while also
agreeing to increase that amount by two over each
of the next two seasons. Stanford was the only
squad in the 1991 NCAA tourney that did not have
scholarships.
Now, with scholarships to boost an already solid
program, the present and future looks bright for the
Cardinal. In 1992, Stanford will gauge itself against
several top-10 teams, including the NCAA Champi
on North Carolina Tar Heels.
Three years ago, the Cardinal signaled its arrival
in the elite ranks of collegiate soccer with a scoreless

tie against the Tar Heels. A Stan
ford win in 1992 could herald the
end of North Carolina's domi
nance in the sport and complete a
full circle of sorts.
The star of the team then and
now is Foudy. The center mid
fielder is known for her speed,
accuracy and superior ball-han
dling skills. It isn't unusual to see
three or four defenders try to
swarm Foudy as she moves the
ball upfield. But with a couple of
feints and a burst of speed, Foudy
is on a breakaway or passing to an
open teammate.

'Since we've been
slowed by injuries,
we've had to back off
fitness...'

Unfortunately, because Foudy
starts for the U.S. women's
national team, she had to miss
the last few weeks of the season.
While she was in China helping
propel the U.S. to victory in the
first-ever women's World Cup,
Stanford was hosting Santa Clara
in the first round of the NCAA
Championships. The Cardinal
went on to fall just short of the
Final Four by losing to Colorado
College.
One of the stars late last sea
son was explosive junior Sarah
Rafanelli. The forward has led the
team in scoring the past two
years, racking up 16 goals and 8
assists in 1992 alone. Rafanelli
has proven both speedy and
durable in her three years on the
Farm. She was one of only four
players to start every game last
year.
Gaolkeeper Leslie Garrard is
another junior who mocked the
"sophomore slump" with a stellar
1991 campaign. She started every
game last year and allowed an
average of only one goal every
three games. Garrard notched 13
shutouts and will be hard-pressed
this fall to exceed that mark.
So far this year the young full
back corps has allowed Cardinal
opponents few shots on goal and
Garrard has smothered almost all
of them.

However, several injuries have retarded the Car
dinal's progress. The "Curse of Jen" has returned,
bestowing injuries on several key Stanford players
named Jennifer. As was the case two years ago, Jen
Potok and Jen Gardiner have been sidelined.
Gardiner is recovering from two knee surgeries
and is suffering shin problems. Potok fractured her
nose when she and another player battled for the
ball and it squirted up and hit her in the face.
Sophomore Andrea Johnson, Stanford's third
leading scorer last season, is just beginning to work
her way back after spraining her knee.
"Since we've been slowed by injuries, we've had
to back off fitness and try to gradually build toward
maximum match fitness," Andeberhan said.
He added that his biggest concern was making up
for players lost at the end of last year, especially
sweeper Heather Mclntyre, who graduated. Kerry
Stivsdetti also graduated and Kristen Wair trans
ferred for financial reasons.
These holes will have to be filled by less experi
enced upperclassmen or freshmen. Sophomores
Laura Wilkes, Melinda Minstrell and junior Anita
Koshy will be counted on to pick up the slack. Ande
berhan hopes freshman Jessica Fischer, sweeper on
the Under-19 national team, can fill Mclntyre's
slot.
"Indue time she will probably be as good as

Heather but we've got to be patient with her," he
said.
Freshman Carmel Murphy has also nailed down
a starting spot, playing midfield along side 1991
Soccer America's Player of the Year Julie Foudy.
Dena Dey has also contributed in her Cardinal
debut, scoring three goals in the first three games.
The forward has shown a knack for the net which
pleases her coach, but he wants her to improve her
defense.
"She's been doubling in soccer and track so her
game needs a little polishing," Andeberhan said.
"She'll learn .. . and if she keeps scoring while
improving then that's all the better."
With several other talented recruits, Andeberhan
ranks this class even with those of the past few
years.
He called the pool of potential recruits (players
who not only were accepted but also wanted to
attend Stanford) "by far the best ever. Unbeliev
able." The group included two starting midfielders
on the Under-19 national team.
However, by the signing deadline Andeberhan
still did not have any scholarships to offer, although
he had been told repeatedly that women's soccer
was the next team in line for financial support.
Many of the top recruits took scholarships from
other schools.
Finally, in the spring of last year, Andeberhan
got his way and the Athletic Department gave the
program three scholarships for 1992, while also
agreeing to increase that amount by two over each
of the next two seasons. Stanford was the only
squad in the 1991 NCAA tourney that did not have
scholarships.
Now, with scholarships to boost an already solid
program, the present and future looks bright for the
Cardinal. In 1992, Stanford will gauge itself against
several top-10 teams, including the NCAA Champi
on North Carolina Tar Heels.
Three years ago, the Cardinal signaled its arrival
in the elite ranks of collegiate soccer with a scoreless

tie against the Tar Heels. A Stan
ford win in 1992 could herald the
end of North Carolina's domi
nance in the sport and complete a
full circle of sorts.
The star of the team then and
now is Foudy. The center mid
fielder is known for her speed,
accuracy and superior ball-han
dling skills. It isn't unusual to see
three or four defenders try to
swarm Foudy as she moves the
ball upfield. But with a couple of
feints and a burst of speed, Foudy
is on a breakaway or passing to an
open teammate.

'Since we've been
slowed by injuries,
we've had to back off
fitness...'

Unfortunately, because Foudy
starts for the U.S. women's
national team, she had to miss
the last few weeks of the season.
While she was in China helping
propel the U.S. to victory in the
first-ever women's World Cup,
Stanford was hosting Santa Clara
in the first round of the NCAA
Championships. The Cardinal
went on to fall just short of the
Final Four by losing to Colorado
College.
One of the stars late last sea
son was explosive junior Sarah
Rafanelli. The forward has led the
team in scoring the past two
years, racking up 16 goals and 8
assists in 1992 alone. Rafanelli
has proven both speedy and
durable in her three years on the
Farm. She was one of only four
players to start every game last
year.
Gaolkeeper Leslie Garrard is
another junior who mocked the
"sophomore slump" with a stellar
1991 campaign. She started every
game last year and allowed an
average of only one goal every
three games. Garrard notched 13
shutouts and will be hard-pressed
this fall to exceed that mark.
So far this year the young full
back corps has allowed Cardinal
opponents few shots on goal and
Garrard has smothered almost all
of them.

Senior Molly Goodenbour, MVP of the 1992 Eurostars tournament, points Stanford to another victory
and a bright outlook for the season to come.
Stanford women's soccer coach Berhane Ande
berhan built a top-10 program, but after seemg the
1992 squad hampered by a familiar curse, he is cau
tiously optimistic about the team's chances this
year.
After a 15-3-1 record in 1990 and a 17-2-0 mark
last year, No. 2 Stanford is poised to challenge for
national supremacy.
The Cardinal started out on the right foot with
victories against San Francisco State and Sonoma
State. The team recently wrapped up a two-game
East Coast road trip and hosts San Francisco today
at 4 p.m. and Washington on Sunday at 1 p.m.
