Could this be the year?
After capping a spectacular 1991 regu
lar season by winning eight of its last 12
games and receiving its first NCAA Tour
nament bid since 1978, the Stanford
men's soccer team has set even higher
goals for 1992.

Head coach Colin Lindores enters his
third season on the Farm having
improved the squad immensely in his
first two, and with six of last season's top
seven scorers returning this campaign,
even more improvement is expected.
The Cardinal, the preseason favorite
in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion's eight-squad Mountain Division,
has already begun to build on last year's

successes. Stanford (4-2 this season) is
tied for the No. 20 slot in the latest
Gatorade/Intercollegiate Soccer Associa
tion of America Division I poll.
Lindores expects the Cardinal to make
an immediate impact in the MPSF: "If
we don't make it to the [MPSFI playoffs,"
said the coach, "than we will not have
had a successful season." The top two
squads in each of the MPSF's two divi

sions will qualify for the post-season
tournament.
The team opened its schedule in Col
orado Springs, Co. with wins over the
U.S. Air Force Academy and New Mexico.
In the UNLV Tournament held Septem
ber 11-12, Stanford dropped a 4-2 deci
sion to the host Rebels before rebounding
with a 3-1 win over sixth-ranked Wake
Forest.

Last week, the Cardinal opened its
home slate against Santa Clara, the
perennial western men's soccer power
house. The Broncos, NCAA co-champs in
1989 and national runners-up last sea
son, were ranked as high as seventh in
some 1992 preseason polls.
However, while Stanford returned 10
starters this year, Santa Clara lost
eight of 11 to graduation. Coming
into the game, the Broncos were
actually unranked, despite having
won their first two games of the
season.
After a scoreless first half, the
Cardinal opened it up in the sec
ond, netting three goals in a span of

15 minutes for a 3-0 victory. Senior
Kyle Krpata recorded his first
shutout of the season, tallying
three saves.
The victory marked Lindores's
first win over Santa Clara as head
coach on the Farm, and Stanford's
first men's soccer win over the
Broncos since 1985. "We're off to a
pretty darn good start," said the
coach. "When you beat a Santa
Clara, although they certainly
aren't as good as they were last
year, that says something."

Unfortunately, the inconsisten
cy that plagued the Cardinal at
times in 1991 has also been a factor
early this year. On Sunday, Stan
ford dropped a 2-0 decision to little
known Sacramento State, despite
outshooting the Hornets by a 28-8
margin.
Ail-Far West midfielder Jason
Vanacour has paced the Cardinal
tlfus far, scoring four goals, with
Talluto tallying three and sopho
more Ryan Collins netting two.
Carmen D'Onofrio and Chet Zim

mer, the lone Stanford freshmen
starters, have each made an imme
diate impact, while senior midfield
er Randy Mann was named Moun
tain Division Player of the Week
for his work against Air Force and
New Mexico.
The Cardinal travels to Moraga
this weekend to face Maryland-Bal
timore and Northern Illinois in the
St. Mary's Tournament. On Octo
ber 2, the Cardinal squares off
against George Washington at
home.
