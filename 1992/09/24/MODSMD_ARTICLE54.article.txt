# Women's hoops takes on Europe
## 
### Matthew Milliken Staff writer 
When the Stanford women's
basketball team was invited to the
1992 Eurostars Tourney, orga
nizers knew that the Cardinal
had recently won its second
NCAA championship. What they
didn't know was that Stanford
would return home having won
the European championship, too.
Head coach Tar a VanDerveer
and her team always seem to
excel in tournament situations,
and it was no different during
their 15-day trip to France this
summer.
The Eurostars Tourney, based
in Toulouse this year, is an annu
al eight-team competition
between championship profes
sional clubs. Stanford was the
first American team ever invited
to the five-year-old tournament
and was the only amateur club
present.
The Cardinal had a rough
beginning: after a long trip they
opened on August 28 with a 90-84
loss to Mirande, the 1990 champi
on of France and defending tour
nament champion.
Stanford then pasted
Starazagorra, the 1992 Bulgarian
champs, in a 102-74 win. In Stan
ford's next game, Kiev, the 1992
Ukrainian national champions,
handed the Americans an 87-60
loss.
Stanford's 1-2 record was good
enough for third place in pool play
and a quarterfinal berth. Stan
ford beat the Moscow Dynamo 84-
82 to set up a semifinal rematch
with Kiev, considered the tourna
ment's strongest team.
The Ukrainians had size as
well as talent. Their starting
front court was 6'7", 6'5" and
6'5", and three of their players
were on the gold medal-winning
team from the Barcelona games.
But the Cardinal was hungry for
revenge, as Kiev had handed
Stanford its biggest defeat in
recent memory.
"We'd been hearing a lot about
Kiev (from VanDerveer)," senior
Angela Taylor said. "We wanted

to play them again and show
them what we could do. At the
beginning of the game, they
didn't expect us to come out with
the power that we did."
Taylor also said that the
Ukrainian team was "a well
rounded team [with] a lot of fun
damentals ... You had to do every
thing right — you made a mistake
and they just jumped all over it."
But on Sept. 3, Stanford made
baskets, not mistakes. Star senior
center Val Whiting scored 18
points, while senior Molly Good
enbour tallied 14 at point guard.
Sophomores Anita Kaplan,

'You had to do every
thing right — you
made a mistake and
they just jumped all
over it.'

Rachel Hemmer and Kate Paye
each had 13. Whiting sank two
free throws to create a 73-73 tie
before time expired. Kaplan then
hit two free throws in overtime
for a decisive 79-77 lead, and
Hemmer scored two on a one
and-one.
Kiev was down, but hot out —
it took a 14-footer by Kaplan with
28 seconds to go, plus two more
Goodenbour free throws with five
seconds left, to cement the win.
The Ukrainians hit another
layup, but the game was Stan
ford's, 85-81.
Stanford was matched with
Challes, the 1992 French champi
ons, in the next day's final.
Challes had skillful inside scor
ing, talent at point guard and
greater experience, but Stanford
completed the tournament with a
96-85 win, a 4-2 record and the
1992 title.
The team then played two
exhibitions in five days in Paris,
which was a highlight of the trip
for most of the team. "I never
