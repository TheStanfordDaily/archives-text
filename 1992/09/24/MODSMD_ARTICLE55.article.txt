# No. 2 spikers set for Pac-10 action
##

Call it a case of picking up
where you left off.
The Stanford Cardinal
women's volleyball team, which
spent all 12 weeks of the 1991
regular season ranked No.l in
the nation and which finished
the year with a remarkable 30-2
overall record, has jumped out to
a quick start in 1992.
The second-ranked spikers are
6-0 in early-season play, includ
ing road victories over ranked
opponents that bode well for the
Cardinal as it guns for its first
NCAA title.
Stanford started its season
before Labor Day with a South
ern California swing. On Sept. 2,
the Cardinal trounced Loyola
Marymount 15-2, 15-4, 15-13 in
a match in which all 13 of its
players saw action.
Senior hitter Bev Oden, fresh
off of a summer of training with
the U.S. national team, led the
way with 12 kills, 10 digs, and
three blocks, while classmate
Jennifer Jackson added 10 kills
and five digs.
Two days later, the Cardinal,
then ranked fourth, pulled off a
moderate upset when it defeated
N0.2 Long Beach State. After
taking the first two games of the
match, 15-12 and 15-4, Stanford
had difficulty putting away the
'49ers, who took games three
and four 15-11 and 15-8 before
the Cardinal rallied to take game
five and the match 15-12. Four
Stanford players were in double
figures for kills, as Oden once
again paced the squad with 23
kills, nine digs and seven blocks

while Jackson added a career
high 18 kills and 10 digs.
The Cardinal followed up with
a couple of easy wins, as it
bounced unranked Santa Clara
and No. 13 Brigham Young by
identical 3-0 scores. In Santa
Clara on Sept. 8, Stanford came
up with an incredible 73 digs as it
swept the Broncos out of Toso
Pavilion 15-12, 15-11, 15-2.
Oden recorded 16 kills and nine
digs, while senior hitter Kristi
Paaso came up with 12 kills,
three aces, and a match-high 14
digs.
In Provo, Utah, a week later,
BYU fell victim to another Stan
ford shutout 15-11, 15-13, 15-13.
Jackson tied a career high with
18 kills to go along with 13 digs,
while Oden rang up 14 kills, 13
digs, and seven blocks.
Stanford then traveled to
Chicago for the Reebok Chal
lenge last weekend. As expected,
the Cardinal breezed through
the field, downing defending
Atlantic Coast Conference cham
pion Duke 15-7, 15-3, 15-11 in
their semifinal before surviving a
tougher match with fifth-ranked
Illinois 7-15, 8-15, 15-8, 15-6, 15-
13. Oden and Cary Wendell, a
freshman hitter-setter who hails
from Arroyo Grande, Calif., were
named to the all-tournament
team.
The Cardinal looks to keep its
momentum as it opens its Pacific
10 Conference season Friday and
Saturday with a road trip to take
on Oregon and Oregon State. A
lot more than pride will be on the
line as Stanford, which has not
lost a Pac-10 game since 1990,
looks to repeat its title of a year
ago.
