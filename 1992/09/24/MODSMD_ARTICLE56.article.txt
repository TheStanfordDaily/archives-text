Here you are. You made it.
And now that you have
adorable matching bedding
and towel sets, you too can be a
Stanford student. It's a great
school. Be thankful every day for
it... you could go to Cal.
Here at Stanford we have
majestic sandstone buildings,
Rhodes Scholars, Nobel Prize win
ners, and the best academics you
can find. But included in your
prize package, lucky contestant —
along with a lifetime supply of
Rice-o-Roni, the San Francisco
treat — is a little extra added
bonus: Athletics.
Our sports teams kick butt.
Five, count 'em, five national
championships last year. Not in
chess and bocci ball, mind you.
Our sports teams kick butt in big
sports: basketball, gymnastics,
swimming and tennis. Our sports
teams win. Our athletes go to the
Olympics. This is the big time.
And it is your job to bask in the
glory of it all. If you didn't order
that nifty savings package when
you got it in the mail, march your
self right down to White Plaza and
get your hot little hands on one of
those all-sports passes. It'll be
worth it. Trust me.
You wouldn't have made it
here if you couldn't handle the
academic load, so put your "anal
man" super-study-fiend alter ego
back in the closet until some lone
ly weekday night without any
sports comes around. It'll be
worth it. Our teams are good.
This is not like watching your
high school go head to head with
Our Sisters of the Immaculate
Conception in a grueling bad
minton match.
So get out there and start mem
orizing names like Bill Walsh.
That's B-I-L-L W-A-L-S-H, the
man who suddenly makes the pos
sibility of a Rose Bowl berth and

contention for a national football
championship in the next couple
years seem more realistic and less
like a bad drug trip.
Walsh is up there with the
other Stanford sports deities, and
if he lives up to the expectations of
the media and Stanford alumni,
who liken his return to the Farm
to the invention of the underwire
bra, the Kryptonite bike lock, and

the second coming of Christ, you
will see great things to come dur
ing your four or so years here on
the Farm.
Beware the hazards of academ
ic hysteria, and the seductive woo
of the singing sirens that are
Green and Meyer Libraries. Trade
in those cushy purple chairs for a
place in the stands. So you say aca
demics is why you came here?
We'll see. Your RA will tell you
there's a lot to learn outside of
class, so why not capitalize on one
of the best college athletics pro
grams ever?
You know you've become too
serious, or you're wearing your
jockeys one size too small, when
you miss a football game to catch
up on "The Book of the City of
Ladies." Study time is amorphous,
but sporting events are definite.
There is always time to study.
There is only one Big Game a year.
Keep your priorities straight, or
