# Club sports: chance for fame and glory
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
So, your days of high school athletic glory
are over. It seems like ages since you won, or
lost, the championship game in your local
district.
You packed away your letterman's jack
et, and chose not to attempt to make one of
Stanford's varsity teams because you were
burnt out, happy to be done with high
school, or just afraid of riding the pine in
Division I.
Never fear, brave soul, there is still hope.
Club sports, an assortment of different ath
letic disciplines, may be just what you need to
refocus the athlete in you and get back into
competition. Included under the heading of
"club sports" are various teams, all of which
work out regularly and represent Stanford on
local, regional and national levels.
Participants on these squads take their
sports very seriously, but the main differ
ence between club sports and varsity athlet
ics is that first-time players are more than
welcome on the club sports scene.
"It's serious stuff," said Shirley Schoof,
director of club sports. "But at the same
time it's for people who haven't played the
sports before. We encourage beginners."
Club sports provide the opportunity for
athletic students to perfect a favorite pas
time or try out a new sport, and in the pro
cess contribute to a legitimate program that
captures both the excitement of competition
and the camaraderie of team play.
Students can choose from specialized
sports such as polo, equestrian events and
squash, or participate in more everyday
sports like bowling and running.
Club sport status is often merely a reflec

tion of the relative popularity of certain
sports here on the West Coast and in the
Bay Area.
Lacrosse, for example, is virtually nonex
istent in high school athletics in California,
while enjoying popularity on the East ('oast.
The sport flourishes here at Stanford, how
ever, under the category of club sports.
Badminton, cricket, judo, racquetball,
men's and women's rugby, and women's
water polo are only a few of the sports that
are looking for new talent.
Teams such as Ultimate frisbee, synchro
nized swimming, cycling and ice hockey are
frequently vying for national and regional
championships, reflecting the serious
nature of their commitment to their sports.
Team members put in hours of practice
each week, in the off-season as well as dur
ing competitive periods. Although they do
not benefit from varsity standing, club sport
programs provide a serious forum for ath
letic competition, as well as fun.
The Cycling Club, for example, invites all
students to come out and ride in the after
noons. The club has around 100 members of
all different levels, as well as a racing team
of 30 students who compete from February
through May. Daily workouts vary from
easy rides such as the "loop," a 12-mile
route in Palo Alto, to 70-100 mile endurance
rides. This is typical of the varied abilities
featured in the different clubs, providing the
opportunity for all members to improve
their individual skills.
Students should contact the club sports
office or look for tables in White Plaza
staffed with team representatives during
the first few weeks of school. Some sports
are also included in the time schedule and
units can even be earned for participation.

While mud volleyball is not a club or intramural sport offered at Stanford, students should not be afraid to get down and
dirty with the many non-varsity options available to them.
