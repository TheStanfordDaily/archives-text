# Inner-tube water polo wakes even ardent IM lovers
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
The second greatest joy at Stanford has
to be pounding on the door to George
Shultz's office in Hoover Tower and ask
ing him where he got the idea "for that
Woodstock character."
The first, of course, is intramural
sports.
"But what exactly are intramurals?"
vou ask in that curious, vet oddly attrac

tive naivete which reeks all-too-strongly
of malleable freshman.
No, IMs (as the hipsters call it) are not
just neat ways to impress your new
friends. Nor are they simply a way to see
what members of the opposite sex look
like when they sweat. Intramurals are a
lot more than that.
Since most of us have neither the time,
the talent nor the scholarship to play col
legiate level athletics, intramurals serve
as a way to promote the scholar-athlete

myth that dominates Stanford.
Aggression runs high after several
months of sexual repression, so best to
wear pads and a thick bra when taking on
other dorms and sundry organizations in
sports like co-ed football and basketball.
YVrestling, handball, tennis and a slew —
yes, a slew — of other opportunities await
your new dormitory for more bonding
than you could ever have hoped.
And what better way to fully enjoy a
hangover than to awaken early on a Sunday

morning and head down to deGuerre pool
for a good game of inner-tube water polo.
You almost don't feel the rubber burns.
So don't be afraid of being mocked for
your lack of athletic ability; your fragile
self-identity will be so demolished by your
numerous attempts to fulfill DR 6 that a
little light ribbing won't make a differ
ence. Get on out there and show your new
best friends exactly what you're made of
— that you're not just some flaccid intel
lectual, but a real man, with bones and

sinew and an eye-hand coordination
developed through years of slaving over
computer games.
Put on your dancing shoes and bother
the RAin charge of these things. After all,
they're getting paid.
Have a great time, smile often, and
don't forget to learn them Branner kids a
lesson or two. After all, even George
Shultz enjoys throwing a good stiff-arm
every so often. Especially when it involves
that pesky Lawrence Walsh.
