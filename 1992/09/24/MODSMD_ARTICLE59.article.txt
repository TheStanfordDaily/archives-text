# Positive outlook for 1992 runners
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
College athletics are not all
fun and games, but new Stanford
cross country and track head
coach Vin Lananna wishes it
could be more so.
After turning around Dart
mouth's running programs, high
lighted by their men's team's sec
ond-place finish in the 1990
national cross country champi
onships, Lananna was persuaded
to come to the Farm to fill the
spot vacated by long-time head
coach Brooks Johnson.
Although he was pleased with
his success at Dartmouth, and
was not looking to leave the Big
Green, Lananna had always had a
soft spot for Stanford, and accept
ed the athletic department's invi
tation to start this fall.
"(Stanford head coach) is the
one position in the country that
I've always been interested in,"
Lananna said. "Stanford not only
has great academics, but also the
desire to have great athletics . . .
academic integrity and at the
same time athletic success at a
high level."
Lananna takes over a running
program that has struggled in
recent years, hitting upon tough
times in the Pacific 10 Conference
and Western Region 8 champi
onships. The Cardinal has been
plagued by injuries in the past
and has suffered from a lack of
experience, losing many runners
after their first or second seasons.
Lananna now hopes to build
confidence among the men's and
women's squads, which he feels
are reasonably young and lack
big-meet exposure.
"One of the things we can
achieve right off is making the
athletes believe in the program,"
Lananna said. To reach that goal,
he has prepared a four-step plan
which, when in effect, should
help Stanford's cross country and
track programs recruit, enabling
them to be considered seriously
by big-name high school athletes.
In order to revamp the Cardi
nal's image, Lananna first plans

to bring a new level of excitement
and enthusiasm to current mem
bers of the Stanford teams by giv
ing them a program in which they
can take pride.
Next he would like to see a pro
fessional and dignified relation
ship develop between runners
and coaches, and to use staff
expertise in a positive way to ben
efit the students.
His last two goals lie in the
administrative sector, including a
staff effort to improve the
recruiting drive made by Stan
ford track and cross country, as
well as focusing on developing
alumni support and creating a
network of former Cardinal ath
letes.
Right now, Lananna is creat
ing a positive atmosphere in
workouts and coach-athlete rela
tions, focusing on the fun side of
running. He is working on setting
attainable goals for his squads
this season in order to encourage
a winning attitude.
"This year everybody starts
with a clean slate," Lananna said.
"Working with intelligent women
and men, there needs to be proof
for the athletes that they can
have the confidence in me to
identify reasonable goals. Stan
ford's results, recently, haven't
been all that great, but once it
gets rolling, the momentum will
be self-perpetuating. My goal is to
jump-start the team, to get it
moving."
The two cross country squads
came back to campus a few weeks
early this fall to get on the right
track and build a strong future
for Stanford running. The Cardi
nal's first competition will be
held on Sept. 26, marking the
start of Lananna's planned pro
gression toward national legiti
macy.
Leading the men's side will be
senior Gary Stolz, successful last
season in track and cross country
on the regional level. Stolz,
according to Lananna, has the
sort of big-race experience the
Cardinal team needs, and hope
fully as captain will lend his
expertise to his teammates.

Three-fourths of last year's
men's squad were in their final
year of eligibility, leaving Stan
ford in a position to rebuild this
season.
On the women's side, junior
captain Sarah Truitt will lead the
Cardinal, and will be joined by
sophomores Jeannie Rothman
and Melissa Freeburg, who were
both high school standouts. The
women are also joined by a few
good recruits, including Louise
Watson, a transfer student from
Great Britain who will give the
Stanford squad definite potential
in conference competition.
"I think the women's team
could be the sleeper of the Pac-10
conference," Lananna speculated.
For now, however, Lananna is

concentrating less on statistics
and more on attitude. He believes
in a regimen free of extremes,
choosing either high-mileage or
high-intensity workouts, but
never both at the same time.
"Coaching is a balance
between science and art," Lanan
na said. "You help the athletes to
be physically prepared to compete
at an event, but the real art is
helping those students live up to
their potential. If you are confi
dent, strong and positive, you'll
perform well."
In his first year on the Farm,
Lananna will be brushing up on
his artwork, building morale and
confidence and laying the founda
tion for a new Stanford running
legacy.
