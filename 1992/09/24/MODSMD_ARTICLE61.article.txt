## MOVIES Paper fights on Sunday nights: fun fall Flicks 
### 
Every Sunday evening at 7 and 10 p.m.,
droves of Stanford students descend upon
Memorial Auditorium armed with restless en
ergy and back packs loaded down with the pre
vious week's junk mail, newspapers and dorm
flyers.
No, the auditorium — commonly known as
Mem Aud — is not a campus recycling drop
off point. It's the home of Sunday Flicks, a
weekly film exhibition sponsored by the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford University.
Since 1937, the Stanford campus and sur
rounding community have enjoyed the pre
sentation of previously released movies at a
fraction of the cost for normal theater atten
dance. It continues to be one of the ASSU's
most profitable business projects, never failing
to draw large crowds.
Almost as important as the films them
selves, however, are the paper fights associated
with the weekly event. If you decide to attend,
you better bring your paper, or else you'll be
defenseless during the paper fights (especially
at the 10 p.m. show). And don't forget your
Flicks pass or your cash, because the ASSU
doesn't take American Express.
As in recent years, this quarter's line-up of
new and not-so-new films offer the finicky
viewer everything from biting satire to
numbing action. Regardles of your cinematic
preferences, you'll find something to your
liking.
"Basic Instinct": Oct. 4. See Michael Dou
glas in the role of his life: a sex-crazed, loner
type coping with depression. There are also a
couple of witty lines.
"Sister Act": Oct. 11. Whoopi Goldberg is a
lounge lizard turned nun on the run from the
mob. With any other actress as lead, this odd

ball comedy would have crashed and burned.
"Raiders of the Lost Ark": Oct. 18. A pistol,
a bull whip and a tattered safari hat — need I
say more? You'll want to come just to whistle
that catchy theme.
"The Player": Oct. 19 (Mon). The only film
with a Hollywood ending that purposely
makes fun of the classic Hollywood ending.
Even with its faults, director Robert Altman's
parody of "Tinsel Town" filmmaking is noth
ing to laugh at.
"Halloween": Oct. 25 The Sado-Masochist

Club's orientation film for late fall recruits.
"Patriot Games": Nov. 1, The explosive se
quel to "The Hunt for Red October." Harrison
Ford plays an ex-CIA analyst who gets sucked
back into "the Company" when his "family
values" are compromised.
"Far and Away": Nov. 8. The soundtrack is
pleasant, but will Ron "Opey/Ritchie Cun
nigham" Howard score another wholesome
Flicks hit?
"Empire of the Sun": Nov. 15. An epic style
drama... missed it in the theaters.
"Batman Returns": Nov. 22. The second in
stallment of director Tim Burton's visually
stimulating nightmare.
"Housesitter": Nov. 23 (Mon). Your guess
is as good as mine — and probably as cynical.
"White Men Can't Jump": Nov. 29. Woody
Haroldson and Wesley Snipes grunt on the
court for approximately 90 minutes.
"Die Hard": Dec. 6. Bruce Willis is a Mar
ried White Male hero — sounds familiar
doesn't it?
"A League of Their Own": Dec. 13. Yes,
Madonna can act, and Penny Marshall isn't a
bad director either.
In addition to the above films, ASSU Flicks
will present a sneak preview of "Hero," the
soon to be released Dustin Hoffman film,
sometime during the quarter.
And for all of you students who prefer a lit
tle movie with your Friday night party, ASSU

also sponsors "Friday Classic Flicks, 10 films
that you may or may not remember, but are
sure to enjoy:
"Romancing the Stone": Oct. 2. Yes, anoth
er presentation of the classic Douglas, Turner
and DeVito collaboration.
"Rattle and Hum": Oct. 9. This U2 flick will
play "With or Without You."
"To Kill a Mocking Bird": Oct. 16. One of
Gregory Peck's most memorable perfor
mances.
"Children of a Lesser God": Oct 23. I paid

to see that one, but didn't watch or listen to it.
"Lost Boys": Oct. 30. This cult classic was
filmed practically in Stanford's back yard —
Santa Cruz, Calif.
"Fletch" Nov. 6: It's got a great theme song,
and Chevy Chase is always funny. Always.
"Friday the 13th": Nov. 13. If I were you, I'd
pack garlic — or something — in my bag for
this one.
"All the President's Men": Oct. 20. Dustin
Hoffman's rather popular this quarter isn't he?
"Roxanne": Dec. 4. Based loosely on "Cyra
no de Bergerac," Steve Martin is the man be
hind the nose.
"A Christmas Story": Dec. 11. Starring the
pre-"Wonder Years" Fred Savage, it's a warm
and fuzzy way to end fall quarter.
So what are you waiting for, 102 nd matric
ulating class of Leland Stanford Jr. University?
Get out there, throw some paper and squander
valuable Sunday night study time!

also sponsors "Friday Classic Flicks, 10 films
that you may or may not remember, but are
sure to enjoy:
"Romancing the Stone": Oct. 2. Yes, anoth
er presentation of the classic Douglas, Turner
and DeVito collaboration.
"Rattle and Hum": Oct. 9. This U2 flick will
play "With or Without You."
"To Kill a Mocking Bird": Oct. 16. One of
Gregory Peck's most memorable perfor
mances.
"Children of a Lesser God": Oct 23. I paid

to see that one, but didn't watch or listen to it.
"Lost Boys": Oct. 30. This cult classic was
filmed practically in Stanford's back yard —
Santa Cruz, Calif.
"Fletch" Nov. 6: It's got a great theme song,
and Chevy Chase is always funny. Always.
"Friday the 13th": Nov. 13. If I were you, I'd
pack garlic — or something — in my bag for
this one.
"All the President's Men": Oct. 20. Dustin
Hoffman's rather popular this quarter isn't he?
"Roxanne": Dec. 4. Based loosely on "Cyra
no de Bergerac," Steve Martin is the man be
hind the nose.
"A Christmas Story": Dec. 11. Starring the
pre-"Wonder Years" Fred Savage, it's a warm
and fuzzy way to end fall quarter.
So what are you waiting for, 102 nd matric
ulating class of Leland Stanford Jr. University?
Get out there, throw some paper and squander
valuable Sunday night study time!

Crumple your paper and grab your pass, 'cause it's time for Sunday Flicks. Clockwise
from center, "A League of Their Own," "Die Hard II," "Batman Returns" and "Patriot
Games."


Every Sunday evening at 7 and 10 p.m.,
droves of Stanford students descend upon
Memorial Auditorium armed with restless en
ergy and back packs loaded down with the pre
vious week's junk mail, newspapers and dorm
flyers.
No, the auditorium — commonly known as
Mem Aud — is not a campus recycling drop
off point. It's the home of Sunday Flicks, a
weekly film exhibition sponsored by the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford University.
Since 1937, the Stanford campus and sur
rounding community have enjoyed the pre
sentation of previously released movies at a
fraction of the cost for normal theater atten
dance. It continues to be one of the ASSU's
most profitable business projects, never failing
to draw large crowds.
Almost as important as the films them
selves, however, are the paper fights associated
with the weekly event. If you decide to attend,
you better bring your paper, or else you'll be
defenseless during the paper fights (especially
at the 10 p.m. show). And don't forget your
Flicks pass or your cash, because the ASSU
doesn't take American Express.
As in recent years, this quarter's line-up of
new and not-so-new films offer the finicky
viewer everything from biting satire to
numbing action. Regardles of your cinematic
preferences, you'll find something to your
liking.
"Basic Instinct": Oct. 4. See Michael Dou
glas in the role of his life: a sex-crazed, loner
type coping with depression. There are also a
couple of witty lines.
"Sister Act": Oct. 11. Whoopi Goldberg is a
lounge lizard turned nun on the run from the
mob. With any other actress as lead, this odd

ball comedy would have crashed and burned.
"Raiders of the Lost Ark": Oct. 18. A pistol,
a bull whip and a tattered safari hat — need I
say more? You'll want to come just to whistle
that catchy theme.
"The Player": Oct. 19 (Mon). The only film
with a Hollywood ending that purposely
makes fun of the classic Hollywood ending.
Even with its faults, director Robert Altman's
parody of "Tinsel Town" filmmaking is noth
ing to laugh at.
"Halloween": Oct. 25 The Sado-Masochist

Club's orientation film for late fall recruits.
"Patriot Games": Nov. 1, The explosive se
quel to "The Hunt for Red October." Harrison
Ford plays an ex-CIA analyst who gets sucked
back into "the Company" when his "family
values" are compromised.
"Far and Away": Nov. 8. The soundtrack is
pleasant, but will Ron "Opey/Ritchie Cun
nigham" Howard score another wholesome
Flicks hit?
"Empire of the Sun": Nov. 15. An epic style
drama... missed it in the theaters.
"Batman Returns": Nov. 22. The second in
stallment of director Tim Burton's visually
stimulating nightmare.
"Housesitter": Nov. 23 (Mon). Your guess
is as good as mine — and probably as cynical.
"White Men Can't Jump": Nov. 29. Woody
Haroldson and Wesley Snipes grunt on the
court for approximately 90 minutes.
"Die Hard": Dec. 6. Bruce Willis is a Mar
ried White Male hero — sounds familiar
doesn't it?
"A League of Their Own": Dec. 13. Yes,
Madonna can act, and Penny Marshall isn't a
bad director either.
In addition to the above films, ASSU Flicks
will present a sneak preview of "Hero," the
soon to be released Dustin Hoffman film,
sometime during the quarter.
