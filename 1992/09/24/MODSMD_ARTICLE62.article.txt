## Off the beaten track: nonconformist films make their mark 
### 
If you're waiting for the release of "Termina
tor III," don't bother looking at the five local
Landmark Theaters.
Instead of movies with recycled plots and
over-inflated budgets, Landmark presents bit
ing documentaries. In the past, the cinema has
shown the Academy Award-winning "Ameri
can Dream," which depicts union trouble at the
Hormel meat packing plant. They also present a
number of foreign films, which have included
films like "Cabeza de Vaca," a Mexican movie
set during the Spanish conquest tracking the ex
periences of conquistador Cabeza de Vaca.
Landmark Theaters in Palo Alto include the
Varsity at 456 University Avenue, the Aquarius
at 430 Emerson Street and the Palo Alto Square
at 3000 El Camino Real. Menlo Park offers the
Park at 1275 El Camino Real and the Guild at
949 El Camino Real. All these theaters offer
"something you're not going to find at a Centu
ry 10," according to Landmark manager Chris
Kosley.
Kosley said the typical Landmark audience
consists of people who have a strong interest in
film as an artistic medium. "I think people come
to our theater knowing that they're going to see
films that aren't the norm," he said.
Originally formed from two different com
panies, Landmark began as a repertory film the
ater showing several movies regularly or in al
ternate sequence. Offerings included cult, for
eign and classic films from the '30s and '40s.
Until the video age, repertory theaters were

popular. Video "wiped out the rep market by
and large," Kosley said.
Yet Landmark was able to revitalize their
market by running noteworthy films like the re
cent release, "Gas Food Lodging," which Kosley
describes as a controversial female coming-of
age film.
To promote smaller independent films simi
lar to "Gas Food Lodging," Landmark invites
targeted audiences to see free preview screen
ings. This process was used to promote "A Brief
History of Time," a documentary about the life
and works of physicist Stephen Hawkins, who
suffers from Lou Gherig's disease.
Kosley tapped into computers across Silicon
Valley to announce special screenings of the
film. He said word of mouth was "a very effec
tive way of generating publicity."
When Landmark plans to show a film that
might appeal to high school English, history or
science classes, they send invitations for a free
preview screening to local teachers. Arrange
ments can then be made for the school to rent
the theater.
"I would love to see more [Stanford] stu
dents come over and watch," Kosley said,
adding that many Stanford students don't even
know the Landmark Theaters exist. "I think
they'd be impressed."
Elaborating affectionately on the architec
tural distinctions between the five theaters,
Kosley said, "The Guild has an intimate feel
when you walk in. It has a very tiny lobby and
concession stand."
The Park, which is much larger, has an art
deco feel to it, Kosley said, and the Varsity has a
long column-lined entry way and a Spanish
motif. All five theaters have their own character,
Kosley continued. "Each one is unique."
