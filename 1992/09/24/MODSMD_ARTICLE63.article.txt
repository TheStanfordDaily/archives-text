# Life off the fastlane: three women get by in a truck stop town
## 
### 
In Laramie, New Mexico, truckers stop
for gas, food, lodging and love. Allison An
ders' new film based on Richard Peck's
novel "Don't Look and It Won't Hurt," cap
tures the feeling of Small Town U.S.A.,
where people breeze by like tumbleweeds
and life sometimes seems as harsh as the
desert sun.
The small-budget movie, which opened
last Thursday at the

Aquarius Cinemas in
Palo Alto, masterfully
portrays the wants
and needs of three
women in various
stages of maturity.
Nora (Brooke Adams)
has been left stranded
with her two daugh
ters — with nothing
but a trailer and a
waitressing job.
Adams deftly por
trays Nora's resigna-

tion to the limitations of life. Aware that she is
no perfect role model, she tries to raise her
daughters with the values she sees fit. She de
clines men's offers for fear of setting a bad ex
ample for her daughters, until Shade (Fairuza
Balk) accuses her of hating men.
When Nora warns her older daughter
Trudi (loneSkye) against having a baby out of
wedlock, Trudi accuses her of regretting the
birth of her own baby girls. Everything Nora
does in the interest of mothering backfires.
Trudi too, has a hard row to tow. Con
stantly trampled upon by men, physical love
is the only kind that she knows how to get,
though she always ends up hurt. She lets down
her shield of callous spitefulness only with
great hesitation when Dank (Robert Knep
per), a British rock-quarrier with a passion for

nature, teaches her not only to trust, but also
to find beauty where she has never found it
before. But Dank is too good to be true, and
Trudi's happiness is short-lived. Skye plays
the shrew-like Trudi with just the right hint of
inner sweetness. Her smile is as catchy as her
acting.
Even young Shade, whose wide-open eyes
suggest her willingness to believe in the good
ness of life, has hardships of her own. As she
narrates her story with compelling sincerity,
her own awareness of the contrasts between
her life and the ones she sees in the movies be
come poignantly apparent.
As well as yearning for a father figure and a
peaceful family life, Shade struggles with her

conflicting feelings for a
Mexican boy named
Javier (Jacob Vargas)
that her friends call a
"cholo." She tries to pin
her affections on Darius
(Donovan Leitch), an
eccentric Olivia Newton
John worshipper,
though it is Javier who
makes her feel worthy.
Eventually all
three women find what
they need, in some form
or another. Shade gives

in to Javier. "In his arms I knew I was Shade,
just Shade, and that was more than enough,"
she says, though she still has the objections of
the whole town to face.
T rudi learns what real love feels like, if only
for a day. Even Nora finds an unlikely lover in
her laughable neighbor Hamlet Humphrey
(David Lansbury), though a husband will al
ways elude her.
"Gas, Food Lodging" is brutally honest, an
account of the survival of the fittest. Nora,
Trudi and Shade are all victims of circum
stance. Their fates are like the dust of the
desert — unpredictable. The film glorifies
nothing but those chance occasions when the
wind blows the right way, and the power of
the human will to thrive under adversity.
