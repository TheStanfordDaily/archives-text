## MUSIC Old meets new and East meets West in music off Zhang Yan 
### 
This Saturday at Foothill College, China's
treasured musician Zhang Yan will be playing
ancient Chinese melodies in a modern manner
— on a double zheng, an instrument that she
developed herself.
Zhang Yan has toured the world with her
music. After soloing with the Shanghai Opera
House and teaching at Chinese music conser
vatories, she immigrated to the United States in
1983, where she has soloed at the Metropolitan
Opera, Davies Symphony Hall and Herbst The
atre.
Yan has performed for over 20 heads of
state, including President Nixon and the lead
ers of Pakistan, Algeria, Venezuela, the Philip
pines and more. She has also lectured and per
formed at universities throughout the United
States.
The zheng, which looks like a horizontal
harp, has existed since the first Chinese dynas
ties. It is as popular in Taiwan and other parts
of Asia as the piano is in the United States. Only
in the 1980s, however, did Zhang Yan expand
the instrument's potential by creating a double
zheng, which consists of two zhengs set togeth

er at a 45 degree angle.
The double zheng has more strings than the
standard zheng, as well as foot pedals adapted
from the piano. Both of these features increase
its musical range.
With ancient origins embellished by West
ern innovations, the instrument is a union of
Eastern and Western techniques. By the same
token, it combines the western diatonic and

eastern pentatonic scales.
The diatonic scale is the standard western
seven-tone scale that 'includes two semitones
and sounds like the typical "do re mi" se
quence. The pentatonic scale used in eastern
music has five of these seven tones; it lacks the
fourth and the seventh tones of the diatonic
scale —the "fa" and the "ti."
The double zheng consists of a 28-note dia
tonic zheng joined with a 25-note pentatonic
zheng, and the result is a more complex musi
cal range, a blend of East and West.
The program at Foothill will feature
melodies from various dynasties and

provinces, as well as the world premieres of in
ternational string players and local Chinese
celebrity Jon Jang. Tickets cost $12, $20, and
$25 — half-price with Stanford ID — and will
be available at the door.
