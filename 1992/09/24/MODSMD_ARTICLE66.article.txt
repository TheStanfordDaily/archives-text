# DANCE
## Get moving in a new direction with Stanford dance 
### 
The Stanford Dance Division offers a wealth
of opportunities this quarter. Former Stanford
student Martin Keogh will guest-teach this
year's Dance Heritage class in contact improvi
sation. Dance Heritage features a different
technique each fall taught by an expert in the
field. Past techniques have included those of
Isadora Duncan, Merce Cunningham and
Lester Horton.
Contact improvisation started in the early
1970s as an exploration of spontaneous inter
active possibilities between two or more peo
ple. Bodies are connected by any point of phys
ical contact, and the movement evolves natu
rally from finding and losing balance, and tak
ing and giving weight. Keogh explains, "a lot of

this technique is taught with games and aware
ness exercises."
There are no preordained "steps," as bodies
roll, fall, fly and swing through space, relying
on gravity, mutual support and sensitivity. Ac
cording to Keogh, contact improvisation is "ul
timately about being present. Not only with
physical forces, but with being in relation to
someone else." Indeed, contact improvisation
"reflects how someone acts in one's social rela
tions with others."
Keogh credits his time at Stanford as an un
dergraduate in Drama (1976-77), and especial
ly his time in Columbae, with "opening his
mind to a form of dance like this one." A talent
for the arts must be in his genes as well, for his
parents danced with the National Ballet of
Canada, and his grandparents were profession
al puppeteers.
During his sophomore year Keogh left Stan
ford to hitchhike around the world, traveling
25,000 miles in 18 months. "I got my education
on the road in the process," he says.
When Keogh discovered contact improvisa
tion in 1980, it was like "walking into my own
house. I knew exactly where the furniture was."
Within a year he was teaching and performing
the art, working with pioneers Steve Paxton
and Nancy Stark-Smith, and also collaborating
with a San Francisco group, the Mangrove
Dance Collective.
For the past 12 years, Keogh has been per
forming and teaching throughout the United
