# DANCE
## Get moving in a new direction with Stanford dance 
### 
The Stanford Dance Division offers a wealth
of opportunities this quarter. Former Stanford
student Martin Keogh will guest-teach this
year's Dance Heritage class in contact improvi
sation. Dance Heritage features a different
technique each fall taught by an expert in the
field. Past techniques have included those of
Isadora Duncan, Merce Cunningham and
Lester Horton.
Contact improvisation started in the early
1970s as an exploration of spontaneous inter
active possibilities between two or more peo
ple. Bodies are connected by any point of phys
ical contact, and the movement evolves natu
rally from finding and losing balance, and tak
ing and giving weight. Keogh explains, "a lot of

this technique is taught with games and aware
ness exercises."
There are no preordained "steps," as bodies
roll, fall, fly and swing through space, relying
on gravity, mutual support and sensitivity. Ac
cording to Keogh, contact improvisation is "ul
timately about being present. Not only with
physical forces, but with being in relation to
someone else." Indeed, contact improvisation
"reflects how someone acts in one's social rela
tions with others."
Keogh credits his time at Stanford as an un
dergraduate in Drama (1976-77), and especial
ly his time in Columbae, with "opening his
mind to a form of dance like this one." A talent
for the arts must be in his genes as well, for his
parents danced with the National Ballet of
Canada, and his grandparents were profession
al puppeteers.
During his sophomore year Keogh left Stan
ford to hitchhike around the world, traveling
25,000 miles in 18 months. "I got my education
on the road in the process," he says.
When Keogh discovered contact improvisa
tion in 1980, it was like "walking into my own
house. I knew exactly where the furniture was."
Within a year he was teaching and performing
the art, working with pioneers Steve Paxton
and Nancy Stark-Smith, and also collaborating
with a San Francisco group, the Mangrove
Dance Collective.
For the past 12 years, Keogh has been per
forming and teaching throughout the United
States and Canada. In 1986, Keogh
taught an introductory workshop at
Stanford on gender roles and dance
entitled "The Role of Art in Politics."
Keogh said he is "extremely hon
ored" to be given the opportunity to
teach again this year.
Keogh and a partner will perform
a free demonstration and discussion
entitled "Engaging Thresholds: Tak
ing Contact Improvisation to the
Edge," on Monday, Nov. 2, 7-8:30
p.m., in Roble Gym. They will ex
plore risk-taking in contact improvi
sation, as each dancer seeks his or her
"edge," or limit, just shy of danger.
Other course offerings include a
performance workshop co-orga
nized by faculty members Tony
Morris-Kramer and Diane Frank, in
which students will choreograph and
perform original work; Dance Forms
of Latin America, taught by Susan
Cashion, chairwoman of the Dance
Division and director of Ballet Folk
lorico de Stanford; and Social Dance
Forms, taught by guest faculty mem
ber (and Stanford alumnus) Richard
Powers.
Powers, a vintage dance expert, is
on leave from the University of
Cincinnati. Vintage dance recon
structs past social dance forms in a

historically accurate way.
Powers will also direct this year's
Ragtime Ball (Oct. 24,8 p.m. to mid
night at Roble Gym). The theme of
this year's popular annual fund-rais
er is the sinking of the Titanic. The
dances of that era (circa 1912) will
contribute to an atmosphere of ele
gance aboard the doomed ship.
On Oct. 2, the Dance Division
joins the other arts at Stanford in a
special welcoming performance for
incoming Stanford President Ger
hard Casper. This free event takes
place in the Inner Quad, 10 a.m. to
noon, shortly after Casper is sworn
in at Frost Amphitheater.
On Nov. 6, Peter Sellars, the
young and highly touted theater,
opera and film director from Los An -
geles, will visit Stanford. This event is
co-sponsored by the Dance Division,
the Drama and Music Departments,
and the Humanities Center.
Sellars comes to the Bay Area to
direct the controversial opera "The
Death of KlinghofFer" for the San
Francisco Opera. Sellars will conduct
a graduate-level class for selected
students in dance, drama and music.
Also, an open lecture and demon
stration (7:30-9 p.m. in Roble Gym)
will explore the creation of sponta
neous radical theater.
For more information on any of
these events, contact the Dance Divi
sion at 723-1234.
