## FOOD Ma's meatloaf, Thai iced tea: Stanford snacks 
### 
For those of you already begin
ning to wax nostalgic over Mom's in
comparable meatloaf, we have pro
vided here a description of your on
campus eating options.
Replacing "Mom" for most of you
will be a provider, known as Stanford
Food Service, who may be somewhat
less compassionate but will never ask
you if you've met a nice boy or girl
yet.
Look no further than Wilbur Hall
for the worst Food Service meals at
Stanford. As if their living quarters
weren't punishment enough,Wilbu
rites consistently get the poorest
dishes and most repetition.
The Wilbur Food Service hierar
chy has traditionally placed a dis
maying emphasis on dishes like
"black bean chili" and the always
murky "beef stroganoff."
The all-you-can-eat format is of
little consolation here; it can even
make your stomach turn if someone
sitting at your table takes a real liking
to the "oat burgers" or "Chinese pot
stickers," a common Wilbur dish of
questionable ethnic authenticity.
Wilbur residents' saving grace is
their truly tasty freshly baked bread
which is envied by the rest of campus.
Residents of Branner Hall, Flo
rence Moore Hall, Lagunita Court
and Roble Hall all receive upgraded
versions of the Wilbur fare.
In addition to the (slightly) better
food, these residents eat their meals
in a much more palatable atmos

phere. Branner's vaulted ceilings and
Lagunita's wooden-rustic theme do
an admirable job of easing the Food
Service pain.
Residents in Stern Hall, Kimball
Hall, Sterling Quad and Manzanita II
will experience a new, improved side
of Food Service known as the "point
system."
Students are charged "points" —
Food Service's cute way of saying
"money" — for each item they take.
This system has apparently cut down
on waste and allowed Food Service to
improve the quality of their entrees.
In a humane gesture, many of
these dorms also provide a sandwich
bar and grill if one finds the main
course of the day unattractive. Kim
ball even includes a late-night pizza
option for the point-endowed.
The explorative student, however,
will often venture beyond the con
fines of the dorm for his or her
snacks.
Outside the comfortable walls of
one's living quarters can be found a
variety of enticing and potentially
confusing food options.
Unsuspecting freshmen may feel
•lost when they hear that some of their
longer-haired friends are going out
to dinner at a "co-op" or a "self-op."
Co-operative houses are houses
where students perform all food re
lated duties themselves, from cook
ing to washing dishes.
Self-operatives are the same idea,
only with a hired cook.
Self-ops and co-ops boast of hav
ing better dishes than the dorms, and
they generally do. Cleaning your own
dishes and relaxing your hygiene
standards are a small price to pay for
the welcome change of pace.
Tresidder Union holds its own
world of eating options for those who
are ready to pay for a meal. First of all,

there is the Corner Pocket which is
referred to on campus as the "CoPo."
With its own greasy-but-quite
edible style of pizza, frozen yogurt
and seven flavors of ice cream includ
ing blueberry cheesecake, the CoPo
serves a steady and loyal clientele.
Look for more Greeks to be hang
ing around this year as they mistake

the new cheesy surfer decorations for
a truly cool Spring Break atmos
phere.
Across from the CoPo is Baker's
Street. However, as 99 percent of stu
dents don't really know the correct
name, you will hear it referred to
most commonly as "the thing across
from the CoPo" or "that one place."

"The thing across from the CoPo"
serves every kind of bakery product
you could ever want, from bagels to
bundt cake. They have everything,
even "pain au chocolate."
Off to the side of Tresidder is the
Coffee House, otherwise known as


Food at school can have the home touch. Here two co-op residents whip up a batch of chocolate-chip
treats.
