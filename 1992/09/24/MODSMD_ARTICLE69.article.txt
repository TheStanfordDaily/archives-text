by the Committee on Black Performing Arts — each
have their own character and purpose.
| This year is the first time all of these groups will join forces in
a cooperational production called "the Nu Stu Revue," to be
performed during freshman orientation in place of the tradi
tional freshman talent show.
Composed of a 16-person cast, the one-hour show will fea
ture original drama, comedy, music and dance meant to orient
freshmen to, and examine the reality behind, common myths
about Stanford.
Written by Kamy Wicoff, a senior English major, the script
contains scenes about the anxieties involved in applying to Stan
ford, the common post-acceptance conception that "I was a
mistake," and other Stanford stereotypes. There are scenes
about dating at Stanford (an oxymoron, the show suggests), and
about Stanford's anti-intellectual "closet-studier" syndrome.
"We wanted to address every segment of the Stanford com-

munity, with issues applicable to every freshman," said produc
er Melissa Wilson, a junior pyschology major.
The purpose of the Nu Stu Revue is threefold. First, it is a cel
ebration of the diversity of Stanford's performing arts groups
and student body. Each of the groups involved has unique re
sources and points of view:
Founded in 1911, Ram's Head is a student run theater group
that produces Gaieties, Spring Musicals, Winter One Acts, im
provisational theater and special projects. This year"s musical
will be "West Side Story"; last year's was "Cabaret."
The Stanford Drama Department offers courses in dramatic
literature, acting techniques and stage production as well as pro
ducing its own plays — both traditional and experimental. It
also provides other Stanford theater groups with resources such
as facilities, equipment and trained personnel.
The Asian-American Theater Project presents one or two
shows a year focusing on Asian American issues and play

hope to prove to the administration that drama at Stanford will
survive and thrive regardless of its funds.
Any one of the performing arts groups would not have been
able to produce the show alone, said Wilson. Because they are
currendy lacking university support, the participation and fi
nancial contributions of each group was essential, she said.
Even with the support of all four groups, the show's budget is
incredibly low. As compared to a typical Ram's Head produc
tion — which runs between $20,000 and $35,000 — less than
$1,800 has been spent in producing the Nu Stu Revue.
"Fear of the budget cuts has had some good results," Wilson
says."The Drama Department and Ram's Head have both be
come more creative... .1 think if we hadn't felt the squeeze we
might never have done the show."
Given limited money and time, the cast and crew have been
forced to be resourceful. One representative from each of the
four organizations originally brainstormed the idea last May.

a Stanford freshman. The music and scenes were
chosen simultaneously over the summer, from various cities
and states, with lots of long-distance phone-calling and logis
tical maneuvering.
Says Wilson, music directors Scott Offerdahl, a co-term in in
dustrial engineering, and John McWarder, a Ph.D. candidate in
linguistics, did an amazing job of taking the free-form ideas of
script writer Kamy Wicoff and making them into a show.
The lyrics that Offerdahl and McWarder wrote were set to
Broadway tunes. "John has a major collection of Broadway al
bums," Wilson says. "We chose songs that are not widely
known, from plays like 'Little Boy Blues,' 'Ain't Misbehavin"
and 'You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'."
Matt Swanson and Peter Edmonston then edited the script,
while Alexis Turner, a junior who is designing her own major in
dance, anthropology and education, choreographed the dance.
The cast returned to campus on Sept. 17 for two weeks of in-
