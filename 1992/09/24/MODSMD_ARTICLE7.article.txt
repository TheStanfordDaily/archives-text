Bush uses media in southern tour
(AP) — Presidential campaigns spend tens of
millions of dollars on advertising, but President
Bush proved again this week that the best things
in politics can be free, or nearly so.
In one 16-hour, finger-pointing, flag-waving
tour of the states encircling Arkansas, Bush got
the kind of television time and newspaper space
that candidates for lower office can only dream of.
In at least portions of six states, Bush scored a
political hat trick — leading Tuesday's radio and
TV news and dominating the front pages of most
newspapers.
At least some of the local media in the six states
Bush visited simply reported his charges, allowing
Bush to score some of his points unchallenged.
For both candidates, part of their strategy has
been focusing their efforts on both local and non
traditional news outlets.

Clinton goes south to woo voters
COLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) — Bill Clinton bused
across Georgia yesterday offering himself as a
new-breed Democrat ready to lead America's
economy and military in a new era and keep the
nation "forever young."
Clinton and running mate A 1 Gore chose Geor
gia for their fifth bus caravan as the Democrats
targeted a state and region Republicans count on
in presidential elections.
But this year Georgia and the South generally
are considered competitive because of the sour
economy and a Democratic ticket that features
two sons of the region.
Clinton delivered a morning speech designed to
counter President Bush's attacks that the Demo
cratic challenger is not prepared to lead America's
military,and foreign relations.
