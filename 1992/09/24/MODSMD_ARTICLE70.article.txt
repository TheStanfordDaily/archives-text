wrights. One such production was Arthur Miller's "The Cru
cible," adapted to address Asian-American issues.
The Committee on Black Performing Arts sponsors various
artistic projects to bring a black voice to the Stanford campus.
Past productions have included "The Colored Museum" and
"The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World."
I he second purpose of the show is to validate the strength
of Stanford's performing arts program. The Drama De
partment last winter lost about 30 percent of its funding.
This limited the production budget not only of the
Drama Department, but also of every other performing
arts organization at Stanford, since so many of the vari

It was a logistical challenge to get four organizations working
on one show. When auditions took place in late May, the com
mittee still had no idea what the show would be about.
The idea of a multimedia show featuring Stanford groups as
diverse as Kuumba Dance Ensemble, Ballet Folklorico de Stan
ford, the Stanford Band and KZSU was considered. Another
idea was a Great America-style musical revue with show songs
such as "It's a Small World."
None of these ideas were serious options â€” just part of the
brainstorming process. Says Wilson, "All we knew was that we
wanted a unified idea that celebrated something, and it had to be
written with the froshperson in mind."
Finally an original show was written with the working title
of "Debunking Stanford Myths": a series of scenes about life as

tensive rehearsal, from 9 a.m. -10 p.m. each day. Meanwhile the
title had evolved into "The Fro Sho," which was overruled be
cause it excluded transfer students, then again into "Opening
Doors." Says Wilson, "The name 'Nu Stu Revue' was finally cho
sen with an eye to orienting new students to the traditional ab
breviated lingo used at Stanford."
The Nu Stu Revue is a show about and for new Stanford stu
dents. "We want to encourage freshmen to view theater as inte
gral to their Stanford experience, to make them aware of the in
dividual performing arts groups and to get them involved," Wil
son says.
There will be six performances of the Nu Stu Revue, at 7 anil 9p. m.
on Oct. 1,2, and 3in the Little Theater. Admission is free.
