# Tune in to talent with Stanford music
## 
### Tracy Schroeder Editorial staff 
When I was a freshman at Stanford, what as
tonished me most was how many students
played the piano. I'd be hanging out in the
lounge, just settling down to get some reading
(or sleeping) done, and someone would come
in and start tickling those ivory keys.
Now don't get me wrong, I was always envi
ous of the talent and skill of the lounge pianists.
But I needed to study (or sleep), and the library
seemed so cold and impersonal. I would grum
ble to myself, "Can't these people find an outlet
for their music outside the lounge?"
I still think I had a pretty valid gripe, because
there are scads of musical opportunities at
Stanford for lounge pianists (and singers, gui
tarists, violinists, violists, cellists, flutists, per
cussionists, bassoon players, harpists, com
posers, conductors...).
For those who cherish Bach, Chopin,
Strauss or Stravinsky, there are numerous en
sembles of different sizes and styles within the
music department. Private instruction in most
instruments and voice is offered as well.
For those who would rather blow their horn
or bang a drum to the B-52's "Love Shack,"
Ozzy Osbourne's "Crazy Train" or Oingo
Boingo's "Dead Man's Party," there's the
rockin', zany, famous — and infamous —
Stanford Band.
And for those who always loved to sing in
the shower and are willing to trot energetically
onto any Stanford stage, there are eight — yes
eight, if no one has invented a new one yet this
year — student-run a cappella groups.
If that's not enough, there are opportunities
in musical theater through Ram's Head, too
many campus party bands to mention, and
plenty of freedom to "do your own thing."
So really, there's no excuse for being strictly
a lounge pianist at Stanford. If you're in a group
and you've got to practice.. .well, OK. But if
you're not, and you're just keeping people like
me from studying (or sleeping), go get in
volved. Leave the lounge to the loungers. Here
are some of your options:
Music Department Ensembles
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra, con
ducted by Robert Black, is a large, high-quality
ensemble which performs major orchestral
works. Recent years have included tours to Asia
in 1988 and Eastern Europe in 1991. A Pacific
Rim tour is currently in the works for 1993.
This fall's Orchestra repertoire includes two
works by Berlioz: "Symphonie Fantastique,"
and "Lelio: Return to Life." Lelio is a piece for

soloists, chorus, narrator and orchestra.
The Stanford Chamber Orchestra provides
a more intimate playing experience. Composed
of highly skilled players, the Chamber Orches
tra receives rave reviews on a regular basis.
If you've got an car for contemporary in
strumental art music, Jody Rockmaker's Alea II
may be the ensemble for you. Always on the
lookout for challenging, rarely heard pieces and
original unpublished works, Alea II is an arena
for experimentation and artistic growth.
Works range from pieces by Stravinsky to un
published works by graduate student Michael
Edwards.
For any orchestra, students must sign up at
the Music Department to audition on Sept. 28
or 29. Be prepared to play two contrasting
works.
On the choral side of things, there are also
several options. The Symphonic Chorus is a
large ensemble of both students and communi
ty members which often performs with the
Symphony Orchestra. Directed by Jim Frie
man, the group will perform Lelio this fall, in
addition to a separate performance of "Alexan
der's Feast" by Handel.
The University Singers, conducted by Steve
Sano, is a smaller group composed of students.
Their repertoire this fall will consist of seasonal
music by Vaughan Williams and Daniel
Pinkham. The program will be performed in
Memorial Church.
Finally, perhaps the most active choral
group in the Music Department is the Stanford
Chamber Chorale. The Chorale repertoire for
the fall includes works by Bach, Schubert,
Rossini, and Kirke Mechem. In addition to its
quarterly repertoire, the Chorale often per
forms with other department groups and, for
the last two years, has put on a winter musical
theater production.
The Stanford Band
The Band is a wacky alternative to the stan
dard military-style marching band. Field shows
and rallies feature music ranging from rhythm
and blues to classic rock to heavy metal.
Originally a traditional marching band,
complete with uniforms, the Band underwent a
gradual transformation during the sixties. In
1962 the conservative uniform gave way to the
current blazers and hats.
Then came the removal of former conduc
tor Jules Shulat by the Music Department in
1963. Arthur Barnes, still conductor today, was
hired to replace Shulat, and the Band went on
strike in protest. Rebellious spirits were roused,
but their protest was in vain.
However, Barnes proved to be "a pretty cool

guy," said Jon Erickson, a sixties Band manager
and Stanford's current Bursar. It was Barnes
who arranged the Band's first contemporary
music: Beatles tunes.
In 1965, Barnes arranged the Band's trade
mark version of the Star Spangled Banner, plac
ing a sixteen-bar trumpet solo at the beginning
to respond solemnly to the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy.
The Band has since become famous for its
antics, both on the field and off. They have been
barred from Transworld Airlines because, ac
cording to one band member, they "ran from
side to side and rocked the plane."
The governor of Oregon forbade the Band
to enter the state after they poked fun at the
spotted owl controversy during a half-time
show at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon.
The Athletics Department has reserved the
right to review all of their half-time shows be
fore home games.
Fall auditions are very casual; just sign up at
the Band Shak to play a tune chosen by your
section leader. First rehearsal is Monday,
Sept. 28 at 7 p.m.
A cappella Groups
Stanford a cappella groups are student-run,
high -energy performing ensembles of approxi
mately 16 singers each. They have multiplied
fairly dramatically in recent years — from five

in 1989 to eight in 199?
A cappella groups often tour during Spring
Break and sometimes enter studios to record
albums. They perform on every stage on cam
pus, from Kresge Auditorium to Memorial Au
ditorium, in addition to spicing up many oth
erwise dreary house meetings with weekly
shows in dormitory lounges.
This year's groups include Counterpoint,
Everyday People, the Fleet Street Singers, Talis
man, the Mendicants, Mixed Company, SATB
and the Stanford Balladeers.
Counterpoint is an all-female ensemble,
while Fleet Street and the Mendicants are all
male; all others are co-ed.
The music they perform varies from group
to group. Talisman leans toward a world-beat
approach while Mixed Company favors pop.
Fleet Street usually has the most jazz standards
in its sets, while the Mendicants might have a
few more folksy tunes.
However, the only safe bet for figuring out
the personalities of the various groups is to go
to the "A cappella Fest" Tuesday night in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
When scouting out an a cappella group to
join, keep in mind that all of the groups are
constantly changing. But all are receptive to
original student compositions and are con
stantly on the lookout for creative, enthusiastic
singers.

Ozzy Osbourne's "Crazy Train" or Oingo
Boingo's "Dead Man's Party," there's the
rockin', zany, famous — and infamous —
Stanford Band.
And for those who always loved to sing in
the shower and are willing to trot energetically
onto any Stanford stage, there are eight — yes
eight, if no one has invented a new one yet this
year — student-run a cappella groups.
If that's not enough, there are opportunities
in musical theater through Ram's Head, too
many campus party bands to mention, and
plenty of freedom to "do your own thing."
So really, there's no excuse for being strictly
a lounge pianist at Stanford. If you're in a group
and you've got to practice.. .well, OK. But if
you're not, and you're just keeping people like
me from studying (or sleeping), go get in
volved. Leave the lounge to the loungers. Here
are some of your options:
Music Department Ensembles
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra, con
ducted by Robert Black, is a large, high-quality
ensemble which performs major orchestral
works. Recent years have included tours to Asia
in 1988 and Eastern Europe in 1991. A Pacific
Rim tour is currently in the works for 1993.
This fall's Orchestra repertoire includes two
works by Berlioz: "Symphonie Fantastique,"
and "Lelio: Return to Life." Lelio is a piece for

soloists, chorus, narrator and orchestra.
The Stanford Chamber Orchestra provides
a more intimate playing experience. Composed
of highly skilled players, the Chamber Orches
tra receives rave reviews on a regular basis.
If you've got an car for contemporary in
strumental art music, Jody Rockmaker's Alea II
may be the ensemble for you. Always on the
lookout for challenging, rarely heard pieces and
original unpublished works, Alea II is an arena
for experimentation and artistic growth.
Works range from pieces by Stravinsky to un
published works by graduate student Michael
Edwards.
For any orchestra, students must sign up at
the Music Department to audition on Sept. 28
or 29. Be prepared to play two contrasting
works.
On the choral side of things, there are also
several options. The Symphonic Chorus is a
large ensemble of both students and communi
ty members which often performs with the
Symphony Orchestra. Directed by Jim Frie
man, the group will perform Lelio this fall, in
addition to a separate performance of "Alexan
der's Feast" by Handel.
The University Singers, conducted by Steve
Sano, is a smaller group composed of students.
Their repertoire this fall will consist of seasonal
music by Vaughan Williams and Daniel
Pinkham. The program will be performed in
Memorial Church.
Finally, perhaps the most active choral
group in the Music Department is the Stanford
Chamber Chorale. The Chorale repertoire for
the fall includes works by Bach, Schubert,
Rossini, and Kirke Mechem. In addition to its
quarterly repertoire, the Chorale often per
forms with other department groups and, for
the last two years, has put on a winter musical
theater production.
The Stanford Band
The Band is a wacky alternative to the stan
dard military-style marching band. Field shows
and rallies feature music ranging from rhythm
and blues to classic rock to heavy metal.
Originally a traditional marching band,
complete with uniforms, the Band underwent a
gradual transformation during the sixties. In
1962 the conservative uniform gave way to the
current blazers and hats.
Then came the removal of former conduc
tor Jules Shulat by the Music Department in
1963. Arthur Barnes, still conductor today, was
hired to replace Shulat, and the Band went on
strike in protest. Rebellious spirits were roused,
but their protest was in vain.
However, Barnes proved to be "a pretty cool

guy," said Jon Erickson, a sixties Band manager
and Stanford's current Bursar. It was Barnes
who arranged the Band's first contemporary
music: Beatles tunes.
In 1965, Barnes arranged the Band's trade
mark version of the Star Spangled Banner, plac
ing a sixteen-bar trumpet solo at the beginning
to respond solemnly to the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy.
The Band has since become famous for its
antics, both on the field and off. They have been
barred from Transworld Airlines because, ac
cording to one band member, they "ran from
side to side and rocked the plane."
The governor of Oregon forbade the Band
to enter the state after they poked fun at the
spotted owl controversy during a half-time
show at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon.
The Athletics Department has reserved the
right to review all of their half-time shows be
fore home games.
Fall auditions are very casual; just sign up at
the Band Shak to play a tune chosen by your
section leader. First rehearsal is Monday,
Sept. 28 at 7 p.m.
A cappella Groups
Stanford a cappella groups are student-run,
high -energy performing ensembles of approxi
mately 16 singers each. They have multiplied
fairly dramatically in recent years — from five

in 1989 to eight in 199?
A cappella groups often tour during Spring
Break and sometimes enter studios to record
albums. They perform on every stage on cam
pus, from Kresge Auditorium to Memorial Au
ditorium, in addition to spicing up many oth
erwise dreary house meetings with weekly
shows in dormitory lounges.
This year's groups include Counterpoint,
Everyday People, the Fleet Street Singers, Talis
man, the Mendicants, Mixed Company, SATB
and the Stanford Balladeers.
Counterpoint is an all-female ensemble,
while Fleet Street and the Mendicants are all
male; all others are co-ed.
The music they perform varies from group
to group. Talisman leans toward a world-beat
approach while Mixed Company favors pop.
Fleet Street usually has the most jazz standards
in its sets, while the Mendicants might have a
few more folksy tunes.
However, the only safe bet for figuring out
the personalities of the various groups is to go
to the "A cappella Fest" Tuesday night in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
When scouting out an a cappella group to
join, keep in mind that all of the groups are
constantly changing. But all are receptive to
original student compositions and are con
stantly on the lookout for creative, enthusiastic
singers.

When I was a freshman at Stanford, what as
tonished me most was how many students
played the piano. I'd be hanging out in the
lounge, just settling down to get some reading
(or sleeping) done, and someone would come
in and start tickling those ivory keys.
Now don't get me wrong, I was always envi
ous of the talent and skill of the lounge pianists.
But I needed to study (or sleep), and the library
seemed so cold and impersonal. I would grum
ble to myself, "Can't these people find an outlet
for their music outside the lounge?"
I still think I had a pretty valid gripe, because
there are scads of musical opportunities at
Stanford for lounge pianists (and singers, gui
tarists, violinists, violists, cellists, flutists, per
cussionists, bassoon players, harpists, com
posers, conductors...).
For those who cherish Bach, Chopin,
Strauss or Stravinsky, there are numerous en
sembles of different sizes and styles within the
music department. Private instruction in most
instruments and voice is offered as well.
For those who would rather blow their horn
or bang a drum to the B-52's "Love Shack,"
Ozzy Osbourne's "Crazy Train" or Oingo
Boingo's "Dead Man's Party," there's the
rockin', zany, famous — and infamous —
