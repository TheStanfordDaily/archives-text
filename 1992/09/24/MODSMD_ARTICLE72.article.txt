# From beads to Barbie dolls: Local museums have it all
## 
### Aaron Thode Editorial staff 
Congratulations! You have dedi
cated the next nine weeks to classes,
midterms and late night study ses
sions. Visiting museums and learn
ing more about the world may be the
last thing you want to do with your
spare time.
For those masochists out there,
however, here is a brief description
of a few small, inexpensive, but fasci
nating museums available on the
Stanford campus and in Palo Alto.
Stanford Art Museum: Lomita
Drive (723-4177). Unfortunately, a
small earthquake in 1989 severely
damaged this famous museum. In
deed, only fifth-year seniors have
ever seen the inside of the building.
An estimated $20 million will be re
quired to refurbish it; as of now only
$ 12 million has been raised. If fund
raising picks up, the Museum may
open in 1996.
Stanford Art Gallery: Cummings
Art Building, 723-2842. Wedged be
tween the Quad and Hoover Tower,
the Art Gallery is "currently the
main exhibition on campus" for the
University's large art collection, ac
cording to manager Marilyn Calvey.
Until Dec. 13,90 selections of the
$6.5 million Anderson Print collec
tion will be on display. The crisp,
white walls of the gallery display
prints, multiples and monotypes
(paintings on hard surfaces like glass
and metal) of artists Jasper Johns,
Roy Lichtenstein and Robert
Rauschenberg. The gallery gift shop
offers stylish books, calendars,
posters, postcards and gift-wrap.
Felix M. Keesing Anthropology
Museum: Room 11 IK, Building 110,
723-1854.
Plain and unpretentious, this

small room in the Anthropology
Department contains some beauti
ful examples of American Indian
arts and crafts from across the con
tinent.
There are chipped arrowheads,
Navaho metalwork, large and intri
cate Yurok necklaces, Plains Indian
beadwork, delicate Northwest Indi
an animal designs and woven bas
ketwork that were collected by Mrs.
Leland Stanford herself.
Sadly, over $70,000 worth of bas
kets were stolen last year, so an alarm
system now guards the rare objects.
The museum is open every day.
Shannon Brown, who oversees the
exhibits, says they are on display
"primarily for the interest of stu
dents."
The Museum of American Her
itage: 275 Alma, 321-1004. History is
filled with wars, politics, dates,
treaties and trade. But history is also
filled with pianos, cameras, movie
projectors, vacuum cleaners, radios,
toasters and toys.
The museum preserves this histo
ry, describing itself as "a celebration
of mankind's ingenuity in the past as
an inspiration for the future."
This ingenuity is especially
prominent in the current temporary
exhibit, "Models of Invention." Be
fore 1890 the U.S. Patent Office re
quired that models be submitted
with all applications. The display
shows finely crafted models of
bumper boats, washing machines
and even a coffin with a window —
so grieving relatives could check that
their loved ones weren't being
buried alive.
Beverly Nelson, the museum's
executive director, says that after
Oct. 18 two new exhibits will move
in: "Mechanical Musical Machines,"
and a Mattel "Hot Wheels" 25th an

niversary tribute. The museum also
sports permanent exhibits: a 1930s
kitchen, a turn-of-the-century of
fice, and a 1920s grocery.
The Barbie Doll Studio: 460 Wa
verly, 326-5841. On the second floor
of an old building just off University
Ave. is one of the most shocking
sights you will ever see in Palo Alto:
17,000 Barbies and Kens arranged in
chronological order inside display
booths.
On display is the first Barbie is
sued by Mattel in 1959, which lasted
for only two months. Yet over 25
years later, Barbie remains the queen
of the toy world.
"Barbie really shows what mod-
America is," Evelyn Burkhalter, the
owner of the studio, said. "She has
followed every fad, every trend, since
the 19505. She didn't miss a one. The
doll is a perfect follower."
Burkhalter pointed out a flower
child Barbie, an Olympic Barbie —
even a punk Barbie. Barbie nuns
graced the display also. It was an el
derly nun who patiently constructed
the habits and other ceremonial
clothing for over 2,000 Christian re
ligious orders of the world.
Burkhalter and her husband used
to operate a school for young deaf
children. In order to raise money,
Burkhalter and the children's par
ents bought Barbies, sewed cos
tumes for them, and raffled them off.
Although the school closed in the
late '60s, vivid memories remain.
With encouragement from her
friends, Burkhalter founded the stu
dio in 1984 with only 1,000 dolls.
Barbie still keeps pace with the
times: Mattel is currently running a
"Barbie for President" campaign,
with an actual platform based on exit
polls of 6-12 year olds at toy stores
around the nation.

for only two months. Yet over 25
years later, Barbie remains the queen
of the toy world.
"Barbie really shows what mod-
America is," Evelyn Burkhalter, the
owner of the studio, said. "She has
followed every fad, every trend, since
the 19505. She didn't miss a one. The
doll is a perfect follower."
Burkhalter pointed out a flower
child Barbie, an Olympic Barbie —
even a punk Barbie. Barbie nuns
graced the display also. It was an el
derly nun who patiently constructed
the habits and other ceremonial
clothing for over 2,000 Christian re
ligious orders of the world.
Burkhalter and her husband used
to operate a school for young deaf
children. In order to raise money,
Burkhalter and the children's par
ents bought Barbies, sewed cos
tumes for them, and raffled them off.
Although the school closed in the
late '60s, vivid memories remain.
With encouragement from her
friends, Burkhalter founded the stu
dio in 1984 with only 1,000 dolls.
Barbie still keeps pace with the
times: Mattel is currently running a
"Barbie for President" campaign,
with an actual platform based on exit
polls of 6-12 year olds at toy stores
around the nation.

Congratulations! You have dedi
cated the next nine weeks to classes,
midterms and late night study ses
sions. Visiting museums and learn
ing more about the world may be the
last thing you want to do with your
spare time.
For those masochists out there,
however, here is a brief description
of a few small, inexpensive, but fasci
nating museums available on the
Stanford campus and in Palo Alto.
Stanford Art Museum: Lomita
Drive (723-4177). Unfortunately, a
small earthquake in 1989 severely
damaged this famous museum. In
deed, only fifth-year seniors have
ever seen the inside of the building.
An estimated $20 million will be re
quired to refurbish it; as of now only
$ 12 million has been raised. If fund
raising picks up, the Museum may
open in 1996.
Stanford Art Gallery: Cummings
Art Building, 723-2842. Wedged be
tween the Quad and Hoover Tower,
the Art Gallery is "currently the
main exhibition on campus" for the
University's large art collection, ac
cording to manager Marilyn Calvey.
Until Dec. 13,90 selections of the
$6.5 million Anderson Print collec
tion will be on display. The crisp,
white walls of the gallery display
prints, multiples and monotypes
(paintings on hard surfaces like glass
and metal) of artists Jasper Johns,
Roy Lichtenstein and Robert
Rauschenberg. The gallery gift shop
offers stylish books, calendars,
posters, postcards and gift-wrap.
Felix M. Keesing Anthropology
Museum: Room 11 IK, Building 110,
723-1854.
Plain and unpretentious, this

small room in the Anthropology
Department contains some beauti
ful examples of American Indian
arts and crafts from across the con
tinent.
There are chipped arrowheads,
Navaho metalwork, large and intri
cate Yurok necklaces, Plains Indian
beadwork, delicate Northwest Indi
an animal designs and woven bas
ketwork that were collected by Mrs.
Leland Stanford herself.
Sadly, over $70,000 worth of bas
kets were stolen last year, so an alarm
system now guards the rare objects.
The museum is open every day.
Shannon Brown, who oversees the
exhibits, says they are on display
"primarily for the interest of stu
dents."
The Museum of American Her
itage: 275 Alma, 321-1004. History is
filled with wars, politics, dates,
treaties and trade. But history is also
filled with pianos, cameras, movie
projectors, vacuum cleaners, radios,
toasters and toys.
The museum preserves this histo
ry, describing itself as "a celebration
of mankind's ingenuity in the past as
an inspiration for the future."
This ingenuity is especially
prominent in the current temporary
exhibit, "Models of Invention." Be
fore 1890 the U.S. Patent Office re
quired that models be submitted
with all applications. The display
shows finely crafted models of
bumper boats, washing machines
and even a coffin with a window —
so grieving relatives could check that
their loved ones weren't being
buried alive.
Beverly Nelson, the museum's
executive director, says that after
Oct. 18 two new exhibits will move
in: "Mechanical Musical Machines,"
and a Mattel "Hot Wheels" 25th an

niversary tribute. The museum also
sports permanent exhibits: a 1930s
kitchen, a turn-of-the-century of
fice, and a 1920s grocery.
The Barbie Doll Studio: 460 Wa
verly, 326-5841. On the second floor
of an old building just off University
Ave. is one of the most shocking
sights you will ever see in Palo Alto:
17,000 Barbies and Kens arranged in
chronological order inside display
booths.
On display is the first Barbie is
sued by Mattel in 1959, which lasted
for only two months. Yet over 25
years later, Barbie remains the queen
of the toy world.
