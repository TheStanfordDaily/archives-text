# Memorial Church emerges from post-earthquake blues

This year's freshman class is ex
ceptionally lucky. In addition to hav
ing the esteemed pleasure of joining
the community within the eucalyp
tus wall, these students will witness
the reopening of one of the Universi
ty's most prized buildings: Memorial
Church.
The freshman class of 1989 was
the last in recent years to arrive at
Stanford to find this architectural
gem intact, but even many of them
may not have seen the church's inte
rior before the quake of Oct. 17,1989
abruptly closed it down.
Since that fateful day, a variety of
people organized to repair Memorial
Church. The result of their hard, effi
cient work and determination is a
church that is not only quake-proof,
but better equipped to serve Stanford
into the 21st century.
Beginning Oct. 2, everyone will be
able to see the reinforced and updat
ed Memorial Church for themselves.
Commissioned by Mrs. Jane Lath
rop Stanford in 1898 in memory of
her husband, the University's
founder Leland Stanford, the church
stands as the culmination of Stan
ford's Parisian-style "grand axis" that

begins with Palm Drive, continues
through the Oval and passes through
the Memorial Arch.
In January 1903, Memorial
Church was completed at a cost of
$750,000 and was dedicated to non
sectarian religious study. However,
the church is clearly intended for
Christian worship, as its iconography
is strictly Christian.
The church's decorations consist
of mosaics depicting biblical scenes
and stone-carved inscriptions, writ
ten by Mrs. Stanford herself, ex
tolling Christian values and themes.
The floor plan of Memorial
Church was designed in the form of a
cross and has the typical components
of most church designs of the period.
The facade of the church has Byzan
tine architectural detailing in the
lower arches and Romanesque de
tailing in the upper arches.
Its stunning mosaic, designed by a
specialist from Venice, depicts
Christ's Sermon on the Mount. Be
neath this mosaic and above the
Byzantine arches is a Florentine mo
saic depicting the four Christian
virtues of love, faith Jjope and chari

When the Loma Prieta Earth
quake struck the area, Memorial

Church suffered most of its damage
in the four-arch system that supports
the dome over the "drum," or cross
ing area, according to Robert Gregg,
Dean of Memorial Chapel. This area

was not reinforced when the church
was rebuilt after the infamous earth
quake of 1906. Since January
1990, a team of architects, engineers,
builders and other specialists have

worked to restore the church to its
former state and modernize it. New
improvements include a sound sys
