# The
						hedgehog hunters' hut: just another Stanford theme house

### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
Forget this whole free will thing. Whatever
little bit of personality still left unformed will he
determined by the personalities of your fresh
man hallmates. And if that isn't enough, you'll
be buffed, shined and perfected by a combina
tion of where Res Ed shoved you and where
your draw number lands you next year.
So you might as well embrace your new
identity. In the same vein as patriotism and
school spirit, love your dorm because you love
yourself. And, as this pseudo-syllogism slip
slides into a dangerous strand of fascism, you
will become your dorm.
Best to know right away, then, who your en
emies are, and what's the best way to really
tweak them. As Sun-Tzu said, "Once you de
fine your enemy, you have done half the job of
defining yourself. And Branner sucks."
So here's a brief outline of the dormitories
you are likely to encounter, hear about or find
ways to mooch free food from:
•Alpha Sig: People don't rush in here, but
they do rush out. Stuck in the middle of the
Cowell Cluster, this is not a fraternity, not a
sorority, but the people who live here think it is.
They call some people "old farts" and start their
weekends on Wednesdays. Hygiene is not a
high priority.
•Branner: There are almost 180 freshmen
living in a space about the size of the building
where J.J., Michael and Thelma lived. Further
more, the small, but fearsome all-male third
floor has a strictly enforced "No Curls" sign on
it.
And if that isn't reason enough to fear disas
ter, these 180 young, nubile creatures have only
one writing tutor. They'll be lucky if they can
spell sucks. Best to stand clear out of their way.
Luckily, they're easy to spot because they hate

to travel in packs smaller than 40, and even
then, are unlikely to carry a dictionary.
•Casa Zapata: Oooh, those murals. Naked
people. Faceless white women who seem to re
semble Vanna White. And best of all, if you
look real close, you can see Carlos Santana. I
swear.
Zapata, the Chicano and Mexican-Ameri
can theme house, is known for its strong sense
of community. Dating is often decided by con
sensus. They are also very proud of their cul
ture. Do not pronounce the word Zapata unless

you're very, very sure. And
never, never ask if the woH
Zapata means "shoe."
•Donner: Team Don
ner'll make you jump,
jump.
•lambda Nu: They cook
wholesome food, use
wholesome hair products
and but don't smell so
wholesome. They also take
plenty of wholesome mind
altering drugs and pray to a
guy called "Mr. Qua-alude"
who is enshrined in a mural
in their home. But they're
very nice.
•Mirrielees: Although
the accommodations are
spacious, it is not uncom
mon for the upper-class
men who live there to go an
entire year and not ever
meet the people who live
across the hall. Not exactly a
collegiate experience, save
for the Greg Bradyesque
green rugs.
•Muwekma-Tah-Ruk:
No one can pronounce

this, except for people who live here, and no
one can even confirm that. Don't call it Lath
rop. Don't call it Aoxamaxoa. As Stanford's of
ficial Native American theme house, gambling
is permitted within the confines of the house.
Hard to believe.
•Okada: Although this is the official Asian-
American theme house, the food isn't very good.
No one can figure this out.
•Potter: Proclaimed the *60s-'9os theme
house, the upperclassmen in Potter will be able
to enjoy bad fashion from those big, ugly felt

Dr. Seuss hats, to those big, ugly, felt Dr. Seuss
hats. What better way to enjoy Dexy's Midnight
Runners, paint your boyfriend in dayglo and
peel the Ross Perot bumper sticker off your car.
It's almost like those new, stupid Miller Lite
commericals.
•Rinconada: Known primarily as
"Drinkalotta," this all-frosh dorm contains
some of the liveliest spirits around, especially
when it comes to finding clever ways to dispose
of alcohol. The dorm throws a big, all day party
at the end of the year called, for no apparent

reason, "Rinc-a-Delt." Over the past
five years, bands like the Red Hot
Chili Peppers and Phish have come to
help celebrate the fine art of drinking
and taking drugs in the great out
doors.
•Robinson: This is the gen
der studies dorm. This does not mean
it is the men-hating dorm. It simply
means they are willing to look at, dis
cuss and investigate differerent ways
to hate men.
•Roble: An ivy without a
league. There are more people here
than in some of those former Soviet
republics — and they all live alone.
With sinks. Makes you wonder.
•Roth: In this mythical
house, only women live. It is filled
with pink forests and frilly, ginger
bread windows. Dressing up like
Buffy and Hildegard is rumored to
get you in for a night, sometimes two.
Naked pillow fights do not occur on a
regular basis. Location unknown.
•Schiff: People like to say
ScFfT. It rolls of the tongue and in
vokes images of Gerhard Casper on

Casa Zapata's murals dip and swirl from the doorways to the dining
room. Zapata is only one of Stanford's many theme residences.
