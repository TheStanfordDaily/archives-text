# More than one oasis lies beyond Palm Drive

### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
"So what is there to do around here?"
As new students quickly find out, one of
Stanford's few flaws is its isolation from any
sort of "college town." Palo Alto seems light
years away to many, and the trek just doesn't
seem worth it for a town with no night life to
speak of.
But surprisingly, the campus itself does en

compass several places worthy of spending a
few hours, either in rapturous solitude or en
joying the company of friends.
Of course, extracurricular activities provide
the most common Stanford hangouts. If you
join the Stanford Band, for instance, the lovely
and enthralling Band Shak will probably be a
familiar sight. Memorial Auditorium's Green
Room becomes a home away from home for
those involved with the Drama Department
and/or Ram's Head Theatrical Society.

But for
those who want
to congregate
away from the of
fice, so to speak,
or for those seek
ing a serene place
to collect their
thoughts and
catch up on CIV
reading, the Farm
offers a variety of
locales appropri
ate for hanging
out.
The Coffee
House
PI uses:
Open until mid
night, often with
live entertain
ment. The CoHo

offers a wide variety of coffees and beers as well
as a decent food menu. Its central location
makes it a good meeting place, although large
packs of Greeks, "Sprockets" rejects, and peo
ple actually trying to study often make finding a
table a real challenge.
Minuses: Closes at midnight, but that's still
later than most everything else on campus. The
music often drowns out conversation, but the
patio provides a less noisy alternative. When
it's crowded, this is often the only seating left.
Studiers aside, the CoHo's not much fun alone.
Tresidder Front Patio
Pluses: At almost any time during the day,
it's surprisingly relaxing to sit and read or con
verse here or on the nearby lawn between
Dinkelspiel Auditorium and the Old Union
Clubhouse. Close to just about everything, it's
nearly ideal for a small daytime gathering of
friends. Noontime concerts featuring student
performers are also a plus; be amazed by and
cheer on your talented classmates.
Minuses: Concerts can be annoying if you're
not in the mood. It's also hard to find a table
during the noon hour because of Tresidder's
lack of seating for lone eaters, who are then
forced to monopolize an entire table. The area
is almost completely useless at night, primarily
because the Coffee House is nearby and a far
superior evening hangout.
The Quad
Pluses: One of the oldest and most architec

turally interesting places on campus. Memori
al Court features a nice grassy area, with the
Stanford Court Jugglers often providing enter
tainment as they practice. Shady palm trees and
concrete planters that double as benches or
backrests are highlights of the Inner Quad.
Minuses: If you're looking to escape acade
mics, the Quad certainly isn't the place to do it.
Lots of bicycles, pedestrian traffic, illegal skate
boarders and, on sunny days, classes relocated
to the great outdoors can be distracting.
The Oval
Pluses: A great picnic spot including park
benches, and one of the few large patches of
green grass on campus. A well-placed walkway
cutting through the center means pesky pedes
trians won't interfere with your meeting, party
or meditation.
Minuses: But the volleyballers and frisbee
throwers might. Although the Oval is slightly
sunken, providing a bit more serenity, it's sur
rounded by an "A" parking lot with lots of vis
itors endlessly circling for a place to park.
Lake Lag
Pluses: When filled, it reminds you why you
came to Stanford — on-campus windsurfing
classes for credit. The barbecue area and a very
small beach add to the oceanic ambiance. The
lake bed is surrounded by trees, so it's secluded
and relatively quiet, except when the Kappa Al-

phas throw a party
Minuses: When not filled, it
appears in all of its fire-trap glory
— full of dry weeds. Without the
boathouse (torn down several
years ago), there's no place to
congregate, especially because of
the precariously steep banks. It's
almost too secluded and poorly
lit at night.
The Dish
Pluses: A spectacular view of
campus and the Bay Area.
Because of its serenity, it's also a

great place for reflection and
meditation, as well as deep,
meaningful conversations — if
you can convince any of your
friends to hike the hill. Wildlife
(well, cows and an occasional
deer) and photogenic trees add
to the attraction.
Minuses: A workout just to
get there, so it's not a common
place to visit, except for those
serious joggers. There's not
much to do up there except talk,
relax or take pictures, and you'll
be picking dry weeds out of your
blanket/clothes for weeks. For a
variety of reasons, including the
law, it's not a good place to be
after dark, but sunset from the
Dish is unparalleled.
