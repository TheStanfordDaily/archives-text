# Niches for Nerds

The hard reality of coming to
Stanford is that you will probably
have to study at least every once in a
while if you want to stay. The issue,
then, is how to make studying a
pleasant and profitable experience—
a tough goal.
You may ask yourself, "Where
should I study?" The answer depends
on what you want out of your study
time. Do you want to do a Chemistry
31 problem set in one night or strike
up an interesting conversation with a
dormmate about some totally unre
lated topic?
One option many people enter
tain is studying in their dorm room.
You don't have to go out in the dark.
You can listen to your stereo and talk
on the phone if you need a break. Or,
you can study in the common room
and make some friends while you get
something accomplished. Sounds
good at first.
But beware. After numerous dis
tractions, you may not get as much
done as you originally intended to —

and you may be sorry during your
mid-term the next day.
If this happens, never fear. A myr
iad of study spots exist outside your
dorm.
At the Coffee House, you can
study while you listen to music and
eat. Go during the day if you actually
want to get something done.
Next door, the indoor Tresidder
eating booths are popular studying
places at night. The chairs can be un
comfortable, though, and you may
end up eating too much pizza.
If you aren't really in the studying
mood you can sit on the grass in front
of Green Library. For that matter, it's
kosher to read a book anywhere out
side. The grass within the Oval and
the Tresidder patio are favorite spots.
For more conventional studying
places, there are numerous campus
libraries. Green is quiet and comfort
able. The basement level is especially
intense. The second floor is the most
social. Whatever you do, don't sit in
the cushiony chairs — college stu
dents always need more sleep, and

college students always need more
sleep, and those chairs are designed
to be slept in.
Meyer Library is a bit less com
fortable than Green and can get a bit
chilly. But during the day, you can
head to the fourth floor sun decks to
catch a few rays.
The music library in Braun Music
Center is a small and comfortable
place where you can listen to a wide
range of music on headphones while
you study.

Cubberley Library, on the second
floor of the School of Education, is
quiet and cheery and has big tables.
Venture up to the upper level of the
library for individual desks and lots
of windows. But the chairs aren't
very comfortable and the library
closes early.
History Corner in the Quad is
open all night and is a great place to
study into the wee hours. It can get
creepy there if you're alone, so you
might want to bring a friend.
Where you choose to study can
make a lot of difference in how you
actually spend your time. So chose
carefully — it just might mean your
grade.
