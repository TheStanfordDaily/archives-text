The hard reality of coming to
Stanford is that you will probably
have to study at least every once in a
while if you want to stay. The issue,
then, is how to make studying a
pleasant and profitable experience—
a tough goal.
You may ask yourself, "Where
should I study?" The answer depends
on what you want out of your study
time. Do you want to do a Chemistry
31 problem set in one night or strike
up an interesting conversation with a
dormmate about some totally unre
lated topic?
One option many people enter
tain is studying in their dorm room.
You don't have to go out in the dark.
You can listen to your stereo and talk
on the phone if you need a break. Or,
you can study in the common room
and make some friends while you get
something accomplished. Sounds
good at first.
But beware. After numerous dis
tractions, you may not get as much
done as you originally intended to —

and you may be sorry during your
mid-term the next day.
If this happens, never fear. A myr
iad of study spots exist outside your
dorm.
At the Coffee House, you can
study while you listen to music and
eat. Go during the day if you actually
want to get something done.
Next door, the indoor Tresidder
eating booths are popular studying
places at night. The chairs can be un
comfortable, though, and you may
end up eating too much pizza.
If you aren't really in the studying
mood you can sit on the grass in front
of Green Library. For that matter, it's
kosher to read a book anywhere out
side. The grass within the Oval and
the Tresidder patio are favorite spots.
For more conventional studying
places, there are numerous campus
libraries. Green is quiet and comfort
able. The basement level is especially
intense. The second floor is the most
social. Whatever you do, don't sit in
the cushiony chairs — college stu
dents always need more sleep, and
