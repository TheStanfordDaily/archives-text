You may not know it, but
everyone else does.
Yes, as a new student, there is a
scarlet "N" sewn into all your
clothes. It's obvious. It's in the way
you move. It's in the way you talk.
To help you remove that
heinous mark of naivete, we offer
you a Webster's guide to Stanford
lingo.
ASSU: Associated Students of
Stanford University. Excellent re
sume-packer. Training ground for
future politicians, but actually
provdies a few decent services like
Flicks and Lecture Notes.
The Axe: Symbol of Stanford's
virility in athletics. When a well
known German physicist was
asked if he knew of Stanford, he
replied, "I believe it is somewhere
on the West Coast of America.
There is another school nearby,
and they steal each others' axes."

Band Shak: Where the Band (see
LSJUMB) practices. Entrance is
granted only to those bearing
stolen street signs.
BART: Bay Area Rapid Transit.
Not to be confused with "Fresno
Area Rapid Transit."
Big Game: If you have to ask, you
shouldn't be here. In mid-Novem
ber you will live, eat and breathe
Big Game, whether you want to or
not.
Blow it off: What you do to a Cul
tures, Ideas and Values (CIV)
paper when you have to decide be
tween two options: 1) Write a CIV
paper that's due tomorrow or 2)
Engage in a night of wild debauch
ery.
Bollards: Wooden objects strate
gically placed in certain paths to
block cars and absent-minded bik
ers. Bollards are a good reason to
have a "designated biker" for all
those wild parties.
