King riot task force phased out
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A criminal task force
created during the Los Angeles riots is being
phased out as leads dwindle, federal officials said.
To date, it has produced just two federal crimi
nal cases and fewer than 60 filings by the Los
Angeles district attorney's office, officials said.
"You reach a point where there are no addi
tional leads to pursue on many of the cases." said
Acting U.S. Attorney Terree A. Bowers.
Investigations were hampered by chaos during
the riots, which left 53 dead, more than 1,500 peo
ple injured and nearly $1 billion in damage.
U.S. spends little on school
WASHINGTON (AP) - Affluent America
spends only an average portion of its money on
education, compared with other industrialized
nations, a study of the world's 24 wealthiest
industrialized democracies showed yesterday.
Denmark and Finland lead in spending public
funds for education, said the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, an
intergovernmental agency in Paris that monitors
world economies.
The Bush administration touts the notion that
the United States spends a great deal of its wealth

on education. But it ranks behind 12 other indus
trialized nations in its public spending on educa
tion according to the report.
But Education Secretary Lamar Alexander
said the report "reminds us that money alone is
not the answer."
Murphy premiere rates well
NEW YORK (AP) — Vice President Dan Quayle
and 44 million other viewers tuned in to watch the
hour-long season premiere of "Murphy Brown."
Monday night's episode logged a 29.3 rating,
the A.C. Nielsen Co. said. The CBS comedy, com
peting with NFL football, received a 41 percent
share of viewers watching TV at that hour.
Last spring, Quayle accused the show of glam
orizing unwed motherhood by having its title
character give birth out of wedlock. On Monday's
episode, Murphy (Candice Bergen) responded in
an editorial on her fictional news show.
"Perhaps it's time for the vice president to
expand his definition and recognize that whether
by choice or circumstance, families come in all
shapes and sizes," she said. "And ultimately,
what really defines a family is commitment, car
ing and love."
Quayle, watching for the first time, said,
"Obviously Hollywood still doesn't get it."
