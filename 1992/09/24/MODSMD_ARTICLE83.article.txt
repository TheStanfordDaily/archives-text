BRRRRRH
If campus food gets you down,
then head for Pier 39 this Satur
day for KQED's ice cream so
cial. From bountiful booths will
flow bites of Ben & Jerry's,
Baskin Robbins, Bud's and
Breyer's. Be the first to sample
Haagen-Dazs' new "stuffed"

flavors - Carrot Cake Passion,
Cappuccino Commotion and
Triple Brownie Overload. And
while you're at it, overload
yourself because it's a long time
'til Sundae.

Tickets to the festival cost $8,
with a 15% discount for KQED
members. The pass entitles you to
all tastings plus parking and a
free carousel ride. Yippiel
