# Syria wants peace with Israel
## No agreement in recent talks, new meetings scheduled 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Syria's foreign minister
offered "total peace" to Israel yesterday and assured
Acting Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger his
government wants a settlement in the Middle East.
"I don't want to raise any euphoria," a senior
Bush administration official said. But he told
reporters that "we've heard something interesting"
from Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa. He said it
would be conveyed to Israel.
The official, who gave an account of the meeting
on the condition he not be identified, refused to say
what Sharaa had suggested that the Bush adminis
tration found promising.
"Sharaa made it very clear from the outset that
Syria wants the talks to succeed," the official said,
and Eagleburger told him, "We will be active."
The meeting came as Israeli and Syrian negotia
tors in Washington, wrapping up three weeks of
talks, said they had failed to reach agreement on a
joint document outlining negotiating principles.
They promised to try again at their next round, ten
tatively scheduled for Oct. 21.
"We are not in agreement on the central issues,"
said Syrian spokesperson Bushra Kanafani, but
"don't take it that we are pessimistic."
She said Israel continued to reject giving up the
Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in the
1967 Arab-Israeli war. But, she added, "there are

elements of agreement. . .and that is something I am
very pleased about."
The agreement revolves mostly around each
side's acceptance of the other's legitimate security
concerns that must be addressed in any accord, and
on recognition that any peace agreement must
include Israel and all its Arab neighbors, Kanafani
said.
Sharaa reached out to Israel even while con
demning it as the only Middle Eastern state produc
ing weapons of mass destruction.
"We are willing for total peace for total with
drawal from the occupied Arab lands," he said. "Our
sincerity is not questioned. You can ask the Israelis
and they know it."
On another touchy subject, Sharaa defended
Syria's right to import advanced technology "for
peaceful purposes." Asked about a shipment of
chemicals from India to Syria which U.S. ofTicials
said earlier this week they had blocked, Sharaa said
"there are a lot of false stories." But he did not deny
that Syria intended to import the substances from
India, which the United States says is for the manu
facture of chemical weapons.
He criticized Israel as the only country in the
region with weapons of mass destruction, apparent
ly referring to a nuclear weapons program Israel has
never acknowledged.
