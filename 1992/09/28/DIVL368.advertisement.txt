JAPANESE HIGH TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT:
AN ANALYTICAL APPROACH
by Dr. Fumio Kodama
Visiting Professor Department of Mechanical Engineering and the
Asia/Pacific Research Center
The course presents an empirical analysis
of the generation, innovation, and diffusion of
Japanese high technologies. The purpose is to
address the basic question of whether the
Japanese have consciously built a socioeco
nomic system that is efficient at producing
sophisticated commercial high technologies,
or has the paradigm of technical innovation
changed in such a way as to fit the pre-exist
ing system? Materials presented in the course
will be used as a starting point for examining
the high tech strategy of the United States as
well.
The course is designed for students inter
ested in science and technology policy, in
innovation studies, and in Japanese studies.
Science and engineering students may wish to
take the course as a way to broaden their per
spectives for career purposes.
