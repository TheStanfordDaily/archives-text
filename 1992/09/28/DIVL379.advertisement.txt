Take Petroleum Engineering 103, Energy Resources!
LEARN ABOUT ENERGY!
A comprehensive overview of the primary sources of
energy: oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear and
hydroelectric, and emerging sources such as wind,
solar, geothermal and energy efficiency. The course
will provide an understanding of the distribution of
each resource and how each is recovered and
converted to useful forms of energy. Environmental,
technical, regulatory and economic consideration of
each resource will be discussed.
There will be five field trips offered and each student
must attend two:
■ Chevron's World of Oil Museum'
■ Rancho Seco (nuclear and PV plants)
■ The Geysers (geothermal)
■ Folsom Dam (hydro) and Altamont Pass (wind)
■ Pacific Energy Center (energy efficiency)
Consulting Professor Jane Woodward
Meet: MWF 9-9:50 am
Location: Bldg. 420, Rm.041
