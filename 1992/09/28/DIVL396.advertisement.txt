IRONICALLY, THE TIME TO START
SAVING FOR RETIREMENT IS WHEN IT LOOKS
LIKE YOU CAN LEAST AFFORD IT.
Can't afford to save tor retirement?
The truth is, you can't afford not to.
Not when you realize that your retirement
can last no to 30 years or more. You'll want
to live at least as comfortably then as you
do now. And that takes planning.
By starting to save now, you can take
advantage of tax-deferr.il and give your
money time to compound and grow.
Consider this: set aside just $100 each
month beginning at age 30 and you can
accumulate over $198,539* by the time
you reach age 65. But wait ten years and
you'll have to budget $227 each month
to reach the same goal.
Start planntnfl your future. Cmil
Ensuring the future
for those who shape it. 9 "
Even ifyou're not counting the years to
retirement,you can count on TIAA-CREF
to help you build the future you deserve—
with fl exible retirement and tax-deferred
annuity plans, a diverse portfolio of invest
ment choices, and a record of personal
service that spans 75years.
Over a million people in education and
research put TIAA-CREF at the top of
their list for retirement planning. Why not
join them?

to build a secure tomorrow when you
have time and TIAA-CREF working on
your side.
