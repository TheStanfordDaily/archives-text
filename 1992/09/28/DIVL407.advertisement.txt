Take a Linguistics Class This Autumn!
The Linguistics Department at Stanford ... among the 5 best in the country ... is pleased to announce its Autumn
Undergraduate offerings u>hich introduce you to the study of language from diverse perspectives ... analytical, applied,
cognitive, computational, historical, literary, social and political. Most of the courses have no prerequisites. Several
fulfill distribution requirements (4 or 9) and one (150) is a writing focus course with a public service option. Stop by
Building 100 if you need more information.
70. The Structure of English Words — Analysis of vocabulary to determine word meanings. Goals: to
increase vocabulary, and, by enumerating the principles behind changes in pronunciation and meaning,
take the mystery out of the processes that have made our vocabulary what it is today. Instructor: William
Leben, MWF 10AM in Meyer 124 Fulfills DR: 4
72. Point of View in Fiction: A Linguistic Approach — (Same as English 105.) Point of view in fiction
can be defined as the relation of the narrator to the events of and participants in the narrative, and the
implied reader. Focuses on the kinds of syntactic and semantic structures used in the development of point
of view, e.g., tense, transitivity, backgrounding, and foregrounding through complex sentence structure, use
of different language varieties. Examples from several short stories in English. Instructor: Elizabeth
Traugott. MWF 2:15, 50-51P
97. Research in Linguistics — Introduction to research goals and methods in linguistics and related
disciplines. Discussion of assigned readings, and presentation of senior thesis and other undergraduate
research projects. Overviews by different faculty members of current research topics and methods in their
sub-areas. Instructor: John Rickford, TTH 4:15-5:45, 250-251 L
102. The History of the English Language — (Same as English 202.) Evolution of the English language
as a medium of literary expression. Instructor: Seth Lerer, MTWTH 2:15, Ter 102 Fulfills DR:9
120. Introduction to Syntax — Analyses of various grammatical constructions, primarily English, and
their consequences for a general theory of language. Practical experience in forming and testing linguistic
hypotheses, reading, and constructing rules. Instructor: Ivan Sag, MW 3:15-4:45, 200-30
135. Basic Concepts in Mathematical Logic — (Same as Philosophy 159.) Introduction to concepts and
techniques used in mathematical logic, primarily through the study of the language of first-order logic.
Topics include: formalization, proof, propositional logic, quantifiers, sets, mathematical induction, and
enumerability. Instructor: Tom Wasow, MWF 9:00, 420-050 Fulfills DR:4(6) _
139/239. Introduction to Computational Linguistics — Introduction to the computational aspects of
basic linguistic processes in morphology, syntax, and semantics, and their integration in applications such
as machine translation and man-machine interfaces. Grades based on computer programs implementing
key algorithms for parsing, generation, etc., done as homework exercises. Prerequisite: introductory course
in prolog programming. Instructor: Martin Kay, TTH 4:14-5:45, Meyer 410
145. Language and Thought — (Same as Psychology 146.) The psychology of language, including
production and understanding of utterances, from speech sounds to speaker's meaning, children's
acquisition of their first language, and psychological bases for language systems. Language functions in
natural contexts and their relation to the processes by which language is produced, understood and
acquired. Prerequisite: 1 or Psychology 1. Instructor: Herb C lark, MWF 1:15, 420-050, Fulfills DR:9
150. Introduction to Sociolinguistics — The study of language in society. Social dialects, class, ethnic,
and gender differences in speech. Prestige and stigma associated with different ways of speaking. Stylistic
variation; how speakers adapt their language to different audiences and different social contexts. This is a
writing focus course, providing extra experience with training in the art ot academic writing. For additional
units, students have the option of a public service internship in an organization dealing with linguistic
minorities or language-related issues, such as bilingual education or language rights. Instructor: John
Rickford, TTH 11:00, 240-241 L, Fulfills DR:9
172. Linguistic Foundations of Racial Strife in America — (Same as Education 107 X.) Examines
controversial topics regarding language, education, and racial integration in American schools. Basic
linguistic concepts as they pertain to the evolution of linguistic and cultural diversity of school
populations. Multicultural education, bilingualism, and language-related dimensions of affirmative action.
Ethical issues as part of the American quest for racial harmony in schools and society. Educational reform
topics are a central theme. Fulfills DR: 3 Instructor: John Baugh, W 7:oopm, e270
189/289. Linguistics and the Teaching of English as a Foreign/Second Language — (Same as Education
282.) Foundation in methods and techniques for teaching second or foreign languages from the
perspective of modern linguistics and language acquisition theory. Focus is on teaching English, but
principles underlying methods and techniques discussed are applicable to teaching any language.
Instructor: Phil Hubbard. MW 1:15-3:05, 540-547
