# Casper tackles presidency
## New president rolls up sleeves, gets to work Casper's inquisitive nature boon for Farm 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Gerhard Casper greets visitors to his office
with a long, slow bow. For a man who has
been called "Stanford's savior" and por
trayed as a white knight galloping in to save the
school from scandal, it is a disarming gesture of
humility.
Looking rumpled, in his shirt sleeves and a loos
ened necktie, Casper sought in a wide-ranging
interview to defuse the high expectations that
inevitably followed his appointment as Stanford's
ninth president last spring.
Apprehensive about the headlines, Casper said
he is neither "An Outsider Come to the Rescue"
nor the guarantor of a "New Era at Stanford."
"There isn't much to rescue, and I'm not a mir
acle worker anyway," he said. "I'm just not it. If
Stanford wanted a miracle worker, they should
have looked for somebody else."
A cautious, quietly articulate speaker, Casper at
first glance seems an unlikely choice to succeed
Donald Kennedy, the ebullient leader who drove
Stanford's unprecedented growth during the 1980s.
But colleagues say Casper's most prominent
trait is a questioning nature that challenges even
the most basic assumptions. They expect that trait
to be a cornerstone for Stanford as it seeks to rein
vent itself in the wake of the indirect-cost contro
versy that left its image and finances badly scarred.
Formerly provost and law school dean at the
University of Chicago, Casper possesses a conser
vative nature shaped by his 25 years at the univer
sity, colleagues say. But they emphasize that it is
not a political conservatism, as some have feared,
but rather a traditional conservatism — an outlook
that will lead him to move deliberately and care
fully to address Stanford's problems.
"The fact that he is conservative and tradition
al-natured means that he isn't going to dramati
cally change what is a great American university,"
said Douglas Baird, a law professor at the Univer
sity of Chicago. "If he had wanted to run an insti
tution like Chicago, he would have stayed here."
A determined advocate for American higher
education, Casper has immediately set out
to convince the federal government of the
value of research conducted at Stanford. At a news
conference during his first day on the job Sept. 1,
he called for a "statute of limitations" on criticism
of Stanford for the indirect-cost controversy.
Declaring that the Catholic Church is more for
giving than the American public, Casper said: "If
you have sinned once in your life, it will still be held
against you without any indication of forgiveness."
Casper's skill at using the presidential pulpit,
along with his reputation for austerity, will be
powerful tools in Stanford's negotiations with the
government, observers say.
"I think he certainly will be a strong spokesman
for higher education," said Provost Gerald Lieber
man, a key adviser to Casper as he prepared to
assume the presidency. "He has very high intellec
tual standards, and I think he's got the right stan
dards for academia."

University President Gerhard Casper rolls up his sleeves to enjoy a view of the Quad from the third floor of History Corner. On the eve of his inaugura
tion, Casper still must educate himself about Stanford and is reluctant to map out a grand plan.
