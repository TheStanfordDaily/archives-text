# Casper tackles presidency
## New president rolls up sleeves, gets to work Casper's inquisitive nature boon for Farm 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Gerhard Casper greets visitors to his office
with a long, slow bow. For a man who has
been called "Stanford's savior" and por
trayed as a white knight galloping in to save the
school from scandal, it is a disarming gesture of
humility.
Looking rumpled, in his shirt sleeves and a loos
ened necktie, Casper sought in a wide-ranging
interview to defuse the high expectations that
inevitably followed his appointment as Stanford's
ninth president last spring.
Apprehensive about the headlines, Casper said
he is neither "An Outsider Come to the Rescue"
nor the guarantor of a "New Era at Stanford."
"There isn't much to rescue, and I'm not a mir
acle worker anyway," he said. "I'm just not it. If
Stanford wanted a miracle worker, they should
have looked for somebody else."
A cautious, quietly articulate speaker, Casper at
first glance seems an unlikely choice to succeed
Donald Kennedy, the ebullient leader who drove
Stanford's unprecedented growth during the 1980s.
But colleagues say Casper's most prominent
trait is a questioning nature that challenges even
the most basic assumptions. They expect that trait
to be a cornerstone for Stanford as it seeks to rein
vent itself in the wake of the indirect-cost contro
versy that left its image and finances badly scarred.
Formerly provost and law school dean at the
University of Chicago, Casper possesses a conser
vative nature shaped by his 25 years at the univer
sity, colleagues say. But they emphasize that it is
not a political conservatism, as some have feared,
but rather a traditional conservatism — an outlook
that will lead him to move deliberately and care
fully to address Stanford's problems.
"The fact that he is conservative and tradition
al-natured means that he isn't going to dramati
cally change what is a great American university,"
said Douglas Baird, a law professor at the Univer
sity of Chicago. "If he had wanted to run an insti
tution like Chicago, he would have stayed here."
A determined advocate for American higher
education, Casper has immediately set out
to convince the federal government of the
value of research conducted at Stanford. At a news
conference during his first day on the job Sept. 1,
he called for a "statute of limitations" on criticism
of Stanford for the indirect-cost controversy.
Declaring that the Catholic Church is more for
giving than the American public, Casper said: "If
you have sinned once in your life, it will still be held
against you without any indication of forgiveness."
Casper's skill at using the presidential pulpit,
along with his reputation for austerity, will be
powerful tools in Stanford's negotiations with the
government, observers say.
"I think he certainly will be a strong spokesman
for higher education," said Provost Gerald Lieber
man, a key adviser to Casper as he prepared to
assume the presidency. "He has very high intellec
tual standards, and I think he's got the right stan
dards for academia."
Casper's Sept. 9 streamlining of the Universi

University President Gerhard Casper rolls up his sleeves to enjoy a view of the Quad from the third floor of History Corner. On the eve of his inaugura
tion, Casper still must educate himself about Stanford and is reluctant to map out a grand plan.
ty's top administration was a key first step, accord
ing to observers. It reassured faculty that Stanford
had not lost sight of its academic mission, and it
sent a message to the federal government that the
school is cleaning house in the wake of the indirect
cost controversy.
The moves are "clearly designed to send signals
of what the real mission of Stanford is — namely,
teaching and research," said Physics Prof. Steve
Chu, one of the members of the search committee
that selected Casper as president. And, he said, the
moves will help convince the government that
Stanford is "no longer a fat cat."
In dealing with the government, Casper has
advantages Kennedy did not have: He is untouched
by the controversy, and his humble bearing will
likely deflect the charges of arrogance that had
dogged Kennedy.
Although Casper said it is still "too early to tell"
whether his mere presence has helped to improve
Stanford's relations with the government, he
believes the government is beginning to realize it
has as much at stake in mending the relationship
as Stanford does.
Straightening out the relationship will be essen
tial to removing the cloud of uncertainty that
hangs over the University's finances, Casper said.
With the indirect-cost negotiations unresolved and
Stanford losing millions of dollars each year, it is
"very hard for Stanford to live."
As Stanford's main spokesperson, Casper will
set the institution's tone. But he has been
reluctant to map out a grand plan, saying
that as an outsider he must first educate himself
about Stanford.
Indeed, since his appointment the German-born
legal scholar has been scrambling just to bring
himself up to speed. He spent the summer studying
Stanford and its history, reading everything from
budget reports to the nearly 2,000-page, two-vol
ume autobiography of David Starr Jordan, Stan
ford's first president.
But Casper is emphatic about the need to
improve undergraduate teaching, and brings with
him a philosophy that emphasizes the importance
of teaching and research above all else.
Stanford, Casper said, needs to emphasize the
"monitoring" of undergraduate teaching and come
up with institutional ways to "see where our weak
spots are."
To begin the task of evaluating Stanford's teach
ing, Casper recently hired Geoffrey Cox, an associ
ate provost at the University of Chicago with
whom he had worked closely.
Cox, who begins work in a new position called
"vice provost for institutional planning" Nov. 1,
will play a key role in shaping long-range academic
policies, Casper said.
And Casper plans to put himself on the line, too.
He said in a press conference during his first day on
the job that he will teach an undergraduate course
on constitutional law, his specialty, next year.
"We have to be satisfied that indeed we are
doing the best possible job with the resources we
have," Casper said in the press conference. "And
that would mean to some extent we think harder
about how we deploy our resources."

'And maybe instead of trying to
provide the equivalent of busi
ness class in airline flying, we
should see whether economy
class is not sufficient.'

In the current fiscal crunch, the battle over how
to spend those increasingly scarce resources will
become a major issue. In an interview with the
Christian Science Monitor last April, Casper said
the new economic realities may actually be benefi
cial in paring back some of the competition
between universities in "what you might call the
services area."
While "many of the support services we render
are wonderful," Casper said, "universities are first
of all about teaching and research."
"And maybe instead of trying to provide the
equivalent of business class in airline flying, we
should see whether economy class is not sufficient."
It is a position that may be ill-received at Stan
ford, which has become used to a high level of sup
port for services like residential education, advis
ing and tutoring.

"I think that will be quite controversial and I'm
sure we will have many more discussions about that
subject," said the 54-year-old Casper, who chooses
his words precisely, belying his legal background.
"It's quite clear that if we compare the quality of
life at Stanford with the quality of life at a univer
sity in France, for example, or Germany, what we
have here is just stunning," he said.
But many faculty at Stanford worry that last
year's $43 million in budget cuts have already gone
too far in slashing the "safety net" programs for
students.
In an address to the Faculty Senate on April 9,
Assoc. Engineering Prof. Ross Shachter said the
"quality of undergraduate life" has been threat
ened by the cuts.
"The safety net is still there," he said, "but the
holes in it are getting alarmingly large."
Casper, however, contends that students will
hardly notice the cuts. "There may be longer lines,
but beyond that I would be very surprised if the
impact is very severely felt," he said.
To many, Casper seemed a surprising choice to
follow Kennedy, whose outspoken liberalism
propelled the multicultural movement dur
ing the 1980s.
Casper, the former dean of Chicago's conserva
tive law school, is much more difficult to peg polit
ically. While he said he is a registered Democrat,
pro-choice and pro-affirmative action, he also sup
ported the nominations of Robert Bork and
Antonin Scalia — former faculty members at
Chicago's law school with whom he is on a first
name basis — to the Supreme Court.

'If Stanford wanted a miracle
worker, they should have looked
for somebody else.'
— Gerhard Casper

But colleagues say the apparent paradox merely
reflects Casper's independent mind and resistance
to labeling. "Gerhard has always kept his distance
from politics," Epstein said. "One of the things he
has always said to me is that two of the most tired
and overused words in the English language are
liberal and conservative."
On multicultural issues Casper appears to be
proceeding cautiously, taking care not to alienate
anyone. "Many people believe that Stanford, in
talking so openly about the issues that get bundled
up into 'multiculturalism,' has been very coura
geous," he said, adding that he agrees "these are
absolutely important issues."
Casper has been a strong critic of "the moralism
associated with what is called 'PC' " and the dan
gers to freedom presented by "peer pressure."
Asked his impressions of Stanford's residential
education system, which has been accused of tak
ing an intrusive role in the lives of students, Casper
said, "It is too early even to attempt an answer to
that question."
To answer it, he said he plans to "go out this fall
and visit a lot of residence halls" and determine
whether students feel pressured.
Casper said he does not plan to make an issue of
Stanford's controversial speech code, which pro
hibits fighting words based on gender, race or sex
ual orientation. Many who oppose the code had
been hopeful that Casper, who has said a number
of times that speech should not be "criminalized"
or hindered by limits, would also oppose it.
But after examining the code over the summer,
he concluded: "I think on the whole the provisions
seem to be narrowly tailored and the fighting
words doctrine is something that is, of course, well
established in law. I think that while it may be use
ful — and I hope that I would have discussions with
faculty and students over the next few months
about the speech code — I do not at present plan to
raise the issue myself in any major way."
Casper's personality is a sharp contrast to
Kennedy's, an energetic advocate of Stanford
sports who once donned his Speedos to pose for a
group picture after the men's swim team won the
1986 national championship.
A deeply private man with an air of European
formality, Casper is more familiar with art, opera
and literature than spectator sports.
But Casper, like his predecessor, vows to ride his
bicycle to work and has been attending football
games each Saturday afternoon. "Stanford is very
distinguished in athletics, and I am fully prepared
to enjoy that aspect of Stanford life," Casper said.
"I'm sure Stanford has less to learn from me than
I have to learn from it."

He seems to be picking it up quickly. At Satur
day's game against San Jose State, Casper was
spotted on the sidelines in a red Stanford cap,
cheering lustily after each touchdown. After the
game, he pedalled away on a black 10-speed.
Epstein predicted that Casper would soon mas
ter the intricacies of football, and even grow to
appreciate it as much as the intellectual pursuits
that are his first loves. "He will find something
philosophical about the game which will interest
him," Epstein said. "My guess is he and (head foot
ball coach Bill) Walsh will get along just fine."
Speaking of the qualities that he would bring to
Stanford, Casper said in his first press confer
ence last March: "There's a never-ending sur
prise to the kinds of questions a lawyer can come up
with."
That tendency to avoid dogmatism and think
critically about every issue is a central part of
Casper's personality. He dislikes "pat answers,"
Epstein said, and is "very uneasy with things like
party platforms, where you have to take everything
if you take anything."
But in the sensitive months that followed
Casper's appointment as president, when each of
his comments was carefully scrutinized for clues to
his temperament, he found that sometimes, that
skill could be a liability.
Casper at first refused to rule out the possibility
of ending the need-blind admissions policy, and in
mid-April gave a speech asking difficult questions
about the overburdened financial aid system. He
suggested long-term remedies as drastic as lowering
tuition dramatically and cutting all financial aid.
Jolted by his remarks, nervous students started
a letter-writing campaign urging him to retain the
need-blind admissions policy. Casper, who says he
was always firmly committed to retaining the poli
cy, believes their reaction was rooted in the com
munity's unfamiliarity with his style.
"People are kind of surprised about my law pro
fessor ways of doing things — I'm so used to throw
ing out hypothetical," he said. "But people will get
used to it and I will understand it when I pay too
high a cost for it, as I did with the need-blind admis
sion issue."
Casper's profound distrust of bureaucracy and
over-regulation will be a hallmark of his pres
idency. He estimated that 80 percent of the
growth in the University of Chicago's bureaucracy
could be attributed to government regulations that
required things like "more accountants." He sus
pects that the numbers are similar at Stanford, and
he intends to consistently speak out against it.
"Teaching, learning and research are all activi
ties that need a lot of breathing space," he said.
"Bureaucracy, government regulation and academ
ic freedom are in a natural tension with one anoth
er to some extent. Therefore one has to be wary of
everything we add in terms of regulation — either
by the government or what we add by ourselves."
Casper's streamlining of the University's top
administration this month reflects his dislike of

bureaucracy, and provides an indication of how he
will manage a university as sprawling and diverse
as Stanford.
Casper said he likes "a lot of give and take" and
"very open discussions on a fairly informal basis"
with his staff — something he said was not possible
with an administration so large.
He also plans to delegate much more authority to
lower-level staffers. "He doesn't insist on making
decisions if others can make them just as well," Baird
said. "He's not someone who's a micromanager."
When Casper moved from Chicago's law school
and took the job as provost, Epstein said, he
switched his focus from "law issues" to studying
"university education in the grand style" and exam
ining ways to run a complex organization.
"He has thought about administration,"
Epstein said. "He has a good sense of what bureau
cracy should look like — in the good sense of the
word, the Weberian sense — and how it functions.
He treats it as a science."
Casper's deregulatory stance will also affect how
he approaches Stanford's indirect-cost negotia
tions with the federal government.
The new president said he will only consider the
ongoing negotiations with the government a success
if they lead to simpler rules that reduce the burden
placed on "Stanford and its sister universities."
The rules for indirect-cost recovery are now so
complicated that they "read like the Internal Rev
enue code" and drive up the cost rate because "we
add to overhead" in complying with them, Casper
said. "But if the rules were to be very straightfor
ward and if we did not need a lot of staff to support
them, then the rate could be toward the lower end."
The excessive regulations imposed by the govern
ment are the real conflict, Casper said. "It's not
about whether the expenses of the president's house
are charged to it. That was a relatively miniscule
amount. These are the issues that really matter."
