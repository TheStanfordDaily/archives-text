# Zulu leader breaks off talks
## After strong start, South African negotiations in jeopardy 
### 
KWAMASHU, South Africa
(AP) — The country's second
most powerful black leader broke
off talks with the government yes
terday, dampening hopes that
South Africa's political crisis can
be resolved soon.
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, head of
the Zulu-dominated Inkatha Free
dom Party, made the announce
ment a day after his rival, African
National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela, met President F.W. de
Klerk in a promising bid to restart
black-white negotiations.
There is little chance of a
breakthrough without
Buthelezi's participation.
In what was seen as the most
positive development in three
months, Mandela and de Klerk
met Saturday and said they made
substantial progress toward
restarting negotiations the ANC
broke off in June over mounting
political violence.
They announced one agree
ment to free 150 imprisoned

activists Monday. They include
Barend Strydom, a white
supremacist who gunned down
eight people, and Robert Mcßride,
an ANC member who planted a
car bomb that killed three people.
About 300 more will be freed by
mid-November.
They also called for restric
tions on carrying weapons and for
fences to be placed around
migrant workers' hostels. The
measures were seen as ANC victo
ries over Inkatha because Inkatha
supporters control many hostels
and insist on carrying traditional
weapons.
The ANC-Inkatha feud is con
sidered the main cause of town
ship warfare that has claimed
8,000 black lives in the past three
years.
Buthelezi, in an angry speech
at a Zulu rally, said he and his
Zulu followers had not been con
sulted and therefore would not
abide by agreements reached
between de Klerk and Mandela.

"My view is that negotiation
for the future constitution for
South Africa cannot go ahead,"
Buthelezi told 10,000 cheering
supporters in KwaMashu, a black
township outside the eastern port
city of Durban.
"I will withdraw. . .from fur
ther discussions with the govern
ment until I have had the oppor
tunity to consult widely on the
way forward," he said.
Inkatha "will reject any
attempt by Mr. de Klerk and Mr.
Mandela to prohibit Zulus from
carrying cultural weapons,"
Buthelezi said, adding his follow
ers "will tear down any fences put
around (hostels) — and do so with
their bare hands if need be."
De Klerk and Mandela both
said Buthelezi misinterpreted the
nature of their meeting and
would be welcome at negotiations.
' 'Nothing can be resolved if we
don't involve other political play
ers," Mandela said on state televi
sion.
