# Yeltsin issues privatization vouchers

### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Russian
President Boris Yeltsin hopes
that by launching a massive pri
vatization campaign this week he
can jump-start his stalled reform
program and boost his sagging
popularity.
Starting Thursday, the pro
gram will give each of Russia's
148 million citizens vouchers
equivalent to 10,000 rubles — $40
— to buy shares of state-owned
businesses and factories.
"The privatization program is
the centerpiece of the govern
ment's economic program," said
Anatoly Chubais, chief of the
voucher campaign.
However, only a small, as yet
sketchily defmed fraction of Rus
sia's state-owned industry will be on
the block. Directors of the largest
factories and businesses either have

blocked privatization of their enter
prises, or taken them private before
the vouchers were issued.
"Of course it will benefit the
president and the government,
but most important, it will benefit
the people of Russia who will get
some property," Chubais said
during a lull in parliamentary
debate on the plan Friday.
At the height of that debate,
frustrated hard-liner Mikhail
Chelnokov ran from the podium
and threw a handful of vouchers
at Chubais.
"I refuse to accept them!"
shouted Chelnokov.
The hard-liners are demanding
the resignation of Yeltsin and the
architect of his reforms, Acting
Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar,
whom they accuse of impoverish
ing the country on orders from

the West.
The vouchers will allow Rus
sians to buy stock in state-owned
enterprises, increasing their
interest in how these businesses
are managed. Reformers hope
that will swell the ranks of Rus
sia's tiny middle class, and stimu
late interest in the politics of
building a market economy.
The voucher plan ultimately
could decrease the political influ
ence of bureaucrats, factory and
collective farm chairmen who are
blamed for impeding the reforms.
Yeltsin's reforms have increased
prices by as much as 1,500 percent
since January. And 42 percent of
Russians think the reforms have
damaged their living standards sig
nificantly, according to a poll pub
lished last week by the daily Izves
tia newspaper.
