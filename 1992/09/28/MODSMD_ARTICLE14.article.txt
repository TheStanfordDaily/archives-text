During these cynical times
the objective truth relies
heavily on interpretation

IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS when
men were men and Russians were
the enemy, people turned to news
papers for the Truth.
But in today's international — and
cynical — world, no individual or insti
tution, including the media, can claim
to have a monopoly on the Truth.
The past few years have been
tumultuous ones for the American
mind. Many of the reference points for
our media-defined reality came tum
bling down shortly after the Berlin
Wall. The fall of the Soviet Union
eliminated the enemy against which
we defined ourselves for decades, and
the proliferation of government scan
dals have made many people question
the accuracy of the information they
receive.
The press has not escaped this
scrutiny.
In the past few years, Americans
have become far more savvy in evalu
ating the media's influential role in
politics on both the local and global
scale. And this familiarity has bred
contempt.
The American populace no longer
believes everything it reads, and many
now view the press as a co-conspirator
with the government — or a demon
unto itself.
It is to this informed, and some
what cynical, audience that newspa
pers must turn their attention. Our
challenge of the '90s will be to deliver
a product that describes reality with
out purporting to define it.
While all newspapers aspire toward
objectivity, this concept must be rede
fined to retain any meaning in a mod
ern, pluralistic society.
Compare the coverage of a single
issue in any major papers on a given
day. Chances are, an "objective" arti
cle published in The New York Times
will have a different angle than ones
appearing in the Village Voice or the
Christian Science Monitor.
These disparities do not invalidate
the stories. Rather, they're the neces
sary result of journalists interpreting
the facts differently. And in an era
that boasts the most diverse pool of

journalists in history — at Stanford as
well as elsewhere — interpretations
are likely to differ vastly.
Although it may be possible to
report simple facts without bias, facts
without context are meaningless. And
context can only be provided through
the prism of human experience — a
necessarily flawed lens.
Herein lies the challenge of journal
ism.
When University President Ger
hard Casper announced the details of
administrative restructuring a few
weeks ago, the campus was given the
facts. But the facts alone said little.
Many of us were left wondering what
it all meant.
That's where The Daily comes in.
As journalists, it's our professional
duty to continually ask "Why?" Like
small children questioning their par
ent-enforced bedtime, we refuse to
take "because I said so" for an answer
— a policy that does little to augment
our popularity on campus.
But journalists have never been
popular. Nor should they be.
Our mission as reporters is not to
make friends out of our sources, but to
do our best to cover the community
fairly, without playing favorites — or
asking favors.
Our promise to the community is
that we'll provide readers with the
tools they need to make informed deci
sions about campus issues. We'll
report the news honestly and accu
rately, recognizing our own biases
where they exist and balancing them
with alternative viewpoints.
But we also recognize that in some
ways, we are doomed to fail; we cannot
provide you with definitive answers or
black-and-white statements.
So what we ask for in return is a lit
tle effort on your part. As an informed
member of the Stanford community,
you shouldn't allow yourself to be a
mere receptacle for information.
Rather than passively absorbing the
news we present, I invite you to chal
lenge what you read on our pages.
Absorb it, analyze it and above all,
question it.
I'm sure I'll be hearing from you.
