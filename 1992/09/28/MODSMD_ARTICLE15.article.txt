Axe the Tree, make way for Pioneer

A MASCOT, ACCORDING TO FUNK
and Wagnalls, is "a person, animal,
or anything thought to bring good
luck by its presence." To me, it should be
symbolic of challenge, determination,
fighting with vision or, colloquially, "a
scraper."
With all due respect to our tree, which
is beautiful on our seal as it stands for
strength, growth and endurance — it
doesn't fit the definition of a mascot. I
have difficulty shouting "go get them
trees" at a football game. Perhaps I should
be singing, "Hail, Stanford Sequoia."
I also have trouble with being a Stan
ford Cardinal even though I wear dark
red to the games, sing "The Cardinal is

Waving," and like our school colors very
much.
Yes, you guessed it! I was a die-hard
for the Stanford Indian mascot. I wore
the Indian as an accessory on my clothes.
He was on my book covers, binders, in
The Daily, and chanted about at games.
I have grown to realize a better choice
of mascot could have been made. I am
pleased with Stanford's image of holding
a large Native American Pow Wow every
year to bring together Native American
cultures, develop roots and tribal her
itage. I no longer want to be a Stanford
Indian.
The Centennial year made me grateful
to Governor and Mrs. Leland Stanford. It

has brought into focus for me their vision
to create a great university — a Harvard
of the West — and to create it on the
Farm. Then they convinced young educa
tors to come West and join the challenge.
This group of scholars to come west with
David Starr Jordan truly were pioneers.
As the second century is here, I marvel
at the other pioneers who have come as
educators or students to attend our
school — the Hewletts, Packards, Ter
mans of my generation and the Olympic
competitors of the current one: We are
the pioneers of today and tomorrow —
THE STANFORD PIONEERS!
