## Condoleezza Rice Republicanism: the right choice now 
### 
The following is an excerpt from
Condoleezza Rice's address to the Repub
lican National Convention on August 17,
1992. Rice is an associate professor in the
department of political science, and for
mer advisor to President Bush on Soviet
affairs and arms control.

Today we hear
much about the
need for change.
But unless change is firm
ly grounded in our values,
we will confuse our allies
and embolden our foes.
The post-Cold War world
is safer. But great dangers
still abound. As the com
munity of peaceful states

grows, the outlaws — from Baghdad to Bel
grade — are becoming more desperate.
Our past provides an important princi
ple for our future. In 1945, the American
economy was the only one left standing.
But we understood that economic growth
could not be sustained or protected in iso
lation. That is why George Bush has
worked against the odds to open new mar
kets abroad, and to forge new trade agree
ments that provide jobs at home.
Today, it is only natural to reflect on
the strengths — and problems — of our
own democracy at home.
Throughout the Cold War, America
sent a message to captive nations so loud

and so clear that even the KGB could not
jam it.
Communism died because it trusted
the state to be all knowing and made the
bureaucrat omnipotent. It exalted the
society but despised the human being, the
family and the community. Communism
did not trust — and thus could not tap —
the power of the individual.
We Republicans believe that the indi
vidual is the locomotive of human compas
sion and human progress. We know that
reliance on the government is the last
resort, not the first.
Our founding fathers believed that a
great nation could be forged from many
people. Citizenship comes not from mem
bership in an ethnic group, but from an
allegiance to an ideal.
Here at home, when the founding
fathers said "we the people," they did not
mean me. To them, my ancestors were
property. My first trip to Washington,
D.C. was a stop over on the way from
Alabama to New York.
In those days black families could not
find lodging along the highways of the
deep south. So, fellow delegates, I do not
look at America through innocent eyes.
But I do believe that our's is a country
that wrestles with the practical meaning
of our principles.
The Republican Party in its first plat
form in 1856, called upon the nation to
abolish slavery and make "we the people"

an inclusive concept. While we are proud
of our individual cultures, we know that
America's greatest potential lies in a unit
ed future.
Democracy, however, is hard. It is hard
to balance the will of the msyority and the
rights of the minority. But we know that
democracy is a living and evolving system
of governance. Better than any other way
of life, it can cope with change.
It is from this belief that the American
spirit sings. Sometimes that spirit
responds as neighbors helping neighbors.
Sometimes the American spirit can be
seen in triumphs like Desert Storm.
But sometimes the American spirit
finds its clearest reflection in the eyes of
those still seeking democracy's promise.
In 1989, I was privileged to stand in
Gdansk, Poland — the birthplace of Soli
darity — as President Bush spoke to
70,000 Polish citizens. I can still hear
them chanting, "Bush, Bush, Bush. Free
dom, Freedom, Freedom." How proud I
was to work for George Bush. How proud
I was to be an American.
Through their eyes, we can see that
much of America's greatness is in her
generosity.
We can rise above our own doubts to
thank God that we live in this great land.
We can know the power of our beliefs and
find the strength to make a better Ameri
ca as we have made a better world.
Elect George Bush. God Bless America.
