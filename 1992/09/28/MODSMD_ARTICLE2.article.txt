# Casper shrinks Stanford administration
## Total number of top University bureaucrats reduced as first move 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Hoping to deliver a powerful mes
sage about the centrality of teaching
and research — and at the same time
begin untangling the bureaucratic
web of Stanford's top administration
— University President Gerhard
Casper announced a major adminis
trative streamlining program this
month.
Responding to growing faculty crit
icism of the administration's size and
corporate-style complexity, Casper
reduced the number of vice presidents
to four, down from 10 under former
president Donald Kennedy.
He also created a new position to
direct institutional planning, and
reinstated the position of library
director.
"This is an excellent first move,"
said Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare,
who chaired a Faculty Senate com
mittee last year that recommended
shrinking the administration. "It sig

nals a different way that the Univer
sity might be run."

Many faculty had worried that
Stanford's academic mission — and
their voice in University policy — was
becoming increasingly overshadowed
during the 1980s by a top-heavy
administration.
Those fears were one of Casper's
considerations as he looked for ways to
streamline the administration. "I
wanted to make it simpler," he said,
"and I also wanted to make sure that
symbolically the administrative orga
nization shows that we are primarily
here to support the teaching and

research of both faculty and students."
The restructuring also reflects
Casper's informal management btyle,
he said in a Sept. 9 statement
announcing the moves. "I have found
that the give and take I like among
senior staff and officers occurs more
easily if the group is relatively small
and consultations can be kept very
informal," he said.
Most faculty members applauded
the restructuring, the first major
action of Casper's presidency. It con
tinues the move toward strengthen
ing academic governance begun by
Kennedy, who two years ago estab
lished as Stanford's highest policy
making body a cabinet consisting
mainly of the academic deans.
"It's giving the University back to
the faculty," said Art History Prof.
Albert Elsen, consistently a strong
critic of the administration. He added
that the moves would quell the facul
ty's "severe" distrust of the adminis
tration and return Stanford to "a
good, rigorous academic course."

Casper said the restructuring is
also intended to signal the federal gov
ernment that Stanford is cleaning
house in the wake of the indirect-cost
controversy.
The statement announcing the

restructuring said it r
would create "clean- !
er lines of authority" |
that would improve ■
the University's I
"internal controls."
"I obviously want- i
ed the government to ■
understand that I
point," Casper said. I
"I thought it was

worth saying because of the at times
fairly acrimonious relationship"
between Stanford and the govern
ment.
The moves eliminate two vice
presidential positions — public
affairs and planning and manage
ment — and strip the general counsel
