# Fire, fiscal plans and foregone perks: A summer recap
## 
### 
JUNE
• Keith Archuleta, former assis
tant dean of students, was sen
tenced to four years probation and
200 hours of community service
for secretly videotaping women as
they changed clothes in his Mir
rielees Resident Fellow apartment.
Archuleta pleaded no contest
to two misdemeanor counts of
electronic eavesdropping at his
arraignment in Santa Clara
County Municipal Court in Palo
Alto.
He was arrested by Stanford
Police in early June for covertly
videotaping women as they posed
for still photographs at his resi
dence. Videotapes confiscated
from his apartment showed
women fully clothed, partially
clothed and nude, according to a
Stanford police report.
According to Supervising Dis
trict Attorney Margo Smith,
Archuleta videotaped a total of 11
women. Six women, including one
University staff member, pressed
charges.
Police first learned about the
taping after one of the victims, a
female student living in Mir
rielees, stole some of the videocas
settes and gave them to the police.
According to the report,
Archuleta asked the woman, an
acquaintance of his, to pose for a
still photo session at his apart
ment.
Archuleta told her that the
photographs would in used in a
portfolio of black women he was
compiling.
During the photo session, the
victim noticed a video camera sit
ting on top of a television in the
room.
As the shoot progressed, the
victim noticed that the camera
was being repositioned by
Archuleta as she changed poses,
allowing the camera a full view of
her exposed undergarments.
The decision to try the case as a
misdemeanor rather than a felony
was motivated by Archuleta's
cooperation with police as well as
a desire to prevent the victims
from having to testify, Smith said.
"It was just kind of like a Peep
ing Tom," she added.
Archuleta admitted to The
Daily in June that he had a "prob
lem," and said he would seek psy
chological counseling.
Smith, who prosecuted the
case, said one of the victims told
her that placing Archuleta in jail
would be a "waste of his abilities."
He faced a maximum penalty
of two years in jail and a $5,000
fine for the two counts.
Archuleta, an 11-year Univer
sity employee, was also director of
the Black Community Services
Center. He resigned June 2 after
his arrest.
• In order to cope with a pro
jected two-year $125 million bud

get shortfall, trustees approved a
debt financing plan that signifi
cantly increases the endowment
payout rate and calls for borrow
ing more than $45 million.
The plan was a marked depar
ture from past short-term budget
remedies, which have relied on
spending unrestricted reserves.
The $125 million deficit was
projected for the 1992 and 1993
fiscal years, when the Universi
ty's $43 million deficit-reduction
plan — which calls for significant
administrative and academic bud
get cuts — will be implemented.
Large one-time expenditures,

such as a staff early retirement
program and expenses related to
improving the University's cost
accounting systems, added to the
shortfall, said Chief Financial
Offer Peter Van Etten.
The financing plan provided
the "breathing room needed to
implement the budget cuts. . .in
phases instead of immediately,"
Van Etten said. "That gives us
important stability in preserving
academic programs and jobs."
The endowment payout rate —
the amount of interest used as
operating budget revenue — will
increase by 2 percent, from 4.75

percent to 6.75 percent, for the
next two years and generate an
additional $44 million.
University Budget Director Tim
Warner said the payout rate was
able to be temporarily increased
because of "superior returns in the
1980s."
The financing program,
approved by trustees at their
June meeting, also calls for the
spending of $15 million from
unrestricted reserves.
Budget planners must still
identify an additional $21 million
to cover the remainder of the
$125 million shortfall.

JULY
• Silicon Valley venture capi
talist John Freidenrich took over
as president of the Board of
Trustees July 1, predicting that
this year will present a "challeng
ing" transition for the University,
but adding that it would also be a
"rewarding" experience.
Freidenrich replaced James
Gaither, who has headed the board
since 1988. Gaither decided not to
run for re-election this year, after
serving three one-year terms.
Freidenrich, who has been a
board member since 1987, earned

two degrees from Stanford — a
B.A. in economics in 1959 and a
law degree in 1963.
Freidenrich was national co
chair of the mcgor gifts committee
of the University's five-year Cen
tennial Campaign, which raised
nearly $1.3 billion.
• More than 25 men who had
hoped to live in the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity house this year were
forced to change their plans when
the University announced that the
fraternity will lose its house for at
least one year because members
failed to attract enough people to
fill it.

The fraternity has become a co
ed, University-operated house
this year, open to students on the
waiting list. The 26 men slated to
live in the 38-bed house will be
guaranteed housing through the
waiting list, housing officials said.
"The University needs to
receive that revenue," said Janyce
Prothro, assistant director of the
Row. "Whether the University
was in a budget crunch or not, the
concern is we've got a house left
(partially) empty."
Beta President Kurt Hurtado
said fraternity members are "opti
mistic" that they will be able to

restructure the fraternity during
the next year and reclaim the
house.
• A 500-acre brush fire swept
across the Foothills behind cam
pus July 10, threatening numer
ous buildings and sending thick,
dark clouds of smoke into the air
over campus.
The blaze, the largest in the
Foothills since a July 1985 fire
that damaged 16 homes, began
near the Dish at 2:15 p.m. on a
hot and windy afternoon.
No structures were damaged
and no injuries were reported dur
ing the fire, which was controlled

by more than 100 local firefighters
at 6:15 p.m., according to Palo Alto
Battalion Chief Nick Marinaro.
But during the course of the
afternoon, more than 200 resi
dences and University buildings
were evacuated.
The cause of the fire has not
yet been determined, but investi
gators have not ruled out a con
nection to a rash of summertime
arson fires in the Woodside area.
The blackened hills over campus
should not last for long, said Stan
ford Fire Marshal Ray Gamma. He
expects them to be restored and
green by early next winter.

AUGUST
• Suffering from the aftermath
of budget cuts, Cowell Student
Health Center administrators
decided to discontinue pediatric
services Aug. 1, planning instead
to use a more affordable clinic on
Welch Road to provide children's
health services.
The Medical School's Faculty
Practice Program, which provided
pediatric services at Cowell, said
that it would reduce its hours to
only about 10 a week because
there were not enough patients to
sustain the program financially.
Instead of accepting the cut
back in hours, which would crip
ple Cowell's ability to provide ade
quate care on demand for younger
patients, the center's administra
tors opted to dissolve its pediatric
services completely.
• Bob Hamrdla, the long-time
assistant to former University
President Donald Kennedy, left
Stanford at the end of August to
become the executive director of
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraterni
ty.
Hamrdla was an SAE as a
Stanford undergraduate, and was
the chapter's adviser from 1971 to
1985.
• Searching for someone with
the "wide Stanford experience" he
lacks, President Gerhard Casper
named former Dean of Under
graduate Admissions Jean Fetter
as his assistant.
The popular Fetter, who has
held administrative positions at
the University for the last 17
years, began her new job Sept. 1,
the same day Casper took over as
president.
Fetter has been on sabbatical
for the past year, writing a book
on undergraduate admissions.
She served as the executive vice
chair of the search committee
that selected Casper.
• While Stanford Bookstore
managers lost several of their
pricey company cars over the
summer, senior store employees
were given salary increases to
make up for their forfeited
perquisites.
The store's board of directors
disposed of many of the perks pre
viously provided to top employees
and outlined reforms for the
Bookstore's governance. The
board also decided to retain all the
current management, according
to Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, the
board's spokesperson.
The salaries of Eldon Speed
and Phillip Chiaramonte, the
store's top two managers, were
also increased. Weisberg added
that the increase was "less than
what we think (was) the value of
the perquisites they (gave) up."
Weisberg would not reveal the
amount of the salary adjustments.

A lone firefighter works to contain the 500-acre brushfire that seared through the Foothills July 10. The cause of the fire was never deter
mined, but investigators have not ruled out a connection to a rash of summertime arson fires In the Woodside area.
"We are not going to be disclosing
publicly financial details of the
Bookstore," he said.
The California Attorney Gen
eral's office is currently investi
gating the store's compensation
practices. The office expects to
finish its investigation this
month.
The investigation was
prompted by a report in The
Daily last spring that the Book
store provided its senior employ
ees with a host of lavish
perquisites unheard of elsewhere
in the college-bookstore indus
try.
The perquisites included the
use of a $50,000 motor home, a
store-owned sailboat and a vaca
tion home, which the Bookstore
had furnished with a jacuzzi and
satellite dish.
SEPTEMBER
• A long-time University

steam-fitter was fatally shot in
the head by his wife Sept. 9 after
a brief altercation in the campus
maintenance area on Bonair Sid
ing Road.
The mid-day shooting victim
was identified by Stanford Police
as Vernon McMullen, 58, of
Menlo Park.
His wife, Ora McMullen, was
arrested at the scene and booked
on charges of murder. Police do
not have a motive, but speculate
that a domestic dispute might
have been a cause.
The murder was the first on
campus in 10 years.
• In what was seen as a pre
liminary victory for Stanford, a
judge earlier this month refused
to grant the Christian Science
Church sole rights to a $97 mil
lion trust that is also being
claimed by the University and a
Los Angeles museum.
U.S. District Judge Edward
Ross scheduled another hearing
on Jan. 28 to determine the fate
of the trust.
At issue is whether the
Boston-based church has met

the requirements of a trust set
up by author Bliss Knapp, his
wife and her sister.
The trio left their combined
estates to the church on the con
dition it publish Knapp's contro
versial biography of founder
Mary Baker Eddy as an "autho
rized" text and display it in
"substantially all" of the
church's reading rooms.
Stanford and the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art were list
ed as secondary beneficiaries and
would split the money if the pro
bate court rules against the
church.
Christian Science officials
contend they have distributed
Knapp's book as required. But
Stanford and the museum dis
pute that.
Knapp's sister-in-law, Bella
Mabury, attended Stanford.

AUGUST
• Suffering from the aftermath
of budget cuts, Cowell Student
Health Center administrators
decided to discontinue pediatric
services Aug. 1, planning instead
to use a more affordable clinic on
Welch Road to provide children's
health services.
The Medical School's Faculty
Practice Program, which provided
pediatric services at Cowell, said
that it would reduce its hours to
only about 10 a week because
there were not enough patients to
sustain the program financially.
Instead of accepting the cut
back in hours, which would crip

services completely.
• Bob Hamrdla, the long-time

the chapter's adviser from 1971 to
1985.
• Searching for someone with

as his assistant.
The popular Fetter, who has
held administrative positions at
the University for the last 17

• While Stanford Bookstore
managers lost several of their
pricey company cars over the
summer, senior store employees
were given salary increases to
make up for their forfeited
perquisites.
The store's board of directors
disposed of many of the perks pre
viously provided to top employees
and outlined reforms for the
Bookstore's governance. The
board also decided to retain all the
current management, according
to Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, the

The salaries of Eldon Speed

A lone firefighter works to contain the 500-acre brushfire that seared through the Foothills July 10. The cause of the fire was never deter

SEPTEMBER
• A long-time University

steam-fitter was fatally shot in

His wife, Ora McMullen, was
arrested at the scene and booked
on charges of murder. Police do
not have a motive, but speculate

have been a cause.
The murder was the first on
campus in 10 years.

U.S. District Judge Edward
Ross scheduled another hearing
on Jan. 28 to determine the fate
of the trust.
At issue is whether the

JUNE
• Keith Archuleta, former assis
tant dean of students, was sen
tenced to four years probation and
200 hours of community service
for secretly videotaping women as
they changed clothes in his Mir
rielees Resident Fellow apartment.
Archuleta pleaded no contest
to two misdemeanor counts of
electronic eavesdropping at his
arraignment in Santa Clara
County Municipal Court in Palo
Alto.
He was arrested by Stanford
Police in early June for covertly
videotaping women as they posed
for still photographs at his resi
dence. Videotapes confiscated
from his apartment showed
women fully clothed, partially
clothed and nude, according to a
Stanford police report.
According to Supervising Dis
trict Attorney Margo Smith,
Archuleta videotaped a total of 11
women. Six women, including one
University staff member, pressed
charges.
Police first learned about the
taping after one of the victims, a
female student living in Mir
rielees, stole some of the videocas
settes and gave them to the police.
According to the report,
Archuleta asked the woman, an
acquaintance of his, to pose for a
still photo session at his apart
ment.
Archuleta told her that the
photographs would in used in a
portfolio of black women he was
compiling.
During the photo session, the
victim noticed a video camera sit
ting on top of a television in the
room.
As the shoot progressed, the
victim noticed that the camera
was being repositioned by
Archuleta as she changed poses,
allowing the camera a full view of
her exposed undergarments.
The decision to try the case as a
misdemeanor rather than a felony
was motivated by Archuleta's
cooperation with police as well as
a desire to prevent the victims
from having to testify, Smith said.
"It was just kind of like a Peep
ing Tom," she added.
Archuleta admitted to The
Daily in June that he had a "prob
lem," and said he would seek psy
chological counseling.
Smith, who prosecuted the
case, said one of the victims told
her that placing Archuleta in jail
would be a "waste of his abilities."
He faced a maximum penalty
of two years in jail and a $5,000
fine for the two counts.
Archuleta, an 11-year Univer
sity employee, was also director of
the Black Community Services
Center. He resigned June 2 after
his arrest.
• In order to cope with a pro
jected two-year $125 million bud

get shortfall, trustees approved a
debt financing plan that signifi
cantly increases the endowment
payout rate and calls for borrow
ing more than $45 million.
The plan was a marked depar
ture from past short-term budget
remedies, which have relied on
spending unrestricted reserves.
The $125 million deficit was
projected for the 1992 and 1993
fiscal years, when the Universi
ty's $43 million deficit-reduction
plan — which calls for significant
administrative and academic bud
get cuts — will be implemented.
Large one-time expenditures,

such as a staff early retirement
program and expenses related to
improving the University's cost
accounting systems, added to the
shortfall, said Chief Financial
Offer Peter Van Etten.
The financing plan provided
the "breathing room needed to
implement the budget cuts. . .in
phases instead of immediately,"
Van Etten said. "That gives us
important stability in preserving
academic programs and jobs."
The endowment payout rate —
the amount of interest used as
operating budget revenue — will
increase by 2 percent, from 4.75

percent to 6.75 percent, for the
next two years and generate an
additional $44 million.
University Budget Director Tim
Warner said the payout rate was
able to be temporarily increased
because of "superior returns in the
1980s."
The financing program,
approved by trustees at their
June meeting, also calls for the
spending of $15 million from
unrestricted reserves.
Budget planners must still
identify an additional $21 million
to cover the remainder of the
$125 million shortfall.

JULY
• Silicon Valley venture capi
talist John Freidenrich took over
as president of the Board of
Trustees July 1, predicting that
this year will present a "challeng
ing" transition for the University,
but adding that it would also be a
"rewarding" experience.
Freidenrich replaced James
Gaither, who has headed the board
since 1988. Gaither decided not to
run for re-election this year, after
serving three one-year terms.
Freidenrich, who has been a
board member since 1987, earned

two degrees from Stanford — a
B.A. in economics in 1959 and a
law degree in 1963.
Freidenrich was national co
chair of the mcgor gifts committee
of the University's five-year Cen
tennial Campaign, which raised
nearly $1.3 billion.
• More than 25 men who had
hoped to live in the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity house this year were
forced to change their plans when
the University announced that the
fraternity will lose its house for at
least one year because members
failed to attract enough people to
fill it.

The fraternity has become a co
ed, University-operated house
this year, open to students on the
waiting list. The 26 men slated to
live in the 38-bed house will be
guaranteed housing through the
waiting list, housing officials said.
"The University needs to
receive that revenue," said Janyce
Prothro, assistant director of the
Row. "Whether the University
was in a budget crunch or not, the
concern is we've got a house left
(partially) empty."
Beta President Kurt Hurtado
said fraternity members are "opti
mistic" that they will be able to

restructure the fraternity during
the next year and reclaim the
house.
• A 500-acre brush fire swept
across the Foothills behind cam

dark clouds of smoke into the air
over campus.
The blaze, the largest in the
Foothills since a July 1985 fire
that damaged 16 homes, began
near the Dish at 2:15 p.m. on a
hot and windy afternoon.
No structures were damaged
and no injuries were reported dur
ing the fire, which was controlled

by more than 100 local firefighters
at 6:15 p.m., according to Palo Alto
Battalion Chief Nick Marinaro.
But during the course of the
afternoon, more than 200 resi

were evacuated.
The cause of the fire has not

photographs would in used in a
portfolio of black women he was
compiling.
During the photo session, the
victim noticed a video camera sit
ting on top of a television in the
room.
As the shoot progressed, the
victim noticed that the camera
was being repositioned by
Archuleta as she changed poses,
allowing the camera a full view of
her exposed undergarments.
The decision to try the case as a
misdemeanor rather than a felony
was motivated by Archuleta's
cooperation with police as well as
a desire to prevent the victims
from having to testify, Smith said.
"It was just kind of like a Peep
ing Tom," she added.
Archuleta admitted to The
Daily in June that he had a "prob
lem," and said he would seek psy
chological counseling.
Smith, who prosecuted the
case, said one of the victims told
her that placing Archuleta in jail
would be a "waste of his abilities."
He faced a maximum penalty
of two years in jail and a $5,000
fine for the two counts.
Archuleta, an 11-year Univer
sity employee, was also director of
the Black Community Services
Center. He resigned June 2 after
his arrest.
• In order to cope with a pro
jected two-year $125 million bud

get shortfall, trustees approved a
debt financing plan that signifi
cantly increases the endowment
payout rate and calls for borrow
ing more than $45 million.
The plan was a marked depar
ture from past short-term budget
remedies, which have relied on
spending unrestricted reserves.
The $125 million deficit was
projected for the 1992 and 1993
fiscal years, when the Universi
ty's $43 million deficit-reduction
plan — which calls for significant
administrative and academic bud
get cuts — will be implemented.
Large one-time expenditures,

such as a staff early retirement
program and expenses related to
improving the University's cost
accounting systems, added to the
shortfall, said Chief Financial
Offer Peter Van Etten.
The financing plan provided
the "breathing room needed to
implement the budget cuts. . .in
phases instead of immediately,"
Van Etten said. "That gives us
important stability in preserving
academic programs and jobs."
The endowment payout rate —
the amount of interest used as
operating budget revenue — will
increase by 2 percent, from 4.75

percent to 6.75 percent, for the
next two years and generate an
additional $44 million.
University Budget Director Tim
Warner said the payout rate was
able to be temporarily increased
because of "superior returns in the
1980s."
The financing program,
approved by trustees at their
June meeting, also calls for the
spending of $15 million from
unrestricted reserves.
Budget planners must still
identify an additional $21 million
to cover the remainder of the
$125 million shortfall.

JULY
• Silicon Valley venture capi
talist John Freidenrich took over
as president of the Board of
Trustees July 1, predicting that
this year will present a "challeng
ing" transition for the University,
but adding that it would also be a
"rewarding" experience.
Freidenrich replaced James
Gaither, who has headed the board
since 1988. Gaither decided not to
run for re-election this year, after
serving three one-year terms.
Freidenrich, who has been a
board member since 1987, earned

two degrees from Stanford — a
B.A. in economics in 1959 and a
law degree in 1963.
Freidenrich was national co
chair of the mcgor gifts committee
of the University's five-year Cen
tennial Campaign, which raised
nearly $1.3 billion.
• More than 25 men who had
hoped to live in the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity house this year were
forced to change their plans when
the University announced that the
fraternity will lose its house for at
least one year because members
failed to attract enough people to
fill it.

The fraternity has become a co
ed, University-operated house
this year, open to students on the
waiting list. The 26 men slated to
live in the 38-bed house will be
guaranteed housing through the
waiting list, housing officials said.
"The University needs to
receive that revenue," said Janyce
Prothro, assistant director of the
Row. "Whether the University
was in a budget crunch or not, the
concern is we've got a house left
(partially) empty."
Beta President Kurt Hurtado
said fraternity members are "opti
mistic" that they will be able to

restructure the fraternity during
the next year and reclaim the
house.
• A 500-acre brush fire swept
across the Foothills behind cam
pus July 10, threatening numer
ous buildings and sending thick,
dark clouds of smoke into the air
over campus.
The blaze, the largest in the
Foothills since a July 1985 fire
that damaged 16 homes, began
near the Dish at 2:15 p.m. on a
hot and windy afternoon.
No structures were damaged
and no injuries were reported dur
ing the fire, which was controlled

by more than 100 local firefighters
at 6:15 p.m., according to Palo Alto
Battalion Chief Nick Marinaro.
But during the course of the
afternoon, more than 200 resi
dences and University buildings
were evacuated.
The cause of the fire has not
yet been determined, but investi
gators have not ruled out a con
nection to a rash of summertime
arson fires in the Woodside area.
The blackened hills over campus
should not last for long, said Stan
ford Fire Marshal Ray Gamma. He
expects them to be restored and
green by early next winter.

AUGUST
• Suffering from the aftermath
of budget cuts, Cowell Student
Health Center administrators
decided to discontinue pediatric
services Aug. 1, planning instead
to use a more affordable clinic on
Welch Road to provide children's
health services.
The Medical School's Faculty
Practice Program, which provided
pediatric services at Cowell, said
that it would reduce its hours to
only about 10 a week because
there were not enough patients to
sustain the program financially.
Instead of accepting the cut
back in hours, which would crip
ple Cowell's ability to provide ade
quate care on demand for younger
patients, the center's administra
tors opted to dissolve its pediatric
services completely.
• Bob Hamrdla, the long-time
assistant to former University
President Donald Kennedy, left
Stanford at the end of August to
become the executive director of
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraterni
ty.
Hamrdla was an SAE as a
Stanford undergraduate, and was
the chapter's adviser from 1971 to
1985.
• Searching for someone with
the "wide Stanford experience" he
lacks, President Gerhard Casper
named former Dean of Under
graduate Admissions Jean Fetter
as his assistant.
The popular Fetter, who has
held administrative positions at
the University for the last 17
years, began her new job Sept. 1,
the same day Casper took over as
president.
Fetter has been on sabbatical
for the past year, writing a book
on undergraduate admissions.
She served as the executive vice
chair of the search committee
that selected Casper.
• While Stanford Bookstore
managers lost several of their
pricey company cars over the
summer, senior store employees
were given salary increases to
make up for their forfeited
perquisites.
The store's board of directors
disposed of many of the perks pre
viously provided to top employees
and outlined reforms for the
Bookstore's governance. The
board also decided to retain all the
current management, according
to Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, the
board's spokesperson.
The salaries of Eldon Speed
and Phillip Chiaramonte, the
store's top two managers, were
also increased. Weisberg added
that the increase was "less than
what we think (was) the value of
the perquisites they (gave) up."
Weisberg would not reveal the
amount of the salary adjustments.

A lone firefighter works to contain the 500-acre brushfire that seared through the Foothills July 10. The cause of the fire was never deter
mined, but investigators have not ruled out a connection to a rash of summertime arson fires In the Woodside area.
"We are not going to be disclosing
publicly financial details of the
Bookstore," he said.
The California Attorney Gen
eral's office is currently investi
gating the store's compensation
practices. The office expects to
finish its investigation this
month.
The investigation was
prompted by a report in The
Daily last spring that the Book
store provided its senior employ
ees with a host of lavish
perquisites unheard of elsewhere
in the college-bookstore indus
try.
The perquisites included the
use of a $50,000 motor home, a
store-owned sailboat and a vaca
tion home, which the Bookstore
had furnished with a jacuzzi and
satellite dish.
SEPTEMBER
• A long-time University

steam-fitter was fatally shot in
the head by his wife Sept. 9 after
a brief altercation in the campus
maintenance area on Bonair Sid
ing Road.
The mid-day shooting victim
was identified by Stanford Police
as Vernon McMullen, 58, of
Menlo Park.
His wife, Ora McMullen, was
arrested at the scene and booked
on charges of murder. Police do
not have a motive, but speculate
that a domestic dispute might
have been a cause.
The murder was the first on
campus in 10 years.
• In what was seen as a pre
liminary victory for Stanford, a
judge earlier this month refused
to grant the Christian Science
Church sole rights to a $97 mil
lion trust that is also being
claimed by the University and a
Los Angeles museum.
U.S. District Judge Edward
Ross scheduled another hearing
on Jan. 28 to determine the fate
of the trust.
At issue is whether the
Boston-based church has met

the requirements of a trust set
up by author Bliss Knapp, his
wife and her sister.
The trio left their combined
estates to the church on the con
dition it publish Knapp's contro
versial biography of founder
Mary Baker Eddy as an "autho
rized" text and display it in
"substantially all" of the
church's reading rooms.
Stanford and the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art were list
ed as secondary beneficiaries and
would split the money if the pro
bate court rules against the
church.
Christian Science officials
contend they have distributed
Knapp's book as required. But
Stanford and the museum dis
pute that.
Knapp's sister-in-law, Bella
Mabury, attended Stanford.

JUNE
• Keith Archuleta, former assis
tant dean of students, was sen
tenced to four years probation and
200 hours of community service
for secretly videotaping women as
they changed clothes in his Mir
rielees Resident Fellow apartment.
Archuleta pleaded no contest
to two misdemeanor counts of
electronic eavesdropping at his
arraignment in Santa Clara
County Municipal Court in Palo
Alto.
He was arrested by Stanford
Police in early June for covertly
videotaping women as they posed
for still photographs at his resi
dence. Videotapes confiscated
from his apartment showed
women fully clothed, partially
clothed and nude, according to a
Stanford police report.
According to Supervising Dis
trict Attorney Margo Smith,
Archuleta videotaped a total of 11
women. Six women, including one
University staff member, pressed
charges.
Police first learned about the
taping after one of the victims, a
female student living in Mir
rielees, stole some of the videocas
settes and gave them to the police.
According to the report,
Archuleta asked the woman, an
acquaintance of his, to pose for a
still photo session at his apart
ment.
Archuleta told her that the
photographs would in used in a
portfolio of black women he was
compiling.
