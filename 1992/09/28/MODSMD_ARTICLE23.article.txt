## No. 19 Cardinal muddles past San Jose State, 37-13 Frosh witness field-goal fest 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
The Stanford defense trampled San
Jose State Saturday on their march to a
third straight victory. But for three quar
ters they must have wondered if the Car
dinal offense planned to join the rank and
file.
In front of a herd of Brannerites still
mistiming their jumps and wondering why
it's not cool to cheer on big third down
plays, the nation's fifth-ranked defense
suffocated the Spartans. San Jose gained
only 185 yards and turned the ball over
five times. Their offense, which had aver
aged 31 points in three previous games,
scored just one late touchdown in Stan
ford's 37-13 victory.
Heralded Spartan quarterback Jeff
Garcia wishes he'd never heard of Palo
Alto. The Cardinal front seven planted his
face in the turf all day long, sacking him
four times and rushing him into three
interceptions.
"Stanford has the best pass rush in the
country. We tried to get (Garcia) protec
tion but we weren't holding it down. Their
rush came after him for four quarters and
they beat him," said San Jose coach Ron
Turner.
"Defensively we're playing as well as
anybody in the country," said Cardinal
coach Bill Walsh, whose 19th-ranked club
improved to 3-1. No argument there. Led
by pre season All-American outside
linebacker Ron George, they have allowed
a mere five touchdowns and an average of
210 yards in four games.
But Walsh's enthusiasm for the play of
the defense has been more than tempered
by an offense continually performing
below expectations. Saturday was no
exception. After being spotted a 7-0 lead by
Vaughn Bryant's interception return for a
touchdown, the offense treated a crowd of
51,000 to a three-quarter-long Paul Stone
house punting exhibition.
A late offensive explosion produced a
seemingly impressive 24-point margin of
victory. But, as was the case in Stanford's
two previous wins, satisfaction was
nowhere to be found in the post game lock
er room. The scoreboard couldn't hide the
fact that the Cardinal has yet to play its
best football.
Walsh knew it. "Offensively we just
didn't function the way we should have.
We misfired far too long. We have to get
into sync and find the right combinations.
We did not make incremental improve
ment today."
Wide receiver Justin Armour knew it.
"We just made stupid mental mistakes out
there. The defense gave us great field posi
tion all day, but dropped passes, fumbles
and penalties kept us from getting in the
end zone."
Defensive lineman Tyrone Parker knew
it. "We're happy that we could put so
much pressure on Garcia. But our goal
was to shut their offense out. It was disap
pointing to let them drive on us so easily
for the last touchdown."
George summed it up. "We're going to
have to play twice as well against Notre
Dame."
Indeed, the going gets much tougher as
Stanford enters the heart of a killer sched
ule. Saturday the Cardinal travels to
South Bend to face the sixth-ranked Fight
ing Irish. Games at No. 11 UCLA and No.
2 Washington add up to a brutal October.
Before the tide of pessimism runs too

high, it's worth noting that Saturday's
game was littered with encouraging per
formances.
• Thanks to the steady foot of freshman
kicker Eric Abrams, Stanford Stadium is
no longer immersed in a collective groan
each time the Cardinal lines up for a field
goal. Abrams hit on all three of his field
goal attempts (28, 29 and 33 yards), and is
now 5 for 6 since replacing shank-prone
Aaron Mills in the second game of the sea
son.
• Tailback Glyn Milburn did nothing to
harm his All-American candidacy, amass
ing 256 all-purpose yards. He scampered
for 81 yards and a touchdown on 17 car
ries. Most impressive, though, were his
five punt returns for a 21.4 yard average.
Aided by Spartan punter Lee Myhre's
lame, low, line-drive style, Milburn played
a major part in the Cardinal's game-long
field position edge.

'We're going to have
to play twice as well
against Notre Dame.'
— Ron George

• Stanford's linemen and linebackers
not only made life miserable for Garcia,
they constantly forced San Jose into pass
ing situations. The Spartans running
game did not work. They gained 45 yards
on 25 carries. The Spartan faithful erupt
ed into cheer after three-yard runs. It was
not pretty.
• The offense put together a mini-high
light show at game's end. Quarterback
Steve Stenstrom started the scoring bar
rage by hitting Armour for a 26-yard
touchdown. Milburn and back-up tailback
Ethan Allen continued the assault on a
worn-out San Jose defense, adding scoring
runs as the final quarter waned.
• Even the much-maligned Mills had a
great day as designated booter of kick-offs.
He drove five kicks into the end zone for
touchbacks, pinning San Jose deep in their
own territory.
• The side-splitting exploits of Mill's
Spartan counterpart should likewise not
escape print. Kicker Joe Nedney actually
had a kick off travel backwards. "I just
mishit it,"he pleaded. Minus two yards.
"Give me 100 more and I could do better
than that one every time." Who couldn't?
One hopes he holds on to his day job.
While the Cardinal may not have given
Lou Holtz a sleepless Saturday night, it
did avenge 1990 Stanford Stadium loss to
the Spartans. In the process, Stanford
ruined Spartan coach Turner's return to
the Farm. Turner motored down 1-280 in
the off-season to take over San Jose's
program after serving under Denny
Green as the Cardinal's offensive coordi
nator.
Injury update: LB Tom Williams
missed the game with a fractured left
shoulder. His replacement, Coy Gibbs, is
still nursing a spring knee injury but
played most of the game. OT Steve Uoyem
left the game in an ambulance suffering
from heat exhaustion. SS Seyon Albert left
the game with a mild case of turf toe, but
should play Saturday.

program after serving under Denny
Green as the Cardinal's offensive coordi
nator.
Injury update: LB Tom Williams
missed the game with a fractured left
shoulder. His replacement, Coy Gibbs, is
still nursing a spring knee injury but
played most of the game. OT Steve Uoyem
left the game in an ambulance suffering
from heat exhaustion. SS Seyon Albert left
the game with a mild case of turf toe, but
should play Saturday.


Al Green — Dally
Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom hands off to All-American Glyn Milburn during the first half of the Cardinal's win
over the Spartans. Milburn gained 82 yards on the day.
The Stanford defense trampled San
Jose State Saturday on their march to a
third straight victory. But for three quar
ters they must have wondered if the Car
dinal offense planned to join the rank and
file.
In front of a herd of Brannerites still
mistiming their jumps and wondering why
it's not cool to cheer on big third down
plays, the nation's fifth-ranked defense
suffocated the Spartans. San Jose gained
only 185 yards and turned the ball over
five times. Their offense, which had aver
aged 31 points in three previous games,
scored just one late touchdown in Stan
ford's 37-13 victory.
Heralded Spartan quarterback Jeff
Garcia wishes he'd never heard of Palo
Alto. The Cardinal front seven planted his
face in the turf all day long, sacking him
four times and rushing him into three
interceptions.
"Stanford has the best pass rush in the
country. We tried to get (Garcia) protec
tion but we weren't holding it down. Their
rush came after him for four quarters and
they beat him," said San Jose coach Ron
Turner.
"Defensively we're playing as well as
anybody in the country," said Cardinal
coach Bill Walsh, whose 19th-ranked club
improved to 3-1. No argument there. Led
by pre season All-American outside
linebacker Ron George, they have allowed
a mere five touchdowns and an average of
210 yards in four games.
But Walsh's enthusiasm for the play of
the defense has been more than tempered
by an offense continually performing
below expectations. Saturday was no
exception. After being spotted a 7-0 lead by
Vaughn Bryant's interception return for a
touchdown, the offense treated a crowd of
51,000 to a three-quarter-long Paul Stone
house punting exhibition.
A late offensive explosion produced a
seemingly impressive 24-point margin of
victory. But, as was the case in Stanford's
two previous wins, satisfaction was
nowhere to be found in the post game lock
er room. The scoreboard couldn't hide the
fact that the Cardinal has yet to play its
best football.
Walsh knew it. "Offensively we just
didn't function the way we should have.
We misfired far too long. We have to get
into sync and find the right combinations.
We did not make incremental improve
ment today."
Wide receiver Justin Armour knew it.
"We just made stupid mental mistakes out
there. The defense gave us great field posi
tion all day, but dropped passes, fumbles
and penalties kept us from getting in the
end zone."
Defensive lineman Tyrone Parker knew
it. "We're happy that we could put so
much pressure on Garcia. But our goal
was to shut their offense out. It was disap
pointing to let them drive on us so easily
for the last touchdown."
George summed it up. "We're going to
have to play twice as well against Notre
Dame."
Indeed, the going gets much tougher as
Stanford enters the heart of a killer sched
ule. Saturday the Cardinal travels to
South Bend to face the sixth-ranked Fight
ing Irish. Games at No. 11 UCLA and No.
2 Washington add up to a brutal October.
Before the tide of pessimism runs too

high, it's worth noting that Saturday's
game was littered with encouraging per
formances.
• Thanks to the steady foot of freshman
kicker Eric Abrams, Stanford Stadium is
no longer immersed in a collective groan
each time the Cardinal lines up for a field
goal. Abrams hit on all three of his field
goal attempts (28, 29 and 33 yards), and is
now 5 for 6 since replacing shank-prone
Aaron Mills in the second game of the sea
son.
• Tailback Glyn Milburn did nothing to
harm his All-American candidacy, amass
ing 256 all-purpose yards. He scampered
for 81 yards and a touchdown on 17 car
ries. Most impressive, though, were his
five punt returns for a 21.4 yard average.
Aided by Spartan punter Lee Myhre's
lame, low, line-drive style, Milburn played
a major part in the Cardinal's game-long
field position edge.

'We're going to have
to play twice as well
against Notre Dame.'
— Ron George

• Stanford's linemen and linebackers
not only made life miserable for Garcia,
they constantly forced San Jose into pass
ing situations. The Spartans running
game did not work. They gained 45 yards
on 25 carries. The Spartan faithful erupt
ed into cheer after three-yard runs. It was
not pretty.
• The offense put together a mini-high
light show at game's end. Quarterback
Steve Stenstrom started the scoring bar
rage by hitting Armour for a 26-yard
touchdown. Milburn and back-up tailback
Ethan Allen continued the assault on a
worn-out San Jose defense, adding scoring
runs as the final quarter waned.
• Even the much-maligned Mills had a
great day as designated booter of kick-offs.
He drove five kicks into the end zone for
touchbacks, pinning San Jose deep in their
own territory.
• The side-splitting exploits of Mill's
Spartan counterpart should likewise not
escape print. Kicker Joe Nedney actually
had a kick off travel backwards. "I just
mishit it,"he pleaded. Minus two yards.
"Give me 100 more and I could do better
than that one every time." Who couldn't?
One hopes he holds on to his day job.
While the Cardinal may not have given
Lou Holtz a sleepless Saturday night, it
did avenge 1990 Stanford Stadium loss to
the Spartans. In the process, Stanford
ruined Spartan coach Turner's return to
the Farm. Turner motored down 1-280 in
the off-season to take over San Jose's
program after serving under Denny
Green as the Cardinal's offensive coordi
nator.
