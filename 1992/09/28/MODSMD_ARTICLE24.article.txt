# Defense comes into its own with 3 ints
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
The emergence of the secondary as
one of deepest and most successful ele
ments of the defense has been crucial to
Stanford's success this season. Against
San Jose State, the defensive backs had
their most impressive showing in 1992,
intercepting quarterback Jeff Garcia
three times.
On the Spartans opening drive,
senior free safety John Lynch estab
lished the tone of the game by picking
off Garcia's third pass and returning it
11 yards to set up the offense at the
Stanford 37-yard line.
"He was trying to throw it away,"
Lynch said, "and he just didn't see me.
1 didn't have to do much."
As one of the older players, Lynch
remembered the losses to San Jose
State in 1989 and 1990. Like the other
veterans, Lynch played with a little
extra intensity to wipe away the bad
memories of those earlier defeats.
"This was an emotional game for
us," he said. "There were a lot of mem
ories in players' guts."
Lynch wasn't the only defensive
back who turned in a big game for the
Cardinal. Junior cornerback Vaughn
Bryant made an interception on the

very next Spartan drive, returning it 28
yards for the first Stanford touchdown.
"The ball was late," Bryant said. "It
wasn't a good throw."
The easy nature of the interceptions
reflected the way in which the front
seven of the defense pressured the
quarterback. Under heavy pressure,
Garcia had little time to find his
receivers and sometimes rushed his
passes.
Lynch gave a lot of credit to the rest
of the defense for making things easier
on the defensive backs. "1 was basically
a spectator today," he said. "The pass
rush and coverage are really starting to
complement each other."
In addition to the three intercep
tions, the secondary generally made
things difficult for the Spartans. Garcia
completed 13 of 28 passes for just 117
yards, most of which came on a late,
meaningless drive in which the sec
ondary played a loose zone defense.
"We got a little complacent on that
last drive," explained Bryant.
For the second straight game, Stan
ford showcased the depth of its sec
ondary. When strong safety Seyon
Albert left the game with a turf toe
strain, senior Billy Wittman stepped
into the game and got an interception of
his own on the second play of the fourth

quarter.
In the previous game, when North
western often lined up with three wide
outs, freshman Kwame Ellis played
extensively and helped the Cardinal
shut down the Wildcat passing game.
"It's something great about our
defense," Lynch said. "Our second
teamers can come in and play well. It
relieves a lot of the pressure, and that's
really big for us."
Heading into the San Jose State
game, Stanford's passing defense was
ranked eighth in the nation, allowing
just 125 yards per game. With its per
formance this past Saturday, the sec
ondary did nothing to hurt its standing.
However, winning games is more
important than posting impressive
statistics for Cardinal defensive backs.
"It doesn't really matter to us," Bryant
said of his highly ranked defense. "It
could be last, as long as we keep win
ning the rest of our ballgames."
Despite four straight impressive per
formances, the Stanford secondary still
has room for improvement. Two prob
lems have been the occasional big play
and the inability of players to contain
their emotions, such as the personal
foul called on Lynch in the first half.
