# Water Polo overwhelms Davis, impressive in preseason action

It is a program steeped in tradition, and it is off to
yet another quick start in 1992.
The Stanford Cardinal water polo team, owner of
six NCAA championships in its illustrious history,
has jumped out to a 6-1 early-season record in its bid
for a lucky seventh.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal opened its campaign
at the UC-Irvine Tournament in the Marian Berge
son Pool in Newport Beach, Calif, on Sept. 18-20.
On the first day, Stanford downed Air Force 13-4
behind three goals apiece from sophomore Wolf
Wigo and freshman Jeremy Laster, who was enjoy
ing a Southern California homecoming. Junior Bill
Maguy added two goals and goalie Larry Bercutt
came up with seven saves to anchor the defense.
The following day, the Cardinal, then second
ranked, suffered its only loss to date at the hands of
No. 4 Pepperdine in an early-morning contest. While
his team came up on the short end of a 6-5 score,
head coach Dante Dettamanti was pleased with his
charges' balanced attack, as five different Stanford
players found the Waves' net.
"In my opinion, we're a top-three team," Detta
manti said. "If we maintain that balance later in the
season, we'll be at least three goals better than Pep
perdine."
Later that day, Stanford rebounded with its
biggest win to date, an 8-4 triumph over third
ranked UC-Irvine. Wigo once again paced Stanford
scorers with four goals, while senior Chip Blanken
horn added two scores of his own.
On the final day of competition, Long Beach State
was the victim of a Stanford rout, as the Cardinal
walloped the 49ers 11-3. Wigo and freshman Josh

Leachman led the scoring parade with two goals
apiece, while Bercutt stopped 10 shots on the Stan
ford net.
Even though it owned a 3-1 round-robin record,
the Cardinal was placed in the fifth-place game
against UC-Santa Barbara late Sunday. There,
behind a three-goal effort by junior Antonio Bus
quets, it emerged with a 12-7 victory over the Gau
chds and a firm standing among the nation's top five
squads.
Last Thursday, the Cardinal picked up where it
had left off, as it enjoyed another romp in its home
opener, a 12-3 decision over Pacific. Senior Chris
Smith, who had missed part of the UC-Irvine Tour
nament for his MCAT medical school admissions
exam, led all scorers with three.
Stanford then extended its mark to its current 6-
1 standing when it trounced UC Davis 14-5 last Sat
urday at deGuerre Pool. Zach Gallagher, replacing
an injured Bercutt, led the way with an outstanding
effort in goal.
Wigo, who had missed the Pacific game with a
shoulder injury, came back to pace the Cardinal
offense with three goals. In all, 11 Stanford players
got into the scoring column as Dettamanti rested his
starters for much of the second half.
The Cardinal will now look for continued success
as it heads into its most crucial stage of the season.
This Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, Stanford hosts
the NorCal Tournament, which features the
nation's top six teams.
Next week, the Cardinal will open its conference
schedule with another Southern California road
trip, as it takes on USC and UCLA. These two con
tests figure to be a strong indication of the postsea
son action to which Stanford water polo players
have now grown accustomed.
