# Soccer rolls on to victory
## Cardinal wins two 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
As matches with several top-20 teams loom on the
horizon, the Stanford women's soccer squad contin
ues its unbeaten season. The Cardinal reached 6-0
with two recent victories.
No. 2 Stanford blanked San Francisco Thursday
and topped Washington 3-1 yesterday. Although the
Cardinal beat the Dons 4-0, coach Berhane Andeber
han was less than satisfied with the team's defense.
"We're not quite where we want to be yet," he said.
"We need to play a little more cleanly, a little more
consistently."
He stressed the need for more disciplined play in
several areas.
"We were a little impatient," he said. "Instead of
playing team defense, each person is individually
doing everything they can now. You have to restrain
yourself from getting in and forcing bad situations.
The Stanford defense was initially shaky against
USF. The squads traded scoring opportunities early
on but by midway through the first half, the Cardinal
defense had stiffened and the Dons rarely penetrated
past midfield.
Meanwhile, the Stanford offense continued a trend
established early this season — scoring often but late
in the game. In six matches, the team has scored once
in the first 20 minutes of the game and nine times in
the last 20 minutes.
Fullback Melinda Minstrell, with assists from for
wards Sarah Rafanelli and Dena Dey, tallied the first
goal against USF early in the second half. Midfielder
Julie Foudy notched another goal seven minutes
later.
The senior had the ball deep in the Dons' zone and
just when it looked like she had run out of room to the
right of the goal, she curved a shot into the upper left
of the net. Fischer and Dey rounded out the scoring
with a goal apiece.
After the game, Andeberhan explained the lack of
first-half goals scored this season.
"We're not an unknown entity anymore," he said.
"Teams are putting a couple of people on Foudy and a
couple on Rafanelli. [Opponents] come in intense
because we're now generally one of the favorites,
whereas before we were a school with a nice name and
mild winters."
To help bolster the offensive attack, Andeberhan
cut back to a three-fullback setup against Washing
ton.
"Three can't cover the full width of the field as well
as four, but we got some advantages because we com
pacted the field," he said. "The defense played well."
The only goal allowed by Stanford resulted from a
penalty kick in the second half. On a scramble in front
of the net, Stanford goalie Leslie Garrard and a Wash
ington attacker got knotted up. The Huskies were

awarded the penalty kick when Garrard was charged
with the foul.
"When the ball was crossed it looked like she was
offsides but I just played the play," Garrard said. "I
went for the ball and she ended up on top of me ... .1
wasn't trying to trip her intentionally but when I
reached for the ball my hands got tangled in her legs
and they called the foul on me."
Team captain Julie Foudy protested the no-call on
the apparent offsides, but to no avail.
"I just thought fthe refereel was missing a lot of
things," Foudy explained. "I'm team captain so I can
tell him that. That's my right and I take it. They tell
me when to shut up."
The Washington goal cut the Cardinal lead to one,
halfway into the period. But the Stanford defense
didn't allow another shot through for the rest of the
game.
"If a penalty kick is the only way they can score,
then the defense is pretty solid," said Garrard.
A few minutes after the Washington goal, Rafanel
li seemed to have an excellent shot near the left goal
post, but instead of taking it, she got the goalie to
commit and then tapped the ball to Johnson who then
scored.
Earlier, Rafanelli opened scoring with a ground
skimming shot 28 minutes into the match. The goal
gave Rafanelli five for the season, tying her with Dey
for the team lead.
While Rafanelli seems to take more punishment
than anyone else on the field, she also dishes it out. In
the USF game, moments after doing a backwards
somersault while battling for the ball, Rafanelli had
possession deep in Don territory. She blasted a cen
tering pass but the ball ricocheted off a USF fullback's
face.
