# Men take tourney

In the world of men's soccer, Maryland-Baltimore
County and Northern Illinois aren't exactly UCLA
and Santa Clara. No. 20 Stanford discovered that for
itself this weekend with two convincing 3-0 victories
at the St. Mary's Tournament in Moraga, Calif.
While neither opponent was expected to pose a
challenge, the wins were still satisfying for the Car
dinal, who bounced back nicely from its 2-0 loss to
lowly Sacramento State Sept. 20.
On Friday, Stanford (6-2 on the season) squared
off against Maryland-Baltimore County in a first
round game.
The contest was never in question. Less than six
minutes into the first half, Jason Vanacour netted
his team-leading fifth goal of the season, on assists
from Randy Mann and Steve Kirshbaum.

Kirshbaum, a freshman midfielder who was mak
ing his first collegiate start, scored his first Stanford
point with the assist. Mann, a senior midfielder and
co-captain, also tallied his first point of the 1992 sea
son.
In the second half, the Cardinal opened up the
match with goals from Lance Killian and Ricky
Goad. Killian was assisted by Vanacour, while Goad
scored on a pass from Ryan Collins.
Yesterday's match against Northern Illinois was
a carbon copy of the Maryland-BC contest. The Car
dinal simply dominated the game, holding an impos
ing 16-1 shots-on-goal advantage overall.
Again, the scoring was balanced. Mann and Kir
shbaum put in their first goals of the season, while
Killian scored his second goal of the weekend in the
second half.
Goalie Kyle Krpata picked up two shutouts on the
weekend, even though the senior was forced to make
only one save through the entire tournament. Krpa
ta has recorded three shutouts in his last four
games, and his goals against average now stands at a
slim 1.29 per game.
Stanford now has a full week to prepare for its
own tournament, the Bank of America Invitational,
which will take place Friday and Sunday at Maloney
Field.
