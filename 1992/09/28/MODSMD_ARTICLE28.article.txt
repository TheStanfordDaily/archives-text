# Runners take off in Fresno opener
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
Even though the Cardinal cross country team has
decided to focus itself more on rebuilding its program
than shooting for the NCAAs, the fall season started
off with a bang.
Both the men's and women's squads took the
team titles in the Fresno Pacific Invitational held on
Saturday at Woodward Park, Fresno.
Stanford runners Gary Stolz and Louise Watson
captured the men's and women's individual titles,
respectively, defeating opponents from several differ
ent California schools, including Cal-Poly San Luis
Obispo and Fresno Pacific.
In his first stint with the Cardinal, Coach Vin
Lananna directed a promising showing in a meet he
deemed would "establish what our team is all about
this season."
The Cardinal men team's finishes were good
enough to topple Cal Poly, the No. 1-ranked Division
II squad, by 10 points. The women's team came in 12
points ahead of Cal Poly.
Stolz, the Cardinal captain and Stanford's hottest
prospect in Pacific 10 Conference competition, fin
ished the mostly dirt-trail course in 25 minutes, 24.4
seconds, six seconds ahead of the first Cal Poly run
ner.
Todd Lewis came in third place with a time of
25:44 for the 8,000-meter course, with Mike Reilly
finishing up in fifth place overall. Brian McCafTery
was the final Stanford runner to place in the top-ten
standings for the invite, crossing the line in ninth
place.
The performance was promising for the Cardinal
runners, who have been putting in high mileage for
the past few weeks. The men's team went to Fresno
after grinding out a 100-mile week, planning to train
through the meet — concentrating instead on the
Cal Poly SLO Invitational in mid-October.
"I'm really excited about this season," Stolz said.
"We weren't too rested and we had no idea who was
in shape, but we did really well. We had a team strat
egy and it worked very well. [Coach Lananna] told us
to hold back for the first two miles, and it's amazing
how it worked."
On the women's side, Watson, a transfer student
from Great Britain, left the competition behind, win
ning in 18:09, 10 seconds ahead of the second-place
Cal Poly runner.
Christina Dehlendorf and captain Sarah Truitt
crossed the line together in fifth and sixth place, with
times of 18:31.1 and 18:32.2, respectively.
Stanford packed the top-10 individual results list
with three more runners, with Laura Hayward, Kay
Luo and Melissa Freeburg ending up in eighth,
ninth, and 10th place, respectively.
"I think we're going to have a hell of a season,"
Stolz speculated. "I think we're going to be a lot bet
ter than people are expecting."
