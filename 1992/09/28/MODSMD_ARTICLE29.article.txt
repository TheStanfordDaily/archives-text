# V-Ball still undefeated

### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
Some teams in the Pacific 10
Conference strive to win as many
games as they lose against confer
ence teams. Others can get
through a season with only two or
three Pac-10 losses.
And then there are some who
haven't lost since 1990.
On Friday, the Stanford
women's volleyball team (8-0
overall, 2-0 in the Pac-10) showed
why.
The Cardinal traveled to Cor
vallis and continued its confer
ence winning streak, sweeping
Oregon State 15-7, 15-2, 15-8 in
its Pac-10 opener.
Senior tri-captain Bev Oden
led the way for the Cardinal, hit
ting .591 with 14 kills, six digs,
and two aces, while Kristi Paaso
rang up a career-high 13 kills and
17 digs.
For the Beavers, Shelley Smith
posted 10 kills and eight digs.
Smith was the only Beaver player
to score double figures in kills.
The following day, Stanford
visited Oregon, where the Cardi

nal easily handled the Ducks (4-7,
0-4) in front of a far-from-sellout
crowd of about 700 at McArthur
Court, 15-7, 15-8, 15-6.
Oden again led the Cardinal
with 14 kills, four digs and three
blocks, while junior hitter Heidi
Gick hit .583 with eight kills.
Laßeina Woods led the Ducks
with nine kills and 11 digs.
Freshman Cary Wendell
turned in a stellar performance
against the Ducks, hitting .429
with 10 kills and 12 digs.
The Cardinal will face its
toughest challenge of the year so
far when it hosts USC and top
ranked UCLA at Maples Pavilion
this Friday and Saturday. Stan
ford has won its last five matches
against USC.
The Cardinal also came out on
top in both regular season match
es against the defending national
champion Bruins last year.
However, UCLA was the last
Pac-10 team to beat the Cardinal
in regular season play — back in
1990. More importantly, Stan
ford will look to avenge last year's
loss to the Bruins in the NCAA
West Regionals.

Ethan Allen rumbles for six of his 20 yards. Allen scored the Cardinal's last touchdown of the day to seal
off the win.
