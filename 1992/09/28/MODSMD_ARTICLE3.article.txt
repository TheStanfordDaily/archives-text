# Athletics Department rejects Band's Casper spoof
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
A halftime show lampooning Stanford's
new president — rejected by the Depart
ment of Athletics last week — may still
spell trouble for Stanford Band announcers
who mentioned it at Saturday's football
game.
After the band's performance, the
announcers told the audience they had just
seen a remake of a 1985 show because the
band had been forbidden to enact "The
Unauthorized Biography of Gerhard
Casper."
Announcers Rajesh Krishnan and Chris
Chow — and possibly the entire Band —
now face suspension for the remark,
according to Band Manager Casey O'Hara.
O'Hara said Assoc. Athletic Director
Tom Beckett told him after the game that
the announcers' last comment about the
Casper show's rejection was "an embar-

rassment" and suggested
they could be suspended.
The original show jok
ingly referred to Casper as a
member of the Chicago
Mafia who "decided to move
in on the turf of his western
rival, Don Don Kennedy."
The situation will prob
ably be discussed today 1
after a Football Operations

Committee meeting, O'Hara said.
He and other band members say they
objected to the original Athletics Depart
ment decision, made last Thursday, to ban
the Casper show.
"They said they would not give us access
to the field if that was our halftime show,"
said Asst. Band Manager Jesse Johannesen,
a senior. Beckett "objected to the premise,"
Johannesen said, and thought the script
ridiculing the new president "would be an
embarrassment."

"We never like to be censored," Johan
nesen added.
But Beckett described the decision as
part of a process where the band and the
Athletics Department work together to
"come up with a show that everyone is going
to be proud of."
He refused to comment specifically on
the script or the controversy over the
Casper show.
Beckett said it became standard practice
for the Athletics Department to review the
Band's plans aftet- a show at the University
of Oregon two years ago.
The Band was suspended for one game
in October 1990 after they parodied the
debate over the endangered spotted owl.
Oregon fans booed the performance, and
the university athletic director asked that
Stanford leave the band at home next year.
While Johannesen conceded that
because Casper is new the Athletics
Department has "a legitimate gripe" about

the show, he also defended it. "Our intent
is never malicious," he said.
The last-minute nix forced the band to
come up with new formations and a new
script, according to Johannesen. "We
expanded on an old idea," he said. "We had
very little time to redo something."
Instead of the Casper spoof, the band
performed "Games People Play," a show
about games people play throughout their
lives, from musical chairs to doctor to quar
ters and finally dominoes. Beckett said he
thought it was a "good show."
The last script rejected last year by the
Athletics Department was about a woman
who had a 300-pound ovarian cyst removed
at Stanford Hospital, Johannesen said.
Both O'Hara and Beckett said the rela
tionship between the band and Athletics
Department has been a good one lately. But
O'Hara added that the reaction to the cyst
