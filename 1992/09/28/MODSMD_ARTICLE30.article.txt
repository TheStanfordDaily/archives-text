# Scalia lectures full house in Dink
## Chief Justice scorns 'excessive use' of legislative history by courts 
### Lenora Chu 
Criticizing the practice of deferring
to "the dead hand of defunct commit
tees of the past," U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Antonin Scalia counseled a full
house in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on the
excessive use of legislative history Fri
day afternoon.
"I have never let legislative history
influence any of my decisions," said
Scalia during his speech, sponsored by
the Stanford Federalist Society.
Scalia, introduced as a "controversial
and sometimes ascerbic speaker,"
played an instrumental role in founding
the society in the early 1980s.
Now a professor at the University of
Virginia and University of Chicago law
schools, Scalia is also a visiting faculty
member at Stanford.
He launched his 45-minute spiel —
titled "Legislative History" — by saying
he was "surprised at the number of peo
ple inclined to spend time in a dark
room on such a lovely day."

He began by describing legislative
history as the intent of the legislatures
and the path a statute travels through
Congress and into the hands of the judi
ciary.
Scalia described law until the 19th
century as a legal culture in which
lawyers made no distinction between
the phrasing of the law and the intent
of the lawmakers.
But legislative history "ought not to
be used," Scalia said. "Why does there
seem to be more reason to ask, 'What
does Congress intend the statute to
mean?' rather than 'What does the
statute mean?' "
Scalia said he advocates government
by legislative text, not legislative inten
tions, agreeing with Justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes' statement: "I don't
care what their intention was, I just
want to know what the words mean."
It "makes no sense that past com
mittees will pass straightjackets" con
fining future judiciaries, he said. A sin
gle remark in a floor statement can for

ever affect the scope of a statute,
according to Scalia.
Paying less attention to legislative
history will give future government
committees more freedom, he said.
The danger, Scalia warned, is that
courts gain power as they pull state
ments out of context and twist "true
intentions" of words. The result of «uch
ambiguity is that courts can pick and
choose what they need out of these
reports to administer law as they see fit.
After concluding his speech, Scalia
opened the floor to questions for about
20 minutes.
Since Scalia is regarded as conserva
tive, one audience member asked why
he sided with the more liberal justices
in voting to overturn a law prohibiting
flag burning.
He said he would have loved to ban
flag burning, but the Constitution did
not allow him to do so. Flag burning is
an issue of freedom of expression rather
than of behavior, he said.
