# Gay, lesbian community boycotts Bank of America
## 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Members of Stanford's gay,
lesbian and bisexual community
are urging new students not to
open checking accounts at Bank
of America because the company
supports an allegedly discrimina
tory organization.
The Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Law Students Association handed
out fliers protesting Bank of
America's support for the Boy
Scouts of America in front of the
bank's table in Tresidder Union

last Thursday and Friday. Mem
bers of the group said they will
continue trying to dissuade new
students from opening accounts
today and tomorrow.
Earlier this year, the bank had
withdrawn its charitable support
of the Boy Scouts after deciding
that the organization's policy of
prohibiting gays from serving as
scoutmasters was discriminatory.
But the bank reversed its decision
in August and decided that the
group is eligible for charitable
donations because all boys are
allowed to join.

Protesters are arguing that the
bank caved in to "right-wing pres
sure" and is funding a discrimina
tory policy.
"People have been fairly
responsive" to the fliers, said Amy
Martolin, a former president of
the Law School student group.
"When given the choice between
two fairly comparable banks in
terms of services, they decide to
bank with somebody who does not
have discriminatory policies."
The association has stationed
two people to hand out fliers in
front of the bank's table from 10

a.m. to 2 p.m. every day during
Orientation, but it decided
against any type of larger, more
vocal protest.
"The Stanford community is
enlightened," Martolin added.
"They do not need it to be shoved
in their faces."
While the protesters said
they believe they have dissuad
ed new students from opening
accounts, bank employees said
there has been little effect on
business.
"I don't know that there has
been any impact," said one

employee who asked that her
name not be used because of the
bank's policy prohibiting workers
from speaking to the press. "We
have opened about 200 accounts
this week, which is pretty normal
for us."
Peter Magnani, a spokesperson
for Bank of America, said the
decision to make the scouts eligi
ble for charitable contributions
has attracted some demonstra
tions from gay groups in San
Francisco, but he said he had not
heard of any protests on college
campuses.
