# New sexual assault prevention head treads choppy water
## 
### Angie Chuang Editorial staff 
As 1992 graduate Caroline
Mitchell takes the reins of the
Sexual Assault Information and
Resource Center, budget cuts cast
a shadow of uncertainty over the
center and its survival.
Mitchell said that while she
plans to maximize her visibility as
coordinator of sexual assault pre
vention education, she is con
cerned about the future of the
center.
"I'm funded through the end of
August, which will make it impos
sible to plan for things like next
year's Orientation," she said.
"There's a lack of continuity. Peo
ple are strapped and scared to
add."
Mitchell takes over the position
— which was established last year
with ASSU funds— from. Susan
Epstein. The ASSU planned to
encourage the University to take
over this year's funding of the cen
ter and its coordinator.
However, citing budget diffi
culties, administrators suggested
alternatives such as finding
donors or channeling Stanford
Directory profits to fund the cen
ters.
Finally, the ASSU decided to
fund the position for another year
through a Coalition Against Sexu
al Assault special fee request for

about $49,000.
Nevertheless, Mitchell said she
is pleased that the University has
decided to fund a second half-time
coordinator, to be chosen in Octo
ber, who will work at the center as
a specialist in response services.
"What Susan (Epstein) did last
year was too much for one per
son," Mitchell said, explaining the
need for a second staffer.
Although the coordinator is "not
specifically a victim advocate,"
Mitchell said, the position's high
visibility drew in victims last year
seeking referrals and counseling.
Mitchell said she is optimistic
about the center's future and the
University's commitment to keep
it alive. "I'm glad to be here and
be affiliated with the University
through Cowell Health Promo
tion," she said.
Incoming University President
Gerhard Casper has shown inter
est in the center and its survival,
Mitchell said. She and Epstein
recently met with Casper to dis
cuss the center and sexual assault
prevention resources on campus.
"He's very knowledgeable
about the issues. He headed a
committee on sexual harassment
at the University of Chicago," she
said.
Despite her optimism about
the University's role in preserving
the center, Mitchell said she
believes "the students shouldn't

be paying for it this year."
She is also concerned about the
impact ASSU student fee refunds
might have on the center's work
ing budget, she said.
However, because the students
are funding her position, she said
she feels "a direct responsibility
to the students and prioritizing
their needs."
"We are searching for possible
resources to fund the center with
budget cuts going on," Mitchell

said. "We're hoping to find some
wonderful donor through alumni
outreach."
Besides searching for funding
options, Mitchell said she has a
full year ahead of her. "There's so
much I want to do," she said.
"The toughest part of the job is
finding the best place to put my
time."
Mitchell said she will focus her
efforts on "giving back to the
Stanford community and Stan
ford women to allow them to edu
cate themselves."
As an undergraduate, Mitchell
was a member of the Rape Educa
tion Project and Women Defend
ing Ourselves. She has taught the
popular Self-Defense for Women
course several times.
"The coordinator position is a
bigger version — a way to reach
more people," she said.
"I was very grateful for the
opportunity to educate myself at
Stanford on sexual assault and all
the related issues. It was the main
focus of my life at Stanford,"
Mitchell said. "The (coordinator)
position presented itself as a per
fect possibility for me."
Mitchell majored in political
science "with a complete bent on
feminist studies." She said she
intends to combine her back
ground in education and sexual
assault prevention resources to
eventually study law with an

emphasis on women's issues.
But for now, Mitchell said she
is looking forward to getting stu
dent input so she can assess their
needs and concerns. "I don't have
a set agenda," she said.
"What is important is that I am
here," Mitchell said. "I am a
resource and I will respond to stu
dent need."
Since the 10-week Self-Defense
for Women course will not be
offered this quarter, Mitchell said
one of her first projects was to
"fill the gap" by expanding the
Self-Defense for Women work
shops.
Three sessions of the workshop
were offered during Orientation
for new students only. The regu
lar workshops will continue this
quarter, but it is likely they will
be longer — two three-hour ses
sions instead of one — according
to Mitchell.
The 10-week course should be
offered again winter quarter, once
it is approved through the Femi
nist Studies Department. Previ
ously, the class was offered
through the Stanford Workshops
on Political and Social Issues, but
the department was axed in last
year's round of budget cuts.
Mitchell said she also hopes to
"reach communities that have not
typically been addressed" regard
ing the issue of sexual assault.
One of her new projects

addresses the issue of responding
to sexual assault victims in a cul
tural context. Each ethnic com
munity has its own cultural tradi
tions and beliefs that affect how it
reacts to a victim of rape, she said.
"For example, in the Asian-
American community there is a
sense of shame when it comes to
talking about body parts and sex,
and in the Native American com
munity there is a skepticism with
the American white system,"
Mitchell said. "All of these can
make it difficult for a victim to
report seek help."
Mitchell said she hopes to con
tact the University's cultural
communities and discuss these
issues. "I'm a white woman so I'm
not versed to tell them anything,"
she said. "But I have a lot of liter
ature and I hope to work with
them to create a discussion."
Another community Mitchell
hopes to reach this year is those
people who have felt excluded
from the issue of sexual assault
prevention. Although backlash
against sexual assault awareness
is "very troublesome," she said
she does not believe it is a mali
cious reaction.
"Those who feel alienated —
not just men — feel that preven
tion and self defense include
male-bashing and attacking,"
Mitchell said. "I hope we can cre
ate a healthy dialogue."

tural context. Each ethnic com
munity has its own cultural tradi
tions and beliefs that affect how it
reacts to a victim of rape, she said.
"For example, in the Asian-
American community there is a
sense of shame when it comes to
talking about body parts and sex,
and in the Native American com
munity there is a skepticism with
the American white system,"
Mitchell said. "All of these can
make it difficult for a victim to
report seek help."
Mitchell said she hopes to con
tact the University's cultural
communities and discuss these
issues. "I'm a white woman so I'm
not versed to tell them anything,"
she said. "But I have a lot of liter
ature and I hope to work with
them to create a discussion."
Another community Mitchell
hopes to reach this year is those
people who have felt excluded
from the issue of sexual assault
prevention. Although backlash
against sexual assault awareness
is "very troublesome," she said
she does not believe it is a mali
cious reaction.
"Those who feel alienated —
not just men — feel that preven
tion and self defense include
male-bashing and attacking,"
Mitchell said. "I hope we can cre
ate a healthy dialogue."


Caroline Mitchell
As 1992 graduate Caroline
Mitchell takes the reins of the
Sexual Assault Information and
Resource Center, budget cuts cast
a shadow of uncertainty over the
center and its survival.
Mitchell said that while she
plans to maximize her visibility as
coordinator of sexual assault pre
vention education, she is con
cerned about the future of the
center.
"I'm funded through the end of
August, which will make it impos
sible to plan for things like next
year's Orientation," she said.
"There's a lack of continuity. Peo
ple are strapped and scared to
add."
Mitchell takes over the position
— which was established last year
with ASSU funds— from. Susan
Epstein. The ASSU planned to
encourage the University to take
over this year's funding of the cen
ter and its coordinator.
However, citing budget diffi
culties, administrators suggested
alternatives such as finding
donors or channeling Stanford
Directory profits to fund the cen
ters.
Finally, the ASSU decided to
fund the position for another year
through a Coalition Against Sexu
al Assault special fee request for

about $49,000.
Nevertheless, Mitchell said she
is pleased that the University has
decided to fund a second half-time
coordinator, to be chosen in Octo
ber, who will work at the center as
a specialist in response services.
"What Susan (Epstein) did last
year was too much for one per
son," Mitchell said, explaining the
need for a second staffer.
Although the coordinator is "not
specifically a victim advocate,"
Mitchell said, the position's high
visibility drew in victims last year
seeking referrals and counseling.
Mitchell said she is optimistic
about the center's future and the
University's commitment to keep
it alive. "I'm glad to be here and
be affiliated with the University
through Cowell Health Promo
tion," she said.
Incoming University President
Gerhard Casper has shown inter
est in the center and its survival,
Mitchell said. She and Epstein
recently met with Casper to dis
cuss the center and sexual assault
prevention resources on campus.
"He's very knowledgeable
about the issues. He headed a
committee on sexual harassment
at the University of Chicago," she
said.
Despite her optimism about
the University's role in preserving
the center, Mitchell said she
believes "the students shouldn't

be paying for it this year."
She is also concerned about the
impact ASSU student fee refunds
might have on the center's work
ing budget, she said.
However, because the students
are funding her position, she said
she feels "a direct responsibility
to the students and prioritizing
their needs."
"We are searching for possible
resources to fund the center with
budget cuts going on," Mitchell

said. "We're hoping to find some
wonderful donor through alumni
outreach."
Besides searching for funding
options, Mitchell said she has a
full year ahead of her. "There's so
much I want to do," she said.
"The toughest part of the job is
finding the best place to put my
time."
Mitchell said she will focus her
efforts on "giving back to the
Stanford community and Stan
ford women to allow them to edu
cate themselves."
As an undergraduate, Mitchell
was a member of the Rape Educa
tion Project and Women Defend
ing Ourselves. She has taught the
popular Self-Defense for Women
course several times.
"The coordinator position is a
bigger version — a way to reach
more people," she said.
"I was very grateful for the
opportunity to educate myself at
Stanford on sexual assault and all
the related issues. It was the main
focus of my life at Stanford,"
Mitchell said. "The (coordinator)
position presented itself as a per
fect possibility for me."
Mitchell majored in political
science "with a complete bent on
feminist studies." She said she
intends to combine her back
ground in education and sexual
assault prevention resources to
eventually study law with an

emphasis on women's issues.
But for now, Mitchell said she
is looking forward to getting stu
dent input so she can assess their
needs and concerns. "I don't have
a set agenda," she said.
"What is important is that I am
here," Mitchell said. "I am a
resource and I will respond to stu
dent need."
Since the 10-week Self-Defense
for Women course will not be
offered this quarter, Mitchell said
one of her first projects was to
"fill the gap" by expanding the
Self-Defense for Women work
shops.
Three sessions of the workshop
were offered during Orientation
for new students only. The regu
lar workshops will continue this
quarter, but it is likely they will
be longer — two three-hour ses
sions instead of one — according
to Mitchell.
The 10-week course should be
offered again winter quarter, once
it is approved through the Femi
nist Studies Department. Previ
ously, the class was offered
through the Stanford Workshops
on Political and Social Issues, but
the department was axed in last
year's round of budget cuts.
Mitchell said she also hopes to
"reach communities that have not
typically been addressed" regard
ing the issue of sexual assault.
