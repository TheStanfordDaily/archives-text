Parties woo Perot supporters
DALLAS (AP) — Bill Clinton and President
Bush are sending their top aides here to woo Ross
Perot's strongest supporters in a remarkable
meeting today that may decide whether the Texas
billionaire confounds their campaign strategies by
re-entering the race with five weeks to go.
The nominees want to bring Perot supporters
into their fold not only by selling Perot's 50 state
coordinators on their respective economic plans,
but also to smooth feelings ruffled after Perot
abandoned his independent bid in July.
"He represents a lot of voters and they're vot
ers we want," White House spokesperson Marlin
Fitzwater said yesterday as Bush continued his
whistlestop tour in Ohio and Michigan. "We're
not going to miss an opportunity to get the mes
sage across."
"I think Ross Perot has some good ideas. I
think they're ideas that both he and Bill Clinton

share," Clinton campaign chairman Mickey Kan
tor said.
Perot says he would re-enter the race if support
ers ask him to, but insists he doesn't want the job.
Candidates on the electoral college
WASHINGTON (AP) — Here are the views of
the presidential nominees on abolishing the elec
toral college:
Bush: "I don't see the sort of clear and com
pelling need for eliminating the Electoral College
that I believe is necessary to propose an amend
ment to the Constitution."
Clinton: "The framers of our Constitution
deliberately created our current system in an
effort to protect the election of the president from
local corruption and narrow political perspectives.
We should not rush to abandon the system the
framers so conscientiously created, but we must
listen carefully to those who say it may be time for
change."
