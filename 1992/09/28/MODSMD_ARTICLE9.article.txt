Poll asks for predictions
NEW YORK (AP) — During the 21st century,
most Americans expect to see cures for AIDS and
cancer, a woman president and more environ
mental disasters, according to a recent poll.
A majority of the 800 Americans questioned
also believe the second coming of Jesus Christ will
occur within the next 1,000 years, according to a
poll by Time magazine and Cable News Network.
The poll was conducted in July for "Beyond the
Year 2000," a special issue of Time exploring
expectations for the 21st century in politics, science
and society. The issue is due on newsstands today.
Given a checklist of possible events in the com
ing century, 75 percent said they expect a cure for
AIDS; 80 percent a cure for cancer and 39 percent
a cure for the cold.
Plane crash in Nigeria kills 163
LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — A military transport
plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Lagos,
killing all 163 Army officers, relatives and crew
members on board, the government said yesterday.
The crash occurred on Saturday night, but was
not discovered until yesterday morning when bod
ies were found floating in a swamp, about 10 to 12
miles outside Lagos, sources said.
The cause was not immediately known.

Defense Minister Sani Abacha has ordered an
investigation.
Most of the passengers aboard the plane were
high-ranking officers of a military college in Jaji
Town near Kaduna who had gone to Lagos for a
Navy celebration, the sources said.
Doctor assists another suicide
DETROIT (AP) — The latest suicide assisted by
retired physician Jack Kevorkian has brought
renewed calls for a state law banning such suicides.
A 52-year-old woman with terminal lung can
cer became Kevorkian's fifth assisted suicide on
Saturday, said his lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger.
Kevorkian, dubbed "Dr. Death" by critics, has
gained notoriety by assisting suicides in Michi
gan, which has no law banning the practice. Crim
inal charges have been filed against Kevorkian in
the past, only to be dropped.
"There's no stopping Kevorkian unless we
pass legislation that literally will take him off the
streets," state Sen. Fred Dillingham said yester
day. Dillingham's bill and two others dealing with
assisted suicide are before a Michigan House sub
committee on death and dying.
Voters in California will decide in November
whether to allow physician-assisted suicide for
terminally ill people under strict controls.
