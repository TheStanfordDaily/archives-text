You can
ruin a life in
one stroke.
Even if you live through a stroke, you
might face paralysis, loss of
speech, or altered behavior. Things
that can make life difficult, to
say the least. Strokes occur when
the blood supply is cut to part
of the brain. And if you currently
have high blood pressure or
any form of heart disease, your risk
of stroke is higher than normal.
The American Heart Association
urges you to control your
blood pressure. By doing so, you'll
reduce your chances of a
stroke. And increase the likelihood
of a long, happy life.
