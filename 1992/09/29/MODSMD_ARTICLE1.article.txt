When Boris Yeltsin hoisted
Russia's tricolored flag in the
streets of Moscow in August
1991, it spelled the end of the
USSR's red-obsessed communist
regime.
But if Stanford Overseas Stud
ies officials get their way, the
color red will return to the streets
of the Russian capital next year
â€” in the form of students wear
ing Cardinal sweatshirts.
Twenty-five students will
inaugurate a new Overseas Stud
ies campus in Moscow, slated to
open next fall.
Still in the planning stages, the
newest foreign campus will house
25 students for a fall quarter-only
program. Students will live with
host families and take classes at a
center run by Stanford, according
to Corbin Smith, deputy director
of Overseas Studies.
The students, who will need to

political science and co-director of
the Institute for International
Studies.
The program will allow stu
dents who study Slavic languages
and literature an opportunity for
advanced study, he said. "Some
thing like this would have been
very difficult to do during the
Cold War."
Overseas Studies administra
tors plan to expand the program
in the 1994-95 school year by
offering a highly-focused
research module in winter quar
ter, in conjunction with the fall
program.
The module program would
allow a smaller number of stu
dents to study in other Russian
cities and in various East Euro
pean locations. But administra
tors want to wait until the Moscow
campus becomes established
before broadening the program.
"We need to bite off bits we can
chew," Smith said. "We need to
be certain that we can run a
decent academic program in
Moscow before we expand."
He explained that Overseas
Studies was able to fund this pro
gram because of the low cost of
