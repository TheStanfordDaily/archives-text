# Moscow campus to open
## 
### Rajiv Chandrasckaran Editorial staff 
When Boris Yeltsin hoisted
Russia's tricolored flag in the
streets of Moscow in August
1991, it spelled the end of the
USSR's red-obsessed communist
regime.
But if Stanford Overseas Stud
ies officials get their way, the
color red will return to the streets
of the Russian capital next year
— in the form of students wear
ing Cardinal sweatshirts.
Twenty-five students will
inaugurate a new Overseas Stud
ies campus in Moscow, slated to
open next fall.
Still in the planning stages, the
newest foreign campus will house
25 students for a fall quarter-only
program. Students will live with
host families and take classes at a
center run by Stanford, according
to Corbin Smith, deputy director
of Overseas Studies.
The students, who will need to
have had at least one year of Rus
sian language study, will be able
to take classes from Stanford fac
ulty and local teachers.
"Russia is a . . . society that is
going through a major upheaval
of great historical interest, and
this is a chance to observe this,"
said David Holloway, professor of
political science and co-director of
the Institute for International
Studies.
The program will allow stu
dents who study Slavic languages
and literature an opportunity for
advanced study, he said. "Some
thing like this would have been
very difficult to do during the
Cold War."
Overseas Studies administra
tors plan to expand the program
in the 1994-95 school year by
offering a highly-focused
research module in winter quar
ter, in conjunction with the fall
program.
The module program would
allow a smaller number of stu
dents to study in other Russian
cities and in various East Euro
pean locations. But administra
tors want to wait until the Moscow
campus becomes established
before broadening the program.
"We need to bite off bits we can
chew," Smith said. "We need to
be certain that we can run a
decent academic program in
Moscow before we expand."
He explained that Overseas
Studies was able to fund this pro
gram because of the low cost of
living in Moscow. The department can offer
programs and house students in Russia for
much less than at other West European
campuses like Oxford and Paris.
But since all students enrolled in the
Overseas Studies program pay regular Uni
versity tuition, Stanford and Overseas Stud
ies will make a small amount of money from
the Moscow program, Smith said.
"This is going to be a win-win situation
for the University, students and Overseas
Studies," he said.
Holloway, History Prof. Norman Naimark
and Condoleezza Rice, associate professor of
political science and former national security
adviser for Russian and East European
affairs, were the three faculty members most
instrumental in starting the program, Smith
said.
"There are so many interesting things
going on there for undergraduate research,
like studying the economic transition or the
changing political system," said Naimark.
"What can be better than being on the spot?"
Naimark added that Moscow will be an
ideal location for faculty and staff research.
"People in medicine, education and law
have shown an interest in the Russian polit

ical transition," he said. "It's not just for
Russian specialists."
Currently, Overseas Studies administra
tors are working to find local academics who
will work with the program.
"We're looking at several possible collab
orators and we are working with the Rus
sian experts on the Stanford faculty to
determine the best package," said Prof.
Russell Berman, director of Overseas Stud
ies, who returned this week from a planning
trip to Moscow.
"Being in Moscow next year will be
extremely exciting, but it's not going to be
for the faint-hearted," cautioned Berman.
In addition, Smith said Overseas Studies
is looking into creating a research-intensive
program in Puebla, Mexico for winter quar
ter 1994. The module would be run in con
junction with the Santiago campus, with
students spending the fall in Chile and the
winter in Puebla.
But at present, he said, it's too early to
tell "the nature and form" of the program.
Smith said the planned Moscow and
Puebla expansions should not be viewed as
precursors to large increases in foreign cam
pus offerings. But other campuses may be
added in the future if there is academic inter
est and financial viability, he said.
He mentioned China and Africa as two
places that have strong interest and poten
tially low program costs.
