# More grads admitted

A 10 percent increase in the number of
graduate students this year is expected to
pour more tuition dollars into ailing Univer
sity coffers.
But some faculty members worry that the
increase might "compromise to some degree
the academic integrity of the master's pro
grams," according to Registrar Jack Farrell.
About 2,272 new graduate students —
829 in doctoral programs and 1,443 seeking
master's degrees — enrolled this year.
While the doctoral students are admitted
with the promise of funding, Farrell explained
that most master's students come to Stanford
without financial aid.
"They bring real money into the system,"
he said. The increase in master's students
was agreed to last year as part of the Uni
versity's deficit-reduction plan.
Stanford's graduate schools will be affected
unevenly by the plan. While the Schools of
Engineering, Education and Humanities and
Sciences will see significant increases, others
will receive only a handful of new students.
The School of Engineering, for example,
will enroll 120 extra master's students this
year. And the School of Education has 70

more — about a 74 percent Increase.
Two new programs and minor increases in
others have stretched that school's size, accord
ing to Assoc. Dean of Education Martin Ford.
But because the additional students have been
dispersed between seven departments,
"nobody's taken a big hit," Ford said.
New services and "a much larger team"
should help the school avoid a decline in
excellence, he added.
Other areas of the University will hardly
feel the change. Charles Bonini, an associate
dean at the Business School, said the enter
ing class of about 360 has only 15 more stu
dents than last year's.
"There will be a couple more students in
sections," he said, adding that he doesn't
expect any decline in quality because of the
"relatively modest" increase.
Judith Goldstein, chair of the University
Committee on Graduate Studies, said her
group had worried about the effect of more stu
dents when the plan was considered last year.
But questionnaires sent to the deans of
the graduate schools yielded few complaints,
said Goldstein, an associate professor of
political science.
The committee will keep an eye on the
situation this year, she added. "It's hard to
know if it's going to be a problem."
