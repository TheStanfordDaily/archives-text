Clinton risks losing black votes
BALTIMORE (AP) — Clinton's challenge will
be to lure black voters out to polling places on
Election Day, despite the fact that his effort to
win over working-class whites has left many black
voters feeling ignored.
At the same time, however, many blacks feel
"any change would be better," said David Bositis
of the Washington-based Joint Center for Politi
cal and Economic Studies.
However, a Bush spokesperson said Bush has
not given up on the black vote. Bush forces this
month formed a campaign arm designed to rally
votes in black communities.
Howard University political scientist Ron Wal
ters was skeptical that Clinton could "craft a mes
sage that has appeal to both white middle-class
voters and black voters."
Bositis said the black vote "has only to do with

Clinton" because "there is nothing (Bush) can do
to get it .... so the question becomes the magni
tude" of the turnout.
Perot plays coy on economy
DALLAS (AP) — Ross Perot said yesterday
there was "a great deal of overlap" between his eco
nomic views and those of both presidential candi
dates and suggested he would decide by Thursday
whether he would run for president.
Perot said his supportors would determine
whether or not he would enter the race. "If the
volunteers ... feel that it's appropriate that I run,
certainly I am going to honor their request."
State leaders of the Perot movement assem
bled in Dallas yesterday to hear the campaign pre
sentations. On their return home, they planned to
poll Perot supporters on whether the Texan
should run for president.
