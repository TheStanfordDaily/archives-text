GM, auto workers end strike
DETROIT (AP) — The United Auto Workers
and General Motors Corp. reached a tentative
agreement yesterday to end a four-day-old strike
at a plant that makes body parts for one of GM's
top-selling cars.
Neither side would disclose details of the pro
posed settlement until a ratification vote today by
the 4,200 members of the UAW Local 602.
But GM's statement seemed to indicate the
automaker would be able to follow through on
plans to eliminate up to 350 jobs at the plant by
changing the way work breaks are taken.
The strike began Friday, forcing the closing of
the Lansing Car Assembly Body Plant and the
closing of the nearby Lansing chassis plant, where
3,000 workers assemble the Grand Am, Oldsmo
bile Achieva and Buick Skylark.
Another child seeks divorce
WASHINGTON (AP) — A 12-year-old Missis
sippi boy has filed suit to divorce his parents,
prompted by the success of Florida's Gregory
Kingsley in a similar case decided Friday.
Joel C. has lived in seven homes in two years
after Mississippi social workers removed him and
four sisters from their parents in July 1990

because of alleged abuse. He now lives with an
aunt and uncle in Fairfax, Va., and is willing to go
to court to stay there.
"After Joel heard about the Florida case he
asked us, 'Why can't I do this?" said his aunt and
one of his foster parents, who asked to be called
only Linda.
SF mayor nation's highest paid
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - With a $138,672
yearly paycheck, Frank Jordan has the highest
budgeted salary of any mayor in America.
But Jordan isn't happy about the amount he's
paid, given the city's budget crunch. He is volun
tarily giving back $9,000 — the amount of an
automatic raise that took effect July 1 — the San
Francisco Examiner reported yesterday.
More than three dozen other highly paid city offi
cials are also declining their automatic raises,
required under a city ordinance. They include the
city controller and city attorney, who are among the
96 city officials who earn more than $100,000 a year.
Jordan's budgeted salary exceeds those of New
York Mayor David Dinkins, who receives
$130,000, and Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley,
who makes $117,884. California Gov. Pete Wilson
will make $114,000 this year after taking a volun
tary 5 percent pay cut.
