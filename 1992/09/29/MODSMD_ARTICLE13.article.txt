# Mafia drug bust catches 200
## Cocaine and property seized in international police sting 
### 
ROME (AP) — Two alleged
drug kingpins arrested as they
left an ice cream parlor in the
heart of Rome were among the
first nabbed in a worldwide drag
net that dealt a heavy blow to a
Mafia-Colombian connection,
authorities said yesterday.
"Operation Green Ice" used a
sting to help catch some 200 peo
ple last weekend in the United
States, Italy and at least five
other countries, officials said.
Tens of millions of dollars in
cocaine, cash, jewels, securities
and property were seized.
The case showed how strong
the links are between Colombian
and Italian gangsters.
Achille Serra, a top police offi
cial, said the ring sent cocaine
from Colombia through the Unit
ed States and Spain for distribu
tion in Italy and other European
countries.
Colombians looking for a ship

ping network built their partner
ship with the Mafia to expand
their European sales, said U.S.
officials in Washington.
"The Colombians have chosen
Italy as their warehouse to store
cocaine for distribution through
out Europe," said Greg Passic,
chief financial investigator of the
Drug Enforcement Administra
tion.
Authorities have suspected for
months that the Colombians,
lacking their own distribution
network in Europe, are joining
with Italian organized crime lead
ers, particularly in Sicily. The
goal is to expand beyond the Unit
ed States, where the cocaine mar
ket appears to be saturated.
The sting operation that led to
the bust was based at a bogus
company in La Jolla, Calif, that
laundered cartel money, officials
said.
Suspected drug smugglers

from Colombia, Italy, England,
Spain, the British Cayman
Islands, Costa Rica, Canada and
the United States used the firm to
launder about $53 million in drug
assets, a U.S. DEA agent said.
George Terwilliger, a deputy
U.S. attorney general, called the
case "truly a crippling blow to the
Colombian cartel." He said it
would be naive to think the oper
ation would stop the flow of
cocaine in the United States.
While officials in Rome said
201 people were nabbed, U.S. offi
cials held a news conference, and
put the number of arrests at 153.
The discrepancy could not imme
diately be reconciled.
Authorities in Rome reported
34 arrests in Italy but gave no
breakdown of the others. U.S.
agents said arrests were made in
Los Angeles, San Diego, New
York, Chicago, Houston and the
Miami-Fort Lauderdale area.
