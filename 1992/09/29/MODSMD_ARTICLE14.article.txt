BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Only a day before
today's scheduled impeachment vote on corruption
charges, President Fernando Collor de Mello's crit
ics attacked him in Congress as millions of Brazil
ians took to the streets demanding his impeach
ment.
Rep. Maria Laura of the Socialist Workers Party
warned that "if Congress does not bring down the
president, the people will."
Rep. Beth Azize of the Workers Democratic Party
said Collor had failed to rebut corruption charges
surrounding his administration.
Rep. Ronaldo Caiado of the Christian Democratic
Party defended Collor. He called the entire impeach
ment process "an attempt to grab power by those
unable to win in the election."
Last month, congressional investigators accused
Collor of receiving at least $6.5 million from Paulo
Cesar Farias, his 1989 presidential campaign trea
surer. Farias has been charged with tax evasion,
graft and influence peddling.
The investigating committee said Collor's con
duct was "incompatible with the dignity, honor and
decorum of the post of chief of state."

After the investigators released their findings,
the Brazilian Bar Association requested the presi
dent's impeachment on Sept. 1.
A pro-impeachment coalition in Congress said
370 legislators would vote against Collor — 34 more
than is needed to impeach.
"There is absolutely no doubt that we will win,"
said coalition coordinator Roseana Sarney.
The government said it has enough votes to block
impeachment. Presidential spokesman Etevaldo
Dias said 220 members of Congress would vote
against impeachment — 52 more than needed to
guarantee Collor's job.
Orestes Quercia, president of the Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party, has spearheaded
impeachment efforts.
If two-thirds of the lower house vote yes today,
Collor will be suspended for up to 180 days and
replaced by Vice President Itamar Franco. The Sen
ate will then decide whether to remove Collor per
manently.
Attorney General Aristides Junqueira is also con
sidering whether to indict Collor on criminal charges
of tax evasion, corruption and malfeasance.
