## Election decision '92 
### 
With the back to school
rush, are you sure that
you're really registered?

THE NATIONAL DAY of reckon
ing, Tuesday, Nov. 3, is only 35
days away. And counting.
A more immediate, and perhaps
more important date for many Stan
ford students, however, is Monday,
Oct. 5, the deadline for California
voter registration.
Many newly-arrived 18-year olds on
campus may be registering for the
first time, while other students may
never have exerted the time or effort.
Still others simply do not know how
and where to register at all.
The process is exceedingly simple
— filling out a mere one page form is
all it takes — and does not even
require a special trip off-campus.
Tresidder Union has been blanket
ed with voter registration booths. And
one can always find a voter's registra
tion application at the campus post
office.
Even the state of California has
established a toll-free number which
people can call to request voter regis
tration forms free of charge. If you
want to vote in this year's election,
there is really no excuse.
The Voter Registration Hotline
number is 1-800-345-VOTE; after
Thursday, however, the number will
no longer be useful for those trying to
register in time for the Nov. 3 election.
Though the msgority of Stanford
students are not California residents,
many state absentee ballot request
deadlines that have already passed.
And even when absentee deadlines
have not yet passed, there is simply
not enough time to complete all of the
necessary paperwork in order to be
counted in the general election.
In other words, just because a stu
dent is registered back home, he or she
may still need to register to vote in Cal
ifornia in order to participate on Nov. 3.
Furthermore, every time a person
changes addresses, a frequent occur
rence among students, he or she must
re-register. This means that the thou
sands of students who moved out of
their residences last spring will need
to update their registration in order to
be eligible to vote.

For new students unfamiliar with
California politics, there is still plenty
of time to learn about the issues
and races in the upcoming election.
Aside from the presidential race,
both seats for U.S. Senate are vacant,
as well as the congressional seat repre
senting the district to which Stanford
belongs.
Needless to say, that represents
quite a bit of weight in Washington
and offers the unusual opportunity to
vote in four major races at the same
time.
In one Senate race, former San
Francisco Mayor Diane Feinstein, a
Democrat, is facing current Sen. John
Seymor, a Republican appointed by
Gov. Pete Wilson to fill the seat he
vacated when he won the California
governorship in 1988. The winner will
occupy the seat for two years, at which
time he or she will face another gener
al election.
Democratic Representative Bar
bara Boxer opposes Republican Bruce
Herschensohn in the battle to fill the
seat being vacated by retiring Sen.
Alan Cranston. The winner will direct
ly influence Californians and the
nation from Washington for the next
six years.
Finally, San Mateo County Super
visor Tom Huening, a Republican,
faces Democrat Anna Eshoo in the
race for the Peninsula's 14th District
Congressional seat.
The California races to be deter
mined in November will have tremen
dous long-term effects, well-beyond
the duration of the winner's term.
Whatever your pet issue may be —
whether abortion, the environment,
health or child care there is an aspir
ing politician out there who desperate
ly wants and needs your votes.
President Bush recently vetoed an
automatic voter registration bill in
which would automatically register
citizens eligible to vote whenever they
filed with the Department of Motor
Vehicles, the local welfare office, or
several other government agencies. It
is his position that the federal govern
ment should not hold a single citizen's
hand at the poll booth, let alone the
voter's registration line.
Therefore, every student wishing to
exercise his or her constitutional right
to participate in our nations upcoming
presidential election, will need to take
the initiative and register. It's that
simple.
