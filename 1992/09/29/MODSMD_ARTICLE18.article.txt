## Robert Weisberg Clinton not alone in draft dilemma 
### 
Robert Weisberg is a professor at the
Stanford Law School. He is also the Res
ident Fellow of Murray, the Modern Cul
ture and Thought focus house.

I EMPATHIZE WITH
Bill Clinton, because
I can't get my own
draft story straight. We
are the same age, and
like millions of others,
went through various
stages of draft avoid
ance, evasion and resis
tance; thr very multi
plicity of terifis under-

scores the problem.
I remember sitting among 2,000 fel
lows (and a few uniformed military proc
tors) in a New York City hotel ballroom.
We were taking an army-instituted, SAT
style aptitude test, to insure that those
claiming student deferments merited
them intellectually.
I remember contemplating whether
the extended deferments available to
medical or divinity students seemed fea
sible. I remember the great bazaars on
the college lawn, where passionate
preachers of sacrificial civil disobedience
alternated with open-air seminars on
mimicking the symptoms of schizophre
nia to flunk the army medical exam.
I remember the great and horrible
night of the draft lottery when before

televisions in bars and dorm lounges
across the country, we watched General
Hershey pull our birth dates out of that
big drum in random yet fateful sequence.
At some point, I had prepared a con
scientious objector application and was
told that it might be granted by my draft
board. Not because of its moral persua
siveness, but because I came from a poor
neighborhood in the Bronx, where the
board had no trouble filling its quota. It
saw no point in wasting time mincing
words with me.
Had the application been granted, I
would have briefly been a moral hero to
my friends, but later would have regret
ted committing myself to alternate ser
vice for two years. In any event, I seem to
recall that the whole issue got mooted the
night of the lottery. My birthday, April 8,
came up number 325.
I may have the facts slightly askew,
because in trying to remember them, I
can't help but recall the very conflicted
social, moral and political roles we were
all trying on.
Even if we settle the facts of Clinton's
methods of staying out of the army, what
would they tell us about him? The ques
tion falsely implies that there can be a
unitary answer. The so-called question of
"trust" — in its simplistic concerns for
patriotism or factual accuracy — masks
more complex issues.
Clinton's motives, like millions of

other young men's, were mixed. To some
extent, he simply did not want to to take
the physical risk of fighting in Vietnam.
In addition, he did not want to interrupt
his education. He was morally offended
by the war and thought it unethical to
participate in it. Further, he needed to
appear offended by the war, else he might
have risked being ostracized by his moral
and political peer group.
As an incipient lawyer he might have
been able to win conscientious objector
status by subscribing to one of the secu
lar humanist rationalizations, that had
begun to suffice as the legal equivalent of
a religious objection to all war by the late
'60s. But that fit neither his self-image
nor his political ambitions.
He might have nervously sensed that by
avoiding the draft he was merely ensuring
that some less fortunate soul would have
to go in his place instead. He may also have
partially believed that widespread draft
avoidance might so weaken the war, as to
reduce the number of souls that would, in
the long run, be drafted.
So what was his real motive? All of the
above, and all interacting with each
other. What can be said about Clinton's
current inability to get the old story
straight? Probably not much more than
that the facts of that chaotic time become
blurred. The "facts" themselves are not
pure truth, but matters of moral inter
pretation.
