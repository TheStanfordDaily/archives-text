## Stanford athletes shine on after NCAA achievements 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
In a few years a roommate, friend or
lust-interest of yours may grace the
cover of Sports Illustrated and rake in
mega-bucks as a professional athlete.
Over 100 ex-Cardinal players are
currently making their marks on pro
baseball, football, basketball, tennis,
track and volleyball — and many don't
just warm the bench.
Two ex-Cardinal hurlers helped the
American League to victory in the 1992
All-Star Game: White Sox ace Jack
McDowell was major league baseball's
first twenty game winner this year and
Baltimore Oriole star Mike Mussina
will come close to that vaunted plateau
by the end of the season.
Philadelphia Phillies' outfielder
Ruben Amaro has made several
sparkling defensive plays since being
called up at mid-year, while Toronto
infielder Ed Sprague — the husband of
synchronized swimming Olympic gold
medalist Kristen Babb-Sprague — has
also made the jump to the majors.
Over 35 ex-Farm hands also dot base
ball's farm system. Jeffrey Hammonds
and David McCarty are two of several
recent Stanford players who have good
shots at making it to "The Show."
In last year's National Football
League draft, Stanford was the only
school to have two players chosen among
the top 10. Lefl tackle Bob Whitfield was
the Atlanta Falcons' first pick (eighth
overall), and Tommy Vardell went as the
next pick to the Cleveland Browns.
Vardell, who is the Browns' current

starting fullback, was recently named
the 1991-92 GTE Academic All-Ameri
can of the Year. In just his second regu
lar season game as a pro, Vardell racked
up 84 yards against the Miami Dolphins
on Sept. 14.

In last year's NFL
draft, Stanford was
the only school to
have two players
chosen in the top 10.

Like many first round picks, Whit
field held out during training camp and
is just now getting some playing time.
While some former Stanford gridders
like quarterback John Elway and wide
receiver James Lofton have carved out
places in NFL history, a few have found
fame north of the border. One such
example is fullback Jon Volpe, who cap
tured Canadian Football League Rookie
of the Year honors last year and current
ly stars for the British Columbia Lions.
Basketball is another sport in which
Stanford grads shine. 1992 grad Adam
Keefe signed with the Atlanta Hawks
after being picked 10th overall in the
NBA draft; Todd Lichti plays guard for
the Denver Nuggets.
Europe and Japan are where many
Card hoopsters have made their mark.
With no women's pro basketball league for
them in the U.S., Jennifer Azzi and her

1990 national champion teammates have
excelled overseas. Azzi, Sonja Henning,
Katy Steding, Trisha Stevens and Julie
Zeilstra all compete in France, Sweden or
Japan. Azzi and Steding just missed spots
on the 1992 U.S. Olympic team.
On the men's side, John Patrick and
Eric Reveno play in Japan while Deshon
Wingate competes in a French league.
However, nowhere is the Stanford
influence felt more than in professional
tennis.
John McEnroe is the best known of
former Stanford stars. He is joined by
several perennial Grand Slam con
tenders such as David Wheaton, Der
rick Rostagno and the recently retired
Tim Mayotte. Alex O'Brien, last year's
NCAA singles, doubles and team cham
pion, took Jim Courier, then the top
ranked player, to four sets in the 1992
U.S. Open.
On the women's side, 1992 grad Deb
bie Graham has found success on the
women's tour. After turning pro a year
ago, the former NCAA champion
cracked the world top 50. At the U.S.
Open last year, she distinguished her
self as one of the hardest servers in the
game with a 111 m.p.h. blast. Also on
the tour are Tami and Teri Whitlinger,
Sandra Birch and frequent doubles
champion Patty Fendick.
Olympians PattiSue Plumer, Nancy
Ditz, and Jeff Atkinson have found suc
cess in the world track arena after dom
inating collegiate careers on the Farm.
Kristin Klein, former captain of the
Stanford women's volleyball team, is
one of the leading players on the profes
sional four-woman beach tour.

made him a Stanford legend, has parlayed his blue-collar work ethic into a starting job
with the Cleveland Browns.
