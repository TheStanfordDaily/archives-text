# Will the Cardinal smell Roses on New Year's Day?
## 
### 
1992 — a year that, to date, has
brought to the Stanford sports scene
the second coming of Bill Walsh, five
national championships, and a veritable
"golden feast" at the Games of the XXVth
Olympiad in Barcelona.
This year has provided too many
unforgettable athletic images for those of
us who call this campus home to name
individually. We have seen royalty
returned, ruins rebuilt, and records
reset.
In fact, at this point, only one thing
could make 1992 a complete success for
Cardinal athletics, casting aside once and
for all the burden of doubt that still
looms over those who play for an institu
tion with an academic reputation such as
ours.
I am speaking, of course, of Roses.
Allow me to explain why New Year's
Day 1993 could well mark Stanford's
first appearance in the "Granddaddy of
the Bowls" since a few months before the
birth of yours truly in 1972.
The time is ripe for a Cardinal road
trip to Pasadena. All eyes are focused
squarely on a Stanford football program
that, in the view of the national media,
took its final serious step toward big-time
prominence when it rehired Walsh. While
this view is neither fair nor accurate, and
more credit should be given to former
head coach Dennis Green (who has
moved on to rescue the Minnesota
Vikings in the same manner that he
bailed us out of near-oblivion), there is no
denying that the athletic department is

laughing all the way to the bank.
In this mercurial era of what-have
you-done-for-me-lately sentiment, how
ever, even true fans of a genius like
Walsh will expect an instant return on
Stanford's one-of-a-kind investment.
The situation has not reached "now-or
never" proportions yet, but continued
success is expected of the new coaching
staff. Why, then, can't this be our Year of
the Roses?
As I have witnessed Stanford struggle
to an early 3-1 record by pulling a 10-7
defeat from the jaws of victory against
Texas A$M (note the punctuation),
recording one of the ugliest 21-7 wins in
history in its conference opener versus
Oregon, and enjoying relative blowouts of
Northwestern and San Jose State, I saw
an interesting pattern develop. While
Walsh's teams are known for their potent
offensive attacks, it was the Cardinal
defense that sparkled as a rock-solid
anchor.
That the defense should emerge as the
true stars of the team should come as no
surprise to veteran Stanford fans, who

know that the improving squad returned
10 of its 11 starters from 1991. While the
offense has lost both of its starting wide
receivers to graduation — not to mention
first-round NFL selections Tommy
Vardell at running back and Bob Whit
field at left tackle — the young defense
has steadily improved and complemented
one another beautifully. In two years
together, players get to know their
respective subtle strengths and weak
nesses that much better and form an
intangible bond that makes a unit
tougher.
I would not be singing the praises of
the Cardinal defense if it weren't for one
simple law of football, one that, rest
assured, Bill Walsh has burned into his
brain: Defense Wins Championships.
So the offense has had problems thus
far in the so-called "Red Zone," the area
inside their opponents' 20-yard-line. So
the kicking game is currently in transi
tion and the Cardinal has yet to defeat an
opponent of note (Sorry, all you Fighting
Duck, Wildcat, and Spartan backers.). So
what? These problems will work them
selves out over the course of the season,
while the defense will only continue to
improve.
Stanford has already overcome its
largest obstacle of a year ago, namely its
schedule, without even trying. In 1991,
the Cardinal was unprepared for its
opener against Washington, the defend
ing Rose Bowl champs. The 42-7 shel
lacking at the hands of the Huskies that
week was followed by an injury-riddled,
28-24, come-from-ahead loss at Arizona.

Two Pacific 10 Conference games, two
losses, and it doesn't take Bill Walsh to
figure out where your championship
hopes have gone.
This season, the Cardinal opened
with a legitimate top-five nonconference

Remember 1990, when a
weaker Stanford team that
would eventually wind up its
season 5-6 went to the home
of an unbeaten, untied, No.
1-ranked giant and came
away with a win?

opponent at a neutral site on a Wednes
day in late August. That Stanford domi
nated A&M for 3-1/2 quarters was amaz
ing; that the team did it in its first game
even more so. By scheduling three con
secutive home games against one Pac-10
and two nonconference patsies, the Car
dinal was all but assured of a record no
worse than its present 3-1 as it heads to
South Bend to take on Notre Dame in a
game that, keep in mind, has nothing to
do with the Rose Bowl.
Beyond this week, road games at
UCLA, Oregon State, and Cal await, as
well as home games versus USC, Wash
ington State, and Arizona. However, if

form holds, the War for the Roses will all
come down to an October 31 showdown
with (Guess who?) the now-two-time
defending champion Huskies, a show
down that can — yes, can — be won by
the Cardinal.
Remember 1990, when a weaker Stan
ford team that would eventually wind up
its season 5-6 went to the home of an
unbeaten, untied, No. 1-ranked giant and
came away with a win? Washington, like
Notre Dame two years ago, will have fat
tened up on a much lesser opponent (in
this case, Pacific) the previous week, and
will undoubtedly be more than a little
overconfident on the fourth week of a
four-game homestand.
This may sound hopeful, but you
heard it here first: the Cardinal will kill
the Pac-10 monster in its Emerald City
den and earn the right to defeat Michi
gan in its last Rose Bowl appearance
before Penn State joins the Big-10 next
year.
If this scenario does not happen to pan
out, and the Cardinal team coach (in this
case, airplane) turns into a pumpkin on
Halloween, don't worry. Stanford foot
ball has no vacation plans for the remain
der of 1992, and I hear Florida is nice in
January.

losses, and it doesn't take Bill Walsh to
figure out where your championship
hopes have gone.
This season, the Cardinal opened
with a legitimate top-five nonconference

opponent at a neutral site on a Wednes
day in late August. That Stanford domi
nated A&M for 3-1/2 quarters was amaz
ing; that the team did it in its first game
even more so. By scheduling three con
secutive home games against one Pac-10
and two nonconference patsies, the Car
dinal was all but assured of a record no
worse than its present 3-1 as it heads to
South Bend to take on Notre Dame in a
game that, keep in mind, has nothing to
do with the Rose Bowl.
Beyond this week, road games at
UCLA, Oregon State, and Cal await, as
well as home games versus USC, Wash
ington State, and Arizona. However, if

form holds, the War for the Roses will all
come down to an October 31 showdown
with (Guess who?) the now-two-time
defending champion Huskies, a show
down that can — yes, can — be won by
the Cardinal.
Remember 1990, when a weaker Stan
ford team that would eventually wind up
its season 5-6 went to the home of an
unbeaten, untied, No. 1-ranked giant and
came away with a win? Washington, like
Notre Dame two years ago, will have fat
tened up on a much lesser opponent (in
this case, Pacific) the previous week, and
will undoubtedly be more than a little
overconfident on the fourth week of a
four-game homestand.
This may sound hopeful, but you
heard it here first: the Cardinal will kill
the Pac-10 monster in its Emerald City
den and earn the right to defeat Michi
gan in its last Rose Bowl appearance
before Penn State joins the Big-10 next
year.
If this scenario does not happen to pan
out, and the Cardinal team coach (in this
case, airplane) turns into a pumpkin on
Halloween, don't worry. Stanford foot
ball has no vacation plans for the remain
der of 1992, and I hear Florida is nice in
January.

1992 — a year that, to date, has
brought to the Stanford sports scene
the second coming of Bill Walsh, five
national championships, and a veritable
"golden feast" at the Games of the XXVth
Olympiad in Barcelona.
This year has provided too many
unforgettable athletic images for those of
us who call this campus home to name
individually. We have seen royalty
returned, ruins rebuilt, and records
reset.
In fact, at this point, only one thing
could make 1992 a complete success for
Cardinal athletics, casting aside once and
for all the burden of doubt that still
looms over those who play for an institu
tion with an academic reputation such as
ours.
I am speaking, of course, of Roses.
Allow me to explain why New Year's
Day 1993 could well mark Stanford's
first appearance in the "Granddaddy of
the Bowls" since a few months before the
birth of yours truly in 1972.
The time is ripe for a Cardinal road
trip to Pasadena. All eyes are focused
squarely on a Stanford football program
that, in the view of the national media,
took its final serious step toward big-time
prominence when it rehired Walsh. While
this view is neither fair nor accurate, and
more credit should be given to former
head coach Dennis Green (who has
moved on to rescue the Minnesota
Vikings in the same manner that he
bailed us out of near-oblivion), there is no
denying that the athletic department is

laughing all the way to the bank.
In this mercurial era of what-have
you-done-for-me-lately sentiment, how
ever, even true fans of a genius like
Walsh will expect an instant return on
Stanford's one-of-a-kind investment.
The situation has not reached "now-or
never" proportions yet, but continued
success is expected of the new coaching
staff. Why, then, can't this be our Year of
the Roses?
As I have witnessed Stanford struggle
to an early 3-1 record by pulling a 10-7
defeat from the jaws of victory against
Texas A$M (note the punctuation),
recording one of the ugliest 21-7 wins in
history in its conference opener versus
Oregon, and enjoying relative blowouts of
Northwestern and San Jose State, I saw
an interesting pattern develop. While
Walsh's teams are known for their potent
offensive attacks, it was the Cardinal
defense that sparkled as a rock-solid
anchor.
That the defense should emerge as the
true stars of the team should come as no
surprise to veteran Stanford fans, who

know that the improving squad returned
10 of its 11 starters from 1991. While the
offense has lost both of its starting wide
receivers to graduation — not to mention
first-round NFL selections Tommy
Vardell at running back and Bob Whit
field at left tackle — the young defense
has steadily improved and complemented
one another beautifully. In two years
together, players get to know their
respective subtle strengths and weak
nesses that much better and form an
intangible bond that makes a unit
tougher.
I would not be singing the praises of
the Cardinal defense if it weren't for one
simple law of football, one that, rest
assured, Bill Walsh has burned into his
brain: Defense Wins Championships.
So the offense has had problems thus
far in the so-called "Red Zone," the area
inside their opponents' 20-yard-line. So
the kicking game is currently in transi
tion and the Cardinal has yet to defeat an
opponent of note (Sorry, all you Fighting
Duck, Wildcat, and Spartan backers.). So
what? These problems will work them
selves out over the course of the season,
while the defense will only continue to
improve.
Stanford has already overcome its
largest obstacle of a year ago, namely its
schedule, without even trying. In 1991,
the Cardinal was unprepared for its
opener against Washington, the defend
ing Rose Bowl champs. The 42-7 shel
lacking at the hands of the Huskies that
week was followed by an injury-riddled,
28-24, come-from-ahead loss at Arizona.

Two Pacific 10 Conference games, two
losses, and it doesn't take Bill Walsh to
figure out where your championship
hopes have gone.
