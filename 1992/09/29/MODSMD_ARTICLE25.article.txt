Early in an athletic season, in any sport
and at any level, the responsibility for eas
ing the transition from inactivity to consis
tency falls squarely on the shoulders of a
team's veterans. With experience and a
guiding hand to lend, veterans often lead
their squads both on and off the field of
play.
Seniors Kyle Krpata and Carrie Feldman

— the Daily's Athletes of the Week — have
both demonstrated tremendous leadership
capabilities in taking the men's soccer and
women's volleyball teams, respectively, to
new heights so far in 1992.
Krpata, who hails from Saratoga, Calif.,
has been a virtually impenetrable last line of
defense as the goalkeeper for the Cardinal
men's soccer team.
In winning six of his eight starts on the
young campaign, he has recorded three
shutouts.
These include a 3-0 blanking of perennial
powerhouse Santa Clara and twin 3-0 past
ings of Maryland-Baltimore County and
Northern Illinois in the St. Mary's Tourna
ment last weekend.
Krpata's goals-against average now
stands at an impressive 1.29.

Feldman, whose setter position is much
like that of a quarterback or point guard
with defensive responsibilities, has pushed
the No. 2 Cardinal women's volleyball team
to an 8-0 start in her final season in a Stan
ford uniform.
The Davis, Calif., native led a sweep of
Oregon and Oregon State in her squad's
conference-opening road trip last weekend
with a remarkable 69 assists, 13 digs and
four kills for the two matches.
Feldman, one of the Cardinal's three
senior tri-captains, has been an anchor for
Stanford since her freshman year.

She will lead the Cardinal into its first
home matches of the season when USC
and top-ranked UCLA pay the spikers a
visit this Friday and Saturday, respective
ly
If Feldman and the Cardinal continue on
their torrid pace, they will be strong con
tenders for the program's elusive first
national title in December.
