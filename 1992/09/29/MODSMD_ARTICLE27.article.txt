# Meier named first woman chair of hospital board
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Linda Meier is taking her life
saving efforts one step further.
Meier — who has helped guide
Stanford Hospital since 1978 as a
member of the hospital's board of
directors — has been named chair
of the board, filling the spot vacat
ed by former University President
Donald Kennedy. She is the first
woman to hold the post.
"It's a challenging and exciting
job, and I'm looking forward to
it," Meier said. "I'm very interest
ed in health care, and I'm very
interested in the community."
The board is the governing
body of the hospital. Among other
duties, it approves all budget and
employment issues within the
hospital.
Meier said she had only a casu
al relationship with the hospital
while she was a Stanford student
in the late 1950s and early 19605.
A sociology major, she spent some
time studying "the sociology of
health and illness" before gradu
ating with a bachelor's in sociolo
gy in 1961.

"Never did I realize that I
would be involved to this extent"
in health care, she said.
But Meier soon became heavily
involved, helping to bring the
Ronald McDonald house — a
facility where families of hospital
ized children can stay — to Stan
ford Hospital.

'She's been a very
integral part of the
board.'
—Marjorie Hildahl

"That was sort of my first
interaction with the Stanford
community," she said. "It was
very satisfying. It was a wonder
ful project."
Meier never looked back, join
ing the hospital board in 1978.
Her long tenure on the board
was one factor that made Meier
the pick for the top slot, said Mar
jorie Hildahl, coordinator of the
board. Hildahl said new chairs are
chosen from among the board

members, who currently number
21.
Hildahl said fund raising has
been one of Meier's main activi
ties as a board member, but added
that Meier has done "many other
things as well. She's been a very
integral part of the board."
Among her fund-raising
efforts, Meier was co-chair of the
Centennial Campaign that raised
$1.25 billion for Stanford between
1986 and 1992.
Meier said many challenges
face the hospital and the health
care industry nationwide, chal
lenges she hopes to address on the
board.
"The hospital has done dra
matic budget revisions, but it is
also the manage-care environ
ment. . . .We are looking at all
kinds of options," she said.
Manage-care refers to how
large companies, such as health
insurers, decide which medical
procedures their patients can
receive under coverage. The issue
is a national one, as the discussion
of health care in this year's presi
dential race shows, Meier said.
Meier said budget cuts are

another issue the board will deal
with. The hospital has cut $50
million over the past two years,
she said, but the cuts have gone
smoothly because "management
has done an incredible job of
simultaneously cutting the bud
get while improving service."

She pointed to ongoing con
struction of a new chapel and
parking garage as examples of
how the hospital has been able to
expand services during tight fiscal
times.
Meier, who grew up in South
ern California but stayed in the
Bay Area after graduating from
Stanford, is not unaccustomed to
being the first woman in an
administrative post: In 1984, she
served for one year as the first
female chair of the Stanford Ath
letic Board.
She has also served on the
board of Lucile Salter Packard
Children's Hospital at Stanford.
She is currently a member of the
University Board of Trustees and
the board of directors of Universi
ty National Bank and Trust.
After finishing Kennedy's
term, which ends Dec. 31, Meier
will start a two-year stay as chair
of the board.
Hildahl said University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper will serve on
the hospital board, but not as
chair because, with his new
responsibilities, "there are just
not enough hours in the day."
