## Games now free to students

Budget crunch? What budget crunch?
Thanks to a financing program formulated by the
Department of Athletics over the summer, students
will now be admitted free to virtually all Cardinal
athletic contests.
The $2 student ticket charge that was instituted in
1990 for all home sporting events other than football
and basketball has been eliminated. Free passes will
also be issued to the first 1,500 Stanford students
attending each Cardinal men's and women's basket
ball home game.
Even the price of the 1992 football season package
— a deal that includes a ticket to this year's Big Game
in Berkeley — has been reduced from $50 to $32.
According to Assoc. Athletic Director Tom Beck
ett, the changes were brought about because of
research done over the past year by the Athletics
Department's marketing committee.
"We've received lots of input from [the marketing
committee's! student focus group," Beckett said. "One
thing that kept ringing through was that students
found it difficult to watch events that were costing
them a couple of dollars."
While it is still too early in the year to determine
whether attendance at athletic events will rise in 1992,
Beckett noted that the crowd at Sunday's women's
soccer home opener was "substantially larger" than
average 1991 figures.
Men's soccer coach Colin Lindores felt that com
plimentary admission would have a significant effect
on turnout at his squad's home contests.
"I was unaware of [the ticket price change], but
it's nice to know," Lindores said. "Hopefully, we'll see
some more Stanford faces at our
matches this year."
While the elimination of the $2
fee at non-football/basketball
games was an expense covered
directly by the Athletic Depart
ment, the complimentary student
basketball tickets will be spon
sored by several local businesses.
Beckett is unsure on how the
free tickets will actually be given
away at basketball games. Shelly
Wilder, associate ticket manager,
said there will be a $5 charge for
students admitted after the ini
tial 1,500 passes are claimed.
However, the $5 tickets will
not be located in the student tick
et section. "Basically," Wilder
said, "there will be 1,500 student
section tickets available for bas
ketball games."
According to Beckett, the deci
sion to reduce ticket prices was
made before the recent rise in
non-student football season tick
et purchases. "We have been
studying this project for over a
year," said the associate athletic
director. "We were going to do
this with or without the increased
ticket sales."
Sales of football season tickets
have risen "by several thousand"
over 1991 figures, Wilder said.
While the new plan represents
a significant change in Athletics
Department policy, the long-term
aspirations of the department are
even more ambitious.
"Our goal is to be able to say,
'When you attend Stanford, you
will be admitted free to all athletic
events,' " Beckett said. "Whether
or not this is a reasonable goal, I
can't say."
The cost of eliminating stu
dent prices for football tickets
would be substantial. On average,
between 4,500 and 5,000 stu
dents attend each home game,
generating revenue of $25,000 to
$30,000 per game in ticket sales
alone.
Not one member of the Pacific
10 Conference currently offers
students free football tickets.
Nevertheless, Beckett believes
that the goal is a realistic one.
"The project is still ongoing," he
said. "Hopefully, it will end up
being a real positive for the Uni
versity. We'd like to see this con
tinue to grow."
