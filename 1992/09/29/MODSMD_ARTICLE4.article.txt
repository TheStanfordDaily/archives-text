# Employees may get domestic partners plan
## 
### Grace Lee Editorial staff 
The Medical School Faculty Senate has passed a bill
proposing to extend the same benefits currently available
to spouses of University employees to domestic partners of
University employees.
The University Faculty Senate is scheduled to vote on the
benefits bill Oct. 29. If passed, it will be forwarded to Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper for his decision; if he supports
the bill, he then sends it to the Board of Trustees for approval.
The bill proposes that same-sex partners of University
employees have access to medical and dental coverage, ath
letic and library facilities, the tuition grant program and
all other benefits now offered to the employee spouses.
According to Asst. Gynecology Prof. Kate O'Hanlan,
who authored and introduced the Benefits Parity Bill in

the spring of 1991, the senate "was incredibly supportive"
of the proposal, passing it by a vote of 22-3.
While O'Hanlan said she is confident the bill will pass
the University Faculty Senate, she is still trying to solicit
written support from individual faculty members.
The purpose of compiling a list of supporters is to show
there is "broad support" for the bill, and it is not just a
fringe cause, she said. If the bill passes, "we would like [the
president and board] to see that it's not just the senate
that supports it," she said.
So far, about 150 faculty members have signed their
names to the list of supporters. O'Hanlan is asking those
professors who haven't signed the list — but support the
bill — to send her a one-sentence statement of support in
order to include their names on the list.
After carefully examining the various legal, ethical and
cost implications of the bill, the Faculty Senate Subcom

mittee on Domestic Partners' Benefits recommended this
summer that the bill be passed.
O'Hanlan said the recommendation "was tremendously
positive and facilitated [the bill's] progress."
The subcommittee cited the University's nondiscrimi
natory policy — which bars discrimination based on sexu
al orientation or marital status — as the "core case" for
extending the benefits.
"This bill is very focused in adding benefits to a group that
cannot access the same benefits already provided to their col
leagues," O'Hanlan said. "Heterosexual people's spouses are
covered [by the benefits program J... .it's a civil rights issue to
provide the same benefits to homosexuals who have spouses."
Stanford granted spousal benefits to domestic partners
of students in Oct. 1990, becoming the first university in
the nation to offer students a comprehensive domestic
partners policy.
