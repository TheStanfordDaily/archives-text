# Stanford scientists monitoring Mars mission

### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
Members of Stanford's Electrical Engi
neering Department are collaborating with
scientists around the world to monitor the
first American mission to explore Mars in
over 15 years.
Last Friday, NASA launched the Mars
Observer on an unmanned expedition
which will enable scientists to better
understand the planet's atmosphere.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Leonard

Tyler leads the team of scientists responsible
for the Radio Science investigation, which
will use the spacecraft's telecommunication
system and the giant dish-shaped antennas
of NASA's Deep Space Network to probe the
Martian gravity field and atmosphere.
The 10-member team includes Electrical
Engineering Professors David Hinson and
Richard A. Simpson, as well as scientists
from Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laborato
ry, the Goddard Space Flight Center and
France. This investigation is one of seven
separate projects being conducted at vari

ous universities and NASA laboratories.
After completing its 11-month voyage
from Earth, the spacecraft will orbit Mars
for 687 days — a Martian year, or one full
trip around the sun.
The information gathered from this
mission will answer scientific questions
and will be used to design future missions,
Tyler said. NASA and Congress both want
to send people to Mars someday, since sci
entists regard Mars as the only planet
human beings could possibly visit in the
near future, he said.

When anyone talks about the red planet,
a discussion of the possibility of life there
inevitably arises, Tyler said.
However, "there's no evidence of life on
Mars and Mars Observer is not intended to
search for life on Mars," he said.
In two years, the Observer will help a
Russian expedition to Mars by serving as a
hub, relaying radio signals that contain
data gathered from the planet.
According to Tyler, the Radio Science
investigators will be able to obtain more
accurate measurements than those
taken by thermometers and barometers
on the surface of Mars during the 1976
Viking expedition. He said the results
will be very similar to what one could
gather by sending up a weather balloon
from the surface once an hour.
The Observer will utilize radio occul

tation techniques — radio signals sent
through the Martian atmosphere from
behind Mars toward Earth — to gather
more accurate measurements of the con
ditions of Mars' atmosphere, Tyler said.
Radio occultation was originally sug
gested in 1962 by Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. Von Eshelman and first per
formed in 1965. Eshelman still teaches
here today.
According to Tyler, one unique aspect
of the Observer is that it allows scien
tists to command the spacecraft, execute
their experiments and retrieve the data

at their home institutions. Otherwise,
"you'd have to move to Pasadena for a
year," he said. NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory is located in Pasadena.
In addition to the faculty members,
several students are also involved with
the project.
Senior Chia-Ming Wong works with
data having to do with the Observer.
Additionally, graduate student Tuna
Karayel has already been chosen to work
with the professors on this project, and
the department is in the process of
recruiting two more students, Tyler said.
