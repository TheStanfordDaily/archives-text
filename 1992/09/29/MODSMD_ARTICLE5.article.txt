# Stanford scientists monitoring Mars mission

Members of Stanford's Electrical Engi
neering Department are collaborating with
scientists around the world to monitor the
first American mission to explore Mars in
over 15 years.
Last Friday, NASA launched the Mars
Observer on an unmanned expedition
which will enable scientists to better
understand the planet's atmosphere.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Leonard

Tyler leads the team of scientists responsible
for the Radio Science investigation, which
will use the spacecraft's telecommunication
system and the giant dish-shaped antennas
of NASA's Deep Space Network to probe the
Martian gravity field and atmosphere.
The 10-member team includes Electrical
Engineering Professors David Hinson and
Richard A. Simpson, as well as scientists
from Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laborato
ry, the Goddard Space Flight Center and
France. This investigation is one of seven
separate projects being conducted at vari

ous universities and NASA laboratories.
After completing its 11-month voyage
from Earth, the spacecraft will orbit Mars
for 687 days â€” a Martian year, or one full
trip around the sun.
The information gathered from this
mission will answer scientific questions
and will be used to design future missions,
Tyler said. NASA and Congress both want
to send people to Mars someday, since sci
entists regard Mars as the only planet
human beings could possibly visit in the
near future, he said.

When anyone talks about the red planet,
a discussion of the possibility of life there
inevitably arises, Tyler said.
However, "there's no evidence of life on
Mars and Mars Observer is not intended to
search for life on Mars," he said.
In two years, the Observer will help a
Russian expedition to Mars by serving as a
hub, relaying radio signals that contain
data gathered from the planet.
