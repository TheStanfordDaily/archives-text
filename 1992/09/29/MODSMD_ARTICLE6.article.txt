While adjusting to California life poses a chal
lenge to recent Brown University graduate Rebecca
Bliss, she sees an even larger task before her: creat
ing a stronger, more mainstream women's commu
nity at Stanford.
Bliss will be directing the Women's Center this
year while studying in the School of Education.
A "born and bred New Englander," Bliss said her
first few weeks at Stanford have provided an array
of contrasts between Brown and Stanford.

When asked what aspect of California life was the
most different from the East Coast, Bliss widened
her eyes and uttered a single word: "Sun!"
On a more serious note, Bliss said she hopes her
experiences with the "very liberal" Brown student
body and women's community will help her bring
the Stanford Women's Center into the mainstream
campus community.
Although she felt her perceptions of the Stanford
community were somewhat superficial because she
has only been on campus for a few weeks, she said
she had the impression that Stanford "didn't have a
strong women's voice."
"It is problematic that women here are afraid to
be associated as feminist," Bliss said. "The majority
of women hold feminist ideals but don't call them
selves feminist."
In addition to spending time on campus and talk
ing to students, Bliss has also met with administra

tors and read back issues of The Daily to get a sense
of the Stanford community.
"I get the feeling that traditionally women's cen
ters have been very much on the fringe," Bliss said.
"Like militant women with hairy legs," she joked.
"At Brown, the Women's Center was more main
stream," she explained. "If you surveyed five ran
dom people on campus, four of them would probably
know where it was located and what it did.
"Although I'm not the image of either Stanford or
Brown's women's centers, I am a mainstream type
of person," she said.
Dressed in jeans and sporting a simple, chin
length hairstyle, Bliss aptly described herself as "not
very radical."
"At Brown I was considered a moderate, here I
may be a little to the left, but not much," she said.
Despite her initial perceptions, Bliss said Stan
ford women have demonstrated in the past that they
can come together and voice their concerns.
"The rally to save the Self-Defense for Women
course last year has shown how strong the women's
community here can be," she said. "Also, the Gradu
ate Women's Network was recently revitalized to
address that lost community.
"There is tremendous potential," Bliss said. "I
want to work with different groups, such as the
Inter-Sorority Council and the Rape Education Pro
ject, and reach out to more diverse groups of
women."
Bliss said she is also pleased that the University's
administration has been "pushing women's issues to
the forefront."
The move of the Women's Center from the Toyon
Eating Clubs to the Fire Truck House last year has
increased its visibility, Bliss said. "Providing this
space was a beginning — I hope the University is
beginning to recognize the urgency of women's
needs."
Nevertheless, working at Stanford will present a

major change for Bliss, since the
Brown Women's Center had two
full-time and 14 part-time staff
members, whereas she is the only
part-time coordinator of Stan
ford's center.
Bliss said she wants all students
to realize that the Women's Center
is neither political nor exclusive —
"It's a place for all women, a place
to feel comfortable and hang out.

We have a great stereo and really
comfortable couches in here."
Meanwhile, Bliss is still work
ing on adjusting to life on the
West Coast.
"It's still weird to hear myself
say 'I live in California,' " she
said. "The realization sort of hits
when I do things like get my
library card and my Blockbuster
Video membership."
However, Bliss has not yet
acquired the most important pos

don't have a bike yet," she admit
ted, seeming a bit embarrassed.
