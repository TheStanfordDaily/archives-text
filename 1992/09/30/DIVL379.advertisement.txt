How secure is
your future in
computing?
As today's veteran programmers are watching their jobs
outsourced to the far corners of the earth, you
help but ask yourself, "is there a secure future
rnLm JtL in programming?"
In Decline and Fall of the American Programmer, Ed
Yourdon demonstrates how U.S. software organizations can
become world class shops if they exploit the key software
technologies of the 19905. Companies and programmers
that master these new technologies can be sure of superior
productivity and quality — and those that don't won't be
here when the 21st century starts.
