# Security report released

Students arriving on campus
this week will find a new campus
publication, "Safety and Securi
ty," in their residences.
But this little yellow booklet,
issued by the Department of Pub
lic Safety, isn't just a public ser
vice â€” it's the law.
As of the first week of Septem
ber, colleges must distribute a
security report to all students and
employees, detailing campus secu
rity policies and procedures as well
as statistics on crimes and arrests
during the past three years.
The mandate is part of the fed
eral 1990 Student Right to Know
Act, which requires colleges to
release information on campus
crime, graduation rates and ath

provision took effect this month.
According to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, "Safety
and Security" discusses "issues
that have already been addressed
in one form or another. We're
just trying to compile it all in one
quick document" in order to com

required to report only those
crimes and arrests which take
place on campus, in buildings or
property near the campus which
are owned or controlled by the
school for educational or housing
purposes, and on property owned
or controlled by recognized stu

"Safety and Security" lists
crimes committed on campus and
in the Foothills, according to Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herring

Crimes involving students com
mitted outside that area are not
included in the report.
Because schools are required to
list only those crimes reported to
the police, statistics for such com
monly unreported crimes as rape
may be inaccurate or misleading.
According to Caroline Mitchell,
coordinator of the sexual assault
information and resource center, a
1988 Stanford study revealed that
