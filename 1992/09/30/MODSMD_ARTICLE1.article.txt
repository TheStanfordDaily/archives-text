# Security report released
##

Students arriving on campus
this week will find a new campus
publication, "Safety and Securi
ty," in their residences.
But this little yellow booklet,
issued by the Department of Pub
lic Safety, isn't just a public ser
vice â€” it's the law.
As of the first week of Septem
ber, colleges must distribute a
security report to all students and
employees, detailing campus secu
rity policies and procedures as well
as statistics on crimes and arrests
during the past three years.
The mandate is part of the fed
eral 1990 Student Right to Know
Act, which requires colleges to
release information on campus
crime, graduation rates and ath
letic programs. Only the crime
provision took effect this month.
According to Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, "Safety
and Security" discusses "issues
that have already been addressed
in one form or another. We're
just trying to compile it all in one
quick document" in order to com
ply with the law.
But the reports have come
under fire from victim support
groups as providing students
with a false sense of security.
For example, colleges are
required to report only those
crimes and arrests which take
place on campus, in buildings or
property near the campus which
are owned or controlled by the
school for educational or housing
purposes, and on property owned
or controlled by recognized stu
dent organizations.
"Safety and Security" lists
crimes committed on campus and
in the Foothills, according to Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herring
ton, who complied the booklet.
Crimes involving students com
mitted outside that area are not
included in the report.
Because schools are required to
list only those crimes reported to
the police, statistics for such com
monly unreported crimes as rape
may be inaccurate or misleading.
According to Caroline Mitchell,
coordinator of the sexual assault
information and resource center, a
1988 Stanford study revealed that
only about 2 percent of survivors
of rape report it to the police. The
national average of rapes reported
is 10 percent, she said.
Although colleges are required
to list the incidence of felonies,
excluding arson, and arrests for
drug and alcohol violations and
weapon possession, they are not
required to report incidences of
sexual assault, which may be con
fused with rape.
"People tend to confuse the
rape issue," Niemeyer said. "Rape
is narrowly defined by the penal
code. Sexual assault could be a

number of things, such as sexual
battery, which is grabbing the
person's private parts, or unlaw
ful sexual behavior with a minor,
or forced oral copulation, or
attempted rape."
Although sexual assault has
occurred on campus in the past
three years, it does not fall under
the category of rape and is not
listed separately in the booklet,
Niemeyer said.
However, Herrington said the
required categories give "a good
sampling of campus crimes,
because these are the things that
people are most interested in."
Niemeyer said that in addition
to complying with federal law, the
booklet is tailored to meet the

needs of the Stanford community.
For example, theft is broken down
into bicycle theft and motor vehi
cle theft, because bicycle theft is a
significant problem on campus.
Although the act also requires
that deans and residence staffs
report crimes of which they
become aware, Dean of Students
Michael Jackson said this
"doesn't mean that resident fel
lows and resident assistants will
turn into crime reporters."
"We've always been vigilant in
keeping track of things going on
on campus, in and out of the resi
dences," he said. "What this act
mandates or encourages us to do
is keep accurate records and to
make these available to the com

munity."
Education Department offi
cials plan to review campus secu
rity publications this winter.
Institutions that do not comply
with the law risk losing their eligi
bility for federal student aid.
But, according to Jackson,
"What we risk most is not having
a safe community. I'm worried
less about the law than the safety
of this community."
"Safety and Security" has been
distributed to all campus resi
dents and will be mailed to under
graduates living off campus. It is
also available to the community
through the Dean of Students'
Office and the Department of
Public Safety.
