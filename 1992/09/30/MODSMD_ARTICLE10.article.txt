Bush proposes four debates
SAN DIEGO (AP) — The presidential debate
planned here for Sunday fell to the wayside as
President Bush adopted a new stance in the
debate stalemate, calling for four face-ofTs over
the final weeks of the campaign.
The University of San Diego, which was to host
Sunday's debate, called it off when Bush and
Democrat Bill Clinton failed to come to terms by
yesterday's 2 p.m. PDT deadline.
After allowing the deadline for Sunday's debate
to expire, Bush proposed a compromise yesterday.
He called for two debates with a single moderator
— as the Commission on Presidential Debates and
Clinton want — and the other two under the
ground rules that were in effect in 1988, with
three moderators posing questions to the candi
dates.
The commission believes a single moderator
would lead to more in-depth discussion of issues
and more back-and-forth questioning between the
candidates themselves.
Bush also said he would welcome Ross Perot at
the debates if the billionaire rejoins the race.
The San Diego debate was the third to be can
celed because of Bush's objection to the single

moderator format proposed by the commission on
Presidential Debates.
Candidates stump in the midwest
(AP) — President Bush barnstormed across A 1
Gore's home state yesterday, attacking Bill Clin
ton as a political chameleon who waffled on the
Persian Gulf War, while Clinton told crowds in
Kentucky and Ohio that Bush has used tax dollars
to help ship U.S. jobs overseas while doing little to
help American workers.
On a day of travel across Tennessee, Bush tried
to spread doubts about Clinton's leadership and
trustworthiness.
"You have to take your lumps and you have to
take a stand. And I don't think that we can take a
risk on Gov. Bill Clinton to be president of the
United States of America."
Clinton, meanwhile, attacked Bush on the job
front.
"George Bush promised us 30 million jobs in
eight years — he just didn't tell us where the jobs
were going to be," the Democratic presidential nom
inee said. Under Bush's stewardship, he said, more
private jobs went to Central America over the past
four years than were created in the United States.
