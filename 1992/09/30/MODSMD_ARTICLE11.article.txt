Wallace still in critical condition
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - George C. Wal
lace's vital signs improved slightly but he
remained on a respirator in critical condition yes
terday with a severe blood ailment.
The former governor's prognosis was still poor in
his fifth day at Jackson Hospital, said spokeswom
an Vicky Jones.
Wallace, 73, a four-term governor who was left
paralyzed from the waist down by a would-be assas
sin's bullet in 1972, was being treated with antibi
otics for septicemia, a blood infection brought on by
a urinary tract infection that is common in para
plegics.
After he entered the hospital Friday, he suf
fered heart failure, but doctors revived him and
later found the source of the blood disorder.
Wallace, who garnered 9.9 million votes and
carried five states in his 1968 presidential bid,
was shot while campaigning for president four
years later. Though paralyzed, he went on to

serve two more terms as governor.
Irish vote could allow divorce
DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) â€” The government
said yesterday it will hold a referendum on ending
the constitutional ban on divorce, setting up
another likely battle between morals and rights in
this Roman Catholic nation.
Ireland already is locked in a controversy over
whether to maintain its anti-abortion laws, the
most restrictive abortion laws in Europe.
Justice Minister Padraig Flynn yesterday pub
lished a White Paper on Marital Breakdown con
taining carefully framed proposals paving the way
for a referendum on the divorce ban, which pro
divorce campaigners estimate affects 100,000 cou
ples trapped in broken marriages. In 1986, voters
upheld the ban.
Flynn did not set a date for the referendum.
The Catholic Church opposes the legalization of
divorce. About 90 percent of Irish are Catholic.
