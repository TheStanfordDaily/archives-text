# Brazil impeaches president

BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Law
makers voted overwhelmingly yes
terday to impeach Fernando Collor
de Mello, Brazil's first freely- elect
ed president in 29 years.
Collor is accused of receiving
millions of dollars from a slush
fund run by his former campaign
treasurer.
Coming after weeks of massive
demonstrations, the impeachment
was seen as a significant bench
mark for democracy in Latin Amer
ica, where political crises have typi
cally led to coups and uprisings.
The scandal had paralyzed the
economy of Brazil, Latin Ameri
ca's largest nation, which is bur
dened by the highest foreign debt
in the Third World. The vote will
allow Brazil to restart its econo
my and seek foreign loans and
investment.
The 503-seat Chamber of
Deputies erupted in wild celebra
tion after Rep. Paulo Romano of
the pro-government Liberal
Front Party cast the 336 th vote in
favor — assuring two-thirds sup
port for impeachment. The final
vote was 441 in favor, 38 opposed,
23 absences and one abstention.
The vote strips Collor of power
for up to six months. Under pro
cedures similar to the U.S. sys
tem, Collor will be replaced by

Vice President Itamar Franco
while the Senate decides whether
to remove him permanently.
Collor, 43, who was inaugurat
ed in 1990 and was to have served
a five-year term, was accused by a
congressional panel of gross cor
ruption and a "lack of decorum"
in office.
The panel found that Collor —
who took office promising to end
political corruption and economic
stagnation — received $6.5 million
from a slush fund administered by
his former campaign treasurer.
Citizens in the nation of 150
million people, suffering 25 per
cent monthly inflation, flocked to
demonstrations after reports that
Collor used the funds to build a
waterfall and garden around his
Brasilia mansion, and to provide
his wife a clothing allowance of up
to $20,000 a month.
When Collor moved into his
mansion in 1990, he told voters it
was an austerity measure.
Brazil has lost presidents to ill
ness, resignation, military coups,
a plane crash and even suicide,
but this is the first time in its 103-
year history as a republic that any
leader has been impeached.
The military, which ruled from
1964 to 1985, has stayed on the
sidelines during the crisis.

Rep. Genebaldo Correia urged
impeachment "in the name of
decency, dignity and honor" in
one of the more than 60 speeches
before the historic vote.
The unexpectedly wide margin
in favor of impeachment was
boosted by government support
ers who jumped ship as it became
obvious Collor would lose.
"There were several bastards
who betrayed us," said Rep. Jose
Lourenco, a Collor supporter.
"It's all finished," he said.
For the vote, businesses closed
and hundreds of thousands of peo
ple took to the streets and crowd
ed around open-air television
screens as the lawmakers voted.
After the vote, many legisla
tors cried, and a large group of the
lawmakers held hands and sang
Brazil's national anthem.
More than 100,000 demonstra
tors who had gathered on the
lawn in front of the white marble
Congress building erupted with
cheers, fireworks and the pound
ing of samba drums in reaction to
the vote.
In Rio de Janeiro, unions of oil
and metal workers were on strike
to demand Collor's ouster. Pro
impeachment sympathizers, many
dressed in black for mourning,
cheered after the impeachment.
