"What Magic has done is show all of us that an
HIV-positive test is not the end, that you can pursue
your goals, live an active life and that HIV.. . doesn't
necessarily mean giving up," said King, who also is
infected with the virus.
"There are a lot of people out there who have the
AIDS virus, who are actively pursuing careers. . .
and who are quite physically active," said Dr.
Mervyn Silverman, president of the American Foun
dation for AIDS Research.
