Last spring's images of
violence and frustration,
beamed nationwide from Los
Angeles, awoke many Americans
to the truth that we are a divided
country.
At the same time, the multira
cial character of the riots, the
tremendous cost in lives and dol
lars, and the geographic dispersion
of the violence made it clear that
all Americans should be concerned
with the problems of poor urban
areas.
These events challenged Amer
icans to do something — but what?
At Stanford, there was both out
rage and soul-searching. Outrage
from a sense of shameful miscar
riage of justice, and soul-searching
because Stanford is in some senses
a microcosm of a broader society.
But despite Stanford's diverse
student body, the university itself
is almost wholly insulated from
the grim reality of life a few miles
to the east. Indeed, Palo Alto and
East Palo Alto share little more
than a name. East Palo Alto dis
plays many of the problems which
have been festering in urban areas
for the past two decades — inade
quate housing, poor public ser
vices, ghettoization, lousy educa
tion and, above all, poverty.
A large rally of the Stanford
community urged students to com
mit themselves to achieving justice
and creating economic opportuni
ty, in part by expanding our defini
tion of what "community" we
belong to.
But, as cynics might have pre
dicted, other issues have replaced
urban problems as front-page
news. Despite tours of the afflicted
areas by presidential candidates,
attention has turned from empow
ering poor members of urban areas
to massaging the egos of disgrun

tied middle-class voters.
At the national level, there has
been little meaningful dialogue
about the crisis in America's urban
areas or our responsibility to do
something about it.
Still, though, this does not mean
that some individuals are not tak
ing action. Some students have
embarked upon projects inspired by
the tragic events, and others have
continued to work in already estab
lished community service projects:
• Twenty-four students from
the Graduate School of Business
spent two weeks this September
helping owners of burnt-out busi
nesses in South-Central L.A. apply
for emergency loans. Another
group of students capped two
years of fund raising and volunteer
work for the"I Have a Dream"
program by "adopting" a group of
56 third-grade school students at
the nearby Flood School and guar
anteeing them funds for their
future college education.
• The East Palo Alto Communi
ty Law Project, established a
decade ago by Law School stu
dents, continues to aid low-income
residents of Stanford's neighbor
ing city in claiming their legal
rights in areas such as domestic
violence, guardianship and immi
gration. The Project also enables
volunteer attorneys from local
firms to use their own professional
training for meaningful work.
• Hundreds of undergraduates
participate in tutoring and other
forms of local community service
through a vast number of formal
and informal programs.
All of these individuals have one
thing in common. They are not
waiting for the world to change
before they make an individual
contribution. They are responsible
and useful members of a commu
nity that they define broadly.
And in a country where national
problems seem too vast for any
individual to tackle, these volun
teers can be secure in the knowl
edge that they're part of the solu
tion and not part of the problem.
