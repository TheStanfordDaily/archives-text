## Jeremy Cohen Critics of teaching have sterile argument 
### 
Jeremy Cohen is an associate professor of
Communication and a resident fellow in
Lantana.
CALLS FOR THE "improvement of
undergraduate teaching" are echo
ing off the sandstone walls of the
inner quad. First, The Wall Street Jour
nal attacked Stanford for adding African,
Asian, feminist and other voices to the
curriculum core.
Next, high gale warnings were hoist
ed with the seeming imprimaturs of the
White House by former Secretary of
Education William Bennett just as the
current senior class arrived at Stan
ford.
And then Denesh D'Souza joined Ben
nett on the morning talk-show/book
sales circuit last year with his publica
tion of "Illiberal Education" in which he
claimed that teaching is "immunized
from criticism" as "champions of minor
ity interests . . . are permitted overtly
ideological scholarship."
The storm has yet to pass. If you
count the seconds between the lightning
flash of media charges and the thunder
clap of politicized percussion you will
find the eye of the hurricane has landed
on the Farm. Just to the right of the
Quad as you look toward the Oval,
Hoover Tower intellectual Martin
Anderson has published Imposters in the
Temple.

The former Republican White House
adviser says quite simply that "American
intellectuals are destroying our Univer
sities and cheating our students of the
future."
Is the teaching that bad? Are students
subject to mindless, politicized partisan
ship under threat of grades by a "politi
cally correct" professorship that cares
not a wink for teaching? Or is the storm
— to borrow from T.S. Eliot's "The
Wasteland" — "dry sterile thunder with
out rain?"
A central theme of critics is that fac
ulties do not care about teaching. But
the facts at Stanford hardly support such
sweeping charges. Forty-three courses,
for example, are currently involved in
the Writing Across the Curriculum pro
gram.
Professors from 17 departments this
year will attend WAC pedagogy work
shops — on their own time — to contin
ue their development as teachers.
Stanford faculty also have been
attending — again on their own time —
teaching impr6vement workshops devel
oped by the Center for Teaching and
Learning.
Critics tend to dismiss these efforts
and similar ones such as the Dean's
forum on Undergraduate Teaching — a
two-year old campus program in which
Ewart Thomas has invited dozen's of
faculty to seminar discussions of

teaching style, substance, goals and
barriers.
The real student contact, these critics
charge, involves not students and profes
sors, but students and teaching
imposters in the guise of graduate stu
dents acting as teaching assistants. "Stu
dents are not qualified to teach," Ander
son flatly states. "They do not posses
enough knowledge," and so their teach
ing "mocks the essence of higher educa
tion."
Doctoral students in the Communica
tion Department, where I work, take on
teaching assistantships only after com
pleting their first year of intensive aca
demic study. They posses a great deal of
knowledge.
TAs attend a series of preparatory
workshops offered through Communica
tion, CTL and Writing Across the Cur
riculum. They are becoming quite quali
fied to teach.
Is there room for a great deal of
improvement? Of course.
Are there some teachers who are bet
ter than others? Of course. But the
storm of educational criticism — at least
as phrased by Anderson and his cadre of
politicized weather watchers — is indeed
sterile thunder without rain.
Eliot concludes his "The Wasteland"
with a question. "Shall I set my lands in
order?" Most educators continue to
make the attempt.
