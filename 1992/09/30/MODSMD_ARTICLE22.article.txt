Coffee Talk
Good news for coffee drinkers â€”
researchers from the University of
Toronto have concluded there is no sig
nificant correlation between coffee con
sumption and coronary heart disease.
This conclusion was reached by Dr.
Martin Myers and colleagues follow
ing analysis of all previously published
studies in which data on coffee intake
and coronary heart disease (CHD)
were available.
The researchers reported in the
September issue of Archives of Inter
nal Medicine that out of 11 such stud
ies, only three suggested a link
between heart problems and coffee
consumption. In addition, the studies

that did agree differed on the relative
risks of heart disease caused by drink
ing coffee.
Because of the lack of overwhelm
ing evidence of a correlation between
the studies, Myers and his associates
concluded that "individuals who con
sumed up to one cup of coffee per day
had a CHD incidence similar to those
consuming higher amounts of coffee,
even more than six cups per day."
Normal body temperature not so
normal. . . .
The long-standing belief that nor
mal human body temperature is 98.6
F will have to be abandoned, if doctors
at the Baltimore Veterans Affairs
Medical Center have their way.
According to Dr. Philip Mackowiak
and his colleagues, the actual human
body temperature varies throughout

the day.
"In our study population, 98.6 F
was not the overall mean temperature,
the mean temperature or the single
most frequent temperature recorded,"

the study said.
Instead of regarding 98.6 F as the
"normal" body temperature, the
researchers believe that temperature
readings should reflect the body tem
perature changes throughout the day.
Temperature readings of 98.9 Fin the
early morning and 99.9 F overall
would be better standards, they wrote.
The study, published this Sept. in
the Journal of the American Medical
Association, analyzed 700 oral tem
perature measurements from 148 peo
ple over a four year period.
The researchers also found that
temperature readings not only fluctu
ated with time, but they also varied
according to race and sex. Women
have slightly higher "normal" temper
atures than men. In addition, black
subjects in the study had slightly
higher temperatures than whites.
