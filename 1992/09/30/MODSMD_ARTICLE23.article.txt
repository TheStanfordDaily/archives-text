This column's raison d'etre is the premise
that even at a technically oriented institution of
higher learning like Stanford, the community
will have science-related questions that simply
cannot be satisfied by a 50-minute trip to the
local lecture hall.
Thermodynamics will never teach you the
quickest way to chill beer. Organic chemistry
has little to say about the molecular basis of a
fart's aroma. And nowhere in the Bio 32 syl
labus is there an explanation of how a 303-
pound ovarian cyst can grow teeth and hair, or
what gives semen that characteristic briny tang.
But hey, no worries — that's what I'm here
for.
Q"""
— Four-Eyed in Faisan
A: Basically, Four-Eyed, the reason that
you can see through glass is that there's
no reason not to be able to.
See (no pun intended), when a light beam inter
acts with a chunk of non-transparent matter, the
quantum-mechanical entities (called photons)
that compose light can meet one of several fates,
any one of which can prevent the photons from
being transmitted through the chunk. With a
transparent substance like glass, none of these
processes occur, and the photons make it through.
When a beam of light hits something, the
photons interact with the electrons orbiting the
atoms and molecules of the substance.
In some materials, the spacing between elec
tronic energy levels is the same as the energy of
particular photons. These materials can absorb
light of the colors corresponding to those ener
gies. If a particular color is absorbed, the mate
rial will appear to "be" the complementary color.
F'rinstance, leaves look green to us because they
do such a swell job of absorbing green's comple
mentary color, red.

I know what you're thinking at
this point: 'Ah, but glass does
reflect light, as every damn fool
who's fixed his hair in a car
window knows.'

The energy-level spacings of the silicon oxides
in glass, however, don't match the energies of
visible photons — so rather than being
absorbed, these photons simply pass through
the glass.
Some atoms and molecules have "loose"
(high-energy) electrons, which can more or less
grab a photon as it comes in and spit it out again,
a process known as reflection. The atoms of
metallic elements generally possess such high
lying electrons, which is why polished silver
makes such a handy mirror.
Molecules inside glass have no such loose
electrons, so reflection doesn't occur in the same
way as it does for metals. There's nothing kick
ing the photons back out, so they just plow on
through the glass.
I know what you're thinking at this point:
"Ah, but glass does reflect light, as every damn
fool who's fixed his hair in a car window knows."
Well, kind reader, this damn fool knows that
too, but the important thing to remember is that
glass only reflects light at the borders where the
air stops and the glass begins. If it did reflect
internally, a good deal of the light entering a
piece of glass would indeed fail to make it out the
other side.
A final type of interaction between light and
matter is scattering, a process in which photons
crash into molecules and careen off in random
directions. This does happen in glass to some
extent, but not enough that your average human
observer would notice. See (ha!), glass — like the
similarly transparent air and water — is a fluid,
and therefore has similar scattering properties.
What?
Yes, Virginia, despite its solid appearance,
glass is really a highly viscous liquid. Rather
than undergoing a phase transition from liquid
to solid (called "freezing" by those in the know),
liquid glass — such as the stuff used by those
cheesy mall glassblowers — merely becomes
stiffer as it cools. At room temperature, the
arrangement of molecules in glass is still essen
tially random. As with many fluids, the loosely
spaced molecules of glass are not dense enough
to noticeably obstruct or scatter photons.
Glass neither absorbs, reflects, nor scatters
visible light, so the light goes right on through.
Ergo, you can see through glass. . . well. . .
because there's no reason why you shouldn't be
able to.
