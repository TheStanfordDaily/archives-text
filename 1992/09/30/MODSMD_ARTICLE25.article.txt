## Bashful Cardinal fullback stabilizes backfield Minstrell rejects limelight 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
As far as anyone knows,
there is only one Melinda Min
strell at Stanford.
But after listening to soccer
coach Berhane Andeberhan and
Minstrell, herself, describe her
play, you'd think they were
talking about two entirely dif
ferent athletes.
Andeberhan stressed the
sophomore fullback's excellent
ball-handling skills and talent.
"She's so smart, determined
and technically sound that she
rarely gets beat," he said.
Minstrell demurred. "I just
don't think my skills are that
great," she said. "When I came
in here I felt like a total klutz. I
didn't feel like I should be out
there. I work hard and that's
about all I've got going for me.
"That sounds dumb that
someone could be a decent play
er without really great skills
but I'm not that great with the
ball. It's basically technique. I
pretty much know what's going
on, but its getting the technique
down so I can do it right."
Besides skill, speed is anoth
er area in which coach and play
er opinions differ.
"I'm not really fast," Min
strell said. "But its weird
because I don't always realize
I'm not fast. Then we'll do
sprints and I'm like, 'Wait a
minute guys.'"
However, Andeberhan said
that coaches in the past have
slighted her in that area. "She
thinks it is a bigger weakness
than it is," he said.
Also the team emphasis on
defense helps neutralize speedy
opponents so Minstrell doesn't
have to go one-on-one with a
turfburner.
When No. 2 Stanford uses a
three-back defense, the outside
halfbacks help cover attackers
coming down the sidelines, tak
ing pressure off the fullbacks.
"With three defenders we don't
want to go outside too much
because then it leaves a hole in
the middle," she explained.
In the Cardinal's four-full
back system, Minstrell often
plays in the middle. But even
when she's outside, smart play
keeps her from getting beat.
"When the attacker is com
ing down on the outside,
instead of chasing someone
down the sideline, you run
towards the center," Minstrell
said. "Then you're running a
shorter distance and that saves
your butt."
In the last game, the Wash
ington coach tried to exploit
Minstrell's supposed lack of
speed by sending a lot of balls
down the sidelines. However,
the Cardinal fullback held her
own and Stanford won, 3-1.

Minstrell, who was recruited by
the Huskies, savored the victo
ry.
"The coach at one point cut
me off," she said of his underes
timation of her speed."lt was
his decision but I felt it wasn't
right so I just want to prove
every time we play them that
I'm on a damn good team and
I've improved."
But Minstrell stressed that
she still has a long way to go.
She'd like to read offensive
attacks better and use her body
more to her advantage.
"I'm lucky because I'm big
and broad and I'm going to take
up space," said the 5-foot-8 full
back. "But I need to push peo
f)le around some more. It's real
y fun to just keep them out of
the way, using your arms to
stay broad.
"There are a lot of situations
when, if you get your bodv in
front of someone, you cut tnem
off from so much. . . . Intimida
tion is a big factor. In a way it's
like basketball. You get your
butt in front of someone and
they can't get around you."
While she is more comfort
able discussing targets of
improvements rather than
established strengths, Andeber
han is not that shy.
"Like most Stanford stu
dents, she's a perfectionist," he
said. "She doesn't give herself
enough credit. She'll play a bril
liant game and come off the
field thinking about one or two
little mistakes she made.
"She's the best player to
coach because she takes advice
and criticism very well. To her,
it's acquiring useful informa
tion that will help her improve.
She's so humble and it's com
pletely genuine. She's a key per
son for us but she'd blush if she
heard me say that."
And as you'd expect from an
important contributor, she bet
tered her skills during the off
season. "She's a lot more confi
dent and she's fitter — a step
quicker than last year," Ande
berhan said. "She completely
understands what she needs to
do and that translates into
more fluid play and more confi
dence."
And when she's confident,
she's more vocal on the field. "It
depends on how happy she is
with her play," Andeberhan
said. "She'll say more when she
feels good about it. But she

demands so much from herself
that she's ouiet sometimes."
"When I'm confident I am
more vocal," she said. What?
Could player and coach be in
agreement? Well, not quite.
"But I know one time when
that wasn't the case," she said.
"I was in a different mode than
the rest of the team. I was hav
ing a great time but the only
reason I wasn't talking is
because I was tired. We were
playing four defenders and I was
pushing (the ball) upfield a lot."
Attacking in this manner is
not something fullbacks get the
chance to do very often. As pri
marily defensive players, full
backs usually initiate the

offense with a pass to an open
halfback or forward.
"That's one of the things I
love the most — the transition,"
Minstrell said. "As a defender,
when you push up, people just
freak out. 'Oh, my gosh. Who's
going to mark her?'"
In fact, last week against San
Francisco, Minstrell did some
thing fullbacks rarely do, she
scored the first Cardinal goal.
"I went up for a corner kick,"
she said. "They want some of us
who are taller to get in there
and hit it in. Normally it
doesn't get all the way through
to me so it's kind of frustrating.
"But it's still exciting just to
run for it on a corner kick. 'It
didn't get to me. . . Oh, well.
Run back. That was fun
though. I got on another part of
the field.'
"It's nice to have the excite
ment of going forward because
you're always doing the work
that doesn't get paid back. So,
every once in a while, you get to
run forward and you get all
excited. We defenders love that."
However, Minstrell considers

herself a defender at heart,
despite the thrill of offensive
play. Her first concern is guard
ing the goal.
"When we play games with
no positions I end up back," she
said. "I try to make myself go
forward but I get frustrated
when there aren't enough peo
ple (in the backfield).
"Not letting the other team
score is the most important
thing. [The fullbacks] are in a
similar situation as the goalie.
Whenever we make a mistake,
everyone can see it. But if a for
ward misses a goal it's differ
ent. You think, "We'll have
another chance. Don't worry
about it."'
Minstrell realizes her defen
sive responsibilities bring extra
pressure on herself. However,
she enjoys the intensity and
welcomes it.
"There's been a definite step
up in intensity," she said of this
year's squad. "It's something
we wanted, so it wasn't
startling."
Despite the onfield focus,
Minstrell said the team's No. 1

aim has nothing to do with
what happens between the
lines. "Our top goal is to get
everyone on the honor roll," she
said. And in an era of collegiate
athletics in which a student
athlete is, at best, a misnomer
and, at worst, a player who
passes Prop 48 and is capable of
endorsing fat checks from
boosters, the soccer squad's
goal is unique.
"After all, [academics] are
why we're here," Minstrell said.
"Its not like we can go on and
play in the NBA or something
like that."
For now, she's concentrating
on the task at hand, keeping
opponents off the scoreboard.
But Minstrell remains per
plexed about her coach's praise.
"I still can't believe Berhane
said ball-handling skills were
one of my strengths," she said.
Unable to reconcile Andeber
han's assessment with her own,
she shrugged and smiled in a
reluctant concession to his con
fidence in her abilities, "But
he's the coach so he probably
knows."
