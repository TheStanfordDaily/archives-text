# Stanford football anticipates South Bend showdown
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
The crescendo that began with Bill Walsh's
unlikely return to the Fal-m last winter will reach its
high note this Saturday, when Stanford travels to
South Bend to face Notre Dame. The sixth-ranked

Fighting Irish will present the No. 18 Cardinal with
its stiffest test of the young season, and Walsh's
involvement in both programs promises to add
intrigue to this crucial contest.
In his final autumn at NBC, Walsh broadcast six
Fighting Irish games, along the way gaining enor
mous respect for the Notre Dame program. Walsh

himself has said that without his experience broad
casting at Notre Dame — getting to know players,
rekindling his interest in teaching, tasting the
enthusiasm of collegiate athletics — he never would
have returned to the sidelines. A bit of what Walsh
gleaned from the booth has made its way into his
own system.
"We're implementing, in a sense, some forms of
what they do. We at Stanford cannot duplicate all
those things I recruiting techniques, etc.l, for a lot of
reasons. But we can learn from Lou Holtz's
approach, which, in terms of recruiting and assisting
the student athlete, is really on the cutting edge of
collegiate football," Walsh said.
But neither Holtz nor Walsh felt the broadcaster's
time in South Bend will give Stanford an unfair
insightful advantage Saturday. Holtz was private
with his gameplans, and, as Walsh said, he hardly
had time to memorize Irish blocking schemes with
his producers jabbering in one ear and Dick Enberg
prompting in another.
Which simply leaves us with one dandy match-up.
One that pits the nation's second-rated defense
against college football's most talented backfield.
One that, when it's over, will speak volumes about
the maturity of the Cardinal program
Three-game winning streaks and No. 18 rankings
still aren't that familiar at Stanford. Impressive they
are, but with a brutal schedule ahead of them, the Car
dinal could easily lose poise and stumble to a near .500
record. To play well in the midst of the Notre Dame
mystique, in front of a notional audience, would move
Stanford one step closer to being consistently men
tioned in the same breath as Washington amd UCLA.
Walsh expects no less.
"Some teams cave in (in that kind of atmosphere).
The teams that struggle are the ones still trying to
prove themselves and don't have the maturity.
"The better teams aren't affected by the mystique,
they just come in and play. I think we can go into a
stadium with a lot of folklore and just play our game,"
he said.
Offensively, the Cardinal's game will have to be a

much stronger one than they've put forth all season.
The Irish have held opponents to under 14 points
per game, and last week shut out Purdue (who earli
er beat the Weenies 41-14). Demetrius Dubose,
Notre Dame's all-everything inside linebacker who
was forced to sit out two games for allegedly taking
gifts from alumni, returned and has made 13 tackles
in two weeks.
Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom struggled
against San Jose completing only 13 of 26 passes.
The offensive line has been a concern all season;
Stenstrom cannot take the physical pounding their
porous pass blocking has subjected him to much
longer.
The strength against strength match-up will take
place when Notre Dame's offense lines up across
from the Cardinal defense. The Irish feature one of
the nation's top quarterbacks in Rick Mirer, who
Walsh said "would have been the first pick in the
NFL draft" had he come out as a junior last year.
Behind Mirer stand perhaps the best pair of backs in
college football: tailback Reggie Brooks and fullback
Jerome Bettis.
Bettis pounded the Cardinal last year for 179
yards on the ground and four touchdowns. This year
the 6-foot, 250-pound truck has average 95 yards
rushing per game. Brooks has been equally impres
sive and last week exploded for 205 yards.
Yet, if last week was any indication, Stanford's
defense will be up to the task. San Jose State gained
just 38 yards on 29 carries Saturday, and chalked up
a mere 75 total yards before their final drive of the
game. The secondary had its best week of the season,
with Vaughn Bryant, John Lynch and Billy Wittman
each picking off passes. Up front, outside linebacker
Ron George and defensive lineman Estevan Avila
added to the Cardinal's impressive sack total, which
now stands at 15.
If the Cardinal does get past Notre Dame, it will
be only the Irish's fourth home loss in six years. Of
course, Stanford handed them one of those losses
two years ago in a 36-31 shocker that knocked Notre
Dame from the No. 1 ranking.

stadium with a lot of folklore and just play our game,"
he said.
Offensively, the Cardinal's game will have to be a

much stronger one than they've put forth all season.
The Irish have held opponents to under 14 points
per game, and last week shut out Purdue (who earli
er beat the Weenies 41-14). Demetrius Dubose,
Notre Dame's all-everything inside linebacker who
was forced to sit out two games for allegedly taking
gifts from alumni, returned and has made 13 tackles
in two weeks.
Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom struggled
against San Jose completing only 13 of 26 passes.
The offensive line has been a concern all season;
Stenstrom cannot take the physical pounding their
porous pass blocking has subjected him to much
longer.
The strength against strength match-up will take
place when Notre Dame's offense lines up across
from the Cardinal defense. The Irish feature one of
the nation's top quarterbacks in Rick Mirer, who
Walsh said "would have been the first pick in the
NFL draft" had he come out as a junior last year.
Behind Mirer stand perhaps the best pair of backs in
college football: tailback Reggie Brooks and fullback
Jerome Bettis.
Bettis pounded the Cardinal last year for 179
yards on the ground and four touchdowns. This year
the 6-foot, 250-pound truck has average 95 yards
rushing per game. Brooks has been equally impres
sive and last week exploded for 205 yards.
Yet, if last week was any indication, Stanford's
defense will be up to the task. San Jose State gained
just 38 yards on 29 carries Saturday, and chalked up
a mere 75 total yards before their final drive of the
game. The secondary had its best week of the season,
with Vaughn Bryant, John Lynch and Billy Wittman
each picking off passes. Up front, outside linebacker
Ron George and defensive lineman Estevan Avila
added to the Cardinal's impressive sack total, which
now stands at 15.
If the Cardinal does get past Notre Dame, it will
be only the Irish's fourth home loss in six years. Of
course, Stanford handed them one of those losses
two years ago in a 36-31 shocker that knocked Notre
Dame from the No. 1 ranking.

Two year's after the Stanford upset of Notre Dame, Glyn Milburn looks to lead the Cardinal to another
victory In South Bend. The Cardinal offense hopes to kick Into high gear against the Fighting Irish this
Saturday.
