## CompSci to get new home in '95 
### Luis Orona 
After building an empire out
of computers, Microsoft Corpo
ration co-founder William
Gates has just helped lay the
foundation for a new Informa
tion Sciences building with a
$6 million gift to the Universi
ty.
The new $26.1 million
building, to be completed in
1995, will house the Computer
Science Department and will
bring together facilities now
located in nine different places
around campus, said Computer
Science Prof. Nils Nilsson.
The new facility, to be known
as the Gates Information Sci
ences Building, will provide bet
ter facilities and laboratories for
robotics, computer systems and
other departmental research. It
will also include six classrooms,
the largest accommodating
about 600 students.
"Besides being separated,
the facilities we have now are
substandard. We don't have
enough lab space and we can't
be close to our students while
doing research, and that's real
ly important," Nilsson said.
Microsoft Corporation has
given Stanford more than
$100,000 for scholarships, but
this is the first time Gates, who
is not a Stanford alumnus, has
made a personal gift.

Gates said he made the gift
because he wants "to invest in
the future of the industry, and
Stanford is one of the five best
computer science schools in the
country, one where many fun
damental breakthroughs have
occurred."
The new facility ought to
enable researchers to make
decisive progress in many areas
of information science, said
Electrical Engineering Prof.
John Hennessy, director of the
Computer Systems Laboratory.
For example, progress in
learning how to program multi
processors, high-performance
computers built from many
small processors, has been
much slower than their actual
production, Hennessy said
Much progress also needs to
be made in robotics and artifi
cial intelligence, areas in which
interaction is vital, said Assoc.
Computer Science Prof. Jean-
Claude Latombe, director of
the robotics laboratory.
The new building will house
about 60 percent of the Com
puter Science Department and
will be built next to the Gilbert
Biosciences Building on Serra
Street, just west of the Quad.
It is part of the planned
Stanford Near West Campus, a
group of buildings that will
provide facilities for engineer
ing and sciences programs.
