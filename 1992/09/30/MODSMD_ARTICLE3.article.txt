# Thomas' degree delayed 2 years
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Former student Stuart
Thomas' degree will apparently
be withheld for two years as a
result of a University investiga
tion into charges that he sexually
assaulted a freshman in Stern
Hall last fall.
A summary of 1991-92 judicial
cases, released yesterday, shows
only one penalty that fits
Thomas' case: a two-year delay in
degree conferral for "exploitative,
manipulative conduct."
A 17-year-old freshman woman
reported to Stanford Police in Sept.
1991 that Thomas, then a senior,
had raped her in his Casa Zapata
room. The case sparked a campus
debate on acquaintance rape and
the boundaries of consent.
The Stanford Judicial Council
held a separate hearing on the
case in May after Thomas pleaded
no contest in Santa Clara County
Superior Court to two misde
meanors — statutory rape and
providing alcohol to a minor — in
January.
He was sentenced to two years
of probation, 100 hours of com
munity service and a $1,000 fine
in the criminal case.

Because the University hear
ing was not made public, Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole said she
could not comment on the case
nor confirm the penalty.
But she said in June that the
Stanford Judicial Council had
sent a report to the University
president, which only happens if
the council finds that the student
violated University policy.
Melvin de la Motte, the lawyer
who represented Thomas in the
criminal case, called the decision
to charge him with exploitative,
manipulative conduct "bizarre."
"That sounds pretty vague and
nebulous," de la Motte said. "If
'exploitative' means that a senior
goes out with a freshman and
sweet talks them, isn't that what
happens all the time?"
De la Motte said he did not rep
resent Thomas before the Judicial
Council, but added that it seemed
like "some mucky-mucks at Stan
ford decided he wasn't punished
harshly enough and came up with
some nebulous phrase."
Having separate criminal and
University proceedings "sounds
like double jeopardy," he said.
But Kathy Zonana, a senior who
worked in Stanford's Sexual
Assault Information and Resources
Center last summer, said the sepa
rate hearings are "absolutely fair."
There is a California criminal
code and a Stanford code of con
duct, she said, so "students need to
follow both." Zonana added that it
was "unfortunate that (the Univer
sity case) took so long to resolve."
Asked whether Thomas' pun
ishment was fair, Zonana said
that "if he did what he sounds like
he did, no, it wasn't enough."
De la Motte, however, objected
to the penalty set by the Universi
ty. "I don't think (Thomas'l
degree should have been held up
for any reason," he said.
A range of punishments was
available to the council, from
fines to community service to a
revocation of his degree. Their
recommendation had to be
approved by former University
President Donald Kennedy.

This was the first time a Univer
sity investigation of alleged sexual
misconduct led to formal charges
against a student, according to Cole.
She said she had hoped to
release more information about
Thomas' case in order to educate
the community, but is prevented
from doing so by the University's
Legislative and Judicial Charter.
In 1985, Kennedy had autho
rized release of information about
a drunk-driving case. But Cole said
that student had "opted for an
open hearing" and Thomas did not.
The charter gives the person
charged the right to "be assured
that, in private hearings, any
matters of fact which would tend
to identify the person charged
would be kept confidential."
Thomas earned enough units
to graduate fall quarter last year,
but his degree was withheld pend
ing the University's judicial
affairs investigation.
The council, an appointed body
of 11 students and faculty, makes
the final evaluation of judicial
affairs violations before sending a
report to the University president.
