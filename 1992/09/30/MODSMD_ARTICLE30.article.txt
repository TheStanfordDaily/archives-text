# Security stats show sobering trend

### Kimberly Chrisman Senior staff writer 
A new publication listing safety and securi
ty statistics for the past three years reveals
definite but opposing trends in campus crime.
Building and vehicular burglary are on the
rise, while drug and alcohol violations have
dropped dramatically.
University officials attribute the recent
decline in alcohol violations — from 235 in
1989 to 38 in the first half of 1992 — to sever
al factors, including the alcohol policy institut
ed in Nov. 1990, programs sponsored by the
Office of Residential Education and other
groups and changing policies and practices
among students and administrators.
"I would attribute it to the alcohol policy
and the work that we have been doing over the
years through Res Ed and other community
programs," said Dean of Students Michael
Jackson. "One of the other factors is there are

a lot more efforts in high schools to teach stu
dents what we're trying to teach."
Jackson also cited the changing nature of
campus social events, which often center
around athletics or community service rather
than alcohol consumption.
"Very rarely do we have the large, out-of
control fraternity parties," he said. "That's not
to say that people aren't drinking, but there's
no stigma in not drinking.
"It's just not cool to get drunk and sloppy,
you know? I think a lot of students believe
that now," Jackson added.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
attributed the trend to "the change in the fed
eral law placing responsibility on universities
to reduce alcohol abuse on campus and the fact
that we have barred alcohol in the stadium."
"Our alcohol arrests are generally on-the
street arrests for public drunkenness or drunk
driving," he said.
Herrington also commended programs

sponsored by Cowell Student Health Center,
including Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices, the Health Promotion Program and
Project R 2 ISC.
"Over the past few years, those programs
have begun to pay off," he said. "Student
groups are better at running parties now
because they have these alternatives."
While the decrease in alcohol violations can
be attributed to the collective effort of several
groups, other crime trends have more specific
causes, Herrington said.
"As for the drug violations, all I've got to
say to you is Grateful Dead," he said. "1989
was the last year the Grateful Dead was here.
We made over 40 arrests at that one concert."
According to the booklet, 61 drug-related
arrests were made in 1989 alone, and only 26
have been made since that year.
Herrington blamed this year's 37 percent
increase in vehicular burglaries to a rash of relat
ed crimes which were not limited to the campus.
