# Dorms vie for trees, awareness in campus recycling contest

The Stanford Recycling Center's sth
annual residence-based recycling contest
kicked off Tuesday, aiming to educate
students about "correct" recycling. Win
ning residences will receive trees as
prizes.
The center's judging criteria will take
into account both per capita volume of
recycled material and general orderliness
of the 55-gallon recycling containers,

according to the center's Public Educa
tion Manager Heidi Clark.
"There is a problem with judging sole
ly on volume," Clark said. "This is not
meant to be an encouragement of con
sumption.
"Our effort is to educate and increase
awareness that recycling is an ongoing
concern," Clark said.
She said that the center would cam
paign most vigorously in dormitories,
which in the past have had the poorest

record of recycling.
While cooperative houses in past con
tests have averaged about 33 gallons of
recycled material per student, dorm stu
dents have managed to recycle just 13
gallons apiece over the course of a quar
ter.
Clark said that recycling levels have
generally been 15-20 percent higher dur
ing past contests than in the previous
spring quarter.
The recycling center hopes this com

petitive enthusiasm will develop into a
habitual commitment to recycling by stu
dents, Clark said.
To promote such a change and
increase its visibility, the organization is
planning a widespread campaign that
includes slide shows and clear instruc
tions on proper disposal techniques in
recycling areas .
But if environmental sensitivity does
not foster waste reduction at Stanford,
economic and political imperatives might.

According to Clark, rising costs for
garbage disposal, coupled with California
state legislation that mandates the Uni
versity recycle 25 percent of its waste by
1995 and 50 percent by the year 2000
could heighten the importance of the
recycling center's future campaigns.
The contest will run throughout fall
quarter. The top two residences in each
of the three divisions — cooperative resi
dences, self-operative houses and dormi
tories — will receive prizes.
