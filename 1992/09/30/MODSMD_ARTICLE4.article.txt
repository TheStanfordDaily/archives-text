## Misconduct cases up slightly last year 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
The number of campus mis
conduct cases — including 20
Honor Code and 11 Fundamental
Standard violations — rose
slightly last year, according to a
summary released yesterday by
the Judicial Affairs Office.
In 1990-91, there were 28 vio
lations, down from 49 the year
before.
But the number of cases isn't
really indicative of honesty at
Stanford, according to Judicial
Affairs Officer Sally Cole, because
she has "no idea what the real
incidence of misconduct is."
Fundamental Standard offens
es included assault, false allega
tions, harassment, theft and falsi
fying data. Penalties ranged from
a 25-hour work fine to a year's
suspension.
Expulsion is the maximum pun
ishment, but Cole said there have
been only two in the last 10 years.

"The sanctions reflect the insti
tution's philosophy of student
behavior," she said. "Stanford
assumes students can learn from
their mistakes." Repeat offenses
are "very rare," said Cole.
Two students this year were
charged with submitting someone
else's work. One received a two
year suspension, and the other
was suspended indefinitely with a
two-year minimum. With an
indefinite suspension, Cole said,
the student has to prove it is in
the best interest of the University
that he or she return.
Plagiarism and receiving imper
missible aid led to five Honor Code
cases each, while four students
were found guilty of stealing and
submitting another student's
work.
Half of the Honor Code cases
arose in Computer Science or
other departments of the School
of Engineering. The remaining
cases came from Great Works
CIV and the Departments of Psy
chology, Anthropology, Physics,
Chemistry, Mathematics and
Communication.
Students admit their guilt in
the "vast majority" of cases end
ing in penalties, Cole said. Just

one of last year's cases was heard
by the Stanford Judicial Council,
and another is still pending before
the council.
Of the 1991-92 cases, more
than 80 percent involved men,
while 20 involved graduate stu
dents.
The Judicial Affairs Office
issues a summary of misconduct
cases each fall. Student names
and details from the hearings are
not released.
