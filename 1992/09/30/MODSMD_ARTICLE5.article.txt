# Kimball loses late-night pizza perks; Stern scores 'slice of heaven'
## 
### Michael Slemmer 
Incoming Kimball Hall residents have
found that their dormitory is no longer
Stanford's late-night pizza Mecca.
Last year's successful experiment has
been transferred to Stern Hall, where it
has been added to the residence's after
hours grill service.
The decision was sparked by the
immense success of the service when it
was introduced last year, according to
Craig Mitchell, food service administrator.

Its popularity simply outstripped the
capabilities of Kimball's kitchen and staff,
which Mitchell described as "inadequate
for the students' demand for pizza."
Kimball pizza opened last February
and was a tremendous success, attracting
more than 100 students on the first night.
The relocated service has already
attracted large numbers of students, and
many more are expected in the upcoming
months, according to Virginia Varkonyi,
Stern food service manager.
By switching the location from Kim-

ball to Stern, the pizza service will be
faster and better, she added.
The kitchen is currently being remodeled
to provide an area specifically for pizza ser
vice. Full production will be available in
three to four weeks.
"We moved to make the service better
and I think it will be a total success,"
Varkonyi said.
Stern residents agreed that the move
did not hurt the quality of the pizza.
"Stern pizza is like a slice of heaven," said
freshman Danny Bressler.

Now that the late-night pizza and grill
services are both located in Stern, the grill,
which now closes at 10 p.m., may be stay
ing open later as well.
"It all depends on the business we
get," Mitchell said. "The more students
we have, the later we'll stay open."
Although several Stern residents have
expressed concern about the size of this
new pizza venture, Mitchell said their
fears would be assuaged by the fact that
the pizza service will be at their doorstep.
"It's great because I live here," said

sophomore Dave Groves.
Some Stern residents added that Kim
ball residents already have enough benefits.
"It is great for midnight study breaks,
and Kimball's been spoiled enough," said
freshman Vanessa Alvarado.
As with the Kimball pizza service, stu
dents can still use meal cards or cash to buy
pizza and other snacks such as frozen
yogurt. The grill and pizza service in Stern
are open Sunday through Thursday nights.
