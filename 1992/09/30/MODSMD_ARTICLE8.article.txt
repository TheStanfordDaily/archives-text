# Hail to the chief
## Fetter accepts offer she couldn't refuse 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
For nearly a decade, Jean Fet
ter's task as dean of undergradu
ate admissions was to bring anx
ious freshmen into Stanford.
This year, she begins that task
once more with a freshman quite
a bit older, perhaps a bit less anx
ious, and just as new to Stanford:
University President Gerhard
Casper.
Selected as Casper's top assis
tant over the summer, Fetter will
be the "chief of staff" of the pres
ident's office and act as one of
Casper's closest advisers.
Entering her 17th year at
Stanford and working with her
third president, Fetter confessed
that she is "beginning to feel like
an old-timer."
Although Fetter has held five
administrative positions at Stan
ford — including a three-year stint
as former University President
Richard Lyman's top assistant in
the late 1970s — it is her career as
admissions dean that has made her
a popular campus figure, known
affectionately as "Dean Jean."

And two years after leaving that
job, she still often speaks in terms
of admissions: She realizes with
faint horror that the average Stan
ford undergraduate was only five
years old when she began as
Lyman's assistant, and she retains
a fingertip-knowledge of U.S. high
schools from California to Maine.
Fetter marvels at the circuitous
path that led to her appointment
as Casper's assistant, just one year
after she resigned her admissions
post last June to write a book on
her experiences.
"It's a classic example of how
life evolves," she said. "It's full of
the unexpected."
Fetter had planned to take a
year-long sabbatical, lecture in
the School of Education and write
her book.
But a few months later, then-
Board of Trustees President James
Gaither approached her about
becoming executive vice chair of
the search committee that eventu
ally selected Casper as president.
"That's an offer that's very
hard to refuse," Fetter said. "This

happens once every 10 years at
Stanford."
So she put her book aside and
immersed herself in managing
the search committee, which
turned into a five-month, full
time job.
Fetter joked that only a short
time after setting up an office in the
Education School, she was so busy
with the committee that she "was
going back once a week to water my
plant and collect my mail."
In March, with the job com
pleted, Fetter returned to writing
her book. But as Casper searched
for an assistant this summer he
realized that Fetter's experience
on the search committee — along
with her long career at Stanford
— would be invaluable traits.
Announcing her appointment
in July, Casper said, "The variety
of experience Ms. Fetter has is
obviously a tremendous attrac
tion for me because I still have to
learn about the Stanford institu
tion, Stanford people and Stan
ford problems."
And during the process of eval
uating candidates, the search
committee "first of all tried to
find out what bugs people," which
means Fetter is familiar with the
concerns of people in most areas
of the University, Casper said.

Since beginning her new job
Sept. 1, Fetter has kept a hectic
pace. "Building 10 is never dull,"
she said. "There's no such thing
as a typical day in the president's
office."
The job has been made more
challenging by Casper's stream
lining of the University's admin
istration, which vastly expanded
Fetter's set of responsibilities.
When Vice President for Public
Affairs Bob Freelen retires Feb.
28, Fetter will begin supervising
many of the offices that had been
overseen by Freelen — whose
position was eliminated by
Casper's restructuring.
These four offices include Gov
ernment Relations, which will
play a critical role in solidifying
Stanford's financial future by
helping to negotiate a new indi
rect-cost rate with the federal
government.
A graduate of Oxford Universi
ty who holds three physics
degrees, Fetter has been a long
time advocate for increasing the
representation of women in scien
tific fields.
As the only woman on the
physics faculty at San Jose State
for eight years during the 1960s
and early '70s, Fetter said she
"really felt a responsibility to
encourage young women to be
physics majors."
She was also the victim of some
subtle sexism herself. Fetter
recalls the first physics lecture

she taught at San Jose State in
1966.
Arriving early, she sat in a chair
at the front of the classroom as stu
dents began to filter in. One male
student eventually approached her
and asked, "Are you auditing this
class?' "
"I said, 'No, I'm teaching this
class,' " Fetter said. "I never for
gave him for that. I don't think he
ever recovered from that, either."
But despite her science back
ground, Fetter is passionate
about improving the humanities
and helping students take greater
advantage of Stanford's opportu
nities, such as overseas studies.
She also wishes that students
would make more of an effort to
establish relationships with faculty.
"I'm sometimes dismayed
when I talk to graduating seniors
who say they don't know any fac
ulty well enough to have them
write a recommendation," she
said. "Some people don't even
know their advisers."
Fetter finished the first draft
of her book on admissions in mid-
August. It examines affirmative
action and multiculturalism,
describes some of the "ethical
dilemmas" she faced, and offers
case studies of some of the "par
ticularly challenging decisions"
they made, Fetter said.
"It was therapeutic for me to
put into words some of the
thoughts I had had in admis
sions," she said.

the School of Education and write
her book.
But a few months later, then-
Board of Trustees President James
Gaither approached her about
becoming executive vice chair of
the search committee that eventu
ally selected Casper as president.
"That's an offer that's very
hard to refuse," Fetter said. "This

happens once every 10 years at
Stanford."
So she put her book aside and
immersed herself in managing
the search committee, which
turned into a five-month, full
time job.
Fetter joked that only a short
time after setting up an office in the
Education School, she was so busy
with the committee that she "was
going back once a week to water my
plant and collect my mail."
In March, with the job com
pleted, Fetter returned to writing
her book. But as Casper searched
for an assistant this summer he
realized that Fetter's experience
on the search committee — along
with her long career at Stanford
— would be invaluable traits.
Announcing her appointment
in July, Casper said, "The variety
of experience Ms. Fetter has is
obviously a tremendous attrac
tion for me because I still have to
learn about the Stanford institu
tion, Stanford people and Stan
ford problems."
And during the process of eval
uating candidates, the search
committee "first of all tried to
find out what bugs people," which
means Fetter is familiar with the
concerns of people in most areas
of the University, Casper said.

Since beginning her new job
Sept. 1, Fetter has kept a hectic
pace. "Building 10 is never dull,"
she said. "There's no such thing
as a typical day in the president's
office."
The job has been made more
challenging by Casper's stream
lining of the University's admin
istration, which vastly expanded
Fetter's set of responsibilities.
When Vice President for Public
Affairs Bob Freelen retires Feb.
28, Fetter will begin supervising
many of the offices that had been
overseen by Freelen — whose
position was eliminated by
Casper's restructuring.
These four offices include Gov
ernment Relations, which will
play a critical role in solidifying
Stanford's financial future by
helping to negotiate a new indi
rect-cost rate with the federal
government.
A graduate of Oxford Universi
ty who holds three physics
degrees, Fetter has been a long
time advocate for increasing the
representation of women in scien
tific fields.
As the only woman on the
physics faculty at San Jose State
for eight years during the 1960s
and early '70s, Fetter said she
"really felt a responsibility to
encourage young women to be
physics majors."
She was also the victim of some
subtle sexism herself. Fetter
recalls the first physics lecture

she taught at San Jose State in
1966.
Arriving early, she sat in a chair
at the front of the classroom as stu
dents began to filter in. One male
student eventually approached her
and asked, "Are you auditing this
class?' "
"I said, 'No, I'm teaching this
class,' " Fetter said. "I never for
gave him for that. I don't think he
ever recovered from that, either."
But despite her science back
ground, Fetter is passionate
about improving the humanities
and helping students take greater
advantage of Stanford's opportu
nities, such as overseas studies.
She also wishes that students
would make more of an effort to
establish relationships with faculty.
"I'm sometimes dismayed
when I talk to graduating seniors
who say they don't know any fac
ulty well enough to have them
write a recommendation," she
said. "Some people don't even
know their advisers."
Fetter finished the first draft
of her book on admissions in mid-
August. It examines affirmative
action and multiculturalism,
describes some of the "ethical
dilemmas" she faced, and offers
case studies of some of the "par
ticularly challenging decisions"
they made, Fetter said.
"It was therapeutic for me to
put into words some of the
thoughts I had had in admis
sions," she said.
For nearly a decade, Jean Fet
ter's task as dean of undergradu
ate admissions was to bring anx
ious freshmen into Stanford.
This year, she begins that task
once more with a freshman quite
a bit older, perhaps a bit less anx
ious, and just as new to Stanford:
University President Gerhard
Casper.
Selected as Casper's top assis
tant over the summer, Fetter will
be the "chief of staff" of the pres
ident's office and act as one of
Casper's closest advisers.
Entering her 17th year at
Stanford and working with her
third president, Fetter confessed
that she is "beginning to feel like
an old-timer."
Although Fetter has held five
administrative positions at Stan
ford — including a three-year stint
as former University President
Richard Lyman's top assistant in
the late 1970s — it is her career as
admissions dean that has made her
a popular campus figure, known
affectionately as "Dean Jean."

And two years after leaving that
job, she still often speaks in terms
of admissions: She realizes with
faint horror that the average Stan
ford undergraduate was only five
years old when she began as
Lyman's assistant, and she retains
a fingertip-knowledge of U.S. high
schools from California to Maine.
Fetter marvels at the circuitous
path that led to her appointment
as Casper's assistant, just one year
after she resigned her admissions
post last June to write a book on
her experiences.
"It's a classic example of how
life evolves," she said. "It's full of
the unexpected."
Fetter had planned to take a
year-long sabbatical, lecture in
the School of Education and write
her book.
