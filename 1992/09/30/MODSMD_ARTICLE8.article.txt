# Hail to the chief
## Fetter accepts offer she couldn't refuse 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
For nearly a decade, Jean Fet
ter's task as dean of undergradu
ate admissions was to bring anx
ious freshmen into Stanford.
This year, she begins that task
once more with a freshman quite
a bit older, perhaps a bit less anx
ious, and just as new to Stanford:
University President Gerhard
Casper.
Selected as Casper's top assis
tant over the summer, Fetter will
be the "chief of staff" of the pres
ident's office and act as one of
Casper's closest advisers.
Entering her 17th year at
Stanford and working with her
third president, Fetter confessed
that she is "beginning to feel like
an old-timer."
Although Fetter has held five
administrative positions at Stan
ford — including a three-year stint
as former University President
Richard Lyman's top assistant in
the late 1970s — it is her career as
admissions dean that has made her
a popular campus figure, known
affectionately as "Dean Jean."

And two years after leaving that
job, she still often speaks in terms
of admissions: She realizes with
faint horror that the average Stan
ford undergraduate was only five
years old when she began as
Lyman's assistant, and she retains
a fingertip-knowledge of U.S. high
schools from California to Maine.
Fetter marvels at the circuitous
path that led to her appointment
as Casper's assistant, just one year
after she resigned her admissions
post last June to write a book on
her experiences.
"It's a classic example of how
life evolves," she said. "It's full of
the unexpected."
Fetter had planned to take a
year-long sabbatical, lecture in
the School of Education and write
her book.
But a few months later, then-
Board of Trustees President James
Gaither approached her about
becoming executive vice chair of
the search committee that eventu
ally selected Casper as president.
"That's an offer that's very
hard to refuse," Fetter said. "This
