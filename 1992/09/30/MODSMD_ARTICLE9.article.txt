# Rodin collection '3 Shades' bigger

Cantor and his wife Iris have
donated 35 Auguste Rodin
sculptures worth $11.5 million
to the Stanford Art Museum.
The Cantors also gave seven
pieces sculpted by Rodin's con
temporaries to enable the art
directors to create an atmo
sphere of 19th century art.
The most recent donation
brings the number of Rodins
given to Stanford by the Cantors
to 187.
The most important work in
the new donation is The Three
Shades, a depiction of three trag
ic figures which are life-size repli
cas of smaller counterparts locat
ed on top of The Gates of Hell.
The Gates of Hell represents
the focal point of the Rodin
Sculpture Garden, and The
Three Shades will soon be
placed at the garden's entrance.
All of the pieces from the
Cantor Collections were intend
ed to be donated to Stanford,
according to Stanford Art Pro
fessor Albert Elsen, but some of
the sculptures have been on loan
for tax purposes.
The Cantors have loaned
pieces to Stanford "always with
the intent to give," Elsen said.
Stanford now possesses the sec
ond largest and the second most
important collection of Rodins in
the world, Elsen said. The Rodin
museum in France, Rodin's moth
er countiy, continues to house the
largest number of his works.
According to Elsen, there are
many reasons the Cantors elect
ed to give their collections to
Stanford.
Stanford has ample space to
display most of the collection on
a year-round basis, he said.
The Cantors also wanted the
sculptures to be at a place where
they could be used for both teach
ing and research, Elsen said.
"Stanford is the only place in
the world where you can see such
a big collection of Rodins 24 hours

a day, all year round," Elsen said.
It is also the only place which
lights the sculptures from below
at night because Rodin wanted his
viewers to experience his works in
different settings.
The sculptures are lighted
from below because "you just
can't compete with the Califor
nia sun," Elsen said.
Over the years many Stanford
students have been able to study
these Rodins. For instance, Kirk
Varnedoe, last year's commence
ment speaker, wrote his doctoral
thesis on Rodin. Elsen himself
teaches an art history class on
Rodin for undergraduates.
Andy Paul, a junior who took
Elsen's class last year, said one
of his best memories was of an
optional outdoor class when
Elsen took students around
campus to study various figures
from the Burghers of Calais.
The statues scattered around
campus are casts or reproduc
tions of the original, which was
made in one piece.
" 'Go up and touch it,' Elsen
would say. 'Don't be afraid.',"
Paul said.
"The coolest thing was that
Rodin's style is very exaggerat
ed. Big hands, big feet, very
sharp," said Paul. "Almost
impossible muscle definition"
becomes very obvious when
comparing one's own hand with
that of the statue.
. "It's the kind of thing you
can't learn from a picture," said
Paul. "When you see a statue and
you put your hands on it, not only
do you see how well-sculpted they
are, but how difficult sculpting
something like that would be."
Elsen explained that having
the sculptures on display allows
students to experience art first
hand.
"In other fields like English,
you experience creativity
through the printed work sec
ond-hand, but with these works
of art, you have a direct experi
ence with creativity," Elsen said.
Elsen's class on Rodin will be
offered again next year.
