# Attorney general intensifies Bookstore investigation
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
The California attorney general has
intensified its investigation of the Stan
ford Bookstore, launching a second phase
that will include subpoenas and sworn
testimony from Bookstore officials,
according to Deputy Attorney General
Jim Schwartz.
The more formal inquiry could be the
prelude to a lawsuit or financial claim by
the state against the Bookstore, though
Schwartz would not specify what action
his office might take.
Initially expected to take only a few
months, the investigation will now pro
ceed without any foreseeable deadline,
Schwartz said.
State investigators began their inquiry
last February, after The Daily reported
that the Bookstore was providing its
employees with a host of lavish
perquisites, including luxury cars, a

motorhome and a vacation home.
Subsequent investigation disclosed
that the Bookstore had lost $2 million in
the stock market in 1991 due to what one
director of the store described as "hor
rendous" investment decisions made by a
former employee.
The Bookstore is a tax-exempt, non-prof
it organization run independently of the
University and overseen by a board of direc
tors consisting of Stanford faculty, staff
and, in some years, one or two students.
The board's designated spokesperson,
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg, said yester
day that the board has received notice
from the attorney general that its investi
gation has entered a stage of "statutory
formality."
Schwartz would not specify what
issues his staff will scrutinize further.
But he said it is "fair to say" that the next
phase of the investigation is "more seri
ous" than the first and is "justified by the
findings made thus far."

Weisberg, however,
called the next phase
"extremely duplicative"
and said the Bookstore
has cooperated with the
attorney general's re
quests for information.
He added that the expan
sion of the inquiry will
force the Bookstore to

incur heavy legal expenses.

Legal and accounting expenses con
nected with the inquiry and the Book
store's internal investigation have
already cost more than $300,000, Weis
berg said.
No employees or officials have yet been
asked to testify, Weisberg said. He added
that he does not know what issues the
subsequent investigation will focus on.
Potential for liability
The formalization of similar state
investigations is typically prompted when

preliminary inquiry
reveals the potential for
significant liability.
Where investigators
find evidence of wrongdo
ing, cases are usually set
tled out of court and
involve some kind of mon
etary restitution to the
state. But if the parties fail
to settle, the attorney gen-

eral typically proceeds by intensifying evi
dence-gathering and filing a formal lawsuit.
The revelations about the Bookstore's
unusual compensation practices came at
a time when many non-profit organiza
tions were undergoing scrutiny by state
government and the Internal Revenue
Service.
The Bookstore had been leasing the
central California vacation home from
Colleagues Management, a consulting
firm privately owned by the store's two
senior managers, Eldon Speed and Philip

Chiaramonte. Through its lease pay
ments, the Bookstore was effectively pay
ing off about $200,000 in loans the man
agers obtained in the mid-'Bos to finance
construction of the home.
The Bookstore also spent more than
$69,000 to furnish the home.
In addition to the arrangement on the
home, the Bookstore was leasing a Holi
day Rambler motor home from Col
leagues Management. Eight senior
employees were also provided with Book
store-owned or -leased automobiles.
At least $5 million of the store's
reserve funds were invested in the stock
market by the Bookstore's controller,
Patrick McDonald, including invest
ments that Weisberg described in March
as "rather speculative."
McDonald acted without the knowl
edge of the store's general manager and
board, Weisberg said in March.

McDonald's employment was
terminated after the store's gen
eral manager discovered the
investment activity and McDon
ald failed to rectify it.
The Bookstore subsequently
sold the investments at a loss of at
least $1.8 million.
State investigators have been
examining whether these inci
dents violated state tax laws gov
erning non-profit corporations,
which are restricted both in their
financial activities and in the
amount and type of compensation
they can provide to employees.
Weisberg said the board is still
unwinding the financial relation
ship between the Bookstore and

Colleagues Management.
Weisberg said last month that
the Bookstore will be "significant
ly compensated" by Speed and
Chiaramonte for the money it
invested in the vacation home.
But the details and amount of
that compensation still have not
been determined, Weisberg said
yesterday.
During the summer, Speed and
Chiaramonte oversaw the sale of
five of the cars formerly provided
to senior employees. The leases
on the other cars have expired or
been cancelled, Weisberg said.
The salaries of those employ
ees formerly furnished with the
cars were increased to compen
sate for the loss of the perquisites,
Weisberg said.
But Speed's and Chiara
monte's salaries were increased
by less than what the board

thought was the value of the
perquisites they gave up, Weis
berg added.
The directors also approved a
plan for reforming the Book
store's governance by providing
for stronger board oversight and
by bringing in directors who have
legal and business experience.
The plan awaits the approval
of the Bookstore's association, a
group of 40 faculty, staff and stu
dents who elect the directors and
must approve any by-law
changes.
The board also recently
approved a 15 percent rebate for
book purchases made during the
last school year. Weisberg said the
completion of the Bookstore's
remodeling allowed it to increase
the annual rebate from the 10
percent rebates it had given the
last two years.
