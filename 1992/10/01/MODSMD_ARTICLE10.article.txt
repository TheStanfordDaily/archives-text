Bush-Clinton debates likely
(AP) —The agreement to open talks on a
debate schedule came after a day of jockeying by
the candidates and their staffs.
"Let's not delay it for two weeks, let's start
Sunday," Clinton said, responding to Bush's call
for four Sunday-night debates beginning Oct. 11.
Bush countered that when it came to his
debate offer, Clinton was behaving "the same way
he's responded to issues like free trade, fuel effi
ciency standards, and middle-class taxes. He waf
fles."
Bush had been on the defensive on the issue,
forcing a bipartisan commission to cancel three
proposed debates when he rejected their format.
The announcement that the two sides would
meet greatly increased the likelihood there would be
debates this fall. The potential for an overpowering

performance — or an unforgettable gaffe — means
the debates could completely remake the race.
'Drop-out' Perot spent millions
WASHINGTON (AP) — Ross Perot continued
to spend millions after he dropped from the presi
dential race in July, maintaining a 50-state organi
zation and quietly preparing campaign advertising.
Those expenditures have put Perot in position
for an "October surprise" return if he chooses to
make that move today.
At the same time he was spending the money,
Perot was declaring that he wouldn't play a spoil
er's role.
Campaign finance reports show Perot has spent
$18.5 million since first mentioning the possibility
of an independent campaign. But more than half
that total has been spent since he withdrew.
