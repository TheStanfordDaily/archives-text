Family leave veto upheld
WASHINGTON (AP) — In yesterday's ses
sion, the House of Representatives failed to over
ride President Bush's veto of a bill that would
require many businesses to grant workers time
off for family emergencies.
The veto held as the representatives voted
mostly along party lines. But despite the partisan
split, 42 Democrats deserted their party and voted
to sustain Bush's veto. Thirty-eight Republicans
voted to override their president.
The action is the second time Bush has vetoed
a family leave bill and made it stick. Although he
voiced support for the concept during his 1988
election campaign, Bush vetoed a similar measure
in 1990.
In light of the veto, Democrats pledged to
redouble efforts to make "family leave" a
issue in the campaign for the White House.
Fire chars Calif, timber
KYBURZ, Calif. (AP) — A wind-driven wildfire
which charred $66 million worth of timber

est in Northern California yesterday.
The fire, which started Tuesday afternoon in
the Eldorado National Forest, had burned 16,300
acres and 26 structures by yesterday afternoon.
"After six years of drought, the brush and

trees are very dry. The terrain is difficult for
fighting fires. That's all mixed in with the weath
er. .. . Those factors are coming together to pro
duce firestorms. We have dry trees popping and
bursting," said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman
Mary Hale.
El Dorado County officials yesterday asked
Gov. Pete Wilson to declare a state of emergency.
World celebrates Brazil's peace
(AP) — The news from Brazil of the impeach
ment of President Fernando Collor de Mello
prompted banner headlines in Latin America yes
terday. It was treated as a positive political phe
nomenon in the region: the peaceful, constitu
tional removal of a president by another branch of
government.
"Six or eight years ago, Brazil's situation in any
other Latin American country would have pro
duced a coup. This is the first time that has not
happened," said Dante Caputo, the former presi
dent of the U.N. General Assembly.
Collor's impeachment was watched particular
ly closely in Venezuela, where the congress has
tried to impeach President Carlos Andres Perez.
"Brazil has shown that it is possible to strip a
president from the presidency within the legal,
constitutional framework," said Teodoro Petkoff,
leader of Venezuela's leftist Movement Toward
Socialism.
