# Possible peace in Croatia
## Yugoslavs agree to retreat

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegov
ina (AP) â€” Serbian-dominated
Yugoslavia agreed yesterday to
pull its army from a strategic
peninsula in Croatia by Oct. 20
and said it would enter talks on
recognizing Croatia, a former
Yugoslav republic.
Britain's Lord Owen said the
agreement reached in Geneva
between presidents Dobrica Cosic
of Yugoslavia and Franjo Tubman
of Croatia represented a significant
step along the hard road to peace.
Tudjman and Cosic, meeting
for the first time, agreed on the
date for troop withdrawal from
the southern Prevlaka peninsula,
which juts from Croatia's Adriat
ic coast bordering Montenegro,
and to set up a committee to dis
cuss normalization of relations.
A pullout from the peninsula
would permit an end to the
Yugoslav blockade of the historic
port of Dubrovnik, the scene of
intense fighting during the six

month war in Croatia last year.
Croatia declared independence
from Yugoslavia in June 1991. Bel
grade tried to crush the secession,
and 10,000 people were lulled in
the six-month war that followed.
Fighting was halted for the
most part by cease-fire in Jan
uary, but Serbs still occupy about
one-third of Croatia, in zones
patrolled by U.N. peacekeepers.
Both Tudjman and Cosic said
they hoped Bosnian President
Alija Izetbegovic could be with
them at future meetings.
Bosnia is now the focus of fight
ing among Serbs, Croats and Mus
lims. U.N. relief officials on Tues
day warned that up to 400,000 peo
ple in Bosnia could die from expo
sure and lack of food this winter.
Diplomats trying to end ethnic
fighting in former Yugoslav
republics said earlier that relief
flights to Sarajevo, the besieged
capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
could resume by the weekend.

Yugoslavia, now consisting
only of Serbia and Montenegro,
appealed to the Security Council
yesterday to relax economic sanc
tions against the country so it can
import heating oil for the coming
winter.
"It is necessary to consider the
very tragic situation for the chil
dren, the ill and old people," Pre
mier Milan Panic wrote to the
Security Council.
The United States, responding
to warnings of a severe winter, said
yesterday it was ready to resume
flights of food and medicine to
Bosnia and will consider Belgrade's
appeal for delivery of home heating
oil.
Humanitarian flights to Saraje
vo were suspended Sept. 3 after an
Italian relief plane was shot down
by a missile. State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said
U.S. military planners had con
cluded it was safe to resume
flights.
