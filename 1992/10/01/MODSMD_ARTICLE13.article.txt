# White House stalls 76 EPA regs

### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Seventy-six new regulations
prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency
are being held up by the White House — some in vio
lation of congressional deadlines — according to a
confidential EPA report.
The stalled regulations include some of the major
provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act intended to con
trol smog, reduce acid rain, protect the ozone layer
and reduce toxic air pollutants.
"The administration is holding up numerous
rules, which is illegal, and which is not consistent
with the goal of protecting human health and the
environment," said a senior EPA official who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
The report says that eight regulations are cur
rently being blocked by the White House even
though congressional deadlines for their completion
have passed. A copy of the Sept. 22 report was
obtained by The Associated Press.
Among the blocked regulations is the set of rules
governing the trading of air pollution emissions. The
rules were due May 15.
Another regulation that missed its deadline
requires tighter emission controls on new incinera

tors and chemical plants.
David Cohen, a spokesman for EPA Administra
tor William Reilly, had no comment on the report.
Meg Brackney of the White House Office of Manage
ment and Budget, which conducts the regulatory
reviews, said yesterday officials there had not seen
the report and couldn't comment on it.
Many regulations without congressional dead
lines also are being delayed by the White House,
according to the report.
Rep. Henry Wax man, Democratic chairman of
the House's Health and Environment Subcommit
tee, said the White House has "tried to rewrite the
law by forcing the Bush-appointed EPA officials to
act contrary to what the law requires of them."
Earlier refusals by the White House to clear reg
ulations have resulted in several lawsuits directed at
ordering the EPA to take action, including one by
Wax man.
According to Waxman's subcommittee, the EPA
has missed 46 deadlines set by Congress under the
Clean Air Act. Another set of deadlines comes due
Nov. 15, and many of the regulations to be complet
ed then are stalled at the White House.
