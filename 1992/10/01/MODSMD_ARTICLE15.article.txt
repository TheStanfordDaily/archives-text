## So long low tuition 
### 
Bulky state subsidies
in danger of destroying
California college system

Affordable college
for all — it's a pretty
thought. But at a time when
social programs are getting slashed,
and the California state budget is
shrivelling faster than a "Garfield
Shrinky Dink" at 350 F, such an
ideal may no longer be realistic.
State schools are one of the last
programs in the country that offer
blind tuition subsidies, indepen
dent of actual financial need. Stu
dents with more money than the
Stanford Theater earns in an en
tire year, pay the same price for
public education as do students
working two jobs.
This year, the state appropriat
ed $1.88 billion for the University
of California system and $1.52 bil
lion for California State University
schools. Student fees — the state's
euphemism for tuition — is $2,824
at the nine UC campuses, a 24 per
cent increase over last year's bill.
Without the state subsidies, tu
ition, according to estimations by
the California Postsecondary Edu
cation Commission, would be about
$13,000. Similarly, even after a 40
percent increase over last year, Cal
State schools charge only $1,308;
without state funding, tuition
would rise to approximately $7300.
California residents can no
longer afford to foot the bill for fi
nancially privileged families.
Therefore, when a student sub
mits a financial aid application,
his/her aid package should be as
sembled based on her ability to pay
tuition fees free of subsidies.
If this is not done, California
schools will fall apart at the seams.
Already the stitching is showing.
Tuition was hiked significantly, as
the system found no other way to
maintain the low fees California
residents have come to expect.

More significantly, students re
turned to schools all over the state
to discover their academic depart
ments either partially or com
pletely dismantled.
California's state school system
can no longer consider itself the
bastion of the free-school-for-all
motto which Andrew Jackson em
blazoned upon the moral fabric of
this country.
Post secondary education is no
longer free nor affordable. And
unless California wants its col
leges — some of which are among
the top in the country — to go the
route of its elementary and sec
ondary public schools, it must act
swiftly and pragmatically.
Whereas University President
Gerhard Casper suggested during a
speech last year the possibility of
demolishing financial aid entirely
to decrease tuition, California
must do the opposite if it hopes to
continue to attract the best stu
dents — both rich and poor — to its
schools.
Besides rectifying an unfair situ
ation for the taxpayer and the state,
a more meaningful distribution of
subsidies would remove artificial
barriers from student's choices.
Four years without guaranteed
housing may not seem too appeal
ing compared to four years at Roble
or Toyon, but at more than a
$35,000 savings, a studio near Peo
ple's Park doesn't seem too bad.
Instead, students would be
forced to choose a college based on
their educational needs, not where
they can get the best deal. Mean
while, schools like UC-Berkeley
will be able to once again put
money where it is badly needed —
into housing and decreased class
size — instead of giving handouts
to those who don't really need it.
In the end, the UC and state
schools will be forced to take this
road. Let's hope they do it before
they become nothing more than an
enormous, bureaucratic version of
many of the state schools in this
country: large, broken-down and
dying.
