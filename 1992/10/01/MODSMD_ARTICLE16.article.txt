Women's center goals need assessment

AS DIRECTOR OF A MAJOR universi
ty women's center in one of the most po
litically progressive areas of the country,
Rebecca Bliss has a responsibility to
avoid stereotyping and factionalizing be
cause they are inherently undermining
to the community.
Her comments in Tuesday's Daily un
fortunately reveal a failure to realize
this responsibility.
By depicting women's centers as
"fringe" organizations associated with
"militant women with hairy legs," Bliss

destructively alienates some women
while trying to appeal to others.
Furthermore, in mocking some
women for their appearance and/or poli
tics, Bliss establishes an exclusionary
stance detrimental to coalition-building
and social change. She also seems to
forget how long feminists have worked
for recognition of their beliefs as more
substantive than their physical fea
tures.
Interviewer Angie Chuang also suc
cumbs to this subtle prejudice, aligning

Bliss* "not very radical" politics with her
haircut. How often does a political com
mentary include the cut or color of a
man's suit?
As for Bliss' "vow" to cany the
Women's Center into that morass some
call the "main stream," I hope she real
izes that women would not be where
they are today if it were not for the pio
neering "radicals."
