## Rev. Floyd Thompkins Spirituality is the key to growth 
### 
tter. Floyd Thompkins is
an Assoc. Dean of Memo
rial Church.
There are a
group of Stanford
University staff
members who often go
overlooked by the campus
community, despite the

fact that they render an important service
to our entire community.
Campus ministers and chaplains, by
their very presence, offer a tremendous
opportunity. Through their services, stu
dents are able to explore a variety of reli
gious ideologies on a personal as well as
academic level.
These campus ministries comprise at
least six religious traditions and multiple
shades of the Christian faith. Together
their activities attract thousands of stu
dents to weekly services — the Catholic
ministry alone provides services for over
900 patrons.
The ministries, however, represent
more than a chance to participate in an
other activity; they offer a chance to re
flect upon the meaning and purpose of
education and knowledge itself. They un
abashedly deal with spirituality.
Confession: I am an Assoc. Dean of
Memorial Church, and am therefore bi
ased towards the campus' religious pro

gram. However, it would be a shame if
someone attended Stanford and did not
take time to explore — in more than an
academic manner — the practice and dis
cipline of religion.
But more should be asked of you —
risk talking seriously about your friends'
confession of faith. Religion may be much
more than a passing interest for them.
Indeed, it may even be pivotal, not to
mention defining.
Of course you may disagree with me
on this point. Some religious communi
ties propagate racism, sexism, homopho
bia and parochialism. But as odd as it
sounds, these same faiths strive to ofTer
hope and healing for the victims of these
practices.
They police their own activities, seek
ing to eradicate institutional vestiges of
their harmful legacies. Whether religious
or spiritual communities are helpful or
harmful, they continue to be an undeni
able fact of life. We cannot and should not
avoid them, even if we disagree with
them fundamentally.
For those who happen to be practition
ers of particular faiths, I hold out a dif
ferent hope. Take advantage of an oppor
tunity to listen to another's faith confes
sion. Too often, we believers who are
grounded in one faith are indifferent or
downright insulting to others whose be

liefs are equally important but different.
Nothing is as unattractive as a person
whose personal relationship with God
renders him close-minded and mean-tem
pered toward other religious walks. In
every faith, love is the mark of authentic
ity.
Respecting a peer's faith does not
imply a compromise in personal beliefs. I
remember many of last year's Friday -
night conversations with Muslim stu
dents with great fondness.
They lovingly tried to convert this
"heathen" of a dean to Islam. And of
course I attempted, oh so subtly, to pre
sent to them the wisdom of Christianity.
We may not have accomplished our aims,
but we certainly learned a great deal
about one another's passions and preju
dices.
It is my prayer and hope that this uni
versity will promote both breadth in
knowledge and depth in character. The
chaplains and your fellow students are an
excellent, resource for such explorations.
Perhaps the transformation of the mind
requires an examination of the spirit.
We are blessed to have a vibrant and
strong array of spiritual communities.
They are an integral part of any healthy
educational environment. I hope that you
will overlook my prejudices as well as
your own and check them out.
