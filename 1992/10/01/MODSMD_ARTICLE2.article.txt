Stanford Stadium will receive at least $3.5 mil
lion in renovations in preparation to host the 1994
Soccer World Cup, organizers announced yester
day.
"Since we know that significant money will be
spent on this stadium, we are much more confi
dent and are sure things in this stadium will meet
the requirements for the World Cup," said Guido
Tognoni, public relations head for FIFA, interna
tional soccer's ruling body. "It is important for
Northern California to have World Cup soccer . . .
and we are pleased to be working with this group."
Stanford Stadium was selected last year as one
of nine stadiums to host the 1994 World Cup. The
stadium will be the site of six games in June,
including a coveted quarterfinal match. All of the
games are expected to sell out.
The World Cup rivals the Olympics as the
world's most popular athletic event, and July's
final, to be played in the Rose Bowl, is expected to
attract a worldwide television audience of more
than 1.5 billion viewers.
The improvements to Stanford Stadium will
include significant reconstruction of the press box
and the replacement of many of the wooden
bleachers with aluminum seating. The total cost
could reach $4 million.
