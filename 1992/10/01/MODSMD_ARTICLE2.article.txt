## $3.5 M stadium repairs 
### Brian Brennan Howard Libit 
Stanford Stadium will receive at least $3.5 mil
lion in renovations in preparation to host the 1994
Soccer World Cup, organizers announced yester
day.
"Since we know that significant money will be
spent on this stadium, we are much more confi
dent and are sure things in this stadium will meet
the requirements for the World Cup," said Guido
Tognoni, public relations head for FIFA, interna
tional soccer's ruling body. "It is important for
Northern California to have World Cup soccer . . .
and we are pleased to be working with this group."
Stanford Stadium was selected last year as one
of nine stadiums to host the 1994 World Cup. The
stadium will be the site of six games in June,
including a coveted quarterfinal match. All of the
games are expected to sell out.
The World Cup rivals the Olympics as the
world's most popular athletic event, and July's
final, to be played in the Rose Bowl, is expected to
attract a worldwide television audience of more
than 1.5 billion viewers.
The improvements to Stanford Stadium will
include significant reconstruction of the press box
and the replacement of many of the wooden
bleachers with aluminum seating. The total cost
could reach $4 million.
While the stadium renovations will remain after
the World Cup is over, soccer offi
cials promised during the afternoon
press conference that improve
ments will not cost Stanford any
extra money.
All University earnings from the
matches are designated to pay for
the costs of the renovations, and an
additional $500,000 will be paid by
the independent area host commit
tee, said Peter Bridgwater, execu
tive director of the local group.

If additional money is needed, it
will be paid for by the World Cup
national host committee in Los
Angeles.
"We try to upgrade the infras
tructure of every stadium we use,"
Tognoni said.
There is no completion date for
the renovations, but it is likely
many of the improvements will be
finished before next fall's football
season, according to Dave Sim
mons, acting head of venues for the
national federation.
The local committee is studying
different ways of modifying the
press box, and a final construction

plan is expected within a month,
Simmons said.
The international soccer officials
were at Stanford on the second stop
of a nine-day, nine-stadium tour of
the 1994 World Cup facilities.
Included in the 26-member dele
gation were representatives from
the European and American televi
sion networks.
"What is happening now are
technical inspections and a deter
mination of the alterations that
need to be carried out" to accom
modate the media and make "the
best available hospitality areas,"
Bridgwater said.
