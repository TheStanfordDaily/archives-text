## Barry Katz Through scientific research, humanity attempts to define itself

In an extraordinary essay of 1916, the
Hungarian critic Georg Luk&cs proposed
a distinction between civilizations that
are "integrated" and those he called
"problematic."
In the "integrated" civilization, a tran
scendent fabric of meaning envelops
every zone of existence. In the "problem
atic," the totality of existence has been
shattered, and each sphere of activity
develops independently and according to
its own logic: politics, religion, business,
art, morality.
I have always been captivated by
Luk£cs' "transcendental topography of
the mind." Nor am I alone, for this quest
for a principle that carries us beyond the
mundane details of everyday life has been
a most persistent theme in modern
thought.

For Marx, it was the vision of a society
beyond alienation — between public and
private, work and play, politics and cul
ture; Max Weber spoke with bitter resig
nation of the "disenchantment of the
world;" and Freud, in one of his most
enduring images, described with a certain
forced detachment an "oceanic feeling" of
immediate connectedness to the uni
verse. As a man of science, however,
Freud was unable to locate that feeling
within himself.
This is not surprising, for our own civ
ilization — perhaps, more than any that
has preceded it — is hostile to the very
idea of transcendence. Indeed, what has
been the achievement of western science
if not to demonstrate that the universe is
ultimately and essentially meaningless?
This is an intolerable thought for most

people, and we recoil from it emotionally
even as we accept it as rational fact. As a
civilization, we have turned to an unlike
ly place in our need to fill this cultural
and spiritual void: technology and sci
ence.
It is here that we find our gods and
our heroes. It is here that we search for
redemption and salvation, for a glimpse
of the infinite, for the key to immortali
ty. Three initiatives are emblematic of
this desperate auest for meaning in a
world grown cold, and they will repay
our scrutiny as we approach the millen
nium:
Last week Congress authorized $2.1
billion toward the development of the
space station Freedom, a modest install
ment in a program that NASA estimates
will cost another $40 billion to build and

$100 billion to operate during its expect
ed 30-year lifespan.
Advocates hold out the promise of
manufacturing perfect ball-bearings in
zero-gravity conditions, but Ohio is
cheaper, notes my friend Jim Adams,
"and you can use UPS."
The real lure of the Space Station is
better explained by the authors of the
Hebrew Bible: "Come, let us build a
Tower, with its top in Heaven, that we
may make a name for ourselves."
Earlier this summer the House and
Senate split over the $8.3 billion super
conducting supercollider to be built in
Waxahachie, Texas. Critics ask why we
should pay vast sums to find out what
happened in the first trillionth of a sec
ond while our cities rot in the lived pre
sent. But they miss the point. If the space

station is to help us peer into the infinite,
the supercollider will enable us to re
experience the beginning of time.
Finally, there is the famous Human
Genome initiative, which, despite its
comparatively modest $3 billion coat,
promises to be the most far-reaching in
its consequences. Researchers have
already identified the gene for cystic
fibrosis and other hereditary diseases,
but again, the meaning of the Genome
project lies in a higher realm: through it
we secretly hope to know our destiny.
It is the paradox of American civiliza
tion that science and technology have
stepped forward to fill the spiritual void
engendered by science and technology.
