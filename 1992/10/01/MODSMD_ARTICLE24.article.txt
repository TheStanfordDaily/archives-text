## Cardinal cruises to huge 7-0 romp 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Sometimes the game is closer
than the score indicates. But then
again, sometimes it's not.
Yesterday, the Stanford
women's soccer team held a 2-0
lead over Cal State-Hayward at
halftime. However, the number of
shots on goal offered a better
gauge of the match. At that point,
the Cardinal had tallied 24 shots,
while the Pioneers couldn't
muster any.
Stanford exploded for five
more goals in the second half to
nail down the victory.
Coach Berhane Andeberhan
praised his athletes for keeping
their intensity up throughout the
lopsided contest.
Last year the Stanford-Hay
ward scrimmage was just as easy
in the first half, he said.

'We got a lot of people
in who haven't played
a lot and there was no
drop in quality. I'm
very pleased about
that.'

Andeberhan

"In the first ten minutes we
went ahead 2-0. And the game
ended 2-2. Now if we win 2-0 or by
four or five goals, that's fine. But
if you give up two goals, that's
something different."
But this time the defense held
strong throughout the game. And
the big Cardinal lead enabled
Andeberhan to clear the bench
and get all 24 players into the
action.
"We got a lot of people in who
haven't played a lot and there was
no drop in quality," he said. "I'm
very pleased about that."
One difference between this
and any other Stanford shutout is
that the head coaches facing each
other also live together. Julie
Andeberhan, Berhane's wife, is in
her second year of coaching the
Pioneers.
"It's good for some jokes but
once the game starts, I don't even
remember," she said of facing her
husband on the field. "People ask
us if we draw a line down the mid
dle of our house, down the middle
of the bed. But no, we don't. I left
this morning and said, 'See you
tonight,' and he said, 'No, wait.
The game."'

Berhane Andeberhan was just
as casual about the unusual
matchup.
"Once we get here it's just a
team wearing another color," he
said. "I've played against cousins
and I've even played against my
father. It's not that different."
Another person facing a well
known opponent was former
Stanford star Heather Mclntyre,
who is now the Pioneer assistant
coach.
"It's hard just because it's my
team one year removed," she said.
"I was really excited just for the
Hayward girls to play against
them. I think I was more excited
than they were. I was psyching
them up and they were looking at
me like I was a weirdo."
Julie Andeberhan also antici
pated the Cardinal match and
said that her familiarity with the
Stanford program gave her an
edge in preparing a game strate
gy-
"l think I know more about
how his team plays," she said.
"I've been a fan and I watch the
games and we live on this side of
the Bay, so I tend to see more of
the games.
"Although he doesn't see our
games, he knows a lot about the
team because we talk about it.
But once you get on the field, the
coaches don't matter. It's what
the players have learned in prac
tice and what they do on the
field."
What became clear early on
was that Hayward couldn't do
much to stop the Cardinal. Fresh
man Dena Dey opened the scoring
25 minutes into the match. Tak
ing a pass from Julie Foudy, Dey
shot across the goal and scored
when the ball hit the far upright
and ricocheted into the goal.
Junior Jen Gardiner then tal
lied a goal on a close-range shot
from the right side. The score was
her first of the year, as she has
been recovering from knee and
shin problems.
"The swelling is down and [my
legs] feel good," Gardiner said.
"I've been playing a bit every
game, so once I give my feet time
to adjust, I'll be fine."
Gardiner and the rest of the
Cardinal midfielders controlled
play throughout the game, forc
ing many Pioneer turnovers and
finding open teammates.
"We've been working on the
transition game a lot," Gardiner
said. "Our positioning at midfield
has been better, so it's making the
transition faster."
Meanwhile, Hayward was try
ing to minimize the potent Stan
ford attack.
"On paper, player for player,

we knew we were outmatched,"
Julie Andeberhan said. "Basically,
we played low pressure — get peo
ple to slow down the forward
progress of the ball. Then every
one else packed in. We were ready
to play a lot of defense on our end
and then when we came up with it,
looked to counterattack quickly."
The quick punch never materi
alized as the Cardinal defense
defused any potential scoring
opportunity. And then the offense
took over.
As has been the case this sea
son, Stanford's attack kicked into
high gear in the second half.
Foudy tallied two and Dey added a
long-range goal in a two-minute

span. Sarah Rafanelli added her
sixth score of the year and fresh
man Sarah Wolcher rounded out
the scoring.
After the game, Julie Andeber
han was relatively upbeat about
her squad's loss.
"When you're an athlete, its not
easy to lose 7-0," she said. "What
happened is we battled every
minute. They're a great team and
they deserved to win 7-0,
"What I told them before the
game was, 'How often do you get a
chance to play a team like this —
with so many national and region
al team players? The true athletes
will rise to the occasion and have
fun with it."

in the first half, he said.

'We got a lot of people
in who haven't played
a lot and there was no
drop in quality. I'm
very pleased about
that.'
— Berhane
Andeberhan

"In the first ten minutes we
went ahead 2-0. And the game
ended 2-2. Now if we win 2-0 or by
four or five goals, that's fine. But
if you give up two goals, that's
something different."
But this time the defense held
strong throughout the game. And
the big Cardinal lead enabled
Andeberhan to clear the bench
and get all 24 players into the
action.
"We got a lot of people in who
haven't played a lot and there was
no drop in quality," he said. "I'm
very pleased about that."
One difference between this
and any other Stanford shutout is
that the head coaches facing each
other also live together. Julie
Andeberhan, Berhane's wife, is in
her second year of coaching the
Pioneers.
"It's good for some jokes but
once the game starts, I don't even
remember," she said of facing her
husband on the field. "People ask
us if we draw a line down the mid
dle of our house, down the middle
of the bed. But no, we don't. I left
this morning and said, 'See you
tonight,' and he said, 'No, wait.
The game."'

Berhane Andeberhan was just
as casual about the unusual
matchup.
"Once we get here it's just a
team wearing another color," he
said. "I've played against cousins
and I've even played against my
father. It's not that different."
Another person facing a well
known opponent was former
Stanford star Heather Mclntyre,
who is now the Pioneer assistant
coach.
"It's hard just because it's my
team one year removed," she said.
"I was really excited just for the
Hayward girls to play against
them. I think I was more excited
than they were. I was psyching
them up and they were looking at
me like I was a weirdo."
Julie Andeberhan also antici
pated the Cardinal match and
said that her familiarity with the
Stanford program gave her an
edge in preparing a game strate
gy-
"l think I know more about
how his team plays," she said.
"I've been a fan and I watch the
games and we live on this side of
the Bay, so I tend to see more of
the games.
"Although he doesn't see our
games, he knows a lot about the
team because we talk about it.
But once you get on the field, the
coaches don't matter. It's what
the players have learned in prac
tice and what they do on the
field."
What became clear early on
was that Hayward couldn't do
much to stop the Cardinal. Fresh
man Dena Dey opened the scoring
25 minutes into the match. Tak
ing a pass from Julie Foudy, Dey
shot across the goal and scored
when the ball hit the far upright
and ricocheted into the goal.
Junior Jen Gardiner then tal
lied a goal on a close-range shot
from the right side. The score was
her first of the year, as she has
been recovering from knee and
shin problems.
"The swelling is down and [my
legs] feel good," Gardiner said.
"I've been playing a bit every
game, so once I give my feet time
to adjust, I'll be fine."
Gardiner and the rest of the
Cardinal midfielders controlled
play throughout the game, forc
ing many Pioneer turnovers and
finding open teammates.
"We've been working on the
transition game a lot," Gardiner
said. "Our positioning at midfield
has been better, so it's making the
transition faster."
Meanwhile, Hayward was try
ing to minimize the potent Stan
ford attack.
"On paper, player for player,

we knew we were outmatched,"
Julie Andeberhan said. "Basically,
we played low pressure — get peo
ple to slow down the forward
progress of the ball. Then every
one else packed in. We were ready
to play a lot of defense on our end
and then when we came up with it,
looked to counterattack quickly."
The quick punch never materi
alized as the Cardinal defense
defused any potential scoring
opportunity. And then the offense
took over.
As has been the case this sea
son, Stanford's attack kicked into
high gear in the second half.
Foudy tallied two and Dey added a
long-range goal in a two-minute

span. Sarah Rafanelli added her
sixth score of the year and fresh
man Sarah Wolcher rounded out
the scoring.
After the game, Julie Andeber
han was relatively upbeat about
her squad's loss.
"When you're an athlete, its not
easy to lose 7-0," she said. "What
happened is we battled every
minute. They're a great team and
they deserved to win 7-0,
"What I told them before the
game was, 'How often do you get a
chance to play a team like this —
with so many national and region
al team players? The true athletes
will rise to the occasion and have
fun with it."
