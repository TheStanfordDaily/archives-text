# Student-athletes: a September myth
## 
### 
Ah, the beginning of the school
year. The weather is nice, and the
workload is light. It's fall, the sea
son for football. Normally, it is
the time for optimism, but there
is already reason to complain.
Wouldn't it be great to be able to
start the year off with a leisurely
jaunt to Stanford Stadium to
catch the mighty Cardinal and
new head coach Bill Walsh?
Nice idea, but we, the stu
dents/sports fans of Stanford, will
have to wait. And wait. And
wait. . .three long weeks until the
first home game of the school
year. Just when the opportunity
might exist to find that one ounce
of school spirit in that friend who
studies too much and get them to
go out and cheer for the cardinal
and white, the books will again
get the nod because there is no
game to attend. By the time Ari
zona comes to the Farm on Oct.
17, the student body will be prep
ping for midterms, and the season
will be more than half over.
This year, with the first day of
classes barely squeaked into the
month of September, a new epoch
for tardiness in starting the
autumn quarter has begun. We
might as well just cut to the chase
— watch Big Game, eat our
Thanksgiving turkey, and go
home for winter break. Who
designed this thing? While virtu
ally every other school in the
country has been in session for
over a month, the Cardinal grid
ders had the "good" fortune of
playing three home games with
out any students in the student
section (But they did have the
support of the alumni section,
whose elegant wine-and-cheese
tailgaters have been known to
intimidate the opposition and cre
ate deafening noise to rattle
opposing quarterbacks.).
Recently, the Athletics Depart
ment wisely decided that students
would no longer be charged to
attend sporting events other than
football. The underlying theory
behind this decision was that the
substantial revenue garnered
from football will more than
make up for the few token dollars
students pay to watch non-mar
quee sports.
It doesn't take a Stanford
economist, however, to figure out
that you can't get money from
students for football games when
the students aren't in school!
Sure, $60-75,000 in lost earnings
might seem like a drop in the
bucket when compared to the
amount of money that Stanford
owes the government, but what
truly has been been lost is stu
dents' opportunity to enjoy and
cheer on their team. This year's

schedule, therefore, has failed on
two counts: 1) It didn't fill up the
sunny side of the stadium to give
the team encouragement and a
true home field advantage; and 2)
The athletic department lost
potential earnings as a result.

So how's this for an idea? Start
school earlier. Sure, people have
many gripes about the quarter
system, but there are valid athlet
ic reasons to start earlier, and to
switch to semesters. Stanford has
always prided itself on having stu
dent-athletes. Therefore, let's
stop separating the athletes so
much from the other students
during the summer period. The
football, water polo, women's vol
leyball, men's and women's soccer
teams and others have been prac
ticing for a month— and playing
games. The players would proba
bly appreciate the extra support
from their peers in the stands.
Both the men's and women's
basketball teams are twice bitten
by the quarter system. Not only
do the players need to take finals
one month into their season in
December, but they are faced
with finals again right smack at
the beginning of the NCAA Tour
nament, not to mention midterms
during the league season.
Ending in mid-May would not
harm the sports-spectating stu
dents either. By then, the base
ball team and both tennis teams
have completed the playoffs or
they are still participating in post
season competition on the road.
Sports-starved students then
shift their attention to the NBA
playoffs on television, and subse
quently must suffer with the
unfair choice of watching Michael
Jordan or studying for finals dur
ing June.
Sophomore flanker Justin
Armour aptly put it when he said,
"It's crazy, the school year we
have." Crazy indeed. Switching
the academic calendar would be
better for both the athletes and
the fans. The athletes would have
less exams to worry about during
their seasons, and the students
would likewise benefit and be able
to attend more events.

Ah, the beginning of the school
year. The weather is nice, and the
workload is light. It's fall, the sea
son for football. Normally, it is
the time for optimism, but there
is already reason to complain.
Wouldn't it be great to be able to
start the year off with a leisurely
jaunt to Stanford Stadium to
catch the mighty Cardinal and
new head coach Bill Walsh?
Nice idea, but we, the stu
dents/sports fans of Stanford, will
have to wait. And wait. And
wait. . .three long weeks until the
first home game of the school
year. Just when the opportunity
might exist to find that one ounce
of school spirit in that friend who
studies too much and get them to
go out and cheer for the cardinal
and white, the books will again
get the nod because there is no
game to attend. By the time Ari
zona comes to the Farm on Oct.
17, the student body will be prep
ping for midterms, and the season
will be more than half over.
This year, with the first day of
classes barely squeaked into the
month of September, a new epoch
for tardiness in starting the
autumn quarter has begun. We
might as well just cut to the chase
— watch Big Game, eat our
Thanksgiving turkey, and go
home for winter break. Who
designed this thing? While virtu
ally every other school in the
country has been in session for
over a month, the Cardinal grid
ders had the "good" fortune of
playing three home games with
out any students in the student
section (But they did have the
support of the alumni section,
whose elegant wine-and-cheese
tailgaters have been known to
intimidate the opposition and cre
ate deafening noise to rattle
opposing quarterbacks.).
Recently, the Athletics Depart
ment wisely decided that students
would no longer be charged to
attend sporting events other than
football. The underlying theory
behind this decision was that the
substantial revenue garnered
from football will more than
make up for the few token dollars
students pay to watch non-mar
quee sports.
It doesn't take a Stanford
economist, however, to figure out
that you can't get money from
students for football games when
the students aren't in school!
Sure, $60-75,000 in lost earnings
might seem like a drop in the
bucket when compared to the
amount of money that Stanford
owes the government, but what
truly has been been lost is stu
dents' opportunity to enjoy and
cheer on their team. This year's

schedule, therefore, has failed on
two counts: 1) It didn't fill up the
sunny side of the stadium to give
the team encouragement and a
true home field advantage; and 2)
The athletic department lost
potential earnings as a result.

So how's this for an idea? Start
school earlier. Sure, people have
many gripes about the quarter
system, but there are valid athlet
ic reasons to start earlier, and to
switch to semesters. Stanford has
always prided itself on having stu
dent-athletes. Therefore, let's
stop separating the athletes so
much from the other students
during the summer period. The
football, water polo, women's vol
leyball, men's and women's soccer
teams and others have been prac
ticing for a month— and playing
games. The players would proba
bly appreciate the extra support
from their peers in the stands.
Both the men's and women's
basketball teams are twice bitten
by the quarter system. Not only
do the players need to take finals
one month into their season in
December, but they are faced
with finals again right smack at
the beginning of the NCAA Tour
nament, not to mention midterms
during the league season.
Ending in mid-May would not
harm the sports-spectating stu
dents either. By then, the base
ball team and both tennis teams
have completed the playoffs or
they are still participating in post
season competition on the road.
