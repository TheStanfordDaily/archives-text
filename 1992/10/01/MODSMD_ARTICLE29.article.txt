## MOVIES Hawkeye goes Hollywood: Heroic Mohicans hits big 
### Kimberly Chrisman 
Action-adventure meets Americana in
"The Last of the Mohicans," a revisionist ro
mance loosely based upon the James Fenimore
Cooper novel you never actually read in high
school.
As Hawkeye, Daniel Day-Lewis gives the
term "AmStud" a whole new meaning. Coop
er's garrulous hero, Natty Bumppo, has a bet
ter body and a hipper name — Nathaniel Poe
— onscreen, along with a steamy love interest.
You can't argue with progress.
It is 1757, the third year of war between
England, France and their various Native
American allies for control of the colonies.
Hawkeye, a white frontiersman raised by a
Mohican chief, is en route to peaceful "Ken
tuck-ee" when he's recruited to escort two
beautiful daughters of a British colonel to Fort
William Henry.
Finding the fort under French fire, Hawk
eye risks his life to help the colonial militia es
cape, but he remains behind. "I got a reason to
stay," he grunts, his intense, flinty gaze fixed
on the oldest daughter, Cora.
Their ensuing romance is as poetic as it is

improbable, given the
various military and cul
tural conflicts they face.
Not only is Cora practi
cally engaged to a prig of
a British major, but she
is the target of repeated
ambushes by a tribe of
avenging Hurons, all de
picted in exquisite his
torical detail.
Accurate as it may be,
however, "Mohicans" is
no history lesson.
"Miami Vice" creator

Michael Mann infuses the film with plenty of
good old-fashioned violence, without the ben
efit of sawed-off shotguns or semi-automatics.
What might have been a stodgy costume
drama is a thrilling study in perfectly choreo
graphed chaos. Mann doesn't skimp on the

scalping, nor does he cut
away from a gruesome im
molation scene. Under his
direction, a canoe ride
through roaring rapids is
every bit as exciting as a
"Vice" cigarette-boat
chase.
Wolf Kroeger and
Dante Spinotti are respon
sible for the film's spectac
ular production design and
photography. Filmed in
North Carolina, the action
is set among scenery
straight out of a Bierstadt
landscape. The battle of
Fort William Henry — an
imposing structure until it
is blown to toothpicks—is
only one of several lavishly
shot sequences.
"Dances With Wolves"
costumer Elsa Zamparelli

Oscar-nominated achieve

herself. A picture-perfect
supporting cast and a

Jones and Randy Edelmen

narrative conventions of the novel. The

screenplay, by Mann and
Christopher Crowe, alter
nates between stilted Colo
nialspeak and such awkward
colloquialisms as, "You've got
yourself a militia, General."
Parts of the film are confus
ing despite labored exposi
tion, and the whole thing is
littered with preachy civil
rights speeches and all-too
poignant allusions to the
coming revolution.
Despite the unflinching
gore, "Mohicans" operates

on a decidedly PC agenda borrowed from
"Dances With Wolves." Every crime is justi
fied, every criminal redeemed. Hawkeye even
apologizes to a deer he has just slaughtered.
But "Mohicans" actually owes more to
"Robin Hood" than to "Wolves," plotwise. It's

a moody, melodramatic rendition of the boy
saves-girl-and-country formula, with
Madeleine Stowe a poor substitute for Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio in the role of Feisty
Heroine.
Doe-eyed and pale, Stowe looks the part
but can't muster enough pluck to plausibly
keep a sensible guy like Hawkeye interested.
Considering that she's apparently one of two
women on the frontier, however, the Hawk
ster's momentary lapse of judgment is quite
defensible.
And considering the merits of "Mohicans,"
its minor flaws are equally excusable. Mann's
vision and Day-Lewis's bravura performance
turn history into something truly memorable.

Action-adventure meets Americana in
"The Last of the Mohicans," a revisionist ro
mance loosely based upon the James Fenimore
Cooper novel you never actually read in high
school.
As Hawkeye, Daniel Day-Lewis gives the
term "AmStud" a whole new meaning. Coop
er's garrulous hero, Natty Bumppo, has a bet
ter body and a hipper name — Nathaniel Poe
— onscreen, along with a steamy love interest.
You can't argue with progress.
It is 1757, the third year of war between
England, France and their various Native
American allies for control of the colonies.
Hawkeye, a white frontiersman raised by a
Mohican chief, is en route to peaceful "Ken
tuck-ee" when he's recruited to escort two
beautiful daughters of a British colonel to Fort
William Henry.
Finding the fort under French fire, Hawk
eye risks his life to help the colonial militia es
cape, but he remains behind. "I got a reason to
stay," he grunts, his intense, flinty gaze fixed
on the oldest daughter, Cora.
Their ensuing romance is as poetic as it is

improbable, given the
various military and cul
tural conflicts they face.
Not only is Cora practi
cally engaged to a prig of
a British major, but she
is the target of repeated
ambushes by a tribe of
avenging Hurons, all de
picted in exquisite his
torical detail.
Accurate as it may be,
however, "Mohicans" is
no history lesson.
"Miami Vice" creator

Michael Mann infuses the film with plenty of
good old-fashioned violence, without the ben
efit of sawed-off shotguns or semi-automatics.
What might have been a stodgy costume
drama is a thrilling study in perfectly choreo
graphed chaos. Mann doesn't skimp on the

scalping, nor does he cut
away from a gruesome im
molation scene. Under his
direction, a canoe ride
through roaring rapids is
every bit as exciting as a
"Vice" cigarette-boat
chase.
Wolf Kroeger and
Dante Spinotti are respon
sible for the film's spectac
ular production design and
photography. Filmed in
North Carolina, the action
is set among scenery
straight out of a Bierstadt
landscape. The battle of
Fort William Henry — an
imposing structure until it
is blown to toothpicks—is
only one of several lavishly
shot sequences.
