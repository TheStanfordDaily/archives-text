Students who think they registered to vote in
White Plaza Tuesday could be in for a surprise when
they go to the polls, according to Office of Student
Affairs Program Coordinator Heather Dunn.
A couple who set up a voter registration table
near Dinkelspiel Auditorium two days ago was not
giving out receipts as required by law, Dunn said.
Voters can use the receipts to ensure that the
forms have been sent in. The man and woman run
ning the table were also soliciting money, Dunn said.
Soliciting money on the Stanford campus with
out permission is a violation of University policy.
Dunn said that she asked them to leave campus,
but added she is "concerned students may think they
are registered when they are not." Dunn suggested
that anyone who filled out a form at the table register
again. Monday is the deadline for the Nov. 3 election
Dunn said the couple did not identify them
selves as being affiliated with a particular party.
But she cautioned students to fill out the party
affiliation section of the registration themselves,
since some "shady characters" have been known to
alter that portion after students submit the forms.
Students should also make sure they put down
a residence address, since a post office box is not
acceptable, she added.
