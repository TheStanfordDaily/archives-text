# Song and dance in solemn struggle: Sarafina shines
## 
### Tammie Edwards 
"Sarafina," a powerful film adaptation of
the award-winning piece of musical theater,
raises the contentious issue of violent versus
passive resistance to imperialism.
Directed by Darrell Jacob Roodt in a style
reminiscent of "West Side Story," the film
sets out to chronicle the resistance of black
South African school children to the 1976 de
cree that Afrikaans should be the language of
instruction.
The youths defiantly firebombed their
government school, an action followed first
by the intense scrutiny and later the tortuous
wrath of the South African police. Several
hundreds of South African students were
killed.
Whoopi Goldberg headlines as the radical
schoolteacher, Mary Masembuko, who teach
es history with a twist. She cleverly defies the
prescribed government syllabus, highlighting
discrepancies between the white and black
versions of the story. "Isn't history beautiful?"
she then asks her class rhetorically.
Goldberg scores big in this endeavor,

showing that not only Meryl Streep can con
quer an accent and consume a role. She is on
screen for a relatively short period of time,
but her performance is memorable and lumi
nous. The role further solidifies her versatili
ty, reminding audiences that Goldberg can
tackle the serious as well as the comic.
Goldberg's performance is top-notch, but
the real star is newcomer Leleti Khumalo in
the title role of Sarafina. With vibrancy and
warmth Khumalo endears herself immedi
ately. One feels personally attacked as this
bright, energetic spirit has her childish en
thusiasm and revolutionary dreams beaten
down.
"Sarafina" is to be commended for the
complexity of issues it raises. The film is not
a one-dimensional production with all blacks
pictured as saints and whites as evil nemeses.
The strange dilemma of black-on-black vio
lence is handled well, leaving the audience to
draw their own conclusions.
Conflicts between the zealous youth and
the more complacent adults raise the ques
tions of what defines revolution — passive or
active resistance — and which is more effec
tive.
Young Sarafina must learn the meaning of
violent protest before she can understand
that her mother's acceptance of life as a ser
vant is not an act of cowardice but a mark of
heroism.
Roodt struggles admirably to make the
precarious leap between dramatic scenes and
song and dance sequences. There are scenes
that were obviously scripted and choreo
graphed for the stage which do not translate
well to the screen. Roodt manages for the
most part, nonetheless, to convey the energy
of the live performance.
But the cinematography is mediocre. Cuts
between musical and dramatic scenes are
sometimes awkward. The use of dissolve
within shots to focus on speaking characters
is sometimes distracting.
At the same time, Roodt avoids the trap of
heavy-handed, overly didactic directing, al
lowing the poignant, heart-wrenching mo
ments to subtly make their own powerful
points.
