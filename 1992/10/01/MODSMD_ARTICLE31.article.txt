# Ferocious femme on feeding frenzy: Emergency alert
## REVIEWS 
### Victor Haseman 
Far beneath a canopy of numbing vio
lence and dark, callous humor, lies the un
likely story of a criminal-stalking vampire, a
lonely undercover cop and an unstable
Mafia don.
"Innocent Blood," directed by John Lan
dis ("Animal House") is a cross-genre romp
through the chilly streets of Pittsburgh,
which transforms outlandish macabre into
common-place but effective wit.
A hungry vampire named Marie (Anne
Parillaud) wanders into Pittsburgh, hoping
to feast upon the city's assortment of "worth
less" scoundrels. But an attempt upon Mafia
kingpin Sal Macelli (Robert Loggia) ends in
disaster when she is forced to eat and run.
Her failure to dispose properly of Macelli's
body after "feeding" gives him a new lease on
life — as a mob-vampire.
This fiasco is preceded by a fantastic bom
bardment of incidents — each more out
landish than the one before — until "Inno
cent Blood" comes to an insultingly anti-cli
matic close.
On the redeeming side, Parillaud, Loggia
and costar Anthony LaPaglia — Parillaud's
love interest — deliver sound performances,
as do the rest of the supporting cast. But the
film's saving grace is its ability to intermesh
conventional drollness with acts of violence
and mayhem usually reserved for stock hor
ror shows.
On this level, "Innocent Blood" invokes
the tone of "An American Werewolf in Lon
don" — an early Landis success — as well as
H. P. Lovecraft's "Re-Animator" and Monty
Python's "Holy Grail." Anything can be
funny when approached from the right angle

— even if it is in poor taste.
On another level, "Innocent Blood"
makes an admirable attempt to offer audi
ences a window into the soul of the vampire,
perhaps the most endearing popular icon of
fear and horror.
Parillaud as Marie is far from the blood
sucking seducer of helpless waifs made famous
by Vincent Price. The early dancing career that
made her perfect for "La Femme Nikita" works
equally well in "Innocent Blood."
She's the helpless waif that we've watched
Dracula sink his teeth into movie after
movie. But this time the same Crest smile and
innocent eyes that got girls like Marie into so
much trouble in the past put her in control.
Viewers are given the opportunity to de
cide for themselves whether or not the vam
pire is a villain or just an unwilling victim of
circumstance. However Landis does install a
few fail-safe elements to insure audience ap
proval of his heroine.
The film's alternation between Marie the
woman and Marie the vampire gets boring
very quickly. Nonetheless, "Innocent Blood"
isn't a bad way to spend an outing, or $6.75 for
that matter. It seems destined to be a cult clas
sic.
