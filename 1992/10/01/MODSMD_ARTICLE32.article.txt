# From New World to New World Order: History redefined
## 
### Tracy Schroeder 
Most Stanford students can readily recite
the sing-song sentence, "In 1492, Columbus
sailed the ocean blue." The names of the
Spaniard's three ships*— >he Nina, the Pinta
and the Santa Maria — are also permanently
ingrained in most students' minds.
The teaching of these facts most often

takes place during a presen
tation of Christopher Columbus as the brave
Spanish hero who "discovered" the "New
World." Schools rarely problematize Colum
bus' traditionally glorious persona.
Roger Guenveur Smith, creator of the mul
timedia live performance work "Christopher
Columbus: 1992," aims to disrupt the com
placency of many who have always unques
tioningly celebrated Columbus Day. The
world premier of the work will be presented
tonight through Oct. 10, at the Lorraine
Hansberry Theatre in San Francisco.
With an impressionistic collage — or
"collision" as Smith puts it — of music,
lights and drama, "Christopher Columbus:
1992" examines Columbus' actions and how
they determined the past, present and future
of the Western Hemisphere.
The legacy of Spanish colonialism,
Smith's work asserts, has been a history of vi
olent race relations and environmental
abuse. Native Americans were slaughtered

Schools rarely prob
lematize Columbus' tra
ditionally glorious
persona.

and tropical vegetation stripped away by Eu
ropean conquerors in search of gold, jewels
and territory.
Smith sees an abstract continuity in
American history which links Columbus'
"New World" to President George Bush's
"New World Order." As a result, "Christo
pher Columbus: 1992" is not a chronological,
point-by-point analysis of history. Rather, it
is a thematic collection more suited to the
elucidation of a common historical scenario.
Smith's text, while largely improvised, is
based on several 15th- and 16th-century
texts, as well as modern analyses and Smith's
own perspectives. Notes from Columbus'
journal and studies by both Columbus' son
and Spanish scholar Bartolomd de las Casas
arc among the historical elements. The novel
"Conquest of Paradise" by Kirkpatrick Sale
and the commentary of artist Bob Marley
contribute modern perspectives.
Sound designer Marc Anthony Thompson
coordinates the soundtrack live on stage.
Thompson is a highly skilled musician who
has put out two albums of his own. Acoustic
sounds such as percussion and wind instru
ments are combined with samples of record
ed music and sound effects to create an eclec
tic soundtrack.
Smith is a veteran of both theater and
film. He has performed on stages from the
New York Shakespeare Festival to the Mark
Taper Forum in Los Angeles. He has also
produced his own creations, such as the
multimedia work "Frederick Douglass
Now" which enjoyed success in the Bay
Area last year.
Featured in several of Spike Lee's films —
"Do the Right Thing," "School Daze" and
soon-to-be-released "Malcolm X" — Smith
is also known to television viewers as Profes
sor Randolph on NBC's "A Different
World."
Following its run at the Lorraine Hans
berry Theatre, "Christopher Columbus:
1992" will open on Columbus Day in New
York at the One Dream Theater. The pro
duction will also be presented at the Mark
Taper Forum in Los Angeles and on a na
tional collegiate tour.
