TOAD
the wet sprocket
doesn't aim to deliver
a sermon

the Wet Sprocket
began recording
"Fear" the day the
United States
declared war on
Iraq and finished
on the day of the
cease-fire.

"It makes your
thoughts shrink to a
pinpoint It's a hum
bling experience,"
he says gravely.

"We were looking forward to that
moment — it was our first time in a live stu
dio," bassist Dean Dinning explains, pas
sionately sharing the band's baptism into the
big time music scene. But the sight of bombs
falling on television reduced the initial
excitement for the group, he recalls.

"There are a lot more important things in life."
The ballad "I Will Not take These Things
For Granted" — in which lead singer Glen
Phillips croons "flowers in the garden/laugh
ter in the hall/children in the park/I will not
take these things for granted" — took on a
new meaning for Toad as a result.
espite their
in political and
social issues, Toad
has "never tried to
be a message band," Dinning says in a phone
interview earlier this week. You write
"because you are a human being and
thoughts go through your head" — not
because you have a sermon to deliver.
Yet the shocking lyrics in "Hold Her
Down" pound with a message about violence

of the band —
Phillips is 21 and the
other three band
members are 25.
In fairness,

toward women. "Take her arms and hold
her down/until she stops breathing" captures
the rape mentality, and the lines "this
crime/the shame of what a man can do"
condemn it.
"Hold Her Down" "comes from know
ing too many people with that experience,"

don't ask me questions or i will retreat

he says, adding that he personally "knows
the three in five women" statistically said to
have been assaulted in their lifetime.
Speaking from the heart works well with
"Hold Her Down," but the pleonastic lyrics
found in the band's two earlier albums
"Bread and Circus" and "Pale" sap the inten
sity from Toad's songs and betray the youth

though, Toad definitely matured lyrically on
"Fear." Rather than "I was still a boy/naive
and sane/protected wholly/tongue-tied and
restless/breathing of futures," one finds "as
people turned to gods of cruel design/is it
that they fear the pain of death/or could it

be they fear the joy of life?"
ccording to Dinning,
two terms describe
Toad's music "power
H folk" and "mid
tempo melodrama."
Perhaps they've done a better job sum
ming up their sound than the music indus
try, which lumps them into the amorphous
category of "alternative rock."
Once you've heard "Pale," the group's
second release, you might find that "mid
tempo melodrama" not only describes
Toad's music more vividly than "alternative
rock" — it's pretty darn funny.
Of course, if you're in love, extremely
depressed or both, "Pale" could perfectly suit
your emotional needs. But if you're in a nor
mal state of mind, 11 painfully similar folk bal-

fame is a cancer and ego its seed

lads in a row only serve to rock you to sleep.
Happily, Toad proves their versatility on
"Fear" with cuts like the '60s rock "All I Want"
and the '90s grunge-like "Stories I Tell."
If one considers "alternative" to mean
creative manipulation of traditional musical

conventions — whether it be through disso
nance, the juxtaposition of speech and
singing, the use of obscure instruments, etc.
— then Toad's song "Butterflies" definitely
falls into this category.
But this is the only song on all three
albums that could be labeled "alternative" by
this definition.
"Alternative used to be new, progressive
music," says Dinning, cynically adding that

alternative is now
defined by "what drug
addiction you have
and how many tattoos
you have."

i wasnt looking for heaven or hell

And thanks to Top-40 stations, teeny
hoppers across the nation have begun
adding "alternative" Toad CD's to their
music collections.
After admitting that suburban white
college students comprise the majority of
Toad fans, Dinning quickly adds, "1 know
we appeal to a broad base of people."
Yet for the Santa Barbara natives, subur
bia is home. Drummer Randy Guss and gui
tarist Todd Nichols have known each other
since they were four.
Dinning met the two of them in junior
high and Phillips, who is three years younger
than the others, joined the threesome when
they were seniors in high school.

■ he way we talk to
■Bi MB each other hasn't
changed since we
were kids," he con
fides. "It's kind of funny."
Having grown up in California during the
'70s, Dinning cites Journey, The Steve Miller
Band and Fleetwood Mac among childhood
influences. But he says the band members
influenced him more than any artist.

The four band members possess varying
levels of musical training — Dinning had
classical training on the piano, Phillips
majored in music, and both Guss and
Nichols took music lessons.
"There was a time when my dad wanted
me to be a concert pianist," Dinning says,
recounting how his father's pressure caused
him to pick up guitar on the sly. He laughs at
the memory, then adds, "I had to rebel
against that.
■ oad, who will be
performing in Frost
Amphitheater on
Friday, strives to

maintain a normal band/normal guy image.
They stand by the line from "Stories I Tell,"
which states, "fame is a cancer and ego its
seed."
"We try to keep ourselves as detached
from the record companies as possible,"
Dinning says. But some of their fans would
beg to differ, according to Dinning. He says
some of their original fans believe Toad has
already "sold out" simply by gaining expo
sure and scoring hit songs.
In spite of the embittered few, Toad has
kept many of their original fans, he adds.
Much of this has to do with their initial pro
ducer, Marvin Etzioni.
Etzioni, formerly of the pop country

just someone to listen to stories i tell

cult band, Lone Justice, and the opening
act for Toad's concert on Friday, did not
seek to restructure the band's sound to suit
the market. Instead, he produced "Pale"
almost completely from the demo tape,
according to Restless Records publicist
Stacy Sanner.
Those fans who define "sell out" a bit more
realistically will be pleased to note that the sound
on the more experimental "Fear" remains con

sistent with earlier music found on "Pale" and
their first album, "Bread and Circus."
In addition, Toad has not — like the to
be-left-unnamed Irish band whose mem
bers' heads are bigger than their bank
accounts — become too famous to bond
with its audience.
"We still have that connection,"
Dinning says, adding that the first 10 rows at
their concerts still hold fans who know all
the words to their songs. He says Toad hopes
there will always be a "non-existent barrier
between the audience and us."
Yet success brings challenges as well.
"It doesn't allow nearly as much time at
home as we'd like," Dinning says. "This year

has been hellish with
all the travelling."
But Dinning says
he looks forward to
the Stanford concert

regardless of the fact that the only students
he remembers from the last time they were
here are the ones who were "busy running
around like chickens with their heads cut off
trying to get ready for the show just like stu
dents at every other college we play."
Toad hopes to begin recording a new
album this spring. As far as movie deals and
the other perks of making it big are con
cerned, Dinning says, "No offers as of yet."

the Wet Sprocket

"Fear" the day the
United States
declared war on
Iraq and finished
on the day of the
cease-fire.

"It makes your
thoughts shrink to a
pinpoint It's a hum
bling experience,"
he says gravely.

"We were looking forward to that
moment — it was our first time in a live stu
dio," bassist Dean Dinning explains, pas
sionately sharing the band's baptism into the
big time music scene. But the sight of bombs
falling on television reduced the initial
excitement for the group, he recalls.

"There are a lot more important things in life."
The ballad "I Will Not take These Things
For Granted" — in which lead singer Glen
Phillips croons "flowers in the garden/laugh
ter in the hall/children in the park/I will not
take these things for granted" — took on a
new meaning for Toad as a result.
espite their
in political and
social issues, Toad
has "never tried to
be a message band," Dinning says in a phone
interview earlier this week. You write
"because you are a human being and
thoughts go through your head" — not
because you have a sermon to deliver.
Yet the shocking lyrics in "Hold Her
Down" pound with a message about violence

of the band —
Phillips is 21 and the
other three band
members are 25.
In fairness,

toward women. "Take her arms and hold
her down/until she stops breathing" captures
the rape mentality, and the lines "this
crime/the shame of what a man can do"
condemn it.
"Hold Her Down" "comes from know
ing too many people with that experience,"

don't ask me questions or i will retreat

he says, adding that he personally "knows
the three in five women" statistically said to
have been assaulted in their lifetime.
Speaking from the heart works well with
"Hold Her Down," but the pleonastic lyrics
found in the band's two earlier albums
"Bread and Circus" and "Pale" sap the inten
sity from Toad's songs and betray the youth

though, Toad definitely matured lyrically on
"Fear." Rather than "I was still a boy/naive
and sane/protected wholly/tongue-tied and
restless/breathing of futures," one finds "as
people turned to gods of cruel design/is it
that they fear the pain of death/or could it

be they fear the joy of life?"
ccording to Dinning,
two terms describe
Toad's music "power
H folk" and "mid
tempo melodrama."
Perhaps they've done a better job sum
ming up their sound than the music indus
try, which lumps them into the amorphous
category of "alternative rock."
Once you've heard "Pale," the group's
second release, you might find that "mid
tempo melodrama" not only describes
Toad's music more vividly than "alternative
rock" — it's pretty darn funny.
Of course, if you're in love, extremely
depressed or both, "Pale" could perfectly suit
your emotional needs. But if you're in a nor
mal state of mind, 11 painfully similar folk bal-

fame is a cancer and ego its seed

lads in a row only serve to rock you to sleep.
Happily, Toad proves their versatility on
"Fear" with cuts like the '60s rock "All I Want"
and the '90s grunge-like "Stories I Tell."
If one considers "alternative" to mean
creative manipulation of traditional musical

conventions — whether it be through disso
nance, the juxtaposition of speech and
singing, the use of obscure instruments, etc.
— then Toad's song "Butterflies" definitely
falls into this category.
But this is the only song on all three
albums that could be labeled "alternative" by
this definition.
"Alternative used to be new, progressive
music," says Dinning, cynically adding that

alternative is now
defined by "what drug
addiction you have
and how many tattoos
you have."

i wasnt looking for heaven or hell

And thanks to Top-40 stations, teeny
hoppers across the nation have begun
adding "alternative" Toad CD's to their
music collections.
After admitting that suburban white
college students comprise the majority of
Toad fans, Dinning quickly adds, "1 know
we appeal to a broad base of people."
Yet for the Santa Barbara natives, subur
bia is home. Drummer Randy Guss and gui
tarist Todd Nichols have known each other

Dinning met the two of them in junior

influences. But he says the band members
influenced him more than any artist.

The four band members possess varying
levels of musical training — Dinning had
classical training on the piano, Phillips
majored in music, and both Guss and
Nichols took music lessons.
"There was a time when my dad wanted
me to be a concert pianist," Dinning says,
recounting how his father's pressure caused
him to pick up guitar on the sly. He laughs at
the memory, then adds, "I had to rebel

"We try to keep ourselves as detached
from the record companies as possible,"
Dinning says. But some of their fans would
beg to differ, according to Dinning. He says
some of their original fans believe Toad has
already "sold out" simply by gaining expo
sure and scoring hit songs.
In spite of the embittered few, Toad has
kept many of their original fans, he adds.
Much of this has to do with their initial pro
ducer, Marvin Etzioni.
Etzioni, formerly of the pop country

just someone to listen to stories i tell

cult band, Lone Justice, and the opening
act for Toad's concert on Friday, did not
seek to restructure the band's sound to suit
the market. Instead, he produced "Pale"
almost completely from the demo tape,
according to Restless Records publicist
Stacy Sanner.
Those fans who define "sell out" a bit more
realistically will be pleased to note that the sound
on the more experimental "Fear" remains con

sistent with earlier music found on "Pale" and
their first album, "Bread and Circus."
In addition, Toad has not — like the to
be-left-unnamed Irish band whose mem
bers' heads are bigger than their bank
accounts — become too famous to bond
with its audience.
"We still have that connection,"
Dinning says, adding that the first 10 rows at

the words to their songs. He says Toad hopes
there will always be a "non-existent barrier
between the audience and us."
Yet success brings challenges as well.
"It doesn't allow nearly as much time at
home as we'd like," Dinning says. "This year

has been hellish with
all the travelling."
But Dinning says
he looks forward to
the Stanford concert

regardless of the fact that the only students
he remembers from the last time they were
here are the ones who were "busy running
around like chickens with their heads cut off
