# Re-examining sexuality and suppression
## Theater Rhinoceros' "Bent" confronts tough issues 
### Peter Edmonston 
With the sudden emergence of gay rights in
the forefront of American politics, a re-exami
nation of the basic issues of love, hate, freedom
and suppression is necessary. San Franciso's
Theatre Rhinoceros, a gay and lesbian theater
company ambitiously attempts to do exactly
that in their production of Martin Sherman's
"Bent," a play about the Nazi persecution of
homosexuals.
To confront the audience immediately with
the parallel natures of the Nazi persecution and
current political events, posters in the lobby
compare statements of Jerry Falwell and Pat
Robertson with those of the Gestapo proclaim
ing the sanctity of the family unit.
To further the contemporary interpretation,

the scenery and costum
ing play down the his
torical element. A chart
on the wall serves as a
simple but shocking re
minder that the pink tri
angle, presently bandied
about as a generic sym
bol of homosexuality,
was originally the mark
for "perverts" in Nazi
death camps.

The first act follows Timothy Flanagan as
Max, a savvy bon-vivant, in his journey from
the gay underground of Berlin to the barracks
of Dachau. In the second act of the play, set in
Dachau, Max and another gay prisoner develop
a relationship that serves as a testimony to the
indomitable nature of the human spirit.
Sentimental and at times overwrought, the
pathos of Sherman's play seems hard to take in
a time so distant from the relative naivety of the
gay movement of the '70s, when the play was
written. However, Theatre Rhinoceros success
fully persuades the audience of the play's im
mediacy by using ambiguous sexual imagery
and exposing the unseemly sides of the issue.
Set in the Cabaret-like decadence of Berlin,
the play opens on Max and his lover in a morn
ing-after malaise. Soon their introductory ban
ter gives way to the underlying portrayal of a
community using cocaine and sex to forget its
marginalized and tenuous state.

The pink triangle was
originally the mark for
"perverts" in Nazi death
camps.

Most powerful is Greta, a lounge singer in
drag with a glaring white face, who sits alone on
a swing, crooning "The Streets of Berlin." This
song, a melancholy and portentous farewell to
the hedonism of Berlin, prepares the audience
for the oncoming Nazi assault and the splinter
ing of the community.
The second act presents the growing love be
tween Max and another gay prisoner, Hoist.
Even the strictest and most degrading treat
ment cannot suppress their love. This premise
becomes heavy-handed at times, especially due
to the pure, martyr-like portrayal of Hoist.
When the prisoners, forbidden to touch,
verbally excite each other to orgasm, it is po
tentially unclear whether or not the slightly
comic melodrama is intentional. Nonetheless,
the play's unapologetic presentation of emo-

tional intensity,
when it works, is
compelling. Max's
final impassioned cry
— "I loved you,
what's wrong with
that?" — in another
show could come
across as maudlin,
but Flanagan's deliv
ery is brutal in its
startling simplicity.

Throughout the play the mingled imagery of
sex and violence links the issues of sexuality and
suppression. There is a violent sexual energy in
Max's lustful retelling of how he engaged in
necrophilia with a woman in an effort to con
vince Nazi persecutors that he was straight.
A naked Nazi soldier lounging seductively
throughout the first scene is representative of
the blurring of violence and sex in this produc
tion. This theme is intensified when Flanagan,
his intense love perverted into violence, orgias
tically kicks his original lover to death at the
order of the Nazis.
Theatre Rhinoceros, a company devoted to
gay and lesbian theater, attempts to gear its
plays towards its audience, as demonstrated by
its recent cross-gender production of Jean-Paul
Sartre's "No Exit." The success of its produc
tion of" Bent" demonstrates this same commit
ment to challenging the audience instead of
preaching to the converted.
