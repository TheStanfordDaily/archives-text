# Steinbeck stars on the silver screen
## Director Gary Sinise brings a faithful rendition of John Steinbeck's timeless "Of Mice and Men" to film audiences

he said.
Although obvious parallels can be
drawn to homeless and jobless peo
ple today, the message of Sinise's "Of
Mice and Men" is not only for the less
privileged. Sinese said the isolation of
characters such as Crooks, Candy
and Curley's Wife can be found

The intense afternoon sun burns
down onto a field of ripe, golden bar
ley while men and machines gather
the harvest. Two workers struggle
with a heavy sack of grain while a
man at their side effortlessly tosses
bags onto the wagon.
Lennie, the hulking, simple
minded protagonist of John Stein
beck's "Of Mice and Men," is played
with tremendous skill by John
Malkovich. In the harvest scene and
others, his every gesture, movement
and facial expression reveals the
character's childlike innocence and
obliviousness to his own powerful
physical strength. As the movie un
folds, these childlike qualities be
come the basis for understanding the
friendship between Lennie and the
more cerebral George (Gary Sinise),
and the tragedy that concludes their
story.
In many ways, watching "Of Mice
and Men" is like taking a trip to a fa
miliar place. The cinematography
captures the hot, dusty air and gold
en hues that can still be seen in the
"Steinbeck country" of Soledad and
Salinas and much of the rest of Cali
fornia.
The story of the movie is a well
known staple of literature classes,
with George and Lennie achieving al
most mythic status in American cul
ture. The themes of loneliness and
friendship found throughout the
work transcend the story of Depres
sion-era ranch workers and remain
universal.
Gary Sinise — star, director and
producer of the film — said these
themes are the basis of the contem
porary relevance of Steinbeck's clas
sic. There are "a lot of Georges and
Lennies wandering around today,"

throughout all levels of society. •
Such loneliness is apparent in the
revised character of Curley's Wife,
(Sherilyn Fenn). In the screenplay
she is portrayed as desperately
friendless, in contrast to Steinbeck's
more abrasive, overtly flirtatious
character.
With the exception of this alter
ation, however, the film remains true
to Steinbeck's original. Sinise says he
sees the appeal of using classic stories
for movies and points to the recent
success of films such as "The Last of
the Mohicans."
"Of Mice and Men" relies heavily
on the timeless simplicity of its story,
but the film succeeds because of the
quality of the acting. In addition to
Malkovich's outstanding perfor
mance as Lennie, the work of Ray
Walston as Candy and Sinise as
George is equally noteworthy, as are
the dynamics between Malkovich
and Sinise.
The friendship between George
and Lennie develops onscreen as they
dream of owning land and rabbits. At
first George tells Lennie what they

will do as if he were a parent telling a
bedtime story. Later, when their
dream seems closer to realization,
George becomes wrapped up in the
fantasy as well. During the final
telling, the tragedy that has engulfed
the friends makes the repetition of
their once hopeful words painful to

The themes of loneliness and friendship
transcend the story of Depression-era
ranch workers and remain universal.

hear.
Despite the importance of this
central relationship, Sinise says that
every character has his or her own
moment. Some of the more powerful
scenes of the movie, such as the
killing of Candy's dog and Lennie's
fist fight with Curley highlight actors
other than the "stars" of the film.
This emphasis on ensemble acting
reflects Sinise's experience in the the
ater, including his starring role in a
Tony Award-winning production of
"The Grapes of Wrath." Though
many of the indoor scenes have a the
atrical nature, using full-length shots
rather than close-ups of the actors,
"Of Mice and Men" has a quicker
pace more appropriate to film. Sinese
says that in the adaptation to the big
screen, dialogue was cut and an extra
emphasis was put on imagery.
As a whole, Sinise's version of "Of
Mice and Men" is worthy of Stein
beck's original. The superb acting,
familiar story and poignant themes
give the film the potential, according
to Sinise, "to introduce a whole new
generation to Steinbeck's work."
