Standford's Fleet Street Singers — the
musical men in red ties — have had a busy
summer. But they did take a "50 Minute
Fun Break" to record their new compact
disc.
"Fun Break" features dorm concert fa
vorites like "The Pharoah Bop" and
"Prayer to the God of Partial Credit" in
addition to sweet, sincere ballads like
"When I Fall in Love" and "Since I Fell for
You." You can't graduate from the Farm
without at least one Fleet Street CD.
