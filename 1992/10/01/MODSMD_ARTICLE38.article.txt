# Sexiled from love

hat it was for tomorrow, and that it was "wrin
kled."
Staring at her, and her blouse, I had a vision.
And then I had another vision
It was late November. The air was cool. Cool
enough to make my nipples hard. Or anyone's
nipples hard, for that matter. The blouse-girl
was standing there in black pumps, a denim
miniskirt and aqua-green, sparkly eye-shad
ow. And the two Karaoke girls were there. And
they all looked at each other. And then they
looked at themselves. Then they screamed and
ran to the GAP.
Waking up, I realized the taste of bile in my
mouth was from something besides sleeping. It
was because I knew that this was the awful end
all my new Forenzaed friends would face.
Before I knew it, they would be deciding be
tween cable-knit sweaters in charcoal heather
and plum rose. The irons would be packed
away, the sexual tension would be shot, and we
could once again look at each other without
blushing. Or doing anything else for that mat
ter.
Sad, dejected and able to picture nothing
but brunettes in purple turtlenecks, I ambled
into Branner Hall. And it was there that this
whole freshman thing got me madder than that
little turban guy who was always foiled by Let
ter Man.
Three freshmen were in the lobby. Bags
under their eyes bigger than my, well, ego. They
had been "sexiled" from their rooms.
It was only the third night of school, and al
ready there were at least three people in inti
mate enough states of undress to send their
roommates into a lounge festooned with a

giant padlock coiled around the VCR.
Upstairs, mashing bodies took up every
nook, cranny and shower stall. The smell of bad
sex filled the air. And I hated them all.
I've been here for three long years, and I've
never had to sexile anybody. Not even close.
Once I asked someone to leave while I talked to
a woman, but that was mostly to apologize.
And there's no cute little word for that.
But I was able to turn my anger into some
thing tangible, if not constructive. And when I
was done with that, I washed my hands and
headed out with a peaceful feeling, blessing
each interlocked team of bodies with an honest
feeling of approval. Their openess, their hon
esty, even their gaudy, rhinestone-inset white
stockings were beautiful.
Because in a couple of weeks they will be de
sexed, de-individualized and GAPped until
you couldn't differentiate their clothes from
Ernie's or Bert's â€” no less the kids from
ZOOM.
Deep in my heart, and far away from my
loins, I'm glad we kids can all be together
without the pressure of having to impress, to
artificially attract or compete for attention
through our clothes or by flipping our hair
and giggling.
I feel free and comfortable here, and I can
tell what people look like in the morning with
out having to put the effort and risk into find
ing out.
But a push-bra now and then wouldn't be
such a bad idea.
Hit it Rockapella.
