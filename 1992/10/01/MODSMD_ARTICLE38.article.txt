# Sexiled from love

hat it was for tomorrow, and that it was "wrin
kled."
Staring at her, and her blouse, I had a vision.
And then I had another vision
It was late November. The air was cool. Cool
enough to make my nipples hard. Or anyone's
nipples hard, for that matter. The blouse-girl
was standing there in black pumps, a denim
miniskirt and aqua-green, sparkly eye-shad
ow. And the two Karaoke girls were there. And
they all looked at each other. And then they
looked at themselves. Then they screamed and
ran to the GAP.
Waking up, I realized the taste of bile in my
mouth was from something besides sleeping. It
was because I knew that this was the awful end
all my new Forenzaed friends would face.
Before I knew it, they would be deciding be
tween cable-knit sweaters in charcoal heather
and plum rose. The irons would be packed
away, the sexual tension would be shot, and we
could once again look at each other without
blushing. Or doing anything else for that mat
ter.
Sad, dejected and able to picture nothing
but brunettes in purple turtlenecks, I ambled
into Branner Hall. And it was there that this
whole freshman thing got me madder than that
little turban guy who was always foiled by Let
ter Man.
Three freshmen were in the lobby. Bags
under their eyes bigger than my, well, ego. They
had been "sexiled" from their rooms.
It was only the third night of school, and al
ready there were at least three people in inti
mate enough states of undress to send their
roommates into a lounge festooned with a

giant padlock coiled around the VCR.
Upstairs, mashing bodies took up every
nook, cranny and shower stall. The smell of bad
sex filled the air. And I hated them all.
I've been here for three long years, and I've
never had to sexile anybody. Not even close.
Once I asked someone to leave while I talked to
a woman, but that was mostly to apologize.
And there's no cute little word for that.
But I was able to turn my anger into some
thing tangible, if not constructive. And when I
was done with that, I washed my hands and
headed out with a peaceful feeling, blessing
each interlocked team of bodies with an honest
feeling of approval. Their openess, their hon
esty, even their gaudy, rhinestone-inset white
stockings were beautiful.
Because in a couple of weeks they will be de
sexed, de-individualized and GAPped until
you couldn't differentiate their clothes from
Ernie's or Bert's — no less the kids from
ZOOM.
Deep in my heart, and far away from my
loins, I'm glad we kids can all be together
without the pressure of having to impress, to
artificially attract or compete for attention
through our clothes or by flipping our hair
and giggling.
I feel free and comfortable here, and I can
tell what people look like in the morning with
out having to put the effort and risk into find
ing out.
But a push-bra now and then wouldn't be
such a bad idea.
Hit it Rockapella.

Diego. His column will appear in this very
spot each week, so you Jon t have to hurt
yourself trying to figure out this table of con
tents thing.
From the back, they all looked
like my high-school girlfriend.
Stonewashed jeans with dis
turbingly seductive mini-zippers at
the ankle. Hips swinging so far they
made Big Ben look like a
metronome. And make-up. Lots of
make-up. Make-up in non-earth
tones. Almost brought tears to my
eyes.
But as much as I wanted to ask
their best friends to ask them out for

me, I knew something was awry.
There was a queasy feeling in the pit
of my stomach that I only remem
bered from Jing-Jing's Mu Shu Pork
and that one time when, while mas
turbating to an "Afterhours" Show
time movie, I accidently sat on the
remote control, switching the chan
nel to C-SPAN, and saw Ross Perot
at just the wrong moment.
Stuck somewhere between my
worst nightmare and my most
Nabokovian fantasy, I had ambled
into some freshman Orientation
party, staring at two post-adoles
cents in size-6X midriff jackets and
black lace bras Karaoking to "Come
oft Eileen." And with her in that
dress, oh, my thoughts I confess —
they were, well, dirty.
As soon as the first horrible, yet
enticing thought about reading one
of them the entendre-drenched parts
of "Oh, the Places We'll Go" entered
my brain, I was filled with self-ha
tred. Slapping myself furiously —
but avoiding the monkey altogether
— I ran out of the sticky, alchohol
free frosh lair that was Lagunita.
Desperately searching Stern Hall
for some sanity, and maybe a nice
slice of vegetarian, 1 sprinted
through the halls, my surrealistic
nightmare continued as segu£-des
perate as an episode of "Voyagers."
To my right, a girl stood in her
room ironing a shirt. Tired, con
fused, and trying to eye up the iron
ing board for size and stability, I
asked her what she was ironing a
shirt for.
She told me that it was a blouse,

of them the entendre-drenched parts
of "Oh, the Places We'll Go" entered
my brain, I was filled with self-ha
tred. Slapping myself furiously —
but avoiding the monkey altogether
— I ran out of the sticky, alchohol
free frosh lair that was Lagunita.
Desperately searching Stern Hall
for some sanity, and maybe a nice
slice of vegetarian, 1 sprinted
through the halls, my surrealistic
nightmare continued as segu£-des
perate as an episode of "Voyagers."
To my right, a girl stood in her
room ironing a shirt. Tired, con
fused, and trying to eye up the iron
ing board for size and stability, I
asked her what she was ironing a
shirt for.
She told me that it was a blouse,

hat it was for tomorrow, and that it was "wrin
kled."
Staring at her, and her blouse, I had a vision.
And then I had another vision
It was late November. The air was cool. Cool
enough to make my nipples hard. Or anyone's
nipples hard, for that matter. The blouse-girl
was standing there in black pumps, a denim
miniskirt and aqua-green, sparkly eye-shad
ow. And the two Karaoke girls were there. And
they all looked at each other. And then they
looked at themselves. Then they screamed and
ran to the GAP.
Waking up, I realized the taste of bile in my
mouth was from something besides sleeping. It
was because I knew that this was the awful end
all my new Forenzaed friends would face.
Before I knew it, they would be deciding be
tween cable-knit sweaters in charcoal heather
and plum rose. The irons would be packed
away, the sexual tension would be shot, and we
could once again look at each other without
blushing. Or doing anything else for that mat
ter.
Sad, dejected and able to picture nothing
but brunettes in purple turtlenecks, I ambled
into Branner Hall. And it was there that this
whole freshman thing got me madder than that
little turban guy who was always foiled by Let
ter Man.
Three freshmen were in the lobby. Bags
under their eyes bigger than my, well, ego. They
had been "sexiled" from their rooms.
It was only the third night of school, and al
ready there were at least three people in inti
mate enough states of undress to send their
roommates into a lounge festooned with a

giant padlock coiled around the VCR.
Upstairs, mashing bodies took up every
nook, cranny and shower stall. The smell of bad
sex filled the air. And I hated them all.
I've been here for three long years, and I've
never had to sexile anybody. Not even close.
Once I asked someone to leave while I talked to
a woman, but that was mostly to apologize.
And there's no cute little word for that.
But I was able to turn my anger into some
thing tangible, if not constructive. And when I
was done with that, I washed my hands and
headed out with a peaceful feeling, blessing
each interlocked team of bodies with an honest
feeling of approval. Their openess, their hon
esty, even their gaudy, rhinestone-inset white
stockings were beautiful.
Because in a couple of weeks they will be de
sexed, de-individualized and GAPped until
you couldn't differentiate their clothes from
Ernie's or Bert's — no less the kids from
ZOOM.
Deep in my heart, and far away from my
loins, I'm glad we kids can all be together
without the pressure of having to impress, to
artificially attract or compete for attention
through our clothes or by flipping our hair
and giggling.
I feel free and comfortable here, and I can
tell what people look like in the morning with
out having to put the effort and risk into find
ing out.
But a push-bra now and then wouldn't be
such a bad idea.
Hit it Rockapella.

Joel Stein is still looking fur Carmen, San
Diego. His column will appear in this very
spot each week, so you Jon t have to hurt
yourself trying to figure out this table of con
tents thing.
From the back, they all looked
like my high-school girlfriend.
Stonewashed jeans with dis
turbingly seductive mini-zippers at
the ankle. Hips swinging so far they
made Big Ben look like a
metronome. And make-up. Lots of
make-up. Make-up in non-earth
tones. Almost brought tears to my
eyes.
But as much as I wanted to ask
their best friends to ask them out for

me, I knew something was awry.
There was a queasy feeling in the pit
of my stomach that I only remem
bered from Jing-Jing's Mu Shu Pork
and that one time when, while mas
turbating to an "Afterhours" Show
time movie, I accidently sat on the
remote control, switching the chan
nel to C-SPAN, and saw Ross Perot
at just the wrong moment.
Stuck somewhere between my
worst nightmare and my most
Nabokovian fantasy, I had ambled
into some freshman Orientation
party, staring at two post-adoles
cents in size-6X midriff jackets and
black lace bras Karaoking to "Come
oft Eileen." And with her in that
dress, oh, my thoughts I confess —
they were, well, dirty.
