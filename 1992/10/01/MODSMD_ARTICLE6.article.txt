# Looking to 'set a new tone'
## Faculty anticipate Casper's inaugural speech 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Following the indirect-cost
controversy that bruised Stan
ford's public image and led to a
damaging round of budget cuts,
Gerhard Casper will seek in his
inaugural address tomorrow to
"set a new tone" for the Univer
sity — one that finally shirks the
political baggage of the past two
years by reemphasizing teaching
and research, faculty members
said.
The first Stanford president
in 25 years to be brought in from
the outside, Casper is unscathed
by the indirect-cost controversy
and will be a credible spokesper
son for Stanford as it seeks to
recover from it, they said.
"He inherits a previous prob
lem that is not of his making and

he is not identified with," said
Gary Ernst, dean of the School
of Earth Sciences. "So he has an
opportunity, in a way, to make a
fresh start for the University."
The inauguration, scheduled
to begin at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow in
Frost Amphitheater, will mark
Casper's first public address to
the Stanford community.
Criticized in the past few
years for the indirect-cost con
troversy and for its top-heavy
administration that overshad
owed faculty concerns, Stanford
must re-emphasize teaching and
research, faculty said.
But they say Casper's first
public action earlier this month,
a major streamlining designed to
reduce the role of the adminis
tration, has already sent a pow
erful message on that subject —
and they expect his speech

tomorrow to underscore it.
"If I were the new president, I
would certainly make that mes
sage loud and clear," said Histo
ry Prof. Albert Camarillo, associ
ate dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
He added that as an outsider,
Casper "will be given the room to
to say, 'I wasn't involved in this;
1 want to lead Stanford in a new
direction. This is my vision.' "
But Ernst said Casper's
emphasis on teaching and
research is nothing new — former
president Donald Kennedy had
consistently sought to stress that
point, but his public message was
drowned out by the indirect-cost
controversy.

sight of our true mission," he
said.
Instead, Casper's restatement
of Stanford's academic emphasis
is simply a way to "fend off the
wolves" after indirect costs, Ernst
said.
Kennedy and Casper "are very
similar," Ernst said. "Don just had

the misfortune to have this prob
lem arise while he was president."
On the eve of Casper's inaugu
ration, "there's a tremendous
amount of good will" among the
faculty, said English Prof. Albert
Gelpi, a member of the Faculty
Senate. He added that "the
morale of the faculty has picked
up" since Casper's appointment
and his address tomorrow "will be
a very good occasion" to solidify
that support.
Faculty members have been
encouraged by Casper's "initial

moves and gestures," Gelpi said.
"What we want to hear now is his
vision of the University."
But Jean Fetter, Casper's top
assistant, said it would be unfair
to expect "instant solutions" to all
of Stanford's problems in a 20-
minute address. •
"It will clearly give some sense
of Gerhard Casper the president,
and it will certainly set a tone,"
she said. "But there will be a lot of
work to be done after the inaugu
ration. There is always a lot of
work to be done around here."
