# Looking to 'set a new tone'
## Faculty anticipate Casper's inaugural speech 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Following the indirect-cost
controversy that bruised Stan
ford's public image and led to a
damaging round of budget cuts,
Gerhard Casper will seek in his
inaugural address tomorrow to
"set a new tone" for the Univer
sity — one that finally shirks the
political baggage of the past two
years by reemphasizing teaching
and research, faculty members
said.
The first Stanford president
in 25 years to be brought in from
the outside, Casper is unscathed
by the indirect-cost controversy
and will be a credible spokesper
son for Stanford as it seeks to
recover from it, they said.
"He inherits a previous prob
lem that is not of his making and

he is not identified with," said
Gary Ernst, dean of the School
of Earth Sciences. "So he has an
opportunity, in a way, to make a
fresh start for the University."
The inauguration, scheduled
to begin at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow in
Frost Amphitheater, will mark
Casper's first public address to
the Stanford community.
Criticized in the past few
years for the indirect-cost con
troversy and for its top-heavy
administration that overshad
owed faculty concerns, Stanford
must re-emphasize teaching and
research, faculty said.
But they say Casper's first
public action earlier this month,
a major streamlining designed to
reduce the role of the adminis
tration, has already sent a pow
erful message on that subject —
and they expect his speech

tomorrow to underscore it.
"If I were the new president, I
would certainly make that mes
sage loud and clear," said Histo
ry Prof. Albert Camarillo, associ
ate dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
He added that as an outsider,
Casper "will be given the room to
to say, 'I wasn't involved in this;
1 want to lead Stanford in a new
direction. This is my vision.' "
But Ernst said Casper's
emphasis on teaching and
research is nothing new — former
president Donald Kennedy had
consistently sought to stress that
point, but his public message was
drowned out by the indirect-cost
controversy.
"It would be an unfair criti
cism of Don Kennedy, who is a
