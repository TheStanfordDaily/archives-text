# Sophomore single mother overcomes tough odds
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
After her CIV section, sophomore Paula
Shoemake goes home to the tiny Escondido
Village apartment she shares with her two
children.
The 34-year-old single mom has faced
tough odds on the way to Stanford: When
her husband left suddenly four years ago,
she had no job skills and no choice but to go
on welfare.
The San Jose resident decided to get a
part-time job and go back to school, often
setting her alarm for 3:30 a.m. to cram
before class. Shoemake graduated in
June as West Valley College's valedictori
an.
"I knew I wanted to continue on with
my education," she said, "but Stanford was
the furthest thing from my mind. It was

like an unreachable star."
Then she saw an advertisement for a
transfer admissions day. Arriving on cam
pus, Shoemake had a revelation.
"I just had this feeling wash over me,"
she said. "Tears were forming. . . This was
so overwhelming. I just had this tremen
dous sense that I belonged here."
Shoemake, along with her 11-year-old
son Scott and her daughter Tawni, 13, left
their home of 12 years for Escondido Vil
lage late last month.
The moving process and Orientation
activities have kept her from doing the
exploring she plans to do soon, she said ear
lier this week.
"Today I got on my bike for the first
time and rode onto campus," said Shoe
make, a small, blond woman with a soft
voice. "You want to ask someone to pinch
you and do a reality check."

Life changed suddenly
When her husband of 12 years left her
unexpectedly in 1988, Stanford was the
last place she thought she would end up.
Married just five months after she graduat
ed from high school, Shoemake had never
held a full-time job.
"Up until that time, we'd been a single
income family," she said, explaining that
she had helped her husband with his busi
ness, raised the children and volunteered
in the community.
"I'd been out of the work force for a long
time, so it really shook me up," Shoemake
said. Suddenly, a lifestyle that had included
a four-bedroom house, two cars, a boat and
ski vacations was out of the question.
As her savings ran out, Shoemake real
ized she had to do something fast. "I
applied for welfare, although it was a very

difficult thing to do," she said.
After going through a job training pro
gram, she finally found a part-time job as
an aide in a school library. But it was hard
to leave her children — who were already
"feeling insecure because of one parent
walking ofT" — and she wanted more.
So two years ago she signed up for typ
ing and computer classes to gain job skills
at West Valley College, a community col
lege in Saratoga Then a career counseling
class convinced her to aim higher — she
now wants to get a doctorate in psychology.
Shoemake, the first in her family to go
to a university, had been a good student in
high school but was more interested in
extracurricular activities like speech,
drama and music.
Now she's gotten serious about school.
With classes, a job and a family to
take care of, "there's never enough
time," Shoemake said. "You feel
like you're always running."
Tawni and Scott sometimes
don't understand why their mother
is so busy, but Shoemake said she
tries to "squeeze in" some inexpen
sive fun like trips to the beach.
With money so tight, she said,
"they will sometimes get angry
about the change in our situation."
The children were also upset about
leaving friends behind to move to
Stanford.
The new apartment is less than
half the size of their house in San
Jose, Shoemake said, which had a
double garage and yards in front
and back.
Still, Scott says he likes Tresid
der Union's Game Room and
Tawni enjoys the Stanford Shop
ping Center. They both attend
nearby Jordan Middle School.
Waiting for an answer
Falling in love with Stanford
was not enough — Shoemake still
had to get in.
She thought about applying to
Santa Clara University as well,
but said something stopped her. A
guaranteed transfer program to
San Jose State University was her
only backup.
"The application was very, very
difficult to get through. I wanted
it to be perfect," Shoemake said.
After finally finishing it, there
was nothing to do but wait. While
she was sure Stanford was for
her, she said, "I didn't want to get
my hopes up regardless of what I
had felt."
Shoemake was at a reception
for students in the community col
lege's re-entry program when the
answer finally came. A secretary
called her and her friends into the
office to hear a voice-mail message
from her son Scott.
"I just wanted to let my mom
know an envelope came in the
mail from Stanford and it has a
big 'Congratulations' on it,"he
had said.
"It hit me like a bolt of light
ning. We were all screaming and
crying," Shoemake remembers.
She was "shaking with emo
tion" and could hardly dial her
phone number, she said. As Scott
read the letter to her a line at a

time, she repeated it to her
friends.
While financial aid will help
some, the family's financial situa
tion is still far from secure. Welfare
and loans will help Shoemake pay
some living costs. And she already
has a job at Bing Nursery School.
She admits she's nervous
about Stanford academics. "Peo
ple have to be top-notch to get in
here," she said. But Shoemake is
also excited "about being here
with people who love to learn and
world-renown professors."
Even before coming to Stan
ford, she had an adviser — emi
nent Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo. They met at a psychology
convention this summer in Wash
ington, D.C., Shoemake said.
After getting her Ph.D., she
hopes to become a counselor and a
teacher.
The University is currently
evaluating the classes she's taken
to decide whether she has earned
junior standing. Meanwhile, she's
still trying to settle on a CIV class.
After two years at West Valley,
attending lectures with students
almost half her age is nothing new.
"It still feels a little awkward," she
said. "They look at you kind of
funny at first."
Doesn't *fit the patterns'
Being a non-traditional under
graduate at Stanford will be
tough, Shoemake said. "They
don't know what to do with some
one like me."
Because there are no provi
sions for undergraduates with

children, she didn't find out until
the last minute where she would
be living or whether she would get
housing at all.
"Everyone doesn't come out of
the same cookie cutter," she said,
explaining that it was hard to
uproot her children and move out
of a long-time residence on short
notice.
"You feel a little out of place,"
she said. "I don't fit the patterns."
Despite her hard work, Shoe
make downplays her own role in
her success. She is quick to recog
nize the contributions of family
and friends.
"I didn't get here by myself. I
had a lot of help," Shoemake said.
"They deserve as much credit as I
do."
Her parents and siblings have
been very supportive, she said.
"My mom and dad are popping
their buttons — they're very
proud. . . . My mother's already
joined the Stanford moms' club."
She also credits her kids. "Our
life has been a roller-coaster ride
for at least the last four years,"
Shoemake said. "You spend a lot
of time worrying how you're going
to take care of basic needs."
And those worries aren't
behind the family yet. She esti
mates that they will be $15,000 in
debt by the time she gets her mas
ter's degree.
"I'm not sure the Financial Aids
Office is taking enough into consid
eration that I have two kids," she
said, adding that she will still be a
struggling single mother when she
graduates.

Being a non-traditional under

"I didn't get here by myself. I

Her parents and siblings have

with her daughter, Tawni and son, Scott.
After her CIV section, sophomore Paula
Shoemake goes home to the tiny Escondido
Village apartment she shares with her two
children.
The 34-year-old single mom has faced
tough odds on the way to Stanford: When
her husband left suddenly four years ago,
she had no job skills and no choice but to go
on welfare.
The San Jose resident decided to get a
part-time job and go back to school, often
setting her alarm for 3:30 a.m. to cram
before class. Shoemake graduated in
June as West Valley College's valedictori
an.
"I knew I wanted to continue on with
my education," she said, "but Stanford was
the furthest thing from my mind. It was

like an unreachable star."
Then she saw an advertisement for a
transfer admissions day. Arriving on cam
pus, Shoemake had a revelation.
"I just had this feeling wash over me,"
she said. "Tears were forming. . . This was
so overwhelming. I just had this tremen
dous sense that I belonged here."
Shoemake, along with her 11-year-old
son Scott and her daughter Tawni, 13, left
their home of 12 years for Escondido Vil
lage late last month.
The moving process and Orientation
activities have kept her from doing the
exploring she plans to do soon, she said ear
lier this week.
"Today I got on my bike for the first
time and rode onto campus," said Shoe
make, a small, blond woman with a soft
voice. "You want to ask someone to pinch
you and do a reality check."

Life changed suddenly
When her husband of 12 years left her
unexpectedly in 1988, Stanford was the
last place she thought she would end up.
Married just five months after she graduat
ed from high school, Shoemake had never
held a full-time job.
"Up until that time, we'd been a single
income family," she said, explaining that
she had helped her husband with his busi
ness, raised the children and volunteered
in the community.
"I'd been out of the work force for a long
time, so it really shook me up," Shoemake
said. Suddenly, a lifestyle that had included
a four-bedroom house, two cars, a boat and
ski vacations was out of the question.
As her savings ran out, Shoemake real
ized she had to do something fast. "I
applied for welfare, although it was a very

difficult thing to do," she said.
After going through a job training pro
gram, she finally found a part-time job as
an aide in a school library. But it was hard
to leave her children — who were already
"feeling insecure because of one parent
walking ofT" — and she wanted more.
So two years ago she signed up for typ
ing and computer classes to gain job skills
at West Valley College, a community col
lege in Saratoga Then a career counseling
class convinced her to aim higher — she
now wants to get a doctorate in psychology.
Shoemake, the first in her family to go
to a university, had been a good student in
high school but was more interested in
extracurricular activities like speech,
drama and music.
Now she's gotten serious about school.
With classes, a job and a family to
take care of, "there's never enough
time," Shoemake said. "You feel
like you're always running."
Tawni and Scott sometimes
don't understand why their mother
is so busy, but Shoemake said she
tries to "squeeze in" some inexpen
sive fun like trips to the beach.
With money so tight, she said,
"they will sometimes get angry
about the change in our situation."
The children were also upset about
leaving friends behind to move to
Stanford.
The new apartment is less than
half the size of their house in San
Jose, Shoemake said, which had a
double garage and yards in front
and back.
Still, Scott says he likes Tresid
der Union's Game Room and
Tawni enjoys the Stanford Shop
ping Center. They both attend
nearby Jordan Middle School.
Waiting for an answer
Falling in love with Stanford
was not enough — Shoemake still
had to get in.
She thought about applying to
Santa Clara University as well,
but said something stopped her. A
guaranteed transfer program to
San Jose State University was her
only backup.
"The application was very, very
difficult to get through. I wanted
it to be perfect," Shoemake said.
After finally finishing it, there
was nothing to do but wait. While
she was sure Stanford was for
her, she said, "I didn't want to get
my hopes up regardless of what I
had felt."
Shoemake was at a reception
for students in the community col
lege's re-entry program when the
answer finally came. A secretary
called her and her friends into the
office to hear a voice-mail message
from her son Scott.
"I just wanted to let my mom
know an envelope came in the
mail from Stanford and it has a
big 'Congratulations' on it,"he
had said.
"It hit me like a bolt of light
ning. We were all screaming and
crying," Shoemake remembers.
She was "shaking with emo
tion" and could hardly dial her
phone number, she said. As Scott
read the letter to her a line at a

time, she repeated it to her
friends.
While financial aid will help
some, the family's financial situa
tion is still far from secure. Welfare
and loans will help Shoemake pay
some living costs. And she already
has a job at Bing Nursery School.
She admits she's nervous
about Stanford academics. "Peo
ple have to be top-notch to get in
here," she said. But Shoemake is
also excited "about being here
with people who love to learn and
world-renown professors."
Even before coming to Stan
ford, she had an adviser — emi
nent Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo. They met at a psychology
convention this summer in Wash
ington, D.C., Shoemake said.
After getting her Ph.D., she
hopes to become a counselor and a
teacher.
The University is currently
evaluating the classes she's taken
to decide whether she has earned
junior standing. Meanwhile, she's
still trying to settle on a CIV class.
After two years at West Valley,
attending lectures with students
almost half her age is nothing new.
"It still feels a little awkward," she

Waiting for an answer
Falling in love with Stanford
was not enough — Shoemake still
had to get in.
She thought about applying to
Santa Clara University as well,
but said something stopped her. A
guaranteed transfer program to
San Jose State University was her
only backup.
"The application was very, very
difficult to get through. I wanted
it to be perfect," Shoemake said.
After finally finishing it, there
was nothing to do but wait. While
she was sure Stanford was for
her, she said, "I didn't want to get
my hopes up regardless of what I
had felt."
Shoemake was at a reception
for students in the community col
lege's re-entry program when the
answer finally came. A secretary
called her and her friends into the
office to hear a voice-mail message
from her son Scott.
"I just wanted to let my mom
know an envelope came in the
mail from Stanford and it has a
big 'Congratulations' on it,"he
had said.
"It hit me like a bolt of light
ning. We were all screaming and
crying," Shoemake remembers.
She was "shaking with emo
tion" and could hardly dial her
phone number, she said. As Scott
read the letter to her a line at a

time, she repeated it to her
friends.
While financial aid will help
some, the family's financial situa
tion is still far from secure. Welfare
and loans will help Shoemake pay
some living costs. And she already
has a job at Bing Nursery School.
She admits she's nervous
about Stanford academics. "Peo
ple have to be top-notch to get in
here," she said. But Shoemake is
also excited "about being here
with people who love to learn and
world-renown professors."
Even before coming to Stan
ford, she had an adviser — emi
nent Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo. They met at a psychology
convention this summer in Wash
ington, D.C., Shoemake said.
After getting her Ph.D., she
hopes to become a counselor and a
teacher.
The University is currently
evaluating the classes she's taken
to decide whether she has earned
junior standing. Meanwhile, she's
still trying to settle on a CIV class.
After two years at West Valley,
attending lectures with students
almost half her age is nothing new.
"It still feels a little awkward," she
said. "They look at you kind of
funny at first."
Doesn't *fit the patterns'
Being a non-traditional under
graduate at Stanford will be
tough, Shoemake said. "They
don't know what to do with some
one like me."
Because there are no provi
sions for undergraduates with

children, she didn't find out until
the last minute where she would
be living or whether she would get
housing at all.
"Everyone doesn't come out of
the same cookie cutter," she said,
explaining that it was hard to
uproot her children and move out
of a long-time residence on short
notice.
"You feel a little out of place,"
she said. "I don't fit the patterns."
Despite her hard work, Shoe
make downplays her own role in
her success. She is quick to recog
nize the contributions of family
and friends.
"I didn't get here by myself. I
had a lot of help," Shoemake said.
"They deserve as much credit as I
do."
Her parents and siblings have
been very supportive, she said.
"My mom and dad are popping
their buttons — they're very
proud. . . . My mother's already
joined the Stanford moms' club."
She also credits her kids. "Our
life has been a roller-coaster ride
for at least the last four years,"
Shoemake said. "You spend a lot
of time worrying how you're going
to take care of basic needs."
And those worries aren't
behind the family yet. She esti
mates that they will be $15,000 in
debt by the time she gets her mas
ter's degree.
"I'm not sure the Financial Aids
Office is taking enough into consid
eration that I have two kids," she
said, adding that she will still be a
struggling single mother when she
graduates.
