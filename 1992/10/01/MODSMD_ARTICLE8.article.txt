# Sophomore single mother overcomes tough odds

After her CIV section, sophomore Paula
Shoemake goes home to the tiny Escondido
Village apartment she shares with her two
children.
The 34-year-old single mom has faced
tough odds on the way to Stanford: When
her husband left suddenly four years ago,
she had no job skills and no choice but to go
on welfare.
The San Jose resident decided to get a
part-time job and go back to school, often
setting her alarm for 3:30 a.m. to cram
before class. Shoemake graduated in
June as West Valley College's valedictori
an.
"I knew I wanted to continue on with
my education," she said, "but Stanford was
the furthest thing from my mind. It was

like an unreachable star."
Then she saw an advertisement for a
transfer admissions day. Arriving on cam
pus, Shoemake had a revelation.
"I just had this feeling wash over me,"
she said. "Tears were forming. . . This was
so overwhelming. I just had this tremen
dous sense that I belonged here."
Shoemake, along with her 11-year-old
son Scott and her daughter Tawni, 13, left
their home of 12 years for Escondido Vil
lage late last month.
The moving process and Orientation
activities have kept her from doing the
exploring she plans to do soon, she said ear
lier this week.
"Today I got on my bike for the first
time and rode onto campus," said Shoe
make, a small, blond woman with a soft
voice. "You want to ask someone to pinch
you and do a reality check."

Life changed suddenly
When her husband of 12 years left her
unexpectedly in 1988, Stanford was the
last place she thought she would end up.
Married just five months after she graduat
ed from high school, Shoemake had never
held a full-time job.
"Up until that time, we'd been a single
income family," she said, explaining that
she had helped her husband with his busi
ness, raised the children and volunteered
in the community.
"I'd been out of the work force for a long
time, so it really shook me up," Shoemake
said. Suddenly, a lifestyle that had included
a four-bedroom house, two cars, a boat and
ski vacations was out of the question.
As her savings ran out, Shoemake real
ized she had to do something fast. "I
applied for welfare, although it was a very

difficult thing to do," she said.
After going through a job training pro
gram, she finally found a part-time job as
an aide in a school library. But it was hard
to leave her children — who were already
"feeling insecure because of one parent
walking ofT" — and she wanted more.
So two years ago she signed up for typ
ing and computer classes to gain job skills
at West Valley College, a community col
lege in Saratoga Then a career counseling
class convinced her to aim higher — she
now wants to get a doctorate in psychology.
Shoemake, the first in her family to go
to a university, had been a good student in
high school but was more interested in
extracurricular activities like speech,
drama and music.
Now she's gotten serious about school.
