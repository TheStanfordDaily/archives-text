He's no Gorby, but we love him anyway.
Tickets for Friday's inauguration and investiture
of University President Gerhard Casper have been
in high demand, distributors said, but have not been
as hot a commodity as the passes to go see another
foreign leader who came to Stanford.
"They've been going well. They haven't been
going like Gorbachev," said Waka Takahashi, who
was distributing tickets to staff in White Plaza yes
terday.
Takahashi said more passes were given out
Monday, when the line at times stretched form the
front of her booth on the Plaza's central, grassy
area, to the bandshell about halfway across the
plaza.
The line for student tickets at the booth next door
was even longer, she said.
Ticket Office Manager Randy Alves said she did
not know exactly how many of the approximately

9,000 tickets have been given away, but said some
tickets were still available last night.
After 5 p.m. yesterday, the excess tickets were
made available to anyone who wanted to attend
regardless of their connection to the University, she
said.
As many as 9,500 students, faculty, staff, invited
guests and others could fill Frost Amphitheater
tomorrow morning to watch Casper take the oath,
Alves said.
Seating for the event opens at 8:30 a.m., and the
academic procession beginning the ceremony starts
at 9:20 a.m.
And in at least one manner, Casper's inaugura
tion will help fulfill his promise to concentrate on
undergraduate education.
Freshman Andy Chassin said attending Casper's
inauguration is an early assignment in his Great
Works Cultures, Ideas and Values class.
But, he said, it won't be on the test. Chassin said
he is only required to observe and help Stanford offi
cially welcome its ninth leader.
He's no Gorby, but we love him anyway.
