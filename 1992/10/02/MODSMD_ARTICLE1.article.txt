# Memorial Church reopens
## Renovation nearly done First services in three years begin on Sunday 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Today's three-hour opening of Memorial
Church may not be enough time for visitors
to fully take in the church's three years of
repairs and upgrades.
It probably won't be until the doors are
open for general use —which will be by the
Nov. 1 rededication — that people will begin
to notice the lighting, the sound and the gen
eral appearance of the church have greatly
improved.
"None of the work on the church is evi
dent," said Olivier Pieron, the project direc
tor for the rebuilding of Memorial Church.
"Though most of its systems were upgraded,
everything was left intact."
According to Pieron, because the 7.0 Oct.
1989 earthquake wreaked such extensive
and costly damage, the construction crew
had initially planned only repairs — not
upgrades and changes — to the church.
But, thanks to the design team's efforts to
reduce construction costs, they were "able to
add to the scope of the work," Pieron said.
The additional work included upgrading
the electrical and lighting systems, refinish
ing the floor and 100 pews, installing a sprin
kler system and more exits so two of the bal
conies — which had been closed because
they were fire hazards — could be used.
The renovated lighting system consists
mainly of several lights hung over the middle
of the church, which was not previously illu
minated.
But the new lights aren't the only reason
it's so much brighter in the 89-year old
church. The less "gloomy" atmosphere of the
church, Dean of Chapel Robert Gregg said, is
also due to last summer's window cleaning
and the removal of chicken wire that had cov
ered the stained glass since the 19605.
"It's the first time in 25 years that there's
been nothing between the sunlight and the
windows," Gregg said.
Gregg ordered the wire removed because
it had outlived its original purpose — pro
tecting the glass from "unruly students" of
the Vietnam era, who broke many windows
on campus in protest of the war.
Another change still in progress is the
removal of several pews from the right side
of the church, which will be refitted with 100
custom-made chairs. An altar will be placed
in front of the chairs.
"It will be roped off and made as a side
chapel for people who want some quiet, with
out all the tourists with video cameras,"
Gregg said.
Pieron said the project went as planned,
with a few problems such as discovering that
the actual dimensions of the church did not

match those found on church
plans.
Though several pieces of the
mosaic had been taken by people
as souvenirs, Pieron said the crew
had "pretty much everything we
needed."
Three important chunks of the
angel mosaic were returned
anonymously in April.
Gregg said that the only
drawback of being finished is
that the construction crew is
leaving.
"They were a crew of 30 who
really wanted to work here," he
said.
According to Gregg, the group
had previously worked together
on St. Joseph's Church in San
Jose, and had made a special bid
to work on Memorial Church.
Fund-raisers were able to get
more than the $10 million needed
to finance the reconstruction pro
ject, $8 million of which was used
for the actual construction with
another $1.5 million used for
maintenance.
According to Ann Rossi, associ
ate area director for the Office of
Development, the fund raising
went smoothly, considering how
difficult it usually is to raise
money for buildings, especially
old ones.
Much of the funding came
from people who had been mar

ried in the church, she said.
A tale of two earthquakes
When an 8.3 earthquake hit
Stanford in 1906, the Victorian
steeple and clock tower that used
to stand atop of the church's main
arches fell the 80-plus feet to the
floor with such impact that some
of the windows were blown out.
Afterward, workers dismantled
the entire church, except for the
arch system and the round room.
The rest of the church was rebuilt
and reinforced, but not the arches,
which the builders assumed were
strong enough since they had
withstood the first earthquake.
But when the 1989 earthquake
hit, the arches were the first
things to weaken. Chunks of
mosaic tile fell from the dome
supported by the arches, breaking
some of the pews that were
underneath.
"It was a near miss on
injuries," said Gregg, who was in
his office in the round room at the
time. A Classics Department
music and poetry program had
just concluded, and students were
getting ready to leave the church
when the earthquake hit.
When Gregg came out to
inspect the damage, he said it
looked as if one of the arches had
slipped four to five inches, and
there were visible cracks at the
top of every arch. A piece of steel
from the ceiling had also cut
through the balcony rails.
"It was an eerie feeling hearing
that such major damage occurred

but knowing that no one was
hurt," said Diana Akiyama, an
associate dean of the church.
Moving to Dink, Kresge
The closing of the church
forced several religious groups to
relocate their services. The
Protestant Ecumenical morning
services — led by the deans —
have been held in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium since the temblor.
However, the atmosphere in
the auditorium wasn't quite the
same. "It was like a lecture,"
Gregg said. "People had a hard
time warming to Dink."
He said the services lost almost
half of their normal congregation
of about 400 to 500 worshippers.
Though the Roman Catholic
community did not lose as much
of its congregation when it moved
to Kresge Auditorium, Jim Erps, a
campus minister for the Roman
Catholic community, said he could
tell that Catholics "really miss not
having the beautiful art."
Regular churchgoers weren't
the only ones who missed Memo
rial Church. Akiyama said it
wasn't until after the church
closed down that the deans real
ized how many people used it.
"We didn't always know who
was there," Akiyama said. "But
after it was closed, we heard that
a lot of people missed being able
to go in there during lunch hour.
"People liked it because it was
so huge — they could go there to
be alone and have some private
time."
