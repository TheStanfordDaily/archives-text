Today's three-hour opening of Memorial
Church may not be enough time for visitors
to fully take in the church's three years of
repairs and upgrades.
It probably won't be until the doors are
open for general use —which will be by the
Nov. 1 rededication — that people will begin
to notice the lighting, the sound and the gen
eral appearance of the church have greatly
improved.
"None of the work on the church is evi
dent," said Olivier Pieron, the project direc
tor for the rebuilding of Memorial Church.
"Though most of its systems were upgraded,
everything was left intact."
According to Pieron, because the 7.0 Oct.
1989 earthquake wreaked such extensive
and costly damage, the construction crew
had initially planned only repairs — not
upgrades and changes — to the church.
But, thanks to the design team's efforts to
reduce construction costs, they were "able to
add to the scope of the work," Pieron said.
The additional work included upgrading
the electrical and lighting systems, refinish
ing the floor and 100 pews, installing a sprin
kler system and more exits so two of the bal
conies — which had been closed because
they were fire hazards — could be used.
The renovated lighting system consists
mainly of several lights hung over the middle
of the church, which was not previously illu
minated.
But the new lights aren't the only reason
it's so much brighter in the 89-year old
church. The less "gloomy" atmosphere of the
church, Dean of Chapel Robert Gregg said, is
also due to last summer's window cleaning
and the removal of chicken wire that had cov
ered the stained glass since the 19605.
"It's the first time in 25 years that there's
been nothing between the sunlight and the
windows," Gregg said.
Gregg ordered the wire removed because
it had outlived its original purpose — pro
tecting the glass from "unruly students" of
the Vietnam era, who broke many windows
on campus in protest of the war.
Another change still in progress is the
removal of several pews from the right side
of the church, which will be refitted with 100
custom-made chairs. An altar will be placed
in front of the chairs.
"It will be roped off and made as a side
chapel for people who want some quiet, with
out all the tourists with video cameras,"
Gregg said.
Pieron said the project went as planned,
with a few problems such as discovering that
the actual dimensions of the church did not
