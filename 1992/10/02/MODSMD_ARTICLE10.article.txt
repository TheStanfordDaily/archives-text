# Panel discusses national election, Perot's new VP
## 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Hot on the heels of Ross Perot's
afternoon decision to re-enter the
1992 presidential race, four distin
guished members of the Stanford
community gathered last night to
discuss the upcoming presidential
election.
The panel was the first of three
lectures in a series sponsored by
the Stanford Alumni Association
and the Hoover Institution.
John Bunzel, senior research
fellow at Hoover, began the discus
sion with a series of tongue-in
cheek attacks on the conservative
nature of the institution. "As a
Democrat, I find it hard to stop
and smell the roses without
smelling the fertilizer," he said.
Confident of the defeat of the
Bush Administration, Bunzel
claimed it would be difficult for
Bush to be re-elected without tak
ing drastic measures. "While
Americans may believe Bush is a
better person," he said, "they still
seem to think that Clinton will
make a better president."
He attributed Clinton's popu
larity to Americans' general desire
for change. "One of the major
changes this year is the over
whelming support for Clinton
among women. The gender gap
will have a tremendous influence
in this year's election," he said.
John Ferejohn, a professor of
political science and a Hoover
senior fellow, spoke about the
upcoming House of Representa
tives and Senate race.
"This will be an incredibly
unusual election," he said. "The
House will most likely emerge in a
very different light. The largest
turnover in the House was in
1948. I predict that this year we

will exceed that."
Me cited the fact that 106
women, 45 African-Americans, 30
Chicanos and Latinos and one
Native American are running for
seats.
Martin Anderson, also a senior
fellow, said there are many unan
swered questions regarding the
three candidates.
"We need to ask Hush about his
involvement in the Iran-Contra
dealings. Just how involved was he?
We need to ask Clinton his proposed
idea for a 100,000-member police
corps. We also need to question his
'smart card' proposal," he said.
These "smart cards" would be
small cards, like credit cards, hold
ing an individual's medical infor
mation. Anderson brought up the
problems of HIV, abortion and
venereal disease being recorded on
these cards.
"We also need to ask Perot
about his economic program," he
said. "He wants to increase the tax
on gas by 50 cents. Let me ask you
this: when was the last time Perot
rode up into a gas station and said
'Fill 'er up?' "
David Brady, a professor of
political science said emphatically,
"Bill will be the next president."
Brady said he is not worried
about Perot's re-entry into the
election. "There are only two sce
narios involved here. Father Perot
will stay below 10 percent or above
10 percent in the popularity polls.
If he stays below 10 percent, Bush
will lose by less.
"If he wants to stay above 10
percent, he will have to do three
things. He will have to show up
on something other than Larry
King Live, he will have to hit
Clinton and Bush up on the bud
get and he will have to do incredi
bly well in the debates."
