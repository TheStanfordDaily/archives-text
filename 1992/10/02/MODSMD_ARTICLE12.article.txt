Clinton responds to Hush tax ad
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush began
airing an ad claiming Bill Clinton would be forced
into a sharp middle-class tax increase to keep his
campaign promises, drawing a roar of protest yes
terday from the Democratic camp.
The 30-second Republican tax ad began airing
Wednesday night on network television. Clinton
quickly called it "bogus."
The Republican ad shows what Bush aides said
were real taxpayers — a steamfitter, a scientist, two
sales representatives and a housing lender. It claims
their taxes would go up by amounts ranging from
$1,088 to $2,077 under Clinton's economic plan.
Clinton and his running mate, A 1 Gore,
expressed outrage over what they called an inac
curate ad.
In a count attack, Democrats began running an
ad blasting back at Bush on the tax issue, remind
ing voters of his broken "read my lips" no-new
taxes pledge.
Candidates on defense cuts
WASHINGTON (AP) — Here are the views of
the presidential candidates on what level of defense
cuts they advocate over the next five years:

Bush: "With the end of the Cold War and the
breakup of the former Soviet Union, we can down
size our military forces in a responsible manner
without impeding our ability to repel or defeat mil
itary attacks that threaten our vital national inter
ests. That's why I have proposed to reduce the
defense budget by $50 billion over the next five
years, in addition to already planned reductions.
By 1997, we will have cut defense spending as a
share of our gross national product to 3.4 percent,
the lowest figure since World War II."
Clinton: "I support reducing defense spend
ing over the next five years by $60 billion more
than what the president has proposed in his bud
get. This is only 5 percent more than what the
president has proposed."
Perot: "We don't need to be ready to fight World
War 111 because World War 111 is not going to break
out tomorrow. ... Our military budget is stuffed
with relics from the Cold War, such as the B-2 and
the Seawolf submarine. We don't need them. ...
We need to implement a well-conceived and deliber
ate plan to restructure the defense budget to match
the post-Cold War reality. In doing so, we can save
at least an additional $40 billion during the five
years over the cuts proposed by President Bush."
