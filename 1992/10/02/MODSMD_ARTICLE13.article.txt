Industrial sector falls sharply
NEW YORK (AP) — Growth in the nation's
manufacturing sector ground to a surprising halt
in September, the first contraction in eight
months, according to a closely watched survey of
purchasing executives released yesterday.
The National Association of Purchasing Man
agement's key index of manufacturing activity fell
sharply to 49 percent from 53.7 percent in August.
A reading above 50 percent generally indicates
the manufacturing economy is expanding; below 50
percent indicates a decline. At 44.5 percent or lower,
the overall economy is in a full-fledged recession.
The report shocked economists, who expected
the industrial sector to remain in a holding pat
tern or to show slight improvement.
Most of the decline was attributed to a drastic
plunge in new orders, which fell for the first time
in 17 months.
The decline in new orders means "we are not
likely to see any notable growth in either the man
ufacturing sector or the overall economy," the
report said. "The economic malaise will likely
continue."
Welfare 'social contract' issued
LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Linda White says
Michigan's new "social contract" asking welfare
recipients like herself to go to work, school or vol
unteer 20 hours a week is a poor bargain.
She temporarily gave up her job as a secretary
so she can stay home to nurse her son, who has

severe asthma. She says the rule that went into
effect yesterday will force her to find somebody
else to care for him.
The contract is the centerpiece of welfare initia
tives that kicked in exactly a year after Republican
Gov. John Engler won a budget cut that halted
welfare benefits for more than 82,000 adults.
Other major welfare changes also went into
effect yesterday in New Jersey and South Carolina.
Engler said the social contract will change the
nature of welfare from handout to hand up.
Kurdish guerillas kill 25
BITLIS, Turkey (AP) — Kurdish guerrillas
attacked a village in southeastern Turkey yester
day killing at least 25 people and wounding 25
more, state radio said.
The guerrillas opened fire with automatic rifles
and grenade launchers and set houses on fire in
the village of Cevizdali, state radio said.
The village, about 700 miles southeast of
Ankara, was defended by government-armed vil
lage guards, said an official who spoke on condi
tion of anonymity.
The government has created a 30,000-strong
militia to counter the guerrilla threat. The guer
rillas of the Kurdish Workers Party frequently
target the guards, many of whom are Kurds,
accusing them of betraying the Kurdish cause.
The Turkish government refuses to grant auton
omy to the Kurds, who make up one-fiflh of the pop
ulation of Turkey. More than 5,000 people have died
in the insurgency by the Kurdish Workers Party.
