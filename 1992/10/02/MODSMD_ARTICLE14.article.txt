# Early returns in Angola elections:
## MPLA has lead over UNITA 
### 
LUANDA, Angola (AP) —
President Jose Eduardo dos San
tos enjoyed a powerful lead over
former rebel leader Jonas Savim
bi in early returns yesterday from
Angola's first democratic elec
tions.
The early returns — up to 5
percent of the vote in 10 out of 18
provinces — showed the ruling
Popular Movement for the Libera
tion of Angola, or MPLA, winning
67 percent of the legislative bal
lots, and dos Santos with 66 per
cent in the presidential election.
The National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola,
the U.S.-backed rebel group
turned-opposition party, had 25.6
percent, according to the returns.
Its leader, Savimbi, had 27.6 per
cent of the presidential vote.
A spokesman for the opposi
tion party, known by its initials
UNITA, claimed the early results
were unrepresentative of voting
patterns across the vast southern
African nation.
"We're getting positive results
for UNITA in all parts of Ango
la," said Jorge Valentin.
But Valentin said he had no

complaints about the voting pro
cess.
Angolans waited nervously for
the results, which could take a
week to count, wondering
whether the loser would accept
them as free and fair or react with
violence.
The two parties fought a bitter,
16-year civil war that killed at
least 350,000 people and devas
tated the once-prosperous former
Portuguese colony before a truce
was declared in May 1991.
The MPLA was supported by
Cuban troops and Soviet arms. As
the conflict escalated into a Cold
War conflict, the United States
sent arms, and South Africa sent
soldiers to back Savimbi's rebels.
The results from the National
Electoral Council will be subject
to a recount if requested by one of
the 18 parties participating in the
election.
None of the smaller parties
gained more than 2 percent in the
preliminary tally.
The first official results came
12 hours later than expected as
officials painstakingly counted
the paper ballots.

If the first results hold up it
will be a victory for the slick cam
paign ran by the MPLA's Brazil
ian public relations firm, which
stressed the party's shift from
Marxism and presented dos San
tos as a defender of democracy.
UNITA's campaign relied
heavily on Savimbi's charismatic
leadership. He appealed to rural
people with attacks on privilege
and corruption among the MPLA
elite in Luanda.
International observers praised
the Angolan people for their
patient, peaceful and enthusiastic
turnout over the two days of vot
ing Tuesday and Wednesday.
"I had a marvellous impres
sion, the people were very disci
plined, very civilized," said Omar
Gad, a aide to Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, and one of 800
international monitors.
Margaret Anstee, the British
head of a U.N. monitoring team,
said the United Nations could
only declare the election free and
fair after vote counting was offi
cially concluded. Electoral offi
cials said that could take several
days.
