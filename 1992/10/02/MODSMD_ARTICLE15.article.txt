# Sex in the sand hurt morale

ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) â€” Two-thirds of Ameri
can troops who served in coed units during the Gulf
War say men and women were having sex, and more
than half said it hurt morale, according to a study
for a government panel.
Results of the Roper Organization poll were pre
sented Thursday to the Presidential Commission on
the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces.
There was no data to indicate how much sex
occurred or how many men and women were involved.
About one-fourth of the 4,442 members of the armed
forces interviewed served in the Persian Gulf.
Those who served in mixed units were asked
whether there was sexual activity between men and
women in their unit, and 64 percent said yes. The
other 34 percent said they didn't believe there had
been sexual contact.
The highest incidents of reported sexual activity
was in the Army and Marines, at 74 percent and 73
percent respectively. It was 64 percent in the Air
Force and 41 percent in the Navy.
Sixty-two percent of those who reported sexual
goings-on said it did little or no harm to the unit's
readiness, while 55 percent said it hurt morale. No
questions were asked to explain how the activity
might have hurt morale.
A unit was not defined. It could be a company, a
battalion or a headquarters squadron, pollsters said.
All of the surveyed personnel who were in the war
were asked whether men and women in their unit

had sex with members of other units. Sixty-one per
cent said yes and 34 percent no.
The poll said 98 percent of the military who
served in the Gulf War rated the military perfor
mance of men in their unit as excellent or good, but
only 61 percent gave similar ratings to the women.
More than eight of 10 Air Force personnel and two
thirds of those in the Navy gave excellent or good rat
ings to the women as soldiers, but only 48 percent of
soldiers and 44 percent of Marines did so. Neverthe
less, 96 percent of those in all services said the perfor
mance of their unit as a whole was excellent or good.
Paul Jones, director of defense force management
for the congressional General Accounting Office,
which is studying the performance of women in the
Gulf War, said their appraisals were "highly positive
although expectations had been generally low."
Jones said restrictions on putting women in for
ward positions were unevenly applied and when they
were applied "may have impeded the most effective
use of human resources."
Of the entire sample, 57 percent said they favored
continuing to bar women from combat roles.
Women, by a majority of 58 percent, said the rule
should be scrapped.
Women make up approximately 11 percent of the
armed services, but are barred by law or policy from
direct combat roles. Congress repealed the ban on
women in air combat, but ordered the commission to
study the impact of allowing women in combat roles.
