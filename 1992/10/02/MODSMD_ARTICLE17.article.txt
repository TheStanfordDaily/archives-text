## Addressing the issues 
### 
An open letter to
President Casper on
his inauguration day

FOR THE LENGTH of your
tenure at Stanford you will
be closely scrutinized and
widely criticized, particularly by
those who prefer to be left unchal
lenged and unchanged.
Your questioning lawyer's
tongue will likely draw media atten
tion when you urge the Stanford
community to open its mind, as it
did last spring when you forced us
to rethink our assumptions about
admissions and financial aid.
As you take the reins of the Uni
versity at today's inauguration,
you may feel pressured to keep any
such unconventional thoughts to
yourself.
Resist.
The greatest gift a leader can
bring to an institution like Stan
ford is the will and inclination to
reason. As the English author
Thomas Macaulay once wrote,
"Men are never so likely to settle a
question rightly as when they dis
cuss it freely."
And many questions remain
unanswered at Stanford, for
instance:
• Is a Stanford education worth
it? With tuition ever rising, and
many students' resources dispro
portionately shrinking, the Uni
hyersityv now justify its price
tag more than ever.
• How can Stanford improve it's
level of undergraduate teaching?
Many fear the increased use of
teaching assisants and the contin
uing emphasis on research are
turning American universities into
think tanks instead of educational
institutions.
• What do we mean when we
say, "multiculturalism"? The term
has been bantered about so freely
in recent years that few can agree
on a definition. Some say the issue
has been beaten to death, while

others say its surface has barely
been scratched.
• How free is speech at Stan
ford? Whether Stanford serves as a
true marketplace of ideas is oft
contested here — particularly by
those who hold more conservative
viewpoints. Recent Supreme Court
rulings portent more campus con
troversy on this subject.
• What is the extent of sexual
harassment at Stanford? And
what can be done about it? Since
the flurry of national attention
around Neurosurgery Prof. Fran
Conley's allegations of sexism in
the Medical School last year, little
more than a murmur has been
heard from the University on the
seemingly taboo topic of sexual
harassment. Revisions to the Uni
versity's harassment policy have
been a longtime in the works, yet
have produced no concrete result.
• How can the University diver
sify its faculty without sacrificing
merit-based appointments? Al
though Stanford recently admitted
its most diverse freshman class in
history, these students will be
taught by a faculty that is still
overwhelmingly white and male.
Nothing plugs up lines of com
munication as effectively as fear.
And the combination of budget
cuts and the indirect-cost contro
versy has left a legacy of intimida
tion and forced silence on the
Stanford community. Faculty
members fear for their tenure,
staff members fear "repositioning"
and students fear for their uncer
tain futures — both within and
outside the academy.
With a population so unwilling
to advance challenging ideas and
suggestions, Stanford risks finan
cial, organizational and intellectu
al stagnation.
As president of this institution,
you will not be able to provide all
the answers, but you can make
sure people don't stop asking the
questions.
And if you're afraid to rock the
boat, you might go down with the
ship.
