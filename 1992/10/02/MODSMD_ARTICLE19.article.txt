## Julie Taylor Students should form ties with advisors

Have you met
with your advisor
lately? Those of
you who are freshmen
can matter-of-factly say,
"sure, just the other
day."
However, my guess is
that most sophomores,
juniors and seniors

haven't even thought about meeting with
their advisors since returning to campus.
I'm afraid that after their first year, far
too many undergraduates fail to develop
meaningful relationships with their advi
sors.
Residence-based advising meetings
for freshmen are strategically scheduled
into the academic calendar. On cue, one
week before study lists are due, fresh
man advisors appear for special dinners
in the dining halls.
Passive participation is all that's
required from advisors and advisees to
take advantage of the arrangement. Of
course, a little personal commitment and
initiative sprinkled throughout the year
yield even better results.
Ideally, the advising relationships
established in the first year should con

tinue to develop and sustain them
selves through the sophomore year or
until students choose their majors.
This, of course, requires more personal
initiative on the parts of both advisors
and advisees than the freshman advis
ing formula and is often difficult to
achieve.
A little more outside incentive
would make this easier. I challenge all
residence staffs, and especially those in
upperclass houses, to pick up where
the freshman advising program drops
off.
Create occasions for sophomores to
meet informally with their advisors in
the residences. Give them good excuses
to spend a little time together and dis
cuss more than just four-digit approval
codes.
While every undergraduate at Stan
ford eventually chooses a major and is
assigned a departmental advisor, the
transition from one type of advising to
the other often presents simple chal
lenges that can be difficult to over
come.
For example, all professors have office
hours, but most students fail to take
advantage of these opportunities for one
on-one discussions. Students tend to
think they must have very specific rea
sons for visiting their professors, includ
ing their advisors, during their office
hours.

I encourage every student to set a goal
of visiting at least one professor during
office hours each quarter, beginning
with the fall quarter of freshman year.
This may sound like a simplistic formula
for getting to know faculty, but you've
got to start somewhere.
Too many graduating seniors com
plain that at the end of four years of
studying at Stanford, they still have not
managed to develop personal relation
ships with faculty members, including
their departmental advisors.
When you think about it, it's pretty
difficult to avoid faculty on this campus.
The faculty to student ratio is l-to-10.
More than half of the residences,
including all of those that house fresh
man, have Resident Fellows. You have
24 hour access to these folks (though I
wouldn't suggest knocking on your RF's
door at 2 a.m. to discuss the paper you're
writing).
You see them morning, noon and
night. You may even babysit their kids or
walk their dogs. You almost certainly call
them by their first names.
Their non-RF faculty colleagues are
simple people too. In fact, if you ask
around, you'll learn that many faculty
members are former RFs.
Most students would have better rela
tionships with their advisors if they just
modeled them after their friendships
with their RFs.
