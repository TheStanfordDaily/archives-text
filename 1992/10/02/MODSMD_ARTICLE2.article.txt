# Myriad of Christian icons hinders multi-faith image

The artwork in Memorial Church
— which includes mosaics of the
Last Supper and Jesus Christ wel
coming people into heaven — has
always been at odds with the non
denominational status of the church.
"The art of the building is relent
lessly Christian," said Robert Gregg,
the Dean of the Chapel. "It's Chris
tianity in your face."
Memorial Church was established
as "an interdenominational church,
and for that time — the turn of the
century — that was very forward
looking," said Jim Erps, one of the
campus ministers for the Roman
Catholic community. "But in [the
Stanfords'l minds, from their basic

Christian backgrounds, the church
would be Christian."
Although Leland and Jane Stan
ford intended the church to be open
for any religious group — and Gregg
has encouraged non-Christian
groups to use it — many members of
Stanford's religious communities
feel uncomfortable holding cere
monies in the church because of its
Christian decor.
"It would be like [Christians]
going to a Jewish synagogue for
mass. I wouldn't be offended, but it
would seem strange," Erps said.
According to Marilyn Hunwick,
the coordinator for the Stanford
Associated Ministries, the non-Chris
tian organizations in SAM — Bud
dhist, Humanist, Jewish and Muslim
— rarely use Memorial Church.

"I'd bo laughed at if I held a Jew
ish ceremony there," said Rabbi Ari
Cartun, the director of the Hillel, a
Jewish student organization. "There

are pictures of Jesus and crosses all
over the place. I would never hold a
Jewish ceremony there — the icons
make it impossible." Most Jewish
services are held in Old Union.

Gregg said he had been trying to
find space for a multi-faith center
that all groups would feel comfort
able worshipping in, but the recon
struction of the church following the
earthquake consumed most of his
time. He said he is currently making
plans for the center.
Although the church itself is used
primarily by Christian groups, sever
al non-Christian events have been
sponsored by the church.
For example, in April 1989, a Bali
nese priest gave a presentation in the
church. Later that month, the
church and the Buddhist Council of
Northern California co-sponsored
the annual Vesak festival, the com
memoration of Buddha's enlighten-
