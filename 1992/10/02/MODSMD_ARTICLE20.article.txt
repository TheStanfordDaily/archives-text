Athletics Department censorship cheats Band members

As a proud alumna of both the
Department of Athletics and the Stan
ford Band, I am in a unique position to
comment on the current controversy
regarding the halftime show last Satur
day.
The Athletics Department has always
been an island unto itself — a bastion of
fascism amid an atmosphere of liberal
education and open-mindedness.
As a member of the varsity swim
team, I was told when and what to eat,
when to study and when to practice. My
life was not my own. I was not free to
take the courses I chose lest they conflict
with the practice schedule. My doctors
advice regarding my oft-injured shoul
ders was even restructured to fit the

needs of the Department of Athletics.
My first true taste of freedom came
as a member of the Stanford Band. For
me no greater thrill existed than the
excitement and frenzied anticipation I
felt, waiting at the top of the ramp,
poised to rush down it to the sheer
delight of my peers.
I experienced no greater pressure
than while crouched in the end zone
before the start of our pre-game show —
trying to plot out exactly where to run
and how to avoid the tubas before reach
ing my assigned spot just in time to play
the first song. No greater pride at being
a Stanford student than in my tradition
al position at the top left corner of the
"A" as I listened to my fellow trumpeter

fight his nerves to complete the opening
solo in Dr. Barne's stirring rendition of
The Star Spangled Banner.
How can that thrill be denied a group
of hard-working student musicians?
How can the narrow-mindedness of a
few administrators deprive the fans of
such great entertainment? There are
those of us who remember sitting
through the dismal tenures of Paul Wig
gin and Jack Elway. The only excite
ment of the day came at halftime, when
fans scrambled to make their refresh
ment purchases in time to be re-seated
as the Band took the field!
No, I do not condone some of the
offensive tactics pulled off by the Band.
Yes, I agree that they have often lacked

originality and taste. But it is not the
place of the administrators in the Ath
letics Department to tell members of the
Band who they can and cannot make
fun of. If University President Gerhard
Casper has no sense of humor, as appar
ently the Department of Athletics does
not, then I fear for the future of my
Alma Mater.
In the pressure cooker that is Stan
ford, originality and humor are all that
keep many of us sane. Censorship has
no place at Stanford.
Let the Band Play. Let public opinion
— not the opinion of Department of
Athletics outsiders — be their guide.
