## Cardinal looks for another South Bend shocker Stanford sets sights on repeat of 1990 upset in last non-conference contest 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
After spending three comfortable Sat
urdays in Stanford Stadium, the Cardi
nal football team travels this weekend to
the heart of the nation to face the Fight
ing Irish of Notre Dame. Playing in
front of a national television audience,
Stanford gets a chance to show fans
everywhere that it belongs among the
football elite.
For those thinking that the Cardinal
has no chance against one of the coun
try's most publicized teams, one needs
only to think back to 1990, when a much
less-heralded Stanford team upset the
Irish at Notre Dame Stadium, 36-31.
Last season, Notre Dame returned the
favor here at Stanford by handing the
Cardinal a 42-26 defeat.
In that game, the Fighting Irish
scored four touchdowns in the first 25
minutes of the game and were never
seriously threatened. This year, the two
teams appear more evenly matched on
paper.
The Cardinal hopes to defuse Irish
quarterback Rick Mirer with one of the
top defenses in the country. With ten
returning starters, the defense has
allowed only one rushing touchdown
and just 123.8 yards passing per game.
Senior linebacker Dave Garnett has
confidence in his defense's ability to play
well against the Notre Dame offense.
"Having guys on your team who've been
there, being able to relate that to your
other players, we'll be able to dispel any
notion that they're invincible," he said.
Mirer hopes to lead his offense in
spoiling Stanford's defensive reputa
tion. In fact, head coach Lou Holtz's
entire backfield has returned to spark
the team to 316 yards rushing per game.
Senior tailback Reggie Brooks rushed
for 205 yards on just 15 carries in Notre

Dame's victory over Purdue last week.
The Irish passing game has struggled
a bit, with Mirer completing just 41 of
84 passes this season. Still, he has led a
team that has scored 39.8 points per
game so far.
Ranked seventh in the country in the
USA Today/CNN poll, Stanford's oppo
nent rolls into the game with a 3-0-1
record, with the tie coming at home
against Michigan three weeks ago. Last

'What we have to do is
execute and not concern
ourselves with who we're
playing or where we're
playing, if that's
possible.'
- Bill Walsh

week, the Fighting Irish thrashed the
Purdue Boilermakers 48-0 at home,
with Brooks scoring on runs of 80, 63
and 20 yards in the second half.
Not to be slighted, the Cardinal
enters the game ranked 18th in the
nation in the major polls. After its initial
loss to Texas A&M, Stanford has cruised
to three straight home victories against
largely inferior competition. The Notre
Dame game will act as a litmus test of
how far the team has developed this sea
son.
With the defense playing spectacular
ly, Stanford should be able to stay in the
game and give the offense its share of
chances. The offense has struggled at
times, especially with its ability to put
the ball in the end zone.

Last week, the Cardinal cruised to an
easy 37-13 victory, but the offense
stalled many times in the first three
quarters before scoring three late touch
downs to secure the win.
The offense's ability both to sustain
drives and finish them off is crucial for
the Cardinal to come away with a win in
South Bend. There is no question that it
has the necessary firepower to carry out
this task.
Despite five interceptions, redshirt
sophomore quarterback Steve Sten
strom has completed 78 of 129 passes
this season.
Wide receiver Justin Armour, who
made the position change from quarter
back just this season, has emerged as
Stenstrom's main target by catching 15
passes this year, most of them in the last
two games.
Armour looks forward to this game
but admits to being nervous about play

ing in South Bend against a powerful
team with an even more powerful aura.
"I'll be anxious to see how I respond," he
said. "When you've grown up watching
college football on television, watching
Notre Dame, you're just kind of in awe
of it. To go back there and go on that
field and do something is exciting. Real
ly exciting."
Senior tailback Glyn Milburn stands
as one of the most dangerous backs in
the country. Returning kicks and punts,
catching passes, and breaking long runs,
Milburn does everything when he gets
the chance.
As usual, Holtz has been building up
his opponent in order to whip his team
into a fury. His latest claim is that the
Cardinal should actually be ranked fifth
in the country because Stanford played
better than Texas A&M in the Pigskin
Classic.
He also paid homage to Stanford head

coach Bill Walsh, joking about his con
versations with Walsh the television
commentator.
"Last year I used to spend an hour on
Fridays before home games talking
about our team with Bill Walsh and the
NBC crew," he said. "So I'm assuming
that Bill will give me the same amount
of time this week so I can ask him about
his team."
Walsh insists on his team keeping an
even keel tomorrow, downplaying the
mythical nature of Notre Dame's repu
tation. "What we have to do is execute
and not concern ourselves with who
we're playing or where we're playing, if
that's possible," he said. "I don't think
we'll come unraveled."
Given the nature of the game, one of
Walsh's most crucial responsibilities is
psychological. If he succeeds in main
taining his team's level-headedness,
look for a great game tomorrow.

week, the Fighting Irish thrashed the
Purdue Boilermakers 48-0 at home,
with Brooks scoring on runs of 80, 63
and 20 yards in the second half.
Not to be slighted, the Cardinal
enters the game ranked 18th in the
nation in the major polls. After its initial
loss to Texas A&M, Stanford has cruised
to three straight home victories against
largely inferior competition. The Notre
Dame game will act as a litmus test of
how far the team has developed this sea
son.
With the defense playing spectacular
ly, Stanford should be able to stay in the
game and give the offense its share of
chances. The offense has struggled at
times, especially with its ability to put
the ball in the end zone.

Last week, the Cardinal cruised to an
easy 37-13 victory, but the offense
stalled many times in the first three
quarters before scoring three late touch
downs to secure the win.
The offense's ability both to sustain
drives and finish them off is crucial for
the Cardinal to come away with a win in
South Bend. There is no question that it
has the necessary firepower to carry out
this task.
Despite five interceptions, redshirt
sophomore quarterback Steve Sten
strom has completed 78 of 129 passes
this season.
Wide receiver Justin Armour, who
made the position change from quarter
back just this season, has emerged as
Stenstrom's main target by catching 15
passes this year, most of them in the last
two games.
Armour looks forward to this game
but admits to being nervous about play

ing in South Bend against a powerful
team with an even more powerful aura.
"I'll be anxious to see how I respond," he
said. "When you've grown up watching
college football on television, watching
Notre Dame, you're just kind of in awe
of it. To go back there and go on that
field and do something is exciting. Real
ly exciting."
Senior tailback Glyn Milburn stands
as one of the most dangerous backs in
the country. Returning kicks and punts,
catching passes, and breaking long runs,
Milburn does everything when he gets
the chance.
As usual, Holtz has been building up
his opponent in order to whip his team
into a fury. His latest claim is that the
Cardinal should actually be ranked fifth
in the country because Stanford played
better than Texas A&M in the Pigskin
Classic.
He also paid homage to Stanford head

coach Bill Walsh, joking about his con
versations with Walsh the television
commentator.
"Last year I used to spend an hour on
Fridays before home games talking
about our team with Bill Walsh and the
NBC crew," he said. "So I'm assuming
that Bill will give me the same amount
of time this week so I can ask him about
his team."
Walsh insists on his team keeping an
even keel tomorrow, downplaying the
mythical nature of Notre Dame's repu
tation. "What we have to do is execute
and not concern ourselves with who
we're playing or where we're playing, if
that's possible," he said. "I don't think
we'll come unraveled."
Given the nature of the game, one of
Walsh's most crucial responsibilities is
psychological. If he succeeds in main
taining his team's level-headedness,
look for a great game tomorrow.

Quarterback Steve Stenstrom gets rid of the ball under pressure. He and his teammates hope to continue their winning ways
in South Bend tomorrow at 10:30 A.M.
After spending three comfortable Sat
urdays in Stanford Stadium, the Cardi
nal football team travels this weekend to
the heart of the nation to face the Fight
ing Irish of Notre Dame. Playing in
front of a national television audience,
Stanford gets a chance to show fans
everywhere that it belongs among the
football elite.
For those thinking that the Cardinal
has no chance against one of the coun
try's most publicized teams, one needs
only to think back to 1990, when a much
less-heralded Stanford team upset the
Irish at Notre Dame Stadium, 36-31.
Last season, Notre Dame returned the
favor here at Stanford by handing the
Cardinal a 42-26 defeat.
In that game, the Fighting Irish
scored four touchdowns in the first 25
minutes of the game and were never
seriously threatened. This year, the two
teams appear more evenly matched on
paper.
The Cardinal hopes to defuse Irish
quarterback Rick Mirer with one of the
top defenses in the country. With ten
returning starters, the defense has
allowed only one rushing touchdown
and just 123.8 yards passing per game.
Senior linebacker Dave Garnett has
confidence in his defense's ability to play
well against the Notre Dame offense.
"Having guys on your team who've been
there, being able to relate that to your
other players, we'll be able to dispel any
notion that they're invincible," he said.
Mirer hopes to lead his offense in
spoiling Stanford's defensive reputa
tion. In fact, head coach Lou Holtz's
entire backfield has returned to spark
the team to 316 yards rushing per game.
Senior tailback Reggie Brooks rushed
for 205 yards on just 15 carries in Notre

Dame's victory over Purdue last week.
The Irish passing game has struggled
a bit, with Mirer completing just 41 of
84 passes this season. Still, he has led a
team that has scored 39.8 points per
game so far.
Ranked seventh in the country in the
USA Today/CNN poll, Stanford's oppo
nent rolls into the game with a 3-0-1
