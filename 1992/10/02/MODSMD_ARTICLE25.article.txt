TOMORROW - 10:30 A.M. at Notre Dame.
NOTES — Cardinal Notes: Stanford (3-1, ranked No 18) is coming off of three relatively easy
home victories over Oregon, Northwestern, and San Jose State after dropping its opener to
Texas A&M. The Cardinal's powerful, nationally-rated defense, as led by Ail-American
linebacker candidate Ron George, hopes to give quarterback Steve Stenstrom, running
back Glyn Milburn, and a sputtering offense enough possessions to do some damage to the
unbeaten Irish.
Fighting Irish Notes:Notre Dame (3-0-1, ranked No. 6) shellacked Purdue 48-0 last week
after a lackluster performance in a tie with Michigan the week before. The Irish, winners of
46 games over the last five seasons, are tough on both sides of the ball, with an offense that
features senior quarterback Rick Mirer and running back Jerome Bettis and a defense that
spotlights linebacker Butkus Award nominee Demetrius Dußose.
Radio and Television:The game can be heard on KZSU (90 1 FM) with pregame coverage
at 10:00 A.M. Jamie Zaninovich and Scott Walker make the calls.
NBC-TV (Channel 4) will also carry the game as part of its "Notre Dame Saturday"
at 10:30 A.M.
