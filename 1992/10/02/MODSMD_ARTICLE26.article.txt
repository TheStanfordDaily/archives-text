# Booters prepare for big home tourney
## Bank of America Invitational brings East Coast flavor to Stanford 
### Brian Egan Editorial staff 
With the football and women's soccer teams at
Notre Dame, Stanford men's soccer dominates the
home athletic slate this weekend as it hosts the
Bank of America Invitational at Maloney Field.
The Cardinal (6-2-0) enters its own tourney with
its highest national ranking (No. 19) in 13 years.
"We've been playing a nice brand of soccer this sea
son," said coach Colin Lindores. "This year's group
has a little more depth than last year's did."
This is good news for Stanford — last season's
group was the first Cardinal men's soccer squad
since 1979 to qualify for the NCAA Tournament.
Once again, the NCAA's loom in the future for
the Cardinal. "We just want to go one step further
this year," said Lindores. With games scheduled
against George Washington University and the
University of South Florida, the Bank of America
Invitational should provide Stanford with a good
reading of just how realistic that goal is.
The Colonials (4-1-4) are unbeaten in their last
six contests, a streak that includes a 0-0 tie against
No. 13 George Mason. A member of the Atlantic 10
Conference, George Washington features two of the
league's top offensive weapons in Steve Master and
Marcelo Valencia.
Master, a junior forward, leads the Atlantic 10 in
scoring, putting in seven goals and an assist in nine
games. "Player-wise, I don't know a lot about
(George Washington!," said Lindores. "I do know
that (Masters] can play, though."
With two goals and six assists (10 points) Valen
cia is not far behind Masters. In 1991, the sopho
more midfielder was named first team All-Atlantic
10. Last week, Valencia received Conference Player
of the Week honors for his efforts against St.
Joseph's and Howard.
Like George Washington, South Florida (5-2-0)
is on the verge of breaking into the national rank
ings. The Bulls, Metro Conference champions in
1991, ride a four game winning streak into the
tournament.
Meanwhile, Stanford's play, while somewhat
sporadic, has been impressive overall. The squad
captured the title at the St. Mary's Invitational last
weekend with 3-0 wins over both Maryland-Balti
more County and Northern Illinois.
The senior-dominated lineup is led by co-cap
tains Kyle Krpata and Randy Mann. Krpata has
recorded shutouts in three out of his last four
games, lowering his goals against average to 1.29

per game in the process.
Mann has been a force at the
midfield position all year, chip
ping in a goal and two assists on
offense thus far.
Jason Vanacour leads the
Cardinal attack with five goals
and an assist.
Lindores expects every match

of the tournament to be closely
contested. "All of the teams in
the tournament (the Dons of San
Francisco are the fourth squad)
are entertaining, technical
teams. We should see some real
ly close games this weekend."
As for the rest of 1992?
"The way we play this week
end will give us a good idea of
what kind of team we are," said
the coach. "We don't have the
ability to put people away, but
we have a good group."
