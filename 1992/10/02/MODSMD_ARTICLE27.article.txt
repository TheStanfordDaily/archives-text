# Women hit road, also take on Irish
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
So far this season, the Stan
ford women's soccer team's
matches have served primarily
as warm-up scrimmages. But
now the 7-0 Cardinal faces four
top-20 squads in its next five
games, starting with Central
Florida and Notre Dame this
weekend.
Stanford coach Berhane
Andeberhan expects tough
matches from both teams.
"I wouldn't be surprised if
they tried to turn it into a phys
ical battle," he said of No. 13
Central Florida, whom the Car
dinal meets today. "And if they
did, our players wouldn't get
upset that it wasn't as artistic a
game as they'd like. They'd just
play."
Andeberhan also anticipates
a rough match from No. 20
Notre Dame. The Fightin' Irish
(4-3-1) will be aided by fresh
man Ragen Coyne, a midfielder
Andeberhan recruited last year.
Stanford is the third straight
top-20 squad Notre Dame has
played â€” the Irish lost to No. 15
Duke and No. 4 Portland.
Central Florida (4-1) is also
trying to bounce back from
defeat. Last week, the Lady
Knights were upset by Lynn
College and will likely depend on
nine returning starters to lead
the way against the Cardinal.
Two of their key players are
Kelly Kochevar and Tiffany
Schreiner, who combined to
score half of the Knight's 50
goals last year.
Central Florida's two new
faces are at fullback and the
young defense will be responsi
ble for containing Stanford's
scoring trio of Dena Dey, Sarah
Rafanelli, and Julie Foudv.

Dey leads the team in scoring
with seven goals and five assists.
The freshman has had at least a
goal or an assist in every game
this year. Rafanelli, who has led
the team in scoring each of her
two seasons, is second on the
team in scoring with six goals
and five assists. Foudy's two
scores against Hayward raised
her season total to five.
"In terms of key players, we
have more game-breakers," said
Andeberhan, who also helped
give the Cardinal the edge in
technical skills.
But a victory is by no means
assured. "We still have a long
way to go before we play the way
we want to play," Andeberhan
said.
The squad is working on inte
grating three systems of play so
the team can adapt to different
situations on the field and be
less predictable.
Andeberhan employs a basic
setup of three fullbacks, four
midfielders and two forwards
Depending on the squad's
needs, another fullback, mid
fielder or forward is utilized.
For example, when Stanford
faced Colorado College in the
NCAA's last year, Andeberhan
wanted the Cardinal to control
the midfield. Therefore, he
played five midfielders to
match up to Colorado's five
halfbacks.
Later in the game, Stanford's
fullbacks began to tire and he
switched to a four-back system.
Andeberhan believes the
1992 contingent can master the
complex setups. "This is the
best team I've had at being able
to focus on the details and not
the results." he said.
This weekend's roadtrip will
likely be a good gauge of the
Cardinal's progress.
