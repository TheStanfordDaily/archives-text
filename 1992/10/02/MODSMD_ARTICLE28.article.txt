# Spikers face USC, UCLA in Pac-10 home openers
## Take on No. 6, No. 1 in biggest weekend to date 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
When No. 6 USC and No. 1
UCLA come to town this Friday
and Saturday to face the second
ranked Stanford women's volley
ball team, it won't be for a berth
in the Final Four, although for
most Cardinal fans it might as
well be.
The Cardinal (8-0, 2-0 in
Pacific 10 Conference play)
heads in to what Stanford head
coach Don Shaw calls "the
toughest weekend of volleyball
this year" when it hosts the
defending national champion
Bruins and up-and-coming USC.
But for fans who think the Car
dinal is looking ahead to Satur
day's showdown with UCLA with
revenge on their minds, think
again.
"We're not looking ahead (to
UCLA) at all," Shaw said. "Right
now, we're concerned with USC.
They're a team on the verge of
being in that upper echelon with
the best of them."
More concerned with No. 6
than the top-ranked Bruins? The
team that ended Stanford's
hopes for a national title in 1991
by defeating them in the NCAA
Western Regional?
"These rankings don't mean
anything to me," explained
Shaw. "All these teams have yet
to prove themselves in competi
tion. It's way too early to tell if
any of these teams are better or
worse than each other. The only
place to find that out is on the
court."
Stanford played both USC and
UCLA in the NCAA tournament
last year, and while the Cardinal

looks to avenge its defeat to the
Bruins, a similarly-motivated
USC team will look to do some
avenging of their own against the
Cardinal, who defeated the Lady
Trojans in the second round of
the NCAA tournament last year.

'These rankings
don't mean anything
to me.These teams
have to prove them
selves in competition.
— Don Shaw

"We expect them (USC) to be
fired up," Shaw said. "When the
media gives you this No. 2 rank
ing, they expect you to beat every
team but UCLA, so obviously
USC will want us. It's up to us to
respond to the pressure and
prove to ourselves that we're
serious contenders for the
(national) championship."
Stanford sends a talented
team with playoff experience into
this weekend's games, but the
Cardinal will also be looking to
its bench to help swing the
match in its favor.
"We have four freshmen this
year who are filling the gap
where we need it this year," said
Shaw. "For most of them, it's a
big jump from high school (vol
leyball) to the college level, but
most of them are getting the job
done for us."
Freshman Cary Wendell was
one of the standouts last week

against Oregon State, registering
14 kills and seven digs against
the Beavers.
Shaw added that the names
have changed from last year's
squad, but the intensity is still
there. "The will to win is similar
this year. We've always been able
to battle back in the big games
and win, and that's a big boost
for the team's attitude."
If Stanford should sweep this
weekend against the Los Angeles
teams, it might find itself atop
the rankings again, the spot it
occupied the entire regular sea
son in 1991. But perhaps what's
more important to Coach Shaw is
not what the matches will prove
in the rankings, but what they
will prove to his players them
selves.
"There's no tougher order
than to play No. 6 and No. 1
back-to-back," Shaw said. "It's a
stiff test, but we hope to find out
where we match up against some
very fine teams. We'll put up a
fight, I can guarantee you that."
Or maybe more like a war.

squad, but the intensity is still
there. "The will to win is similar
this year. We've always been able
to battle back in the big games
and win, and that's a big boost
for the team's attitude."
If Stanford should sweep this
weekend against the Los Angeles
teams, it might find itself atop
the rankings again, the spot it
occupied the entire regular sea
son in 1991. But perhaps what's
more important to Coach Shaw is
not what the matches will prove
in the rankings, but what they
will prove to his players them
selves.
"There's no tougher order
than to play No. 6 and No. 1
back-to-back," Shaw said. "It's a
stiff test, but we hope to find out
where we match up against some
very fine teams. We'll put up a
fight, I can guarantee you that."
Or maybe more like a war.
