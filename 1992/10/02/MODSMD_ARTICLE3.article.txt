Billionaire businessman
Ross Perot announced yes
terday a dramatic re-entry
into the presidential race.
Flanked by his now-perma
nent running mate, retired
Vice Admiral James Stock
dale, a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution,
Perot told supporters that
"government is a mess" and
vowed to repair it.

Perot made the announcement in Dallas just 33
days before the election, painting himself as a servant
of the volunteers who put his name on the ballot in all
50 states.
"The volunteers . . . have asked me to run for pres
ident of the United States," Perot said. "Jim Stock
dale and I are honored to accept their request."
Perot said he was joining the race because "neither
political party has effectively addressed" economic and
other concerns that are on the minds of the voters.
"We gave them a chance and they didn't do it,"
Perot said of rivals President Bush and Democratic
nominee Bill Clinton.
A strong friendship
Stockdale, 68, first tapped by Perot to be an "inter
im" running mate in March — because some states
require the names of both candidates to get a place on
the ballot — yesterday joined Perot as his official vice
presidential candidate.
"I have a personal reputation for being independent


Stockdale
in outlook and manner, so this role
gives me added satisfaction,"
Stockdale said yesterday.
The candidates share a strong
friendship that can be traced to
Stockdale's eight years as a prison
er of war in North Vietnam, when
he was forced to spend time in soli
tary confinement, shackled in leg
irons.
While Stockdale was in captivi
ty, his wife, Sybil, persuaded Perot
to try to get North Vietnam to con
form to Geneva Convention rules
of humane treatment of prisoners.
"He's been a close friend of mine
ever since," Stockdale said in
March.

John Bunzel, a senior research
fellow at Hoover, said Perot select
ed Stockdale because of their close
relationship.
"Jim was a man he knew, he
liked and he felt could support
him," Bunzel said. "And he didn't
want to go through a search for the
normal politician."
Bunzel, who has known Stock
dale for 11 years, said the former
vice admiral esteems Perot in
return. "He is a very strong admir
er and is a follower of a man he
enormously respects," Bunzel
said. "Stockdale believes Ross
Perot stands for the kinds of
things that need to be spoken for."
In March, Stockdale took posi
tions on controversial issues that
were in line with Perot's beliefs.
He said at the time that he was
pro-choice and "not opposed" to

gun control.
"Once the American people get
to know Stockdale they're going to
see a man of real integrity and
character," said Hoover Senior
Research Fellow Martin Anderson.
"They're going to like him a lot."
A dramatic entry
Stockdale, who flew back to the
Bay Area last night, is expected to
spend the coming weeks cam
paigning for the ticket.
Betty Potts, a regional assistant
for Perot's California campaign,
expects Stockdale to make several
appearances in California. "But
you're not going to see him play
the same role as a Quayle or a
Gore," she said.
"He adds to the trust factor. He
gives the ticket some balance and
maturity," Potts said.

Perot and Stockdale's dramatic
entry invigorates a race that has
'Once the American
people get to know
Stockdale, they're
going to see a man of
rea[ integrity and
character.'
— Martin Anderson
been stagnant for more than a
month, with Clinton enjoying a
comfortable lead over Bush. Ana
lysts give Perot little chance of win
ning, but say he could significantly

affect the races in several critical
states, including his native Texas.
"The effects will be felt very dif
ferently in different states,"
explained Bunzel. "I venture to
suggest ... the more votes Perot
gets, the more it hurts Clinton."
With a personal fortune at his
disposal, Perot is not subject to the
spending limits agreed to by Clin
ton and Bush. Even in advance of
his announcement yesterday,
Perot had been inquiring about
buying network television time.
Man of steel
During his imprisonment,
Stockdale organized resistance
among fellow prisoners and spent
four years in solitary confinement.
He led the first bombing attack
against North Vietnam in 1964
and was shot down and captured a

year later. He became the highest
ranking prisoner of war.
Stockdale was awarded the
Medal of Honor and 26 other com
bat decorations.
Perot described his running
mate as "a man of steel" who has
been "hammered on the forge of
brutality."
In 1979, he left to Navy to
become president of the Citadel, a
military college in South Carolina.
Stockdale, who spent two years
as a Stanford undergraduate
before beginning a 37-year Navy
career, returned to the University
in 1981 with an appointment at
Hoover. He has also served as a lec
turer in the philosophy depart
ment.
His current research at Hoover
deals with moral leadership and
moral equivalencies in war.
