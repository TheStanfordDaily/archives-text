Billionaire businessman
Ross Perot announced yes
terday a dramatic re-entry
into the presidential race.
Flanked by his now-perma
nent running mate, retired
Vice Admiral James Stock
dale, a senior research fellow
at the Hoover Institution,
Perot told supporters that
"government is a mess" and
vowed to repair it.

Perot made the announcement in Dallas just 33
days before the election, painting himself as a servant
of the volunteers who put his name on the ballot in all
50 states.
"The volunteers . . . have asked me to run for pres
ident of the United States," Perot said. "Jim Stock
dale and I are honored to accept their request."
Perot said he was joining the race because "neither
political party has effectively addressed" economic and
other concerns that are on the minds of the voters.
"We gave them a chance and they didn't do it,"
Perot said of rivals President Bush and Democratic
nominee Bill Clinton.
A strong friendship
Stockdale, 68, first tapped by Perot to be an "inter
im" running mate in March — because some states
require the names of both candidates to get a place on
the ballot — yesterday joined Perot as his official vice
presidential candidate.
"I have a personal reputation for being independent
