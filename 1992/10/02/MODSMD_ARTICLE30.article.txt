# Water polo to challenge top-flight field in NorCal Tourney
## 
### Sam Wu 
Like swimming, tennis, and women's
basketball, water polo has no surprises to
report: the Stanford squad enters a week
end when it can mount a serious push for
a seventh national title.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal and other
national water polo powerhouses will com
pete in the NorCal Tournament hosted by
Stanford today, tomorrow, and Sunday.
With many clashes scheduled between
top-ranked teams, the event will establish
seedings for the NCAA championship

tournament. Second-ranked Pepperdine,
third-ranked USC, and fifth-ranked UC-
Irvine look to thwart the Cardinal's
charge to higher status, as do No. 7 UC-
Santa Barbara, No. 11 Fresno State, and
No. 13 Air Force.
"We want to win the NCAA champi
onship, but it's hard to do if we're ranked
fourth," Stanford head coach Dante Det
tamanti said. So the message he gives to
his players is simple: win all their matches
so they climb in the polls.
Dettamanti believes his squad can
defeat all comers, particularly No. 2 Pep

perdine. He notes that Stanford's only loss
this season — to Pepperdine — was by
only one point, and argues, "We played
one of our worst games yet against them."
Furthermore, the Cardinal has already
blasted UC-Irvine, UC-Santa Barbara,
and Air Force in earlier encounters. The
closest contest was the UC-Irvine match,
in which Stanford doubled the Anteaters'
score, winning eight to four.
To prepare for the upcoming confronta
tions, Dettamanti prescribes rest. The six
matches-in-three-days schedule is rigor
ous, not to mention the fact that Stanford

began two-a-day practices back on Aug. 4.
Dettamanti even cancelled last Sunday's
training session to give players such as
sophomore Ail-American candidate and
team scoring leader Wolf Wigo a much
needed day ofT.
Too much rest, however, maybe the
only factor hindering the Cardinal.
Junior All-American goaltender Larry
Bercutt went down with an eye abrasion a
week ago against Pacific. According to Det
tamanti, trainers have not indicated
whether or not Bercutt will be able to com
pete this weekend. In addition, sophomore

second-string goalie Jack Bowen cannot
play due to an elbow operation that is keep
ing him out for the year. This leaves junior
third-stringer Zach Gallagher in goal.
"But Gallagher has played in games
since spring," Dettamanti said. Indeed,
Gallagher has been busy, recording saves
in five of the Cardinal's seven matches
thus far.
Still, although Dettamanti feels that
Gallagher has stepped up to the challenge,
he acknowledges that it is hard to replace
a goalie like Bercutt, whom he considers
the best in the country.
