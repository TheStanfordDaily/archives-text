# Jackson joins Greeks in crazy pigskin pick 'em
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
'Greeks'?" The question comes
each and every year. The answer
is simple. Should we call our
selves "Slavs" or "Croats"? Obvi
ously not. The Greeks are the
only Balkan country stable
enough to use year after year
after year.
Just the word "Greek" is
enough to connote the brave,
marauding, feckless forces that
we are.
No prediction too bold. No
lame intro too long. No action
too grandiose. Except for
Cyprus games. We hate Cyprus
games.
This year's crack staff of
Greeks consists of more than a
few people who take this whole
sports/statistics thing way too
seriously, including the "Dan
gerous" dean of students,
Michael Jackson.
People who always go for the
orange space in Trivial Pursuit
and whine when they get a ques
tion about alcohol. People who
don't get out enough.
So, the lesson remains — in
strict Aristotelian fashion —
know the game, know the spread,
but don't memorize the sweaty
guys' numbers. And never take
them to Pudley's.

Big, sweaty men fighting over
a small, leather-clad pointed
ellipse.
Barely veiled homoerotic
phrases like "tight end" and
"Wetnight." What could be more
American.
That's why we, the Greeks,
are here.
We must guide you through
this morass of beer and take-out
that has become the favorite pas
time of this country.
How else are you going to be
able to impress that little honey
or honess without being able to
predict confidently the score of
this week's big Oregon State
game?
The wall between love and
sports isn't as thick or stupid as
one might think. Just consider all
the campus athletes with girl
friends or boyfriends. Makes you
wonder.
Just the phrase "uprights" is
often enough to make a boring
evening a night of excitement
and mystery. Just ask John Mad
den. Or Kathy Lee for that mat
ter.

'Greeks'?" The question comes
each and every year. The answer
is simple. Should we call our
selves "Slavs" or "Croats"? Obvi
ously not. The Greeks are the
only Balkan country stable
enough to use year after year
after year.
Just the word "Greek" is
enough to connote the brave,
marauding, feckless forces that
we are.
No prediction too bold. No
lame intro too long. No action
too grandiose. Except for
Cyprus games. We hate Cyprus
games.
This year's crack staff of
Greeks consists of more than a
few people who take this whole
sports/statistics thing way too
seriously, including the "Dan
gerous" dean of students,
Michael Jackson.
People who always go for the
orange space in Trivial Pursuit
and whine when they get a ques
tion about alcohol. People who
don't get out enough.
So, the lesson remains — in
strict Aristotelian fashion —
know the game, know the spread,
but don't memorize the sweaty
guys' numbers. And never take
them to Pudley's.

Big, sweaty men fighting over
a small, leather-clad pointed
ellipse.
Barely veiled homoerotic
phrases like "tight end" and
"Wetnight." What could be more
American.
That's why we, the Greeks,
are here.
We must guide you through
this morass of beer and take-out
that has become the favorite pas
time of this country.
How else are you going to be
able to impress that little honey
or honess without being able to
predict confidently the score of
this week's big Oregon State
game?
The wall between love and
sports isn't as thick or stupid as
one might think. Just consider all
the campus athletes with girl
friends or boyfriends. Makes you
wonder.
Just the phrase "uprights" is
often enough to make a boring
evening a night of excitement
and mystery. Just ask John Mad
den. Or Kathy Lee for that mat
ter.
