Stanford men's and women's cross coun
try teams kick into high gear this Saturday
on the golf course at the Stanford Invitation
al, described by new head coach Vin Lananna
as "one of the premier cross country events"
in the nation.
The meet begins at noon with the local
high school men's and women's 3- and 5-kilo
meter races, respectively. At 4 p.m., the
starting gun sounds for the university level
women's open race, followed at 4:30 p.m. by
the women's invitational race. At 5 p.m., the
men's open race will begin, followed at 5:30
p.m. by the men's invitational.
The Cardinal women are fresh off of last
weekend's win at the Fresno Pacific Tourna
ment, but expect much tougher competition
tomorrow.
Included in the women's invitational
bracket are UC-Irvine, Brigham Young, and

Arizona, all of which are ranked in the top 15
in the country, as well as No. 2 ranked
Arkansas, which is looking to replace Vil
lanova as the nation's top squad with a
strong showing in this weekend's 5-kilometer
race.
Stanford's young team includes Laura
Heyward and Bennie Dehlendorf, two fresh
men, and Kay Luo, a sophomore, who were
among the Cardinal's top five finishers last
weekend. The team is led by junior team cap
tain Sarah Truitt and junior transfer student
Louise Watson, winner of last weekend's
race.
The Cardinal men emerged victorious last
weekend at Fresno but will be faced with
much stiffer competition this weekend. Pre
sent in the men's invitational are Pacific 10
Conference rival Arizona and BYU, ranked
third and twelfth, respectively. The men are
paced by seniors Gary Stolz, Todd Lewis, and
Mike Reilly, as well as junior Brian McCaf

fery and freshman Rob Reeder.
All four college races begin at the second
tee on the Stanford golf course. The men's
course, which is eight kilometers long, heads
straight for the ninth, tenth and eleventh
holes. It then winds up and down a hill,
under an overpass, and back to the second tee
and the finish line. The Women's course
begins at the second tee as well, but is three
kilometers shorter.
Stanford has seven runners entered in
both the open and invitational categories for
the men and women. The places of the top
five runners for each team in each race are
added up and the team with the lowest score
wins the race.
"The (Stanford Cross Country Invitation
al] this Saturday presents a great opportuni
ty for the community to see the rebuilding
process" currently in progress for the Cardi
nal cross country program, said coach
Lananna.
