# Wedding bells ring once more

More than 100 messages were waiting on Betsy
Koester's voice mail when she came back to her job
in August.
Evidently, none of the callers had been deterred
by the Memorial Church wedding coordinator's less
than-encouraging voice mail message, laying out the
guidelines for weddings in the church.
"One of the parties to be married must have a
Stanford connection," it said, meaning being a cur
rent or graduated student, a faculty or staff mem
ber, or a child of a student or staff member.
The cost: $700 for an enrolled student, and $1,000
for anyone else. That's not including the clergy and the
music. And you have to be out of there in two hours.

'The light that comes in from the
Quad as the bride enters
silhouettes her.'
— Diana Akiyama

. Yet the appeal of Memorial Church is such that one
man, whose wedding had been scheduled before the
1989 earthquake, was willing to wait the three years
for the church to be reconstructed to get married.
"It was quite an act of faith," Koester said, espe
cially since it was possible that the church would not
be finished for another five years.
Five weddings were supposed to take place the
weekend after the earthquake hit, Koester said.
Four of them were held in different locations; one
was simply moved into a tent in the quad.
The other 150 weddings already scheduled at the

time of the earthquake were also moved. Koester
said people were "extremely disappointed" because
the church looked intact from the outside. "They
couldn't grasp the amount of damage that had been
done in there," she said.
More than 100 weddings have already been
scheduled by Koester. The first few — there are
often Five weddings per weekend — are slated for the
weekend of Oct. 10.
For people connected to Stanford, the reason for
marrying in Memorial Church is simple: "Just
because it's Stanford," said Betty Anderson, class of
'47, who married former Stanford trustee Roy
Anderson, class of '48, in the church in 1948.
That day, there were six other weddings sched
uled, and "we had to share the flowers," Anderson
said.
Anderson said it was raining that day, but as soon
as she and her groom finished their vows, "the rain
stopped and the sun shone through all the (stained
glass) windows, lighting up the whole church."
Weddings in the church are also especially dra
matic because "the light that comes in from the
quad as the bride enters silhouettes her," said Diana
Akiyama, an associate dean of the church who has
officiated a number of weddings.
There are about 200 weddings performed in
Memorial Church each year, ranging from small cer
emonies to some attended by more than 500 guests.
Despite the church's Christian decor, people of
every major religion have had their weddings there,
Koester said.
The bride and groom may decorate the church
any way they like, though most prefer the church
unadorned. Koester said Jewish couples sometimes
bring or even build a huppa — a type of tent that the
bride and groom stand under — in the church.
One person — whom Koester called "very ecolo
gy" — even brought in a potted redwood tree to
stand by the altar rather than a floral arrangement.
