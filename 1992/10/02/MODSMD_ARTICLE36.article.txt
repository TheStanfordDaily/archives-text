ASSU administrative assis
tant Enda Hu resigned Wednes
day citing personal reasons.
"It is not related to the ASSU
whatsoever," Hu said.
Junior Steven Craig, Hu's for
mer assistant, will serve as act
ing administrative assistant
until the ASSU approves a
replacement.
Senate Chair Ron Brown said
that he will present a bill at the

first ASSU meeting Wednesday
to create a search for a replace
ment.
He said the position will be
open to the entire student body
and Craig will be eligible to
apply.
According to Brown, the
administrative assistant is
responsible for overseeing ASSU
projects, especially service ones,
and for taking care of the office.
"It's pretty significant,"
Brown said. "We'll definitely
miss |Hu] at that position."
