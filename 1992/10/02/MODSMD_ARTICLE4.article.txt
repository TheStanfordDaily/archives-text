Stanford Policc arrested six UC-Berkeley students
Tuesday night for allegedly stealing a vacuum clean
er and fire extinguisher from the Enchanted Broccoli
Forest, according to Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The suspects — one Alpha Delta Phi member and
five pledges — said they had taken the items from the
Stanford cooperative as part of fraternity rush,
Niemeyer said.
Thev also removed a display case from the front of
a ticket box office at Stanford Stadium, he said.
"Their mission was to come down to Stanford and
take photos and property."
After arriving on campus, Niemeyer said, the stu
dents apparently entered EBF and took photographs
proving they had been there. The co-op was formerly
home to Stanford's Alpha Delt chapter.
Then they moved on to the stadium, he said, and
"that was their undoing."
A suspicious security guard pulled the group over
across from the Stanford Shopping Center and
arrested them for possession of stolen property at
about 10:40 p.m..
The men decided to cooperate and "told us the
whole story," Niemeyer said. The two vehicles they
arrived in were impounded while the suspects were
"photographed and interrogated," he added.
Because charges are still pending, Niemeyer said he
could not release the names of the suspects. He said
the police typically seek misdemeanor charges such as
vandalism and theft in similar cases, but noted that
the District Attorney's office will make the decision.
The sentence for a misdemeanor can be up to a
$1,000 fine and a year in jail. Niemeyer said, howev
er, that community service and a fine is the more
common penalty.
EBF resident Norman Waters, a graduate student,
called the alleged thefts "quite juvenile."
"If they got arrested, they got what they
deserved," he said.
Ron Espinoza, president of UC-Berkelev's Alpha
Delt chapter, said he has no comment on the arrests.
