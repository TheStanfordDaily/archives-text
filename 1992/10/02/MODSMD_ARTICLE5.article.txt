# Search for multicultural educator, ethnic dean still on
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
As classes begin and Stanford's
ethnic communities begin plan
ning the upcoming year's pro
grams, searches continue for a
new multicultural educator and a
director of the Black Community
Services Center.
Two search committees of fac
ulty, staff and students have been
formed to select people for each
position, Dean of Students
Michael Jackson said, adding that
education and experience would
be criteria in the search process.
Each committee should make its
choice by the end of fall quarter,
he said.
The position of multicultural
educator was vacated May 12

when Greg Ricks resigned to take
a job as vice president for educa
tion and training at City Year, a
non-profit "urban peace corps."
The committee searching for
Kicks' successor is now reading
about 140 applications and hopes
to reduce that number to 10 or 15
by the middle of this month, said
Assoc. Dir. of Residential Educa
tion Ann Porteus, who is also a
member of the search committee.
Phone interviews will be con
ducted with that group and even
tually about a half-dozen finalists
will be brought to campus and
interviewed, Porteus said.
Until the committee selects
Ricks' successor, Res Ed will
remain without a multicultural
educator, she said.
Barbara Smith, acting director

of the BCSC, said that whoever
takes over as multicultural educa
tor "will both enhance the com
munity centers and the Universi
ty as a whole."
Smith also said she is looking
forward to working with a new
BCSC director who has "new ideas
and different perspectives We did
go through a pretty tough time but
I also feel that by going through
that we have learned and healed."
Smith has served as acting
director since Keith Archuleta
resigned June 2 after being
arrested for secretly videotaping
women during photography ses
sions in his apartment.
Archuleta was sentenced to
four years of probation and 200
hours of community service in
June after pleading no contest to

two misdemeanor counts of elec
tronic eavesdropping.
According to Jackson, the com
mittee to choose the director of
the BCSC has received about 80
applications for the position.
John Baugh, chair of the
search committee, said the person
who fills it will have to be experi
enced, service-oriented and flexi
ble.
"We need someone who on the
one hand can talk to the president
or board of trustees, and on the
other interact informally with
students," he said.
The director of the center has a
key role in "supporting students
on campus as well as offering
bridges to the African-American
community off-campus," said
Baugh. "We're not setting up a

list or putting people in baskets.
We're looking at experience first,"
he added.
Smith said Archuleta's resig
nation has not affected the day-to
day running of the center because
she had handled a lot of adminis
trative duties as his assistant .
However, Smith added that
Archuleta's work should not be
forgotten. "Keith contributed a
hell of a lot â€” not just to the black
community but to the Stanford
community and the surrounding
community," she said.
Jackson said he is looking for
ward to the future and he is "con
fident we will be able to find two
great people to fill these spots.
Clearly we miss the folks, but it's
also clear we have a lot to go
ahead with "
