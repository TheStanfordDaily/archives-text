# Existing spouse policy denies domestic partners benefits
## 
### Grace Lee Editorial staff 
Linguistics Prof. Joan Bresnan consid
ers herself a private person. But recently
she found herself spilling out the details
of her personal relationship to total
strangers at Green Library's service win
dow in order to obtain library access priv
ileges for her domestic partner.
She was ultimately denied.
Bresnan, like many other gay and les
bian University faculty and staff mem
bers, is unable to obtain benefits for her
domestic partner — and feels humiliated
when she asks for them.
"I felt sort of embarrassed at
first. . . as if I was trying to pull one over
on the library.. . as if [library adminis
trators] were protecting the library from
me, a professor," she said.
Bresnan pointed out the stark con
trast between the library incident and
one that followed a few days later, when
Dean of Humanities and Sciences Ewart
Thomas asked if she would accept the dis
tinguished Howard H. and Jessie T.
Watkins University Professorship, an
endowed professorship held last year by
English Prof. Diane Middlebrook.
"I feel like I'm getting a mixed mes
sage from the University," she said.
Under the current policy regarding Uni
versity employee benefits, Stanford does
not grant domestic partners of faculty and
staff members the benefits available to the
spouses of faculty and staff members.
"This is one of the few forms of dis
crimination that is still socially accepted,"
she said. "And Stanford reflects that."
But Bresnan is hoping that the Bene
fits Parity Bill, to be voted on by the Uni
versity Faculty Senate Oct. 29, will
change practices at the University, if not
in society. The bill was passed by the
Medical School Faculty Senate Sept. 18.
Domestic partners of students were
granted spousal privileges two years ago.
The bill proposes that domestic part
ners of gay and lesbian University employ

ees be granted the same benefits — includ
ing library and athletic privileges and
medical and dental coverage — available
to spouses of heterosexual employees.
If the bill is not passed, Bresnan said,
"It would be profoundly alienating for all
of us. . . profoundly disturbing. There
would be a shaking of confidence in the
institution."
Bresnan has been living with her part
ner, Marianne Brems, for more than a
year and said she considers their rela
tionship "socially, financially and emo
tionally the equivalent of a marriage."

'This is one of the few
forms of discrimination that
is still socially accepted.'
— Prof. Joan Bresnan

A professor at Stanford since 1983,
Bresnan didn't request domestic partner
privileges until last month, when Brems
needed to use the Stanford libraries.
Judging from her positive experiences
with colleagues and from the overall liber
al climate of Stanford, Bresnan said she
thought obtaining library privileges for
Brems "wasn't really going to be an issue."
When Bresnan tried to get a library
card for Brems, however, she said she
"was a little bit shocked."
Bresnan was told the library granted
access privileges only to employees'
spouses and children. Unsatisfied with
this reply, she questioned Karen Nagy,
director of academic information
resources for University libraries, who
confirmed the policy, Bresnan said.
However, Assoc. Law Prof. Janet Hal
ley was able to obtain access to the Uni
versity libraries for her partner.
"The first answer we got was 'no,"' Hal
ley said. But "the people who work here
don't like having to turn down domestic

partners," she explained. "The library staff
went out of the way to solve the problem."
Halley said she, too, felt "embar
rassed" when requesting the privileges.
Learning of Bresnan's experience, Halley
noted the inconsistencies of the University's
policies regarding domestic partners. "Mar
ried couples are not subject to the arbitrari
ness and the anxiety it provokes," she said.
Bresnan also acknowledged that the
"official rules are enforced with quite a

bit of discretion."
After her request was denied, Bresnan
said, "I realized I'm being treated as
though I'm not a legitimate part of the
(Stanfordl community."
Bresnan said she believes that she
would likely encounter similar responses
if she tried to obtain any other privileges
for Brems. "I would have to go every
where on campus and justify my relation
ship," she said.

Bresnan said faculty and staff members
who are not openly homosexual are "suf
fering twice" over the disparities in access,
because they are suffering in silence.
"To lay your soul bare to whoever you
meet is just very awkward," she said.
Bresnan noted that domestic partners
of students are exempt from this process.
"The University should treat me just like
everyone else," she said, "just like stu
dents who have non-traditional families."
