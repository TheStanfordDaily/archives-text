# Facility for Haas Center underway
## 
### Jake Dorman 
Born in a single room of Owen House
eight years ago, the Haas Center for Public
Service has rapidly outgrown its 100-year
old home. But the popular center will soon
have a fresh lease on life, when its new quar
ters open in early February.
The $3.3 million, three-story facility cur
rently under construction near The Bridge
will quadruple the available space for stu
dent service groups, creating a highly acces
sible center and bringing most of Stanford's
many service groups under one roof.
According to Haas Center Asst. Dir.
Megan Swezey, the center is $165,000 short
of its fundraising goal, which staffers expect
to reach by selling engraved bricks for the
center's courtyard for $200, or a stair in the
interior for $1,000.
Growing pains, fueled by Stanford's bur
geoning interest in community service, have
forced closets in Owen House to be turned
into office space, and 10 different groups
share one office roughly the size of a dorm
room. The center currently houses more
than 25 student organizations and places
more than 2,000 students annually in com
munity service projects, but has been forced
to turn away several student service organi
zations because of a lack of room.
"The Haas Center is an incubator that
makes ideas flourish," said recent graduate
Linda Cheu, the center's volunteer coordina
tor. "Right now we are bursting at the
seams."
Senior Tracy Clay, a clearinghouse peer
advisor, expects the new center to be a big
help. The old center "is too crowded, which is
a real hindrance to getting things done. Plus
it's poorly designed. That entry hall is so con
fusing, it's like terror city," she said, adding
that there are no large meeting rooms in the
old center. The new building will have a room
big enough to hold 80 people.
In addition to the groups in the old cen
ter, the new center going up on Salvatierra

Walkway will allow sufficient space for new
student groups as well as the Volunteers In
Asia program now housed in Old Union.
The expansion of the center reflects the
growth of interest in public service at Stan
ford and across the nation. Last year, 30 stu
dents attended the community service coor
dination meeting during freshman orienta
tion whereas 175 students did so this year.
"It is indicative of the fact that high
schools are increasingly promoting service
and also that the '80s are over," Cheu said.
"Students are looking at their communities
and are interested in making a positive dif
ference."
A survey of graduating seniors a few
years ago estimated that 70 percent of Stan
ford students participate in at least one com
munity service project during their college
years.
"I think it's great that there is a need for
an expanded Haas Center," said sophomore
Jim Bowman, who was a community service
representative last year. "It's a reflection of

the enthusiasm and involvement of Stanford
students. I'm proud of the fact that commu
nity service is given more than just lip ser
vice."
Stanford established the public service
center in 1984 to provide a focal point for
student service. In 1989, the Haas family of
San Francisco, which owns Levi Strauss and
the Oakland A's, endowed the center with a
gift of $6.2 million.
According to Swezey, Owen House will
probably be occupied by the Law School
when it is vacated by the Haas Center.
The people who work at the Haas Center
are optimistic about their new quarters.
"Stanford has an amazing potential to
change the problems (of the surrounding
community]. It is a major university with
major resources," Cheu said.
Students interested in community service
should attend the volunteer opportunity fair
in White Plaza on Tuesday, from 11 a.m. to
1:30 p.m., or the Haas Center Open House
on Thursday, from 4 to 6 p.m.
