"When I joined Radian, I was im
pressed at all the expertise in dif
ferent disciplines available here.
Working on multidisciplinary
teams has been a great chance for
me to get to know many of my co
workers and to learn from all of
them. Because I'm involved in so
many different projects from
designing a groundwater remedia
tion system to organizing a PCB
field sampling effort, I'm constant
ly challenged."
