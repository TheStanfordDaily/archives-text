We're Looking for Talented People
- Not Dead Fish.
Nature's method of preserving the past has
nothing in common with ESL's method of
preserving the future. We don't set anything
in stone. Instead, we maintain a viable mix
of professionals of all ages, levels, and back
grounds in a flexible environment where
neither people nor ideas fossilize.
That's the unique opportunity ESL - a world
class supplier of innovative intelligence sys
tems, products, technologies, and services -
offers qualified graduates.
The challenge doesn't come at the expense of
stability and security. ESL has been making
significant accomplishments and growing for
nearly 30 years - a solid foundation for both
the present and the future.
Also, as a subsidiary of TRW, ESL offers
resources and benefits that most medium
sized companies cannot.
