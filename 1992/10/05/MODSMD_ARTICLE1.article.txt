# The 						changing of the guard
## Speech a lesson in history 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Although classes were officially can
celed, the 7,000 students, faculty and
staff attending University President
Gerhard Casper's inauguration Friday
were given a history lesson that included
two former University presidents, a
reading of Jane Stanford's writings and
Casper's own spin on the history and
meaning of Stanford's motto.
In his first major address since he took
office Sept. 1, Casper centered mainly on
lessons learned from past presidents,
tying in how the motto "the winds of free
dom" could be used to guide Stanford.
After the processional of faculty,

dressed in the gowns and caps of the uni
versities from which they received
degrees, former University President
Donald Kennedy gave a humorous wel
come introducing Stanford to Casper
and Casper to Stanford.
In his speech, Casper continued in the
same vein, illustrating his newness to
Stanford by comparing himself to the
entering freshmen and transfer students
and by saying he had flunked his first
Stanford "advanced placement test" last
March because he had not known Stan
ford's motto.
But Casper soon absolved himself of
his initial ignorance by showing how

much he had learned about Stan
ford, relating anecdotes about
former Stanford presidents. His
stories ranged from Wally Ster
ling's inaugural address to David
Starr Jordan's preoccupation
with fish.
Casper then focused on Jor
dan's interest in German human
ist Ulrich von Hutten, who was
the first president's source for
Stanford's unofficial motto, "The
wind of freedom blows."
After relating the history of
the motto — including how it was
translated first from Latin, then
German — Casper discussed
what the saying meant to Stan
ford.
A university must be free to
learn and to research, he said. It
also must be free to challenge
both "established orthodoxy" and
"new orthodoxy," he said, warn

ing the audience that, "A univer
sity must not have dominant
ways of thinking."
After the inauguration, a
reception titled "The Arts at
Stanford Welcome President Ger
hard Casper" was held in the
Quad, where many stood in line
for a chance to shake the hands of
Stanford's ninth president and
his wife, Dr. Regina Casper.
Faculty members at the recep
tion generally praised Casper's
speech, calling it "appropriate"
and "scholarly."
Professors were impressed by
Casper's knowledge of Stanford
history. "He's better informed
than most of us who have been
here for years," said John Stew
ard, a emeritus professor of
microbiology and immunology.
Some others liked what the
reception afterward said about
Casper. "Casper's inclusion of the
arts in this occasion was particu
larly appropriate," said Michael
Ramsaur, the chair of the Drama
Department.
