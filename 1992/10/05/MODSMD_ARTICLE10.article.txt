AMSTERDAM, Netherlands
(AP) â€” Ail Israeli cargo jet with
engine trouble crashed into an
apartment complex yesterday
night shortly after takeoff, trig
gering a firestorm that raced
through a crowded suburb.
At least 12 bodies were recov
ered, but Dutch television said
police feared up to 200 people may
have died. The El A 1 Boeing 747
carried a three-man crew and one
woman passenger, the carrier said.
The pilot was trying to wrestle
the jet back to Schiphol Airport
when it slammed into the nine
story apartment building, spew
ing flames and burning wreckage
over a wide area of Duivendrecht.
Residents searched frantically
for family members in the hellish
landscape of fire, smoke and chaos.
Some people jumped out of the
windows of their apartments to
escape the inferno, radio reported.
"It crashed right into the build
ing. I saw the wings and all ignit
ed. It exploded into one huge sea
of fire," said resident Mark van
der Linden.
Two nine-story apartment com

plexes were set ablaze. Mayor Ed
van Thijn of Duivendrecht said at
least 50 apartments were gutted.
Helicopters fitted with search
lights illuminated the scene for
hundreds of rescue workers.
Police reported looting in a near
by shopping mall.
The Amsterdam Medical Cen
ter Hospital said it treated at least
27 burn victims.
Airline officials dismissed early
suspicion of a terrorist strike,
which could have jeopardized sen
sitive Middle East peace talks.
Yisrael Cherbin, cargo manag
er for El A 1 in Amsterdam, said
the plane's captain reported prob
lems with two engines after take
off and asked to return to the air
port, about 10 miles south of
Amsterdam.
"He's returning to land, and
when he said he was landing, it
crashed," said Cherbin.
The plane flew over a lake to
dump fuel and crashed about 6:30
p.m. (1:30 p.m. EDT) on the turn
to make a new approach to
Schiphol, one of Europe's busiest
airfields.
