Clinton supports Mexico treaty
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Democrat Bill Clinton
yesterday endorsed the controversial free-trade
treaty with Mexico, but said he would not sign it
unless additional steps were taken to protect Amer
ican workers.
"If it is done right, it will create jobs in the
United States and in Mexico," the Arkansas gov
ernor said in an address at North Carolina State
University.
The announcement ended weeks of speculation
over how the Democratic nominee would land on
the trade pact, which was completed in August
after 14 months of negotiation by the Bush
administration.
Candidates' campaign spending
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush has as
much as $20 million more than Bill Clinton to
spend in the campaign's final month and plans to
use his carefully hoarded funds to bankroll an
unprecedented month-long media blitz.
Clinton's campaign insists it still has plenty of
reserve cash for a final volley of its own — and so

does Ross Perot, who is unbound by any legal lim
its on campaign spending.
An Associated Press review of campaign spend
ing shows that Bush began October with about $49
million left of the $65.5 million the Republicans are
allowed to spend on the fall election. Clinton, mean
while, had between $27 million and $32 million left.
Where's Perot?
DALLAS (AP) — Ross Perot spent his first
weekend as a presidential candidate under wraps
working on campaign strategy.
After announcing his bid for the White House
on Thursday, the Texas businessman was inter
viewed on ABC's "20/20" on Friday and then
dropped from sight.
Perot spokeswoman Sharon Holman said yes
terday the Texas billionaire spent most of the
weekend at his Dallas home working on advertising
strategy and overall campaign plans with advisers.
She said his first ad, a 60- or 90-second cam
paign spot, was likely to air Monday night during
the Dallas Cowboys-Philadelphia Eagles game on
ABC. The ad will feature "vintage Ross Perot"
who will "tell it like it is," Ms. Holman said.
