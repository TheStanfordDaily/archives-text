# Mozambique cease-fire signed

ROME (AP) — Mozambique's government and
rightist rebels signed a formal cease-fire yesterday,
ending 16 years of civil war that took 600,000 lives and
paving the way for peace throughout southern Africa.
The accord, and the free elections that are to fol
low in one year, would formally end the last shooting
war of a region where ethnic and political tensions
escalated into Cold War conflicts.
President Joaquim Chissano, an ex-Marxist, and
Renamo rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama called each
other "dear brother." They embraced repeatedly to
the applause of the presidents of Zimbabwe and
Botswana, and mediators from Italy, the United
States, France, Britain and Russia.
The cease-fire will go into effect once the Mozam
bique national assembly ratifies it. A vote is expect
ed within the month.
The signing came at a time of increasing democ
racy in southern Africa, when countries such as
Angola and Namibia were throwing off the thrall of
single-party rule and South Africa was reversing
some of its apartheid policies.
Reached after two years of negotiations and two
days of last-minute wrangling, the pact is expected
to let desperately needed aid reach the 15 million
residents of the famine-stricken country and allow
free U.N.-supervised elections in October 1993.

The United Nations reported last month that 3.2
million people face starvation and urgent aid was
needed to avert a disaster on the scale of Somalia.
More than 1 million refugees have crossed into Malawi
to escape famine and war.
Dhlakama, a soldier in the Portuguese, Mozambi
can and Renamo rebel army for 20 of his 41 years,
vowed that "The sacrifices of hundreds who fell in
this fratricidal fight have not been in vain."
"Power is not important," he said. "If we lose the
election we will go into the opposition. We will
respect the agreement."
Renamo — the Portuguese acronym for the
Mozambique National Resistance Movement — was
founded in 1977 by the secret police of what was
then Rhodesia to put pressure on Mozambique,
which had become a base for black guerrillas fight
ing Rhodesia's white minority government.
After Rhodesia became black-governed Zimbabwe
in 1980, South Africa became the rebels' benefactor.
Pretoria says it halted aid in 1984 but there were
reports it continued aid for communications and logis
tics until 1990.
In 1984, Mozambique signed an abortive non
aggression pact with South Africa, attempting to
relieve pressure on its southern border. But Ren
amo's 23,000 troops kept battling government forces.
