## Unwise censorship

Athletics Dept.
not helping with
nix of Band show

Die luft der freiheit
weht — The wind of freedom
blows. But not at halftime.
Only one month into Stanford's
"new era" and we're already see
ing discrepancies between this
school's administrative words and
its ways.
"Don't necessarily do the politi
cally correct thing," said Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper in his
inaugural address Friday at Frost
Amphitheater.
But as he admonished students,
faculty and staff to be intolerant of
intolerance, the elite of the
Department of Athletics sat across
the street, content to censor one of
the most creative — and least
politically correct — groups on
campus: the Stanford Band.
Occasionally distasteful but
usually entertaining, the Band is
certainly the most thought-pro
voking aspect of Saturday football
games. Their shows frequently
demonstrate more inspired, origi
nal thought on current events
than do many Stanford lectures.
And while this doesn't give
them the absolute right to parade
their opinionated debauchery in
front of tens of thousands of spec
tators each week — admittedly, the
forum is a privilege, not a right —
their interest in freedom of expres
sion and speech outweighs any
conceivable interest of the Athlet
ics Department.
This is especially true if that
interest is in keeping alumni wal
lets open by pandering to their
conservative concept of "good
taste."
Nevertheless, rights or privi
leges should only be guaranteed to
the point at which they impinge
upon other's rights. In this vein,
the Stanford community has
established certain standards of

behavior and conduct through the
Fundamental Standard and the
speech code.
The formalized protocol for
applying these standards, through
committees and hearings, trials
and appeals, allows the community
to judge and be judged in a demo
cratic and just manner.
If the campus community feels
strongly that the Band's shows
have crossed the line of what is
"appropriate" or "acceptable,"
there must be codified criteria
against which to hold the group.
Arbitrarily banning a show
because it's not something "every
one is going to be proud of" — the
only standard by which the depart
ment currently judges the Band's
shows — leaves the door wide open
for a kind of censorship of which
no member of the Stanford com
munity could be proud.
A committee of Band members,
Athletics Department officials,
students, faculty and alumni could
draft a code by which band shows
would be evaluated. An indepen
dent body — not the Athletics
Department — would then be
responsible for interpreting the
code and taking action if necessary.
In the spirit of mutual respect,
shows should not be up for review
prior to the Band's performance.
They should be performed freely,
with the knowledge that the code
would be invoked post-perfor
mance if the Band failed to hold to
the accepted standards.
Paying lip service to openness
and"the winds of freedom" can be
dangerous, as Stanford found out
during the indirect-cost fiasco.
President Casper now has his first
opportunity to prove that his
proclamation of openness is more
than administrative rhetoric.
By calling on the Athletics
Department to permit the perfor
mance of "The Unauthorized Biog
raphy of Gerhard Casper," and to
establish specific standards under
which to review shows, he would
demonstrate that Stanford really
has entered a "new era" under his
leadership.
