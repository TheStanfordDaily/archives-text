Cohen's bad logic makes his argument 'all wet 9

Prof. Jeremy Cohen's impromptu
review of my latest book, "Impostors in
the Temple," was both unexpected and
intriguing — unexpected because I
didn't know Cohen cared and intrigu
ing for the logic of his argument.
Cohen says I say, "Faculties do not
care about teaching." Wrong. I do not
indict all faculty.
I did say, "There is a widespread
contempt for teaching among the teach
ers on our university and college cam
puses," and I quote a December 1990
report of the Carnegie Foundation for
the Advancement of Teaching that con
cluded "in the current climate, students
all too often are the losers ... in glossy
brochures, they are assured that teach
ing is important, that a spirit of com
munity pervades the campus, and that
general education is the core of the
undergraduate experience.
"But the reality is that on far too

many campuses, teaching is not well
rewarded and faculty who spend too
much time counseling and advising stu
dents may diminish their prospects for
tenure and promotion."
How strange that Cohen does not
include the author of that study,
Ernest Boyer, on his honor roll of
"storm makers." I guess Boyer doesn't
fit his preconceived notion that only
the Wall Street Journal, Bill Bennett
and I could possibly be critical of
academe.
But what puzzles me is that Cohen
seems to agree with the main thrust of
the book, i.e., that students in general
are not qualified to teach and grade
other students, while arguing the oppo
site.
Cohen implies great efforts are made
to improve teaching at Stanford, saying
that Ewart Thomas has, "Invited
dozens [sic] of faculty to seminar dis-

cussions of teaching style, substance,
goals and barriers."
Then why are all the freshman
English courses being taught and
graded this fall by graduate students,
some of them not even English
majors? Cohen argues that in his
department doctoral students only
teach after they have finished their
first year of study.
Wow. A whole year. He says they
attended workshops and, "are becoming
quite qualified to teach." Becoming
quite qualified?
Shouldn't they wait until they actu
ally become qualified, say by earning
the doctoral degree and persuading a
university to hire them as a professor?
Cohen finishes his analysis by saying of
course there is room "for a great deal of
improvement." Does that mean that
things aren't so good now?
The shaky logic and rigor of his

argument falls away completely at the
end when he leaps from his meandering
message to triumphantly conclude that
"the story of educational criticism — at
least as phrased by Anderson and his
cadre of politicized weather watchers —
is indeed sterile thunder without rain."
Poor T.S. Eliot, to be subjected to
such quotation abuse. If indeed the
"thunder" is so sterile, without rain,
then why is Prof. Cohen's argument all
wet?
Finally, Cohen misspells the title of
my book — "Impostors" is spelled with
an "o," not with an "e," and he mis
spells Dinesh D'Souza's name (Dinesh
not Denesh). One more misspelling and
we're going to have to consider award
ing Cohen the James Danforth Quayle
Medal for Fostering Excellence in
Spelling.
