# Katz ignores the religious faithful
## 
### 
Barry Katz makes a vast generaliza
tion in his Oct. 1 column: "our own civi
lization — perhaps more than any that
preceded it — is hostile to the very idea of
transcendence."
Oh? What of the roughly 90 percent of
Americans who still identify themselves
as Christians?
Not all of them are church-goers, and
only 10 percent are totally committed
but, still, it is clear from recent surveys
that we are the most believing society in
the Western world.
Throw in the relative handful of
believing Jews, Muslims, etc. Now add
the overlapping crowd who fervently
believe in freedom to the extent that they

are willing to die for it, as was my dear
departed friend Sidney Hook. Although
he identified himself as a pragmatist,
Hook was one of the most transcendent
people I have ever met.
He received love letters from various
church groups.
There are all sorts of folks who are
unaware of it but who are running on the
spiritiual stuff their ancestors passed
down to them. That is our routine self
deception.
Again overlapping, most of us educat
ed people get spiritual highs from great
music, art and literature.
Mr. Katz simply ignores all the forego
ing. Granted there are many who achieve
their peak experience with genome-stud
ies, space exploration and super-colliders
(once again, with huge overlap: I dig
them too).
I submit that his one-sided overview is
more a reflection of "Stanford tech" and

chic anti-traditional ideology than of any
large-scale reality "out there" or even "in
here."
