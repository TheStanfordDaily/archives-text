# Ehrlich's theories consistently miss
## 
### 
Biology Professor Paul Ehrlich is
Stanford's answer to Chicken Little.
Ehrlich has made a career of stirring
fear by preaching impending environ
mental doom and then slinking into the
shadows when his dire predictions prove
false.
The Population Bomb may have
earned Ehrlich fat royalty checks, but it
utterly failed to predict population
growth rates over the next 20 years.

Here's a less well-known example of
Ehrlich's gift for prescience.
In 1980, professor and author
Julian Simon, who believes natural
resources are abundant and will
become cheaper, offered to bet anyone
the difference of any commodity in the
futures market.
Ehrlich bet $1,000 on five metals and
lost on all of them. His payment by
check didn't even include a note.

For the record

Julie Taylor's reference to non-resi
dent fellow faculty members in her Oct. 2
column should have described them as
"simply," not "simple," people.
