# Tone returns Stanford's sight to academics
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Complying with its new role as a
chastised institution, Stanford hun
kered down and went back to basics
at Gerhard Casper's inauguration
Friday.
In a ceremony that sought to
deflect fallout from the indirect-cost
controversy by present ing an austere,
academic tone, Casper consistently
emphasized "teaching, learning and
research" as the University's central
purposes.

"Only in one respect must the Uni
versity be rigidly conservative,"
Casper said in his 20-minute address.
"It must protect the openness, the
rigor, the seriousness of its work in
education and research."
Introduced by Board of Trustees
President John Freidenrich as a man
who had applied "bedrock" academic
values to all of his endeavors, Casper
was portrayed as the ideal candidate

to lead Stanford's restoration.
Each Stanford president, Freiden
rich said, "has been the right person
at the right time."
And each speaker during the cere
mony underscored Freidenrich's point:
that Casper, widely described as a cau
tious, scholarly academician, is right
for Stanford in the current era of finan
cial scarcity and public skepticism.
Describing the "severe buffeting"
that Stanford has received over the
past few years and the "financial
thicket" it currently finds itself in,
former University President Richard

Lyman said Stanford "is ready to be
led by Casper.
"Communities stand in constant
need of renewal," Lyman said. "Our
need is just a little more urgent right
now."
Looking professorial and wearing
reading glasses, Casper traced the
etymology of Stanford's motto (Die
Luft der Freiheit weht — The wind of
freedom blows), recounted the strug
gles of the German humanist Ulrich
von Hutten against the ruling
scholasticism of the 16th century, and
generally startled listeners with a speech
that discussed the orthodoxy of the unre
formed Church more than it did specific
programs or plans.
"Why, you started asking yourselves
some time ago, is the new president
telling us all this?" Casper said at the
close of his detailed analysis of Hutten,
which consumed three of the eight pages
of his prepared text.
The academic focus served a dual pur
pose, observers said. Not only did it
reflect Casper's scholarly bent, but it also
sent a message to critics that Stanford
remains committed to knowledge and
research.
"He set the tone for an academic insti
tution, keeping with traditional academic
values," said Michael Ramsaur, chair of
the Drama Department.
The speech was particularly important
"for the indirect message that it commu
nicated about Casper," said former Presi
dent Donald Kennedy. It drove the point
home that, "This is a scholarly president
who draws thoughtfully on the lessons of
the past," he said.
Even in its structure, the speech
implicitly reminded listeners of its main
themes: teaching and research.
By analyzing the motto in such depth,
Casper demonstrated his "commitment
to teaching, since he's telling us some
thing we didn't know," said English Prof.
Ron Rebholz. And he demonstrated his
commitment to research by "digging up
the origins of that motto," which
required an extensive knowledge of lan
guages, Rebholz said.
Casper made specific reference to the

indirect-cost controversy only once — but
appropriately, it was couched in terms of
the value of Stanford's academics.
"We should also remember that burn
ing the midnight oil, hard work in study
and laboratory, remains the rule at Stan
ford even if those who see only shortcom
ings will not admit it,"he said.

'We should also
remember that burning
the midnight oil, hard
work in study and
laboratory, remains the
rule at Stanford.'

Gerhard Casper

The tone of Casper's speech was
unsurprising, given that he told the Los
Angeles Times last May that the trustees
want him to refocus attention at Stanford
"on the central purposes of the Universi
ty, that is, teaching and research, not
being diverted by all these political con
troversies."
And he said during the summer that
he did not plan to make any major
announcements or describe any specific
plans during his inauguration. "It will be
an affair of Stanford University, for Stan
ford University," he said in August. "It
will not be an event of any sort."
