## PC labels confuse, offend 
### 
Nobody likes to be labeled. And
while it makes the average person
bristle with annoyance, it makes
the average Stanford student seethe with
antagonism.
It's not necessarily the label itself that
can turn your dormmates into rabid dogs
eager to destroy you, but the fact that
YOU had the gall to try to crisply describe
THEM with a term not of their choosing.
For an example of the power you can
toy with here, try this little experiment:
the next time someone in your house
offers a vaguely political viewpoint, sim
ply nod your head knowingly and reply,
"Oh. . . You're one of those."
This can get especially delicate when
labels for various oppressed groups are
considered. The first rule of thumb seems
to be that any community's members can
call each other anything, which is under
standable and relaxed.
Rule number two gets tricky; it states
that all outsiders have to use a specific
"acceptable" term.
I think you can see where some confu
sion can seep in. On Queerland buttons,
"dyke" and "fag" are okay — from Keith
Rabois' mouth, well, they're not.
One time last year I was playing Sega
football with my next-door neighbors,
members of a black fraternity. At first, I
was taken aback at how frequently they
used the term "nigger" — it was what
they called each other, themselves, even

the video players on the screen.
They obviously didn't mind, and it was
cool with me. But I did have a nice little
chuckle to myself over the imagined reac
tion had I, the Wonderbread kid, chipped
in during a game, "Damn, nigger, hold
onto the ball!"
Right. You'd be able to taste the ten
sion.
The really hard part is keeping up on
the changes. Before I came out here,
"Oriental" was completely acceptable.
Although I'm still not exactly sure what's
so offensive about it, it didn't take long
for me to pick up "Asian" and "Asian-
American" and reject "Oriental" as a
Very Bad Thing. There was no grace peri
od, of course; I was simply an insensitive
jerk until I got it right.
When I was in elementary school, I
had a very black teacher once who was
extremely strict. Mrs. Lee absolutely
insisted that members of her race were
never black, which was offensive, but
Negro, and always with a capital "N".
Okay, fine.
Any teacher who would literally take a
can of Lysol and spray a little boy unfor
tunate enough to break her rule about
accidentally passing gas inspires a strict
adherence to authority. We wrote our lit
tle essays throughout the year, and
always used a capital "N".
Flash forward to a different grade and
school. I'm reading a campaign poster

and I ask a black classmate of mine if the
girl running for vice president is Negro.
Well.
That was not a pleasant conversation.
People, I'm trying, I swear! I honestly
don't set out to offend anyone. Shouldn't
I have to want to offend you for it to
count? I don't mean to be a jerk when I
say "handicapped," but haven't we
passed the point of silliness when we
demand that we use "differently abled"?
It sounds too much like how my Mom
would describe me if I came home crying
that all of the kids pick me last in kickball
every day.
Just as you ask me to be sensitive in
how I refer to you, let me ask you to be
sensitive to my confusion.
I have no idea when "Afro-American"
became acceptable and when it turned
into something more vicious. I don't
know whether I can actually call someone
with a "dyke" button a "dyke" to her
face, or even if I can call her "queer."
All I know is that I honestly don't
mean to offend anyone. Shouldn't that
count for something?
