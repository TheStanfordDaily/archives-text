## Offense comes together, doubles up Fightin' Irish 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
All season long, Stanford's offense has
struggled to find the end zone. Stalled
drives and turnovers in the opponent's
territory have created a disparity between
the offense's ability to churn out yardage
and the ability to score.
On Saturday in South Bend, Ind., this
trend ground abruptly and convincingly
to a halt.
After a shaky start, quarterback Steve
Stenstrom and the men around him man
ufactured four touchdowns and 33 points
in the last 39 minutes of the game.
Things looked bad at the beginning.
Stenstrom did not practice all week until
Friday, and there was a chance he would
hand the reins to backup Mark Butter
field.
Stenstrom was welcomed to Notre
Dame with a punishing blindside hit by
AU-American linebacker Demetrius
Dußose on the first play from scrimmage.
The hit forced a fumble, which was recov
ered by Stanford in its own end zone for a
safety.
For a while, it didn't look like things
would be any different for the offense.
After the safety, three out of Stanford's
next four possessions ended in punts.
Late in the first quarter, halfback Glyn
Milburn returned a Notre Dame punt 33
yards to the Fighting Irish 39-yard line.
After the Cardinal moved the ball down
to the 14, senior fullback J.J. Lasley fum
bled when hit by Dußose.
The drive seemed to symbolize the

year-long frustration of not being able to
capitalize on good field position and the
ability to move the ball.
Midway through the second quarter,
the momentum of the game was entirely
in Notre Dame's direction. Unfaithful
alumni and fans across the country
turned off their television sets, feeling
that the game would turn into a Fighting
Irish rout.
However, things changed when cor
nerback Darrien Gordon recovered a fum
ble and returned it to the Notre Dame 23.
The timeless adage, "the best offense is a
good defense," came to fruition as the
Cardinal capitalized with a short drive
and its first score of the game.
After a 17-yard pass from Stenstrom
to sophomore wide receiver Justin
Armour, Milburn capped off the drive
with a 6-yard touchdown run. The score
stood at 16-6 after the Cardinal failed to
complete the 2-point conversion.
In the second half, the Stanford
offense clearly played its best football so
far in 1992. They outgained the Fighting
Irish 236-118 in total yards in the final 30
minutes.
The Cardinal fired on all cylinders
offensively, moving the ball both in the
air and on the ground. Stenstrom passed
very efficiently, completing 21 of 32 pass
es for 215 yards with two touchdowns and
no interceptions.
"Steve took a lot of shots today," head
coach Bill Walsh said. "He kept his poise
and hit his receivers when it was vital.

er."
Stenstrom received his best
protection of the year despite
receiving some big hits. He was
quick to give his offensive line
credit. "The line did a really
great job," he said.
Walsh agreed with Stenstrom.
"They (the offensive line) played
beautifully against some very
quick defensive linemen," he
said.
Stenstrom's main targets,
Armour and fellow wide receiver
Mike Cook, contributed with big
catches, at crucial times. Armour
caught an eight-yard touchdown
pass in the third quarter, and
Cook made eight receptions for
78 yards.
After some first half drops,
the receivers grabbed everything
in sight. Cook explained that he
never lost confidence in his
team's ability to move the ball.
"We came in here saying 'We
can beat these guys,"' Cook said.
"We knew we could hit the little
passes, six yards here, eight
yards there, and then make the
big play."
Milburn balanced the offense
perfectly, rushing for 124 yards
on 20 carries, including two
touchdown runs.
Perhaps his biggest play
came late in the fourth quarter.
With the Cardinal up only 23-
16, he raced around right end
on a sweep for a 14-yard touch
down.
"It's not a new play, we run
that one every week," Milburn
said. "I got a great block on that
play."
Milburn was quick to down
play any suggestion that his
team was outmanned. "We ran
very effectively," he said. "We
showed them that we could dom
inate."
Freshman kicker Eric Abrams
complemented the offensive
effort with two perfect field goals
and three extra points. On the
season, he is now seven of eight
on field goal attempts.
Milburn chose his words wise
ly when he spoke of the offense's
ability to dominate. On a inter
esting sidenote, not only did the
Cardinal pile up 27 points in the
second half, but residents of Pot
ter alone outscored the Fighting
Irish on the game. Armour and
Milburn, who combined for 18
points, both call Potter home.
"It's too bad they can't play
intramurals," said one disgrun
tled Potterite.
No, they can't play intramu
rals, but Milburn, Armour and
the rest of the Cardinal offense
seem to have found their
stride.

Cook made eight receptions for
78 yards.
After some first half drops,
the receivers grabbed everything
in sight. Cook explained that he
never lost confidence in his
team's ability to move the ball.
"We came in here saying 'We
can beat these guys,"' Cook said.
"We knew we could hit the little
passes, six yards here, eight
yards there, and then make the
big play."
Milburn balanced the offense
perfectly, rushing for 124 yards
on 20 carries, including two
touchdown runs.
Perhaps his biggest play
came late in the fourth quarter.
With the Cardinal up only 23-
16, he raced around right end
on a sweep for a 14-yard touch
down.
"It's not a new play, we run
that one every week," Milburn
said. "I got a great block on that
play."
Milburn was quick to down
play any suggestion that his
team was outmanned. "We ran
very effectively," he said. "We
showed them that we could dom
inate."
Freshman kicker Eric Abrams
complemented the offensive
effort with two perfect field goals
and three extra points. On the
season, he is now seven of eight
on field goal attempts.
Milburn chose his words wise
ly when he spoke of the offense's
ability to dominate. On a inter
esting sidenote, not only did the
Cardinal pile up 27 points in the
second half, but residents of Pot
ter alone outscored the Fighting
Irish on the game. Armour and
Milburn, who combined for 18
points, both call Potter home.
"It's too bad they can't play
intramurals," said one disgrun
tled Potterite.
No, they can't play intramu
rals, but Milburn, Armour and
the rest of the Cardinal offense
seem to have found their
stride.
All season long, Stanford's offense has
struggled to find the end zone. Stalled
drives and turnovers in the opponent's
territory have created a disparity between
the offense's ability to churn out yardage
and the ability to score.
On Saturday in South Bend, Ind., this
trend ground abruptly and convincingly
to a halt.
After a shaky start, quarterback Steve
Stenstrom and the men around him man
ufactured four touchdowns and 33 points
in the last 39 minutes of the game.
Things looked bad at the beginning.
Stenstrom did not practice all week until
Friday, and there was a chance he would
hand the reins to backup Mark Butter
field.
Stenstrom was welcomed to Notre
Dame with a punishing blindside hit by
AU-American linebacker Demetrius
Dußose on the first play from scrimmage.
The hit forced a fumble, which was recov
ered by Stanford in its own end zone for a
safety.
For a while, it didn't look like things
would be any different for the offense.
After the safety, three out of Stanford's
next four possessions ended in punts.
Late in the first quarter, halfback Glyn
Milburn returned a Notre Dame punt 33
yards to the Fighting Irish 39-yard line.
After the Cardinal moved the ball down
to the 14, senior fullback J.J. Lasley fum
bled when hit by Dußose.
The drive seemed to symbolize the

year-long frustration of not being able to
capitalize on good field position and the
ability to move the ball.
Midway through the second quarter,
the momentum of the game was entirely
in Notre Dame's direction. Unfaithful
alumni and fans across the country
turned off their television sets, feeling
that the game would turn into a Fighting
Irish rout.
However, things changed when cor
nerback Darrien Gordon recovered a fum
ble and returned it to the Notre Dame 23.
The timeless adage, "the best offense is a
good defense," came to fruition as the
Cardinal capitalized with a short drive
and its first score of the game.
After a 17-yard pass from Stenstrom
to sophomore wide receiver Justin
Armour, Milburn capped off the drive
with a 6-yard touchdown run. The score
stood at 16-6 after the Cardinal failed to
complete the 2-point conversion.
In the second half, the Stanford
offense clearly played its best football so
far in 1992. They outgained the Fighting
Irish 236-118 in total yards in the final 30
minutes.
The Cardinal fired on all cylinders
offensively, moving the ball both in the
air and on the ground. Stenstrom passed
very efficiently, completing 21 of 32 pass
es for 215 yards with two touchdowns and
no interceptions.
"Steve took a lot of shots today," head
coach Bill Walsh said. "He kept his poise
and hit his receivers when it was vital.

Coy Gibbs, Seyon Albert, and Billy Wittman converge on Notre Dame tailback Reggie Powers. The Cardinal defense held
the nation's most powerful offense scoreless for the final 39 minutes of Saturday's contest.
He's a courageous football play
er."
Stenstrom received his best
protection of the year despite
receiving some big hits. He was
quick to give his offensive line
credit. "The line did a really
great job," he said.
Walsh agreed with Stenstrom.
"They (the offensive line) played
beautifully against some very
quick defensive linemen," he
said.
Stenstrom's main targets,
Armour and fellow wide receiver
Mike Cook, contributed with big
catches, at crucial times. Armour
caught an eight-yard touchdown
pass in the third quarter, and
Cook made eight receptions for
78 yards.
