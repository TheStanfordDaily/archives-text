# No. 2 water polo asserts power
## 
### Sam Wu 
Within a three-day span last weekend, the Stan
ford water polo team reestablished itself as one of the
very finest, if not the finest, squad in the nation.
The Cardinal entered the NorCal Tournament at
deGuerre Pool as the No. 4 club in the country. But
after winning five of its six games against top-20
opposition, Stanford should now place second in the
polls behind unbeaten California according to head
coach Dante Dettamanti.
The Cardinal ascent began with a 15-4 thrashing
of sixth-ranked UC-Santa Barbara Friday morning.
With junior All-American goal keeper Larry
Bercutt's return, all went well for Stanford. Nine dif
ferent players bombarded the Gauchos' goal, led by
sophomore All-American candidate Wolf Wigo's
three scores. Senior Chip Blankenhorn and Fresh
man Jeremy Ijaster contributed two goals each, while
senior John Matarangas, junior Brian Clemens,
sophomores Frank Schneider, Brian Border and Dan
Hancock, and freshman Brian Pyle each added one.
Bercutt gathered three saves, while his backup,
junior Zach Gallagher, picked up four.
The only unpleasantry occurred when a Santa
Barbara player flagrantly punched senior defensive
specialist Charles Smith. Smith required stitches in
his right eyelid and eyebrow, and had to sit out the
next two games.

Even without Smith, the Cardinal easily handled
their next two opponents. Stanford downed No. 3
USC 14-6 Friday afternoon and No. 11 Fresno State
17-10 the next morning. Against the Trojans, every
aspect of Stanford's game was in synch in what Det
tamanti called his squad's best game of the year to
date. The Cardinal counterattack "clicked," and the
Trojans were punished in nearly every Stanford 6-on
-5 power-play advantage. Indeed, at one point in the
fourth quarter, the Cardinal led 14-4.
"The game really showed our potential to win the
NCAA title," Dettamanti said. Seven different play
ers scored, paced by Wigo and Matarangas with three
each. Schneider, Blankenhorn, and freshman Josh
Leachman all tallied two scores, and Laster and
Clemens each tacked on one. Bercutt blocked ten
shots, while Gallagher turned away one.
Stanford continued its excellence of execution
against the Bulldogs, jumping to a 9-1 lead at half
time. Eventually, the Cardinal would win 17-10 as
Dettamanti utilized his bench in the second half.
Eleven Stanford players got into the scorebook —
Pyle, Matarangas, and junior Chris Wallin led the
way with four, three, and two goals respectively,
while Wigo, senior Kevin Watson, Blankenhorn,
junior Antonio Busquets, Hancock, Leachman,
Clemens, and Bill Maguy all had one. Bercutt and
Gallagher each made four saves.
But the "red tide" came to a
halt against fifth-ranked UC-
Irvine that afternoon.
Although Smith returned to
action, Stanford lost 10-5 to a
team they had beaten 8-4 earlier

in the year. "We just couldn't get
in synch, offensively or on
defense," Dettamanti said sim
ply-
He attributed the "let-down"
to the excitement over the victory
against Southern Cal and the gru
eling six-games-in three-days
schedule.
Indeed, Irvine's defense pre
vented the Cardinal from scoring
on all six of its 6-on-5 advantages.

while Stanford's defense allowed
three behind-the-back goals.
Wigo paced the lost cause with
two scores, while Matarangas,
Husquets, and Schneider each
added one. Bercutt gathered eight
saves.
The Cardinal would not simply
roll over, however. Stanford refo
cused and defeated No. 2 Pepper
dine 8-4 Sunday morning. Detta
manti compared that contest to

the USC encounter. Although
Wigo didn't score, his teammates
picked up the slack. Smith led
with three goals, Blankenhorn
followed with two, and Wallin,
Busquets, and Matarangas fin
ished with one each. Bercutt
rejected nine goal attempts.
Stanford's tourney finally
ended with an easy 13-5 win
against No. 16 UC-Davis yester
day afternoon. Wigo and I^aster

each scored three times, while
Busquets and Pyle put in two
each. Bercutt stopped three goals,
while Gallagher halted eight.
The coach felt that all hißjpLty>
ers performed solidly on offense
as well as defense, and that his
team's defense "really came
around." "Anytime you hold a
top-five team like Pepperdine
under five goals you know you're
doing well," Dettamanti said.

with three goals, Blankenhorn
followed with two, and Wallin,
Busquets, and Matarangas fin
ished with one each. Bercutt
rejected nine goal attempts.
Stanford's tourney finally
ended with an easy 13-5 win
against No. 16 UC-Davis yester
day afternoon. Wigo and I^aster

each scored three times, while
Busquets and Pyle put in two
each. Bercutt stopped three goals,
while Gallagher halted eight.
The coach felt that all hißjpLty>
ers performed solidly on offense
as well as defense, and that his
team's defense "really came
around." "Anytime you hold a
top-five team like Pepperdine
under five goals you know you're
doing well," Dettamanti said.
Within a three-day span last weekend, the Stan
ford water polo team reestablished itself as one of the
very finest, if not the finest, squad in the nation.
The Cardinal entered the NorCal Tournament at
deGuerre Pool as the No. 4 club in the country. But
after winning five of its six games against top-20
opposition, Stanford should now place second in the
polls behind unbeaten California according to head
coach Dante Dettamanti.
The Cardinal ascent began with a 15-4 thrashing
of sixth-ranked UC-Santa Barbara Friday morning.
With junior All-American goal keeper Larry
Bercutt's return, all went well for Stanford. Nine dif
ferent players bombarded the Gauchos' goal, led by
sophomore All-American candidate Wolf Wigo's
three scores. Senior Chip Blankenhorn and Fresh
man Jeremy Ijaster contributed two goals each, while
senior John Matarangas, junior Brian Clemens,
sophomores Frank Schneider, Brian Border and Dan
Hancock, and freshman Brian Pyle each added one.
Bercutt gathered three saves, while his backup,
junior Zach Gallagher, picked up four.
The only unpleasantry occurred when a Santa
Barbara player flagrantly punched senior defensive
specialist Charles Smith. Smith required stitches in
his right eyelid and eyebrow, and had to sit out the
next two games.

Even without Smith, the Cardinal easily handled
their next two opponents. Stanford downed No. 3
USC 14-6 Friday afternoon and No. 11 Fresno State
17-10 the next morning. Against the Trojans, every
aspect of Stanford's game was in synch in what Det
tamanti called his squad's best game of the year to
date. The Cardinal counterattack "clicked," and the
Trojans were punished in nearly every Stanford 6-on
-5 power-play advantage. Indeed, at one point in the
fourth quarter, the Cardinal led 14-4.
"The game really showed our potential to win the
NCAA title," Dettamanti said. Seven different play
ers scored, paced by Wigo and Matarangas with three
each. Schneider, Blankenhorn, and freshman Josh
Leachman all tallied two scores, and Laster and
Clemens each tacked on one. Bercutt blocked ten
shots, while Gallagher turned away one.
Stanford continued its excellence of execution
against the Bulldogs, jumping to a 9-1 lead at half
time. Eventually, the Cardinal would win 17-10 as
Dettamanti utilized his bench in the second half.
Eleven Stanford players got into the scorebook —
Pyle, Matarangas, and junior Chris Wallin led the
way with four, three, and two goals respectively,
while Wigo, senior Kevin Watson, Blankenhorn,
junior Antonio Busquets, Hancock, Leachman,
Clemens, and Bill Maguy all had one. Bercutt and
Gallagher each made four saves.
But the "red tide" came to a
halt against fifth-ranked UC-
Irvine that afternoon.
Although Smith returned to
action, Stanford lost 10-5 to a
team they had beaten 8-4 earlier

in the year. "We just couldn't get
in synch, offensively or on
defense," Dettamanti said sim
ply-
He attributed the "let-down"
to the excitement over the victory
against Southern Cal and the gru
eling six-games-in three-days
schedule.
Indeed, Irvine's defense pre
vented the Cardinal from scoring
on all six of its 6-on-5 advantages.

while Stanford's defense allowed
three behind-the-back goals.
Wigo paced the lost cause with
two scores, while Matarangas,
Husquets, and Schneider each
added one. Bercutt gathered eight
saves.
The Cardinal would not simply
roll over, however. Stanford refo
cused and defeated No. 2 Pepper
dine 8-4 Sunday morning. Detta
manti compared that contest to

the USC encounter. Although
Wigo didn't score, his teammates
picked up the slack. Smith led
with three goals, Blankenhorn
followed with two, and Wallin,
Busquets, and Matarangas fin
ished with one each. Bercutt
rejected nine goal attempts.
