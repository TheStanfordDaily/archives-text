# No. 2 water polo asserts power

### Sam Wu 
Within a three-day span last weekend, the Stan
ford water polo team reestablished itself as one of the
very finest, if not the finest, squad in the nation.
The Cardinal entered the NorCal Tournament at
deGuerre Pool as the No. 4 club in the country. But
after winning five of its six games against top-20
opposition, Stanford should now place second in the
polls behind unbeaten California according to head
coach Dante Dettamanti.
The Cardinal ascent began with a 15-4 thrashing
of sixth-ranked UC-Santa Barbara Friday morning.
With junior All-American goal keeper Larry
Bercutt's return, all went well for Stanford. Nine dif
ferent players bombarded the Gauchos' goal, led by
sophomore All-American candidate Wolf Wigo's
three scores. Senior Chip Blankenhorn and Fresh
man Jeremy Ijaster contributed two goals each, while
senior John Matarangas, junior Brian Clemens,
sophomores Frank Schneider, Brian Border and Dan
Hancock, and freshman Brian Pyle each added one.
Bercutt gathered three saves, while his backup,
junior Zach Gallagher, picked up four.
The only unpleasantry occurred when a Santa
Barbara player flagrantly punched senior defensive
specialist Charles Smith. Smith required stitches in
his right eyelid and eyebrow, and had to sit out the
next two games.

Even without Smith, the Cardinal easily handled
their next two opponents. Stanford downed No. 3
USC 14-6 Friday afternoon and No. 11 Fresno State
17-10 the next morning. Against the Trojans, every
aspect of Stanford's game was in synch in what Det
tamanti called his squad's best game of the year to
date. The Cardinal counterattack "clicked," and the
Trojans were punished in nearly every Stanford 6-on
-5 power-play advantage. Indeed, at one point in the
fourth quarter, the Cardinal led 14-4.
"The game really showed our potential to win the
NCAA title," Dettamanti said. Seven different play
ers scored, paced by Wigo and Matarangas with three
each. Schneider, Blankenhorn, and freshman Josh
Leachman all tallied two scores, and Laster and
Clemens each tacked on one. Bercutt blocked ten
shots, while Gallagher turned away one.
Stanford continued its excellence of execution
against the Bulldogs, jumping to a 9-1 lead at half
time. Eventually, the Cardinal would win 17-10 as
Dettamanti utilized his bench in the second half.
Eleven Stanford players got into the scorebook â€”
Pyle, Matarangas, and junior Chris Wallin led the
way with four, three, and two goals respectively,
while Wigo, senior Kevin Watson, Blankenhorn,
junior Antonio Busquets, Hancock, Leachman,
Clemens, and Bill Maguy all had one. Bercutt and
