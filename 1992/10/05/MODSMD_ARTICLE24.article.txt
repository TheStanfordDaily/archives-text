# Soccer drops pair at home

Inconsistency and frustration have earmarked
the Stanford men's soccer team (6-4-0) thus far
this season. Last weekend, the 19th-ranked Cardi
nal dropped games to unseeded George Washing
ton University, 2-1, and to the University of South
Florida, 1-0, in the Bank of America Invitational
held before impressive home crowds at Maloney
Field.
In the opening game of the invitational, for
ward Ryan Collins, who garnered the Freshman
Athlete of the Year Award last season, started off
the scoring with a goal assisted by Chet Zimmer
10 minutes into the match.
That should have been enough to hold off the
George Washington Colonials (5-2-3) as the Cardi
nal sparkled on defense, allowing only one shot on
goal during the first half. However, the eventual
upset hinged upon that single shot.
Late in the first half, Joel Hough, a Colonial
substitute in the midficld, misfired an apparent
pass which instead caught the upper right corner
of the goal to tie the score 1-1.
That "once in a lifetime, impossible goal," as
senior midfielder Jason Vanacour described it,

was scored from 25 yards out and seemingly
unnerved the Cardinal, who faltered slightly in
the scoreless second half.
The game was eventually concluded six min
utes into overtime on a goal by the Colonials'
Steve Master, who now the Atlantic 10 Con
ference in scoring.
Although Stanford dominated the overall shots
by a margin of 22 to 10, it was unable to capitalize
on most of its plays downfield.
"I thought we played solid and had several
opportunities to finish the game, but we didn't
take advantage of them," coach Colin Lindores
said. "And then in overtime we made a tactical
error in overplaying [Master] and he broke away
and scored the easy goal."
Stanford's inability to put the ball in the net
also plagued them Sunday in the finale against a
much stronger South Florida team (7-2-0). Once
again they dominated on shots, 10 to three, only to
be beaten on the defensive end.
The only score of the contest came 25 minutes
into the first half as South Florida's Ail-American
candidate, Mark Chung, rocketed the ball past
