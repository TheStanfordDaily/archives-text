# Soccer drops pair at home

Inconsistency and frustration have earmarked
the Stanford men's soccer team (6-4-0) thus far
this season. Last weekend, the 19th-ranked Cardi
nal dropped games to unseeded George Washing
ton University, 2-1, and to the University of South
Florida, 1-0, in the Bank of America Invitational
held before impressive home crowds at Maloney
Field.
In the opening game of the invitational, for
ward Ryan Collins, who garnered the Freshman
Athlete of the Year Award last season, started off
the scoring with a goal assisted by Chet Zimmer
10 minutes into the match.
That should have been enough to hold off the
George Washington Colonials (5-2-3) as the Cardi
nal sparkled on defense, allowing only one shot on
goal during the first half. However, the eventual
upset hinged upon that single shot.
Late in the first half, Joel Hough, a Colonial
substitute in the midficld, misfired an apparent
pass which instead caught the upper right corner
of the goal to tie the score 1-1.
That "once in a lifetime, impossible goal," as
senior midfielder Jason Vanacour described it,

was scored from 25 yards out and seemingly
unnerved the Cardinal, who faltered slightly in
the scoreless second half.
The game was eventually concluded six min
utes into overtime on a goal by the Colonials'
Steve Master, who now the Atlantic 10 Con
ference in scoring.
Although Stanford dominated the overall shots
by a margin of 22 to 10, it was unable to capitalize
on most of its plays downfield.
"I thought we played solid and had several
opportunities to finish the game, but we didn't
take advantage of them," coach Colin Lindores
said. "And then in overtime we made a tactical
error in overplaying [Master] and he broke away
and scored the easy goal."
Stanford's inability to put the ball in the net
also plagued them Sunday in the finale against a
much stronger South Florida team (7-2-0). Once
again they dominated on shots, 10 to three, only to
be beaten on the defensive end.
The only score of the contest came 25 minutes
into the first half as South Florida's Ail-American
candidate, Mark Chung, rocketed the ball past
defenders for the decisive 1-0
margin.
The Bulls went on to claim the
Bank of America title and swept
the individual awards as well.
The offensive MVP of the invita
tional went to Chung, and the
defensive MVP went to the Bulls'
goalkeeper.
Stanford was without sweeper
Jeff Kogl, who is recovering from
ligament damage. Without Kogl
the backfield suffered from a lack
of stability, and no one stepped up
to make the big plays.
After Stanford was shut out for
the second time this season, coach
Lindores said, "When a team has
trouble scoring there is a little bit
of panic that sets in. That's when
players start making hurried shots
instead of passing it off to some
body in a better position. There
were shots today that were missed
or kicked right at the goalkeeper."
"What we need to work on is
poise," Lindores continued. "We
have to come out aggressive and
maintain our poise even if we get
behind early."
Stanford goalkeeper Kyle
Krpata also attributed the loss to
the team's inconsistency thus far.
"It was very hard to get into a
rhythm during both games," be
said, "But if we start playing
together as a unit, this team haÂ£
the potential to do much better
once we start competing for the
conference title."
Of the disappointing 0-2 show
ing at their home tournament,
coach Lindores said, "We still
have a good shot at the title. The
players have to understand that
we do have another opportunity
next week, and few teams have
the luxury of a second chance. If
we are a solid team we will raise
our level of play and win the con
ference."
Vanacour, Stanford's leading
scorer, is also optimistic about
the young season. "In the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation,
the top two teams have automat
ic bids in the NCAA Tournament.
And with the talent we have I'm
sure we'll come out on top."
