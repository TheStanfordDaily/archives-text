# Women keep rolling

The Stanford women's soccer team
scored quickly and overcame physical play
to dominate the Golden Dome Classic at
Notre Dame.
The Cardinal beat Central Florida 3-1
and the Irish 3-0 to stay undefeated head
ing into its home tourney Oct. 10-12.
But victory wasn't without a price, as
rough play marred the Central Florida
match.
"There were a lot of fouls and at least
one yellow card," said Stanford coach
Berhane Andeberhan.
"The [player) who marked Rafanelli
deserved a red card (ejection). She was con
stantly chopping her."
Andeberhan added that although the
Knights usually played the ball, "They
didn't care if they got a piece of you in the
process."
Central Florida tried to outrun and out
battle Stanford for the ball as the Knights
eschewed a controlled passing game for
dump-and-chase tactics.
"Their style was a little awkward,"
Andeberhan said. "They completely
bypassed midfield by having their fullbacks
dumping the ball in the corner for the for
wards. They didn't have any pattern."
The Cardinal countered with a four-full
back setup, which included freshman Kris
ten Hulvey, who usually plays midfield.
"She's had a lot of experience at outside
back and we plan to play her there against
other teams that play that way," Andeber
han said. "She's a good tackier and is con
fident in tight spaces."
However it was Central Florida, not
Stanford, who started the game hot. The
Knights pressured the defense early but
the Cardinal soon found its rhythm. Fresh
man Dena Dey scored twice in five minutes
to put her team up 2-0 at halftime.
Stanford couldn't quite put the Knights
away and a concentration lapse allowed
Central Florida to pull within one.
"We hit a wall early in the second half
and got tired for about 10 minutes," Ande
berhan said.
"We didn't have any legs left. People
coasted a bit and we gave up kind of an
easy goal."
After that the Cardinal turned the
intensity up a notch and secured the victo
ry with a goal that Andeberhan described
as one of the best he's seen this year.

"(Julie) Foudy threaded a pass to
Rafanelli who scored with a one-touch shot
under extreme pressure," he said while
praising the play of both athletes.
"[Rafanelli| was butchered. She took
such a beating. . . . But it was probably the
best game Rafanelli and Foudy have had
this year. They really rose to the occasion
for us," Andeberhan said.
As had Central Florida, Notre Dame
gave extra defensive attention to Stan
ford's midfield-forward tandem.
"They sacrificed a couple of people just
to chase them," Andeberhan said. "But the
midfield markers didn't do much.
(Rafanelli) took a lot of abuse but she's
tough and she's good at riding out tackles."
The junior forward led the Cardinal
attack and scored less than three minutes
into the game. She beat a couple a players
to the goal, but her shot was blocked back
into play.
Two defenders and Rafanelli converged
on the ball. Rafanelli emerged from the
pack with possession and scored, much to
the surprise of her coach.
"It looked like |the defenders! had taken
her out but she stumbled through and beat
the keeper," he said. "It was a great indi
vidual effort."
Less than 10 minutes later, midfielder
Jen Stephan tallied the squad's second goal
off an assist from Carmel Murphy.
Rafanelli added another goal in the second
half.
And this time, Stanford didn't let its
opponent back in the game. "Our players
really kept their concentration," Andeber
han said.
"There was a three or four minute span
when we were feeling each other out but
then we took charge."
Andeberhan gave Murphy a lot of credit
for setting the tempo. "She played her best
game of the year. She and Julie (Foudy)
controlled midfield. She played with a lot of
confidence."
And the few times the Irish had scoring
opportunities they were stymied by timely
defense. Twice Cardinal fullbacks knocked
the ball back from the goal line.
Another time Notre Dame beat Stan
ford on a counterattack. Cardinal keeper
Leslie Garrard came out from goal to go
one-on-one with the forward who had bro
ken free with the ball.
The Irish striker shot at point blank
range but Garrard blocked it wide to pre
serve the shutout.

After that the Cardinal turned the
intensity up a notch and secured the victo
ry with a goal that Andeberhan described
as one of the best he's seen this year.

"(Julie) Foudy threaded a pass to
Rafanelli who scored with a one-touch shot
under extreme pressure," he said while
praising the play of both athletes.
"[Rafanelli| was butchered. She took
such a beating. . . . But it was probably the
best game Rafanelli and Foudy have had
this year. They really rose to the occasion
for us," Andeberhan said.
As had Central Florida, Notre Dame
gave extra defensive attention to Stan
ford's midfield-forward tandem.
"They sacrificed a couple of people just
to chase them," Andeberhan said. "But the
midfield markers didn't do much.
(Rafanelli) took a lot of abuse but she's
tough and she's good at riding out tackles."
The junior forward led the Cardinal
attack and scored less than three minutes
into the game. She beat a couple a players
to the goal, but her shot was blocked back
into play.
Two defenders and Rafanelli converged
on the ball. Rafanelli emerged from the
pack with possession and scored, much to
the surprise of her coach.
"It looked like |the defenders! had taken
her out but she stumbled through and beat
the keeper," he said. "It was a great indi
vidual effort."
Less than 10 minutes later, midfielder
Jen Stephan tallied the squad's second goal
off an assist from Carmel Murphy.
Rafanelli added another goal in the second
half.
And this time, Stanford didn't let its
opponent back in the game. "Our players
really kept their concentration," Andeber
han said.
"There was a three or four minute span
when we were feeling each other out but
then we took charge."
Andeberhan gave Murphy a lot of credit
for setting the tempo. "She played her best
game of the year. She and Julie (Foudy)
controlled midfield. She played with a lot of
confidence."
And the few times the Irish had scoring
opportunities they were stymied by timely
defense. Twice Cardinal fullbacks knocked
the ball back from the goal line.
Another time Notre Dame beat Stan
ford on a counterattack. Cardinal keeper
Leslie Garrard came out from goal to go
one-on-one with the forward who had bro
ken free with the ball.
The Irish striker shot at point blank
range but Garrard blocked it wide to pre
serve the shutout.

Jennifer Jackson and Anne Wicks get up to block a UCLA attack. The Cardinal
women's volleyball team, ranked second in the nation, defeated No. 6 USC in four
games Friday before falling 12-15, 6-15, 15-2, 15-6,16-14 in a heartbreaker to the No.
1 Bruins Saturday at Maples Pavilion. For the complete story, see tomorrow's Daily.
The Stanford women's soccer team
scored quickly and overcame physical play
to dominate the Golden Dome Classic at
Notre Dame.
The Cardinal beat Central Florida 3-1
and the Irish 3-0 to stay undefeated head
ing into its home tourney Oct. 10-12.
But victory wasn't without a price, as
rough play marred the Central Florida
match.
"There were a lot of fouls and at least
one yellow card," said Stanford coach
Berhane Andeberhan.
"The [player) who marked Rafanelli
deserved a red card (ejection). She was con
stantly chopping her."
Andeberhan added that although the
Knights usually played the ball, "They
didn't care if they got a piece of you in the
process."
Central Florida tried to outrun and out
battle Stanford for the ball as the Knights
eschewed a controlled passing game for
dump-and-chase tactics.
"Their style was a little awkward,"
Andeberhan said. "They completely
bypassed midfield by having their fullbacks
dumping the ball in the corner for the for
wards. They didn't have any pattern."
The Cardinal countered with a four-full
back setup, which included freshman Kris
ten Hulvey, who usually plays midfield.
"She's had a lot of experience at outside
back and we plan to play her there against
other teams that play that way," Andeber
han said. "She's a good tackier and is con
fident in tight spaces."
However it was Central Florida, not
Stanford, who started the game hot. The
Knights pressured the defense early but
the Cardinal soon found its rhythm. Fresh
man Dena Dey scored twice in five minutes
to put her team up 2-0 at halftime.
Stanford couldn't quite put the Knights
away and a concentration lapse allowed
Central Florida to pull within one.
"We hit a wall early in the second half
and got tired for about 10 minutes," Ande
berhan said.
"We didn't have any legs left. People
coasted a bit and we gave up kind of an
easy goal."
After that the Cardinal turned the
intensity up a notch and secured the victo
ry with a goal that Andeberhan described
as one of the best he's seen this year.

"(Julie) Foudy threaded a pass to
