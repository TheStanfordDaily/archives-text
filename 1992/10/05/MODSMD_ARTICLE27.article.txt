# Cross country nets two fourth-places at home

The Stanford golf course was hot
and dry with an occasional breeze — a
perfect day for running a couple miles.
And over 400 collegiate runners did just
that in the Stanford University Invita
tional Cross Country Race on Saturday.
The four college-level races began
with the women's open, followed by the
women's invitational. The latter con
sisted of the strongest field in the entire
meet, with second-ranked Arkansas,

seventh-ranked Arizona, and ninth
ranked Brigham Young present.
The Cardinal women, in placing
fourth behind those three squads, were,
in the words of head coach Vin Lanan
na, "fantastic," showing promise of "a
bright future." The ladies shot by the
other Pacific 10 Conference competi
tors present: UCLA, California, and
USC placed sixth, 11th, and 13th,
respectively.
For the second straight week, the
Cardinal was led by junior Louise Wat
son, a transfer student from Kent, Eng
land, who placed second individually in
the invitational race. Watson ran at a
controlled pace, staying with the lead
pack in fourth place for most of the
race. Then, about 600 yards from the
finish and spurred on by the cheering
crowd, she began a tremendous kick
that shot her into second. She finished
the 5-kilometer race in 16 minutes 59
seconds, losing to Tonya Todd of BYU
by only 8 seconds.
Of the finishing drive that netted
her a personal best time, Watson sim
ply said, "It hurt!"
The lineup of races continued with
the men's open and the men's invita
tional. Stanford placed fourth in the
invitational, which was dominated bv

third-ranked Arizona. The Wildcats
placed four runners in the top six on its
way to garnering an impressive team
score of 35. They were headed by Mar
tin Keino from Kenya, who was last
year's fourth-place finisher in this
event. Keino set a blistering pace, run
ning the first mile in 4:28. Grinning
broadly, he completed the 8-kilometer
course in 23:24.
There was only one runner in the
entire field who came close to challeng
ing Keino after the first mile, Stan
ford's own Gary Stolz. Stolz followed
his pre-race plan meticulously, starting
out slowly, then moving up at about the
3-1/2 mile marker.
The word "slowly" should be read
with a grain of salt, however, as he com
pleted the first mile in 4:40, which was
good for seventh place at that early
juncture. At about the 2-mile point,
Stolz moved into second, perhaps 60
yards behind Keino. From then on
Stolz was unable to come within 20
yards of Keino, yet he steadily dis
tanced himself from the rest of the
pack. Stolz finished in 22:31, a personal
best by about 35 seconds.
The rest of the field was about 20
seconds behind and was led by Eliazar
Herrera from UCLA and three Arizona
runners within four seconds of one
another. The next Stanford runner was
Mike Reilly, who placed 15th, followed
by Todd Lewis, at 29th.
Coach Lananna rated his teams'
overall performances as "spectacular"
and continued to emphasize the youth
and relative inexperience of both
squads. He pointed out that the teams
were yet "a few weeks away."
Stolz also hit on this topic in saying
that he is "not close to being ready" for
the bigger meets later in the season. He
feels that he has the distance but that
he and his teammates need more speed
workouts to generate the kick needed to
catch a runner like Keino, whom the
Cardinal will meet again at the Pac-10
Conference Championship Meet later
this month.
Coach Lananna added that he
thought both teams would "surprise
some people by the end of the season."
To accomplish that surprise, though,
the Cardinal needs to find some depth
to complement both Watson and Stolz
and bring both teams into the upper
echelon of the Pac-10 and the nation.
