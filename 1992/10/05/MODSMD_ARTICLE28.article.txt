# Excerpts from Casper's address

### 
"As measured in terms of what
Stanford should contribute to the
future, it may not be rich in finan
cial resources, but it is rich in its
capacity as a university to pull
together and do its work, the work
of a university — the work of a
great university — with integrity
and determination. The true uni
versity, however old, must draw
together and reinvent itself every
day. To put it differently and to
exaggerate only slightly, even after
100 years — or, for that matter,
500 years — the days of a universi
ty are always first days. The work
of the university is work that can
not be done unless it is continuous
ly reconsidered. ... I am looking
forward with much hope and much
confidence to our years of 'first
days' in common at Stanford....
A university's freedom must be
first of all the freedom that we take
mostly for granted, though the
humanists had to fight for it and
others must still do battle for it
even today: the pursuit of knowl
edge free from constraints as to
sources and fields....
A university must be free to
challenge established orthodoxy...
. The main task of the university is
to question and to challenge funda

mental assumptions and practices
— that is, by implication, to favor
change if these assumptions and
practices prove to be wrong. The
university's commitment is to
knowledge and research, not to a
particular content or program or to
specific results. Only in one respect
must the university be rigidly con
servative: it must protect the open
ness, the rigor, the seriousness of
its work in education and research.
A university's freedom must be
the freedom to challenge new
orthodoxy. Just as traditions
should not be embraced merely
because they are traditions, the
newest intellectual fashions should
not rule just because they are
new. ...
A university's freedom must be
the freedom of its members, facul
ty and students to think and speak
for themselves. A university must
not have dominant ways of think
ing
I am sometimes asked these
days whether teaching will be one
of my priorities as president. Of
course, it will. As will be research.
The question is well-meant but ill
conceived. In the best universities

— and you are at one of the best
universities in the world — teach
ing, learning and research are all
equally important elements of the
all-embracing search to know. . ..
The wind of freedom blows
across national and cultural
boundaries, it does not stop at
them. Hutten, like many of his
humanist friends, claimed the free
dom to engage in fruitful contacts
with whomsoever and wheresoev
er. His world was limited to
Europe; ours comprises all conti
nents. ... I know few universities
that are better positioned than
Stanford to become a place of
learning with a truly inter-national
and m/er-cultural character. We
need to understand, appreciate and
value differences, while realizing
that without a common thread
holding us together we shall be
lost. ...
The wind of freedom cannot
blow in a closed and stuffy ivory
tower. Members of a university
community must not shy away
from the social and political issues
of their time, from shaping the
social and political values of soci
ety, from engaging in public ser
vice. Public service is their free
dom, indeed their obligation. It is

not, however, necessarily the uni
versity's freedom. A university's
freedom and obligation are to pro
vide a forum for the most searching
and candid discussion of public
issues. But, as one of the century's
foremost First Amendment schol
ars, my much missed Chicago col
league, the late Harry Kalven, has
said, a university 'cannot take col
lective action on the issues of the
day without endangering the con
ditions for its existence and effec
tiveness. There is no mechanism
by which it can reach a collective
position without inhibiting that
full freedom of dissent on which it
thrives.'...
Good institutions and good
work need a lot of breathing
space. I worry that as we attend to
the shortcomings of universities,
we as a country are losing sight of
the conditions that create good
work and good institutions. We
should also remember that "burn
ing the midnight oil, hard work in
study and laboratory, remains the
rule at Stanford and its sister uni
versities even if those who see
only shortcomings will not admit
it. The research enterprise can
easily be smothered by internal
and external politics, pressures
and red tape."
