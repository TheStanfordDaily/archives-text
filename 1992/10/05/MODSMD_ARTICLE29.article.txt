In a day of festive celebration
and nervous anticipation, newly
inaugurated University Presi

On the eve of Gerhard Casper's inaugura
tion, opinions were mixed about what was the
worst thing that could happen on The Big Day.
The main fear of many was rain, as clouds
flirted with the campus through most of the day.
Mark, who was checking the sound system
Thursday evening at Frost amphitheater, fig
ured that rain could be handled - Maples
Pavilion was ready to go in case of inclement
weather. Nothing but an earthquake could
really mess things up, he concluded.
"No way," snapped one of the workers
checking the maze of electrical wiring connec
tions. "The worst thing for us would be to be
told to shift the venue tonight and then, after
we were all done by morning, to be told that
the weather was OK and to shift everything
right back here."
Kimberly Marshall, the university organist
who was to play the Stanford Fanfare from the
recesses of the cavernous stage, had her own
problems.
"It's unnerving," she said. "Sitting here, I
feel like Beethoven conducting the Ninth
Symphony — I have no idea how this sounds
out there. I wouldn't even know if they
couldn't hear a thing."
The prophets of doom, to the relief of orga
nizers, were proved wrong.
Even the ambulance and first aid services
— who "were prepared for all contingencies up
to handling cardiac arrests" according to one
staffer— had nothing more exciting to do than
to sit back and watch the show.
And while it seemed that fewer students

attended Casper's inauguration than last
spring's visit by Mikhail Gorbachev, many
enjoyed the ceremony and then spent up to an
hour waiting in line to shake the hand of Stan
ford's new leader.
"He was nice and I really liked his wife —
she told me that she liked to see women on grad
campus because that means that there will be
more women in management in the years to
come," she said.
Heather Smith, a senior who had shaken
Casper's hand as he left the amphitheater and
had stood in line to shake it again, was ecstatic.
"He remembered me," she said happily.
"He even liked my T-shirt. Of course he'll be a
success."
Outsiders to Stanford were equally approv
ing. Henry Nord, who had travelled all the
way from Chicago with his wife to attend the
ceremony strolled around the colorful Quad
Friday morning.
"It did take a little longer than the usual
function here," he said. "But it was a good
function, and (former president) Don
Kennedy's speech was simply brilliant".
As with the inaugural ceremony, a small
group of coordinating officials ensured that
everything ran effortlessly on schedule.
Jean Fetter, assistant to the president, had
the relatively unpleasant job of keeping people
from spending too much time with Casper as
he met them in the reception line.
"It's one of the ways you earn your feathers,"
she smiled, mixing charm with just the right
amount of firmness to keep the line moving.
Special displays of affection from the presi
dent were reserved for a couple of people.

Noe, the eight-year-old son of a faculty
member, donned his father's cap while wait
ing in line.
"And in which subject did you get your
PhD?" Casper asked. "Sports," replied "Dr.
Noe," which earned him a warm hug.
Nicolaj Siggelkow, a freshman, was the
other person to be embraced by the president.
"I'm from Hamburg too," he explained. "So I
greeted him in German and he was delighted
to meet a fellow, um, Hamburger."
Despite all appearances, not everything ran
smoothly behind the scenes.
"There were a few glitches" said Stephen
Peeps, associate vice president for development,
who helped coordinate the morning's events.
"The faculty procession took longer than we
planned, the sound system had a couple of prob
lems — and we ended up running half an hour
behind schedule by the end."
There was one obvious snafu during one of
the ceremony's classical musical interludes.
Both audience and faculty — with Casper being
a notable exception — broke into applause at
one point during a moment of silence halfway
through one of the pieces.
And what did the University's "first cou
ple" think about their "first big function" at
Stanford?
"It was, um, enjoyable" said Casper's wife
Regina, groping for the appropriate words
after a hard morning's work.
And the president himself?
Casper gently massaged his right hand that
had been relentlessly pumped for over two
hours and ruefully said, "It begins to develop
'reactions' after some time, you know."

'The wind of
freedom has been
a necessary, if not
sufficient,
condition for
making our great
universities the
envy of the world.
Without that
freedom, that
greatness is
imperiled.'
