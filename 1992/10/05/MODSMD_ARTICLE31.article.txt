# Sheik's donation to battle cancer
## $1 million contribution will fund precision radiation technique

A Saudi Arabian sheik's $1 million
donation to the Medical Center will help
fund another battle in the war against
cancer, University officials announced
yesterday.
Sheik Hassan Mohammad Enany has
pledged the money to help Stanford
develop techniques and technology for
frameless stereotactic radiosurgery, a
process that uses concentrated radiation
to kill tumors.
"It's a technique for X-ray delivery that
is so precise that you can treat (tumors)
with massive doses of radiation," said
Associate Professor of Neurosurgeiy John
Adler, a radiosurgery researcher.
Adler said stereotactic radiosurgery is
"bloodless surgery" that uses only one
dose of radiation, pinpointed on tumors,
to kill them. Older radiation treatment
techniques involved several doses of
lower level radiation, not necessarily

focused only on the cancer.
Currently, Adler said, the technique
is used only on brain tumors. To pin
point the tumor, a rigid frame is screwed
into the patient's head, and a series of X
rays or a CT scan locate the tumor.
In contrast, frameless radiosurgery
would not require a reference frame
screwed into the patient and would free
the technique for treatment of malig
nancies in any part of the body.
"There has never been a technique
for precision localization (of radiation)
outside the head" before stereotactic
radiosurgery, Adler said.
"I really think it's going to usher in a
new age of cancer surgery," he said. "I
think the days where doctors cut people
open and remove tumors are numbered."
Part of Enany's donation will go
toward building a frameless stereotac
tic radiosurgery facility at Stanford
Hospital, scheduled to open in April.
Once the center is open, Adler said the
first patients can be treated with the

frameless technique.
According to Jackie Brown, director
of communications for medical develop
ment, the Medical Center receives
about $54 million in donations annual
ly from individuals, charitable groups
and corporations.
Cancer treatment programs have
been singled out by the center as focal
developmental areas for the next 10
years, she added.
The million-dollar gift is not Enany's
first donation to Stanford. Earlier this
year, Enany donated $100,000 to research
in radiosurgery, as part of a group that
pledged a total of about $3 million to the
program. Enany has also given $100,000
to Stanford's Overseas Program in Latin
America. Enany's son, Amr, received his
master's in international studies from
Stanford and plans to get an MBA at the
Graduate School of Business.
Adler said Enany became interested
in the radiosurgery technique through
mutual friends at Stanford.
