# Selling yourself without totally selling out
## 
### June Cohen 
A just anger rises from deep
in the marrow of your soul.
Bubbling, percolating, it
boils to the surface.
"I am not a number," you
scream, shaking the glazed, robot
ic look from your face in a
moment of intense Ayn Rand-ian
self-realization. "I am a living,
breathing person and will not be
dehumanized!"
Then you realize, no one's listen
ing. And you're still broke.

So you sit yourself back down
and set about working on
your dreaded resume once
again. Putting yourself in the
mindset of a true capitalist,
you break yourself down to the most
basic elements and reconstruct yourself
— using active verbs, of course — as a
marketable, desirable product up for sale
to the highest bidder.
"Nothing too personal," you mutter
bitterly as you list your life accomplish
ments. "Wouldn't want them to know
I'm human or anything."
Okay, okay, quit feeling sorry for
yourself. True, there isn't much room for
things like "nice person" or "likes cats"
on a resume. But that doesn't mean you
can't let yourself shine through.
Besides, drafting your resume can be
a constructive process, one that forces
you to analyze your accomplishments
and goals, while also allowing you to pat
yourself on the back — once you've for
given yourself for not having 10 years of
work experience and a Pulitzer Prize to

show for your 22 years.
So get yourself a tall, frosty glass of
milk, put on those scuff slippers you've
been waiting to take out of the wrapper,
and prepare yourself for a sometimes
encouraging, sometimes-harrowing walk
down memory lane.
Qirst off, you'll want to think
about who this resume is
going to and what aspects of
your life they'd be most inter
ested in.
Since employers spend anywhere
from 10 seconds to three minutes
reviewing a resume, your skills and
qualifications "have got to be apparent
right off the bat," said Virginia Mak, a
counselor with the Career Planning and
Placement Center.
"lt"s kind of like matchmaking,"
Mak suggests. "You've got to make the
match apparent."
If you're applying to jobs in more
than one field, you might find it neces
sary to draft two or more different

resumes — each tailored toward a spe
cific job in a particular field,
For instance, high school science
fair awards may actually prove quite rel
evant when applying for a job as a
research assistant. But if you're also
applying to be a paralegal, those honors
probably won't carry as much weight.
Once you know who your audience
is, it's time to dust off those old trophies
and place them on the mantel again. Get
a pen and paper and start writing down
everything you've done of note.
Everything.
Don't be modest, and don't immedi
ately cast off experiences because they
don't seem important enough. Include
the hashing job, the volunteer tutor
position, the dorm ski trip you orga
nized, the newsletter you designed, the
lab experiments you conducted.
And if the actual salaried positions
you've held don't amount to much,
despair not. You're not alone.
One of the biggest dilemmas faced
by college students entering the work
force is exactly that — they're just enter
ing the workforce and don't have a great
deal of employment background or
experience yet.
And that's OK.
Most employers don't expect you to
come straight from college, holding a
freshly inked degree and a fistful of job
experience.
They're usually more interested in
your potential — what you'll be able to
do in the "real world," and specifically,
at their company. So if you lack true
work experience, you should play up
those activities and projects that best
showcase your abilities and talents —
such as communication, organization
and management skills, as well as com
puter literacy or knowledge of a second
language.
The best way to capture your
talents and skills is with so
called active verbs — verbs
that actually express an
action: "organized," "imple
mented," "supervised," etc. — rather
than passive "to-be" verbs like "was."
These verbs serve as cues to the per
son reading the resume — subtle hints
telling them what skills and abilities

you'd bring to their business.
If you "organized and itinerized" a
dorm ski trip, for example, chances are
you could do the same with business
conferences and meetings.
And if you "supervised" the stage
crew of a dorm musical, you probably
have some of the skills necessarv to

everything
you've ever
done.

As you list your many and varied
accomplishments, you can use some of
the verbs listed at right, or think of oth
ers, to best showcase your abilities.
Once you have a list of what you've
done, you're ready to start drafting the
actual resume.
There are three basic formats your
resume can take: chronological, func
tional or a "combination" resume that
uses characteristics of both.
A chronological resume lists all (or
some) of the positions you've held and
projects you've completed in chronologi
cal order. Under each position, you'd
include a brief synopsis of responsibili
ties and accomplishments.
A functional resume, however, breaks
things up by abilities and like experiences.
For instance, if you are applying for a job
as a research assistant where your main
rcsponsibilites will include writing reports
and memos for your boss, while deliver
ing her instructions to several other staff
members, you may divide your accom
plishments into the categories, research
experience, writing experience and
management experience.
By categorizing your resume this way,
you draw attention away from the fact that
you've never held a job even remotely like this
before, and toward the fact tliat you have solid
