# Selling yourself without totally selling out
## 
### June Cohen 
A just anger rises from deep
in the marrow of your soul.
Bubbling, percolating, it
boils to the surface.
"I am not a number," you
scream, shaking the glazed, robot
ic look from your face in a
moment of intense Ayn Rand-ian
self-realization. "I am a living,
breathing person and will not be
dehumanized!"
Then you realize, no one's listen
ing. And you're still broke.

So you sit yourself back down
and set about working on
your dreaded resume once
again. Putting yourself in the
mindset of a true capitalist,
you break yourself down to the most
basic elements and reconstruct yourself
— using active verbs, of course — as a
marketable, desirable product up for sale
to the highest bidder.
"Nothing too personal," you mutter
bitterly as you list your life accomplish
ments. "Wouldn't want them to know
I'm human or anything."
Okay, okay, quit feeling sorry for
yourself. True, there isn't much room for
things like "nice person" or "likes cats"
on a resume. But that doesn't mean you
can't let yourself shine through.
Besides, drafting your resume can be
a constructive process, one that forces
you to analyze your accomplishments
and goals, while also allowing you to pat
yourself on the back — once you've for
given yourself for not having 10 years of
work experience and a Pulitzer Prize to

show for your 22 years.
So get yourself a tall, frosty glass of
milk, put on those scuff slippers you've
been waiting to take out of the wrapper,
and prepare yourself for a sometimes
encouraging, sometimes-harrowing walk
down memory lane.
Qirst off, you'll want to think
about who this resume is
going to and what aspects of
your life they'd be most inter
ested in.
Since employers spend anywhere
from 10 seconds to three minutes
reviewing a resume, your skills and
qualifications "have got to be apparent
right off the bat," said Virginia Mak, a
counselor with the Career Planning and
Placement Center.
"lt"s kind of like matchmaking,"
Mak suggests. "You've got to make the
match apparent."
If you're applying to jobs in more
than one field, you might find it neces
sary to draft two or more different

resumes — each tailored toward a spe
cific job in a particular field,
For instance, high school science
fair awards may actually prove quite rel
evant when applying for a job as a
research assistant. But if you're also
applying to be a paralegal, those honors
probably won't carry as much weight.
Once you know who your audience
is, it's time to dust off those old trophies
and place them on the mantel again. Get
a pen and paper and start writing down
everything you've done of note.
Everything.
Don't be modest, and don't immedi
ately cast off experiences because they
don't seem important enough. Include
the hashing job, the volunteer tutor
position, the dorm ski trip you orga
nized, the newsletter you designed, the
lab experiments you conducted.
And if the actual salaried positions
you've held don't amount to much,
despair not. You're not alone.
One of the biggest dilemmas faced
by college students entering the work
force is exactly that — they're just enter
ing the workforce and don't have a great
deal of employment background or
experience yet.
And that's OK.
Most employers don't expect you to
come straight from college, holding a
freshly inked degree and a fistful of job
experience.
They're usually more interested in
your potential — what you'll be able to
do in the "real world," and specifically,
at their company. So if you lack true
work experience, you should play up
those activities and projects that best
showcase your abilities and talents —
such as communication, organization
and management skills, as well as com
puter literacy or knowledge of a second
language.
The best way to capture your
talents and skills is with so
called active verbs — verbs
that actually express an
action: "organized," "imple
mented," "supervised," etc. — rather
than passive "to-be" verbs like "was."
These verbs serve as cues to the per
son reading the resume — subtle hints
telling them what skills and abilities

you'd bring to their business.
If you "organized and itinerized" a
dorm ski trip, for example, chances are
you could do the same with business
conferences and meetings.
And if you "supervised" the stage
crew of a dorm musical, you probably
have some of the skills necessarv to

supervise a company division
As you list your many and varied
accomplishments, you can use some of
the verbs listed at right, or think of oth
ers, to best showcase your abilities.
Once you have a list of what you've
done, you're ready to start drafting the
actual resume.
There are three basic formats your
resume can take: chronological, func
tional or a "combination" resume that
uses characteristics of both.
A chronological resume lists all (or
some) of the positions you've held and
projects you've completed in chronologi
cal order. Under each position, you'd
include a brief synopsis of responsibili
ties and accomplishments.
A functional resume, however, breaks
things up by abilities and like experiences.
For instance, if you are applying for a job
as a research assistant where your main
rcsponsibilites will include writing reports
and memos for your boss, while deliver
ing her instructions to several other staff
members, you may divide your accom
plishments into the categories, research
experience, writing experience and
management experience.
By categorizing your resume this way,
you draw attention away from the fact that
you've never held a job even remotely like this
before, and toward the fact tliat you have solid

experience with all the necessary compo
nents of the job: knowledge of science and
research techniques, polished communica
tion skills and management experience.
A combination resume is one that
combines both chronological and func
tional features. It should include some
chronological description of your educa
tion and job experience, while also
pulling out certain features of your quali
fications.
Some skills you may consider
"pulling" are:
• computer knowledge and experi
ence
• technical knowledge of specific
instruments, machinery, etc.
• foreign languages spoken
• hobbies or skills that may be helpful
on the job, such as photography, athletic
ability, mechanical know-how, etc.
• skills in management
Once you have all the words down on
paper, you should turn your eyes toward
presentation.

No resume,
no matter how
well-written, will appear
impressive when poorly printed
with uneven margins on 20-lb copy
paper in an ugly font
To create a high-impact resume, con
sider the following:
• paper quality: Use a substantial
paper, preferably 60-lbs. or heavier for an
impressive, substantial look preferably one
with some texture. (Paper quality is mea
sured in pounds — with the number of
pounds indicating how heavy a ream of the
paper [500 sheets] is. The heavier the
paper, the higher quality.)
• [xi[xt color: The sheets should be some
variety of "not-quite-white" — such as beige,
taupe, off-white, bone, ivory, natural or
cream-colored, to name a few.
• typesetting: Margias should be even.
Typeface should be attractive. Lines should
be clean, uncluttered. Don't clutter the
page by unnecessarily boldfacing, capitaliz-

cial effects and "dingbats" that

j ing and underlining words (at the
j same time).
j Consider having your resumes
professionally typeset. It may save you
time, and your resumes will almost
definitely look more professional.
• printing: Output from anything less
than a laser printer is unacceptable and
unprofessional. You might want to have
high-quality copies made at a copy shop —
using an original printed out on paper from
a regular (300 dpi) laser pnnter or a high
resolution linotronic pnnter (1,000 or more
dpi).
A few last resume blunders to check
for before sealing the envelope are
• spelling and grammatical errors
(Remember, that's Stanford with an "F "),
• verb tense: when listing your
accomplishments, all verbs should be in
same tense,
• margins: make sure all margins line
up and there are no stray "spaces."
• typos, check for all those accidental
"hte"s.

going to and what aspects of
your life they'd be most inter
ested in.
Since employers spend anywhere
from 10 seconds to three minutes
reviewing a resume, your skills and
qualifications "have got to be apparent
right off the bat," said Virginia Mak, a
counselor with the Career Planning and
Placement Center.
"lt"s kind of like matchmaking,"
Mak suggests. "You've got to make the
match apparent."
If you're applying to jobs in more
than one field, you might find it neces
sary to draft two or more different

resumes — each tailored toward a spe
cific job in a particular field,
For instance, high school science
fair awards may actually prove quite rel
evant when applying for a job as a
research assistant. But if you're also
applying to be a paralegal, those honors
probably won't carry as much weight.
Once you know who your audience
is, it's time to dust off those old trophies
and place them on the mantel again. Get
a pen and paper and start writing down
everything you've done of note.
Everything.
Don't be modest, and don't immedi
ately cast off experiences because they
don't seem important enough. Include
the hashing job, the volunteer tutor
position, the dorm ski trip you orga
nized, the newsletter you designed, the
lab experiments you conducted.
And if the actual salaried positions
you've held don't amount to much,
despair not. You're not alone.
One of the biggest dilemmas faced
by college students entering the work
force is exactly that — they're just enter
ing the workforce and don't have a great
deal of employment background or
experience yet.
And that's OK.
Most employers don't expect you to
come straight from college, holding a
freshly inked degree and a fistful of job
experience.
They're usually more interested in
your potential — what you'll be able to
do in the "real world," and specifically,
at their company. So if you lack true
work experience, you should play up
those activities and projects that best
showcase your abilities and talents —
such as communication, organization
and management skills, as well as com
puter literacy or knowledge of a second
language.
The best way to capture your
talents and skills is with so
called active verbs — verbs
that actually express an
action: "organized," "imple
mented," "supervised," etc. — rather
than passive "to-be" verbs like "was."
These verbs serve as cues to the per
son reading the resume — subtle hints
telling them what skills and abilities

you'd bring to their business.
If you "organized and itinerized" a
dorm ski trip, for example, chances are
you could do the same with business
conferences and meetings.
And if you "supervised" the stage
crew of a dorm musical, you probably
have some of the skills necessarv to

supervise a company division
As you list your many and varied
accomplishments, you can use some of
the verbs listed at right, or think of oth
ers, to best showcase your abilities.
Once you have a list of what you've
done, you're ready to start drafting the
actual resume.
There are three basic formats your
resume can take: chronological, func
tional or a "combination" resume that
uses characteristics of both.
A chronological resume lists all (or
some) of the positions you've held and
projects you've completed in chronologi
cal order. Under each position, you'd
include a brief synopsis of responsibili
ties and accomplishments.
A functional resume, however, breaks
things up by abilities and like experiences.
For instance, if you are applying for a job
as a research assistant where your main
rcsponsibilites will include writing reports
and memos for your boss, while deliver
ing her instructions to several other staff
members, you may divide your accom
plishments into the categories, research
experience, writing experience and
management experience.
By categorizing your resume this way,
you draw attention away from the fact that
you've never held a job even remotely like this
before, and toward the fact tliat you have solid

experience with all the necessary compo
nents of the job: knowledge of science and
research techniques, polished communica
tion skills and management experience.
A combination resume is one that
combines both chronological and func
tional features. It should include some
chronological description of your educa
tion and job experience, while also
pulling out certain features of your quali
fications.
Some skills you may consider
"pulling" are:
• computer knowledge and experi
ence
• technical knowledge of specific
instruments, machinery, etc.
• foreign languages spoken
• hobbies or skills that may be helpful
on the job, such as photography, athletic
ability, mechanical know-how, etc.
• skills in management
Once you have all the words down on
paper, you should turn your eyes toward
presentation.

No resume,
no matter how
well-written, will appear
impressive when poorly printed
with uneven margins on 20-lb copy
paper in an ugly font
To create a high-impact resume, con
sider the following:
• paper quality: Use a substantial
paper, preferably 60-lbs. or heavier for an
impressive, substantial look preferably one
with some texture. (Paper quality is mea
sured in pounds — with the number of
pounds indicating how heavy a ream of the
paper [500 sheets] is. The heavier the
paper, the higher quality.)
• [xi[xt color: The sheets should be some
variety of "not-quite-white" — such as beige,
taupe, off-white, bone, ivory, natural or
cream-colored, to name a few.
• typesetting: Margias should be even.
Typeface should be attractive. Lines should
be clean, uncluttered. Don't clutter the
page by unnecessarily boldfacing, capitaliz-

cial effects and "dingbats" that

j ing and underlining words (at the
j same time).
j Consider having your resumes
professionally typeset. It may save you
time, and your resumes will almost
definitely look more professional.
• printing: Output from anything less
than a laser printer is unacceptable and
unprofessional. You might want to have
high-quality copies made at a copy shop —
using an original printed out on paper from
a regular (300 dpi) laser pnnter or a high
resolution linotronic pnnter (1,000 or more
dpi).
A few last resume blunders to check
for before sealing the envelope are
• spelling and grammatical errors
(Remember, that's Stanford with an "F "),
• verb tense: when listing your
accomplishments, all verbs should be in
same tense,
• margins: make sure all margins line
up and there are no stray "spaces."
• typos, check for all those accidental
"hte"s.

You can draw
attention away
from the fact
that you've
never held a
job remotely
like this
before.
A just anger rises from deep
in the marrow of your soul.
Bubbling, percolating, it
boils to the surface.
"I am not a number," you
scream, shaking the glazed, robot
ic look from your face in a
moment of intense Ayn Rand-ian
self-realization. "I am a living,
breathing person and will not be
dehumanized!"
Then you realize, no one's listen
ing. And you're still broke.

So you sit yourself back down
and set about working on
your dreaded resume once
again. Putting yourself in the
mindset of a true capitalist,
you break yourself down to the most
basic elements and reconstruct yourself
— using active verbs, of course — as a
marketable, desirable product up for sale
to the highest bidder.
"Nothing too personal," you mutter
bitterly as you list your life accomplish
ments. "Wouldn't want them to know
I'm human or anything."
Okay, okay, quit feeling sorry for
yourself. True, there isn't much room for
things like "nice person" or "likes cats"
on a resume. But that doesn't mean you
can't let yourself shine through.
Besides, drafting your resume can be
a constructive process, one that forces
you to analyze your accomplishments
and goals, while also allowing you to pat
yourself on the back — once you've for
given yourself for not having 10 years of
work experience and a Pulitzer Prize to

show for your 22 years.
So get yourself a tall, frosty glass of
milk, put on those scuff slippers you've
been waiting to take out of the wrapper,
and prepare yourself for a sometimes
encouraging, sometimes-harrowing walk
down memory lane.
Qirst off, you'll want to think
about who this resume is
going to and what aspects of
your life they'd be most inter
ested in.

come straight from college, holding a
freshly inked degree and a fistful of job
experience.
They're usually more interested in
your potential — what you'll be able to
do in the "real world," and specifically,
at their company. So if you lack true
work experience, you should play up
those activities and projects that best
showcase your abilities and talents —
such as communication, organization
and management skills, as well as com
puter literacy or knowledge of a second
language.
The best way to capture your
talents and skills is with so
called active verbs — verbs
that actually express an
action: "organized," "imple
mented," "supervised," etc. — rather
than passive "to-be" verbs like "was."
These verbs serve as cues to the per
son reading the resume — subtle hints
telling them what skills and abilities

you'd bring to their business.
If you "organized and itinerized" a
dorm ski trip, for example, chances are
you could do the same with business
conferences and meetings.
And if you "supervised" the stage
crew of a dorm musical, you probably
have some of the skills necessarv to

supervise a company division
As you list your many and varied
accomplishments, you can use some of
the verbs listed at right, or think of oth
ers, to best showcase your abilities.
Once you have a list of what you've
done, you're ready to start drafting the
actual resume.
There are three basic formats your
resume can take: chronological, func
tional or a "combination" resume that
uses characteristics of both.
A chronological resume lists all (or
some) of the positions you've held and
projects you've completed in chronologi
cal order. Under each position, you'd
include a brief synopsis of responsibili
ties and accomplishments.
A functional resume, however, breaks
things up by abilities and like experiences.
For instance, if you are applying for a job
as a research assistant where your main
rcsponsibilites will include writing reports
and memos for your boss, while deliver
ing her instructions to several other staff
members, you may divide your accom
plishments into the categories, research
experience, writing experience and
management experience.
By categorizing your resume this way,
you draw attention away from the fact that
you've never held a job even remotely like this
before, and toward the fact tliat you have solid

experience with all the necessary compo
nents of the job: knowledge of science and
research techniques, polished communica
tion skills and management experience.
A combination resume is one that
combines both chronological and func
tional features. It should include some
chronological description of your educa
tion and job experience, while also
pulling out certain features of your quali
fications.
Some skills you may consider
"pulling" are:
• computer knowledge and experi
ence
• technical knowledge of specific
instruments, machinery, etc.
• foreign languages spoken
• hobbies or skills that may be helpful
on the job, such as photography, athletic
ability, mechanical know-how, etc.
• skills in management
Once you have all the words down on
paper, you should turn your eyes toward
presentation.

No resume,
no matter how
well-written, will appear
impressive when poorly printed
with uneven margins on 20-lb copy
paper in an ugly font
To create a high-impact resume, con
sider the following:
• paper quality: Use a substantial
paper, preferably 60-lbs. or heavier for an
impressive, substantial look preferably one
with some texture. (Paper quality is mea
sured in pounds — with the number of
pounds indicating how heavy a ream of the
paper [500 sheets] is. The heavier the
paper, the higher quality.)
• [xi[xt color: The sheets should be some
variety of "not-quite-white" — such as beige,
taupe, off-white, bone, ivory, natural or
cream-colored, to name a few.
• typesetting: Margias should be even.
Typeface should be attractive. Lines should
be clean, uncluttered. Don't clutter the
page by unnecessarily boldfacing, capitaliz-

cial effects and "dingbats" that

j ing and underlining words (at the
j same time).
j Consider having your resumes
professionally typeset. It may save you
time, and your resumes will almost
definitely look more professional.
• printing: Output from anything less
than a laser printer is unacceptable and
unprofessional. You might want to have
high-quality copies made at a copy shop —
using an original printed out on paper from
a regular (300 dpi) laser pnnter or a high
resolution linotronic pnnter (1,000 or more
dpi).
A few last resume blunders to check
for before sealing the envelope are
• spelling and grammatical errors
(Remember, that's Stanford with an "F "),
• verb tense: when listing your
accomplishments, all verbs should be in
same tense,
• margins: make sure all margins line
up and there are no stray "spaces."
• typos, check for all those accidental
"hte"s.

You can draw

from the fact
that you've

like this
before.
A just anger rises from deep
in the marrow of your soul.
Bubbling, percolating, it
boils to the surface.
"I am not a number," you
scream, shaking the glazed, robot
ic look from your face in a
moment of intense Ayn Rand-ian
self-realization. "I am a living,
breathing person and will not be
dehumanized!"
Then you realize, no one's listen
ing. And you're still broke.

So you sit yourself back down
and set about working on
your dreaded resume once
again. Putting yourself in the
mindset of a true capitalist,
you break yourself down to the most
basic elements and reconstruct yourself
— using active verbs, of course — as a
marketable, desirable product up for sale
to the highest bidder.
"Nothing too personal," you mutter
bitterly as you list your life accomplish
ments. "Wouldn't want them to know
I'm human or anything."
Okay, okay, quit feeling sorry for
yourself. True, there isn't much room for
things like "nice person" or "likes cats"
on a resume. But that doesn't mean you
can't let yourself shine through.
Besides, drafting your resume can be
a constructive process, one that forces
you to analyze your accomplishments
and goals, while also allowing you to pat
yourself on the back — once you've for
given yourself for not having 10 years of
work experience and a Pulitzer Prize to

show for your 22 years.
So get yourself a tall, frosty glass of
milk, put on those scuff slippers you've
been waiting to take out of the wrapper,
and prepare yourself for a sometimes
encouraging, sometimes-harrowing walk
down memory lane.
Qirst off, you'll want to think
about who this resume is
going to and what aspects of
your life they'd be most inter
ested in.
Since employers spend anywhere
from 10 seconds to three minutes
reviewing a resume, your skills and
qualifications "have got to be apparent
right off the bat," said Virginia Mak, a
counselor with the Career Planning and
Placement Center.
"lt"s kind of like matchmaking,"
Mak suggests. "You've got to make the
match apparent."
If you're applying to jobs in more
than one field, you might find it neces
sary to draft two or more different

resumes — each tailored toward a spe
cific job in a particular field,
For instance, high school science
fair awards may actually prove quite rel
evant when applying for a job as a
research assistant. But if you're also
applying to be a paralegal, those honors
probably won't carry as much weight.
Once you know who your audience
is, it's time to dust off those old trophies
and place them on the mantel again. Get
a pen and paper and start writing down
everything you've done of note.
Everything.
Don't be modest, and don't immedi
ately cast off experiences because they
don't seem important enough. Include
the hashing job, the volunteer tutor
position, the dorm ski trip you orga
nized, the newsletter you designed, the
lab experiments you conducted.
And if the actual salaried positions
you've held don't amount to much,
despair not. You're not alone.
One of the biggest dilemmas faced
by college students entering the work
force is exactly that — they're just enter
ing the workforce and don't have a great
deal of employment background or
experience yet.
And that's OK.
