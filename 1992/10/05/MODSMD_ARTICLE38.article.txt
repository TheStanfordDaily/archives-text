# Facing the interview

The interview is probably the most
anticipated and feared aspect of any
application process. Although
opening a thin response letter may be
harrowing, interviewing justifiably cre
ates maximal tension for several reasons.
Every application you sent enumerated
your qualifications and experience. You've
been granted an interview because the
firm believes in your ability to meet the
challenges of the job. Now you must
prove your worth in person.

You must leave a strong positive
impression or you'll be just another quali
fied applicant without an offer. With so
much riding on one short meeting, the
pressure inevitably mounts.
According to Lvnne Dotson of the
Career Planning and Placement Center,
an interview is not a test or an inquisi
tion, but a matching process where both
you and the interviewer can determine
your compatibility with the company and
your potential for success and happiness
there.
Successful interviewing comes naturally
from confidence and preparation, Dotson
said. And a comfortable approach to the
interview will help you create a positive
and relaxed atmosphere.
Preparation is vital, Dotson said. While
it's not imperative to know every detail of
the company's history, a familiarity with
the progress the company has made in
the past and its current endeavors is high
ly advised.
Odds are you will know a fair portion
of this information from your preliminary
job search or from reading an annual
report, so refresh your memory and be
accurate, she said.
Dotson also said to expect some of the
classic questions. In particular, she insisted,
"Be ready to tell your interviewer why you
applied to that company."
This answer should not be given extem
poraneously. Think about the reasons well
before the interview, she recommended.
Interrogate yourself and form a concrete
response. Your interviewer wants to know
what really attracts you to the company and

what career path you plan to pursue, she
said.
"Your answers should be specific
whenever possible," Dotson said. "Follow
'yes' and no' responses with descriptive
and explanatory remarks.
"Refer to your past experiences and
use anecdotes to your favor," she added.
"Employers are interested in getting to
know you and your special talents."
Then there's the trick question. You
thought maybe there wouldn't be one,
but you just heard it. Relax, the purpose
of the question is not to get a specific
answer but to measure the fluidity and
thoughtfulness of your response Most
likely there is no right answer
Be sure to prepare an entire package for
the interviewer. Even if you will never
wear a suit to work, don one for the inter
view. Along with respectful dress, an
astute mind, a firm handshake and a smile
are necessities. Let your interviewer know
you are excited to be at the interview.
Genuine enthusiasm is key.
According to Dotson, if this company
is really your first choice it's okay to
express this sentiment, but offer solid
reasons to support your claim. "Your
sincerity will be apparent," she said.
Besides impressing your prospective
employer, the interview presents a
unique opportunity for you to learn more
about your future position and the par
ticulars of that company. Just as the
interviewer is looking for certain qualifi
cations and personal characteristics to
meet the firm's requirements, you should
be investigating the company to see if it

eds.
It is important
to view the interview
not as an intrusive barrage
of hypothetical questions, but as
a bilateral investigation. You may
meet the desires of a few companies, but
they may not be able to fulfill your goals.
Be selective and find the firm that is com
patible with your philosophies and
lifestyle
Take control of your interview. Sell
yourself but be prepared to do some shop
ping as well. Find out what the firm will
offer you. Let them explain why you
should work for them and not their com
petitors. This provides you with much
valuable information and demonstrates
the confidence you possess.
If you have a bad interview, it may
not have been your fault. Some inter
viewers have difficulty expressing them
selves. If you did not perform up to your
expectations, don't be discouraged and
try not to let these emotions show
through while you are still at the inter
view.
Remember, you are unique and there
is a "yes" out there for you Maintain
your diligence and believe in yourself.
There's truth to the notion that a job
search is a numbers game Every "no"
brings you closer to the "yes." Convert
the anxietv into enthusiasm and you'll
be primed for a successful interview.
