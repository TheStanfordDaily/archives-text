# Basic Black and 'Power Earrings'
## Do's and don'ts of office fashion 
### Kimberly Chrisman 
Gone are the days when a girl could look dowdy at
the office and get away with it.

So decreed etiquette expert Elizabeth Gregj;

Mac Gibbon in her 1926 book
"Manners in Business." For better
or worse, her advice still applies
today, to men as well as women.
But everyone knows the men
have it easy — the toughest ques
tion a businessman faces in the
morning is which white shirt to
wear with his blue suit and striped
tie. When it comes to dressing the
part, what's a working girl to do?
Whatever the field, the key to
dressing well is dressing appropri
ately, taking one's cues from others
in the office and bearing in mind

that some fields, such as com
munications, are more laid
back than others, like corpo
rate law.
While the rat race is no
beauty contest, an employee
(or prospective employee)
who looks neat, clean and
up-to-date will automatically
have an edge on her "dowdi
er" co-workers.

Black is a business girl's
best bet.
Mac Gibbon liked black
because it went with every
thing. It still does. A mix and
match wardrobe is good
business sense, especially on
a starting salary.
Black is chic, serious and
easily translated into after
hours garb. It works in all
seasons and doesn't show ink
stains. They don't call it
"basic" for nothing.
As a rule, however, color
doesn't matter. It's practicali
ty that Mac Gibbon was after,

and today's career woman should be,
too.
This doesn't mean jeans and tennis
shoes are proper business attire just
because they're durable and feel good.
Neither are fluorescent nor loud,
bright prints appropriate for the
office — or anywhere else, for that
matter.
And while pants are elegant as well
as practical, they are not always accepted
in business. Except, of course, on men.
The hair should be well shampooed
every two weeks, whether it needs it
or not.
Chances are, it does. In fact, it
probably wouldn't hurt to sham-

poo every couple of days. Proper hygiene is as impor
tant as proper attire in the business world, for health
reasons as much as any other.
; Mac Gibbon's book offers several creative sugges-

tions on how to eliminate body odor. Today, we have
deodorant. Use it.
It's also a good idea to keep a toothbrush and tooth
paste at work, for all those high-powered lunches in

or
the executive dining room.
A word about make-up. In
1936, no "decent" woman wore
make-up. Today, anyone car
wear it, as long as it's worn in
moderation and not applied ai
one's desk, with one's comput
er screen for a mirror. The
same applies to perfume
despite Mac Gibbon's con
tention that "perfume . . . is
out of place in business.''

The verdict against long ea
rings is unanimous.

Long earrings have certainly
come into their own since
Mac Gibbon's day. In some
offices, "power earrings" are cle
riguer among the upper ranks.
But any accessory ceases to he
attractive when it becomes dis-

tracting or prevents the
wearer from doing her
job.
Thus, lace stockings,
micro-minis and feather
boas should not be
worn at the office, nor
should spiked heels,
excessive jewelry and
10-inch fingernails.
Likewise, hats and
gloves are inappropriate
indoors, unless, of
course, they are part of
a uniform. (Mac Gibbon
devoted an entire chap
ter to the question of
whether a "lady" should
remove her hat at the
office.
Modern ladies have

more important things
to worry about.)
Of course, these
mandates vary from
office to office, from

coast to coast, from coun
try to country.

businesswomen wear uniforms to
work. And the higher a woman

climbs on the corporate
ladder, the more free
dom she has to dress as
she pleases.
In the immortal
words of Elizabeth Gregg
Mac Gibbon, "When a
woman has reached an
executive position, she

should determine such things
for herself."
