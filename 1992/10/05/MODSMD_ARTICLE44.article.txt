"Sooo, what are you doing after graduation?"
asks Aunt Millie.
"Graduating this year are you? Got a job lined up
yet?" quizzes Uncle Alfred.
"Did you hear your cousin Herb was offered a
$45,000-a-year job last week?" nags your mother in
that sticky-sweet yet oh-so-sadistic voice.
Yes, seniors, believe it or not, your last year has
begun. And inevitably, so have those "what are you
going to do now" questions.
A few of you can probably whip out your power
suits and recruiting calendars and appease those
inquiring minds, but most of you are probably real
izing that — nearly four years and $80,000 later —
you're still pretty clueless.
So, what's to do when you don't know what to
do?
The first step in deciding what "life after
Stanford" holds for you requires a little self-intro
spection, says Virginia Mak of the Career Planning
and Placement Center. "Identify your passion, or if
you're not passionate about something, at least your
areas of interest."
Secondly, think about what skills you have and
what type of environment you like to work in. Do
you like to work with people or alone? Are you ana
lytical? creative? detail-oriented? Do you like to
wear suits to work or Birkenstocks?
The CPPC has a variety of free services, includ
ing counselors and tools like the Strong Interest
Inventory to help assess your strengths and inter
ests, and match them with potential jobs or careers.
Once you've outlined these areas, remember that
flexibility is key, says Mak. "Don't worry about finding
the perfect career," she says. "Often, you can apply a
group of skills to a number of different situations."
Today, more than ever, recent graduates are pur
suing options — such as public service, internships
and travel — that would have been considered
"alternative" only a few years ago. "But 'alternative'
is not the loser option," says Mak. "People are tak
ing more risks, finding out more about themselves
It's a healthy way to look at the future."
Despite the recession, Stanford graduates are get
ting jobs at about the same rate as in the late '80s,
estimates Mak. But even so, more and more grads
are taking "the road less traveled."
"People's values are changing," says Mak "The
traditional corporate track has fewer opportunities

and the malaise of Wall Street has led more people
to explore less traditional options" such as the
Peace Corps, Teach for America or teaching English
abroad, she says.
Recent graduates also are finding more positions
with smaller employers. "They offer greater flexibili
ty, greater latitude and more freedom than some of
the large employers, where there's lots of people
around," said Mak.
To get you started, the CPPC offers a variety of
services, including individual counseling, work-

shops, job listings and on-campus recruiting
A career counselor can help students: 1) assess
their interests, skills and values, 2) identify their
goals and objectives, 3) translate that information
into a meaningful career or first job and 4) under
stand the nuts and bolts of getting a job.
Before meeting with an individual counselor, it is
necessary to complete a "getting started" workshop
about the self-help resources at the CPPC.
Upcoming workshops will be held Oct. 7 and Oct.
14. A counseling appointment can be made in per
son or by calling 725-1789.
The CPPC also offers a variety of workshops on
interviewing, the world of work, the Strong
Inventory and job-finding strategies.
The CPPC's extensive career library houses a
variety of resources about different careers, resume

writing, job hunting and interviewing. Job binders,
internship announcements and other job search
materials are also located in the library.
An alumni contact service is provided jointly by
the CPPC and Bowman Alumni Association It is a
valuable resource since "80 percent of people find
their employment by word of mouth," says Mak.
On-campus recruiting is another convenient
means of career placement. More than 400 compa
nies and organizations — representing fields rang
ing from accounting and consulting to aeronautics
and summer camps — visit campus each year.
A $20 fee, which also covers a Reference File
Service, is charged for recruiting registration The
Reference File allows you to organize your curricu
lum vitae and letters of recommendation, and to
have your dossier sent to prospective employers.
In addition to the CPPC, the Career Action
Center in Palo Alto can assist in your search for "life
after Stanford " The goal of the Center is to teach
career self-reliance, says volunteer Sara Rice.
The Center's extensive library features a collec
tion of videotapes on different careers and compa
nies. Descriptions of over 1,200 Bay Area employers
and nearly 5,000 job listings per month can also be
found at the library.
In addition, the Center has organized support
and networking groups.
Deciding what you're going to do after gradua
tion is tough, and explaining your choices to others
may be even harder. But if you map out a plan,
things should be easier, says Mak.
"If you've done your homework, they'll respect
what you want," she says. "Many students' parents
had linear career paths. They were guaranteed sta
bility and loyalty was valued. Today, people follow
much more spiral career paths."
So what if you were a Human Biology major who
wants to go teach English in Asia?
"Academics don't always have to correlate with
what you do afterwards," says Mak "Adaptability is
the important thing."

The Career Action Center in Palo Alto is located at 445
Shrrmun Ave It's open Monday, Wednesday and Fnday
from 9 to 5, Tuesday and Thursday from 9 to 9, and
Saturdays for members only from 9to I Yearly member

flexibility is key, says Mak. "Don't worry about finding
the perfect career," she says. "Often, you can apply a
group of skills to a number of different situations."
Today, more than ever, recent graduates are pur
suing options — such as public service, internships
and travel — that would have been considered
"alternative" only a few years ago. "But 'alternative'
is not the loser option," says Mak. "People are tak
ing more risks, finding out more about themselves
It's a healthy way to look at the future."
Despite the recession, Stanford graduates are get
ting jobs at about the same rate as in the late '80s,
estimates Mak. But even so, more and more grads
are taking "the road less traveled."
"People's values are changing," says Mak "The
traditional corporate track has fewer opportunities

and the malaise of Wall Street has led more people
to explore less traditional options" such as the
Peace Corps, Teach for America or teaching English
abroad, she says.
Recent graduates also are finding more positions
with smaller employers. "They offer greater flexibili
ty, greater latitude and more freedom than some of
the large employers, where there's lots of people
around," said Mak.

shops, job listings and on-campus recruiting
A career counselor can help students: 1) assess
their interests, skills and values, 2) identify their
goals and objectives, 3) translate that information
into a meaningful career or first job and 4) under
stand the nuts and bolts of getting a job.
Before meeting with an individual counselor, it is
necessary to complete a "getting started" workshop
about the self-help resources at the CPPC.
Upcoming workshops will be held Oct. 7 and Oct.
14. A counseling appointment can be made in per
son or by calling 725-1789.
The CPPC also offers a variety of workshops on
interviewing, the world of work, the Strong
Inventory and job-finding strategies.
The CPPC's extensive career library houses a
variety of resources about different careers, resume

writing, job hunting and interviewing. Job binders,
internship announcements and other job search
materials are also located in the library.
An alumni contact service is provided jointly by
the CPPC and Bowman Alumni Association It is a
valuable resource since "80 percent of people find
their employment by word of mouth," says Mak.
On-campus recruiting is another convenient
means of career placement. More than 400 compa
nies and organizations — representing fields rang
ing from accounting and consulting to aeronautics
and summer camps — visit campus each year.
A $20 fee, which also covers a Reference File
Service, is charged for recruiting registration The
Reference File allows you to organize your curricu
lum vitae and letters of recommendation, and to
have your dossier sent to prospective employers.
In addition to the CPPC, the Career Action
Center in Palo Alto can assist in your search for "life
after Stanford " The goal of the Center is to teach
career self-reliance, says volunteer Sara Rice.
The Center's extensive library features a collec
tion of videotapes on different careers and compa
nies. Descriptions of over 1,200 Bay Area employers
and nearly 5,000 job listings per month can also be
found at the library.
In addition, the Center has organized support
and networking groups.
Deciding what you're going to do after gradua
tion is tough, and explaining your choices to others
may be even harder. But if you map out a plan,
things should be easier, says Mak.
"If you've done your homework, they'll respect
what you want," she says. "Many students' parents
had linear career paths. They were guaranteed sta
bility and loyalty was valued. Today, people follow
much more spiral career paths."
So what if you were a Human Biology major who
wants to go teach English in Asia?
"Academics don't always have to correlate with
what you do afterwards," says Mak "Adaptability is
the important thing."

"Sooo, what are you doing after graduation?"
asks Aunt Millie.
"Graduating this year are you? Got a job lined up
yet?" quizzes Uncle Alfred.
"Did you hear your cousin Herb was offered a
$45,000-a-year job last week?" nags your mother in
that sticky-sweet yet oh-so-sadistic voice.
Yes, seniors, believe it or not, your last year has
begun. And inevitably, so have those "what are you
going to do now" questions.
A few of you can probably whip out your power
suits and recruiting calendars and appease those
inquiring minds, but most of you are probably real
izing that — nearly four years and $80,000 later —
you're still pretty clueless.
So, what's to do when you don't know what to
do?
The first step in deciding what "life after
Stanford" holds for you requires a little self-intro
spection, says Virginia Mak of the Career Planning
and Placement Center. "Identify your passion, or if
you're not passionate about something, at least your
areas of interest."
Secondly, think about what skills you have and
what type of environment you like to work in. Do
you like to work with people or alone? Are you ana
lytical? creative? detail-oriented? Do you like to
wear suits to work or Birkenstocks?
The CPPC has a variety of free services, includ
ing counselors and tools like the Strong Interest
Inventory to help assess your strengths and inter
ests, and match them with potential jobs or careers.
Once you've outlined these areas, remember that
flexibility is key, says Mak. "Don't worry about finding
the perfect career," she says. "Often, you can apply a
