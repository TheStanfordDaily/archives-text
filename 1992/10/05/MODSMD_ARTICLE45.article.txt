# MOVING to a city by the bay
## 
### tracy schroeder 
As you move into your tiny new room in Terra
House, Wilbur Hall or, worse vet, one of the
remaining Manzanita Park trailers, don't brood
over your sorry luck in the Draw.
Instead, thank your lucky stars and kiss the
ground, for sooner than you think, you will have
spent your allotted time in the pristine environment
and luxurious accommodations provided here on
campus, and you will be abandoned without shelter
in one of the most expensive places to live in the
United States — the Bay Area.
Housing prices alone are a strong argument for
packing up your bags and moving to Nebraska . . .
but even jaded native Californians have to admit that

in some ways the state, particularly the Bay Area, has
a lot to offer, including diverse communities, fre
quently sunny skies, a vital arts scene and close prox
imity to both the ocean and San Francisco Bay.
Negatives to take into consideration, however, are
the high cost of living, a high — and rising — crime
rate, an economy currently hard hit by recession, a
state government that wrote lOUs for nearly two
months before passing a budget, infamous traffic and
increasingly polluted air.
If you do choose to stay in the Bay Area after grad
uation, finding housing should top your list of things
to do. If you plan on staying in the Stanford/Palo
Alto/Menlo Park area, you should use campus
resources such as the Housing Center, Folio comput
er listings and the Tresidder bulletin board to speed
your search along.
If you are not set on staying close to campus, take
a deep breath, brace yourself and pull out that news
paper. Classified sections are always a good place to
start. If you have a particular region of the Bay Area
in mind, you can focus your newspaper search
accordingly.
First, find a good Bay Area map. (See MAPS.)
For hardy commuters and many first-time home
buyers, there are communities to the north and east
of these East Bay cities, such as Concord, Walnut
Creek, San Ramon, Pleasanton, Livermore, Tracy
and Stockton.
To find South Bay housing — for those Silicon
Valley types — start with the San Jose Mercury
News Classifieds. If you're looking in San
Francisco, the San Francisco Chronicle and San
Francisco Examiner will both be helpful.
The Chronicle, Examiner and the
Mercury News list some Peninsula
accommodations as well. For a
r ocus on the Peninsula, try the
Peninsula Times Tribune.
For Marin County infor
mation, the Marin
Independent Journal
will be a good place
to start. And on the
East Bay, good
newspaper
resources
include

the Oakland Tribune, the Daily Review and the Argus.
Behind the wheel — or not
Many Californians commute a considerable dis
tance to work — some driving as long as two hours
one way Most commute into San Francisco or the
Silicon Valley (South Bay); however, people work in
all areas.
If you can live in the same city where you work,
do it. If not, try to find accommodations close to
public transportation. In the East Bay, Bay Area Rapid
Transit (BART) is the best way to get around. BART
will take you across the Bay to San Francisco, north
east to Concord and Richmond and all along the East
Bay from Oakland to Fremont.
On the Peninsula, Caltrain is your best bet.
Caltrain runs from San Francisco down to San Jose.
Both BART and Caltrain are usually punctual and
well-maintained.
It is important to note that there is no public
transportation out of Marin County into San
Francisco or the East Bay, with the exception of the
bus system. Most Marin County residents work in
one of these two regions, which results in a steady
flow of traffic on both Highway 580 East to Oakland
and Highway 101 South to the Golden Gate Bridge
and San Francisco.
Money changes everything
The Bay Area is generally an expensive place to
live. While rents do vary from one region to another,
these variations are not usually dramatic if the type of
housing desired is consistent.
Expect to pay anywhere from $450 to $800 per
month for a studio apartment, depending on how
polished you want the apartment and surrounding
neighborhood to be. Often a less expensive option is
renting a room in someone's home, which ranges in
cost from $300 to $500 per month.
Rents in Marin County, San Francisco, and on the
Peninsula tend to be higher than rents in the East Bay
and South Bay. This general trend is due to differ
ences in neighborhood demographics, history and
proximity to both the ocean and San Francisco.
When inquiring about rental prices, make sure to ask
the landlord if the city has rent control, and if so, what
type. Rent control is a form of city-administered regula
tion which places limits on the landlord's ability to raise
rent. Several Bay Area cities do have rent control, but
others do not, and specific regulations may vary.
Doing the safety dance
Generally speaking, Marin County and the
Peninsula tend to be the safest areas in the Bay Area.
Incomes tend to be higher, crime rates lower and
police forces better equipped to handle problems.
Urban centers such as San Francisco and Oakland
can be more dangerous due to worsening problems of
homelessness and violent crime. Of the two cities,
Oakland is the most troubled, suffering severe eco
nomic instability resulting from the 1989 earthquake,
the recent Oakland Hills fire and the current recession.
Drug trafficking and gang violence are widespread.
San Jose has also developed a gang problem in
recent years. However, no city is ever free of problems.

Somewhere that's green
Of all of Bay Area regions, San Francisco is the
most diverse and cosmopolitan. Cafes, restaurants,
night clubs and theaters are numerous and well
patronized. San Francisco architecture — narrow
Victorian houses and apartments, high-rise buildings
and a classic City Flail — is distinctive.
On the other hand, it is more difficult to get
around, by bus or by car, than in suburban areas.
Also, in many neighborhoods the only major grocery
store available is Safeway.
Marin County, while less diverse than San
Francisco, might be termed the New Age capital of
the Bay area, with its taste for the arts, the outdoors
and health foods. Some claim that "California
Cuisine" was invented in Marin County.
What's more, Mt. Tamalpais and the Golden Gate
National Recreation area are just to the west of the
cities, and there arc more trees and wildlife in resi
dential areas than in other parts of the Bay Area.
Fhe Peninsula cities have relatively long histories,
reaching back some 125 years to the completion of the
Southern Pacific Railroad from San Jose to San
Francisco, now known as Caltrain. The cities have old
fashioned town centers — often filled with modern,
expensive shops — usually focused on one or two long
main streets that branch off from the local train station.
Residential areas are suburban and well kept, and
populations are generally less diverse than those of
San Francisco and much of the Fast Bay.
By contrast, most East Bay cities south of Oakland
have emerged within the last 50 to 75 years, during
California's dramatic growth spurt. There tends to be
more tract housing and what could be termed subur
ban "sprawl." However, communities are diverse and
fairly safe, supermarkets large and rents slightly lower.
The cities of the South Bay, particularly the city of
San Jose, have recently been making a concentrated
effort to revitalize their downtown areas and celebrate
their cultural diversity by enthusiastically supporting
the arts. This area has a particularly large Latino pop
ulation that is increasingly getting involved in com
munity affairs.
Thinking about the weather
Climates differ surprisingly in the Bay Area, espe
cially during the spring and summer months. Winters
are more uniform: mild to cold in most areas.
San Francisco summers tend to be foggy and cold.
However, fog intensity can vary significantly from
neighborhood to neighborhood. San Francisco does
have its sunny summer days, but the temperature
rarely rises above 85 degrees.
Oakland and Berkeley also tend to get some of the
ocean fog. Generally, as one goes north, south or east
from each of these three cities, the temperature rises
at a rale of about five degrees per 10 miles.
The East Bay is generally drier and warmer than
the Peninsula, San Francisco and Marin County, as it
is farther from the ocean and receives warm air from
inland areas further to the east.
The South Bay is the hottest region in the Bay
Area, often five to 10 degrees warmer than the East
Bay.
