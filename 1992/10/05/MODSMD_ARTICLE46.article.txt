# Sleeping your way up down the corporate ladder

### joel stein 
Cold. Cold and dark. And sometimes wet,
depending where you are. That's what life
after Stanford is like. Trust me, 1 know.
That's why I'm still here.
No, my little Melrose-smittcn friends, 1 myself
have never ventured too far from this tropical Isle
Paradiso, but I have seen enough of this great, big
world to know one thing: You don't want to go
out there. Not even with an umbrella
Just one short month ago, 1 sabbaticalled into
the heart of that crazy working world, where oth
erwise powerful men are subdued through a
continuous — yet subtle — pressure on their
neck, all too often in paisley. Women, of course,
receive less subtle methods — which, oddly
enough, also often involve pressure on the back
of the neck.
The heart of that jungle was Madison Avenue,
New York City, where 1 worked for the Periscope
section of Newsweek. It was there, to my deep
surprise and chagrin, 1 discovered that from 9 to
5, people don't have a sense of humor.
1 had learned this lesson a thousand times —
mostly from the scene in "Wall Street" right
before Daryl Hannah takes off her blouse. But, in
a moment of unadulterated hubris, 1 convinced
myself the people at Newsweek would be differ
ent. They'd be just like me — only not as good
looking.
But, like everything else in life — since that
first time as a curious, yet harmless baby boy I
discovered that not all women lactate — 1 had to
learn the hard way.
People in the executive world, 1 soon discov
ered, never speak to each other directly.
Instead, they hold meetings, where they can
pretend they're addressing a large, metaphysical
body: "I think we should all help Benny out,
since she's effectively useless and will soon be
out of a job." And when there's no way around
speaking to each other directly, they use inter
office e-mail.
Like a 17-year-old girl, e-mail masquerades
itself as a harmless way to save time But, in reali
ty, e-mail swiftly snuffs out any normal social life
in the office. People no longer talk face-to-face,
or bitch about the boss at the water cooler In the
long run, this whole situation may save a lot of
marriages, but it doesn't do much for office
morale.
Desperately trying to fit in, 1 made a yeoman
like effort at e-mail banter By the end of my
eighth week, 1 still hadn't succeeded in meeting
any of the people on my hall, but I had plenty of
meaningful conversations with them over our
Ethernet wires.
Sometimes, when things were slow, we even
agreed to snap open the cables and inhale some
of that ether. It was kind of like cutting out of
social studies to smoke pot at the creek, except
both the bonding and the high were quicker
That's the beauty ot computers.
Every day, 1 would avoid looking people in the
eye at the cafeteria —trying to suppress that same
leeling of dread 1 used to get right before I head
ed out to The Edge to meet one of my new party
line friends

But as you could guess, e-mail turned sour
long before 1 ever was able to find a wife. On my
way to where the air is sweet, 1 stumbled upon e
mail fraud — a clever way to make computer
messages look as if they were really coming from
someone else — say, the editor in charge of the

7 ' w.
internship program.
One of my esteemed intern colleagues had
just been moved from the letters department
to the entertainment section, thus earning
him a computer and his own e-mail account.
So, with time to kill before my big after
noon assignment of rating the Barbie and
Cindy Crawford workout videos, I sent him
a phony little message from our boss. It
seemed clever at the time, making references
to his laziness and his personal calls and his
bad haircut. 1 never thought he'd take it seri
ously. Or run into the boss' office and beg
for his job back.
Seconds later, 1 received a call from my

boss.
"Joel, come on down here."
So I did.
"Close my door."
This is where 1 made my mistake. My
inexperience in the working world

caused psychological damage on
par with tbe nights my some-

what-sadistic baby-sitter
would let me stay up to

watch Fantasy Island.
When your boss says,
"close my door," it only
means one thing: What 1
am about to do to you is
so awful that it would be
better for you to leave
the building and never
return than for your fel
low workers to see the
humiliation I am about

to pour upon you.
1 closed the door,
remembered to wipe
the silly smirk off my
face and was about to

start telling him how it
was impossible to reach my
parents this week because
they were visiting a dead rcla
/—l

tive in Ghana. . . .
"If next week weren't your
last week, I'd fire your ass right
now."

What was going on here? From
whence the hostility? 1 was as per
plexed as those people at the Acme
company must be every time they get

another order from Wile E. Coyote
And my cm, no less. Not even Mr Spacely

went around firing asses. It seemed like you hac
to really mess up to get your ass fired
Then 1 realized what was going on 1 hat
invaded the solemn world of work time But, liki
that baby who discerned the key signs of lacta
tion. I auicklv learned mv lesson

Luckily, I had already learned office lesson
number two — feign earnest obsequiousness —
and both me and my ass got out of there in one,
big happy, if slightly furry, piece. But not without
learning a few things about what that crazy life
after Stanford has in store for you.

So when you consider whether
it's better to leave this place

3r to convince your par

ents that one more

in mind: Better

campus than lost
