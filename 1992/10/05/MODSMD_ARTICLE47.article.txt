A pamphlet published by Nelson Personnel Services in Menlo
Park offers suggestions on answering the question that's sure to
make all job-seekers squirm: "What kind of salary are you look
ing for?"
An applicant should not commit to a specific figure, but instead
ask for the salary range for the position. Otherwise, write, "I'm
looking for a fair and equitable salary in line with what is compa-

Before answering the personal character questions, such as
"Why do you want to join our company?" and "What are your
strengths and weaknesses?" the pamphlet recommends that job
seekers do a little homework.

Soft for software
Some skills that may at first seem peripheral often
take center stage in the hiring process.
For instance, computer expertise is a big boon for
job-hunters, according to David Hamilton of Man
power Temporary Services, who said employers often
want to know which computer software an applicant
knows how tn use

He said Manpower offers training in various types of software,
but that "the more versed in different software an applicant is, the
better."
Hamilton recommends undergraduates "dabble in as many dif
ferent kinds of software as possible [and] be fluent in all sorts of
weird stuff — keep abreast of new software."
Right now, the most popular kinds of software used by
employers arc Microsoft Word and Excel for the Macintosh and
WordPerfect, Lotus and Windows for the IBM, according to
Hamilton.

kind of salary are you looking for?
I'm looking for a fair and equitable salary in line
with what is comparable with other positions in
the area," the pamphlet advises.

How do you feel today? 1
Amid the more technical questions, Hamilton said he has always
found one of his company's standard questions unusual and some
what amusing.
"We have this mood question that basically asks, 'How do you feel
today?'" he said. "There are choices that the applicant checks off,
ranging from 'very good and professional' to 'lousv, sick and ornery.'"
While most of the information requested by potential employ
ers is fairly straightforward, job-seekers will occasionally
encounter such unexpected questions — ranging from the
obscure to the illegal.

Tina Galvin of Personnel Solutions Palo Alto — a job
placement agency — said character questions tend to
catch recent graduates off-guard because they require
abstract answers and a bit of soul-searching.
"Questions like 'What motivates you as a person?'
can require a little more thought than the tvpical edu
cational background and previous employer ques
tions," Galvin said.
Amy Whitcomb, a recent graduate interested in
working in "grassroots" public service jobs, said one of
the more thought-provoking questions she is often
asked is, "What is your commitment to the communi
ty?"
Watching for what's illegal

Although employers can get very specific in their
questions, some areas are legally off-limits.
For instance, employers cannot ask for information as seeming
ly basic as age and marital status in applications, questionnaires or
interviews, said Steve Burke of Personnel Solutions, adding that
these prohibitions are based on "about half a dozen different anti-

would you plan on getting to work?
An employer cannot ask someone whether or
not they have a car.

discrimination laws."
But neither employers nor applicants tend to be aware of these
nuances in federal and state employment law. Burke said.
The fact that employers can find out much of the illegal infor
mation anyway — through tax forms filled out once someone is
hired — complicates the situation, he added.
Furthermore, employers can phrase questions in different ways
to elicit illegal information from an applicant in a legal manner.
"An employer cannot ask someone whether or not they have a
car, but they can ask, 'How would you plan on getting to work?"'
Burke explained.
