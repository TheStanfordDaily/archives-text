# Mission accomplished: Cardinal upsets Irish, 33-16
## Stanford jumps to No. 11 in poll 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. - With a
second half of near-flawless foot
ball, the Cardinal shook up college
football's power structure by
upsetting Notre Dame in South
Bend for the second time in three
years.
Coach Bill Walsh's renowned
ball-control, short-passing game
offense finally clicked on all cylin
ders Saturday as Steve Stenstrom,
Glyn Milburn and an overbearing
offensive line picked apart and ran
around a befuddled Notre Dame
defense.
The Cardinal forced four second
half turnovers, and outscored the
Irish 27-0 in the final two quarters
to prevail, 33-16.
This Cardinal victory follows a
stunning upset of Notre Dame in
1990, when Stanford emerged from
obscurity to knock off the then-No.
1 Fighting Irish, 36-31. That win

was entirely unexpected, and not a
few post-game reports substituted
the word "fluke" for "upset." It
was a game that could have gone
either way, as Irish tight end Derek
Brown dropped a sure touchdown
pass on the game's final play.
Saturday, on the other hand,
was an exercise in Cardinal domi
nation.
After spotting Notre Dame 16
points, Stanford shut down the
nation's top scoring offense and
consistently put together long
drives on the way to a 17-point vic
tory. Despite the efforts of the
Fighting Irish cheerleaders mas
querading as NBC announcers,
Stanford convinced a national
"Notre Dame Saturday" audience
that a place among college foot
ball's powerhouses was rightfully
theirs.
An elated, almost giddy Walsh
made sure that "fluke-speak"

graced no one's lips. "This was just a monumental
win for Stanford University. We are so proud of our
selves. ... I hope this one isn't explained away as a
dropped pass or something. Stanford beat Notre
Dame, pure and simple."
In doing so, Stanford vaulted itself into the
nation's No. 11 ranking. And with a three-point
August loss to No. 5 Texas A&M as the only blemish
on its 4-1 record, the Cardinal has established a solid
candidacy for a New Year's Day bowl appearance.
For the first twenty minutes of Saturday's con
test, however, No. 11 rankings were the last thing on
anyone's mind. Notre Dame's Ail-American lineback
er Demetrius Dußose sacked Stenstrom on the first
play from scrimmage, causing a fumble that resulted
in an Irish safety. The Irish drove for a quick touch
down off the ensuing free kick, and the score was 9-0
before you could say "Touchdown Jesus."
Following a J.J. Lasley fumble deep in Notre
Dame territory, the Irish scored again on an 84-yard
drive to make the score 16-0 with just under 11 min
utes to play in the half. But even at that point confi
dence on the Cardinal sideline hardly waned.
"Even when it looked like they were setting us up
for a real whooping, we still believed we were going
to win," said outside linebacker Ron George.
"Coach talked all week about staying with our
game if we got down early," Stenstrom added.
Interestingly, Walsh spoke often this week about
Tennessee's 1991 come-from-behind victory in
South Bend. The Volunteers trailed 31-7 before
coming from behind to beat the Irish in a game
Walsh broadcast. He showed clips of that game to
the Cardinal as part of their preparation, and the
film sessions apparently paid dividends.
"We talked at length about being down in a hos
tile stadium, and how you play in that situation. I
think we're conditioned to keep our heads up even if
we're down 31-7," Walsh said.
"Guys that made mistakes that could be absolute
ly disastrous came back and played beautifully fol
lowing those mistakes. That shows a lot about the
character of our club."
Lasley, who had a costly fumble and two dropped
passes, was the most obvious object of Walsh's praise.
He scored the touchdown that put Stanford ahead to
stay on a 20-yard pass from Stenstrom in the third
quarter.
Stenstrom himself completely outshined heralded

Irish quarterback Rick Mirer on Mirer's home field.
If Mirer's Heisman candidacy doesn't end with his
miserable 13-for-38 performance, the gentlemen who
head Notre Dame's sports information department
should take over the Perot campaign. Mirer couldn't
have hit water if he was falling out of a boat. George
and fellow OLB Dave Garnett kept Mirer under pres
sure, and the Cardinal secondary sparkled once
again. But clearly, the Golden Boy had a bad day.

This was a monumental win for
Stanford University.... I hope
this one isn't explained away as a
dropped pass or something. Stan
ford beat Notre Dame, pure and
simple.'
- Bill Walsh

Stenstrom, by contrast, shook off massive hit
after massive hit to complete 21 of 33 passes for 215
yards and two touchdowns. He worked the short
passing game to perfection, spreading the ball to his
wide outs, backs and tight end. No one could fail to
be impressed with Stenstrom's poise in the face of a
ferocious Notre Dame pass rush. The Cardinal quar
terback stays in the pocket as long as anyone in col
lege football, and the Irish DBs were often unable to
maintain coverage for those precious extra seconds.
Complimenting Stenstrom's air attack was an
effective running game that allowed Walsh's play
calling to keep the Irish off balance. Milburn had a
tremendous second half on the ground, and finished
with 119 yards on just 20 carries. Milburn burned
the Irish for a touchdown and two crucial third down
conversions on a sweep play — the "Bob" sweep —
that was never stopped.
Backup tailback Ellery Roberts turned in one of
the biggest offensive plays of the game when, on
fourth-and-inches, he rushed for 21 yards to the
Notre Dame 20 to set up Lasley's touchdown.
Roberts added 48 yards on 10 carries.
"The Bob sweep was a big part of our offense at
San Francisco. Milburn is ideal for that play and I
don't think Notre Dame has seen it before. Things

were working. We were trying to pick up two yards
and we were getting ten," Walsh said.
On the defensive side of the ball, free safety John
Lynch — who has already been drafted as a pitcher
by baseball's Florida Marlins — may have played his
way into the NFL draft. Lynch made the two biggest
defensive plays of the game. On the opening play of
the second half he hit bruising Irish fullback Jerome

Bettis like he has never been hit before. The ball was
jarred loose and Garnett recovered at the Notre
Dame 22. Three plays later, Stenstrom hit wide out
Justin Armour to pull the Cardinal within 16-13.
Then in the fourth quarter, with Stanford leading
23-16, Lynch shut off Notre Dame's drive and virtu
ally sealed the win by picking off an errant Mirer
pass in the end zone.

In doing so, Stanford vaulted itself into the
nation's No. 11 ranking. And with a three-point
August loss to No. 5 Texas A&M as the only blemish
on its 4-1 record, the Cardinal has established a solid
candidacy for a New Year's Day bowl appearance.
For the first twenty minutes of Saturday's con
test, however, No. 11 rankings were the last thing on
anyone's mind. Notre Dame's Ail-American lineback
er Demetrius Dußose sacked Stenstrom on the first
play from scrimmage, causing a fumble that resulted
in an Irish safety. The Irish drove for a quick touch
down off the ensuing free kick, and the score was 9-0
before you could say "Touchdown Jesus."
Following a J.J. Lasley fumble deep in Notre
Dame territory, the Irish scored again on an 84-yard
drive to make the score 16-0 with just under 11 min
utes to play in the half. But even at that point confi
dence on the Cardinal sideline hardly waned.
"Even when it looked like they were setting us up
for a real whooping, we still believed we were going
to win," said outside linebacker Ron George.
"Coach talked all week about staying with our
game if we got down early," Stenstrom added.
Interestingly, Walsh spoke often this week about
Tennessee's 1991 come-from-behind victory in
South Bend. The Volunteers trailed 31-7 before
coming from behind to beat the Irish in a game
Walsh broadcast. He showed clips of that game to
the Cardinal as part of their preparation, and the
film sessions apparently paid dividends.
"We talked at length about being down in a hos
tile stadium, and how you play in that situation. I
think we're conditioned to keep our heads up even if
we're down 31-7," Walsh said.
"Guys that made mistakes that could be absolute
ly disastrous came back and played beautifully fol
lowing those mistakes. That shows a lot about the
character of our club."
Lasley, who had a costly fumble and two dropped
passes, was the most obvious object of Walsh's praise.
He scored the touchdown that put Stanford ahead to
stay on a 20-yard pass from Stenstrom in the third
quarter.
Stenstrom himself completely outshined heralded

Irish quarterback Rick Mirer on Mirer's home field.
If Mirer's Heisman candidacy doesn't end with his
miserable 13-for-38 performance, the gentlemen who
head Notre Dame's sports information department
should take over the Perot campaign. Mirer couldn't
have hit water if he was falling out of a boat. George
and fellow OLB Dave Garnett kept Mirer under pres
sure, and the Cardinal secondary sparkled once
again. But clearly, the Golden Boy had a bad day.

This was a monumental win for
Stanford University.... I hope
this one isn't explained away as a
dropped pass or something. Stan
ford beat Notre Dame, pure and
simple.'
- Bill Walsh

Stenstrom, by contrast, shook off massive hit
after massive hit to complete 21 of 33 passes for 215
yards and two touchdowns. He worked the short
passing game to perfection, spreading the ball to his
wide outs, backs and tight end. No one could fail to
be impressed with Stenstrom's poise in the face of a
ferocious Notre Dame pass rush. The Cardinal quar
terback stays in the pocket as long as anyone in col
lege football, and the Irish DBs were often unable to
maintain coverage for those precious extra seconds.
Complimenting Stenstrom's air attack was an
effective running game that allowed Walsh's play
calling to keep the Irish off balance. Milburn had a
tremendous second half on the ground, and finished
with 119 yards on just 20 carries. Milburn burned
the Irish for a touchdown and two crucial third down
conversions on a sweep play — the "Bob" sweep —
that was never stopped.
Backup tailback Ellery Roberts turned in one of
the biggest offensive plays of the game when, on
fourth-and-inches, he rushed for 21 yards to the
Notre Dame 20 to set up Lasley's touchdown.
Roberts added 48 yards on 10 carries.
"The Bob sweep was a big part of our offense at
San Francisco. Milburn is ideal for that play and I
don't think Notre Dame has seen it before. Things

were working. We were trying to pick up two yards
and we were getting ten," Walsh said.
On the defensive side of the ball, free safety John
Lynch — who has already been drafted as a pitcher
by baseball's Florida Marlins — may have played his
way into the NFL draft. Lynch made the two biggest
defensive plays of the game. On the opening play of
the second half he hit bruising Irish fullback Jerome

Bettis like he has never been hit before. The ball was
jarred loose and Garnett recovered at the Notre
Dame 22. Three plays later, Stenstrom hit wide out
Justin Armour to pull the Cardinal within 16-13.
Then in the fourth quarter, with Stanford leading
23-16, Lynch shut off Notre Dame's drive and virtu
ally sealed the win by picking off an errant Mirer
pass in the end zone.

Glyn Milburn eludes yet another would-be Irish tackier on his way to a 124-yard rushing performance in
Stanford's 33-16 drubbing of Notre Dame.
SOUTH BEND, Ind. - With a
second half of near-flawless foot
ball, the Cardinal shook up college
football's power structure by
upsetting Notre Dame in South

Coach Bill Walsh's renowned
ball-control, short-passing game
offense finally clicked on all cylin

Glyn Milburn and an overbearing

around a befuddled Notre Dame

The Cardinal forced four second
half turnovers, and outscored the
Irish 27-0 in the final two quarters

This Cardinal victory follows a
stunning upset of Notre Dame in
1990, when Stanford emerged from
obscurity to knock off the then-No.
