SOUTH BEND, Ind. - With a
second half of near-flawless foot
ball, the Cardinal shook up college
football's power structure by
upsetting Notre Dame in South
Bend for the second time in three
years.
Coach Bill Walsh's renowned
ball-control, short-passing game
offense finally clicked on all cylin
ders Saturday as Steve Stenstrom,
Glyn Milburn and an overbearing
offensive line picked apart and ran
around a befuddled Notre Dame
defense.
The Cardinal forced four second
half turnovers, and outscored the
Irish 27-0 in the final two quarters
to prevail, 33-16.
This Cardinal victory follows a
stunning upset of Notre Dame in
1990, when Stanford emerged from
obscurity to knock off the then-No.
1 Fighting Irish, 36-31. That win

was entirely unexpected, and not a
few post-game reports substituted
the word "fluke" for "upset." It
was a game that could have gone
either way, as Irish tight end Derek
Brown dropped a sure touchdown
pass on the game's final play.
Saturday, on the other hand,
was an exercise in Cardinal domi
nation.
After spotting Notre Dame 16
points, Stanford shut down the
nation's top scoring offense and
consistently put together long
drives on the way to a 17-point vic
tory. Despite the efforts of the
Fighting Irish cheerleaders mas
querading as NBC announcers,
Stanford convinced a national
"Notre Dame Saturday" audience
that a place among college foot
ball's powerhouses was rightfully
theirs.
An elated, almost giddy Walsh
made sure that "fluke-speak"
