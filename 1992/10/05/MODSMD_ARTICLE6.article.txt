# Voter trust
## Stockdale emphasizes character over policy 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
The personal character of candidates seeking
the White House is more important than their
positions on particular issues, Ross Perot's run
ning mate said Saturday.
In an interview with The Daily, retired Vice
Admiral James Stockdale said his vice-presidential
bid will focus on convincing voters of his trustwor
thiness and ability to overcome adversity rather
than articulating a laundry list of policy positions.
"How else can I justify my candidacy?" said
Stockdale, a senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution. "I can memorize a bunch of issues and
so forth, but that's not what I offer the ticket. I
offer a lifetime of getting out of tough scrapes and
knowing how to pick people I can trust."
His comments stand in stark contrast to those
of Perot himself, who vowed in a news conference
last week not to "spend one minute" answering
questions that are not relevant to the issues con
cerning the public and who has labeled as "gotcha
journalism" reports probing his own character and
personal history.
Stockdale, while appearing skeptical of the
Perot campaign's prospects for victory and some
what uncomfortable with the new role he has been
thrust into, also expressed confidence in Perot's
message and called the Texas billionaire a soft
hearted "pushover" whose true nature has been
distorted in media accounts.
Stockdale also revealed that he has known for
more than two months that he would be the vice
presidential candidate were Perot to re-enter the
race and that he will use colleagues at Hoover to
help him prepare for the televised vice-presidential
debate next week.
But for the most part, the scholar and former
prisoner of war presented himself as a man com
mitted to Perot and his cause but caught up in
something a little more intense and more public
than he would like. He is, admit
tedly, no politician.
I'm stuck with it," Stockdale,
68, said of the political persona he
has had to adopt since he and

Perot re-entered the presidential
race last Thursday. "I've never
been very excited about poli
tics. ... I think I've lived my life
right, served the country in the
best way I could, and this is
another elevated field of that."
Stockdale's candidacy is a
product of his long friendship
with Perot, a friendship forged

after Stockdale's wife persuaded
Perot to help improve conditions
for prisoners of war held in North
Vietnam. Stockdale was the high
est-ranking POW held during the
Vietnam War and spent more
than seven years in captivity after
being shot down during a 1965
bombing mission.
His years as a POW marked
Stockdale permanently.
"It's defined my whole life,"
Stockdale said. "You live alone,
you learn introspection, you learn
to think for yourself, you learn the
power of conviction. This was not
an idle life. I was getting my legs
broken and my back broken, and I
was in leg irons for two years and
blindfolded for a month.
"I ran a whole country of sorts
for seven and a half years behind
bars," he added. "I was the leader
of the Underground. We wrote
our own laws, we wrote our own
constitution, we had our own
methods of doing intricate things.
I was the boss, and I was in charge
of escape attempts. . . . That is
not worthless experience."
It was that experience that
earned Stockdale the Congres
sional Medal of Honor and 26
other combat decorations. It also
earned him wide praise that fol
lowed him as he took on assign
ments as president of the Naval
War College in 1977, president of
The Citadel military college in
1979 and Hoover fellow beginning
in 1981.
Colleagues today call him a
man of integrity, courage and
decency. They are the qualities
Stockdale himself believes are
most important for candidates of
the nation's highest office to pos
sess.
But he admits he is "nervous"
that the public will demand more
— that he will be forced to come
up with the list of policy positions
he sees as secondary to the real
work of governing.
"They have these wedge issues,
where you feel obliged to have a
position on everything," Stock
dale said. "Every darn thing that
comes up, you say, God, I'd better
get myself on one side or another
of that. . . .

"An attractive person, one we
like to follow and feel comfortable
with, is not a person who has a
firm conviction of the right way to
do everything. He's a person with
a philosophy that's identifiable."
Indeed, in Stockdale's view of
things, philosophy counts for
much more than politics. He first
encountered it as a master's stu
dent studying international rela
tions at Stanford in the early
19605. He turned to the Stoic
philosopher Epictetus for solace
during his imprisonment and has
been writing a book on him over
the last two years.
In contrast with Stockdale's
emphasis on the character and
personal background of candi
dates, Perot has criticized the
press for focusing on those things
at the expense of "the issues."
Asked about the discrepancy
between his views and those of
Perot, Stockdale replied, "Well,
that's a private opinion," and
would not elaborate.
When pushed on his political
views, Stockdale calls himself a
"pragmatist." He fell into the
Republican Party when he was
young but says he has felt uncom
fortable conforming to the party
line in recent years. The Perot
candidacy, he says, has been "lib
erating."
"(Perot's) idea of picking out
key industries that deserve to be
earmarked for success and nur
tured on the Japan model, I don't
find any problem with that,"
Stockdale said. "I'm sure free-mar
ket economists in their native state
would rant and rave about that.
"I'm pro-choice. I'm not
opposed to gun control. I'm not an
ideologue and I'm not a dogma
tist. . . . There were times when I
didn't have the courage to do
that."
Stockdale was first pegged for
the No. 2 slot in March, when he
was named an "interim" candi
date to satisfy a requirement in
some states that the vice-presi
dential candidate's name be
included on petitions to get Perot
on the ballot.
Stockdale says he never heard
any talk about who the perma

nent running mate would be. It
was in mid-July — just after
Perot dropped out of the race, in
fact — that Stockdale first
learned that he would be the per
manent choice if Perot jumped
back in.
Now, suddenly, he is faced with
debating vice-presidential oppo
nents A 1 Gore and Dan Quayle in
just over a week. Rather than hit
ting the campaign trail, Stockdale
has actually canceled scheduled
meetings and other appearances
to stay at Stanford and prepare
with his Hoover colleagues for the
debate.
"I've got to closet myself and
get my head screwed on," he said.
"What'll come up next, I don't
know."
In fact, much of the Perot cam
paign's strategy and operation
appears to be unknown to Stock
dale, and of little concern to him.
He said he doesn't know how the
rest of the campaign will be
waged, and much of what he
learns about developments in the
campaign comes from news
reports.
For example, here's Stockdale
talking about Perot's deficit
reduction plan: "John White
(once Perot's top economic advis
er) said in The New York Times
this morning that if our cure
strings out, we lose some kind of
the response of the money mar
kets overseas. I'm going to have to
learn this from one of my
economist friends up there (in
Hoover) what he exactly meant. It
has to do with international
finance in some way I can't
describe."
News reports have also been
his main source of information on
the upcoming debate Oct. 13. He
had not been officially invited as
of Saturday, but expected to par
ticipate nevertheless.
"I'm way outclassed in many
ways on this because those guys
have been going through this for
(months)," Stockdale said. But, as
with everything else about the
campaign, he takes comfort in his
belief that it's not about scoring
political points or winning over a
particular constituency, but

about showing people who he is.
"It's not an economics test, it's
a parade of your total being, your
personality, the way your mind
reacts, your manners," Stockdale
said. "I think that's why we have
debates. If we wanted to pick the
best economist to run the govern
ment, we wouldn't look any far
ther than up here and ask Milton
Friedman, probably."
In addition to his confidence in
his own philosophy, Stockdale
places a great deal of confidence in
his old friend, Ross. The critical
media reports portraying Perot as
an ego-driven tyrant have gotten
Perot all wrong, he said.
"He is soft-hearted," Stockdale
said. "That's not the caricature
you have, but with friends and
family, he's a pushover."
Perot's decision to pull out of
the race in July was largely a result
of his desire to protect his family,
in addition to his disagreements
with the political professionals he
had hired, Stockdale said.
And while Stockdale later
urged Perot to re-enter the race
— "We've already paid for our
seats; we might as well sit down
and enjoy the show," he told him
— he didn't learn of Perot's deci
sion until the day before his for
mal announcement last week.
"It's a long shot, let's face it,
and I'm not going to be broken
hearted if it doesn't come out that
way," Stockdale said. But, he
added, "we're running to win."
And as he dives into a world
not his own with little idea of
what lies ahead, he turns again to
the words that sustained him in
his years as a prisoner of war —
words that show his character to
be something other than what
Americans have come to expect in
their politicians.
"Epictetus said a life which is
not tested is not worth living,"
Stockdale said. "I can read Sto
icism and understand it when
they say, don't worry about
things over which you have no
control. Your only concern is your
moral purpose."

and I'm not going to be broken
hearted if it doesn't come out that
way," Stockdale said. But, he
added, "we're running to win."
And as he dives into a world
not his own with little idea of
what lies ahead, he turns again to
the words that sustained him in
his years as a prisoner of war —
words that show his character to
be something other than what
Americans have come to expect in
their politicians.
"Epictetus said a life which is
not tested is not worth living,"
Stockdale said. "I can read Sto
icism and understand it when
they say, don't worry about
things over which you have no
control. Your only concern is your
moral purpose."

Hoover Institution's James Stockdale, Ross Perot's running mate,
seeks to establish his character in the eyes of voters.
The personal character of candidates seeking
the White House is more important than their
positions on particular issues, Ross Perot's run
ning mate said Saturday.
In an interview with The Daily, retired Vice
Admiral James Stockdale said his vice-presidential
bid will focus on convincing voters of his trustwor
thiness and ability to overcome adversity rather
than articulating a laundry list of policy positions.
"How else can I justify my candidacy?" said
Stockdale, a senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution. "I can memorize a bunch of issues and
so forth, but that's not what I offer the ticket. I
offer a lifetime of getting out of tough scrapes and
knowing how to pick people I can trust."
His comments stand in stark contrast to those
of Perot himself, who vowed in a news conference
last week not to "spend one minute" answering
questions that are not relevant to the issues con
cerning the public and who has labeled as "gotcha
journalism" reports probing his own character and
personal history.
Stockdale, while appearing skeptical of the
Perot campaign's prospects for victory and some
what uncomfortable with the new role he has been
thrust into, also expressed confidence in Perot's
message and called the Texas billionaire a soft
hearted "pushover" whose true nature has been
distorted in media accounts.
Stockdale also revealed that he has known for
more than two months that he would be the vice
presidential candidate were Perot to re-enter the
race and that he will use colleagues at Hoover to
help him prepare for the televised vice-presidential
debate next week.
But for the most part, the scholar and former
prisoner of war presented himself as a man com
mitted to Perot and his cause but caught up in
something a little more intense and more public
than he would like. He is, admit
tedly, no politician.
I'm stuck with it," Stockdale,
68, said of the political persona he
has had to adopt since he and

Perot re-entered the presidential
race last Thursday. "I've never
been very excited about poli
tics. ... I think I've lived my life
right, served the country in the
best way I could, and this is
another elevated field of that."
Stockdale's candidacy is a
product of his long friendship
with Perot, a friendship forged

after Stockdale's wife persuaded
Perot to help improve conditions
for prisoners of war held in North
Vietnam. Stockdale was the high
est-ranking POW held during the
Vietnam War and spent more
than seven years in captivity after
being shot down during a 1965
bombing mission.
His years as a POW marked
Stockdale permanently.
"It's defined my whole life,"
Stockdale said. "You live alone,
you learn introspection, you learn
to think for yourself, you learn the
power of conviction. This was not
an idle life. I was getting my legs
broken and my back broken, and I
was in leg irons for two years and
blindfolded for a month.
"I ran a whole country of sorts
for seven and a half years behind
bars," he added. "I was the leader
of the Underground. We wrote
our own laws, we wrote our own
constitution, we had our own
methods of doing intricate things.
I was the boss, and I was in charge
of escape attempts. . . . That is
not worthless experience."
It was that experience that
earned Stockdale the Congres
sional Medal of Honor and 26
other combat decorations. It also
earned him wide praise that fol
lowed him as he took on assign
ments as president of the Naval
War College in 1977, president of
The Citadel military college in
1979 and Hoover fellow beginning
in 1981.
Colleagues today call him a
man of integrity, courage and
decency. They are the qualities
Stockdale himself believes are
most important for candidates of
the nation's highest office to pos
sess.
But he admits he is "nervous"
that the public will demand more
— that he will be forced to come
up with the list of policy positions
he sees as secondary to the real
work of governing.
"They have these wedge issues,
where you feel obliged to have a
position on everything," Stock
dale said. "Every darn thing that
comes up, you say, God, I'd better
get myself on one side or another
of that. . . .

"An attractive person, one we
like to follow and feel comfortable
with, is not a person who has a
firm conviction of the right way to
do everything. He's a person with
a philosophy that's identifiable."
Indeed, in Stockdale's view of
things, philosophy counts for
much more than politics. He first
encountered it as a master's stu
dent studying international rela
tions at Stanford in the early
19605. He turned to the Stoic
philosopher Epictetus for solace
during his imprisonment and has
been writing a book on him over
the last two years.
In contrast with Stockdale's
emphasis on the character and
personal background of candi
dates, Perot has criticized the
press for focusing on those things
at the expense of "the issues."
Asked about the discrepancy
between his views and those of
Perot, Stockdale replied, "Well,
that's a private opinion," and
would not elaborate.
When pushed on his political
views, Stockdale calls himself a
"pragmatist." He fell into the
Republican Party when he was
young but says he has felt uncom
fortable conforming to the party
line in recent years. The Perot
candidacy, he says, has been "lib
erating."
"(Perot's) idea of picking out
key industries that deserve to be
earmarked for success and nur
tured on the Japan model, I don't
find any problem with that,"
Stockdale said. "I'm sure free-mar
ket economists in their native state
would rant and rave about that.
"I'm pro-choice. I'm not
opposed to gun control. I'm not an
ideologue and I'm not a dogma
tist. . . . There were times when I
didn't have the courage to do
that."
Stockdale was first pegged for
the No. 2 slot in March, when he
was named an "interim" candi
date to satisfy a requirement in
some states that the vice-presi
dential candidate's name be
included on petitions to get Perot
on the ballot.
Stockdale says he never heard
any talk about who the perma

nent running mate would be. It
was in mid-July — just after
Perot dropped out of the race, in
fact — that Stockdale first
learned that he would be the per
manent choice if Perot jumped
back in.
Now, suddenly, he is faced with
debating vice-presidential oppo
nents A 1 Gore and Dan Quayle in
just over a week. Rather than hit
ting the campaign trail, Stockdale
has actually canceled scheduled
meetings and other appearances
to stay at Stanford and prepare
with his Hoover colleagues for the
debate.
"I've got to closet myself and
get my head screwed on," he said.
"What'll come up next, I don't
know."
In fact, much of the Perot cam
paign's strategy and operation
appears to be unknown to Stock
dale, and of little concern to him.
He said he doesn't know how the
rest of the campaign will be
waged, and much of what he
learns about developments in the
campaign comes from news
reports.
For example, here's Stockdale
talking about Perot's deficit
reduction plan: "John White
(once Perot's top economic advis
er) said in The New York Times
this morning that if our cure
strings out, we lose some kind of
the response of the money mar
kets overseas. I'm going to have to
learn this from one of my
economist friends up there (in
Hoover) what he exactly meant. It
has to do with international
finance in some way I can't
describe."
News reports have also been
his main source of information on
the upcoming debate Oct. 13. He
had not been officially invited as
of Saturday, but expected to par
ticipate nevertheless.
"I'm way outclassed in many
ways on this because those guys
have been going through this for
(months)," Stockdale said. But, as
with everything else about the
campaign, he takes comfort in his
belief that it's not about scoring
political points or winning over a
particular constituency, but

about showing people who he is.
"It's not an economics test, it's
a parade of your total being, your
personality, the way your mind
reacts, your manners," Stockdale
said. "I think that's why we have
debates. If we wanted to pick the
best economist to run the govern
ment, we wouldn't look any far
ther than up here and ask Milton
Friedman, probably."
In addition to his confidence in
his own philosophy, Stockdale
places a great deal of confidence in
his old friend, Ross. The critical
media reports portraying Perot as
an ego-driven tyrant have gotten
Perot all wrong, he said.
"He is soft-hearted," Stockdale
said. "That's not the caricature
you have, but with friends and
family, he's a pushover."
Perot's decision to pull out of
the race in July was largely a result
of his desire to protect his family,
in addition to his disagreements
with the political professionals he
had hired, Stockdale said.
And while Stockdale later
urged Perot to re-enter the race
— "We've already paid for our
seats; we might as well sit down
and enjoy the show," he told him
— he didn't learn of Perot's deci
sion until the day before his for

said. "I think that's why we have
debates. If we wanted to pick the
best economist to run the govern
ment, we wouldn't look any far
ther than up here and ask Milton
Friedman, probably."
In addition to his confidence in
his own philosophy, Stockdale
places a great deal of confidence in
his old friend, Ross. The critical
media reports portraying Perot as
an ego-driven tyrant have gotten
Perot all wrong, he said.
"He is soft-hearted," Stockdale
said. "That's not the caricature
you have, but with friends and
family, he's a pushover."
Perot's decision to pull out of
the race in July was largely a result
of his desire to protect his family,
in addition to his disagreements
with the political professionals he
had hired, Stockdale said.
And while Stockdale later
urged Perot to re-enter the race
— "We've already paid for our
seats; we might as well sit down
and enjoy the show," he told him
— he didn't learn of Perot's deci
sion until the day before his for
mal announcement last week.
"It's a long shot, let's face it,
and I'm not going to be broken
hearted if it doesn't come out that
way," Stockdale said. But, he
added, "we're running to win."
And as he dives into a world
not his own with little idea of
what lies ahead, he turns again to
the words that sustained him in
his years as a prisoner of war —
words that show his character to
be something other than what
Americans have come to expect in
their politicians.
"Epictetus said a life which is
not tested is not worth living,"
Stockdale said. "I can read Sto
icism and understand it when
they say, don't worry about
things over which you have no
control. Your only concern is your
moral purpose."

Hoover Institution's James Stockdale, Ross Perot's running mate,
seeks to establish his character in the eyes of voters.
The personal character of candidates seeking
the White House is more important than their
positions on particular issues, Ross Perot's run
ning mate said Saturday.
In an interview with The Daily, retired Vice
Admiral James Stockdale said his vice-presidential
bid will focus on convincing voters of his trustwor
thiness and ability to overcome adversity rather
than articulating a laundry list of policy positions.
"How else can I justify my candidacy?" said
Stockdale, a senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution. "I can memorize a bunch of issues and
so forth, but that's not what I offer the ticket. I
offer a lifetime of getting out of tough scrapes and
knowing how to pick people I can trust."
His comments stand in stark contrast to those
of Perot himself, who vowed in a news conference
last week not to "spend one minute" answering
questions that are not relevant to the issues con
cerning the public and who has labeled as "gotcha
journalism" reports probing his own character and
personal history.
Stockdale, while appearing skeptical of the
Perot campaign's prospects for victory and some
what uncomfortable with the new role he has been
thrust into, also expressed confidence in Perot's
message and called the Texas billionaire a soft
hearted "pushover" whose true nature has been
distorted in media accounts.
Stockdale also revealed that he has known for
more than two months that he would be the vice
presidential candidate were Perot to re-enter the
race and that he will use colleagues at Hoover to
help him prepare for the televised vice-presidential
debate next week.
But for the most part, the scholar and former
prisoner of war presented himself as a man com
mitted to Perot and his cause but caught up in
something a little more intense and more public
than he would like. He is, admit
tedly, no politician.
I'm stuck with it," Stockdale,
68, said of the political persona he
has had to adopt since he and

Perot re-entered the presidential
race last Thursday. "I've never
been very excited about poli
tics. ... I think I've lived my life
right, served the country in the
best way I could, and this is
another elevated field of that."
Stockdale's candidacy is a
product of his long friendship
with Perot, a friendship forged

after Stockdale's wife persuaded
Perot to help improve conditions
for prisoners of war held in North
Vietnam. Stockdale was the high
est-ranking POW held during the
Vietnam War and spent more
than seven years in captivity after
being shot down during a 1965
bombing mission.
His years as a POW marked
Stockdale permanently.
"It's defined my whole life,"
Stockdale said. "You live alone,
you learn introspection, you learn
to think for yourself, you learn the
power of conviction. This was not
an idle life. I was getting my legs
broken and my back broken, and I
was in leg irons for two years and
blindfolded for a month.
"I ran a whole country of sorts
for seven and a half years behind
bars," he added. "I was the leader
of the Underground. We wrote
our own laws, we wrote our own
constitution, we had our own
methods of doing intricate things.
I was the boss, and I was in charge
of escape attempts. . . . That is
not worthless experience."
It was that experience that
earned Stockdale the Congres
sional Medal of Honor and 26
other combat decorations. It also
earned him wide praise that fol
lowed him as he took on assign
ments as president of the Naval
War College in 1977, president of
The Citadel military college in
1979 and Hoover fellow beginning
in 1981.
Colleagues today call him a
man of integrity, courage and
decency. They are the qualities
Stockdale himself believes are
most important for candidates of
the nation's highest office to pos
sess.
But he admits he is "nervous"
that the public will demand more
— that he will be forced to come
up with the list of policy positions
he sees as secondary to the real
work of governing.
"They have these wedge issues,
where you feel obliged to have a
position on everything," Stock
dale said. "Every darn thing that
comes up, you say, God, I'd better
get myself on one side or another
of that. . . .

"An attractive person, one we
like to follow and feel comfortable
with, is not a person who has a
firm conviction of the right way to
do everything. He's a person with
a philosophy that's identifiable."
Indeed, in Stockdale's view of
things, philosophy counts for
much more than politics. He first
encountered it as a master's stu
dent studying international rela
tions at Stanford in the early
19605. He turned to the Stoic
philosopher Epictetus for solace
during his imprisonment and has
been writing a book on him over
the last two years.
In contrast with Stockdale's
emphasis on the character and
personal background of candi
dates, Perot has criticized the
press for focusing on those things
at the expense of "the issues."
Asked about the discrepancy
between his views and those of
Perot, Stockdale replied, "Well,
that's a private opinion," and
would not elaborate.
When pushed on his political
views, Stockdale calls himself a
"pragmatist." He fell into the
Republican Party when he was
young but says he has felt uncom
fortable conforming to the party
line in recent years. The Perot
candidacy, he says, has been "lib
erating."
"(Perot's) idea of picking out
key industries that deserve to be
earmarked for success and nur
tured on the Japan model, I don't
find any problem with that,"
Stockdale said. "I'm sure free-mar
ket economists in their native state
would rant and rave about that.
"I'm pro-choice. I'm not
opposed to gun control. I'm not an
ideologue and I'm not a dogma
tist. . . . There were times when I
didn't have the courage to do
that."
Stockdale was first pegged for
the No. 2 slot in March, when he
was named an "interim" candi
date to satisfy a requirement in
some states that the vice-presi
dential candidate's name be
included on petitions to get Perot
on the ballot.
Stockdale says he never heard
any talk about who the perma

nent running mate would be. It
was in mid-July — just after
Perot dropped out of the race, in
fact — that Stockdale first
learned that he would be the per
manent choice if Perot jumped
back in.
Now, suddenly, he is faced with
debating vice-presidential oppo
nents A 1 Gore and Dan Quayle in
just over a week. Rather than hit
ting the campaign trail, Stockdale
has actually canceled scheduled
meetings and other appearances
to stay at Stanford and prepare
with his Hoover colleagues for the
debate.
"I've got to closet myself and
get my head screwed on," he said.
"What'll come up next, I don't
know."
In fact, much of the Perot cam
paign's strategy and operation
appears to be unknown to Stock
dale, and of little concern to him.
He said he doesn't know how the
rest of the campaign will be
waged, and much of what he
learns about developments in the
campaign comes from news
reports.
For example, here's Stockdale
talking about Perot's deficit
reduction plan: "John White
(once Perot's top economic advis
er) said in The New York Times
this morning that if our cure
strings out, we lose some kind of
the response of the money mar
kets overseas. I'm going to have to
learn this from one of my
economist friends up there (in
Hoover) what he exactly meant. It
has to do with international
finance in some way I can't
describe."
News reports have also been
his main source of information on
the upcoming debate Oct. 13. He
had not been officially invited as
of Saturday, but expected to par
ticipate nevertheless.
"I'm way outclassed in many
ways on this because those guys
have been going through this for
(months)," Stockdale said. But, as
with everything else about the
campaign, he takes comfort in his
belief that it's not about scoring
political points or winning over a
particular constituency, but

about showing people who he is.
"It's not an economics test, it's
a parade of your total being, your
personality, the way your mind
reacts, your manners," Stockdale
said. "I think that's why we have
debates. If we wanted to pick the
best economist to run the govern
ment, we wouldn't look any far
ther than up here and ask Milton
Friedman, probably."
In addition to his confidence in
his own philosophy, Stockdale
