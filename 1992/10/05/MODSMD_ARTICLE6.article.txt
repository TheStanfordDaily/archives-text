## Stockdale emphasizes character over policy 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
The personal character of candidates seeking
the White House is more important than their
positions on particular issues, Ross Perot's run
ning mate said Saturday.
In an interview with The Daily, retired Vice
Admiral James Stockdale said his vice-presidential
bid will focus on convincing voters of his trustwor
thiness and ability to overcome adversity rather
than articulating a laundry list of policy positions.
"How else can I justify my candidacy?" said
Stockdale, a senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institution. "I can memorize a bunch of issues and
so forth, but that's not what I offer the ticket. I
offer a lifetime of getting out of tough scrapes and
knowing how to pick people I can trust."
His comments stand in stark contrast to those
of Perot himself, who vowed in a news conference
last week not to "spend one minute" answering
questions that are not relevant to the issues con
cerning the public and who has labeled as "gotcha
journalism" reports probing his own character and
personal history.
Stockdale, while appearing skeptical of the
Perot campaign's prospects for victory and some
what uncomfortable with the new role he has been
thrust into, also expressed confidence in Perot's
message and called the Texas billionaire a soft
hearted "pushover" whose true nature has been
distorted in media accounts.
Stockdale also revealed that he has known for
more than two months that he would be the vice
presidential candidate were Perot to re-enter the
race and that he will use colleagues at Hoover to
help him prepare for the televised vice-presidential
debate next week.
But for the most part, the scholar and former
prisoner of war presented himself as a man com
mitted to Perot and his cause but caught up in
something a little more intense and more public
