# 'Run Ross, run' Kemp declares
## 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
A top Bush administration official last week
urged Ross Perot to enter the presidential race,
rptired Vice Admiral James Stockdale revealed
Saturday in an interview with The Daily.
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
Jack Kemp, a member of the Republican delega
tion sent to Dallas last Monday to woo Perot sup
porters, told the Texas billionaire: "Run, Ross,
run," according to Stockdale.
No member of the Republican delegation has pub
licly admitted encouraging Perot to enter the race,
but a top Kemp aide yesterday confirmed that the
Secretary had made the comments at the meeting.
Leaders of both major political parties sent del
egations to Perot's headquarters to court his sup
porters just a few days before Perot announced his
bid for the presidency last week.
"We were being addressed by the Democrats
and the Republicans, and they were individuals.
There wasn't a monolithic opinion put out by
either side," said Stockdale, Perot's running mate
and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution who
attended both meetings.
According to Stockdale, the Republican delegation
was told, "Some people think we ought to discourage
Ross from running What do you say to that?"
Kemp replied: "Run, Ross, run. Let the chips
fall as they may."
"He was quick to grasp the fact that Perot was
going to run,"the aide said. "He knew this in the
first hour (of the meeting) . . . and there was no
doubt in his mind."
Kemp reportedly did not stay for the duration
of the meeting and left before the delegation and
Perot met the press. "He said it and then got the
hell out of there," the aide said.
There were no objections to
Kemp's comment from other
members of the Republican dele
gation, and many of them smiled
at the remark, Stockdale said. No
other members of the delegation
encouraged Perot to run, he
added.
The aide would not say if
Kemp's comments were made at
the behest of the Bush administra
tion, noting only that "Kemp went
as Bush's representative." A
spokesman for the Bush-Quayle
campaign last night refused to con
firm or deny Kemp's comments.
Stockdale's wife, Sybil, who
was also present at the meeting,
said Kemp did not qualify his
remarks as his personal opinion.
"You know they sometimes say,
'This is my personal opinion.'
There was no qualification from
him," she said.
Earlier that day, James Stock
dale said, members of the Demo
cratic delegation told the support
ers that Perot's entry "would be
detrimental."
Many analysts believe Perot's
entry into the race will help Bush's
campaign more than Clinton's. His
entrance adds an element of uncer
tainty into a stagnant campaign,
and he could siphon away some of
the anti-Bush votes on which Clin
ton has been counting.
The meetings between the dele
gations and the Perot coordinators
were closed to the public.
