STUDENT HALF-PRICE TICKET SALE!
Why? Because we like you.

other event on the 1992-93 season, all 35 shows are within walking
distance, right here on campus! And with half-price tickets, a night of
live entertainment costs less than pizza! Who knows, you may have
enough cash left over to bring a date...
