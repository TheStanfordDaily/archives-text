# Last minute registration
## Students make dash to qualify for election 
### Romesh Ratnesar 
Students joined a statewide rush to meet yes
terday's voter registration deadline for the Nov.
3 election, for reasons ranging from new campus
addresses to Ross Perot's re-entry into the race.
Between 4 and 4:30 p.m. alone, at least 15 stu
dents dashed to a registration table set up by De
mocrats in White Plaza. Several others stopped
by to pick up campaign paraphernalia, including
"Republican for Clinton-Gore" bumper stickers
and buttons that depict Arkansas Gov. Bill Clin
ton playing the saxophone under the heading,
"Blow Bill Blow."
Registration yesterday was "busier than ex
pected, but not really frantic," said Clinton-
Gore volunteer Deborah Cipolla.
About 1,000 people have registered at the De
mocratic table in White Plaza this week, said
Dean Little, a Santa Clara County field organiz
er for the Clinton-Gore campaign.
There has been a similar rush throughout
Santa Clara County. Of the nearly 20,000 De
mocrats who have registered in the past six
weeks, about 3,000 have signed up in the last
three days, Little said. He added that overall
new registration was "very much higher" than
in previous elections.
Many of the students at the table yesterday had
recently come to Stanford and had to re-register.
"This seems to be a really important election;
there is no way I'd miss it," said Jason Dicks of
Ohio, a senior, who did not want to go through
the process of filing an absentee ballot.
Other students said they felt that this elec
tion carries larger implications than past ones.
"I heard on the news that it was the last day,"
said Robert Barboza, a first-year graduate stu
dent. "I would have been really pissed off at my
self if I forgot to register."
One student, who declined to be identified,
registered at the Democratic table but said she
would vote for independent candidate Perot.
She said that she is only voting because the
Texas billionaire has rejoined the presidential
race.
