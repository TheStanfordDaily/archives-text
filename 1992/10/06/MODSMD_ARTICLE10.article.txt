# If not Oregon, how 'bout Ireland?

Stanford Band members
may soon be learning "Wearin'
O' the Green" if they accept an
invitation to play in Dublin's
St. Patrick's Day Parade.
"We were invited by the Lord
Mayor of Dublin," said Assistant
Band Manager Jesse Johan
nesen. "Everybody's interested,
of course."
And Band Manager Casey
O'Hara said he would love to go
to Ireland. People hear his
name and say, "Hey, you must
be Irish," he added.
But a trip to the land of
shamrocks and leprechauns
would have its drawbacks.
"It's going to cost a lot of
money," Johannesen said, not
ing that a travel agent estimat
ed the price at $1,400 per per
son. "It would have to come out
of our pockets."
Then there's the timing. "St.
Patrick's Day is right in the mid

dle of our finals week," he said.
Band members will vote
tomorrow on whether to march
in the parade, Johannesen said.
The University of Miami's
band was originally invited,
but Hurricane Andrew "just
destroyed their band shack"
last month, he said. "It left
them in shambles and they had
to scrap the trip."
Band directors at Miami and
Notre Dame — which has been
invited to the 1994 parade —
recommended Stanford, he said.
Band members would leave
on March 10 and return either
March 14 or 18. During the
longer trip, he said, they would
stay in Shannon and play in a
parade in Limerick as well.
But if they take the trip, the
experience won't be limited to
band members. "We're extend
ing invitations to anyone who
wants to go," Johannesen said,
explaining that more people will
bring the price down. "You don't
have to play an instrument."
