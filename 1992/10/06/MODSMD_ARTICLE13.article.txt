Democracy of the elite
KUWAIT (AP) — Kuwait's male elite jammed
polling stations for the country's first elections in
seven years yesterday, many hoping the results
will speed Kuwait's democratic reform and recon
struction in the wake of the Persian Gulf War.
But many women remain frustrated that their
resistance work against the Iraqi occupation did
not earn them the right to vote. About 50 modern
day suffragettes scuffled with police when they
tried to enter polling stations.
The 1991 Gulf War did not change the strict
voting rules in the oil-rich emirate. Only males
over 21 who can trace their ancestry back 72 years
are allowed to vote.
Voters generally said they leaned toward
younger, highly educated candidates who would
reinforce democracy.
The 278 candidates running for 50 seats said most
voters want Kuwait secured from another invasion

and see a strong Parliament as the first step.
There were no immediate projections when voting
ended. Final results are expected by this afternoon.
USAir strike strands passengers
IMPERIAL, Pa. (AP) — Ground crews for
USAir walked off the job yesterday in a dispute
over job security, stranding thousands of people
in airports around the country.
Picket lines sprouted at dawn at many air
ports, including Pittsburgh, where 28 strikers
were arrested.
USAir, the nation's sixth-largest airline, said
three-quarters of its 2,600 daily departures were tak
ing off. But some travelers forced to find other ways
home didn't have much sympathy for the strikers.
After a spring and summer of staggering loss
es, the strike makes it harder for USAir to lure
scarce wintertime passengers who now fear they
could be stranded far from home.
