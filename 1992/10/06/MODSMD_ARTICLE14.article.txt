# Congress overrides Bush veto
## Passes cable regulation, ruins president's perfect record 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Congress overrode President
Bush's veto and enacted legisla
tion yesterday designed to regu
late the cable television industry.
It was the first time the House
and Senate had thwarted Bush's
veto during his presidency.
The House voted 308-114; the
Senate, 74-25. Both were com
fortably over the necessary two
thirds mfyority.
The override came despite an
intensive last-minute lobbying
campaign by the White House
eager to preserve Bush's perfect
record and avoid a highly publi
cized defeat one month before the
election. Bush had successfully
vetoed 35 previous bills.
Clapping, cheers and hand-slap
ping erupted on the Democratic
side of the House floor as the vote
total neared the magic number of
289, assuring the veto would be
overridden. Democrats began
chanting, "Go, go, go," as the vote

total crossed that number.
Opponents of the bill blamed
election-year politics for the over
ride, but proponents said con
sumer anger over soaring rates
led to wide bipartisan support for
the measure in both chambers.
"This is not a partisan piece of
legislation," said Rep. Edward
Markey, D-Mass., co-author of the
bill that reimposes government
regulation on the cable TV indus
try. "It is an issue between the
cable industry and the consumers
of our country."
But earlier in the Senate, Repub
lican leader Robert Dole said, "This
is an attempt to embarrass the
president 30 days before the elec
tion. That's what this is all about."
The bill would require the Fed
eral Communications Commis
sion to set rates for basic cable ser
vice in communities where cable
companies operate as monopolies.
It also is designed to enhance com
petition from other companies

that can provide expanded pro
gramming similar to cable.
"This is a tremendous victory
for consumers," said Gene Kim
melman of the Consumer Federa
tion of America, which supported
the bill. "This shows that the
Congress has rejected election-year
politicking and chosen to stand by
consumers to protect them from
the excesses of cable monopolies."
The cable industry — and Bush
— argued that costs to consumers
could go up because of a provision
of the bill mandating service stan
dards and a requirement that
cable companies negotiate with
broadcasting stations before carry
ing their signals.
They contended cable has grown
into a popular provider of quality
programming that would improve
and expand faster if unregulated.
Sen. A 1 Gore, the Democratic
vice presidential candidate, left a
bus campaign in Florida to fly to
Washington for the vote.
