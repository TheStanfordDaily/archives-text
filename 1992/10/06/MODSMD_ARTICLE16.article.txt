## No COP surrogates 
### 
The ASSU Senate must
allow the student body
to have a COP-free year

Most students at
Stanford couldn't care less
about the ASSU. And they
proved it last spring.
Despite the extremely energetic
campaigning of two well-qualified
slates, and one which was hilari
ously irreverent, voters chose the
protest option — "I Prefer Not To
Have A COP"
The slate seized on students'
image of the Council of Presidents
as a group of over-paid, resume
packing do-nothings and gave
them a perfect option: extermina
tion of the useless body.
The surprisingly enthusiastic
support for "Prefer" gave Ed Mun
and his running mates both the
right and the duty to fulfil their
campaign pledge: to do nothing for
the entire year except give their
salaries back to the students.
With their current invisibility,
the members of "Prefer" are stay
ing true to themselves and the will
of the student body.
The clear desires of the stu
dents are in danger of being
thwarted, though, by the increas
ing stature of the ASSU Senate,
and in particular, the office of sen
ate chair.
The senate has naturally been
forced to assume some of the
COP's former responsibility —
such as oversight of certain busi
ness projects — to avoid a chaotic
situation.
But the senate, and especially
senate chair Ron Brown, should
be very careful not to assume any
more responsibilities than are
absolutely necessary.
On Friday, Brown helped place
a robe around University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper during his
inauguration. This must have
beei\ an honor, indeed, but one
that Brown would have been wise

to graciously decline.
Because his role would clearly
have been filled by a member of a
functioning COP in other, more
normal, years, it should have been
left undone.
As hard as it may be for Brown
to refuse participation in such cer
emonial affairs, it is the right
thing for him to do.
Similarly — and more impor
tantly — neither Brown nor the
senate should seek to replace
"Prefer" at meetings between the
University president and the COP
which were formerly held on a reg
ular basis.
The ASSU should encourage
Casper to search for new and pre
viously untried methods of com
municating with students now
that there is no COP
Such experimentation could
easily lead to effective and satisfy
ing communication.
Perhaps the worst case would
be for student-administration
dialogue to occur primarily
through Brown. Although he
appears to be a capable student
leader, Brown should honor last
spring's request of students: "We
don't need visible student gov
ernment leaders."
Students asked that they not be
represented by a presidential body
for one year, after which they
would have the chance of reinstat
ing — or rejecting forever — the
office of COP through a vote on an
amendment to end the office.
Brown's usurping of too many
COP duties would deny the stu
dents a chance to experience a
truly President-less year, and may
well make them more likely to set
tle for the new format.
Ironically, while the ASSU may
maintain its campus voice with
the advent of a high-profile ASSU
senate chair, students would lose
theirs. In contrast to the directly
elected COF| the senate chair is
chosen exclusively by the senate.
Somehow, though, it seems that
maintaining a voice in the ASSU
isn't a big concern of most stu
dents.
