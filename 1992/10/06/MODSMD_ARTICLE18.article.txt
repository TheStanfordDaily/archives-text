## Discovering one's voice 
### 
I HAVE A FRIEND who has recently
started calling me "contentious." This
makes me proud. Finally! I have
always wanted a Voice.
I have come a long way, readers. I
have been the shy second-grader who
watched the older and meaner girls at
summer camp demolish her lovingly
packed supply of animal crackers and
Band-Aids.
I have been the very small freshman
who could count, on one hand, the num
ber of times she opened her polite mouth
in Great Works section.
But only a few people know that I am
not really the good child that everyone
believes me to be. My irritability has
always been a standard topic of conversa
tion during car rides with my mother —
the car is the customary location of
choice for "difficult subjects."
"Now I want you to tell me why you
are so angry. . . . You have always been
such an angry child."
I have always taken a secret satisfac
tion in these words, in being an "angry
child." I also take great satisfaction in
being an Angry Young Woman.
Now I know why — because there in
the moments when I wanted to kick the
guy in the face who told me that making
me happy wasn't a priority in his life,
when I wanted to strangle the teacher
who thought I belonged in art class
instead of AP Physics, there I felt

strong. There, through the veneer of
the nice and wonderful child, I found a
Self.
Now the journey from a recognition of
a Self to a raising of a Voice is huge and
difficult and intimidating. I am constant
ly stumbling. . . .Why didn't I tell those
guys in the Bookstore the other day to
unglue their eyes from the butt of a
woman whom they apparently found
attractive?
"Those shorts are a crime!"
"No way, they're a blessing!"
Why can't I say no to friends who want
rides to the airport when I am drowning
in my own swamp of work? Why can't I
resist loaning a car, a typewriter, or a
sympathetic ear?
Where does courage come from? I
don't know, but I've found a useful sub
stitute. It may even be the real thing. All
I know is that it's a wonder-word called
assertiveness.
One whiff of assertiveness builds
the bridge from anger to argument.
And to argue is to dare the world to
change. To raise a voice is to elbow
your self a place where you are not sur
viving but living.
As a fledgling contentious-person, I
realize I have a lot of arguments to lose.
I am not articulate. I don't have a defi
nition of "right" and "true" and
"important." I have no delusions that
I'll even be immediately and consistently

coherent.
But where should I go once my argu
ment does actually convince you? It's one
thing to challenge the sturdiness of a
frame of mind, and entirely another to be
responsible for constructing a blueprint
for change, for reweaving the fabric of
society.
I know that bearing my soul to a piece
of paper will insure that my precious and
fragile ideas will be captured and crum
pled and labeled as oddities, to be gawked
at like the shrunken heads and reptiles
in-jars from dusty anthropological muse
ums.
But maybe someone will pick up one of
these mangled morsels of soul and
admire its unusual shape or its robust
coloring. Maybe she will put it in a little
mind's-drawer marked Inspiration. And
I will have passed on the power to
Change.
Whims aside, it is enough (for me) for
now to be heard. Enough? Exhilarating!
Being contentious is contagious. And
raising a voice feels like freedom.
