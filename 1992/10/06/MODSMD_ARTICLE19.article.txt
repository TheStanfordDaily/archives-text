Christianity fine for Memorial Church all-faith image

I READ WITH SOME interest your
headline "Myriad of Christian icons
hinders multi-faith image" and The
Daily's article lamenting the artwork of
Memorial Church, "which includes
mosaics of the Last Supper of Jesus
Christ," which your reporter asserts
"has always been at odds with the 'non
denominational' status of the church."
Given the painstaking labor of love
that went into restoring this historical
landmark I found the whole article a bit
petulant and specious.
The Daily is apparently unaware of
what 'nondenominational' means in the
context of the Christian Church. There
are many recognized "denominations,"
such as Roman Catholic, Episcopal,
Lutheran, Baptist, Greek Orthodox,
Church of Christ, etc. — all of whom
profess that Jesus is the Son of God.
Because their doctrines and practices
vary considerably, and are sometimes
sharply at odds with each other, they do
not usually share the same building.
Therefore, it was very forward-look

ing of the Stanfords to open their
church to any worship service of denom
ination.
Stanford, continuing to follow the
spirit of this philosophy, now makes the
building available to all comers of all
faiths. But Memorial Church was specif
ically designed as a celebration of the
Christian faith.
What could be more appropriate than
for an architect to glorify the image of
Christ in what was designed to be a
Christian structure? Just as the non
representational art of a Jewish syna
gogue reflects teachings of the Jewish
faith, and the images of Buddha in Bud
dhist temples reflect the Buddhist faith,
Memorial Church reflects faith in Jesus
by those who paid to build it.
I support the idea of a multi-faith
center where many groups could meet
and feel comfortable. It is important
that members of the Stanford communi
ty feel welcome and represented in their
personal search for God. But the fact
that all structures are not suitable for

all purposes should not be used as a
premise for demeaning the grandeur of
Memorial Church or the faith it happens
to represent.
Were The Daily to look more deeply,
it might be found that a cornerstone of
this University (need-blind admissions)
can be traced farther back than the
Stanfords — to the Gospel of Christ —
which taught love for all people, and sac
rifice by the rich to provide for the less
fortunate.
The generosity of this University is a
reflection of the Stanfords active Chris
tian faith.
Traditionally, religious groups have
always provided the funding for their
own meeting places. This University's
main charter is education. Stanford is
not obligated to provide for every reli
gious variation within its community
any more than the U.S. government is
required to do so.
Several years ago, in a fairly extensive
informal poll on campus, 70 percent of
the Stanford community professed

agnosticism or atheism. Memorial
Church does not represent the majority
view of God on campus, but I don't hear
anyone suggesting that we raze it for
that reason.
The numerous tables and booths in
White Plaza testify to a lively interest in
maintaining a flourishing religious cul
ture here and support and tolerance for
many diverse views.
If Christianity at times seems to be
"in your face" on this campus, perhaps
that is because it contains truth and
sound, practical teachings.
True spirituality is reflected in the
heart and in the character of individu
als, not on the side of any building. Let
us be grateful for what we have already
been blessed with, seek a practical solu
tion for those who feel their spiritual
needs are not being addressed, and quit
bickering about what will always be a
matter of personal (and, at Stanford,
protected) convictions.
