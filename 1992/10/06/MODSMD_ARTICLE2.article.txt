# 'Momma Bear' nurtures community
## Acting director lends stability to Black House during transition 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Although she was only dubbed
"Momma Bear" as recently as last Octo
ber, Acting Director of the Black Com
munity Services Center Barbara Smith
has been mothering Stanford's African-
American community for several years.
"Sometimes I do feel like I'm raising
other people's kids, and sometimes I feel
like they're my own," Smith said. "I give
advice. I sit and talk to the students. I
even yell at them.
"You just want to love them and hug
them and sometimes even scold them.
Sometimes, you can even walk by outside
and hear my mouth," she added.
Smith took over as acting director of

the Black Community Services Center
after the resignation of Keith Archuleta in
May, but she said she looks forward to the
appointment of a new director and her re
turn to the position of assistant director.
She said she did not apply for the posi
tion of director because she likes running
the center and being more involved in the
programs. She added that she feels she
"can still make significant contributions,
not just to the center but to the Stanford
community at large" from the position of
assistant director.
In addition, Smith said, "I feel that it is
really important to have someone in place
(as director) who has a more varied back
ground, different perspective and new
ideas on student life. That is vital to making
sure the community is moving forward."

Smith isn't a newcom
er to Stanford or to the
center, even though she
just became assistant di
rector of the center in
September 1991. She
began her work on cam
pus in the offices of the
ASSU as an accounting
assistant 12 years ago.
While applying for

that job, Smith said, "the student finan
cial manager asked if I had any questions
or anything to add, and I said, 'yes, I want
the job,' and I got the job."
She spent the next eight years at the
ASSU, putting her accounting skills to
