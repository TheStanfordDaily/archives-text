# 'Momma Bear' nurtures community
## Acting director lends stability to Black House during transition 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Although she was only dubbed
"Momma Bear" as recently as last Octo
ber, Acting Director of the Black Com
munity Services Center Barbara Smith
has been mothering Stanford's African-
American community for several years.
"Sometimes I do feel like I'm raising
other people's kids, and sometimes I feel
like they're my own," Smith said. "I give
advice. I sit and talk to the students. I
even yell at them.
"You just want to love them and hug
them and sometimes even scold them.
Sometimes, you can even walk by outside
and hear my mouth," she added.
Smith took over as acting director of

the Black Community Services Center
after the resignation of Keith Archuleta in
May, but she said she looks forward to the
appointment of a new director and her re
turn to the position of assistant director.
She said she did not apply for the posi
tion of director because she likes running
the center and being more involved in the
programs. She added that she feels she
"can still make significant contributions,
not just to the center but to the Stanford
community at large" from the position of
assistant director.
In addition, Smith said, "I feel that it is
really important to have someone in place
(as director) who has a more varied back
ground, different perspective and new
ideas on student life. That is vital to making
sure the community is moving forward."

Smith isn't a newcom
er to Stanford or to the
center, even though she
just became assistant di
rector of the center in
September 1991. She
began her work on cam
pus in the offices of the
ASSU as an accounting
assistant 12 years ago.
While applying for

that job, Smith said, "the student finan
cial manager asked if I had any questions
or anything to add, and I said, 'yes, I want
the job,' and I got the job."
She spent the next eight years at the
ASSU, putting her accounting skills to


Smith
use by bookkeeping for student
organizations, fee assessments
and refunds.
It was while she labored at the
ASSU that Smith first became
involved with the center as a
member of the Black House's pol
icy board — a nine-member group
that serves as the center's general
governing body.
Serving on the policy board
"gave me more depth and insight
into the inner workings of how
the Black House was governed,"
Smith said.
It was at the suggestion of sev
eral students that she became
more involved in the day-to-day
affairs of the center, and in
December 1988 she applied to be
the group's office manager.
"It was an opportunity for me
to utilize my talents and my skills
in a much more diverse way," said
Smith, adding that the job still
exercised her accounting and bud
get skills while allowing her to
work more with people.
Smith said she looked at the
change in jobs as an "opportunity
to build relationships with stu
dents as well as expand upon rela
tionships with colleagues in dif
ferent departments."
People skills are most impor
tant when working at the center,

she said, adding that "it's nice to
be able to add a personal touch. I
think it really makes a difference.
"One of the things I like best is
working with students. I work
more closely with the students at
the Black House," she said. "I find
the responsibility I have here a lot
more diverse, more challenging
and more fun. Planning programs
and working with students is fun."
Smith said the highlight of
working at the center is that she
feels like it is not just a job.
Instead, "it's family."
Even though Smith feels like
her family is at Stanford, in reali
ty she is only moved to northern
California 14 years ago. "My
mother tried to get me back
home, but I said no. I like the Bay
Area; it's my new home."
She is raising her own "bear
cub" here — 16-year-old J.R. —
and she said her work at Stanford
has helped her teach him the
importance of schooling.
"By being in higher education,
it has really motivated me to work
with him to settle down in school
and focus in on education," she
said.
But education isn't her only
interest. Smith said she enjoys
cooking, dancing and tennis, but
that her real passion is the
National Football League. "I
don't care what game it is, I have
to watch it. I try not to schedule
anything for Sundays or Monday
nights," she said.

importance of schooling.
"By being in higher education,
it has really motivated me to work
with him to settle down in school
and focus in on education," she
said.
But education isn't her only
interest. Smith said she enjoys
cooking, dancing and tennis, but
that her real passion is the
National Football League. "I
don't care what game it is, I have
to watch it. I try not to schedule
anything for Sundays or Monday
nights," she said.
Although she was only dubbed
"Momma Bear" as recently as last Octo
ber, Acting Director of the Black Com
munity Services Center Barbara Smith
has been mothering Stanford's African-
American community for several years.
"Sometimes I do feel like I'm raising
other people's kids, and sometimes I feel
like they're my own," Smith said. "I give
advice. I sit and talk to the students. I
even yell at them.
"You just want to love them and hug
them and sometimes even scold them.
Sometimes, you can even walk by outside
and hear my mouth," she added.
Smith took over as acting director of

the Black Community Services Center
after the resignation of Keith Archuleta in
May, but she said she looks forward to the
appointment of a new director and her re
turn to the position of assistant director.
She said she did not apply for the posi
tion of director because she likes running
the center and being more involved in the
programs. She added that she feels she
"can still make significant contributions,
not just to the center but to the Stanford
community at large" from the position of
assistant director.
In addition, Smith said, "I feel that it is
really important to have someone in place
(as director) who has a more varied back
ground, different perspective and new
ideas on student life. That is vital to making
sure the community is moving forward."

Smith isn't a newcom
er to Stanford or to the
center, even though she
just became assistant di
rector of the center in
September 1991. She
began her work on cam
pus in the offices of the
ASSU as an accounting
assistant 12 years ago.
While applying for

that job, Smith said, "the student finan
cial manager asked if I had any questions
or anything to add, and I said, 'yes, I want
the job,' and I got the job."
She spent the next eight years at the
ASSU, putting her accounting skills to


Smith
use by bookkeeping for student
organizations, fee assessments
and refunds.
It was while she labored at the
ASSU that Smith first became
involved with the center as a
member of the Black House's pol
icy board — a nine-member group
that serves as the center's general
governing body.
Serving on the policy board
"gave me more depth and insight
into the inner workings of how
the Black House was governed,"
Smith said.
It was at the suggestion of sev
eral students that she became
more involved in the day-to-day
affairs of the center, and in
December 1988 she applied to be
the group's office manager.
"It was an opportunity for me
to utilize my talents and my skills
in a much more diverse way," said
Smith, adding that the job still
exercised her accounting and bud
get skills while allowing her to
work more with people.
Smith said she looked at the
change in jobs as an "opportunity
to build relationships with stu
dents as well as expand upon rela
tionships with colleagues in dif
ferent departments."
People skills are most impor
tant when working at the center,

she said, adding that "it's nice to
be able to add a personal touch. I
think it really makes a difference.
"One of the things I like best is
working with students. I work
more closely with the students at
the Black House," she said. "I find
the responsibility I have here a lot
more diverse, more challenging
and more fun. Planning programs
and working with students is fun."
Smith said the highlight of
working at the center is that she
feels like it is not just a job.
Instead, "it's family."
Even though Smith feels like
her family is at Stanford, in reali
ty she is only moved to northern
California 14 years ago. "My
mother tried to get me back
home, but I said no. I like the Bay
Area; it's my new home."
She is raising her own "bear
cub" here — 16-year-old J.R. —
and she said her work at Stanford
has helped her teach him the
importance of schooling.
"By being in higher education,
it has really motivated me to work
with him to settle down in school
and focus in on education," she
said.
But education isn't her only
interest. Smith said she enjoys
cooking, dancing and tennis, but
that her real passion is the
National Football League. "I
don't care what game it is, I have
to watch it. I try not to schedule
anything for Sundays or Monday
nights," she said.
