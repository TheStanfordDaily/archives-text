# The
						'Stanford Indians,' a different sort of tribe
## 
### 
I am writing in response to Elaine Elliot
Brown's letter on September 28 concern
ing Stanford's mascot and nickname.
Admittedly, I was never enthusiastic
(ambivalent would be more like it) about
the way Native Americans were portrayed
by Stanford boosters in the past.
I will now try to explain my position
in favor of the "Indians" nickname as
clearly as possible.
I am not convinced that simply
changing the nickname of the mascot
from Indians to Cardinal has done any
thing — symbolically or substantively —
to actually improve conditions for the

Native American community.
On the negative side, it has probably
led to ill-feelings on the part of many by
politicizing Stanford athletics. Native
American activists should carefully con
sider whether eliminating the word
"Indian" from every vocabulary and
piece of literature on the face of the
earth would really do anything to help
their peoples.
If such a policy were able to be imple
mented and actually occurred, my opin
ion is that society would tend to stop
talking about indigenous races and even
tually stop thinking about them com
pletely.
Is this what the Native American
community wants?
Secondly, when students first arrive
at Stanford, they are presented with a

myriad of colors, pictures and ideas that
reflect the community's diversity. From
an educational standpoint, this is proba
bly a good thing because it acknowl
edges, without necessarily judging, an
individual's place in society.
However, individuals must also
understand that, as Stanford students,
they are members of a larger group — a
bloodline, a "tribe." The only color they
should be concerned about when dealing
with this context is cardinal.
In order to facilitate discussions on
the nickname issue, it may be useful for
members of the community to go back
ward in Stanford history and look at
the unique relationship between two
special people — Jim Thorpe and "Pop"
Warner. Perhaps this examination will
lead to a new and renewed respect for

the tribe, the Stanford Indians
