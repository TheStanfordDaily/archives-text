## So close yet so far away: Spikers down USC, lose UCLA squeaker No.2 volleyball beats No.6 in four, falls to No.1 in five 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
For most Stanford women's volley
ball fans, it might be a case of good
news and bad news, but for Stanford
head coach Don Shaw and his Cardinal
squad, it was a valuable learning expe
rience.
The second-ranked Cardinal split a
two-game series last weekend against
USC and UCLA, prevailing over the
No. 6 Trojans 15-8, 15-3, 9-15, 15-1,
but falling to the top-ranked Bruins
12-15,6-15,15-2, 15-6, 16-14. Stanford
dropped to 9-1 (3-1 in Pacific 10 con
ference play), while USC went to 10-2
(5-1 in the Pac-10) and UCLA
improved to 11-0 (6-0).
On Friday, Stanford began what
Shaw called "the toughest weekend of
volleyball this year" when it faced
USC before 1,789 fans at Maples
Pavilion. The Cardinal took control of
the match early on by taking the first
two games from the Trojans, then
slipped in the third as USC prevailed
15-9.
The Cardinal thundered back
behind the play of Kristi Paaso, Jen
nifer Jackson and tri-captain Bev
Oden, holding USC to a single point in
the fourth game as Stanford cruised to
a 15-1 win to wrap up the match.
Oden led the way for the Cardinal,
posting 16 kills and five blocks, while
Paaso added 14 kills and 11 digs. Jack
son also added 10 kills and 11 digs for
Stanford. For USC, Cica Baccelli was
the only USC player to register double
figures in kills, with 11 for the match.
At Saturday's match, 5,602 specta
tors — the second largest crowd ever
for a Stanford volleyball match —
jammed Maples Pavilion to witness the
Cardinal take on the defending nation
al champion Bruins. Stanford got the
crowd excited early by jumping out to

an early 2-0 lead over UCLA, but the
Bruins stormed back to take the third
and fourth games, allowing only eight
Stanford points along the way.
The Bruins were down 10-6 late in
the fifth game before going on a 5-1
run to tie the match. The two teams
were virtually neck and neck until Bru
ins middle blocker Lisa Hudak's block
gave the Bruins a 15-14 lead. On the
next point, Stanford was called for a
lift, and UCLA took the game and
match from the Cardinal.
Shaw was quick to give the Bruins
credit. "UCLA is a great team," he said
after the game. "They're very confi
dent. Down two games to none, they're
not going to just roll over and die."
Oden noted that while the Cardinal
may have lost the match, they were
anything but intimidated by the
nation's top-ranked squad. "They're
not as unbeatable as we thought. Next
time we see them, it will be a lot differ
ent."
Shaw agreed that the match was a
valuable learning experience for the
Cardinal. "We came in to the match
wanting to know where we stood with
these guys; we're in pretty good stand
ing. We learned a lot tonight, and we
will do a better job in the future
because of it."
The Bruins snapped Stanford's 28-
match Pac-10 winning streak with the
win, a string dating back to October
1990.

'We came in to the match wanting to know where we
stood with these guys; we're in pretty good standing.

Oden also led the Cardinal against
UCLA, hitting .355 for the match and
registering 16 kills, five blocks and
four aces. Kristi Paaso contributed 11
kills, 12 digs and four blocks for Stan
ford, while freshman Cary Wendell tal
lied 10 kills and 11 digs. Marissa
Hatchett paced the Bruins with 17 kills
and six blocks with a .464 hitting per
centage. Natalie Williams added 16
kills and four aces for UCLA, while
Elaine Youngs had 15 kills, nine digs
and four blocks.

volleyball team fell to UCLA on Saturday.
For most Stanford women's volley
ball fans, it might be a case of good
news and bad news, but for Stanford
head coach Don Shaw and his Cardinal
squad, it was a valuable learning expe
rience.
The second-ranked Cardinal split a
two-game series last weekend against
USC and UCLA, prevailing over the
No. 6 Trojans 15-8, 15-3, 9-15, 15-1,
but falling to the top-ranked Bruins
12-15,6-15,15-2, 15-6, 16-14. Stanford
dropped to 9-1 (3-1 in Pacific 10 con
ference play), while USC went to 10-2
(5-1 in the Pac-10) and UCLA
improved to 11-0 (6-0).
On Friday, Stanford began what
Shaw called "the toughest weekend of
volleyball this year" when it faced
USC before 1,789 fans at Maples
Pavilion. The Cardinal took control of
the match early on by taking the first
two games from the Trojans, then
slipped in the third as USC prevailed
15-9.
The Cardinal thundered back
behind the play of Kristi Paaso, Jen
nifer Jackson and tri-captain Bev
Oden, holding USC to a single point in
the fourth game as Stanford cruised to
a 15-1 win to wrap up the match.
Oden led the way for the Cardinal,
posting 16 kills and five blocks, while
Paaso added 14 kills and 11 digs. Jack
son also added 10 kills and 11 digs for
Stanford. For USC, Cica Baccelli was
the only USC player to register double
figures in kills, with 11 for the match.
At Saturday's match, 5,602 specta
tors — the second largest crowd ever
for a Stanford volleyball match —
jammed Maples Pavilion to witness the
Cardinal take on the defending nation
al champion Bruins. Stanford got the
crowd excited early by jumping out to

an early 2-0 lead over UCLA, but the
Bruins stormed back to take the third
and fourth games, allowing only eight
Stanford points along the way.
The Bruins were down 10-6 late in
the fifth game before going on a 5-1
run to tie the match. The two teams
were virtually neck and neck until Bru
ins middle blocker Lisa Hudak's block
gave the Bruins a 15-14 lead. On the
next point, Stanford was called for a
lift, and UCLA took the game and
match from the Cardinal.
Shaw was quick to give the Bruins
credit. "UCLA is a great team," he said
after the game. "They're very confi
dent. Down two games to none, they're
not going to just roll over and die."
Oden noted that while the Cardinal
may have lost the match, they were
anything but intimidated by the
nation's top-ranked squad. "They're
not as unbeatable as we thought. Next
time we see them, it will be a lot differ
ent."
Shaw agreed that the match was a
valuable learning experience for the
Cardinal. "We came in to the match
wanting to know where we stood with
these guys; we're in pretty good stand
ing. We learned a lot tonight, and we
will do a better job in the future
because of it."
The Bruins snapped Stanford's 28-
match Pac-10 winning streak with the
win, a string dating back to October
1990.

'We came in to the match wanting to know where we
stood with these guys; we're in pretty good standing.
We learned a lot tonight, and we will do a better job
in the future because of it.'
— Don Shaw

Oden also led the Cardinal against
UCLA, hitting .355 for the match and
registering 16 kills, five blocks and
four aces. Kristi Paaso contributed 11
kills, 12 digs and four blocks for Stan
ford, while freshman Cary Wendell tal
lied 10 kills and 11 digs. Marissa
Hatchett paced the Bruins with 17 kills
and six blocks with a .464 hitting per
centage. Natalie Williams added 16
kills and four aces for UCLA, while
Elaine Youngs had 15 kills, nine digs
and four blocks.
