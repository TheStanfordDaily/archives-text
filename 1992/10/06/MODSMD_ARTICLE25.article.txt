# More to come: Cardinal will follow up on Irish victory
## 
### 
I have seen the future of Stanford foot
ball, and the view is quite breathtak
ing.
It is a future full of blue-chippers and
bowl games. Of seasons with nine wins and
Saturdays on national TV. A future where
tailbacks outshine tailgaters and marquee
coaches queue up to follow a legend.
It is a future that, after watching our
soiree in South Bend, I'm now sure we
will realize — and soon.
But wait, the skeptics protest. The
Cardinal pulled off a similar stunt two
years past and, simply put, it seemed like
a fluke. They went on to lose three
straight and finish a mediocre 5-6. Why
should we think 1992 any different?
Outside linebacker Ron George has a
first cut response. "Two years ago, after
we won (36-31 in South Bend) we were
hanging from the rafters, screaming 'We
shocked the world!'
"This year, we won. That's it. Not to
downplay this game, but if we don't beat
UCLA, [the Notre Dame] game doesn't
matter. If anything, we have much more
perspective than we did two years ago."
In other words, Denny Green's squad
lacked the maturity that the 1992 Cardi
nal has absorbed. Quarterback Steve

Stenstrom and fullback J.J. Lasley talked
as much about the confidence that the
Notre Dame win gave them going into
the Pacific 10 season as they did about
the win itself.
One upset victory over a top-10 team
(even a "miraculous" victory) does not a
season make. Today's Cardinal knows
this. In 1990, it may have not.
Furthermore, Saturday's win was a
dominating one televised nationally.
Many discredited Stanford after the 1990
win, citing luck and Irish injuries. Last
week's 33-16 thrashing left no doubt
about who the better squad was. As Bill
Walsh said, "Stanford beat Notre Dame
today, pure and simple." Along the way,
they gained respect — an invaluable com
modity in the sea of subjectivity that

floats college football.
Thus, two distinctions from the 1990
upset — a sense of maturity that allows
the Cardinal to stay focused on a hither
to unattainable goal, the Pac-10 champi
onship and newfound respect as one of
the nation's best teams, evidenced by this
week's No. 11 ranking — give rise to the
notion that Saturday's win signaled a
major turning point for the Cardinal pro
gram.
But differences in the games of 1990
and 1992 do not alone guarantee that last
week's win was transformational. The
explanation lies deeper — or, more pre
cisely, at the very top.
The future of Stanford football is rosy
for one special reason: Bill Walsh.
Walsh is clearly blessed with talent
superior to that of the 1990 team, a fact
that shone through in the convincing
manner of Saturday's slaying. To be
sure, no one is placing 1990's three
game, post-upset losing streak on
Green's shoulders. Green did a magnifi
cent job on the Farm.
But the point is this. Walsh brings
something to Stanford that Green (or
anyone else in the game, for that matter)
could not: immediate recognition, expo

sure and reputation. Success in college
football, unlike in any other sport, is
predicated on these three elements.
For decades Stanford was in the
Catch-22 that ensnares so many pro
grams. No success, no reputation. No
reputation, no exposure. No exposure, no
recruits. No recruits, no success.
It sounds like an oversimplification,
and to a certain extent, it may be.
But college football has no playoff sys
tem. The subjective bowl selection com
mittees and wire service polls wield enor
mous influence. In a sense, weaker teams
without the name recognition to land
televised games are "locked out." There
is much truth in the paradox.
Green was in the process of building
his way to the elite ground. With Walsh
we were there immediately. And once you
reach the plateau, the cycle makes it
tough to fall back off.
First, Walsh's arrival landed us a
Pigskin Classic bid, and a chance to lock
horns with Texas A&M, one of the top
five teams in the country. Now NBC
can't get enough of us. Sure we may have
spoiled "Notre Dame Saturday," but Bob
Costas and friends at NFL Live took
time-out from professional highlights to

showcase and analyze the Cardinal's
offensive humiliation of the Irish.
"Vintage 49er football," they lauded.
Vintage recruiting material. You can bet
more than a few 1993 "can't-miss"
prospects were eating it up.
In the fog of all this hypothetical/theo
retical stuff, we haven't even mentioned
the simple fact that Walsh is doing one
heck of a coaching job — and he'll be here
for a while. As Costas tried to say, these
(often young) defensive coordinators try
ing to match wits with Walsh is like Dan
Qua. . . oh, you get the point. Walsh had
Lou Holtz's head spinning; one can only
imagine the stupor the Weenies will be
thrown into come November.
You won't find a Cardinal player or
coach who will tell you so — nor should
they, for no one needs to stock the Bruin
or Husky locker room with motivational
news clippings — but Saturday's perfor
mance was more than a "tremendous win
for Stanford University." From this van
tage point, it was the dawn of a new era.
Don't expect to see dusk any time
soon.
