# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
For those who don cardinal and white and
compete in the sporting arena for Stanford,
collegiate life is a challenge. These student-ath
letes must handle adversity both in the class
room and on the field of play, and like an old
watch, must "keep on ticking" in spite of it all.
The Daily's Athletes of the Week — John
Lynch and Sarah Rafanelli — embody the
resilience so necessary for survival and suc

cess in a Cardinal uniform.
Senior safety John Lynch came to Stan
ford by way of Solano Beach, Calif., as a
quarterback. Forced to learn and specialize
on defense at the beginning of his college
career, he came into his own during the 1990
and 1991 seasons, forming part of a solid
young Cardinal unit.
The hard-hitting Lynch had been part of
Stanford's previous upset of Notre Dame,
but he could not have predicted the course of
events that would lead to the dominance dis
played by the Cardinal over the Fighting
Irish last Saturday.
Lynch, who shook off a first-half concus
sion and went on to record nine tackles and
make an interception in the Irish end zone
that would prove to be one of the contest's
turning points, was named Pacific 10 Confer
ence Defensive Player of the Week for his
exploits. Teammate Glyn Milburn took
Offensive Player of the Week honors as Stan
ford swept the major individual categories.

Junior forward Sarah Rafanelli has been a
catalyst for the Cardinal women's soccer
team from the moment she arrived on cam
pus two years ago. However, now that she
has taken her squad to an all-time high No. 2
in the polls and a perfect 9-0 record, Rafanel
li has become a "marked woman" of sorts.
Last weekend, in the Notre Dame Golden
Dome Classic, the Oakland native was the
victim of several attacks in which an oppo

nent was playing her instead of the ball.
Still, Rafanelli pulled through to lead the
Cardinal to a 3-1 victory over South Florida
and a 3-0 triumph over the host Irish.
In tallying two goals against Notre Dame
and one against the Bulls, Rafanelli pulled
into a tie for the Stanford team lead with
nine on the season, to go along with five
assists.
