# Band, Athletics Dept. reach understanding
## Announcers reinstated; boycott averted 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
With their suspension lifted by the De
partment of Athletics last night, the Stan
ford Band's announcers — and the band it
self — will perform at Saturday's football
game after all.
The department and band also agreed to
negotiate guidelines identifying unaccept
able halftime shows by the end of the sea
son, according to Asst. Band Manager Jesse
Johannesen.
The band had considered boycotting the
upcoming game against UCLA if the the Ath
letics Department did not reinstate the an
nouncers, Band Manager Casey O'Hara said.
Announcers Rajesh Krishnan and Chris
Chow were suspended after the Sept. 26
San Jose State game for telling the audi
ence they had just seen a remake of a 1985
show because a spoof of Stanford's new
president had been nixed.
The Athletics Department on Sept. 24
rejected the halftime show, titled "The
Unauthorized Biography of Gerhard
Casper," calling it an embarrassment.
For telling the crowd that they had not
been allowed to perform their original
show, Asst. Athletic Director Tom Beckett
indefinitely suspended the announcers
after the game, according to O'Hara.
After an hour-long meeting with the

band's staff last night, Beckett said "every
thing worked out great." But he and Ath
letic Director Ted Leland refused to com
ment on the details of the discussion.
Johannesen said the announcers' com
ment was called "a breach of faith." Men
tioning the show would have been all right
if it had been cleared with the Athletics De
partment first, he added.
Beckett and Leland were upset because
the band "took our own liberties with their
microphones," he said. The announcers
apologized and promised never to stray
from the script, according to Johannesen.
"We can hope that the trust is back," he
said.
O'Hara said he was "very relieved" that
he didn't have to decide whether to perform
Saturday.
He wrote a letter last week to Beckett
and Leland, O'Hara said, explaining the
band's position and "requesting that they
reinstate our announcers.
"If we don't have announcers, there is
no way we can do a field show," he said.
The letter also suggested developing a
set of guidelines for future shows, which he
said should be a good way to "avoid future
problems.
"In the past, we've had to rely on band
members' good taste," he said. "Sometimes
it's been bent a little."
But he was cautious about the
agreement, saying the guidelines
must be "reasonable" or band
members will protest. "I don't
think we should let them censor
us too much," O'Hara added. "I
don't really like to submit our
scripts in the first place."
The Athletics Department had
suggested using their announcer
instead of the band's, but O'Hara
rejected the idea. "I don't think
we should have to settle for that,"
he said.
He was also skeptical about the
idea that the problems of the past
two weeks could have been avoid
ed if the announcers had just
received prior approval for their
last statement.
"Personally, I don't know if
the Athletics Department would
have cleared it,"he said.
O'Hara was positive about the
meeting's results, however. "It's
a good sign for future relations

between the band and the Athlet
ics Department," he said.
Leland called the meeting "a
good exchange."
"We just love the band and
want to continue working with
them," he added.
It became standard practice for
the Athletics Department to
review the band's plans after a
show at the University of Oregon
two years ago.
The band was suspended for
one game in October 1990 after
they parodied the debate over the
endangered spotted owl. Oregon
fans booed the show, and the uni
versity's athletic director asked
Stanford to leave the band at
home the following year.
The show rejected by the Ath
letics Department two weeks ago
jokingly referred to Casper as a
member of the Chicago Mafia
who "decided to move in on the
turf of his western rival, Don Don
Kennedy."
The last script rejected by the
Athletics Department was about a
woman who had a 300-pound
ovarian cyst removed at Stanford
Hospital a year ago.
