# Lack of funds thwarts plans to spread SUNet
## ASSU loan still leaves University short 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
A University plan to extend computing
facilities to Row houses and other campus
residences is on hold due to a lack of funds,
despite a $250,000 loan offer from the
ASSU.
The University had proposed to provide
computer clusters with SUNet hookups to
all currently unconnected places on cam
pus — including the Cowell Cluster, frater
nities and other Row houses — and im
prove existing facilities in Escondido Vil
lage within the next three years.
The ASSU Senate had hoped to acceler
ate that plan. It voted at its final meeting
last year to extend a line of credit to the Of
fice of Residential Computing to cover the
cost of project, which would have allowed
much of it to be completed this year.
But currently, the University has not
committed to any funding for the project,
and even if money is secured, it would be bud
geted over two to three years, said Director of
Residential Computing Jeffrey Merriman.
"What [the ASSU] was hoping was that
we could really push and get it done by this
spring," Merriman said.
The ASSU "is a resource for us if we can
pay it back," Merriman said. "We have iden

tified avenues for funding and are working
on finding someone to guarantee them."
Merriman said he is currently negotiat-

ing with Housing and Food
Services about obtaining
money from their budget,
but that no final plans have
been made.
Senate Chair Ron
Brown said that if Resi
dential Computing takes
the loan, it will be provided
interest-free and could be
repaid by University fund-

ing during the following years.
The idea was that if "the senate could do
something getting computers to the Row
and the rest of campus, [it] would be a use
ful thing to do," Brown said.
Graduate student Neil Crellin, an au
thor of the bill, said, "Generally the idea
was that if the money could be made avail
able in the next three years, the ASSU
would front the money [for acceleration]."
Merriman said he plans to meet with
ASSU officials shortly to discuss the status
of the funding.
Brown said that although the bill was
passed last year the line of credit will remain


Brown
available.
Providing clusters to residences
became an issue during last year's
Council of Presidents election.
John Hall, a member of the

defeated Students First COP
slate, said he thought it was an
important issue to students.
According to Hall, the slate dis
cussed the acceleration idea and
included it in their platform.
But "no one was really in a
position to follow up on that [after
"I Prefer Not to Have a COP" won
the election]," Hall said.
