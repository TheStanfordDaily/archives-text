# Its collection boxes rarely filled, LaIR cracks down on freeloaders

The Tresidder computer cluster has
adopted a new system which requires stu
dents to pay in advance for laser printing
and keeps track of the number of pages
they print.
Under the new system, called MachTen,
students will have to open an account with
Libraries and Information Resources and
buy credits before using the laser printers
or Deskwriters. The system automatically
deducts the proper amount for each page,
which varies depending on the printer

used.
MachTen is designed to solve some of
the problems of the old "honor" system,
which depended on students to drop
change into collection boxes to pay for the
pages they printed. Since only a fraction of
students actually paid, the cluster had to
charge 20 cents per page to cover its costs.
Because it will now be impossible to
print without paying, prices will be low
ered while still allowing LaIR to break
even. Phil Gibson, manager of the cluster,
said printing will now cost six cents per
laser-printed page and four cents per page
printed on a Deskwriter. Printing on an

Imagewriter will remain free.
Credits can be bought in units of $ 1, $5,
$10 and $20. But "we want people to buy
more than a dollar," Gibson said. "I think
people who buy $10 to 20 will be happy
when it comes to paper time."
Although there will be no refunds
given, unused credits will carry over from
one quarter to the next until the end of the
academic year.
Since users will be able to print from
any computer in the cluster, the new sys
tem should also alleviate long lines to use
the printers.
Stanford is "on the cutting edge," said

Gibson. "I know of no (other university
that) has done this with a [Macintosh]
cluster."
The residential clusters are using a
similar system that keeps track of print
ing through Next machines, Gibson said.
Eventually, Gibson said, he hopes to make
the residential and Tresidder systems
compatible.
The technology that MachTen uses
has been available on Unix for some
time, but the problem was incorporating
this technology with the Macintosh, he
said.
This summer, the system was devel

oped by Tresidder LaIR and Tenon Inter
systems.
MachTen was chosen over an alterna
tive card-reader system from Xerox much
like the one used with photocopiers in li
braries, Gibson said. LaIR rejected the
Xerox plan because the company only of
fered a 24-hour response time to foe me
chanical problems.
Students who had papers due right
away would need the problems fixed in a
few hours, he said.
Gibson said he hopes people will be pa
tient with LaIR as these new changes are
implemented.
