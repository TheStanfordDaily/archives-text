# She came in through the bathroom window
## Unwelcome opossum tossed into EBF 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
A dead, partially skinned opos
sum was tossed through an open
bathroom window at the Enchant
ed Broccoli Forest last weekend, ac
cording to Stanford Police.
The animal was removed from
the campus cooperative and incin
erated, according to Sergeant Del
Bandy, who called the incident "a
little gruesome." Police have no
leads in the case, he added.
EBF House Manager Carl Gold
schmidt said a resident called police
after discovering the dead opossu m
near the window late Saturday
night.
The animal was "about the size

of a small cat," he said, and was not
decomposed. "It didn't smell too
much."
Police took some pictures and
wrote a report before removing it in
a bag, Goldschmidt said.
Resident Assistant Mike Franz,
a senior, said that while he was un
sure how long the dead animal had
been inside, it couldn't have been
"more than a day."
The discovery was "pretty
gross," according to Franz.
This is the second time in less
than a week EBF has been the tar
get of a crime.
Six UC-Berkeley students were
arrested last Tuesday for allegedly
stealing a vacuum cleaner and fire
extinguisher from EBF as part of
their fraternity's rush.

But Franz said he doesn't think
the opossum incident was retalia
tion for the arrests. "I doubt
there's a connection," he said.
The individual responsible could
be charged with cruelty to animals,
Bandy said, but only if police could
prove he or she killed the opossum.
