Can t Wait Until Monday.
At Microsoft, your weekends are almost as
exhilarating as your weekdays.
Your pulse beats faster. You feel an energy,
a current of excitement you can't find any
where else. Working independently, everyone
pulls together for a common goal.
Welcome to another day at Microsoft.
Microsoft is the ideal environment for peo
ple who want as much excitement from their
jobs as they enjoy in their spare time. Which
is really saying something in the Pacific
Northwest. Because skiing, hiking, sailing,
biking and mountain climbing make for some
thrilling diversions. At Microsoft, you can
have it both ways: Dynamic work and play. If
you'd rather approach life as a participant
than a spectator, come talk to Microsoft.
Come find out more about Microsoft by
attending our upcoming event.
Microsoft is an Equal Opportunity
Employer and supports workforce diversity.
