Despite the recent barrage
of budget cuts, Stanford is forg
ing forward into the computer
frontier by installing state-of
the-art computer equipment in
most residential clusters, with
more high-tech equipment ar
riving in the next few months.
According to Director of
Residential Computing Jeff
Merriman, corporate dona
tions, savings from previous
years and the scaling back of
the staff in the Office of Resi
dential Education all con
tributed to making $420,000 in
improvements possible.
Apple Macintosh, Digital
Equipment Corporation and
Next Corporation all made do
nations to the project.
In dorm computer clusters,
Macintosh SEs have been re
placed by Macintosh LCIIs.
Each cluster will still have ei
ther a Macintosh Ilsi or Ilci.
Each cluster will house a
Quadra 700, one of the newest
and most powerful computers
Macintosh produces, a Next
Workstation and a Next laser
