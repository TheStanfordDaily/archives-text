# Campus clusters updated
## 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
Despite the recent barrage
of budget cuts, Stanford is forg
ing forward into the computer
frontier by installing state-of
the-art computer equipment in
most residential clusters, with
more high-tech equipment ar
riving in the next few months.
According to Director of
Residential Computing Jeff
Merriman, corporate dona
tions, savings from previous
years and the scaling back of
the staff in the Office of Resi
dential Education all con
tributed to making $420,000 in
improvements possible.
Apple Macintosh, Digital
Equipment Corporation and
Next Corporation all made do
nations to the project.
In dorm computer clusters,
Macintosh SEs have been re
placed by Macintosh LCIIs.
Each cluster will still have ei
ther a Macintosh Ilsi or Ilci.
Each cluster will house a
Quadra 700, one of the newest
and most powerful computers
Macintosh produces, a Next
Workstation and a Next laser

printer, which will replace the
older Hewlett-Packard Deskwrit
er in each cluster.
Furthermore, Merriman said,
beginning next week, students will
have access to an Apple Onescan
ner in their dorm cluster. Scan
ners allow a computer to read from
a printed page and transcribe the
information onto its screen.
They will be distributed to the
clusters along with the Quadras
next week.
However, the seven small Row
house clusters will receive Macin
tosh LCIIs. They will also retain
their Hewlett-Packard Deskwriters.
All dorm clusters will remain
connected to the Stanford Uni
versity Network (SUNet).
In-room connections to SUNet,
which make modems obsolete,
have been expanded to selected
residences. The technology has

previously only been available to
students who live in Rains, Roble
Hall, Manzanita Park, Escondido
Village and Kimball Hall.
This year, students in Laguni
ta Count and Manzanita North
and South will benefit from these
in-room connections. Branner
and Toyon will receive on-line
service winter quarter.
Because there will be a charge
for laser printing, students need
to obtain a Leland account before
they can use the laserprinter in
their cluster. The new Next Work
stations will keep track of the
numbers of pages students print.
This process is similar to
MachTen, the one the Tresidder
computer cluster uses. I mage writ
ers can still be used free of charge
without an electronic-mail account.
Residential Computer Coordina
tors are in charge of the payment of
fees for in-dorm laser printing.
The clusters are currently locat
ed in all houses with first-year stu
dents as well as in some upperclass
houses and graduate apartments.
