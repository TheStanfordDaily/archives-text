Poll: Clinton has strong lead
NEW YORK (AP) — A national poll released
yesterday showed Ross Perot getting the support
of only one in 10 voters, even after they had a few
days to hear about his campaign.
The NBC News poll taken Sunday and Monday
showed Bill Clinton leading with 46 percent, Pres
ident Bush at 32 percent, Perot at 10 percent and
12 percent uncommitted. Perot announced his
candidacy Thursday, then virtually secluded him
self except for a television interview.
The poll also showed weakness in the candidates'
support. Half of those who say they would vote for
Perot have some reservations or support him only
slightly. That also goes for 46 percent of Bush sup
porters and 42 percent of Clinton supporters.
Candidates prepare for debate
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush stud

ied at the White House yesterday for Sunday's
leadoff debate, while Bill Clinton summoned
stand-ins for mock go-rounds in Kansas City —
including a Washington lawyer to play Bush and
an Oklahoma congressman to play Ross Perot.
Clinton planned to hole up in battleground
Missouri for the latter part of the week, practicing
and trying to figure out Bush attack avenues in
advance of the real show, set for Sunday in St.
Louis.
Bush charted his own debate tactics from the
White House in a three-hour session with Chief of
Staff James A. Baker 111, budget director Richard
Darman and other top policy aides.
Perot's staff, meanwhile, said the independent
candidate hasn't done any debate rehearsals and
doesn't plan any.
"I think it's safe to say Perot will be Perot,"
said staffer Orson Swindle.
Bush hopes the debates will shake up the final
few weeks of Campaign '92.
