POSTON, Ariz. (AP) — More than 1,400 peo
ple gathered on a desert Indian reservation yes
terday to dedicate a monument at the site of the
largest of the camps used to intern people of
Japanese ancestry during World War 11.
The three-story high concrete obelisk was built
on the former site of the Poston War Relocation
Center, where nearly 20,000 Japanese immigrants
and their U.S.-born children lived behind barbed
wire from 1942 to 1945.
"Fifty years ago, the failed leadership of our
country condemned guiltless people into concen
tration camps," said George Ikeda, 70, a former
internee from Emmaus, Pa.
The commemoration came 50 years after Pres
ident Roosevelt signed an order paving the way
for the forcible evacuation of Japanese-Americans
from the West Coast on the grounds they were a

threat to national security.
Boy bares for Barbara Bush
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) - Barbara
Bush was giving hugs to a group of toddlers who
had just sung a song for her yesterday when one
little boy asked the first lady, "Want to see my
jammies?"
When Mrs. Bush said she did, the 3-year-old
proudly pulled down his sweatpants to reveal
Mickey Mouse undershorts.
Mrs. Bush at first stared wide-eyed as the boy
stood there with his pants down around his
ankles.
Then "she just cracked up laughing. We all
did," said Elizabeth Galster, children's program
director for the Care Castle, a day-care program
staffed by elderly volunteers. "It was quite
funny."
