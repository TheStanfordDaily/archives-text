# Abortion battle in high court
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Bush administra
tion urged the Supreme Court yesterday to keep fed
eral judges from stopping abortion clinic blockades,
but a lawyer for clinic owners said that would cripple
abortion rights.
Justice Department lawyer John Roberts Jr. said
the administration does not defend the tactics of
Operation Rescue members and other anti-abortion
protesters who block access to clinics, but he argued
they should be held accountable in state courts.
Those who engage in unlawful acts at clinics lack
the necessary motive — ill will toward women — to

bring their conduct under federal scrutiny, Roberta
said. "They are targeting (women) not because of who
they are but because of what they are doing," he said.
Deborah Ellis, a lawyer representing Virginia
abortion clinic operators, said removing federal court
authority to issue injunctions against blockades
would leave women without adequate protection.
Clinic owners would have to turn to state courts for
help, she said, and many local police departments called
on to enforce state court injunctions say they lack the
resources to deal with massive demonstrations.
The right of women to have an abortion is not
directly at issue in the case before the justices, but
rather a post-Civil War federal law, the Ku Klux
Klan Act of 1871. It bans conspiracies aimed at vio
lating an individual's constitutional rights.
Ellis likened anti-abortion protesters who partic
ipate in clinic blockades to KKK members who
intimidated black students during the early days of
school desegregation efforts.
"If equal protection means anything," she said,
"it must cover the taking away of a (right) that only
the protected class has. The denial of women's
reproductive rights denies women the right to con
trol their destiny."
But Jay Sekulow, Operation Rescue's lawyer, said
his clients oppose abortion, not women.
"If men and women of good conscience can dis
agree over abortion, how can opposition be an invid
ious act?" he said. "It cannot."
The legal and political battle was waged outside
the high court's stately building as well.
On the public sidewalk in front of the court build
ing, dozens of activists on both sides of the national
debate shouted slogans at each other and vied for
news media attention.
The groups' leaders, talking to reporters after the
hour-long court argument, spent little time debating
the legal points.
"The federal judiciary should not be used to ham
mer pro-lifers," said Randall Terry, Operation Res
cue's founder. "This is a horrible injustice."
James Bopp Jr. of the National Right to Life
Committee said his organization does not advocate
illegal conduct but accused abortion clinic owners of
trying to "make opposition to abortion tantamount
to a federal crime."
Patricia Ireland, president of the National Orga
nization for Women, said, "Today, George Bush
stands on the side of those vigilante mobs."
