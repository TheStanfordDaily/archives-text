## Editorial Shady phone pricing 
### 
LAST THURSDAY, Commu
nication Services shut off
service to all those residents
of dorms and on-campus apart
ments who did not officially regis
ter for their phone lines.
Students who called their own
number heard a kindly message
telling them their line was no
longer in service. The friendly peo
ple at 7-HELP directed them down
to Forsythe Hall to fill out some
simple forms.
Then they charged them $33.
The installation fee is a throw
back to a time when a union work
er in a blue uniform actually came
to your residence and played
around with some dangling wires.
There is no longer any manual
labor involved.
Much of the installation fee goes
to cover overhead (read: indirect
costs) in the way of staff and equip

ment purchases. Little goes to the
staff in front of Tresidder and at
Forsythe who helped applicants fill
out their card and informed them
of their phone number.
Many residents returned to
their dorms to find an activated
line already waiting for them, no
service required. And many found
out their number by simply asking
the operator what number they
were calling from — taking less
then several seconds of their time.
Communication Services is a
non-profit organization which, in
the past, has given users refunds
at the end of the year after discov
ering they are under budget.
If overhead needs to be covered,
it would be better to charge more
for phone calls or monthly service
— places where overhead is
expected — and not for an installa
tion which occurred years ago.
