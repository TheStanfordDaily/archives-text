# Wanted: study area

WITH COLLEGE LIFE'S
assortment of joys and
sorrows, the last thing a
Stanford student should need to
worry about is a clean, safe, well
lighted place for uninterrupted
study.
Yet year after wearisome year,
Stanford students' pursuit of
knowledge has been impeded by
stingy library hours.
Meyer and Green libraries have
functioned as the premier loca
tions for 'late-night' studying for
some time now.
Whereas other colleges have
libraries open 24 hours, Meyer and
Green both close at midnight
weekdays — just when many
Stanford students need a quiet
place to study. And on weekends,
the situation is even worse —
Meyer and Green close at 6 p.m.
Fridays and only Green is open
Saturdays, and only until 5 p.m.
In his inaugural address last
Friday, University President

Casper urged his audience not to
forget "that burning the midnight
oil, hard work in study and labora
tory, remains the rule at Stan
ford." Yet his administration has
made no moves to augment — or
reinstate — services that will pro
vide students a comfortable and
secure place for that "midnight
oil" to burn.
He must remember that the
average Stanford student lacks a
"conventional" schedule, and
therefore finds it necessary to
study well into the wee hours of
the morning.
To promote Casper's dedication
to undergraduate education, - the
University should establish a 24-
hour study center, tailored to the
needs of the undergraduate and
graduate communities. This center
need not be maintained with large
staff pools — librarians need not
be kept longer than their normal
hours — just lighting, adequate
security and a quiet place to study.
