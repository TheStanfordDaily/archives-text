ABC News will broadcast its "World News
Tonight" show from the Stanford campus this after
noon as part of a three-day focus on Northern Cali
fornia voters in the upcoming presidential election.
Peter Jennings will anchor the live show at 3:30
p.m. from an undisclosed location on campus, ac
cording to ABC News spokesperson Arnot Walker.
Stanford was selected as a broadcast site because
of its close ties to Silicon Valley, Walker said. "It's
very representative of the community."
"(ABC News) approached us with the supposi
tion that the election will be decided by suburban
voters," said Jack Hubbard, associate director of
Stanford News Service. "Silicon Valley is one of the
most important suburban areas in the country, and
it wouldn't be there without Stanford."
Rich Kurovsky, director of University relations,
said another factor in ABC's decision to use Stan
ford as a backdrop was that the campus is a "scenic
venue known throughout the world."
The broadcast will not involve an audience. "It's
something we prefer people watch on TV," Walker
said. "People need to realize that we're talking to 15
to 20 million people across the country. It's high
pressure time."
Walker said ABC has been working in the area for
a week to prepare for the show. Last night, Jennings
anchored "World News Tonight" from San Jose.
The network will have a crew of eight to 10 peo
ple working at Stanford during the day to set up for
the show, Walker said.
At the end of yesterday's broadcast, Jennings
said tonight's program from
Stanford will "focus on jobs and
technology and the struggle to
make America competitive in the
next century."
But Walker would not reveal
specific details of the show. "We
have 23 minutes of news time and
no one is able to predict what's
going to be in the broadcast. It
really depends on what is happen
ing in the world," he said.
Hubbard also said that Richard
Sergay, a veteran ABC News pro

ducer who was a John S. Knight
Fellow studying on campus last
year, is working on the production
crew and waÂ» instrumental in
bringing the show to Stanford.
Jennings will also be taping a
"focus group" of hand-picked area
voters at the Hoover Institution
to be aired Thursday on "World
News Tonight."
The focus groups are designed
"to see what area voters are con
cerned about," said Walker. ABC
has previously taped these group
discussions in Charlottesville and
New York, he said.
"World News Tonight" can be
seen at 5:30 p.m. on KGO-TV,
Channel 7.
