## Growing up in Washington 
### 
IHAD PLANNED TO LEARN a lot
about politics and government from
my Washington internship. I did.
What I really hadn't anticipated was that
I would learn about myself in the pro
cess.
I thought I was pretty open-minded
and liberal — I was, after all, a Stanford
student. My summer internship, though,
showed me I had a bit more maturing to
do, a lot more lessons to learn.
No, it wasn't earth-shattering, but it
was one of those truly humbling experi
ences that you hope to encounter as
rarely as possible — even though you
learn from it.
I was one of only two summer interns
working in my office. The other guy, Jim,
was a first-year law student. He had been
working for three weeks before I came, so
he knew the ropes.
As I settled into my duties he showed
me what to do and how to cut through as
much red tape as possible.
Since he was the only one my age in
the office we spent time together over
lunch hour and went out a few times at
night. We became good friends.
In the middle of the summer he got
involved in a relationship with someone
he had met in Washington. I naturally
tried to be friendly and curious and ask
about her. As I asked questions, he sort
of evaded them or answered in vague gen
eralities.

I was a bit upset that he wouldn't tell
me about her since we were friends. I
would certainly tell him about my girl
friend, at least her name. The only prob
lem was that in my exuberance to talk
"guy talk" I didn't consider the fact that
he had a boyfriend.
Finally, I overheard him talking to
another woman in the office about a pic
nic he had gone on with JefT.
I just didn't register what he was talk
ing about. I finally asked who he had
gone out with and he said, "my friend,
JefT."
Immediately I understood what an ass
I had been for the past three weeks and I
was so ashamed I left the room.
It wasn't that flushed feeling you
get when you say something stupid and
get embarrassed, it was shame. I
couldn't remember ever feeling like
that before.
I sat in the next room on my chair try
ing not to admit how blind I had been
when the other woman in the conversa
tion came in looking for me. "You look
confused," she said, smiling.
I explained to her that I wasn't con
fused anymore, just ashamed. She under
stood (her best friend from college was
gay) and said that the best thing to do
was to act the same and to be honest if I
had any questions.
Act the same. It's distressing to think
that I need someone to tell me to act nor

mal. I was, though, in uncharted waters.
He is the first friend I've had who is gay.
Probably the part that troubles me the
most is not my reaction after I found out
— we still went out to bars and had a
good time.
The thing that disturbs me is that I
didn't even consider the possibility he
was gay. It never crossed my mind.
I usually pride myself on being a pro
gressive thinker, recognizing other
points of view.
I feel uncomfortable when someone
utters racial slurs, deplore bigotry and
have learned to voice my objections to
them both.
But in a way, I was allowing myself
to perpetuate the tunnel vision with
which many people view the gay com
munity.
Maybe I assumed that Stanford had
banished my ignorance and made me
aware enough, sensitive enough to deal
with anyone or anybody. But then again,
I never did talk to Jim about it. I guess I
still have some work to do.
