English Department boasts well-qualified teachers

ILOVE A GOOD SNEER, but my
pleasure in reading Martin Ander
son's lecture to Jeremy Cohen was
marred by Anderson's question:
"Then why are all the freshman
English courses being taught and
graded this fall by graduate students,
some of them not even English
majors?"
Self-centeredly, I wondered, "why is
he asking Jeremy?" The truth is that
the proposition Anderson's question
contains is completely false. The fresh
man English program employs a staff
of experienced lecturers.
These men and women are profes
sional specialists in the teaching of
composition.
Most of them have advanced degrees,
have written textbooks, given confer
ence papers, developed innovative
teaching methods.
They also serve as mentors and hec
tors to the graduate students whom we
are preparing for careers in university
teaching.

One of our lecturers, Jane Emery, is
the author of "Rose Macaulay: A Writ
er's Life," recently reviewed on the
front page of the New York Times Book
Review.
Running my eye down the Autumn
quarter roster, I see instructors with
nine, 10, 11, 20, 23 and 30 years of
teaching experience.
We also use graduate students with a
good deal of experience in teaching
composition, and we do a very good job
— through ongoing workshops, visita
tions and conferences — training our
second-year graduate students, many
who arrive here with teaching experi
ence.
This year we have on the fresh
man English staff six professors
from the English Department:
Robert Warrior and Suvir Kaul, who
are beginning their first years with
us, and Michael Tratner, who has a
great deal of experience in teaching
composition and is fully conversant
with the body of theory relating to

this major field.
We also have three nationally
famous scholars and writers: Elizabeth
Traugott, a former dean of the Univer
sity; from Linguistics, Gilbert Sorrenti
no, a major fiction writer from our Cre
ative Writing program; and Bliss
Carnochan, 18th century scholar, for
mer dean and head of Stanford's
English Department and the first direc
tor of the Humanities Center.
Several of these teachers have asked
to meet together with some of our lec
turers and advanced graduate students,
not to teach them about composition,
but to learn from them.
Martin Anderson did not check with
anyone in freshman English in prepar
ing for his study of impostors in univer
sities — certainly a fruitful topic —
preferring instead to say what he want
ed to be the truth to people who want
what he says to be the truth.
To draw him to my side momentari
ly, I will say that if we were left with
out our lecturers and experienced grad

uate students, we would be in serious
trouble.
Anderson's irresponsibility in com
menting on his own university, where a
simple telephone call might have
enlightened him, ought to make readers
wary of his other findings.
He might be interested to know that
we guide our students through a
research paper, hoping to show them
how to avoid the sort of errors he dis
plays in his letter.
And even a graduate student, one
who "was not even an English
major," might comment on his sen
tence beginning: "The shaky logic and
rigor of (Cohen'sl argument falls
away. .
Non-traditional grammarians would
perhaps fault me for pointing this sen
tence out, but I have an idea that
Anderson prefers a traditional
approach.
