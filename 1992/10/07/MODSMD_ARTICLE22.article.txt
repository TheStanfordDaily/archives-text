# Rogers should learn valid reasons for not using 'bad' labels
## 
### 
I think that the column by Brett
Rogers in Monday's paper deserves a
response. The tone of the article was
light, but it is an issue that affects most
of the campus in one way or another.
Brett's confusion is understandable.
The "politically correct" terms that are
so popular do not always seen reason
able, and it is not always obvious why
certain words, when used in certain
ways, are offensive.
The first thing to remember is that
not all members of any given group will

feel the same way about a label. For
instance, if you were to ask all the
females you know about the use of the
word "girl," you would get many differ
ent responses as to what is appropriate
and what is not.
It is only fair to assume that different
people have different associations with
certain words.
The other thing to remember is ety
mology, the history and basis for a word.
Most of us are not aware of the origin of
the words we use, and although their lit
eral meanings may not carry over into
the present, the ideas they reflect often
do.
For instance, as an Asian, I am wary
of the word "oriental" because its defini
tion is the opposite of "occidental" (of a
city or civilized place; familiar). It means

"strange" or "different," occasionally
even "uncivilized."
The word "handicapped" came into
being during a time when those who
were differently abled were forced to
make their keep by begging, holding caps
in their hands. Obviously these are both
stereotypes the stated groups (and oth
ers) are trying to avoid.
If you are confused about why a word
might be offensive, ask. The people you
question might even appreciate your
taking the time to understand their situ
ations.
Stanford seems big on separatism,
but at an institution of learning our
greatest responsibility is to learn from
each other.
