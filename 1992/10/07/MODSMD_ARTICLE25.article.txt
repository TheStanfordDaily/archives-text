# Beyond the green bin: Center recycles 30 percent of waste
## 
### Lenora Chu 
It's a dirty job, but somebody's
got to do it.
Surprisingly, workers at the
Stanford Recycling Center don't
really mind sorting by hand the
contents of the nearly 3,000 green
recycling bins around campus — a
job that seems despicable to most.
"The smell isn't too bad,
although some days I just want to
run home and shower after four
hours," worker Susan Kulakows
ki said.
And occasionally, the job even
yields unexpected treasures for
the employees.

Workers say they
dread the can-crushing
line most because the
soda cans often house
swarms of bees.

One seasoned veteran of the
center recently found old issues of
the San Francisco Chronicle —
including issues with headlines of
the stock market crash of 1929,
the first landing on the moon and
the 1963 Kennedy assassination
— in the recycling bins outside
the Hoover Institution.
"I should frame them," he says
proudly.
Each workday at 8 a.m., the
center's staff members rev up
their truck engines to make their
first of two daily rounds, collect
ing full recycling bins and replac
ing them with empty ones.
Back at the center, located on
Pampas Lane, workers dump
each bin's contents onto conveyor
belts and sort recyclables into sep
arate bins for aluminum, glass,

white paper and newsprint.
When sorting white paper from
fax paper, Heidi Clark, the cen
ter's public education manager,
finds it difficult to distinguish one
from the other. "I usually taste it
to tell the difference," she says.
"They both have distinctive
tastes."
In addition to sorting, workers
must remove contaminants such
as paper clips and leftover food.
About six to eight Stanford stu
dents, in addition to 14 full-time
workers, put in eight-hour shifts
each day.
"What makes it gross,"
Kulakowski said, "is that people
don't recycle correctly."
If, for instance, a half-full Coke
can is spilled in a white paper bin,
then the entire contents can
become soggy and unrecyclable.
"Contamination is always a prob
lem," she says.
Often, pots and pans, clothes,
diapers and other random rub
bish are discovered as well.
While some people are careless
about recycling, others are
overzealous. Just last week, one
worker discovered a soda can
stuffed with sewing needles in the
aluminum bin.
Once separated, aluminum
cans are crushed, glass is sorted
by color, and plastics and card
board are pressed into bales.
Workers say they dread the can
crushing line most because the
soda cans often house swarms of
bees.
From the center, the materials
are transported to facilities in San
Jose where they are further pro
cessed to be formed into new cans,
bottles or paper.
Stanford's recycling center
recycles 30 percent of all campus
waste, one of the highest yields
among California recycling pro
grams. For this outstanding rate,
the center will receive a 1992

Environmental Business Award
from the Peninsula Conservation
Center later this month.
But recycling efforts will be
futile, Kulakowski says, if people
don't buy recycled products,
which are usually more expen
sive.
"It's a chicken and egg thing,"
she explained. "You can't expect
high prices to go away until peo
ple start buying."

And while there is currently a
surplus of newsprint and glass,
aluminum cans and high quality
white paper remain a hot com
modity in recycling facilities.
According to Steve McAffrey,
the center's recycling coordinator,
people frequently steal cans from
the recycling barrels because
many grocery stores pay by the
pound. "Thefts are reported to
the police," he said, "but it is not

a crime wave."
The center will be moving to a
new location on campus by the
fire station, possibly in November
— a project that has been in the
works for a long time, McAffrey
said. The move will allow all the
sorting to be done in one area for
increased efficiency, rather than
in two separate yards as is done
now.
After spending long, smelly

hours in the baking sun, seeing
the piles of sorted recyclables and
anticipating a positive impact on
the environment is a "natural
fringe benefit," Kulakowski said.
"Although you don't feel the
concrete benefits to the environ
ment immediately, recycling ben
efits your children and your chil
dren's children," McAfTrey said.
"It's like putting money in the
bank."

A worker at the Stanford Recycling Center separates plastics from other materials. The center recycles about 30 percent of campus waste
by collecting recyclable newspaper, white paper, aluminum, glass and plastic from nearly 3,000 recycling bins on campus.
