## Fighting crimes of the century with the tips of their fingers The 						art and science of fingerprinting keeps developing new tools to prepare law enforcement for the next century 
### Aaron Thode Editorial staff 
One year after Stanford Uni
versity enrolled its first stu
dents, a woman named Rojas
murdered her two sons in La
Plata, Argentina.
In light of the tens of mil
lions of murders committed by
humanity since then, her small
sin might have been quickly for
gotten — had she not cut her
self.
Juan Vucetich, a local police
officer, matched a bloody fin
gerprint on the doorpost with
samples taken from Rojas. She
confessed, and thereby became
the first criminal convicted on
the basis of fingerprint evi
dence.
A century later, the art of
finding, developing and match
ing fingerprints has become
synonymous with criminal
investigation.
From Agatha Christie to
James Bond, crime fiction writ
ers have forever etched into the
public imagination the image of
a dour-faced detective dusting a
gun for prints.
Having just celebrated Stan
ford's centennial, it seems fit
ting to briefly overview the
progress of 100 years of finger
printing technology.
Whenever a finger touches
an object, a tiny amount of per
spiration is left behind on its

Every one of the millions of prints collected
over the past century is unique. From six
months before birth to beyond death, each
individual is endowed with his or her own
set of ridges that cannot be sandpapered or
burned off — as many criminals have
painfully discovered.

surface. Most of this "latent
print" is water, but 1.5 percent
of it contains solids like salt,
urea, lipids, and proteins. It is
the presence of these com
pounds that make the recording
of fingerprints possible.
Brad Herran, who is in
charge of preserving property
and evidence in the Palo Alto
Police Department, said using a
brush to dust powder over a
surface is still the most effec
tive method for developing
prints on hard surfaces.
However, there are many
more options today than there
were 100 years ago.
Powders come in all colors,
including "red-wop," which flu
oresces when illuminated with
a blacklight. A wand is some
times used for dusting with
magnetic powder, which is not
as messy as regular powder.
"Only 10 minutes of training

are required to become profi
cient," Herran said. "It's rela
tively idiot-proof." Not that
police are idiots, he added.
Ordinary superglue has also
been found to be effective in
"frosting" prints, which can
then be dusted further before
being illuminated by laser
light.
Prints as old as nine years
have been developed on paper
by using ninhydrin, a gaseous
organic compound that com
bines with the proteins and
urea on surfaces to produce
purple prints. To search for
prints on valuable documents,
Herran added, they can be made
temporarily visible by blowing
iodine fumes over them.
Once developed, fingerprints
are either photographed or
"lifted" through use of tape.
Herran said that the prints are
then sent to San Jose, where an

automatic fingerprint identifi
cation system (AFIS) searches
for a match against records of
everyone arrested in Santa
Clara county.

For more serious crimes, Cal
ifornia maintains a statewide
system.
National fingerprint records
are kept in a six story high

building in FBI headquarters in
Washington, D.C.

Much about fingerprints
remains to be learned. The pro

well as their evolutionary pur
pose, remains a mystery. In
addition, new developing tech
niques are continuously being
developed.
In 1990 George Saunders of
Los Alamos patented a tech
nique called the "Universal
Process." Saunders discovered
that by immersing almost any
surface in a colloidal gold solu
tion, gold particles would bind
to the proteins in the latent
print.
By then washing the surface
in a reagent solution of ferric
nitrate and silver nitrate, prints
could be made visible as silver
particles precipitated around
the gold.
The process is able to devel
op prints on newspaper, Xerox
paper, plastic, saran wrap,
aluminum foil, a wooden pen
cil, and even a piece of apple
skin.

All fingerprints can be divided into nine basic classes. Arches and
loops are very common, while only two out of five people have whorls.

All fingerprints can be divided into nine basic classes. Arches and
loops are very common, while only two out of five people have whorls.
One year after Stanford Uni
versity enrolled its first stu
dents, a woman named Rojas
murdered her two sons in La
Plata, Argentina.
In light of the tens of mil
lions of murders committed by
humanity since then, her small
sin might have been quickly for
gotten — had she not cut her
self.
Juan Vucetich, a local police
officer, matched a bloody fin
gerprint on the doorpost with
samples taken from Rojas. She
confessed, and thereby became
the first criminal convicted on
the basis of fingerprint evi
dence.
A century later, the art of
finding, developing and match
ing fingerprints has become
synonymous with criminal
investigation.
From Agatha Christie to
James Bond, crime fiction writ
ers have forever etched into the
public imagination the image of
a dour-faced detective dusting a
gun for prints.
Having just celebrated Stan
ford's centennial, it seems fit

progress of 100 years of finger
printing technology.
Whenever a finger touches
an object, a tiny amount of per
spiration is left behind on its

surface. Most of this "latent
print" is water, but 1.5 percent
of it contains solids like salt,
urea, lipids, and proteins. It is
the presence of these com
pounds that make the recording
of fingerprints possible.
Brad Herran, who is in
charge of preserving property
and evidence in the Palo Alto
Police Department, said using a
brush to dust powder over a
surface is still the most effec
tive method for developing
prints on hard surfaces.
However, there are many
more options today than there
were 100 years ago.
Powders come in all colors,
including "red-wop," which flu
oresces when illuminated with
a blacklight. A wand is some
times used for dusting with
magnetic powder, which is not
as messy as regular powder.
"Only 10 minutes of training

are required to become profi
cient," Herran said. "It's rela
tively idiot-proof." Not that
police are idiots, he added.
Ordinary superglue has also
been found to be effective in
"frosting" prints, which can
then be dusted further before
being illuminated by laser
light.
Prints as old as nine years
have been developed on paper
by using ninhydrin, a gaseous
organic compound that com
bines with the proteins and
urea on surfaces to produce
purple prints. To search for
prints on valuable documents,
Herran added, they can be made
temporarily visible by blowing
iodine fumes over them.
Once developed, fingerprints
are either photographed or
"lifted" through use of tape.
Herran said that the prints are
then sent to San Jose, where an

automatic fingerprint identifi
cation system (AFIS) searches
for a match against records of
everyone arrested in Santa
Clara county.

For more serious crimes, Cal
ifornia maintains a statewide
system.
National fingerprint records
are kept in a six story high

building in FBI headquarters in
Washington, D.C.

Much about fingerprints
remains to be learned. The pro
cess behind their formation, as
well as their evolutionary pur
pose, remains a mystery. In
addition, new developing tech
niques are continuously being
developed.
In 1990 George Saunders of
Los Alamos patented a tech
nique called the "Universal
Process." Saunders discovered
that by immersing almost any
surface in a colloidal gold solu
tion, gold particles would bind
to the proteins in the latent
print.
By then washing the surface
in a reagent solution of ferric
nitrate and silver nitrate, prints
could be made visible as silver
particles precipitated around
the gold.
The process is able to devel
op prints on newspaper, Xerox
paper, plastic, saran wrap,
aluminum foil, a wooden pen
cil, and even a piece of apple
skin.
