# Professor has bone to pick with geneticists
## Skeleton shape and strength comes from environment, he argues 
### Sanjai Rao 
Although it is widely believed that genet
ics determines skeletal size, shape and struc
ture, Mechanical Engineering Prof. Dennis
Garter challenges this notion.
s Carter claims that environmental factors
also play a crucial role in the growth and
development of an animal's skeleton. He has
even developed mathematical algorithms to
predict how a bone develops in response to
these external factors.
"A lot of the architectural features that we
attribute to the genome are in fact just creat
ed by natural physical activity," he said. This
realization "impacts how we view changes in
both the infant and adult skeletons."
Carter's work provides important theo
retical predictions on the effects of astro
nauts' long-term exposure to zero gravity.
These effects will prove useful when design
ing future moon and Mars missions.
His theory has evolved through a six-year
research program, in which he concluded
,that bones followed a set of instructions — a
;rulebook, so to speak — during their con
struction.
• Carter and his team of students have
Ibeen able to assemble mathematical algo
rithms which describe how the skeleton
in response to how much stress is
;placed on each part of it.

Incorporated into a computer program,
these algorithms can then predict the effects
of different environments on skeletal devel
opment.
"We have found that bone spontaneously
remodels according to stress changes, and
that it basically follows the same rules as a
developing skeleton," said Carter.
"It turns out that the growth of bones and
skeletal structure are regulated by mechani
cal stresses which self-design the skeleton for
us. The bones take on a shape and density
that is optimized to carry the exposed load."
If accurate, his findings indicate that peo
ple who volunteer for colonization missions,
as well as their children, may suffer grave
repercussions upon returning to Earth.
Since the gravitational stresses on bone
in space are far less than that of earth,
Carter predicts adult bones would lose much
of their density. As a result, people who
choose to live a significant part of their lives
in space would find themselves confined to
wheelchairs on Earth.
In addition, because human skeletal con
struction begins in the womb, children's
bones could fail to develop at all.
In the fetal skeleton, the majority of the
bone mass actually consists of cartilage.
Over time, it ossifies into bone in response to
the stresses placed on it. With no such
stresses present, bone may fail to form.

Carter's research also points to new
methods of treating present-day medical
problems such as osteoporosis, a disease
which causes loss of bone density.
"We are looking at ways to evaluate the
effects of exercise in osteoporotic individu
als. Our theories have led to new insights on
tissue regeneration," he said. "We also hope
to be able to better heal fractures by manip
ulating the patient's mechanical environ
ment."
While his algorithms were used to
model the skeletons of future humans,
Carter has also used them to analyze the
bone structure of ancient winged reptiles
called pterosaurs.
He concluded that these animals spent
most of their time actively flying, not just
gliding, like some paleontologists had
thought.
His discoveries are the culmination of an
effort he began as a graduate student at
Stanford in the early 19705. Since then he
has earned both a Master's degree and a
Ph.D. in biomedical engineering, and has
taught as an assistant professor at Harvard
Medical School.
Carter's team consisted of several gradu
ate students and one Ph.D. candidate, Gary
Beaupre. Their work is funded by the Reha
bilitation Research and Development Center
of the Veteran's Affairs Medical Center.
