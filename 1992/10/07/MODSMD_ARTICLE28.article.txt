# Heartening news about cholesterol awareness
## But people still need to change their behavior, doctors caution

I If you eat oat bran instead of
Ipizza for breakfast nowadays,
jyou are not alone.
Nationwide efforts that began
•in the mid-1980s to increase pub
lic awareness about cholesterol
Jhave been successful, according
{to a recent study led by Dr. Erica
•Frank, from the Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine.
Frank, along with other Stan
ford researchers, analyzed data
collected from over 4,000 adults.
She concluded that height
ened awareness of cholesterol
beginning in thel9Bos increased
knowledge about cholesterol,
encouraged healthier diets, and
led to lower cholesterol levels in
the subjects surveyed.
In addition, the mass media
started to focus its attention on
health.
New approaches to marketing
food products with terms such as
"low fat," "high fiber" or "low
cholesterol" also contributed to
raising consciousness about
cholesterol, she reported.
However, a separate study
released by the State University
Jof New York at Stony Brook last
|month reported that more edu
cation about cholesterol is still
[needed.
For example, most adults had
-a very poor understanding about
the difference between choles
terol and fat, and had trouble
judging the fat content of various
foods.

Suggestions for students
At Stanford, there are many
resources available for those who
want to increase their knowledge
about cholesterol.
The starting point, of course, is
to determine whether or not your
cholesterol level is high.
One way to check this is to
donate blood at the Stanford Blood
Bank. In return for your contribu
tion, the blood bank performs free
cholesterol screening as well as
confidential HIV testing.
However, if you'd rather not
give blood, then the Cowell Stu
dent Health Center also provides
free cholesterol screening for reg
istered students.
Once you know your choles
terol level, the next step is to
interpret what it means. Certain
amounts of cholesterol are needed
for the body to function properly.
For example, some cholesterol is
necessary for building cell walls
and making hormones.
The body makes all the choles
terol it needs, however. When
additional cholesterol enters the
blood from foods that we eat,
problems arise.
The extra cholesterol begins
sticking to the walls of coronary
arteries in the heart. Over time,
this buildup can impede the flow
of blood to the heart, preventing
it from receiving the nutrients
and oxygen it needs to pump
blood around the body. This leads
to coronary heart disease and
often to fatal heart attacks.
According to the National

Institutes of Health, for those
between ages 20-29 a cholesterol
level under 180 mg/dL is most
desirable; between 200-220 mg/dL
is regarded as "moderate risk" for
heart disease. Levels above 220
mg/dL are considered "high risk."
At Cowell, for patients whose
levels are above 200, a further
test can be done to analyze the
two types of lipoproteins in
cholesterol: HDL and LDL. HDL,
also known as high density
lipoproteins, are commonly
referred to as the "good" type of
cholesterol. LDL, or low-density
lipoprotein is often considered the
"bad" type of cholesterol.
One of the best ways to
increase the good and decrease
the bad types of cholesterol is
through exercise, Cowell Staff
Physician John Dorman said.
However, not just any exercise
will do. Pumping iron doesn't
count. For optimum health bene
fits as well as weight reduction,

one should participate in some
type of aerobic (i.e. sweat induc
ing) activity three or four times a
week, for about 30 minutes.
In addition to exercise, choles
terol levels are also effected by
diet and behaviors like smoking.
Key food items to avoid at the din
ner table are saturated fats like
butter, cream and shortening.
Red meat and eggs have long been
considered taboo for the choles
terol conscious, and — of course
— greasy foods like french fries,
fried chicken and yes, even pizza
should definitely be consumed in
moderation.
Bran lovers will be pleased to
know that rumorsa bout oat bran
reducing cholesterol are, in fact,
true. The Journal of American
Medical Association reported in
June that "one large bowl of oat
bran cereal a day can result in a
modest reduction in a person's
blood cholesterol level."
Of final note to those con
cerned about cholesterol is the
role of genetics in determining
the risk of heart disease. Short
from choosing different parents,
people with genetic predisposi
tions toward heart disease must
make sure to minimize other risk
factors. In other words, Dorman
said, starting smoking is not a
good idea for someone with a high
genetic risk.

terol screening contact the Cowell

or the Stanford Medical School
Blood Center, 723-7831.

for the body to function properly.
For example, some cholesterol is
necessary for building cell walls
and making hormones.
The body makes all the choles
terol it needs, however. When
additional cholesterol enters the
blood from foods that we eat,
problems arise.
The extra cholesterol begins
sticking to the walls of coronary
arteries in the heart. Over time,
this buildup can impede the flow
of blood to the heart, preventing
it from receiving the nutrients
and oxygen it needs to pump
blood around the body. This leads
to coronary heart disease and
often to fatal heart attacks.
According to the National

Institutes of Health, for those
between ages 20-29 a cholesterol
level under 180 mg/dL is most
desirable; between 200-220 mg/dL
is regarded as "moderate risk" for
heart disease. Levels above 220
mg/dL are considered "high risk."
At Cowell, for patients whose
levels are above 200, a further
test can be done to analyze the
two types of lipoproteins in
cholesterol: HDL and LDL. HDL,
also known as high density
lipoproteins, are commonly
referred to as the "good" type of
cholesterol. LDL, or low-density
lipoprotein is often considered the
"bad" type of cholesterol.
One of the best ways to
increase the good and decrease
the bad types of cholesterol is
through exercise, Cowell Staff
Physician John Dorman said.
However, not just any exercise
will do. Pumping iron doesn't
count. For optimum health bene
fits as well as weight reduction,

one should participate in some
type of aerobic (i.e. sweat induc
ing) activity three or four times a
week, for about 30 minutes.
In addition to exercise, choles
terol levels are also effected by
diet and behaviors like smoking.
Key food items to avoid at the din
ner table are saturated fats like
butter, cream and shortening.
Red meat and eggs have long been
considered taboo for the choles
terol conscious, and — of course
— greasy foods like french fries,
fried chicken and yes, even pizza
should definitely be consumed in
moderation.
Bran lovers will be pleased to
know that rumorsa bout oat bran
reducing cholesterol are, in fact,
true. The Journal of American
Medical Association reported in
June that "one large bowl of oat
bran cereal a day can result in a
modest reduction in a person's
blood cholesterol level."
Of final note to those con
cerned about cholesterol is the
role of genetics in determining
the risk of heart disease. Short
from choosing different parents,
people with genetic predisposi
tions toward heart disease must
make sure to minimize other risk
factors. In other words, Dorman
said, starting smoking is not a
good idea for someone with a high
genetic risk.

I If you eat oat bran instead of

jyou are not alone.
Nationwide efforts that began
•in the mid-1980s to increase pub
lic awareness about cholesterol
Jhave been successful, according
{to a recent study led by Dr. Erica
•Frank, from the Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine.
Frank, along with other Stan
ford researchers, analyzed data
collected from over 4,000 adults.
She concluded that height
ened awareness of cholesterol
beginning in thel9Bos increased
knowledge about cholesterol,
encouraged healthier diets, and
led to lower cholesterol levels in
the subjects surveyed.
In addition, the mass media
started to focus its attention on
health.
New approaches to marketing
food products with terms such as
"low fat," "high fiber" or "low
cholesterol" also contributed to
raising consciousness about
cholesterol, she reported.
However, a separate study
released by the State University
Jof New York at Stony Brook last
|month reported that more edu
cation about cholesterol is still
[needed.
For example, most adults had
-a very poor understanding about
the difference between choles
terol and fat, and had trouble
judging the fat content of various
foods.

Suggestions for students
At Stanford, there are many
resources available for those who
want to increase their knowledge
about cholesterol.
The starting point, of course, is
to determine whether or not your
cholesterol level is high.
One way to check this is to
donate blood at the Stanford Blood
Bank. In return for your contribu
tion, the blood bank performs free
cholesterol screening as well as
confidential HIV testing.
However, if you'd rather not
give blood, then the Cowell Stu
dent Health Center also provides
free cholesterol screening for reg
istered students.

terol level, the next step is to
