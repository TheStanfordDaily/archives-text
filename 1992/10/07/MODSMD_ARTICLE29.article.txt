Q:How do hurricanes
begin? Please give a
detailed scientific explanation,
not a fuzzy rehash of what the
weatherpeople say on TV.
— Dying to know in Durand
A: Gee whiz, Dying, I must
say that I'm a trifle offend
ed at the mere suggestion that
my column could be a "fuzzy
rehash" of anything. I'm in a
forgiving mood, however, so I'll
answer your question just the
same.
Hurricanes form over large
bodies of warm water near the
equator, where the air is humid
and convection is carrying heated
air from the ocean surface to
higher layers of the atmosphere.
This flow creates a region of low
pressure, termed a "tropical
depression," which pulls air from
the surrounding areas toward
the center of the depression.
The centripetal winds don't
blow in straight lines, however.
Due to the rotation of the Earth
about its axis, and the fact that
the atmosphere isn't nailed
down to the planetary surface,
movements of air masses are
subject to the so-called "Corio
lis force."
The Coriolis force is not a
bona fide force of nature, but
rather a formal statement of
the observation that when an
object (like air) moves through
a rotating reference frame (like
the surface of the earth) in a
straight line as seen from a
fixed frame, its motion appears
to be curved to an observer in
the rotating frame.
Under the influence of the
Coriolis force, the centripetal
winds around a tropical depres
sion acquire angular momen
tum. In the Northern Hemi
sphere, this angular momentum
results in a counterclockwise
rotation of the wind pattern.
As the depression begins to
spin, the centripetal wind flow
increases — and with it, the
corresponding input of humid
air. From the center of the
depression, the vapor-laden
air rises, and as it rises, it
cools. Since cold air can hold
less water vapor than warm
air, the large-scale condensa
tion of moisture (read: "rain")
begins.
It takes heat energy to boil
water, right? So, running the
reaction in the reverse direction
— i.e., turning vapor into liquid
droplets — actually liberates
energy into the brewing storm.
This release of the latent heat
of condensation is the main
source of energy for tropical
storms. Here's why:
As the energy of condensing
vapor enters the storm com
plex, the winds grow stronger
and the rate of intake and uplift
of warm, humid air from out
side the system increases. More
moist air cycling through the

eye means more condensation,
which means a greater release
of energy per unit time, which
means stronger winds, which
means more intake of moist air.
— I think you get the idea.
Vicious cycle begets vicious
cyclone, and Miami residents
start boarding up the windows
to protect themselves from
winds that can reach 150 m.p.h.
After the process of evolu
tion from tranquil tropical
depression to raging, violent
hurricane is complete (it takes
about a week), the storm sys
tem begins to move in a west
ward and poleward direction.
As the hurricane leaves the
equator, the Coriolis force
increases, conferring additional
angular momentum to the
winds circling the eye. This
Coriolis contribution, coupled
with the ongoing process of
moisture condensation and
energy release, feeds the storm
as it migrates. Although the
rate of travel is slow (15 m.p.h.)
at first, it can reach 50 m.p.h.
— faster than most North
Miami retirees drive — by the
time the storm hits a continent.
On the open sea, a hurricane
can travel for several weeks
before dissipating. Two factors
that can facilitate a hurricane's
demise are rapid influxes of dry
air, which rob the storm's
engine of its vaporous fuel, and
cool ocean surface tempera
tures, which slow the convec
tional flow that drives further
uptake of air.
Once the storm hits land,
however, it will dissipate
extremely quickly. Not only is
there much less evaporable
water on dry land (duh), the
hurricane's winds lose much
more energy to friction against
mountains than they did
against smooth water.
Of course, this is cold com
fort to those who dwell on the
East Coast, who will be the
recipients of the huge amount
of mechanical energy dumped
onto the continent in the form
of wind and rain.
But then again, I've always
said that Nebraska is a nice
place to raise kids.
