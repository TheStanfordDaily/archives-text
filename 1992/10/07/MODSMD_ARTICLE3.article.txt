# Casper vows to keep personality public, politics private
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
For Gerhard Casper, a private person
now the center of public attention as Stan
ford's president, even a visit to the local
supermarket can be a trying experience.
"I cannot go to Safeway without people
inspecting my shopping cart to see
whether I buy politically correct prod
ucts," he said yesterday in a visit to Kim
ball Hall.
And when he attended the San Fran
cisco opera with Political Science Prof.
Condoleezza Rice last month, he was sur
prised to find a photo of them published in
a local newspaper the next day."I now

have made it into the gossip columns," he
said.
But while Casper has resigned himself
to life as a public personality, he vows to
stay private in at least one respect: He'll
keep his political views to himself.
Elaborating on a point he made briefly
in his inaugural addresß, Casper told
about 100 students in a visit to the dormi
tory yesterday that neither universities,
nor the people who represent them,
should take public positions on political is
sues.
"Nobody here who is in an administra
tive position has been chosen to represent
anybody politically," he said. "If I take a
political position and do it in my role as

president of Stanford University, I am
abusing my role."
While he encouraged students to "get
involved" individually in "implementing
the values you want to pursue," he said he
will not personally "take sides on a partic
ular issue."
"I will not tell you, 'You should get in
volved in this cause or that cause,' " he
said. "I will not say, 'Fight for the spotted
owl or against the spotted owl.' "
Casper's remarks take on special
meaning at Stanford, which has been ac
cused of supporting a liberal agenda too
vocally. His remarks may signal a new,
lower-profile political role for the Univer
sity.

For example, Casper said in a brief in
terview after his talk that he has "real
reservations" about last spring's adver
tisement condemning the Rodney King
verdict, signed by 700 faculty and staff,
that appeared in The New York Times.
While Casper spent much of his 90-
minute visit to Kimball taking questions
from students on topics from indirect
costs to Food Service, he took special care
to outline in a 15-minute introductory
section his views on a university's role in
politics.
Casper said his opinions were shaped
by his experiences growing up in Ger
many, and as a faculty member at UC-
Berkeley and the University of Chicago.

When the Nazis took over the universities
in Germany during the 19305, he said,
they "in no time destroyed the universi
ties by turning them into political vehicles
for the regime."
Similarly, agitation over the Vietnam
War at Berkeley — when activists urged
the university to make a public statement
against the war — and sit-ins at the Uni
versity of Chicago during the 1970s en
dangered the university's neutral, inde
pendent position, Casper said.
He hopes to avoid those dilemmas at
Stanford, staying clear of making public
statements on political issues. "The
minute I would take a position —
and indeed, your professors take a
position —. . . they are ending the
discussion" by silencing those
who disagree, Casper said.
He added that he was not cho
sen as president to use Stanford
"as a vehicle for propagating my
personal political view."
As an example of a situation
that would make him uncomfort
able, Casper said that if he were
approached by a group buying an
advertisement in The New York
Times to support Democratic
presidential nominee Bill Clinton,
he would not sign his name to it.
"I would not possibly do such a
thing, nor would I do it for Clin
ton's opponent," Casper said.
Indeed, even if the group told

him, 44 'But Gerhard, we want
you to sign only as a citizen, as a
voter, not as president of Stan
ford,' " he said, "I would not do
that, either."
Casper's example was reminis
cent of a situation last May when
former University President Don
ald Kennedy signed "as an indi
vidual" an American Civil Liber
ties Union petition. The petition
urged university administrators
to examine whether ROTC's pres
ence on campuses is consistent
with their anti-discrimination
policies.
The U.S. military, of which the
ROTC program is a part, bans
gays and lesbians from service.
But Casper said Kennedy's
action falls under an exception to
his rule — he believes it is accept
able to take positions on issues
directly related to the Universi
ty's interests.
For example, he said that as

dean of the University of Chica
go's law school, he did take posi
tions on political issues that
directly affected "legal educa
tion," such as Reagan administra
tion proposals on student aid.
"Since the military's policy
against gays involves the recruit
ment of our own students, it is
entirely appropriate for the presi
dent to take a position on that,"
Casper said in the interview after
his talk.
But the advertisement con
demning the Rodney King verdict
is much more questionable,
Casper said.
Although the faculty "signed it
in their private capacity," he said,
"I must confess that when only
Stanford faculty get together qua
faculty and take out an ad, I have
real reservations about that."
Casper said in an interview
with the Los Angeles Times last
May that the Board of Trustees

wants him to boost morale at
Stanford and focus attention
back "on the central purposes of
the university, that is, teaching
and research, not being diverted
by all these political controver
sies."
But Casper said in yester
day's interview that those com
ments were taken out of con
text. He added that his views on
a university's role in politics
have not been influenced by the
trustees.
"This has nothing to do with
whatever the views of the trustees
might be, but reflects longstand
ing views of my own," he said.
If the trustees had wanted him
to keep a low profile on political
issues, "they certainly didn't say
it to me," Casper said. "Indeed, I
never talked to the trustees qua
trustees. The trustees made the
decision to elect me without hav
ing seen me."
For Gerhard Casper, a private person

supermarket can be a trying experience.
"I cannot go to Safeway without people
inspecting my shopping cart to see
whether I buy politically correct prod
ucts," he said yesterday in a visit to Kim
ball Hall.
And when he attended the San Fran
cisco opera with Political Science Prof.
Condoleezza Rice last month, he was sur
prised to find a photo of them published in
a local newspaper the next day."I now

have made it into the gossip columns," he
said.
But while Casper has resigned himself
to life as a public personality, he vows to
stay private in at least one respect: He'll
keep his political views to himself.
Elaborating on a point he made briefly
in his inaugural addresß, Casper told
about 100 students in a visit to the dormi
tory yesterday that neither universities,
nor the people who represent them,
should take public positions on political is
sues.
"Nobody here who is in an administra
tive position has been chosen to represent
anybody politically," he said. "If I take a
political position and do it in my role as

president of Stanford University, I am
abusing my role."
While he encouraged students to "get
involved" individually in "implementing
the values you want to pursue," he said he
will not personally "take sides on a partic
ular issue."
"I will not tell you, 'You should get in
volved in this cause or that cause,' " he
said. "I will not say, 'Fight for the spotted
owl or against the spotted owl.' "
Casper's remarks take on special
meaning at Stanford, which has been ac
cused of supporting a liberal agenda too
vocally. His remarks may signal a new,
lower-profile political role for the Univer
sity.

For example, Casper said in a brief in
terview after his talk that he has "real
reservations" about last spring's adver
tisement condemning the Rodney King
verdict, signed by 700 faculty and staff,
that appeared in The New York Times.
While Casper spent much of his 90-
minute visit to Kimball taking questions
from students on topics from indirect
costs to Food Service, he took special care
to outline in a 15-minute introductory
section his views on a university's role in
politics.
Casper said his opinions were shaped
by his experiences growing up in Ger
many, and as a faculty member at UC-
Berkeley and the University of Chicago.

When the Nazis took over the universities
in Germany during the 19305, he said,
they "in no time destroyed the universi
ties by turning them into political vehicles
for the regime."
Similarly, agitation over the Vietnam
War at Berkeley — when activists urged
the university to make a public statement
against the war — and sit-ins at the Uni
versity of Chicago during the 1970s en
dangered the university's neutral, inde
pendent position, Casper said.
He hopes to avoid those dilemmas at
Stanford, staying clear of making public
statements on political issues. "The
minute I would take a position —
and indeed, your professors take a
position —. . . they are ending the
discussion" by silencing those
who disagree, Casper said.
He added that he was not cho
sen as president to use Stanford
"as a vehicle for propagating my
personal political view."
As an example of a situation
that would make him uncomfort
able, Casper said that if he were
approached by a group buying an
advertisement in The New York
Times to support Democratic
presidential nominee Bill Clinton,
he would not sign his name to it.
"I would not possibly do such a
thing, nor would I do it for Clin
ton's opponent," Casper said.
Indeed, even if the group told

him, 44 'But Gerhard, we want
you to sign only as a citizen, as a
voter, not as president of Stan
ford,' " he said, "I would not do
that, either."
Casper's example was reminis
cent of a situation last May when
former University President Don
ald Kennedy signed "as an indi
vidual" an American Civil Liber
ties Union petition. The petition
urged university administrators
to examine whether ROTC's pres
ence on campuses is consistent
with their anti-discrimination
policies.
The U.S. military, of which the
ROTC program is a part, bans
gays and lesbians from service.
But Casper said Kennedy's
action falls under an exception to
his rule — he believes it is accept
able to take positions on issues
directly related to the Universi
ty's interests.
For example, he said that as

dean of the University of Chica
go's law school, he did take posi
tions on political issues that
directly affected "legal educa
tion," such as Reagan administra
tion proposals on student aid.
"Since the military's policy
against gays involves the recruit
ment of our own students, it is
entirely appropriate for the presi
dent to take a position on that,"
Casper said in the interview after
his talk.
But the advertisement con
demning the Rodney King verdict
is much more questionable,
Casper said.
Although the faculty "signed it
in their private capacity," he said,
"I must confess that when only
Stanford faculty get together qua
faculty and take out an ad, I have
real reservations about that."
Casper said in an interview
with the Los Angeles Times last
May that the Board of Trustees

wants him to boost morale at
Stanford and focus attention
back "on the central purposes of
the university, that is, teaching
and research, not being diverted
by all these political controver
sies."
But Casper said in yester
day's interview that those com
ments were taken out of con
text. He added that his views on
a university's role in politics
have not been influenced by the
trustees.
"This has nothing to do with
whatever the views of the trustees
might be, but reflects longstand
ing views of my own," he said.
If the trustees had wanted him
to keep a low profile on political
issues, "they certainly didn't say
it to me," Casper said. "Indeed, I
never talked to the trustees qua
trustees. The trustees made the
decision to elect me without hav
ing seen me."
For Gerhard Casper, a private person
now the center of public attention as Stan
ford's president, even a visit to the local
supermarket can be a trying experience.
