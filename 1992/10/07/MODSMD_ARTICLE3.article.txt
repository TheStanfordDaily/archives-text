# Casper vows to keep personality public, politics private
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
For Gerhard Casper, a private person
now the center of public attention as Stan
ford's president, even a visit to the local
supermarket can be a trying experience.
"I cannot go to Safeway without people
inspecting my shopping cart to see
whether I buy politically correct prod
ucts," he said yesterday in a visit to Kim
ball Hall.
And when he attended the San Fran
cisco opera with Political Science Prof.
Condoleezza Rice last month, he was sur
prised to find a photo of them published in
a local newspaper the next day."I now

have made it into the gossip columns," he
said.
But while Casper has resigned himself
to life as a public personality, he vows to
stay private in at least one respect: He'll
keep his political views to himself.
Elaborating on a point he made briefly
in his inaugural addresß, Casper told
about 100 students in a visit to the dormi
tory yesterday that neither universities,
nor the people who represent them,
should take public positions on political is
sues.
"Nobody here who is in an administra
tive position has been chosen to represent
anybody politically," he said. "If I take a
political position and do it in my role as

president of Stanford University, I am
abusing my role."
While he encouraged students to "get
involved" individually in "implementing
the values you want to pursue," he said he
will not personally "take sides on a partic
ular issue."
"I will not tell you, 'You should get in
volved in this cause or that cause,' " he
said. "I will not say, 'Fight for the spotted
owl or against the spotted owl.' "
Casper's remarks take on special
meaning at Stanford, which has been ac
cused of supporting a liberal agenda too
vocally. His remarks may signal a new,
lower-profile political role for the Univer
sity.

For example, Casper said in a brief in
terview after his talk that he has "real
reservations" about last spring's adver
tisement condemning the Rodney King
verdict, signed by 700 faculty and staff,
that appeared in The New York Times.
While Casper spent much of his 90-
minute visit to Kimball taking questions
from students on topics from indirect
costs to Food Service, he took special care
to outline in a 15-minute introductory
section his views on a university's role in
politics.
Casper said his opinions were shaped
by his experiences growing up in Ger
many, and as a faculty member at UC-
Berkeley and the University of Chicago.

When the Nazis took over the universities
in Germany during the 19305, he said,
they "in no time destroyed the universi
ties by turning them into political vehicles
for the regime."
Similarly, agitation over the Vietnam
War at Berkeley — when activists urged
the university to make a public statement
against the war — and sit-ins at the Uni
versity of Chicago during the 1970s en
dangered the university's neutral, inde
pendent position, Casper said.
He hopes to avoid those dilemmas at
Stanford, staying clear of making public
statements on political issues. "The
