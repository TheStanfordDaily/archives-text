## Goal scoring- all in a Dey's work for Stanford freshman forward Dena Dey lights up scoreboard 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Soccer forward Dena Dey
doesn't like to talk about scoring
goals. Although she's tied with
Sarah Rafanelli for the team lead
in that department, Dey down
plays the nine goals and five
assists she's tallied so far this sea
son.
"Everyone can score but I've
just had a lot of opportunities,"
said the freshman from Mercer
Island, a suburb of Seattle. "I just
wanted to contribute. [Leading
the team in scoringl is a big sur
prise. I didn't expect that at all."

I'd like to contribute
as much as possible,
whether it means
playing a little more
each year or working
hard and improving
while still having the
same role.
— Dena Dey

Dey emerged as the starter at
left forward after senior Jen
Potok had to sit out the early part
of the season with a broken nose.
Both Dey and coach Berhane
Andeberhan credit Dey's size and
speed for her ability to quickly
adjust to the starting role in her
first season on the squad.
"She's a great athlete both
physically and mentally," Ande
berhan said. "She's a strong per
son as well as an athlete and
that's why she's been so produc
tive for us so far."
Her athletic ability is definitely
not in question. She was named
USA Today's Washington State
Player of the Year in 1991 for her
exploits in soccer, track and bas
ketball.
Dey, a high school All-American
and four-time state champion in
track, also plans to compete for the
Cardinal during the spring track
season. She runs the 800 meters, a
race seemingly at odds with the
sprinting nature of soccer.
"Soccer's kind of unique in
that there's so much sprinting
and stopping, but it takes a lot of
endurance, too," she said.
Andeberhan said that while
her track training helps her
adjust to the heavy fitness load
required of a collegiate athlete, it
sometimes hinders her progress

in soccer.
"She's used to long strides, so
she's fine on the run, but it's dif
ferent in tight spaces," Andeber
han said.
In addition to ball-handling
skills, Dey wants to improve her
tactical knowledge — reading
plays and knowing how to
defend certain situations. She
said she tends to rely on speed
too often.
"It's hard making the transi
tion (to college soccer) because I
can't get away with as much," she
said.
"In high school and youth
leagues, attackers are used to get
ting away with not playing
defense, so it's not a habit with
her yet," said Andeberhan who
pointed to last week's Central
Florida contest as an example of
her progress in that arena.
"What most people remember
about the Central Florida game is
that she scored two goals, but she
played excellent defense," he said
of Dey's performance in Stan
ford's 3-1 victory. "She was up and
down the field foiling any counter
attack they tried on her side."
Something Dey liked about
that match was the rough play.
"I'm not really a physical player
but I felt the experience was good
for us," she said. "Personally, I
could use a little toughening up."
Despite the self-claimed soft
ness, Dey has burned just about
every team she's faced. She has
scored either a goal or an assist in
all but one of the Cardinal's nine
games.
Part of her success rests on
her foot. More specifically, her
left foot. Like a left-handed hitter
in volleyball, a left-footed soccer
player is a rare commodity that
tends to give defenses problems.
"Most teams are right-sided on
offense and defense," Andeber
han said. "The defender's posi
tion on the attacker is different.
You mirror the diagonal you
would use against a right-footed
player."
Thus, players have a tendency
to give Dey too much of a cushion
on her dominant side and this
gives her a better chance of get
ting off a pass.
Being left-footed also gives her
another advantage. Because she
plays left forward she can hit a
crossing shot without breaking
her stride, something a right
footed person couldn't do.
However, her left-side domi
nance is not the only characteris
tic which distinguishes Dey on
the soccer field. Dey is a minority
in a sport that isn't known for a
high degree of racial diversity in
the U.S.

"Maybe it's because of where I
come from, but I haven't felt any
tension because of it," she said.
"People may say, 'Go mark the
black girl' or, 'Who scored? The
black girl.' But that's not a big
deal."
Dey would rather focus on how
she fits into the Cardinal scheme,
instead of what sets her apart

from the other players.
"I'd like to contribute as much
as possible, whether it means
playing a little more each year or
working hard and improving
while still having the same role,"
she said.
And if the 1992 season contin
ues as it has, that role will be
lighting up the scoreboard.
