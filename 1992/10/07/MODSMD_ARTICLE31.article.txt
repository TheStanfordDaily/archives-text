# The 						Magic's back
## 
### 
The sports world in gener
al, and the Los Angeles
Lakers in particular, got
a big lift last week with the
announcement that a bit of
Magic would once again be pre
sent.
The decision of Earvin
"Magic" Johnson to resume his
career in professional basketball
was, despite pundits to the con
trary, the right one. Magic, one
of the greatest players who ever
played the game, and perhaps
the best point guard ever, real
ized in his year-long layoff that
the most fundamental part of
his life was playing basketball.
Last year's season was cast
in a dark shadow after Magic's
Nov. 3 announcement that he
was HIV-positive. Suddenly,
there was something missing in
the NBA — the Magic smile, the
no-look pass, the baby sky hook
— that could not be replaced.
Magic's mantle of basketball
leadership and role as unofficial
international spokesman for
the game was not properly
transferred. Last week, he
determined that the game need
ed him, but more importantly,
that he needed the game.
Rather than exit the game
with a great, but seemingly
blemished record, it is only
appropriate that he return, so
he can bow out properly in the
way that has become his cus
tom: as a champion. Magic
demonstrated both in his MVP
All-Star Game performance
and with the Dream Team at
the Summer Olympics in
Barcelona that he is still a
member of basketball's elite, a
player who can take over a
game merely by his presence on
the court. There is no reason
why he should not come back.
By returning to the game
which has so enveloped his life,
Magic is making a powerful
statement about his condition.
Magic's return will show that
people with HIV are not with
out hope. Sure, he will limit
strain on his body by not play
ing back-to-back games, but if
nothing else, his participation
shows that he is a fighter.
In his last full season with
the Lakers, his team came up a
bit short, losing in the NBA
Finals to the Chicago Bulls.
Last year, his early departure
turned a team that was good
enough to win the Western
Conference into a team that
barely made the playoffs. With
out him this year, the Lakers
would be in the same boat; with
him, they could — and will —
win it all once again.
Magic did not come out of
retirement for purely selfish
reasons. He certainly is not
doing it for the money.
Nor is he doing it so he can
have a "farewell tour" like Dr. J

or Kareem where he can pick
up a few rocking chairs for his
living room.
Part of his motivation for
coming back is to make up for
leaving his team in such bad
shape. Magic has maintained
throughout his career that he
would always rather chalk up
an assist than score points. His
comeback might be the greatest
assist he has ever made.
The other part of the plan is
to go out a winner. He left high
school as a champion, he left
college as a champion, and he

left the Olympics as a champi
on. Five times he has led Los
Angeles to the promised land.
He wants his final game on the
floor of the Great Western
Forum to end in victory as a
champion one last time,
crowned as the best with NBA
Championship trophy number
six.
All that Magic desires is to
don the purple and gold jersey
with his famous 32 on it. The
problem is, in order to do so,
does owner Jerry Buss cover up
the plaque that hangs along
side Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry
West, and Elgin Baylor since
Magic is now "unretired?"
Buss should leave the
framed uniform as is, so that
both young and old, if ever
doubtful this season, can be
reminded that gracing the
court is a player whose jersey
will someday hang in Spring
field, Mass.
From his Midsummer
Night's Magic charity game to
benefit the United Negro Col
lege Fund to his endowment of
a scholarship at Michigan State
funding basketball clinics for
underprivileged inner-city
youth, Magic cares deeply
about others. And he cares
deeply about basketball.
In his love for the game, it
was through his efforts that
the Dream Team's roster
became a reality. Let's care
enough to support him in his
final endeavor on the hard
wood, for we have the added
luxury of not just watching a
brave individual who is a great
basketball player, but knowing
how less bright the game
shines without him.

The sports world in gener
al, and the Los Angeles
Lakers in particular, got
a big lift last week with the
announcement that a bit of
Magic would once again be pre
sent.
The decision of Earvin
"Magic" Johnson to resume his
career in professional basketball
was, despite pundits to the con
trary, the right one. Magic, one
of the greatest players who ever
played the game, and perhaps
the best point guard ever, real
ized in his year-long layoff that
the most fundamental part of
his life was playing basketball.
Last year's season was cast
in a dark shadow after Magic's
Nov. 3 announcement that he
was HIV-positive. Suddenly,
there was something missing in
the NBA — the Magic smile, the
no-look pass, the baby sky hook
— that could not be replaced.
Magic's mantle of basketball
leadership and role as unofficial
international spokesman for
the game was not properly
transferred. Last week, he
determined that the game need
ed him, but more importantly,
that he needed the game.
Rather than exit the game
with a great, but seemingly
blemished record, it is only
appropriate that he return, so
he can bow out properly in the
way that has become his cus
tom: as a champion. Magic
demonstrated both in his MVP
All-Star Game performance
and with the Dream Team at
the Summer Olympics in
Barcelona that he is still a
member of basketball's elite, a
player who can take over a
game merely by his presence on
the court. There is no reason
why he should not come back.
By returning to the game
which has so enveloped his life,
Magic is making a powerful
statement about his condition.
Magic's return will show that
people with HIV are not with
out hope. Sure, he will limit
strain on his body by not play
ing back-to-back games, but if
nothing else, his participation
shows that he is a fighter.
In his last full season with
the Lakers, his team came up a
bit short, losing in the NBA
Finals to the Chicago Bulls.
Last year, his early departure
turned a team that was good
enough to win the Western
Conference into a team that
barely made the playoffs. With
out him this year, the Lakers
would be in the same boat; with
him, they could — and will —
win it all once again.
Magic did not come out of
retirement for purely selfish
reasons. He certainly is not
doing it for the money.
Nor is he doing it so he can
have a "farewell tour" like Dr. J

or Kareem where he can pick
up a few rocking chairs for his
living room.
Part of his motivation for
coming back is to make up for
leaving his team in such bad
shape. Magic has maintained
throughout his career that he
would always rather chalk up
an assist than score points. His
comeback might be the greatest
assist he has ever made.
The other part of the plan is
to go out a winner. He left high
school as a champion, he left
college as a champion, and he

left the Olympics as a champi
on. Five times he has led Los
Angeles to the promised land.
He wants his final game on the
floor of the Great Western
Forum to end in victory as a
champion one last time,
crowned as the best with NBA
Championship trophy number
six.
