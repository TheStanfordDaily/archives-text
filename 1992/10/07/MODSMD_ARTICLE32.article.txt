# Stanford focuses on Pasadena, UCLA after South Bend upset
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal's march to the Rose Bowl begins
Saturday in the same stadium where they would
like it to end Jan. 1, as Stanford faces No. 19 UCLA
in Pasadena.
The two squads are coming off very opposite
weekends. Stanford (4-1, 1-0 conference), of course,
pulled off an impressive 33-16 upset at Notre Dame
and shot up seven spots to No. 11 in the polls.
UCLA (3-1, 0-1) was humiliated by underdog Ari
zona, 23-3, in the Bruin's first Pacific 10 Confer
ence game, plummeting eight spots in the national
rankings.
And with the Pac-10 championship still foremost
in their minds, the Cardinal players didn't have
much time to celebrate their landmark win.
"Saturday was a big win, but that ended Sunday.
We'd like to start this part of our Pac-10 schedule
with a win," said center Glen Cavanaugh.
UCLA's offense had a miserable night in Tuscon.
They were held to a paltry 36 yards on the ground,
and gained just 177 yards in total offense. The Bru
ins, owner of an NCAA-record 243-game scoring
streak, didn't get on the board until the game's
final minutes, when head coach Terry Donahue
decided to go for a field goal on fourth down and
goal.
"We were just dominated by Arizona's defense.
They hardly allowed us a first down, let alone a
touchdown," Donahue said.
Donahue and his team were flat-out disillusioned
by their performance against Arizona. "We had a
strong first three games, but that was against the
Western Athletic Conference and Cal State-Fuller
ton. When we stepped into Pac-10 play, we got our
brains beat out. Now we're just trying to get back
on track."
The Bruin offense, guided by freshman quarter
back Rob Walker and All-American wide receiver
Sean won't have it any easier against
the Cardinal.
Stanford boasts the country's fifth-rated
defense, allowing only 232 yards per game. The

Cardinal's hounding pass rush, led by outside
linebacker Ron George (8 sacks) and defensive
end Estevan Avila (4 sacks), has chalked up 17
sacks in five games, one more than it had all of
last season.
The rapid improvement of the Cardinal sec
ondary won't help Walker, either. Cornerbacks
Vaughn Bryant and Darrien Gordon played great
man-to-man coverage last week against Notre
Dame, contributing to Rick Mirer's pathetic 13-for
-38 passing performance. And the bone-crunching
hits free safety John Lynch threw at the Irish
should strike terror in the hearts of Bruin
receivers.
But all this shouldn't make the Cardinal com
fortable. If UCLA has any intention of staying in
the conference race, this Saturday is a must-win for
them. Playing a perennial powerhouse on their
home field is never an easy chore.
"It's always a great rivalry when we play UCLA,"
Stanford coach Bill Walsh said.
"Actually, we at Stanford are glad it has become
such a rivalry. For years there, UCLA beat us so
often the game kind of lost its luster."
Those years are over. Last year both teams came
into their matchup in Palo Alto riding four-game
winning streaks, and the Cardinal prevailed, 27-10.
Saturday, Stanford will be looking for its fifth
straight win and a chance to move into the top 10
for the first time in 21 years.
Last weekend did throw a curve in most experts'
view of the conference race. Before the loss to Ari
zona, UCLA had been heralded as the co-front-run
ner with Washington. The Bruins don't have the
Huskies on their schedule this year, and if those
two tied for the title, UCLA would have received the
Rose Bowl bid.
And while it may seem early to talk about New
Year's Day, this weekend's game will have much to
say about the future of the Pac-10 race. While the
Cardinal attempts to legitimate its run for the
Roses, No. 24 Cal visits top-ranked Washington —
just one week after the Huskies barely survived a
scare against No. 20 USC. Both Cal and Washing
ton are unbeaten in conference play.
