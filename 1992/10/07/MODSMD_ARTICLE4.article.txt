# Battling the P.O. box blues

Increased enrollment caught the Stanford Post
Office off guard this year, leaving 69 students to
pick up their mail at Old Union until P.O. boxes be
come available.
The shortage is due to "poor planning on the
University's part," Post Office manager Ray Chun
said. "We were not informed about the increase of
incoming students until mid-summer."
Sixty-nine of the 169 people now on the wait list
to obtain P.O. boxes are Stanford students, Chun
said. The students will be given priority, he added,
and outside individuals requesting boxes will be
accommodated next.
Until boxes become available, the displaced stu
dents will continue to use Old Union Rm. 129 as
their mailing address. They pick up packages and
letters there each day, according to P.O. Box Pro
ject supervisor Fran Forsythe.
Senior Marina Tostado said she realized that
she was out of a P.O. box when she reached into

her old one and pulled out someone else's mail.
"I thought that I had renewed it, but I guess
something went wrong," she said. "Picking up
mail [at Old Union] is not as convenient as being
able to pick up mail at midnight if you want to."
Out of the current 10,000 total boxes, 6,300 are
rented out to Stanford students, Chun said. To
keep up with the growing campus, the Post Office
added 3,000 boxes in 1989.
But over the years, other campus mail services
— including those at Elliot Program Center and
Manzanita Park— have closed down, Forsythe
said.
Also, "more and more students are holding on to
their post office boxes even though they are living at
residences which have deliverable mail," she said,
adding that students who can have mail sent to
their residences should do so.
Crothers Hall, Escondido Village, Mirrielees,
Rains and all Row, Cluster and fraternity houses
have direct mail delivery service, according to
Forsythe.
