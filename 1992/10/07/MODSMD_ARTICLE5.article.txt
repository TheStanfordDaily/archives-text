# Cracking a 'chronic' problem
## 
### Shankar Vedantam 
A new software system designed to contain soft
ware piracy by students will soon be installed in com
puting facilities throughout campus.
The measure, to be introduced in the next few
weeks, will also prevent students from using soft
ware pirated from University clusters on their per
sonal computers, according to Jeff Merriman, direc
tor of residential computing.
Based on two software systems called "Launch
break" and "Keyserver," the measure aims to control
what one senior University official described as "a
chronic problem."
"Students do copy software," said Marick Payton,
director of the Network for Student Information,
which has been instrumental in implementing the
new software systems.
Paul Murray, microcomputer support specialist at
the network, pointed out that screen savers are fre

quently copied as well.
Payton added that the problem is not unique to
students. Referring to his own department's findings
in the matter, he said, "It's partly ignorance, but
there are offices where people weren't compliant with
the copyright requirements."
The new software systems are based on the fact
that the copyright laws of certain packages, designed
to run on networks, are licensed to allow a certain
number of users — as opposed to a specific list of
users — to use the software at any given time.
"We had to check the copyright laws of each soft
ware vendor," Murray said. "Some of them, like
Pagemaker-4.0, don't allow use on a network."
The system is designed to keep a count of the
number of users of each of the packages on the net
work and will prevent any additional users beyond
the licensed limit from accessing the software.
Each time a copy of a soft
ware package is made, legally
or otherwise, the system auto
matically "corrupts" the pro
gram so that it will not run
unless it can locate the license
server, which is on the net
work.
Thus, even an legal copy of
the program can be used only on
the network where its use can
be monitored.
A problem with the system is
that there is no way of monitor
ing whether the individual user
of a package is licensed to do so.
It merely ensures that the
total number of users does not
exceed the number permitted by
copyright.
Merriman emphasized the

program will be a big improve
ment over existing checks on
software piracy. These center
around Residential Computing
Coordinators who are responsi
ble for monitoring the network.
Students are not the only
group to be targeted. Several
departments have been told to
monitor their use of software,
resulting in increased spending
on software this year.
While it is difficult to esti
mate the total costs involved,
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son felt it would be in the range
of "several thousand dollars."
Though many officials
maintain that the new mea
sures are a part of the Univer
sity's commitment to copy
right laws, some indicated that
their timing is due in part to
Stanford's reluctance to incur
more legal trouble than it has
faced in recent months.
