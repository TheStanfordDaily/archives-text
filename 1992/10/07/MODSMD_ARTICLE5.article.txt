# Cracking a 'chronic' problem

A new software system designed to contain soft
ware piracy by students will soon be installed in com
puting facilities throughout campus.
The measure, to be introduced in the next few
weeks, will also prevent students from using soft
ware pirated from University clusters on their per
sonal computers, according to Jeff Merriman, direc
tor of residential computing.
Based on two software systems called "Launch
break" and "Keyserver," the measure aims to control
what one senior University official described as "a
chronic problem."
"Students do copy software," said Marick Payton,
director of the Network for Student Information,
which has been instrumental in implementing the
new software systems.
Paul Murray, microcomputer support specialist at
the network, pointed out that screen savers are fre

quently copied as well.
Payton added that the problem is not unique to
students. Referring to his own department's findings
in the matter, he said, "It's partly ignorance, but
there are offices where people weren't compliant with
the copyright requirements."
The new software systems are based on the fact
that the copyright laws of certain packages, designed
to run on networks, are licensed to allow a certain
number of users — as opposed to a specific list of
users — to use the software at any given time.
"We had to check the copyright laws of each soft
ware vendor," Murray said. "Some of them, like
Pagemaker-4.0, don't allow use on a network."
The system is designed to keep a count of the
number of users of each of the packages on the net
work and will prevent any additional users beyond
the licensed limit from accessing the software.
