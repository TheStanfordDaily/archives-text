# Student partners can buy insurance
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
After a two-year search for a
health insurance underwriter that
would sponsor domestic partners
of Stanford students, the Universi
ty will finally offer them the same
policy granted to student spouses.
In the fall of 1990, the Univer
sity — after nearly two decades of
pressure from gay and lesbian stu
dents — instituted its domestic
partners policy, one of the few in
the nation which guarantees stu
dents' partners equal access to
housing, facilities and health care.
The previous underwriter,
Bankers United Life Assurance
Company, initially refused to ac
cept the extension of the health in
surance to domestic partners, ac
cording to Linda Moran, insur
ance administrator at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center.
As a result, the University
began a search for a new under
writer. Moran said the process of
finding an underwriter took a long

time because most of the other
companies had "no track record to
follow, so to speak."
In addition, Stanford wanted to
keep the same underwriter for
both the domestic partners policy
and the policy for the remainder of
the student body.
"It's much easier to deal with
one company," Moran said, ex
plaining that the University con
cerned itself with keeping "rates
down" and "services up."
To complicate matters further,
both the student and his or her do
mestic partner must possess the
same insurance.
But Bankers Life had a change
of heart and decided to underwrite
Stanford's policy, Moran said. She
explained that private companies
only recently have begun to cover
domestic partners, adding, "It's a
fairly new concept to begin with."
Although a regular deadline for
acquiring health insurance remains
in effect for most of campus, domes
tic partners may sign up any time
this year, according to Moran
