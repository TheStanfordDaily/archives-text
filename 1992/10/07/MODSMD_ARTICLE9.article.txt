Although most students who
live in residences with computer
clusters will soon have access to
some of the most advanced equip
ment available today, students
who live in Row Houses will only
be provided with hardware hav
ing mid-range capabilities.
Row Houses will not be
equipped with laser printers,
Next workstations, Macintosh
Quadras or scanners. However,
they will have Macintosh LCIIs
and Hewlett-Packard Deskwrit
ers.
Jeff Merriman, director of res
idential computing, said the
department is planning two pro
jects which will give Row students

access to upgraded computer clus
ters near their residences.
"We hope to upgrade the exist
ing [Row House] clusters over the
next two years," Merriman said,
"[but] it isn't clear where the
funding is going to come from."
Residential Computing needs
$250,000 to upgrade the existing
clusters. "We will try to find fund
ing on campus either through
Housing and Food Services or
another department," Merriman
said.
Residential Computing is also
planning the creation of several
new smaller computer clusters
near the Row Houses to provide
Row residents with access to
high-end computer equipment.
Both plans are scheduled to be
implemented next year.
