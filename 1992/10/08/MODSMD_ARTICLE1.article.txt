# Disabled students seek community

"We are not the chairs we ride
in. We want to be seen as people,
not as disabilities."
John Asheim, program coordi
nator of the Disability Resource
Center, echoed what he referred to
as the common catch phrases of
Stanford's disabled community.
Asheim is a 1991 graduate who
majored in economics. He is also
legally blind — one of the 150 self
identified people with disabilities
on campus.
"I am not ashamed of my dis
ability. It is a part of me," he said.
Yet he emphasized the need for
people to look beyond the physical
aspects of disability and examine
the social and emotional issues —
a goal that disabled students
themselves have been working to
ward.
And it is with this goal in mind
that Asheim and other students
with disabilities have been contin
uing to foster a stronger, more rec
ognized community which dis
abled students can not only identi
fy with and relate to, but in which
they can take pride.
'Quiet but growing'
"It is hard to identify oneself with
a stigma," said Mark Briemhorst, a
coterminal student in the School of
Education.
He, like Asheim and Law
School student Theodore Chen,
recognized that many students
are hesitant to associate them
selves with the disabled communi
ty-
"Community building within
ourselves is hard," said Briemhorst,
who does not have hands. "Several
of us have been doing this for three
and-a-half to four years."
"It's an ongoing struggle,"
Asheim said. "Students do not
typically identify with the commu
nity. It's a taboo."
In a speech he wrote for this

year's Orientation program
"Faces of the Community," Chen
discussed his experiences as a deaf
student: "When I first came to
Stanford, I had trouble walking
into the Disability Resource Cen
ter without looking over my shoul
der to see if anyone saw me."
Asheim described the process
of students joining and identifying
with the community as a sort of
"coming out."
"It's a quiet but growing com
munity," he said. "But people are
not going to scream and yell it out
— 'Hey, look. I'm disabled!' "
Paul Longmore, a visiting as
sistant professor in the History
Department, said when students
with disabilities first come to
Stanford, most of them have had
little contact with the disabled
community.
Having been accepted to Stan
ford, "these students are the epito
me of overcomers and achievers,"
said Longmore, whose disability is
a result of polio. "But part of this
'overcoming' mentality is that we
strive alone.
"We see it as an individual
problem, a problem in our bodies
and our attitudes," he continued.
"The consequences are that they
don't associate with other people
with disabilities as a way to escape
social stigma."
Community members also be
lieve there is a lack of recognition
of a specific disabled community
from the outside.
For example, both Chen and
Briemhorst pointed out that peo
ple often do not make the distinc
tion between the DRC and Dis
abled Students at Stanford.
"The DRC is an administrative
organization, and DSS is a student
group," said Chen, a DSS member.
"We have a strong relationship
with the DRC . . . but at the same
time it's important that we main
tain an identity separate from the
