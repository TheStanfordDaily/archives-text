# Disabled students seek community
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
"We are not the chairs we ride
in. We want to be seen as people,
not as disabilities."
John Asheim, program coordi
nator of the Disability Resource
Center, echoed what he referred to
as the common catch phrases of
Stanford's disabled community.
Asheim is a 1991 graduate who
majored in economics. He is also
legally blind — one of the 150 self
identified people with disabilities
on campus.
"I am not ashamed of my dis
ability. It is a part of me," he said.
Yet he emphasized the need for
people to look beyond the physical
aspects of disability and examine
the social and emotional issues —
a goal that disabled students
themselves have been working to
ward.
And it is with this goal in mind
that Asheim and other students
with disabilities have been contin
uing to foster a stronger, more rec
ognized community which dis
abled students can not only identi
fy with and relate to, but in which
they can take pride.
'Quiet but growing'
"It is hard to identify oneself with
a stigma," said Mark Briemhorst, a
coterminal student in the School of
Education.
He, like Asheim and Law
School student Theodore Chen,
recognized that many students
are hesitant to associate them
selves with the disabled communi
ty-
"Community building within
ourselves is hard," said Briemhorst,
who does not have hands. "Several
of us have been doing this for three
and-a-half to four years."
"It's an ongoing struggle,"
Asheim said. "Students do not
typically identify with the commu
nity. It's a taboo."
In a speech he wrote for this

year's Orientation program
"Faces of the Community," Chen
discussed his experiences as a deaf
student: "When I first came to
Stanford, I had trouble walking
into the Disability Resource Cen
ter without looking over my shoul
der to see if anyone saw me."
Asheim described the process
of students joining and identifying
with the community as a sort of
"coming out."
"It's a quiet but growing com
munity," he said. "But people are
not going to scream and yell it out
— 'Hey, look. I'm disabled!' "
Paul Longmore, a visiting as
sistant professor in the History
Department, said when students
with disabilities first come to
Stanford, most of them have had
little contact with the disabled
community.
Having been accepted to Stan
ford, "these students are the epito
me of overcomers and achievers,"
said Longmore, whose disability is
a result of polio. "But part of this
'overcoming' mentality is that we
strive alone.
"We see it as an individual
problem, a problem in our bodies
and our attitudes," he continued.
"The consequences are that they
don't associate with other people
with disabilities as a way to escape
social stigma."
Community members also be
lieve there is a lack of recognition
of a specific disabled community
from the outside.
For example, both Chen and
Briemhorst pointed out that peo
ple often do not make the distinc
tion between the DRC and Dis
abled Students at Stanford.
"The DRC is an administrative
organization, and DSS is a student
group," said Chen, a DSS member.
"We have a strong relationship
with the DRC . . . but at the same
time it's important that we main
tain an identity separate from the
DRC."
'A valid minority'
Recognition as a community
also starts with the recognition of
individuals. Asheim said because
people tend to view those with dis
abilities only in terms of their
physical differences, disabled stu
dents are sometimes not viewed as
a community in the same way eth
nic groups are.
Chen said when he spoke for
the Disabled Students Speakers
Bureau in Ujamaa, "people were
surprised at how many similarities
there were between [disabled peo
ples'l experiences and those of
African - Americans.
"We need to be accepted as a
valid minority, and I'm not sure
people really do," he said. "At this
point, I can't help but feel we are
viewed as outsiders trying to get in
on the action."
Although outsiders' acceptance
of disabled people as a minority
group may not be complete, Long
more said he believes members of
the community have not viewed
themselves as a cohesive group
until fairly recently.
"This generation has a new con
sciousness that defines themselves
not in terms of medical or physical
characteristics, but in terms of
social and economical issues and
overcoming prejudice," Longmore
said.
Because of this shift in defini
tions, Longmore said "a remark
able and revolutionary change"
has been occurring in which dis

abled people "see themselves as
being a minority group, and want
to be identified with one another."
And yet, the question of belong
ing to a community can be decep
tive.
Chen addressed the issue of
being associated with more than
one minority group in his "Faces"
speech:
"I'm not what I seem to be. Peo
ple look at me and see an ABC —
American-Born Chinese. Yes, I am
Asian. But there's another side of
me that's more important.... I
am disabled.
"I'd never had much of a sense
of belonging to the Asian commu
nity as I do with the disabled stu
dent community. I can complain
about something related to my
own disability and the others will
understand. ... And that is just
about the only time when I know I
will be accepted for who I am."
'Common chord of experience'
"There are ways we open up
with each other that we can't in a
mixed group," Briemhorst said,
explaining the importance of DSS.
The support-based group focus
es on the social issues of life as a
disabled student and providing a
community with which these stu
dents can identify.
Although attendance fluctuated
at the group's weekly meetings
last year, Briemhorst estimated it
at about 15 to 20 students.
The group is "run by consen
sus," Briemhorst said. Although
the members have considered
"politicizing," they chose not to,
opting to provide a comfortable,
social atmosphere in which stu
dents with disabilities can "hang
out" and talk.

Longmore said although he
used to think the disabled commu
nity would have to be built by
social groups forming out of com
mon political concerns, he now
believes otherwise.
"Political activism is not neces
sarily the beginning of the disabled
community," Longmore
explained. "Friendships are
formed and the social community
is developed."

Briemhorst said his experi
ences with disabled students at
Stanford have been "very reward
ing" on both social and personal
levels.
"I discovered so many things
about myself I used to think,
'That's just Mark,' " he said. "But
then I talked to people with all dif
ferent disabilities and I see so
many similarities in the ways

we've been mistreated by people
and the ways we've developed."
Longmore said when students
with disabilities first join a group
like the DSS, they usually have
had little previous interaction with
disabled people, and "when they
make friends and compare notes
it's a revelation.
"A lot of the feelings they've had
are conformed and legitimized," he
explained. "There's a lot of suste
nance, support and identity confir
mation. It's a circle of friends like
they've never had before."
Although most people who have
joined the group and identify with
it are "pretty much comfortable"
with being a publicly visible group,
Briemhorst said the group has
drawn a few stares when it meets
on campus.
"For people who are not used to
seeing it, it is really strange to see 20
people with disabilities walking and
wheeling around," he conceded.
However, superficial percep
tions of people with disabilities can
often lead to misguided presump
tions.
"If I'm in public with a female
disabled student, people will auto
matically think, 'Oh how cute,
they found each other,' "
Briemhorst said. "That's really
annoying."
Briemhorst said he used to be
concerned about keeping DSS at a
certain size, but now he is more
concerned about the quality of dis
cussion.
Although the group does not
actively recruit members, it is
"very warm and welcoming" to
new members, Briemhorst said.
"It is extraordinarily impressive,"
he said, "when someone is brave
enough to join the group."

understand. ... And that is just
about the only time when I know I
will be accepted for who I am."
'Common chord of experience'
"There are ways we open up
with each other that we can't in a
mixed group," Briemhorst said,
explaining the importance of DSS.
The support-based group focus
es on the social issues of life as a
disabled student and providing a
community with which these stu
dents can identify.
Although attendance fluctuated
at the group's weekly meetings
last year, Briemhorst estimated it
at about 15 to 20 students.
The group is "run by consen
sus," Briemhorst said. Although
the members have considered
"politicizing," they chose not to,
opting to provide a comfortable,
social atmosphere in which stu
dents with disabilities can "hang
out" and talk.

Longmore said although he
used to think the disabled commu
nity would have to be built by
social groups forming out of com
mon political concerns, he now
believes otherwise.
"Political activism is not neces
sarily the beginning of the disabled
community," Longmore
explained. "Friendships are
formed and the social community
is developed."

Briemhorst said his experi
ences with disabled students at
Stanford have been "very reward
ing" on both social and personal
levels.
"I discovered so many things
about myself I used to think,
'That's just Mark,' " he said. "But
then I talked to people with all dif
ferent disabilities and I see so
many similarities in the ways

we've been mistreated by people
and the ways we've developed."
Longmore said when students
with disabilities first join a group
like the DSS, they usually have
had little previous interaction with
disabled people, and "when they
make friends and compare notes
it's a revelation.
"A lot of the feelings they've had
are conformed and legitimized," he
explained. "There's a lot of suste
nance, support and identity confir
mation. It's a circle of friends like
they've never had before."
Although most people who have
joined the group and identify with
it are "pretty much comfortable"
with being a publicly visible group,
Briemhorst said the group has
drawn a few stares when it meets
on campus.
"For people who are not used to
seeing it, it is really strange to see 20
people with disabilities walking and
wheeling around," he conceded.
However, superficial percep
tions of people with disabilities can
often lead to misguided presump
tions.
"If I'm in public with a female
disabled student, people will auto
matically think, 'Oh how cute,
they found each other,' "
Briemhorst said. "That's really
annoying."
Briemhorst said he used to be
concerned about keeping DSS at a
certain size, but now he is more
concerned about the quality of dis
cussion.
Although the group does not
actively recruit members, it is
"very warm and welcoming" to
new members, Briemhorst said.
"It is extraordinarily impressive,"
he said, "when someone is brave
enough to join the group."


John Asheim
"We are not the chairs we ride
in. We want to be seen as people,
not as disabilities."
John Asheim, program coordi
nator of the Disability Resource
Center, echoed what he referred to
as the common catch phrases of
Stanford's disabled community.
Asheim is a 1991 graduate who
majored in economics. He is also
legally blind — one of the 150 self
identified people with disabilities
on campus.
"I am not ashamed of my dis
ability. It is a part of me," he said.
Yet he emphasized the need for
people to look beyond the physical
aspects of disability and examine
the social and emotional issues —
a goal that disabled students
themselves have been working to
ward.
And it is with this goal in mind
that Asheim and other students
with disabilities have been contin
uing to foster a stronger, more rec
ognized community which dis
abled students can not only identi
fy with and relate to, but in which
they can take pride.
'Quiet but growing'
"It is hard to identify oneself with
a stigma," said Mark Briemhorst, a
coterminal student in the School of
Education.
He, like Asheim and Law
School student Theodore Chen,
recognized that many students
are hesitant to associate them
selves with the disabled communi
ty-
"Community building within
ourselves is hard," said Briemhorst,
who does not have hands. "Several
of us have been doing this for three
and-a-half to four years."
"It's an ongoing struggle,"
Asheim said. "Students do not
typically identify with the commu
nity. It's a taboo."
In a speech he wrote for this

year's Orientation program
"Faces of the Community," Chen
discussed his experiences as a deaf
student: "When I first came to
Stanford, I had trouble walking
into the Disability Resource Cen
ter without looking over my shoul
der to see if anyone saw me."
Asheim described the process
of students joining and identifying
with the community as a sort of
"coming out."
"It's a quiet but growing com
munity," he said. "But people are
not going to scream and yell it out
— 'Hey, look. I'm disabled!' "
Paul Longmore, a visiting as
sistant professor in the History
Department, said when students
with disabilities first come to
Stanford, most of them have had
little contact with the disabled
community.
Having been accepted to Stan
ford, "these students are the epito
me of overcomers and achievers,"
said Longmore, whose disability is
a result of polio. "But part of this
'overcoming' mentality is that we
strive alone.
"We see it as an individual
problem, a problem in our bodies
and our attitudes," he continued.
"The consequences are that they
don't associate with other people
with disabilities as a way to escape
social stigma."
Community members also be
lieve there is a lack of recognition
of a specific disabled community
from the outside.
For example, both Chen and
Briemhorst pointed out that peo
ple often do not make the distinc
tion between the DRC and Dis
abled Students at Stanford.
"The DRC is an administrative
organization, and DSS is a student
group," said Chen, a DSS member.
"We have a strong relationship
with the DRC . . . but at the same
time it's important that we main
tain an identity separate from the
DRC."
'A valid minority'
Recognition as a community
also starts with the recognition of
individuals. Asheim said because
people tend to view those with dis
abilities only in terms of their
physical differences, disabled stu
dents are sometimes not viewed as
a community in the same way eth
nic groups are.
Chen said when he spoke for
the Disabled Students Speakers
Bureau in Ujamaa, "people were
surprised at how many similarities
there were between [disabled peo
ples'l experiences and those of
African - Americans.
"We need to be accepted as a
valid minority, and I'm not sure
people really do," he said. "At this
point, I can't help but feel we are
viewed as outsiders trying to get in
on the action."
Although outsiders' acceptance
of disabled people as a minority
group may not be complete, Long
more said he believes members of
the community have not viewed
themselves as a cohesive group
until fairly recently.
"This generation has a new con
sciousness that defines themselves
not in terms of medical or physical
characteristics, but in terms of
social and economical issues and
overcoming prejudice," Longmore
said.
Because of this shift in defini
tions, Longmore said "a remark
able and revolutionary change"
has been occurring in which dis

abled people "see themselves as
being a minority group, and want
to be identified with one another."
And yet, the question of belong
ing to a community can be decep
tive.
Chen addressed the issue of
being associated with more than
one minority group in his "Faces"
speech:
"I'm not what I seem to be. Peo
ple look at me and see an ABC —
American-Born Chinese. Yes, I am
Asian. But there's another side of
me that's more important.... I
am disabled.
"I'd never had much of a sense
of belonging to the Asian commu
nity as I do with the disabled stu
dent community. I can complain
about something related to my
own disability and the others will
understand. ... And that is just
about the only time when I know I
will be accepted for who I am."

sistant professor in the History
Department, said when students
with disabilities first come to
Stanford, most of them have had
little contact with the disabled
community.
Having been accepted to Stan
ford, "these students are the epito
me of overcomers and achievers,"
said Longmore, whose disability is
a result of polio. "But part of this
'overcoming' mentality is that we
strive alone.
"We see it as an individual
problem, a problem in our bodies
and our attitudes," he continued.
"The consequences are that they
don't associate with other people
with disabilities as a way to escape
social stigma."
Community members also be
lieve there is a lack of recognition
of a specific disabled community
from the outside.
For example, both Chen and
Briemhorst pointed out that peo
ple often do not make the distinc
tion between the DRC and Dis
abled Students at Stanford.
"The DRC is an administrative
organization, and DSS is a student
group," said Chen, a DSS member.
"We have a strong relationship
with the DRC . . . but at the same
time it's important that we main
tain an identity separate from the
DRC."
'A valid minority'
Recognition as a community
also starts with the recognition of
individuals. Asheim said because
people tend to view those with dis
abilities only in terms of their
physical differences, disabled stu
dents are sometimes not viewed as
a community in the same way eth
nic groups are.
Chen said when he spoke for
the Disabled Students Speakers
Bureau in Ujamaa, "people were
surprised at how many similarities
there were between [disabled peo
ples'l experiences and those of
African - Americans.
"We need to be accepted as a
valid minority, and I'm not sure
people really do," he said. "At this
point, I can't help but feel we are
viewed as outsiders trying to get in
on the action."
Although outsiders' acceptance
of disabled people as a minority
group may not be complete, Long
more said he believes members of
the community have not viewed
themselves as a cohesive group
until fairly recently.
"This generation has a new con
sciousness that defines themselves
not in terms of medical or physical
characteristics, but in terms of
social and economical issues and
overcoming prejudice," Longmore
said.
Because of this shift in defini
tions, Longmore said "a remark
able and revolutionary change"
has been occurring in which dis

abled people "see themselves as
being a minority group, and want
to be identified with one another."
And yet, the question of belong
ing to a community can be decep
tive.
Chen addressed the issue of
being associated with more than
one minority group in his "Faces"
speech:
"I'm not what I seem to be. Peo
ple look at me and see an ABC —
American-Born Chinese. Yes, I am
Asian. But there's another side of
me that's more important.... I
am disabled.
"I'd never had much of a sense
of belonging to the Asian commu
nity as I do with the disabled stu
dent community. I can complain
about something related to my
own disability and the others will
understand. ... And that is just
about the only time when I know I
will be accepted for who I am."
'Common chord of experience'
"There are ways we open up
with each other that we can't in a
mixed group," Briemhorst said,
explaining the importance of DSS.
The support-based group focus
es on the social issues of life as a
disabled student and providing a
community with which these stu
dents can identify.
Although attendance fluctuated
at the group's weekly meetings
last year, Briemhorst estimated it
at about 15 to 20 students.
The group is "run by consen
sus," Briemhorst said. Although
the members have considered
"politicizing," they chose not to,
opting to provide a comfortable,
social atmosphere in which stu
dents with disabilities can "hang
out" and talk.

Longmore said although he
used to think the disabled commu
nity would have to be built by
social groups forming out of com
mon political concerns, he now
believes otherwise.
"Political activism is not neces
sarily the beginning of the disabled
community," Longmore
explained. "Friendships are
formed and the social community
is developed."

Briemhorst said his experi
ences with disabled students at
Stanford have been "very reward
ing" on both social and personal
levels.
"I discovered so many things
about myself I used to think,
'That's just Mark,' " he said. "But
then I talked to people with all dif
ferent disabilities and I see so
many similarities in the ways

we've been mistreated by people
and the ways we've developed."
Longmore said when students
with disabilities first join a group
like the DSS, they usually have
had little previous interaction with
disabled people, and "when they
make friends and compare notes
it's a revelation.
"A lot of the feelings they've had
are conformed and legitimized," he
explained. "There's a lot of suste
nance, support and identity confir
mation. It's a circle of friends like
they've never had before."
Although most people who have
joined the group and identify with
it are "pretty much comfortable"
with being a publicly visible group,
Briemhorst said the group has
drawn a few stares when it meets
on campus.
"For people who are not used to
seeing it, it is really strange to see 20
people with disabilities walking and
wheeling around," he conceded.
However, superficial percep
tions of people with disabilities can
often lead to misguided presump
tions.
"If I'm in public with a female
disabled student, people will auto
matically think, 'Oh how cute,
they found each other,' "
Briemhorst said. "That's really
annoying."
Briemhorst said he used to be
concerned about keeping DSS at a
certain size, but now he is more
concerned about the quality of dis
cussion.
Although the group does not
actively recruit members, it is
"very warm and welcoming" to
new members, Briemhorst said.
"It is extraordinarily impressive,"
he said, "when someone is brave
enough to join the group."
