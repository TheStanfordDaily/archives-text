# Senate avoids controversy, excitement at first meeting
## 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate began its year last night with
a quiet and orderly meeting filled with adminis
trative bills and few controversial topics.
"It's good to see people agreeing on issues,"
Senate Chair Ron Brown said. "We're just getting
back into the groove of things."
Graduate senator Brian Flachs agreed, adding,
"It was mostly an administrative meeting."
Business seemed to proceed as usual, and the
lack of a Council of Presidents has not appeared to
hamper the ASSU's operations — at least not yet.
Deputy Chair Derek Miyahara, chair of the
University Relations Committee, informed the
senate that University President Gerhard Casper
will address them as former President Donald
Kennedy did.
Miyahara said Casper has agreed to meet with
the ASSU once per quarter, but it has not yet been
determined if Casper will receive the questions in
advance or take them from the floor.
Financial Manager Christine Vargas said the
line of credit extended to Residential Computing
last June to accelerate installation of computer
clusters in Row houses has not been used.
Flachs said the matter will be discussed at the
next budget and finance meeting.
In administrative business, the senate passed a
bill authorizing Senate Clerk Jeff Baird to con
duct a search for a permanent administrative
manager. The resignation of former Administra

tive Manager Enda Hu last week created the
vacancy.
Applicants for the position will be considered at
the Oct. 20 senate meeting. The bill approved
Stephen Craig, Hu's former assistant, as interim
administrative assistant.
The senate also passed a bill that "strongly
opposes" any changes in the ASSU business
office, which Tresidder Union is considering mov
ing. .
The issue has been in negotiations with Tresid
der since last year, as ASSU senators feel they
need the space to continue providing the same ser
vices to students.
The senate also discussed better informing stu
dents about fee refunds. Undergraduate senator
Erik Maurer suggested that senators visit dorms
and advertise around campus to explain fee
refunds to students.
"We want to raise the image (of the ASSU] and
go out to the dorms," Maurer said.
A bill written by senators Ying-Ying Goh and
Mork Murdock was presented before the senate to
allocate excess money from senate discretionary
funds to support the Lively Arts at Stanford and
an ASSU pilot funding project.
The bill will be discussed and voted on at a later
date.
The pilot program has funded half-priced tick
ets for students to attend Lively Arts perfor
mances at Stanford.
Murdock said more than 3,000 tickets have
been sold to date.
