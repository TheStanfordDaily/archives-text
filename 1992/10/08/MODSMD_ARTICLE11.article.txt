# Fret no longer, Wilburites, your savior's here
## Food Service's first trained chef whips up 'Mustard Pickle Eggs' 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
Wilbur Dining Hall has taken
on a new, improved look since the
arrival of David Larousse, Food
Service's first executive chef, and
Larousse promises food befitting
the look will follow.
"Six months from now people
will say Wilbur is one of the best
halls to eat at," he claims.
Larousse, an accomplished
chef and author, began his post
last month after he became the
first person hired by Food Service
to have formal culinary training.
"My main tasks are training and
recipe development," says
Larousse, "the goal being to
improve the food and Food Service."
So far Larousse has added har
vest-type decorations and has
placed quotes, which he labelled
"Food for Thought," near the
entrance of the dining hall. He says
he plans to change the decorations
"once every month or two."
But while he's been quick to
spruce up the hall, he says he's
still learning in the kitchen. "I'm
still getting my balance learning
all the things I need to learn. I'm
trying to develop a rapport with
the kitchen staff."
Larousse, who lives in San
Francisco, came to Stanford after
holding numerous cooking posi
tions throughout the United
States and world.
He is a 1973 graduate of the
Culinary Institute of America in
Hyde Park, New York, which he
describes as "the granddaddy of
all culinary institutes."
Having been a chef in every

state in New England, Larousse
then cooked for eight years in San
Francisco. Most recently, he was
a chef instructor at Diablo Valley
College. He also has apprenticed
in Strasbourg, France and spent
time as a chef in the West Indies.
Larousse says he has already
begun working on new recipes for
Food Service.
He says he recently tried a veg
etarian cassoulet — a meal usual
ly made with a lot of meat— but
that "it didn't go very well."
"Larousse's Internationally
Famous Mustard Pickle Eggs"
and "a great industrial-strength
red sauce with no meat and lots of
vegetables and herbs" are two
meals Larousse is excited to make
for students.
Student input is crucial to the
success of his efforts, Larousse
says, and he spends lunch and
dinner five days a week talking
and getting to know students.
"I love [students] because
there's such a high level of intel
lectual pursuit," he says."I like
that."
One of Larousse's goals is to
improve the appearance of the
food.
"People eat with their eyes
first," he says.
As far as responding to stu
dents' food concerns such as
healthfulness and vegetarian
entrees, Larousse says he will try
to listen to their comments.
According to Larousse, Food
Service uses as many fresh prod
ucts as they can and that he plans
to have a vegetarian line twice a

week.
Larousse, who says he is
always dreaming up new dishes,
says his newest vegetarian meal
will be "a sweet and pungent
grilled tofu." He is also working
on developing strictly meatless
dishes.
"Everyone works very hard to
accommodate dining patrons at
Wilbur Hall," he says.
Larousse's favorite types of
foods to cook are Mediterranean:
Greek, Italian, Moroccan and
North African.
"It's the cradle of the Western
world," says Larousse. "It's very
passionate food in cooking."
Larousse has a variety of other
interests outside of cooking,

including writing, art and T'ai
Chi. "My handle is I'm an artist
stuck in the body of a chef," he
jokes.
He has worked on three books
about food, is completing a fourth
and researching a fifth. Larousse
did the writing, the drawing and
arranged the photography for his
first book, "Edible Art," pub
lished in 1986.
"The Sauce Bible," his newest
book, will be released by its pub
lisher in May.
In the meantime, however,
Larousse plans to try to learn all
the information that he needs to
and continue to work with the
kitchen's staff to improve Food
Service.
"The people in the kitchen
need to feel that they can trust
me," Larousse says."The
kitchen is an emotionally intense
place."

first person hired by Food Service
to have formal culinary training.
"My main tasks are training and
recipe development," says
Larousse, "the goal being to
improve the food and Food Service."
So far Larousse has added har
vest-type decorations and has
placed quotes, which he labelled
"Food for Thought," near the
entrance of the dining hall. He says
he plans to change the decorations
"once every month or two."
But while he's been quick to
spruce up the hall, he says he's
still learning in the kitchen. "I'm
still getting my balance learning
all the things I need to learn. I'm
trying to develop a rapport with
the kitchen staff."
Larousse, who lives in San
Francisco, came to Stanford after
holding numerous cooking posi
tions throughout the United
States and world.
He is a 1973 graduate of the
Culinary Institute of America in
Hyde Park, New York, which he
describes as "the granddaddy of
all culinary institutes."
Having been a chef in every

state in New England, Larousse
then cooked for eight years in San
Francisco. Most recently, he was
a chef instructor at Diablo Valley
College. He also has apprenticed
in Strasbourg, France and spent
time as a chef in the West Indies.
Larousse says he has already
begun working on new recipes for
Food Service.
He says he recently tried a veg
etarian cassoulet — a meal usual
ly made with a lot of meat— but
that "it didn't go very well."
"Larousse's Internationally
Famous Mustard Pickle Eggs"
and "a great industrial-strength
red sauce with no meat and lots of
vegetables and herbs" are two
meals Larousse is excited to make
for students.
Student input is crucial to the
success of his efforts, Larousse
says, and he spends lunch and
dinner five days a week talking
and getting to know students.
"I love [students] because
there's such a high level of intel
lectual pursuit," he says."I like
that."
One of Larousse's goals is to
improve the appearance of the
food.
"People eat with their eyes
first," he says.
As far as responding to stu
dents' food concerns such as
healthfulness and vegetarian
entrees, Larousse says he will try
to listen to their comments.
According to Larousse, Food
Service uses as many fresh prod
ucts as they can and that he plans
to have a vegetarian line twice a

week.
Larousse, who says he is
always dreaming up new dishes,
says his newest vegetarian meal
will be "a sweet and pungent
grilled tofu." He is also working
on developing strictly meatless
dishes.
"Everyone works very hard to
accommodate dining patrons at
Wilbur Hall," he says.
Larousse's favorite types of
foods to cook are Mediterranean:
Greek, Italian, Moroccan and
North African.
"It's the cradle of the Western
world," says Larousse. "It's very
passionate food in cooking."
Larousse has a variety of other
interests outside of cooking,

including writing, art and T'ai
Chi. "My handle is I'm an artist
stuck in the body of a chef," he
jokes.
He has worked on three books
about food, is completing a fourth
and researching a fifth. Larousse
did the writing, the drawing and
arranged the photography for his
first book, "Edible Art," pub
lished in 1986.
"The Sauce Bible," his newest
book, will be released by its pub
lisher in May.
In the meantime, however,
Larousse plans to try to learn all
the information that he needs to
and continue to work with the
kitchen's staff to improve Food
Service.
"The people in the kitchen
need to feel that they can trust
me," Larousse says."The
kitchen is an emotionally intense
place."
