'Full House' beats Perot-on-TV
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Aiming for the White House, Ross Perot
took on "Full House." And though he didn't topple that hit ABC
sitcom, his leap into paid television campaigning Tuesday night
soundly beat NBC's "Quantum Leap."
Early in Perot's taped 30-minute talk, he told his audience, "I
can't compete with some of these other entertainment shows."
Then he asked viewers to stick with him and the sober message he
had brought them. Many did.
Perot's plain-spoken presentation, titled "Jobs, Debt and the
Washington Mess," aired from 8 to 8:30 p.m. EDT on CBS, and it
won second-place in its time period, according to national
overnight ratings released yesterday by A.C. Nielsen Co.
Perot-on-TV had a 12.2 national rating, which translates into
11.4 million households and 16.5 million viewers.
That compares to "Full House," which won the half-hour with
a 16.8 rating and 27 percent share.
"Quantum Leap" was third with a 9.8 rating and a 16 share.
The half-hour of CBS airtime, for which Perot paid a reported
$380,000, was devoted to his vision of a nation in distress.
