Teacher and critic Allan Bloom dies
(AP) — Allan Bloom, author of "The Closing of the American
Mind," a 1987 best-seller which critiqued America's colleges and
universities, died yesterday at the age of 62.
Bloom, a University of Chicago professor, died of peptic ulcer
bleeding complicated by liver failure.
His book, subtitled "How Higher Education Has Failed Democ
racy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students," challenged
universities to return to a more traditional, classic curriculum.
His close friend and colleague, Saul Bellow, praised Bloom for
his teaching expertise and his ability to relate to his students.
"Allan Bloom was a true teacher, by which I mean he believed
it to be monstrous that any of us should lose our souls through
ignorance," said Bellow, also a University of Chicago professor
and a Nobel Prize-winning author.
The National Endowment for the Humanities awarded Bloom
the Charles Frankel Prize this year in recognition of his work,
noting that his best-seller "continues to shape public and aca
demic discussion." The book has sold more than a million copies.
Bloom's book said all was well on U.S. campuses until the
1960s when students began asking rude questions, called ancient
verities mere opinions and even placed Mick Jagger and his ilk
above Bloom's beloved Plato and Aristotle as popular icons.
Columnist George Will said Bloom was a modern-day prophet.
"At the risk of scrambling categories in a way that he, in his
analytical rigorousness, would have disapproved, let us say that
Allan Bloom was America's cheerful Cassandra," he said.
