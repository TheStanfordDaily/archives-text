# Ceremony celebrates free trade zone
## But lawmakers must still approve 
### 
SAN ANTONIO (AP) - Presi
dent Bush participated in a high
profile ceremony in Texas yester
day to highlight the successful
negotiation of an agreement cre
ating the world's largest free
trade zone.
As leaders of the three nations
looked on, their trade ministers
initialed the completed text in
what was largely a symbolic cere
mony. Under U.S. law, Bush can
not actually sign the agreement
before Dec. 17.
With Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney and Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gor
tari looking on, Bush hailed the
2,000-page North American Free
Trade Agreement that was nego
tiated last August.
"This meeting marks a turning
point in the history of our three
countries," Bush told a crowd of
dignitaries. "We are creating the
largest, richest and most produc
tive market in the entire world."
Bush defended the pact against
criticism that it will result in the
loss of U.S. jobs from companies
being lured across the border to
Mexico. Instead, Bush said the
removal of trade barriers would
expand U.S. exports to Mexico.
Critics of the trade pact noted
that a similar "initialing" cere
mony was not held when the
United States negotiated a free
trade agreement with Canada in
1988.
Calling the event "pure politi
cal theater," Sen. Max Baucus, D-
Mont., a key congressional critic
of the accord, said, "If the Bush
administration spent as much
time and energy negotiating the
NAFTA as it spends holding cam
paign events built around it, we
would have a far better NAFTA."
If approved by lawmakers in all
three countries, the trade agree
ment is scheduled to go into effect
on Jan. 1, 1994, beginning a pro

cess of removing all tariffs and
other barriers to trade, services
and investment between the three
countries over a 15-year period.
American labor unions and
many environmentalists strongly
oppose the pact, charging that it
will cost up to a half-million
American jobs as more companies
move their operations to Mexico
to take advantage of low wages
and lax enforcement of environ

mental laws.
Democratic candidate Bill Clin
ton on Sunday came out in sup
port of the free trade agreement
although he said additional steps
should be taken to protect Ameri
can jobs and the environment.
He said his objections could be
met without re-negotiating the
pact, a position that disappointed
the AFL-CIO and environmental
groups who have charged that the

current deal is so fundamentally
flawed that it will have to be rene
gotiated.
Texas, with its 32 electoral
votes, is a critical state for Bush
as he tries to overtake Clinton. A
new poll published today in the
Washington Times showed Bush
leading in Texas with 40 percent
of those surveyed compared to 35
percent for Clinton and 14 per
cent for Perot.
