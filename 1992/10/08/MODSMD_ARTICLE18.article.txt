## RA-less residences 
### 
IN FOUR-CLASS AND fresh
men dorms, the role of resident
assistants is an important part of
the community. They are often
instrumental in helping freshmen
and transfer students — not to men
tion some upperclassmen — feel
more comfortable in what can some
times be an intimidating setting.
But the Office of Residential
Education's steadfast policy of
providing RA services even in resi
dences not setup as communities
is questionable.
RAs in Mirrielees and the Suites
are paid a salary equal to the aver
age cost of room and board to do a
fraction of the work that most
four-class and freshmen RAs are
responsible for.
Apartment or suite-style resi
dences tend to de-emphasize the
importance of "community," a fea
ture elaborately developed in regular
dorms. The majority of students who
have chosen to live in this style have

done so in order to escape dorm life.
Hence the structural layout of
both residences are conducive to
privacy. What services can RAs
hope to offer other than an occa
sional loaning of the master key to
locked-out students, or the posting
of informational fliers?
Such conditions do not allow for
any semblance of normal dorm
life. Further, RAs are not the only
means by which apartment-style
dorms and the suites can be ade
quately served.
One alternative would be for
residences to elect a student repre
sentative who hold a dorm master
key and be responsible for posting
informational fliers and coordinat
ing events and residential pro
gramming.
Such a representative could be
paid for his or her services without
the Res Ed guarantee of a salary
comparable to the cost of room and
board on campus.
