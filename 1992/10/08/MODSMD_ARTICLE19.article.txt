Brunch, the word
sounds so harmless. Eggs,
juice, maybe a breakfast
meat or two. . . . But for unsus
pecting frosh women, it can be a
bit more insidious.
Every fall, several of the housed
fraternities hold champagne brunch
es, to which they invite "selected"
women — chosen through a process
consisting almost entirely of scan
ning stolen frosh books.
The brunches take place during
the first week of school, when most
of the women are still trying to
adjust to being away from their fam
ilies. Like other members of the
freshmen class, many of these
women are at the most vulnerable
point in their Stanford careers.
Many just won't be prepared to
be "wooed" by a group of older
men, who have their act down a
little too smoothly.
By segregating women based on

inaccurate photos, the brunches
cause rifts in freshmen dorms that
might otherwise be avoided entire
ly — or at least postponed to a
later point in the year. The insecu
rity which comes part and parcel
of freshman year need not be
played upon by frat brothers with
ulterior motives.
If the campus' fraternities wish
to introduce the Greek system to
the freshman class there are cer
tainly less intimidating ways to do
so: presentations in freshman
dorms or co-ed group tours of fra
ternity houses.
Inviting attractive 17 and 18-
year olds to drink champagne on
their first week of school in order
to draw them into the house,
seems a throwback to a time when
women were treated in ways no
longer acceptable on this campus.
Hey, pick on somebody your
own size.
