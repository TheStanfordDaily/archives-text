# Transfers petition to have CIV waived
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Jumping into campus politics
after only a week of classes, four
transfer students are leading a pe
tition drive to have the Cultures,
Ideas and Values requirement
waived for transfers.
In doing so, they are reopening
a debate on whether transfer stu
dents should take CIV, a debate
that was closed only four months
ago when the Faculty Senate re
jected a proposal to alter the
course requirement for transfers.
According to Anthony Sabadi
ni, a sophomore transfer from
Colby College in Waterville,
Maine, the petitions "are basically
asking for the administration to
waive the CIV requirement . . .
when we only have three or, in
many cases, two years here, 15
units is a lot of time to sacrifice."
Sabadini said the group has al
ready collected 25 signatures, and
hopes to get more than 100 before
submitting the petitions to CIV of

ficials.
Transfer credit evaluator
Susan PfeifTer said there are 144
transfers, all of whom are re
quired to take CIV or fulfill the re
quirements with transfer credits.
But the latter option is rare, Pfeif
fer said, because few other schools
have courses similar to CIV.
Sabadini said he hoped that
after hearing the transfers' con
cerns, the University will "open
up a dialogue" with the students.
While he doesn't necessarily ex
pect the CIV requirement to be
waived completely, he said other
options more palatable to trans
fers are available.
"They have an accelerated
(Freshman) English quarter, why
don't they have an accelerated
CIV quarter for transfer stu
dents?" Sabadini said.
Such a solution, transfers say,
would solve another problem they
have with CIV â€” the introductory
level of the courses.
"We've already succeeded in an
academic setting, or we wouldn't
be here," Sabadlni said. "It seems
redundant to teach us to write a
term paper again.
"It's not to slight freshmen,"
he continued, but "we're juniors
and sophomores, and it's time we
were treated like juniors and
sophomores."
"I loved Dartmouth, I was very
happy there," said sophomore
transfer Maria Guttman. "But as
an engineering major, I had no
choices. That's why I decided to
leave ... and I came here expecting
more, and they're closing doors to
us" with extensive requirements.
In a June meeting, the Faculty
Senate discussed and rejected by a
divided voice vote a proposal to
alter the CIV requirements for
transfers.
"The proposal was: Transfers
who had not already satisfied the
CIV requirement could choose to do
so either by taking one of the CIV
tracks or taking three courses of a
similar nature from the humanities
... so that the upperclassmen could
do more advanced work," said His
tory Prof. Paul Seaver, head of the
CIV program committee.
CIV Program Administrator
Margaret Harris said the goals of
the petition organizers mirror the
senate proposal that was rejected .
"Basically we did that last year
and got turned down," she said.
Acting registrar Jack Farrell
agreed. "The CIV office wants to
do this. The CIV office is not the
problem. The problem is the Fac
ulty Senate," he said.
Seaver, who has taught CIV for
10 years, agreed that CIV course
work tends to be somewhat below
the level at which most transfers
work. "My impression of those

cases is that I was rather wasting
their time," he said.
In addition, he noted that most
transfers are accustomed to com
menting on readings, and tend to
either dominate discussions or
remain silent lest they dominate
the freshmen.
But one CIV professor, who has
taught the class for about five
years, said transfers are "perfectly
fine in terms of relating to fresh
men .... It seemed to me they were
just about on the same level."
History Prof. David Kennedy
said he sympathized with transfer
students' desires to concentrate on
their majors and their greater lev
els of ability. But he said he
believed the CIV requirement
should stand.
"We as a faculty have expended
so much energy on this course . . .
just because we feel strongly that
it's an essential part of a Stanford
education," he said. Kennedy said
CIV is "in some ways the center
piece of the whole Stanford cur
riculum."
But Kennedy said some sort of
CIV section for transfers only, run
through the CIV office, might help
raise the academic level of the
class. However, he pointed out,
such a plan would likely cause
transfers scheduling problems.
Seaver seemed more optimistic
about reopening a dialogue on CIV
and transfers in the Senate.
"I would very much like to do
that, and I think a petition would
be very helpful" in showing stu
dent interest in changes, he said.
The transfers, meanwhile, hope
they will have their concerns
addressed.
"I agree with the CIV philoso
phy, the idea behind it, but I think
it should be modified to take into
account that we are not fresh
men," said Chris Johnson, a junior
transfer from UC-Berkeley. "We
are transfers. We deserve to be
treated a little more uniquely."
