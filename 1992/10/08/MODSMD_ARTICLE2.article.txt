# Transfers petition to have CIV waived
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Jumping into campus politics
after only a week of classes, four
transfer students are leading a pe
tition drive to have the Cultures,
Ideas and Values requirement
waived for transfers.
In doing so, they are reopening
a debate on whether transfer stu
dents should take CIV, a debate
that was closed only four months
ago when the Faculty Senate re
jected a proposal to alter the
course requirement for transfers.
According to Anthony Sabadi
ni, a sophomore transfer from
Colby College in Waterville,
Maine, the petitions "are basically
asking for the administration to
waive the CIV requirement . . .
when we only have three or, in
many cases, two years here, 15
units is a lot of time to sacrifice."
Sabadini said the group has al
ready collected 25 signatures, and
hopes to get more than 100 before
submitting the petitions to CIV of

ficials.
Transfer credit evaluator
Susan PfeifTer said there are 144
transfers, all of whom are re
quired to take CIV or fulfill the re
quirements with transfer credits.
But the latter option is rare, Pfeif
fer said, because few other schools
have courses similar to CIV.
Sabadini said he hoped that
after hearing the transfers' con
cerns, the University will "open
up a dialogue" with the students.
While he doesn't necessarily ex
pect the CIV requirement to be
waived completely, he said other
options more palatable to trans
fers are available.
"They have an accelerated
(Freshman) English quarter, why
don't they have an accelerated
CIV quarter for transfer stu
dents?" Sabadini said.
Such a solution, transfers say,
would solve another problem they
have with CIV â€” the introductory
level of the courses.
