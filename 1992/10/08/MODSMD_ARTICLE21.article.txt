## Deciding what's important 
### 
Sometimes on especially
warm evenings 1
take a card chair out under
the almond tree
and catching the last light, speak
to myself without
words. I try to catch what is
behind my throat. .. .
Philip Levine, "Silent in America "
A POEM, A POET: BOTH OFTEN
nothing more than lusterless pen
nies in the wide, feverish ocean
between California and Maine.
Probably next to none of us regularly
sit down in a card chair under a backyard
almond tree, but in these few lines the
poet has given us an image, a world, with
which all of us can most likely sympa
thize.
You remember or wish there had been
the time at a crowded party when you
walked outside to an icy moon, and sat
down alone on a broken couch, hidden
from others. And you loved it, the
silence, the struggle to make sense of it
all, all the nonsense falling around you
like rain.
Or the time last spring at your desk,
exams were imminent, and for five min
utes you wanted nothing for yourself but
failure, because only then would you be
able to articulate the two words that have
been wanting your voice all along: noth
ing matters.

But you know it matters. All of it. Or
at least that's what you're told by par
ents, friends, media. . . a conscience. And
it matters now especially, what with elec
tions and the real world (for some of us).
A big new era awaits just around the cor
ner for a generation of twentysomethings
who have been told to make a difference
— better the world — so that they might
give their children what has been given to
them, and more.
But what about the silence? Not near
ly from all of us, but enough to justify
consideration and awareness of the stam
mering quietude beneath the guise of
half-hearted answers to inquiries regard
ing choices for a president, job and future
that will take care of those we are respon
sible for, and empower those who will be
responsible for us.
What if you simply don't know? What
if you feel like many I have spoken with
recently, that your choice for president
will be the lesser of two evils, and your
choice for a job/future will be the greater
of two incomes? What if you believe more
and more in the importance of almond
trees and broken couches?
Believe it, at least for a few minutes
each day. Believe that your moments of
spiralling solitude are a testament to
some sort of faith in your destiny to live
and die on earth as a valid one because
you have no other choice, no alternative
to your strange existence.

The reality is that you probably will
cross the thresholds of poll booth cur
tains, office doors, and decisions which
grate daily against the personal gestation
you need and hope for, but think you'll
never have.
Art cries out against the country, the
world, for bringing all of us down, but
still you feel a subdued sense of dignity,
triumph, for enduring another day which
provided more questions, but still no
answers.
While others are singing, you know
you can only sing your way so far through
your silence. You would love to burn your
friend's resume, parents' advice, the very
system which you want and don't want to
be a part of.
But still, you know there are hillside
walks to be taken, mountain roads to be
driven, days to rise at dawn and strive
until dusk for your own wisdom, a few
words or more to wipe away confusion as
darkness wipes away the distance to
another tomorrow.
