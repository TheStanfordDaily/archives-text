Planned revival ofSWOPSI workshops for winter quarter

I WAS INSPIRED BY PRESIDENT
Casper's inauguration speech and
would like to make a few comments
on an important aspect of undergraduate
education that was cut last year, namely
Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues.
In his speech Casper outlined what he
sees as two, sometimes contradictory,
fundamental responsibilities of the uni
versity. On the one hand Stanford must
provide a forum removed from the daily
struggle for existence, and immune to
partisan interests in which a discussion
free of domination can take place.
On the other hand, those members of
the university whom society grants the
freedom necessary to reflect and do
research have an "obligation" to repay
society in some way. In other words the

university is "no Ivory tower."
SWOPSI provided a forum in which
both of these essential functions can be
fulfilled. Anyone who has sufficient
expertise and interest in a topic, who can
find a faculty sponsor, and whose course
proposal is approved by an academic
accreditation committee (which monitors
quality) can lead a SWOPSI workshop.
SWOPSI recognizes that professors
are not the only ones in the Stanford
community who have much to teach
undergraduates. In 1969 students
formed SWOPSI "to involve Stanford
students in actively seeking solutions to
urgent social and political problems."
The purpose of SWOPSI workshops has
been to reflect and do research upon a
pertinent issue, propose solutions, and,
when possible, to address the issue

directly through action.
In this sense, SWOPSI provides a vital
link between the university and its local,
regional and global environment, and
helps remedy the "ivory tower" syndrome.
As far as questioning established
orthodoxies, SWOPSI has in its 20 year
history consistently provided a forum for
alternative and innovative curriculum
and pedagogy, and has often played the
essential Socratic questioning role.
SWOPSI was in fact complicit in the
over-administration which has recently
plagued Stanford. Thus the recent bud
get cuts have forced those who believe
SWOPSI is an important part of under
graduate education and Stanford as a
whole to "get back to the basics" and to
reflect upon the purpose of alternative
education at Stanford.

We feel that SWOPSI is essential to
Stanford as a public institution and that
it also makes an important contribution
to undergraduate education. Therefore
we are working to reestablish a stream
lined, student-run, independent program
winter quarter.
We hope to continue the 20 year lega
cy of students who have actively sought
to utilize the resources of the Stanford
community to understand and propose
solutions to the problems of their day.
We encourage students who have bene
fitted from SWOPSI in the past and those
who would like to benefit from it in the
future to join us. The need for alternative
education as Stanford is as urgent as ever.
