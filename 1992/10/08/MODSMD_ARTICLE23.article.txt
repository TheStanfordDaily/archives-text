# Campus phone service charges aren't rip-offs
## 
### 
I received a phone call from the Daily
requesting information on the telephone
service profile and the $33 activation fee
for students.
The editorial in the Oct. 7th Daily,
especially the headline, misrepresents
our discussion, and it is important that
all students understand what makes up
the activation charge.
The rates for student phone service
are based solely on the actual costs for
providing service, as Communication
Services is a government regulated
break-even organization (non-profit).
There are a number of costs associat
ed with providing phone service to the
students every year — continued amorti
zation of the telephone equipment,
maintenance and repair, record keeping,
billing and staff effort throughout the
year at Forsythe and at Tresidder, etc.
These costs could be billed in a num

ber of ways. The alternatives posed to
the Housing Operations Advisory Group
(HOAG) made up of students, and
Telecommunications Advisory Group
(TAG) made up of faculty and students
back in 1989 were to either lump-sum
at the beginning of the year, quarterly
and monthly billings with no installa
tion charge, or adopt a Pacific Bell-type
policy.
There was unanimous consent that
billing as Pacific Bell does was the best
solution for two reasons. First, it allo
cates costs in a way that students are
used to. Second, it allows students to
compare Stanford charges against Pacif
ic Bell's quickly and easily.
The current activation charges for
Pacific Bell are $34.75 and $13.25
monthly. Stanford charges $33.00 and
$11.00 respectively.
I can't stress enough that the Univer
sity is not in the phone business to make
a profit, but to provide reasonably-priced
phone service, and long distance service
that results in lower calling charges for
most students.

As demonstrated over the past two
years, when we surpass our service volume
expectations, we pass on our savings to our
clients. The average rebate given to each
student in May of this year was $28.50.
Activating dial tone prior to under
graduates arriving in fall is a major effort
and is not as simple as flipping a switch.
The same friendly staff who helps stu
dents all day has also been here every
night into the late hours — before, during
and after the subscription period — so
that students would not have to wait sev
eral days to get their telephone service.
Communication Services makes this
effort to provide students with immedi
ate access to telephone service. In addi
tion, during each summer, work is done
in student housing to provide upgraded
wiring and services. Upgrades to the
phone system over the summer also
enables us to offer students new features
and services upon their arrival in the fall.
I appreciate the inquiry by the Daily,
though I felt it was necessary to ensure
that students clearly understood that
our rates are our true costs and not arbi

trarily set to recover dollars from stu
dent coffers.
The intent of our very dedicated staff
is to provide a service profile that bene
fits the students at this institution.
