## Wolf Wigo snares steady diet of dunking donuts 
### Quinn Moo Staff writer 
Water polo player Wolf Wigo
likes his donuts wet, if he can get
them. Not the sofl, oh-so-fatten
ing sugary kind you see police offi
cers merrily munching, but
rather wet, and soggy. Unfortu
nately, no one sells them. So
Wigo, Stanford's leading scorer,
must get them himself.
"I like to shoot right over the
goalie's head," Wigo explains.
"He'll raise his arms [to guard the
goal], miss and form a donut with
his arms and shoulders. A good
donut makes the goalies look bad."
Though Wigo rarely samples
that sweet taste of a donut, he
finds other ways to put the ball in
the cage. Halfway through the
1992 campaign, Wigo has tallied
25 scores, on a pace to eclipse the
46 goals he sank as a freshman
starter last season.
"Very few freshmen have ever
started at Stanford," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "He's
got a knack for putting the ball in
the goal."
Though Wigo will not come
close to the Stanford single-sea
son record of 82 goals, he leads a
balanced scoring offense that
averages over 11 goals per game.
The fact is, Wigo likes to shoot.
He volunteers for the penalty
shots, while most players, Coach
Dettamanti says, would shrink
from it.
"I like the pressure," Wigo
said. "If it's close, I'd rather be
the deciding factor than rely on
someone else. Also, it gets me into
the flow if I haven't scored yet."
Wigo likens his style to that of
a point guard: slashing and driv
ing towards the cage. His headsy
demeanor fits Dettamanti's run
and-gun philosophy.

"We emphasize the fast-break
more than any other team .. . tra
ditionally we haven't had much
size," Dettamanti said.
At 6-foot-2 and 180 lbs, Wigo is
no one to push around. Teams
usually assign their team thug to
guard Wigo. On the surface, the
thug masks his intentions.
Beneath the water, away from the
referee's vision, Wigo is kicked,
grabbed, and kneed. But he
expects such abuse, and almost
welcomes these underwater mug
gings. But maybe it's because
Wigo's from New York.
"He knows how to handle him
self in the water," Dettamanti
said. "He has that New York City
street attitude, and he doesn't
take crap from anybody."
Wigo admits that he retaliates
often and quickly, but is careful not
to be ejected from the game. Yet
Wigo reralls an incident in Germany
in which he couldn't retaliate.
"I drove past my guy and scored,
and when I swam past him again,
he reached under, grabbed my balls
and said, 'Don't do that again,' in
broken English," Wigo winced. "I
swam to the side of the pool,
climbed out and laid on my back.
"It felt like he knocked the
wind out of me. I kicked my knees
up. I didn't even think about hit
ting him, because he was this 6-
foot-7, cut-everywhere German.
If I had hit him, it probably
wouldn't have hurt," he said.
"I didn't score on him again,"
Wigo added.
Though Wigo hasn't suffered
such a brutal attack in the States,
he still attracts plenty of physical
contact. He says, "if anyone is
going to get into a scrap during a
game, odds are it'll be me."
Wigo attributes his scrappiness
to playing with the rough-and
tumble New York Athletic Club, a

collection of older, wiser and
huskier players. Wigo's high
school alma mater, Bronx Sci
ence, had plenty of biology labs,
but it didn't have a pool.
New York is not exactly a
hotbed of high school water polo
talent, in general. Nevertheless,
Wigo managed to attract attention
during summers in California.
To play with others his own
age, he arranged to play summer
club games with the El Dorado
High School team in Placentia to

keep sharp and adapt to the
tougher competition on the West
Coast. He later travelled with club
teams to summer tournaments in
Southern California, and served
notice to college coaches that he
was hot property.
"I first noticed Wolf in the 1989
U.S. Summer National Club
Championships," Coach Detta
manti said. "We [Stanford club
team | beat this team from Annapo
lis 15-3, but this high school kid
scored all three goals against us."

Of course, that young gun was
Wigo. When colleges began to
recruit Wigo during his senior year,
he narrowed his choices to a field of
seven, but he chose Stanford
because "it was the best program at
the time, and I liked the aca
demics." Wigo said he will most
likely major in engineering.
The rigors of college practices
and an extended season surprised
Wigo last year. Accustomed to play
ing 13-game club seasons before
coming to Stanford, Wigo started

26 games in 1991 for the Cardinal.
His scoring decreased at the
end of the season, a crucial period
for NCAA Championship seed
ings. Also, both Wigo and Coach
Dettamanti agree that he must
improve on defense.
Assistant coach Ben Quittner
stressed consistency: "He needs to
come through in the real big
games, and needs to execute what
the coach says. The physical talent
is there — he just needs time."
And more donuts.

At 6-foot-2 and 180 lbs, Wigo is
no one to push around. Teams
usually assign their team thug to
guard Wigo. On the surface, the
thug masks his intentions.
Beneath the water, away from the
referee's vision, Wigo is kicked,
grabbed, and kneed. But he
expects such abuse, and almost
welcomes these underwater mug
gings. But maybe it's because
Wigo's from New York.
"He knows how to handle him
self in the water," Dettamanti
said. "He has that New York City
street attitude, and he doesn't
take crap from anybody."
Wigo admits that he retaliates
often and quickly, but is careful not
to be ejected from the game. Yet
Wigo reralls an incident in Germany
in which he couldn't retaliate.
"I drove past my guy and scored,
and when I swam past him again,
he reached under, grabbed my balls
and said, 'Don't do that again,' in
broken English," Wigo winced. "I
swam to the side of the pool,
climbed out and laid on my back.
"It felt like he knocked the
wind out of me. I kicked my knees
up. I didn't even think about hit
ting him, because he was this 6-
foot-7, cut-everywhere German.
If I had hit him, it probably
wouldn't have hurt," he said.
"I didn't score on him again,"
Wigo added.
Though Wigo hasn't suffered
such a brutal attack in the States,
he still attracts plenty of physical
contact. He says, "if anyone is
going to get into a scrap during a
game, odds are it'll be me."
Wigo attributes his scrappiness
to playing with the rough-and
tumble New York Athletic Club, a

collection of older, wiser and
huskier players. Wigo's high
school alma mater, Bronx Sci
ence, had plenty of biology labs,
but it didn't have a pool.
New York is not exactly a
hotbed of high school water polo
talent, in general. Nevertheless,
Wigo managed to attract attention
during summers in California.
To play with others his own
age, he arranged to play summer
club games with the El Dorado
High School team in Placentia to

keep sharp and adapt to the
tougher competition on the West
Coast. He later travelled with club
teams to summer tournaments in
Southern California, and served
notice to college coaches that he
was hot property.
"I first noticed Wolf in the 1989
U.S. Summer National Club
Championships," Coach Detta
manti said. "We [Stanford club
team | beat this team from Annapo
lis 15-3, but this high school kid
scored all three goals against us."

Of course, that young gun was
Wigo. When colleges began to
recruit Wigo during his senior year,
he narrowed his choices to a field of
seven, but he chose Stanford
because "it was the best program at
the time, and I liked the aca
demics." Wigo said he will most
likely major in engineering.
The rigors of college practices
and an extended season surprised
Wigo last year. Accustomed to play
ing 13-game club seasons before
coming to Stanford, Wigo started

26 games in 1991 for the Cardinal.
His scoring decreased at the
end of the season, a crucial period
for NCAA Championship seed
ings. Also, both Wigo and Coach
Dettamanti agree that he must
improve on defense.
Assistant coach Ben Quittner
stressed consistency: "He needs to
come through in the real big
games, and needs to execute what
the coach says. The physical talent
is there — he just needs time."
And more donuts.


Burt Herman — Daily
Water Polo's leading scorer, sophomore Wolf Wigo hopes to lead Stanford to two victories this weekend as the Cardinal heads down south
to face USC and UCLA.
Water polo player Wolf Wigo
likes his donuts wet, if he can get
them. Not the sofl, oh-so-fatten
ing sugary kind you see police offi
cers merrily munching, but
rather wet, and soggy. Unfortu
nately, no one sells them. So
Wigo, Stanford's leading scorer,
must get them himself.
"I like to shoot right over the
goalie's head," Wigo explains.
"He'll raise his arms [to guard the
goal], miss and form a donut with
his arms and shoulders. A good
donut makes the goalies look bad."
Though Wigo rarely samples
that sweet taste of a donut, he
finds other ways to put the ball in
the cage. Halfway through the
1992 campaign, Wigo has tallied
25 scores, on a pace to eclipse the
46 goals he sank as a freshman
starter last season.
"Very few freshmen have ever
started at Stanford," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "He's
got a knack for putting the ball in
the goal."
Though Wigo will not come
close to the Stanford single-sea
son record of 82 goals, he leads a
balanced scoring offense that
averages over 11 goals per game.
The fact is, Wigo likes to shoot.
He volunteers for the penalty
shots, while most players, Coach
Dettamanti says, would shrink
from it.
"I like the pressure," Wigo
said. "If it's close, I'd rather be
the deciding factor than rely on
someone else. Also, it gets me into
the flow if I haven't scored yet."
Wigo likens his style to that of
a point guard: slashing and driv
ing towards the cage. His headsy
demeanor fits Dettamanti's run
and-gun philosophy.

"We emphasize the fast-break
more than any other team .. . tra
ditionally we haven't had much
size," Dettamanti said.
At 6-foot-2 and 180 lbs, Wigo is
no one to push around. Teams
