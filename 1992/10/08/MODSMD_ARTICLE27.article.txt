# Olympic star Timmons makes Stanford promo
## 
### Mike Payne 
Three-time U.S. Olympic vol
leyball star Steve Timmons
stopped by the Stanford book
store yesterday to sign auto
graphs, promote Evian spring
water and talk volleyball. The
red-headed outside hitter, who
some consider to be the best in
the world, signed autographs for
about two hours to the delight of
passer-by volleyball fans.
Although the event was not
well publicized, the line grew to as
many as thirty people. Timmons,
known for his carrot-red flattop
and charisma on the court, seems
to attract attention wherever he
S oes - .. .
He visited Berkeley earlier in
the day, where he was mobbed by
a crowd of enthusiastic students.
"They sort of circled around me
and crushed in," Timmons said
wryly. Ntvdless to say, he was
impressed by the peaceful atmo
sphere and friendly treatment he
received at Stanford.
Contrary to popular belief,
Timmons, a three-time Olympian
and two-time gold medalist, fore
sees a good deal more volleyball in
his future, including upcoming
play with the national team.
"Next week, we leave for a two
week tour of Japan, after which
we'll return for an exhibition tour
through many major U.S. cities,
Timmons said.
After he finishes those tours,
Timmons will take a couple of
months off to recover and get in
shape for next summer's Pro
Beach tour.
"I've been playing for three
years straight, with the national
"team and then the Olympic team,
so I have a few aches and pains,
Timmons said. At age 33, he will
have to be at his best to contend
with the younger teams on the
beach tour, such as Sif\jin Smith

and Randy Stoklos, as well as for
mer Olympic teammate Karch
Kiraly and Kent Steffes, the most
prolific pair this summer.
"I'm going to be giving Adam
Johnson and Brian Lewis a call to
see what they're up to, and see if
they're interested in playing with
me," Timmons said.
When Timmons looks to the
future, he gives little chance of
another Olympic return, citing
his age as the obstacle. "At thirty
seven you just can't take the
jumping and running everyday as
well as you can when you're 24,"
he said.
He does have high hopes for
future U.S. Olympic teams, how
ever, partly because of the poten
tial of Stanford sophomore volley
ball star Canyon Ceman.
"I look to Bob Samuelson and
Brian Ivie to carry a lot of weight
in 1996, but Canyon could be a
real athletic force. He's big, fast,
and smart. Coach Stern (U.S.
Olympic coach and former Stan
ford coach) is expecting big things
from him," Timmons said.
Once active volleyball ends for
Timmons, he will devote most of
his time to his sportswear compa
ny, Redsand. Started in 1985,
Redsand boasted meager gross
profits of $600,000 in 1987, but
Timmons expects its sales will be
at about $12 million in the com
ing year, with sales picking up
internationally in countries such
as Japan, Italy, Germany and
Canada.
He also hopes to start a volley
ball academy in the Bay Area.
"There will be beach courts,
indoor courts, weight training,
and more," said Timmons who
hopes to eventually make volley
ball a more popular sport world
wide. "It will be a year-round
operation, and hopefully we can
expand it nationally and then
internationally."
