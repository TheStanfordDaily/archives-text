# Eiser's Major League pick: The Pirates
## 
### 
It's October. It's a time for enjoying the still
warm weather (California only), viewing presi
dential debates (leap years only), and taking in
the splendor of collegiate and professional foot
ball (addicts only).
Yet the 10th month of the year offers a lot
more to the sports-minded public than an
opportunity to see if the previous year's jeans
still fit, if candidates will actually say some
thing if given 90 minutes or, if it's possible,
given the marvels of network and cable TV, to
inundate oneself with constant gridiron action
from Thursday to Monday.
No, when October rolls around, there should
be but one thing that truly grips the hearts of
America: baseball.
This year, the Grand Old Game has graced
us with the prospect of its best postseason com
petition ever. Included in the four-team field
are three repeat division winners, who have
proven that excellence can be sustained in an
era of free agency and skyrocketing salaries.
The fourth team, the Oakland Athletics, is
returning to the playoffs after a quadrennial
hiatus in deference to that pesky team from
Minnesota (who, rest assured, will re-sign
Kirby and use that Kaiser Roll Dome to its
advantage again in 1995).
The 1992 playoffs are truly too close to call,
not only because of the unpredictability of base
ball in general, but specifically because there are
no surprise entries this time around (don't tell
Street and Smith's, Chicago White Sox lovers
that they are, though). The game's four most
talented teams will be playing in the "second
season" in search of a berth in the Fall Classic.
Everybody has an opinion as to the outcome:
there are the tomahawk-choppers, who feel the
Atlanta Braves deserve the championship to
which they came so tantalizingly close in 1991;
the local Stanford-area natives, who will cling
to their aging A's through thick and thin; and
the internationalists, who see the need for

Canada's Toronto Bluejays, to put the "World"
into the Series afler lo these many years.
However, the sentimental nod here goes to a
team that has made winning so commonplace
over the last three seasons that it has virtually
played itself into anonymity, a team that lacks
the flair, the funds, or the fan base to buy its
way into the American consciousness, yet has a
lovable quality that is hard to ignore.
The Pittsburgh Pirates may not have a
superstation on which to showcase themselves

on a daily basis. They may not have a manager
who prepares meticulous notes and runs the
game from a computer, and they may not have
a dome that constitutes a mini-city. They just
go out and play the game the old-fashioned
way, as a selfless unit that cannot be denied.
Consider: after the Pirates won the 1979
World Series with the Pointer Sisters' "We Are
Family" as their unofficial theme song, for the
entire 1980's, the word "Pittsburgh" —
whether used in reference to the Steelers, Pen
guins, or Pirates — elicited the same kind of
laughter that "Cleveland" does in the '90s.
Now, a refreshing change has taken hold in the
Keystone State — the Steelers have gained
back a modicum of respectability, the Penguins
have won back-to-back Stanley Cups, and the
Pirates have taken three straight National
League East titles.

The Pirates are survivors. Bobby Bonilla,
their best player from the 1990 and 4 91 sea
sons, is now with the New York Mets. John
Smiley, a 20-game winner a year ago, is now a
Minnesota Twin. Carl Barger, their erstwhile
president, is guiding the Florida Marlins
through their early mediocrity. And Barry
Bonds, the heart and soul of the team, has
played this entire season under the specter of
knowing that this is his last year in a Pirate
uniform. Somehow, the Pirates get by.
This summer, I wasn't sure who I would
cheer on when baseball's postseason began —
after all, the blood in my veins runs True
Dodger Blue, and, well, stuff happens. Then the
last week of August brought with it the Sept. 1
playoff roster deadline, and the other three
division winners made my decision easy. First,
there was the trade in which JefT Reardon, the
major league recordholder for career saves,
went from the Boston Red Sox to the Braves in
exchange for minor league prospects.
Then there was the David Cone deal, in
which the ace of the New York Mets' pitching
staff was plucked by the Bluejays for the base
ball equivalent of "$24 and trinkets," an
unproven minor league shortstop.
Finally, there was the infamous Jose Canseco
swap between the A's and the Texas Rangers;
this will always remain an inexplicable mystery
to me because a team just doesn't trade away
someone with the star quality of Jose, no matter
how many speeding tickets he has (remember
how Rickey Henderson was once the goat for
asking for a mere percentage of Canseco's salary
at the outset of the 1991 season?).
The Pirates offer us a way out of this "steal
from the poor to feed the rich," mercenary atti
tude employed by other successful franchises.
Their best pitcher, Tim Wakefield, is a knuck
leballer who started his season in the minor
