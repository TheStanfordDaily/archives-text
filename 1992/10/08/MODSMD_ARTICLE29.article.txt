# Cardinal tees off with sixth-place finish
## 
### SooSang Park 
The Stanford men's golf team opened its fall
season this week at the Mass Mutual/Husky
Men's Golf Classic, hosted by the University of
Washington. Sophomore Steve Burdick won
the individual title and the Cardinal came in
sixth overall at the Broadmoor Country Club
of Seattle, a par 70, 6180-yard course.
Out of a field of 11 teams, USC's squad
took first place with a team total of 872
strokes. Kansas came in second with 876, and
Oregon State placed third with 877.
The Stanford men finished with a team
score of 889, good enough to put them in a tie
for sixth place, after winning the tournament
last year.
Three full rounds were played in the com
petition, starting out with 36 holes on Monday
and 18 on Tuesday. Although the weather was
somewhat rainy and cold early on, the condi
tions were excellent for the final round. Senior
Dave Rutkowski was joined by sophomores
Steve Burdick, .Jerry Chang, and Darren
Dragovich. Freshman Pete Ligotti rounded
out the five-man squad.
Despite winning the tournament last year,
Stanford's team is relatively inexperienced
this season. Not only does the team include
four sophomores and three freshmen, but also
two of its best players are red-shirting this
season. Junior All-Americans Notah Begay
and Casey Martin, who were ranked No. 6 and

16 in the nation respectively are sitting out
this year in an effort to make a run for the
NCAA title during the 1994-95 season.
The Cardinal's total of 286 during Tuesday's
round was the second-lowest score for any one
round made by a team throughout the tourna
ment. Coach Goodwin expressed particular
pleasure in the team's final round performance,
since last year the team established a goal for
this fall season "to be tough on the last day."
Each tournament during this season, coach
Goodwin said he expects to field a team of
sophomores and freshmen, joined by one
senior. The men's squad is nine-players
strong, but Goodwin wants to provide tourna
ment experience for his younger golfers.
Commenting on the team as a whole,
promising newcomer Ligotti stated, "We're
quite a young team, and we actually have a lot
to prove." The admittedly nervous freshman,
competing in his first first collegiate tourna
ment, shot a 79 and 80 on the first day but
rebounded to finish strong with a 73.
But the star of the team was sophomore
Steve Burdick, who shot a tournament-best
213 to notch the very first win of his collegiate
career. Going into the final round, Burdick
was only four shots off the pace but expressed
surprise at his first tournament win.
"I didn't expect to win this early (in my
careerl," Burdick said.
Burdick shot rounds of 72 and 73 on the
first day but finished on a high note with a 68

in the final round. The sophomore edged out
Brad Bruno of Kansas and Spencer Leu of
Washington, both of whom also shot a com
petitive 68 in the third round but finished
with final scores of 214.
Burdick began the final round strong by end
ing the front nine holes two under par, but felt
that he might have started to slip when he
scored a double bogey on the 10th. But the even
tual winner kept his poise and finished m spec
tacular fashion by scoring an eagle on the 18th.
The pressure was on Burdick on the last
hole since Spencer Leu — one of Burdick's
playing partners for the day — had also eagled
the final hole. Although at the time Burdick
didn't realize he was in contention to win it
all, he knew he had to eagle to beat his com
petitor. From approximately 227 yards out,
the Stanford sophomore hit a 1-iron and laid
the ball down just five feet from the hole He
then calmly sunk the putt for the clincher.
"The greens were really fast, and it was
easy to make bogeys," said the champion "We
needed to play the par-five's well, and I did,
getting two birdies and an eagle."
The win seems to be the payoff for much
hard work Burdick had spent much of his
summer honing his game. His previous best
showing in an event was 13th place last season.
And although this is a youthful team in a
building year, with talents like Burdick, Coach
Goodwin expressed enthusiasm and expecta
tion as he proclaimed "a great era to come."

showing in an event was 13th place last season.
And although this is a youthful team in a
building year, with talents like Burdick, Coach
Goodwin expressed enthusiasm and expecta
tion as he proclaimed "a great era to come."
The Stanford men's golf team opened its fall
season this week at the Mass Mutual/Husky
Men's Golf Classic, hosted by the University of
Washington. Sophomore Steve Burdick won
the individual title and the Cardinal came in
sixth overall at the Broadmoor Country Club
of Seattle, a par 70, 6180-yard course.
Out of a field of 11 teams, USC's squad
took first place with a team total of 872
strokes. Kansas came in second with 876, and
Oregon State placed third with 877.
The Stanford men finished with a team
score of 889, good enough to put them in a tie
for sixth place, after winning the tournament
last year.
Three full rounds were played in the com
petition, starting out with 36 holes on Monday
and 18 on Tuesday. Although the weather was
somewhat rainy and cold early on, the condi
tions were excellent for the final round. Senior
Dave Rutkowski was joined by sophomores
Steve Burdick, .Jerry Chang, and Darren
Dragovich. Freshman Pete Ligotti rounded
out the five-man squad.
Despite winning the tournament last year,
Stanford's team is relatively inexperienced
this season. Not only does the team include
four sophomores and three freshmen, but also
two of its best players are red-shirting this
season. Junior All-Americans Notah Begay
and Casey Martin, who were ranked No. 6 and

16 in the nation respectively are sitting out
this year in an effort to make a run for the
NCAA title during the 1994-95 season.
The Cardinal's total of 286 during Tuesday's
round was the second-lowest score for any one
round made by a team throughout the tourna
ment. Coach Goodwin expressed particular
pleasure in the team's final round performance,
since last year the team established a goal for
this fall season "to be tough on the last day."
Each tournament during this season, coach
Goodwin said he expects to field a team of
sophomores and freshmen, joined by one
senior. The men's squad is nine-players
strong, but Goodwin wants to provide tourna
ment experience for his younger golfers.
Commenting on the team as a whole,
promising newcomer Ligotti stated, "We're
quite a young team, and we actually have a lot
to prove." The admittedly nervous freshman,
competing in his first first collegiate tourna
ment, shot a 79 and 80 on the first day but
rebounded to finish strong with a 73.
But the star of the team was sophomore
Steve Burdick, who shot a tournament-best
213 to notch the very first win of his collegiate
career. Going into the final round, Burdick
was only four shots off the pace but expressed
surprise at his first tournament win.
"I didn't expect to win this early (in my
careerl," Burdick said.
Burdick shot rounds of 72 and 73 on the
first day but finished on a high note with a 68

in the final round. The sophomore edged out
Brad Bruno of Kansas and Spencer Leu of
Washington, both of whom also shot a com
petitive 68 in the third round but finished
with final scores of 214.
Burdick began the final round strong by end
ing the front nine holes two under par, but felt
that he might have started to slip when he
scored a double bogey on the 10th. But the even
tual winner kept his poise and finished m spec
tacular fashion by scoring an eagle on the 18th.
The pressure was on Burdick on the last
hole since Spencer Leu — one of Burdick's
playing partners for the day — had also eagled
the final hole. Although at the time Burdick
didn't realize he was in contention to win it
all, he knew he had to eagle to beat his com
petitor. From approximately 227 yards out,
the Stanford sophomore hit a 1-iron and laid
the ball down just five feet from the hole He
then calmly sunk the putt for the clincher.
"The greens were really fast, and it was
easy to make bogeys," said the champion "We
needed to play the par-five's well, and I did,
getting two birdies and an eagle."
The win seems to be the payoff for much
hard work Burdick had spent much of his
summer honing his game. His previous best
showing in an event was 13th place last season.
And although this is a youthful team in a
building year, with talents like Burdick, Coach
Goodwin expressed enthusiasm and expecta
tion as he proclaimed "a great era to come."
