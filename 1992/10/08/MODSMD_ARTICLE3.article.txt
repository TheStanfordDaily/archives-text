# Stanford hosts 'World News'
## Jennings focuses on electronics industry 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Peter Jennings reported live from Memori
al Court yesterday, bantering with an audi
ence of about 100 students between segments
of ABC's "World News Tonight."
"Good evening from the campus of Stan
ford University," he began the 3:30 p.m. show.
"To be at one of the finest universities in the
country is to be reminded that this is where
the technological revolution in Silicon Valley
was born three decades ago."
After several other reports, Jennings intro
duced a segment on American competitiveness
focusing on the Bay Area's computer and elec
tronics industry.
"It was from Stanford that the first comput
er wonks, as they were proud to be called, went
on to create hundreds of new technologies in
Silicon Valley," he told a national audience as
people walked or rode bicycles behind him.
The news program, which reaches an esti
mated 15 to 20 million people, opened and
closed with aerial shots of the University. "It's
terrific PR for Stanford, and it's well-de
served," said Jack Hubbard, associate director
of Stanford News Service.
Hubbard, who helped coordinate the broad
cast, was a producer for CBS News before com
ing to Stanford.
Jennings arrived at about 3 p.m., a half
hour before the show was set to broadcast live
to the East Coast. He practiced several times
before the TelePrompTer, correcting a few
mistakes in the script, as he waited.
"We're not accustomed to having an audi
ence," he told the students who crowded
around the equipment but stayed just out of
camera range.
Jennings explained that there would be

Curious Stanford students stare as Peter Jennings oversees the "World News Tonight'
long silences as pre-taped seg
ments aired. "We will probably
puzzle you when we go on the air."
After introducing several news
items, he watched them on the TV
monitor in front of him and often
made comments to the gathered
students.
The crowd was silent during
the countdowns and Jennings'
introductions, even waiting a few
moments to laugh after an item
on Vice President Dan Quayle's
claim that people "can say good

bye to water and to food" if envi
ronmentalists have their way.
"I was most impressed by the
Stanford group," Hubbard said.
"I hope they had as much fun as I
did."
Almost a dozen students hold
ing Clinton/Gore signs showed up
for the broadcast. A few of them
tried to stand in the background
with the placards until ABC News
spokesman Arnot Walker asked
them to stop, prompting Jennings
to call the others "the polite Clin
ton/Gore people" after the show.
The students walking and bicy
cling in the background during
the broadcast were welcome,
according to ABC Operations

Manager Bert Tapia. "We need it
to look like a university," he said.
But the show's director in New
York, hearing the comment over a
satellite feed, jokingly asked that
students be told, "If they are
going to streak, to do it very fast."
And Jennings had a request as
well. "If any of you want to wave to
your mother, please resist," he said.
Autograph-seeking audience
members flocked around the news
anchor after the show ended. For
a woman who helped the crew
spell "jeopardy" on the script,
Jennings signed Quayle's name.
"He is the speller, not me," he
said.
Jennings also sent a staffer to

the Stanford Bookstore for sou
venirs of his visit: clothes for his
two children. "I'm not allowed to
come back without shirts," he said.
The ABC News team had hoped
Jennings could meet with Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper,
but Hubbard said a scheduling
problem stood in the way.
First-year graduate student
Corey Olds, who watched the
broadcast, said he believes the
show could be positive for the
University.
"People could read it as a sign
of Stanford trying to reassert
itself," he said. "This will particu
larly please the people in the pub
lic relations office."
