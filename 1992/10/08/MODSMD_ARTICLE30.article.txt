# Behind the scenes: 'World News' at Farm
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
For Bert Tapia and the rest of the ABC Net
work News crew, yesterday was just another
workday.
Peter Jennings, anchorman for ABC
"World News Tonight," was reporting live
from Memorial Court in the Quad, and it was
their job to make him look good, according to
Tapia, the show's broadcast operations and
engineering manager.
Making anyone "look good" for the camera
is a more difficult task than one might imag
ine from watching the final product. Several
crews assist each other in producing the final
product: a 30-minute news show.
Yesterday, a crew in San Jose taped sepa
rate segments of the show before Jennings
even appeared on campus, and both the Stan
ford site and the San Jose site transmitted via
satellite to a third crew in New York City,
which integrated all of the material.
Producers in New York simply pushed a
button, and they could speak to Jennings or
anyone else on the set. Interrupted feedback
allowed Jennings to hear everything going on
the show except for himself on delay.
Two monitors positioned next to the cam
eras displayed both Jennings as he stood on
the grass, and the total show as the nation saw
it.
Scripts faxed to the crew were typed into a
computer on-line with the TelePrompTer as
soon as they came in. Doug Jackson, a worker
for Q-TV — a TelePrompTer service based in
Los Angeles and subcontracted by ABC —
typed in the scripts and followed Jennings'
speech, speeding up or slowing down the
prompter if necessary.
Jackson also typed in any changes made by
New York producers, the on-location produc
ers or Jennings himself.
"Peter does a lot of it," Jackson said. "If he

drops, he'll pick it right back up," Jackson
remarked admiringly of Jennings' talent.
"He'll edit as he's talking."
Jackson added that since he normally
doesn't prompt for live shows, the fast pace
causes "a lot of anxieties and a tremendous
amount of tension."
At 2:30 pm, the first sheet of the script
arrived on the fax machine, and the fast pace
Jackson spoke of began to kick in.
"Here comes the first one," Tapia shouted,
running over to retrieve it from the machine.
He handed the sheets to Jackson, and Jack
son's fingers furiously punched the appropri
ate keys.
Lighting director Gary McClendon moved
reflectors and silks — large silk screens used
to diffuse harsh light — as the shadows creat
ed by the changing afternoon sun crept up on
the set.
Cameraman Minh Van Dang repositioned
his lens and adjusted the height of the tripod
as everyone from gaffers to passers-by stood in
front of the camera for him, pretending to be
Jennings. McClendon watched how the light
ing played off people's faces differently accord
ing to their complexions and how deep-set
their eyes were.
Student gaffer Matthew Kulikowski
fetched sandbags, lifted equipment and point
ed out the Poli Sci Cafe for a crew member in
search of a candy bar.
As more of the script poured from the fax
machine, another student assistant, Kim
McCreery, made phone calls and refilled the
cooler with Coke and bottled water.
Meanwhile, four students — realizing they
would catch a glimpse of Jennings if they hung
around — sat under the arches behind the
crew and, while they waited, pulled out every
thing from calculus problem sets to "The
Aeneid."
After Jennings arrived on the set, the crowd
quickly multiplied from a small handful to

nearly 100 onlookers. Jennings, surprisingly
approachable and very friendly, spoke to most
of the crew before taking his position on the set.
As Jennings stood over the tape — careful
ly placed long before he arrived — which
marked where he should stand, someone
asked Jennings, "Where would you feel com
fortable?"
"Somewhere I could see," quipped Jen
nings matter-of-factly.
The crew responded quickly by moving the
tape, readjusting the position of the camera,
and placing a grey screen above the silk over
Jennings' head. Someone handed him the lat
est script and Jennings called out to Jackson,
"Doug, why don't you go to the top and I'll
proofread."
Jennings read aloud like an accomplished
speed reader, alerting Jackson of typographi
cal errors and mistakes.
All of the crew members performed their
jobs with a misleading calm, each man and
woman concentrating on the task at hand.
Shortly before he went on the air, Jennings
confessed that the unusual presence of a large
audience made him nervous. He then
explained just how a live broadcast works.
The crowd reacted like obedient children
and all remained silent during the taping.
Next came the countdown, and Jennings hit
the airwaves.
Murmurs from "much less glamorous" to
"How are they going to prevent people from just
walking across?" swept through the audience.
But after the broadcast, everyone applaud
ed Jennings on a job well done. Jennings
responded by remaining a while to field ques
tions and sign autographs.
Tapia admitted that there is no real way to
tell how the taping turned out on the set,
adding that from his vantage point it looked
and sounded good. "If there are any mis
takes," he said, "we'll correct them in the sec
ond half-hour."
