I Prefer Not to Keep Promises?
Last spring's victorious "I Prefer Not to
have a COP" Council of Presidents slate has
apparently reneged on a promise to create a
community center for Disabled Students at
Stanford, prolonging the group's several-year
search for a home.
"It's hard to build a community without a
place to build it in," said Mark Briemhorst, a
fifth-year coterminal student who is disabled.
Last year, Briemhorst said newly elected COP
member Ed Mun promised the old COP office to
the group, since his slate would not take office.

However, the ASSU Senate and Financial
Aid Advocacy Office moved into the space over
the summer and reorganized their old office in
the lobby.
"We don't know that it was Ed's space to
promise," Graduate Senator Derek Miyahara
explained. "It wasn't an ASSU decision. It was
mostly Ed (Mun) just talking. We just heard
rumors about it."
Mun has graduated, and Miyahara said the
senate has not heard from him since.
Although he and other members sometimes
"hang out in the DRC office," he said it is dif
ficult to foster a social environment while peo
ple are working.
Briemhorst said he met with Nancy Howe,

ASSU advisor, to discuss the need for a com
munity center for the group.
"I've been bitching about this for three
years and this is the first she had heard of it,"
Briemhorst said.
He said possible locations have been pro
posed, such as the Fire Truck House.
However, Briemhorst said his ideal center
would be located in"the classroom in Meyer
(Library) right next to the DRC.
"The students could come into the DRC for
services, and then the community center would
be right there so they could stop in,"he said.
Briemhorst added that he has "spent many
nights in the DRC and observed that the class
room is hardly used."
