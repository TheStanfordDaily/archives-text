A traditional vision
of the New World:
1492 pleases some
One of the advantages of film is its capabili
ty to capture a complex idea in a single image.
In Ridley Scott's new film, "1492: The Con
quest of Paradise," the image is the shore of the
New World.
The image first appears almost exactly in the
middle of the film's narrative, when Columbus'
men are at the point of mutiny. Columbus
senses the ships are finally nearing land and
stares out into a heavy fog. Suddenly, the fog
clears and, almost magically, a densely forested
horizon takes its place.
Though we are taught from first grade about
Columbus' arrival, it is an almost impossible
stretch of the imagination to picture what the
Europeans saw when they found their New
World. The attempt in "1492" to bring this
image to life for the 20th-century viewer is one
of the triumphs of this visually beautiful film.
However, the recent debate over the impact
of Columbus' voyages brings more complicat
ed issues into play. The "paradise" that the film
portrays immediately brings up the question of
responsibility for what that paradise has be
come.
"1492: The Conquest of Paradise" focuses
on the figure of Columbus himself (Gerard De
pardieu) and in doing so repeats some of the
unrevised theories of the discovery of the New
World, including giving Columbus indirect
credit for the realization that the world is
round.
The Columbus of "1492" is unabashedly
portrayed as a hero who flew in the face of the
superstitions of his time and insisted on action.
In a fit of frustration he has a temper tantrum
in a monastery, flinging illuminated texts and
brawling with monks.
There are, however, elements of current
Columbus scholarship in the film. The idea
that the conquest of the New World was as
much the result of fifteenth-century Spanish
politics as the efforts of a single man receives
equal screen time.
The first hour of the film takes place in the
intolerant Spain of the Inquisition. Heretics are
burnt at the stake and the fall and takeover of
the Moorish city Granada foreshadows the fate
of the civilizations of the New World.
The heroic Columbus is portrayed as an
outsider, a lower class foreigner who is trying to
penetrate the upper echelons of society to ob
tain funding for his project. Even in this realm,
his personal magnetism is the primary force of
action; his subtle flattery and flirtation with
Queen Isabel (Sigourney Weaver) have politi
cal power.
The issue of class conflict carries over to the
events in the New World. On his first voyage,
Columbus views the area where he lands as a
paradise on earth, without the restrictions and
prejudices of Europe.
The film's portrayal of Columbus' decision
to treat the people who he finds living in this
earthly Eden with respect is flagrantly inaccu
rate revisionism. The Columbus of" 1492" does
admit the lure of gold, but his ideals of paradise
drive him onward.
With Columbus depicted as such a romantic
hero, "1492" makes use of an anti-hero to take
responsibility for the evil deeds of the conquest.
The sneering nobleman Moxica (Michael Win
cott) even looks the role of the perfect villain,
clad head to toe in clinging black. He is the ser
pent in the garden, who suggests revenge on the
natives when the Spaniards learn that the men

they left behind have been slaughtered.
Columbus' struggle against Moxica trans
forms the conflict between the good and selfish
intentions of the Europeans into a personal
duel. Depardieu's boisterous acting is matched
only by this character; many of the other roles
in the movie (including that of Armand As
sante as Queen Isabel's chief adviser) are lack
luster by comparison.
After the arrival of Moxica and his men, the
relations between the Spaniards and the natives
inevitably deteriorate. The battle scenes that
ensue are particularly brutal, and Columbus
slowly comes to terms with the fact that his de
sired paradise has become a living hell. As the
hero sees the native who has been his ally and
interpreter fleeing, he asks him where he is
going and is answered with the accusation,
"You never learned my language."
Columbus eventually becomes the victim of
the court society that no longer credits his dis
covery. His faults are seen as sins of omission
rather than results of bad intentions.
In many ways, the same can be said for the
movie. The emphasis on Depardieu's character
drowns out the larger context of Spanish life.
The already existing civilizations of the "New
World" serve as a rich backdrop at times where
they deserve more attention in their own right.
The Columbus story offers a challenge for
any film maker, especially at the time of the
500 th anniversary of the voyage. Recent de
bates about historical consequences flare and
the danger of Columbus-overdose in the media
threatens continued public interest.
Complete with thousands of extras and pe
riod costumes, "1492: The Conquest of Par
adise" will satisfy fans of sweeping historical
epics. Many will marvel at the beautiful cine
matography that director Ridley Scott uses in a
symbolic fashion to reinforce the ideas of the
film.
The problem with "1492" is that the film of
fers very little in the way of a new or creative vi
sion of the story it tells. It gives momentary
glimpses, like the shot of the shore of the New
World, that fire the imagination — but in the
long run it refuses to budge from rehashing the
myth of Columbus the hero.

High-stress days
& financial dismays:
real-estate malaise
An analytical look at the lives of four real
estate agents, the film version of David
Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play "Glen
garry Glen Ross" provides a surprisingly inter
esting, yet depressing picture of men whose
lives revolve around closing the deal and stay
ing afloat.
The film is substantially true to its theatri
cal origins. A viewer might get confused and
wonder if he or she is indeed in a cinema or in
a theater on Broadway. The camera con
tributes to the effect with quick, full face
frames and shadow work.
In order to inspire its agents, the manage
ment at Mitch and Murray Real Estate decides
to run a contest. A Cadillac Eldorado is dan
gled before the nose of the month's top seller.
A pair of steak knives are offered to the second
place finisher; and for the man who comes in
third — a pair of walking shoes.
From the beginning of the film, the desper
ation and panic of these men's lives are obvi
ous. They will stoop to any level to make a sale
and stay alive in the office. Their vulgar, repe
titious language reflects their paralysis and en
trapment. They cannot break out of their lan
guage patterns, much less their lifestyles.
As rain pounds down during the first half

of the movie, both the characters and the
viewer feel its oppressive weight. When the
skies clear and the sun beats down, its intensi
ty is equally merciless. It soon becomes obvi
ous that these men are trapped in a cruel,
primitive, uncompassionate world with ab
solutely no hope of escape.
The cast of "Glengarry Glen Ross" certain
ly does not lack big name talent. Jack Lemmon
plays Shelly "The Machine" Levene, a veteran
salesmen down on his luck. Scrambling to pay
the bills for his sick daughter's hospital care,

Levene knows that he needs to sell
some property, and fast. Lemmon
skillfully portrays a man whose tac
tics prove sickening, yet who also
deserves pity.
In a small, yet forceful appear
ance, Alec Baldwin enters the office
as Blake, a representative of the
management who slings abuse at the
salesmen and initiates the contest.
Alan Arkin plays George Aaronow, a
once successful salesman who has
lost his touch. Barely able to mutter
a full sentence, Aaronow is cornered
in an environment over which he
has no control.
A 1 Pacino plays Ricky Roma, an
office hot shot who has managed to
stay above water despite the sour
market. He seems to have all the an-

swers, as well as the designer suits and fancy
car.
Ed Harris, as Dave Moss, is another sales
man who knows that the situation has turned
desperate and decides to do something about
it. Together with Kevin Spacey as the manage
ment's local puppet and Jonathan Pryce as a
potential customer, the cast members deliver
spectacular performances, capturing the frus
trations and hardship of their characters.
