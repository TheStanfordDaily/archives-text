Beat, boom, bop:
Jive to Afro-pop
world beat tunes

A hot dance party took place Friday night at
the San Francisco's Great American Music
Hall. The special performance featured a new
collection of Afro-pop tunes to celebrate the re
lease of Kotoja's new album, "Sawale."
Kotoja was formed in the Bay Area about
five years ago by Nigerian vocalist and bassist
Ken Okulolo. The band's name is a Nigerian
word which expresses the hope for friendship
and peacefulness among all.

Their music has an up
lifting effect, like Bob
Marley's reggae; it is
happy, festive and cele
bratory. The exuberant
band members smile
and dance in colorful
costumes which mimic
their stage presence.

Kotoja's delightful kaleidoscope of sounds
and unique blend of voices and instruments re
flect the band's roots, one of which is Nigerian
H ighlife — a type of music whose goal is to help
people rise above pain and suffering. Kotoja has
also been influenced by American soul musi
cians like James Brown.
Kotoja's sound can be characterized as
world music, perhaps best defined as a fusion of
many musical styles including — but not limit
ed to — reggae, Latin rhythms and American
popular music.
The band's potpourri of different sounds is
reminiscent of the Japanese-American band,
Hiroshima. Although Hiroshima does not per
form world music, the two are similar in the
sense that traditional instruments from one
culture are used to play the music of a blend of
cultures.
Kotoja includes a brass section consisting of
a saxophone, a trumpet and a trombone, as well
as a bass, guitars, drums, keyboard and vocal
ists.
Their music has an uplifting effect, like Bob
Marley's reggae or Bobby McFerrin's Voices
tra; it is happy, festive and celebratory. The ex
uberant band members smile and dance in col
orful costumes which mimic their stage pres
ence.
This fusion of pop and African music is not
new to band leader Okulolo. As a member of
Monomono, a small five-piece band, which
combines African rhythms with funk, Okulolo
broke away from the tradition of the Highlife
big band.
Okulolo says he feels the music he plays now
gives him a link to his past.
"I started playing bass because it gives me a
sense of direction. It gives the bottom to the
music, the weight the music carries. Everything
relies on the bass," he said, "and I felt I could
carry the weight."
