Sets, songs & story
make 'God's Hands'
a stunning success
Palo Alto's Theatre Works opens its Stage II
season with the world premiere of Douglas J.
Cohen's new musical, "God's Hands." This
semi-autobiographical play explores the rela
tionship between a piano prodigy and his rabbi
father. Spanning the years 1964-1981, "God's
Hands" traces the evolving passions of both
men, sensitively exploring both the bonds and
barriers these passions create.
"God's Hands" weaves music and visual ef
fects together with dialogue to create a stun
ning feast of emotion, humor and wisdom. The
simple, modular set is transformed to suit each
new scene, as slides are projected to provide a
myriad of different backdrops. Ranging from
cans of Bumblebee tuna to an empty syna
gogue, these funny and evocative images propel

the story while adding dimension to individu
als and relationships.
Cohen uses music in the same way, both to
underscore the play's action and as a vehicle to
enrich the audience's understanding of each
character. Generally, his larger numbers, echo
ing the best of Sondheim, outshine more for
gettable spotlight ballads.
The catchy "Let's Not Jump to Conclusions"
opens the show boldly, and the comic "Show
time Friday Night" equals the great brassy
numbers of American theater. Other standouts
include "Ninety-Five Miles to Chicago" and the
climax of the show's Jewish humor, "The 'M'
Word."
One notable exception among Cohen's bal
lads is the beautiful and poignant "Dear
God/Dear Dad," which holds its own against
any of the play's showier numbers.
The strong score and script spring to life
with the help of a superb cast. As Rabbi Daniel
Levy, Stephen S. Gill bridges the roles of father
and rabbi excellently. He brings strength and
wisdom to the part without abandoning the
doubts and fears that make his character real.
Gill's soaring tenor captures the rabbi's pride
and pain more powerfully than the most elo
quent words.

"God's Hands" weaves
music and visual effects
together with dialogue
to create a stunning
feast of emotion, humor
and wisdom.

Diana Torres Koss also delivers a strong per
formance as Ellie, Rabbi Levy's wife. The sin
cerity of her performance is unequaled. Koss's
presence transforms a role that could easily be
come secondary into a focal, essential part. This
performance is enhanced by Koss's graceful,
easy vocal style and strength.
As Benjamin Levy, Mark Phillips portrays a
young man's growth from birth to the age of 17,
a challenge that he meets very well. Phillips' ag
itated and anxious picture of youth is a bit over
whelming at first, but fades nicely as the char
acter matures. Though he seems stronger on
up-tempo numbers, Phillips manages his slow
er, more touching songs well.
Rebecca Fink is excellent as the misunder
stood, dissatisfied daughter Ruth. Her comic
style seems natural, and her performance pure
fun to watch. Miriam Babin plays the dominat
ing grandmother, Rhea, with just the right
blend of love and humor.
A chorus of four chimes in on the larger
numbers. Cohen's score allows for this musical
luxury while carefully insulating the privacy
and intimacy of the family. Their voices are all
strong without becoming overpowering. The
only musical lapse is the ironic use of a tinny
synthesizer in the place of a real piano in this
tribute to the beauty and passion of pure musi
cal expression.
"God's Hands" is expressive, funny and mu
sically stunning, with an excellent premiere
cast. The Theatre Works production runs only
October 2-31.

Benjamin (Mark Phillips), a piano prodi
gy, gains inspiration from his rabbi father
(Stephen Gill), in Douglas Cohen's new
Conn goes out on a
limb with lesbian
film: worth a peek
"Creating films that are not only a risk to
make, but a risk to see" is Nicole Conn's self
avowed goal in making her directoral debut
with a film that explores lesbianism.
"Claire of the Moon" is about a woman's
personal exploration of her sexual, spiritual and
emotional identity. Despite many unfortunate
flaws in this fledgling effort, Conn raises some
serious questions about self-definition that
make "Claire of the Moon" a film worth seeing.
The film opens as Claire Jabrowski (Trisha
Todd), a popular satirist, and Dr. Noel Bene
dict (Karen Trumbo), an openly lesbian author
of a controversial study on sexual behavior,
find themselves trapped as the veritable 'odd
couple' in cabin four at the annual Arcadia
Women's Writer Retreat.
Despite their opposite personalities, the two
learn to appreciate each other. Claire becomes
fascinated with Noel and her life: there is some
thing about her that makes Claire take a second
look at her own endless one night stands.
Though Claire professes that casual sex is
the way she maintains power over men, Noel
attacks this belief to the extent of calling Claire
"a common garden-variety slut." Claire, in
turn, questions Noel's rhetoric, accusing her of
being the quintessential uptight shrink.
Although Claire and Noel continue to avert
intimacy in their opposing denials, their attrac
tion to one another is too strong to deny. In an
ironic turn of events, they discover each other.
Todd's performance as Claire is believable,
but not great. She occasionally falls out of char
acter, as her portrayal ranges from Claire the

crass cynic to Claire the forlorn child.
On the other hand, Trumbo gives a polished
performance as the impeccably dressed, chron
ically proper Dr. Noel Benedict. Unlike Todd,
she manages to evolve her character while still
maintaining continuity. She gracefully makes
the transition from catty and forceful to hum
ble and human.
However, the transition from hate to love
between Claire and Noel is too abruptly por
trayed. After one conversation in which Claire
realizes that Noel's unconventional lifestyle in
volves risks similar to her own, Claire allows a
truce, which blossoms into a friendship
overnight. After seeing such strong animosity

between the two in the beginning of the film,
this shift is too quick to be true.
Director/screenwriter Nicole Conn could
have spent more time on the characterization
of the supporting cast. She falls into the trap of
focusing so heavily on the main characters that
she allows everyone else to fall by the wayside of
stereotypes.
These single-faceted characters include Tara
O'Hara, a homophobic, frosty-eyeshadow
wearing southern belle who writes romance
novels; Maggie, a plaid-flannel-clad butch les
bian who runs the retreat house; and Shilo, a
New Age hippie who advocates crystal healing
as the ultimate panacea.

Several scenes are as cliche as the supporting
characters. In one instance Claire and Noel,
without looking, each grab the other's coffee
mug. When they finally realize their faux-pas,
they gaze at one another in nervous tension.
The scene is so tacky, one almost expects a
voice-over to say, "Today, we secretly replaced
the coffee Noel normally drinks with Folgers
crystals."
In another losing moment, Claire opens
cabinets while Noel goes around slamming
them shut. Such childish portrayal degrades
their differences to superficial Type A versus
Type B tension.
Too often the film forces the viewer to take a
walk down memory lane: a scene of a women's
roundtable discussion about men is distinctly
reminiscent of Jungle Fever, and the film ends
with a shot of Claire and Noel's clasped hands,
a la Thelma and Louise.
Despite its many flaws, "Claire of the Moon"
is worth seeing. Conn raises some philosophi
cal issues that serve as food for thought long
after the popcorn and raisinetes are gone.
Noel's belief that men and women can never
share a deeply personal relationship because
they speak a different language offers a
provocative question about true intimacy.
Conn is equally skillful at handling the com
plex and conflicting emotions of the main char
acters delicately. The tension, desire and per
sonal struggle that both Claire and Noel experi
ence are profound. Her directing is effective in
parts, particularly in the fantasy sequences,
where the intimacy that Noel and Claire secret
ly long for is made explicit.
For those unfamiliar with films that deal
openly with lesbianism, "Claire of the Moon" is
a good start because it makes more of a human
statement than a political statement. As a re
sult, watching "Claire" is an inclusive rather
than alienating experience.
