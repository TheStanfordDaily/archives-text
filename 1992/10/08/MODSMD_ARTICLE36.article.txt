Sets, songs & story
make 'God's Hands'
a stunning success
Palo Alto's Theatre Works opens its Stage II
season with the world premiere of Douglas J.
Cohen's new musical, "God's Hands." This
semi-autobiographical play explores the rela
tionship between a piano prodigy and his rabbi
father. Spanning the years 1964-1981, "God's
Hands" traces the evolving passions of both
men, sensitively exploring both the bonds and
barriers these passions create.
"God's Hands" weaves music and visual ef
fects together with dialogue to create a stun
ning feast of emotion, humor and wisdom. The
simple, modular set is transformed to suit each
new scene, as slides are projected to provide a
myriad of different backdrops. Ranging from
cans of Bumblebee tuna to an empty syna
gogue, these funny and evocative images propel

the story while adding dimension to individu
als and relationships.
Cohen uses music in the same way, both to
underscore the play's action and as a vehicle to
enrich the audience's understanding of each
character. Generally, his larger numbers, echo
ing the best of Sondheim, outshine more for
gettable spotlight ballads.
The catchy "Let's Not Jump to Conclusions"
opens the show boldly, and the comic "Show
time Friday Night" equals the great brassy
numbers of American theater. Other standouts
include "Ninety-Five Miles to Chicago" and the
climax of the show's Jewish humor, "The 'M'
Word."
One notable exception among Cohen's bal
lads is the beautiful and poignant "Dear
God/Dear Dad," which holds its own against
any of the play's showier numbers.
The strong score and script spring to life
with the help of a superb cast. As Rabbi Daniel
Levy, Stephen S. Gill bridges the roles of father
and rabbi excellently. He brings strength and
wisdom to the part without abandoning the
doubts and fears that make his character real.
Gill's soaring tenor captures the rabbi's pride
and pain more powerfully than the most elo
quent words.

"God's Hands" weaves
music and visual effects
together with dialogue
to create a stunning
feast of emotion, humor
and wisdom.

Diana Torres Koss also delivers a strong per
formance as Ellie, Rabbi Levy's wife. The sin
cerity of her performance is unequaled. Koss's
presence transforms a role that could easily be
come secondary into a focal, essential part. This
performance is enhanced by Koss's graceful,
easy vocal style and strength.
As Benjamin Levy, Mark Phillips portrays a
young man's growth from birth to the age of 17,
a challenge that he meets very well. Phillips' ag
itated and anxious picture of youth is a bit over
whelming at first, but fades nicely as the char
acter matures. Though he seems stronger on
up-tempo numbers, Phillips manages his slow
er, more touching songs well.
Rebecca Fink is excellent as the misunder
stood, dissatisfied daughter Ruth. Her comic
style seems natural, and her performance pure
fun to watch. Miriam Babin plays the dominat
ing grandmother, Rhea, with just the right
blend of love and humor.
A chorus of four chimes in on the larger
numbers. Cohen's score allows for this musical
luxury while carefully insulating the privacy
and intimacy of the family. Their voices are all
strong without becoming overpowering. The
only musical lapse is the ironic use of a tinny
synthesizer in the place of a real piano in this
tribute to the beauty and passion of pure musi
cal expression.
"God's Hands" is expressive, funny and mu
sically stunning, with an excellent premiere
cast. The Theatre Works production runs only
October 2-31.
