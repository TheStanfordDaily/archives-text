# SPREADING THE WEALTH
## Danza Azteca, Gurrofio and Los Muñequitos de Matanzas share rich heritages through performing arts

"We want our children to know
that it is the beat of the Huehuetl
drum which is the heart of "the
danza" and the voice of the ancient
ones that pounds in their blood. It is
the echo of the caracol, or conch, that
is etched in their souls. It is our inten
tion through the Danza to send a
message to all people that our past is
exciting, stimulating and worthy of
respect."
— Danza Azteca de Anahuac
The rhythms, drama and spiritu
ality of the "danza," traditional Aztec
ritual dance, will be brought to Frost
Amphitheater this Sunday. With the
blowing of "caracoles" — conch
shells — Danza Azteca de Anahuac
trumpets the vitality of Native Amer
ican culture.
Committed to "the preservation
and presentation of traditional Aztec

dance and music," as member Nor
berto Zamudo states, Danza Azteca
has been performing at Pow-Wows
and cultural festivals, in theaters and
workshops for five years.
Before borders divided the North
American continent, it was called
"Anahuac," a name from the Mayan
and Nahuatl language meaning "land
surrounded by water." Danza Azteca
shows its identification with this pre-
Columbian era not only with its
name, but also with its elaborate cos
tumes, unique instruments and ritu
al movement.
Danza Azteca will take the stage
Sunday with the Paso de Camino, a
ceremonial entrance in which honor
is paid to Quetzalcoatl, the plumed
serpent, with the blowing of cara
coles and serpentine movements.
This procession is termed a "battle,"
where songs and dances are weapons,
and the human spirit is the territory
at stake.
The program then begins with a

dance for the Concheros Antiguos,
the ancient ones. This dance is always
first, for in it the dancers pay their re
spects to their ancestors and ask per
mission to perform the rest of the
ceremony.
Subsequent elements of the per
formance include dances dedicated
to Tonatiuh (Sun God), Tonantzin
(Our Mother Earth), Xipe Totec
(God of Agriculture) and Atl-Tlachi
nolli (Water and Fire), in addition to
several others.
Instruments, which in the Aztec
culture are believed to be alive and
embodied with spirits, are of great
importance in the danza. The "hue
huetl," the upright "grandfather cer
emonial drum," is seen in all native
cultures of Anahuac as the voice of
the ancient ones. Its circular shape
represents the earth and the universe.
The "huehuetl's" counterpart is
the "teponaztli," the "grandmother
ceremonial drum," which is horizon
tal. Together, the two form the sacred
cross of the dance circle.
Other percussive instruments in
clude the "ayacachtli," gourd rattles
and bone rasps; the "tepozontle,"
stone drums; the "atl-quiauhitl,"
rainstick; and the "cocoayotl," turtle
shells.
Melodic instruments are equally
numerous and complex. The tribes
of Anahuac crafted various types of
flutes made of both bamboo and clay.
Mayan flutes produced sue- and
seven-tone scales, while Tarascan
flutes rendered whole-tone scales.
Even more sophisticated were the
triple and quadruple flutes from the
Gulf of Mexico.
The group is composed of three
men and two women, all of whom
have different connections with the
"danza."
Founding member Guillermo
Chavez Rosete is from Mexico and
has been involved in Aztec ritual
dance for 20 years. Like many Mexi
cans, he is of mixed Spanish and Na
tive American descent, a "mestizo."
Chavez Rosete identifies strongly
with the cultural heritage of the
Aztecs. He states, "As a danzante, my
role is to carry the Danza and its tra
ditional ways and to teach it to others
so that our culture will not perish."
Norberto Zamudio was also born
and raised in Mexico and is a mesti
zo. A man of multiple talents, Zamu
dio is a photographer, painter and
martial artist. He has been studying
the history of American cultures with
a focus on art and culture.

Explaining his connection with
Danza Azteca, Zamudio says,"It is in
the Danza that I have been able to
synthesize my cultural, artistic and
spiritual beliefs."
Dorotea Martinez Miera, Chavez
Rosete's wife, was born and raised in
Taos, New Mexico. An accomplished
dancer, she has studied ballet, mid-
Eastern, modern and jazz dance in
addition to Aztec dance.
Danza Azteca's openness is shown
best by its inclusion of Anglo percus
sionist Larry Sargeant, also from
Taos. Sargeant has performed salsa
and Latin jazz with many Meso-
American musical groups, in addi
tion to playing with Danza Azteca for
the last four years. A veteran of studio
work, Sargeant has three albums:
"Paz Lago," "Star Diver" and "Jaguar
Weeps."
Dancer Pat Garza, a Native Amer
ican of mixed lineage also from Taos,

has performed with Aztec dance
groups for 10 years and, like Mar
tinez Miera, has studied modern,
jazz, mid-Eastern and African dance.
Yet even with her varied back
ground, Garza still sees Danza Azteca
as vital. She says,"It is our honor to
pay respect to our ancestors, remind
ing them we have not forgotten them
as we hand down the 'danza' to fu
ture generations."
Also performing Sunday at Frost
will be Cuba's Los Munequitos de
Mantanzas and the Venezuelan band
Gurrofio. Los Mufiequitos is a per
cussion, vocal and dance group
founded in 1952. The ensemble has
left Cuba only once before, for a tour
of England in 1989.
Los Muftequitos will perform
"Patakin," a program which traces
the cultural liberation of Cuba from
Yoruba rituals to three varieties of
the Rumba.

The rhythms, drama and spiritu
ality of the "danza," traditional Aztec
ritual dance, will be brought to Frost
Amphitheater this Sunday. With the
blowing of "caracoles" — conch
shells — Danza Azteca de Anahuac
trumpets the vitality of Native Amer
ican culture.
Committed to "the preservation
and presentation of traditional Aztec

dance and music," as member Nor
berto Zamudo states, Danza Azteca
has been performing at Pow-Wows
and cultural festivals, in theaters and
workshops for five years.
Before borders divided the North
American continent, it was called
"Anahuac," a name from the Mayan
and Nahuatl language meaning "land
surrounded by water." Danza Azteca
shows its identification with this pre-
Columbian era not only with its
name, but also with its elaborate cos
tumes, unique instruments and ritu
al movement.
Danza Azteca will take the stage
Sunday with the Paso de Camino, a
ceremonial entrance in which honor
is paid to Quetzalcoatl, the plumed
serpent, with the blowing of cara
coles and serpentine movements.
This procession is termed a "battle,"
where songs and dances are weapons,
and the human spirit is the territory
at stake.
The program then begins with a

dance for the Concheros Antiguos,
the ancient ones. This dance is always
first, for in it the dancers pay their re
spects to their ancestors and ask per
mission to perform the rest of the
ceremony.
Subsequent elements of the per
formance include dances dedicated
to Tonatiuh (Sun God), Tonantzin
(Our Mother Earth), Xipe Totec
(God of Agriculture) and Atl-Tlachi
nolli (Water and Fire), in addition to
several others.
Instruments, which in the Aztec
culture are believed to be alive and
embodied with spirits, are of great
importance in the danza. The "hue
huetl," the upright "grandfather cer
emonial drum," is seen in all native
cultures of Anahuac as the voice of
the ancient ones. Its circular shape
represents the earth and the universe.
The "huehuetl's" counterpart is
the "teponaztli," the "grandmother
ceremonial drum," which is horizon
tal. Together, the two form the sacred
cross of the dance circle.
Other percussive instruments in
clude the "ayacachtli," gourd rattles
and bone rasps; the "tepozontle,"
stone drums; the "atl-quiauhitl,"
rainstick; and the "cocoayotl," turtle
shells.
Melodic instruments are equally
numerous and complex. The tribes
of Anahuac crafted various types of
flutes made of both bamboo and clay.
Mayan flutes produced sue- and
seven-tone scales, while Tarascan
flutes rendered whole-tone scales.
Even more sophisticated were the
triple and quadruple flutes from the
Gulf of Mexico.
The group is composed of three
men and two women, all of whom
have different connections with the
"danza."
Founding member Guillermo
Chavez Rosete is from Mexico and
has been involved in Aztec ritual
dance for 20 years. Like many Mexi
cans, he is of mixed Spanish and Na
tive American descent, a "mestizo."
Chavez Rosete identifies strongly
with the cultural heritage of the
Aztecs. He states, "As a danzante, my
role is to carry the Danza and its tra
ditional ways and to teach it to others
so that our culture will not perish."
Norberto Zamudio was also born
and raised in Mexico and is a mesti
zo. A man of multiple talents, Zamu
dio is a photographer, painter and
martial artist. He has been studying
the history of American cultures with
a focus on art and culture.

Explaining his connection with
Danza Azteca, Zamudio says,"It is in
the Danza that I have been able to
synthesize my cultural, artistic and
spiritual beliefs."
Dorotea Martinez Miera, Chavez
Rosete's wife, was born and raised in
Taos, New Mexico. An accomplished
dancer, she has studied ballet, mid-
Eastern, modern and jazz dance in
addition to Aztec dance.
Danza Azteca's openness is shown
best by its inclusion of Anglo percus
sionist Larry Sargeant, also from
Taos. Sargeant has performed salsa
and Latin jazz with many Meso-
American musical groups, in addi
tion to playing with Danza Azteca for
the last four years. A veteran of studio
work, Sargeant has three albums:
"Paz Lago," "Star Diver" and "Jaguar
Weeps."
Dancer Pat Garza, a Native Amer
ican of mixed lineage also from Taos,

has performed with Aztec dance
groups for 10 years and, like Mar
tinez Miera, has studied modern,
jazz, mid-Eastern and African dance.
Yet even with her varied back
ground, Garza still sees Danza Azteca
as vital. She says,"It is our honor to
pay respect to our ancestors, remind
ing them we have not forgotten them
as we hand down the 'danza' to fu
ture generations."
Also performing Sunday at Frost
will be Cuba's Los Munequitos de
Mantanzas and the Venezuelan band
Gurrofio. Los Mufiequitos is a per
cussion, vocal and dance group
founded in 1952. The ensemble has
left Cuba only once before, for a tour
of England in 1989.
Los Muftequitos will perform
"Patakin," a program which traces
the cultural liberation of Cuba from
Yoruba rituals to three varieties of
the Rumba.

"We want our children to know
that it is the beat of the Huehuetl
drum which is the heart of "the
danza" and the voice of the ancient
ones that pounds in their blood. It is
the echo of the caracol, or conch, that
is etched in their souls. It is our inten
tion through the Danza to send a
message to all people that our past is
exciting, stimulating and worthy of
respect."
