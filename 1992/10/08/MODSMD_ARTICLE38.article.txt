# Symposium explores art and ethnicity
## 
### Anita De Lucio 
Museums are often seen as the ex
clusive country clubs of American
art. In an effort to open up avenues of
expression for people of color, San
Francisco's Mexican Museum hosted
the symposium, "Beyond 1992 —
Dis-Covering American Culture," on
Saturday Oct. 3.
The symposium explored ethno
centrism within American museums
and the influence of the 1960s Civil
Rights movements on young artists
in the 19905.
The symposium's first session —
"Shattering the Glass Ceiling: The
Role of Museums Beyond 1992" —
challenged museums' commitment
to employing and exhibiting the work
of people of color.
Native American artist George
Ixingfish, director of UC-Davis' Gor
man Museum, said he refused to "wait
for the dominant society to decide if his
work is considered art I'm going to
create whether you like it or not."
Many artists of color, he said,
break the fundamentals they learn in
art school "and the art world can't
deal with it." As a result, the main
stream art world backlashes and no
monetary value is given to the work
of these artists.
Some progress has been made in
incorporating the art of communities
of color into mainstream institu
tions, according to Harry Parker, the
Director of Museums for The Fine
Arts Museums of San Francisco. But
mainstream San Francisco museums
currently have "a narrow audience in
terms of demographics.Fewer than
10 percent are from non-white com
munities," he said.
The test of inclusion efforts, Park
er said, is finding out how many new
members have been brought into the
museum and whether the targeted
community has retained interest.
Artist Geno Rodriguez, founder
and executive director of the Alterna
tive Museum in New York, said about
his experiences with art critics, "I
don't need to be affirmed by anyone
but myself."
"There are racists within the art
world," Rodriguez said. So rather
than wait for recognition by critics
and mainstream institutions, he

founded his own museum — which
he does not see as a minority institu
tion but as a challenge to the main
stream.
"Do we want a stale, molding
piece of pie or do we want to make
our own pie?" Rodriguez asked.
He defined the ideal museum as
one that is inclusive and socially re
sponsive when times demand it; one
that provides vision, direction and
dialogue for people of color.
The Alternative Museum pays the
price for its inclusiveness and ac
tivism: it has little money and sup
port.

'Do we want a stale,
molding piece of pie or
do we want to make our
own pie?'

Responding to a question about
how to shatter the glass ceiling, Park
er said, "Anger needs to be harnessed
properly. In the end it is not produc
tive unless it is focused on change, de
liberate negotiation, discussion and
work with people."
An audience member provided an
eloquent conclusion for the session
suggesting that a more appropriate
title for the seminar would have been
"Shattering the Museum."
The second session — "Artistic
Practice and Social Identity: What
does this have to do with me? The
Next Generation" — was a lively, col
orful presentation by poets, perform
ers and visual artists from various
ethnic backgrounds. Each discussed
the influences of the 1960s civil rights
movement on their work.
The first panelist, African-Ameri
can musician Toshi Reagan, ex
plained that her music and singing
were strongly influenced by songs she
heard as a child in the '60s.
Reagan said there is a "comfort
7x>ne" of political expression. "When
musicians make statements about
rainforests, etc., it's OK," she said.
"But if they hit closer to home,"
artists suffer a backlash from the large
labels and distributors.
Reagan concluded that "the more

we put the product in the hands of the
corporations, the more washed out
the political message becomes."
Panelist Rub£n Martinez, poet,
author and senior editor of the L.A.
Weekly, said that the 1990s are a time
for "breaking down barriers between
genres." Martinez added that "poli
tics and art are married.... I put po
etry in my journalism and journalism
in my poetry."
Toi Hoang, a Vietnamese artist
from San Jose, was in Vietnam during
the '60s but was nevertheless influ
enced by Martin Luther King, Jr.
However, Hoang said he is not a
political activist. "I try to heal myself
through my art," Hoang said. He has
been creating what he defines as
"memorial art" to bring back his own
identity.
Hoang is exhibiting at the Oakland
museum a collection of stretchers de
picting the pain he witnessed in Viet
nam and in America. He explained, "I
don't know how 1 got the idea of
stretchers," he said, "but when you've
seen so many, you cannot forget."
Gesturing to Reagan and Mar
tinez, he said he couldn't sing or
write, but found a way to express
himself through art "to overcome
isolation. From stretcher to stretcher,
I began to find hope."
Lalo "Chapo" Zul, founder of
Aztldn Nation, a rap group from the
Berkeley barrios, said the group is
strongly influenced by the Chicano
Nationalist Movement of the '60s.
Aztldn Nation — which per
formed after the sessions — has not
been signed on by any label and they
"sell tapes out of the trunks" of their
cars. But the group's goal, Zul ex
plained, is "self-expression, not to
make money."
"People are tired of love songs or
art-for-art's-sake stings," said Zul,
the group's Minister of Information.
"Rap," Zul said, "is a continuum
of self-taught and oral history. We are
depending too much on educational
institutions when we should be edu
cating our own people."
