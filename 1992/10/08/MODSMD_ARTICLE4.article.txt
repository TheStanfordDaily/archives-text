# Jennings winging it on West Coast
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Producing a nightly news show from Cali
fornia can result in a "horrendous" schedule
and a technical nightmare, according to ABC
News anchor Peter Jennings.
"When we're on the road . . . we're flying
by the seat of our pants a lot of the time,"
Jennings said in an interview yesterday.
"It's not like having me in New York
where if anything goes wrong in the field I
know what's been written, I've worked on it

and 1 can sit there and bull about it — or lie,
cheat and steal about it — for 30 seconds
until we get our act together."
But the Silicon Valley location was crucial
for the network's report on the competitive
ness of high-tech firms, he said.
"The whole question of American compet
itiveness is a big issue between the two prin
cipal candidates — between all three candi
dates, including Perot — and this is where
much of the dream was dreamed and much of
the early experimentation and much of the
early progress was made."

The three-hour time difference on the
West Coast means "World News Tonight"
must air by 3:30 p.m.
"We are much hampered, unfortunately,
by coming to California, which I discovered
yesterday," Jennings said. "Very often when
we travel, we're overseas and we almost in
variably gain time. I was based in London for
a long time, for example, and we always had
five hours extra to think."
Russia and Eastern Europe give the team
