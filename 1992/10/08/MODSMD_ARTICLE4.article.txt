# Jennings winging it on West Coast
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Producing a nightly news show from Cali
fornia can result in a "horrendous" schedule
and a technical nightmare, according to ABC
News anchor Peter Jennings.
"When we're on the road . . . we're flying
by the seat of our pants a lot of the time,"
Jennings said in an interview yesterday.
"It's not like having me in New York
where if anything goes wrong in the field I
know what's been written, I've worked on it

and 1 can sit there and bull about it — or lie,
cheat and steal about it — for 30 seconds
until we get our act together."
But the Silicon Valley location was crucial
for the network's report on the competitive
ness of high-tech firms, he said.
"The whole question of American compet
itiveness is a big issue between the two prin
cipal candidates — between all three candi
dates, including Perot — and this is where
much of the dream was dreamed and much of
the early experimentation and much of the
early progress was made."

The three-hour time difference on the
West Coast means "World News Tonight"
must air by 3:30 p.m.
"We are much hampered, unfortunately,
by coming to California, which I discovered
yesterday," Jennings said. "Very often when
we travel, we're overseas and we almost in
variably gain time. I was based in London for
a long time, for example, and we always had
five hours extra to think."
Russia and Eastern Europe give the team
even more time, up to eight
hours. "Here, of course, to get the
broadcast on the air by 3:30 in the
afternoon even though we started
at a quarter to 6 in the morning,
was horrendous," he said.
"Yesterday I wandered into a
cafe in Niles, California and found
five really exquisite characters
talking about the campaign, hung
out with them for 35 minutes.
They said wonderful things about
their lives and how they were
being affected by the economy.
"I didn't finish the piece until
10 to 3. We were on the air at
3:30, and I left a lot of their good
stuff on the floor, unfortunately,"
Jennings said.
The technical requirements of
reporting on the road are exact
ing, he said, especially for the
evening news. "If the system goes
down here, the system goes down
altogether," Jennings explained.
"If I'm doing a live broadcast,
if I'm doing a broadcast during
the war or during election night
or something, you can go on for
ever and you can turn it off to any
one of a dozen other reporters."
But "the evening news is tough
because ... in a broadcast where
everything is timed to two or
three or four seconds and you've
slaved over a word and somebody
says 'You've got to save me five
seconds in the next page,' then
it's kind of tough."
Jennings said he tries to edit
most of his own material. "I have
two writers on the broadcast who
work with me because we may
deal with 30, 40 topics in a day,"
he said. "It's not just sitting down
to write them, it's sitting down to
research them. But today, I guess
I did 90 percent today."
A national editor and senior
producer remain in New York
when his team travels, he said.
Jennings said he would be
returning to Stanford last night
for the focus group taping at the
Hoover Institution. "What we've
done everywhere around the
country is .. . choose 12 people
chosen by our political polling unit
who are undecideds," he said.
"For the first {presidential]
debate on Sunday, we're going to
take two people from our New
York focus group, two people

from the South and two people
from here and use them as our
post-game analysts rather than
listening to reporters."
Although staff members tried
to set up a meeting between Jen
nings and University President
Gerhard Casper, scheduling prob
lems prevented the rendezvous.
"I thought it would be an impo
sition," Jennings said. "I suspect
he's got enough on his plate at the
moment moving into his new
house and probably doesn't want
reporters looking at it anyway."
He also responded to critics
who claim that reporters assigned
to presidential campaigns become
too cozy with the candidates.
"I think it's essential for any
reporter on any story to get as
close to his or her subject as he or
she can. I don't think because you
spend all day with a political can
didate you necessarily come to
espouse their cause," he said.
"Sometimes you come to
despise them. I've covered politi
cians who I started off liking and
I couldn't stand after a week."
While "World News Tonight"
has assigned reporters to all three
presidential candidates, Jennings
said the network "does not put
them on the air on a daily basis
unless that campaign has done
something it didn't do yesterday.
He also shared his views on the
necessity of having seasoned
political reporters watching a
presidential race.
"Politics is a culture," Jen
nings said. "Covering politics
requires a particular mind. Some
of us do it well, some of us do it
badly. In my career I have not
done it particularly well."
After his time as a foreign cor
respondent, Jennings said he has
been more accustomed to
Lebanese politics than American
during the last 20 years.
Reporting on the private lives
of candidates is one area the
media has had to struggle with
this year, he said, and he believes
it is a question that can only be
answered on a case-by-case basis.
"People who know me know
that I have an absolute aversion to
invading people's lives," Jennings
said. "It's a great struggle for us
on this broadcast to decide when
the candidate's private life, main
ly the issue of character, becomes
a public issue. We were the last
broadcast to deal with Bill Clinton
and Gennifer Flowers."

a long time, for example, and we always had
five hours extra to think."
Russia and Eastern Europe give the team
even more time, up to eight
hours. "Here, of course, to get the
broadcast on the air by 3:30 in the
afternoon even though we started
at a quarter to 6 in the morning,
was horrendous," he said.
"Yesterday I wandered into a
cafe in Niles, California and found
five really exquisite characters
talking about the campaign, hung
out with them for 35 minutes.
They said wonderful things about
their lives and how they were
being affected by the economy.
"I didn't finish the piece until
10 to 3. We were on the air at
3:30, and I left a lot of their good
stuff on the floor, unfortunately,"
Jennings said.
The technical requirements of
reporting on the road are exact
ing, he said, especially for the
evening news. "If the system goes
down here, the system goes down
altogether," Jennings explained.
"If I'm doing a live broadcast,
if I'm doing a broadcast during
the war or during election night
or something, you can go on for
ever and you can turn it off to any
one of a dozen other reporters."
But "the evening news is tough
because ... in a broadcast where
everything is timed to two or
three or four seconds and you've
slaved over a word and somebody
says 'You've got to save me five
seconds in the next page,' then
it's kind of tough."
Jennings said he tries to edit
most of his own material. "I have
two writers on the broadcast who
work with me because we may
deal with 30, 40 topics in a day,"
he said. "It's not just sitting down
to write them, it's sitting down to
research them. But today, I guess
I did 90 percent today."
A national editor and senior
producer remain in New York
when his team travels, he said.
Jennings said he would be
returning to Stanford last night
for the focus group taping at the
Hoover Institution. "What we've
done everywhere around the
country is .. . choose 12 people
chosen by our political polling unit
who are undecideds," he said.
"For the first {presidential]
debate on Sunday, we're going to
take two people from our New
York focus group, two people

from the South and two people
from here and use them as our
post-game analysts rather than
listening to reporters."
Although staff members tried
to set up a meeting between Jen
nings and University President
Gerhard Casper, scheduling prob
lems prevented the rendezvous.
"I thought it would be an impo
sition," Jennings said. "I suspect
he's got enough on his plate at the
moment moving into his new
house and probably doesn't want
reporters looking at it anyway."
He also responded to critics
who claim that reporters assigned
to presidential campaigns become
too cozy with the candidates.
"I think it's essential for any
reporter on any story to get as
close to his or her subject as he or
she can. I don't think because you
spend all day with a political can
didate you necessarily come to
espouse their cause," he said.
"Sometimes you come to
despise them. I've covered politi
cians who I started off liking and
I couldn't stand after a week."
While "World News Tonight"
has assigned reporters to all three
presidential candidates, Jennings
said the network "does not put
them on the air on a daily basis
unless that campaign has done
something it didn't do yesterday.
He also shared his views on the
necessity of having seasoned
political reporters watching a
presidential race.
"Politics is a culture," Jen
nings said. "Covering politics
requires a particular mind. Some
of us do it well, some of us do it
badly. In my career I have not
done it particularly well."
After his time as a foreign cor
respondent, Jennings said he has
been more accustomed to
Lebanese politics than American
during the last 20 years.
Reporting on the private lives
of candidates is one area the
media has had to struggle with
this year, he said, and he believes
it is a question that can only be
answered on a case-by-case basis.
"People who know me know
that I have an absolute aversion to
invading people's lives," Jennings
said. "It's a great struggle for us
on this broadcast to decide when
the candidate's private life, main
ly the issue of character, becomes
a public issue. We were the last
broadcast to deal with Bill Clinton
and Gennifer Flowers."
Producing a nightly news show from Cali
fornia can result in a "horrendous" schedule
and a technical nightmare, according to ABC
News anchor Peter Jennings.
"When we're on the road . . . we're flying
by the seat of our pants a lot of the time,"
Jennings said in an interview yesterday.
"It's not like having me in New York
where if anything goes wrong in the field I
know what's been written, I've worked on it

and 1 can sit there and bull about it — or lie,
cheat and steal about it — for 30 seconds
until we get our act together."
But the Silicon Valley location was crucial
for the network's report on the competitive
ness of high-tech firms, he said.
"The whole question of American compet
itiveness is a big issue between the two prin
cipal candidates — between all three candi
dates, including Perot — and this is where
much of the dream was dreamed and much of
the early experimentation and much of the
early progress was made."

The three-hour time difference on the
West Coast means "World News Tonight"
must air by 3:30 p.m.
"We are much hampered, unfortunately,
by coming to California, which I discovered
yesterday," Jennings said. "Very often when
we travel, we're overseas and we almost in
variably gain time. I was based in London for
a long time, for example, and we always had
five hours extra to think."
