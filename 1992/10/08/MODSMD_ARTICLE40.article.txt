# Old-fashioned fun in Palo Alto
## Film festival spotlights '30 s actress Alice Faye 
### Alnoor Ebrahim 
The most popular singer of the
late-1930's and easily one of Holly
wood's favorite screen stars will ap
pear at the Stanford Theater this
week. The Alice Faye Film Festival
kicked off yesterday and will peak
this Saturday with a personal appear
ance by Alice Faye following the 7:30
p.m. showing of "Alexander's Rag
time Band" (1938).
An irresistibly warm and dynamic
personality, coupled with a com
pelling deep voice, rocketed Faye to
the top of 20th Century-Fox musi
cals in the '30s and '40s. Irving
Berlin, who wrote the music and
lyrics for "Alexander's Ragtime
Band" and "On the Avenue" (1937),
declared that "I'd rather have Alice
Faye introduce my songs than any
other singer I know."
But Faye doesn't stop with intro
ductions — she delivers her songs
with passion, charisma and childlike
sincerity. She has that rare gift which
Ed Stout, an organ artisan at the
Stanford Theater, rightfully chooses
to call "a velvet thrill." This quality is
delightfully evident in her tender and
quivering performance of "Now It
Can Be Told" in "Alexander's Rag
time Band."
Born in New York City in 1915,
Alice Leppert began her stage career
as a chorus dancer in the late 1920'5,
later adopting the name Alice Faye.

Gaining recognition for the warmth
of her voice, Faye made her first
commercial recording in 1933 and
was signed on for a musical number
in "George White's Scandals" at Fox
Studios in Hollywood.

She has that rare gift
which Ed Stout, an
organ artisan at the
Stanford Theater,
rightfully chooses to
call 'a velvet thrill.'

She followed with roles in several
musicals, and finally received highly
popular reviews in "King of Bur
lesque" (1936). She wasn't truly ap
preciated, however, until 1938 when
she starred in"In Old Chicago,"
"Irene and Mary," and "Alexander's
Ragtime Band."
Following the 1939 production of
"Hollywood Cavalcade," she was
ranked as the top female star of 1940,
preferred over Myrna Loy and Bette
Davis. That same year, Faye starred
with Betty Grable in"Tin Pan Alley,"
and with Don Ameche in "Lillian
Russell."
Her career was also highlighted by

performances with a somewhat wild
Carmen Miranda in "Weekend in
Havana" (1941) and"The Gang's All
Here" (1943), the latter involving ex
tensive and bizarre special effects, in
cluding costuming and sets made of
bananas and other fruit.
The setting of the Alice Faye Film
Festival is particularly appropriate.
The Stanford Theater was restored
three years ago to its 1925 condition.
David Packard, son of the founder of
Hewlett-Packard, has been responsi
ble for restoring the building and is
dedicated to showing classic films
"the old-fashioned way."
Shows come complete with a
Wurlitzer organ performance, mar
velously cushioned 1956 seats, origi
nal film posters and meticulous at
tention to traditional lighting and
projection techniques. Some of the
films, such as "Alexander's Ragtime
Band" and "Lillian Russell," are even
on an old-style nitrate print that
yields superb clarity.
For the theater-goer who has had
little exposure to Alice Faye, the
Festival is a rare opportunity for a
complete experience. The collec
tion of films running from Oct. 7 to
17 represents some of her finest
work, and provides a panorama of
her talents. Most of the films are
musicals, since singing is clearly
Faye's forte.
And of course, Alice will be there
on Saturday.

ble for restoring the building and is
dedicated to showing classic films
"the old-fashioned way."
Shows come complete with a
Wurlitzer organ performance, mar
velously cushioned 1956 seats, origi
nal film posters and meticulous at
tention to traditional lighting and
projection techniques. Some of the
films, such as "Alexander's Ragtime
Band" and "Lillian Russell," are even
on an old-style nitrate print that
yields superb clarity.
For the theater-goer who has had
little exposure to Alice Faye, the
Festival is a rare opportunity for a
complete experience. The collec
tion of films running from Oct. 7 to
17 represents some of her finest
work, and provides a panorama of
her talents. Most of the films are
musicals, since singing is clearly
Faye's forte.
And of course, Alice will be there
on Saturday.
