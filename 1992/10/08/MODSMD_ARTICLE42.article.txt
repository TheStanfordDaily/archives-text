# The 						anxiety and angst of a high-power summer job
## 
### 
I'd never worn a tie for longer than five
hours at a stretch. No less one that wasn't
made of leather. But if that's what it was
going to take for fame, fortune and the chance
to catch Jane Bryant Quinn in various stages of
undress, then I was prepared to make the sac
rifice — even if it involved those annoying flo
ral prints.
It was 8 a.m. And I had bigger things to
worry about than which way to string my belt
through the loops, and whether it would be
different if I were in Australia.
I had this overwhelming fear — similar to,
but not quite the same as, that feeling right be
fore Bobby would shut the door to Sam's walk
in freezer — that Newsweek had forgotten
they'd hired me.
If you think about it, all I had to go on, real
ly, was this letter they sent me four months ear
lier. And although the "cc" thing looked con
vincing, there was a very real possibility it
never actually got any further than the secre
tary who wrote it.
My internship — if it ever existed in the first
place — was, by now, no doubt in the hands of
some serious college journalist who had done a
huge expos£ uncovering some primitive haz
ing ritual involving honey-roasted peanuts
and lower body hair.
The thought of explaining all this to the sec
retary made me more nervous than a woman
in a David Mamet play;
"Hi. I'm Joel Stein. I'm one of the summer
interns."
"Like hell you are."
But it wasn't like that at all. There were bal
loons and banners and a receiving line culmi

nating with one of those adorable, European,
double-cheek kisses from George Will. Well,
maybe not, but someone did compliment me
on my tie.
And they gave me a card. A card with my
picture on it. A card that they claimed would

open doors through
out the entire build
ing. Doors behind
which Jane Bryant
Quinn might lurk.
I felt important al
ready. They showed
me the library and
pointed out a file cabi
net bigger than the
FBl's. 1 immediately
looked up Heming
way and Steinbeck.
And then, when no
one was looking, I
looked up myself. I

wasn't there. Not even in the small files. I
vowed to change that, even if it meant a costly
lawsuit with Quinn.
But just as my ego was beginning to slip
down just a notch to Mary Matlin size, I was
sent down to my very own little cubicle in the
Periscope section. For those of you who don't
read the magazine, the Periscope section is the
area most people skim before going on to look
at all the pretty pictures. Along with the Mari
lyn Vos Savant column in Parade magazine,
it's a major part of being well read in America.
And I was about to become a part of it.
An aura of importance filled my soul faster
than Arsenio Hall kisses up to his first guest. I

was working in a building with an extremely
large clock on top it. I wondered if it came with
an alarm, and how the kids down at street at
Time would take to a little practical joke.
Throughout the next few weeks, the kindly
folks at Newsweek continued to foster my feel-

ings of self-import:
lunches with top
writers, meetings
with big name edi
tors, cookies with the
i editor-in-chief. It was
9 like the '80s, only
' without the Bloody
| Marys or Michael Eis
ner.
People all over the
city could tell I was
important. In the sub
ways, nobody dared to
look at me. If it rained,
guys in the street

didn't bother trying to ask for $5 for an umbrel
la. By my third week, I had the whole hepper
than-thou NYC attitude: I had no idea where
Elaine's was, but I knew they didn't cook their
fish well enough. It used to be when I saw
someone walking down the street, I would get
this pain in my stomach while I decided whether
to put on the Montel Williams face or fake a lit
tle gaseous smile and mumble M hey." And there's
nothing worse than going Montel and getting
"hey." Except maybe the other way around.
But now, there was no such decision. Only
tourists sported that fascinated, Mario
Thomasesque smile. Then they ask you for di
rections. I enjoyed getting really close to their

faces and yelling "They're numbered, you
moron, they're numbered." That's how confi
dent I felt.
As my confidence continued to grow like a
second grader's fish, and the march of time
began to make little, scary noises on the
Thornton-Wilder-removed fourth wall of my
cubicle, I noticed something.
All I did was read the newspaper. Every so
often I would head down to the library to make
sure Eagleburger was spelled correctly and not
like the middle-eastern dclicacy, but basically I
just sat there in my cubicle and read The New
York Times. By the end of my summer, I found
myself pretty attached to a woman I'd never
met named Maureen.
And even though all my bylines and "jour
nalism awards" and hours getting paid to watch
that Cindy Crawford workout video made the
summer rewarding, somewhere deep down I
wanted out of the Madison Avenue life. I want
ed out of the jacket, out of the tie, out of those
uncomfortable minutes in the elevator after
you've mumbled that "hey" to the person who
you know is on your floor, but you've never
met.
I'd rather be here at Stanford where 1 can
wear cut-off sweats and ask random women
which of my features they find most attractive,
without worrying about my job or my life.
But 1 do miss the power lunches.
Wickety wack.

But it wasn't like that at all. There were bal
loons and banners and a receiving line culmi

nating with one of those adorable, European,
double-cheek kisses from George Will. Well,
maybe not, but someone did compliment me
on my tie.
And they gave me a card. A card with my
picture on it. A card that they claimed would

open doors through
out the entire build
ing. Doors behind
which Jane Bryant
Quinn might lurk.
I felt important al
ready. They showed
me the library and
pointed out a file cabi
net bigger than the
FBl's. 1 immediately
looked up Heming
way and Steinbeck.
And then, when no
one was looking, I
looked up myself. I

wasn't there. Not even in the small files. I
vowed to change that, even if it meant a costly
lawsuit with Quinn.
But just as my ego was beginning to slip
down just a notch to Mary Matlin size, I was
sent down to my very own little cubicle in the
Periscope section. For those of you who don't
read the magazine, the Periscope section is the
area most people skim before going on to look
at all the pretty pictures. Along with the Mari
lyn Vos Savant column in Parade magazine,
it's a major part of being well read in America.
And I was about to become a part of it.
An aura of importance filled my soul faster
than Arsenio Hall kisses up to his first guest. I

was working in a building with an extremely
large clock on top it. I wondered if it came with
an alarm, and how the kids down at street at
Time would take to a little practical joke.
Throughout the next few weeks, the kindly
folks at Newsweek continued to foster my feel-

ings of self-import:
lunches with top
writers, meetings
with big name edi
tors, cookies with the
i editor-in-chief. It was
9 like the '80s, only
' without the Bloody
| Marys or Michael Eis
ner.
People all over the
city could tell I was
important. In the sub
ways, nobody dared to
look at me. If it rained,
guys in the street

didn't bother trying to ask for $5 for an umbrel
la. By my third week, I had the whole hepper
than-thou NYC attitude: I had no idea where
Elaine's was, but I knew they didn't cook their
fish well enough. It used to be when I saw
someone walking down the street, I would get
this pain in my stomach while I decided whether
to put on the Montel Williams face or fake a lit
tle gaseous smile and mumble M hey." And there's
nothing worse than going Montel and getting
"hey." Except maybe the other way around.
But now, there was no such decision. Only
tourists sported that fascinated, Mario
Thomasesque smile. Then they ask you for di
rections. I enjoyed getting really close to their

faces and yelling "They're numbered, you
moron, they're numbered." That's how confi
dent I felt.
As my confidence continued to grow like a
second grader's fish, and the march of time
began to make little, scary noises on the
Thornton-Wilder-removed fourth wall of my
cubicle, I noticed something.
All I did was read the newspaper. Every so
often I would head down to the library to make
sure Eagleburger was spelled correctly and not
like the middle-eastern dclicacy, but basically I
just sat there in my cubicle and read The New
York Times. By the end of my summer, I found
myself pretty attached to a woman I'd never
met named Maureen.
And even though all my bylines and "jour
nalism awards" and hours getting paid to watch
that Cindy Crawford workout video made the
summer rewarding, somewhere deep down I
wanted out of the Madison Avenue life. I want
ed out of the jacket, out of the tie, out of those
uncomfortable minutes in the elevator after
you've mumbled that "hey" to the person who
you know is on your floor, but you've never
met.
I'd rather be here at Stanford where 1 can
wear cut-off sweats and ask random women
which of my features they find most attractive,
without worrying about my job or my life.
But 1 do miss the power lunches.
Wickety wack.

The Tao to Nowhere
I'd never worn a tie for longer than five
hours at a stretch. No less one that wasn't
made of leather. But if that's what it was
going to take for fame, fortune and the chance
to catch Jane Bryant Quinn in various stages of
undress, then I was prepared to make the sac
rifice — even if it involved those annoying flo
ral prints.
It was 8 a.m. And I had bigger things to
worry about than which way to string my belt
through the loops, and whether it would be
different if I were in Australia.
I had this overwhelming fear — similar to,
but not quite the same as, that feeling right be
fore Bobby would shut the door to Sam's walk
in freezer — that Newsweek had forgotten
they'd hired me.
If you think about it, all I had to go on, real
ly, was this letter they sent me four months ear
lier. And although the "cc" thing looked con
vincing, there was a very real possibility it
never actually got any further than the secre
tary who wrote it.
My internship — if it ever existed in the first
place — was, by now, no doubt in the hands of
some serious college journalist who had done a
huge expos£ uncovering some primitive haz
ing ritual involving honey-roasted peanuts
and lower body hair.
The thought of explaining all this to the sec
retary made me more nervous than a woman
in a David Mamet play;
"Hi. I'm Joel Stein. I'm one of the summer
interns."
"Like hell you are."
But it wasn't like that at all. There were bal
loons and banners and a receiving line culmi

nating with one of those adorable, European,
