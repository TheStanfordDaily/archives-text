# Bookstore's board may broaden powers
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Members of the association
that has theoretical power over
the Stanford Bookstore will begin
considering today a proposed over
haul of the Bookstore's adminis
trative structure, already en
dorsed by its board of directors.
The revised by-laws would ex
pand the board, intensify its over
sight role and abolish the 36-mem
ber association, composed of Stan
ford faculty, staff and students.
The changes must be approved by
a majority of the association's
members, who have until Nov. 25
to cast their ballots.
If it approves the revised by
laws, the membership will in effect
be voting itself out of existence.

turning over all direction of the
store to the board.
The proposed reforms are simi
lar to those recommended last
May by an audit committee the
Bookstore commissioned to re
view its business practices.
That examination was prompted
by a report in The Daily in February
that the tax-exempt, non-profit
store was providing senior employ
ees with lavish perquisites unheard
of elsewhere in the college-book
store industry. The perquisites in
cluded use of cars, a motor home
and a vacation home that the store
rented from its top two managers.
Subsequent inquiries revealed
that the Bookstore had lost more
than $2 million of its reserve funds
in speculative equity investments
in recent years.

The disclosures also prompted
an investigation by the California
Attorney General. The ongoing in
vestigation entered a more formal
phase last month.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg,
who recently became the board's
interim president (see separate
story), said he expects the mem
bers to approve the reforms.
"I would be disappointed and
surprised if there appeared to be
opposition to this," Weisberg said.
In the months since disclosures
about the Bookstore's unusual
compensation practices surfaced,
many of those members have crit
icized the Bookstore's governance
structure, which vests the associ
ation with formal authority over
the store, but little opportunity to
monitor store operations.

According to Weisberg and sev
eral members, the association's
role consisted almost exclusively of
an annual dinner meeting at which
members elected a slate of directors
prepared for them by the board.
Several members publicly sup
ported abolition of the member
ship as early as last spring. Weis
berg said he has not received any
objections to the proposal.
The revised by-laws would also
significantly expand and empower
the board, which in the past con
sisted solely of Stanford faculty,
staff, and in some years, one or
two students
