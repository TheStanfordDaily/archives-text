Most of Meyer Library will remain closed
until Oct. '26 as it undergoes construction
that will produce a vastly reorganized li
brary. University officials said this week.
When Meyer reopens, only the first and
third floors will house books. The second
floor will contain the Language Laborato
ry, the Media Center and a computer clus
ter, and the fourth floor will house earth
quake-displaced Green Library staffers.
The only part of Meyer currently oj)en is
the second floor, which opened Monday.
Until construction is complete, students
can reach the second floor facilities by en
tering through the back door on the ground
level, where the old Language Lab was.
"We practically have to follow a trail of
bread to get here, but it is open," said
Kathy Fehrn, manager for Research and
Instructional Technology Support Group,
which includes the language Lab, Media
Center and several computer clusters.
All circulation and reference services
are located in Green until construction in
Meyer is complete, Fehrn said.
After Oct. 26, undergraduates will be re

stricted to using Green's reference ser
vices, while graduate students will use
Meyer reference, said Karen Nagy, director
of academic information services.
The changes are part of the library sys
tem's effort to cut its budget by about 25
percent this year.
"We scrambled all summer trying to get
this done before school started, but obvi
ously that didn't happen," Fehrn said.
The decision to move undergraduate
reference services to Green will not have
much impact, Nagy said, because most un
dergrads were using Green more often.
Because Green will now be dealing with
Meyer reference patrons in addition to its
own, the reference department will match
the number of staff and services to the ex
pected student needs, said Richard
Fitchen, head of Green reference services.
To insure continuity and efficiency of
service, two of Meyer's reference librarians
have become part of Green's permanent
reference staff and five new Folio termi
nals have been added.
An instructional area has been created
to acquaint users — especially Freshmen
English students — with the reference fa
cilities, Fitchen said.
