# Weisberg to head Bookstore board
## 
### Steve McCarroll Senior staff writer 
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg has
been elected interim president of
the Stanford Bookstore's board of
directors.
Weisberg, who has been the
board's spokesperson since Febru
ary, succeeds History Prof. Peter
Stansky, who resigned in Septem
ber. Stansky is currently at the
Stanford Program in Oxford.
Weisberg said he accepted the
position "with considerable reluc
tance" and on the condition that
he will be replaced by a full-term
president in December.

"I hope to cease being the
appointed spokesperson" at that
time as well, Weisberg said yester
day.
The board elected two new
members to fill the vacancies left
by the resignations of Stansky
and Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch.
The new members are Morton
Winston, a Los Angeles business
man with a background in law,
and William Lazier, a Menlo Park
businessman who has lectured in
the Law School and the Graduate
School of Business.
Winston served on the three
member audit committee commis

sioned by the Bookstore last spring
to review its business practices.
Both men have extensive expe
rience in business and business
law and have been directors of
other corporations. Their selection
is consistent with the audit com
mittee's recommendation that the
Bookstore receive stronger over
sight from directors more sea
soned in the financial affairs of
large corporations.
The board's two other mem
bers are Nancy Padgett, director
of finance for the School of
Humanities and Sciences, and
Agnes Peterson, a curator at the
Hoover Institution.
