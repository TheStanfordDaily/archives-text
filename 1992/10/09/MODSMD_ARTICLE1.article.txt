# Casper gives first speech to Fac Sen
## President outlines challenges in days to come, does not guarantee stability 
### Juthymas Harntha Peter Robison Senior staff writers 
For those who had expected his
arrival to bring Stanford automat
ic stability after the controversies
of the past few years, University
President Gerhard Casper is mak
ing no promises.
In his first address to the Fac
ulty Senate yesterday, Casper out
lined several of the challenges that
Stanford faces — from a thorny
relationship with the federal gov
ernment to a still-imposing bud
get deficit — and warned, "I can
promise you stability as little as I
can promise you no earthquakes."
Casper told the senate that he

will simply try "to guide the events
and policies with as steady a hand
as possible in the months to come."
While Casper said he has been
encouraged by an apparent warm
ing in the federal government's re
lations with Stanford, he remains
frustrated that negotiators have
not yet determined an indirect
cost rate for the current year.
He said he had expected to have
the rate finalized by this time, but
now hopes negotiations will be re
solved by the end of the month.
Nevertheless, he said the initial
letter he sent to Rear Adm.
William Miller, the chief of Naval
Research, was well-received.
"We have exchanged friendly
words, and we are certainly talking
to each other," Casper said.
But he warned that a tangle of
legal issues remain unresolved,
from Stanford's legal appeal to the
government's charge that the Uni
versity overbilled it by as much as
$300 million during the 1980s.
"In short," Casper said, "we are
far from being out of the woods."
The new president also
expressed concern over a federal
anti-discrimination law — which
will take effect Jan. 1,1994 — that
bans institutions from enforcing a
mandatory retirement age.
Stanford will have to comply
with the law, meaning that older
faculty members will be permitted
to stay on longer. By the end of the
decade, 10 percent of the Universi
ty's teaching faculty could be
between the ages of 70 and 80,
Casper said.
"No less than the survival of
places such as Stanford" are at
stake in coming up with mecha

nisms that encourage retirement,
he said.
If older faculty members stay
on longer, Casper added, it will
"literally add millions in costs to
Stanford" and make it much more
difficult to hire new professors.
Casper said he plans to appoint
a task force soon to recommend a
retirement incentive system.
Casper also emphasized in his
report the importance of monitor
ing Stanford's "institutional perfor
mance" in undergraduate teaching.
Casper said he did not doubt the
quality of teaching at Stanford —
"I'm not responding to anything I
see as a crisis" — but feared that
"our performance may in some
cases lag behind our aspirations."
After his report, a few faculty
members questioned Casper about
remarks he made on Tuesday in a
visit to Kimball Hall. Casper had
said that neither universities, nor
the people who represent them,
should take public positions on
political issues.
Doing so, he had said, endan
gers the university's neutral, inde
pendent position — and unfairly
suppresses those who disagree
with a particular point of view.

"The minute I would take a
position — or indeed, your profes
sors take a position — ... they are
ending the discussion" by silencing
those who disagree, he had said.
Asked by English Prof. Bliss
Carnochan to clarify his remarks,
Casper said that faculty members
have "every right" to take political
positions and "help shape the val
ues of society."
But he added, "You can do that
only if you take positions... as cit
izens, not in our role as faculty
members."
Casper was also asked about his
position on last spring's advertise
ment condemning the Rodney
King verdict, signed by 700 faculty
and staff, that appeared in The
New York Times.
He had said Tuesday that he
has "real reservations" about it,
and he reiterated his discomfort
with it yesterday.
Although faculty members
signed in their individual capacity,
he said he feared that the point
"communicated to the world" was
that it spoke for the Stanford fac
ulty as a whole.
"These are delicate calls to
make at times," he said.
