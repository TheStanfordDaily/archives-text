## President outlines challenges in days to come, does not guarantee stability 
### Juthymas Harntha Peter Robison Senior staff writers 
For those who had expected his
arrival to bring Stanford automat
ic stability after the controversies
of the past few years, University
President Gerhard Casper is mak
ing no promises.
In his first address to the Fac
ulty Senate yesterday, Casper out
lined several of the challenges that
Stanford faces — from a thorny
relationship with the federal gov
ernment to a still-imposing bud
get deficit — and warned, "I can
promise you stability as little as I
can promise you no earthquakes."
Casper told the senate that he

will simply try "to guide the events
and policies with as steady a hand
as possible in the months to come."
While Casper said he has been
encouraged by an apparent warm
ing in the federal government's re
lations with Stanford, he remains
frustrated that negotiators have
not yet determined an indirect
cost rate for the current year.
He said he had expected to have
the rate finalized by this time, but
now hopes negotiations will be re
solved by the end of the month.
Nevertheless, he said the initial
letter he sent to Rear Adm.
William Miller, the chief of Naval
Research, was well-received.
