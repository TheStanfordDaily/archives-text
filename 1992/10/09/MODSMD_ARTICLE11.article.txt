NEW ORLEANS (AP) — President Bush com
plained yesterday that the rule in politics this
year is "be ugly, be nasty, everything goes."
Bush said also that most Americans think that
"we've got it worse" than other countries in
terms of the ailing economy. However, Bush said
the world was gripped in a global economic slow
down and that any other country "would trade
with us in a minute."
Bill Clinton, meanwhile, joined his debate
preparation team at a hotel in Kansas City, Mo.,
where he canceled two public appearances yester
day and another today in an effort to preserve his
voice for the debate Sunday in St. Louis.
"I'm just going to try to hole up in my room
and read my briefing books and get my voice

back," Clinton said.
