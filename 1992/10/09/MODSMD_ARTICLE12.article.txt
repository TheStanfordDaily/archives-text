signed by singer Crystal Gayle and Bob Denver,

briefs and other underwear over their clothing.

Bomb blasts rock London
LONDON (AP) — Two car bombs exploded in
central London last night, a day after two bombs
planted by the Irish Republican Army went off in
the city's theater district.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for
yesterday's blasts. But the IRA said it set off the
two small bombs Wednesday to coincide with this
week's conference of the ruling Conservative
Party in the southern coast city of Brighton.
One person was treated for shock after the first
explosion yesterday, officials at nearby Guy's
Hospital said. There were no immediate reports of
injuries in the second attack.
