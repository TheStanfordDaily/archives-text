# U.N. restricts Serbian flights
## Shooting planes not allowed; U.S. to send military hospital

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Security Coun
cil is expected today to approve a ban on military
flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina aimed at
grounding Serbian warplanes, diplomats said.
But the council will not immediately authorize
military action against the aircraft, they said.
"This will be a two-step process," said British
Ambassador Sir David Hannay. Today's resolution

calls for U.N. officials to monitor flights. A second
resolution would be needed to authorize the shoot
ing down of aircraft violating the "no-fly" zone.
It is not yet known when the air-exclusion zone
will go into effect, and no date was specified in the
resolution.
The United States initially had pressed for imme
diate military enforcement of the zone, but Britain
and France argued for the two-stage approach,
because enforcement could have prompted Serb
attacks on U.N. peacekeepers and aid convoys.
The United States, unlike Britain and France,
currently has no peacekeeping troops on the ground
in the region.
The resolution says the council "decides to estab
lish a ban on military flights in the airspace of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, this ban not to apply to U.N. Pro
tection Force (peacekeeping) flights or to other flights
in support of U.N. operations, including humanitari
an assistance."
It calls establishment of a ban on military flights
essential for distribution of humanitarian assistance
and crucial to cessation of hostilities.
It will be the first time the council has imposed
such a zone.
In Iraq, the United States, Britain and France
acted independently in August to impose a flight ban
below the 32nd parallel to protect Shiite Muslims
from attack by the Iraqi government planes.
The Serbs have 40 aircraft, left when the
Yugoslav federal army withdrew earlier this year.
The Bosnian government forces have none.
In other news from the embattled area, U.S. offi
cials pledged to provide a military field hospital as
part of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia-Herze
govina yesterday.
The hospital, to be staffed by up to 300 Ameri
cans, is the first contribution of U.S. personnel to
the U.N. Protection Force in the breakaway
Yugoslav republic, U.N. officials said.
President Bush has resolved not to send U.S.
troops into the line of fire.
