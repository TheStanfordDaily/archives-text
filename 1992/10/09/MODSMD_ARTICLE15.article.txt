## Remember the Row 
### 
Row residences should
receive benefits from
campus upgrading, too

AS THE UNIVERSITY con
tinues to wade through the
turbulent waters of the
recent budget crisis, Residential
Computing should be applauded
for its recent efforts to update the
campus' major residential clusters.
No more than 15 years ago, per
sonal computing existed on a rela
tively primitive level. The technol
ogy confounded all but the most
knowledgeable, while the exorbi
tant costs associated with owning
and operating even modest units
isolated practically all consumers
save large companies.
Today, students are concerned
not so much with understanding
computers, but rather having
access to the most advanced mod
els of computers and printers.
By making $420,000 worth of
needed improvements to residential
clusters across the campus, Resi
dential Computing has proven its
commitment to servicing a major
need of the student body.
Nonetheless, Residential Com
puting should be careful not to
mistake the improvements imple
mented in some larger dorms as a
comprehensive modification of the
entire campus. Instead, it should
improve clusters which are most in
need.
Of the more than 30 residences
that make up the Row, only seven
have working computer centers for
student use. For residents without
clusters, the only options are the
larger clusters housed in Meyer
Library, Terman Library or
Tresidder Union.
Because Row clusters consist of
only two computers and a printer,
even residents fortunate enough to
live in houses equipped with clus
ters often have to use the Meyer
and Tresidder facilities.
The average Row house holds

30 to 60 students. A couple of com
puters and a printer can't possibly
be expected to adequately serve so
many residents.
This inequality, explains Resi
dential Computing, is due to the
previously administered practice
of servicing the needs of incoming
freshmen, who live either in all
freshmen or four-class dorms. In
fact, a major force in the initial
installation of dorm clusters was
the Freshmen English Depart
ment, which sought to establish
the resource specifically for incom
ing students.
Any benefit to upperclass stu
dents from this arrangement
seems to have been almost coinci
dental.
Though the system is no longer
intentionally set up to concentrate
only on the needs of freshmen,
Residential Computing continues
to prioritize the needs of large
dorms ahead of the Row mainly
because the overall costs involved
in supplying every Row house with
a working cluster far exceeds the
costs of servicing regular dorms.
And now as Residential Com
puting attempts to bring the entire
campus up to the same level over
an extended period of eight years,
it recognizes the inequity of the
situation yet offers no short-term
solutions to the problem, suggest
ing instead that Row residents uti
lize the campus' larger computing
facilities.
The issue at hand is linked to
the false assumption that not all
students are entitled to University
services, that a student who choos
es the setting of a Row residence —
or any other residence not
equipped with a cluster— must
voluntarily surrender his or her
right to use residence computing
facilities.
This is not an acceptable alter
native. The University should take
more care to include all students in
its plans for future student com
puter service. New funds must be
used to step up its program to serve
those who need improvements
most, those in the Row houses.
