## Scooby: destroyer of 'values' 
### 
SINCE LAST SPRING, Dan
Quayle's attacks on Murphy Brown
have raised the question of the val
ues and attitudes portrayed on television.
What sort of role models are the chil
dren of this country being exposed to,
and, more importantly, what values are
they being led to believe are "acceptable"?
I think Murphy Brown represents a
major step forward from the television
characters we had as heroes in our child
hood.
Take a close look at the cast of "Scoo
by Doo." They were a group of meddling
high school drop-outs who toured the
country in their "Mystery Mobile," cram
ming down untold amounts of hallucino
gens (Scooby Snacks) while looking for
ghostly apparitions to help pass the time.
While Fred, and Daphne tested out the
shocks in the back of the van, Thelma
wandered about alone, descending from
genius to half-wit boob with every drop of
her glasses.
Shaggy, the hairy, unkempt protago
nist of the show, staggered about in a
daze, talking to his pet dog t making two
foot sandwiches to satisfy his "munchies"
and running from the ghouls of his drug
induced paranoia.
In academic studies, young Americans
consistently lag behind youths of other
countries in the fields of math and engi
neering. Much finger-pointing goes on in
an attempt to explain the problem. I see

one dominant cause: "the Flintstones."
While foreign kids studied, we sat at
home watching Fred, dressed to the nines
in a leopard-skin muumuu, stopping cars
with his feet, playing records with small
birds and vacuuming with a tiny elephant.
George Bush attempted to trace the
roots of the L.A. riots back to F.D.R. and
L.B.J.
I see a much more likely cause: the
Dukes of Hazard. Bo and Luke glorified a
blatant disregard for the law, running
illegal substances, driving recklessly and
breaking out of jail on a regular basis.
Boss Hogg and Roscoe P. Coltrane
were portrayed as bad guys for attempt
ing to protect the citizens of Hazard from
menacing hooligans with a penchant for
jumping cars over exploding bridges, yee
hawing while senselessly destroying pub
lic property.
Uncle Jesse foreshadowed the current
savings and loan disaster, wandering
about his tumbledown shack in nothing
but soiled overalls, half-blind from cheap
moonshine, and taking out loan after
loan just to stay afloat.
"Sesame Street," perhaps as much as
any other television programming, has
the power to shape young minds.
Oscar the Grouch told kids it was
acceptable to live in a garbage can and
hurl obscenities at innocent passersby,
while the Count repeatedly stressed
materialism and the importance of quan

tity over quality.
While the rate of obesity in young chil
dren skyrocketed, Cookie Monster con
tinued to shape our dietary habits, insist
ing that children eschew fruits and veg
etables for lard-filled cookies and treats.
"The Incredible Hulk" glorified men
tal instability and temporary insanity.
"The Love Boat" eagerly depicted
frivolous relationships and meaningless
sex on the high seas.
"Stop that Pigeon," encouraged chil
dren to kill animals. "Mr. Magoo" taught
kids to play in dangerous construction
areas. "Bosom Buddies" showed the joys
of cross-dressing.
Mr. Rourke lived on a deserted island
with his male companion, a dwarf named
Tattoo, promising the realization of any
one's wildest fantasy in return for a hefty
sum of money.
Murphy Brown had a child out of wed
lock. You decide which is worse.

Peter Huyck is a senior majoring in
"dance." He is soliciting suggestions for a
substance to rub on his hair and face for
his photo. Call him at 7-6632. If he uses
your substance, you win a prize. His col
umn will appear here on Fridays.
