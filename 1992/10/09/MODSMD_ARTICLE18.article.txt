Anderson criticized without knowing the real facts

Hoover institution Fellow
Martin Anderson claims surprise
at my "impromptu review of [his]
latest book." He is referring, I suppose,
to my comments on teaching.
Let's be accurate. I have indeed read
"Impostors in the Temple." But my
attempt to question the premise of the
genre that might be called attacks-on
classroom-teachers-by-those-who-do-
not-teach — and that includes
"Imposters" — could hardly be called a
book review by anyone other than an
offended author.
The issue is neither Anderson nor his
book. The issue is teaching. Is teaching
being carried out by impostors? Ander
son's technique is to dismiss the fact
that Stanford professors attend a vari
ety of pedagogy forums, established by
Dean Ewart Thomas and others, by ask
ing, "Then why are all the Freshmen
English courses being taught and grad
ed this fall by graduate students?"
His query is not logical. Further
more, the inaccuracy of his ire is disin
genuous. Many of his claims are based
on what is known in libel law as "false
facts."
Anderson's question, "Then why are
all Freshmen English courses ..." has

nothing to do with my statement that
dozens of Stanford teachers are working
to improve their classroom teaching
skills.
It is argument without substance or
logic. It is what magicians refer to as
misdirection. The only magic in Ander
son's swipe at Freshmen English is the
thin air from which he pulls his "facts"
about teaching.
All Freshmen English teachers are
graduate students? Six professors are
teaching Freshmen English at Stanford
this year. Three are full professors. Two
are former deans. One is an experimen
tal novelist with an international repu
tation.
Furthermore, many of those teaching
Freshmen English who are not profes
sors are lecturers — women and men
whose professional careers are dedicat
ed to teaching composition.
As English Prof. Ken Fields told
me, many lecturers have doctorates.
Some have written one or more text
books.
Lecturers attend conferences in the
latest theory and practice of composi
tion and share their skills and caring in
a community of writers and scholars.
Anderson is not completely misin-

formed. There are graduate students
teaching Freshmen English. By the
time they do so, however, they have
already attended a series of first year
pedagogy laboratories run by the
English Department.
They have served in their second
year of doctoral study as apprentices
to department faculty who mentor
them in teaching. Guided by seasoned
writing teachers, Fields told me, the
graduate students observe, then
undertake supervised grading and
teaching with increasing amounts of
responsibility.
Is the English Department alone in
adequately preparing graduate students
to teach? Substantive pedagogy in the
form of seminars and workshops exist
in anthropology, art, communication,
history, political science and elsewhere.
Are impostors teaching? Facts sug
gest otherwise.
Does the presence of graduate stu
dents in Anderson's temple threaten the
profession of teaching? Not as long as
the faculty and their graduate students
take their responsibilities seriously. The
evidence suggests they do.
Does my statement that "there is
room for a great deal of improvement"

mean, as Anderson infers, "that things
aren't so good?" Only by the tortured
logic of politicized attack analysis. Most
of us realize that quality requires con
stant striving.
"Poor T.S. Eliot, to be subjected to
such quotation abuse," Anderson says
of my commentary. Given the accuracy
of my Eliot quotation and the appropri
ateness of its use as a trope, the abuse I
see is Anderson's creation of false facts
and his disregard of the logical consis
tency the majority of faculty require of
their students.
Anderson's final technique is to ques
tion the validity of my commentary by
claiming "Cohen misspells the title of
my book." Half truths have a long and
ruthless history in the dehumanizing
language of attack analysis. Yes the title
was misspelled incorrectly in the com
mentary — but not because Cohen mis
spelled it.
A simple check of my original copy
indicates that the use of an "e" instead of
an "o" was a Daily typo. No doubt the
result of impostors at the copy editing
desk.
