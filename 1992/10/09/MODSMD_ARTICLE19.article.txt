# Hiring minority faculty: Daily looked to for all the answers on policy
## 
### 
I was much taken by your open letter
Oct. 2 to President Casper on his inau
guration day.
I was particularly interested in the
paragraph which asked an important
question: "How can the University
diversify its faculty without sacrificing
merit-based appointments? Although
. Stanford recently admitted its most

diverse freshman class in history, these
students will be taught by a faculty that
is still overwhelmingly white and male."
I think it would be most helpful to
President Casper and to the Stanford
community to learn how the Stanford
Daily deals with the problem of merit
based appointments.
For example, from a reading of first
names in your masthead I would judge
that 13 staff members are male, nine are
female, two hard-to-figure gender. Most
males seem to be white. Was your staff
selected on the basis of merit or were
other criteria included?
The editor-in-chief is a white Jewish

female. Was she selected on merit or
merit plus cultural origin?
Do you run over the list of candidates
at selection times and agree that this
year the editor ought to be an Asian or
an African or white European male and
make the appropriate selection from the
appropriate category?
I think you ought to tell the Stanford
community and the new president l\ow
you handle the problem of diversity
without, I hope, sacrificing merit
appointments.
