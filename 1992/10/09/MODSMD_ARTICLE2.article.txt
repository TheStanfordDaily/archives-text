# 'Disease of racism' discussed at forum

### Neerad Lal Michael Slemmer 
Ways to foster racial unity were
addressed last night in the Main
Quad as more than 200 people
gathered to hear speakers from
both the University and the feder
al government.
"Doctors talk about a cure for
cancer. We must do the same for the
spiritual disease of racism," said Dr.
Robert Henderson, a member of the
federal commission on the Martin
Luther King, Jr. holiday.
The forum, sponsored by the
Stanford Baha'i Association, also
featured speeches by Dean of Stu
dents Michael Jackson and Assoc.
Dean of the Chapel Diana Akiyama.

Henderson, who is also secre
tary-general of the U.S. Baha'i
Community, emphasized human
kindness as a way to improve race
relations.
He discussed the importance of
individual efforts through various
anecdotes, stressing that "racial
unity is the result of the initiative
of individuals who refuse conflict
and assert the right to unite with
different groups."
"The point of race unity," Hen
derson continued, "is not toler
ance and is not laws, but is to in
spire a love and unity that will per
severe despite obstacles. When we
achieve [racial] harmony, it will
last eternally."
The Rodney King incident
and the resulting riots were sim
ply a manifestation of disunity,
Henderson said.
"All too often we deal with
disunity and not unity," he said.
"We must deal with two
aspects of racial unity," he

explained. "One is the eradica
tion of racism and the other is
the establishment of the unity of
races and the oneness of human
ity."
Jackson spoke of developing
the University community in
ways that foster racial harmony.
"Universities must be cru
cibles where future leaders come
together to understand one
another. Our institutions cannot
and must not shirk from this
responsibility," Jackson said.

"The university is one of the
unique places where people can
share beliefs and issues without
outside pressures.
"When I came here in 1968,
less than 100 of the 13,000 stu
dents here were of color. . . .
Today, students of color repre
sent 46 percent of the under
graduate population," he said.
Jackson pointed out that the
increase in diversity on the Stan
ford campus allows students to
learn about racial understanding

and take that knowledge into
society.
At the beginning of the pro
gram, Akiyama briefly touched
upon the spiritual aspects of
racial harmony. "Without spiri
tual unity we are not one. We
need to be diverse, inclusive and
loving communities."
The one disappointment for
the crowd was the failure of Rep.
Tom Lantos, D-San Mateo, to
attend. No explanation was
given for his unexpected cancel

lation.
The event was held to com
memorate the 80th anniversary
of Abdu'l-Baha's visit to Stan
ford.
The son of the Baha'i Faith's
founder, Baha introduced the
faith to Stanford, expressing at
the time of his 1912 visit "the
importance of discovery and pro
duction of knowledge and of dis
covering the reality about
things."
