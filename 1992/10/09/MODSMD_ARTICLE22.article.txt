■ Top of page: An early riser, President Casper likes to be in his
Building 10 office by 7 a.m. to get some precious quiet work time
before the day begins. As a result, he rises around 5 a.m. After a bite
to eat, he can usually be found on his back porch, scanning the
day's headlines. ■ Above: Provost Gerald Lieberman instructs
Casper on the fundamentals of football on the sidelines of Stanford
Stadium. Lieberman says Casper, who has spent spare time reading
books about the game, is a "fast learner." ■ Above right: When not
on the sidelines, the president gets to view the game from a 50-yard
line pressbox seat. ■ Right: Casper and his wife, Dr. Regina
Casper, enjoy a morning stroll through their Hoover House garden.
Both say the garden behind the house is one of their favorite parts
of the residence. ■ Bottom right: Pausing for a moment to think,
Casper conducts a telephone Interview with Die Welt, a German
newspaper. Several German papers have requested to interview
Casper in the last few weeks. ■ Left: Although usually formal in
demeanor, Casper does have a penchant for humor. Caught at an
unguarded moment in his office, he reacts in amazement to some
thing Lieberman tells him.
