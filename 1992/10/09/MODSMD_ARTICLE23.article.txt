## Versatile Lynch leaves QB spot to shine on defense 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
Last autumn, the name John Lynch pricked the
ears of only the most acute Cardinal boosters. For
the baseball fan, he was a sporadically used desig
nated hitter and a pitcher who had thrown a mere
20 innings in his Stanford career. For the football
fan, he was a quarterback mired in former head
coach Denny Green's depth chart and facing anoth
er year on the sidelines.
Now he's Lynch Mob, the star free safety nick
named by his team for his fierce hits and known by
millions for spearheading the Cardinal victory over
Notre Dame last Saturday.
Things haven't always gone this well for Lynch.
The turning point was, ironically, the moment last
August when he chose to abandon the dream of
becoming Stanford's starting quarterback.
"When you're heavily recruited, it makes you
believe you're a world-beater," Lynch said. "I day
dreamed about starting as a true freshman, so when
I got here and had to learn a new, complex system —
it's a reality check."
After two years spent watching the games, Lynch
felt the burning need to play. The team was improv
ing rapidly and he wanted to get into some games,
so he took the initiative.
"I never felt when I was the backup that I was
contributing," he said. "I really wanted to play so I
just went up to coach Green and asked if there was
any place I could get on the field."
Lynch has been playing football since the third
grade, and credits his parents as the biggest influ
ence for him athletically. His father played lineback
er for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1969.
"Whenever you decide to do something, you've
got to do it 100 percent," he said. "That's what he
always told me."
Lynch has followed his father's advice. At Torrey
Pines High School in Solano Beach, California,
Lynch played both quarterback and safety. Before
the 1991 season, he made the switch to defense and
found himself starting at strong safety as the Cardi
nal opened the year against Washington.
"It helps having played quarterback," Lynch said
of the switch. "Because I know how the quarterback
is seeing the field."
Last year, Lynch only started two games and saw
limited playing time the rest of the year. This sea
son he has moved from strong safety to free safety
and has started every game.
Given that Lynch is a former quarterback, his
hard-hitting style seems a bit unusual. He blends an
old-fashioned, knock-down attitude with a quarter
back's feel for the game into his own football philos
ophy.
"I like hitting," he said. "For me, there's nothing
better. It's a rough sport but that's how I like to
play. I think you can play both smart and aggres
sive. Never be tentative, that's what I like to tell

myself."
Everything came together for Lynch this past
Saturday in South Bend.
On the first play of the second half, despite play
ing with a mild concussion incurred earlier, he hit
Jerome Bettis so hard that he caused the Fighting
Irish's fullback to fumble, eventually leading to a
Cardinal touchdown.
Later in the half, with Notre Dame threatening
to erase a 20-16 Cardinal lead, Lynch intercepted
a pass in the end zone and returned it 24 yards to
defuse the Irish drive and preserve the advantage.
In addition to the interception, he finished with
nine tackles and was named player of the game,
winning him instant national recognition.
Although the significance of the game and of his
performance are enough to make a season, Lynch
downplays the situation. "That was a huge game for
us," he acknowledged. "But it doesn't mean any
thing if we don't get a win this week."
Perhaps the most amazing and ironic element of
his blossoming as a football player is that the same
thing has happened on the baseball field. Although
he assumed the starting role as a designated hitter
in the second half of last season, he didn't appear to
be a hot major league prospect.
But the Florida Marlins, one of baseball's two
expansion teams due to begin playing next spring,
didn't agree. They selected him in the second round
of the draft as a pitcher, a position he has not played
regularly since high school.
"A lot of scouts remembered me from high
school," he said. "They drafted me on potential. I
can throw hard and that's what they love to see."
This summer, Lynch played with one of the Mar
lins' minor league franchises. In fact, his name has
been enshrined in the baseball Hall of Fame as the
first person to pitch for the Florida Marlins organi
zation.
Lynch plans to go to spring training no matter
what happens in football this season. But he does
admit that he has thought of trying to become the
next two-sport pro athlete.
"I've got a great opportunity with the Marlins
organization," he said. "But there's an interesting
football side now."
Right now, this decision is the furthest thing
from Lynch's mind as he and his team prepare to
face UCLA tomorrow.
Unlike the Fighting Irish, the Bruins tend to
throw the ball as often as they run, meaning Lynch
will be involved in a lot more pass coverage.
"We're facing a more complex, pro-style offense
this week," he said. "It's a different challenge."
The way he and the rest of the defense have been
playing this year, it seems to be a challenge the Car
dinal can handle.
They should be able to contain the Bruins
enough so that the offense, if it plays like it did in
the second half last week, can score enough points
to win and improve Stanford's record to 5-1.

Along with his starring role on the Cardinal football defense, John Lynch is also a hot prospect as a
pitcher for the Florida Marlins franchise. Lynch hopes to repeat last week's stellar South Bend perfor
mance tomorrow against UCLA.
