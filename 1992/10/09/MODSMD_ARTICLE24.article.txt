# VB leaves roar of Maples for quiet Arizona Cardinal comes off UCLA loss to play Arizona, ASU
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
Last weekend, the Stanford
women's volleyball team demon
strated why other Pac-10 teams
hate to play in Maples Pavilion.
Over 5,000 noisy Cardinal fans
packed Maples Pavilion Saturday
evening to watch Stanford come
within two points of upsetting
top-ranked UCLA in a five-game
thriller. Add to that the nearly
2,000 spectators that watched
Stanford down USC Friday night,
and that adds up to a throbbing
headache for Cardinal opponents.
Stanford should find itself in
somewhat quieter surroundings

this Friday and Saturday when it
travels to Tucson to take on the
University of Arizona and then to
Tempe where the Cardinal will
face Arizona State. Stanford (9-1,
3-1 in Pacific 10 Conference play),
the defending Pac-10 champion,
suffered its first Pac-10 loss in two
years on Saturday.
"A lot of people were calling
this (UCLA) team the best in the
history of collegiate women's vol
leyball," said Stanford head coach
Don Shaw.
Shaw, however, does not think
the Bruins are unbeatable. "I can
tell you that if our execution had
been any better, we would have
won. They won't get the champi

onship handed to them, they'll
have to earn it, and UCLA is a
team that's always in the back of
our minds."
Stanford will get another shot
at the defending national champi
on Bruins on Oct. 30 in Los Ange
les, but this weekend the Cardi
nal's main concern will be getting
by Arizona and Arizona State.
"Every team in the Pac-10 is
capable of beating us," said Shaw.
"We need to work on getting the high
level of intensity we had against
UCLA in every game we play, no
matter who it is on the other side of
the net. We have confidence now
that we can play at that level, the
task is to get that on a regular basis."

our execution had
been any better, we
would have won.
They won't get the
championship hand
ed to them'
— Don Shaw

Specifically, Shaw notes that
the Cardinal will need to perform
well offensively to win against Ari
zona and Arizona State. "Our exe
cution has to be there when the
ball's on our side of the net," said
Shaw. "When we have the ball, we
put ourselves in a better position
to score."
Stanford will travel to Arizona
behind the sizzling play of Bev
Oden, Kristi Paaso and Jennifer
Jackson. Oden rang up a com
bined 32 kills, 10 blocks and four
aces against USC and UCLA,
while Paaso tallied 25 kills, 23 digs
and four blocks against the Los
Angeles teams. Senior Jennifer
Jackson also poured in 10 kills
and 11 digs for the Cardinal in
Friday's game against USC.
After Stanford's road trip
through Arizona this weekend, the
Cardinal will return to campus to
begin a six-game home stand,
starting with the Big Match
against California on Oct. 13. That
match should help to continue the
resurgence of Maples Madness
this year; after last weekend's
matches against USC and UCLA,
Stanford now boasts the second
largest average attendance in the
nation at home games.
"It's a tremendous advantage
when you take the court and you
hear 5,000 fans just roar," Shaw
said. "It definitely helps knowing
we have six games coming up at
home, but we need to keep getting
good crowds for that to be an
advantage for us."
With wins this weekend in Ari
zona, the Cardinal should have lit
tle problem convincing future
opponents that Maples Pavilion is
the last place they want to be.
