# Women look to upset Tar Heels at invite
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
The rematch has been a long
time coming. Three years after
an unheralded Stanford
women's soccer team stunned
the collegiate soccer world with
a scoreless tie of top-ranked
North Carolina, the two squads
meet again in a battle of the
No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the
countiy.
The 4 p.m. match on Mon
day is the feature contest of the
Cardinal Bank of America Invi
tational held at Maloney Field
tomorrow through Oct. 12. Sec
ond-ranked Stanford hosts a
scrimmage with Brigham
Young tomorrow at 10 a.m.
However, the Cougar match
will probably be no more than a
warm-up for the Cardinal. The
real test will be the Tar Heels, a
team lightening-quick on
offense and defense.
"They're really direct," said
Stanford coach Berhane Ande
berhan. "They get the ball as
quickly as possible to their for
wards and into the goal."
The talent-laden North Car
olina squad not only has won
the last six NCAA titles but
also boasts two national team
starters in Mia Hamm and
Kristine Lilly. The 11-0 Tar
Heels, winners of 44-straight
games, return a total seven
starters from last year's cham
pionship squad.
Of course, Stanford (9-0)
counters with quite a few high
ly regarded players, including
national team starter, Julie
Foudy. The senior midfielder

expects a tough match from the
experienced Tar Heels.
"They play a very high pres
sure defense which means they
play very tight," she said.
"They keep going hard and
fast; they also like to double up
on people.
"(The key] is to deflate their
pressure defense. A lot of teams
panic and give them the ball. If
we can keep the ball and our
composure, then we can frus
trate them."
However, that task will not
be an easy one, as coach Ande
berhan realizes.
"I still think they're
stronger (than we are)," he
said. "They're solid every
where. They can afford to have
a national caliber player on the
bench, which is what happened
the last time we played."
That match, back in 1989,
marked the emergence of Stan
ford as an elite program. Led by
a stingy defense, the unranked
Cardinal stayed with North
Carolina the whole game. And
when the buzzer signaled the
end of the contest the Stanford
players jubilantly celebrated.
Although the styles of that
Cardinal squad and this year's
team are similar, both Ande
berhan and Foudy recognize
differences from years past.
Andeberhan said the 1989
Cardinal played more intense
team defense, something he'd
like to see from the current
members.
"This team is becoming a
better defensive team," he said.
