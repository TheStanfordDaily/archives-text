# Cardinal soccer looks for shutout
## 
### Kathryn Yang 
After dropping two games to
George Washington University
and the University of South Flori
da in the Bank of America Invita
tional last weekend, the Stanford
men's soccer squad is looking to
rebound against conference rival
Oregon State University this Sun
day at Maloney Field.
This will be a crucial confronta
tion for both the Cardinal (6-4-0,
1-1 conference) and the Beavers
(7-3-0, 1-1) as both teams need to
produce perfect records from here
on out in order to secure a berth in
the conference playoffs and the
NCAA Tournament.
The two teams play vastly con
trasting forms of soccer as Stan
ford prefers short passing plays
controlled by its midfielders,
while Oregon leans toward a very
open game characterized by long
passes and tight defense.
"Oregon is very strong on
defense because they don't nor
mally score a lot of goals," said
coach Colin Lindores. "So we are
basically looking to score early
and then shut them out with our
backfield."
This week the Cardinal back
field will be reinforced by the
much-anticipated return of
sophomore sweeper Jeff Kogl who
was out for one week with liga
ment damage.
"Jeff makes an enormous dif
ference on this team," said senior
co-captain and goalkeeper Kyle
Krpata. "Lately we've just been
giving up too many goals on
defense, and it's really frustrat
ing, considering more than half
those goals were gifts. Even with
Jeff back we have to cut down on
our mistakes in the backfield."
On the offensive end, the Car
dinal is also welcoming the return
of midfielder Randy Mann who
served a one-game suspension last
weekend after being red carded

against George Washington Uni
versity.
"Randy [Mann] is vital in our
attack because we play through
the midfield, which requires good
ball control and tight passes,"
Lindores said.
Also, in an effort to jump start
a Stanford offense that was shut
out for the second time last week
end, the Cardinal's leading scorer,
Jason Vanacour (five goals and
one assist), will be moved into the
midfield where he will get more
scoring opportunities.
Lindores will also rely heavily
on forward Carmen D'Onofrio
and midfielders Ryan Collins and
Lance Killian to shoulder the
scoring on offense.
Opposing them will be a strong
Oregon State front line led by for
ward Kevin Mills with five goals
and midfielder Sean Young with
four goals. Dishing the ball off to
those top scorers will be senior
midfielder Chris Scotti, who is
tied for the assist lead in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion with seven.
Looking at their upcoming
match, Krpata said, "It's just a
matter of getting back on track
right now. I'm sure that no one
anticipated us starting out the
way we did, especially at home.
"In the future we are looking
for better games from our [for
wards] and more shutouts from
our backfield," Lindores said.
After the game against Oregon
State this weekend, the Cardinal
will still have 10 of their remain
ing 11 games at Maloney Field.
Due to some shuffling in the Car
dinal's new conference they will
host all their games except for the
October 16 meeting against Cali
fornia, at Berkeley.
Last season they went unde
feated on their home turf, and
they will need a similar streak if
they hope to go to the NCAA
Tournament this year as well.
