Streaking naked down the mountain like
Apollo and his sidekick Pan, the Greeks return
to make their often inaccurate and sometimes
uncannily similar predictions for the football
weekend.
Joining the Hellenics this week is recently
appointed chief-of-staff Jean Fetter. Wielding
her Bakeresque powers in the Casper adminis
tration, Fetter pulled some strings to appear
among the true Macedonians.
Dean Jean hopes to parlay her knack for
forecasting future success out of gawky, der
matalogically challenged 17-year-olds into foot
ball predictions.
She will be riding last week's successful
eight-and-two run by dean of students Michael
Jackson. Let's just say the two of them work
very closely together.

Co-sports editors Tish Williams and Andy
Eiser pulled through last week, each going
nine-and-one on their picks, while football beat
writer and sports columnist Kevin Jeffeiy went
a pathetic five-and-five. And Mike Langford,
self-proclaimed matchmaker of Branner Hall,
will be filling in for co-Cardinal Today editor
Amy Howard.
"But," this week's question asks, "are they
truly Greeks?"
A bit of pedagogy is needed to answer that
question. No, none of our Greeks are truly
Greek in the sense of lineage, but in sexual
practice, haven't we all been Greek at some
time or another?
And, more importantly, we all recognize the
similarities between the world of college foot
ball and the democracy Athens created for the
Western world to enjoy and toss away at a whim
every time a guy with lots of money and a funny
accent wants to interfere.

The comparisons between football and the
town meetings established by the Greeks —
and later modernized by H. Ross Perot — are,
in fact, strikingly Greek. For what can be more
American than a name like Vinnie Testaverde,
and, likewise, what could be a more American
notion than a bunch of crotchety, 90-year old
New Englanders voting not to give any money
to fund public education?
So, yes, Virginia, and, yes, Michigan, we are
Greeks. And we'll defend our rights to be
Greeks regardless of any racial slurs we might
utter on national television.
Grab a beer, a dormmate and a whole hunk
of misplaced American values and settle down
to watch democracy in action as a smaller man
with big ears yells directions to force a bunch of
larger men to hit each other. Sometimes, it's
almost better than Operation Desert Storm.
Keep in mind, none of us got any money rid
ing on any of this.
