# Water Polo out for respect against USC, UCLA
## 
### Sam Wu 
In order to keep in stride
with No. I California, Stan
ford's second-ranked water polo
team will need to win back-to
back away games against No. 3
USC on Friday and No. 6 UCLA
on Saturday.
The two conference games
are not only vital for the Cardi
nal in terms of national stand
ings, but also bear great psy
chological importance, accord
ing to Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti.
First of all, Cardinal wins
would remove any doubts in
its future opponents' minds of
its legitimacy not only the
Pacific 10 Conference, but also
one of the very finest in the
country.
"With a young team like
UCLA for instance, if you let
them think they can beat you,
you're going to have to fight for
your life," Dettamanti said.
Secondly, Stanford feels it
has something to prove to itself.
"We're not great yet," Detta
manti said. "We have to win
these two games to prove to our
selves that we're capable of win
ning the NCAA title."
The Cardinal coach expects
this task to be difficult. He said
he fears that his squad may be
overconfident, and admitted
that either USC or UCLA can
beat Stanford.
In particular, Dettamanti
noted that while the Cardinal
has to prepare for two different

back-to-back away games, the
Trojans and the Bruins only
have to concentrate on their one
home stand.
As for the individual oppo
nents, Stanford will see a
Southern Cal team much differ
ent from the one it routed 14-6
in last weekend's NorCal tour
nament.
"Everything had gone right
for us and everything had gone
wrong for them, last time," Det
tamanti said.
And in this weekend's
encounter, the Trojans will
have their star centerforward,
senior John Gifford, who
missed the last confrontation
due to disciplinary problems.
On Saturday, Stanford will
face a very young and unpre
dictable Bruin team.
Although UCLA graduated
six of its seven starters last sea
son, it had a very good recruit
ing year according to Detta
manti.
"If we let these guys get an
early jump on us, they can beat
us," Dettamanti said.
Despite the implications of
the two matches, the Trojans
and Bruins games will not affect
the conference championship,
since a title tournament will be
held later in the season.
Stanford will play USC at
Los Angeles at 4 p.m. on Friday
and UCLA at the Rose Bowl
pool at 4 p.m. on Saturday,
which is scheduled to end right
before the kickoff of the football
game.
