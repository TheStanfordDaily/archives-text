A story in yesterday's Daily
about Meyer Library incorrectly
stated that graduate students will
use the reference desk at Meyer.
The reference desk at Meyer has
been closed and the only reference
desk available to both graduate
and undergraduate students is the
one in Green Library.
A story on the ASSU Senate in
yesterday's Daily said the senate
passed a bill that "strongly oppos
es" any changes in the ASSU busi
ness office, which Tresidder
Union is considering moving. The
bill actually says the "Senate
strongly opposes any changes . . .
until [discussions with Tresidder
Union] are completed."
