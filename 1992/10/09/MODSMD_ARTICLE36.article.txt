# Superintendent lies, resigns

The superintendent of the San Jose Unified
School District resigned yesterday, admitting he had
lied about having a doctorate degree from Stanford.
"I have made a very bad mistake and error in judg
ment. I do not have a doctorate degree from Stanford
University as I have claimed," Superintendent Jim
Baughman wrote in his resignation letter to the dis
trict's board of education.
Baughman wrote that he was sorry for the "gap
in trust" he had created among students, parents,
staff and the San Jose community.
The board met in emergency session yesterday
and decided to accept his resignation late in the
afternoon.
Rumors about the authenticity of Baughman's
doctorate began circulating in August after Stanford
officials began searching unsuccessfully for his dis
sertation.
Cecilia Burciaga, an associate vice president of
development, said she was contacted by a graduate stu
dent searching for Baughman's dissertation. Burciaga,
who was an associate dean of graduate students at the
time, attempted to track down the former superinten
dent's dissertation by his year of graduation.
But when Burciaga contacted the Registrar's
office to find out when he graduated, she discovered

the Stanford had no record of Baughman's enroll
ment. She informed the student and thought her
involvement in the matter was finished.
But yesterday morning, her name was included in
a newspaper article about Baughman's falsified
resume and suddenly, the calls started pouring in.
"I now understand very deeply why. .. people are
hesitant to become involved," she said.
Margaret De La Cruz, manager of registration
and records in the Registrar's office, confirmed that
Baughman was never enrolled at Stanford.
The Mercury News confronted Baughman
Wednesday afternoon with the information. His res
ignation letter was submitted within hours.
Baughman at 36 was the youngest large-city
school superintendent in California when he was
hired in 1989 to take over Santa Clara County's
largest school district.
The district has 31,000 students in 41 schools.
His rise from Leland High School principal to
deputy superintendent to superintendent was rapid,
and he quickly made a name for himself by bringing
peace to a district that had seen battles between
administrators and teachers for years.
Some educators urged Baughman to remain
despite the revelation.
"He's been the only reason this district stayed
afloat; he's been the only one holding it together,"
Linda Wilson, president of the teachers' union, told
the San Jose Mercury News.
