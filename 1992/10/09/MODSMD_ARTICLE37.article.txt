# Psychiatry prof. dies of leukemia
## 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
Roy Allan Ginsburg, a clinical asso
ciate professor of psychiatry at the
School of Medicine, died last Friday,
less than a week after learning he had
leukemia. He was 48.
A celebration in memory of Dr.
Ginsburg will be held tomorrow in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 12:30 p.m.
Ginsburg was characterized by
friends and family as a man who had
an infectious enthusiasm and a great
sense of humor, always taking the time
out to help others in a generous and
open way.
"He was one of a kind," said his
wife, Nancy Clark Ginsburg.
Ginsburg, a practicing psychoana
lyst and psychiatrist, served as a staff
physician at the psychiatry clinic.
Those who knew him talk about his
special ability to connect with people,
said his wife. He was not only sensitive
to people's needs, "he took care of
them," she said.
Ginsburg was also a member of the
voluntary faculty at Stanford Hospital,
where he began teaching and supervis

ing psychiatry residents in 1976. In
July, he was appointed president of the
San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute
after four years of service as a faculty
member.
He was interested in both clinical
work and theoretical work, his wife
said.
Last year, Ginsburg organized a
University conference to examine
Sigmund Freud's impact on Ameri
can culture. The conference
brought together philosophers,
psychoanalysts, social critics,
artists and literary figures.
"The work of Freud and others who
followed him has expanded our under
standing of human nature in general
and its influence on our society is
almost unlimited," Ginsburg told con
ference participants. "Freud's ideas
have been borrowed for novels, poetry,
humor, and they guide the upbringing
of children and also are reflected in
current views on education and philos
ophy."
In addition to being an excellent
clinician, Ginsburg frequently went
out of his way to help others succeed in
their fields, said Dr. Mary Jane Otte, a

colleague and fellow psychiatrist.
"He had a very generous and inclu
sive spirit and was extremely giving on
all levels to his patients, students and
friends," added another colleague, Dr.
Patricia Kauffman.
Ginsburg resided in Palo Alto,
where he was active in community
affairs. After attending a performance
at the city's local children's center with
his family, he decided to raise money so
the center could afford to install much
needed air-conditioning.
"He always said that when he
died he wanted food, he wanted a
party, and he wanted jazz." his
wife said. "He loved fooling around
on the piano."
Ginsburg was an amateur jazz
pianist, a hobby developed at resorts in
the Ca'tskill Mountains back in his days
as a student in New York.
Along with his wife, Ginsburg is sur
vived by their four children: Robin,
Heather, Sarah and Jessica. He is also
survived by a grandson.
Contributions may be sent to the
Roy Ginsburg Fund of the San Fran
cisco Psychoanalytic Institute or to the
American Friends Service Committee.
