# Conflict of interest accusations at SLAC
## USW say director hypocritical for sitting on Varian board 
### Lenora Chu 
The United Stanford Workers are accusing
SI-AC Director Burton Richter of hypocrisy
after he recently decreed that two of his em
ployees must give up outside part-time jobs
which presented "a conflict of interest."
The jobs "enable them to feed their families
and try to survive in our weak economy," said
the USW's September newsletter.

Richter ruled that holding a weekend job at,
the San Jose company N.G. Chemical Inc. in
addition to employment at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center presented a conflict of in
terest because SLAC conducts business with
the company.
But since Richter is currently a member of
the Board of Directors for the multi-million
dollar Varian Corporation — which supplies
equipment to SLAC — the newsletter called

the decision an "obvious double standard."
Richter disagreed. "I think they are wrong,"
he said. "If I didn't think they were wrong I
wouldn't have done what I did."
SLAC Personnel Director Lee Lyon also de
fended Richter, saying, "Burt is so far removed
in terms of process at Varian that he has very lit
tle opportunity to influence" Varian's business
with SLAC.
In addition, Lyon said, Richter received the
appropriate approvals for the board member
ship from the Department of Energy, which
funds and regulates SLAC, and the University.
But USW representative Ruben Serna
called Richter and Lyons "liars," adding that
Richter "directs, supervises, manages every
thing there is" at Varian.
To say that employment at Varian doesn't
present a similar conflict of interest "is like
saying 'I just shoot the gun, I don't really
drive the tank,' " Serna said.
Signed by all workers upon employment
at SLAC, a "conflict of interest" agreement
states that employees must "report all
prospective outside employment, including
consulting or other comparable employment
to the director" for approval.
The Department of Energy orders termi
nation of relations if double employment even
"appears to create a conflict of interest."
The two workers had received approval to
hold part-time employment with the chemical
company, Lyon said, but it was revoked
recently.
The jobs were initially approved "before
we had all the facts," Lyon said. SLAC's legal

counsel had failed to recognize that the com
pany picks up SLAC's hazardous waste, he
added, a relationship that could breed a con
flict of interest.
SLAC management was concerned that
the workers would develop split loyalties
between the two employers, Lyon said.
However, Serna suggested there were
ulterior motives behind Richter's order to
the employees to terminate employment at
the company.
One of the two workers had been engaged
in an "ongoing battle with a supervisor at
SLAC at the time" and could be fired pend
ing the outcome of a hearing, Serna said.
"Companies are very good at hiding harass
ment."
"Everybody thinks they're being treated
fairly and equitably" at SLAC, Richter coun
tered.
The roots of hostilities between SLAC and
USW go deeper than the outside employment
issue, Serna said. "About a year and a half
ago, SLAC had harassed USW on petty poli
cies to the point that we asked Congressman
Tom Lantos to intervene on our behalf.
Richter said the two workers, who could
not be reached for comment, are currently
holding other "similar capacity" paying jobs
with the county of San Mateo.
"That just proves that we are not trying to
stop them from having additional sources of
income," Lyon said.
