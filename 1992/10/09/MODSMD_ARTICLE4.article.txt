# Conflict of interest accusations at SLAC
## USW say director hypocritical for sitting on Varian board

The United Stanford Workers are accusing
SI-AC Director Burton Richter of hypocrisy
after he recently decreed that two of his em
ployees must give up outside part-time jobs
which presented "a conflict of interest."
The jobs "enable them to feed their families
and try to survive in our weak economy," said
the USW's September newsletter.

Richter ruled that holding a weekend job at,
the San Jose company N.G. Chemical Inc. in
addition to employment at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center presented a conflict of in
terest because SLAC conducts business with
the company.
But since Richter is currently a member of
the Board of Directors for the multi-million
dollar Varian Corporation — which supplies
equipment to SLAC — the newsletter called

the decision an "obvious double standard."
Richter disagreed. "I think they are wrong,"
he said. "If I didn't think they were wrong I
wouldn't have done what I did."
SLAC Personnel Director Lee Lyon also de
fended Richter, saying, "Burt is so far removed
in terms of process at Varian that he has very lit
tle opportunity to influence" Varian's business
