# Non-profit Stanford Directory may have to pay back taxes
## 
### Michael McCarroll Staff writer 
Profitability may have a price for the Stanford Di
rectory, which is investigating whether it must ant e up
several years of back taxes on its advertising revenues.
"Our intent is to make sure that anything that is
owed is paid in full," said Paul Szczesiul, the financial
officer for the Dean of Students. "Everything is above
board."
The Directory, which contains advertisements and
coupons in addition to student and staff listings, has
a circulation of more than 31,000. Although Directo
ry Business Manager Andrew Zurn said he could not
comment on the Directory's advertising revenue, sev
eral sources last year estimated the 1991-92 figure to
be between $40,000 and $45,000.

The tax the Directory may have to pay, known as
unrelated business income tax, is assessed when non
profit organizations are involved in business activi
ties that go beyond their charter.
"A problem arises when a student organization ac
cepts advertising dollars," said Chris Canellos, an ac
countant in the controller's office. "This is usually a
form of unrelated business income."
It is difficult to estimate how much the Directory
may or may not owe, according to Szczesiul.
The tax rate is assessed progressively, and "could
run as high as 30 percent," Szczesiul said. In addi
tion, he said there "could be penalties for back taxes."
The tax is assessed on the difference between ad
vertising income and allowable deductions for busi
ness expenses. Allowable deductions include any ex
penditures relevant to production, such as phone

bills, computer time, design costs and salaries for the
Directory's 12 staff members.
Taxes were never an issue until the Directory
began showing a significant profit, Szczesiul said.
"Years ago the Directory had hardly any ads, and it
was operated by the ASSU at a loss."
The Directory reported to the ASSU until 1980,
according to Zurn, when the Dean of Students' office
assumed responsibility.
"The Directory's advertising volume has in
creased significantly in the past few years," Szczesiul
continued. "A thorough accounting check is needed
to determine if income and expenditures are still in
equilibrium."
Zurn said he does not believe there will be any
problem financing whatever payments the Directory
might owe.

"I am fairly confident most can be paid out of re
serves and profits from this year," said Zurn. "It
would also be no problem to establish a line of credit
from the ASSU."
Zurn began auditing the Directory's records in
mid-August, and said he may be finished by Monday.
Cost accounting for the Directory is especially
challenging because the book includes advertising
and phone listings.
The IRS is concerned with only the expenses that
are related to the advertising sections of the Directo
ry. All accounting must differentiate between costs
incurred for the production of the nearly 300 pages of
advertising and the costs associated with producing
the names, phone numbers and addresses of Stanford
staff, faculty and students.
"We can't just show revenue and
expenditures," Zurn said. "We have
to separate advertising revenue and
advertising expenditures ... (and)
differentiate between time we
worked on the advertising part
from the time we worked on the
phone listings part."
Cost accounting has had mini
mal impact on the production of
this year's Directory. "Although
accounting procedures have coin
cided with the busiest time for
the Directory, production is right
on schedule," Szczesiul said. The
Directory is scheduled for release
on Nov. 16.
