## Musician electrifies enthusiastic students, shares views 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
Legendary musician Carlos Santana electrified
Casa Zapata last night as he talked about his music
and his views, signing a mural in which he is depicted.
Greeted by more than 100 enthusiastic students,
Santana received several standing ovations and was
mobbed by students for autographs when both en
tering and exiting.

'My soul pretty much tells me
music should be for the heart,
by the heart.'
— Carlos Santana

"Last year I got to see the president of Mexico
and this year I got to see something better," sopho
more Javier Ruiz said when introducing Santana.
Casa Zapata Resident Fellow Cecilia Burciaga said,
"I think for the house it's a great honor. It's made a
myth a person and that's what the house is about."
Santana, who stopped at Stanford with his wife
during a break in his tour, talked about various po
litical and personal topics.
He spoke about the influence other musicians
such as Bob Marley and John Coltrane have had on
him and how Marley's idea of "no passports" is be
ginning to emerge in the world.
"We're beginning to see a lot of these things come
to be [in Europel," he said. "A lot of countries dream
of doing that ... of having a North America from
Canada to Brazil with no boundaries."
Santana, who was born in Mexico but moved to
San Francisco as a child, began playing music at the
age of 5.
He became internationally known after perform
ing at Woodstock and just recently began his third
decade as a world-renowned artist.

Musicians 8.8. King, John Lee Hooker and
Chico Walker were his biggest influences, but he
said that his music has no one label.
"My soul pretty much tells me music should be
for the heart, by the heart. And the heart is forev
er," Santana said.
Santana told the audience that they must work
on their imaginations and use them.
"I'm convinced in my heart that we are all
artists," he said. "You must develop your imagina
tion like a muscle."
Santana, who is involved in Amnesty Interna
tional, also spoke about women in politics and Na
tive American issues.
After receiving applause for quoting an Apache
who said that women always have the last word in
their meetings, Santana said, "We need to have our
sisters, our mothers and our daughters participate
in the manifestation of our consciousness."
He also spoke about Native Americans' efforts to
become their own nation, and his hopes for organiz
ing a concert at the Shoreline Amphitheater in
Mountain View which would be attended by Nelson
Mandela and Coretta Scott King.
After speaking to students, Santana signed a
mural on the wall of Zapata which depicts him with
other Mexican-American heroes.
Casa Zapata presented him with a photograph of
the mural and MEChA, a Chicano/Latino student
group, presented him with a card and a T-shirt.
"Being received like this is getting your battery
charged," he said.
Students who attended the event often described
Santana as an "inspiration."
"What he said was really inspiring," freshman
Vanessa Alvarado said. "Just being here and seeing
him face to face is an honor. The way he says we should
all be one stands for what a lot of people here at Stan
ford stand for, especially at Zapata and MEChA. "
Signing autographs before departing from Zapa
ta, Santana left students with one final thought —
a quote from musician John Coltrane: "One positive
thought creates thousands of positive vibrations."
