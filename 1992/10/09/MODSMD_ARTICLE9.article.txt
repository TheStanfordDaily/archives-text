# Robot tumbles down stairs
## All Stanford's doctors couldn't put 'Cookie' together again 
### Greg Miller 
One of Stanford Hospital's newest and hardest
working employees, affectionately known as "Cook
ie," was iryured in a fall down a flight of stairs in the
hospital's atrium yesterday — but there was nothing
any of the doctors could do.
That's because Cookie is not a human, but a 600-
pound, $60,000 robot programmed to deliver food
from the hospital's dietary center to various nursing
stations.
The robot was returning from a delivery yesterday
at 3 p.m. when it fell down the atrium stairs in the
Hospital Modernization Project area, or "new hospi
tal," according to hospital administrator Louis Sak
sen. No humans were iryured in the accident.
"In the robot's memory bank, they have the floor
plan of the hospital programmed," Saksen said. "We
think somebody misprogrammed Cookie.
"Somebody must not have programmed that stair
way where it is. Or it could have been a malfunction
with the computer," Saksen speculated.
Cookie is one of three robots performing delivery
tasks at the hospital. All three were manufactured by
TRC of Danbury, Conn., and have been in service the
hospital for about a month.
The robots have been working 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.
Two of TRC's engineers were examining the robot
late yesterday to determine the cause of the accident,
Saksen said, and the robot's fiberglass casing was all

that appeared to be damaged.
"Most of the damage was superficial," said Shawn
Klotz, an applications engineer for TRC. "We are in
the process of getting the information out of the
robot, but it is too early to tell what went wrong."
Klotz said the robot was equipped with a "flight
recorder" similar to airplanes that will be examined
by engineers in the company's Connecticut office to
determine what went wrong.

"This is the first time that this has happened.
There was nothing in the robot to lead it down there
to the stairs," Klotz said.
Stanford Hospital is the second hospital in Cali
fornia to use robots from TRC, and they have been
purchased by about 12 hospitals nationwide, Klotz
said.
TRC is in the process of adding detectors to the
bumpers of the robot that would warn it if it were
about to roll down a flight of stairs, Klotz said.
