# Stanford jumps to AP No.8

### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
PASADENA, Ca. - The Car
dinal vaulted into the nation's
top 10 Saturday, downing UCLA
19-7 on a Rose Bowl field they
hope to visit again Jan. 1.
Behind an electric Glyn Mil
burn punt return for a touch
down and yet another smother
ing defensive performance, Stan
ford moved to No. 8 in the Associ
ated Press poll and poised itself
as a front-runner for the Pacific
10 Conference title.
After the game, Milburn joked
that the Cardinal was "breaking
in the field" for a New Year's Day
return.
The rest of the conference
wasn't laughing.
Stanford's second straight
road thumping of a top-20 oppo
nent should give pause to Seattle
travel agents already booking
Husky packages to Pasadena.
While the Cardinal struggled
offensively for the fifth time in
six weeks, the nation's fifth
ranked defense stifled the Bruins
and their freshman quarterback,
Rob Walker.
Stanford recorded six sacks,
intercepted a pass to set up the
team's lone offensive touchdown,
and held the Bruins scoreless in
the second half.
"Today was a gut check for the
defense. We came through when
we had to. [UCLA] made some
plays and had some drives, but in
the end I think we wanted it a lit
tle more," said outside linebacker
Ron George.
Stanford's fifth straight win
moved them to 2-0 in Pac-10
play, and 5-1 overall. Previously
19th-ranked UCLA (3-2) dropped
out of the polls, and is still win
less after two conference games.
Saturday's contest, however,
was not one for offensive enthu
siasts. If you're looking for a
buzzword to characterize both
teams' offensive performances,
try impotence.
Punters had a busy night;
Stanford's Paul Stonehouse
booted 10 balls to Bruin Darren
Schager's eight.
Stonehouse's efforts (43-yard
average) helped the Cardinal win
the battle for field position that
saw UCLA begin 13 of its 17 dri
ves inside its own 30.

Except for one scoring drive at
the end of the first half, the Bru
ins could do little to counter that
disadvantage. The Cardinal shut
down the UCLA rushing attack,
forcing Walker to carry the offen
sive burden. He was not up to the
task.
Walker, harassed by an unre

lenting Stanford pass rush (led
by George's three sacks), com
pleted just 23 of his 46 pass at
tempts.
The Cardinal mixed defensive
looks against the Bruin passing
game, and Walker was unable to
lead sustained drives.
"We're really struggling offen

sively right now. No question
that when you start a young, in
experienced quarterback, you're
going to have growing pains,"
said UCLA coach Terry Don
ahue.
One wonders what kind of

pains Bill Walsh's offensive unit
was suffering. The Cardinal was
no more successful moving the
ball.
Stanford, like the Bruins, put
together just one impressive
scoring drive — the first time
they touched the ball. Milburn
and quarterback Steve Stenstrom
led an opening march that
spanned 71 yards in 10 plays and
resulted in a short Eric Abrams
field goal.
Then the guns that peppered
South Bend last weekend went
silent. "Three downs and out" was
too often the story as the Cardinal
pathetically converted only two of
its 14 third down opportunities.
"After the first drive things
started to deteriorate. Our timing
was awful on our passing game.
Stenstrom held the ball [too
long). We're still suffering offen
sively," Walsh said.
Milburn was the offense's

lone bright spot. He carried the
bali a season-high 23 times and
rushed for 92 yards. But he gave
his fledgling Heisman candidacy
its biggest boost on a 75-yard
punt return.
That dash to the end zone
was of the few highlights in a
game that would have elicited
yawns from a Fischer-Spassky
crowd, and it gave the Cardinal
a 10-0 lead late in the first quar
ter.
"The call was for a middle
return. I had a lot of room to
catch it, and I saw a seam and just
headed up the sideline," Milburn
said.
With six games remaining
on the conference schedule, it
may seem early to talk about a
game that would determine the
Pac-10's Rose Bowl representa
tive.
But the No. 8 Cardinal's Hal
loween match-up with No. 1
Washington is looking more and
more like a dandy.

It has been a full two decades
since Stanford last appeared in
the top 10. Washington hasn't
lost a game in almost two years. It
most certainly could be a show
down for the Roses .
But, while quietly acknowledg
ing the fact that they became a
legitimate contender for the con
ference title, the Cardinal (and
Walsh especially) was less than
exuberant about Saturday's big
win.
"We're not in any position to
do much talking. We struggled
tonight, and struggled in our
other Pac-10 game against Ore
gon," Walsh said.
Exuberance may have been
further tempered by a realization
in some quarters that — despite
having a very talented defense —
UCLA has been decimated by
injuries to its starting quarter
back, tailback and All-American
wide out, and is not quite the
powerhouse others thought it
would be.

PASADENA, Ca. - The Car
dinal vaulted into the nation's
top 10 Saturday, downing UCLA
19-7 on a Rose Bowl field they
hope to visit again Jan. 1.
Behind an electric Glyn Mil
burn punt return for a touch
down and yet another smother
ing defensive performance, Stan
ford moved to No. 8 in the Associ
ated Press poll and poised itself
as a front-runner for the Pacific
10 Conference title.
After the game, Milburn joked
that the Cardinal was "breaking
in the field" for a New Year's Day
return.
The rest of the conference
wasn't laughing.
Stanford's second straight
road thumping of a top-20 oppo
nent should give pause to Seattle
travel agents already booking
Husky packages to Pasadena.
While the Cardinal struggled
offensively for the fifth time in
six weeks, the nation's fifth
ranked defense stifled the Bruins
and their freshman quarterback,
Rob Walker.
Stanford recorded six sacks,
intercepted a pass to set up the
team's lone offensive touchdown,
and held the Bruins scoreless in
the second half.
"Today was a gut check for the
defense. We came through when
we had to. [UCLA] made some
plays and had some drives, but in
the end I think we wanted it a lit
tle more," said outside linebacker
Ron George.
Stanford's fifth straight win
moved them to 2-0 in Pac-10
play, and 5-1 overall. Previously
19th-ranked UCLA (3-2) dropped
out of the polls, and is still win
less after two conference games.
Saturday's contest, however,
was not one for offensive enthu
siasts. If you're looking for a
buzzword to characterize both
teams' offensive performances,
try impotence.
Punters had a busy night;
Stanford's Paul Stonehouse
booted 10 balls to Bruin Darren
Schager's eight.
Stonehouse's efforts (43-yard
average) helped the Cardinal win
the battle for field position that
saw UCLA begin 13 of its 17 dri
ves inside its own 30.

Except for one scoring drive at
the end of the first half, the Bru
ins could do little to counter that
disadvantage. The Cardinal shut
down the UCLA rushing attack,
forcing Walker to carry the offen
sive burden. He was not up to the
task.
Walker, harassed by an unre

lenting Stanford pass rush (led
by George's three sacks), com
pleted just 23 of his 46 pass at
tempts.
The Cardinal mixed defensive
looks against the Bruin passing
game, and Walker was unable to
lead sustained drives.
"We're really struggling offen

sively right now. No question
that when you start a young, in
experienced quarterback, you're
going to have growing pains,"
said UCLA coach Terry Don
ahue.
One wonders what kind of

dinal shut down the Bruins 19-7.
pains Bill Walsh's offensive unit
was suffering. The Cardinal was
no more successful moving the
ball.
Stanford, like the Bruins, put
together just one impressive
scoring drive — the first time
they touched the ball. Milburn
and quarterback Steve Stenstrom
led an opening march that
spanned 71 yards in 10 plays and
resulted in a short Eric Abrams
field goal.
Then the guns that peppered
South Bend last weekend went
silent. "Three downs and out" was
too often the story as the Cardinal
pathetically converted only two of
its 14 third down opportunities.
"After the first drive things
started to deteriorate. Our timing
was awful on our passing game.
Stenstrom held the ball [too
long). We're still suffering offen
sively," Walsh said.
Milburn was the offense's

lone bright spot. He carried the
bali a season-high 23 times and
rushed for 92 yards. But he gave
his fledgling Heisman candidacy
its biggest boost on a 75-yard
punt return.
That dash to the end zone
was of the few highlights in a
game that would have elicited
yawns from a Fischer-Spassky
crowd, and it gave the Cardinal
a 10-0 lead late in the first quar
ter.
"The call was for a middle
return. I had a lot of room to
catch it, and I saw a seam and just
headed up the sideline," Milburn
said.
With six games remaining
on the conference schedule, it
may seem early to talk about a
game that would determine the
Pac-10's Rose Bowl representa
tive.
But the No. 8 Cardinal's Hal
loween match-up with No. 1
Washington is looking more and
more like a dandy.

It has been a full two decades
since Stanford last appeared in
the top 10. Washington hasn't
lost a game in almost two years. It
most certainly could be a show
down for the Roses .
But, while quietly acknowledg
ing the fact that they became a
legitimate contender for the con
ference title, the Cardinal (and
Walsh especially) was less than
exuberant about Saturday's big
win.
"We're not in any position to
do much talking. We struggled
tonight, and struggled in our
other Pac-10 game against Ore
gon," Walsh said.
Exuberance may have been
further tempered by a realization
in some quarters that — despite
having a very talented defense —
UCLA has been decimated by
injuries to its starting quarter
back, tailback and All-American
wide out, and is not quite the
powerhouse others thought it
would be.
