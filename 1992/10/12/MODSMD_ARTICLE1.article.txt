# Stanford jumps to AP No.8

PASADENA, Ca. - The Car
dinal vaulted into the nation's
top 10 Saturday, downing UCLA
19-7 on a Rose Bowl field they
hope to visit again Jan. 1.
Behind an electric Glyn Mil
burn punt return for a touch
down and yet another smother
ing defensive performance, Stan
ford moved to No. 8 in the Associ
ated Press poll and poised itself
as a front-runner for the Pacific
10 Conference title.
After the game, Milburn joked
that the Cardinal was "breaking
in the field" for a New Year's Day
return.
The rest of the conference
wasn't laughing.
Stanford's second straight
road thumping of a top-20 oppo
nent should give pause to Seattle
travel agents already booking
Husky packages to Pasadena.
While the Cardinal struggled
offensively for the fifth time in
six weeks, the nation's fifth
ranked defense stifled the Bruins
and their freshman quarterback,
Rob Walker.
Stanford recorded six sacks,
intercepted a pass to set up the
team's lone offensive touchdown,
and held the Bruins scoreless in
the second half.
"Today was a gut check for the
defense. We came through when
we had to. [UCLA] made some
plays and had some drives, but in
the end I think we wanted it a lit
tle more," said outside linebacker
Ron George.
Stanford's fifth straight win
moved them to 2-0 in Pac-10
play, and 5-1 overall. Previously
19th-ranked UCLA (3-2) dropped
out of the polls, and is still win
less after two conference games.
Saturday's contest, however,
was not one for offensive enthu
siasts. If you're looking for a
buzzword to characterize both
teams' offensive performances,
try impotence.
Punters had a busy night;
Stanford's Paul Stonehouse
booted 10 balls to Bruin Darren
Schager's eight.
Stonehouse's efforts (43-yard
average) helped the Cardinal win
the battle for field position that
saw UCLA begin 13 of its 17 dri
ves inside its own 30.

Except for one scoring drive at
the end of the first half, the Bru
ins could do little to counter that
disadvantage. The Cardinal shut
down the UCLA rushing attack,
forcing Walker to carry the offen
sive burden. He was not up to the
task.
Walker, harassed by an unre

lenting Stanford pass rush (led
by George's three sacks), com
pleted just 23 of his 46 pass at
tempts.
The Cardinal mixed defensive
looks against the Bruin passing
game, and Walker was unable to
lead sustained drives.
"We're really struggling offen

sively right now. No question
that when you start a young, in
experienced quarterback, you're
going to have growing pains,"
said UCLA coach Terry Don
ahue.

dinal shut down the Bruins 19-7.
