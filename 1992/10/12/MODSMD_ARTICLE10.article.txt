## Bush, Clinton, Perot outline varied visions 
### 
ST. LOUIS (AP) - Bill Clinton
and President Bush clashed over
character and the economy yester
day night in a bristling three-way
debate with Ross Perot. "I was
opposed the war, but I love my
country," Clinton said in reply to
Bush's criticism of his anti-war
activities in the Vietnam era.
From taxes to crime to AIDS to
foreign policy, the three men grap
pling for the White House outlined
differing visions in a 90-minute
nationally televised debate.
In his first major campaign
appearance, Perot was a flamboy
ant participant, providing a series
of one-liners and offering himself
as an outsider who can shake up
the system.
Clinton said he was neither a
trickle-down Republican nor a
"tax and spend" Democrat. He
said he represents hope for "real
change" in a country beset by eco
nomic woes.
Turning to Bush, he said, "For
12 years you've had it your way,
you've had your chance and it
didn't work."
Bush answered, "Change for
change sake isn't enough," and
cast himself as the experienced
hand who can be trusted in the
Oval Office.
Perot countered, "We do have
to have change," saying that the
first priority should be to rebuild
the nation's job base and offering
his experience as a hard-charging
business leader.
The debate kicked off a climac
tic nine-day period in the cam
paign for the White House and the
stakes were high, especially for
Bush who trailed Clinton in the
national polls, and for Perot, who
had not yet carved a significant
place for himself in the race.
There were no obvious gaffes or
breakthroughs in the debate
played out before an audience esti
mated in advance at 70 million,
and each side rushed afterward to
put a best face forward. Clinton's

running mate, Sen. A 1 Gore,
quipped that Bush had finished
"fourth," behind Clinton, Perot
and moderator Jim Lehrer. White
House chief of staff James A.
Baker 111 said the president had
made "a mature presentation."
Bush bluntly criticized Clinton
in the debate's opening moments
for anti-war activities while study
ing overseas at Oxford University
during the Vietnam war. Bush
held out his service during World
War II in contrast.
Clinton responded directly to
Bush, in strong, personal remarks.
"When Joe McCarthy went around
this country attacking people's
patriotism, he was wrong," said
Clinton. "Your father (Sen.
Prescott Bush) was right to stand
up to Joe McCarthy.
"You were wrong to attack my
patriotism. I was opposed to the

war but I love my country."
Bush replied that he was not
attacking Clinton's patriotism,
but his character and judgment.
In his closing statement, Perot
touched on his outsider's candida
cy. "The government has lost
touch with the people. We've got
to change the system," he said.
Clinton said, "I offer a new
direction, invest in American job
American education, conti 1
health care costs, bring this cou
try together again."
Bush had the last word, recall
ing the collapse of Communism
and other dramatic world events
of the past four years, and
promised to devote his attention
to domestic issues.
A five-member panel of judg-s
who watched the debate awarded
Clinton a narrow victory, with
Bush a clear third behind Perot.
