## Keep COP promise 
### 
PROMISES, PROMISES. Last
spring's victorious "I Prefer
Not to Have a COP" Council
of Presidents slate promised to do
nothing. And they have kept that
vow, even though it has meant
reneging on a separate promise —
to give their unused office space to
the Disabled Students at Stanford
for use as a community center.
Over the summer, the ASSU
Senate and Financial Aid Advoca
cy Office moved into the space and
reorganized their old office in the
ASSU's lobby, dashing hopes DSS
had for a permanent home.
Whether "I Prefer" member Ed
Mun had the authority to reallo
cate that space seems, at this junc
ture, a moot point. The fact is, he's
no longer around to rectify his bro
ken pledge, and disabled students
— unlike many other Stanford
minority groups — are still with
out a community center.
But the ASSU Senate, unlike
Mun, is in a position to fulfill his
vow.
As one of its first acts of the new
year, the senate should start an

active search for space for a dis
abled students' community center.
As one option, the senate could
order the FAAO out of the old COP
haunt. But the possibility of re
instating the COP in next spring's
election makes this alternative ten
uous at best, and short-lived at
worst.
A more viable alternative is to
investigate the possibility of help
ing DSS members persuade the
University to allow DSS to annex
the classroom next to the Disabili
ty Resource Center in Meyer
Library. The ASSU could also help
out with furnishings or office
assistance as the new center gets
its feet on the ground.
Shafting Stanford's disabled stu
dents mocks the "pluralism" of this
campus that is touted by many. If
indeed this community has a com
mitment to inclusiveness and equal
treatment for all, disabled students
deserve the same kind of support
and facilities that other student
groups receive. The senate has an
obligation, and the power, to ensure
that they get them.
