# More postal worries

TO THOSE OF YOU WHO
love to complain about the
Stanford post office: rejoice.
You now have yet another reason
to criticize.
The post office, renting its
10,000 post office boxes at full
capacity, has been forced to refuse
EO. box service to 69 Stanford stu
dents, at least for the time being.
This situation must be very dis
tressing for those students who are
forced to use Old Union room 129
as their mailing address. In addi
tion, it serves as yet an another
reminder of the ineptitude of our
less-than-loved campus institution.
Post office officials may be cor
rect in claiming that the Universi
ty was late to inform them of this
year's increased enrollment

increase. Nonetheless, the post
office should provide for such fluc
tuations — which in actuality only
amounted to an approximate
increase of 9 percent over last year
— in its planning.
Such an increase should hardly
have created the disastrous situa
tion it did, especially considering
that approximately 40 percent of
box-renters are not even students.
The post office should have had
— and certainly now should imple
ment — a way to terminate the
rentals of non-students during the
summer so that the current situa
tion does not repeat itself.
Poor management, and nothing
else, can explain the piles of
envelopes that now accumulate in
Old Union.
