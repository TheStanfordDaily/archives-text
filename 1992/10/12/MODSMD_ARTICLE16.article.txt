## Give an old hero a break 
### 
TWO GUYS ARE IN A BAR, arguing
over who deserves to be called the
greatest hitter of all time — Ty
Cobb or Pete Rose.
After going back and forth for a while
about the differences in pitching, equip
ment and competition between baseball
at the turn of the century and baseball in
the '80s, one turns to the other and says,
"Look, if Ty Cobb were playing today,
what do you think his batting average
would be?"
"Oh, somewhere around .210."
".210?"
"Well, keep in mind, he'd be some
thing like 106 years old."
It's an old joke, but it illuminates £
good point. No matter how badly we v d
like to have a definitive method of com
parison, logic won't give us one.
They played against different people,
with different rules. They played, well,
different games. And while that will
never end the locker room debates, it's
foolish to hold Cobb's accomplishments
up against today's standards.
And this fallacy isn't limited to the
sports world. We like to hold today's
dynamic yardstick up to all our cherished
historical figures. No matter where they
made their impacts on the time line of the
world, what seems to count the most is
how they would be received in our pre
sent society.
Today is Columbus Day. In some

cities, various protests and demonstra
tions will tarnish this 500 th anniversary
celebration. Other cities have refused to
acknowledge the day at all.
Huh? I'm supposed to ignore the man
who had perhaps the most significant
effect on the direction of history in the
past millennium? What did 1 miss?
Yes, he committed some shockingly
brutal crimes against Native Americans
he encountered during his voyages — he
enslaved them, tortured them and inad
vertently introduced lethal European dis
eases to them. But it's our enlightened
perspectives that allow us to see these
actions as shockingly brutal.
Columbus made his journeys 500
years The society he lived in had lit
tle regard for native peoples as human
beings; they were seen as closer to pri
mates than persons. But that's the con
text within which Columbus existed.
We can't expect anyone to accurately
predict what the ethics of our society will
be five centuries into the future, and to
act accordingly. Knock the values of an
era if you will, but don't discredit its indi
viduals and events.
Suppose that by the year 2492 society
deems it completely unacceptable to eat
any kind of meat. Suppose that by this
time the immorality of animal flesh con
sumption is so ingrained that nobody
even questions the truth of the matter.
Would it be fair to devalue the accom

plishments of our contemporaries simply
because they violate ethical tenets that
don't currently exist and are impossible
to predict? Of course not.
Columbus was a brave explorer who
wasn't acknowledged in his era as an evil
man. He united the two hemispheres of
the world, ushering in a fantastically new
era of human history. The European cul
ture he introduced to the Americas, like
it or not, is the basis for today's American
society, and to ignore the awesdme signif
icance of this event because the values of
the 20th century are distinct from those
of the 15th century borders on the
absurd.
The achievers of our past aren't
"Gumby"-like figurines, so don't contort
their images to make them fit your
changing specifications. Accept them for
what they were, when they were.
If he were playing today, Christopher
Columbus would be way, way too old to
dive out of the way of a brushback pitch
So stop throwing him one. Happy
500 th birthday.
