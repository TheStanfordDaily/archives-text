## Thoughts on America's favorite hero/villain â€” Columbus 
### 
WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR with
the myth of Columbus, the fear
less explorer who brought civi
lization to the wilderness. "In fourteen
hundred and ninety-two, Columbus
sailed the ocean blue. ..."
My own research has led me to con
clude that the Columbus myth is per
haps the most fascinating area of
inquiry for students in the social sci
ences today. Hundreds of new books and
articles shed extraordinary light on the
complex man himself, his actions and
what he set in motion.
Beyond the glossy veneer of chil
dren's books, the romanticized Colum
bus presented a very disturbing picture
to me. In 1492, Columbus was met by
the Taino Indians, a peaceful and gener
ous people by Columbus' own estima
tion.
Nevertheless, because Columbus
believed they were concealing great
mines of gold, they were raped, whipped,
burned on racks over fires and shredded
to death by vicious attack dogs during
his second and third visits.
Brutal chopping blocks were routine.
Taino noses and ears were cut off, as
were thousands of hands. Most Indians

were left to bleed to death. Even
Spaniards accused of hiding gold had
their noses and ears sliced.
Columbus instituted this reign of ter
ror to force the Taino to see "how strong
and powerful the Christians were."
Locating gold was his obsession. In his
journal Columbus wrote "Gold is a won
derful thing! Whoever owns it is lord of
all he wants. With gold it is even possible
to open, for souls, the way to paradise."
Historians have various death esti
mates. In the years of Columbus' direct
rule, several hundred thousand Indians
were killed or took their own lives. By
1542, after 50 years of rule by Colum
bus, his brothers and sons, several mil
lion Island Indians had been reduced to
less than 200. This is the first holocaust
of the Americas, one which was to be
repeated against almost all the Ameri
can Indian peoples over the next 350
years.
Given the greedy ferocity of Colum
bus' relations with the Taino, his voy
ages cannot be called 'discoveries' or
even the more euphemistic 'encoun
ters.' They were invasions and land
grabs. And the policy Columbus initiat
ed and supported against the Taino was

genocide.
Colonialism and mass extermination
was not Columbus' only legacy in the
Western Hemisphere. Desperate for
profits by 1495, Columbus initiated the
trans-Atlantic slave trade. At first, Indi
an slaves were shipped to Spain, but
very few Indians survived these voyages
or diseases in European cities.
Later, Africans were sent west as sub
stitute slave labor for the declining pop
ulations of Indians. Columbus himself
justified enslavement of non-Christians
by writing that it would more readily
"secure the welfare of their souls."
Finally, after eight years of deceiving
his patrons about profits from his enter
prise and massive mismanagement,
Columbus was arrested in 1500 and sent
back to Spain in chains. His greed had
destroyed any personal integrity he
might have had, becoming reduced, in
the words of one scholar, to "the world's
biggest liar." Although he would make
one more trip west, he never regained
his power. He died in 1506.
In the emerging European culture of
his time, Columbus helped ensure that
human beings in less developed coun
tries were essentially worthless. If worth

was attached, it was in commercial
terms. Likewise, the natural environ
ment was evaluated not for its beauty or
balance, but for the monetary value of
what could be extracted from it.
The 'discovery' itself was a domi
nant group stealing from a less power
ful group. We still struggle with these
issues today, for they are deeply
imbedded in the history of our own
country.
I would hope that discussions about
Columbus would not idealize all Indians
or demonize Europeans. Students need
to be inspired by the history of resis
tance from all quarters to Columbus
himself and the invaders that followed,
for it is within this resistance that we
see a reborn respect for humanity and
mother earth.
We are not responsible for what oth
ers did before us. However, we are
responsible for educating ourselves and
our children so that we may reverse the
destructive legacies of Columbus that
plague our modern life.

to death by vicious attack dogs during
his second and third visits.
Brutal chopping blocks were routine.
Taino noses and ears were cut off, as
were thousands of hands. Most Indians

were left to bleed to death. Even
Spaniards accused of hiding gold had
their noses and ears sliced.
Columbus instituted this reign of ter
ror to force the Taino to see "how strong
and powerful the Christians were."
Locating gold was his obsession. In his
journal Columbus wrote "Gold is a won
derful thing! Whoever owns it is lord of
all he wants. With gold it is even possible
to open, for souls, the way to paradise."
Historians have various death esti
mates. In the years of Columbus' direct
rule, several hundred thousand Indians
were killed or took their own lives. By
1542, after 50 years of rule by Colum
bus, his brothers and sons, several mil
lion Island Indians had been reduced to
less than 200. This is the first holocaust
of the Americas, one which was to be
repeated against almost all the Ameri
can Indian peoples over the next 350
years.
Given the greedy ferocity of Colum
bus' relations with the Taino, his voy
ages cannot be called 'discoveries' or
even the more euphemistic 'encoun
ters.' They were invasions and land
grabs. And the policy Columbus initiat
ed and supported against the Taino was

genocide.
Colonialism and mass extermination
was not Columbus' only legacy in the
Western Hemisphere. Desperate for
profits by 1495, Columbus initiated the
trans-Atlantic slave trade. At first, Indi
an slaves were shipped to Spain, but
very few Indians survived these voyages
or diseases in European cities.
Later, Africans were sent west as sub
stitute slave labor for the declining pop
ulations of Indians. Columbus himself
justified enslavement of non-Christians
by writing that it would more readily
"secure the welfare of their souls."
Finally, after eight years of deceiving
his patrons about profits from his enter
prise and massive mismanagement,
Columbus was arrested in 1500 and sent
back to Spain in chains. His greed had
destroyed any personal integrity he
might have had, becoming reduced, in
the words of one scholar, to "the world's
biggest liar." Although he would make
one more trip west, he never regained
his power. He died in 1506.
In the emerging European culture of
his time, Columbus helped ensure that
human beings in less developed coun
tries were essentially worthless. If worth

was attached, it was in commercial
terms. Likewise, the natural environ
ment was evaluated not for its beauty or
balance, but for the monetary value of
what could be extracted from it.
The 'discovery' itself was a domi
nant group stealing from a less power
ful group. We still struggle with these
issues today, for they are deeply
imbedded in the history of our own
country.
I would hope that discussions about
Columbus would not idealize all Indians
or demonize Europeans. Students need
to be inspired by the history of resis
tance from all quarters to Columbus
himself and the invaders that followed,
for it is within this resistance that we
see a reborn respect for humanity and
mother earth.
We are not responsible for what oth
ers did before us. However, we are
responsible for educating ourselves and
our children so that we may reverse the
destructive legacies of Columbus that
plague our modern life.
