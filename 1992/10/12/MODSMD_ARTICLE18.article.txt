# RAs valuable to Stanford's upperclass community
## 
### 
The thrust of your editorial in the
Oct. 8 edition of the Daily was that
the RAs of Mirrielees and the Suites
are not worth what they are paid. In
fact, they are paid far less than your
article states and worth much more
than you suggest.
Your article implied that there is no
Mirrielees community, that the stu
dents here are not interested in forming
one, and that the RAs do little more
than post fliers and let students into
locked rooms. I take issue with each
point.

Mirrielees is much more than an
"escape from dorm life." Mirrielees
offers students the flexibility of apart
ment-style independence while still
providing the opportunity to be a mem
ber of an on-campus residential com
munity.
Because we lack a communal dining
hall and large common areas, communi
ty building at Mirrielees often requires
more outreach and initiative from our
RAs. In their two weeks on the job they
have met the challenge well.
Our events have so far included hall

study breaks, a barbecue, trips to San
Francisco Symphony performances,
parties, intramurals, and a team water
balloon competition. We are planning
many more social and educational activ
ities as the year progresses.
Already our RAs have mediated sev
eral student disputes. They are also
available as ever-ready sources of infor
mation, friendship and guidance should
the need arise.
In addition, they have been trained
to provide for the safety and well-being
of the residents should a crisis or an

emergency occur.
I can not speak directly for the
Suites, but I am sure that their RAs are
also valuable and appreciated.
In this time of budget cuts it's
tempting to denigrate what seems an
unessential service on the edge of cam
pus.
A more informed look will show that
the residential staffs at Mirrielees and
the Suites are significant assets to the
quality of life at Stanford.
