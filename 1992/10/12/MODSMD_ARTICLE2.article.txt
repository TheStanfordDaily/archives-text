# Gift 'tax' awaits further perusal

### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
A budget-cutting plan to add a
surcharge to some gifts given to
the University has been delayed
until next fall because of "compli
cations" in beginning the proposal
this year, officials said.
Members of a University com
mittee that recommended delay
ing the plan said they had not had
time to study its full implications,
and worried that some donors
might have been reluctant to give
money because of the charge.
"It turned out to be an idea that
was a little ahead of its time," said
Senior Assoc. Dean of Engineer
ing Charles Kruger, chair of the
Provost's Committee on Budget
Implementation.
The plan would have saved
about $3 million by placing a
roughly 10 percent "tax" on gifts
made in the form of restricted

funds, Kruger said.
Restricted funds must be used
as directed by the donor to carry
out a project, such as research by a
specific school.
The gifts can therefore be a
mixed blessing for the University,
which must use operating funds to
cover the overhead costs associat
ed with carrying out the project.
The University had hoped to re
coup those overhead costs by plac
ing a charge on restricted funds
that reflects their real costs.
Although the plan was delayed
for now, a charge will definitely go
into effect next year after further
study, according to Kruger.
He said a memo sent by Provost
Gerald Lieberman to the deans of
each of the schools "put the deans
on notice" that "some charge or
assessment" would be expected to
go into effect by September 1993.
