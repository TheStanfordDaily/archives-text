# Students 'cable up' off campus
## Blacked out game not available to campus viewers 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
With Saturday's game against UCLA televised on
ESPN, and the Stanford Network failing to pick up
the game for students, interested fans had to scram
ble if they wanted to watch the action.
Many people found off-campus friends with cable
subscriptions and paid them a timely visit. Most stu
dents, however, took the opportunity to visit one of
the many popular bars and restaurants in the area.

'I dont know why the UCLA
players tuck up their
jerseys. They were gross
and their bellies were jig
gling all over.'
— sophomore Millie Chu

At The Oasis in Menlo Park, students, alumni,
and fans-at-large jockeyed for position in front of
three large screens.
For a time, football competed with baseball as the
management chose to show the Braves-Pirates tele
cast on two of its televisions. Disgruntled Cardinal
supporters fought this policy with a rousing chant of
"Football! Football!"
For those who haven't been there, The Oasis
stands as a venerable Stanford institution, the king
of the off-campus bars.
The wooden tables and interior bear the carvings
of generations of Stanford lovers eager to immortal
ize their feelings.
On Saturday night, a couple of hundred Stanford
boosters jammed into the bar to watch the game.
Many entered and quickly left because of the lack of
seats.
For those who stayed, it was a constant battle
against the sweltering heat of the room. The sweaty
clientele kept their cool with a steady flow of cold
beer and munched on a grease-filled smorgasbord of
hamburgers, pizza, and onion rings.
One student pondered the nature of the feast.
"For short-term pleasure, nothing beats it," senior
Ben Wright said. "Brews, football, and polish
sausage are a great combination. I might even come
here for the next home game."

Having a winning football program has created a
new level of enthusiasm and giddiness among the
fans of the Cardinal. As the game began, every play
with so much as a hint of success brought a raucous
cheer from the masses.
One student went overboard, urging on the
defense with a "Kill him!" before every single play.
For both the team and the fans, the highlight of
the game was clearly Glyn Milburn's 75-yard punt
return for a touchdown with 4 minutes 38 seconds
left in the first quarter. Everyone rose elatedly to
their feet and strangers became instant friends with
a round of high fives.
On a night with little offense, Cardinal support
ers searched for new targets for their cheers. One
such target was Ron George, who registered three
punishing sacks to the delight of the more blood
thirsty fans in attendance.
Another was senior punter Paul Stonehouse, who
enjoyed one of the best games of his career. As he
lined up for his first kick, followers at The Oasis
derided him for his tendency to boot short line
drives. His first punt was a 60-yarder, however, and
he earned himself some new boosters by averaging
43 yards on 10 punts.
With Stanford's ranking climbing to new heights,
a lot more students are induced to revel in the
team's success. One such fan was sophomore Millie
Chu, who saw the game from John Dough's pizzeria.
Just like The Oasis, John Dough's was filled to the
rafters with screaming fans.
"It was boring," said Chu. "The defense was
good but the offense was totally stale. And I don't
know why the UCLA players tuck up their jerseys.
They were gross and their bellies were jiggling all
over."
Caught up in the excitement of another big win,
the group at John Dough's ended the night with a
feverish chant of "Rose Bowl! Rose Bowl!"
At The Oasis, fans were so wiped out by the heat
and length of the experience that they filed quickly
out of the bar to begin the journey home.
Other Stanford favorites such as Pudley's and
The Dutch Goose reported similar crowds. One
enterprising group, eager to see the game while
avoiding the crush, chipped in to rent a hotel room
with cable television.
"It was great," said Andrew Nevins, a junior. "We
got in for about five bucks apiece and brought our
own food."
Next week, the Cardinal plays at home against
the Arizona Wildcats, so there's no need to find a
television. For the next away game, however, a trip
to one of the area pubs is a worthwhile experience.
Just bring a lot of excess energy.

hamburgers, pizza, and onion rings.
One student pondered the nature of the feast.
"For short-term pleasure, nothing beats it," senior
Ben Wright said. "Brews, football, and polish
sausage are a great combination. I might even come
here for the next home game."

Having a winning football program has created a
new level of enthusiasm and giddiness among the
fans of the Cardinal. As the game began, every play
with so much as a hint of success brought a raucous
cheer from the masses.
One student went overboard, urging on the
defense with a "Kill him!" before every single play.
For both the team and the fans, the highlight of
the game was clearly Glyn Milburn's 75-yard punt
return for a touchdown with 4 minutes 38 seconds
left in the first quarter. Everyone rose elatedly to
their feet and strangers became instant friends with
a round of high fives.
On a night with little offense, Cardinal support
ers searched for new targets for their cheers. One
such target was Ron George, who registered three
punishing sacks to the delight of the more blood
thirsty fans in attendance.
Another was senior punter Paul Stonehouse, who
enjoyed one of the best games of his career. As he
lined up for his first kick, followers at The Oasis
derided him for his tendency to boot short line
drives. His first punt was a 60-yarder, however, and
he earned himself some new boosters by averaging
43 yards on 10 punts.
With Stanford's ranking climbing to new heights,
a lot more students are induced to revel in the
team's success. One such fan was sophomore Millie
Chu, who saw the game from John Dough's pizzeria.
Just like The Oasis, John Dough's was filled to the
rafters with screaming fans.
"It was boring," said Chu. "The defense was
good but the offense was totally stale. And I don't
know why the UCLA players tuck up their jerseys.
They were gross and their bellies were jiggling all
over."
Caught up in the excitement of another big win,
the group at John Dough's ended the night with a
feverish chant of "Rose Bowl! Rose Bowl!"
At The Oasis, fans were so wiped out by the heat
and length of the experience that they filed quickly
out of the bar to begin the journey home.
Other Stanford favorites such as Pudley's and
The Dutch Goose reported similar crowds. One
enterprising group, eager to see the game while
avoiding the crush, chipped in to rent a hotel room
with cable television.
"It was great," said Andrew Nevins, a junior. "We
got in for about five bucks apiece and brought our
own food."
Next week, the Cardinal plays at home against
the Arizona Wildcats, so there's no need to find a
television. For the next away game, however, a trip
to one of the area pubs is a worthwhile experience.
Just bring a lot of excess energy.
