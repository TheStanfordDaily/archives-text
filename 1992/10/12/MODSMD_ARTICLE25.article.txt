# Women to play No.1 UNC
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Today's 4 p.m. women's soccer
match between No. 2 Stanford and
No. 1 North Carolina might veiy
well be a preview of the NCAA
final. With the playoffs less than a
month away, both squads are
undefeated and untied heading
into this afternoon's play.
"We are really excited," said
Stanford forward Sarah Rafanelli.
"Basically, we have nothing to
lose."
Since both teams are likely to
make the postseason regardless of
the outcome of the match, coach
Berhane Andeberhan views the
game as a learning tool.
He's been pleased with his
team's progress, but doesn't want
the squad to get satisfied merely
with solid play. With less than half
the season to go, consistent
progress is the goal, Andeberhan
said. One area where the Cardinal
could improve on already good
play is how the outside forwards
and midfielders should prepare to
center the ball toward the net.
"If a player under pressure
gets the ball in the danger zone
then they've done their job," he
said. But if the player isn't
marked closely, Andeberhan said
she should try to connect with a
specific player rather than loft
the ball in the vicinity of the for
wards.
"First check the player at the
near post and if she's not open,
look to the far post," he said.
"Sometimes neither of them will
be open or ready to receive the
ball. Then the player should hold
the ball longer or bypass those two
altogether and pass back to some
one coming upfield."
Along with the physical skills
that Andeberhan stressed, the
North Carolina match will likely
test Stanford's mental strength,
too. "In the past we've tried to

beat fired up teams by being even
more fired up," Andeberhan said.
"Now we're trying to find a happy
medium — balanced without
being stale."
It was the latter that the Cardi
nal had to guard against in Satur
day's 5-0 blowout of Brigham
Young.
"We just wanted to maintain
the intensity at a plateau, no ups
and downs," said the Stanford
coach, who praised his squad's
sharp passing game.
"Against some teams you relax
and tend to get away with cheating
and we were trying to avoid that,"
he said.
Rafanelli, who notched a goal
and two assists, said it wasn't dif
ficult to get psyched up for a lesser
opponent.
"You play hard each game
because every game is preparation
for the next," she said. "You create
habits by playing like you want to
play every game."
Against BYU, Stanford came
out fast and scored in the opening
three minutes. Dena Dey took a
pass from Julie Foudy and
knocked it in the net 2 minutes, 42
seconds into the game.
Sweeper Jessica Fischer scored
the second goal off an assist from
Rafanelli. Just before halftime,
senior Jen Potok blasted a center
ing pass to Vicky Haring. The
freshman slid the ball into the
right corner of the net for her first
goal of the season.
At the half, Cardinal assistant
coach lan Sawyers reiterated the

focus on clean, crisp play.
"We concentrated on the details
that we've tried to impress on
them throughout the season —
clean receiving, when to dispute
the ball, aerial possession — stuff
like that," he said.
When play resumed, Stanford
again took charge. Early in the sec
ond half, Rafanelli took the ball
down the right side and outran her
defender. But then another
Cougar back slid over to cover her
and Rafanelli appeared to be boxed
in the corner.
However, the speedy forward
beat the second defender and
sliced the ball across the penalty
box to a wide-open Andrea John
son, who tapped the ball past the
diving goalie.
Five minutes later, a similar
play developed as Rafanelli split
defenders deep in the BYU zone.
But instead of passing, she rocket
ed a shot to the left corner. The
ball ricocheted off the goalpost and
bounced back into the net.
With Kristin Hulvey getting
one of the assists on Rafanelli's
score, a total of eight players com
bined on Stanford's five goals,
making the Cardinal attack bal
anced but unpredictable.
The squad strived for the same
qualities on defense. After the
team had built a lead, Andeberhan
implemented a high-pressure
defense, which swarmed the
Cougar fullbacks deep in their
zone whenever they had posses
sion of the ball.
"We're good at low-pressure
defense but we wanted to work on
high-pressure so we can make
adjustments during a game," said
Andeberhan, who said Stanford
may use similar tactics against the
Tar Heels.
"We're prepared for anything,"
he said of today's showdown. "But
we expect to learn something from
this game. If we do our jobs, we'll
see them again in the playoffs."

match between No. 2 Stanford and
No. 1 North Carolina might veiy
well be a preview of the NCAA
final. With the playoffs less than a
month away, both squads are
undefeated and untied heading
into this afternoon's play.
"We are really excited," said
Stanford forward Sarah Rafanelli.
"Basically, we have nothing to
lose."
Since both teams are likely to
make the postseason regardless of
the outcome of the match, coach
Berhane Andeberhan views the
game as a learning tool.
He's been pleased with his
team's progress, but doesn't want
the squad to get satisfied merely
with solid play. With less than half
the season to go, consistent
progress is the goal, Andeberhan
said. One area where the Cardinal
could improve on already good
play is how the outside forwards
and midfielders should prepare to
center the ball toward the net.
"If a player under pressure
gets the ball in the danger zone
then they've done their job," he
said. But if the player isn't
marked closely, Andeberhan said
she should try to connect with a
specific player rather than loft
the ball in the vicinity of the for
wards.
"First check the player at the
near post and if she's not open,
look to the far post," he said.
"Sometimes neither of them will
be open or ready to receive the
ball. Then the player should hold
the ball longer or bypass those two
altogether and pass back to some
one coming upfield."
Along with the physical skills
that Andeberhan stressed, the
North Carolina match will likely
test Stanford's mental strength,
too. "In the past we've tried to

beat fired up teams by being even
more fired up," Andeberhan said.
"Now we're trying to find a happy
medium — balanced without
being stale."
It was the latter that the Cardi
nal had to guard against in Satur
day's 5-0 blowout of Brigham
Young.
"We just wanted to maintain
the intensity at a plateau, no ups
and downs," said the Stanford
coach, who praised his squad's
sharp passing game.
"Against some teams you relax
and tend to get away with cheating
and we were trying to avoid that,"
he said.
Rafanelli, who notched a goal
and two assists, said it wasn't dif
ficult to get psyched up for a lesser
opponent.
"You play hard each game
because every game is preparation
for the next," she said. "You create
habits by playing like you want to
play every game."
Against BYU, Stanford came
out fast and scored in the opening
three minutes. Dena Dey took a
pass from Julie Foudy and
knocked it in the net 2 minutes, 42
seconds into the game.
Sweeper Jessica Fischer scored
the second goal off an assist from
Rafanelli. Just before halftime,
senior Jen Potok blasted a center
ing pass to Vicky Haring. The
freshman slid the ball into the
right corner of the net for her first
goal of the season.
At the half, Cardinal assistant
coach lan Sawyers reiterated the

focus on clean, crisp play.
"We concentrated on the details
that we've tried to impress on
them throughout the season —
clean receiving, when to dispute
the ball, aerial possession — stuff
like that," he said.
When play resumed, Stanford
again took charge. Early in the sec
ond half, Rafanelli took the ball
down the right side and outran her
defender. But then another
Cougar back slid over to cover her
and Rafanelli appeared to be boxed
in the corner.
However, the speedy forward
beat the second defender and
sliced the ball across the penalty
box to a wide-open Andrea John
son, who tapped the ball past the
diving goalie.
Five minutes later, a similar
play developed as Rafanelli split
defenders deep in the BYU zone.
But instead of passing, she rocket
ed a shot to the left corner. The
ball ricocheted off the goalpost and
bounced back into the net.
With Kristin Hulvey getting
one of the assists on Rafanelli's
score, a total of eight players com
bined on Stanford's five goals,
making the Cardinal attack bal
anced but unpredictable.
The squad strived for the same
qualities on defense. After the
team had built a lead, Andeberhan
implemented a high-pressure
defense, which swarmed the
Cougar fullbacks deep in their
zone whenever they had posses
sion of the ball.
"We're good at low-pressure
defense but we wanted to work on
high-pressure so we can make
adjustments during a game," said
Andeberhan, who said Stanford
may use similar tactics against the
Tar Heels.
"We're prepared for anything,"
he said of today's showdown. "But
we expect to learn something from
this game. If we do our jobs, we'll
see them again in the playoffs."
