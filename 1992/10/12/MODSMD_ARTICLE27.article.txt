# Golfers grapple for glory in Washington Intercollegiate
## 
### Andy Collins 
Quick — what comes to mind when
you think of golf?
If your only thoughts are of Bill Mur
ray, gophers, and plastic explosives,
then you may be overlooking a group of
unsung heroes — the lady linksters of
Stanford.
Following a fourth-place finish at last
year's NCAA Championships at Tempe,
Ariz. — the highest ever for the Cardinal
— the women boast a No. 6 ranking in
the Golf World pre-season coaches' poll
going into their first match, the Wash-

ington Intercollegiate at Seattle, being
played today through Wednesday.
Despite losing its top two players,
the caliber of this year's team was
apparently high enough to convince
the fourteen Division I women's coach
es voting in the poll that Stanford rep
resents a real threat to defending
NCAA champion San Jose State
(ranked No. 1 pre-season) and other
golf powerhouses.
The coaches even ranked Stanford
ahead of Arizona, who follows its sec
ond-place finish last year with a No. 7
pre-season ranking.

Stanford returns four of its top seven
players from last year's squad, including
Martha Richards, a fifth-year senior
who has been described as one of the
longest hitters in the collegiate game.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal loses
second-team All-American and All-
Pacific 10 Conference star Audrey
Wooding, who finished third at the
NCAA Championships last year.
Other 1992 graduates included Adele
Moore and Stephanie Davis.
Head coach Tim Baldwin, in his 14th
year at the helm of the Cardinal, leads
the team to Sahalee Country Club this

week. A par-72 course, Sahalee was
described by Baldwin as "the biggest,
best, and toughest golf course we play
all year." Stanford takes its top five
players, as determined by a 54-hole
qualifier last week.
The lineup is headed by Richards,
who some hoops fans may recognize
from her play on the Stanford women's
basketball team during her first three
years here.
Also starting for the Cardinal is
junior Melinda Daniels, who looks to
continue the success she experienced
toward the end of last season, including

a ninth-place finish at the California
Intercollegiate Championship.
Rounding out the lineup are veteran
sophomores Jamille Jose and Amy
Lawrence and freshman Vicky Strada.
Coach Baldwin looks for strong com
petition this week from top-ten powers
San Jose State and Arizona, as well as
from BYU, Oklahoma, New Mexico,
Oregon, and the hosting Washington
Huskies.
Other teams participating in the
match include Hawaii, Long Beach
State, Oregon State, San Francisco,
Wyoming, and Washington State.
