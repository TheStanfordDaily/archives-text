## No.2 Cardinal ups Pac-10 mark to 5-1 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
After a heartbreaking loss
at home last weekend to No.l
UCLA, the second-ranked
Stanford women's volleyball
team stormed back in Pacific
10 Conference play this week
end to sweep both Arizona and
Arizona State on the road.
The Cardinal (11-1, 5-1 in
Pac-10 play) easily handled
the Wildcats and the Sun Dev
ils 3-0 in each match, led by
the play of tri-captain Bev
Oden, senior hitter Jennifer
Jackson, and freshman hitter
Cary Wendell.
On Friday, Stanford began
its road trip in Tucson against
the Wildcats of Arizona, as
Stanford head coach Don Shaw
looked to bag his elusive 100 th
Pac-10 win as a head coach.
The Cardinal answered the call
by sweeping the host Wildcats
15-8, 15-8, 15-10. Stanford
cruised to the win through out
standing play by Oden, who
registered 14 kills and nine digs
for the match, and Jackson,
who added 14 kills and seven
digs. Freshman Cary Wendell
also turned in a career-high
performance for Stanford, hit
ting .414 on the night with 15
kills and five digs.
For Oden, however, the
mtyor obstacle for the Cardinal
was not the host Wildcats, but
the temperature of their arena.
"We had a problem getting into
the game," said Oden. "That
gym (McKale Center) gets real
ly cold, so we really didn't work
up a sweat right away."
However, Oden said that it
didn't take long for the Cardi
nal to get its blood, and its
offense, moving. "At first, we
were hitting a lot of balls wide,

or into the net, but as the
match went on we were passing
much better, and then we
scored points."
Stanford then traveled on to
Tempe to face No. 19 Arizona
State on Saturday. The Sun
Devils appeared to have prob
lems against the Cardinal all
night, as Stanford put together
team play and superior execu
tion to sweep the match 15-6,
15-10, 15-5.
The senior trio of Kristi
Paaso, Jackson, and Oden
spearheaded the Cardinal
effort against the Sun Devils.
Paaso had 12 kills and 10 digs
for the match, while Jackson
added eight kills and Oden
recorded six blocks. Hitter
Anne Wicks also contributed
nine kills for the Cardinal on
the night.
"They really couldn't keep
up with us," said Oden. "We
cleaned up our hitting and
passing mistakes early on, and
we felt like we executed the
way we needed to."
Stanford now leads the all
time series with Arizona State
22-2, including a 13-0 record
against the Sun Devils in Pac
-10 play.
Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.,
Stanford will host California in
the Big Match at Maples Pavil
ion. Stanford will look to win
Bay Area bragging rights over
the Golden Bears, as well as
improve their 5-1 Pac-10
record, which puts them in sec
ond place behind UCLA.
The Cardinal hopes to get a
near-capacity crowd for Tues
day's match against the
Bears, as Stanford boasts an
average home attendance at
women's volleyball games
that ranks second in the
nation this year.
