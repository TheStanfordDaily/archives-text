# Soccer silences State shooters in shutout

### Kathryn Yang 
The Stanford men's soccer team (7-4-0, 2-
1) came out roaring against conference rival
Oregon State (8-4-0, 1-2) last Sunday en route
to posting an impressive 3-0 shutout before a
home crowd at Maloney Field.
Freshman forward Carmen D'Onofrio
started off the first-half scoring onslaught
with a spectacular goal two minutes into the
contest. Aided by Robert Brophy's early cross
through the defense, D'Onofrio caught the
pass on his head and pushed it into the far
right corner for the goal.
The Cardinal scoring drive continued mid
way through the period as they kept the pres
sure on the Oregon State defenders with tight
controlled passes and a regular pounding at
the goal. Once again, D'Onofrio and Brophy
teamed up for a second quick score.
Brophy mirrored the Stanford team's
tenacity and concentration on that drive by
finally putting the ball in the net after the
Beaver goalkeeper grew flustered and dropped
the ball off of a D'Onofrio shot on goal.
Backfielder Ricky Goad then rounded out
the scoring at the close of the first period on a
perfect assist dished off by midfielder Joel

Russell.
"We are really getting things clicking
together for us now," said senior goalkeeper
and co-captain Kyle Krpata. "Last weekend
we had a real scoring drought on offense, but
today we turned it all around."
"The guys up front were splitting defenders
with their passes and attacking quickly. I
think our performance in the first half was
probably the best soccer we have played all
year."
Coach Colin Lindores also praised his
team's first half play. "We executed every
thing perfectly today," he said. "We tried to
get the ball into their attacking half before the
defense got back, because in our two previous
games, which we lost, we were too slow in get
ting the ball up. The defense would already be
set up and we couldn't penetrate and score.
But, fortunately, that was not the case today."
Although the Cardinal was shut out in the
second half, their level of play never dropped
as they went on to top the Beavers in shots on
goal by a margin of nine to six.
"I would have liked to see at least another
goal in the second period, but overall I'm
pleased with the way we played today," Lin
dores said.

Krpata, who registered his third shutout of
the season, attributed the team's clean play on
defense to first-time sweeper Jason Keyes.
Keyes was a pre-game replacement for sopho
more JefT Kogl, who is still nursing a bad
ankle.
"Shutting out Oregon State the way we did
can be a major turning point for this team,"
Lindores said. "A tremendous win like this,
which featured excellent play on both offense
and defense, definitely keeps us in the playoff
picture. It's looking good now, but we're not
out of the woods yet."
Next up, the Cardinal will face the St.
Mary's Gaels on Wednesday in a non-confer
ence game before heading out onto the road
for a crucial match-up against California.
After that, they will enjoy an eight-game
homestand to close out the season before
heading into postseason play.
"We are on a roll now," said senior mid
fielder and co-captain Randy Mann. "Before,
we were putting too much pressure on our
selves, but now we know to just go out and
play our brand of soccer. They're all big
games from here on out, but we just got to
keep things going and take one game at a
time."
