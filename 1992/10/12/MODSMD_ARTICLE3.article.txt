# Superintendent not first to forge degree
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
San Jose's superintendent of
schools is not the first to have
faked his way to a Stanford de
gree, according to Registrar Jack
Farrell.
"A couple of times a week, em
ployers request verification and
there is no record of the person,"
Farrell said, adding that the Uni
versity threatens to take legal ac
tion if the deception continues.
Superintendent Jim Baugh
man resigned last Thursday after
admitting he lied about having a
doctoral degree and fabricated his
Stanford transcripts.
The Registrar's Office receives
five to 10 calls a day checking on
people who claim Stanford as their
alma mater, according to Farrell.
"Anybody can call to find out
about anybody."
Baughman — who was tripped
up after seven years by a Stanford
graduate student searching for
the superintendent's dissertation
— may be one of the best-known
people to fail that test recently,
but Farrell said he is not unique.
In 1989, newspaper reports re

vealed that Jose Maria Cordoba
Montoya, a top adviser to Mexico's
president, falsely stated on his re
sume that he had a doctorate from
Stanford's Department of Eco
nomics.
"People on the outside are pret
ty gullible," he said. But Stanford
does make an effort to curb similar
deceptions, asking for the names
of self-proclaimed graduates who
don't check out.
"If we can get an address, we
will write them a nasty letter"
telling them to stop, Farrell said.
After politely asking whether they
might have changed their name
since college, the letter suggests
legal action could be taken.
One such case is currently pend
ing against "a student who forged a
Stanford transcript and managed
to get into law school," Farrell said.
The student did graduate but
then doctored his transcript, ac
cording to Farrell. Last year, the
Faculty Senate voted to rescind
the student's degree.
"We're as vigilant as we can
possibly be," Farrell said, noting
that his office last year changed to
a special kind of transcript paper
which will leave the words "copy,
copy, copy" if someone tries to
photocopy it.
Even these efforts can't pre
vent all deceit. "We only hear
about the ones that don't get
away with it," Farrell said.
Some fakes, however, are
almost impossible not to spot.
The Registrar's Office received a
fabricated Stanford diploma Fri
day, he said, that didn't come
close.
Besides bad grammar, the
diploma looked fraudulent. "I
don't think it was even done
on a Mac(intosh)," Farrell
said.
