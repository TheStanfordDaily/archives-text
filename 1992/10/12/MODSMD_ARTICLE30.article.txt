# Water polo drowns So. Cal schools in sweep
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Normally, red tide refers to
algae.
But to USC and UCLA, "red
tide" spelled defeat.
Stanford's water polo team
solidified its No. 2 ranking in
national polls as well as in its own
minds by defeating the third
ranked Trojans and sixth-ranked
Bruins this weekend.
"When you win back-to-back
games against top teams at their
pools, and come back from behind
against USC, it shows you belong
at the top," said Stanford head
coach Dante Dettamanti.
The Cardinal's Southern Cali
fornia sweep began with a close 9-
7 game at USC on Friday. Stan
ford struggled defensively in the
first half and entered intermis
sion down 4-3. But before the half
was over, the Cardinal started its
comeback.

With two seconds left, sopho
more Frank Schneider converted
on a corner pass from senior cap
tain Chip Blankenhorn, drawing
the contest to within one. From
there, momentum swung. Stan
ford tightened its defense in the
second half while scoring six of its
nine total goals.
The Trojans mounted a come
back and drew to within one in
the fourth quarter. But on a
Southern Cal fast break, fresh
man Jeremy Laster intercepted a
Trojan transition pass and the
Cardinal capitalized on the
turnover, putting Stanford out of
reach for good.
As usual, sophomore Wolf
Wigo led the Cardinal with four
goals, while senior John
Matarangas and Schneider each
contributed two. Junior Chris
Wallin added one score, and
junior goalkeeper Larry Bercutt
gathered five saves.
Although Stanford fared well,

it lost Blankenhorn to a hand
injury; his status is unknown.
Blankenhorn's importance
would show against the Bruins
the next day. In the first quar
ter, UCLA scored three goals
from the centerforward position,
where Blankenhorn normally
defends; this created a 3-3 tie at
the end of the seven-minute
period.
The Cardinal responded to the
challenge, however. Once again,
Stanford's defense tightened in
the last three quarters while the
offense outscored the Bruins 5-1
for a 8-4 victory.
Seven different Cardinal play
ers scored, led by Wigo's two
goals. Senior Chris Smith,
Matarangas, Laster, junior Brian
Clemens, Schneider, and junior
Antonio Busquets each tacked on
one. Bercutt deflected four goal
attempts.
Dettamanti thought his team
played well overall despite the

initial lapses in defense. He noted
that the fast-break counterattack
ran smoothly, and that the Cardi
nal 6-on-5 power play was effi
cient, scoring 50 percent of the
time, while Stanford held its
opponents to just 30 percent effi
ciency in 6-on-5 situations.
However, Dettamanti does feel
that the Trojan and Bruin con
tests brought out aspects of the
game on which his team needs to
improve. His greatest concern is
defense on the centerforward
spot, especially with Blanken
horn out. In an upset loss a week
ago against fifth-ranked UC-
Irvine, defense on the centerfor
ward proved to be Stanford's
downfall.
Dettamanti also said he
wants his team simply to score
more. "We can score on any
body," he said. "We should also
be able to hold opponents to five
goals. So we should win every
game 10-5."
