# Women power golf at Stanford
## 
### Neerad Lai 
The golf course often replaces the corporate office
as a more informal way of conducting business. Yet
many women executives have been left out of this
board room-under-the-trees simply because golf has
traditionally been a male-dominated sport.
Recently on the Stanford Golf Course, however, a
group of women tried to change all that through a
one-day clinic designed to teach women the value of
golf as a business tool.
"Women need to play golf for business.. .[other
wise] they can't accomplish the same feats men do.
Through golf, a hurried 10- minute meeting becomes
four hours to do business," said Jean Osachuk,
spokesperson for the Boston-based Jane Blalock Co.,
which co-sponsored the clinic with the Mazda
Motors Company.
Initiated by a group of players from the Ladies
Professional Golf Association, the clinic brought
together Bay Area executives including business
women from such companies as Hewlett-Packard,
Chase-Manhattan Bank, Money Magazine and
Saatchi & Saatchi.
According to Osachuk, "The response of the
women [at the Stanford clinic] was energetic and
amazing. We received more than we expected."
The clinic attempted to teach women to play bet

ter golf and to do business on the course at the same
time. The barrier to this in the past, according to
event organizers, has not been as much a lack of
education, but more one of fear.
"Many women are intimidated by golf, because
it has been so traditionally male-dominated. I
believe the clinic helped [women] to overcome
their fear and made them feel more comfortable
with the sport," said Patty Clark, a participant in
the clinic.
In addition to bringing golf to women, the event
also had a dual purpose of raising money for
research on breast cancer.
Participants paid a fee of $150 for the day. The
money collected was supplemented by a donation
from Mazda Motors to total $10,000. An auction was
also held during the clinic.
During a lunch-time ceremony, a check was pre
sented to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer
Research Fund.
The entire clinic idea has been given a significant
amount of media coverage, from local news to
national broadcasting, and even USA Today. Given
the strong interest, the Blalock Co. hopes to expand
the program and make the Stanford clinic an annu
al event.
Six such golf clinics have been held all over the
country since the program began last year.
