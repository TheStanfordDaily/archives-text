While other Stanford students
celebrate Columbus Day, mem
bers of the Stanford American
Indian Organization and
MEChA, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent group, have been celebrat
ing O'odham Tash, or the Day of
the People.
The weekend-long celebra
tion, co-sponsored by the groups,
commenced Friday with an

"Anti-Quincentennial Rally."
The rally, attended by about 50
people, was planned to coincide
with the 500 th anniversary of
Christopher Columbus' arrival
in the Americas.
Afler a traditional prayer and
honor song, SAIO co-chair Myra
Parker opened the rally by sharing
her perspective on Columbus Day.

no meaning for me," she said.
"Most Native Americans scoff at
the idea of this so-called discovery."
Parker pointed out several falla
cies associated with the holiday,
including the fact that Columbus
never actually set foot in what now
is the United States.
"In my experience, it was given
that Columbus was not capable of
discovering the end of his nose, let
alone a whole continent," she said.
SAIO co-chair Isabel Bourrelle
read an official statement prepared
by the group.
"We dedicate this weekend to
those who have endured before us
the death, oppression and disease"
brought on by Europeans, she said.
Assistant Dean of Students Jim
Larimore invoked Gerhard

Casper's inaugural address, saying,
"Let the winds of freedom blow,
but this time let them carry a fun
damental change. The next 500
years belong to us."
Larimore called for better edu
cation regarding the history of
Columbus Day and encouraged
students to vote in the upcoming
election.
"We're going through a gener
ational change in this country,
and that includes you as well," he
said. "You are the first generation
of college students to live in this
kind of diversity."
Sharon Parker, director of the
Office of Multicultural Develop
ment, encouraged students of all
ethnicities to "understand all
aspects of our history, our heritage
and our future."
"It's important that this quin
centenary event be looked at not
simply as a celebration of Christo
pher Columbus, but an opportuni

ty for a new way of looking at his
tory and at the future," she said.
Representatives of the four eth
nic theme houses — Ujamaa,
Okada, Casa Zapata and
Muwekmah-Tah-Ruk — spoke on
their roles as student leaders and
educators.
Tamara Alvarado, a theme asso
ciate in Zapata, said she, like other
students at the rally, felt "confused
and full of rage."
"Often people ask me, why does
Casa Zapata exist? They might as
well ask me why I exist," she said.
One Muwekmah-Tah-Ruk resi
dent said he plans to write a letter
to the City of Palo Alto, asking it to
follow Berkeley's example by
changing Columbus Day to Indige
nous Peoples Day.
"While this action many be
small in stature, I am confident
that the repercussions will be
broad in the outside community,"
he said.
