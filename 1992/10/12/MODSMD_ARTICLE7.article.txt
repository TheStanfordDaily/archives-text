# O'odham Tash 'Day of the People' exalts culture
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Amid the light of fire and the
beating of drums, members of
Stanford's communities of color
discussed and celebrated their cul
tural heritage at a sunset-to-sun
rise celebration last night in the
lakebed of Lagunita.
"This is a community gather
ing for SAIO and MEChA. We
wanted to build some community
between the two groups because

traditionally they've been sepa
rate," said Stanford American In
dian Organization co-chair Myra
Parker. "We want to celebrate our
survival over the past 500 years.
"We're here for ourselves, not
because we're protesting Colum
bus — although that is key for us
because of the events he began,"
she said.
More than 50 students and fac
ulty from Stanford were joined by
a group of students from UC-
Santa Cruz and several people

from the surrounding community
for the program on the eve of the
celebration of Columbus Day.
Last night's activity, which was
sponsored by SAIO and MEChA,
was part of a weekend of events
called O'odham Tash or Day of the
People.
Most students said they
planned to stay all night, although
some cited homework and classes
as reasons to leave before dawn.

more called the evening "a night
for us, for the people, for celebra
tion, for talking and getting to
know each other."
"The events that the Native
American community have planned
have been intended to get people to

think in a forward moving way
about the state of the world and
their hopes for the future," he
added.
Students sat on blankets
around a campfire, performed
round dances and listened to vari
ous speakers. Many looked at the
evening as a way of connecting
themselves with their heritage.
"Tonight I'm trying to get more
in touch with my native roots since
I'm half European and half Native

American. For me, my dancing is a
way of getting in touch with these
feelings," said sophomore Jim Ruet.
Family was emphasized as a part
of heritage. "I hope after tonight we
will all become a family like la
familia at Zapata and at MEChA,"
said junior Julia Gonzalez.
"We're not protesting," she
said. "We aren't going to be bash
ing on Columbus. The thing we're
celebrating is that we're still alive
after 500 years of oppression."
