USAir strikers return to work
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Some USAir machin
ists returned to work yesterday, helping to bring the
airline to full service after striking workers agreed to
make wage concessions in return for job security.
A full complement of 2,712 flights were sched
uled to begin this morning, said John Bronson, an
airline spokesman. The company had been flying
roughly 60 percent of its schedule since more than
8,000 machinists went on strike Oct. 5.
The company said wage and benefit reductions
were necessary for it to survive. If the job action
had continued the company would most likely have
been forced to reorganize under federal bankrupt
cy protection or to hire replacement workers.
Israel sends forces to stop riots
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel rushed reinforce
ments to the occupied territories yesterday to
quell rioting that left a Palestinian teen-ager dead

and 36 people wounded in clashes with troops.
In the occupied Gaza Strip, a Jewish settler
was killed by an Arab who struck the settler with
a hoe, the army said.
The slayings came on the third day of clashes
in the past week between troops and Palestinians
demonstrating in solidarity with Arab prisoners
who had been on a hunger strike since Sept. 27 to
demand better conditions.
UN to check Iraq missile sites
MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) — A team of U.N.
weapons experts bound for Iraq will look at previ
ously uninspected sites for up to 200 Scud mis
siles that intelligence sources believe may still be
hidden, the team leader said yesterday.
Iraq had unsuccessfully appealed to the United
Nations to delay the two-week inspection until
after U.S. elections in November, arguing that
Washington might try to provoke a confrontation
to help President Bush.
