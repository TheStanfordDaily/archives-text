### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - About 2,000 people
opposed to celebrating Christopher Columbus'
arrival in America marched and rallied yesterday to
denounce what they called five centuries of oppres
sion and the genocide of Native Americans.
Chanting protesters apparently prevented the re
enactment of Columbus' landing in the Caribbean in
1492, an annual event scheduled on the city's water
front.
"This is to protest the lies that have been said
throughout history about Columbus' being this
great man who discovered America," said Brenda
Sandburg of the All Peoples Congress, one of the
groups sponsoring the protest.
"He didn't come here to discover America. He
invaded it. . . . He committed genocide against the
Native American people," she said.
The protest at the waterfront was peaceful, but
someone hit a police radio car with a Molotov cock
tail during the city's annual Columbus Day parade

later in the day, said police Officer Nick Iterovich.
No one was injured.
About 40 people were arrested at the parade
through North Beach, the city's Italian neighbor
hood, including several people suspected of throwing
the Molotov cocktail, police said. The others were
arrested for investigation of interfering with a
parade or inciting a riot.
Some carried banners reading, "550 Years of
Resistance and Survival," "Condemn Colonialism,"
and "Columbus Was A Criminal." One woman car
ried a sign claiming Columbus was "a cannibal,"
and several boats were draped with protest banners
in San Francisco Bay.
"This is 500 years later and (indigenous) people
are still fighting for basic rights. There are still rea
sons to fight — for rights, land and survival," said
protester John D. Forsyth, a law student and mem
ber of the Wailaki-Concow tribe who grew up on the
Covelo reservation in Northern California.
