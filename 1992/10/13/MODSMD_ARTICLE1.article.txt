## Los Munequitos plays traditional Cuban music on first U.S. tour 
### Michael Slemmer 
The Cuban dance group Los Munequitos de
Matanzas enlivened White Plaza yesterday, pre
senting traditional, religion-inspired music and
movement as part of the group's first-ever tour of
the United States.
Ten different dances, each portraying a differ
ent ritual from the Uruba religion in Cuba com
prised the show, which began at noon and lasted
almost an hour.
"This is a once in a lifetime experience," said Susan
Cashion, a senior lecturer in dance and coordinator of
Ballet Folklorico de Stanford. "It took eight years of
work to get the appropriate visas for the group to come
to the United States for a one-month tour."
The University performance was organized by
the Lively Arts at Stanford.
Dancers wore colorful clothing representing
particular Uruba deities. Musicians played drums
and other instruments and sang in Spanish.

More than 100 people came to watch the 17 Mune
quitos — the singers and dancers — and five drum
mers. But few were students. Most of the onlookers,
including amateur drummers and other fans, came
from the surrounding area to see the event.
Peter Miller, who lives and works in Palo Alto,
commented, "I came because I'm an amateur
drummer myself. . . . These guys are great."
Many of the people in the crowd were familiar
with the music being played. Spectator Neil DeSil
va of Palo Alto said, "I grew up with these ritual
songs and dances (when I lived in Cubal. This is a
chance I never thought I would have."
The group began its tour yesterday with a con
cert at the cultural center in San Francisco, mark
ing its 40th anniversary. In addition, the perform
ers will travel to New York in December for a
recording session, Cashion said.
In addition to their performance, the group of
fered an afternoon drumming clinic and an
evening dancing class in Roble Gym, Cashion said.
