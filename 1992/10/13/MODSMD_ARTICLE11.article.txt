## 5.9 temblor leaves 318 dead, 3,192 injured; dam spared 
### 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) â€” One of
the strongest earthquakes to hit
Egypt in modern times toppled
buildings and houses yesterday,
killing 318 and injuring 3,192, the
government news agency said.
More than 100 children died in
stampedes out of swaying schools,
and rescuers struggled into the
night to dig survivors from the
debris.
The midafternoon quake regis
tered 5.9 on the Richter scale and
was centered about 20 miles
southwest of Cairo, only a few
miles from the pyramids and the
Sphinx on the Giza Plateau. But
Egyptian officials said the ancient
monuments apparently escaped
damage from the 20-second quake.
The quake also spared Aswan
High Dam, which holds back 310-
mile-long Lake Nasser, the
world's largest artificial lake. A
serious breach would send an esti
mated 110 billion gallons of water
gushing straight down the Nile

Valley, where almost all of
Egypt's 55 million people live.
The security force's operations
room in Cairo said last night that
116 buildings were reported
destroyed or badly damaged
throughout Egypt.
Hardest hit were Cairo, with
127 dead and 2,139 injured, and
Giza to the south, with 128 dead
and 700 hurt, it said in a state
ment.
People thronged Cairo's
streets after the quake, many
seemingly in a daze. One woman
stood on a sidewalk screaming
while a knot of people sat in a
downtown square, tears streaking
down their cheeks.
Thousands of people crowded
around the ruins of a 14-story
apartment building in the suburb
of Heliopolis late yesterday while
four bulldozers cleared debris
under floodlights. Associated
Press reporter Nejla Sammakia
said the 75 apartments collapsed

into a heap of crushed concrete
and twisted steel.
An ambulance worker said five
people were pulled alive from the
rubble before nightfall. There was
no word on whether anyone died
there.
Fahima Taha Aly Suleiman, a
resident of Maadi, south of Cairo,
said she saw a schoolgirl, about
14, struck in the head and killed
by a rock falling from a collapsing
wall. A crumbling wall in down
town Cairo killed a worker in a
kebab shop.
In Shubra, a poorer Cairo dis
trict, security officials said two
girls were killed in one collapsed
school, and 13 children were
injured in another.
The quake was preceded by a
roar.
"At first I thought it was a
bomb in the bank," said Samy
Mohammed Ali, a lawyer. "Then I
saw people running, and I real
ized it was an earthquake."
