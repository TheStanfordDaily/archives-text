## Fix inconsistency 
### 
The University needs to
use opportunity to treat
domestic partners fairly

The university faces
an extraordinary opportuni
ty to right one of the great
inconsistencies in its policy of non
discrimination: to extend benefits
to domestic partners of faculty and
staff.
In a landmark decision two
years ago, Stanford became the
first university in the nation to
treat student domestic partners
the same as legal spouses of stu
dents. This meant everything from
opening married couple housing to
non-married domestic partners, to
granting library privileges and
offering health insurance.
The decision was based on the
belief that not extending such
basic benefits violated the spirit of
the University's policy barring dis
crimination on the basis of sexual
orientation.
The pending bill includes only
same-sex couples, not heterosexu
al ones. This is a crucial distinction
because a domestic partners' bene
fits parity policy seeks to protect
those whom the state's legal sys
tem does not recognize.
Under current California laws,
heterosexual couples have the
legal possibility of marriage while
gay couples do not.
This month, the Faculty Senate
must decide whether or not to adopt
a similar benefits parity plan for
faculty and staff domestic partners.
If approved, the measure will be
forwarded to University President
Gerhard Casper for his decision; if
he supports the bill, it will pass to
the Board of Trustees, where its
fate will ultimately be decided.
The proposal, passed by the
Medical School Faculty Senate last
month, is a litmus test of the Uni
versity's commitment to the basic
tenets of equality and justice. The
recent announcements by such

major corporations as Lotus and
Levi Strauss & Co. of similar
domestic partners policies give fur
ther impetus to the University
proposal.
One potential point of con
tention is that the faculty and staff
policy would cost the University a
significant amount of money com
pared to the student policy, which
costs very little.
The bill under consideration
proposes that same-sex partners
have access to medical and dental
coverage, athletic and library facil
ities, the tuition grant program
and all other benefits now offered
to employee spouses.
A subcommittee of the Univer
sity Committee on Faculty and
Staff Benefits estimates that
between 40 and 60 employees
would enroll as same-sex domestic
partners. It cited the annual cost of
such a policy at between $30,000
and $60,000. In a worse-case sce
nario, the cost was placed between
$115,000 and $175,000 a year.
Compared to the University's
current $24 million budget for med
ical benefits, that figure is extreme
ly small, especially in light of the
overwhelming message it would
send to the community and beyond.
One of the biggest traditional
obstacles against benefits parity is
finding an insurance company
willing to underwrite domestic
partners. However, the practice is
becoming more widespread.
Bankers United Life Assurance
the current student
insurer* recently, changed its policy
and extended coverage to domestic
partners, in what appears to be an
industry-wide trend.
Stanford set a national example
two years ago with its student
domestic partners policy. In so
doing, the University effectively
stepped in to fill a gaping void in
the nation's legal system: offering
equal rights to all couples, regard
less of sexual orientation.
Denying such equal treatment
to faculty and staff represents an
enormous contradiction and injus
tice within University policy.
