## Responsibility or happiness? 
### 
1 SPENT THE LAST WEEK IN
August in eastern Washington state
with Kirsten, my best friend since
seventh grade. Mostly I sat on the front
porch with a book in my hand and con
templated the view, which, as a rolling
swirl of freshly cut wheat fields and
newly tilled soil, looked like a marble
fudge cake in a wave pool.
I was there to make some of those Big
Decisions about life after Stanford.
Kirsten has the gift of making such deci
sions quickly and surely. She planned a
wedding in three days. She bought a
house in a weekend. It took me a week to
decide it was better to put tny posters up
with flticky-tack-than ptnrhpiilik Sd thtlrO
I was, seeking the secret from which good
decisions come.
Kirsten has assumed the responsibili
ty of a husband, two dogs, three horses
and four years of vet school in one sum
mer.
This is a little overwhelming for some
one whose home furnishings consist of a
bookcase and a pot. She is content to be
settled.
And as the days on the front porch
accumulate, I think I hear quiet. I see
peace. I bake brownies and nail crossbars
on the new fence. For a few moments I
think I will be moving in. The decision to
make myself happy seems like such an
easy and logical choice.
But then I begin to contemplate the

horizon line. I know that beyond the mar
ble-fudge cake are mountains. I become
restless for knowledge of the world, the
varieties of lives and places and choices
beyond the front porch.
And the varieties of frustrations and
prejudices and pain inevitably seep in
around the edges and draw some really
big mountains in my mind's eye. Anger
awakes from the lullaby that the tempo
rary contentment of landscape and
friendship has been singing — and
emerges as a constructive, empowering
decision to climb.
The whirring and clankings of the
world beyond the field found the
•part af.me thfat tfijedtcrfind it very impor
tant to rotaie thd-«tuffed animals on my
bed so that none of them would feel like I
loved it less than the others.
That part of me now wonders why
there is always another person standing
in the Safeway parking lot with a sign
that reads "Will work for food." It wants
to know how I can pull the plug on the
next television talk show that subtly sug
gests that women deserve to be date
raped.
Answering these sorts of questions is
frightening. A sense of social responsi
bility throws a rather large wrench into
the process of making decisions for the
sake of my personal happiness. I won
der if I have a strong enough stomach
to swallow willingly the bitterness that

a blatant look at the world presents. It
is tempting to spit it back as cynicism
or digest it as a sleeping-potion of indif
ference.
But it seems more frightening to me
NOT to see the view beyond the front
porch.
Of course I would like to live in a world
filled with good novels and furry blan
kets. Given reality, though, I would
rather start making a trail up one of
those mountains, than to sit in the isola
tion of a well-built house and wait for the
neighborhood to burn down.
I'm glad I can visit places like Colfax,
Wash., where there is sky and solitude
and security. And if the relationships of
people in this world resembled its rolling
golden hills, I would be happy to sit back
and eiyoy the view.
But the world steaming with poverty
and intolerance cuts a landscape more
like Mount St. Helens. So I'm glad I just
got a new pair of hiking boots. I may not
reach a summit in this lifetime. But the
view from the climb can only get better.
