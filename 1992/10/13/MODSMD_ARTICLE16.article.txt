Trapped in cultural logic with Christopher Columbus

IAM WRITING TO RESPOND TO
Brett Rogers' Oct. 12 column "Give
an old hero a break."
Instead of bashing him for being a non
sympathetic beneficiary of Columbus'
voyage, I would like to use his piece to
show how many are trapped in the cultur
al logic which doesn't make the distinc
tion between reality and perception of
reality.
In the article, Rogers tries to make the
point that we can't use our "modern"
understanding to analyze the "old
world's" values and ethics.
He writes "to ignore the awesome sig
nificance of [the introduction of the
European culture to the Americas]
because the values of the 20th century
are distinct from those of the 15th centu
ry borders on the absurd."
However, five paragraphs before, he
rhetorically questions, "I'm supposed to
ignore the man who had perhaps the
most significant effect on the direction of
history in the past millennium?"

The question is how can Brett Rogers
use his current "modern day" values to
assess that Columbus was indeed a man
of such admirable stature if others can
not make antithetical conclusions due to
their anachronistic ability to interpret
history?
I would like to point out that Rogers
and those who share his sentiments are
using their 20th century culturally pro
grammed eyes to "see" Christopher
Columbus as an icon, who in his words,
"united two hemispheres of the world,
ushering in a fantastically new era of
human history." Here we can see a differ
ence between reality and a culturally con
ditioned perception of reality.
The reality is that there are two land
masses with different peoples inhabiting
them. What is a Western perception of
reality is that the land masses are hemi
spheres, halves of a whole. Rogers tries to
distance himself from the polemic by
arguing that we shouldn't choose sides
but rather "accept the [achievers) for

what they were when they were."
He again is using these "eyes" to
"see" the event as an achievement in its
own right that should be, with all its
flaws, respected as such.
Telling the survivors of the American
holocaust to acknowledge the bad while
"seeing" the good is like a defense lawyer
telling a victim of rape in his closing argu
ments that "my client was once a neglect
ed and abused child. So we now shouldn't
look at what he did that night, when he
forcibly raped and impregnated this
woman, but rather look at the young boy
molested by a cold-hearted step-father
who is now trapped in a man's body."
Is the defendant a rapist or an abused
child? Is Columbus an instigator of geno
cide or an old hero that cannot be judged
by 20th century conventions?
My point is that now, 500 years later,
the issue can not be about Columbus
anymore or about which side is "right."
The issue must focus on the historical
origins and contemporary effects of cul

tural logic which legitimates the domi
nant perception of reality.
It is the same perception of reality
that "saw" the Tainos peoples as meek
and gentle people awaiting religious con
version, the same one that "saw"
Africans as legitimately enslavable and
three-fifths human, the same one that
"saw" indigenous tribes as obstacles to
western expansion and the same one that
now classifies white and non-white and
then "sees" minority issues as someone
else's problem.
We are all pawns in this social hierar
chy and are engulfed in this opaque sys
tem of understanding. So "legitimizing"
or "debunking" the Columbus myth once
and for all really isn't going to change
much.
However, looking at the systemic cul
tural logic that controls our perception of
this reality may actually be the place to
start in the quest for social change.
