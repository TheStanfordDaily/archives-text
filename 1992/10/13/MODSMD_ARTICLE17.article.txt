# Why Casper's public politics are debatable
## 
### 
University President Gerhard
Casper's comments as reported in the
Oct. 7 issue of The Daily are interesting.
He is quoted as saying he has "real
reservations" about last spring's adver
tisement condemning the Rodney King
verdict, signed by 700 faculty and staff,
which appeared in the New York Times.
The article goes on to quote him as
saying, "The minute I would take a
position â€” and indeed, your professors
take a position ... they are ending the
discussion" by silencing those who dis
agree.
I wonder how the president explains
an article he co-authored, while a profes
sor of law at the University of Chicago,

with Milton Friedman that appeared in
the Wall Street Journal on Oct. 21, 1987
during the Senate hearings on the nomi
nation of Robert Bork for the Supreme
Court.
Although the article was camouflaged
as a discussion of problems associated
with polls, the then Profs. Casper and
Friedman were, in reality, challenging
the results of a Harris Poll in which the
respondents declared by 57 percent that
the Bork nomination should be rejected.
It is also interesting that the same
Daily article referred to the president
going to the opera with a faculty mem
ber who, only a few weeks ago, played a
minor role in the Republican National
Convention.
Events like the Rodney King attempt
ed murder are as likely to occur in the
future, as they have in the past. When
and where such injustices occur, I hope

the president will not let his title deter
him from denouncing them.
