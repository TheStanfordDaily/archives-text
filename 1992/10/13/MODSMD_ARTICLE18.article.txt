# Resident assistants talk about upperclass dorms

### 
Three points on your Oct. 8 editorial
"RA-less residences." First, your facts
were off. Mirrielees RAs are not paid a
"salary equal to the average cost of room
and board." We're paid about half as
much.
Secondly, apartment-style residences
such as Mirrielees and the Suites are not
anonymous societies in which students
rarely leave their rooms except to steal
ofF to class.
We are communities just like other

residences and promote a large number
of programs and activities to build com
munity spirit. (You should know that â€”
several members of The Daily staff live
in Mirrielees.)
Thirdly, the responsibilities of an RA
in an apartment-style residence extend
far beyond keeping the master key. We
do the things that all RAs do: facilitate
community about the campus events,
take care of emergencies, help to solve
the problems that inevitably arise.. ..
This list increases as the year continues
Students greatly benefit from these
services, and we find it difficult to
believe that many would prefer to live
without them.
