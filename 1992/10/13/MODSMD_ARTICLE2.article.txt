In recognition of his achieve
ments in education, Henry Levin,
professor of economics and educa
tion, will receive a $50,000
Charles A. Dana Award for Pio
neering Achievements in Health
and Education.
Levin, who founded the Accel
erated Schools Project in 1986,
was also recently named one of the
nine "Standard Bearers" by The
New York Times for his educa
tional innovation.
The project is geared toward
helping "at-risk" students —
those close to failing or dropping
out of school — accelerate to a
level of excellence.
It is based on the idea that stu
dents who are working at low lev
els academically should be given
more, rather than less, challeng
ing work to force them to catch
up.
"The way to deal with at-risk
students is to look for their
strengths and build on them,"
Levin said. "These kids have tal
ents but they haven't had the ex
periences to develop them as main
stream students have. The way to
do this is not to slow them down
and punish them, but provide such
experiences for them by accelerat-

ingthem."
According to
Levin, more than
50 percent of all
at-risk students
don't graduate
from high school,
and many of the
ones who do actu
ally only attain an
eighth-grade

level academically.
Beth Keller, who is involved with
Levin's program, praised his work.
"I think it's very successful, and the
success has escalated and grown
past our expectations," she said. "As
of this year 300 schools across the
country are participating."
Levin's award is well-deserved,
she said. "After the thirty years
he's worked in education it's a real
nice validation of what he's been
doing."
The awards are sponsored by
the Charles A. Dana Foundation.
As many as five winners are cho
sen annually by a panel of 13 edu
cators, scientists and decision
makers from all over the country.
On Nov. 4, the chairman of the
foundation will present each re
cipient with a medallion and
$50,000 at a special dinner to be
held at the Plaza Hotel in New
York City.
