## Tarheels roll over Cardinal 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Soccer is a game of momentum
and emotion. Yesterday, No. 1
North Carolina controlled both in
its 5-0 blowout of No. 2 Stanford.
The Cardinal battled evenly
with the Tar Heels throughout the
first half and opened the second
with a scoring opportunity which
seemed to pump up the team. But
North Carolina quickly turned the
momentum around for good with a
brilliant goal on the other end.
UNC's Kristine Lilly booted a
shot across the goal mouth
towards Mia Hamm who, with her
momentum going away from the
goal, leaped and headed the ball
into the top of the net. The score
seemed to deflate the Cardinal,
and the Heels took advantage of
defensive miscues.
"In the first half we showed we
could play with them," said Stan
ford midfielder Julie Foudy. "After
the first goal we lost our compo
sure and started to play man-to
man which we can't do against
them."
The Heels continued to pres
sure the defense and soon extend
ed their lead. Seven minutes after
her first score, Hamm added
another on a penalty kick.
"After the second goal we were
fighting but we weren't calm,"
coach Berhane Andeberhan said.
"We started to get in each other's
way.
"Especially when we got
behind, some of our stars started
to play individual defense. They
wanted the ball and wanted to
make something happen," added
Andeberhan, who singled out
Foudy as one who tried to do too
much.
"Julie can play better than that,"
he said. "She wanted to will us back
into the game and that's a great atti
tude to have, but then you tend to
get predictable. You just want to
drive forward but the defense
knows where you're going."
North Carolina successfully
shut down the Cardinal offense
the rest of the game and used
superior speed to exploit overly
aggressive defense.
Any chance Stanford had to
make a comeback ended midway
through the second half when
Dena Dey got ejected from the
game for using her hands to block

a close-range shot back from the
goal line. Not only did the Tar
Heels score on the ensuing penalty
kick, but the ejection forced the
Cardinal to play one person down
the rest of the game.
After that, Stanford seemed to
succumb to concentration lapses
and frustration. North Carolina
tallied the fourth goal on a 35-yard
shot that goalie Leslie Garrard
mistimed.
Ironically, the shot was proba
bly one of the easier ones she faced.

The Tar Heels swarmed the net
and, despite several one-on-one
diving saves by Garrard, beat
down the Cardinal defense.
"They were really quick moving
upfield," Garrard said. "They basi
cally bypassed midfield and went
right to the forwards.
"It's so frustrating that they got
two goals on penalty kicks," she
added. "The score was not a good
indication of how we can play."
Tar Heel coach Anson Dorrance
agreed the game was closer than

the score showed and credited the
win partly to his defense's ability
to shut down Sarah Rafanelli and
Foudy.
Angela Kelly, a Canadian
national team member, marked
Foudy closely the entire contest.
"Angela had an awesome
game," said Dorrance, who is also
the U.S. women's national team
coach. "In my mind, Julie Foudy is
the premier center midfielder in
the world. For Angela to stay on
her like that was outstanding."
