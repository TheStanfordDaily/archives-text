# Stanford prepares to annihilate Cal
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
The Stanford basketball
season may be over a month
away, but don't be fooled.
Showtime has arrived at
Maples Pavilion.
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team will open a six
game homestand tonight at
7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion
with the Big Match against the
California Golden Bears.
The second-ranked Cardinal
(11-1, 5-1 in Pacific 10 Confer
ence play) boasts an average
home attendance of 3,696 this
year, a figure which places
them No.l in the nation for
average attendance of all
reported schools, and virtually
guarantees Stanford a wall of
noise on every point against
California. Over 5,000 specta
tors attended Stanford's Oct. 3
game against UCLA.
The Cardinal just returned
from Arizona last weekend
with 3-0 sweeps of Arizona and
No. 19 Arizona State. Stanford
head coach Don Shaw, who
netted his 100 th career Pac-10
win against Arizona on Friday,
was happier with his team's
play against the Sun Devils
than he was with their show
ing against the Wildcats.
"In the first game (against
Arizona) we didn't take care of
scoring opportunities like we
should have," said Shaw. "We
really felt better with our exe
cution against Arizona State.
We were passing much better
than the night before, and we
went away pleased with our
selves."
Shaw admitted that Arizona

State's loss to unranked Cali
fornia the night before may
have rattled the confidence of
the No. 19 Sun Devils, but the
Cardinal can expect no such
loss of composure from what
will probably be a fired up
Golden Bear team.
"They're a real hot and cold
team, and we expect the hot,"
Shaw said. "They have players
on that team who haven't beat
en us for three years, so they
can make their whole season
by beating us."
In fact, California has never
beaten Stanford in a women's
collegiate volleyball match.
Not in the history of Pac-10
play between the schools,
which started in 1986. Stan
ford leads the series 12-0 and
looks to add lucky number 13
tomorrow.
Shaw expects the Bears to
be emotional but will strive to
keep the Cardinal executing
well and remaining busi
nesslike.
"We're number two in the
nation ... so we're supposed to
beat every team but UCLA,"
said Shaw. "That means the
other teams can afford to get
emotional. We're the ones that
need to get down to business
and do what we do well."
Shaw is optimistic about his
team's chances tonight and in
the rest of the Pac-10 matches.
"It feels great when we're
clicking on all cylinders," Shaw
said. "When we're performing
the way we should and execut
ing our plays well, we're a
tough team to stop. With a
team like Cal, we just have to
stay organized and not panic,
and we'll handle them."
