Home field advantage. In
any sporting contest, the
team that plays at home
enjoys certain amenities that
give it an edge over the visiting
opposition.
Home teams don't have to
deal with plane rides and luggage
toting. They can spend the night
before the game in their own
beds and their own time zone.
Home teams are familiar with
their stadium and all its nuances
— the wind, the turf, what have
you.
But when we consider home
field advantage, more often than
not only one thing comes to
mind: a throng of enthusiastic
fans who scream their approval
of home team successes and gen
erally make life difficult for the
visitors.
More than a few players abso
lutely feed off the excitement of
a boisterous crowd. With 50,000
die-hards cheering them on,
teams often find themselves lift
ing their games to a new level.
It's unfortunate that, at Stan
ford, such an advantage hardly
exists.
Admittedly, fan bashing on
the Farm is far too easy. When
half the stadium considers the
game a three-hour interruption
of their wine and cheese socializ
ing, foot-stomping excitement in
the stands is difficult to expect.
But at any collegiate stadium,
the noise-making onus is on the
students. And, clearly, Cardinal
fans on the sunny side of the sta
dium could do much more to
help our gridders' cause on home
Saturdays.
No one need be told that this
year's squad is like none we've
had here in two decades. A No. 8
ranking and 5-1 record speak for
themselves.
The fact that Bill Walsh's
arrival has meant serious
national media exposure is just
icing on the cake.
Simply put, Stanford is home
to a powerhouse college football
program (which now rivals Car
dinal success in less publicized
sports). Its rise through the
rankings has strengthened the
case that academic excellence
and athletic prowess are far from
mutually exclusive. News flash:
academic excellence and full
bore enthusiasm for one's foot
ball team can coexist just as eas
ily
Don't tell this to the Cardinal
players. "Students at Stanford
are different," they rationalize.
"They have plenty of other pur
suits to occupy their time. We
don't expect them go crazy over

a football game." How else can
they understand the comatose
student section that looks down
on them as they hustle, fired-up
and fist-pumping, to the side
lines after a big defensive stand?
The Cardinal players have
learned to deal with our lack of
enthusiasm. They feed off
another source of energy on the
field. They shouldn't have to.
No one is advocating painted
faces, cheesy Nobody Beats the
Cardinal signs, and other
"uncool" tokens of support. Just
giving Arizona's offense hell
when they get to the south end
of the field would be a good start.
Of course, it would help if the
yell leaders actually did just that

— lead yells. But a pack of intel
lectuals can only utter "hold that
line" so many times. And
strangely, most fans don't know
how to vocally respond to
cartwheels and back flips. Flag
boy has potential, but maybe yell
leaders aren't the answer.
The scores of Stanford faith
ful that traveled to Pasadena
are. The Cardinal end zone sec
tion made more noise Saturday
than a stadium full of red-clad
supporters did three weeks
back.
They could do wonders to help
rev up a Stanford squad that
comes out unexpectedly flat.
It probably sounds sillv to
plead for people to make more
noise, but on the field the deci
bels matter.
This Saturday's game is one
to get excited about. The Cardi
nal is returning from two enor
mous road wins.
They haven't been rankedgin
the top 10 in 21 years. Arizona is
the last real hurdle before a
showdown for the Roses in Seat
tle. The Wildcats thumped
UCLA 23-3 and came within a
point of beating No. 2 Miami.
The Cardinal will no doubt be
geared up to extend their five
game winning streak. But a little
support from the wooden bleach
ers this time around would fall
on welcome ears.

Kevin Jeffery still believes the
Blue Jays know how to choke.

exists.
Admittedly, fan bashing on
the Farm is far too easy. When
half the stadium considers the
game a three-hour interruption
of their wine and cheese socializ
ing, foot-stomping excitement in
the stands is difficult to expect.
But at any collegiate stadium,
the noise-making onus is on the
students. And, clearly, Cardinal
fans on the sunny side of the sta
dium could do much more to
help our gridders' cause on home
Saturdays.
No one need be told that this
year's squad is like none we've
had here in two decades. A No. 8
ranking and 5-1 record speak for
themselves.
The fact that Bill Walsh's
arrival has meant serious
national media exposure is just
icing on the cake.
Simply put, Stanford is home
to a powerhouse college football
program (which now rivals Car
dinal success in less publicized
sports). Its rise through the
rankings has strengthened the
case that academic excellence
and athletic prowess are far from
mutually exclusive. News flash:
academic excellence and full
bore enthusiasm for one's foot
ball team can coexist just as eas
ily
Don't tell this to the Cardinal
players. "Students at Stanford
are different," they rationalize.
"They have plenty of other pur
suits to occupy their time. We
don't expect them go crazy over

a football game." How else can
they understand the comatose
student section that looks down
on them as they hustle, fired-up
and fist-pumping, to the side
lines after a big defensive stand?
The Cardinal players have
learned to deal with our lack of
enthusiasm. They feed off
another source of energy on the
field. They shouldn't have to.
No one is advocating painted
faces, cheesy Nobody Beats the
Cardinal signs, and other
"uncool" tokens of support. Just
giving Arizona's offense hell
when they get to the south end
of the field would be a good start.
Of course, it would help if the
yell leaders actually did just that

— lead yells. But a pack of intel
lectuals can only utter "hold that
line" so many times. And
strangely, most fans don't know
how to vocally respond to
cartwheels and back flips. Flag
boy has potential, but maybe yell
leaders aren't the answer.
The scores of Stanford faith
ful that traveled to Pasadena
are. The Cardinal end zone sec
tion made more noise Saturday
than a stadium full of red-clad
supporters did three weeks
back.
They could do wonders to help
rev up a Stanford squad that
comes out unexpectedly flat.
It probably sounds sillv to
plead for people to make more
noise, but on the field the deci
bels matter.
This Saturday's game is one
to get excited about. The Cardi
nal is returning from two enor
mous road wins.
They haven't been rankedgin
the top 10 in 21 years. Arizona is
the last real hurdle before a
showdown for the Roses in Seat
tle. The Wildcats thumped
UCLA 23-3 and came within a
point of beating No. 2 Miami.
The Cardinal will no doubt be
geared up to extend their five
game winning streak. But a little
support from the wooden bleach
ers this time around would fall
on welcome ears.

Kevin Jeffery still believes the
Blue Jays know how to choke.
