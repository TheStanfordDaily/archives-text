After the first round of play at the Wash
ington Intercollegiate yesterday, the Stanford
women's golf team found itself in fourth place
overall after shooting a 318 at the Sahalee
Country Club in Seattle.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal was led by fifth
year senior Martha Richards, junior Melinda
Daniels and sophomore Jamille Jose, all of
whom tied for eighth place with a first round
score of 77. Freshman Vicki Strada tied for
53rd with 87.

Sophomore Amy Lawrence, who finished
13th at last year's NCAA championships, had
a lackluster performance, shooting a 91 to tie
her for 67th place.
Defending NCAA champion (and pre-sea
son No. 1 ranked) San Jose State leads the
tournament after shooting a 304. Tracy Han
son and Vibeke Stensrud of the Spartans con
tributed to their team's lead by each shooting
a 72, which ties them for first place in the indi
vidual race, along with Marie Deeblens of
Oklahoma. Oklahoma and Arizona are tied for
second, each team recording a 307.

The first round was "a little on the disap
pointing side," said coach Tim Baldwin.
One explanation for the slow start, he said,
may be that the Cardinal is still working out
bugs that other squads have conquered.
"Most of the other schools competing have
played in at least one other tournament,"
Baldwin offers, "most of them two."
Baldwin is unfazed, however, and looks for
improvement in the remaining rounds, which
will be played today and Wednesday.
Last year, Stanford tied for second place
out of 15 teams in this competition.
