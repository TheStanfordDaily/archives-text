# Computer simplifies book hunt
## 
### Akin Salawu 
The days of wandering through
bookstores searching for the per
fect book may be over, thanks to
the high-tech creation of a Stan
ford graduate.
Tina Seelig has designed an
easy-to-use computer program
called "Bookßrowser," and the ini
tial response from users in the
Stanford Bookstore suggests it
could be what many weary book
shoppers have been looking for.
As an author of a book about
the chemistry of cooking, Seelig
discovered that people interested
in cooking could find her book in
bookstores, but people interested
in chemistry never saw it because
it was only located in the cooking
section.
The solution, she realized, was
to create a way for people to find
the book they want without having
to wander through the entire
bookstore and look at every title.
To draw people's attention,
Bookßrowser uses a color touch
screen, making it attractive even
for those who are unfamiliar with
computers.
"People play with it," said a
Stanford Bookstore employee. "It's
good if you don't know what you
want. "But if you're looking for a
specific book it's not where you
want to go," the employee said.

When customers begin to use
the Bookßrowser, they are asked
to choose between books for adults
or children.
The computer then asks whether
the user wants fiction or non-fic
tion. Bookßrowser displays a list of
categories, including such things as
mystery, poetry and literature.
The user is then asked to choose
among subcategories depending
upon the category that was chosen.
For example, within literature,
users can choose among subcate

gories such as American, African-
American or Chinese literature.
After the user chooses a subcat
egoiy, the Bookßrowser suggests a
list of possible books and can tell
the reader who the author and
publisher are as well as provide a
brief synopsis and other miscella
neous information.
The most apparent drawback of
the system to some readers is the
limited selection of books.
"How come there's only two
books under African-American

Literature?" asked Sophomore
Naledi Khabo.
"We just launched the system,"
Seelig said. "I don't want people to
be frustrated if they don't find a lot
of book selections because publish
ers are constantly adding to it and
consequently it grows weekly."
Eighteen publishers are now
participating in the program.
Despite its infancy, it seems to be
attracting attention. "It seems to be
very fun, and a lot of people like to
use it," said a bookstore employee.
