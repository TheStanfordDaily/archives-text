# What it takes to win
## Motivation key, say Stanford athletes, coaches

Does practice makes perfect?
If so, practicing for many
hours, every day, over many
months in any given sport should
ensure victory in all competitions.
How then could the Los Ange
les Raiders, touted as the win
ningest team in professional
sports, begin the 1992 season a
dismal 1-4? Some might say age,
others lack of talent, but many
would site a lack of motivation.
"Motivation is an ongoing,
continuing process," explained
Bill Walsh, head football coach.
"You use motivation to show
them (the athletes) what it takes
to win. If you're motivated, you'll
work harder and practice harder.
It's the core of preparing for a
game."
"Motivation is part of being a
teacher," said Colin Lindores,
men's soccer coach. "You have to
make [the players] feel like an
important part of the team and
make them aware of their role on
the team."
The team concept — often con
sidered to be a key factor in moti
vation — exists even in sports
where the "team" itself is much
less defined than in soccer.
"In cross country, a team is
only as strong as its fifth person,"
said Dan Lanana, director of the
Cardinal's track program. In
most intercollegiate cross coun
try meets, the finishes of the top
five runners from each school
count toward the team's overall
score.
"The team concept is much
more important in cross country,
where success or failure is decided
by the entire team (than in track
and field)."
However, this team concept
does not motivate all runners.
"I think you have to start by
motivating yourself," said Ann
Sonka, women's cross country
team member. "It's important to
have team unity, but you need to
start with individual motivation.
If the [individual] is not motivat
ed it's not going to work."
In sports such as track and
field, where the notion of "team"
is much harder to define than in
cross country, motivation on a
personal level becomes even more
important.

"To motivate individuals in
track is very objective," said
Lanana. "When individuals lower
times or throw farther, the indi
vidual benefits and the entire
team benefits, which in turn
motivates the individual. It's very
much a cycle."
Team members generally
agreed with Lanana.
"Definitely, the team concept
is important, but there are differ
ent focuses by each individual in
different events," said Jenni Dal
ton, women's track team mem
ber. "Somewhere inside yourself
you must find motivation."
Many assume that motivation
relates only to the emotional "pep
talk" in the locker room just
before a competition, but, as
Walsh explained, "inspiration is a
small part of motivation" used by
Stanford coaches.
"Emotional speeches are done
for the entire team," said Lanana.
"But you can't fire all your bullets
early in the season because
there'll be no bullets left in the
gun. The focus on the individual
is important to make them aware
of their strengths and shortcom
ings."
Often, attitude and desire —
the intangible products of motiva
tion — help an athlete and a team
overcome obstacles in competi
tion.
The Cardinal football team
proved this true with a stunning
come-from-behind victory over a
heavily favored Notre Dame team
on the road. Stanford outside
linebacker Ron George illustrated
this point in a recent Associated
Press article.
"If you look at their roster and
our roster, we're outgunned,"
said George. "They have more tal
ent. They have better size. Where
we weren't outmanned was our
attitude, our aggression and our
desire to win."
Many Cardinal coaches agreed
that inspiration and motivation
are just as important, if not more
important, than drilling and prac
tice to prepare for a competition.
In the long run, conditioning
an athlete to do his or her best
more often than not leads to suc
cess.
Just ask any of last year's
Stanford NCAA or Olympic
champions.

you must find motivation."
Many assume that motivation
relates only to the emotional "pep
talk" in the locker room just
before a competition, but, as
Walsh explained, "inspiration is a
small part of motivation" used by
Stanford coaches.
"Emotional speeches are done
for the entire team," said Lanana.
"But you can't fire all your bullets
early in the season because
there'll be no bullets left in the
gun. The focus on the individual
is important to make them aware
of their strengths and shortcom
ings."
Often, attitude and desire —
the intangible products of motiva
tion — help an athlete and a team
overcome obstacles in competi
tion.
The Cardinal football team
proved this true with a stunning
come-from-behind victory over a
heavily favored Notre Dame team
on the road. Stanford outside
linebacker Ron George illustrated
this point in a recent Associated
Press article.
"If you look at their roster and
our roster, we're outgunned,"
said George. "They have more tal
ent. They have better size. Where
we weren't outmanned was our
attitude, our aggression and our
desire to win."
Many Cardinal coaches agreed
that inspiration and motivation
are just as important, if not more
important, than drilling and prac
tice to prepare for a competition.
In the long run, conditioning
an athlete to do his or her best
more often than not leads to suc
cess.
Just ask any of last year's
Stanford NCAA or Olympic
champions.
