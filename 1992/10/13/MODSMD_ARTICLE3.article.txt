# Transition upsets residents
## Now a self-op, 558 left with shoddy equipment, extra costs 
### Neerad Lai 
Residents of 558 Mayfield are upset because the
house's transition from University-operated to self
operated may prove to be more expensive than antic
ipated.
Because of the change in the house's status, Hous
ing and Food Service removed most of the kitchen
supplies during the summer. As a result, the resi
dents had to buy new equipment totalling about
$4,000. What the University had left, residents say,
was in bad shape.
"Our new fridge was replaced with an older one of
only two-thirds the capacity. The oven was poorly cali
brated and had to be fixed. The ice machine had been
impounded. We had to make do with a hazardous meat
slicer," said Jon Previtali, this year's house manager.
Housing and Food Service Director Keith Guy yes
terday said the University should have provided
more equipment. "We will cover the costs of things
they had to pick up that are reasonable and were
needed by the house.
"We made a mistake and got ahead of ourselves.
Food service staff. . . took out the equipment before
we were able to replace everything, like pots and
pans. It is our responsibility and obligation to provide
the kitchen with the basic utensils and equipment
needed to manage," Guy said.
Reacting to Guy's statement, residents were opti
mistic but still skeptical about how much the Univer
sity will ultimately reimburse them.
"That's good news for us," said Previtali. "It is
very surprising, but not very specific."
In addition, residents want to spread the cost of
any kitchen equipment they have to buy over several
years. To do so, they hope to get a loan from the ASSU
and pay it back in the future.
But the Office of Residential Education has
blocked this effort, refusing to allow a loan for longer
than a year.
"There is no way we will indebt future genera
tions" by carrying costs from this year to next, said
Row Director Diana Conklin. "Our rule of thumb is
that we end students in the black, and we've been
doing so for 20 years now."
Residents said this policy is unfair. "Many of the
appliances and supplies will last more than four

years," said Jeremy Nelson, house social manager.
"Why should [the residents of this year] have to pay
for everything? It's semantic bureaucracy."
"We could sell off the appliances and split the pro
ceeds to make up [for our losses], but we think that's
unethical. We don't want to put next year's group
through the same trauma," said Louie Kim, the resi
dent assistant.

'For $36,000, we could
re-equip the entire kitchen
every year.'

Representatives of the house have talked to Res
Ed and Food Service officials several times but have
not resolved the issue. "It's not like we're condemn
ing the [administration!. In fact, the Row Office and
facilities supervisor have been supportive of us," said
Previtali. "We just want to settle this [fairly]."
Guy said, "I hope those students get connected
with us soon so we can get it all worked out."
The move to a self-op has also resulted in an in
crease in room rent. This year, rates have been in
creased by about $200 per quarter, which is supposed
to cover kitchen maintenance costs, said Guy. In all,
the 58 residents of the house will pay close to $36,000
for the year. For students in University-operated
houses, this expense is included in meal plans.
Many students said this increase is exorbitant.
"For $36,000, we could re-equip the entire kitchen
every year," said Kim.
Residents of 558 Mayfield last year decided to con
vert to a self-op after Housing and Food Service
stopped paying for cooks in several Row houses and
instead brought food from Wilbur Hall.
"Students couldn't eat the reheated food. We
would be lucky if even half of the students showed up
for dinner," said Kim, who lived in the house last year.
Even a part-time cook, hired after house residents
pressured Food Service, ended up reheating food,
students said.

creased by about $200 per quarter, which is supposed
to cover kitchen maintenance costs, said Guy. In all,
the 58 residents of the house will pay close to $36,000
for the year. For students in University-operated
houses, this expense is included in meal plans.
Many students said this increase is exorbitant.
"For $36,000, we could re-equip the entire kitchen
every year," said Kim.
Residents of 558 Mayfield last year decided to con
vert to a self-op after Housing and Food Service
stopped paying for cooks in several Row houses and
instead brought food from Wilbur Hall.
"Students couldn't eat the reheated food. We
would be lucky if even half of the students showed up
for dinner," said Kim, who lived in the house last year.
Even a part-time cook, hired after house residents
pressured Food Service, ended up reheating food,
students said.
