# SU Press to expand services
## Merger with Cambridge counterpart would enlarge distribution 
### Carly Berwick 
Stanford University Press may
form a new collaboration with its
counterpart at Cambridge Univer
sity that could give it more exper
tise in the natural sciences and ex
pand its overseas distribution.
Norris Pope, acting director of
the press, said in a statement that
the new program would be a
"splendid opportunity."
Under the proposed agreement,
the press would host two editors
from the Cambridge press who
would be responsible for finding
new manuscripts.
Most likely, these editors would
work in the natural sciences field,
bolstering an area where the Stan
ford press is weak, Pope said.
In addition, the collaboration
will lead to a joint Stanford-Cam
bridge series. While co-publishing
efforts are not rare, the publishing
of one press's books with the in
house assistance of another's edi
tors is unprecedented, Pope said.
The Cambridge press would also
help the Stanford press sell its
books overseas. The agreement will
probably be finalized in November,
Pope said.
These changes could help allevi
ate problems seen by some Stan
ford press authors.

Anthropology and Human Biol
ogy Prof. William Durham, who
has written several books pub
lished by the Stanford press, cited
the only failings of the press as a
need to strengthen the commit
ment to natural history books and
poor international distribution.
The current size of Stanford
press, however, limits its distribu
tion capabilities.
University presses are divided
by industry standards into tiers
based on their revenues.
The first tier consists of presses
such as Cambridge, University of
Chicago and Harvard, which gener
ate more than $5 million per year in
sales. With around $3 million in an
nual sales, Stanford's press is in
the next tier.
But some authors feel that its
small size does have advantages.
Durham and English Prof. Jay
Fleigelman said they feel the press
provides books of as high quality as
any other university press.
Fleigelman, who is in the process
of publishing his first book with the
Stanford press, said the level and
quality of attention from its editors
was better than with his previous
publisher, the Cambridge press.
The Stanford press "used to be
smaller and more provincial, but
over the last five or six years, its

profile has increased dramatical
ly," Fleigelman said.
The small scale of the press al
lows it to stand out in certain areas
such as Latin American history,
Asian studies and literary theory,
while giving high priority to devel
opment of the work as opposed to
mere production, Durham said.
"My feeling is that Stanford
press tries to do an excellent job at
what it does, but avoids doing
everything," Durham said.
The new plan for collaborating
with Cambridge comes after the
Stanford press was threatened last
year with being cut altogether from
the University budget.
On average, second-tier presses
receive about 8.9 percent of their fi
nancial support from their univer
sities. Such a cut would have se
verely damaged Stanford press's
production and prestige, Pope said.
Although some cuts were ulti
mately made, they were simply part
of the "tough decisions" the Univer
sity has been facing, Pope said. The
press is no longer in danger of losing
the status it has recently gained.
"Under the new climate of fi
nancial stringency, working on
our finances is a high priority, but
there's no point in having a press
if it isn't distinguished," Pope
commented.
