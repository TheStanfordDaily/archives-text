James Stockdale stumbled
his way through a nationally
televised vice-presidential de
bate last night, often appearing
befuddled but managing to slip
in some of the sharpest jabs of
the night.

Stockdale, a Hoover Institu
tion scholar, emphasized the
anti-Washington message of
his running mate, independent
candidate Ross Perot, while
avoiding the details of the poli
cy positions Perot has taken.

Independent vice-presidential candidate and Hoover Fellow James Stockdale pauses before making
a point during last night's debate.
largely stayed in the background.
But he entered the fray several
times to deliver, in plain talk, his
simple analysis of why the United
States is "in deep trouble."
After listening to an extended
exchange of accusations and fin
ger-pointing between Quayle and
Gore, Stockdale said: "I think
America is seeing right now the
reason this nation is in gridlock."
Stockdale also provided some
of the debate's most humorous
moments, at one time asking that
a question be repeated because he
had turned his hearing aid off,
and at another point giving up his
allotted speaking time with the
frank admission, "I'm out of
ammunition on this one."
His faltering performance
drew polite reviews from Stan
ford observers, who were divided
on whether his appearance will
help or hurt the Perot campaign
but who agreed that Stockdale
succeeded in demonstrating his
integrity and decency.
"Everybody was sort of
pulling for him," said Communi
cation Prof. Steven Chaffee. "He
was honest, he was blunt, but he

is obviously not experienced
either at politics or at that kind
of television. He wasn't talking
about a lot of the issues at the
level (his opponents) were debat
ing him."
The debate "showed Stockdale
to be a decent person who is a lit
tle out of touch with what's going
on in this country," said Political
Science Prof. Richard Brody. "I
think he came in first (for) con
vincing some undecided voters to
(move to) Perot's camp."
On a few occasions, Stockdale
delivered opinions on the policy
issues Quayle and Gore were
hammering away at. He said
Perot's plan for defense cuts is
nearer to Bush's than Clinton's,
expressed support for school
choice and, on abortion, said
forcefully: "A woman owns her
body and what she does with it is
her own business, period."
And while Perot himself has
been perceived to be helping the
Clinton ticket by criticizing Bush's
economic strategy, Stockdale gave
a boost to Bush by blasting Gore's
book on the environment.
"I don't see how (Gore) can
possibly pay for his proposals in
today's economic climate,"
Stockdale said. "I love this plan
et, and I want it to stay here, but
I don't like to have it the private

property of fanatics who want to
overdo this thing."
But for the most part, Stock
dale distanced himself from the
sharp clash between Gore and
Quayle, presenting himself as an
outsider who has spent only one
year of his military career in
Washington.
"Who am I? Why am I here?"
he said in his opening statement,
garnering laughter and applause
from the Atlanta audience. "I'm
not a politician, everybody knows
that, so don't expect me to use
the language of the Washington
insider."
He soon proved himself cor
rect, as he lost his train of
thought, fumbled with his glass
es and went silent for several sec
onds before recovering his place
in some written notes. For much
of the debate, his delivery ram
bled.
"You hate to say that Stock
dale, this wonderful guy, could
have hurt the ticket," Chaffee
observed last night. "But if you
think about if Ross Perot gets
elected and Stockdale is the vice
president, how would this person
be as president? I'm not sure
that he didn't hurt."
But Martin Anderson, a col
league of Stockdale's at Hoover,
said Stockdale displayed "com

mon sense" and "really came
across as a citizen-politician."
"Stockdale was not polished
and slick. He was sincere,"
Anderson said. "If you ask peo
ple, 'Who would you like to go
out tonight and have dinner
with?' I think they would say
Stockdale."
Indeed, Stockdale came across
as an everyday person with
whom many Americans likely
could identify.
At one point in the 90-minute
debate, after a contentious
exchange between Gore and
Quayle, Stockdale fumed, "I feel
like I'm an observer at a ping
pong game. . . . They're expert,
professional politicians who mas
sage these intricate plots and
know every nuance to them, and
meantime we're facing a desper
ate situation in our economy."
Stockdale, a former prisoner
of war who was awarded the Con
gressional Medal of Honor,
signed on to the Perot ticket as a
favor to Perot, who worked on
behalf of POW families during
the Vietnam War. He has served
as president of the Naval War
College and The Citadel military
college and came to Hoover in
1981. He holds a master's degree
in international relations from
Stanford.

be as president? I'm not sure
that he didn't hurt."
But Martin Anderson, a col
league of Stockdale's at Hoover,
said Stockdale displayed "com

mon sense" and "really came
across as a citizen-politician."
"Stockdale was not polished
and slick. He was sincere,"
Anderson said. "If you ask peo
ple, 'Who would you like to go
out tonight and have dinner
with?' I think they would say
Stockdale."
Indeed, Stockdale came across
as an everyday person with
whom many Americans likely
could identify.
At one point in the 90-minute
debate, after a contentious
exchange between Gore and
Quayle, Stockdale fumed, "I feel
like I'm an observer at a ping
pong game. . . . They're expert,
professional politicians who mas
sage these intricate plots and
know every nuance to them, and
meantime we're facing a desper
ate situation in our economy."
Stockdale, a former prisoner
of war who was awarded the Con
gressional Medal of Honor,
signed on to the Perot ticket as a
favor to Perot, who worked on
behalf of POW families during
the Vietnam War. He has served
as president of the Naval War
College and The Citadel military
college and came to Hoover in
1981. He holds a master's degree
in international relations from
Stanford.
James Stockdale stumbled
his way through a nationally
televised vice-presidential de

befuddled but managing to slip
in some of the sharpest jabs of
the night.

Stockdale, a Hoover Institu
tion scholar, emphasized the
anti-Washington message of
his running mate, independent
candidate Ross Perot, while
avoiding the details of the poli
cy positions Perot has taken.

a point during last night's debate.
largely stayed in the background.
But he entered the fray several
times to deliver, in plain talk, his
simple analysis of why the United
States is "in deep trouble."
After listening to an extended
exchange of accusations and fin
ger-pointing between Quayle and
Gore, Stockdale said: "I think
America is seeing right now the
reason this nation is in gridlock."
Stockdale also provided some
of the debate's most humorous
moments, at one time asking that
a question be repeated because he
had turned his hearing aid off,
and at another point giving up his
allotted speaking time with the
frank admission, "I'm out of
ammunition on this one."
His faltering performance
drew polite reviews from Stan
ford observers, who were divided
on whether his appearance will
help or hurt the Perot campaign
but who agreed that Stockdale
succeeded in demonstrating his
integrity and decency.
"Everybody was sort of
pulling for him," said Communi
cation Prof. Steven Chaffee. "He
was honest, he was blunt, but he

is obviously not experienced
either at politics or at that kind
of television. He wasn't talking
about a lot of the issues at the
level (his opponents) were debat
ing him."
The debate "showed Stockdale
to be a decent person who is a lit
tle out of touch with what's going
on in this country," said Political
Science Prof. Richard Brody. "I
think he came in first (for) con
vincing some undecided voters to
(move to) Perot's camp."
On a few occasions, Stockdale
delivered opinions on the policy
issues Quayle and Gore were
hammering away at. He said
Perot's plan for defense cuts is
nearer to Bush's than Clinton's,
expressed support for school
choice and, on abortion, said
forcefully: "A woman owns her
body and what she does with it is
her own business, period."
And while Perot himself has
been perceived to be helping the
Clinton ticket by criticizing Bush's
economic strategy, Stockdale gave
a boost to Bush by blasting Gore's
book on the environment.
"I don't see how (Gore) can
possibly pay for his proposals in
today's economic climate,"
Stockdale said. "I love this plan
et, and I want it to stay here, but
I don't like to have it the private

property of fanatics who want to
overdo this thing."
But for the most part, Stock
dale distanced himself from the
sharp clash between Gore and
Quayle, presenting himself as an
outsider who has spent only one
year of his military career in
Washington.
"Who am I? Why am I here?"
he said in his opening statement,
garnering laughter and applause
from the Atlanta audience. "I'm
not a politician, everybody knows
that, so don't expect me to use
the language of the Washington
insider."
He soon proved himself cor
rect, as he lost his train of
thought, fumbled with his glass
es and went silent for several sec
onds before recovering his place
in some written notes. For much
of the debate, his delivery ram
bled.
"You hate to say that Stock
dale, this wonderful guy, could
have hurt the ticket," Chaffee
observed last night. "But if you
think about if Ross Perot gets
elected and Stockdale is the vice
president, how would this person
be as president? I'm not sure
that he didn't hurt."
