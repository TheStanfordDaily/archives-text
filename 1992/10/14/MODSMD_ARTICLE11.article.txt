Public college costs skyrocketing
BOSTON (AP) — The cost of attending public colleges and
universities has increased at a double-digit rate for the second
straight year, far ahead of state and federal financial aid, the Col
lege Board reported yesterday.
The cost of higher education ranges from $321 a year at the
public, two-year College of the Mainland in Texas City, Texas, to
$24,380 at private Sarah College in Bronxville, N.Y.
Average tuition and fees at four-year public universities and
colleges rose 10 percent to $2,315 this fall, the College Board
reported. Room and board brings the total to $5,841.
"A lot of students have been driven from public colleges and
universities and, increasingly, people are also having trouble
affording community colleges at this point," said Stacey Leyton,
president of the U.S. Student Association.
Moscow denies selling nukes
ALMA-ATA, Kazakhstan (AP) — Kazakhstan and the common
wealth military headquarters in Moscow denied yesterday that Iran
bought four nuclear warheads from this former Soviet republic.
A leader of an Iranian opposition group charged Monday that
Tehran had paid for the warheads but that they had not yet been
delivered from Kazakhstan.
Seitkazy Matayev, press secretary to Kazakhstan President
Nursultan Nazarbayev, said there was no such deal. "This is not
the first time such reports have appeared in foreign newspapers,"
he said. "We are sick and tired of such reports."
In Moscow, Valery Myasnikov, a spokesman for the Common
wealth of Independent States' main military command, also dis
missed the charge.
Kazakhstan shares the nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet
Union with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Under an accord signed
by all four nations and the United States, the weapons must even
tually be turned over to Russia.
Matayev noted Kazakhstan signed the Nuclear Non-Prolifera
tion Treaty in May. "We are obliged not to sell warheads or tech
nology in accordance with this treaty," he said.
Trade makes U.S. workers productive
BALTIMORE (AP) — U.S. workers are more productive than
their German or Japanese counterparts, largely because of Amer
ica's highly competitive and open trade environment, the authors
of a new study said yesterday.
U.S. workers are 11 percent more productive than West Ger
man workers and 23 percent more productive than Japanese
workers, said William Lewis, director of the McKinsey Global
Institute, which sponsored the study of five big industrial nations.
East Germany was not included in the figures because data was
collected before the reunification of Germany in October 1990.
Free trade may be the motivation. "There's more competition
for U.S. companies," said Martin Baily, an economics professor at
the University of Maryland and a coauthor of the study. "Man
agers are forced to raise productivity in order to survive and be
profitable."
