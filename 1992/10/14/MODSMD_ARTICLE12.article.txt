# Vice-presidential candidates clash
## Format turns debate into free-for-all; Stockdale left out as other two attack 
### 
(AP) — Last night was the
night of the hard sell, as Vice
President Dan Quayle and Sena
tor A 1 Gore pitched their tickets
with tough lines and wisecracks
in a feisty vice presidential
debate. Independent nominee
James Stockdale was the odd man
out.
In the only scheduled vice pres
idential debate, the running mates
were more caustic and confronta
tional than the men at the top of
their tickets. President Bush,
Democratic nominee Bill Clinton
and independent Ross Perot will
meet tomorrow night in their sec
ond debate and again next Monday
in the finale.
Quayle and Gore clashed over
everything from nuclear weapons
pacts to giving tax breaks to U.S.
firms that move overseas. And
they called one another's veracity
into question in several instances.
Stockdale was literally the man
in the middle, at the lectern
between the major party nomi
nees, and said he felt like an
observer at a ping-pong game.
"Who am I? Why am I here?"
the retired admiral, Vietnam war
prisoner and hero, asked as he
introduced himself at the outset.
The question seemed as apt at
the end as at the outset. Stockdale
appeared ill at ease in his unaccus
tomed political role, twisting a pen
in his hands, sometimes stumbling
in his comments.
In contrast, Quayle and Gore
were pumped for the occasion.
Quayle was smiling and seemed to
be enjoying himself. Gore was cool,
poised and faintly scornful of the
vice president. The two major
party candidates attacked each
other at every opportunity.
"You know what you're
doing?" Quayle demanded of the
Democrat, accusing Gore of mis
representing his own record.
"You're pulling a Bill Clinton on

me!" All told, Quayle accused Gore
of pulling three Bill Clintons.
"Let me talk now! It's going to
be a long evening if you go on like
this," Gore said a bit more than an
hour into the exchange.
During a lull in the arguing,
moderator Hal Bruno warily sur
veyed the three vice presidential
candidates in the debate, which
was held at the Georgia Tech The
atre in Atlanta, Ga.
"I was a little bit worried that
there might not be a free-flowing
discussion tonight," said Bruno,
ABC's director of political cover
age, eliciting laughter from the
audience.
Observers speculated the sin
gle-moderator format was what
let the candidates question each
other. The debate was the first in
the format the Presidential Com
mission on Debates, which spon
sored the joust, had wanted all
along: A single moderator asks a
question, each candidate gets 75
seconds to respond, followed by
five minutes of open debate.
Quayle took advantage of the
open forum to focus on trust as an
issue, picking up a Bush theme in
sharper words than the president
employs himself.
And when he got the last word,
he said Gore hadn't rebutted him.
"Do you really believe that Bill
Clinton will tell the truth?" he
asked. "And do you trust Bill Clin
ton to be your president?"
Gore was just as dogged on the
Democratic attack line, change,
jobs and the economic slump. He
said Republican economic policy
has had a 12-year try and is a
proven failure.
Gore also challenged President
Bush's assertion in Sunday night's
presidential debate that the threat
of Russia's multiple warhead SS
-18 intercontinental missiles had
been eliminated.
Gore said the United States and

Russia have not signed a treaty to
eliminate what are considered the
most dangerous ocean-spanning
nuclear weapons in the world.
"The president does have a
commitment from Boris Yeltsin to
eliminate the SS-18s," Quayle
said. But there is no formal agree
ment on that score.
When the 90-minute debate
was over, the Republicans said
Quayle had accomplished his
debate mission, the Democrats
said Gore had won and that the
vice president had been too stri
dent. Both sides agreed the Stock
dale showing would likely be a
problem for Perot.
At one point, Stockdale seemed

to differ with his own presidential
candidate. Perot has said the cam
paign should be about issues, not
personal questions; Stockdale was
more interested in character.
"I think there is a case to be
made for putting emphasis on
character over these issues that
we've been batting back and forth
and have a life of their own," he
said.
There were no major fumbles
by the major-party nominees, and
each had grounds for his claim to
success. Several analysts said
Quayle certainly showed himself a
changed man by comparison with
his faltering debate performance
in 1988.

be a long evening if you go on like
this," Gore said a bit more than an
hour into the exchange.
During a lull in the arguing,
moderator Hal Bruno warily sur
veyed the three vice presidential
candidates in the debate, which
was held at the Georgia Tech The
atre in Atlanta, Ga.
"I was a little bit worried that
there might not be a free-flowing
discussion tonight," said Bruno,
ABC's director of political cover
age, eliciting laughter from the
audience.
Observers speculated the sin
gle-moderator format was what
let the candidates question each
other. The debate was the first in
the format the Presidential Com
mission on Debates, which spon
sored the joust, had wanted all
along: A single moderator asks a
question, each candidate gets 75
seconds to respond, followed by
five minutes of open debate.
Quayle took advantage of the
open forum to focus on trust as an
issue, picking up a Bush theme in
sharper words than the president
employs himself.
And when he got the last word,
he said Gore hadn't rebutted him.
"Do you really believe that Bill
Clinton will tell the truth?" he
asked. "And do you trust Bill Clin
ton to be your president?"
Gore was just as dogged on the
Democratic attack line, change,
jobs and the economic slump. He
said Republican economic policy
has had a 12-year try and is a
proven failure.
Gore also challenged President
Bush's assertion in Sunday night's
presidential debate that the threat
of Russia's multiple warhead SS
-18 intercontinental missiles had
been eliminated.
Gore said the United States and

Russia have not signed a treaty to
eliminate what are considered the
most dangerous ocean-spanning
nuclear weapons in the world.
"The president does have a
commitment from Boris Yeltsin to
eliminate the SS-18s," Quayle
said. But there is no formal agree
ment on that score.
When the 90-minute debate
was over, the Republicans said
Quayle had accomplished his
debate mission, the Democrats
said Gore had won and that the
vice president had been too stri
dent. Both sides agreed the Stock
dale showing would likely be a
problem for Perot.
At one point, Stockdale seemed

to differ with his own presidential
candidate. Perot has said the cam
paign should be about issues, not
personal questions; Stockdale was
more interested in character.
"I think there is a case to be
made for putting emphasis on
character over these issues that
we've been batting back and forth
and have a life of their own," he
said.
There were no major fumbles
by the major-party nominees, and
each had grounds for his claim to
success. Several analysts said
Quayle certainly showed himself a
changed man by comparison with
his faltering debate performance
in 1988.

(AP) — Last night was the
night of the hard sell, as Vice
President Dan Quayle and Sena
tor A 1 Gore pitched their tickets
with tough lines and wisecracks
in a feisty vice presidential
debate. Independent nominee
James Stockdale was the odd man
out.
In the only scheduled vice pres
idential debate, the running mates
were more caustic and confronta
tional than the men at the top of
their tickets. President Bush,
Democratic nominee Bill Clinton
and independent Ross Perot will
meet tomorrow night in their sec
ond debate and again next Monday
in the finale.
Quayle and Gore clashed over
everything from nuclear weapons
pacts to giving tax breaks to U.S.
firms that move overseas. And
they called one another's veracity
into question in several instances.
Stockdale was literally the man
in the middle, at the lectern
between the major party nomi
nees, and said he felt like an
observer at a ping-pong game.
"Who am I? Why am I here?"
the retired admiral, Vietnam war
prisoner and hero, asked as he
introduced himself at the outset.
The question seemed as apt at
the end as at the outset. Stockdale
appeared ill at ease in his unaccus
tomed political role, twisting a pen
in his hands, sometimes stumbling
in his comments.
In contrast, Quayle and Gore
were pumped for the occasion.
Quayle was smiling and seemed to
be enjoying himself. Gore was cool,
poised and faintly scornful of the
vice president. The two major
party candidates attacked each
other at every opportunity.
"You know what you're
doing?" Quayle demanded of the
Democrat, accusing Gore of mis
representing his own record.
"You're pulling a Bill Clinton on

me!" All told, Quayle accused Gore
of pulling three Bill Clintons.
"Let me talk now! It's going to
be a long evening if you go on like
this," Gore said a bit more than an
hour into the exchange.
