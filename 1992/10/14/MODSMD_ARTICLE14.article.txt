## Student grade privacy 
### 
Grade examination
by RFs conflicts with
proper privacy policy

UNBEKNOWNST TO A
good number of Stanford
students, at the end of each
academic quarter a copy of their
grades is sent to their resident fel
low, along with the grades of every
one else in their residence.
This University policy of giving
grade reports to RFs is a disheart
ening example of administration
hypocrisy, and it is one that should
be terminated immediately.
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son has said it is the University's
belief that "students should be
treated as adults" in matters of pri
vacy and when determining
whether or not to release informa
tion on a student's academic record.
The paternalistic action of send
ing grades to RFs, though, con
flicts dramatically with the Uni
versity's stated commitment to
treating students as adults. Jack
son's encouraging words are ren
dered meaningless and even suspi
cious when one learns of such Uni
versity practices.
As young adults, students cer
tainly don't need — and many do
not want — their RFs to be
informed of their grades.
If the University is truly to treat
students as adults — as individu
als responsible for themselves — it
should give each student the com
plete and total control over whom
they keep informed of their grades.
Although many people are open
with their personal information,
all students should have a chance
to choose the people with whom
they are open. And clearly, stu
dents desiring privacy should be
able to keep their grades confiden
tial, even from their RF.
Many students do not have a
close relationship with their RFs
— some don't have any relation
ship with them at all. Ignoringthis

fact, policy-makers may have felt
that giving grade reports to RFs
would equate to giving them to a
friendly and familiar presence
which has been watching over the
student all year.
In actuality, though, some stu
dents are having their very personal
grade reports examined by mere
acquaintances. Making matters
worse, these acquaintances change
every year for most undergraduates.
Administrators may be worried
that cases of academic failure
would increase if they were to take
the monitoring function away
from RFs across campus. However,
Stanford's strong advising system
makes this an unlikely possibility.
In addition to the RFs, academ
ic advisors already receive copies of
students' grades without student
permission. Although it is more
logical for advisors to look over the
grades of their advisees and dis
cuss their significance, this is still
an infraction of student's right to
privacy.
More severe student academic
problems should be settled in their
proper and conventional manner
— through professors, depart
ments and, in the worst cases, aca
demic probation.
To add RFs to Stanford's aca
demic safety net is totally unwar
ranted and only infringes on stu
dent privacy. RFs are spurred to
action by the contents of grade
reports in an extremely small
number of cases each year. For the
most part they serve as observers,
inspecting the private matters of
their residents with neither rea
sonable purpose nor student per
mission.
To think students need this sort
of parental monitoring is to ignore
the fact that they are capable
adults deserving of respect rather
than double-talk.
Indeed, the most distributing
aspect of this University policy is
that it is being carried out despite
the fact that it contrasts with the
well-reasoned position of Universi
ty administrators — that students
should be treated as adults.
