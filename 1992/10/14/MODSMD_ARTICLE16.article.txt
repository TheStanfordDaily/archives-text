## Frat critics show ignorance 
### 
ALL RIGHT, I ADMIT IT. I'M A frat
dick. The words conjure up some
awful images — most of them from
the mythic Animal House. For those of
you who believe that all fraternities are
like that, wake up. It's a movie.
Here at Stanford fraternities are
markedly different. They have been both
praised and derided, and deservedly so,
but unfortunately the criticism is more
common.
Fraternities have been accused of
being homophobic, sexist, racist and ine
briated dens of iniquity — almost always
by uninformed or ill-informed people.
This is just as invidious as the general
izations made by true homophobes, sex
ists or racists. Closed-minded judgment
does not become more tolerable simply
because a group is traditionally sneered
at. That fact often gets lost as Greeks
become the last acceptable whipping boys
(and girls) at Stanford.
Is the Greek system perfect? Obviously
not. Is dorm life perfect? Again, same
answer. In fact, fraternities are a micro
cosm of the student body as a whole.
There are many problems prevalent in our
campus community — sexism, racism,
homophobia. But those who assume there
is something in the air or water of a fra
ternity which causes or encourages these
problems is deluding himself.
Fraternity members do not transform
themselves the minute they leave their

freshman dorm. If the guy who lived next
to you in Branner was a true gentleman
or a true dork he will not mutate the
minute he signs a pledge card. To assume
so is insulting to all men. It implies a lack
of individuality or unique personality.
Pledging a fraternity is a choice simi
lar to the one everyone else makes about
their living arrangements. OK, so no
women live in a fraternity house. You got
me. Is it so difficult to believe that some
people find unique benefits in living with
members of the same sex? Ask the resi
dents of Roth the same question. It is a
conscious choice, one that is made not in
haste but after careful thought.
I made that choice at the end of my
freshman year, and it was an agonizing
one. Now, I've left my house to be a fresh
man RAin Donner, a similarly tough
choice. Did I leave because of some terri
ble misgivings about my initial choice?
Not at all. Both times I recognized the
opportunity for a new experience, one
that would challenge my beliefs and allow
me to challenge others.
Believe me, I challenged a lot of the
decisions made during my years in the
house. Mine were often challenged by my
brothers. I wouldn't have it any other way.
Maybe some of those who blindly crit
icize fraternities would be surprised by
the number and intensity of intellectual
debates in a house. Its easy to forget that
Stanford frat members are still Stanford

students and still possess all the qualities
which got them in. Maybe their image of
a group of Neanderthals holding beer
cans doesn't leave them room to recog
nize any redeeming qualities.
Maybe they choose to ignore events
like KA Mud Volleyball, Delta Gamma
Anchor Splash or any of the many other
community service events to which
Greeks devote themselves. Some might
even be surprised at programs like the
FARM alcohol series or Greek Rap about
sexual assault and gender issues.
I would not go back and change my
decision for anything. I reaped many ben
efits from my life in Taxi and was lucky
that my brothers were enthusiastic about
the benefits I could gain from returning
to Donner.
I'll encourage my freshman to at least
give the Greek system a look. Whether
they join or not doesn't interest me in the
least — it's not for everyone. But every
one of them is capable of evaluating the
merits and drawbacks of the system
objectively. I hope they do.
