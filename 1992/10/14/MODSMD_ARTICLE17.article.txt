Casper takes a dangerous approach to free speech

Gerhard casper has been
president of this University for
little over a month and already
he is attacking the principle of free
speech.
Although he is not (yet) proposing
sanctions to restrict the speech of Stan
ford faculty, he has declared that he
would prefer if these members of the
Stanford community did not exercise
their first amendment right to voice
their opinions on political matters.
President Casper reasons that politi
cal speech by University faculty is rep
resentative of the University as a
whole.
Using this same logic, Casper's use
of his position as a pulpit from which to
discourage political speech by Stanford
faculty sends the message that Stan
ford University is hostile to the princi

ple of free speech for certain members
of its community.
Casper's stance, as well as his justifi
cations for it, should be of concern to
the Stanford community for a host of
reasons in addition to his lack of
respect for free expression. For
instance, Casper's comment "The
minute I would take a position — and
indeed, your professors take a posi
tion. . .they are ending the discussion
(by silencing those who disagree),"
reflects an underestimation of the intel
ligence of the students at Stanford.
It implies that all students are so
awed by their professors that they will
be unable or unwilling to contradict the
political views of their professors.
Casper completely ignores those stu
dents who are incited to respond con
trarily to the political opinions of their

professors, thereby creating exciting
and informative discourse on the sub
ject. I, for one, am not awed into silence
by the position taken on this subject by
the University president.
I am troubled by Casper's equating
of silence on political matters with
being apolitical. If I have learned any
thing as a political science major, it is
that withholding comment on certain
matters is itself highly political.
For instance, in the aftermath of the
Rodney King trial, silence implied
acceptance, condoned the justice. Ask
ing professors to remain silent on mat
ters such as these is asking them to
support the status quo.
Finally, a refusal by the faculty to
voice their political leanings under
mines the educational mission of Stan
ford University in teaching students to

change the world. Students are encour
aged by the example of their professors
to learn that they must stand up and
express their political beliefs and values.
Professors come across as hypocrites
if they say, "Stand up and be counted.
Don't let anyone stop you from voicing
your political beliefs.
"Unless, of course, you are a univer
sity professor, in which case you should
avoid political controversy. Do as I say,
not as I do."
While I appreciate Casper's voicing
of his position on this issue — and I
encourage him to voice his opinion on
other issues of political significance — I
would urge him to encourage others to
do the same within the Stanford com
munity.
