# Taking political stands: part of president's job
## 
### 
University President Gerhard
Casper's vow to keep his politics private
has left me confused as to what he actu
ally intends to do in his new position.
As president of the University, he will
be forced to take, and indeed should
take, controversial stands on many far
ranging issues that are no less political
and no less influential than would be a
public endorsement of Ross Perot.
Take for instance the University's
proposed policy for domestic partners of
faculty and staff. The academic and cor
porate world will increasingly turn to
Stanford for guidance as it works
through the inevitable glitches involved
in getting this policy running smoothly.
Difficult decisions that the Universi
ty and its president make will have
tremendous influence on how numer
ous other institutions implement simi

lar policies.
Although Casper stated that he was
not chosen as president to use Stanford
"as a vehicle for propagating his person
al political view," it is inevitable that his
personal political views will strongly
temper the decisions he makes. And that
is to be expected, for he is only human.
As for the students, faculty and staff
of Stanford University, Casper should
also encourage them to take stands and
debate their own positions.
In our increasingly complex and
resource-strained world, we will all be
forced to make more decisions in the
near future that are by their nature very
political. It falls to Mr. Casper as presi
dent of this prestigious university to
take a lead in many of these important
issues. He can no more refuse to take
that lead as he can act to keep people
from inspecting his shopping cart at
Safeway.
