# Vote for 'Death with Dignity' Act in Nov.
## 
### 
Next month on election day, California
voters will have an opportunity to cast an
important vote concerning their future,
should they wish to avoid needless suffer
ing and personal degradation. I am refer
ring to Proposition 161, the Death with
Dignity Act.
The law is carefully written. It would
allow only a mentally competent person
— not anyone in a coma or with
Alzheimer's disease or temporarily
depressed — to receive medical aid in
dying. He or she would have to make a
durable request, not just a fleeting
impulse, and be declared terminally ill by
at least two physicians.
Many humane physicians already
attend to this need. Proposition 161
would give everyone the chance to request
aid in dying from their physician, but only
if they need it, want it and qualify for it.

Fears of involuntary euthanasia, or
putting away "undesirables" are utterly
groundless. Be aware that there are dif
ferences between suicide (ending of a
viable and potentially happy life) and
death with dignity (ending of a painful
and soon-to-be-terminated life with no
hope of a happy future).
I encourage all voters to take advan
tage of this opportunity on election day
and vote "yes" on Proposition 161 to help
those who wish to end their suffering inn
dignified and humane manner.
