## Hoover Fellow wins economics prize 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer with AP wire reports 
Hoover Institution Senior Fel
low Gary Becker was awarded the
1992 Nobel Prize for Economic
Sciences for his unprecedented
studies of social issues from an
economic perspective, the
Swedish Academy of Sciences an
nounced yesterday.
Becker, a professor of econom
ics and sociology at the University
of Chicago, became a senior fellow
in 1990 and has been affiliated
with Hoover since being named to
the institution's Domestic Studies
Advisory Board in 1973.
Although Becker said he was
"happy, surprised, still in a bit of
shock" in an interview with the
Associated Press, his colleagues
said Becker's revolutionary work
had made him a clear candidate.
University President Gerhard
Casper, who worked with Becker
at the University of Chicago, said
he, "along with many members of
the economic profession have ex
pected this to happen for a num
ber of years.
"In the case of Becker, our ex
pectation was not of whether, but
of when," Casper added.
Senior Hoover Fellow Milton
Friedman, who taught Becker at
the University of Chicago in 1951,

said he felt the award was long
overdue.
Friedman, a 1976 Nobel Prize
winner in economics, has recom
mended Becker for the award
since 1982.
Becker "is one of the most cre
ative economists of his genera
tion," Friedman said. "He applied
economic theory to subject matter
not considered previously."
In the 19505, Becker's studies
connecting social issues such as
the family, discrimination and
crime to economic principles were

met with controversy and doubt.
However, these theories have
since been heralded as "simply
pathbreaking" by colleagues such
as Casper.
"Few people deny he has
opened up a field of study in the
extension of labor economy to the
family," Casper said.
Economics Prof. John Taylor
said most modern economists
have studied and applied Becker's
theories in their work.
Taylor said Becker's most
important contribution to the
field was the concept of "human

capital."
For example, Taylor said Beck
er was the first to measure the
investment value of a college edu
cation in economic terms. Becker
calculated the monetary worth of
post-high school education in
terms of the higher earnings of
college graduates, Taylor said.
Friedman said before Becker,
sociology and political science
were not viewed as part of eco
nomics. However, Becker's doc
toral dissertation on the eco
nomics of discrimination bridged
the gaps and gave the field a new
social relevance.
Friedman said he and Becker
have maintained contact for
almost 40 years.
"He has been enormously pro

ductive," he said. "We have both
benefited from mutual admiration."
Casper said he has known
Becker in several contexts. At the
University of Chicago, they both
participated in faculty seminars
between the Law School and the
Economics Department.
As provost of the University of
Chicago, Casper said he also con
sulted with Becker on University
issues and "became a friend over
the years."
Becker is "a very quiet, intel
lectual type," Casper said. "He
doesn't say very much, but when
he speaks, he furthers discussion
considerably."
Casper said he first learned of
the news yesterday morning, and
"was delighted to know that he

was a part of Stanford."
A staff member in the Presi
dent's Office said Casper's
"shrieks of joy" could be heard
when he made the discovery.
Becker is also a columnist for
"Business Week" magazine and has
written numerous books and arti
cles, including "Human Capital"
and "A Treatise on the Family."
He received his Ph.D. at the
University of Chicago in 1955.
Friedman also noted that
Becker is "a splendid tennis play
er." "He plays both singles and
doubles and can beat me easily,"
Friedman said.
