Hoover Institution Senior Fel
low Gary Becker was awarded the
1992 Nobel Prize for Economic
Sciences for his unprecedented

Associated Press, his colleagues

winner in economics, has recom

economic theory to subject matter
not considered previously."

connecting social issues such as
the family, discrimination and
crime to economic principles were
