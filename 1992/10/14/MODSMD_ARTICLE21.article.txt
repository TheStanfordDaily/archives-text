# Staff Notebook
## June Cohen Daily lacks female columnist applications, searches for reason 
### 
u "C T"ou're afraid to win," my rac
quctball partner — and man-
JL aging editor — accused, as I
choked on my third serve in a row.
"You're just like all the women afraid to
be columnists."
I shook off his words with a smirk at
the time, but two weeks later, they're
still with me.
Each day since then I've mulled over
his accusation. Each day since then I've
sat down to write this column. And each
day since then I've erased file after file
on the computer so nobody would stum
ble upon words I thought unworthy of
anyone's eyes but my own.
Twice a year, The Daily solicits appli
cations for columnists, and twice a year
editors are faced with the same unex
plained facts.
Only three of this year's 42 applicants
were women. And while our total pool of
applicants often reaches 60, never are
there more than five women.
Why, we ask ourselves over and over,
don't more women apply to write
columns?
If my experience and insecurities are
at all representative, I think I might
have come up with an answer.
I first mentioned my plan to write a

staff notebook about the conspicuous
absence of women columnists while we —
three men and myself — were reading the
first batch of applications two weeks ago.
Immediately, before the words had
even left my mouth, one of the men
interrupted me. "No," he said. "I want
to write it."
While his assertion in itself was
telling — and gave us a laugh at his
expense — my reaction was even more
revealing. Instead of getting angry at his
lack of consideration, my first thought
was, "He's right. He'd do a better job
than I would. He should write it."
A "typical female" reaction, to be
sure. But I thought women had over
come that mentality — of deferring to
men out of habit as much as insecurity
— years ago.
Why did it take me more than two
weeks to force myself to sit down and
write this piece? Why is it that — even
after becoming editor in chief, I still
have difficulty writing columns for fear
they'll be ridiculed?
For me, the critical difference
between writing a column and writing
something else — say a news article or
an editorial that represents the opinion
of a group — is that to write an effective

column, you have to put yourself and
your beliefs on the line.
Not just your name, not just your
journalistic integrity, but yourself.
And for women, who often struggle to
define and defend their identities on a
personal level, the idea of bringing them
selves further into the public eye is
extremely intimidating.
Throughout our lives, women face
overwhelming pressure to conform to
other's images of what we should be. We
are told from birth that we must be slen
der and large-breasted and sweet and
docile and not too contrary if we want to
be loved. Seeking happiness as everyone
does, we do our best to deliver.
But despite our outward compliance,
we allow ourselves some internal rebel
lion. Somewhere inside we preserve and
nurture the person we really are. But
access to this side of ourselves — the
part that's cranky and selfish and com
petitive and imperfectly proportioned —
is reserved for the privileged few.
This dichotomy — of the public and
private, the physical and spiritual self —
is one that reappears in women's writ
ings from Jane Austin to Amy Tan.
From the first time a man pulled over
and tried to convince me — at age 11 —

to go for a car ride with him, to the
eighth-grade class in which the teacher
joked about my breasts with my male
classmates, to the countless times men
have sarcastically hollered "nice ass" as I
jogged around Campus Drive, I have
found myself all too often an unwilling
object of somewhat predatory attention.
But while my face and breasts and
hair may be on display for the world to
criticize, no one — no one — can reach
my soul without my consent.
A woman's thoughts are, at times, the
only possessions that are truly hers, the
only thing that others can't steal or dis
parage.
And the idea of opening that side of
ourselves up for everyone to see and crit
icize and maybe even hate is a frighten
ing prospect. The thought of people who
don't even know us tearing our words to
pieces around a breakfast table or mock
ing them in the pages of The Stanford
Review is truly terrifying.
Because in the same way that a
woman's self-esteem is intimately
attached to her appearance, it is also
attached to her thoughts. And attacks on
her beliefs are frequently internalized as
attacks on her person.
When Joel Stein writes a lousy col-

umn, I can tell him so without mortally
damaging his self-esteem. But for many
women, the stakes are considerably
higher.
Ever notice that the only people talk
ing in Political Science classes are men
— and maybe one brave woman labeled
the class bitch? Well I have. And usually
I don't have the guts to be the one out
spoken woman who's hated and feared
for her unrelenting tongue.
I guess that's the part of me that
hasn't quite come to terms with the idea
that people can disagree with me with
out my being wrong. And I can disagree
with them without being a bitch.
But if women don't start disagreeing,
don't start daring to have an opinion,
our voices will never be heard save
through the mutating microphone of
men who speak up for us.
And if, as editor in chief, I'm not will
ing to put myself on the line, to let peo
ple see — if only for a few brief moments
— what's going on behind my byline,
how can I expect it of others?
I have a feeling my racquetball game
is about to take a turn for the better.

June Cohen is editor in chief of The
Stanford Daily.
