## Doctors discover strategies for suppressing immune system Learning how the human body fights intruders is key to preventing rejection of organ transplants 
### Nicholas Strauss Staff writer 
The ability of doctors to transplant
body parts from one person to another is
rapidly approaching the realm of science
fiction. Today, doctors can practically
swap chest cavities through multiple
organ transplants, although the proce
dure is rare and risky. Simpler surgeries,
however, are approaching routine levels.
But all of the surgical skill in the world
is of little use if the recipient's body
rejects the new tissues. Rejection is the
immune system's response to transplant
ed tissues. Treating it like any other for
eign matter (bacteria or virus infected
cells), the system attacks the new organ,
eventually destroying it.
To prevent this, doctors use a variety
of immunosuppressive drugs to stem
rejection. These chemicals prevent the
immune system from attacking the
newly transplanted organ, allowing it to
function inside the recipient.
Until recently, however, the function
ing of immunosuppressive drugs was
about as well understood as was the rest
of the immune system — that is — very
poorly.
In a series of articles published in the
journals Nature, Science, and Cell, a team
of Stanford Medical Center researchers
have unraveled the biochemical mecha
nisms behind the immune system's chain
of response.
The implications of this discovery go
well beyond the simple understanding of

how one or two drugs work. With
immunosuppressive action more fully
understood, doctors may learn how to
combine existing drugs or even develop
new drugs in order to reduce quantities
administered.
These actions would ease the danger
ous side effects of current drug doses,
which currently disable the entire
immune system, leaving the body more
vulnerable to attack from disease.
The team, headed by Associate Investi
gator Gerald Crabtree, focused on the
most popular and effective drug,
Cyclosporin, as well as the newer and
more promising FK-506.
It was well understood that
Cyclosporin somehow interfered with the
working of T-cells. These cells are scouts
for the immune system, sensing the pres
ence of foreign tissues, and signaling anti
bodies to begin the actual process of
destroying any "intruder." A T-cell is cov
ered with molecular receptors to which
antigens — chemicals which identify bod
ily tissues — bond.
Crabtree and postdoctoral fellows
Katharine Ullman and Michael Flanagan
demonstrated, based on research pub
lished last fall, that the signaling process
was somehow calcium dependent.
If one of these antigens is foreign, for
example, the receptor begins to release
large amounts of calcium inside the T
cell. The release of calcium stimulates the
production of calcineurin, an intracellular
enzyme.
Another postdoctoral fellow, Neil Clip

stone, performed the research which
pinned calcineurin as the key biochemical
transmitter of foreign antigen informa
tion. He did so by identifying calcineurin
as the agent upon which cyclosporin and
FK-506 act.
Clipstone's experiment began by intro
ducing genetic alterations into T-cells so
that they produced large, excess amounts
of calcineurin.
When cyclosporin was administered in
normal doses to these altered cells, they
functioned unimpeded. Cyclosporin, he
concluded, functions by binding with the
calcineurin molecules before they can
carry their message. Once tied up by
cyclosporin, the calcineurin could no
longer transmit the signal to begin the
attack.
When excess calcineurin was present,
and a normal dose of cyclosporin adminis
tered, there remained sufficient free
molecules of calcineurin to carry the
attack order, so the drug failed.
This July, Crabtree and graduate stu
dent Calvin Kuo identified the signaling
pathway of a new, and as yet experimen
tal, suppressive drug called rapamycin.
This drug attacks at a different point in
the T-cell's signaling pathway. Rapamycin
interferes with the reproduction of T-cells
after they identify an intruder.
Normally, an activated T-cell begins to
reproduce rapidly, thereby spreading its
message. Rapamycin blocks the chemical
trigger which initiates this burst of growth,
thereby preventing the T-cells from repro
ducing and spreading their alarm.

Exactly how rapamycin neutralizes the
growth trigger is as yet unknown. Crab
tree and Kuo are confident that within a
few months they will identify
rapamycin's direct target as well.
Since doctors are now aware of three
immunosuppressives, which attack two
different stages of the signaling chain,
researchers are hopeful that combined
therapy will become possible.
With cyclosporin and FK-506 hinder

ing calcineurin transmission and
rapamycin preventing T-cell reproduc
tion, doctors hope that lower doses may
be used.
I)r. Randall Morris, director of the
Laboratory of Transplantation Immunol
ogy in the Department of Cardiothoracic
Surgery, is pursuing this application,
which promises reduced or eliminated
side effects from the immunosuppressive
treatments.

Foreign tissues like organ transplants release antigens that stimulate T-cells. The
cells produce enzymes that signal "killer" cells to attack the tissue. Certain drugs
bind with calcineurin, preventing the molecule from stimulating enzyme production.
