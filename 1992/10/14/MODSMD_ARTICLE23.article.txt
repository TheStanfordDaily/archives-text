# Geologist helps date mother of all meteorites

Michael McWilliams, associate professor of geo
physics and geology, is part of a team of scientists
that has confirmed the existence and the age of a
crater large enough to have caused the great
dinosaur extinction 65 million years ago.
His team's contribution is part of the advances
that "are all little snippets" in fleshing out the
whole story of the mass extinction, he said.
The crater's center is located at Chicxulub,
which lies on the northern coast of the Yucatan
Peninsula in Mexico.
In 1980 Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis
Alvarez and his son, Walter, suggested that a large
meteor impact or several impacts were possibly the
cause of the extinction. Their proposal prompted
scientists around the world to begin searching for
craters that fit the hypothesis.
Since 1980, various sites have been identified as
possible candidates. However, scientists have had
difficulty locating a crater of the sufficient size.
Last year, Chicxulub emerged as the crater's
"prime" location, McWilliams said. Petroleum
exploration led to the discovery of Chicxulub and
the samples from the crater all came from a drilling
core, he said. If an impact origin is confirmed, the
Yucatan site will be the largest impact crater ever
found on Earth.
According to McWillimans, researchers found
the crater's shape and size by mapping the earth's
gravitational and magnetic fields in areas sur
rounding the peninsula. Eormed by an object 15
kilometers in diameter, the crater is approximately
180 kilometers in diameter.
Recently, McWilliams' team, which consists of
geologists from around the world, verified the age
of Chicxulub.
The team found that the crater was "about the
right age to have been related to an impact that
may have had something to do with the killing of

all the dinosaurs," McWilliams explained. The exis
tence of such a crater may be "the smoking gun" in
research about the extinction, he added.
His team contributed to the research by verify
ing that tektites, "melted droplets of rock," found
in the surrounding areas were "precisely the same
age" as the melted rocks in the crater itself, he said.
Tektites of the same age were found as far west
as Arroyo el Mimbral in northeastern Mexico and
as far as east Beloc in Haiti.
When an object from space lands on earth there
is a huge upheaval that causes matter to splatter
all over, McWilliams said.
To find the age of the rocks, the team used a
technique called Argon-Argon (40Ar/39Ar) dating,

a process analogous to carbon dating. Carbon dat
ing, however, can only date materials that are only
tens of thousands of years old, while Argon-Argon
dating allows scientists to find the age of rocks that
are billions of years old, McWilliams said.
According to McWilliams, the Yucatan region
exhibited other signs of a large impact. Not only
were there melted rocks present at the crater site,
wave deposits also surrounded the area in a circu
lar formation," he said. "If a crater hit the ocean,
there would have been huge tidal waves in the
Caribbean basin," and the deposits are evidence of
tidal waves, he said.
McWilliams does his work in the geochronology
lab in the basement of the Mitchell Building.

Michael McWilliams prepares to beam a laser onto a rock sample. When heated, the specimen will
release argon isotopes, which will then be used to date the sample.
