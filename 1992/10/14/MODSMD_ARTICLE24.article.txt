Q: What is the latest scientific evidence on how
reliable and accurate lie detector tests are?
— Pinocchio
A: I'm a little leery of answering this question. I
might be providing some unsavory character
with the information he needs to scam a lie detec
tor test and traumatize some innocent people.
But hey, I'm a journalist. I'm not responsible for
what the reader does with the information I pro
vide. If I'm helping the Son of Sam get off the hook,
or Humbert Humbert to get a job at Bing Nursery
School, that's all within my First Amendment
Rights.
A lie detector, also called a "polygraph," is a
device that collects data about a subject's physio
logical responses to questioning. These data are
then interpreted by the examiner to evaluate the
truthfulness of the subject's answers.
It is reasonably well established that lying trig
gers an increase in the parameters measured by the
polygraph: heart rate, breathing rate, sweating, etc.
When the examiners see such a change, they con
clude that they subject is lying.
Unfortunately, heavy breathing, sweaty palms
and a pounding heart are not especially specific
symptoms. Fear, pain, embarrassment, or a sudden
and unexpected engagement to be married can all
trigger the signals read by a polygraph as evidence
that the subject is lying.
Consequently, some wit devised the Control
Question Test (CQT), in which the examiner asks
the subject several sorts of questions.
Some questions are relevant to the crime ("Did
you use government money to buy silk sheets for
your bedroom?"), while some are "controls," which
are irrelevant but intended to evoke a reaction
("Have you ever engaged in abnormal or deviant

sexual behavior?"). Some questions are neutral ("Is
your name Donald Kennedy?").
The idea behind the CQT is that a guilty indi
vidual will respond much more strongly to the spe
cific queries than the control questions. Unfortu
nately, innocent subjects may recognize relevant
questions and exhibit a strong reaction, solely due
to their anxiety that their answers will falsely indi
cate guilt.
To prevent such false assignment of guilt, exam
iners use another form of polygraph exam called the
Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT). Here, the examiner
looks for strong reactions to specific pieces of infor
mation that would be unknown to a potentially
innocent person.
If $687 had been stolen from a safe, the GKT
questioner might ask, "The amount of money
stolen from the safe was $104? $383? $687?
$1,132?" The perpetrator would be expected to
react more strongly to the correct amount than to
the other figures.
The GKT thus avoids false assignments of guilt,
but it is less broadly applicable than the CQT and
forces the interrogator to focus on facts known to
the authorities but unavailable (and unguessable)
to innocent subjects.

Coupled with what we circuit-brained scientists
scornfully call the "human factor" (imagine your
self as the interrogator, attempting to ask Sharon
Stone the right questions as she slowly crosses and
uncrosses her legs), the weaknesses of control-ques
tion and guilty-knowledge testing can cripple the
effectiveness of both techniques.
Reliability, defined as the consistency of evalua
tions between examiners, suffers less at the hands
of these factors than does accuracy, the agreement
of evaluations with the truth.
Most students of the polygraph agree that evalu
ations given by separate examiners to the same sub
ject yield similar results. Thus the test is fairly reli
abile.
The question of whether these exams are accu
rate is a different matter entirely. Lab studies of
accuracy generally yield validity figures upwards of
80 percent. This is considered "high" accuracy by
polygraph advocates.
It seems to me, however, that any technique that
finds one out of five innocent subjects guilty is,
ahem, highly suspect itself.
Furthermore, contrived laboratory crimes per
formed for extra Psych 1 credit have little emotion
al significance to the subjects, and can't be expected
to evoke the levels of palm sweat that a formal legal
accusation can.
The findings in field studies are even less
encouraging. First of all, it's really hard to figure
out whether a suspect is "actually" telling the
truth. Researchers try to get around this by using
the concurrence of a panel of attorneys as an evalu
ation of "truth, but even then, accuracy can creep
as low as 70 percent for assignments of guilt and 50
percent for assignments of innocence. Remember,
that's the trained-monkey-tossing-a-coin value.
And with the prices of polygraphs being what
they are, I'll take Bonzo with a nickel any day.

Q: What is the latest scientific evidence on how
reliable and accurate lie detector tests are?
— Pinocchio
A: I'm a little leery of answering this question. I
might be providing some unsavory character
with the information he needs to scam a lie detec
tor test and traumatize some innocent people.
But hey, I'm a journalist. I'm not responsible for
what the reader does with the information I pro
vide. If I'm helping the Son of Sam get off the hook,
or Humbert Humbert to get a job at Bing Nursery
School, that's all within my First Amendment
Rights.
A lie detector, also called a "polygraph," is a
device that collects data about a subject's physio
logical responses to questioning. These data are
then interpreted by the examiner to evaluate the
truthfulness of the subject's answers.
It is reasonably well established that lying trig
gers an increase in the parameters measured by the
polygraph: heart rate, breathing rate, sweating, etc.
When the examiners see such a change, they con
clude that they subject is lying.
Unfortunately, heavy breathing, sweaty palms
and a pounding heart are not especially specific
symptoms. Fear, pain, embarrassment, or a sudden
and unexpected engagement to be married can all
trigger the signals read by a polygraph as evidence
that the subject is lying.
Consequently, some wit devised the Control
Question Test (CQT), in which the examiner asks
the subject several sorts of questions.
Some questions are relevant to the crime ("Did
you use government money to buy silk sheets for
your bedroom?"), while some are "controls," which
are irrelevant but intended to evoke a reaction
("Have you ever engaged in abnormal or deviant

sexual behavior?"). Some questions are neutral ("Is
your name Donald Kennedy?").
The idea behind the CQT is that a guilty indi
vidual will respond much more strongly to the spe
cific queries than the control questions. Unfortu
nately, innocent subjects may recognize relevant
questions and exhibit a strong reaction, solely due
to their anxiety that their answers will falsely indi
cate guilt.
To prevent such false assignment of guilt, exam
iners use another form of polygraph exam called the
Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT). Here, the examiner
looks for strong reactions to specific pieces of infor
mation that would be unknown to a potentially
innocent person.
If $687 had been stolen from a safe, the GKT
questioner might ask, "The amount of money
stolen from the safe was $104? $383? $687?
$1,132?" The perpetrator would be expected to
react more strongly to the correct amount than to
the other figures.
The GKT thus avoids false assignments of guilt,
but it is less broadly applicable than the CQT and
forces the interrogator to focus on facts known to
the authorities but unavailable (and unguessable)
to innocent subjects.

Coupled with what we circuit-brained scientists
scornfully call the "human factor" (imagine your
self as the interrogator, attempting to ask Sharon
Stone the right questions as she slowly crosses and
uncrosses her legs), the weaknesses of control-ques
tion and guilty-knowledge testing can cripple the
effectiveness of both techniques.
Reliability, defined as the consistency of evalua
tions between examiners, suffers less at the hands
of these factors than does accuracy, the agreement
of evaluations with the truth.
Most students of the polygraph agree that evalu
ations given by separate examiners to the same sub
ject yield similar results. Thus the test is fairly reli
abile.
The question of whether these exams are accu
rate is a different matter entirely. Lab studies of
accuracy generally yield validity figures upwards of
80 percent. This is considered "high" accuracy by
polygraph advocates.
It seems to me, however, that any technique that
finds one out of five innocent subjects guilty is,
ahem, highly suspect itself.
Furthermore, contrived laboratory crimes per
formed for extra Psych 1 credit have little emotion
al significance to the subjects, and can't be expected
to evoke the levels of palm sweat that a formal legal
accusation can.
