## Stanford completes decade of Pac-10 wins over Cal 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
It may not have been exactly what Stan
ford women's volleyball head coach Don
Shaw wanted from his second-ranked Car
dinal, but as the old sports philosopher
says, a win is a win.
Stanford overcame its own playing
errors and California's scrappy defense to
defeat the Golden Bears 15-13, 15-12, 15-3
last night at Maples Pavilion. In a match
where neither team was able to execute
effectively, the Cardinal (12-1, 6-1 in Pacif
ic 10 conference play) relied on key individ
ual performances from Cary Wendell, Jen
nifer Jackson, and tri-captain Bev Oden to
get the job done.
"It was a struggle," Shaw said after the
game. "In the first two games we didn't look
that crisp — we had problems on the serve,
our rally organization wasn't there. We
really weren't hitting smart."
Though the Cardinal managed to sweep
the Bears 3-0, California started the match
with five straight points, and tied Stanford
late in the first game at 13-13 before losing
the final two points. In the second game,
the Cardinal built a 9-3 lead early on, but
California rallied back to within a point, 13-
12, before losing the second game. Stanford
finally seemed to regain composure in the
third game, rattling off eight unanswered
points to start the match and holding the
Bears to a 15-3 score.
"You have to give credit to Cal," Shaw
said. "They always had two blockers in our
face, and they shut down our middle hitting
game, so we had to go to our outside hit
ters."
And when the middle hitting game stops,
so does all-American hitter Oden. But Shaw
noted that while Cal's game plan may have

frustrated many of Oden's hitting attempts,
it didn't frustrate Oden.
"She stayed in the game plan," said
Shaw. "She kept hitting through two block
ers every time, and she's a good enough
player to get a few of those."
On the whole, Shaw was impressed with
California's showing against the Cardinal,
seeing as the Golden Bears recently lost to
the previously-winless Arizona Wildcats.
"They looked well-prepared for us, which
might be the fact that they had the whole
weekend to prepare, that they had the emo
tion coming in," Shaw said. "But emotion
can only carry you so far, and by the third
game they really couldn't stay up."
California head coach Dave DeGroot
echoed Shaw's sentiments. "We needed to
sustain intensity like we did against ASU,"
said DeGroot. "and we just weren't able to
keep it through the third game."
DeGroot also gave credit to the defenses
of both teams. "We had some long rallies
out there — some scrappy play by both
defenses," DeGroot said. "After some
points, I just had to stand up and applaud."
The Cardinal was led on offense by hitter
Cary Wendell and senior hitter Jennifer
Jackson. Jackson hit .360 with 13 kills and
11 digs on the night, while the freshman
Wendell paced the team with 13 kills and 13
digs, hitting .308 on the night.
The Cardinal has now extended its all
time Pac-10 streak against the Bears to 13-
0, and leads the all-time series 29-3. Stan
ford has not lost to Cal in a women's colle
giate volleyball match since Oct. 1, 1982.
The Cardinal will host Washington State
and Washington this weekend at Maples
Pavilion as part of its six-game home stand.
Both games will start at 7:30 p.m. Stanford
leads the nation with an average home
attendance this vear of 3,696.
