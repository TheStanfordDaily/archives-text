# Following the yellow brick road to the Rose Bowl
## 
### 
Sitting in Pasadena Saturday evening,
it was easy to daydream and wishful
ly look towards the future, a certain
Jan. 1 future.
After the Cardinal's opening drive,
where the team marched 71 yards in 10
plays, visions of the Grandaddy started to
take shape. The end zones, rather than
reading "UCLA" and "Bruins", would say
"Stanford" and "Michigan." Even this
year's team T-shirts allude to the game,
stating "Stanford Football 1992 — The
War for the Roses."
It's easy to hop on the Cardinal band
wagon after the team crushed Notre Dame
and Touchdown Jesus in South Bend, and
then came back from that win to beat
UCLA on the road. The No. 8 ranking for
Stanford, the school's highest since 1970,
doesn't hurt the conscience either. But

there is reason for reservation. Guarded
optimism should be the code words when
mentioning Stanford and the Rose Bowl in
the same sentence.
Aside from Stanford's opening drive,
and tailback Glyn Milburn's Heisman
esque 75-yard punt return in the first
quarter, the Card offense was stagnant
against the Bruins. On the night, Stanford

was a dismal 2-for-14 on third down con
versions.
The strength of the Card squad thus far
has been the defense. The defense generat
ed all remaining points in the UCLA game,
with Coy Gibbs' interception at the begin
ning of the third quarter giving the offense
the ball at the UCLA 22-yard line, and Ron
George's sack of Bruin quarterback Rob
Walker near the end of the game resulting
in a safety.
The Stanford defense completely stifled
UCLA's young, depleted, inexperienced
offense, holding the Bruins to negative
four net rushing yards and letting fresh
man signal-caller Walker taste the grass
six times. The Card "D" is currently an
impressive fifth in the nation in total
defense, and second in rushing defense.
To the casual football observer, one

would expect these type of numbers from
the Stanford offense, especially considering
that Bill Walsh, the mastermind/guru
behind three Super Bowl titles with the
San Francisco 49ers, stands on the side
lines.
To put it bluntly, the offense needs to
get its act together to take some of the bur
den off of the defense. It is remarkable that
the defense continues to put up such great
numbers considering the amount of time
they spend on the field.
However, getting the offense to be a
consistent force is going to take time, and
the upcoming schedule is not easy by any
standard. So, Cardinal fans, be patient.
The season is only half over, and with the
possible exception of Oregon State, every
remaining game is going to be tough.
One of the toughest could be this Satur

day's contest against Arizona at Stanford
Stadium. The real question is, which Ari
zona team is going to show up? Will it be
the one that lost to Washington State and
tied Oregon State, or will it be the Wildcat
gridders that almost shocked the college
football world with a near upset at No. 2
Miami and then crushed UCLA at home by
twenty points? The solid Arizona defense
could give our offense problems, and as last
year's 28-23 defeat at Arizona showed, U of
A quarterback George Malauulu can
unleash his wizardry at any time.
Then in two weeks time, if the Card can
win its next two games, the Game of the
Year will be played in Seattle. Top-ranked
Washington is a beatable ballclub, but the
Stanford offense will have to do its part so

the defense can be ready for the
Huskies' extremely potent offense.
If, and that's a considerable if,
our gridders beat Washington,
they will have to contend with
nationally-ranked USC, followed
by Washington State and Cal. As
the saying goes, that's no stroll
through the quad!
So before the words Rose Bowl
come to your lips, stop and pause.
Yes, Stanford is good, but just how
good remains to be seen.

liked the Rose Bowl press box so

there is reason for reservation. Guarded
optimism should be the code words when
mentioning Stanford and the Rose Bowl in
the same sentence.
Aside from Stanford's opening drive,
and tailback Glyn Milburn's Heisman
esque 75-yard punt return in the first
quarter, the Card offense was stagnant
against the Bruins. On the night, Stanford

was a dismal 2-for-14 on third down con
versions.
The strength of the Card squad thus far
has been the defense. The defense generat
ed all remaining points in the UCLA game,
with Coy Gibbs' interception at the begin
ning of the third quarter giving the offense
the ball at the UCLA 22-yard line, and Ron
George's sack of Bruin quarterback Rob
Walker near the end of the game resulting
in a safety.
The Stanford defense completely stifled
UCLA's young, depleted, inexperienced
offense, holding the Bruins to negative
four net rushing yards and letting fresh
man signal-caller Walker taste the grass
six times. The Card "D" is currently an
impressive fifth in the nation in total
defense, and second in rushing defense.
To the casual football observer, one

would expect these type of numbers from
the Stanford offense, especially considering
that Bill Walsh, the mastermind/guru
behind three Super Bowl titles with the
San Francisco 49ers, stands on the side
lines.
To put it bluntly, the offense needs to
get its act together to take some of the bur
den off of the defense. It is remarkable that
the defense continues to put up such great
numbers considering the amount of time
they spend on the field.
However, getting the offense to be a
consistent force is going to take time, and
the upcoming schedule is not easy by any
standard. So, Cardinal fans, be patient.
The season is only half over, and with the
possible exception of Oregon State, every
remaining game is going to be tough.
One of the toughest could be this Satur

day's contest against Arizona at Stanford
Stadium. The real question is, which Ari
zona team is going to show up? Will it be
the one that lost to Washington State and
tied Oregon State, or will it be the Wildcat
gridders that almost shocked the college
football world with a near upset at No. 2
Miami and then crushed UCLA at home by
twenty points? The solid Arizona defense
could give our offense problems, and as last
year's 28-23 defeat at Arizona showed, U of
A quarterback George Malauulu can
unleash his wizardry at any time.
Then in two weeks time, if the Card can
win its next two games, the Game of the
Year will be played in Seattle. Top-ranked
Washington is a beatable ballclub, but the
Stanford offense will have to do its part so

the defense can be ready for the
Huskies' extremely potent offense.
If, and that's a considerable if,
our gridders beat Washington,
they will have to contend with
nationally-ranked USC, followed
by Washington State and Cal. As
the saying goes, that's no stroll
through the quad!
So before the words Rose Bowl
come to your lips, stop and pause.
Yes, Stanford is good, but just how
good remains to be seen.

David Schwartz is not a pessimist.
Despite what you just read, he
liked the Rose Bowl press box so
much that he has tentative reserva
tions for a $30,000 luxury suite on
New Year's Day. He'll invite you if
you ante up $30,000 to pay for it.
