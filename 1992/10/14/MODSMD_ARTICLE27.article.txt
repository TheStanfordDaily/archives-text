# Stanford soccer prays for victory against St. Mary's Gaels at home
## 
### Kathryn Yang 
After thoroughly trouncing the Ore
gon State Beavers last Sunday, 3-0, the
Stanford men's soccer squad is looking to
maintain its momentum as they head
into tomorrow's match against the St.
Mary's Gaels in a non-conference duel.
The Cardinal (8-4-0, 2-1 in conference
play) are currently second in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation, and trail
Washington by only one game in the
standings. Coming off a big conference
win, Stanford will have to try and main
tain their intensity against a less power
ful St. Mary's team before turning their
attention back to their crucial conference
games.
"Against St. Mary's we have to repeat
our Oregon State performance by getting
early goals and establishing our rhythm
of play," said Stanford leading scorer
Jason Vanacour. "Every game now is
very important. And for us as a team, it's
just a matter of coming out with the
right focus and the right frame of mind."
Leading the Cardinal offense will be
senior co-captain Randy Mann who will
orchestrate the passing game from the
mid-field. In addition, the team is also

looking for another strong performance
from freshman forward, and Canadian
native, Carmen D'Onofrio, who is com
ing off of a one-goal-and-one-assist game
against Oregon State.
"Carmen is starting to come alive
now," coach Colin Lindores said. "He is
beginning to make the transition from
Canadian soccer to American soccer by
concentrating not only on the forward
aspect of the game, but the entire game.
We'll be looking for a lot from him from
now on."
In trying to counter a steady Stanford
defense led by senior co-captain and goal
keeper Kyle Krpata, the St. Mary's Gaels
have assembled a line-up which features
senior Adam Bliss, who has already tal
lied six goals and one assist thus far in
the season. On the field, the Gaels are
also considered one of the fastest teams
in the country.
However, St. Mary's will be without
their ace, forward Juan Guarda, former
NCAA Freshman of the Year. Hailing
from Chile, Guarda is out for the season
with a severe knee injury that might
require surgery. Instead, he has opted to
reserve his eligibility for next year by
red-shirting on the squad this year.

Despite that, the Cardinal under
stands that the Gaels, a perennial rival
from the West Coast Conference, will
raise their level of play a couple of notch
es when going up against Stanford.
"We won the St. Mary's Tournament
earlier in the season, but we haven't
played them yet this year," Krpata said.
Following the St. Mary's game tomor
row will be a road trip to California as the
Cardinal faces off against the Golden
Bears on Cal's home Astro Turf. After
that, Stanford will gear up for the home
stretch with the NCAA Tournament in
sight as they host the rest of their games
on Malonev Field.
