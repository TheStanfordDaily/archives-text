# Inconsistent Arizona squad poses challenge for Cardinal
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal begins the second half of
its season Saturday against a Jekyll and
Hyde Arizona team that boasts a defense
which rivals Stanford's own.
The Wildcats and their quick, bruising
defense pose a challenge for the banged
up Cardinal that head coach Bill Walsh
says will be similar to the one Texas A&M
offered in the season opener.
Arizona, after tying also-ran Oregon
State and losing to Washington State
early in the year, has allowed only 11
points in its last two games. The Wildcats
came within an eyelash of upsetting then-
No. 1 Miami, losing 8-7 in the Orange
Bowl, and then completely shut down
UCIJ\, 23-3, Oct. 3.

Arizona had a bye last weekend, so
they will have had two weeks to prepare
for Stanford and recuperate from minor
injuries come game-time.
Stanford could use the luxury of such
rest. Inside linebacker Tom Williams will
be back in action Saturday after a three
game hiatus. But the list of limping Car
dinal runs deep.
Pacific 10 Conference Defensive Player
of the Week Ron George is suffering from
a contusion in his left leg, and will likely
not practice before Friday. The same goes
for full-fledged Heisman candidate Glyn
Milburn, whose right shoulder is ailing.
Starting tight end Ryan Wetnight and
starting strong safety Seyon Albert are
not likely to see practice action this week,
either.
"I'm sure Arizona is really looking for

ward to playing us this week," Walsh said.
"At this moment there isn't anybody in
the country playing better defense than
Arizona. And I think they feel we will let
down after our two very intense efforts
the last two weeks."
Don't expect it.
Last year, the Wildcats pulled off a 28-
23 come-from-behind win that few Cardi
nal players have forgotten. Stanford led
17-0 early, but suffered a barrage of
injuries during the game and ended up
falling to an early 0-2 record. The revenge
factor is in effect.
"This game is one of the biggest of the
year for me, especially considering last
season's loss. Everyone's really fired up
and ready to play Arizona," said offensive
guard Brian Cassidy.
Not that Walsh would have been wor

ried about a drop in intensity, anyway.
Walsh has praised the maturity of his
senior-laden team all season long, and
seems assured that the mark of the 1992
Cardinal, in contrast to year's past, will be
week-to-week consistency.
Saturday's contest should typify play
in this year's Pac-10. To this point, the
conference has been dominated by
defense; six of the 10 teams have defenses
rated in the nation's top 20, and that
doesn't even include No. 1 Washington's
always-ferocious squad. Stanford and Ari
zona — ranked fifth and sixth, respectful
ly — head that impressive defensive list.
The Cardinal defenders had one of
their best games against UCI*A. In addi
tion to allowing the Bruins only seven
points, they held them to an absurdly-low
negative four yards rushing and recorded

six sacks.
That performance left quite an impres
sion on Arizona coach Dick Tomey.
"The best defenses make it difficult for
you to run, so you're forced into pre
dictable passing situations ... then they
rush you hard. That's what Stanford
does," Tomey said.
"Stanford has the most experienced
team in the conference — there are very
few things they haven't seen. I'm
impressed with both their discipline and
intensity."
The Wildcat defense, led by defensive
linemen Rob Waldrop and Ty Parten, has
contributed to a turnover ratio (+l.B per
game) that ranks as the nation's best.
Both Waldrop and Parten have previously
garnered Pac-10 Player of the Week hon
ors.
