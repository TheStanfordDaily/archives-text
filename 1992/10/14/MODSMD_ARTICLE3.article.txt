# Helping hand or invasion of privacy? RFs get grades
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Whether it concerns a student's personal life, alco
hol usage or simply his or her grades, the University
maintains a strict policy of not notifying parents of
any problems their child may be experiencing.
But at the same time, Residential Education al
lows resident fellows to receive the grades of all stu
dents in their dorms, including those of the resident
assistants.
Junior Dana Weeks, a resident assistant in Roble,
found out for the first time during RA training that
RFs received the grades of upperclassmen as well as
freshmen. "None of [the RAs] really knew that RFs
received our grades," she said.
Senior Holly Estrada said she also did not realize
her RF receives her grades. "Part of me feels that is
an invasion of my privacy," she said.
Stanford's policy on student privacy is taken from

the Buckley Amendment, a federal law that defines
the restrictions on access to a student's education
record. The amendment, known officially as the Fam
ily Educational Rights and Privacy Act, is an amend
ment to the General Education Provisions Act.
The main act defines an educational record as any
thing "personally definable and maintained by the
university" — including grades.
According to the document itself, the rights to the
education record belong to the parents until a stu
dent becomes "eligible," that is, until the student
turns 18 or enters a postsecondary institution.
At that point, anyone who wants access to a stu
dent's records must have the student's written per
mission.
But University officials say the current policy nf
allowing RFs to receive grades is vital to supporting
students academically.
"We would be irresponsible if we did not have ways
to ensure students can succeed here," said Alice Sup

ton, director of Res Ed.
According to Supton, the apparent contradiction
between sending grades to a student's RF, but not his
or her parents, mainly has to do with the fact that
parents' expectations may differ from their child's.
"Courses, major, whether to undertake research,
what they do with their time — these are all student
decisions," Supton said. The University's policy is to
stand by the student who chooses to inform the par
ent , and to support the student if he or she has diffi
culty doing so, she said.
As for RFs, Supton said they participate in discus
sions that affect all students, such as the "quarter
system vs. the semester system" and "when to have
exams." Knowing how potential policy changes may
affect grades is crucial to effectively contributing to
such discussions, according to Supton.
Whether this University policy violates the letter
or the spirit of the Buckley Amendment is unclear,
and the legal issue is further obscured by the fact that

Stanford, as a private institution, may choose not to
abide by the rule.
But Stanford may risk losing Department of Edu
cation funds — which include research grants — if it
does not comply, Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said last spring, when the issue of student privacy
was raised in regard to substance-abuse problems.
"Grades can be a sign or symptom of what is going
on in the house," said Rich Holeton, RF for Rincona
da. "This is for both people doing well and not doing
well."
Since RFs see the personal side of a student's life,
they may be in a better position than an academic ad
viser to understand what trouble that student may
have, he added. "RFs are at the center of the advising
team."
Angela Rickford, Kimball RF and former residence
dean for Wilbur Hall, said grade reports can help RFs
predict problems.
"If, for example, we notice a
student in any given quarter has
three incompletes and one 4 C,' it
alerts us that there might be a
problem," she said.
Both Rickford and Holeton said
their role as RFs necessitates
keeping abreast of their residents'
academic health. Specifically, RFs
cite their responsibility to make
sure students are aware of aca
demic resources, tutoring and
other special kinds of help, and
explaining the rules regarding pro
bation to those who are unfamiliar
with the process.
Holeton sees these duties, and
receiving the grades, as a major part
of the general support network, pro
viding a safety net for students.
"The question is, 'does it really
hurt the majority?' " he said. "Is it
really an invasion of privacy to
have a helping hand available to a
minority of their classmates?"
Estrada said that if RFs truly
do take a student's grades and pro

vide positive assistance, then she
would not mind if RFs receive her
grades. However, she added, "I've
never heard of that happening, so
I'm kind of bothered by that."
She suggested that students
should have the option of deciding
to keep their grades confidential.
On the issue of confidentiality,
Res Ed officials said they ask RFs to
keep the grades confidential.
Although it has been both Rick
ford's and Holeton's experience
that RFs respect the confidentiality
of students' grades, Holeton said,
"RAs can get a general idea of how
the students are doing. They may
discuss trends — people who are
doing well and people who aren't."
"A lot of students put too much
emphasis on grades," Holeton
said. Neither he nor his wife,
Veronica, make "a big deal" about
grades. Instead, they express con
cern or give praise in private.
"I'm not going to come into the
lounge and say, 'Hey, way to go on
those straight A's,"' he said.
In spite of this, Estrada said
students should be aware of Res
Ed's policy. "Whether or not we
have an option, we have a right to
know," she said.

academic health. Specifically, RFs
cite their responsibility to make
sure students are aware of aca
demic resources, tutoring and
other special kinds of help, and
explaining the rules regarding pro
bation to those who are unfamiliar
with the process.
Holeton sees these duties, and
receiving the grades, as a major part
of the general support network, pro
viding a safety net for students.
"The question is, 'does it really
hurt the majority?' " he said. "Is it
really an invasion of privacy to
have a helping hand available to a
minority of their classmates?"
Estrada said that if RFs truly
do take a student's grades and pro

vide positive assistance, then she
would not mind if RFs receive her
grades. However, she added, "I've
never heard of that happening, so
I'm kind of bothered by that."
She suggested that students
should have the option of deciding
to keep their grades confidential.
On the issue of confidentiality,
Res Ed officials said they ask RFs to
keep the grades confidential.
Although it has been both Rick
ford's and Holeton's experience
that RFs respect the confidentiality
of students' grades, Holeton said,
"RAs can get a general idea of how
the students are doing. They may
discuss trends — people who are
doing well and people who aren't."
"A lot of students put too much
emphasis on grades," Holeton
said. Neither he nor his wife,
Veronica, make "a big deal" about
grades. Instead, they express con
cern or give praise in private.
"I'm not going to come into the
lounge and say, 'Hey, way to go on
those straight A's,"' he said.
In spite of this, Estrada said
students should be aware of Res
Ed's policy. "Whether or not we
have an option, we have a right to
know," she said.
Whether it concerns a student's personal life, alco
hol usage or simply his or her grades, the University
maintains a strict policy of not notifying parents of
any problems their child may be experiencing.
But at the same time, Residential Education al
lows resident fellows to receive the grades of all stu
dents in their dorms, including those of the resident
assistants.
Junior Dana Weeks, a resident assistant in Roble,
found out for the first time during RA training that
RFs received the grades of upperclassmen as well as
freshmen. "None of [the RAs] really knew that RFs
received our grades," she said.
Senior Holly Estrada said she also did not realize
her RF receives her grades. "Part of me feels that is
an invasion of my privacy," she said.
Stanford's policy on student privacy is taken from

the Buckley Amendment, a federal law that defines
the restrictions on access to a student's education
record. The amendment, known officially as the Fam
ily Educational Rights and Privacy Act, is an amend
ment to the General Education Provisions Act.
The main act defines an educational record as any
thing "personally definable and maintained by the
university" — including grades.
According to the document itself, the rights to the
education record belong to the parents until a stu
dent becomes "eligible," that is, until the student
turns 18 or enters a postsecondary institution.
At that point, anyone who wants access to a stu
dent's records must have the student's written per
mission.
But University officials say the current policy nf
allowing RFs to receive grades is vital to supporting
students academically.
"We would be irresponsible if we did not have ways
to ensure students can succeed here," said Alice Sup

ton, director of Res Ed.
According to Supton, the apparent contradiction
between sending grades to a student's RF, but not his
or her parents, mainly has to do with the fact that
parents' expectations may differ from their child's.
"Courses, major, whether to undertake research,
what they do with their time — these are all student
decisions," Supton said. The University's policy is to
stand by the student who chooses to inform the par
ent , and to support the student if he or she has diffi
culty doing so, she said.
As for RFs, Supton said they participate in discus
sions that affect all students, such as the "quarter
system vs. the semester system" and "when to have
exams." Knowing how potential policy changes may
affect grades is crucial to effectively contributing to
such discussions, according to Supton.
Whether this University policy violates the letter
or the spirit of the Buckley Amendment is unclear,
and the legal issue is further obscured by the fact that

Stanford, as a private institution, may choose not to
abide by the rule.
But Stanford may risk losing Department of Edu
cation funds — which include research grants — if it
does not comply, Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said last spring, when the issue of student privacy
was raised in regard to substance-abuse problems.
"Grades can be a sign or symptom of what is going
on in the house," said Rich Holeton, RF for Rincona
da. "This is for both people doing well and not doing
well."
Since RFs see the personal side of a student's life,
they may be in a better position than an academic ad
viser to understand what trouble that student may
have, he added. "RFs are at the center of the advising
team."
Angela Rickford, Kimball RF and former residence
dean for Wilbur Hall, said grade reports can help RFs
predict problems.
"If, for example, we notice a
student in any given quarter has
three incompletes and one 4 C,' it
alerts us that there might be a
problem," she said.
