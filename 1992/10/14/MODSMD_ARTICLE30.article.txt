# Stanford looks to rebound against Cal
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
A coach can learn a lot about a team
through how it responds to a big win or a
big loss. Stanford women's soccer coach
Berhane Andeberhan hopes today to do
just that, during the squad's 4 p.m. match
with California, only two days after Stan
ford was shut out by No. 1 North Carolina.
"I think they'll do well," he said. "It's a
disappointing loss but we don't need to
take it totally out of perspective or propor
tion."
Despite the emotional nature of the Tar
Heel contest, today's showdown is more
critical to the Cardinal's playoff hopes. Cal
and Stanford are two of several top-20
squads on the west coast battling for the
precious few bids to the 12-team NCAA
tournament.

"We must do well in the next few
games," Andeberhan said. "They are cru
cial to our season."
To come away with a win today, the
team must successfully navigate the men
tal straits of Scylla and Charybdis. On one
side is the danger of an emotional letdown
after the 5-0 loss. On the other side is the
possibility of players becoming too emo
tional â€” trying to beat Cal by turning up
their intensity higher than the Bears'.
"We've basically got to get our heads on
straight," Andeberhan said. "Hopefully,
the players can come out and not show too
much emotion but maintain intensity at a
stable level."
But he realizes that's easier said than
done.
"It would be easy if we could play every
game in a workman-like fashion," he said.
"But that wouldn't be soccer, it would be a

video game. What makes soccer so crazy
and so great is that you can't eliminate the
human element."
Ironically, the North Carolina loss may
help the Cardinal players find the emotion
al balance they seek. Stanford maintained
composure and played a controlled, even
game for the first 55 minutes of the con
test. Playing against top teams should
improve the Cardinal, a squad with only a
few juniors and seniors in starting roles.
"We did a lot of things well," Andeber
han said. "Keep in mind, they've been
putting people away in the first 10 min
utes. But we need to figure out what it
takes to stay with them for 90 minutes."
Early in the second half, the squad
began to crumble after North Carolina
notched its first goal. ,
"If they score, it shouldn't be a big sur
prise," Andeberhan said. "Same thing if we

score. But we just haven't played enough
games of that intensity to make it a habit."
Stanford won't face as tough an oppo
nent in Cal, but can't afford to let its guard
down against the Golden Bears. Though
Cal is in the midst of a three-game winless
streak, they recently tied highly-touted
Colorado College. With only a day to recov
er from the Tar Heels and prepare for Cal,
Andeberhan has kept the game plan sim
ple.
As he has done all year, he emphasized
position defense, a tight man-to-man
defense near the ball, combined with a zone
defense on the other side of the field. By
giving players away from the ball a cush
ion, the defense is unlikely to get burned
deep by one pass. It also insures that
almost every pass downfield must be made
under ever-increasing pressure from the
Cardinal defense.
