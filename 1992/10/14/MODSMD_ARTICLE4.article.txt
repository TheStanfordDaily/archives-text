## Boskin to step down as Bush's chief economist 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Stanford colleagues of chief White
House economist Michael Boskin defended
him after yesterday's reports that Presi
dent Bush will seek his resignation, saying
he had already decided to step down.
"It's a moot point. He quit before they
could fire him," Hoover Fellow Alvin
Rabushka said. "All I see here is the ship is
sinking and it's time to blame someone else."
Boskin — a Stanford economics profes
sor and Senior Fellow at the Hoover Insti
tution — has been chairman of Bush's
Council of Economic Advisers since 1988.
If re-elected, Bush plans to replace
Boskin, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
and Budget Director Richard Darman, ac
cording to a report by the Associated Press.
Many critics, particularly Republicans,

have blamed Boskin, Brady and Darman
for failing to persuade Bush to act forceful
ly enough to address the recession. They
also hold the three responsible for Bush's
infamous decision to raise taxes.
Hoover Senior Fellow Tom Moore, who
served on the council for almost four years
under President Ronald Reagan, said the
controversy wouldn't overshadow Boskin's
accomplishments. "I think the work will
stand on its own," he said.
There is "a lot of gossip" in Washington,
Moore added, but Boskin "did a very pro
fessional job."
Boskin did not return The Daily's phone
calls yesterday.
Economics Prof. John Taylor, a council
member from 1989 to 1991, also praised
Boskin, who is on leave from the Universi-
ty. "I know Stanford would like
him to return," Taylor said. "I
don't know if he has made up his
mind. I don't think that he has."
But Boskin has made it clear
that he will be leaving Washington
at the end of Bush's term, Taylor
said.
He speculated that yesterday's
reports are a result of Bush's
efforts to give Chief of Staff James
Baker a greater role in domestic
policy. Making Baker his key eco
nomics official "takes some shift
ing around," he said.
And Boskin has already outlast
ed many of his predecessors, said
Moore, who worked with him in
the White House for three months
in 1988. "Very few chairmen serve
longer than four years."
"It's a grueling job," he added,
describing the frequent 12-hour
workdays. "You're on the run all
the time. ... It takes it out of you."
While Moore said he did not
want to comment on the current
situation, he explained that the

chairman attends Cabinet meet
ings, advises the president on eco-

nomic matters
and oversees the
two other council
members and
about 20 profes
sional economist
staffers.
For example,
the chairman will
get the employ
ment statistics

the night before they are publicly
released and explain them to the
president so he can answer ques
tions the next day.
According to Taylor, "His pri
mary responsibility is to give objec
tive advice on the economy to the
president."
Boskin, a self-described "main
stream conservative," advised
Bush during his campaign and was
the primary architect of Bush's
"flexible freeze" proposal to reduce
the federal deficit.
He has also served as am eco
nomics consultant to Reagan, the
Treasury Department, the Senate
majority leader and members of
both parties in both houses of
Congress.
