# Scud stud?
## Student swaps F-15 for LSAT

Until he crossed the Iraqi border in his F-15C
fighter for the first time, the possibility of dying in
the Persian Gulf War didn't seem real to Tom Gem
mell.
"I don't know if I'm going to come home," the
first-year law student and former Air Force captain
remembers thinking to himself suddenly.
Beginning early in the war's first day, Gemmell
faced dangers from surface-to-air missiles to enemy
planes, as ho targeted command facilities and Scud
Missile sites in Baghdad and western Iraq.
In the following five weeks, he flew up to three
missions daily, narrowly evaded missile attacks and
tried to steal a few precious hours of sleep between
air raids.
He saw a Scud hit his base and kill 28 people. He
watched from the air as ground troops moved in on
the Republican Guard. And he lost a good friend
from college.
All alone on a mission, Gemmell said he would
look up at the Milky Way or see the snow glistening
on Iran's huge mountain ranges.
Then he'd wonder how anything could seem so
beautiful in the middle of a war.
