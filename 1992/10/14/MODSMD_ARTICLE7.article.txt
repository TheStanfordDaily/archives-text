# Scud stud?
## Student swaps F-15 for LSAT 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Until he crossed the Iraqi border in his F-15C
fighter for the first time, the possibility of dying in
the Persian Gulf War didn't seem real to Tom Gem
mell.
"I don't know if I'm going to come home," the
first-year law student and former Air Force captain
remembers thinking to himself suddenly.
Beginning early in the war's first day, Gemmell
faced dangers from surface-to-air missiles to enemy
planes, as ho targeted command facilities and Scud
Missile sites in Baghdad and western Iraq.
In the following five weeks, he flew up to three
missions daily, narrowly evaded missile attacks and
tried to steal a few precious hours of sleep between
air raids.
He saw a Scud hit his base and kill 28 people. He
watched from the air as ground troops moved in on
the Republican Guard. And he lost a good friend
from college.
All alone on a mission, Gemmell said he would
look up at the Milky Way or see the snow glistening
on Iran's huge mountain ranges.
Then he'd wonder how anything could seem so
beautiful in the middle of a war.
Years of experience
The son of an Air Force pilot
who flew in three wars, Gemmell
joined ROTC in his sophomore
year at the University of Colorado.
"In general, I'm just a really
patriotic person," he said. "I'm
very into God and Country and all
of that."
While friends from his private
boarding school were going on to
become lawyers and investment
bankers, Gemmell won a spot in an
elite pilot training program.
He was one of 40 Americans
selected to work with the best
fighter pilot candidates from all of
the NATO countries. After 14
months in the program — a mix of
academics and flight training — he
graduated at the top of his class.
On his "dream sheet" he asked
for the F-15C — a $35 million
plane that can accelerate straight
up and fly 2.5 times the speed of
sound. The world's premier jet,
"its mission is basically to kill
other fighters," he said.
"Basically, nothing else in the
world can compete against it,"
Gemmell added, noting that an F
-15C has never been shot down.
While the plane's cost gives him
a sense of "power and responsibili
ty," he said he doesn't think about
it while he's in the air. "You think
of [the plane] as an extension of
your body in aerial combat. .. . It's
a joy to fly."
During his subsequent training
and service in Japan and Virginia,
he and other pilots were preparing
to fight the Soviet Union. But as
the Soviet Union started to col
lapse, plans involving Iran and
Iraq began to arise instead.
So when he was called in to
work an hour early on the morning
of Aug. 2, 1990 and told Iraq had
invaded Kuwait, Gemmell said he
was not really surprised.
'Ready to kick some ass'
"Initially, they picked eight of
us [from the squadron] out and
told us to pack our bags," he said,
describing the pilots as "really
psyched."
"We were ready to go kick some
ass," Gemmell remembered. Such
enthusiasm about the possibility of
war "sounds cynical, but that's
what we were trained to do."

It wasn't until five days of wait
ing by the telephone that the pilots
actually "got the word to go," he
said. Two squadrons from Langley
Air Force Base deployed immedi
ately, flying 14.3 hours with seven
mid-air refuelings on the way to
Saudi Arabia.
During the almost six months
before the air war began, Gemmell
and the others took turns
patrolling the Iraqi border.
"We had orders to shoot any
thing that came across the border,"
he said. "But we were told we had to
make sure the wreckage fell on the
Saudi side for political reasons."

'I could see tons of
missiles hitting Iraqis
below us. Iraqis were
going all over the
place like ants.'

When they weren't flying, the
pilots were preparing to go to war.
Gemmell, a mission commander,
worked on plans in case the negoti
ations failed.
"The worst time was waiting,"
he said. "We were all praying the
negotiations would work. None of
us wanted to have our buddies die
or to be shot at."
The waiting ends
Finally, the pilots were told to
be ready to fight in three days —
Jan. 17 — if talks broke down.
There would be no moon that
night, making conditions ideal.
Gemmell was part of the third
wave to enter enemy territory. As
he waited for word about the sta
tus of the first planes into Iraq, "it
was very tough to sleep," he said.
"I knew when they were going to
[meet] the air refueling tanker and
were going to be in the target area."
Then it was his turn. Gemmell
said he was more worried about
the men he led than himself
because "they had families and
children," he said. Fortunately,
none of the planes was lost.
Besides dealing with the possi
bility of dying, Gemmell had to
come to terms with killing others.
"You never really feel comfortable
thinking about that," he said. "You
have to look out for yourself, your
flight and the entire strike force.
"You may go to sleep with a

lump in your throat, but you have
to block it out when you are in the
air. A lapse in your concentration
could be deadly."
Each day he would fly from one
to three missions, such as eight
hour combat air patrols or two or
three hour escorts and pre-strike
sweep missions. "I mainly flew
Icombat air patrolsl between
Baghdad and Iran" to deny Iraq
access to Iran, he said.
Exhaustion set in as the war
continued. When he wasn't flying,
he was often "on alert," ready to go
on a moment's notice.
"On alert you had to sleep in
your G-suit," he said, explaining
that afler the horns went off, "You
had to be airborne in four minutes."
He shared one tiny room with
nine other pilots, some of whom
flew day missions while he flew
nights.
After two weeks, the pilots were
so worn out that others were
brought over from the United
States to lighten the load. "It was
the most tired I've ever been,"he
said.
Scud attacks added to the sleep
lessness. "We usually got attacked
every morning between 2 and 5,"
Gemmell said. One missile barely
missed the bunkers, leaving "a
huge crater and twisted metal
everywhere."
Eventually, though, the attacks
became routine enough that Gem
mell would put on his gas mask
and try to go back to sleep.
But he was outside the night a
missile hit the Army barracks
north of Dhahran, killing 28 peo
ple.
"I saw that one hit," Gemmell
said. "There were no sirens, no
Patriots. We grabbed our stuff and
went into the shelter, but just
before going in I saw it glowing as
it re-entered. Nothing launched,
and somebody, I knew, died."
Another time, he was at the end
of the runway getting ready to take
off when Patriots started launch
ing. In the air, Gemmell said, he
watched as "Scuds were being
intercepted all around me. It was
the coolest light show."
Another light show resulted
from the fires in Kuwait's oil
fields. The huge black clouds gen
erated by the burning oil were dis
gusting, he said. "It would shut
down the sun.
"The whole country was on
fire," Gemmell continued. At
night, the flames looked like "a
thousand candles — it was almost

beautiful."
Facing danger
Gemmell said he was only shot
at once by another aircraft, which
was quickly "killed" by someone
else. But he did have several close
calls.
On one occasion just east of
Baghdad, he was "locked up" — or
targeted by Iraqi radar — by SA-2
surface-to-air missiles. "As soon as
I got locked up, I saw three of them
coming at me through the clouds,"
he said.

'Not one of us wanted
to be there. No one
wanted to kill people
or see our friends get
killed.'

Gemmell dumped aluminum
particles called "chaff" from his
plane to confuse the missiles, then
rolled over and pulled his jet under
the missiles so they missed him
completely.
Another encounter came after
the start of the ground war. During
the first big ground push, Gemmell
said, he was responsible for pro
tecting the American troops and
their support aircraft from the air.

The sun was just about to set,
and he said he felt very distant
from the fighting below him. "It
was kind of surreal," he said. "I
could see tons of missiles hitting
Iraqis below us. Iraqis were going
all over the place like ants.
"It was kind of like watching a
video game more than anything
else."
Gemmell was flying a mission
north of Baghdad when he got a
call to come home. "They told me
there had been a cease-fire," he
recalled. "I was elated."
But the war's end also brought
some bad news. Gemmell discov
ered that a friend from ROTC had
been killed while flying an F-16 on
a bombing mission the first few
days into the war.
Although he had heard about
the incident earlier, he didn't
know who the pilot was. "I didn't
know it was Mike until the end,"
he said. "He was one of my pro
teges. I was Corps commander and
he was two years younger."
'Awesome' homecoming
First to reach Saudi Arabia,
Gemmell's unit was also the first
to come home.
"It was awesome," he said. A
crowd of 50,000 — including sena
tors, half a dozen four-star gener
als and the secretary of the Air
Force — braved 10-degree weather
to welcome the pilots home.
"I was almost embarrassed,"

Gemmell said. "It was very, very
emotional. They treated us as
incredible heroes."
He also fondly remembered the
support he received from home
before and during the war. "Some
times I would get 10 to 15 letters a
day from friends and strangers,"
he said. "Their support would
almost make you cry."
The pilots received banners,
flowers arid cookies, he said. But
they also got a few letters calling
them "warmongers."
"They have no idea," Gemmell
said angrily. "Noi one of us wanted
to be there. No one wanted to kill
people or see our friends get killed."
Being home was wonderful, he
said. Problems seemed insignifi
cant compared to being at war. "I
almost welcomed the fact that I
could be in a traffic jam again,"
Gemmell said.
Gemmell left the Air Force in
June to enroll at the Law School. He
said he misses flying, even dreaming
about it sometimes. He hopes to fly
for the Reserves or National Guard
while practicing law.
He also misses the friends he
made. "There's a bond between
the guys who flew in the war that
you'll never, ever forget," Gem
mell said.
From the war, he says he
learned one important lesson: "You
don't realize what you have until
there is the possibility that you're
never going to have it again."
