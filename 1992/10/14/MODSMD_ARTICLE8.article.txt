# 'Miracle' drug in the making
## 
### Jennifer Cho 
After two years of intense
work, Stanford researchers are
tantalizingly close to the total
synthesis of a cancer-fighting
drug known as taxol.
Only minute amounts of
taxol exist, but tens of thou
sands of patients could benefit
from its application. If success
ful in reproducing and improv
ing upon natural taxol, Stan
ford will have cleared the way
for producing large amounts of
this "miracle" drug.
Derived from the bark and
needles of the rare Pacific yew
tree, Taxus brevifolia, of the
Pacific Northwest, taxol has
been shown in clinical trials to
cause tumor shrinkage in more
than 30 percent of ovarian can
cer patients. It also shows
promise of greater effective
ness when used with other
standard anti-cancer agents.
By interfering with the as
sembly and disassembly of the
cancer cells' microtubles, taxol
inhibits the cells' rapid division
and ultimately slows tumor
growth.
The water-insoluble drug,
however, can only be obtained
at high cost — not only in terms
of money, but also in time and
environmental costs. Three or
more yew trees from old-growth
forests are needed to treat a sin
gle patient. Thus only a few pa
tients have access to the drug.
In addition, plant-derived
taxol causes side effects, includ
ing hair loss, nerve damage,
gastrointestinal problems and a
weakened immune system
In order to offer a more fea
sible alternative to taxol, re
searchers around the country
have been attempting to syn
thesize the drug with the finan
cial support of the National
Cancer Institute.

Dr. Tony Shuker holds a molecular model of the rare cancer-fighting drug taxol, de
rived from the Pacific yew tree. A Stanford team is just atoms away from synthsizing
the complete molecule.
Wender may become the first laboratory to success
fully synthesize the molecule.
Taxol contains a three-ring core, with several side
chains. By manipulating pinene, an inexpensive sub
stance derived from pine trees, Wender's lab man
aged to synthesize taxol's core last April.
Now, six months later, the lab has managed to
attach almost all of the remaining side chains.
With only a methyl group, a hydroxyl group and
an oxetane left to add, Wender described the work
remaining as minor.
"We know how to solve the problem," he said.
"It's just a question of applying the knowledge we
have. It is conceivable that we might be within weeks
of a first generation taxol. It's a very exciting time."
Wender outlined his lab's goals over the past two
years and for the future. "In 1991 we used our
resources to explore the options [for synthesizing
taxol]. One could liken this to settling the western
frontier. There were several paths one could take to
reach the West Coast, but which pass would be the
best way through?" Eventually the group picked
pinene as its starting point for synthesis.
"1992 was committed to the process of conver-

taxol. It's a very exciting time.'

gence, of taking the best pathway and 'going to the
coast.'"
Wender hopes that in 1993, he and the graduate
students working on the project will be able to refine
taxol, developing an inexpensive and commercially
reproducible process to make second generation
"taxol analogues that could be even better than
taxol." If they succeed, the drug will become avail
able to the tens of thousands of patients who do not
presently receive it.
The lab plans to modify taxol's natural form to
make it easier to synthesize, free of side effects and
soluble in water to facilitate clinical use of the drug.
"For it to be a success, it has to be better than all oth
ers," he said, describing their goals as an "evolving
standard."
"We are not constrained by the dictates of biologi
cal processes," Wender said of their hopes to improve
on natural taxol. "Our only constraints are cost and
practicality."
Wender said there was a direct relationship
between the work being done with taxol with that of
penicillin. Since its discovery, researchers and clini
cians have been modifying penicillin to make it more
potent, more effective and more easily produced.
"The penicillins of today can be compared to the tax
ols of the future," Wender added.
Although Wender is recognized as the leader of
the taxol research group at Stanford, he is quick to
recognize the long, hard hours put in by graduate
students in the lab. Sometimes working 16- to 18-
hour days, Wender said these researchers are "inspi
rational" to him.
"They are in there in the wee hours of the morn
ing, working by themselves, with no one cheering
them on. There is a lot of pride, determination, and
dedication," he said, adding that this group of people,
some with families outside the lab, was a "Dream
Team."
Another group of Wender's "heroes" are the peo
ple who are directly affected by cancer.
"To be with the people who are benefitting from the
drug and to understand how people are dealing with
this in a very constructive way is incredible," he said.
The importance of their support is evident
through the display of words of encouragement from
cancer patients in the lab.
Wender and his group of researchers are opti
mistic for their chances for success, but realize that
they have a long road in front of them. Wender
added, "It's just the start of a long, exciting evolution
to treat cancers."
