# 'Miracle' drug in the making

### Jennifer Cho 
After two years of intense
work, Stanford researchers are
tantalizingly close to the total
synthesis of a cancer-fighting
drug known as taxol.
Only minute amounts of
taxol exist, but tens of thou
sands of patients could benefit
from its application. If success
ful in reproducing and improv
ing upon natural taxol, Stan
ford will have cleared the way
for producing large amounts of
this "miracle" drug.
Derived from the bark and
needles of the rare Pacific yew
tree, Taxus brevifolia, of the
Pacific Northwest, taxol has
been shown in clinical trials to
cause tumor shrinkage in more
than 30 percent of ovarian can
cer patients. It also shows
promise of greater effective
ness when used with other
standard anti-cancer agents.
By interfering with the as
sembly and disassembly of the
cancer cells' microtubles, taxol
inhibits the cells' rapid division
and ultimately slows tumor
growth.
The water-insoluble drug,
however, can only be obtained
at high cost â€” not only in terms
of money, but also in time and
environmental costs. Three or
more yew trees from old-growth
forests are needed to treat a sin
gle patient. Thus only a few pa
tients have access to the drug.
In addition, plant-derived
taxol causes side effects, includ
ing hair loss, nerve damage,
gastrointestinal problems and a
weakened immune system
In order to offer a more fea
sible alternative to taxol, re
searchers around the country
have been attempting to syn
thesize the drug with the finan
cial support of the National
Cancer Institute.

the complete molecule.
