# NOW president plugs female candidates

### Colleen Krueger 
Patricia Ireland, president of
the National Organization for
Women, addressed a crowd of
about 250 yesterday in White
Plaza, urging women to become
"part of the momentum that is
sweeping the country for
change."
The noontime rally, part of
NOW's "Elect Women for a
Change" campaign, was co-spon
sored by the National Women's
Political Caucus of Stanford,
Students for Environmental Ac
tion at Stanford and the
Women's Center.
Ireland began by applauding
the "tremendous progress" of
women in the last 20 years, but
quickly reminded listeners that
such changes are "not inevitable
and not irreversible."
Relating the stories of several
female candidates across the
country, Ireland noted the "un
precedented numbers of
women" running for elected of
fice, while stressing that the ulti
mate decision rests in the hands
of voters.
Ireland used the occasion of
the first anniversary of the
Clarence Thomas hearings to re
mind the crowd of the "virtual
exclusion of women from the
highest levels of society."
"When you exclude the expe
rience of half the population, you
exclude the rich diversity of our
country," Ireland said.
Opening her brief speech, Ire
land reminisced about her own
college experience.
"When I was becoming an
adult, people still argued with
me about equal pay for equal
work," she said.
Ireland also took the opportu
nity to touch on the controversial
issue of Columbus Day, endorse

racially diverse candidates, and
define feminism as "the radical
notion that women are people."
In an often comic speech, Ire
land consciously dismissed the
idea that "feminists have no
sense of humor."
To the cheers of her audience,
Ireland scorned the idea that
women in politics is a new or re
actionary phenomenon, saying,
"I don't ever want to hear the
phrase 'Year of the Woman.'
"You can be a part of the mo
mentum that is sweeping the
country for change," Ireland
urged. "We began this century
by winning the right to vote.
Let's end this century by gaining
real political power."
Ireland was joined by Anna
Eshoo, the Democratic candidate
for California's 14th Congres
sional District, which includes
Stanford, Palo Alto and Menlo
Park.
Eshoo praised Stanford, say
ing it has "led on issues that
have shaped our country."
Asserting the need for an "ex
panded economy," Eshoo specifi
cally appealed to students with her
economic goal "that you (Stanford
graduates) will be able to find a
job, along with everyone else."
At one point, Eshoo seemed to
misspeak, nearly substituting
"Yale"for "Stanford." But the
candidate's reference to "black,"
"brown" and "yellow" people
seemed to unsettle listeners
much more.
Event organizer Britt
Wahlin, a sophomore, said she
hoped the rally would "educate
voters to why we need women in
office."
"Patricia Ireland and Anna
Eshoo are intelligent, articulate
women, and exposure to their
ideas can only help to stimulate
voters," Wahlin said.
