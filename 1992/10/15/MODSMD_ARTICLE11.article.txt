# Libertarians appeal for votes
## Party nominees criticize the two major parties 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
The Libertarian candidates
for U.S. Senate in California
and the 14th Congressional Dis
trict attacked the policies of the
two dominant political parties
last night.
The gathering in Tresidder
Union, hosted by the Stanford
Libertarians, attracted about 80
people.
The main speaker was
Richard Boddie, the Libertarian

candidate for the two-year
"short seat" currently occupied
by Sen. John Seymour, R-Calif.
After beginning with Mark
Antony's famous call to the peo
ple, Boddie said, "I come to bury
power, not seize [itJ."
Boddie accused the govern
ment of taking taxes, stealing
the freedoms of middle class
Americans, establishing quotas
and supporting the bailout of
the Savings and Loan industry,
among other things.
He also singled out the
Republicans and Democrats for
the rights of Americans, com
paring the dominant political
parties to abusive parents.
Though he did not touch
upon specific issues within his
brief speech, Boddie encouraged
the audience to see Libertarian
viewpoint.
"Each individual human
being is a majority of one," he
said, arguing that every person
has the power to change the sta
tus quo.
During his speech, Boddie
quoted Bob Dylan, mimicked
independent presidential candi
date Ross Perot supported

Tom Sawyer's views on educa
tion.
Also speaking was the Liber
tarian nominee for the six-year
"long-seat" U.S. Senate, June
Genis.
The San Mateo County com
puter programmer explained
that she entered the race as a
protest candidate because vot
ers were only offered a choice
between a big spending liberal
and an anti-choice politician.
"I did not want people to
have to choose between the less
er of two evils," she said.
She went on to declare that
"there is only one political party
left committed to let you live
your own life. That's the Liber
tarian Party."
Genis also promised to cut
the defense budget by 10 per
cent every year for the next five
years.
The Libertarian candidate

for the 14th Congressional Dis
trict, Chuck Olson, also made a
short speech. The district
includes Stanford, Palo Alto and
Menlo Park.
Olson, who has a master's in
biology from Stanford, advocat
ed a reduction of government
spending as opposed to a tax cut.
He argued the government's
sole responsibility was to pro
tect justice and nothing more.
Olson also stressed that U.S.
foreign policy must be redefined in
support of non-interventionism.
"If we served as an example
to all the nations of the world,
and they all followed us, we
would have I military 1 bases
everywhere," he said.
Hoover Fellow William Evers
served as the master of cere
monies for the evening. He
dubbed the Libertarians as "a
lobbying organization for your
life,.liberty and property."
