Tax and trickle explained
NEW YORK (AP) â€” In the vice-presidential
debate, A 1 Gore accused his Republican opponents
of practicing "trickle down" economics, while
Quayle scorned what he called Democratic "tax
and spend" proposals.
These phrases have become stock invectives
used by both parties to persuade voters of the
danger of the other candidate's economic policies.
But what do the phrases really mean?
Both phrases are derogatory caricatures of
political philosophies and policies that actually
exist. They appear to have been thought up by the
administration of President Franklin D. Roo
sevelt, whose New Deal government-spending
programs popularized the modern-day tax and
spend philosophy.
Harry L. Hopkins, administrator of Roosevelt's
Work Progress Administration, summed up the
New Deal philosophy this way: "We shall tax and
tax, and spend and spend, and elect and elect."
The tax-and-spend philosophy says that the
government must intervene to redistribute the
wealth. It does this by spending government
money on entitlement programs such as Social
Security, welfare and public works.

But critics say the government cannot be trust
ed to spend taxpayers' money wisely. They fear
government will keep raising taxes to support its
own bloated bureaucracies.
Trickle-down theory, on the other hand, became
popular in the last half of the nineteenth century in
England and Scotland, and holds that tax cuts for
the wealthy will encourage investment and eventu
ally work through the economy to help everyone.
Trickle-down proponents say government
should get out of the way, because private invest
ment will create the most wealth for the greatest
number of people.
John Kenneth Galbraith, professor emeritus of
economics at Harvard University, scorned trickle
down as the possibly accurate but unappetizing
notion that "if you feed the horse enough oats some
will pass through to the road for the sparrows."
In fact, there is very little evidence that Repub
licans have hewn to trickle down policies and
Democrats to tax and spend.
"The interesting fact is it doesn't matter who's
in the White House," said Sam Peltzman, profes
sor of economics at the University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business. "There's no sys
tematic tendency for Democrats to spend more
than Republicans."
