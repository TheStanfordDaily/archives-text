Luby's massacre remembered
KILLEEN, Texas (AP) â€” John Marr can still
see the bodies.
He points to the front of Luby's newly-remod
eled cafeteria and says in a measured voice,
"There was a woman at a table up there, still sit
ting, dead."
A year has gone by since the nation's deadliest
mass shooting, and the words of the massacre's
survivors seem almost eerily calm in the retelling.
At lunchtime on Oct. 16, 1991, a man named
George Hennard smashed his pickup through the
front window and emptied and re-emptied two
semiautomatic weapons, a Glock 9mm and a
Ruger. Of more than 40 people hit, 23 died. The
ex-merchant seaman then killed himself, leaving
behind no explanations.
To remember the dead, church bells will toll at
noon tomorrow and Luby's will close in the after
noon. A group of survivors has organized an
evening candlelight ceremony.
Hazel Holley, 71, who broke her arm escaping
through a broken window, refuses to say Hen
nard's name but says"I have never felt any anger
toward that man, only pity. My sympathy goes to
his family."
Marr is less charitable.
"I'm glad he's dead," he said. "I tend to think

people get what they deserve and he got what he
deserved."
Study: Keep drinking Jolt
Here's another jolt for java junkies: Even those
who drink just two or three cups a day may feel
depressed, anxious, sluggish and headachy if they
suddenly give up their caffeine fix, a study shows.
Experts have long recognized that heavy users
may feel out of sorts if they go cold turkey. But the
new work suggests that the millions of Americans
who consume moderate amounts of coffee, tea or
caffeinated soda may also feel not quite themselves
if they miss their daily fix.
In fact, for some, giving up caffeine can trigger
sick-in-bed symptoms worse than the flu.
"We showed a severe withdrawal syndrome at
the usual dietary doses of caffeine," said Dr.
Roland R. Griffiths, senior author of the Johns
Hopkins University study.
The symptoms reach their worst after a day or
two and then usually taper off within a week. Peo
ple who want to give up their caffeine-laced drinks
can do so painlessly simply by gradually cutting
back over a few days.
But Griffiths said his work does not imply that
caffeine is unhealthy. "It's not bad as long as you
keep taking it,"he said.
