NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -
Former hostages Joseph Cicippio
and David Jacobsen sued Iran for
$600 million yesterday, saying the
country orchestrated their abduc
tions in an effort to recover mil
lions of dollars frozen in the Unit
ed States.
Iran was guilty of "commercial
terrorism for profit," said their
lawyer James J. Oliver, and
because the money was held in the
United States, Iran cannot claim
sovereign immunity.
The two former hostages said
no amount of money can compen
sate for their imprisonment. They
said they would share any money
gained with other former hostages
and families of slain hostages.
"The people who harmed them,
and other evil people who are think
ing of harming, have to be told that
if there is not a criminal or military
response, there is going to be a civil

response," said Jacobsen.
Cicippio said, "This is to pre
vent it from happening again, by
hitting them in the pocket."
Jacobsen, 61, of Huntington
Beach, Calif., was director of the
American University Hospital in
Beirut when he was taken hostage
May 28, 1985, and held for 532
days.
Cicippio, 62, was deputy
comptroller of American Universi
ty in Beirut when he was abducted
Sept. 12, 1986, and held for 1,908
days. His wife, Elham, a Lebanese
national, is also a plaintiff. They
live in Princeton, N.J.
The lawsuit says Iran directed
the kidnappings in Beirut so it
could gain leverage in efforts to
free Iranian assets held in the
United States by helping negotiate
the hostages' release. The assets
were frozen after the U.S. embassy
in Tehran was taken over in 1979

and its American staff held captive.
The lawsuit seeks damages for
kidnapping, physical abuse, false
imprisonment, inhumane medical
treatment, loss of job opportuni
ties, and pain and suffering.
Oliver said evidence from the
State Department and other offi
cials "clearly shows a pattern
between the return of money to
Iran and the release of the
hostages."
Bush administration officials
have said Iran paid for the
hostages' imprisonment and paid
the captors $2 million for each
hostage released.
Jacobsen said a letter he
received in July from the State
Department told him the United
States froze nearly $10 billion in
Iranian assets after the 1979
embassy takeover, about $9 billion
of which has since gone to bank
claims or been returned to Iran.
