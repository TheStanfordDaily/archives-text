MOSCOW (AP) - Boris
Yeltsin's Russian government
blocked former Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev from dashing
out to Italy on a public-speaking
trip yesterday, standing firm on its
decision to restrict the former
leader's travel abroad.
Gorbachev had been due to
meet Italian leaders, Pope John
Paul 11, business people and jour
nalists in Italy.
Italian Premier Giuliano Amato
criticized the decision in a meeting
with the Russian ambassador. A
statement from his office said the
move was "incompatible with the
process of democratization under
way in Russia."
It was unclear whether the

issue would affect Russia's ties
with Italy, a country which has
provided badly needed economic
aid to Moscow.
The hassle arises from Gor
bachev's refusal to testify in a trial
on the legality of Yeltsin's ban of
the Communist Party. Gorbachev
calls the trial a farce. Upon court
request, Russian officials revoked
his foreign travel passport — a life
line for the man who has traveled
constantly since resigning last
December — until he appears in
court.
Under pressure from foreign
governments, Yeltsin asked the
court Tuesday to let Gorbachev go
to Germany on Saturday for the
funeral of former Chancellor Willy

Brandt. Authorities gave back
Gorbachev's passport, asking him
to use it only for Germany.
But Gorbachev insisted he also
would use it for his scheduled trip
to Italy yesterday. Russian officials
withheld the document until after
commercial flights to Italy had left.
"(This) represents abuse of
power on the part of the authori
ties," said a statement released by
his private think tank, the Gor
bachev Foundation.
The statement from the Gor
bachev side yesterday said he
hoped to reschedule the Italy trip
as soon as possible, and expressed
Gorbachev's "heartfelt gratitude
to all those who supported him in
this hard time."
