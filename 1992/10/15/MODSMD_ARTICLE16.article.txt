# Summit on Silicon brain drain

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -
America must embrace the world's
newest revolution — the knowl
edge revolution — or be relegated
to the economic dustbin, futurist
Alvin Toffler cautioned Silicon
Valley business and community
leaders yesterday.
"Silicon Valley and what it rep
resents is crucial to the 21st centu
ry economy of the whole world,"
said Toffler, who wrote the 1970
best-seller "Future Shock."
Toffler spoke during a confer
ence attended by several hundred
executives, academics and govern
ment officials billed as a high-tech
summit to discuss the future of
Silicon Valley.
The region, once the ultimate
high-technology area, has in recent

years seen the flight of factories
and jobs as manufacturers left for
cheaper, higher quality-of-life
areas in other states and overseas.
Dozens of leaders of companies
such as Intel, Amdahl and Hewlett-
Packard, as well as officials for
local universities and local govern
ments, have created a group called
Joint Venture: Silicon Valley.
Their goal, group leaders say, is
to work together to stop the flow of
trained workers and investment
out of the region to places like
Austin, Texas, Salt Lake City, Sin
gapore and Malaysia.
"It's competitive. Global com
petition is getting tougher and
tougher," said Winston H. Chen,
chairman of Solectron, a $400 mil
lion-a-year Milpitas printer cir

cuit-board manufacturer.
Kenneth Courtis, an economic
strategist with Deutsche Bank
Group in Asia, said a huge new
market is on the verge of opening
across Asia, especially in parts of
China, and American companies
need to be able to move in quickly.
"The attitude is: 'Let's move.
Let's make a deal,'" he said.
Organizers of the forum at
Santa Clara University said Sili
con Valley can again lead the world
if companies and government cre
ate a new cooperative relationship.
"The Silicon Valley is known as
the cutting edge — the first window
to the future," said Tom Hayes,
who chairs Joint Venture: Silicon
Valley. "What's happening here will
ripple through the rest of society."
