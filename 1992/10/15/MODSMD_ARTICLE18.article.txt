READIN', 'RITIN' AND
'rithmetic may be taught to
the tune of a hickory stick,
as the old song goes. But ethics,
character and morality seem to be
monitored with a velvet glove.
When the Stanford Judicial
Council decided last spring to with
hold for two years the degree of
Stuart Thomas, the senior who was
investigated on charges of sexual
assault last year pleading no con
test to charges of statutory rape in
Santa Clara County Superior
Court, they sent a clear message to
the campus community.
But the message was more an
asthmatic wheeze than a blistering
bellow. By failing to withhold
entirely the degree of such a stu
dent, who has clearly violated the
Fundamental Standard, Universi
ty officials have rendered the hal
lowed code meaningless.
A Stanford diploma is granted
with the expectation that the grad
uate has upheld and will continue
to uphold certain standards of
character, citizenship and ethics.

The following is the dissenting opin
ion of three editorial board members.

WHILE FEW WOULD DENY
Stuart Thomas' behavior
last year was an insult to the
Stanford community and worthy of
great condemnation, the University
overstepped its bounds in delaying
his degree for two years.
In cases in which personal mis
conduct and academic achieve
ment are related — such as when a
student cheats on an exam — the
University is right to withdraw
credit or apply suspensions.
For the most part, though, stu
dents' academic achievement is com
pletely unrelated to instances of per
sonal misconduct. A mistake in one's
personal life should not be paid for
by the negation of academic accom
plishments which were neither
inspired by, reflective of nor depen
dent upon the conduct in question.
The University should not con-

These expectations are built into
the Stanford system in the form of
the Fundamental Standard, which
supposedly governs student behav
ior. But why bother to have a stan
dard at all if it's only going to be
enforced halfheartedly?
A Stanford degree implies far
more than the mere completion of
academic units. Indeed, starting with
the admission process, Stanford
emphasizes much more than grades:
an overriding emphasis is placed on
admitting well-rounded people who
excel in a variety of areas, including
citizenship.
Were Stanford to deny admission
to a high school student who had
been convicted of statutory rape
under conditions like Thomas, few
would contest the judgment. It fol
lows that if an admitted student
later commits a crime that the Uni
versity community finds deplorable,
the school has the right and the obli
gation to rescind the degree.
An honor code that isn't hon
ored has all the impact of speaking
softly without a big stick.

fuse distributing a diploma with
certifying a recipient's honesty,
integrity or good behavior. If that
were the case, the University
would have to establish a whole
office devoted entirely to the
delaying of degrees. A diploma is a
mark of academic achievement —
no more, no less.
Furthermore, it seems illogical
that if Judicial Affairs feels Stuart
Thomas is currently unworthy of
his diploma, they feel he should
ever receive it. The passage of two
years certainly should not make his
actions any more acceptable. The
logic at work is the inevitable result
of attempting to apply an academic
penalty to an unrelated incident.
Stuart Thomas has received his
punishment from the criminal jus
tice system. Although the Universi
ty is understandably eager to voice
its disapproval of him, to delay his
degree for two years is an inappro
priate and arbitrary penalty.
