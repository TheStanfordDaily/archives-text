In a time of few options, Clinton's the least of three evils

ALL OF US HAVE BEEN barraged
during the past year with informa
tion from various perspectives, all
claiming to aid us in that difficult deci
sion — who to vote into the presidency
in November.
After wading through too much of it,
I have concluded that I would not even
consider voting for Howdy Doody — I
mean Ross Perot.
So, like most Americans, I am left
with three serious choices.
I can choose not to vote.
I would not even consider not voting
— too many people have been verbally
harassed and physically brutalized in
this country, so that I might exercise
this right, for me not to cast my ballot.
I can vote for George Bush.
But he went to Yale. And he has Dan
Quayle, who thinks it is a terrible thing
to lose one's mind. ..a potato(e).. .or
Murphy Brown.
I can vote for Bill Clinton.

But he went to Yale. And has dated
indiscreet women.
So, who to vote for? I have to admit
that some of my personal characteristics
and circumstances make the choice pret
ty simple.
I am a woman. Male-female income
disparities, child care issues, education
and how these problems will be
addressed by the candidates are of
paramount importance to me.
I am an African-American. You might
say that being black colors my decision
somewhat (no pun intended). Yet being
an ethnic minority in the United States
limits my ability to feel confident voting
for a candidate who played up negative
racist stereotypes and urban fears to
gain office (Willie Horton).
In the last decade, I have watched the
social programs designed to begin the long
process of rectifying past racial injustices
wilt and die from lack of funding and gov
ernmental support. Civil rights, social

recognition, and the general quality of life
which began to improve during the 1970's
for most blacks and Latinos, began a
steady decline 12 years ago.
I am not wealthy. Currently there
exists a larger economic gap between the
haves and the have-nots, than has been
witnessed in this nation since World
War 11. As a definite have-not, this fact
is not reassuring.
What this means is that I must try to
find a way to adequately raise and edu
cate a child in a country where some col
leges are increasing their tuition at
quadruple the rate of inflation, child
care and housing are outrageously
expensive and the average social scien
tist, like myself, earns less than a con
struction worker.
I can not afford to wait for the gains
of the wealthy to "trickle down" to me. I
could be collecting Social Security by the
time it reaches me — if Social Security
still exists.

I am soon going to need a job. Yes, I
am going into the labor force and I plan
to stay there until they throw me out, at
age 70 or 80. You are probably going to
need a job too. But unless we begin a
process of genuine economic recovery, it
is going to be a difficult process to find
— and keep — the kind of employment
we are qualified for.
So, while I do not want high taxes,
either, I would rather pay more taxes in
a country which is progressing economi
cally and socially than pay fewer taxes
and lose all of the hard-won rights that
have been granted in the past twenty
years.
To be very honest, any one of these
reasons is sufficient to keep me from
voting for George Bush. So I'm going to
vote for Bill Clinton in November. And
keep my fingers crossed.
