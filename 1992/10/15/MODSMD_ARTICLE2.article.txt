# Obscene callers harassing campus again
## Six-fold increase in reports of 'panters,' 'panty thieves' and pedophiles 
### Jane Bahk 
Obscene phone callers are again
plaguing the Stanford campus, and po
lice report that the problem is worse
than in past years.
Twenty-six reports of obscene phone
calls have been filed with the police
since the beginning of this school year,
according to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
The obscene phone calls have been
"more prolific this year, but we don't
know why," he said.
Since Jan. 1, 167 reports have been
filed, Niemeyer added.
The tally of 167 obscene calls in 1992
is a dramatic increase from past years.
A 10-year survey conducted between
1979 and 1988 revealed that the Stan
ford police received an average of 25 re
ported obscene phone calls per year.
Some of the calls reported so far this

year are similar to ones that have been
reported in past years, such as the
"Panter" and "Bob Quist" (an alias an
anonymous caller calls himself),
Niemeyer said.

An obscene phone caller
was recently caught
thanks to new phone
number displays in use
in some campus offices.

Niemeyer described "Quist" as "what
we call a classic pedophile" and said he is
"extremely vile and vulgar".
However, there are also new callers
that students have reported harassing
the campus, Niemeyer said.

One caller has a urine fetish and
"makes various statements about his
urine and | victim's] urine," he said.
Another caller — named the "Panty
Thief' by Niemeyer — threatens to be a
potentiaJ stalker, but police have no
proof yet.
Typically, the caller tells his victim
that he stole some panties out of her
laundry bag or has gotten into her dor
mitory. He sometimes calls repeatedly,
often four or five times within 24 hours.
Niemeyer says that people should
not panic, but added that if "anybody is
missing items such as undergarments,
we need to know. Don't dismiss it."
A junior who wished to remain
anonymous described a call she had re
ceived.
"Someone called me claiming to be
doing a psych survey and started asking
sexual questions, and when I answered
them, he would say 'really?' and asked

questions that seemed to be for his own
enjoyment," she said.

The caller had been harassing a
woman working at the Medical Center
without realizing that when he called,
the number appeared on her display,
Niemeyer said.
"Beware — the new phone displays
are very helpful and more and more
people are getting them," Niemeyer
said.
"What works best is to hang up.
Keep hanging up if the caller tries
again. Usually this does it," Niemeyer
said. "The suspect is seeking sexual
gratification from the calls and he
won't keep trying after one or two
times. He'll dial someone else and hope
fully the someone else is a big football
player."
