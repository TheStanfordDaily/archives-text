# Library estimates of on line services slightly off

### 
It has come to my attention that in
"the 1992-1993 Guide to Libraries of
Stanford University" recently inserted
in The Daily, we were a bit too enthusi
astic in citing that 95 percent of all of
Stanford's library materials are now
accessible on-line.
It is true that this figure is accurate
for titles in all of the Humanities, Social
Sciences, Sciences and Engineering
libraries that fall under the aegis of
Stanford University Libraries, including
Meyer and Green, but not the Coordi
nate Libraries.
One-hundred percent of SLAC
Library materials are available through
on-line searches. The Law library also
does indeed have about 95 percent of all

titles and serials on-line — a notable
exception being statutes and court
reports.
However, Hoover Institution Library
officials estimate that about 75 percent
of its volumes are accessible through on
line searching (this figure does not rep
resent the Archive or East Asian hold
ings).
Both Lane Medical Library and the J.
Hugh Jackson Library have only about
60 percent of all materials on-line at this
time.
At both of these libraries 100 percent
of all monographs acquired since 1978
and most serials (all at Lane) can be
found through on-line searches.
In conclusion, Socrates (and LOIS at
Lane and SPIRES at SLAC) is still the
best place to begin searching for current
library materials. But you will need to
be aware that finding some particular

types of materials (e.g. maps, archives,
government publications) and older
titles in the collections of Coordinate
Libraries may require additional "hard
copy" searching in the card and printed
catalogs of selected locations.
