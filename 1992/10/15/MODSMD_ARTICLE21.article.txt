# After four years, Bush stilt can't keep a promise
## 
### 
A few days ago, President George
Bush again promised that he would
never raise taxes. He had learned his les
son. The next day his press secretary
Marvin Fitzwater told reporters that
Bush's promise not to raise taxes wasn't
really a promise because it wasn't a

pledge.
In one amazing moment Fitzwater
succeeded in taking us to the core of the
problem of Bush and his administration.
Fitzwater's explanation of Bush's cur
rent stand on taxes goes beyond word
gamesmanship and "slicksterism."
Welcome to the Bush world of "new
speak" and political nihilism. When a
promise is not a promise because it is
not a pledge, then words strung together
into declarative sentences by Bush and
his administrators declare nothing. They
are simply words spoken to cover the
immediacy of a moment.
The only words that Bush has used
sincerely were his words that he would
do anything to remain President. This is
Bush's real truth and the reality of his
new world order.
