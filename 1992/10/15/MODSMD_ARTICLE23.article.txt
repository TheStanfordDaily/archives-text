## Barcelona revelations 
### 
IWAS READY TO RETURN TO
Barcelona. I had spent the month of
August traveling alone through
Spain, and after spending the first few
days of my trip amidst the Olympic city's
heat and insanity, I was anxious to
return on a quiet Sunday morning to the
city now hopefully emptied of most of the
athletes, tourists and locals gone on vaca
tion.
But I wasn't ready for the prostitute in
the small alley behind my hostel. Early
on in the trip, I had prided myself for
mixing entirely with people that didn't fit
the general scheme of my family and
friends at home: the old men feeding
pigeons in the parks of Madrid, Moroccan
hash runners in the plaza of Valencia,
vagabond bisexuals in the bus station of
Santander, fisherman and cab drivers —
I was determined to stay clear of the Let's
Go crowd.
But I wasn't ready for the prostitute. I
was tired, and practically exhausted of all
my romantic illusions of traveling alone
and speaking with these "others." When
she came at me in the alley with all her
arms, too many fingers, and liquored
invitations to a half-hour of Spanish love,
I could refuse the escapade, but not the
conversation.
My traveling diary would love this:
wrestling and dancing my way out of her
arms, lying about my wife upstairs and
her slurred praises for all my bueno.

When reaching into my back pocket an
hour later at a cafe and realizing all my
money had been stolen, I was not ready.
I was not ready for loss, even one as
minor as this. I never have been, and
probably won't be until the third or
fourth time it happens. After leaving the
cafe, I sat dazed next to the giant foun
tains of the Placa Catalunya, hoping the
noise of the rushing waters would silence
the pathetic songs of self-pity rising
inside of me.
But as always, my only hope was to
think of someone else's tragedy, to try to
imagine what someone else would always
have to remember.
I could think of no one else than the
Spanish lady and all the country's news
papers smeared with photographs of her
sunken head. Two days earlier, Spain had
experienced its most horrible bus crash in
history. And here was this lady who had
just lost her husband, two sons, a nephew
and three sisters.
And here was I who had just lost a few
hundred dollars. I looked for a star in the
polluted nighttime sky, a dot of light
from centuries past to tell me it was a
waste of time to try to reconcile my fate
thus far with hers. An airplane blinking
red told me otherwise.
I really have no hope of understanding
why some lives seem to be threaded with
disaster and others with fortune. Per
haps it is just a matter of time for those of

fortune. Perhaps it just is and there's no
way through or around it.
Like I have, you can wish, you can
pray, you can hope daily for the safety
of those you cherish most. But what
does one do with the times when you
realize that for hours you have not
thought about a family member, lover,
or friend and then suddenly imagine
that in that time he or she had been lost
forever? What does one do with the
times when you realize that no matter
what, he, she and they will soon be gone
forever?
At the end of certain afternoons, I try
not to think back to a couple of weeks
before, to the fear of how fast a day or
year seemed to slip by — and this memo
ry followed by terror at not having done
anything in those two weeks to slow it all
down.
The spin, the flux, the straight line of
days and nights and decades; but there is
still time for words and gestures before
the twilight of regret.
