## Cardinal soccer tackles St. Mary's in 3-0 victory 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
All the components of the Stanford men's soccer
team switched into high gear yesterday as the Car
dinal outshot, outran, outplayed, and outscored the
St. Mary's Gaels by a final score of 3-0.
The relatively close score does not begin to illus
trate the lopsided match on offense. The Cardinal
onslaught started midway through the first period
with junior midfielder Joel Russell's first goal of the
season, off of an assist by Robert Brophy.
Ten minutes later, Stanford (9-4-0, 3-1 in confer
ence action) charged down the field again with a
clear break-away as sophomore midfielder Ryan
Collins had both the Gaels' defense and goalkeeper
beat. Collins tried to tap the ball into the empty goal
but was denied by a Gaels' defender who slid into the
goal to clear the ball away.
"In that case, Ryan held onto the ball too long,"
said coach Colin Lindores. "Sometimes I think we
create a bigger obstacle for ourselves than the oppo
nents ever do, particularly in executing and finish
ing plays."
Unfazed, the Cardinal domination on both ends
of the field continued into the second period as
Collins sought to redeem himself on a perfect shot
which was illegally blocked by St. Mary's midfielder
Ron Nespeca.
Nespeca was then red-carded and ejected for inten
tionally using his hands to thwart the play, setting up
a Jason Vanacour penalty kick. Vanacour converted
the kick into the far left corner and now leads the Car
dinal in scoring with six goals and one assist.
From then on, the Gaels (4-7-0, 0-1 in West Coast
Conference) came unglued and allowed Stanford to
set up several scoring opportunities on fast-break
situations.
Forward Lance Killian flew past St. Mary's
defenders and dished off a perfect assist to forward
Jim Talluto who scored into the empty goal, only to

have the play called back on a personal foul by Tal
luto, who was offsides.
"[The refereel interpreted that Jimmy had run
past Killian when the ball was pushed to him." Lin
dores said. "It's not uncommon for that to happen
during a game, but you have to be patient and play
behind the passer and wait for the ball to be dropped
off. I'm just glad that it didn't happen in a game
where we really needed a goal."
Killian was then denied again on a shot that
apparently crossed the goal line, as the linesman
ruled that it was not completely in the goal. On his
third try, Killian again broke away and scooped the
ball to Talluto, who easily rifled it past the Gaels'
goalkeeper to round out the scoring at 3-0.
Analyzing the many scoring opportunities that
Stanford squandered, Lindores said, "I can't say St.
Mary's ever really challenged us on the attack. It's
just that we didn't take advantage of big situations
in the attacking third of the field due to either tech
nical breakdowns or tactically making the wrong
judgments."
On the defensive side, the team has been strong
in its last two outings. Toppling Oregon State 3-0 on
Sunday, Stanford has been showing the rest of the
conference just how stingy their backfielders can be.
Since moving Vanacour into the midfield, the
backfielders are now strictly concerned with
defense, and their improvement has been obvious in
the past two games, both shut-outs. Goalkeeper
Kyle Krpata continues to be untouchable, lowering
his goals-against average to a minuscule 1.17.
After a day off tomorrow, the Cardinal will travel
to California to face a Golden Bears team which has
struggled as of late. Stanford will have to maintain
their intensity, however, because they still trail con
ference-leader Washington by one game.
"We still have to play steady and not get too excit
ed about our two consecutive shut-outs," said Vana
cour, "Because we're still a long ways away from
where we want to be."

After a day off tomorrow, the Cardinal will travel
to California to face a Golden Bears team which has
struggled as of late. Stanford will have to maintain
their intensity, however, because they still trail con
ference-leader Washington by one game.
"We still have to play steady and not get too excit
ed about our two consecutive shut-outs," said Vana
cour, "Because we're still a long ways away from
where we want to be."


Junior Ricky Goad sees nothing but net during the Cardinal's impressive 3-0 victory over the Gaels of
St. Mary's yesterday.
