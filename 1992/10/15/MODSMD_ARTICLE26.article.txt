# Bikini tops and boxers make exciting football experience
## 
### 
Football, that masculine sport where
men the size of one-room doubles in
Lagunita crash into each other for the
glory of the Cardinal. A sporting event par
excellence. A match of wills, a battle of skills.
But, I'm not going talking about what
happens on the field, silly.
I'm talking football as a hard-core Stan
ford fan sees it: the tailgater, the tan, the
chance to take a luscious frosh-interest
under your wing and teach them just the
right time to jump during "All Right Now."
This is serious stuff, requiring years of
practice, hours of thought and a low-cut
bikini top you just "happened" to have on
under your red and white striped J Crew
Easy-T.
You're confused? Where's the pigskin
fit into all this?
It doesn't. I mean it does, but we're talk
ing about something much more important
than some little contest. We're talking the
most concentrated gathering of the "beau
tiful" people this side of the second floor of
Green — after dinner at the Suites is over.
So, you're on top of all the Cardinal's

stats, you've memorized Bill Walsh's career
record and figured out that Glyn Milburn
said "Hi" to Potter after that touchdown
against Notre Dame, and was not, in fact,

waving to his mom. Good for you. You need
help. Let me give you a few pointers for the
socially acceptable football game experience.
You have to get dressed right. It's
gonna be hotter than the water in the
dorm showers when someone flushes the
toilet, so the key is dress for sun. Sun
screen is for wusses, but sweat is uncool.
Find a nice, happy medium between your

winter quarter rain gear and the saran
wrap you wore to Exotic Erotic.
It'll be a stretch to get rid of your Land's
End shoes and Dockers, but you've gotta
wear sandals, denim shorts, and a shirt
that'll look good draped around your waistf
Men, remember to wear your most,
stylish pair of boxers, because you've got to
take your shirt off during the game. It is a
peculiar Stanford phenomenon that boxers
tweak out the top of guys' shorts, like they
were made to be pulled up to your armpits
or something. If that babe in your Poli Sci
class is going to see your undergarments,
you'd better have on the Victoria's Secret
pair your hometown honey gave you.
Women, this is your only chance all
year to wear a bikini top and get away with
it. If you read on the grass at Roble Field
in a bikini, other women will scorn you. If
you hang out at the Co Ho in a bikini,
other people will think you've dropped
acid too many times, so seize the day, man.
All too soon you'll be dragging out the
sweats. Go nuts for the day. You'll never
have had so many male friends.

Pass up the 10 a.m. Flo-Mo brunch. No
criss-cut fries, we're going big time. I'm
talking tailgating at its finest. Free food for
those who've mastered the art of leeching:
Remember to be on your best behavior
when y6u St£p ort the lacrosse fields. A tail-
isfrt the pl£c& tp be yofiYseff A tail
gater is a place to t>e beautiful Hillel, your
freshman advisor and the Women's Cen
ter don't throw tailgaters, and there's a
reason for that.
This is full-on social competition. Who
can be the perkiest, coolest, most-laid
back while still "so into" the game. This
isn't for the faint of heart.
You can go the easy route, doing the
fraternity/sorority thing, pretending to
wave across the cars at alleged friends
while pumping the keg in front of a trans
fixed pledge. Just ask him/her if he/she's
seen Brian/Amy yet today, and you've got
it covered.
But woman cannot live on beer alone.
The alumni scene is where the action
is. Along with cheese on those crusty
sesame-seed crackers, you might also pick

up a summer job. Just look cute and
scared, and undoubtedly some steel
haired Stanford patriot will help you out.
Always be polite and use "ma'am" and
"sir". With the use of a few useful phras
es such as "How 'bout them Indians" and
"Hey, weren't you up at Sierra Camp
with a much younger person of the oppo
site sex this summer?" you'll be given
enough food to last you until you stop out
to join the Peace Corps.
Then you've got to run over in time to get
a good seat. You spot two shirtless males
saving large chunks of prime seats.
Do what I do. A quick question, like "Is
this where the girls who want to lose their
virginity sit?" will get you a seat 100 per
cent of the time.
Ah, now it's just you and the thrill of
the game. And as for that group of cute
freshmen to your left just ripe for the pick
ing, well.. . play ball!

Lagunita crash into each other for the
glory of the Cardinal. A sporting event par
excellence. A match of wills, a battle of skills.
But, I'm not going talking about what
happens on the field, silly.
I'm talking football as a hard-core Stan
ford fan sees it: the tailgater, the tan, the
chance to take a luscious frosh-interest
under your wing and teach them just the
right time to jump during "All Right Now."
This is serious stuff, requiring years of
practice, hours of thought and a low-cut
bikini top you just "happened" to have on
under your red and white striped J Crew
Easy-T.
You're confused? Where's the pigskin
fit into all this?
It doesn't. I mean it does, but we're talk
ing about something much more important
than some little contest. We're talking the
most concentrated gathering of the "beau
tiful" people this side of the second floor of
Green — after dinner at the Suites is over.
So, you're on top of all the Cardinal's

stats, you've memorized Bill Walsh's career
record and figured out that Glyn Milburn
said "Hi" to Potter after that touchdown
against Notre Dame, and was not, in fact,

waving to his mom. Good for you. You need
help. Let me give you a few pointers for the
socially acceptable football game experience.
You have to get dressed right. It's
gonna be hotter than the water in the
dorm showers when someone flushes the
toilet, so the key is dress for sun. Sun
screen is for wusses, but sweat is uncool.
Find a nice, happy medium between your

winter quarter rain gear and the saran
wrap you wore to Exotic Erotic.
It'll be a stretch to get rid of your Land's
End shoes and Dockers, but you've gotta
wear sandals, denim shorts, and a shirt
that'll look good draped around your waistf
Men, remember to wear your most,
stylish pair of boxers, because you've got to
take your shirt off during the game. It is a
peculiar Stanford phenomenon that boxers
tweak out the top of guys' shorts, like they
were made to be pulled up to your armpits
or something. If that babe in your Poli Sci
class is going to see your undergarments,
you'd better have on the Victoria's Secret
pair your hometown honey gave you.
Women, this is your only chance all
year to wear a bikini top and get away with
it. If you read on the grass at Roble Field
in a bikini, other women will scorn you. If
you hang out at the Co Ho in a bikini,
other people will think you've dropped
acid too many times, so seize the day, man.
All too soon you'll be dragging out the
sweats. Go nuts for the day. You'll never
have had so many male friends.

Pass up the 10 a.m. Flo-Mo brunch. No
criss-cut fries, we're going big time. I'm
talking tailgating at its finest. Free food for
those who've mastered the art of leeching:
Remember to be on your best behavior
when y6u St£p ort the lacrosse fields. A tail-
isfrt the pl£c& tp be yofiYseff A tail
gater is a place to t>e beautiful Hillel, your
freshman advisor and the Women's Cen
ter don't throw tailgaters, and there's a
reason for that.
This is full-on social competition. Who
can be the perkiest, coolest, most-laid
back while still "so into" the game. This
isn't for the faint of heart.
You can go the easy route, doing the
fraternity/sorority thing, pretending to
wave across the cars at alleged friends
while pumping the keg in front of a trans
fixed pledge. Just ask him/her if he/she's
seen Brian/Amy yet today, and you've got
it covered.
But woman cannot live on beer alone.
The alumni scene is where the action
is. Along with cheese on those crusty
sesame-seed crackers, you might also pick

up a summer job. Just look cute and
scared, and undoubtedly some steel
haired Stanford patriot will help you out.
Always be polite and use "ma'am" and
"sir". With the use of a few useful phras
es such as "How 'bout them Indians" and
"Hey, weren't you up at Sierra Camp
with a much younger person of the oppo
site sex this summer?" you'll be given
enough food to last you until you stop out
to join the Peace Corps.
Then you've got to run over in time to get
a good seat. You spot two shirtless males
saving large chunks of prime seats.
Do what I do. A quick question, like "Is
this where the girls who want to lose their
virginity sit?" will get you a seat 100 per
cent of the time.
Ah, now it's just you and the thrill of
the game. And as for that group of cute
freshmen to your left just ripe for the pick
ing, well.. . play ball!
