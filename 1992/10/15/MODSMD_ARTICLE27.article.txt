If style points were awarded for soccer goals,
yesterday's women's match versus California
could have been a 10-0 blowout. Actually, only one

game," he said. "Sometimes when you aren't com
municating you tend to focus too much inward and
you isolate yourself."
So in the warm-up prior to the Bear match,
Andeberhan made sure every player was talking to
her teammates. The tactic paid off as the Cardinal
stayed vocal once the game started.
