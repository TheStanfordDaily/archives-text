# Cardinal squad kicks Berkeley in soccer game
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
If style points were awarded for soccer goals,
yesterday's women's match versus California
could have been a 10-0 blowout. Actually, only one
score was notched in Stanford's 1-0 win, but oh,
what a goal it was.
Sarah Rafanelli began the charge by taking the
ball down the right side of the field. She curled
towards the penalty box while tiptoeing and trip
ping around two Cal defenders. Seeing Julie Foudy
slipping between fullbacks near the left goal post,
Rafanelli booted a perfectly-arced shot towards the
midfielder.
Moving to the shot, Foudy leapt for the ball and
at the peak of her jump, headed the ball into the
upper left corner of the net. The play was made
almost indefensible by Rafanelli's accurate pass
and Foudy's ability to time the header perfectly.
"Our biggest problem on corner kicks and cross
es is that we've been getting in too early and get
ting caught standing," Foudy explained. "So I was
trying to hold off long enough so I could be moving
in when I hit it."
The spectacular play stood out in a game that
was not otherwise so as the No. 2 Cardinal played
well enough and was patient enough to vanquish
the Bears.
Worried about the emotional and physical toll
Monday's loss to No. 1 North Carolina took on his
players, Stanford coach Berhane Andeberhan
focused on mental preparation in the practice prior
to yesterday's contest.
"We talked about how we needed to get into the
game," he said. "Sometimes when you aren't com
municating you tend to focus too much inward and
you isolate yourself."
So in the warm-up prior to the Bear match,
Andeberhan made sure every player was talking to
her teammates. The tactic paid off as the Cardinal
stayed vocal once the game started.

mates yelled encouragement and
instructions to each other. Sweep
er Jessica Fischer shouted for a
midfielder with the ball to "hold it
there," when the Bears crowded
the forward passing lanes.
Goalkeeper Lesley Garrard
directed a fullback to an
unmarked Bear attacker coming
down the sideline. When the
Stanford attack started to lag late
in the game, Julie Foudy waved
her arm forward and hoarsely
exhorted her teammates upfield.
Even when the shouting
seemed unnecessary, it served a

valuable purpose, Andeberhan
said.
"When you have the ball and
you've decided to control it, you
can be more relaxed when some
one tells you that you have time,"
he said.
Along with focusing on com
munication, the squad concen
trated on clean passing. The Car
dinal opened holes in the Cal
defense with quick, short passes
through the midfield.
When the Stanford fullbacks
had possession, often one or two
midfielders came back to receive
the pass. If under little pressure,
the midfielder turned and took
the ball upfield. But if the defense
closed in, the midfielder tapped
the ball back to the fullbacks, who

then looked for midfielders and
forwards open farther downfield,
between the Bears' stretched-out
defense.
However, the Cardinal passing
occasionally faltered, allowing the
Bears to converge on the net. Sev
eral times, the Cal forwards got
behind the defense and forced
Garrard to dive into a pack of
attackers to corral the ball.
"In the end, it was more
fatigue than anything else,"
Andeberhan said. "We just didn't
have any legs left."
But the Stanford squad had
enough left to hold on for another
shutout and the team's 11th victo
ry of the season. Next for the Car
dinal (11-1) is a Sunday showdown
with Santa Barbara at UCSB.
