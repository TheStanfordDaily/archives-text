# Golfers take third in Seattle tourney
## 
### Andy Collins 
Despite a strong second
round on Tuesday, the Stan
ford women's golf team was
unable to pass a sinking Okla
homa squad and finished third
overall at the Edean Ihlanfeldt
Invitational at Sahalee Coun
try Club in Redmond, Wash
ington.
After shooting a 306 (the
low score for the second
round), the Cardinal reverted
to first-round form with a 316,
to close the three-day tourna
ment with a 940 stroke total.
No. 1-ranked San Jose State
left all other teams in the dust
with a total score of only 915, a
full 21 strokes ahead of second
place Oklahoma, which did its
best to self-destruct, recording
totals of 307-310-319. Arizona,
tied for second place after the
first round, withdrew early
Tuesday because of a death in
the family of one of their
golfers.
Melinda Daniels, a junior,
led the way for Stanford, com
ing on strong with a third
round of 74 to finish in sixth
place with a score of 230. Fifth
year senior Martha Richards
and sophomore Jamille Jose
tied for eighth at 232 strokes.
Freshman Vicky Strada
rebounded from a slow start to
finish in 34th place with a total
of 247. Sophomore Amy
Lawrence also finished on a
stronger note with second and
third rounds of 81 and 84,
respectively, though her rough

first round prevented her from
climbing higher than a tie for
47th with a 256.
The tree-lined, 5,918 yard
par-72 course "really exposes
any weaknesses" of a player,
said head coach Tim Baldwin.
The "most difficult course"
that Stanford faces all year,
Baldwin declared, Sahalee
"magnified any tendency for
errors."
Although the overall team
finish was a bit disappointing,
Baldwin was pleased with the
scores of Stanford's top three
golfers.
"There was not much pro
ductivity out of our number
four and five players," Baldwin
said. "That will be rectified. . .
They're both very talented."
Describing the competition
as "a learning tournament,"
Baldwin repeated that most, if
not all, of the other teams at
the match had already played
one or even two tournaments,
as compared to Stanford,
which entered Washington
untested.
Despite the domination
exhibited by the San Jose
squad, coach Baldwin was
"unimpressed" by their play.
"We beat them in the second
round by playing only a decent
round," Baldwin said, calling
the tourney "a wake-up call"
for the Spartans.
The next competition for the
Cardinal is the Stanford Inter
collegiate, which will be played
on the Stanford golf course
Oct 23-25
