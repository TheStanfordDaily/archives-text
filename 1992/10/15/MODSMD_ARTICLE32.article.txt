# Stanford group gives students chance at some real business opportunities

When the going gets tough, the tough get
going.
Facing a tight job market and increased
competition, several innovative Stanford stu
dents striving toward careers in business are
helping themselves get a hands-on head start
in the working world.
The students are getting a taste of reality
through Stanford Consulting Group, a stu
dent-run organization that provides consult
ing services to Bay Area businesses.
The non-profit group's main focus is strat
egy management consulting — providing
"marketing and management solutions for
small business start-up companies," according
to its president, senior Ted Lai.
Stanford Consulting, which does not
charge for its services, employs up to 26 stu
dents from a wide variety of undergraduate
and graduate academic programs.
"A lot of students are interested in consult
ing, but fmd summer internships very tough
to get," said Lai. "Without experience, one
often gets rejected."
But he added, "We don't expect people to
have consulting experience."

Working for Stanford Consulting gives stu
dents the opportunity to "see the
entrepreneurial side of things, meet interest
ing business people and meet and share ideas
with each other," according to Lai.
"You get a general business sense of what a
company has to consider, things such as market
ing and advertising," said industrial engineering
major Allie Okubo, a senior. "You can read about
these things, but it's not the same as doing it."
Open to all students, the group — estab
lished last year as a replacement for Stanford
in-Business — is organized into five positions,
including the president. Two vice presidents
are responsible for implementation, recruiting
and general administration while three project
directors actively set up and execute projects
with local businesses.
Four consultants — generally upperclass
men — are assigned to each project, conduct
ing research and making presentations to
businesses. They also help train associate con
sultants, the entry-level students who assist
with the projects.
Although the group has recruited associate
consultants from the industrial engineering
and economics departments, it is nonetheless
open to all students regardless of academic

background or employment experience.
Past projects included work for Banana Fish,
a software company, and for the Snow Rider
Energy Bar, a candy bar aimed at challenging
the Power Sports Bar with a better-tasting
product. During both projects, students made
contact with company founders and presidents.
Banana Fish was seeking to promote its
product, but lacked the necessary funds or
venture capital. Instead, it relied on Stanford
Consulting to determine market targets and
spending focus.
"As a small company with limited
resources, we were very excited about the
prospect of working with students interested
in business management and marketing, and
were especially impressed with the diversity of
the group in terms of academic level, concen
tration of study and business experience," the
company's evaluation said.
This year, the group is negotiating with the
industrial engineering department to get a
faculty advisor and possibly receive academic
credit for its work. In addition, a board of advi
sors consisting of financial, marketing, prod
uct management and management consultant
executives from prominent Bay Area business
es is being established.
