Stanford sailed past 12
schools including top-ranked
Navy this weekend, taking sec
ond place in the west coast
opening Stoney Burke Intersec
tional hosted by California. The
Hawaii squad took first place
honors in the competition.
Led by skippers John Emory
and Scott Sellers, the Cardinal
sailing team beat Navy, Cal, and
UC-Irvine, all sure to be ranked
in the top 10, setting itself up
for a possible national champi
onship, said coach Blake Mid
dleton.
"This is a good signal for the
upcoming year," Middleton
speculated. "We should be right
there contending for nationals
in June."
This weekend's regatta was
the team's third top-10 finish
this year and was a sign of solid
ity, depth, and potential, Mid
dleton said.
The Cardinal finished sev

enth in a Labor Day regatta at
Yale earlier this season and
sped to a fourth place finish in
the Nevins Trophy Regatta at
the U.S. Merchant Marine
Academy, particularly pleasing
as 10 of the 18 competing
squads were ranked among the
top 15 teams in the country,
captain Emory said. The
Stoney Burke finish shows the
previous performances were
not flukes, he added.
But the team's performance
last weekend did not seem quite
so impressive at mid-day Sun
day when the team was drifting
in fourth place with only about
one-fourth of the competition
remaining.
"We had two sixth-places in
the first two races and we knew
we needed to give a maximum
physical effort to come from
behind," Emory said.
"The conditions were chal
lenging and as we won more and
more races, we got more
psyched up for the next," he
said.
