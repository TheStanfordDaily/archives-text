# Palm Dr. to be partly repaired
## 
### Greg Miller 
Palm Drive is getting 12 new palm trees, and
some of its connecting roads have recently been
resurfaced, but the bumps and potholes on Stan
ford's main drag won't be repaired any time soon,
according to a campus facilities official.
The cost of repairing Palm Drive will require spe
cial funding beyond the facilities office's budget,
according to Mike Kuntz, a civil manager in the
Facilities Project Management office.
Ordinarily, the office repairs roads at regular
intervals in order to prevent costly deterioration.
"If you let the good roads get in bad shape, they
become expensive," said Kuntz. "Palm Drive is the
classic example. My regular budgets are nowhere
near enough to do Palm Drive."
The repair of Palm Drive will cost between $1.5
and $3 million, according to Kuntz, who said his
office plans to request such funding from the Board
of Trustees in February.
Work began Oct. 3 on several other campus roads,
including Serra Street and Campus Drive West, and
is scheduled to be completed Friday, according to
Kuntz, at a cost of $220,000.
Most of the repairs were asphalt overlays, but
Serra St. received a "chip-seal" surface, he said.

"A chip-seal will seal up cracks and provide a new
wearing surface at about half the cost of an asphalt
overlay," said Kuntz.
The facilities office is also replacing 12 palm trees
that were removed earlier in the year because of dis
ease or decay. The cost of that project is $25,000,
and the last shipment of six trees is due Friday.
Before presenting the Palm Drive proposal to the
board, Kuntz said that related repairs, tests and
design work will need to be performed.
"First we have to take care of the drainage prob
lem on Palm Drive," said Kuntz. "When it rains, the
outside lanes are flooded. Then we have to do some
testing on the road, including soil strength analysis.
Then we can do a design and come up with a more
specific cost estimate to present to the board."
Kuntz said that the Palm Drive repairs are likely
to be costly because the road, the oldest on campus,
has never undergone significant repair or redesign.
"Palm Drive was restricted to horses and car
riages until about 1915," said Kuntz. "It was never
built as a modern road. It's a horse and buggy trail
that's been built up over the years with layer after
layer of asphalt.
"That's why we need to test it to see what's down
there, and whether it can be repaired or whether we
have to haul the whole thing away," he explained.
