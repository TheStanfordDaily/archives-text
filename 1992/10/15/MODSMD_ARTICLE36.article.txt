## MOVIES Studly Seagal scores with blood and gore in quasi-political film 
### 
Andrew Davis* "Under Siege" aims to satis
fy the American audience's appetite for blood,
excitement, humor and political criticism. It
tries to incorporate Bruce Willis' "Die Hard"
capabilities and MacGyver's ingenuity into
Steven Seagal's martial arts mastery and stun
ning good looks.
The movie is set on board the USS Missouri,
the battleship which first fired on Iraq during
the Persian Gulf War. Having been honored by
George Bush, the ship is on its way to be dis
armed.
En route, the boat is hijacked by two mili
tary-created lunatics (Tommy Lee Jones and
Gary Busey) who consider their takeover a rev
olution against the American government,
which has betrayed and disappointed them.
Responsibility to save the ship and prevent
nuclear destruction rests on the shoulders of
Casey Ryback (Seagal), a disenchanted war
hero subordinated to the rank of cook.
Those who enjoyed the creative and bloody
killings in the two "Die Hard" films will find
similar thrills in this film. However, the
movie's emphasis on gore borders on offensive
— not to mention that the audience is forced
to sit through periods of slow dialogue and
poor acting while waiting for the action to
begin.
The film's weak attempts at humor result in
corny dialogue: When a helpless girl says, "I'm
afraid of being alone," a macho man responds,
"Are you afraid of being dead?"
Cheesy coincidences ensure the plot's pro
gression. In one scene, a bomb set for a ran
dom amount of time conveniently explodes
just when Seagal's enemies enter.
Moreover, the film takes a two-dimension
al approach to character development. Com
mander Krill (Busey) is portrayed as a stereo
typical lunatic. In one scene he dresses as a
woman with a cigar in his mouth and exclaims
in a Jack Nicholson voice, "Do I look like I
need a psychological evaluation?"
Finally, the inclusion of token blond
bimbo, Jordan Tate (Erika Eleniak), and her

completely unnecessary "boob shot" serves no
purpose but to draw adolescent males to the
theaters. Tate progresses from Playboy bunny
to snot-nosed child to front-line nurse, fur
thering the cause of women with lines such as,
"I only support women's lib when it works in
my favor."
What makes this movie interesting is its
timely political and social commentary. Re
leased so close to election time, the film sur
prises few with its references to presidential
candidates. One line even suggests that with
enough money the presidency can be bought.
"Under Siege" is worth seeing, despite its

weaknesses. It is thought-provoking and excit
ing, and you can always close your eyes during
those gruesome slow motion close-ups.
