# A 						dizzying, daring dip into the 'deviant' world of the criminal '30s
## 
### 
Still breathless from their escape from the law,
two lovers embrace and exchange rings. The
lovers—Nathan "Babe" Leopold (CraigChester)
and Richard "Dickie" Loeb (Daniel Schlachet) —
will become infamous in 1924, for kidnapping
and murdering a young boy in Chicago.
Sexual passion and the adrenalin rush of law
lessness combine to create the tense energy of
"Swoon," writer/director Tom Kalin's exciting
but disorienting new film. His first feature
length work, "Swoon" gives testimony to
Kalin's penchant for uninhibited experimenta
tion with visual elements, history and issues of
sexuality.
The film's most striking aspect is Dickie and
Babe's relationship. They spend their time plan
ning and executing small crimes and reading
books by Nietzsche and other intellectuals.
"Swoon" does not fall into the trap of ro
manticizing the characters in a revisionist
mode. Nor does it repeat the age-old mistake of
blaming the crimes on their perpetrators' "de
viant" homosexuality or their identity as Jewish
intellectuals.
Dickie and Babe discuss their plans noncha
lantly, and Dickie executes the murder in a cold
blooded and almost sadistic manner. They offer
no apologies, although Babe later seems to show
some regret — or maybe even fear.
Both main characters take turns narrating
the film in the style of journal entries, and fur
ther information is provided by Leopold's psy

chiatric sessions and visual clues.
"Swoon" pushes the edges of film conven
tion, in style as well as content. The movie,
filmed in black and white, contains newsreel
images from the 1920s as well as scenes with a
more contemporary feel.
"Swoon" pokes fun at society's "truth-seek
ers" who are biased and quick to draw conclu
sions. At one point, all of the women (including
the court stenographer) are made to clear the
courtroom because the charges of sexual abuse
are deemed too brutal for their ears.
The film also makes a dig at the media, which
tag Dickie and Babe with the gangster nick
names of ' Baby Face" and "Master Mind" —
names that seem comical in the context of the
rest of the film.
The final scenes of "Swoon" take place in
prison, where Dickie and Babe are physically
separated, left only with the memories of their
relationship. After Dickie is brutally murdered
by another convict, Babe returns to Dickie's
body one last time. The camera zooms in on the
ring on Dickie's finger which Babe then re
moves and places on his own hand.
"Swoon" takes risks both thematically and
artistically. Although failing at points, the film
delivers the dizzying effect promised in its title
and offers the viewer a radical departure from
the typical cinematic experience.
