# A 						male perspective: wealthy doctor can't find what he needs
## 
### 
At a time when "Thelma and Louise" and its
many sister films explore life from a female per
spective, "The Bachelor" is a welcome explo
ration of the male point of view.
Italian director Roberto Faenza's second
English film "The Bachelor," is the melancholy
tale of Dr. Graesler (Keith Carradine), a man
without a family of his own. Torn between his
desire for a family and his fear of what this en
tails, Graesler ambles through life unsure of
what he wants.
Set in pre-World War I Europe, the film
opens in an atmosphere of waste and wealth on
the island of Lanzarote where Graesler and his
sister Friedrike (Miranda Richardson) spend
their winters.
Within the first 15 minutes of the film,
Friedrike commits suicide, setting the film's
thick plot into motion. Upon his sister's death,
Graesler rejects his bachelor lifestyle and begins
an earnest search for companionship. He re
turns early to the Austro-Hungarian country
side to resume his successful medical practice at
a luxurious health spa, where he meets and falls
in love with Sabine (Kristin Scott-Thomas).
However, Sabine's forwardness soon intim
idates Graesler into retreating to his apartment
in the city, where he meets Frau Sommer (Mi
randa Richardson), who eventually wins his
heart.
Before he reaches this point, Graesler wavers
in his devotion to any one woman. While he
yearns for companionship, he constantly with
draws. Only when he abandons his search is he
able to find fulfillment and meet a woman's ad
vances with courage.
Quality acting complements Graesler's de
velopment from a self-centered single man to a
caring companion.
Kristin Scott-Thomas delivers the film's
most noteworthy performance as Sabine, a
headstrong, outspoken female, in contrast to
the passive women of her era.
Richardson, as Friedrike, deftly plays a
sullen elderly woman. In one scene she plays

with a knife at the dinner table, calmly drawing
blood from her thumb. Before her suicide, she
closes every door and window in the house in a
jarringly methodical way.
As Frau Sommer, Richardson is much more
sociable, inviting friends to tea and flirting with
the doctor. Without reading the credits, one
would never guess the same actress plays both
roles.
The cinematography and authentic sets en
hance the film's appeal. In the scene of
Friedrike's suicide, Faenza highlights the slow
swaying motion of her dead body, to create
eerie patterns of shadow.
With so many elements working so well in
this film, "The Bachelor" succeeds in portray
ing a single man's search for happiness in an in
teresting and moving way.
