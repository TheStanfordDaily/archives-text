## 'Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife': but some of us shall 
### Alison Amend 
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife. And
you shouldn't let your next door neighbor covet
yours. And never, ever agree to your neighbor's
wife-swapping scheme.
In Alan J. Pakula's new thriller "Consenting
Adults," two neighbors agree to swap wives for a
night, leading to an intricate murder plot.
Richard Parker (Kevin Kline) is a typical subur
ban husband whose stagnant marriage is given
new life through the arrival of his new neigh
bors. Meanwhile, Eddy Otis (Kevin Spacey) dri
ves out of a moving van in a red motorcycle and
plows full speed into Richard's life.
But what catches Richard's eye is his new
neighbor's wife. Katherine "but everybody calls
me Kay" Otis is beautiful but vapid. Actress Re
becca Miller does what she can to breathe life

into a character who ask nothing more compli
cated whether Richard has been faithful during
his 14 year marriage to Priscilla (Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio).
Eddy and Richard develop a close friendship.
Richard is repulsed when Eddy suggests they
switch wives. But after being accused — first by
Eddy and then by his own wife Priscilla — of not

taking risks, he begins to consider it and finally
agrees to the swap. However, a tragic murder
scheme intrudes on the game, changing their
idyllic lives.
"Consenting Adults" is a classic thriller in the
style of "Fatal Attraction." Director Alan Pakula
("Sophie's Choice," "Presumed Innocent")
shows fine cinematographic technique through
out the movie. He cuts brusquely from shot to
shot, adding to the suspense. His superb use of
lighting sets the mood well.
The sets also enhance the movie. The action
takes place near Anycity, USA, in an eerie Ed
ward Scissorhands-esque suburban neighbor
hood. The inside of the Parker's house is an
earthy green, while the Otis' is a lustful red.
What the movie lacks in dialogue and believ
ability it makes up for in suspense, helped most
ly by its excellent cast. The fine performance
turned in by Kevin Kline is not surprising con
sidering the dramatic talent he showed in his
most recent movie "Grand Canyon." There are
also enough comedic opportunities in the film
for him to show his lighter side.
Kevin Spacey as Eddy Otis plays a brilliant
psychopath, bringing credibility to a role
wrought with ambiguities. Forest Whitaker has
a supporting role as a private investigator.
Although it's a fairly commonplace thriller,
"Consenting Adults" is still a surprisingly enter
taining movie.
