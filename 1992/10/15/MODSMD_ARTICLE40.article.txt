## Second City all set for a side-splitting show 
### Elisabeth Witchell 
It won't be live from New York, but it will be
Saturday night.
The Second City Touring Company will
bring its biting satirical comedy to Stanford this
Saturday with "Economy of Errors."
And when it comes to improvisational com
edy, Second City is second to none.
The Chicago-based comedy group's list of
alumni sounds strikingly like a roll call of "Sat
urday Night Live" veterans: Gilda Radner, Dan
Aykroyd, Mike Myers.... Even SNL's skit ori
ented format has its humble origins in Second
City.
Second City features improvisational come
dy sketches, emphasizing social satire.

Second City has also produced the televised
comedy series SCTV witch it introduced John
Candy, Eugene and Rick Moranis to the
comedy world.
Stanford has already had a taste of their
unique brand of comedy. Their 1989 perfor
mance was a welcome tension-reliever follow
ing on the heels of the Loma Prieta Earth
quake.
Sponsored by The Lively Arts at Stanford,
Second City will perform at Memorial Audito
rium at 8 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 17. Tickets range
from $16 to $22, with $3 off for students.
