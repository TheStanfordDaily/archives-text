# COMEDY
## Second City all set for a side-splitting show 
### Elisabeth Witchell 
It won't be live from New York, but it will be
Saturday night.
The Second City Touring Company will
bring its biting satirical comedy to Stanford this
Saturday with "Economy of Errors."
And when it comes to improvisational com
edy, Second City is second to none.
