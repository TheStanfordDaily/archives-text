# OPERA
## It's not just for cultural elitists anymore. 
### Kimberly Chrisman 
Serious as it may seem, it's
hard to take opera seriously.
The very word "opera" con
jures up images of aging Fi
garos and overweight
Brunnhildes in cheesy Viking costumes.
Alternatively, it suggests long, dull
evenings spent in the company of over
dressed octogenarian elitists.

In fact, opera is more accessible now than
ever. An aria from "Madameßutterfly" turns
up in a DuPont carpet commercial. Julia
Roberts is swept away to a performance of "La
Traviata" in "Pretty Woman." Olympic figure
skaters habanera across the ice to the tune of
"Carmen." And who could forget all those Bugs
Bunny cartoons?
While most people have heard opera music or
seen it performed on TV, few have actually expe
rienced the real thing. But if you think you can't
afford it or won't understand it, think again.
Thanks to the recession, discounted tickets
are offered more frequently than ever, and,
thanks to supertitles, which translate foreign
operas on a screen above the stage, anyone can
follow along. It's a cultural high you can't get at
Gaieties or Max's Opera Cafe, and, with a little
effort, it can be yours.
Bravos, baritones and binoculars
Like baseball, hunting and hurricanes, opera

operates in seasons. Most companies present
opera in the fall and winter, although some
larger houses are effectively open year-round.
Operas are divided into arias (the musical
equivalent of the monologue), duets, trios and
so on, until the entire, throbbing chorus is on
stage. The heroine is usually a soprano; the
mezzo-soprano, her maid; the tenor, her lover;
the baritone, his valet or father; and the bass,
their sworn enemy.
Although some works incorporate spoken
text, or recitative, most opera is sung, and, yes,
it's usually sung in a foreign language. While
many contemporary operas are written in Eng
lish, most of the standard repertory is in Italian,
German or French, and translations, like
dubbed porno films, are scorned by purists.
Depending on where you're sitting, you'll
want to bring or rent opera glasses (like binoc
ulars, but with attitude) and dress up to some
degree. Truly formal attire is customarily re
served for opening night, and, considering that

most operas last about three to four
hours, including at least one intermis
sion, comfort is a priority.

The long stretch of music before the
curtain actually goes up is the overture.
The little box in the center of the stage is
the prompter's box, where the prompter
sits, feeding lines to the singers.
Don't be surprised if the singers take
curtain calls after each act, or if the con
ductor, orchestra and director decide to
join them. (At this point, it's acceptable
to shout "bravo" for a man, "brava" for a
woman or "bravi" for a group, as long as
you use the correct form. In fact, it's
even acceptable to boo.)
And don't be fooled by the pretty
music or mushy lyrics. Some of our most
beloved operas deal with — and even
glorify — such ballsy subjects as murder,
rape, suicide, disease, forced marriages,
insanity, incest and torture — usually
involving women.
If it's done right, opera is anything but
boring. Granted, it's not exactly PC, ei
ther, but many modern directors cir
cumvent this (and the boredom factor)
by updating characters and settings. A
tubercular heroine now dies of AIDS, a
nobleman's palazzo becomes Trump
Tower, a pastoral interlude is replaced
by a Caligula-esque orgy.
Rap and the repertory

Opera as we know it evolved from Greek
tragedy, which, as all CIV junkies know, was
largely chanted or sung. This has practical as
well as aesthetic reasons, since those ancient
arenas had terrible acoustics, and song carried
better than speech.
The same applies to medieval cathedrals,
where opera next surfaced in the form of litur
gical dramas. Opera was not available to the
masses until the late 16th century, when ama
teur musicians moved it out of the courts and
cathedrals and into the streets of Italy. The
newly-established art quickly became the most
popular form of entertainment in Europe.
In the absence of movies and television, so
cial and political debates were often acted out
on the operatic stage. In the 19th century, opera
became increasingly political, and composers
were often censored with the same vigilance as
today's rap artists
. Today's opera repertory is composed large
ly of those beloved classics which every compa
ny must perform in order to survive financial
ly. There is no single operatic plot — the cur
rent opera scene includes new and old works
based on the Bible, "The Aeneid," Shakespeare,
Sophocles, the Gold Rush and the Achille
Lauro hijacking.
Be prepared
In any case, past audiences were familiar
with the plots of their operas, and the modern
operagoer should make an effort to be, too. Un
like the musical theater, opera requires some
preparation in order to be fully appreciated. A
Sung text may carry well, but it's harder ff
to understand, even when it's in English. Li
Supertitles help, but they often give only K
the minimum amount of explanation r
needed to follow the plot. The language of I
opera is as beautiful as the music, and al- !
though you don't have to understand it to ~
enjoy it, you'll enjoy it more if you do.
Don't worry about spoiling the ending for
yourself. When the heroine dies at the end —
and she usually does — it's not supposed to be
a surprise. Opera, like the "Airplane!" movies,
is infinitely more entertaining when you know
what's coming.
While no two performances are alike, as any
true afficianado will tell you, seeing, hearing or
studying opera will make the second that much
easier to understand.
Unreality check
In addition to basic preparation, opera also
demands a certain suspension of belief. If opera
plots seem far-fetched, it's probably because, in
the words of W.H. Auden, "people do not sing
when they are feeling sensible."
But they do sing when they're dying, du
elling, dancing, gambling, sleepwalking, rot
ting in jail or being dragged down to Hell. It's
the job of the singers to make their characters
believable, and it's not an easy one.
Once upon a time, audiences were willing to
overlook a performer's physical inadequacies if
the singing was good enough. These days, how
ever, many operagoers are spoiled by film and
television, and expect singers to look like movie
stars, or at least to look like the characters
they're playing.
Smaller houses naturally place more impor
tance on physical appearance. But even large
houses have to be wary of a middle-aged "Sa
lome" or a grossly overfed "Boheme."
If it seems like all opera singers are aging and
overweight, it's probably because professional
singing careers rarely peak before the age of 45,
and powerful lungs and pliant chest and throat
muscles are necessary to sing the desired notes
at the required volume for a stretch of three to
four hours.
But the current opera scene is teeming with
young talent, including sopranos Cecilia Bar
toli and Ann Panagulias, directors Peter Sellars
and Francesca Zambello, tenor Greg Fedderly
and countertenor Brian Asawa, a twentysome
thing UC Santa Cruz alumnus who will appear
this season in the San Francisco Opera produc

1 tion of "A Midsummer
t Night's Dream."
s / <^ 112 / With the advent of air travel,
— opera is also becoming more
diverse than ever. Between the singers, conduc
tor, director and designer, a production can
span several continents and languages.
This diversity can make communication
problematic, not to mention casting. While in
terracial couples are generally accepted and
sometimes even necessary, as in "Otello," inter
racial families can be distracting.
Paying the piper
Opera is also more expensive than ever, both
to attend and to produce. At most major hous
es, top ticket prices average $100, with low av
erages of $30. Smaller houses range from $30 to
$50. And that's not including dinner, parking,
souvenir programs and drinks at intermission.
Where does the money go? Despite rising
singer's fees, most salaries go to permanent
staffers in administrative and production de
partments. Enormous sets must be rented, con
structed and fireproofed; coaches, choreogra
phers and costumers must be paid.
Thanks to the miracle of technology, opera

looks and sounds better
than ever. Wireless mikes
make up for faulty acoustics
in older houses, and entire
sets are designed and con
trolled by computers.
Singers get their musical
cues from the conductor via
closed-circuit TV, and per-

formances are broadcast around the world via
satellite.
But these amenities don't come cheap, and
they certainly aren't covered by ticket sales. In
the United States, only 35 percent of the costs
of mounting a single production are made up
in box office revenues. For the rest, companies
depend on corporate sponsorship, private do
nations and increasingly scarce federal funds.
But there's no need for students — or any
one else, for that matter — to pay full price for
opera tickets. The San Francisco Opera offers
discounted student subscriptions, student
rush seats for $20 and standing room for $6.
Palo Alto's West Bay Opera offers $15 tickets
to students, plus free previews at the Lucie
Stern Community Theater. Most professional
companies offer similar discounts.

woman or "bravi" for a group, as long as
you use the correct form. In fact, it's
even acceptable to boo.)
And don't be fooled by the pretty
music or mushy lyrics. Some of our most
beloved operas deal with — and even
glorify — such ballsy subjects as murder,
rape, suicide, disease, forced marriages,
insanity, incest and torture — usually
involving women.
If it's done right, opera is anything but
boring. Granted, it's not exactly PC, ei
ther, but many modern directors cir
cumvent this (and the boredom factor)
by updating characters and settings. A
tubercular heroine now dies of AIDS, a
nobleman's palazzo becomes Trump
Tower, a pastoral interlude is replaced
by a Caligula-esque orgy.
Rap and the repertory

Opera as we know it evolved from Greek
tragedy, which, as all CIV junkies know, was
largely chanted or sung. This has practical as
well as aesthetic reasons, since those ancient
arenas had terrible acoustics, and song carried
better than speech.
The same applies to medieval cathedrals,
where opera next surfaced in the form of litur
gical dramas. Opera was not available to the
masses until the late 16th century, when ama
teur musicians moved it out of the courts and
cathedrals and into the streets of Italy. The
newly-established art quickly became the most
popular form of entertainment in Europe.
In the absence of movies and television, so
cial and political debates were often acted out
on the operatic stage. In the 19th century, opera
became increasingly political, and composers
were often censored with the same vigilance as
today's rap artists
. Today's opera repertory is composed large
ly of those beloved classics which every compa
ny must perform in order to survive financial
ly. There is no single operatic plot — the cur
rent opera scene includes new and old works
based on the Bible, "The Aeneid," Shakespeare,
Sophocles, the Gold Rush and the Achille
Lauro hijacking.
Be prepared
In any case, past audiences were familiar
with the plots of their operas, and the modern
operagoer should make an effort to be, too. Un
like the musical theater, opera requires some
preparation in order to be fully appreciated. A
Sung text may carry well, but it's harder ff
to understand, even when it's in English. Li
Supertitles help, but they often give only K
the minimum amount of explanation r
needed to follow the plot. The language of I
opera is as beautiful as the music, and al- !
though you don't have to understand it to ~
enjoy it, you'll enjoy it more if you do.
Don't worry about spoiling the ending for
yourself. When the heroine dies at the end —
and she usually does — it's not supposed to be
a surprise. Opera, like the "Airplane!" movies,
is infinitely more entertaining when you know
what's coming.
While no two performances are alike, as any
true afficianado will tell you, seeing, hearing or
studying opera will make the second that much
easier to understand.
Unreality check
In addition to basic preparation, opera also
demands a certain suspension of belief. If opera
plots seem far-fetched, it's probably because, in
the words of W.H. Auden, "people do not sing
when they are feeling sensible."
But they do sing when they're dying, du
elling, dancing, gambling, sleepwalking, rot
ting in jail or being dragged down to Hell. It's
the job of the singers to make their characters
believable, and it's not an easy one.
Once upon a time, audiences were willing to
overlook a performer's physical inadequacies if
the singing was good enough. These days, how
ever, many operagoers are spoiled by film and
television, and expect singers to look like movie
stars, or at least to look like the characters
they're playing.
Smaller houses naturally place more impor
tance on physical appearance. But even large
houses have to be wary of a middle-aged "Sa
lome" or a grossly overfed "Boheme."
If it seems like all opera singers are aging and
overweight, it's probably because professional
singing careers rarely peak before the age of 45,
and powerful lungs and pliant chest and throat
muscles are necessary to sing the desired notes
at the required volume for a stretch of three to
four hours.
But the current opera scene is teeming with
young talent, including sopranos Cecilia Bar
toli and Ann Panagulias, directors Peter Sellars
and Francesca Zambello, tenor Greg Fedderly
and countertenor Brian Asawa, a twentysome
thing UC Santa Cruz alumnus who will appear
this season in the San Francisco Opera produc

1 tion of "A Midsummer
t Night's Dream."
s / <^ 112 / With the advent of air travel,
— opera is also becoming more
diverse than ever. Between the singers, conduc
tor, director and designer, a production can
span several continents and languages.
This diversity can make communication
problematic, not to mention casting. While in
terracial couples are generally accepted and
sometimes even necessary, as in "Otello," inter
racial families can be distracting.
Paying the piper
Opera is also more expensive than ever, both
to attend and to produce. At most major hous
es, top ticket prices average $100, with low av
erages of $30. Smaller houses range from $30 to
$50. And that's not including dinner, parking,
souvenir programs and drinks at intermission.
Where does the money go? Despite rising
singer's fees, most salaries go to permanent
staffers in administrative and production de
partments. Enormous sets must be rented, con
structed and fireproofed; coaches, choreogra
phers and costumers must be paid.
Thanks to the miracle of technology, opera

looks and sounds better
than ever. Wireless mikes
make up for faulty acoustics
in older houses, and entire
sets are designed and con
trolled by computers.
Singers get their musical
cues from the conductor via
closed-circuit TV, and per-

formances are broadcast around the world via
satellite.
But these amenities don't come cheap, and
they certainly aren't covered by ticket sales. In
the United States, only 35 percent of the costs
of mounting a single production are made up
in box office revenues. For the rest, companies
depend on corporate sponsorship, private do
nations and increasingly scarce federal funds.
But there's no need for students — or any
one else, for that matter — to pay full price for
opera tickets. The San Francisco Opera offers
discounted student subscriptions, student
rush seats for $20 and standing room for $6.
Palo Alto's West Bay Opera offers $15 tickets
to students, plus free previews at the Lucie
Stern Community Theater. Most professional
companies offer similar discounts.


Serious as it may seem, it's
hard to take opera seriously.
The very word "opera" con
jures up images of aging Fi
garos and overweight
Brunnhildes in cheesy Viking costumes.
Alternatively, it suggests long, dull
evenings spent in the company of over
dressed octogenarian elitists.

In fact, opera is more accessible now than
ever. An aria from "Madameßutterfly" turns
up in a DuPont carpet commercial. Julia
Roberts is swept away to a performance of "La
Traviata" in "Pretty Woman." Olympic figure
skaters habanera across the ice to the tune of
"Carmen." And who could forget all those Bugs
Bunny cartoons?
While most people have heard opera music or
seen it performed on TV, few have actually expe
rienced the real thing. But if you think you can't
afford it or won't understand it, think again.
Thanks to the recession, discounted tickets
are offered more frequently than ever, and,
thanks to supertitles, which translate foreign
operas on a screen above the stage, anyone can
follow along. It's a cultural high you can't get at
Gaieties or Max's Opera Cafe, and, with a little
effort, it can be yours.
Bravos, baritones and binoculars
Like baseball, hunting and hurricanes, opera

operates in seasons. Most companies present
opera in the fall and winter, although some
larger houses are effectively open year-round.
Operas are divided into arias (the musical
equivalent of the monologue), duets, trios and
so on, until the entire, throbbing chorus is on
stage. The heroine is usually a soprano; the
mezzo-soprano, her maid; the tenor, her lover;
the baritone, his valet or father; and the bass,
their sworn enemy.
Although some works incorporate spoken
text, or recitative, most opera is sung, and, yes,
it's usually sung in a foreign language. While
many contemporary operas are written in Eng
lish, most of the standard repertory is in Italian,
German or French, and translations, like
dubbed porno films, are scorned by purists.
Depending on where you're sitting, you'll
want to bring or rent opera glasses (like binoc
ulars, but with attitude) and dress up to some
degree. Truly formal attire is customarily re
served for opening night, and, considering that

most operas last about three to four
hours, including at least one intermis
sion, comfort is a priority.

The long stretch of music before the
curtain actually goes up is the overture.
The little box in the center of the stage is
the prompter's box, where the prompter
sits, feeding lines to the singers.
Don't be surprised if the singers take
curtain calls after each act, or if the con
ductor, orchestra and director decide to
join them. (At this point, it's acceptable
to shout "bravo" for a man, "brava" for a
woman or "bravi" for a group, as long as
you use the correct form. In fact, it's

While no two performances are alike, as any
true afficianado will tell you, seeing, hearing or
studying opera will make the second that much
easier to understand.
Unreality check
In addition to basic preparation, opera also
demands a certain suspension of belief. If opera
plots seem far-fetched, it's probably because, in
the words of W.H. Auden, "people do not sing
when they are feeling sensible."
But they do sing when they're dying, du
elling, dancing, gambling, sleepwalking, rot
ting in jail or being dragged down to Hell. It's
the job of the singers to make their characters
believable, and it's not an easy one.
Once upon a time, audiences were willing to
overlook a performer's physical inadequacies if
the singing was good enough. These days, how
ever, many operagoers are spoiled by film and
television, and expect singers to look like movie
stars, or at least to look like the characters
they're playing.
Smaller houses naturally place more impor
tance on physical appearance. But even large
houses have to be wary of a middle-aged "Sa
lome" or a grossly overfed "Boheme."
If it seems like all opera singers are aging and
overweight, it's probably because professional
singing careers rarely peak before the age of 45,
and powerful lungs and pliant chest and throat
muscles are necessary to sing the desired notes
at the required volume for a stretch of three to
four hours.
But the current opera scene is teeming with
young talent, including sopranos Cecilia Bar
toli and Ann Panagulias, directors Peter Sellars
and Francesca Zambello, tenor Greg Fedderly
and countertenor Brian Asawa, a twentysome
thing UC Santa Cruz alumnus who will appear
this season in the San Francisco Opera produc

t Night's Dream."
s / <^ 112 / With the advent of air travel,
— opera is also becoming more
diverse than ever. Between the singers, conduc
tor, director and designer, a production can
span several continents and languages.
This diversity can make communication
problematic, not to mention casting. While in
terracial couples are generally accepted and
sometimes even necessary, as in "Otello," inter
racial families can be distracting.
Paying the piper
Opera is also more expensive than ever, both
to attend and to produce. At most major hous
es, top ticket prices average $100, with low av
erages of $30. Smaller houses range from $30 to
$50. And that's not including dinner, parking,
souvenir programs and drinks at intermission.
Where does the money go? Despite rising
singer's fees, most salaries go to permanent
staffers in administrative and production de
partments. Enormous sets must be rented, con
structed and fireproofed; coaches, choreogra
phers and costumers must be paid.
Thanks to the miracle of technology, opera

looks and sounds better
than ever. Wireless mikes
make up for faulty acoustics
in older houses, and entire
sets are designed and con
trolled by computers.
Singers get their musical
cues from the conductor via
closed-circuit TV, and per-

formances are broadcast around the world via
satellite.
But these amenities don't come cheap, and
they certainly aren't covered by ticket sales. In
the United States, only 35 percent of the costs
of mounting a single production are made up
in box office revenues. For the rest, companies
depend on corporate sponsorship, private do
nations and increasingly scarce federal funds.
But there's no need for students — or any
one else, for that matter — to pay full price for
opera tickets. The San Francisco Opera offers
discounted student subscriptions, student
rush seats for $20 and standing room for $6.
Palo Alto's West Bay Opera offers $15 tickets
to students, plus free previews at the Lucie
Stern Community Theater. Most professional
companies offer similar discounts.


Serious as it may seem, it's
hard to take opera seriously.
The very word "opera" con
jures up images of aging Fi
garos and overweight
Brunnhildes in cheesy Viking costumes.
Alternatively, it suggests long, dull
evenings spent in the company of over
dressed octogenarian elitists.

In fact, opera is more accessible now than
ever. An aria from "Madameßutterfly" turns
up in a DuPont carpet commercial. Julia
Roberts is swept away to a performance of "La
Traviata" in "Pretty Woman." Olympic figure
skaters habanera across the ice to the tune of
"Carmen." And who could forget all those Bugs
Bunny cartoons?
While most people have heard opera music or
seen it performed on TV, few have actually expe
rienced the real thing. But if you think you can't
afford it or won't understand it, think again.
Thanks to the recession, discounted tickets
are offered more frequently than ever, and,
thanks to supertitles, which translate foreign
operas on a screen above the stage, anyone can
follow along. It's a cultural high you can't get at
Gaieties or Max's Opera Cafe, and, with a little
effort, it can be yours.
Bravos, baritones and binoculars
Like baseball, hunting and hurricanes, opera

operates in seasons. Most companies present
opera in the fall and winter, although some
larger houses are effectively open year-round.
Operas are divided into arias (the musical
equivalent of the monologue), duets, trios and
so on, until the entire, throbbing chorus is on
stage. The heroine is usually a soprano; the
mezzo-soprano, her maid; the tenor, her lover;
the baritone, his valet or father; and the bass,
their sworn enemy.
Although some works incorporate spoken
text, or recitative, most opera is sung, and, yes,
it's usually sung in a foreign language. While
many contemporary operas are written in Eng
lish, most of the standard repertory is in Italian,
German or French, and translations, like
dubbed porno films, are scorned by purists.
Depending on where you're sitting, you'll
want to bring or rent opera glasses (like binoc
ulars, but with attitude) and dress up to some
degree. Truly formal attire is customarily re
served for opening night, and, considering that

most operas last about three to four
hours, including at least one intermis
sion, comfort is a priority.

The long stretch of music before the
curtain actually goes up is the overture.
The little box in the center of the stage is
the prompter's box, where the prompter
sits, feeding lines to the singers.
Don't be surprised if the singers take
curtain calls after each act, or if the con
ductor, orchestra and director decide to
join them. (At this point, it's acceptable
to shout "bravo" for a man, "brava" for a
woman or "bravi" for a group, as long as
you use the correct form. In fact, it's
even acceptable to boo.)
And don't be fooled by the pretty
music or mushy lyrics. Some of our most
beloved operas deal with — and even
glorify — such ballsy subjects as murder,
rape, suicide, disease, forced marriages,
insanity, incest and torture — usually
involving women.
If it's done right, opera is anything but
boring. Granted, it's not exactly PC, ei
ther, but many modern directors cir
cumvent this (and the boredom factor)
by updating characters and settings. A
tubercular heroine now dies of AIDS, a
nobleman's palazzo becomes Trump
Tower, a pastoral interlude is replaced
by a Caligula-esque orgy.
Rap and the repertory

Opera as we know it evolved from Greek
tragedy, which, as all CIV junkies know, was
largely chanted or sung. This has practical as
well as aesthetic reasons, since those ancient
arenas had terrible acoustics, and song carried
better than speech.
The same applies to medieval cathedrals,
where opera next surfaced in the form of litur
gical dramas. Opera was not available to the
masses until the late 16th century, when ama
teur musicians moved it out of the courts and
cathedrals and into the streets of Italy. The
newly-established art quickly became the most
popular form of entertainment in Europe.
In the absence of movies and television, so
cial and political debates were often acted out
on the operatic stage. In the 19th century, opera
became increasingly political, and composers
were often censored with the same vigilance as
today's rap artists
. Today's opera repertory is composed large
ly of those beloved classics which every compa
ny must perform in order to survive financial
ly. There is no single operatic plot — the cur
rent opera scene includes new and old works
based on the Bible, "The Aeneid," Shakespeare,
Sophocles, the Gold Rush and the Achille
Lauro hijacking.
Be prepared
In any case, past audiences were familiar
with the plots of their operas, and the modern
operagoer should make an effort to be, too. Un
like the musical theater, opera requires some
preparation in order to be fully appreciated. A
Sung text may carry well, but it's harder ff
to understand, even when it's in English. Li
Supertitles help, but they often give only K
the minimum amount of explanation r
needed to follow the plot. The language of I
opera is as beautiful as the music, and al- !
though you don't have to understand it to ~
enjoy it, you'll enjoy it more if you do.
Don't worry about spoiling the ending for
yourself. When the heroine dies at the end —
and she usually does — it's not supposed to be
a surprise. Opera, like the "Airplane!" movies,
is infinitely more entertaining when you know
what's coming.
While no two performances are alike, as any
true afficianado will tell you, seeing, hearing or
studying opera will make the second that much
easier to understand.
