# Fidelio flourishes at SF Opera

### Kimberly Chrisman Editorial staff 
The ecstasies and idiosyncrasies of opera are illus
trated in "Fidelio," the San Francisco Opera's latest
offering. Beethoven's only opera, "Fidelio" is one of
those timeless masterpieces in which the heroine
manages to pass herself off as a man, despite her re
splendent soprano voice.
Feisty Lenore sets out to rescue her husband Flo
restan, a Spanish nobleman unjustly imprisoned for
two years in an imposing, gray fortress that makes
the barricade from "Les Miserables" look like kin
dling. John Gunter designed the set, which is every
bit as dramatic as Beethoven's music.
Disguised as a young man named Fidelio, our
heroine ingratiates herself with Rocco, the kindly
jailer. In doing this she inadvertently attracts the at

tentions of his daughter, Marzelline.

She eventually reveals her true identity and
saves her husband from death at the hands of the
wicked governor, Pizarro. The couple emerges
from Florestan's subterranean dungeon to a re
sounding chorus of thanks and praise. Everyone
lives happily ever after, except Pizarro and possibly
Marzelline.
Hildegard Behrens is appropriately heroic in the
title role. As Florestan, full-figured Gary Lakes cer
tainly doesn't look like he's been wasting away in
prison for two years, but all qualms are forgotten
once he starts singing.
Ann Panagulias displays acting talents equal to
her considerable vocal gifts, singing Marzelline for
the first time. Michael Schade is also sympathetic as
her spurned suitor, Jacquino.
