## Bob Marley lives on in Wailing Souls' reggae 
### N'Gai Croal Staff writer N'Gai Croal Staff writer 
Another in a long line of bands to emerge
from the legendary Trench Town district of
Kingston, Jamaica, the Wailing Souls learned
their craft on the front lines — with brethren
Bob Marley.
Wailing Souls members Lloyd "Bread"
Mac Donald, Winston "Pipe" Matthews and
Marley shared the same singing teacher, reggae
pioneer Joe Higgs.
"Sometimes we used to go out and sing," re
called Mac Donald, "just me, Pipe, Bob and Joe
Higgs. Our older master would come around
and say, 'So and so is not right,' but it wasn't
like real lessons."
Becoming professional musicians was not
part of their original plan. "We were still going
to school," said Matthews, "but there was so
much music going on around us that we tried
to go out and do something at that time. We
didn't take it that seriously. It wasn't a business,
it was just like we had it in us and we were try
ing to get it out."
The musicians'jam sessions in Jamaica were
very laid back. "We were just there singing, be
cause singing was a great pastime," Mac Donald
said. "Whenever you have the Wailers or Joe
Higgs, you always have maybe 12 other guys
singing also. So splinters came out of these
things — guys got together and formed a
group."
Since "Wailing" was the word du jour, Mar
ley's group initially called itself the Wailing
Rudeboys. Mac Donald and Matthew's group

— originally a quartet — tcx>k the name Wail

They also recorded as the Classics, Pipe and
the Pipers, and the Renegades before establish
ing themselves as the Wailing Souls. On Mar
ley's Tough Gong label, they recorded such hits
as "Harbor Shark" and "Backbiters."
After Marley exploded into superstardom,
the Souls briefly joined former teacher Joe
Higgs in a group called Atarra. The Souls also
recorded a series of albums and singles, gener
ating several number one hits throughout the

This weekend, Golden Gate Park will
come alive with the sounds of Reggae, Ca
lypso and World Beat music at "Reggae In
The Park: Rhythms Of The World."
The various festivities will include a cul
tural showcase complete with arts, crafts
and "theme cuisine" from around the
world.
But the biggest attraction is the music.
Local favorites include Zulu Spear, a group
with South African rhythms with American
rock-and-roll, Kotoja, a traditional Afro-
Nigerian groups and D'Cuckoo, a band with
cutting-edge tribal world funk.
And making its first ever mainland ap
pearance is Hawaii's Ho' Aikane. Their
music can be described as "Jawaiian" — an

late '70s and early '80s.
The group then relocated to Los Angeles,
where Mac Donald and Matthews met produc
ers Richard Feldman and I>ee Jaffe. Jaffe, who
worked with Marley and produced albums for
Peter Tosh and Joe Higgs, produced a Wailing
Souls demo tape and sent it to Columbia
Records. At Columbia, they landed their pre
sent contract and recorded their album "All
Over the World."
"All Over the World," borrows and fuses
music from around the world: reggae, hip-hop,

eclectic mix of native island rhythms with
Jamaican reggae beats.
The entertainment lineup also includes
The Itals, a classic Jamaican reggae trio;
Manazart (formerly Brave New World), a
dance-oriented group whose music com
bines reggae, pop and rock-and-roll; Foula,
which fuses Haiti's traditional voodoo ry
thms with a cerebral jazz element; and All
Ah We, a festive Caribbean dance troupe.
The festival closes with the Los Angeles
based group, Wailing Souls, fresh from their
recent appearance on "The Tonight Show"
with Jay Leno.
Proceeds from "Reggae In The Park" will
benefit Global Exchange, a non-profit re
search, education and action centcr dedicat
ed to building people-to-people ties be
tween developed and developing nations
based on the spirit of internationalism.

'60s soul and rhythm-and-blues.
The list of contributing artists on their
album is equally diverse. There are Jamaicans:
the legendary U-Roy and bassist Flabba Holt.
There is an East Indian: drummer L Shankar.
Most famous are the American talents: N'Dea
Davenport of the Brand New Heavies, and
Snap's Penny Ford.
Although based in Los Angeles, Matthews
said he feels that Wailing Souls gets more radio
support back East and in the Midwest. But
Matthews has nothing but praise for college
radio and its student listeners; in fact, the Wail
ing Souls' first American performance was at
UC Berkeley.
"I always go for the students," said
Matthews. "They really feel the music."
Matthews credited Columbia for not pres
suring the group to cross over to mainstream
audiences. "People approached us, saying we
needed something different, and we felt the
music had stagnated."
But, Matthews said dancehall music didn't
interest the group because they found that true
reggae lovers didn't like dancehall. "So we
joined hip-hop because that was a good vibe...
.to see how people would react.
"We try to give every song a different flavor,
because we want to reach everyone."
Mac Donald agree, saying, "We don't really
have boundaries."
But the Wailing Souls will never abandon
their musical origins. "If a tree loses it roots,"
said Matthews, "it will die."
He added, "Reggae is the only music that
you don't have to make a dance for — you can
jump, skip, hop... .anything to it."

music from around the world: reggae, hip-hop,

eclectic mix of native island rhythms with
Jamaican reggae beats.
The entertainment lineup also includes
The Itals, a classic Jamaican reggae trio;
Manazart (formerly Brave New World), a
dance-oriented group whose music com
bines reggae, pop and rock-and-roll; Foula,
which fuses Haiti's traditional voodoo ry

Ah We, a festive Caribbean dance troupe.
The festival closes with the Los Angeles
based group, Wailing Souls, fresh from their
recent appearance on "The Tonight Show"
with Jay Leno.

'60s soul and rhythm-and-blues.
The list of contributing artists on their
album is equally diverse. There are Jamaicans:
the legendary U-Roy and bassist Flabba Holt.
There is an East Indian: drummer L Shankar.
Most famous are the American talents: N'Dea
Davenport of the Brand New Heavies, and
Snap's Penny Ford.
Although based in Los Angeles, Matthews
said he feels that Wailing Souls gets more radio
support back East and in the Midwest. But
Matthews has nothing but praise for college
radio and its student listeners; in fact, the Wail
ing Souls' first American performance was at
UC Berkeley.
"I always go for the students," said
Matthews. "They really feel the music."
Matthews credited Columbia for not pres
suring the group to cross over to mainstream
audiences. "People approached us, saying we
needed something different, and we felt the
music had stagnated."
But, Matthews said dancehall music didn't
interest the group because they found that true
reggae lovers didn't like dancehall. "So we
joined hip-hop because that was a good vibe...
.to see how people would react.
"We try to give every song a different flavor,
because we want to reach everyone."
Mac Donald agree, saying, "We don't really
have boundaries."
But the Wailing Souls will never abandon
their musical origins. "If a tree loses it roots,"
said Matthews, "it will die."
He added, "Reggae is the only music that
you don't have to make a dance for — you can
jump, skip, hop... .anything to it."

Another in a long line of bands to emerge
from the legendary Trench Town district of
Kingston, Jamaica, the Wailing Souls learned
their craft on the front lines — with brethren
Bob Marley.
Wailing Souls members Lloyd "Bread"
Mac Donald, Winston "Pipe" Matthews and
Marley shared the same singing teacher, reggae
pioneer Joe Higgs.
"Sometimes we used to go out and sing," re
called Mac Donald, "just me, Pipe, Bob and Joe
Higgs. Our older master would come around
and say, 'So and so is not right,' but it wasn't
like real lessons."
Becoming professional musicians was not
part of their original plan. "We were still going
to school," said Matthews, "but there was so
much music going on around us that we tried
to go out and do something at that time. We
didn't take it that seriously. It wasn't a business,
it was just like we had it in us and we were try
ing to get it out."
The musicians'jam sessions in Jamaica were
very laid back. "We were just there singing, be
cause singing was a great pastime," Mac Donald
said. "Whenever you have the Wailers or Joe
Higgs, you always have maybe 12 other guys
singing also. So splinters came out of these
things — guys got together and formed a
group."
Since "Wailing" was the word du jour, Mar
ley's group initially called itself the Wailing
Rudeboys. Mac Donald and Matthew's group

This weekend, Golden Gate Park will
come alive with the sounds of Reggae, Ca
lypso and World Beat music at "Reggae In
The Park: Rhythms Of The World."
The various festivities will include a cul
tural showcase complete with arts, crafts
and "theme cuisine" from around the
world.
But the biggest attraction is the music.
Local favorites include Zulu Spear, a group
with South African rhythms with American
rock-and-roll, Kotoja, a traditional Afro-
Nigerian groups and D'Cuckoo, a band with
cutting-edge tribal world funk.
And making its first ever mainland ap
pearance is Hawaii's Ho' Aikane. Their
music can be described as "Jawaiian" — an

late '70s and early '80s.
The group then relocated to Los Angeles,
where Mac Donald and Matthews met produc
ers Richard Feldman and I>ee Jaffe. Jaffe, who
worked with Marley and produced albums for
Peter Tosh and Joe Higgs, produced a Wailing

Records. At Columbia, they landed their pre
