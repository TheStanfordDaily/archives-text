## MUSIC 'What Hits!?': Hot Chili Peppers dish out the spice 
### Victor Haseman 
Crewd. Lewd. Disorderly. Thrash. Punk.
Just a few of the words regularly employed
by the media in descriptions of the Red Hot
Chili Peppers and their brand of knucklehead
ed, semi-melodic expressionism.
But lose the juvenile tomfoolery and the
crass sexual innuendo, and what's left is clas
sic funk: that thick, rich delicacy prepared ever
so lovingly by the likes of Miles Davis, George
Clinton and P-Funk, the Meters and James
Brown.
Unfortunately, their devotion to maintain
ing the integrity of the punk-funk aesthetic
managed to keep the group in relative obscuri
ty far too long.
It wasn't until their fifth release, "Blood
Sugar Sex Magik" (1991), that Flea (Michael
Balzary), vocalist Anthony Kiedis, guitarist
John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith
were able to stake a real claim in "pop" coun
try.
The LP exists as a near flawless fusion of
funk, lyrics and punk/thrash — a manifesto, if
you will, that "declares allegiance" to the vari
ous music forms unified in the fabrication of a
composite Chili Pepper sound.
"Blood Sugar Sex Magik," however,
wouldn't have been possible without the

band's past recordings, "Red Hot Chili Pep
pers" (1984), "Freaky Styley" (1985), The Up
lift Mofo Party Plan," "The Abbey Road EP"
(1987) and "Mother's Milk" (1989). These al
bums showcase the musical elements that are
so important to their "manifesto."
For those listeners interested in the band's
development but unwilling to invest the small
fortune needed to own the complete Pepper
collection, the "What Hits!?" compilation pre
sents a viable alternative.
After opening with a Stevie Wonder cover,
"Higher Ground" — a pounding head-bobber
with fist fulls of gravelly base and bluesy guitar
riffs — the album scuffles along in a casually
chronological progression.
A series of robust arrangements, the first
half relies heavily upon traditional punk-rock
conventions: a brisk tempo, a raspy, wailing
lead guitar and dry, uninventive modulations
of the rhythm section.
Of course, Kiedis' unusual mixture of dis
sonant vocals and hip-hop rhyming reminis
cent of "old school" rap legend Grand Master
Flash, help to spice things up.
But the album's second set better displays
the Red Hot's funked-up, jagged sound.
It is a sound so rhythmically hard it perme
ates a room with the distinct aroma of hip-hop
sampledom, a sound so sporadically invigorat -
ing it infuses even the most subdued spaces
with nervous energy. It accomplishes all of this
and yet still reaches Top 40 listeners.
In "Show Me Your Soul" Frusciante's bare
ly audible "phunky chickened" guitar inten
tionally aggravates the bullyish rifts of Flea's
