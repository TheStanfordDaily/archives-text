# Violin in hand, Perlman plays Mem Aud
## 
### Amy McConnell Editorial staff 
Scores of accolades have been
written of world-renowned violinist
Itzhak Perlman — but none has cap
tured Perlman's genius quite so suc
cinctly as did "Sesame Street."
In one of their typically pithy
skits, PBS shows a young girl trying
to play the violin, as Perlman — who
lost the use of his legs at age four in a
bout with polio — attempts walking
up the stairs. The skit, meant to
demonstrate the meaning of the
word "difficult," highlights Perl
man's unusual struggles and talents.
But Perlman, who will perform at
Memorial Auditorium this Wednes
day, refuses to wax sentimental
about his own success story and in
sists that polio had nothing to do
with his musical success. "I played
the violin despite my polio, not be
cause of it,"he says."I loved music."
His self-told history is no Ameri
can dream saga of hard work under
adversity. "Genius is something you
cannot acquire just by working," he
says. Countering the age-old homily
about 1 percent inspiration and 99
percent perspiration, he says, "You
need a bit more inspiration or natur
al talent than just one percent."
And Perlman has plenty of it.
Born in 1945 in Tel Aviv to immi
grant parents from eastern Europe,
he began playing the violin when he
was four. At age 10, after training at
the Academy of Music in Tel Aviv, he
began giving public recitals and

broadcast concerts.
It was an American tour with
"The Ed Sullivan Show" in 1958 that
propelled Perlman to international
fame. "Sullivan made a show about
Israeli people, and dedicated it to
artists," Perlman recalls. "There was
an Israeli dancer, a singer, duo-pi
anists, a person who did shadow
graphing of political personalities
and me."
Perlman says his first trip outside
Israel was an exciting but scary event.
"It was difficult leaving my friends
behind. I certainly missed Israel but
was very excited to come back."
Six years later he was still in Amer
ica. His family joined him, settling in
New York's Upper West side so that
Perlman could continue his studies at
the Juilliard School. He supported his
family by performing — usually for
small Jewish charity functions.
By 1965, Perlman was participat
ing in world tours, performing with
every major orchestra and conduc
tor. Beginning in 1975, he also taught
at Brooklyn College.
"Teaching teaches the teacher,"
he said, "especially when the teacher
is actively playing... .1 could use a
little teaching myself."
Today concerts are Perlman's
full-time job. One of his most note
worthy tours was to Russia two years
ago, when "for the first time it wasn't
the Soviet Union anymore."
But Perlman enjoys every one of
his tours, be it in Europe, Australia,
South America, the Far East or, of
course, Israel.

"It's very busy there's a lot of
travelling, a lot of time away from
home but if you like music, it
gives you a lot of pleasure."
Perlman's repertoire is as broad as
his travels. He used to play mostly
Romantic virtuoso music, because
"that's what everybody wanted me to
do in the beginning, to leave the clas
sical repertory to older people," he
says with a touch of sarcasm.
Later on he moved into the realm
of classical music, which he finds
more challenging. "I love and play
everyone: Brahms, Bach, Mozart."
Perlman says he enjoys the expe
rience of interpreting each compos
er. "Despite your own individuality
you should figure out what the com
poser wanted."
But it is Perlman's personal voice
that makes his music so great. "Ex
pressing yourself in music is the way
you feel yourself. It's silly to hide the
way you feel. That's what I do in my
music — to communicate it,"he says.
Perlman's performance, spon
sored by The Lively Arts at Stanford,
will also feature Janet Goodman
Guggenheim on piano.
Perlman met Guggenheim when
she played for one of his teacher's
classes. "I loved the way she played,"
Perlman says."For one west coast
concert I invited her to play for me; it
was silly to bring my pianist all the
way across the country.
The performance will take placc at
8 p. m. on Oct. 21. The repertoire will
include a Bach sonata and two Schu
bert pieces.
