# Sinead sings the classics with a twist
## 
### Daphne Kwong 
Sinead O'Connor doesn't try to please
everybody. In a recent appearance on "Satur
day Night Live," the Irish singer infuriated
many Roman Catholic groups as she tore a
photo of Pope John Paul II into shreds. "Fight
the real enemy," O'Connor said.
O'Connor's latest album "Am I Not Your
Girl?" also demonstrates that she isn't interest
ed in appeasing the masses. A dramatic depar
ture from her two previous albums, "The Lion
and the Cobra" and"I Do Not Want What I
Haven't Got," her new album may alienate for
mer fans.
"Am I Not Your Girl?" consists of 11 songs,
an instrumental and a monologue. Since all 11
songs are covers of stage and movie tunes, the
only material written by O'Connor is her
monologue. Musically, the songs remain faith
ful to their original versions. But O'Connor de
livers her vocals in a different manner than the
original singers do, attempting to infuse the
old songs with a new vigor.
O'Connor's straightforward rendition of "I
Want to Be Loved By You" contrasts with the
coyly flirtatious version made famous by Mar
ilyn Monroe. By singing it in an undcrstited
fashion, O'Connor shows that she is no sex toy.
In fact, O'Connor finishes the song with an at
titude bordering on indifference.
Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Don't Cry for Me
Argentina" becomes a plaintive cry for for
giveness. Singing quietly, O'Connor makes a
pointed departure from the bombastic quality
of the original.
O'Connor delivers the album's strongest
track with her rendition of Julie London's
"Why Don't You Do Right," an infectiously

catchy tune with O'Connor's cool delivery. It's
easy to imagine her on stage in a nightclub,
backed by a big band as she growls, "Why don't
you do right like some other men do." She or
ders her lover, "Just get out of here and get me
some money too."

O'Connor's straightforward
rendition of 'I Want to Be
Loved By You' contrasts with
the coyly flirtatious version
made famous by Marilyn Mon
roe. By singing it in an under
stated fashion, O'Connor
shows that she is no sex toy.

With Ella Fitzgerald's "Bewitched, Bothered
and Bewildered," O'Connor shifts vocal gears:
the strong woman transforms into a vulnerable
female. Her voice becomes sweet and tender as
she sings about "the day when I'll cling to him."
In her version of Loretta Lynn's "Success
Has Made A Failure of Our Home," O'Connor
asks, "Am I not your girl?" At first she asks ten
tatively but then turns the question into an ac
cusation. Finally, she desperately asks, "Am 1
not your girl?" as if in tired defeat.
While the lush orchestral arrangements
help bring the album to life, the music at times
threatens to drown the singer's voice. In "Suc
threatens to drown the singer's voice. In
"Success Has Made a Failure of Our Home,"
the'music overwhelms O'Connor's voice
until she starts singing louder midway
through the song.
In her only original composition on the
album, O'Connor delivers a monologue
condemning the Holy Roman Empire.
"They told us lies to take us away from
God," she accuses. "But I'm not full of hate.
I'm full of love. God said, 'I bring not peace.
I bring a sword.'"
By following her number one album — "I
Do Not Want What I Haven't Got" — with
an album full of covers of mostly mid-centu
ry songs, O'Connor seems to be shooting
herself in the foot.
None of the songs on "Am I Not Your
Girl" has the accessibility of "Nothing Com
pares to You."
Many of her fans probably aren't famil
iar with the original songs on this album,
and the lack of background makes this
album difficult to listen to. Those who
know the showtunes by heart may think
differently.
The album does have its merits, though.
In covering such a wide range of songs, she
displays great versatility.

And her effort to reinterpret these classics
is valiant. O'Connor sings the songs as an ex
pression of her own feelings, and that gives
them a whole new meaning.

monologue. Musically, the songs remain faith
ful to their original versions. But O'Connor de
livers her vocals in a different manner than the
original singers do, attempting to infuse the
old songs with a new vigor.
O'Connor's straightforward rendition of "I
Want to Be Loved By You" contrasts with the
coyly flirtatious version made famous by Mar
ilyn Monroe. By singing it in an undcrstited
fashion, O'Connor shows that she is no sex toy.
In fact, O'Connor finishes the song with an at
titude bordering on indifference.
Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Don't Cry for Me
Argentina" becomes a plaintive cry for for
giveness. Singing quietly, O'Connor makes a
pointed departure from the bombastic quality
of the original.
O'Connor delivers the album's strongest
track with her rendition of Julie London's
"Why Don't You Do Right," an infectiously

catchy tune with O'Connor's cool delivery. It's
easy to imagine her on stage in a nightclub,
backed by a big band as she growls, "Why don't
you do right like some other men do." She or
ders her lover, "Just get out of here and get me
some money too."

O'Connor's straightforward
rendition of 'I Want to Be
Loved By You' contrasts with
the coyly flirtatious version
made famous by Marilyn Mon
roe. By singing it in an under
stated fashion, O'Connor
shows that she is no sex toy.

With Ella Fitzgerald's "Bewitched, Bothered
and Bewildered," O'Connor shifts vocal gears:
the strong woman transforms into a vulnerable
female. Her voice becomes sweet and tender as
she sings about "the day when I'll cling to him."
In her version of Loretta Lynn's "Success
Has Made A Failure of Our Home," O'Connor
asks, "Am I not your girl?" At first she asks ten
tatively but then turns the question into an ac
cusation. Finally, she desperately asks, "Am 1
not your girl?" as if in tired defeat.
While the lush orchestral arrangements
help bring the album to life, the music at times
threatens to drown the singer's voice. In "Suc
threatens to drown the singer's voice. In
"Success Has Made a Failure of Our Home,"
the'music overwhelms O'Connor's voice
until she starts singing louder midway
through the song.
In her only original composition on the
album, O'Connor delivers a monologue
condemning the Holy Roman Empire.
"They told us lies to take us away from
God," she accuses. "But I'm not full of hate.
I'm full of love. God said, 'I bring not peace.
I bring a sword.'"
By following her number one album — "I
Do Not Want What I Haven't Got" — with
an album full of covers of mostly mid-centu
ry songs, O'Connor seems to be shooting
herself in the foot.
None of the songs on "Am I Not Your
Girl" has the accessibility of "Nothing Com
pares to You."
Many of her fans probably aren't famil
iar with the original songs on this album,
and the lack of background makes this
album difficult to listen to. Those who
know the showtunes by heart may think
differently.
The album does have its merits, though.
In covering such a wide range of songs, she
displays great versatility.

And her effort to reinterpret these classics
is valiant. O'Connor sings the songs as an ex
pression of her own feelings, and that gives
them a whole new meaning.
