# R.E.M.'s 'Automatic' drips with depression
## 
### Janar Stewart 
Somebody died.
At least that's the first impression one gets
after listening to R.E.M.'s ninth album, "Au
tomatic for the People." And the second im
pression. And the third.
In fact, it takes several listens to appreciate
anything about "Automatic"; it drips so
thickly with lyrical and musical melancholy,
one might suspect R.E.M. set out on a mis
sion to depress more people than the Smiths
ever did.
Unfortunately, "Automatic" doesn't de
press in that I've-come-to-wish-you-an-un
happy-birthday way.
Instead, well-written songs like
"Nightswimming" fall victim to uncreative,
uninteresting and even unsuitable musical ac
companiment.
The odd combination of Elton John-like
piano, Andrew Lloyd Webberish orchestra
and lead singer Michael Stipes' whiny voice
cause "Nightswimming" to come across as
wallowing in nostalgia and loss.
Also embarrassing is the oboe solo, which
only serves to add that Ann Murray/Musak
touch to an already defeated song.
Yet musicians Bill Berry, Peter Buck and
Mike Mills aren't the only ones to blame for
the many misses on this album.

Another tragic impediment to enjoying
"Automatic" rests with the atrociously pop
"Everybody Hurts."
With such trifling lyrics as "If you think
you've had too much/of this life/well hang
on/'cause everybody hurts," accompanied by
a score that sounds suspiciously similar to
Simon and Garfunkel — right down to the or
chestral crescendoes — this song simply
wastes valuable CD space.
Of course, not every cut on "Automatic"
deserves such disrespect.
Fresh lyrics strengthened by the deep, rich
sound of the cello and the distortion of an
electric guitar lend "Sweetness Follows" a
haunting and solitary sound befitting the
song's theme of family estrangement.
"Try not to Breathe" also succeeds with
acoustic guitar, banjo, a hint of electric guitar
distortion and strong strong lyrics: "I will try
not to breathe/this decision is mine/I have
lived a full life/These are the eyes I want you to
remember."
"Man on the Moon" may be the best cut on
the album, complete with slide guitar and
mandolin finger-picking and Stipes' capri
cious lyrics — about Andy Kaufman, Elvis
and the afterlife.
Aside from "Man on the Moon," "Ignore
land" and"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite,"
the songs on "Automatic" mark a definite,
and not always welcome, departure from pre
vious albums. If only there were fewer misses
than hits.
