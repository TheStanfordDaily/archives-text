## Dean of Research Byer says he's stepping down 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Being dean of research at Stanford during the in
direct-cost controversy could not have been an en
viable experience.
But that's not the reason Robert Byer is step
ping down from the position. "I have my laser re
search that I want to return to, and I want to get
back to teaching," said Byer, who is an applied
physics professor.
Byer was originally only supposed to be dean of
research for four years, from 1987 until 1991. But
because of the indirect-cost problems — plus "some
arm twisting" — Byer decided to stay an extra year.
Provost Gerald Lieberman announced Byer's deci
sion to leave at a Faculty Senate meeting last week.
Although dealing with indirect costs has taken
up most of Byer's time during the past few years, he
said he has still been able to teach a few seminars
and do some research with his graduate students.
The other responsibilities of the position have
taken up the rest of his time. His main job is to ad
vise the president and provost on policy questions
concerning research, which means dealing with
"outside entities" like companies and the govern
ment. He also ensures that Stanford's research
meets health and safety regulations.
