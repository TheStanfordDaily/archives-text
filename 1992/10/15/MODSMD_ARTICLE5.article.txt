## Dean of Research Byer says he's stepping down 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Being dean of research at Stanford during the in
direct-cost controversy could not have been an en
viable experience.
But that's not the reason Robert Byer is step
ping down from the position. "I have my laser re
search that I want to return to, and I want to get
back to teaching," said Byer, who is an applied
physics professor.
Byer was originally only supposed to be dean of
research for four years, from 1987 until 1991. But
because of the indirect-cost problems — plus "some
arm twisting" — Byer decided to stay an extra year.
Provost Gerald Lieberman announced Byer's deci
sion to leave at a Faculty Senate meeting last week.
Although dealing with indirect costs has taken
up most of Byer's time during the past few years, he
said he has still been able to teach a few seminars
and do some research with his graduate students.
The other responsibilities of the position have
taken up the rest of his time. His main job is to ad
vise the president and provost on policy questions
concerning research, which means dealing with
"outside entities" like companies and the govern
ment. He also ensures that Stanford's research
meets health and safety regulations.
But the "most fun" part of his
job, Byer said, is working with 10
independent labs and institutions,
such as the Institute for Interna
tional Studies and the Chicano
Research Center, which are all
affiliated with Stanford through
faculty members who work at
these centers.
The Office of Research helps
fund these organizations and also
brings together all the different
departments — ranging from pub
lic policy to physics to law — which
often need to cooperate on the cen
ters' projects.
Byer's office also supports indi
vidual research projects proposed
by Stanford faculty members. This
year, 80 proposals have been sub
mitted; about one-third of them
were accepted for funding. These
projects are generally smaller and
riskier than the ones the federal
government funds, Byer said.
"We've funded several that

have gone against conventional
wisdom," he said.
But in recent years, most of
Byer's time and attention has been
taken away from these more inter
esting projects and consumed by a
more pressing issue — indirect
costs.
Byer said that as dean of
research, he was "the academic
voice" in the indirect-cost discus
sions. During meetings with the
government to determine the cost
rate, Byer said he "brought in the
viewpoint of the research faculty" to
ensure that the quality of research
at Stanford would not be harmed.
But the indirect-cost issue goes
beyond just research, Byer said,
because the quality of research at
Stanford will afTect the quality of
education here.
"Research and teaching inform
each other and challenge each
other," Byer said, adding that he
believes there is a good balance
between teaching and research at
Stanford.
"We could pay more attention to
the delivery of the teaching and we
could always improve," Byer said,

but "part of the goal is for [profes
sors] to acquire new knowledge so
they can teach it to students."
"The research university is a
fantastic place to learn," Byer said,
"because it's a challenge for the
students. You can't sit back on
your hindquarters .... You have
to go knocking on some doors."
And Byer wants to be around
for those students. He plans to
teach some of the same physics
and optics courses that he taught
before he became a dean. "I can't
wait to get back into the regular
teaching program, to teaching
undergrads," he said.
It is research, though, that is
ultimately drawing him back into
the world of professors. "Research
is fun — it's what you live to do,"
he said.
His return to research will begin
when he officially steps down in
January and begins his nine
month sabbatical. Lieberman said
he hopes to have a replacement
chosen by the time Byer leaves.
"I've got to get back to doing
scholarly work," Byer said. "I have
to recharge my batteries."'

between teaching and research at
Stanford.
"We could pay more attention to
the delivery of the teaching and we
could always improve," Byer said,

but "part of the goal is for [profes
sors] to acquire new knowledge so
they can teach it to students."
"The research university is a
fantastic place to learn," Byer said,
"because it's a challenge for the
students. You can't sit back on
your hindquarters .... You have
to go knocking on some doors."
And Byer wants to be around
for those students. He plans to
teach some of the same physics
and optics courses that he taught
before he became a dean. "I can't
wait to get back into the regular
teaching program, to teaching
undergrads," he said.
It is research, though, that is
ultimately drawing him back into
the world of professors. "Research
is fun — it's what you live to do,"
he said.
His return to research will begin
when he officially steps down in
January and begins his nine
month sabbatical. Lieberman said
he hopes to have a replacement
chosen by the time Byer leaves.
"I've got to get back to doing
scholarly work," Byer said. "I have
to recharge my batteries."'
