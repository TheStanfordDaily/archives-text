# Sex it definitely ain't
## 
### 
IT'S ABOUT A FOOT AWAY from
a sexual fantasy.
On a cool night, wearing nothing
but a pair of 501's and leather gloves,
I see a woman on the other side of the
quad. The moon is full. So is she.
We silently embrace, clothes are
thrown everywhere. Gloves remain.
Bliss. Joy. Janitors.
Now, that's a sexual fantasy. Stick
ing your tongue down some random
freshman's throat and then running
back to your friends with one of those
triumphantly insecure, Ralph-Malph
after-a-bad-joke faces is not a fantasy.
Maybe more than a foot away.
I understand lust. I understand
lust like women understand gay men.
But this wasn't about lust. This was
about sexuality gone spastic. This was
about saliva. Freshman saliva. This
was the Jonestown of foreplay. And I
didn't see any Kool Aid.
Armed with only a video camera, a
notepad and a half-chewed dental
dam, I went to Full Moon on the
Quad. I went as a journalist, as a his
torian of our lives and times and so
cial diseases. And I saw things. Things
I never thought I'd see outside of
Fellini films.
I saw a woman kiss another
woman. I saw two men put their
tongues in one woman's mouth. I
saw a rat appear from between a
woman's breasts. Those little fresco
women on Memorial Church turned
their heads away in shame. It only
made them more attractive.
And as I watched woman after
woman bend her back to suck face
with a nameless faux senior man, my
own saliva turned sour.
There was no love here. No emotion.
Just a bunch of leo Buscaglia disciples
running around with breath mints.
Walking from couple to couple, I
kept asking the same question:
"What do you foresee in your future

together?" Invariably, this prompted
them to ask each other for their
names.
And then I pulled aside one now
woman and asked her, "^Why?
"Is it the sexual thrill? A desperate
attempt to forget your loneliness?
Some sort of pledge thing?"
But she just smiled and turned
away.
I went home and watched my
footage over and over again, desper
ately trying to understand. I felt like
Keith Archuleta, only with bad light
ing and no zoom lens.
And I saw an emptiness in their
eyes, a longing in their souls and an
oddly approving dorky guy wearing
an alumni T-shirt in the background.
These kids were squandering their
intimacy, throwing it to the wind as
brazenly as Marc DeCarlo slaps the
insides of men's thighs.
But then I wondered if an experi
ence that gave so many people plea
sure could be all bad. And then I
thought about Tony Danza and de
cided yes.
Maybe I'm a prude, but you can't
get off on a little tongue anyway.
Unless she's really good.
