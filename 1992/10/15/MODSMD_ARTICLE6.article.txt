### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
A librarian fired last June as part of budget cuts
within Jackson Library at the Graduate School of
Business has filed suit against the University, al
leging he was unjustly laid off.
Bela Gallo, the former head librarian at Jackson,
claims in the lawsuit that he was fired because of
his age and his denial of education-related tax ex
emptions for some employees.
Gallo, 58, had served as the head librarian at
Jackson from 1979 until being laid off June 24. He
previously spent four years working as the head
technical services library at Jackson, according to
the complaint filed late last week in Santa Clara
County Superior Court.
According to the lawsuit, Gallo regularly re
ceived merit-based pay increases and "performed
his job as librarian in a very competent manner."
But beginning in 1990, Gallo refused to approve
the work training-related expenses of some em
ployees, thus denying them tax exemptions
through the University's Staff Training Assistance
Program, the complaint said.
"(Gallo) refused to give his approval when he be
lieved that the education obtained by the employee
was not work related," the lawsuit said. "He be
lieved that by signing the applications for reim
bursement he would be defrauding the federal gov
ernment under the Internal Revenue Code, he
would be committing a violation of law and would
be violating the written policy of the defendants."
As a result, according to the complaint, Gallo's
duties were reduced and he was placed under a su
pervisor "who was considerably younger than he
was."
