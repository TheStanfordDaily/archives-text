## 
### Victor Cheng Editorial staff 
In an effort to inform cyclists of Cali
fornia bicycle law and to promote bicy
cle safety, Stanford Police handed out
warning citations to unsuspecting bicy
clists around campus yesterday.
The effort was a prelude to stricter
enforcement of bicycle violations that
will begin next week, officers said.
Deputy Sheriffs Tim Schreiner and
James Fitzhenry spent about 30 min
utes at the corner of Arguello Way and
Serra Street handing out yellow photo
copies of police citations.

'The most dangerous
intersections are Santa
Teresa Street and Morris
Way, as well as Campus
Drive and Serra Street.'
— Deputy Sheriff
James Fitzhenry

The pseudo-citations, labeled "Free
Ticket", reminded bicyclists that they
must obey all stop signs, use a bike
light at night, register their bicycles
and ride on the road rather than the
sidewalk.
Stanford Police have handed out ap

proximately 1,000 "Free Tickets" this
week and hope to hand out a total of
3,500 by the end of the week, Schreiner
said.
"We are planning on much more bi
cycle enforcement this year," he said.
"We will be handing out warnings
the rest of the week and start citing
heavily next week. We want to be fair
about this; that is why we are handing
out so many warnings."
Stanford Police have increased their
emphasis on bicycle safety during the
past few years. Between 1989 and 1991,
the number of annual bicycle citations
has increased by more than 300 per
cent. Stanford police maintain that col
lisions have decreased over the past few
years because of the stricter enforce
ment.
According to Fitzhenry, the Stanford
campus is not safe for pedestrians when
there are bikes everywhere and bicy
clists who ride unsafely. "The most dan
gerous intersections are Santa Teresa
Street and Morris Way, as well as Cam
pus Drive and Serra Street," Fitzhenry
said.
"I like to talk to people and explain
why it is important to stop at stop signs
and stay oft the sidewalks," Fitzhenry
said. "We're out here to make the cam
pus safer."
Schreiner said pedestrians, mo
torists, and even violators have re
sponded positively to warning efforts.
"One person told me, 'Right-on! Stop
those kamikazes,' " he said
