Stanford's international students may soon feel a
little closer to home, thanks to a new International
Student Lounge Program at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
Funded by AT&T International, the program
will provide up-to-date news broadcasts from around
the world, seminars, movies and study breaks. A
permanent newspaper and magazine rack stocked
with foreign language publications from other coun
tries will also be available, said junior Legae
Phahlane, who will staff a weekly event.
AT&T will also use the lounge as a means of
advertising its international student calling plan.
One of 10 universities selected by AT&T for the pro
gram, Stanford was chosen because of its large inter
national student population and its academic reputa
tion, said AT&T Account Supervisor Monica Johnston.
The program is designed to "bring [international
students] a little closer to home," Johnston said.

Geared to the needs of international students, the
lounge will house practical information on every
thing from how to get a driver's license to how to
buy and register a car.
However, Johnston stressed that the events are
not exclusively for international students. "We want
all students to benefit," she said.
"It's a nice way for American students and foreign
students to get to know each other," added Judy
Polenta, administrative assistant at the I-Center.
Senior Bertram Eyakuze said he feels the pro
gram should help international students fit in to
American life.
"International students are always looking for
opportunities to do things," he said. The student
lounge program will "draw them in, give them a
taste of home," he added.
Programs are tentatively scheduled to take place one
evening a week, though the exact day is under debate.
Representatives of AT&T are considering the
possibility of scheduling events for Monday evening.
