Democratic presidential nominee Bill
Clinton enjoys massive support at Stan
ford, with more than 71 percent of stu
dents saying they would vote for him if the
election were held today, according to a poll
conducted by The Daily.
While Clinton leads President Bush by
13 percent nationwide, the Democratic
challenger has a much greater 63 percent
advantage on the Farm.
Only 11 percent of students polled say
they support Bush, while independent can
didate Ross Perot is backed by a paltry 5 per
cent. One in 10 respondents was undecided.
Despite a resurgence of draft-dodging
allegations and recent questions about his
involvement in anti-war protests, a clear
majority of students have a positive per
ception of Clinton, with 62 percent of re
spondents saying they have a "favorable"
opinion of him.
Only 17 percent view the Arkansas gov
ernor unfavorably, and an equal number of
students remain undecided in their opin
ion of him.
Clinton's support at Stanford stands in
stark contrast to national public opinion.
Only 37 percent of voters nationwide view
the Democratic nominee favorably, while
36 percent have an unfavorable perception
of him, according to the latest New York
Times/CBS News poll.
Bush's anemic support on campus is
best explained by students' impressions of
him. Only 11 percent of Stanford students

view the incumbent favorably, while near
ly 80 percent said they have an unfavorable
opinion.
Despite choosing the Hoover Institu
tion's James Stockdale as his running mate,
Perot has not made a favorable impression


Adam Block â€” Daily
on students. Only 16 percent have a posi
tive perception of the Texas billionaire,
while 47 percent view him unfavorably.
The poll, based on telephone interviews
with 419 randomly selected Stanford stu
dents who are registered voters, also has
dismal predictions for the Bush campaign.
Nearly 89 percent of respondents say they
expect Clinton to win on election day.
The economic woes that have been plagu
ing the Bush administration appear to have
affected students' perceptions of him. More
than 40 percent of students and 46 percent of
voters nationwide said they believe the econ
omy is the most important campaign issue.
Mirroring Clinton's strong showing on
campus, California's Democratic Senate
and House candidates also eryoy strong
support from Stanford students registered
in the state.
The two female Democratic Senate
hopefuls, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Fein
stein, each are supported by more than 50
percent of students who vote in California.
Fifly-two percent said they support Boxer,
and 51 percent support Feinstein.

Republican Bruce Herschensohn has the
backing of only 9 percent of students. And
just 13 percent plan to support Republican
John Seymour.
The poll, which surveyed 305 students
registered to vote in California, included
many who have not yet chosen a candidate
in the Senate races. For each contest, more
than 30 percent of students said they are
undecided.
And the "undecided" category also
seems to be the most popular choice in the
14th Congressional District race. Nearly 60
percent of those polled said they have not
yet chosen between Republican Tom Huen
ing and Democrat Anna Eshoo.
Eshoo, however, has the support of 31
percent of students, while only 9 percent
said they plan to vote for Huening. Eshoo
and Huening are running for the seat
vacated by Stanford Law Prof. Tom Camp
bell, a Republican.
The poll, conducted on Monday and
Tuesday nights, has a margin of error of
plus or minus 5 percentage points.
Sixty-two percent of those surveyed
were male and 38 percent were female, the
same proportion as the student body last
year. Graduate students made up 42 per
cent of the polled group, while 58 percent of
those called were undergraduates.
