Democratic presidential nominee Bill
Clinton enjoys massive support at Stan
ford, with more than 71 percent of stu
dents saying they would vote for him if the
election were held today, according to a poll
conducted by The Daily.
While Clinton leads President Bush by
13 percent nationwide, the Democratic
challenger has a much greater 63 percent
advantage on the Farm.
Only 11 percent of students polled say
they support Bush, while independent can
didate Ross Perot is backed by a paltry 5 per
cent. One in 10 respondents was undecided.
Despite a resurgence of draft-dodging
allegations and recent questions about his
involvement in anti-war protests, a clear
majority of students have a positive per
ception of Clinton, with 62 percent of re
spondents saying they have a "favorable"
opinion of him.
Only 17 percent view the Arkansas gov
ernor unfavorably, and an equal number of
students remain undecided in their opin
ion of him.
Clinton's support at Stanford stands in
stark contrast to national public opinion.
Only 37 percent of voters nationwide view
the Democratic nominee favorably, while
36 percent have an unfavorable perception
of him, according to the latest New York
Times/CBS News poll.
Bush's anemic support on campus is
best explained by students' impressions of
him. Only 11 percent of Stanford students

view the incumbent favorably, while near
ly 80 percent said they have an unfavorable
opinion.
Despite choosing the Hoover Institu
tion's James Stockdale as his running mate,
Perot has not made a favorable impression
