Shootings, banditos, ambushes and
revenge.
It sounds like the plot of a spaghetti west
ern, but the discovery of an escaped killer at
Stanford Hospital brought the scenario from
the silver screen to the Cardinal campus.
Shooting victim "Jorge Razo" had lain for
weeks in a hospital bed, unconscious and
undisturbed, until a few weeks ago when San
Jose police detective George de la Rocha iden
tified the patient as Rafael Quiros Hermosillo.
Hermosillo, de la Rocha said, is a drug

runner and murderer wanted by the Mexi
can government since his escape from a
prison there in March 1990.
"He's a well-known narco-trafTicant. He
was also known as a pistolero," de la Rocha
said. "He tells me he was in prison for auto
theft (but) from what I'm getting from law
enforcement over there, it was multiple
homicide."
De la Rocha said he received a call about
three weeks ago from Javier Solorzano, a
policeman from Mexico he had worked with
on a previous case.
Solorzano said he had heard Hermosillo
was in a hospital near San Jose, and gave de

la Rocha a phone number to call. The number
led de la Rocha to the fugitive at the hospital.
"When I finally talked to him, he had
been in a coma for almost a month," de la
Rocha said. "I think he was just happy to
talk to anyone."
Upon questioning, de la Rocha said Her
mosillo admitted to his prison escape and true
identity. He also confessed to an ambush in
Mexico earlier this year in which he and two
accomplices killed two Mexican police officers.
De la Rocha, who called Hermosillo a "very
well known" criminal in Mexico, said the killer
fled to the United States after the ambush
and was hiding in East Palo Alto under his

assumed name when he was shot July 20.
After his release from the hospital about
three weeks ago, Hermosillo was trans
ferred to lx)s Angeles, where he is "being
held under the name Jorge Razo."
It seems the real Jorge Razo — the per
son whose identity Hermosillo assumed — is
wanted in the United States on drug
charges, charges Hermosillo is now being
held on despite his true identity.
"Somehow he ended up lucking into
that," de la Rocha said sarcastically. "What I
believe will happen with him is that the war
rant will be dropped, and he'll be deported to
Mexico as an illegal alien."
