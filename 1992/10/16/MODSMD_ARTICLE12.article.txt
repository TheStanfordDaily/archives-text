Serbs won't surrender planes
BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina
(AP) — Defying the world community
and his own political chief, the comman
der of the Serb rebel air force refused
yesterday to relinquish his aircraft to
U.N. supervision.
The Serb rebel air commander, Gen.
Zivomir Ninkovic, rejected a pledge made
Monday by Serb rebel leader Radovan
Karadzic to move the aircraft from Bosnia
to the neighboring republic of Serbia.
"The air force is not going any
where," he said in Banja Luka, a Serb
rebel stronghold in northern Bosnia-
Herzegovina.
Ninkovic's stand bolstered suspi
cions that Karadzic, the main Serb rebel
negotiator in the international effort to
halt the bloodshed in Bosnia-Herzegov
ina, has little control over his military
commanders.
Last month, the U.N. Security Coun
cil banned military flights over Bosnia as
part of world efforts to stop the war.
Bosnian government forces have no war
planes and accuse the Serbs of bombing
civilian targets.
Meanwhile, the Bosnian army in
Sarajevo said yesterday it has forbidden
men and women to leave the besieged
capital if they are healthy enough to
defend it. A Red Cross plan to evacuate
5,000 sick, elderly and young people
today was postponed indefinitely.
The army wants military doctors to
examine anyone claiming to be ill.
Water and electricity remained cut in
Sarajevo. Telephone service was shut
off yesterday because there was no fuel
for the generator.

Meanwhile, Yugoslav Prime Minister
Milan Panic tried to avert another eth
nic war by traveling to the Serbian
southern province of Kosovo, where the
ethnic Albanian majority demands
restoration of its autonomy.
Suljway drunk driver convicted
NEW YORK (AP) - The subway
motorman allegedly drunk at the con
trols when a train crash killed five peo
ple was convicted yesterday on five
counts of manslaughter but acquitted of
murder charges.
The jury also convicted Robert Ray of
15 counts of assault in connection with
the passengers injured in the Aug. 28,
1991, crash at the station under Man
hattan's Union Square.
He faces a maximum of five to 15
years in prison when he is sentenced by
state Supreme Court Justice Daniel
Fitzgerald.
Ray, 39, stood calmly as the jury fore
man read the verdict. Jurors began
deliberating late Tuesday afternoon.
He denied that he was drunk at the
train's controls. He said he was so upset
after his train crashed that he fled and
got drunk then.
Dr. Marina Stajic, a toxicologist in
the city medical examiner's office, testi
fied that she believed Ray's blood alco
hol level was two to three times the legal
limit for drunkenness at the time of the
crash.
Stajic said her estimate was based on
tests of Ray's blood 13 hours after the
crash, his approximate metabolism
rate, and his statements to police about
the amounts he had drunk.
