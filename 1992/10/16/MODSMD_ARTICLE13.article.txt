# Presidential debate rich in issues

### 
RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - President
Bush, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot field
ed questions from uncommitted voters
yesterday in a civilized, issue-rich debate
that ranged from taxes to crime to char
acter.
After a brief clash in which Bush
renewed his attack on Clinton's anti-war
activities in the Vietnam era, the three
men were brought up short by a ques
tioner's demand that they "focus on the
issues and the programs."
They swiftly took his advice, and pro
ceeded to dissect their disagreements
over education, health care, the deficit,
trade policy and urban woes.
The 90-minute debate at the Univer
sity of Richmond was held under
unprecedented ground rules in which
independent voters asked questions and
the candidates were free to leave their

seats and approach the audience.
Bush used his closing statement to
make a swipe at Clinton's proposed tax
hike, and to ask the voters to decide who
has the "perseverance, the character,
the integrity, the maturity" to handle a
crisis in the Oval Office.
Perot stuck to his outsider's appeal,
saying that if the American people want
to solve their problems "and not talk
about it, I'm the one person they ought
to consider."
Clinton closed by speaking to the vot
ers in the audience rather than looking
into the camera.
He criticized the Republicans' "trick
le-down economics" one final time, then
said, "We've got to grow the economy by
putting people first, real people like
you."
Early on, the candidates were asked

to give their remedies for the huge fed
eral deficit, and Perot said scathingly
that neither Republicans nor Democrats
were willing to take blame for the
nation's huge debt. "Somewhere out
there is an extraterrestrial who's doing
this to us," he said.
On crime, Clinton said he supported
the so-called Brady bill that called for a
waiting period for handgun purchasers,
and also backed an anti-crime bill that
was killed earlier this month in
Congress by a Republican-led fili
buster.
Bush countered that the legislation
backed by Clinton wasn't tough enough.
He said he wanted tougher provisions to
cut down on court appeals and to
strengthen the hand of police officers.
He also stressed his support for the
death penalty.
