# Egyptian sectarian strife kills four

### 
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) — A mob out to
avenge the death of two Muslim men
went on a rampage in southern Egypt
yesterday, killing four Coptic Christians
and burning down 20 shops and a
church, a police official said.
The violence in the village of Tama,
260 miles south of Cairo, brought to 70
the number killed in a campaign by Mus
lim extremists against Egypt's Coptic
minority.
The official, who declined to be iden
tified under police rules, said relations
between the two ethnic groups had
become increasingly tense in the village
after a Christian killed a Muslim several

months ago.
On Oct. 6, a Muslim customer at a
Christian store was severely beaten by
the store's owner after an argument
over the price of cigarettes. The man,
whose name was not released, died
Wednesday from his injuries and was
buried yesterday under heavy police pro
tection.
"We think that the Muslim group
decided that police would be occupied by
the security of the funeral so they
sneaked away and went on the ram
page," the police official said.
He said they were arrested, but could
not say how many there were or give

details.
In terms of fatalities, yesterday's
rampage was the second-worst eruption
of sectarian strife in southern Egypt this
year.
In early May, Muslim gunmen killed
13 Copts and a Muslim in the town of
Assiut. The incident began with a dis
agreement between Christians and Mus
lims over the sale of a house.
Of the 70 killed in the violence this
year, 23 have been Copts. Ninety-one
Muslims, Christians, and police have
also been wounded.
Most of Egypt's 6 million Copts live in
the south.
