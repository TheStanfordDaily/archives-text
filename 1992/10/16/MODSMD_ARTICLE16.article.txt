## Keep Stanford smart 
### 
Need for higher levels
of intellectualism and
teaching on the Farm

STRIKING A BALANCE
between Nobel prize research
and ultimate Frisbee is a
proud tradition at Stanford. To the
dismay of our Ivy League rivals,
Stanford has remained a pleasant
place to spend time even as its aca
demic reputation soared in the
1970's and 1980's. All the same,
we applaud President Casper's
homily stating that students and
faculty alike "burn the midnight
oil" and maintain academic priori
ties before all others.
Casper's prior employer, the
University of Chicago, is known as
a brainy institution. Although that
university might be criticized as
being a bit obsessed with free-mar
ket economics, there is no dispute
that the life of the mind is in great
shape on Chicago's south side.
Can we say the same about
Stanford? At its best, Stanford
brings to life the Greek leitmotif of
sound body, sound mind. But at its
worst, Stanford is an anti-intellec
tual 'burb, a school of studied
casualness and casual studying.
Students are intimidated by Hei
degger but happy to wear T-shirts
that say "I'm not very smart, but I
can lift heavy things."
Stanford students often do burn
the midnight oil, but mainly after
devoting many hours to maintain
ing a carefree appearance during
the day. When students seem
embarrassed to learn or appear
intelligent, something is wrong.
Furthermore, though Stanford
often wins superficial praise from
the likes of U.S. News and Busi
ness Week, its academic reputation
is inconsistent. Stanford's most
respected departments are gradu
ate programs in sciences and the
professional schools. Stanford's
undergraduate education is regu

larly perceived as one of the
nation's best because of a balance
between quality of life and aca
demics, riot academic excellence
alone. Some of our humanities and
social sciences programs are lead
ers in their field, but others are
mediocre.
Some ingredients of our pecu
liar academic mix are structural.
For example, using a quarter sys
tem rather than a semester system
means we gain breadth at the
expense of depth. (How many 20-
30 page research papers have you
written in college?) Another factor
is attitudinal. To wit, many stu
dents choose Stanford because of
the attractive lifestyle. But does
this imply a desire to take unchal
lenging courses and pretend that
we like things this way?
Stanford's academic reputation
should continue to climb. To help
Stanford and President Casper at
this task, the most useful tool at
their disposal is information.
A couple of possible targets for
improvement:
• Psychology 1. A lousy intro
duction to the subject that relies
almost exclusively on rote memo
rization.
• Statistics 60. The quality and
content of this course fluctuate
wildly depending on which
semester you take it. We ascribe
this to poor planning rather than
late-breaking development in
Statistics.
But these are only a beginning.
Among students at Stanford is a
wealth of information — about
what's wrong and what's right
with academic life at Stanford —
which has gone noticeably
unheard.

Next week, The Stanford Daily will be
running students' comments on the
quality of education and intellectual
life at Stanford.
Letters and telephone calls [725-
2107, 2-4 p.m., ask for Victor or John]
will be accepted Monday through
Thursday next week. Comments will
be printed without attribution, but we
need a name and phone number for
verification.
