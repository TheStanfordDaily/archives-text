## Sweaty tuna: life as a tree 
### 
SO YOU THINK THE LIFE of a col
lege mascot is a glamorous one?
Scantily-clad dancing girls throwing
themselves at your feet. Thousands and
thousands of adulating fans calling your
name, fighting tooth and nail to get close
enough to touch you. Big parties with big
names and even bigger money. Oh God,
the sex.
However, what few people ever see is
the dark side of mascot life. The
moments of depression. The sheer, phys
ical agony. Oh God, the sex.
As with most things in life, the joy was
so closely intermingled with the pain that
they became practically indistinguish
able. This is the reality of a mascot, and it
is not pretty.
Fall quarter. Football games. While
students doffed their shirts and enjoyed
the game, I wore eighty pounds of foam,
felt and plastic tubing and danced for
their sadistic pleasure.
I couldn't sit down, and I couldn't go
to the bathroom. The sweltering heat
forced sweat out of my body like mayo
out of a tuna sandwich left in a hot lunch
box. I'd run. I'd jump. I'd dance. I'd trip.
I was Baryshnikov in foam. It made the
Bataan Death March look like a night at
the circus.
The main difference between fall and
winter quarter was that the basketball
and volleyball games were indoors, at
night and everyone had constant access

to my body.
My first encounter with little kids who
go to the games was one of the most
memorable experiences of my life. About
a half dozen children gathered around me
and seemed pretty excited to be with the
"Tree."
I thought, "how cute — these kids
don't know that I'm really a man in a cos
tume." That's when they rushed me.
They tore into my pants like sharks
into a bleeding whale, yanking them
down around my ankles and going for
the gold. They grabbed anything they
could get their groping hands on, and
shoved digits into crevices normally
reserved for the hands of highly-quali
fied physicians.
With little children literally hanging
off my genitals and blinding pain pulling
me to my knees, I carefully surveyed the
situation. It would just not do to have an
alumnus glance over into the corner of
Maples to see the the lovable mascot
maniacally pummeling a group of chil
dren.
"Hey kids," I squealed, "if you let go,
I'll buy you some food." That was the
beginning of the end.
Every game from then on, I needed to
bring at least $40 in extortion money if I
wanted to remain sexually functional,
and as more and more kids caught on to
the scam, I had to cough up more and
more dough.

Winter quarter had me down, and
there was nothing I could do about it.
"Hey Tree," they'd yell, "do something
silly. Do your funny dance and make us
laugh." But I had grown tired of being a
court jester in this cold, uncaring
world.
At first, I would sit in the corner with
my kids, and ponder the meaninglessness
of life with them, but that began to scare
them away. I became the Poet-tree and
brought in volumes of brooding and cryp
tic poetry — Robert Frost, Edgar Allen
Poe, John Donne. Eventually, I was alone
in my corner.
And that, my friends, is the reality of
life as a college mascot. Alone in a corner,
invisible frown behind a big, red felt grin.
Was all the fame and fortune worth the
price I paid? I'll never know for sure, but
there is one thing I do know: oh God, the
sex.
