Hoover fellow accuses profs of hiding from criticism

1 CONTINUE TO BE amazed and
somewhat dismayed at the lengths
some professors will go to in order to
avoid discussing the criticism of higher
education in my book, "Impostors in the
Temple" — especially the criticism of
the practice of using graduate students
as psuedo-professors. The recent letters
from professors Cohen and Fields to The
Daily are classic examples of this phe
nomenon.
I am delighted to find that I was not
entirely correct about this fall's Fresh
man English offerings — that, in a
break with past practice, a few honest
to-God professors are teaching some sec
tions of freshman English (although, it
is reported, at the expense of cancelling

other English courses) and that the
shameful idea of a pilot program to use
graduate students from other areas,
such as history, to teach Freshman
English has been postponed for at least
one year because of logistical problems.
But back to the central issue. Is it not
true that something on the order of 60
percent of the teaching of Freshman
English is done by graduate students?
Why is this?
Is it because Freshman English is so
unimportant it does not merit a full roster
of real professors? Is it ethical to give
degree credit at a world-class university for
courses taught and graded by students?
And where is it written in the Stan
ford University catalog that part of what

you get for the $21,949 for tuition, room
and board is to be educated and graded
by other students? If student "profes
sors" are so great why doesn't Stanford
boast about them to parents and
prospective students?
Earlier this year, on Jan. 14, The Daily
editorialized that "A School of Humani
ties and Sciences proposal to eliminate
certain Freshman English lecturers and
replace them with graduate students
would be disastrous." A month later Dean
Carolyn Lou gee announced an "experi
ment" that would use graduate students
from departments other than English as
Freshman English instructors.
Professor Nancy Parker argued that
if that was a "harbinger of things to

come, it will be a disaster for the pro
gram." Does professor Fields agree with
Parker? Is that corrupt policy dead or
just postponed for a bit?
What is more important than any
specific case is the shameful attitude
toward undergraduate teaching at Stan
ford that University President Gerhard
Casper has inherited. If professors
Cohen and Fields, for example, spent
less time stonewalling criticism of the
benign neglect of undergraduates, and
more time on fostering educational
excellence for them, they would all be
better off.
