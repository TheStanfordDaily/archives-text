# Less informed, left-of-center

Stanford students generally con
sider themselves more liberal and
more concerned about educational is
sues, but less informed about the
presidential campaign than the aver
age American voter.
Thirty-six percent of students re
sponding to a Daily poll this week say
they have liberal views on political
matters. Only 22 percent of voters na
tionwide see themselves as left-lean
ing, according to the latest New York
Times/CBS News poll.
Most Stanford students place them
selves in the political middle ground,
with 52 percent of respondents to the
Daily poll saying they are moderates.
Forty percent of the national electorate
consider themselves moderate, according
to the New York Times poll.
Conservatives claim minority status
on campus, with only 11 percent of
respondents saying they consider them
selves on the right side of the political
spectrum. Stanford's relatively few con
servatives stand in sharp contrast to the
32 percent of Americans nationwide who
say they are conservative.
The campus' left-of-center political
views are also reflected in students' party
loyalties. More than 46 percent of stu
dents polled affiliate themselves with the
Democratic party. Nearly 32 percent say
they are independent and 19 percent are
Republican. Three percent of students

contacted say they belong to another
political party.
The Farm is far more Democratic than
the nation in general. Only 35 percent of
national respondents to the New York
Times poll said they were Democrats,
while 29 percent affiliated themselves
with the Republican party.
Of those Stanford students who say
they are independent, 56 percent lean
more toward the Democratic party on
most issues, 14 percent say they favor
the Republican party's positions and 30
percent say they lean toward neither
party.
The one topic that most students cited
as being of greatest concern to them was
the economy, with 40 percent saying the
candidates need to address the issue more.
Educational issues came in second,
with nearly 13 percent saying the candi
dates should spend more time on the topic.
Other issues of concern to Stanford voters
are the deficit, domestic policy, abortion,

health care and the environment.
On a national level, the economy also
takes center stage for voters, with 46 of
respondents to the New York Times poll
citing the country's fiscal condition as the
paramount campaign issue. Health care
received a fair amount of attention, with
8 percent of voters saying they want to
hear more about the issue.
Only 37 percent of Stanford students
responded that they have been following
the campaign closely, compared to 57 per
cent of voters nationwide who claim to be
paying "a lot" of attention to the race for
the White House.
But 53 percent of Stanford students
say that they have been paying "some
attention" to the campaign. Only 9 per
cent admit giving "not much attention"
to the race. Eighty-seven percent of stu
dents say they will definitely vote on
Nov. 3, one percentage point higher than
the national average of registered vot
ers.
