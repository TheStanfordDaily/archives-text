# Mistakes abound in cultural dance story
## 
### 
I am writing to point out some mis
takes in your article printed on the
front page on Oct. 13. First of all, the
10 different dances presented did not
"each portray a different ritual from
the Uruba religion." The dances each
represented a different deity of the
Santeria religion derived from the
Yoruba (not Uruba) tradition that
African slaves brought to Cuba cen
turies ago.
Furthermore, the musicians did not
sing "in Spanish," they sang in an
African tongue from the Yoruba region
that over time has incorporated some
Spanish words and/or accent, but oth
erwise has no relation to Spanish.
I realize that these facts may not be
common knowledge to The Daily's
reporters. However, I do not believe
that it is too much to ask that a
reporter take extra measures to assure
the accuracy of their report when they
are obviously unfamiliar with the sub-

ject matter. Have some respect
