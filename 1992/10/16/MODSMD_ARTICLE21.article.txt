# Field Hockey gets no respect from The Daily
## 
### 
I would like to call attention to what
seems to be one of the true mysteries of
Stanford sports coverage. Well into our
seventh week of Division I conference
play, you would think someone on The
Daily staff would notice that field hock
ey has not yet been covered.
At first, one would think this was a
busy staff s honest oversight. But sadly
enough, this doesn't seem to be the case
Ignoring the fact that the women's var
sity field hockey team has made the
NCAA play-offs the last two years in a
row, this year's Daily coverage has hit
some sort of roadblock.
Last year by this time field hockey
was covered in four articles. Why the
change? The only logical solution to this
puzzle is that The Daily's sports staff
has suffered some great trauma in the

last year that has made them forget that
field hockey is a Division I Varsity Sport.
I found Kevin JefTery's recent sports
column quite ironic to our situation.
Whereas he accurately concludes there is
nothing better for the morale of a team
than the support of a crowd, I would go
a step further and say there is nothing
better for the morale of a team than for
the campus newspaper to come out and
show their support as well.
