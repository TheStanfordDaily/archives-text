# Frat brunches are just "back-to-school" affairs

### 
As members of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity, we are writing to
express our anger with the Oct. 8 edito
rial entitled "A crooked tradition." We
are surprised and saddened that The
Daily, traditionally a paper that has
sought to challenge contemporary
stereotypes, embraced them so whole
heartedly in their editorial.
To begin, we are concerned that the

"facts" of the editorial were unspecific
and unsubstantiated.
Our brunch was not, as suggested, a
freshman brunch, and our motives in
inviting any freshman were certainly not
"ulterior." The brunch was a "back-to
school" affair. Women from all four
classes (as well as a handful of recent
graduates) were invited.
The process of inviting freshmen dif
fered from that of inviting older women
only in that the freshmen received writ
ten invitations, and were verbally
requested to bring roommates and any
friends they wanted (to help alleviate
the development of "rifts" in dorms).
Aside from this difference all women
invited to the brunch were invited based
on the same, simple criterion: whether a
close friend, a casual acquaintance or
just a familiar face, each woman was
invited because a member of the frater
nity had (if only in passing) met her.
Though perhaps more desirable, we nei
ther have the resources, nor can we
accept the liability, involved in inviting
the whole campus to such events.
