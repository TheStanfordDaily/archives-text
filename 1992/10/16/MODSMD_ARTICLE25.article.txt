## Avila leads stingy defense into Arizona showdown 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal defense dominates
football games. If you're an opposing
offensive coordinator, preparing for all
of Stanford's weapons can be an exer
cise in futility.
Predatory linebackers leave your
signal caller shifty-eyed. A sticky pair
of corners blankets your wide outs. A
rib-cracking safety strikes fear in your
heart.
And Estevan Avila takes control of
the trenches.
The Cardinal defensive lineman is
the elder statesman of a defense that
sports seven senior starters.
As a fifth-year senior, he has seen
the days of 3-8 records.
He has lived through seasons
where Stanford was happy to finish
number eight in the Pacific 10 Con
ference.
He has played on a defensive unit
that could give up four touchdowns
and still feel like it played a good
game.
As much as anyone involved with
the Cardinal football program, Estevan
Avila can appreciate the view from his
perch among the top 10.
"I was here when the team was 3-8
and no one respected us.
"Now we're one of the top 10
teams in the country. And it's great
to actually go out and be the intim
idator, instead of the team that's
intimidated."
Avila has more than a little to do
with that aura of intimidation. At a rel
atively slight 6 feet 2 inches tall, he
may not tower over opposing linemen.
But he can certainly find his way
around them.

New defensive coordinator Fred von-
Appen has released Avila to fulfill his
bone-crushing fantasies as often as he
likes.
Last season, the line had more of a
containment responsibility. Now, he's
going all out on every pass play, and
quarterbacks are not happy.
His six sacks in six games are the
stuff All-Pac-10 players are made of.
But somehow, a remote post-season
certificate doesn't seem to be his driv
ing force. One gathers it's a bit more
visceral.
"I know this is going to sound bar
baric, but the thing I enjoy most about
playing defense is hitting — hitting him
hard enough that you can hear the guy
groan."
Ouch.
"I love to hit somebody so hard that
you know it hurt him. And not just
because it's intimidating, or makes the
other team scared of coming back at
you."
Of course, that's always nice, too.
"But when you hit someone that
hard, the ball comes out a lot, and good

things happen for your defense."
And plenty of good things have been
happening lately for the Cardinal
defenders.
They have become the nation's fifth
rated defense, and the Pac-10's best. In
two conference games, they have given
up just 14 points.
And after totaling just 16 sacks last
season, this year's 11 Angry Men have
already racked up 23 in just six con
tests.
Hold on a minute. Did someone just
tab the Cardinal "D" with a nickname?
If they did, blame Estevan.
"We're an angry bunch out on the
field. When teams get a first down on
us, it pisses us off. And it's not the kind
of anger we vent at each other.
"We just get mad as a unit, and
focus it on the other team. There's
such a high level of intensity among us.
And it's a very steady level — you look
at the other guys in the huddle, and
you know they're every bit as intense
as you are."
That kind of play has much to do
with the fact that the defense has
grown up together. A lot of the current
starters have been in that role for three
years.
"As a defense, we've known this was
going to be our year. We played togeth
er as sophomores and juniors, and now
we've made it to the national scene.
"We're kind of like a big family, me
and my 10 guys on defense. And we feel
like our group is better than the
[opposing] offense. It's like, no matter
what they do, we know we can stop
them."
And if somebody just "pisses off'
Avila and his family enough, the 11
Angry Men just might prove him
right.

At 6'2", senior lineman Estevan Avila is considered "short" for his position. However,
as one of the key members of the Cardinal's fifth-ranked defensive unit, his record of
accomplishment stands tall.

At 6'2", senior lineman Estevan Avila is considered "short" for his position. However,
as one of the key members of the Cardinal's fifth-ranked defensive unit, his record of
accomplishment stands tall.
The Cardinal defense dominates
football games. If you're an opposing
offensive coordinator, preparing for all
of Stanford's weapons can be an exer
cise in futility.
Predatory linebackers leave your
signal caller shifty-eyed. A sticky pair
of corners blankets your wide outs. A
rib-cracking safety strikes fear in your
heart.
And Estevan Avila takes control of
the trenches.
The Cardinal defensive lineman is
the elder statesman of a defense that
sports seven senior starters.
As a fifth-year senior, he has seen
the days of 3-8 records.
He has lived through seasons
where Stanford was happy to finish
number eight in the Pacific 10 Con
ference.
He has played on a defensive unit
that could give up four touchdowns
and still feel like it played a good
game.
As much as anyone involved with
the Cardinal football program, Estevan
Avila can appreciate the view from his
perch among the top 10.
"I was here when the team was 3-8
and no one respected us.
"Now we're one of the top 10
teams in the country. And it's great
to actually go out and be the intim
idator, instead of the team that's
intimidated."
Avila has more than a little to do
with that aura of intimidation. At a rel
atively slight 6 feet 2 inches tall, he
may not tower over opposing linemen.
But he can certainly find his way
around them.

New defensive coordinator Fred von-
Appen has released Avila to fulfill his
bone-crushing fantasies as often as he
likes.
Last season, the line had more of a
containment responsibility. Now, he's
going all out on every pass play, and
quarterbacks are not happy.
His six sacks in six games are the
stuff All-Pac-10 players are made of.
But somehow, a remote post-season
certificate doesn't seem to be his driv
ing force. One gathers it's a bit more
visceral.
"I know this is going to sound bar
baric, but the thing I enjoy most about
playing defense is hitting — hitting him
hard enough that you can hear the guy
groan."
Ouch.
"I love to hit somebody so hard that
you know it hurt him. And not just
because it's intimidating, or makes the
other team scared of coming back at
you."
Of course, that's always nice, too.
"But when you hit someone that
hard, the ball comes out a lot, and good

things happen for your defense."
And plenty of good things have been
happening lately for the Cardinal
defenders.
They have become the nation's fifth
rated defense, and the Pac-10's best. In
two conference games, they have given
up just 14 points.
And after totaling just 16 sacks last
season, this year's 11 Angry Men have
already racked up 23 in just six con
tests.
Hold on a minute. Did someone just
tab the Cardinal "D" with a nickname?
If they did, blame Estevan.
"We're an angry bunch out on the
field. When teams get a first down on
us, it pisses us off. And it's not the kind
of anger we vent at each other.
"We just get mad as a unit, and
focus it on the other team. There's
such a high level of intensity among us.
And it's a very steady level — you look
at the other guys in the huddle, and
you know they're every bit as intense
as you are."
That kind of play has much to do
with the fact that the defense has
grown up together. A lot of the current
starters have been in that role for three
years.
"As a defense, we've known this was
going to be our year. We played togeth
er as sophomores and juniors, and now
we've made it to the national scene.
"We're kind of like a big family, me
and my 10 guys on defense. And we feel
like our group is better than the
[opposing] offense. It's like, no matter
what they do, we know we can stop
them."
And if somebody just "pisses off'
Avila and his family enough, the 11
Angry Men just might prove him
right.
