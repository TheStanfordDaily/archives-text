# Soccer tackles Berkeley turf, starts big homestand Sunday
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
After mercilessly pummeling the St. Mary's Gaels
3-0 on Wednesday, the Stanford men's soccer team
will hit the road to face a struggling California team
on their home AstroTurf.
Both coaches have agreed that no matter what
kind of soccer is played tomorrow, the artificial grass
will be the equalizing and possibly deciding factor.

'When you look at the comparative
stats you can see that Stanford
should beat us pretty good. They
ought to win five or six to nothing.'
— California head coach Dave Chaplik

"The leveler will definitely be the turf," said
Stanford coach Colin Lindores. "It will be a tough
game for us if we don't succeed early. We have the
better talent, but that talent must be executed by
scoring goals. Otherwise, the other team has a
chance to stay with you and win the game — espe
cially on the unpredictable turf."
Like Lindores, Golden Bear coach Dave Chaplik
is also skeptical about the quality of play on the arti
ficial surface, but he is less confident about his
team's ability to stand up against a strong Division I
challenger such as the Cardinal (9-4-0, 3-1 in Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation action).
"It will be a fast game favoring skilled and speedy
players, which, in honesty, we don't have," Chaplik
said. "There will be many uncontrolled situations as
the ball tends to take abnormal bounces, and for
that reason we haven't even practiced on our home
field.
"When you look at the comparative stats you can

see that Stanford should beat us pretty good. They
ought to win five or six to nothing. It does not look
like it's going to be a great match on paper. Stanford
is the stronger team, and that's a matter of fact.
We're certainly the underdog."
The statistics do show a need for concern on the
California sideline.
Their leading scorer, forward Steve Coppedge,
has only two goals and no assists.
On the other hand, the Cardinal will be led by
midfielder Jason Vanacour, who has six goals and
one assist. Right behind him is Ryan Collins, who
has totaled four goals and two assists.
As a team, the Golden Bears (3-7-1, 0-3 in confer
ence play) have scored 10 total goals while giving up
20 on defense. The Cardinal has tallied 26 goals
while allowing their opponents only 13. Despite the
vast difference in ability, Stanford, is being extreme
ly cautious due to the importance of the conference
game.
"It's essentially a match that means much more
to us than it does to them," Lindores said. "But
knowing what kind of rivalry we're in, they would
love to play the part of the spoiler."
Vanacour is also being cautious about the
lopsided match-up on paper. "Even if Cal is as
bad as [ Chaplik I says, the turf will decide the
game.
Ever since 1 was a freshman here, this team has
never fared well on turf. We have lost games to
teams whom we have no business losing to. So,
you never know what will happen with us on the
turf."
The Golden Bears have yet to win a conference
game this season and, despite any reservations the
Cardinal might have about the Astro Turf, their
chances tomorrow do not look too promising with
Stanford rolling into town under a full head of
steam and momentum.
The Cardinal will follow its trip to Berkeley with
a long homestand, which opens with a match against
conference rival Fresno State on Sunday at 2 p.m. at
Maloney Field.
