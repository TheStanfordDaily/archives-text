# Women travel to Santa Barbara, look to rebound against Gauchos
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's soccer
team faces yet another crunch
match Sunday when the Cardi
nal travels to UC-Santa Barbara
to battle the Gauchos.
This weekend's contest is one
of six left in the regular season
all of which are crucial to the
team, according to Stanford
coach Berhane Andeberhan.
"We're ranked ahead of all the
teams left so we really need to do
our jobs and win the rest of our
games," he said.
While one loss would probably
not knock the Cardinal out of
playoff contention, with only 12
total spots in the NCAA Held and
four first-round byes available, a
defeat could put the Cardinal
near the brink.
Santa Barbara won't make it
easy for Stanford to take the
next step toward the playoffs.

The Gauchos play a similar game
to the Cardinal, emphasizing
skill and execution.
"They are a very good techni
cal, tactical team," Andeberhan
said. "They're not like a lot of the
teams we've faced who are just
into destructive football."
UCSB also differs from recent
Cardinal opponents in that the
squad prefers to move the ball
along the sidelines, not up the
middle.
"We forced them to the middle
last year and shut them down
that way, so we'll probably do the
same this time," said Stanford
forward Andrea Johnson.
But the match Sunday may be
more difficult, as the contest is
being held at UCSB and the Gau
chos have a distinct home-field
advantage. The Cardinal is win
less in Santa Barbara and the
Gauchos are 5-0 at home this
year.
"We've never beaten them in

Santa Barbara and we need to
change that," Andeberhan said.
"We've played them well in the
past couple of years. Last year
the two teams were just about
equal and we played an excellent
game to win."
While Andeberhan believes
that the Cardinal, at its best, can
beat UCSB, he's not sure
whether his team will match last
year's effort.
Stanford played just well
enough to edge Cal 1-0 Wednes
day, two days after falling to No.
1 North Carolina.
"The most important thing
was to bounce back from the
loss," Andeberhan said of the
sometimes sluggish Bear
game.
"I accept the performance
under the circumstances, but
now we have to move forward.
We need to add a little bit to our
arsenal without sacrificing what
we've already done."
