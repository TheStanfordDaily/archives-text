Cross country
The Cardinal men's and women's cross coun
try teams — led by senior Gary Stolz and junior
transfer Louise Watson, respectively — head to
Tempe this weekend to compete in the Arizona
State Invitational.
Stanford's main competition will most likely
come from nationally-ranked squads from Ari
zona, New Mexico and Wyoming, and the meet
should serve as a prelude to the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships, to take place on the
Stanford Golf Course on Oct. 31.
Water polo
The Cardinal water polo team will take a tem
porary hiatus from conference action tomorrow
as it matches wits with 1992 Olympian Erich Fis
cher and other Stanford program grads in the
annual Alumni Game, to be held at 10 a.m. at
deGuerre Pool. The game will not count in the

team's standings.
The No. 2-ranked Cardinal (15-2) will return
to regular-season action in the Pacific-Mountain
Conference Tourney next Saturday and Sunday
at Long Beach.
Men's Tennis
Stanford's Michael Flanagan was a winner
twice over yesterday in the Volvo All-American
Tennis Tournament in Austin, Texas.
The junior emerged victorious in his round-of
-32 singles match, defeating Simon Cornish of
Wichita State 6-2, 6-2.
He took his doubles match with partner Robert
Devens with a 6-4, 6-1 drubbing of Notre Dame's
Will Forsythe and Andy Zurcher in a rematch of
last year's NCAA Championship teams.
The only down note for the Cardinal came in a
loss by Chris Cocotos and Vimal Patel, who suf
fered a 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 defeat to Dan Courcol and
Laurent Miquelard of Mississippi State.
