# University kicks out White Plaza vendors due to tax flap
## 
### Alexa Lee Staff writer 
The vendors in White Plaza — for years considered
by many an integral part of campus — were notified
yesterday by University officials that they will not be
permitted to conduct their business on University
land beginning Nov. 1.
According to a letter handed out to the vendors, the
University "could be liable for sales taxes not collect
ed and paid to the state" by vendors who do not com
ply with California State Board of Equalization laws.
In addition, "The commercial nature of the ven

dors could jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the
land." Stanford is divided into taxed and non-taxed
areas; White Plaza is a non-taxed area of the campus,
but businesses such as the Bookstore and certain
parts of Tresidder are located on taxed land.
Due to staff cuts, Tresidder's Meeting Services of
fice — which conducts daily checks on the vendors to in
sure the vendors hold a state business license and com
ply with the office's guidelines — is no longer able to
monitor the vendor's activities, the letter also stated.
"We felt that there were other things on campus
that needed our attention and we had to do what was
in the best interest of the University," said Paul

Szczesiul, associate director of Tresidder. "There are
some state laws that we are bound to comply with and
that subject us to liability. With the vendors, we aren't
getting anything tangible by lettingthem sell there."
David Anderson, a freelance designer who has
been selling his goods at Stanford for more than 14
years, said he can empathize with Szczesiul but be
lieves the decision was made without careful consid
eration of alternatives.
"I understand that it is not Stanford's mission to
police other people's tux business, but it also seems
that it is not willing to put energy into preserving the
character and atmosphere that has been a part of this

particular area for decades," he said.
"Most people who sell here follow the rules," he
said, but conceded, "There are also those who don't
and abuse the privilege of being here."
However, Szczesiul points out that even if all ven
dors comply with the rules and regulations that
might allow them to stay, the fact remains that com
mercial activity would still be conducted on tax-ex
empt land.
If this activity were a part of a non-profit organiza
tion however, it could be permissible, Szczesiul said.
