# Stanford Shoot Out format marks return of team golf
## 
### SooSang Park 
Last spring Stanford men's
golf coach Wally Goodwin won
dered, "How can we make golf
really look like a team sport?"
After speaking with a number
of coaches around the country,
Coach Goodwin made a propos
al for a tournament to the
NCAA
The result is this weekend's
first-ever Stanford Shoot Out, in
which the men's golf team will
square off amidst a 24-team field
at our own Stanford Golf Course.
The Stanford Shoot Out,
which begins tomorrow at 7:30
a.m., will employ a number of spe
cial rule changes which will veer
away from the normal NCAA
tournament format.
First of all, "team golf' will be
played. Usually a team's number
one player is assigned to play with
other teams' number one players,
the number two player with other
teams' number twos, and so
forth; in effect, each individual
golfer is left to attack the course
on his own. This weekend, howev
er, all five members of a team will
play together, moving from hole
to hole as a unit.
The advice rule has also been
waived. In a regular NCAA event,
the players are forbidden to con
verse with each other, and the
only person allowed to talk to a
player is his coach. But when the
golfers tee off this Saturday, they
will be allowed to speak to each
other freely throughout play.
"Now the guys can help each
other out, give each other advice,
put a supportive arm on a team
mate's back. It should make it
more of a team sport," Goodwin
said.

Finally, in an effort to speed up
play, "ready golf' will be
employed. Normally when players
reach the green or the fringe of
the green, the golfer whose ball is
furthest from the hole is expected
to take his shot first, but in
"ready golf' the opposite will be
the case.

'Spectators should
be cheering if their
team is doing well,
crying if they're not.
We'll try to get some
emotion out there.'
â€” Wally Goodwin

The player who is closest will
be expected to putt out the hole.
The rule change is designed so
that a golfer will not have to putt,
then stop, mark his spot, and
have to wait for the next furthest
player's putt. Instead, each player
will hole out, beginning with
whomever is closest, thus elimi
nating the wait between shots.
Although this tournament will
employ a special format, the
NCAA has sanctioned this event,
and all the results will count
toward a team's season standings.
Coach Goodwin is hoping the
rule changes will make it easier
for spectators to follow the teams'
progress
"Spectators should be cheering
if their team is doing well, crying
if they're not," said the coach.
"We'll try to get some emotion out

there."
A strong field is expected to
compete this weekend. In atten
dance will be Duke, who has
already won a tournament and
placed second in another this sea
son, as well as Pepperdine, who is
fielding "their best team in
years," according to Coach Good
win.
Other schools expected to have
a strong showing are Michigan,
Indiana, Virginia, and Texas A &
M. Arch-rival California will also
be competing.
Even though the Stanford
men's team is playing on their
home course, Coach Goodwin
does not feel that this will give
them any true advantage since
the team is so young.
"We'll have an advantage over
other teams of comparable experi
ence, but there will no real advan
tage over the older teams since
collegiate playing experience i8
what really pays," the coach said.
"It's easier on the team and nice
to play at home, but I think the
guys tend to be more focused
when they're away, having to
really bear down on a new
course."
The 72-hole tournament will
start this Saturday and will con
tinue through Monday. Satur
day's shotgun start, in which
everyone begins play at the same
time, is at 7.30 a.m. On both Sun
day and Monday, play is set to
start at 8:30 a.m.
This weekend's tourney will be
a trial event, and the NCAA Golf
Committee should have its eyes
on the Shoot Out. "Hopefully we
can make a contribution to colle
giate play. It's a shot. If it work*,
it will be a good plug for college
golf," Coach Goodwin said.
