# Milburn joins Greeks as fierce competition heats up
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
Greeks, Greeks, Greeks. It
conjures up images of late nights
in New Jersey, plates full of
gravy-covered fries and waitress
es with more makeup than a Tim
Burton movie.
And like those Paul Reiser
esque arguments over who's
going to finish the sandwich, the
Greeks once again battle it out in
a pointless argument over guys
who could eat the whole left half
of the menu at will.
But, truly, the Greeks mean
much more than that. Like Stan
ford's scholar-athlete, the Greek
stands for the merger of mind
and sport. Like Stanford's
unabashed free-thinker, the
Greek stands for taking risks.
And like a bitter, spurned Stan
ford lover, the Greek stands for
that guy tied to the rocks while
vultures tear out his liver.
This week, the Greeks (122-
38) are aided by the undeniably
knowledgeable, questionably
objective and stridently-hetero
sexual Glyn Milburn.
Milburn, a Heisman candidate
who looks nothing like that guy
on the trophy if you know what I
mean, a public policy scholar and
a successful, er, a commendable

politician, is the only Greek in
history to have appeared in Play
boy magazine fully clothed.
Apparently woozy with excite
ment over drawing into Potter,
Milburn picked perennial arch
rival and pesky nemesis Berkeley.
Might he be a cleverly placed dou
ble-agent, willing to play his heart
our for his entire career, only to
wait until Big Game of his final
year and then take back those 50-
yard-line seats? You decide. And
you try to find those seats.
Milburn was also the only one
to pick Oklahoma the school he
attended for one year before
transferring here. Coincidence? I
think not.
The Redskins topped Milburn's
list as well. Is he shamelessly kiss
ing up, looking for a job like an
econ major at a career fair ? Again,
the evidence speaks for itself.
The other Greeks, the ones we
know and love, have a particular
vengeance this week. If they can
beat an actual player, a good
player, then might they not
redeem the years spent patheti
cally enslaving themselves to
heroes like Milburn — at least in
their own tiny, sick minds? The
prospects are frightening.
Hopefully, Milburn won't let
us down. I, for one, would prefer
he didn't.

Greeks, Greeks, Greeks. It
conjures up images of late nights
in New Jersey, plates full of
gravy-covered fries and waitress
es with more makeup than a Tim
Burton movie.
And like those Paul Reiser
esque arguments over who's
going to finish the sandwich, the
Greeks once again battle it out in
a pointless argument over guys
who could eat the whole left half
of the menu at will.
But, truly, the Greeks mean
much more than that. Like Stan
ford's scholar-athlete, the Greek
stands for the merger of mind
and sport. Like Stanford's
unabashed free-thinker, the
Greek stands for taking risks.
And like a bitter, spurned Stan
ford lover, the Greek stands for
that guy tied to the rocks while
vultures tear out his liver.
This week, the Greeks (122-
38) are aided by the undeniably
knowledgeable, questionably
objective and stridently-hetero
sexual Glyn Milburn.
Milburn, a Heisman candidate
who looks nothing like that guy
on the trophy if you know what I
mean, a public policy scholar and
a successful, er, a commendable

politician, is the only Greek in
history to have appeared in Play
boy magazine fully clothed.
Apparently woozy with excite
ment over drawing into Potter,
Milburn picked perennial arch
rival and pesky nemesis Berkeley.
Might he be a cleverly placed dou
ble-agent, willing to play his heart
our for his entire career, only to
wait until Big Game of his final
year and then take back those 50-
yard-line seats? You decide. And
you try to find those seats.
Milburn was also the only one
to pick Oklahoma the school he
attended for one year before
transferring here. Coincidence? I
think not.
The Redskins topped Milburn's
list as well. Is he shamelessly kiss
ing up, looking for a job like an
econ major at a career fair ? Again,
the evidence speaks for itself.
The other Greeks, the ones we
know and love, have a particular
vengeance this week. If they can
beat an actual player, a good
player, then might they not
redeem the years spent patheti
cally enslaving themselves to
heroes like Milburn — at least in
their own tiny, sick minds? The
prospects are frightening.
Hopefully, Milburn won't let
us down. I, for one, would prefer
he didn't.
