# Spikers seek 'Evergreen Sweep' as Washington schools visit
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
After scoring a 3-0 win over rival
California and amassing a 12-1 record
at the midway point in the season, you
might expect the second-ranked Stan
ford women's volleyball team to smile a
little more often.
If you do, you just don't know this
team.
"Our execution could have been
much better," said head coach Don
Shaw, immediately after sweeping the
Bears out of Maples Pavilion 15-13, 15-
12, 15-3. "We had problems all night on
the serve-and-set, and Bev (Oden) had
two blockers on her the whole match."
Shaw and his Cardinal team will
have another chance to improve their
game when they take on Washington
State and Washington this weekend at
Maples. Stanford will host the Cougars
(13-4, 4-3 in Pacific 10 Conference play)
tonight, then meet the No. 21 Huskies
(6-5, 3-4 in the Pac-10) on Saturday.
Both matches start at 7:30 p.m.

'UCLA will always be in the back of our minds. We
can't afford to look past the match we're playing next
weekend or two days from now.'
— Don Shaw

The Cougars are led by all-Pac-10
senior setter Keri Killebrew and junior
middle blocker Carrie Gilley. Killebrew
leads the team in aces (20) and digs
(142), and is hitting .342 with 93 kills in
62 games. Gilley is hitting .343 this
year, and leads the team in kills with
195.
Washington State finished fourth in
the Pac-10 last year and went to the
NCAA Tournament, where they were
ousted in the first round by New Mexi
co. Shaw expects them to be every bit as
tough this year.
"They're a good team," said Shaw.
"They're one of those teams that need
just one or two wins over a top national
contender to reach the big time."

Stanford swept the Cougars 3-0 in
each of the matches the two teams
played last year, and has won its last 12
Pac-10 matches against Washington
State.
Washington travels to Stanford tied
for fifth place in the Pac-10. The
Huskies are led by senior Ashleigh
Robertson, the team leader in digs (137)
and kills (129), and the tongue-tying
sophomore Dragana Djordjevic, who
has tallied 113 kills and 16 aces for the
team this year. Stanford swept both
matches against the Huskies last year,
3-0.
The Cardinal will face a swing
offense in Washington — the offense
used by the U.S. Olympic volleyball

team. The rotation involves two main
passers receiving serve and employs
four full-time hitters, as opposed to the
standard five-one or six-two offenses
used by most collegiate teams.
"The two passers in the formation
need to be good, or the swing won't
work," Shaw said. "We've seen this
offense before, and we can usually han
dle it."
Stanford has won four straight
against the Huskies in Pac-10 play, and
leads the overall series 13-2, 11-1 in
Pac-10 competition.
"This is a tough weekend to prepare
for," said Shaw. "Having our week bro
ken up by Cal on Tuesday means we
only get two days to prepare for the
weekend, so we have to work harder to
be ready."
Expectations are rightfully high on
this Cardinal squad. Shaw has taken
the team to the Final Four four times in
the past eight years, and Stanford has
played in the championship match
three out of those four times. But the
championship ring remains elusive for

the Stanford Cardinal, and that is due,
in large part, to a team from Los Ange
les.
"UCLA will always be in the back of
our minds," said Shaw. "We can't
afford to look past the match we're
playing next weekend or two days from
now, but we all know that if we're going
all the way, we'll have to go through
them."
