Student party planners sampled ser
vices ranging from karaokes to caterers
yesterday courtesy of the University, but

parties.

cracking down on any particular violation,
Hanrahan said, they will continue to "en

Dean of Students Michael Jackson
told the participants, half of whom were
freshmen, that Stanford hopes to see
many "successful, well-managed, fun
