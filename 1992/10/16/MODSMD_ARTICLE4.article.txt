# Pros provide party planning options
## Speakers offer 100 social chairs alternatives to alcohol for dorm events 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Student party planners sampled ser
vices ranging from karaokes to caterers
yesterday courtesy of the University, but
only after being informed of Stanford's
alcohol and liability policies.
About 100 dorm and organization so
cial chairs attended the Event Planning
Faire in Tresidder Union, sponsored by
the group Party Pros — formerly known
as R2ISC, Risk Reduction of Intoxicants
in the Stanford Community.
The Faire's first hour was dedicated
to such issues as liability, alcohol policy
and insurance. Formerly known as "Lia
bility and You," the Faire's featured
speakers included representatives from

the police and fire departments, the legal
office and various student services.
Sergeant Tim Hanrahan of the Stan
ford Police emphasized the importance

'We are not prohibi
tionists or anti-alcohol.'
— Stewart Kiner

of "establishing lines of communication"
between the police and those planning
parties.
While police will not specifically be
cracking down on any particular violation,
Hanrahan said, they will continue to "en
force the laws of the State of California."

Dean of Students Michael Jackson
told the participants, half of whom were
freshmen, that Stanford hopes to see
many "successful, well-managed, fun
and safe events."
However, he did warn that the Uni
versity assumes students under 21 will
not be serving alcohol. Jackson also cau
tioned students against possessing and
using fake driver's licenses.
Nancy Howe, director of the Office of
Student Activities, urged students to
avoid an environment where students
are pressured to drink.
Despite the administrators' warn
ings, Party Pros' project coordinator
Stewart Kiner said the program's goal
"is not to scare students about alco
hol. We are not prohibitionists or
anti-alcohol."
R2ISC changed its name to
Party Pros so that the group would
be "more upbeat and geared to the
students and their needs," Kiner

said, whether or not their activities
involve alcohol.
After the speakers, the students
were invited to meet representa
tives of approximately 20 local
companies that know how "to
make parties successful," accord
ing to Kiner.
Among the businesses represent
ed were a plethora of caterers, four
disc-jockey services, two karaoke
companies and a storyteller.

Sophomore Matt Hungerford
said the Faire was "well organized"
and would prove to be "very valu
able" in planning social activities.
Senior Rosa Marie Villagomez
also praised the event, saying it was
"something that has been needed
for a while."
According to Villagomez, one of
the senior class presidents, it was
"very informative to get students
together and hear from the differ

ent departments, since the litera
ture (on University policy) is often
overlooked."
Kiner said he was "very excited"
by the turnout. The Faire accom
plished its goal, he added, by
putting students in touch with
local businesses.
Jackson said he hopes the stu
dents who attended will take
advantage of the "great resources"
available to them.
