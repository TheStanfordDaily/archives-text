# Profs analyze national debate
## Perot only candidate who may have been helped, they say 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
Last night's presidential debate will
have little effect on the race's outcome,
four Stanford professors told students at
Rinconada yesterday in a discussion after
the debate.

The discussion, attended by more than 60
students, touched on issues ranging from the
effects of mass media to the impact of Ross
Perot. Political Science Prof. David Brady,
Political Science Chair John Ferejohn,
Assoc. Political Science Prof Luis Fragn and
Economics Lecturer Tim Taylor answered
students' questions for 90 minutes.
The professors agreed on most issues
about the debate and all said they didn't
think it would have any sizeable effect on
the election's outcome, except to possibly
help Perot.
"I don't think there was any m^jor

change because of the debate tonight,"
Fraga said. "I was quite surprised how fo
cused it was."
Ferejohn said he thought Bush may
have hurt his chances by making ofT-hand
comments and only defending his record.
Brady added, "|Bush| needed to win and
he didn't, but I don't see how he could
have."
Taylor spoke repeatedly about the can
didates' economic plans and explained past
economic records of the Republicans and
Democrats to students. He called Clinton a
"supply-side Democrat," joking that one of
Clinton's philosophies is, "I talk about rais
ing taxes on foreign corporations because
I'm pretty sure they don't vote."
Responding to the question, "Of the eco
nomic policies available, do any of them
make sense?" Taylor said the answer de
pends on a person's opinion regarding eco
nomics. Bush's plan stresses economic fun
damentals such as maintaining low infla
tion, while Clinton's stresses active eco
nomic policy such as investment and work
er training, he said.
All the professors seemed certain that
Clinton will win the election.
"All Bill Clinton has to be is not George
Bush," Brady said. "This election is about
George Bush."
