# Arizona/Stanford Match-ups
## 
### 
Before the season began, the
team weakness was said to be
inexperience at wide receiver.
While Justin Armour and Mike
Cook were inexperienced, their
performances have been any
thing but a weakness. Armour
currently ranks ninth in the Pac
10 in receiving yards, while team
mate Cook is seventh. Covering
them at times will be Tony Bouie,
who ranks nationally with an
average of .6 interceptions per
game. The sophomore free safety
led the Wildcats in tackles in 1991
and presently leads the Arizona
secondary this year with 24.

Stanford has a good defense. Ari
zona has a good defense. What
does that translate into? A heck of
a lot of punts. Both Josh Miller and
Paul Stonehouse should get their
share, and their performances are
crucial because good field position
for either team could mean the
margin of a winning field goal.
Miller has been superb so far this
season, ranking third in the nation
with 41.9 net yards a kick. Stone
house is not as consistent. While
the senior occasionally booms one,
his 37.6 average ranks last in the
Pac-10.

One of the most famous features
of the Stanford offense is its noto
rious offensive line. The line's
294-lb, 6-6 average is smaller than
last year's, but is still larger than a
great majority of the NFL's O
lines. However, their size has not
seemed to prevent opposing play
ers from getting to Stanford quar
terback Steve Stenstrom, who has
eaten grass often this season.
Senior Glen Cavanaugh and Co.
will need a good game to stop Ari
zona's ferocious blitz. Waldrop,
the centerpiece of a relentless
defensive line, leads his team with
five sacks.

It took a season longer than
expected, but Glyn Milburn is a
legitimate Heisman Trophy can
didate. The fifth-year senior
ranks second in the nation with
211.2 all-purpose yards per
game, and is 24th nationally with
97.5 rushing yards per game.
Milburn is on pace to break Mar
cus Allen's Pac-10 record for sin
gle season all-purpose yards, and
ranks sixth on the all-time Pac
10 list. The responsibility to stop
Stanford's one-man offense rests
partly on the shoulders of Sean
Harris, who leads the Wildcats
with 43 tackles.

Who can forget the ambidextrous
George Malauulu and his second
half wizardry that last year
brought Arizona back from a 17-
0 deficit to beat the Cardinal 28-
23? Not the Stanford defense,
who want revenge in a very big
way. The underrated Jason Fisk
and his fellow defensive linemen
will be called upon to keep the
heat on the opposing quarter
back, as they have been all sea
son. Malauulu, an able runner,
scrambles well and has been
known to run the option effec
tively.

Although Hoover fellow and
small-time sovereign Admiral
James Stockdale may seem like a
bold iiberRepublican upstart, he
doesn't hold a candle to Arizona's
Barry Goldwater. A couple of
years as president of the wannabe
military university The Citadel
does nothing to instill fear in the
heart like that little girl picking
flowers with the mushroom cloud
in the bathroom. Anyway, at least
Goldwater pulled 38.5 percent.
According to recent polls by The
Daily, Stockdale can't even come
close to carrying his own universi
