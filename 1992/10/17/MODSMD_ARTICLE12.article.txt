# Stenstrom learning more than X's and O's

The Man With Fearless Eyes
joined the huddle.
For a moment, there was
unsettling silence. Then quarter
back Steve Stenstrom began to
speak.
"We can move the ball," he
said.
Ten young men listened
through little holes in their hel
mets, and big holes in their confi
dence. Notre Dame had scored its
second touchdown in less than 10
minutes to leap out to a 16-0 lead,
and the Irish faithful sensed early
blood at South Bend.
But The Man With Fearless
Eyes saw holes in the Irish zone
defense. Thirty-three unan
swered points later, these holes
swallowed up Notre Dame and
vaulted Stanford to a 33-16 victo
ry two weeks ago.
"I credit him a lot for that
comeback," senior wide receiver
Mike Cook said. "He really kept
us upbeat, play after play."
Stenstrom has come a long
way since last fall. Listed third on
the depth charts in 1991, behind
Jason Palumbis and John Lynch,
Stenstrom figured he would see
little time. He was a redshirt
sophomore, uninitiated to the rig
ors of Pac-10 football. However,
Palumbis began to falter and
Lynch switched to strong safety.
Suddenly, Stenstrom became the

starter, and led the team to a sur
prising 8-4 record and a berth in
the Aloha Bowl.
"I learned a lot last year. The
experience has given me a lot
more confidence to compete on
this level," Stenstrom said. Coach
Bill Walsh says Stenstrom has
become a "resourceful leader,
calm and quiet." The now-famil
iar determined gaze has devel
oped from his 11-2 record as a
starter, and consistent success in
big games against California,
UCLA and Notre Dame.
However, Stenstrom takes
the bitter with the sweet. He
absorbs considerable punish
ment in the pocket, and comes
back for more on each down. He
doesn't flinch.
"I treat each play as individual
and separate. You don't think
about getting hit, you think about
what you're coached to do. Each
play is a new experience," the 6 -
2, 200-lb Stenstrom said.
Armed with this attitude, it's
no wonder that Stenstrom sel
dom leaves the pocket. Stenstrom
will roll out on designed plays, but
Walsh believes "his best game is
to stay in the pocket. He's not
particularly explosive, he's
smooth. Stenstrom throws a soft
pass which is easy to catch.... He
just needs to get the ball away
quicker."
Stenstrom says he has learned
greater mobility in the pocket to
