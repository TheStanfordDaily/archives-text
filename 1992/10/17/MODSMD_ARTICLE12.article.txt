# Stenstrom learning more than X's and O's

### QuinnMoo Staff writer 
The Man With Fearless Eyes
joined the huddle.
For a moment, there was
unsettling silence. Then quarter
back Steve Stenstrom began to
speak.
"We can move the ball," he
said.
Ten young men listened
through little holes in their hel
mets, and big holes in their confi
dence. Notre Dame had scored its
second touchdown in less than 10
minutes to leap out to a 16-0 lead,
and the Irish faithful sensed early
blood at South Bend.
But The Man With Fearless
Eyes saw holes in the Irish zone
defense. Thirty-three unan
swered points later, these holes
swallowed up Notre Dame and
vaulted Stanford to a 33-16 victo
ry two weeks ago.
"I credit him a lot for that
comeback," senior wide receiver
Mike Cook said. "He really kept
us upbeat, play after play."
Stenstrom has come a long
way since last fall. Listed third on
the depth charts in 1991, behind
Jason Palumbis and John Lynch,
Stenstrom figured he would see
little time. He was a redshirt
sophomore, uninitiated to the rig
ors of Pac-10 football. However,
Palumbis began to falter and
Lynch switched to strong safety.
Suddenly, Stenstrom became the

starter, and led the team to a sur
prising 8-4 record and a berth in
the Aloha Bowl.
"I learned a lot last year. The
experience has given me a lot
more confidence to compete on
this level," Stenstrom said. Coach
Bill Walsh says Stenstrom has
become a "resourceful leader,
calm and quiet." The now-famil
iar determined gaze has devel
oped from his 11-2 record as a
starter, and consistent success in
big games against California,
UCLA and Notre Dame.
However, Stenstrom takes
the bitter with the sweet. He
absorbs considerable punish
ment in the pocket, and comes
back for more on each down. He
doesn't flinch.
"I treat each play as individual
and separate. You don't think
about getting hit, you think about
what you're coached to do. Each
play is a new experience," the 6 -
2, 200-lb Stenstrom said.
Armed with this attitude, it's
no wonder that Stenstrom sel
dom leaves the pocket. Stenstrom
will roll out on designed plays, but
Walsh believes "his best game is
to stay in the pocket. He's not
particularly explosive, he's
smooth. Stenstrom throws a soft
pass which is easy to catch.... He
just needs to get the ball away
quicker."

avoid the rush and sometimes will
dump the ball to an outlet receiv
er, such as halfback Glyn Mil
burn. These changes in Sten
strom reflect the greater change
in philosophy from former head
coach Denny Green to Bill Walsh.
"We had a similar offense but
emphasized different plays last
year," Stenstrom said.
In order to fulfill his new role,
Stenstrom constantly reviews
game film, meets with staff, and
enacts Walsh's X's and O's on the
practice field over and over again.
"We script every play for the
entire week. Some plays we repeat
every day. This way the players
know what plays to run, and we can
coach them on that," Walsh said.
Often Stenstrom will give feed
back to the coaching staff, but rec
ognizes the teacher-pupil rela
tionship is not to be crossed. "I'll
say which ones I feel comfortable
with, but it's nothing where I'm
designing anything — it's Bill
Walsh's offense," he said.
Along with a new offense, Sten
strom also had to adjust to a new
corps of wide receivers: sophomore
flanker Justin Armour and Cook.

Over the summer, Stenstrom
said he and the receivers "worked
together a lot, throwing thou
sands and thousands of balls to
each other" to improve timing and
familiarity. The workouts have
benefitted Armour and Cook: they
lead the Cardinal in receiving
yards and number of receptions.
Stenstrom has completed 113 of
187 passes for 1335 yards in six
games so far, and has tossed seven
touchdowns. Decent numbers, but
less than what you'd expect from an
offense molded by someone voted
the NFL Coach of the Decade.
Walsh acknowledges the
offense's inconsistency, but notes
that the learning and developing
process is not over. At times Sten
strom has called audible plays, only
to have backs line up incorrectly.
To ease the process and lend
stability, Walsh choreographs the
opening 25 plays in sequence.
"Preparation is absolutely criti
cal. The fewer decisions made under
stress, the better," Walsh said.
But if Stenstrom must alter a
play in. response to changing
defenses, Walsh can trust- the
junior quarterback to come
through.
"He retains what we tell him.
People can memorize every play,
but they fall apart under fire. He's
cool under pressure," Walsh said.

and the Irish faithful sensed early
blood at South Bend.
But The Man With Fearless
Eyes saw holes in the Irish zone
defense. Thirty-three unan
swered points later, these holes
swallowed up Notre Dame and
vaulted Stanford to a 33-16 victo
ry two weeks ago.
"I credit him a lot for that
comeback," senior wide receiver
Mike Cook said. "He really kept
us upbeat, play after play."
Stenstrom has come a long
way since last fall. Listed third on
the depth charts in 1991, behind
Jason Palumbis and John Lynch,
Stenstrom figured he would see
little time. He was a redshirt
sophomore, uninitiated to the rig
ors of Pac-10 football. However,
Palumbis began to falter and
Lynch switched to strong safety.
Suddenly, Stenstrom became the

starter, and led the team to a sur
prising 8-4 record and a berth in
the Aloha Bowl.
"I learned a lot last year. The
experience has given me a lot
more confidence to compete on
this level," Stenstrom said. Coach
Bill Walsh says Stenstrom has
become a "resourceful leader,
calm and quiet." The now-famil
iar determined gaze has devel
oped from his 11-2 record as a
starter, and consistent success in
big games against California,
UCLA and Notre Dame.
However, Stenstrom takes
the bitter with the sweet. He
absorbs considerable punish
ment in the pocket, and comes
back for more on each down. He
doesn't flinch.
"I treat each play as individual
and separate. You don't think
about getting hit, you think about
what you're coached to do. Each
play is a new experience," the 6 -
2, 200-lb Stenstrom said.
Armed with this attitude, it's
no wonder that Stenstrom sel
dom leaves the pocket. Stenstrom
will roll out on designed plays, but
Walsh believes "his best game is
to stay in the pocket. He's not
particularly explosive, he's
smooth. Stenstrom throws a soft
pass which is easy to catch.... He
just needs to get the ball away
quicker."

Junior quarterback Steve Stenstrom is showing increasing ability to take command on the field.
avoid the rush and sometimes will
dump the ball to an outlet receiv
er, such as halfback Glyn Mil
burn. These changes in Sten
strom reflect the greater change
in philosophy from former head
coach Denny Green to Bill Walsh.
"We had a similar offense but
emphasized different plays last
year," Stenstrom said.
In order to fulfill his new role,
Stenstrom constantly reviews
game film, meets with staff, and
enacts Walsh's X's and O's on the
practice field over and over again.
"We script every play for the
entire week. Some plays we repeat
every day. This way the players
know what plays to run, and we can
coach them on that," Walsh said.
Often Stenstrom will give feed
back to the coaching staff, but rec
ognizes the teacher-pupil rela
tionship is not to be crossed. "I'll
say which ones I feel comfortable
with, but it's nothing where I'm
designing anything — it's Bill
Walsh's offense," he said.
Along with a new offense, Sten
strom also had to adjust to a new
corps of wide receivers: sophomore
flanker Justin Armour and Cook.

Over the summer, Stenstrom
said he and the receivers "worked
together a lot, throwing thou
sands and thousands of balls to
each other" to improve timing and
familiarity. The workouts have
benefitted Armour and Cook: they
lead the Cardinal in receiving
yards and number of receptions.
Stenstrom has completed 113 of
187 passes for 1335 yards in six
games so far, and has tossed seven
touchdowns. Decent numbers, but
less than what you'd expect from an
offense molded by someone voted
the NFL Coach of the Decade.
Walsh acknowledges the
offense's inconsistency, but notes
that the learning and developing
process is not over. At times Sten
strom has called audible plays, only
to have backs line up incorrectly.
To ease the process and lend
stability, Walsh choreographs the
opening 25 plays in sequence.
"Preparation is absolutely criti
cal. The fewer decisions made under
stress, the better," Walsh said.
But if Stenstrom must alter a
play in. response to changing
defenses, Walsh can trust- the
junior quarterback to come
through.
"He retains what we tell him.
People can memorize every play,
but they fall apart under fire. He's
cool under pressure," Walsh said.
The Man With Fearless Eyes
joined the huddle.
For a moment, there was
unsettling silence. Then quarter
back Steve Stenstrom began to
speak.
"We can move the ball," he
said.
Ten young men listened
through little holes in their hel
mets, and big holes in their confi
dence. Notre Dame had scored its
second touchdown in less than 10
minutes to leap out to a 16-0 lead,
and the Irish faithful sensed early
blood at South Bend.
