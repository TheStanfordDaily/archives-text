# Stanford Killer 'D' to face 'Desert Swarm'
## 
### Amy Howard Editorial staff 
Today's game against the Wildcats could
mean the difference between a good season
and a great season for the Cardinal.
With each victory this year, Stanford has
been marching into the history books. After
jumping out to a 5-1 overall record (2-0
Pac-10), Stanford has a chance to compile
its best start since 1970, when the Card
went on to beat Ohio State in the Rose
Bowl. Currently ranked No. 8 in the AP
poll, Stanford is enjoying its highest stand
ing in 22 years.
Before you settle back into your seats too
comfortably to watch the game, however,
there are a few more facts to consider.
The Wildcats come into the game after a
week of rest and two impressive showings
against then No.l-ranked Miami and
UCLA. Arizona's defense effectively shut
down both tfeams/allowing the Hurricanes
to squeak by with a score of 8-7 and bull
dozing the Bruins by a score of 23-3.
The last time Stanford lost a conference
game was against Arizona last year, when
the Wildcats came away with a 28-23 victo
ry in Tucson.
There is little question that today's con
test will be a showcase of two of the best
defenses in the country. In overall defense,
Stanford is ranked first in the Pac-10 with
233 yards allowed per game, but Arizona
takes a close second with 267.4. Against the
rush, Stanford is second nationally (77.8
yards per game), while Arizona comes in
third (82.4).
Thanks to their aggressive style of play,
the Wildcats have dubbed their D-men the
"Desert Swarm." In five games, this group
has allowed only four touchdowns, with
none in the first half. Arizona is also tied
with Washington for top honors in

turnover margins, with a healthy 1.8.
Coach Bill Walsh is expecting the 'Cats
to attack junior quarterback Steve Sten
strom hard. "They blitz at opportune
times, and they are intense blitzers,
believe me," he said. "We have to complete
a high percentage of passes; that's our
goal."

In fact, today's game may serve as a lit
mus test for Stenstrom's ability to get rid of
the ball quickly without sacrificing his
accuracy. He has completed 113 of 187
passes on the season for 1,335 yards and
seven touchdowns, but he looked tentative
against UCLA. In several cases, his over
reading of a play ended in an unceremoni

ous sack.
"We're trying to speed up everything,"
Walsh said. "We have to take full advantage
of our size (on the offensive line), and find
the things we can do best."
Among the weapons the Cardinal can
pull from its arsenal is senior halfback Glyn
Milburn. Against UCLA last week, he
returned a punt 75 yards for a touchdown
to break open the game. Although he suf
fered a shoulder injury later on, Milburn
has been practicing lightly this week and is
expected to play. With an average of 211.2
all-purpose yards per game, his name is
quickly becoming a buzzword in the Heis
man trophy candidate circle.
Stanford senior outside linebacker Ron
George played most of last week's game
with a contusion in his leg, but still man
aged to come up with three sacks for -26
yards and force a fumble that resulted in a
safety. His effort earned him honors as the
Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Week.
It is precisely these heroic endeavors, in
spite of injuries, that may begin to catch up
with the Cardinal, however. After several
tough battles, Stanford is feeling a little
bruised. At the same time, Arizona is feel
ing fresh following a week of rest.
"They're 100 percent healthy and we're
banged up, so it's going to be as tough as
they get," Walsh said. "I'm crossing my fin
gers that the home field will at least neu
tralize the advantage they have."
The attitude of the Cardinal defense
alone should be able to overcome any of
their physical sufferings. "We're always
getting mad, especially if they make a first
down," senior right end Estevan Avila said.
"We take that as an insult to our defense.
The intensity level is incredibly high, it's
hard to describe it. We're all working
together and we're all on the same level."
Let the defensive battle begin.
