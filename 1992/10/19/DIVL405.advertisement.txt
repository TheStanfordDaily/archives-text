Welcome To Your First
Week At Microsoft.
At most companies, you'd have to wait
years for this kind of opportunity. At
Microsoft, we value your insights, your
intelligence, your enthusiasm.
Right from day one.
You know you've got what it takes to make
a difference. And you'd like to join other
dynamic people who share that belief. After
all, when your mission is to put people
together with products that will improve their
lives, everybody has to be committed.
If you're not intimidated by responsibility
and enjoy knowing you were a major force in
a product's success, you should be talking to
Microsoft. One of the few places left where
you can experience the thrill of changing the
world on a weekly basis.
Come find out more about Microsoft by
attending our upcoming event.
Microsoft is an Equal Opportunity
Employer and supports workplace diversity.
