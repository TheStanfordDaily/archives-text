# The 						battle of Sand Hill
## Road link clash revived 
### Romesh Ratnesar 
Renewing a 60-year-old struggle, Stanford recent
ly unveiled its latest proposal to extend Sand Hill
Road.
The University's new effort calls for a four-lane ex
tension of Sand Hill to be coupled with an expansion
of the Stanford Shopping Center. Stanford is asking
the city of Palo Alto to pay an unspecified portion of
the estimated $9 million cost of the extension, claim
ing the city will benefit from the shopping center's in
creased sales tax revenue.
Sand Hill Road currently begins four miles south
west of Stanford near Searsville Lake, intersects In
terstate 280 and meanders past the Medical Center to
an end in the shopping center parking lot, a short dis
tance from El Camino Real. The University hopes to
link the road to El Camino.
"It's a win-win situation," said Andy Doty, Stan
ford's director of community affairs. "There would be
a $300,000 increase in [taxi revenue per year. In a few
years, the city would be able to completely recover
[their portion of] the cost."
Doty said the University would benefit from de
creased traffic congestion on Stanford roads near the
shopping center and revenue from new stores in the
mall.
The University's new proposal, however, still faces
some political roadblocks.
Palo Alto Mayor Gary Fazzino, who says he has not
yet seen the proposal, wants any dialogue concerning
extension of Sand Hill linked with discussion of other
community issues. Doty opposes such connections.
Perhaps most importantly, Fazzino wants to rene
gotiate the cost of the city's 100-year lease of El
Camino Park from Stanford. The park, located across
from the shopping center on El Camino, is used pri
marily for recreational purposes.
"If they want us to participate financially, we want
some concessions," Fazzino said. "We can no longer
continue to pay that level of rent, but the park is no
good to Stanford."
The Palo Alto City Council has gone on record in
support of the road's extension, Fazzino said.
The proposed extension would have an indirect im
pact on Menlo Park as well, because of the potential
increase of westbound traffic on El Camino.
According to Doty, three current Menlo Park city
council members appear to be in
favor of an extension, while two
are opposed. That could change,
however, after November's elec
tion for council seats. But such a
reversal would not halt the Uni
versity's plans, Doty claims.
The University's heretofore
futile attempt to extend Sand Hill
dates to the 19305, Doty said.
Projects presented in the last
three years have run into legal and
political battles that have sapped
University funds and patience.
"There was a void of money and
leadership at Stanford, where no
one was making decisions," Fazzi
no said. "It appears that they are
getting their act together."
