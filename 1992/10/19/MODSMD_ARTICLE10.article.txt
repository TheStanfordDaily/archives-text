# Body Shop CEO discusses principles

"If you think education is expensive, try igno
rance," said one side of a big green truck sitting in
front of the Graduate School of Business Friday after
noon.
Inside Bishop Auditorium, more than 350 stu
dents gathered at noon to hear the truck's owner,
Anita Roddick, speak about "Profits with Princi
ples."
Roddick is the founder and managing director of
The Body Shop, a British hair and skin care firm that
promotes environmentalism, social responsibility and
political action.
Roddick said that she was never formally trained
in business and sees herself as "a good old-fashioned
trader." She wanted to talk about values, not money,
she added.
"I run my company as I run my kitchen and my
household: with passion," she said.
Roddick hopes to work toward "a more enlight
ened capitalism," she said, a world where people
aren't afraid that they will fail in business "if they put
values before profit."
Her own company, despite her staunch environ
mentalist values, has been very profitable, with more
than 700 shops in 40 countries. A Body Shop will open
in the Stanford Shopping Center soon.
The company uses close-to-the-source ingredients,
no animal testing and minimal packaging. All prod
ucts are biodegradable.
According to Roddick, the company also runs a refill
service and recycles post-consumer waste. All contain
ers can be returned to the stores, where they are made
into other useful items, such as combs, to be resold.
The Body Shop has also built a factory that puri

fies water. Since all businesses pollute, it only makes
sense that we "clean up our mess," she said.
Roddick said she got her start in 1976 from a
$6,500 bank loan. She remembers wearing jeans and
standing with her two children at her side while ask
ing bank managers for help.
She makes a clear distinction between The Body
Shop and cosmetic corporations. "The beauty busi
ness is at best conventional. At worst, it deeply pisses
me off," she said.
The advertisements that present "pubescent, flaw
less white women is [a result of companies] run by
men," she said. "It's predictable and creates needs
that don't exist."
The cosmetic industry "is pure puffery," she said.
"I want no part of it."
Instead, she said, she "wants a dialogue." The
Body Shop provides information to its customers by
using graphics in its posters, rather than the "com
plex and confusing images of sex and romance" usu
ally seen in cosmetic ads.
A product of the '60s, Roddick sees her stores as
"action stations," she said, places to promote peace,
freedom and a better world.
For example, Body Shop workers have worked to
teach third-world communities how to improve their
skills and process their products, Roddick said.
The company buys goods from these communities
at first-world rates. "Put them in the stores and hope
they sell," Roddick said, describing various products
including hand-made paper from Nepal, Brazilian nut
oil and scrub mitts from Mexico.
Roddick has been a proponent of socially and envi
ronmentally responsible manufacturing for 16 years.
She and The Body Shop have won numerous awards,
including the United Nations' Global 500 Environ
ment Award in 1989.
