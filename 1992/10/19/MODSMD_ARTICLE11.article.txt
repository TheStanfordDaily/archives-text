Clinton gets 10 endorsements
WASHINGTON (AP) — Bill Clinton picked up
endorsements from ten newspapers yesterday,
including at least three that supported President
Bush in 1988 and one that had not backed a
Democrat for president in 142 years.
Four papers — the Chicago Tribune, The Daily
Oklahoman of Oklahoma City, The Florida
Times-Union of Jacksonville and the New Haven
(Conn.) Register — endorsed President Bush.
The Oregonian of Portland, Ore., the oldest

daily newspaper west of the Mississippi River, said
departing from its almost unbroken tradition of
supporting Republicans for the presidency wasn't
even a close call.
The newspaper had supported Republicans for
president consistently except for 1964, when it
did not make a choice between President Lyndon
B. Johnson and Sen. Barry Goldwater.
The Oregonian said Bush has been "a massive
disappointment as president," while Clinton has
been "pragmatic, tough, focused, controversial —
and effective" as governor of Arkansas.
