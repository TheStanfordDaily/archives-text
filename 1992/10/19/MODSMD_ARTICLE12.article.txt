Earthquake hits Colombia
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The second severe
earthquake to hit Colombia in two days rocked
cities yesterday and set off an eruption at thermal
baths in the Northwest, burying a house in mud
and raining burning rock on villagers.
Four people were missing and feared dead, and
scores were injured after mud and steam blasted
from a mountain near the baths at San Pedro de
Uraba, northwest of Medellin, town said. Two other
people were reported killed elsewhere in the country.
The quake measured 7.2 on the Richter scale
and struck at 10:12 a.m., according to the U.S.
Geological Survey's National Earthquake Infor
mation Center in Golden, Colo.
New Kuwaiti cabinet sworn in
KUWAIT (AP) — A 16-member Cabinet that
includes six politicians drawn from opposition
ranks was sworn in yesterday.

The Cabinet also includes four members of the
ruling family in addition to Sheik Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah, the crown prince and prime minister.
Opposition figures welcomed the appointment
of six of their own — the largest number ever in
the Cabinet — but said too many key ministries,
such as interior, defense and foreign affairs
remained in the hands of the al-Sabahs, who have
ruled Kuwait for 250 years.
