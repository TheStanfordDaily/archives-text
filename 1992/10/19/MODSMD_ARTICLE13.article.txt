# Chinese Communist Congress accepts new, younger leaders
## 
### 
BEIJING (AP) - The Commu
nist Party, holding what is likely to
be its last congress under
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping,
approved a new, slightly younger
group of leaders yesterday that
excluded ranking hard-liners.
The congress closed with a reso
lution praising Deng and his policy
of adopting capitalist practices to
preserve Communist rule.
Red flags and a huge hammer
and sickle decorated the Great Hall
of the People, where delegates
chose the 319-member Central
Committee. Then the delegates
stood to hear the "Internationale,"
the anthem of the shrinking world
communist movement.
The Central Committee ratifies
major policy decisions, and party

leaders hope the new committee
will ensure a smooth transition
after the death of Deng and other
revolutionaries who have dominat
ed the party for more than a decade.
But previous efforts at arrang
ing a succession have failed, and
there is no guarantee the leaders'
plan will work this time.
Deng, 88, did not attend the
congress, but was its dominant
force. He and the other party
elders scripted it beforehand, set
ting the tone of the speeches and
choosing the candidates for the
Central Committee.
The state-run Xinhua News
Agency said nearly half the com
mittee members were new and 61
percent were below age 55, "evi
dence that the Communist Party

of China is full of vigor and vitality
and has a train of successors."
The committee also included
more military officers and quite a
few members from the southeast
ern provinces that have led the way
in developing a market economy.
Former committee members
who resigned included President
Yang Shangkun, 85, legislative
chairman Wan Li, 76, and other
elderly veterans. They are believed
to have stepped down voluntarily
to make way for younger people.
The resignation of Beijing party
boss Li Ximing, acting Culture
Minister He Jingzhe, People's
Daily editor Gao Di and a few other
hard-liners, however, reflected the
defeat of their efforts to make ideo
logical purity dominate the party.
