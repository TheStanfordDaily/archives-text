JERUSALEM (AP) — Angry Israelis yesterday
called for increased protection for Jews in the occu
pied territories to stop a wave of violence that has
taken three Israeli lives in the past week.
The pressure on the left-center government of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to crack down on the
Arabs could affect the Middle East peace talks,
which are to resume in Washington on Wednesday.
Dozens of Jewish settlers marched yesterday out
side Rabin's home in Jerusalem to demand more
police patrols for their communities.
In another protest near the Palestinian town of
Ramallah, about two dozen settlers smashed win

dows of Arab-owned cars and houses and set tires
ablaze before being dispersed by the army.
The demonstrations came just hours after an
Israeli woman burned to death in a van that explod
ed after it triggered a trip-wire roadside bomb.
The hard-line Likud linked the surge in violence to
efforts by the Rabin government to speed up the Mid
dle East peace process by seeking compromises with
the Palestinians and neighboring Arab countries.
Moshe Katzav, the Likud's leader in parliament,
said the government must "make it unequivocally
clear that by terrorist actions (Arabs) will not
receive any political concessions."
