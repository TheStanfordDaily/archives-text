Stockdale should seize
the issue while under
the national spotlight

JAMES STOCKDALE has fall
en. But there's still time for
him to get up.
Although he may have appeared
unprepared, unsure and unready
during the vice-presidential
debate, retired Vice Admiral Stock
dale can still play an important
role in this very odd, very watched
election year.
Even more than Ross Perot,
Stockdale has made his mark as
the foil to national American poli
tics. At the debate, he played the
normal, if slightly senile, guy — as
if he were randomly selected from
audience — to the smarmy demo
cratic and republican vice-presi
dential candidates.
He said what most Americans
would have said if shoved up onto
a podium without notes or prepa
ration.
He gained the nation's empathy, if
not their respect. Now, Stockdale has
two weeks and a day to gain that.
As a vice-presidential candidate
with little chance of winning,
Stockdale must use his moment in
the light to establish his own
cause. And that cause must be as
simple, clear and readily-embrace
able as was his grandfatherly way
of subtly upstaging Gore and
Quayle.
Unlike any of the six other candi
dates, Stockdale has devoted his life
to the university. He has referred to
himself as an "academic," served as
president of The Citadel, taught
classes in Stanford's philosophy
department and is a fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
A unique opportunity exists for
Stockdale to offer real solutions to
the problems facing our public and
post-secondary schools. Stockdale
has personal experience with these
problems, and would be greatly

respected as a spokesman for edu
cation.
This is his one opportunity to be
listened to by such a large audi
ence— and one of the few times
that audience will be willing to lis
ten to radical solutions.
Our public schools are in dire
need of restructuring, and handing
out vouchers or sitting back and
watching Chris Whittle create his
own McDonalds of education
aren't the answers.
Perot's bottom up-approach
should be applied to this situation
now — and Stockdale should be
made it's spokesman. New, more
equitable funding is needed to
schools in the inner city, before they
need to be taken over by their
respective state governments — like
Jersey City was several years ago.
Our "factory-system," a clock
punching method of shoving chil
dren through our public-system,
needs to be revamped to keep up
with the needs of today's job mar
kets. Not everyone benefits from a
college education — and those who
don't should be provided with mar
ketable skills.
Directly related to Stockdale's
personal experience is the pressing
need to make college more afford
able. As tuition continues to sky
rocket, financial aid and federal
funding must be stepped up to pre
vent our universities from becom
ing further stratified by wealth.
Stockdale could strike the heart
of the concerns of the middle-class
by dealing with the problem of col
lege tuition. Parents begin saving
for, and fretting over, tuition
money upon conception. And the
problem isn't getting any better.
Just as Perot is the only candi
date who can afford to question
the sacred, dying cow of Social
Security, Stockdale can address
the question of our schools, and
how they need to be restructured,
refunded and reconsidered.
Because if Stockdale doesn't do
something in the next two weeks
and one day, his opportunity to
contribute anything concrete will
have been squandered.
