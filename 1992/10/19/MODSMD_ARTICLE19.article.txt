## Culture needs to be shared 
### 
WHAT IS IT about American cul
ture that makes it so damn hard
to put a definitive finger on?
There doesn't seem to be an arena of
American life that can be summed up
succinctly. Garth Brooks tops the charts
at the same time as MC Hammer. We
invented the hamburger, but we eat more
pizza than anything else and pay a suspi
cious homage to Taco Bell every time a
new building is erected on campus.
Depending on where you've celebrated
your Friday nights during the past few
years, you spent the evening square danc
ing, break dancing, doing the lambada
and more.
None of these alone express American
Culture. But each has reserved a spot in
the history of trends and developments
which have shaped our society and none
can be ignored.
The portrait of America isn't an ele
gant oil painting in the same sense that a
Da Vinci work can serve as a valid repre
sentation of Italy. It's an elementary
school project, a collage upon which every
student in the class is free to leave his or
her own contribution. The seemingly
random images blend together, build off
of each other and form a brilliant whole
everyone can be proud of. Why, then
doesn't everyone share this pride?
Black music is a good illustration.
Today's rap music appears to be following
the same pattern as yesterday's jazz

music — originally developed and enjoyed
by American blacks, the style has gradu
ally gained in popularity with mainstream
society to the point where it is now a
major, influential musical medium.
Also paralleling the jazz explosion is
the accompanying bitterness among
some blacks who feel their culture is
being exploited by whites.
Grumblings about the subtle racism
behind Vanilla Ice producing rap's first
number one album. Complaints about
Madonna reaping the benefits of the
voguing craze, a dance style developed in
New York clubs by gay blacks. General
feelings of violation.
Doesn't that miss the point? Yes, there
is a strong black American culture, but it
exists within a greater American culture.
Like other contributions to the American
entertainment world, whether ethnic in
origin or not, music deserves to be
enjoyed and expanded upon by everyone
regardless of race.
To say that a performer shouldn't pro
duce in a certain style just because of skin
color is hauntingly racist. Should Ice-T,
whose group Body Count has a clear
heavy-metal influence, be derided by
whites because he borrows freely from a
music style developed by other whites? Of
course not — that would be pointless and
blatantly prejudicial. He gets the same
freedom to sound crappy and pick a dumb
"Ice" name as his pal Vanilla.

America shouldn't have to be accused of
committing cultural rape when main
stream society picks up on and expands an
ethnic idea. People seem to be losing sight
of the fact that we're all Americans, and
instead blindly subscribing to a racial pride
that is a dangerously negative knee-jerk
reaction towards any external influence.
White acceptance of and involvement
in rap shouldn't be seen as some sort of
defeat of black culture at white hands,
but rather as a triumph. If our nation is
more willing to embrace the works of
each of our members it* will only make us
stronger, less divided. How is it wrong for
all Americans to benefit from the collec
tive pool of innovation?
Acknowledge your race if you will, but
don't lose sight of the fact that we're all
Americans, and together we form a
greater, uniquely American identity
(that's still really hard to put a finger on).
If every child tears his artwork out of
the collage so that nobody else can enjoy
it, we're not going to be left with much to
hang on the classroom wall.
