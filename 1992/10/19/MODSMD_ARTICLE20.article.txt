Proposition 161 dangerous for the disabled, minorities

IN HIS OCT. 14 LETTER, Dr.
Gendzel claims that Proposition 161:
Physician Aid in Dying "is carefully
written." In fact, it is so loosely written,
so badly constructed, that its so-called
"safe guards" are virtually worthless.
Proposition 161 says that voluntary
euthanasia would be available only to
"mentally competent" patients, but it
fails to require a psychological evalua
tion to verify that the patient is compe
tent and not suicidal. Nor does it require
that the patient be counselled regarding
alternative treatments or options.
Proposition 161 says the patient must
make an "enduring request," but that
means only on more than one occasion,
with no time interval specified or
required.
It does not require that family mem
bers be notified of a patient's request for
euthanasia or of their death by euthana
sia. Nor does it require witnesses of the
actual death.

The only reporting required would be
a single annual listing by the "health
care" provider to the California Depart
ment of Health Services of the number
of euthanasias performed, the ages of
the patients, their type of illness and the
date of euthanasia. But they are not
required, indeed they are prohibited
from, identifying the patients by name.
Thus the doctors who perform the
euthanasias will be accountable to no
one. They will not have to report to fam
ily members, hospital ethics committees,
local medical societies, the States Board
of Medical Quality Assurance or anyone
else. The practice of euthanasia will be
unsupervised and unregulated. No doc
tor, no person, should be granted so
much power over the lives and deaths of
others without being made accountable.
Dr. Gendzel dismisses "fears of invol
untary euthanasia, or putting away
'undesirables'" as "utterly groundless."
But socially devalued groups have good

reason for concern about the impact of
this initiative. Old people, poor people,
gay people, members of racial minorities
and people with disabilities often fail to
get adequate medical treatment because
too many medical professionals place a
lesser value on their lives. That is why
groups such as the California Commis
sion on Aging, the Gay and Bisexual Liv
ing Network, the Mexican American
Political Association and the California
Association of Persons with handicaps
oppose 161.
Disability rights groups particularly
oppose 161 because its definition of "ter
minal condition" is so loose that many
persons with disabilities — myself
included — would be classified as "ter
minal" under it.
Proponents claim that doctors will
distinguish between terminally ill and
disabled persons. In fact, too many doc
tors already view disabilities as a
form of terminal illness.

I have been involved in three cases in
which physicians were willing to assist
the suicides of disabled persons and call
it merely the ending of treatment that
was "prolonging the process of dying."
Far from guaranteeing personal
autonomy, Proposition 161 will endan
ger members of devalued minorities and
will further augment the power of doc
tors without making them accountable
for how they use that power.
Given these serious flaws, it is no
wonder that many people who favor
physician aid in dying for terminally ill
patients oppose Proposition 161. Those
opposing 161 also include the California
Medical Association, the California
Nurses Association, the California Psy
chiatric Association, the Los Angeles
Times, the San Jose Mercury News, the
San Francisco Examiner And the Oak
land Tribune.
