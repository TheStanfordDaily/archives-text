# Stuart Thomas doesn't deserve affiliation with Stanford, ever
## 
### 
Like it or not, in the real world,
a Stanford degree acts as much
more than a certificate of academic
accomplishment. Rather, it is treat
ed as a credential â€” literally "that
which entitles one to confidence,
credit or authority."
A Stanford diploma is a state
ment of affiliation with the Uni
versity and the values and ideals
that it stands for. Recognizing
this, the University's concern
regarding the issuance of such a
credential to Stuart Thomas is

entirely appropriate.
I find it outrageous, in light of
his behavior, that Mr. Thomas will
eventually be allowed association
with Stanford University. More dis
turbing to me, however, is the posi
tion that the University has elected
to take with respect to disciplinary
action in his case.
The two-year delay is a brilliant
foil; it neither treats Thomas nor
mally nor effectively punishes
him.
My "higher self bleeds for both
Mr. Thomas and his victim. My
"lower self' still wants to shoot the
bastard in the head. It's comforting
to know that if I ever give in to that
basic instinct, I can still expect my
diploma.
