# Students get involved in political campaigns
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
As an eighth grader, Andrew
Byrnes rode his bike to the
offices of a local congressional
candidate one day and offered to
pitch in.
Seven years later, the Stanford
Democrats co-chair — who jok
ingly refers to himself as "a polit
ical hack from way back" — spent
the summer working for the
Democratic National Committee.
Freshman Noel Manalo
didn't get such an early start,
but he has also been caught up
in the excitement of campaign
work. Manalo volunteered last
summer for Republican Alan
Keyes, a Maryland candidate for
the U.S. Senate.
Both joined the ranks of stu
dents who are exchanging apa
thy for action by becoming
directly involved with the politi
cal process.
Byrnes, a junior, worked for
the Association of State Demo
cratic Chairs in Washington.
"We're liaisons between state
chairs, the Democratic National
Committee and the Clinton/Gore
campaign," he said.
His duties included making
arrangements for the party's
national convention. Surround
ed by senators and other Demo
cratic leaders and experiencing
the "excitement of being on the
national scene," Byrnes said he
realized why his party affilia
tion was so important.
"It's a confirmation about
the way you feel about politics,"
he explained. Listening to Mario
Cuomo and other speakers, he
recalled thinking, "Yes, this is

why I'm a Democrat."
The summer job wasn't his
first political position. The 1984
presidential primaries awak
ened his interest while he was in
the sixth grade, Byrnes said.
In high school, he worked for
a congressional campaign in his
district and later volunteered
for Michael Dukakis' presiden
tial effort.
"People are so amazed, espe
cially when you're so young,
that you want to get involved,"
he said. "There's a myth of inac
tive youth. We're not supposed
to be interested any more."
Now he's hoping to back a
winning Presidential candidate
for the first time. "I will finally
be vindicated after eight years,"
he said. "I think this is the year."
Manalo, a College Republi
cans officer, is also eager to see
his candidate win on Nov. 3.,
calling Keyes' campaign an
"uphill battle" in a largely
Democratic state.
Last summer was the first
time he had volunteered for a
candidate. "I could have been
considered one of the apathetic
teenage voters,"he said.
But when he saw his friends
"jumping on the Ross Perot
bandwagon," Manalo decided to
look for a way to participate on a
local level.
So Manalo began work on the
campaign, handing out informa
tion to his friends and other
young people. He was struck by
Keyes' ideas and intelligence, he
said, and is sorry to be so far
away now that the campaign is
heating up.
"I really felt like I was work
ing for change," he said.
