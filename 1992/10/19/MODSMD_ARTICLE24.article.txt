## Limping Cardinal squad sacked by U of A Wildcats 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
A speedy Arizona team shot the high
flying Cardinal out of the top 10 with a
smothering 21-6 victory Saturday at Stan
ford Stadium.
In a match-up of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's top two defenses, Arizona's was
more impressive, holding Stanford to just
143 total yards and two field goals.
The Wildcats' win left only two unbeat
en teams in the Pac-10 race, top-ranked
Washington and No. 13 Washington State.
The Cardinal, who saw their five-game
winning streak snapped, dropped to 5-2
overall, 2-1 in conference play and No. 16
in the latest Associ-

ated Press poll.
Stanford, in coach
Bill Walsh's words,
was "simply out
quicked" by Arizona,
especially by the
Wildcat defense.
They pounded Car
dinal quarterbacks,
getting around an
over-matched offen
sive line for eight
sacks and many
more solid hits just
as passes were re-

leased.
"Our offensive line couldn't handle Ari
zona's quickness," Walsh said. "Our
receivers couldn't get on track against
their tight, physical, man-to-man cover
age. And once we lost Stenstrom, we lost
our ability to audible."
One of those first-quarter sacks pro
duced the scariest five minutes of the
Stanford season, when Steve Stenstrom
lay motionless on the field after suffering a
crushing blow to the head. The injury
turned out to be no worse than a concus
sion. But Stenstrom was forced to miss the
remainder of the first half.
Backup Mark Butterfield, seeing his
first extended bit of action, struggled
under the heavy rush. He completed only
four of 11 passes for 43 yards.
Worse, he was stripped of the ball at the
Stanford one-yard line in a second quarter
play that set up Arizona's first touchdown
and turned the game in the Wildcat's favor
for good.
Saturday marked the third straight
dominating performance by the Arizona
defense. They previously held UCLA to
one field goal in a 23-3 win, and allowed
only eight points to No. 1 Miami, losing 8-
7. With the win, they improved to 3-2-1, 2-
1-1 in the Pac-10 and leapt into the nation
al rankings at No. 22.

ness.Our receivers couldn't

coverage.'

Cardinal coach Bill Walsh called the
game a "good old-fashioned beating," and
one would be hard-pressed for a better
description.
Arizona quite simply took Glyn Mil
burn out of the game. Kickoffs were pur
posely steered in Ethan Allen's direction
and Wildcat punter Josh Miller expertly
hung his kicks high enough so that Mil
burn was forced to call fair catches.
Further, Arizona allowed Stanford no
semblance of a running game. The Cardi
nal gained a net -33 yards. But even
excluding sack figures, they amassed just
37 yards on twenty carries.
Milburn, on six carries, accounted for a
paltry six yards. Not the stuff of which

Heisman candidacies
are made.
No one in the
Stanford locker room
was proffering excus
es, but the Cardinal
is clearly one banged
up football team.
Walsh said he was
limited in his use of
Milburn, due to the
tailback's shoulder
problems. After the
game, Milburn's shoul
der was found to be
separated.

Stenstrom is a walking bruise. After
coming back to start the second half, he
was forced to leave the game on two more
occasions after taking hits in the pocket.
And Saturday's game wasn't really an
exception to the punishment he's absorbed
all season.
Defensive starters Ron George (ham
string contusion) and Seyon Albert (turf
toe) are also hobbling, but that didn't pre
vent the Cardinal defense from turning in
a respectable performance.
Big plays made the difference for Ari
zona's offense. Senior quarterback George
Malauulu was a woeful three for 11 in the
air, but he masterfully orchestrated an
effective ground game and hit big passes
when he needed to.
The Wildcats, led by tailback Ontiwaun
Carter's 97 yards, ran the ball 58 times
and piled up 258 yards on the ground. Billy
Johnson and Charles Levy both broke big
touchdown runs up the middle.
Levy scampered 45 yards to give Ari
zona a 14-6 margin in the second quarter.
Johnson's 33-yard prance produced a com
manding 21-6, third quarter lead.
The Cardinal kept hope alive until late
in the fourth quarter. But after driving to
the Wildcat eight with just under five min
utes to play, Stanford failed on four tries
to pull within a touchdown.
