# Unlucky Stenstrom needs shield from opponents' abuse
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
The question of how much punishment quarterback Steve
Stenstrom can take before he caves in was finally answered on
Saturday. For weeks, teams have administered unusually large
doses of abuse to Stenstrom to no avail as he stayed just strong
enough to stay in and win.
Although he has been knocked out of a game once before this
year, Stenstrom had never left for more than a play or two until
the Arizona game. With 3 minutes and 5 seconds left in the first
quarter, however, he was forced to leave with a concussion.
Wildcat nose guard Rob Waldrop broke through the porous
pass protection and spun Stenstrom to the ground. As he went

down, his head collided with the driving knee of defensive end
Teddy Bruschi, causing the head injury.
To the dismay of the team and the crowd, Stenstrom lay still
for several minutes, prompting his father to join the medical
team along his side. After a stretcher was brought on to osten
sibly carry him off, he rose and waved it away, leaving the field
under his own power.
The crowd erupted at Stenstrom's resurrection, but this was
small consolation as he spent the rest of the half sitting on the
bench with a moist towel wrapped around his head. Backup
Mark Butterfield was thrust into the unfamiliar position of hav
ing to run the offense for a sustained period of time.

Steve Stenstrom suffers through one of Arizona's crushing tackles during the Cardinal's 21-6 loss to the Wildcats. Stan
ford dropped to the N0.16 spot in the AP poll.
Butterfield struggled, getting
sacked four times and making per
haps the most crucial mistake of the
game.
With 10 minutes left in the sec
ond quarter, Butterfield dropped
back to pass on a third down play on
the Stanford 13-yard line. When he
failed to step far enough into the
pocket, Bruschi knocked the ball
out of his throwing hand and recov
ered at the Cardinal 1-yard line, set
ting up an easy touchdown.
"I felt the pressure coming,"
Butterfield said. "I tried to step up
but I didn't step up enough."
In the second half, Stenstrom
trotted out of the locker room ahead
of the rest of the team. He entered
the stadium to a loud, chant of
"Steve! Steve!" as fans hoped he
could resurrect the offense.
The fact of the matter is that
Stenstrom performed little better
than Butterfield. Playing with a
buzzing head as well as the linger
ing effects of a chest contusion, he
completed just 13 of 26 passes for
133 yards while enduring his week
ly onslaught.
Like Butterfield, Stenstrom was
also sacked four times in addition to
numerous other hits. Both the
number of sacks and the physical
condition of our starting quarter
back point to the fact that the offen
sive line must improve for the Car
dinal to continue enjoying success.
Although Stenstrom played most
of the second half, he was replaced
by Butterfield for a play a couple of
times, prompting questions about
his ability to stay in the game.
