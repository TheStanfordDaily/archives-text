# Unlucky Stenstrom needs shield from opponents' abuse
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
The question of how much punishment quarterback Steve
Stenstrom can take before he caves in was finally answered on
Saturday. For weeks, teams have administered unusually large
doses of abuse to Stenstrom to no avail as he stayed just strong
enough to stay in and win.
Although he has been knocked out of a game once before this
year, Stenstrom had never left for more than a play or two until
the Arizona game. With 3 minutes and 5 seconds left in the first
quarter, however, he was forced to leave with a concussion.
Wildcat nose guard Rob Waldrop broke through the porous
pass protection and spun Stenstrom to the ground. As he went

down, his head collided with the driving knee of defensive end
Teddy Bruschi, causing the head injury.
To the dismay of the team and the crowd, Stenstrom lay still
for several minutes, prompting his father to join the medical
team along his side. After a stretcher was brought on to osten
sibly carry him off, he rose and waved it away, leaving the field
under his own power.
The crowd erupted at Stenstrom's resurrection, but this was
small consolation as he spent the rest of the half sitting on the
bench with a moist towel wrapped around his head. Backup
Mark Butterfield was thrust into the unfamiliar position of hav
ing to run the offense for a sustained period of time.
