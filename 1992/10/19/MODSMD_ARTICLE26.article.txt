# Tough-hitting Cardinal spikes UW, Wash State
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
Any coach will tell you a team is only as good as
its weakest link. In the case of the Stanford women's
volleyball team, there may not be one.
The second-ranked Cardinal rallied from a lacklus
ter performance against California earlier this week
to sweep the Washington schools last weekend at
Maples Pavilion. Stanford (14-1, 8-1 in Pacific 10
Conference play) downed No. 20 Washington State on
Friday 15-8, 10-15, 15-6, 15-5, then came back Satur
day to defeat No. 21 Washington 15-4, 15-9, 15-8.
The Cougars (13-5, 4-4 in Pac-10 play) came to
Maples occupying the fourth-place spot in the Pac
-10, led by junior middle blocker Carrie Gilley, 6-5
outside hitter Becky Howlett, and all-Pac-10 setter
Keri Killebrew. The Cougars were unable to get
started in the first game, however, as Stanford
jumped out to an early 9-3 lead and held on to take
the game 15-8.
In the second game, however, it was all Washing
ton State. The Cougars registered 21 kills to Stan
ford's 15, and outhit the Cardinal .395 to .189 to
take the game 15-10. Howlett was virtually unstop
pable up the middle in game two, and hit a blistering
.613 with 21 kills on the match.
Stanford roared back to life in games three and
four, taking the two games and the match 15-6, 15-5.
The Cardinal had an impressive 7-0 run midway
through the third game, and opened the fourth with
a 5-0 run to seal the victory. Stanford put together
fine hitting performances in both games, hitting .553
in game three and .429 in game four, while allowing
the Cougars only a .154 percentage in the last game.
Head coach Don Shaw admitted that his team
had its problems with its own execution and a tal
ented Cougar team.
"They served tough and ran a good offense," said
Shaw. "We really battled to come back in this match.
With games practically every other day, this is a hard
part of the season for us. We're not playing real well
right now, and until we get some rest and preparation
time, we'll keep fighting through these matches.
Yet Shaw was pleased not only with the play of
his team through the last two games, but also with
the productivity of his bench throughout the night.
"Wendy (Hromadka) and Maureen (McLaren)
came in and did a great job — they both got a lot of
swings," Shaw said. "They have a great attitude and
they gave us a lift."
Hromadka had a career night, hitting .412 with
nine kills and two digs over three games. Senior tri
captain Bev Oden came one kill short of her season
best with 22, while adding seven digs and a .475 hit
ting percentage for the match. Freshman hitter
Cary Wendell had 17 kills and a remarkable 16 digs
on the night, while senior Kristi Paaso poured in 11

kills and six digs for Stanford.
On Saturday, Stanford faced Washington (7-6, 4-
5 in Pac-10 play) and head coach Bill Neville's
unique swing offense. The swing offense employs
two main passers on the serve, freeing up four full
time hitters in the rotation, and is used by the U.S.
Olympic volleyball teams.
However, it was apparent Saturday that Stanford

had little problem handling the formation. Washing
ton struggled throughout the night, hitting only
.060 on the match, including a -.143 percentage in
the second game. Stanford, on the other hand, hit
.351 in the match, and put together 7-0 runs in each

of the three games to sweep the
Huskies out of Maples.
Oden again led Stanford with
14 kills, eight digs, and a .345 hit
ting average on the match. Paaso
put in another solid performance
for the Cardinal, hitting .435 with
12 kills and six digs, while Wen
dell added 11 kills and five digs on
the night.
"I'm real pleased with the overall
performance tonight," Shaw said.
"We adjusted to the jump serve well.
Our back row hitting was improved
— we can still use some work on
blocking, although even that went
well for most of the match. We
really had few problems."
Shaw was again impressed with
individual efforts from his starters

and the bench. "Kristi (Paaso) is
playing some great volleyball for
us, and Bev (Oden) is always a
solid player," said Shaw. "It's hard
to get everyone playing time, but
those we did get in were producing
— Wendy has been getting swings,
Marni (Triefenbach) and Mo
(Maureen McLaren) are doing a
great job. I'm pretty satisfied."
On Tuesday, Stanford will
have its No. 2 ranking put to the
test when it faces the fourth
ranked University of the Pacific
Tigers (14-2) at Maples Pavilion
at 7:30 p.m. The Cardinal defeat
ed Pacific on the road last year,
and the Tigers will now be looking
to repay the favor.
"We're going to be tested for
sure," said Shaw. "They'll usually
have two or three busloads of fans
come over and yell for them, so
we're hoping to have a good
crowd on our side."
