# Stanford golf in sixth place in Shoot Out
## 
### SooSang Park 
"Fun" may be the optimal word to describe the
play of the Stanford men's golf team this weekend.
The First-ever Stanford Shoot Out, held at our own
Stanford Golf Course, has employed a special format
in an effort to emphasize team play.
The most significant change has members of a
team playing each hole together. And the Cardinal
men's team has certainly taken a liking to this shift
in tourney rules.
"When we do something great out there, we're
jumping up and down, whooping it up. Everyone else
is probably just looking at us. We're having fun,"
said Stanford coach Wally Goodwin.
The new format has not suited all the schools as
nicely. If team members and their coach know each
other well and get along, then the tournament's
team-emphasis favors them, but if players are accus
tomed to attacking their game individually, the spe
cial format seems more of a hindrance than a help.
After two rounds Stanford currently stands in
sixth place with a team total of 565, shooting a 285
on Saturday and improving to 280 Sunday. Califor
nia, after executing two solid rounds this weekend,
has jumped to a comfortable first-place lead with a
team score of 548. Going into the final round, a
strong Texas A&M squad holds second place with
Virginia in third.
Once again the star of the squad has been Steve
Burdick. The sophomore sensation, who just two
weeks ago took first place in Seattle in a tournament
hosted by the Washington Huskies, has continued
his hot hitting here at home.
Burdick opened the Stanford tourney with a one
over-par 72, but rebounded strongly in the second
round, shooting a 68. He is currently locked in a
four-way tie for first place, in excellent position to
earn the second title of his collegiate career. The
other three golfers tied with Burdick at 140 are Cal's
Mark Watanabe, the Aggies' Brent Brown, and Cali
fornia State-Northndge's Brian I^amb.
The Shoot Out's third and final round tees off
todav at 8:30 a.m.
