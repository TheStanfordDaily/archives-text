### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer team con
tinues to tear up their conference as
they disposed of both the California
Golden Bears, 2-1, and the Fresno State
Bulldogs, 2-0, this weekend to extend
their winning streak to four games.
On California's home Astro Turf the
Cardinal fell behind early in the second
half, but compensated for it with two

quick scores within six minutes of each
other midway through the half to rally
the team to a 2-1 victory over the Gold
en Bears.
The first Stanford goal came off of
assists by forward Ricky Goad and
backfielder Robert Brophy, who fed
midfielder Jason Vanacour for the
score.
"The goal I got there was pretty
much made by the rest of the team,"
said Vanacour, the Cardinal's leading
scorer, who has seven goals and two
assists. "There were some great plays at
the top of the penalty box, and Rob Bro
phy hit me with a wide open pass. He
completely had the goalkeeper beat, and
all I had to do was tap it in."
After that, Vanacour turned right

around and stole the ball from a Golden
Bear backfielder and dished it off to for
ward Ryan Collins for another quick
goal to round out the scoring.
"We went down 1-0 because we were
not really into the game," said senior
goalkeeper and co-captain Kyle Krpata.
"But after they went and took the early
lead, we just said to ourselves 'Come on.
We've got to do it or our season's over.'
We got two back right away and held on
for the win."
Even with a victory, Stanford (10-4-
0, 4-1-0 in Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration action) was glad to leave the
California Astro Turf behind as they
returned home on Sunday to dismantle
Fresno State (7-5-1, 2-3-0 in conference
play) in front of the home crowd at Mal
oney Field.
In a very intense and physical match,
both teams were blanked in the first
half by two of the best goalkeepers in
the conference. The Cardinal's Krpata
is fourth in the MPSF with a 1.07 goals
against average and six shutouts, while
the Bulldog's David Kramer is ranked
second in the MPSF with a 0.73 GAA
and six shutouts as well.
Fresno State's Kramer was the first
to give in during the second half as Car
dinal forward Lance Killian headed a
pass from Brophy right through the
center of the goal for his second score of

the year. For Brophy it was his fourth
assist in as many games.
The Bulldogs never did mount much
of an attack as Stanford scored again on
a two-on-one fast break which resulted
in a Collins goal, his sixth on the sea
son. Midfielder Randy Mann initiated
the breakaway with a deep pass down
field to Goad who then passed it off to
Collins.
The defense then shut down the
Bulldogs completely by allowing them
only two shots on goal for the entire
game. Fresno State eventually fell vic
tim to Stanford's third whitewashing of
the season, 2-0.
"It was a great defensive effort on
the behalf of the entire team," Krpata
said. "I can't really take much credit for
it. The backfield is playing incredibly
right now, and I'm just there to clear
out the garbage and keep the goal
clean."
With all four of their remaining
games scheduled at home, the team def
initely has its sights set on the MPSF
finals and the NCAA Tournament.
"Our confidence is way up," Krpata
said. "It's good that it's coming now.
We had trouble at the beginning of the
year, and obviously this is a better time
to peak than a couple of weeks ago.
We've got a streak going now, and all we
have to do is keep on going."

ward Ryan Collins for another quick
goal to round out the scoring.
"We went down 1-0 because we were
not really into the game," said senior
goalkeeper and co-captain Kyle Krpata.
"But after they went and took the early
lead, we just said to ourselves 'Come on.
We've got to do it or our season's over.'
We got two back right away and held on
for the win."
Even with a victory, Stanford (10-4-
0, 4-1-0 in Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration action) was glad to leave the
California Astro Turf behind as they
returned home on Sunday to dismantle
Fresno State (7-5-1, 2-3-0 in conference
play) in front of the home crowd at Mal
oney Field.
In a very intense and physical match,
both teams were blanked in the first
half by two of the best goalkeepers in
the conference. The Cardinal's Krpata
is fourth in the MPSF with a 1.07 goals
against average and six shutouts, while
the Bulldog's David Kramer is ranked
second in the MPSF with a 0.73 GAA
and six shutouts as well.
Fresno State's Kramer was the first
to give in during the second half as Car
dinal forward Lance Killian headed a
pass from Brophy right through the
center of the goal for his second score of

the year. For Brophy it was his fourth
assist in as many games.
The Bulldogs never did mount much
of an attack as Stanford scored again on
a two-on-one fast break which resulted
in a Collins goal, his sixth on the sea
son. Midfielder Randy Mann initiated
the breakaway with a deep pass down
field to Goad who then passed it off to
Collins.
The defense then shut down the
Bulldogs completely by allowing them
only two shots on goal for the entire
game. Fresno State eventually fell vic
tim to Stanford's third whitewashing of
the season, 2-0.
"It was a great defensive effort on
the behalf of the entire team," Krpata
said. "I can't really take much credit for
it. The backfield is playing incredibly
right now, and I'm just there to clear
out the garbage and keep the goal
clean."
With all four of their remaining
games scheduled at home, the team def
initely has its sights set on the MPSF
finals and the NCAA Tournament.
"Our confidence is way up," Krpata
said. "It's good that it's coming now.
We had trouble at the beginning of the
year, and obviously this is a better time
to peak than a couple of weeks ago.
We've got a streak going now, and all we
have to do is keep on going."
