# Library-user surveys to gauge indirect costs
## 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
Beginning Monday, library users will
help determine the University's indirect
cost recovery rate by responding to 30-sec
ond surveys.
The surveys will be administered ran
domly at the door or service desk of most
campus libraries for the next year, accord
ing to Reed Brimhall, director of Govern
ment Cost and Rate Studies.
The study will determine who uses the
libraries and which services they use so the
University can gauge how much money to
recover as indirect costs.
The government reimburses universi
ties for the direct costs of conducting re
search, as well as for the indirect costs —
expenses like electricity and maintenance
that cannot be easily attributed to a partic
ular project — and for a portion of the ben
efits the University pays its researchers.
The University's indirect cost dispute
originated in 1990 when Paul Biddle, the
resident representative of the Office of
Naval Research, charged the University

with fraud and abuse in Stanford's indirect
cost practices over the last decade.
A key part of the controversy had to do
with the agreement on the method used to
gauge library charges.
Universities may either use the govern
ment's default method or conduct a "spe
cial study" to determine what rate to
charge the government.
Stanford has historically chosen to use a
special study, claiming the standard
method does not take into account the large
number of graduate students who assist in
research.
The University conducted its first li
brary study in 1965 and has conducted sev
eral more since.
This time, randomly selected days and
hours were chosen to make the study as ac
curate as possible, Brimhall said. The sur
veys will be administered in rotation from
library to library through next October.
Students can benefit from the survey be
cause the money recovered from indirect
costs will be reinvested in the University,
