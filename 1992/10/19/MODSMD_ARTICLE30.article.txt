# Cross Country shines
## 
### Rob Ross 
On Friday, the Stanford cross
country team competed in the
Arizona State Invitational, with
the men coming in second and the
women placing third.
Not unexpectedly, the men
were paced by Gaiy Stoltz and the
women by Louise Watson. Stoltz
placed third in the men's race
while Watson took the individual
title in the women's race. Overall,
head coach Vin Lananna found
the team's performance worthy
of a double superlative: "It was a
very, very good weekend for Stan
ford."
The men's field was not as
strong as the competition at the
Stanford Invitational two weeks
ago. The University of Arizona,
ranked second nationally, won
the race, followed by Stanford,
Houston and Central Arizona.
Arizona was the only squad
competing that was nationally
ranked except, surprisingly
enough, the No. 20 squad from
New Mexico, which placed last as
a team. The Cardinal, who lost to
Arizona by only 25 points,
increased their chances this
weekend of taking a spot in the
polls.
Stoltz finished the 8,000 meter
course in 23 minutes and 54 sec
onds, with the next four Cardinal
runners placing within 20 sec
onds of one another. Mike Reilly
placed seventh in 24:23 followed
by teammate Todd Lewis, who
took thirteenth in 24:40, edging
out Brian McCaffery who placed
14th in 24:40. Derek Bork fin
ished up the Stanford scorers,
placing 15th with a time of 24:42.
The men showed considerable
improvement against Arizona
this week. At the Stanford Invita
tional they only got one runner
mixed in with Arizona's top four.
On Friday they were able to get
two in, with all five of their top

runners within one minute of
their number one runner, Stoltz.
They meet the powerful Ari
zona team twice more: first at the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships, and then again at the
District 8 Meet, where the top
two finishing teams go to the
NCAA Championships.
The Cardinal women, ranked
18th in the nation last week,
should move up significantly,
Lananna speculated, after an
impressive showing in the desert.
The women's field was much
stronger than the men's, boasting
Arizona and Northern Arizona,
both ranked in the top three at
some point this year. Predictably,
the Stanford women placed third
behind these two powerhouses,
but fell by only 11 points to sec
ond-place Northern Arizona, 20
points behind winner Arizona.
Watson blazed by the field,
winning the 5,000 meter race in a
speedy 16:45. Much like the men,
the women also had their next
four runners bunched within a 20
second window. Bennie Dehlen
dorf placed 11th in 17:51, fol
lowed by senior captain Sarah
Truitt at 13th. Kay Luo took 17th
with Andy Garner finishing 21st.
The sign of a good, deep cross
country team is having its fifth
best runner finish within one
minute of its fastest runner. The
Cardinal women have their sec
ond through fifth runners in a
compact group. Now they have to
bring that whole group up closer
to Louise Watson's times, accord
ing to Lananna.
This coming Saturday the
cross-country team has a meet at
nearby Crystal Springs in the
Notre Dame Invitational, which
will serve as a tune-up for the Pac
-10 Championships. Pac-10's will
be held on the Stanford Golf
Course on Oct. 31, with the men's
race starting at 3 p.m. and the
women's race starting at 3:45 p.m.
