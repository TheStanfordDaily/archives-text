# Comparing techniques of coaches
## 
### Robert Gitin 
Like so many other teams at
Stanford, the men's and women's
soccer programs are highly suc
cessful.
The women's team, coached by
Berhane Anderberhan, is in the
thick of the national champi
onship hunt. Within a couple of
years, the men's team, coached by
Colin Lindores, might be, too.
They are both highly skilled
coaches who, in a short period of
time, have taken Stanford's soccer
teams to a level of national promi
nence. However, they used signifi
cantly different methods to arrive
at that level.
The women's team (11-1 and
ranked No. 2 in 1992) has blos
somed in Anderberhan's sixth
year as coach. Their record this
year is certainly no fluke. In the
previous three seasons, the
women's team has gone 43-9-4;
last year, the squad finished with
a No. 5 national ranking.
The men's team is on its way to
a third-straight winning season.
Not coincidentally, this is Lin
dores' third year as coach. Much

like Anderberhan, Lindores took
over a losing team and has turned
it into a winner.
Anderberhan and Lindores
each use the same basic coaching
philosophy, regardless of gender.
"The first thing you have to do
is look at the talents of the indi
viduals," said Lindores. "You have
to assess their technical ability,
their tactical understanding and
their mental resolve, whether
they are male or female, and then
work with the strengths and
weaknesses of the players."
Anderberhan also sees few dif
ferences. "I teach the sport of soc
cer, and it doesn't matter if the
players are men or women, black
or white," said the Cardinal
women's coach. "I see myself
more as a teacher than a coach.
It's more the teaching of the sport
that I'm interested in. There's
winning, there's losing, but as
long as my players learn, I'm
happy."
There is definitely a difference,
however, in the manner in which
the two motivate their players.
Lindores said he realizes that a
variety of tactics are necessary. "If

you are constantly shouting, you
become like a parent shouting at a
child; they turn you off after a
while. So you've got to learn the
technique of raising and lowering
your voice."
Freshman midfielder Greg
Martellotto said, "Sometimes
[Lindores] lets us talk and yell
among each other, staying out of
the way, and that can be very help
ful."
This is not to say that Lin
dores' presence is never felt by his
team.
"In sport, we are always trying
to increase the pace, but it's not
necessarily better," said Lindores.
"If you start going faster than
your technical ability, then the
game becomes very ragged. Some
times you almost have to bring a
team down."
Anderberhan wants his team
to play with enthusiasm, but also
tries to keep it within its limits.
"You can't motivate a team to
reach goals which aren't realistic.
Set your goals, and then see how
far you can get."
Unlike some other coaches who
worry about becoming too close to

their players, Anderberhan is a
person who his players can
approach both on and offthe field.
"I have no problem being
friends with them. At the same
time, I have no problems keeping
the coach/player roles straight,"
Anderberhan said. "The women
on my team come to me to talk,
but so did the men at USC."
In practices, the two different
coaching styles are clearly in play.
The men's team is allowed to
freely scrimmage, with the occa
sional yell of "Kick the damn ball,"
directed at one of the players by
Lindores, who, in a recent prac
tice, only halted play for an injury.
The women's scrimmage is
much more controlled, with
Anderberhan stopping play many
times in order to clearly explain to
the players what he had just seen.
Anderberhan is serious through
out the practice, while Lindores
seemed to conduct his with more
levity.
Despite these differences, there
was one clear similarity between
the two teams: the desire to win
and the intensity with which they
approach the game.

cantly different methods to arrive
at that level.
The women's team (11-1 and
ranked No. 2 in 1992) has blos
somed in Anderberhan's sixth
year as coach. Their record this
year is certainly no fluke. In the
previous three seasons, the
women's team has gone 43-9-4;
last year, the squad finished with
a No. 5 national ranking.
The men's team is on its way to
a third-straight winning season.
Not coincidentally, this is Lin
dores' third year as coach. Much

like Anderberhan, Lindores took
over a losing team and has turned
it into a winner.
Anderberhan and Lindores
each use the same basic coaching
philosophy, regardless of gender.
"The first thing you have to do
is look at the talents of the indi
viduals," said Lindores. "You have
to assess their technical ability,
their tactical understanding and
their mental resolve, whether
they are male or female, and then
work with the strengths and
weaknesses of the players."
Anderberhan also sees few dif
ferences. "I teach the sport of soc
cer, and it doesn't matter if the
players are men or women, black
or white," said the Cardinal
women's coach. "I see myself
more as a teacher than a coach.
It's more the teaching of the sport
that I'm interested in. There's
winning, there's losing, but as
long as my players learn, I'm
happy."
There is definitely a difference,
however, in the manner in which
the two motivate their players.
Lindores said he realizes that a
variety of tactics are necessary. "If

you are constantly shouting, you
become like a parent shouting at a
child; they turn you off after a
while. So you've got to learn the
technique of raising and lowering
your voice."
Freshman midfielder Greg
Martellotto said, "Sometimes
[Lindores] lets us talk and yell
among each other, staying out of
the way, and that can be very help
ful."
This is not to say that Lin
dores' presence is never felt by his
team.
"In sport, we are always trying
to increase the pace, but it's not
necessarily better," said Lindores.
"If you start going faster than
your technical ability, then the
game becomes very ragged. Some
times you almost have to bring a
team down."
Anderberhan wants his team
to play with enthusiasm, but also
tries to keep it within its limits.
"You can't motivate a team to
reach goals which aren't realistic.
Set your goals, and then see how
far you can get."
Unlike some other coaches who
worry about becoming too close to

their players, Anderberhan is a
person who his players can
approach both on and offthe field.
"I have no problem being
friends with them. At the same
time, I have no problems keeping
the coach/player roles straight,"
Anderberhan said. "The women
on my team come to me to talk,
but so did the men at USC."
In practices, the two different
coaching styles are clearly in play.
The men's team is allowed to
freely scrimmage, with the occa
sional yell of "Kick the damn ball,"
directed at one of the players by
Lindores, who, in a recent prac
tice, only halted play for an injury.
The women's scrimmage is
much more controlled, with
Anderberhan stopping play many
times in order to clearly explain to
the players what he had just seen.
Anderberhan is serious through
out the practice, while Lindores
seemed to conduct his with more
levity.
Despite these differences, there
was one clear similarity between
the two teams: the desire to win
and the intensity with which they
approach the game.
