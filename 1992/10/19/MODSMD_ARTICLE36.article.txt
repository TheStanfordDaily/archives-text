# $30M drive for Earth Sciences

The School of Earth Sciences is hoping a new $30
million fund-raising plan will boost its efforts to
study the environment, enhance its academic pro
grams and allow Geology Corner, damaged in the
1989 earthquake, to reopen.
The plan was approved this month by the Board
of Trustees.
Half of the money will go to increasing the
school's endowment, while $8 million will support
new and evolving programs. The funds will be raised
over three years.
According to Gary Ernst, dean of the School of
Earth Sciences, there is still a great deal that must
be learned about the environment before anything
can be done to really change it.
The key is for people from various departments to

come together, he said.
"The time is right," Ernst said. "We need to link
forces with everyone. The University could be a
more interconnected entity if we could work togeth
er on problems like this."
Of the new funds, $3.5 million will be spent on
enhancing the academic programs, particularly
Earth Systems and Global Change.
Earth Systems, in its second year as an under
graduate major, was established to enable further
study of the environment from political, social
and economic — as well as scientific — points of
view.
The remaining money will go toward renovating
Geology Corner, which was damaged during the
Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, and adding to the
school's unrestricted income by increasing Annual
Fund gifts.
