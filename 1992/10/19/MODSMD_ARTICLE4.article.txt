alumni of Zeta Psi, one of Stanford's seven
original fraternities, are trying to resurrect
the group's campus chapter after a five
year hiatus caused by a series of "behav

Tom Mulcahy, a Zeta Psi chapter leader
ship consultant, and Chris Daniels, a senior
at Purdue University, have spent the last
three weeks talking to potential members.
Four organizing events have attracted
between six and 20 upperclassmen each,
Mulcahy said. They hope to build a stable
membership of 30 to 50 men over the next
few years and eventually become a housed

fraternity.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson wall
make the final decision whether to grant
Zeta Psi official recognition, which is need

Stanford's Zeta Psi chapter left campus in
1987 as a result of what Director of the Row
Diana Conklin called "many years of antiso

In 1981, Zeta Psi lost their house on
campus after fraternity members threw a
Mills College student into a cement pond at
a party. Later that year, two Zete pledges
were found face down with their hands tied
