# A 						bid for resurrection
## Zeta Psi seeks approval, courts members 
### Jake Dorman 
National representatives and local
alumni of Zeta Psi, one of Stanford's seven
original fraternities, are trying to resurrect
the group's campus chapter after a five
year hiatus caused by a series of "behav
ioral problems" and a 1987 death.
Tom Mulcahy, a Zeta Psi chapter leader
ship consultant, and Chris Daniels, a senior
at Purdue University, have spent the last
three weeks talking to potential members.
Four organizing events have attracted
between six and 20 upperclassmen each,
Mulcahy said. They hope to build a stable
membership of 30 to 50 men over the next
few years and eventually become a housed

fraternity.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson wall
make the final decision whether to grant
Zeta Psi official recognition, which is need
ed in order for the group to meet on Uni
versity property.
Stanford's Zeta Psi chapter left campus in
1987 as a result of what Director of the Row
Diana Conklin called "many years of antiso
cial. violent, anti-intellectual behavior."
In 1981, Zeta Psi lost their house on
campus after fraternity members threw a
Mills College student into a cement pond at
a party. Later that year, two Zete pledges
were found face down with their hands tied
behind their backs in a horse pad
dock.
Zeta Psi regained University
recognition in 1984, but failed to
regain their house. A series of
behavioral problems culminated in
April 1987 when 20-year-old
junior Zete David Dunshee, stum
bled into Lake Lagunita and
drowned after drinking at a Zeta
Psi rush party on a houseboat.
However, Conklin emphasized
that the Greek system has made
some dramatic improvements in
the last few years.
"In all fairness, it's really not
fair to judge this group. This is a
new generation," she said. "I've
seen some real positive changes in
the last few years in the fraternity
system. I've seen a strengthening
and movement towards taking
their role in the University com
munity more seriously."
Despite an apparent decline in
interest in Stanford's Greek sys
tem, with both Theta Delta Chi and

the Betas losing their houses in the
past two years, observers believe
the Zetes have a good chance of
restarting an unhoused chapter.
"I think they will be successful
because they have strong support
from alumni," said Office of Stu
dent Affairs Program Coordinator
Heather Dunn, the University's
liaison to the Greek system.
"A group with good alums will
be much more viable over the long
term than one with just students."
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Rip Waters said he has been
impressed with Zeta Psi's success
so far. "I was very pleased with
what they ended up with. They
have very strong leadership and
they've built a core of guys out of a
rush we thought we'd already sat
urated last spring," he said.
"They must have something to
offer that [the interested studentsl
couldn't find [at] other places in
the Greek system."
According to Mulcahy, Zeta Psi
is looking for people who have
inherent leadership qualities, are
good students and want a fulfilling
fraternity experience.
With 51 chapters at top schools

in the United States and Canada,
Zeta Psi sees itself as "small and
selective," he said.
Because the fraternity is start
ing fresh, new members will have a
chance to make an immediate
impact and hold leadership posi
tions, he said. However, restarting
a fraternity is a lot more work than
joining an established one.
"We feel like we'll be able to get
a big enough group interested to
fund," Daniels said. "If it didn't
happen it would be a real shame
seeing as we were one of the first
[fraternities] here. We're very con
fident we're going to be able to get
this group started."
The death in 1987 occurred at
the same time as the University was
re-evaluating its policy on alcohol
use, which has since had a sobering
effect on the Greek system.
"We're doing as much as we
can to make sure that the Greek
organizations not only survive,
but are successful and contribute
to the campus community," Dunn
said. "You hear all too often about
the negatives. It's sad because
there are a lot of positive things
going on."

Dean of Students Michael Jackson wall
make the final decision whether to grant
Zeta Psi official recognition, which is need
ed in order for the group to meet on Uni
versity property.
Stanford's Zeta Psi chapter left campus in
1987 as a result of what Director of the Row
Diana Conklin called "many years of antiso
cial. violent, anti-intellectual behavior."
In 1981, Zeta Psi lost their house on
campus after fraternity members threw a
Mills College student into a cement pond at
a party. Later that year, two Zete pledges
were found face down with their hands tied
behind their backs in a horse pad
dock.
Zeta Psi regained University
recognition in 1984, but failed to
regain their house. A series of
behavioral problems culminated in
April 1987 when 20-year-old
junior Zete David Dunshee, stum
bled into Lake Lagunita and
drowned after drinking at a Zeta
Psi rush party on a houseboat.
However, Conklin emphasized
that the Greek system has made
some dramatic improvements in
the last few years.
"In all fairness, it's really not
fair to judge this group. This is a
new generation," she said. "I've
seen some real positive changes in
the last few years in the fraternity
system. I've seen a strengthening
and movement towards taking
their role in the University com
munity more seriously."
Despite an apparent decline in
interest in Stanford's Greek sys
tem, with both Theta Delta Chi and

the Betas losing their houses in the
past two years, observers believe
the Zetes have a good chance of
restarting an unhoused chapter.
"I think they will be successful
because they have strong support
from alumni," said Office of Stu
dent Affairs Program Coordinator
Heather Dunn, the University's
liaison to the Greek system.
"A group with good alums will
be much more viable over the long
term than one with just students."
Interfraternity Council Presi
dent Rip Waters said he has been
impressed with Zeta Psi's success
so far. "I was very pleased with
what they ended up with. They
have very strong leadership and
they've built a core of guys out of a
rush we thought we'd already sat
urated last spring," he said.
"They must have something to
offer that [the interested studentsl
couldn't find [at] other places in
the Greek system."
According to Mulcahy, Zeta Psi
is looking for people who have
inherent leadership qualities, are
good students and want a fulfilling
fraternity experience.
With 51 chapters at top schools

in the United States and Canada,
Zeta Psi sees itself as "small and
selective," he said.
Because the fraternity is start
ing fresh, new members will have a
chance to make an immediate
impact and hold leadership posi
tions, he said. However, restarting
a fraternity is a lot more work than
joining an established one.
"We feel like we'll be able to get
a big enough group interested to
fund," Daniels said. "If it didn't
happen it would be a real shame
seeing as we were one of the first
[fraternities] here. We're very con
fident we're going to be able to get
this group started."
The death in 1987 occurred at
the same time as the University was
re-evaluating its policy on alcohol
use, which has since had a sobering
effect on the Greek system.
"We're doing as much as we
can to make sure that the Greek
organizations not only survive,
but are successful and contribute
to the campus community," Dunn
said. "You hear all too often about
the negatives. It's sad because
there are a lot of positive things
going on."
