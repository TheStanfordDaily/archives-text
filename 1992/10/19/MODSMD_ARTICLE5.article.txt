# 'Renewed social consciousness' fuels election fervor on campus
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
With just 15 days remaining
until Nov. 3, election enthusiasm
has reached a feverish pitch in

Stanford's political student
groups, as the College Republi
cans struggle to gain support and
the Stanford Democrats are rally
ing in hopes of victory.
And while the campus' partisan
organizations — including the one

rooting for Ross Perot — throw
themselves into the fray, many is
sues-oriented clubs are striving
for neutrality despite their liberal
leanings.
Perhaps the only thing all sides
agree on is the energizing effect of
the election.
"I think there is a renewed so
cial consciousness in people our
age," said Stanford Democrats co
chair Andrew Byrnes.
"Politics is just such a big part
of this year that it weasels its way
into every discussion," echoed Col
lege Republicans officer Sonia
Giordani. "It's on everyone's
mind. Everyone has an opinion."
More informational tables
should sprout up in White Plaza
during the next two weeks, accord
ing to leaders of various campus
groups. Other popular tactics stu
dent groups use to get their politi
cal message out include sponsor

ing dorm programs and speakers
as well as working directly for can
didates' campaigns.
While the presidential election is
usurping most of the attention,
many groups are also looking at
California's two Senate races, the
local Congressional contest and the
state's various ballot propositions.
Hoping for a tie
Fighting tough odds, members
of the College Republicans never
theless said they hope to convince
the campus President Bush is the
best choice.
Last week's Daily poll showed
Democratic presidential nominee
Bill Clinton with a 63-point lead
over Bush among students. But
Anthony Westerfield, vice chair of
the College Republicans, attrib
uted Clinton's large lead to anger
at Bush rather than support for
his opponent.

"It's more of a 'Bush, do some
thing,' " said Westerfield, a sopho
more. "They want to scare him so
his next four years will be better."
The group hopes to "tie Bill
Clinton 50-50" on campus by Elec
tion Day, he said. Debates with the
Stanford Democrats, an Oct. 31
rally in White Plaza, information
al tables, T-shirt sales and even a
picnic should help accomplish that
goal, he added.
Students have been "bombard
ed" by Clinton's advertisements
and campaign personnel from on
and off campus, according to
Westerfield.
Noel Manalo, assistant to the
vice chair, agreed that Bush still
has a chance to win. "Every elec
tion, polls come out and people
aren't really that sure," he said.
The excitement of the election

has been good for the College
Republicans. It's usually hard to
get people to participate, Wester
field said, but this year "freshmen
are seeking us out."
While last year's membership
was more than 150, he said he is
not yet sure how many people cur
rently belong to the organization.
According to Manalo, a fresh
man, Stanford in general has a
liberal reputation but the newer
students tend to be conservative.
"You have the Reagan youths
coming up," he explained. "We
need to provide a balance."
The College Republicans repre
sent a diverse set of views, West
erfield said. For example, he was
chair of Pro-Choice Republicans
last year until the two groups
merged.
But the club is also "100 per
cent behind Bush," he said. And
Giordani, also an assistant to the
vice chair, said the group is plan
ning an election night party — "a
victory party," she added with a
smile.
Coming around to Clinton
Students hankering for a taste
of victory on the other side are
jumping aboard the Stanford
Democrats' bandwagon as Elec
tion Day nears. According to co
chair Mike Zwibelman, last year's
loose membership of about 60 has
ballooned to 300 active partici
pants in the last few weeks.
"The sheer number of volun
teers shows the campus can . . .
come together for a common
cause," said Zwibelman, who was
worried by apathy he saw last
spring.
At that time, he added, "the
campus was skeptical of Bill Clin
ton." While he was "pretty sure
they would come around," Zwibel
man said the results of the Daily
poll has allowed club members to
relax a bit.
Besides debating the College
Republicans, the group plans to
sponsor a bike rally, sell T-shirts
and bumper stickers, and set up a
table in White Plaza every week
day until the election.
Each week, Zwibelman said,
the organization will pick an issue

to focus on in fliers. Education
and health care have already been
covered, and upcoming topics are
the economy, the environment,
women's issues and civil rights.
In the past, Byrnes said, the
Stanford Democrats haven't been
well organized. But now people
are excited by the prospect of a

volunteers shows
the campus can ...
come together for a
common cause.'

Democratic administration.
After years of "mumbling and
grumbling" and blaming the
White House for problems,
Byrnes said, students may have a
chance to do something about it
— an exciting, if somewhat scary,
prospect.
TV in White Plaza
The campus campaign for inde
pendent candidate Ross Perot
stalled this summer, but second
year graduate student lan Sobies
ki is doing his best to resuscitate
enthusiasm.
Sophomore Brian Kane said
almost 60 students were interest
ed in the Texas billionaire's run
for president last spring, and
more than 1,000 students signed
the petition to put him on the bal
lot.
"We really thought he was a
credible third option," Kane said.
"He promised a world-class cam
paign."
But when Perot dropped out of
the race in July, Kane changed his
mind.
"We worked for hours every
day. We slaved out there and he
let us down," he said. While he
approves of Perot's economic plan
and may still vote for him, Kane
said he won't actively support him
again.
But to Sobieski, no issue is
more important than the growing
national debt. So he's attempting
to reorganize Students for Perot.
"Realistically speaking, it's
more to get people aware and con

cerned about the debt," he said.
"Regardless of how his personali
ty may strike people . . . he's
spending $100 million of his own
money to run an education cam
paign."
Only seven people attended a
meeting last week, but Sobieski
still says he hopes to set up a table
in White Plaza to play Perot's
"infomercials" for people who
missed them.
His efforts are necessary,
Sobieski said, because people
don't seem to know why reducing
the deficit is important. "Neither
Bush or Clinton will seriously
confront it,"he said.
'Grunt' work?
Closer to home, some students
are taking advantage of a chance
to take part in grassroots politics
by working for Democrat Anna
Eshoo's Congressional campaign.
Britt Wahlin, a coordinator of
Stanford's National Women's
Political Caucus chapter, said the
candidate has spoken on campus,
visited with chapter members and
run a campaign that is "really
focused on students."
The group of about 20 students
also worked for Eshoo during the
primaries, just after the chapter's
formation last spring.

'We really thought he
was a credible third
option.... We
worked for hours
every day. We slaved
out there and he let
us down.'

on Ross Perot

"We like to say we helped her
win the Stanford precinct," said
Wahlin, a sophomore. Members
have been phone banking at the
campaign's local office as well, she
added.
Targeting independents and
pro-choice women, volunteers
read from a script and answer
voter questions. "It seems like
grunt work to some extent. . . but

name recognition is important,"
Wahlin said. "We're really trying
to touch each person."
The Stanford volunteers will
be walking the precincts the next
two Saturdays, knocking on doors
and distributing literature.
The Daily's poll last week —
which found nearly 60 percent of
students undecided in the 14th
District Congressional race —
"shows the need to continue the
campaign," she said.
Working for women candidates
has given Wahlin "a close connec
tion" with the election, she said.
"I feel like I have a stake."
Remaining non-partisan
Propositions and policy stands,
rather than specific candidates,
have catapulted some issue-ori
ented Stanford groups into the
middle of the election debate.
Educating student voters is the
goal for many student groups
including Children Now, Stu
dents for Environmental Action
at Stanford, Stanford Homeless
Action Coalition, the Pro-Choice
Alliance and Stanford in Govern
ment — all of which label them
selves non-partisan.
"Our purpose is to make chil
dren a higher priority," said

Roberta Gonzales, co-president of
the two-year-old Children Now.
The club's "Vote for Kids '92"
campaign will feature tables in
White Plaza and visits to dorm
meetings, she added.
While the core group of eight
organizers will endorse certain
propositions, she said, they want
voters to make their own choices.
SEAS coordinator Michael
Cohen echoed Gonzales, saying the
environmental group will "give
people as much information as
possible on environmental issues"
without taking a partisan stance.
By "just giving out the infor
mation on what Bush has done,"
Cohen said, SEAS can avoid
endorsing specific candidates. "I
really truly believe 1992 can be a
major turning point for the coun
try," he added.
SHAC's voter education drive
will include "an aggressive cam
paign" against California State
Prop. 167, according to director
Theo Emery. By closing tax loop
holes, he said, the welfare reform
initiative would cut services for
the poor.
The group plans to provide
advocacy training and informa
tion packets so members can
answer questions about a range of

propositions and candidates,
Emery said.
While SHAC won't endorse
candidates, he said, its newsletter
does detail Bush and Clinton's
positions on housing, job training
and related issues.
"Poverty is a fairly partisan
issue," he added.
Despite their affiliation with
the Stanford Democrats, Pro-
Choice Alliance organizer Shana
Yansen says the 35-member
group s focus is on distributing
information.
Voter guides, dorm programs
and possibly local speakers will
send a message in support of
reproductive freedom, Yansen
said.
But not every political group
has been mobilized by the loom
ing election.
While Stanford In Government
has invited a few speakers to cam
pus, chair Campbell Matthewson
said the non-partisan group's
educational efforts have been low
key.
But the organization is plan
ning "a lot of post-election stuff,"
he added. With the current elec
tion outlook, he said White House
officials should be "out of work"
and free to visit campus.
