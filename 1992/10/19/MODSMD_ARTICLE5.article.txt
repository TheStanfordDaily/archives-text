# 'Renewed social consciousness' fuels election fervor on campus
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
With just 15 days remaining
until Nov. 3, election enthusiasm
has reached a feverish pitch in

Stanford's political student
groups, as the College Republi
cans struggle to gain support and
the Stanford Democrats are rally
ing in hopes of victory.
And while the campus' partisan
organizations — including the one

rooting for Ross Perot — throw
themselves into the fray, many is
sues-oriented clubs are striving
for neutrality despite their liberal
leanings.
Perhaps the only thing all sides
agree on is the energizing effect of
the election.
"I think there is a renewed so
cial consciousness in people our
age," said Stanford Democrats co
chair Andrew Byrnes.
"Politics is just such a big part
of this year that it weasels its way
into every discussion," echoed Col
lege Republicans officer Sonia
Giordani. "It's on everyone's
mind. Everyone has an opinion."
More informational tables
should sprout up in White Plaza
during the next two weeks, accord
ing to leaders of various campus
groups. Other popular tactics stu
dent groups use to get their politi
cal message out include sponsor

ing dorm programs and speakers
as well as working directly for can
didates' campaigns.
While the presidential election is
usurping most of the attention,
many groups are also looking at
California's two Senate races, the
local Congressional contest and the
state's various ballot propositions.
Hoping for a tie
Fighting tough odds, members
of the College Republicans never
theless said they hope to convince
the campus President Bush is the
best choice.
Last week's Daily poll showed
Democratic presidential nominee
Bill Clinton with a 63-point lead
over Bush among students. But
Anthony Westerfield, vice chair of
the College Republicans, attrib
uted Clinton's large lead to anger
at Bush rather than support for
his opponent.

"It's more of a 'Bush, do some
thing,' " said Westerfield, a sopho
more. "They want to scare him so
his next four years will be better."
The group hopes to "tie Bill
Clinton 50-50" on campus by Elec
tion Day, he said. Debates with the
Stanford Democrats, an Oct. 31
rally in White Plaza, information
al tables, T-shirt sales and even a
picnic should help accomplish that
goal, he added.
Students have been "bombard
ed" by Clinton's advertisements
and campaign personnel from on
and off campus, according to
Westerfield.
Noel Manalo, assistant to the
vice chair, agreed that Bush still
has a chance to win. "Every elec
tion, polls come out and people
aren't really that sure," he said.
