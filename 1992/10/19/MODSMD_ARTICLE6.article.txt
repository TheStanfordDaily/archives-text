# 'Sorry, no endorsements' policy dictated to student political groups
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
University policy bars the
Stanford Democrats from en
dorsing Bill Clinton — or any
body, for that matter — for
president.
At least, that's Office of Stu
dent Affairs program coordinator
Heather Dunn's interpretation.
And the rule applies to the Col
lege Republicans, Students for
Perot and every other group that
might want to support a candi
date or proposition, she said.
"Individuals can do it, but
the Stanford Democrats as an

organization cannot," Dunn
said, adding that federal law
prohibits the University from
taking a partisan stance.
But Acting Registrar Jack
Farrell, whose office is respon
sible for interpreting the policy
which Dunn enforces, said that
it is the use of University re
sources to support candidates
— not endorsing them — that is
forbidden.
"I think Heather's being a
little too cautious," he said.
Asked about Farrell's alter
native reading, Dunn said that
while she would consult with the
Registrar if a question came up,
her understanding supports the
endorsement ban.
Student groups responded with
puzzlement to the rule on endorse
ments.
"It seems kind of ridiculous to
me to say we're not endorsing a
candidate, because we are," Stan
ford Democrats co-chair Mike
Zwibelman said.
But he said he had been made
aware that the group "can't have a
petition saying 'Yes, I endorse Bill
Clinton as my candidate'."
The College Republicans, on
the other hand, hadn't heard of
any such regulation. "There is no
University rule that I know of that
[states! you can't endorse a candi
date," Vice Chair Anthony Wester
field said.
Besides Bush, he said, the
group is supporting Senate candi
dates Bruce Herschensohn and
John Seymour as well as Congres
sional hopeful Tom Huening.
An endorsement from a Stan
ford organization can imply that
the University is also behind the
candidate or cause, Dunn said. So
unless the legislation is education
al in nature, the University risks
losing federal funding.
And the name of an organiza
tion alone can be an endorsement,
she said. "With Students for Perot,
for example, we can't regularly
supply them meeting space."
But Students for Perot orga
nizer lan Sobieski said he sched
ules meetings in the Tresidder
Union lounge and promotes his
candidate with a table from the
Office of Student Activities with
out a problem.
"I had no trouble getting a table
for White Plaza," he added. "It

strikes me as an absurd rule."
Farrell also disagreed with
Dunn's interpretation. "I don't
think it implies University support
... as long as there's no use of
University resources," he said.
Some student leaders are well
aware of the regulations. After an
interview with The Daily in which
he discussed a ballot proposition,
Stanford Homeless Action Coali
tion's Theo Emery called back to
make sure he hadn't used the
word "endorse."
Other rules governing partisan
activity prohibit the collection of
funds for candidates — including
selling T-shirts or buttons.
Zwibelman said the Office of
Student Activities had informed
him about the strict fund-raising
rules. "We can't sell any parapher
nalia for the Clinton/Gore cam
paign on campus," he said. "They
put the fear of God in us."
The Clinton/Gore campaign's
co-sponsorship of a bike rally
planned for next Sunday had to be
dropped, he said, because none of
the money collected can go to the
candidate.
This rule he agrees with. "Cam
paigns have a tendency to try to
come in and use Stanford as their
avenue to raise money," he said.
The regulation "helps keep the
pressure off" campus groups.
Money can be collected, howev
er, if it goes to the campus political
organizations rather than to spe
cific candidates.
And the rules don't prevent the
expression of personal views or
educational efforts, Dunn said.
The University regulations on
partisan political activities are
spelled out in a special election
year notice available at the Office
of Student Affairs.
While the notice says that the
University cannot endorse a candi
date or lobby for legislation, it does
not specifically forbid a student
group to do so.
