# Ev'ry little step
## Dance characterized by teamwork, bonding 
### Camille Dungy 
Thunderous chants and
stomps echo from the top level of
the parking structure behind
Roble field late Friday night.
Could it be some mysterious noc
turnal ritual? Maybe just some
more fraternity mischief?
Actually, it is frat-related, but
there's no mischief involved. The
rumbling is simply the African-
American fraternity Omega Psi Phi
practicing their step-dancing shows
in this remote area of campus.
Step-dancing is a form of ex
pression that combines clapping,
singing, moving and stomping feet
in a rhythm to make a beat visual.
"It is a coming together, a way
to express a beat in three ways —
and making it sound good," says
senior William Martin, a member
of Alpha Phi Alpha's step team.
Patrice Hayden, a sophomore
member of Alpha Kappa Alpha
sorority team says,"The closest
way to describe it is as a routine in
volving beats made with the hands
and feet."
Unique to the African-American
community, stepping is most often
performed by black fraternities and
sororities, although other organiza
tions also step, such as ROTC drill
teams at historically black colleges,
universities and high schools.

It "is something between a drill
team and a mixture of dance," ex
plains Stacey Dixon, senior mem
ber of Delta Sigma Theta sorority.
And while "the rhythm is very
important," she says,"the display
of teamwork is also key."
Jason Dicks of the Omegas
agrees. "If your arm is at a 45 de
gree angle, I everyone else's 1 arms
had better be at a 45 degree
angle," he says.
As both a form of entertain
ment and expression, stepping is
also an integral part of the
African-American tradition.
"Things like dance and celebra
tion in public formal display are
intensely part of the African and
African-American society," says
Dicks. "It is something the com
munity takes part in, a continua
tion of cultural specificity."
The Omega's version —- march
ing — originated in 1956 when
many of the fraternity brothers
returned from military service.
After they had grown accustomed
to marching in lines and in ca
dence, they incorporated that
style into their stepping.
For other organizations, mem
bers speculate that youths incor
porated the practice on school
campuses. "|lt must have beenl
