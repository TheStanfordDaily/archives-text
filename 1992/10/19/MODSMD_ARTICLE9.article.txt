# Ev'ry little step
## Dance characterized by teamwork, bonding 
### Camille Dungy 
Thunderous chants and
stomps echo from the top level of
the parking structure behind
Roble field late Friday night.
Could it be some mysterious noc
turnal ritual? Maybe just some
more fraternity mischief?
Actually, it is frat-related, but
there's no mischief involved. The
rumbling is simply the African-
American fraternity Omega Psi Phi
practicing their step-dancing shows
in this remote area of campus.
Step-dancing is a form of ex
pression that combines clapping,
singing, moving and stomping feet
in a rhythm to make a beat visual.
"It is a coming together, a way
to express a beat in three ways —
and making it sound good," says
senior William Martin, a member
of Alpha Phi Alpha's step team.
Patrice Hayden, a sophomore
member of Alpha Kappa Alpha
sorority team says,"The closest
way to describe it is as a routine in
volving beats made with the hands
and feet."
Unique to the African-American
community, stepping is most often
performed by black fraternities and
sororities, although other organiza
tions also step, such as ROTC drill
teams at historically black colleges,
universities and high schools.

It "is something between a drill
team and a mixture of dance," ex
plains Stacey Dixon, senior mem
ber of Delta Sigma Theta sorority.
And while "the rhythm is very
important," she says,"the display
of teamwork is also key."
Jason Dicks of the Omegas
agrees. "If your arm is at a 45 de
gree angle, I everyone else's 1 arms
had better be at a 45 degree
angle," he says.
As both a form of entertain
ment and expression, stepping is
also an integral part of the
African-American tradition.
"Things like dance and celebra
tion in public formal display are
intensely part of the African and
African-American society," says
Dicks. "It is something the com
munity takes part in, a continua
tion of cultural specificity."
The Omega's version —- march
ing — originated in 1956 when
many of the fraternity brothers
returned from military service.
After they had grown accustomed
to marching in lines and in ca
dence, they incorporated that
style into their stepping.
For other organizations, mem
bers speculate that youths incor
porated the practice on school
campuses. "|lt must have beenl

people standing around making
things up on the spot, working in
precision," Dixon says.
"It is sort of an expression of
joy," he explains. "Dance has
always been important to the
African-American. Going back to
the times of slavery and spirituals,
keeping a beat, keeping a rhythm,
has always been something that
keeps us going."
In addition to the physical
movements, the accompanying
chants relate facts or history about
the organization. "It tends to be
historical and informative about
the organization," Hayden says.
Each organization's methods
vary, sometimes dramatically,
making stepping difficult to pre
cisely identify. "Styles differ from
region to region, fraternity to fra
ternity, sorority to sorority"
depending on the talents of each
group's members, Martin says.
Sometimes it is even possible to
recognize where an organization is
from, based on their stepping

style, he added.
However, organizations also
swap material with each other.
"One way we bond is by
exchanging steps," says senior
Anthony Clark, the stepmaster for
APA. "When I meet brothers from
across the country I show them
things we do and they show me
some of their steps. You give some
thing to a brother and take some
thing with you."
While step teams often pay trib
ute to each other in their perfor
mances, they also incorporate a
friendly rivalry into their routines,
as each group chants loudly about
its own superiority at performances.
The organization of a step show
is a very time-consuming process.
Although each team is led by a
stepmaster — who is similar to a
choreographer — individual mem
bers of the step team are still close
ly involved in developing the show.
Beyond the signature steps of
each group, the performers typically
add new beats or movements that
they have developed themselves.
The most important aspect of the
show is that it accurately exhibits
the personalities and talents of the
team, say step team members.

Membership in a team is usual
ly open to all interested and willing
chapter members. But those who
choose to participate must have
the time to put into it. "There may
be some member of the sorority
who would love to step, but
because of academics they can't
practice," claims Hayden.
Team members are expected to
give at least a few hours a week,
and sometimes up to 15 or 20 dur
ing the week of an important show.
Because of the demanding time
commitment, most Stanford soror
ities only step two or three times a
year, while fraternities perform
between two to five shows a year.
Since public service is their main
focus, African-American fraterni
ties and sororities often hold parties
with step shows in order to raise
money for various community ser
vice organizations. Placing in a —
competition can bring an organiza
tion anywhere from $200 to $800.
The motivations for stepping,
however, extend beyond money
and tradition.
"Personally I step because I'm
very proud to be an Alpha," Martin
explains. "I worked hard to be an
Alpha and I'm proud to show it."
