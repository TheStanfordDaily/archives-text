With two weeks left until Elec
tion Day, a bipartisan handful of
Stanford's political experts say
Democratic nominee Bill Clinton
has a virtual lock on the White
House.

Richard Brody and Susan Okin
and Communication Prof. Steven
Chaffee agreed the Arkansas gov
ernor has almost run away with
the presidential race.
Though last night's debate was
hailed by some political pundits as
President Bush's last chance to
make an aggressive attack and
stymie his challenger's huge lead
in the polls, the Stanford experts
said anything the incumbent did
was too little, too late.
"Never in the history of debates
was there a knockout punch," said
Chaffee. "And never has the last
debate made any kind of blip in the
polls that I can remember."
Bush's tactic of repeatedly at
tacking Clinton's record as gover
nor of Arkansas did not seem wise
to Okin. "I think bringing this up

over and over again was kind of
ridiculous because Arkansas is a
poor state and has always been a
poor state. . . . The issue is what
has been done relative to where
Arkansas was," she said.
Okin predicted the debate will
eventually harm rather than help
the Bush campaign, especially
after Ross Perot raised questions
about both the President's in

volvement in the Iran-Contra
scandal and his handling of Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein before the
Desert Storm invasion.
"The (publicity) these issues
have been getting has been rising
over the last couple of weeks," Okin
said. "That could really hurt Bush."
An instant poll conducted by
ABC News last night backs up the
Stanford experts' assessment.

The survey of 710 registered
voters determined that, despite
Bush's aggressive performance,
support for the President re
mained unchanged at 29 percent.
The same poll hailed Clinton as
the debate winner by 10 percent.
But Okin questioned the validity of
determining a debate winner at all.
"What strikes me as strange is
that voters don't seem to judge the

candidates as candidates (during
the debates). They seem to judge
them as debaters and scorers of
points... like its between two high
school debating teams," Okin said.
Chaffee agreed, saying there is a
difference between winning a debate
and winning an election. "I think
what you'll see from the voters is
