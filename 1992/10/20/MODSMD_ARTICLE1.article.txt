Stanford's political experts say
Democratic nominee Bill Clinton
has a virtual lock on the White
House.

Anderson, Political Science Profs.
Richard Brody and Susan Okin
and Communication Prof. Steven
Chaffee agreed the Arkansas gov
ernor has almost run away with
the presidential race.
Though last night's debate was
hailed by some political pundits as
President Bush's last chance to
make an aggressive attack and
stymie his challenger's huge lead
in the polls, the Stanford experts
said anything the incumbent did
was too little, too late.
"Never in the history of debates
was there a knockout punch," said
Chaffee. "And never has the last
debate made any kind of blip in the
polls that I can remember."
Bush's tactic of repeatedly at
tacking Clinton's record as gover
nor of Arkansas did not seem wise
to Okin. "I think bringing this up

over and over again was kind of
ridiculous because Arkansas is a
poor state and has always been a
poor state. . . . The issue is what
has been done relative to where
Arkansas was," she said.
Okin predicted the debate will
eventually harm rather than help
the Bush campaign, especially
after Ross Perot raised questions
about both the President's in

volvement in the Iran-Contra
scandal and his handling of Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein before the
Desert Storm invasion.
"The (publicity) these issues
have been getting has been rising
over the last couple of weeks," Okin
said. "That could really hurt Bush."
An instant poll conducted by
ABC News last night backs up the
Stanford experts' assessment.

The survey of 710 registered
voters determined that, despite
Bush's aggressive performance,
support for the President re
mained unchanged at 29 percent.
The same poll hailed Clinton as
the debate winner by 10 percent.
But Okin questioned the validity of
determining a debate winner at all.
"What strikes me as strange is
that voters don't seem to judge the

candidates as candidates (during
the debates). They seem to judge
them as debaters and scorers of
points... like its between two high
school debating teams," Okin said.
Chaffee agreed, saying there is a
difference between winning a debate
and winning an election. "I think
what you'll see from the voters is

very little change in the polls," he said.
Some members of the group thought
the candidates oversimplified their
messages in the third debate, repeating
key phrases and attack lines again and
again.
"I'm surprised there is not more of
an inclination to question and delve
into the specifics of some of these pro
grams given the high probability that
Clinton's going to win this election —
perhaps by a landslide," Annelise
Anderson said. "It gets vaguer and
vaguer as we go on."
But Chaffee dismissed the idea that
debates should be used to unearth new
information, saying they should remain
a forum for the candidates to repeat
their message for uncommitted voters.
But he did acknowledge that Clinton
was not as specific as he was in last
week's debate.
"He's the front runner and he
doesn't want to take a chance," Chaffee
said. "He was very careful during this
entire debate."
Despite the lack of specifics, Okin
spotlighted one change in Clinton's
answers in the last two weeks.
"Bill said 'I would' in the first debate
and now he's saying 'I will,' " she

noted.
"Clinton, I think, feels like he's
going to win. I think he's looking for a
mandate," explained Chaffee. "Using
that word (mandate) is very significant
— he wants what Ronald Reagan and
FDR got, and those are two of the most
successful presidents of our time."
Martin Anderson, a former domestic
policy adviser in the Reagan adminis
tration, attributed Bush's anemic
standing to his campaign's failure to
effectively communicate his agenda.
"Bush talks about his economic vision
for the country in the next four years.
Bush talks about his program as the
Agenda for America, and I ask you — how
many in this room have read it? Can you
tell me what is in (it)?" Anderson said.
And instead of communicating the
details of his policy plans, Bush has
been quick to launch attacks against his
opponents, Chaffee added.
"Bush, in the uncontrolled debate
format. . . does let go of these zingers,"
Chaffee said. "To call Arkansas the low
est of the low is not a smart thing."
But Martin Anderson didn't see
Bush's poor debate performance as the
root of his faltering re-election bid. "It's
because of a blazingly incompetent
campaign," he said.
Turning to other issues, Okin noted

with displeasure what she described as
offensive behavior toward women by
both Bush and Perot. "Today when they
(Bush and Perot) were asked about
women in their campaign, neither of
them had any good anwers," she said.
She also cited Bush's handling of a
question about his salary in the second
debate when he gestured out to his wife
"as if men earn and women spend,"
Okin said.
"Perot just didn't get the whole idea
of women," Chaffee said. "But I think
Bush understands well that for every
person you offend, you do the other
thing with someone else. Sometimes
they are calculated tactical moves."
Though Perot stands at a distant
third, the experts said he turned in a
solid performance, harshly attacking
both Clinton and Bush.
"I think Perot's theme has always
been the same. . . that government is not
working and he knows how to make it
work," said Brody. "I think he's stronger
on the first point than the second."
Brody compared Perot's populist
views to Maoism. "Mao said that what
the political elite [should do] is go out
and learn from the masses. . . . Perot
has the essence of the program down
pat. But it didn't work in China and it
wouldn't work in Washington."

person you offend, you do the other
thing with someone else. Sometimes
they are calculated tactical moves."
Though Perot stands at a distant
third, the experts said he turned in a
solid performance, harshly attacking
both Clinton and Bush.
"I think Perot's theme has always
been the same. . . that government is not
working and he knows how to make it
work," said Brody. "I think he's stronger
on the first point than the second."
Brody compared Perot's populist
views to Maoism. "Mao said that what
the political elite [should do] is go out
and learn from the masses. . . . Perot
has the essence of the program down
pat. But it didn't work in China and it
wouldn't work in Washington."
With two weeks left until Elec
tion Day, a bipartisan handful of
Stanford's political experts say
Democratic nominee Bill Clinton
has a virtual lock on the White
House.

Richard Brody and Susan Okin
and Communication Prof. Steven
Chaffee agreed the Arkansas gov
ernor has almost run away with
the presidential race.
Though last night's debate was
hailed by some political pundits as
President Bush's last chance to
make an aggressive attack and
stymie his challenger's huge lead
in the polls, the Stanford experts
said anything the incumbent did
was too little, too late.
"Never in the history of debates
was there a knockout punch," said
Chaffee. "And never has the last
debate made any kind of blip in the
polls that I can remember."
Bush's tactic of repeatedly at
tacking Clinton's record as gover
nor of Arkansas did not seem wise
to Okin. "I think bringing this up

over and over again was kind of
ridiculous because Arkansas is a
poor state and has always been a
poor state. . . . The issue is what
has been done relative to where
Arkansas was," she said.
Okin predicted the debate will
eventually harm rather than help
the Bush campaign, especially
after Ross Perot raised questions
about both the President's in

volvement in the Iran-Contra
scandal and his handling of Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein before the
Desert Storm invasion.
"The (publicity) these issues
have been getting has been rising
over the last couple of weeks," Okin
said. "That could really hurt Bush."
An instant poll conducted by
ABC News last night backs up the
Stanford experts' assessment.

The survey of 710 registered
voters determined that, despite
Bush's aggressive performance,
support for the President re
mained unchanged at 29 percent.
The same poll hailed Clinton as
the debate winner by 10 percent.
But Okin questioned the validity of
determining a debate winner at all.
"What strikes me as strange is
that voters don't seem to judge the

candidates as candidates (during
the debates). They seem to judge
them as debaters and scorers of
points... like its between two high
school debating teams," Okin said.
Chaffee agreed, saying there is a
difference between winning a debate
and winning an election. "I think
what you'll see from the voters is

very little change in the polls," he said.
Some members of the group thought
the candidates oversimplified their
messages in the third debate, repeating
key phrases and attack lines again and
again.
"I'm surprised there is not more of
an inclination to question and delve
into the specifics of some of these pro
grams given the high probability that
Clinton's going to win this election —
perhaps by a landslide," Annelise
Anderson said. "It gets vaguer and
vaguer as we go on."
But Chaffee dismissed the idea that
debates should be used to unearth new
information, saying they should remain
a forum for the candidates to repeat
their message for uncommitted voters.
But he did acknowledge that Clinton
was not as specific as he was in last
week's debate.
"He's the front runner and he
doesn't want to take a chance," Chaffee
said. "He was very careful during this
entire debate."
Despite the lack of specifics, Okin
spotlighted one change in Clinton's
answers in the last two weeks.
"Bill said 'I would' in the first debate
and now he's saying 'I will,' " she

noted.
"Clinton, I think, feels like he's
going to win. I think he's looking for a
mandate," explained Chaffee. "Using
that word (mandate) is very significant
— he wants what Ronald Reagan and
FDR got, and those are two of the most
successful presidents of our time."
Martin Anderson, a former domestic
policy adviser in the Reagan adminis
tration, attributed Bush's anemic
standing to his campaign's failure to
effectively communicate his agenda.
"Bush talks about his economic vision
for the country in the next four years.
Bush talks about his program as the
Agenda for America, and I ask you — how
many in this room have read it? Can you
tell me what is in (it)?" Anderson said.
And instead of communicating the
details of his policy plans, Bush has
been quick to launch attacks against his
opponents, Chaffee added.
"Bush, in the uncontrolled debate
format. . . does let go of these zingers,"
Chaffee said. "To call Arkansas the low
est of the low is not a smart thing."
But Martin Anderson didn't see
Bush's poor debate performance as the
root of his faltering re-election bid. "It's
because of a blazingly incompetent
campaign," he said.
Turning to other issues, Okin noted

with displeasure what she described as
offensive behavior toward women by
both Bush and Perot. "Today when they
(Bush and Perot) were asked about
women in their campaign, neither of
them had any good anwers," she said.
She also cited Bush's handling of a
question about his salary in the second
debate when he gestured out to his wife
"as if men earn and women spend,"
Okin said.
"Perot just didn't get the whole idea
of women," Chaffee said. "But I think
Bush understands well that for every
person you offend, you do the other
thing with someone else. Sometimes
they are calculated tactical moves."
Though Perot stands at a distant
third, the experts said he turned in a
solid performance, harshly attacking
both Clinton and Bush.
"I think Perot's theme has always
