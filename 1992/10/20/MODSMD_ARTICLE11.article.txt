# Excerpts of round table on '92 campaign

Okin: "It's sort of a given that you ask
'what would you do if you could' but the
thing about Perot is the way he talks. . .
his image of when he gets into power is
of arms linked and dancing down the
yellow brick road — he seems to thinks
he'll be able to get everyone to agree. . .
he seems to think of the White House as
some kind of bully pulpit and somehow
when he sits down to talk to all of them
they'll agree. .."
Annelise Anderson: "That's not true —
he took a proposal for Texas
schools. . .took it to legislature, worked
with both sides and interest groups and
got it passed. . . . It's not fair to say he's
not experienced."
Annelise Anderson: "We have a phenome
na that we haven't had in a presidential
election in a long time: We have a candi
date who looks as if he's going to win by a
landslide and he is not an incumbent pres
ident. ... The press is saying this thing is
really all over — this was an exercise that
had to be gone through — now the real
question is: How is this man going to gov
ern? If you want to find out from him
what you really want to know, you'd ask
him, 'Who's going to be your secretary of
the treasury?' or 'What are you going to
do?' Tell me about the details."
Okin: "As far as Clinton's performance
was concerned, he wasn't as specific as
he was last time. In the middle debate,
the thing he did really well was come out
with really specific points about his pro
grams and list them very clearly and
come out with them in a way people
could hear listening to a debate. This
time he was much less specific. . . .
I was also surprised that he didn't
jump in and finish off some of that punch
on foreign policy stuff that Perot started
— I think it might have been that he has
just decided that he is not going to be tied
into negative campaigning."
Brody: "I think the prize fight
metaphor is . . . just wrong. . . . Each of
these candidates has a different goal
that they are trying to achieve, so it's
entirely conceivable that they all can
improve on that goal or at least not
make their situation worse.

The president has to keep nagging
away at the trust issue, it was raised as
thoroughly as it was raised in the vice
presidential debate. It is inconceivable
that you could say it any more times
than Dan Quayle raised it. . .
There's going to be a certain number
of undecided voters who will listen to that
and some of the things they picked up
during the primaries will begin to nag and
the President will push that some more."
Martin Anderson: "I think the problem
is, to use a baseball analogy from the
Braves and the Pirates, that it's the bot
tom of the ninth and there's two outs. . .
and the score's five to nothing and we
want a pinch hitter and a pitcher is up to
bat and there's nobody on base. The lat
est polls show Clinton up by 18 points.
That is landslide proportions. ... I think
the polls may even widen."
Okin: "I think the question that many of
us ask is that he's had this great pro
gram, but what has he been doing for
the last four years?"

ChafTee: "I think what you'll see from
the voters is very little change in the
polls. But when you ask the question,
'who won the debate,' then you think of
it as isolated ... but that's different
from how voters vote."
Brody: "One of the things focus groups
don't show is the relative weights of
those groups. As the campaign goes on
there are fewer and fewer uncommitted
voters . . . that's why the debates don't
have as much of an impact this late in
the campaign unless there's some kind
of big blockbuster. .
Annelise Anderson: "I'm not sure that
whoever won the debate is relevant. I
think they all did a reasonably good job in
expressing their views. I sense in this
debate, as opposed to the first ones, that
they are simplifying the message. ...
I think Clinton is backing off being
specific. Generally I found it a little
substantively disappointing. Maybe
that's what happens at this point (in
the election]."

Political Science Prof. Richard Brody and Hoover Fellow Martin Anderson dis
cuss last night's debate and the presidential campaign. Brody said he expects
the race to tighten while Anderson suggested that Bill Clinton's lead over Pres
ident Bush might grow.

whoever won the debate is relevant. I
think they all did a reasonably good job in
expressing their views. I sense in this
debate, as opposed to the first ones, that
they are simplifying the message. ...
I think Clinton is backing off being
specific. Generally I found it a little
substantively disappointing. Maybe
that's what happens at this point (in
the election]."

Political Science Prof. Richard Brody and Hoover Fellow Martin Anderson dis
cuss last night's debate and the presidential campaign. Brody said he expects
the race to tighten while Anderson suggested that Bill Clinton's lead over Pres
ident Bush might grow.
Okin: "It's sort of a given that you ask
'what would you do if you could' but the
thing about Perot is the way he talks. . .
his image of when he gets into power is
of arms linked and dancing down the
yellow brick road — he seems to thinks
he'll be able to get everyone to agree. . .
he seems to think of the White House as
some kind of bully pulpit and somehow
when he sits down to talk to all of them
they'll agree. .."
Annelise Anderson: "That's not true —
he took a proposal for Texas
schools. . .took it to legislature, worked
with both sides and interest groups and
got it passed. . . . It's not fair to say he's
not experienced."
Annelise Anderson: "We have a phenome
na that we haven't had in a presidential
election in a long time: We have a candi
date who looks as if he's going to win by a
landslide and he is not an incumbent pres
ident. ... The press is saying this thing is
really all over — this was an exercise that
had to be gone through — now the real
question is: How is this man going to gov
ern? If you want to find out from him
what you really want to know, you'd ask
him, 'Who's going to be your secretary of
the treasury?' or 'What are you going to
do?' Tell me about the details."
Okin: "As far as Clinton's performance
was concerned, he wasn't as specific as
he was last time. In the middle debate,
the thing he did really well was come out
with really specific points about his pro
grams and list them very clearly and
come out with them in a way people
could hear listening to a debate. This
time he was much less specific. . . .
I was also surprised that he didn't
jump in and finish off some of that punch
on foreign policy stuff that Perot started
— I think it might have been that he has
just decided that he is not going to be tied
into negative campaigning."
Brody: "I think the prize fight
metaphor is . . . just wrong. . . . Each of
these candidates has a different goal
that they are trying to achieve, so it's
entirely conceivable that they all can
improve on that goal or at least not
make their situation worse.

The president has to keep nagging
away at the trust issue, it was raised as
thoroughly as it was raised in the vice
presidential debate. It is inconceivable
that you could say it any more times
than Dan Quayle raised it. . .
There's going to be a certain number
of undecided voters who will listen to that
and some of the things they picked up
during the primaries will begin to nag and
the President will push that some more."
Martin Anderson: "I think the problem
is, to use a baseball analogy from the
Braves and the Pirates, that it's the bot
tom of the ninth and there's two outs. . .
and the score's five to nothing and we
want a pinch hitter and a pitcher is up to
bat and there's nobody on base. The lat
est polls show Clinton up by 18 points.
That is landslide proportions. ... I think
the polls may even widen."
Okin: "I think the question that many of
us ask is that he's had this great pro
gram, but what has he been doing for
the last four years?"

ChafTee: "I think what you'll see from
the voters is very little change in the
polls. But when you ask the question,
'who won the debate,' then you think of
it as isolated ... but that's different
from how voters vote."
Brody: "One of the things focus groups
don't show is the relative weights of
those groups. As the campaign goes on
there are fewer and fewer uncommitted
voters . . . that's why the debates don't
have as much of an impact this late in
the campaign unless there's some kind
of big blockbuster. .
Annelise Anderson: "I'm not sure that
whoever won the debate is relevant. I
think they all did a reasonably good job in
expressing their views. I sense in this
debate, as opposed to the first ones, that
they are simplifying the message. ...
I think Clinton is backing off being
specific. Generally I found it a little
substantively disappointing. Maybe
