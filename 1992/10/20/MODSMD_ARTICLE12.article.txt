Menchu to aid peace talks
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) - Nobel Peace lau
reate Rigoberta Menchu met yesterday with Pres
ident Jorge Serrano and said she will take a direct
role in stalled peace talks between Guatemala's
leftist rebels and the government.
The talks have been snagged since August over
human rights issues. About 120,000 Guatemalans
have died in the 32-year-old insurgency.
Menchu, awarded the Peace Prize on Friday for
her work for indigenous people's rights, accused
the world of complacency toward Guatemala's
human rights problems and civil war.
"On many occasions the international commu
nity tolerated Guatemala, remained silent
because of political agreements. They were
unwilling to put an end to the conflict in which we
are living," she said.
Chicago fights crime in slums
CHICAGO (AP) — Ground floors of all the
city's public housing high-rises will become high
security areas and four buildings will be sealed,
including one allegedly used by a sniper to kill a
boy last week, the mayor announced yesterday.
Families living on the first floors of all 160
public housing high-rises will be relocated and
metal detectors and turnstiles will be installed to
restrict access to the buildings, Mayor Richard
M. Daley said.
Four mostly unoccupied buildings at the
crime-plagued Cabrini-Green project will be
sealed. Fifty to 75 families will be relocated.
The boy was the third student from the local
elementary school killed this year.
"What we see here, unfortunately, is wanton
and total disregard for human life by gangs and
drug dealers," Daley said.
Math-hating Barbie censored
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A talking Barbie doll
criticized by a national women's group for saying
"math class is tough" will no longer utter the
offending lament, Mattel Inc. said yesterday.
The Teen Talk Barbie will remain in stores. But
the dolls will no longer complain about math class.
The American Association of University
Women blasted the math comment in a report on
how schools shortchange girls.
In a letter to Sharon Schuster, president of the
university women's association, Mattel President
Jill E. Barad said the company made a mistake.
"The phrase 'math class is tough,' while correct
for many students both male and female, should
not have been included. We didn't fully consider the
potentially negative implications of this phrase."
Some of the talking Barbie's other phrases
include "I'm studying to be a doctor" and "Let's
study for the quiz."
