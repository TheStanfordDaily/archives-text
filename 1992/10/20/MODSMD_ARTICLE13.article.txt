# Bush plays underdog aggressor in debate
## But no obvious gaffes nor shining success for any candidate; polls not likely to change 
### 
EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Last night's pres
idential sparring was the last in a series of debates
that endod in much the same way they began, with
Ark. Gov. Bill Clinton ahead in the race for the White
House, President Bush still searching for a break
through and businessman Ross Perot looking for a
miracle just 15 days before Election Day.
There were no obvious gaffes of the type that
could doom a campaign. Neither did any of the candi
dates dominate in a way that would suggest an
overnight turnaround in the polls.
The most recent surveys showed Clinton hovering
slightly below 50 percent in a three-way race, Bush
getting slightly more than a third of the vote, and
Perot lagging far behind.

Bush played the underdog aggressor during the
90-minute debate, predicting that Bill Clinton would
"sock it to the middle class" if elected president. Clin
ton pledged, pointblank: "I am not going to raise
taxes on the middle class to pay" for his initiatives.
At one point, Bush suggested Clinton's home state
of Arkansas is "the lowest of the low," drawing a
quick and passionate defense from the five-term
Democratic governor.
Bush rattled off a series of dismal statistics
designed to underscore his point that Arkansas ranks
at or near the bottom in several key economic cate
gories. Clinton countered with his own statistics to
prove that his record was enviable. "I wish that
America had that kind of record," he said.

Perot labeled the exchange irrelevant. He said just
because someone can run a "small grocery store on
the corner" doesn't mean he can run "Wal-Mart."
Bush charged that on issues as diverse as free
trade and the draft, Clinton had a pattern of "trying
to have it all ways."
Clinton said that Abraham Lincoln, too, had once
opposed a war and vowed that he could send Ameri
cans into battle if necessary to protect the nation's
interests. He pointed out that Woodrow Wilson and
Franklin Roosevelt had done so without having
served in uniform.
Bush had to fend off Perot's and Clinton's con
stant criticism of his economic stewardship. He
pointed out that many Americans better off than
they were four years ago, despite the recession. He
said the elderly were better oft because Republicans
had brought inflation under control.
"Is the guy who is out of work better off? Of
course he's not," said Bush. "But he's not going to be
better off if we grow the government."
Perot, and then Clinton, both criticized Bush for
his handling of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein before
the Iraqis invaded Kuwait. Bush replied that there
wasn't any "iota of evidence" that Iraqis had
acquired American weapons through pre-invasion
decisions to work with Saddam. The controversy, he
said, is from "a bunch of people who were wrong on
the war trying to cover their necks here."
Perot stressed his background as a non-politician
in pledging to work on economic problems. He said he
was spending $60 million of his own fortune on his
independent bid for the White House.
Each man stripped his appeal to its essentials in
brief closing remarks.
Clinton praised Perot for stressing the importance
of the deficit and paid tribute to Bush for his service to
the nation. "I wish him well," he said of the president,
but closed with "I just believe it's time for a change."
Bush said the election comes down to "who has
the judgment and the experience, and yes, the char
acter" to serve in the Oval Office. "I need your sup
port, I ask for your vote," he said.
Perot said he alone among the candidates had cre
ated jobs and managed money, and said that made
him the one for the economic recovery task at hand.
Perot proceeded to give the program schedule for a
series of his campaign ads to come.
By far, the sharpest exchanges came over the
economy and Bush's attempt to raise doubts about
Clinton's trustworthiness.
Mocking Bush's announcement that James A.
Baker 111 would take command of domestic policy ini
tiatives in a second Bush term, Clinton said that in
his administration, the person "responsible for eco
nomic policy will be Bill Clinton."
Bush broke in swiftly: "That's what worries me."
He criticized Clinton's record as governor of
Arkansas, and added, "We don't want to be the low
est of the low. We don't want to be a nation in decline.
We are a rising nation."

overnight turnaround in the polls.
The most recent surveys showed Clinton hovering
slightly below 50 percent in a three-way race, Bush
getting slightly more than a third of the vote, and
Perot lagging far behind.

Bush played the underdog aggressor during the
90-minute debate, predicting that Bill Clinton would
"sock it to the middle class" if elected president. Clin
ton pledged, pointblank: "I am not going to raise
taxes on the middle class to pay" for his initiatives.
At one point, Bush suggested Clinton's home state
of Arkansas is "the lowest of the low," drawing a
quick and passionate defense from the five-term
Democratic governor.
Bush rattled off a series of dismal statistics
designed to underscore his point that Arkansas ranks
at or near the bottom in several key economic cate
gories. Clinton countered with his own statistics to
prove that his record was enviable. "I wish that
America had that kind of record," he said.

Perot labeled the exchange irrelevant. He said just
because someone can run a "small grocery store on
the corner" doesn't mean he can run "Wal-Mart."
Bush charged that on issues as diverse as free
trade and the draft, Clinton had a pattern of "trying
to have it all ways."
Clinton said that Abraham Lincoln, too, had once
opposed a war and vowed that he could send Ameri
cans into battle if necessary to protect the nation's
interests. He pointed out that Woodrow Wilson and
Franklin Roosevelt had done so without having
served in uniform.
Bush had to fend off Perot's and Clinton's con
stant criticism of his economic stewardship. He
pointed out that many Americans better off than
they were four years ago, despite the recession. He
said the elderly were better oft because Republicans
had brought inflation under control.
"Is the guy who is out of work better off? Of
course he's not," said Bush. "But he's not going to be
better off if we grow the government."
Perot, and then Clinton, both criticized Bush for
his handling of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein before
the Iraqis invaded Kuwait. Bush replied that there
wasn't any "iota of evidence" that Iraqis had
acquired American weapons through pre-invasion
decisions to work with Saddam. The controversy, he
said, is from "a bunch of people who were wrong on
the war trying to cover their necks here."
Perot stressed his background as a non-politician
in pledging to work on economic problems. He said he
was spending $60 million of his own fortune on his
independent bid for the White House.
Each man stripped his appeal to its essentials in
brief closing remarks.
Clinton praised Perot for stressing the importance
of the deficit and paid tribute to Bush for his service to
the nation. "I wish him well," he said of the president,
but closed with "I just believe it's time for a change."
Bush said the election comes down to "who has
the judgment and the experience, and yes, the char
acter" to serve in the Oval Office. "I need your sup
port, I ask for your vote," he said.
Perot said he alone among the candidates had cre
ated jobs and managed money, and said that made
him the one for the economic recovery task at hand.
Perot proceeded to give the program schedule for a
series of his campaign ads to come.
By far, the sharpest exchanges came over the
economy and Bush's attempt to raise doubts about
Clinton's trustworthiness.
Mocking Bush's announcement that James A.
Baker 111 would take command of domestic policy ini
tiatives in a second Bush term, Clinton said that in
his administration, the person "responsible for eco
nomic policy will be Bill Clinton."
Bush broke in swiftly: "That's what worries me."
He criticized Clinton's record as governor of
Arkansas, and added, "We don't want to be the low
est of the low. We don't want to be a nation in decline.
We are a rising nation."
