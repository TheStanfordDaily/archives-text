## Editorial Avoid taking LSATs 
### 
A couple of years in
the work force will do
wonders for students

Hundreds of Stanford
seniors will devote part of
this fall to LSAT prep cours
es and law school applications â€”
many in the hopes of staying on the
Farm for three more years.
The law school would do well to
turn down most of these students
because it is better for almost
everyone involved that students
not go directly to law school from
college.
Why do college seniors go?
Many plan to become lawyers or
law professors, while others are
desperate to convert a liberal arts
education into something mar
ketable. Still others just can't
think of anything better to do and
are terrified of falling off the high
achievement fast track.
None of these reasons explains
why students should go to law
school directly from college. There
are, however, many compelling
reasons why they should not go.
First, most college students
have no idea what law school will
be like. Based primarily on read
ings of appellate cases, the study of
law has little to do with under
graduate study.
Exam grades reflect absorption
of material, not the ability to think
creatively about law. Students who
have fallen in love with learning in
college sometimes discover that
law school is closer to trade school
than academe.
Second, most students don't
understand what lawyers do.
Although many undergrads think
that becoming a lawyer is a good
way to be materially secure with
out going into business, they
ignore the fact that most lawyers
practice business law.
Contrary to the image projected
by "L.A. Law," few lawyers ever

see the inside of a courtroom; far
more hours are spent in libraries
or in front of computer terminals.
Third, the cost of a legal educa
tion is exorbitant. It is not unusu
al for students who pay their own
way to owe $75,000 after complet
ing three years.
Debts of this size make it unlike
ly that these newly minted lawyers
will pursue the public interest jobs
they might have dreamed of prior
to entering school.
Instead, they will most likely
opt to work for large firms which
may pay anywhere from $65,000
to $80,000 for first-year associ
ates, sacrificing personal happi
ness for job security.
Once you have the opportunity
to make a huge sum of money, it's
very difficult to evaluate what it is
you really want to do; the opportu
nity cost of self-knowledge
becomes exorbitant.
Taking time off before going to
professional school allows grads
the chance to explore their inter
ests. Stanford grads have many
options, but it takes time to discov
er what they are. The first year out
of college can be traumatic, but,
like freshman year in college, it
can dramatically affect our percep
tions of what we're capable of.
Leaving school allows people to
refine their interests and skills. Not
only do older law school students
have more to contribute, they tend
to be happier while in school. They
don't stake their self-esteem on
their academic performance. After
all, becoming a lawyer is only one of
many possible futures.
About a third of law students
come directly from college. Reduc
ing this number by a few percent
age points each year would not
hamper Stanford's ability to
attract the most academically elite.
Instead, it would make law school
a more pleasant experience for
those who enter it, while forming a
class of students who are more
committed to the practice of law.
Law is the right answer for
some. But there are a lot of other
things to discover when you're 22.
