## Non-sexism isn't an excuse 
### 
Last week i was talking with
a man about where blame belongs
in date rape. This discussion of gen
der issues had taken the predictable turn
to the defense of one's sex. Then he posed
a question that bothered me for the rest
of the week.
"Why should women regard me as
some oppressor type when I am not per
sonally sexist?"
Because he thought of himself as non
sexist,, he believed he should not have to
suffer any of the generalized anger
women feel toward a male-centered
world.
What could I say? His personal behav
ior, what I knew of it, didn't put him in the
sexist pig category. But the indifference of
his perspective to the struggles of other
people, mine included, frustrated me.
My basic feeling about the whole thing
was this: "If you are not part of the solu
tion, you are part of the problem."
But I think the most enlightening
aspect of his question lies in its assump
tions. What my argumentative friend did
was to equate a lack of negative action
(i.e. not actively practicing sexism) with
some kind of positive quality in his char
acter.
Of course the world would be a less
stressful place if all men could reach the
point of understanding sexism as a bad
thing.
But labelling oneself as "not sexist"

does not mean one is done thinking about
gender. As Naomi Wolf points out in a
recent article in Ms. magazine, there is
no "line in the sand called 'enlightened
male'."
It is easy for someone in a position of
power to acknowledge that there is a
power structure. It is quite another mat
ter to be willing to get up from that seat
of power, to share privilege with those
whom you say deserve it.
Taking a non-sexist attitude from the
ory to practice is a long and learning pro
cess. Once we reshape our own patterns
of thought, enacting these beliefs in a
world built on acts of inequality presents
an entirely new challenge.
Every day I have to force my mind and
body to focus beyond the street signs of
cultural pigeonholes — the nice girl, the
helpful female, the dumb blonde — that I
could fall back on when I cruise into
unfamiliar territory. I have even learned
how to change the oil in my car.
When you have made feminism the
road map for your life, you take the oil
stains along with the voice that lets you
tell people to stop hogging the road.
But if we are going to repave this
world with equality, it is not only women
who are going to have to change the way
they drive. I'm not expecting you to cre
ate some Men for Change for Women
group next week (Though why not?).
Start at a personal level by getting up

from that driver's seat of privilege and
walking next to women on their roadside
journeys, walking to a place where under
standing is not submerged under cen
turies of stereotypes.
Taking action means not interrupting
the next woman, or man, who speaks up
in section. It means knowing when not to
ask for a favor from a woman you know
will say yes even though you also know
she is incredibly busy.
It means recognizing that walking
through a dark parking lot is a fearful
experience for even the most assertive
woman — walk with her not as a protec
tor but as a supporter of her right to
walk.
And it means acknowledging that
while all people have the same rights, the
experiences of people of different genders
(or colors or preferences) have been, and
will remain, very different. Be useful to
them in the situations they face instead
of just getting out of their way.
I know you want to mean it when you
say you aren't sexist. So prove it.
