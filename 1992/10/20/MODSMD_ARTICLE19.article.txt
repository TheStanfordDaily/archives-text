Bush foreign policy: nothing to shout about

1N THIS ELECTION YEAR, George
Bush has attempted to portray him
self as a master of foreign affairs.
However, while it is true that Bush is
rich in foreign policy experience, he
appears sadly lacking in foreign policy
expertise.
As his record in regards to China
demonstrates, he is a president who
places his own political interests above
concerns for human rights and above
what he himself defines as the vital inter
ests of America itself.
Bush was one of the major architects of
America's recent pro-China policy. For
years, he has refused military support to
Taiwan in response to pressure from the
Chinese Communists. In their view, Taiwan
is a part of China occupied by a rebel force,
so any American assistance to Taiwan is
taken as direct support of a rebellion.
Consequently, Bush has refused to sell

Taiwan heavy weapons even in response
to the Tiananmen massacre. Further
more, he attempted to dilute Congress'
punitive sanctions in the wake of Tianan
men, and he rushed to restore "most
favored nation" status to China as soon
as the massacre faded from the headlines.
And through it all, despite pressure
from those who wished America would
take a stand against China's oppressive
policies, Bush emphasized the critical
importance of good relations with China.
Apparently, such paltry concerns as
human rights were not worth jeopardiz
ing relations with a great power, particu
larly one who could undermine the Unit
ed States' stand against nuclear prolifera
tion by selling other states nuclear tech
nology.
For placing what he perceives to be
national interests above morality, Bush is
perhaps not unusual among world lead-

ers, though he can hardly be termed
admirable.
But then, in an election year, Bush
reversed this policy — which he himself
had defined as vital — by authorizing the
sale of 170 F-16s to Taiwan, for the sim
ple reason that the plant producing the
planes is located in a key district in Texas
which Bush needs to carry.
This piece of pork-barrel policy runs
directly contrary to the pro-China policy
which Bush had worked for 12 years to
protect, and thus undermines what Bush
himself had defined as America's vital
interest.
Bush has placed his own political gain
not only above human rights concerns,
but above the national interest as well.
Lest any should doubt the repercussions
of this reversal, note that within a week
of the Bush announcement at the Texan
plant, the Chinese cut a deal to sell the

Iranians nuclear technology.
With his China policy reversal, Bush
has demonstrated a desperate lust for re
election which overrides any sense of
morality or regard for our nation's for
eign policy interests.
When one examines the rest of his
record, in particular his unbelievably
clumsy resolution of the Gulf War —
which left Saddam in power, his nuclear
program functioning and the Kurds and
Shi'ites slaughtered by the thousands —
it becomes hard to see just how George
Bush's experience has helped him.
One is forced to conclude that if for
eign policy is, in fact, Bush's strong
point, his overall record must be dismal
indeed.
