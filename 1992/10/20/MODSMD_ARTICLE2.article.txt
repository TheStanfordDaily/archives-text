## 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate is expected to ap
prove the appointment of senior Nneka
Rimmer as administrative manager at
its meeting tonight.
Rimmer has been chosen to replace
former Administrative Manager Enda
Hu, who resigned for personal reasons
Oct. 2.
The administrative manager is re
sponsible for overseeing ASSU projects,
especially service ones, and for taking
care of the ASSU office, said Senate
Chair Ron Brown.
An Administrative Manager Selec
tion Committee, created at the senate's
first meeting on Oct. 7, picked Rimmer
from a field of five applicants, according
to Senate Clerk and committee member

JefTßaird.
The selection committee also consist
ed of Brown, graduate senator Kevin
Murdock and undergraduate senator
Virginia Rosas.
Of the five applicants who responded
to advertising about the opening of the
position, two withdrew their applica
tions during the selection process and
declined interviews, Baird said.
He said Rimmer was chosen after an
interview of the remaining three candi
dates.
"Enda retired unexpectedly so we
kind of had to hurry the search," Baird
said.
If approved, Rimmer will immediate
ly take over duties from junior Steven
Craig, who has been acting administra
tive manager since Hu's resignation.
Rimmer's term will last for the entire

1992-93 school year.
The senate will also vote on and is ex
pected to reapprove amendments to the
Stanford Legislative and Judicial Charter.
The changes slightly alter the rights
of students charged with misconduct as
well as of witnesses and people who initi
ate complaints.
The changes are a toned-down ver
sion of attempts made last year by the
Committee of 15 to reduce the burden of
proof in misconduct cases.
The original changes were rejected by
the ASSU Administration and Rules
Committee last October, forcing them to
be rewritten.
The senate approved a similar ver
sion of the revisions last spring. They
will vote tonight on a slightly different
draft already accepted by the Faculty
Senate.
