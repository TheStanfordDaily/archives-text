# 24-hour study facility in Meyer offered once repairs are completed
## 
### 
We write in response to your editori
al, entitled "Wanted: study area," in the
Oct. 7 Daily. We wish to make three
points.
First, your listing of the hours of the
Meyer and Green Libraries is incorrect
in two important aspects. When the
reconstruction is completed in late Octo
ber, Meyer Library will be open on Sat
urday until 9 p.m.
Also, Green Library is open until
midnight Sunday through Thursday,
not just on weekdays. It is worth noting
here that during Dead Week, several
libraries are kept open past midnight to
serve the "midnight-oil-burners."

Second, while Green library closes
at midnight, that has, as you noted,
been the practice for many years; no
late night hours have been curtailed
and so none are available for rein
statement.
In fact, it was only through a major
change in the operation of the Meyer
and Green operations that we have been
able to retain the present late-night
hours in the face of the University's
budget reductions which have affected
all parts of the campus. You may recall
the discussion of the proposal to cut
Green's nighttime hours in your pages
last spring.
Third, and perhaps most interest
ing to your readers, the reconstruc
tion plans for Meyer Library included
provision for a 24-hour study room
which could seat abut 40. In the day
time this would be the reserve reading
room, which could be converted to a
self-contained study space when the

library closes.
We are pleased to announce that we
will operate this service for winter and
spring quarters of this year on an
experimental basis to determine if
there is indeed a demand for study
space after midnight and what size that

demand might be.
