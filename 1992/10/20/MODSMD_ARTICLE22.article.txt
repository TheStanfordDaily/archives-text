## Golfers Shoot Out seventh as home tourney concludes 
### SooSang Park Staff writer 
The Cardinal men's golf team tied
for seventh place yesterday in the con
clusion of the Stanford Shoot Out, a
tournament which employed a special
format that involved team members
playing together.
In an effort to promote collegiate
team play, men's coach Wally Goodwin
proposed this format to the NCAA,
and the Stanford Golf Course was cho
sen as the site of the experiment.
Twenty-four teams participated in the
tourney, and after three full rounds
the special format seems to have been
a success.
After consulting with coaches from
the other participating schools, coach
Goodwin concluded, "By the end of the
tournament, I think many more of the
coaches saw the value of this tourna
ment."
The coach also expressed much
appreciation for the tourney's effects
on himself and the Cardinal squad. "It
was very valuable for me because I got
to spend three days on the course with
my guys, which I hardly ever get to
do."
Overall, the players also gave the
special tournament format high
marks. "I thought it was fun. It was
great playing with my teammates and
rooting for them. I'd like to see it in a
few more tournaments. It's good for
college golf to show the team aspect,"
commented sophomore Steve Bur
dick.
Jerry Chang, also a sophomore,
added, "Guys I talked to from other
schools liked it a lot, too."

But Chang did not feel that every
thing this weekend was a plus.
"There's a lot more pressure on each
shot since you don't want to let your
teammates down."
The only apparent problem with the
tournament was the number of
schools participating. Normally a tour
nament has only 18 teams competing,
but, for the sake of the experimental
format, 24 teams were allowed. With
the additional teams on the course,
players had to wait at holes for the
preceding team to finish up, causing
overall play to slow down.
"There's a few too many teams out
there," Chang said.
Coach Goodwin concurred, "If we
have the Shoot Out again next year,
we'll have only 18 teams."
The Cardinal began with a shaky
first round, shooting a team score of
285 on their own par-71 course, but
the squad rebounded over the next two
days to finish with a total of 847 —
good enough to tie Indiana for seventh
place.
Virginia played three strong rounds
to win the Shoot Out with a final score
of 830, overtaking California, who led
going into yesterday's play. Texas
A&M took second place with a score of
833, and California, after playing two
solid rounds of golf, shot a surprising
ly poor 287 on Monday and wound up
third.
Stanford's final round play can best
be described as erratic. The squad
played the first several holes very well
and found themselves at a tidy four
under par, but didn't hold that for
long.
"On the third hole, a difficult par-3

with a 180-yard shot, we got 2
birdies," coach Goodwin said. "But on
the sixth hole we got a par and three
bogeys.
Chang added, "The 11th and 15th
holes really hurt us. They're the two
easiest holes on the backside, and we
played them poorly. But on sixteen we
got it back. We got 3 under."
Coach Goodwin called the scoring
"volatile" and said that inconsistent
play was to be expected from such a
young team.
The five players chosen by the
coach to play the Shoot Out this past
weekend were sophomores Burdick,
Chang, Darren Dragovich, freshman
Paul Hinkle and senior Dave
Rutkowski.
Although the team may have played
inconsistently, Burdick did not. The
sophomore continued his hot hitting
from two weeks ago, when he won the
Mass Mutual/Husky Classic in Seattle.
At home Burdick shot 72, 68 and 70
for a total score of 210, good for second
place in the tournament.
Duke's Mike Muehr edged Burdick
for the championship with a total
score of 209. Jason Widener, also of
Duke, came in third with 211.
Chang also had an excellent show
ing. After starting with rounds of 73
and 74, the sophomore finished strong
with a 69 and tied for 14th place out of
120 golfers competing in the tourney.
"It took me a few rounds to get it
going, but it's great when I do," Chang
said.
In all, the Stanford Shoot Out
showed that even though it is inexperi
enced, the Cardinal men's golf team is
not without talent.

overall play to slow down.
"There's a few too many teams out
there," Chang said.
Coach Goodwin concurred, "If we
have the Shoot Out again next year,
we'll have only 18 teams."
The Cardinal began with a shaky
first round, shooting a team score of
285 on their own par-71 course, but
the squad rebounded over the next two
days to finish with a total of 847 —
good enough to tie Indiana for seventh
place.
Virginia played three strong rounds
to win the Shoot Out with a final score
of 830, overtaking California, who led
going into yesterday's play. Texas
A&M took second place with a score of
833, and California, after playing two
solid rounds of golf, shot a surprising
ly poor 287 on Monday and wound up
third.
Stanford's final round play can best
be described as erratic. The squad
played the first several holes very well
and found themselves at a tidy four
under par, but didn't hold that for
long.
"On the third hole, a difficult par-3

with a 180-yard shot, we got 2
birdies," coach Goodwin said. "But on
the sixth hole we got a par and three
bogeys.
Chang added, "The 11th and 15th
holes really hurt us. They're the two
easiest holes on the backside, and we
played them poorly. But on sixteen we
got it back. We got 3 under."
Coach Goodwin called the scoring
"volatile" and said that inconsistent
play was to be expected from such a
young team.
The five players chosen by the
coach to play the Shoot Out this past
weekend were sophomores Burdick,
Chang, Darren Dragovich, freshman
Paul Hinkle and senior Dave
Rutkowski.
Although the team may have played
inconsistently, Burdick did not. The
sophomore continued his hot hitting
from two weeks ago, when he won the
Mass Mutual/Husky Classic in Seattle.
At home Burdick shot 72, 68 and 70
for a total score of 210, good for second
place in the tournament.
Duke's Mike Muehr edged Burdick
for the championship with a total
score of 209. Jason Widener, also of
Duke, came in third with 211.
Chang also had an excellent show
ing. After starting with rounds of 73
and 74, the sophomore finished strong
with a 69 and tied for 14th place out of
120 golfers competing in the tourney.
"It took me a few rounds to get it
going, but it's great when I do," Chang
said.
In all, the Stanford Shoot Out
showed that even though it is inexperi
enced, the Cardinal men's golf team is
not without talent.

Steve Burdick watches intently as a putt rolls toward the hole. Burdick, a sophomore, led a
young Cardinal men's golf team to a seventh-place finish in the Stanford Shoot Out last
weekend.
The Cardinal men's golf team tied
for seventh place yesterday in the con
clusion of the Stanford Shoot Out, a
tournament which employed a special
format that involved team members
playing together.
In an effort to promote collegiate
team play, men's coach Wally Goodwin
proposed this format to the NCAA,
and the Stanford Golf Course was cho
sen as the site of the experiment.
Twenty-four teams participated in the
tourney, and after three full rounds
the special format seems to have been
a success.
After consulting with coaches from
the other participating schools, coach
Goodwin concluded, "By the end of the
tournament, I think many more of the
coaches saw the value of this tourna
ment."
The coach also expressed much
appreciation for the tourney's effects
on himself and the Cardinal squad. "It
was very valuable for me because I got
to spend three days on the course with
my guys, which I hardly ever get to
do."
Overall, the players also gave the
special tournament format high
marks. "I thought it was fun. It was
great playing with my teammates and
rooting for them. I'd like to see it in a
few more tournaments. It's good for
college golf to show the team aspect,"
commented sophomore Steve Bur
dick.
Jerry Chang, also a sophomore,
added, "Guys I talked to from other
schools liked it a lot, too."

But Chang did not feel that every
thing this weekend was a plus.
"There's a lot more pressure on each
shot since you don't want to let your
teammates down."
The only apparent problem with the
tournament was the number of
schools participating. Normally a tour
nament has only 18 teams competing,
but, for the sake of the experimental
format, 24 teams were allowed. With
the additional teams on the course,
players had to wait at holes for the
preceding team to finish up, causing
overall play to slow down.
"There's a few too many teams out
there," Chang said.
