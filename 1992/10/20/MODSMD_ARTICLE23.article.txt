# Volleyball continues long homestand, takes on fourth-ranked Pacific tonight
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
After five matches in the past week, this is
a team that needs some rest.
Unfortunately, the second-ranked Stan
ford women's volleyball team, hot off wins
this week against Arizona, No. 16 Arizona
State, California, No. 20 Washington State,
and No. 21 Washington, will get no such
break. The Cardinal (14-1, 8-1 in Pacific 10
Conference play) hits the court again
tonight at 7:30 p.m. to face No. 4 Pacific.
The Tigers (14-2) bring a solid offense and
imposing front line to Maples Pavilion to
challenge the Cardinal, a team that has lost
only eight out of its last 53 games.
"Their fans always come out to support
them," said head coach Don Shaw. "They'll
usually have two or three busloads lof fans]
come over. . . so we're hoping to have a good
crowd."
Stanford handled the Tigers last year in
four games that each seemed to come down to
the wire, 15-9, 14-16, 16-14, 17-15. To beat
Pacific again this year, however, Stanford will
have to concentrate on its own game, specifi
cally the execution of its passing and hitting
offense.
"We have to take care of our own side of
the net," Shaw said. "Fundamentally, we're
having some breakdowns — some technical
things need working on. Our passing is not as

'Their fans always come out
to support them. They'll
usually have two or three
busloads [of fans] come
over.. .so we're hoping to
have a good crowd.'
— Don Shaw

good as it could be, especially on the serve and
set, and we need to work on blocking."
The Cardinal will hopefully get some help
from its senior hitters on Tuesday — Ail-
American tri-captain Bev Oden, academic All-
Pac-10 selection Jennifer Jackson, and All-
Pac-10 Honorable Mention nominee Kristi
Paaso. Oden leads the team with 207 kills,
averaging 4.2 per game, while hitting at a
.383 clip. Jackson is second on the team with
149 kills and 113 digs, and is hitting .239 on
the year. Paaso has added 118 kills this year
for the Cardinal with 111 digs and a .252 hit
ting percentage.
In addition to enjoying solid production
from its senior players, the Cardinal has ben
efitted this year from a strong contribution

from its freshman phenoms. Freshman
starter Cary Wendell leads the Cardinal in
digs this year with 134, and has registered
127 kills for a .291 hitting percentage. Fresh
man hitter Wendy Hromadka has come off
the bench in seven games this year to register
15 kills, including nine against Washington
State and three in one game against Wash
ington.
Freshmen Marni Triefenbach and Mau
reen McLaren both saw action last week
end, with Triefenbach hitting .429 against
Washington and .667 against Washington
State.
"It's hard to get everyone playing
time," Shaw said, "but I've been real
happy with the players we've had come off
the bench. They've been able to come in
and give us a lift, and that's what we need
from them."
The Cardinal will be counting on every bit
of help it can get tonight against the fourth
ranked team in the nation, but it will also be
looking for a little momentum going into the
second half of its conference season.
On Friday, Stanford will resume Pac-10
play at Oregon State and Oregon, and will
then travel south for a second showdown with
the top-ranked UCLA Bruins in what may be
a preview of this year's NCAA final.
Right now, however, a win against Pacific
is the only thing on the Cardinal's mind.
Then maybe they can get a little rest.
