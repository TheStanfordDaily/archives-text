# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
In team sports, victory and defeat are often
decided neither by those who lead a club in
important statistical categories, nor by the
squad's captain or even its "spiritual leader."
In fact, winning and losing usually come
down to the performance of one or two reli
able yet unspectacular contributors who are
taken for granted until they turn in an occa
sional subpar performance, when they are

unduly criticized.
Athletes of the Week sophomore Ryan
Collins and senior Kristi Paaso — mainstays
of Stanford's men's soccer and women's vol
leyball teams — are being recognized for
exactly these consistent performances.
Collins, a midfielder from Boca Raton,
Fla., capped off a four-win week for the Car
dinal by tallying one goal apiece in victories
over California and Fresno State last.week
end. In both instances, his scores provided
the margin of victory for Stanford, which
now stands at 10-4 (4-1 in Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation play) and harbors realistic
NCAA Championship hopes.
That Collins would put his team over the
top should come as no surprise to Stanford
observers. As the effective back end of a Car
dinal "one-two" punch with senior captain
and leading scorer Jason Vanacour, Collins
has put the ball into opponents' nets six
times and added two assists for a total of 14
points — an average of exactly one a game.

Paaso, a hitter who hails from nearby Los
Altos, Calif., is leaving her mark on the sec
ond-ranked Stanford squad in her fourth
and final season in a Cardinal uniform. In
crucial Pacific 10 Conference matches last
weekend against No. 20 Washington State
and No. 21 Washington, Paaso pitched in 23
kills and 12 digs as Stanford cruised to two
easy victories and extended its record to 14-
1 (8-1 in Pac-10 play).

An All-Pac-10 Honorable Mention nomi
nee in 1991, Paaso has put down 118 kills
thus far in 1992, good for a .252 hitting per
centage. Her 111 digs, the second-highest
defensive total for the Cardinal, have kept
an average of 2.4 rallies alive per game and
have led to a number of Stanford's trade
mark scoring streaks that consistently put
would-be spoilers away.
