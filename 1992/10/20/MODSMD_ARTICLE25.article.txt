# Ross as commish? Kevin: 'Maybe in '93'
## 
### 
As you sit back and enjoy
what has so far been a
dandy of a postseason, it's
easy to mistake exciting base
ball for The Game's prosperity.
The Blue Jays shake the
"chokers" label and give Cana
dians their first-ever reason to
cheer in the Fall Classic. The
unknown Brave rescues Ted
Turner and Jane Fonda from
their slumber and sends
Atlanta to its second straight
Series in heart-stopping fash
ion. A great October already.
Ex-Cardinal Ed Sprague
wallops a ninth-inning homer
to give the Blue Jays a come
from-behind win. The camera
men fall in love with his
Olympic gold medal-winning
wife as the Jays mock the Tom
ahawk Chop after the final out.
Series: 1-1. 6lt doesn't get any
better than this, no?
But a glance behind center
stage, sadly, finds the image
not so serene.
In truth, The Game is spiral
ing out of control. It has been
directionless for nearly half a
decade.
As recessionary pressures
have stagnated attendance and
sent television revenues plum
meting, baseball's oblivious
owners signed journeymen play
ers to multi-million dollar con
tracts and sent salaries skyrock
eting at rates that kept pace
with Latin American inflation.
And while it sounds like
some remote economics lec
ture, this financial stuff mat
ters. It's a good bet that,
because of it, there will be no
1993 baseball season.
Owners are threatening to
lock the players out for an
entire summer. It might be
their only alternative to going
bankrupt.
But even if their threats
prove idle, the book-balancing
side of the game will make its
presence felt like never before.
Any A's fans out there?
Hope you were watching ALCS
Game 6 closely; you won't rec
ognize the Green and Gold next
time they take the field. The
Athletics paid their players
more than $40 million last
year, and the man who writes
the checks ordered that cut by
at least one-fourth.
The A's have no less than 15
free agents. No more than four
will come back.
Rumor has it Madonna plays
a mean left field. I say they sign
her . .. then wait for Jose to
come groveling back to Oakland.
What used to be off-season
baseball decisions are swiftly

becoming hard-headed busi
ness decisions. Scouts take a
back seat to accountants.
Quite simply, The Game is
being passed from the fat pret
zel-munching, beer-guzzling
guy in Chicago who closes every
CBS Sports promotional stac
cato with a winded "I'm a big
fan," into the hands of bespec
tacled attornev-geeks named
Sandy and Leigh.

This is more than John Mad
den complaining about the lack
of cholesterol in pre-game
meals. Baseball's economic
doomsday is on the horizon.
There are plausible solutions â€”
only they are the kind of solu
tions the owners and players
will be hard-pressed to come to
agreement on.
Baseball needs a benevolent
dictator. Baseball needs, me
thinks, Ross Perot as commis
sioner.
We've agreed that the folksy,
all-eared Texan would make a
lousy president. But Ross (says
he) is the kind of guy who can
put an end to gridlock, and it is
gridlock that has sent The
Game into free fall.
The way I see it, the owners
are playing Mr. Bush to the play
ers' House and Senate. The own
ers and players need to arrive at
a plan that sets team salary caps
and allows for revenue sharing.
Right now, Ross, everyone is
still slow dancin'. I see a lot of
talk, but no action. I want you to
spring for 30 minutes of prime
time to explain this financial
garbage. Then have one of your
damn electronic town hall meet
ings and be done with it.
Get those skyrocketing,
deficit-inducing salaries under
control. Restore some credibili
ty in this national institution.
I)o it for your children and
grandchildren.
Be our servant, Ross. Give
'em hell. The fate of the '93 sea
son is riding with you.

Kevin Jeffery is evidence that
wannabe athletes seek refuge in
sports journalism. He hopes his
IM football team will someday
score a point.
