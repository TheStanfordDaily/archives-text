# Watson makes tracks in Yankee soil, leads revamped Cardinal cross country
## Junior transfer from Great Britain paces teammates to success 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Stanford athletics is blessed with having
stars in every sport; so many stars, in fact,
that it sometimes takes a few years for an
extremely talented athlete to be recognized as
such.
The Stanford community better look up
quickly or its newest women's cross-country
star, Louise Watson, will, along with so many
others, have already shot by.
Watson was born in England 20 years ago.
She started running at age 11 and was
inspired by her father, a marathon runner.
She would get up and run an early-morning
mile with him.
Finishing in about eight minutes, she
would encourage herself with the thought
that "Gosh, only four minutes faster and I'd
be doing a four minute mile." At that age she
was blissfully unaware of the amount of hard
work taking off those four minutes would
require.
She joined the local athletic club and was
soon one of the best runners in England in her
age group. By age 17 she was running inter
nationally for Great Britain Juniors in both
cross country and track.
At 18 she qualified to run for Great Britain
in the World Junior Cross Country Champi
onships.
Then she was off to Lafby University, in
Kent, England to study and run. By age 20 she
was a highly regarded up-and-coming runner
in Great Britain.
Then Watson decided to come here as a
junior transfer student. She said she wanted
to live 6,000 miles away from home to "spend
a year in a different country. . . and to experi
ence different people in a different environ
ment."
So Watson set out on a tremendous adven
ture this summer. She left home, where she
was comfortable and well entrenched, applied,
got in and set off for Stanford.
Watson had never seen Stanford before,

Finishing in about eight minutes, she[Watson]

that 'Gosh, only four minutes faster and I'd
be doing a four minute mile.' At that age she

work taking off those four minutes would
require.

and was familiar with the school only because
her coach knew Brooks Johnson, the Cardi
nal's former track and field coach.
Now, after only two months, Watson
describes her experience here as "the best
thing that has ever happened to me." She
bases this lofty praise on the amount of sup
port she has received, both from the athletic
staff and her teammates.
She is amazed by the care she has received
from the medical staff, and is doubly surprised
that "it doesn't cost anything."
In England cross country is much more
individualized. She has found the team
emphasis here in the U.S. to be a great boon:
"The group that I train with is fantastic. They
are very enthusiastic and very encouraging."
Academically, the Cardinal's newest cross
country star has found Stanford "different."
In the British university system one declares
one's major upon matriculation so "there's
none of this larking around with other sub
jects."
But overall, she said she is impressed and
challenged by Stanford's "larking." Still, like
most first-year students, she said she'll be
happy to finish with CIV and freshman
English. Unlike most first-year students,
though, she expects to graduate in two years.
Her goals for this cross country season

coincide very well with the goals of head coach
Vin Linanna. The first goal of both is to have
Watson leading the women's cross country
team to the NCAA Championships.
To do so, the Cardinal needs to place in the
top two in the District Eight regional meet, or
run strongly enough to merit one of the few
at-large bids.
The youth and inexperience of the women's
cross country team is where Watson can have
her biggest impact.
With her wealth of experience against top
ranked international competition, she has
much to impart to her less experienced team
mates.
Watson has what she feels is "the perfect
race strategy," consisting of running strong
and staying in control for most of the race,
only to break free in the end with a tremen
dous kick. She showed off this strategy at the
Stanford Invitational, with a second place fin
ish in a very strong field.
Watson's long-term goals for herself are
very lofty indeed. She plans on running at the
Farm in both cross country and track for the
next two years.
Then, after graduation, she said she hopes
to devote herself to making Great Britain's
Olympic team, probably in the 10,000-meter
race.

Louise Watson, seen here practicing on the Stanford Golf Course,
has made the transition from Lafby University in Kent, England,
very nicely and has given the Cardinal cross country program an
NCAA inuividual title hopeful.
