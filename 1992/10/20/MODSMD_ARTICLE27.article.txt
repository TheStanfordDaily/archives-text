# Cardinal overcomes referees, Gauchos to take match, 3-1
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Despite scoring a goal against them
selves and suffering through their
worst-refereed game of the year —
according to Cardinal coach Berhane
1 - the Stanford women's
soccer team easily beat UC-Santa Bar
bara 3-1.
In an all-around impressive team
performance punctuated by Julie
Foudy's hat trick, Andeberhan had but
one complaint — not with his players,
but with the referee. Foudy, Dena Dey
and Melinda Minstrell were all called
for blatant fouls and awarded yellow
cards.
"He was the worst referee I've seen,"
Andeberhan said. "He was completely
arbitrary and arrogant. He was not only
stupid but uncommunicative. He
wouldn't even explain the fouls to the
captain."
According to Andeberhan, there

wasn't any rhyme or reason to the
calls. The Cardinal coach said in only
one of the three instances where yellow
cards were issued, did a foul actually
take place, and it was a minor one at
that.
"There will always be a little fouling,
but both teams were clearly interested
in playing a clean game," said Andeber
han, who added that the referee wasn't
even biased, as he also made bad calls
against the Gauchos.
"Once in a while he got bored and
decided to call a foul," Andeberhan said.
"But then players on both teams would
be 20 yards offside and he would have no
idea."
But the Cardinal played through the
questionable calls and concentrated on
the task at hand.
"After stumbling through the Cal
game like a wounded animal, they really
showed a lot of guts and intensity," said
Andeberhan, who said he was especially
impressed with the play of Foudy, mid

fielder Carmel Murphy and goalkeeper
Lesley Garrard.
According to their coach, Murphy
and Foudy controlled midfield while
Garrard made several spectacular saves
to nail down the victory. In fact, the
defense played so well that the only goal
the Gauchos got, Stanford hod to give
them.
UCSB was credited with the first
goal, but, in actuality, a Cardinal full
back tapped the ball into the net. The
Stanford player was retreating and
knocked the ball back to Garrard, who
had broken from the goalline toward the
ball a split-second earlier.
However, the "oops-I-can't-believe
that-happened" miscue didn't daunt the
Cardinal.
"We weren't worried because we were
playing well early," Andeberhan said.
"It wasn't an easy game but we clearly
had the edge."
UCSB was clearly unable to stop
Foudy. The veteran midfielder had what

Andeberhan called "one of her best
games ever" while scoring three goals
against the Gauchos.
The first came on a 35-yard blast
halfway through the first period, four
minutes after the Cardinal's early
Christmas present to UCSB. The teams
remained tied until halftime.
The second half belonged to Foudy.
The senior All-American took an assist
from Andrea Johnson and slipped an
easy roller past the goalie and into the
corner of the net.
With three minutes left in the game,
Foudy iced the cake with an unassisted
shot in front of the goal. Foudy picked
up the ball near midfield and didn't
stop until she had placed the ball in the
net.
"She kept taking the defenders on
and they kept retreating," Andeberhan
said. "She sliced through the defense
without slowing down and must have
beaten eight or nine defenders until she
was one-on-one with the goalie."

The Cardinal helped secure the win
with stingy defense, which initially
forced the Gauchos to play the ball in
the middle of the field instead of the
sides, where they like to maneuver.
But Stanford stopped funneling
play to the middle when it became
apparent that the Cardinal outside
defenders were controlling action
along the sides.
The few times the Gaucho attackers
got close to the goal, Garrard stymied
their efforts.
Andeberhan singled one save as being
particularly spectacular: in the second
half, Garrard dove across the goal
mouth to snag a point-blank shot. The
save preserved what was then a 2-1 Car
dinal lead.
The victory lifts the second-ranked
Cardinal to 12-1 on the season.
Stanford hosts the final five games of
the regular season, with a contest
against St. Mary's beginning the homes
tand tomorrow afternoon.
