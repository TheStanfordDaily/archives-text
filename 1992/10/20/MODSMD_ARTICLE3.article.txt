An unknown vandal or vandals defaced
several pieces in the Rodin Sculpture Gar
den with green and silver paint over the
weekend.
Two of the sculptures — "The Gates of
Hell" and "Walking Man" — were sprayed
with streaks of silver paint. In addition, the
stone bases of several others "were spray
painted with the word 'hate' in green," said
Stanford Police Sgt. Del Bandy.
Bandy said the vandalism occurred be
tween 6:30 p.m. Friday and 8 a.m. Saturday,
when the damage was discovered and re
ported to the police. Bandy said the police
have not yet had a chance to launch an in
vestigation into the vandalism.
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, Stanford's expert
on Rodin sculptures, said the silver paint on
the statues should be cleaned off by this af
ternoon. The green paint was removed yes
terday afternoon.

Elsen said he had no idea why the vandal
ism occurred, and declined to comment on
how paint is removed from the statues, saying
he feared it might promote more vandalism.
"There was some green paint on it, and
we took it off," he said. "We don't want to
encourage it."
Bandy said this was not the first time
campus statues have been defaced, but
never before with the word "hate."
Elsen said the Rodin garden has been the
site of past vandalism, but did not know
when the most recent instance was. He said
he did not know the significance of the
"hate" message.
The cast bronze "Walking Man" sculp
ture depicts a headless, armless, naked
walking man. A stripe of silver paint was
sprayed across his belly, and another
splotch was painted on his left buttock.
A serpentine line of silver paint was
sprayed across the bottom third of the Gates
of Hell, the towering bronze centerpiece of
the garden.
