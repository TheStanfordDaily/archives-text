# Sports training: soft tissue, Zoomers, plyometrics
## 
### Richard Stolz 
Every week, thousands of
Stanford alumni, students and
fans vicariously ei\joy the excite
ment of Stanford athletics.
But there's a side to the com
petition that the average fan
would probably not ei\joy experi
encing, even vicariously: training.
The training techniques of
three different men's sports —
football, volleyball and water
polo — vary greatly in both con
tent and emphasis. The condi
tioning goals of each squad, how
ever, are similar.
Perhaps the most technical
training is employed in football.
Combining advanced chemistry
and sports medicine, the football
team's training staff pays a great
deal of attention to energy sys
tems. The most important of
these centers around the
molecule ATP, or adenosine
triphosphate, the body's primary
short-term energy source.
Short-term energy use is
more common in football than in
any other sport. A player will
expend a lot of energy in a 10-
second period, then be at rest for
a 30-second period before going
all-out once more.
Because of this, the training
staff seeks to strengthen the
body's ability to recover quickly
and consistently. They empha
size sprinting, stopping and
sprinting again.

But sometimes, even these
techniques fall short of adequate
game preparation. As senior
linebacker Dave Garnett explains,
"The only way to train for [foot
ball] is to go out there and play
with the pads on and with 21
other guys out there with you."
In addition to bolstering
short-term energy systems, Car
dinal football coaches also try to
protect their athletes from com
mon gridiron injuries. These
occur primarily in "soft tissue"
areas of the body, such as liga
ment and muscle. Further
endurance conditioning — pri
marily running and weightlift
ing, — protects against such
damage.
Endurance exercises are a
major part of training for the
water polo team. Specifically,
water polo conditioning includes
"eggbeating" — during which
athletes tread water while hold
ing gallon jugs over their heads
— and swimming with
"Zoomers," or cut-off fins.
Like football, water polo
requires a great deal of stop-and
go training — sprinting and
maneuvering — only in the
water. But other skills used in the
sport more closely resemble those
employed in basketball or soccer.
To develop stop-and-go abili
ty, most practices center on
swimming back and forth across
deGuerre Pool with varying
intensity. Coach Dante Detta

manti emphasizes the counterat
tack, polo's version of the basket
ball "fast break." This strategy
requires speed above all else.
In water polo, the most com
mon injuries take place in the rota
tor cuff, which aids movement in
the shoulder, said Dettamanti.
"Wear and tear" on the rotator
cuff comes from both swimming
and throwing. The only way to
avoid this problem is to lift weights
and strengthen the shoulder, as in
football conditioning.
In volleyball, training
emphasis is placed on jumping
and sprinting, rather than the
"stop and go" techniques of the
other two sports. For Stanford's
men's team, conditioning usual
ly includes three sets of eight
100-yard dashes and five sets of
eight 55-yard dashes at each
practice.
Plyometrics — jumping on
and off boxes, bounding and
jumping for distance and hopping
over cones for quickness — is also
an essential component of the
volleyball team's conditioning.
In many ways, however,
weight training in volleyball and
football training is similar; both
involve bench-pressing, curling
and Olympic lifting.
The most common volleyball
injuries occur in the abdomen,
lower back, knees and shoulders.
Cardinal spikers lift weights to
strengthen their bodies and to
avoid injuries.
