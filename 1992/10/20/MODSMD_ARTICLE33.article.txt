# Pressure's on â€” cuts threaten SLAC

While Congress cut only $5 million
from the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center's budget this year, some SLAC
staffers are worried that the huge alloca
tion approved for a supercollider in Texas
could mean harder times ahead.
SLAC's 1992-93 budget submitted to
President Bush was reduced earlier this
year from $143 million to $138 million,
according to Science Information Officer
Michael Riordan.
In a recent memo to SLAC employees,
Director Burton Richter said the budget
cut and inflation "will put severe pres
sure on the laboratory" this fiscal year.

But because more than 100 employees
have signed up for an early retirement
plan, Richter added, SLAC can "operate
through the fiscal year 1993 without hav
ing to consider further staff reductions."
Research staff member Pablo Saez said
this year's cut was normal because
"Congress won't give you 100 percent of
what you ask."
He said, however, that "in two or three
years, the project in Texas might drain
funds from other facilities like Berkeley
and Stanford."
In September, Bush approved an $8.2
billion superconducting supercollider pro
ject. The entire budget for research pro
grams overseen by the Department of

Energy totals $22 billion.
Riordan explained that the DOE, which
funds Stanford-operated SLAC, works
with a lump sum # for all of their national
research. "If research expands in one area,
then something else must be cut," he said.
SLAC will not hire new employees in
the place of those retiring unless it is cru
cial to the center's work, Riordan said. He
said he also expects the situation to
improve as spending shifts away from
non-weapons research.
SLAC has had some slower years in the
past, according to Saez. But this year,
because of their successful research with
Z-particles, the center "passed evaluation
and did really well."
