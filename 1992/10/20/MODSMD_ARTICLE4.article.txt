# MEChA, LGBCC foster new support group for Latino gays

### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Before he came out, sophomore Angel Fabian used
to hear rumors about himself within Stanford's Lati
no community.
"Last year there was whispering. 'Is he? Are they?' "
Fabian said of the questions concerning his homosexu
ality. "Now they know and they are adjusting."
On a campus where separate communities exist
for Latinos as well as for gay, lesbian and bisexual
students, a new subcommittee of MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group, is working to build a com
munity for students who are both gay and Latino.
The subcommittee hopes to establish a support
group for gay Latinos, to bring in speakers on topics

related to homosexuality, and to increase AIDS
awareness within the Latino community, said Fabi
an, a gay Chicano who heads the subcommittee.
This work is especially important because issues of
homosexuality have never before been addressed by the
Chicano/Latino community, he said, adding that
"awareness and maybe a little tolerance" within the
Chicano community are the goals of the subcommittee.
"It would be great if there was even a little mutual
understanding," said Fabian.
In the past, "there have been a couple of instances
where community members leave the community be
cause they come out," he said. "A lot of people were
basically ostracized. The community just turned
their back on them."
Now, gay Latino students have a place to turn with

in the community. Jim Hammel, a heterosexual sopho
more on the subcommittee, said more than 15 students
and some faculty have expressed interest in a support
group and other activities of the subcommittee.
A gay Latino group is a huge step forward, said Fabi
an. "The interesting thing is that for the Chicano/Lati
no community or the communities of color, it is a big
breakthrough for MEChA to want to fund this thing, to
provide services for the community as a whole."
But Eva Silva, a co-chair of MEChA, said the issue
was not a new one to MEChA and that it had been dis
cussed at many of the statewide conferences the offi
cers attended last year.
The purpose of the group is to discuss "issues that
are never discussed within our community," said
Silva. "We want to educate our community as well as

everyone else."
Despite the subcommittee's goals of awareness
and education, Fabian said the he does not expect in
stant acceptance. "What I expect from the communi
ty is maybe they'll come to some speaker or some
thing. But mostly I expect indifference."
The subcommittee is the second ethnically based
group of gay, lesbian and bisexual students to be
founded on campus. The first was Black and Queer at
Stanford.
In addition to being sponsored by MEChA, the
subcommittee is also supported by the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center, where its activities
fall under the category of "People of Color program-
ming," said Fabian.
Adviser to the LGBCC Troy
Gilbert said he was not surprised
by the founding of Latino gay
group. "It seems to reason that
the ethnic diversity will ultimately
affect all of the groups at Stanford
and the lesbian, gay and bisexual
group is no different," he said.
"The stereotype of a gay person
is a white person, and I think
that's not true," said Gilbert. "I
think sexual orientation cuts
across all ethnic lines. As soon as
people realize that gay, lesbian
and bisexual people are of all col
ors we'll be much better off."
Hammel said he first became
interested in the problems of gays
within communities of color while
doing a paper on the topic. "I came
across facts that I was amazed at,"
like the high suicide rate among
gays, lesbians and bisexuals with
in communities of color.
"Talking to Angel, I realized
it's not just something to read
about. It happens here," he said.
"I wanted to help Angel and other
gay Latinos."
AIDS awareness is a priority of
the group. "Posters are going to go
up in El Centro Chicano concern
ing AIDS awareness," said Fabian.
In addition, Hammel said the
group would provide support for
Latinos who want to come out. "I
hope that it would make gay Latino
students more comfortable coming
out ... and [make them] realize
that being both is OK," he said.
It is difficult to reconcile being
gay with being Latino, partly
because of the influence of the
church which forbids homosexual
ity, he said. The majority of Latino
community members are Catholic.
While some gay Latinos choose
to renounce their religion, others
find alternative methods of rec
onciling religious beliefs and
homosexuality, such as attending
gay churches.
Gilbert said the support of the
group would be likely to make gay
Latinos more willing to come out.
"Sexual orientation is per
ceived differently within different
cultures. A huge part of the com
ing out process is finding people
who are like you, and if that could
be done within your ethnicity or
religion, then that can be over
powering," Gilbert said.

and Bisexual Community Center, where its activities
fall under the category of "People of Color program-
ming," said Fabian.

Gilbert said he was not surprised
by the founding of Latino gay
group. "It seems to reason that
the ethnic diversity will ultimately
affect all of the groups at Stanford
and the lesbian, gay and bisexual
group is no different," he said.
"The stereotype of a gay person
is a white person, and I think
that's not true," said Gilbert. "I
think sexual orientation cuts
across all ethnic lines. As soon as
people realize that gay, lesbian
and bisexual people are of all col
ors we'll be much better off."
Hammel said he first became
interested in the problems of gays
within communities of color while
doing a paper on the topic. "I came
across facts that I was amazed at,"
like the high suicide rate among
gays, lesbians and bisexuals with
in communities of color.
"Talking to Angel, I realized
it's not just something to read
about. It happens here," he said.
"I wanted to help Angel and other
gay Latinos."
AIDS awareness is a priority of
the group. "Posters are going to go
up in El Centro Chicano concern
ing AIDS awareness," said Fabian.
In addition, Hammel said the
group would provide support for
Latinos who want to come out. "I
hope that it would make gay Latino
students more comfortable coming
out ... and [make them] realize
that being both is OK," he said.
It is difficult to reconcile being
gay with being Latino, partly
because of the influence of the
church which forbids homosexual
ity, he said. The majority of Latino
community members are Catholic.
While some gay Latinos choose
to renounce their religion, others
find alternative methods of rec
onciling religious beliefs and
homosexuality, such as attending
gay churches.
Gilbert said the support of the
group would be likely to make gay
Latinos more willing to come out.
"Sexual orientation is per
ceived differently within different
cultures. A huge part of the com
ing out process is finding people
who are like you, and if that could
be done within your ethnicity or
religion, then that can be over
powering," Gilbert said.
Before he came out, sophomore Angel Fabian used
to hear rumors about himself within Stanford's Lati
no community.
"Last year there was whispering. 'Is he? Are they?' "
Fabian said of the questions concerning his homosexu
ality. "Now they know and they are adjusting."
On a campus where separate communities exist
for Latinos as well as for gay, lesbian and bisexual
students, a new subcommittee of MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group, is working to build a com
munity for students who are both gay and Latino.
The subcommittee hopes to establish a support
group for gay Latinos, to bring in speakers on topics

related to homosexuality, and to increase AIDS
awareness within the Latino community, said Fabi
an, a gay Chicano who heads the subcommittee.
This work is especially important because issues of
homosexuality have never before been addressed by the
Chicano/Latino community, he said, adding that
"awareness and maybe a little tolerance" within the
Chicano community are the goals of the subcommittee.
"It would be great if there was even a little mutual
understanding," said Fabian.
In the past, "there have been a couple of instances
where community members leave the community be
cause they come out," he said. "A lot of people were
basically ostracized. The community just turned
their back on them."
Now, gay Latino students have a place to turn with

in the community. Jim Hammel, a heterosexual sopho
more on the subcommittee, said more than 15 students
and some faculty have expressed interest in a support
group and other activities of the subcommittee.
A gay Latino group is a huge step forward, said Fabi
an. "The interesting thing is that for the Chicano/Lati
no community or the communities of color, it is a big
breakthrough for MEChA to want to fund this thing, to
provide services for the community as a whole."
But Eva Silva, a co-chair of MEChA, said the issue
was not a new one to MEChA and that it had been dis
cussed at many of the statewide conferences the offi
cers attended last year.
The purpose of the group is to discuss "issues that
are never discussed within our community," said
Silva. "We want to educate our community as well as

everyone else."
Despite the subcommittee's goals of awareness
and education, Fabian said the he does not expect in
stant acceptance. "What I expect from the communi
ty is maybe they'll come to some speaker or some
thing. But mostly I expect indifference."
The subcommittee is the second ethnically based
group of gay, lesbian and bisexual students to be
founded on campus. The first was Black and Queer at
Stanford.
In addition to being sponsored by MEChA, the
subcommittee is also supported by the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center, where its activities
fall under the category of "People of Color program-
ming," said Fabian.
