Before he came out, sophomore Angel Fabian used
to hear rumors about himself within Stanford's Lati
no community.
"Last year there was whispering. 'Is he? Are they?' "
Fabian said of the questions concerning his homosexu
ality. "Now they know and they are adjusting."
On a campus where separate communities exist
for Latinos as well as for gay, lesbian and bisexual
students, a new subcommittee of MEChA, a Chi
cano/Latino student group, is working to build a com
munity for students who are both gay and Latino.
The subcommittee hopes to establish a support
group for gay Latinos, to bring in speakers on topics

related to homosexuality, and to increase AIDS
awareness within the Latino community, said Fabi
an, a gay Chicano who heads the subcommittee.
This work is especially important because issues of
homosexuality have never before been addressed by the
Chicano/Latino community, he said, adding that
"awareness and maybe a little tolerance" within the
Chicano community are the goals of the subcommittee.
"It would be great if there was even a little mutual
understanding," said Fabian.
In the past, "there have been a couple of instances
where community members leave the community be
cause they come out," he said. "A lot of people were
basically ostracized. The community just turned
their back on them."
Now, gay Latino students have a place to turn with

in the community. Jim Hammel, a heterosexual sopho
more on the subcommittee, said more than 15 students
and some faculty have expressed interest in a support
group and other activities of the subcommittee.
A gay Latino group is a huge step forward, said Fabi
an. "The interesting thing is that for the Chicano/Lati
no community or the communities of color, it is a big
breakthrough for MEChA to want to fund this thing, to
provide services for the community as a whole."
But Eva Silva, a co-chair of MEChA, said the issue
was not a new one to MEChA and that it had been dis
cussed at many of the statewide conferences the offi
cers attended last year.
The purpose of the group is to discuss "issues that
are never discussed within our community," said
Silva. "We want to educate our community as well as

everyone else."
Despite the subcommittee's goals of awareness
and education, Fabian said the he does not expect in
stant acceptance. "What I expect from the communi
ty is maybe they'll come to some speaker or some
thing. But mostly I expect indifference."
The subcommittee is the second ethnically based
group of gay, lesbian and bisexual students to be
founded on campus. The first was Black and Queer at
Stanford.
In addition to being sponsored by MEChA, the
subcommittee is also supported by the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center, where its activities
fall under the category of "People of Color program-
