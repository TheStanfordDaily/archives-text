# Grad women give new life to support network

Outnumbered by men and fac
ing unique concerns — from start
ing a family to finishing a disserta
tion — graduate women at Stan
ford are once again finding a place
to belong.
In the second year since its re
birth, the Graduate Women's Net
work has brought new life to a pre
viously quiet community, coordi
nator Winnie Poster said.
Initially founded about 10
years ago, the network "went into
dormancy" after its half-time co
ordinator position fell victim to
budget cuts in 1989, she said.
But Poster, a third-year stu
dent in sociology, worked with an
other woman to resurrect the net
work last fall.
Women make up only 30 percent
of the graduate student population,
according to group member Renee
Romano. In some departments, es
pecially those in areas like science
and engineering, the percentage
can fall as low as 10 or 15 percent.
Because many departments are
predominantly male, Poster said,
female students can feel left out of
the male camaraderie.
"Some members come to meet
ings simply because they want to
talk to another woman," she ex
plained.

Furthermore, graduate students
tend to "isolate themselves in their
departments" .because of the in
tense nature of their studies, Poster
said. The network gives graduate
women a chance to meet each other.
"There's someone who is doing
fascinating work, but you never
find out about it because they're
working two doors down," she said
Another issue the network ad
dresses is family life, a reality for
some members of the group. Ro
mano herself is married, which she
said definitely affects her social life.
Two network members have
taken wedding vows since the net
work started, Romano said.
"When someone gets married, we
go out and buy them drinks."
Some members also have chil
dren. Romano recalled attending a
reception at which there were "three
or four babies crawling around."
"It was great as long as you
didn't step on them," Romano
said, laughing.
The network is based in the In
stitute for Research on Women
and Gender "to emphasize its aca
demic roots," Poster added.
Although the network has
evolved into a social community, it
originally focused on providing op
portunities for academic advocacy
and discussion, especially between
