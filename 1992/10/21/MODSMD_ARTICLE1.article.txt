Funding a new Memorial Audi
torium sound system to improve
the quality of Flicks and student
performances was discussed at
last night's ASSU Senate meeting.
The $100,000 proposal would
include the installation of stereo
presentation and Dolby Sur
round Sound, graduate senator
Sanford Dickert told the senate.
Money for the project would
come from the available ASSU re
serves, which total about
$500,000, he said. A possible sur
charge of $1 to $3 added to the
price of Flicks passes could help
recover costs, Dickert added.
"I'm of the opinion that we
should spend the money for the
students," he said. "This project
would reach a wide number of stu
dents in the University."
The proposal will be discussed
further at the ASSU Budget and
Finance meeting Monday, where
Dickert said a bill will be created
for the senate to vote on.
Dickert said two companies,
Pro Media and Black Boxes Inc.,
are currently bidding on the pro
posed project. Pro Media would
use Meyer Sound components and
would cost about $130,000, and
Black Boxes Inc. would use
Apogee Sound components and
would cost about $100,000.
Both companies will test their
proposed systems at Memorial
Auditorium tomorrow to demon
strate their quality, he added
In other business, the senate
discussed a proposal for a bill
which would increase communi
cation between the ASSU and the
student body.
The proposal includes the dis
tribution of fliers before every
meeting, a quarterly newsletter
and the creation of an ASSU elec
tronic-mail bulletin board to
inform graduate students who
may not see the fliers.
In a move that may upset some
University officials, the senate
also delayed a vote on changes to
the Stanford Legislative and Judi
cial Charter until its next regular
meeting Nov. 3.
Graduate senator Kevin Rudd,
who proposed the delay, said he
believes he needs more time to
read about the changes before he
votes.
The changes, which have
already been passed by the Facul
ty Senate, slightly alter the rights
of students charged with miscon
duct as well as those of witnesses
and people who initiate com
plaints.
The senate also approved
senior Nneka Rimmer as the
ASSU Administrative Manager.
She will replace Enda Hu, who
resigned Oct. 2.
