Funding a new Memorial Audi
torium sound system to improve
the quality of Flicks and student
performances was discussed at
last night's ASSU Senate meeting.
The $100,000 proposal would
include the installation of stereo
presentation and Dolby Sur
round Sound, graduate senator
Sanford Dickert told the senate.
Money for the project would
come from the available ASSU re
serves, which total about
$500,000, he said. A possible sur
charge of $1 to $3 added to the
price of Flicks passes could help
recover costs, Dickert added.
"I'm of the opinion that we
should spend the money for the
students," he said. "This project
would reach a wide number of stu
dents in the University."
The proposal will be discussed
further at the ASSU Budget and
Finance meeting Monday, where
Dickert said a bill will be created
for the senate to vote on.
Dickert said two companies,
Pro Media and Black Boxes Inc.,
are currently bidding on the pro
posed project. Pro Media would
use Meyer Sound components and
would cost about $130,000, and
Black Boxes Inc. would use
Apogee Sound components and
would cost about $100,000.
Both companies will test their
proposed systems at Memorial
Auditorium tomorrow to demon
strate their quality, he added
In other business, the senate
discussed a proposal for a bill
which would increase communi
cation between the ASSU and the
student body.
The proposal includes the dis
tribution of fliers before every
meeting, a quarterly newsletter
