# Bosnia splits, president to resign

### 
GENEVA (AP) —The president of
Bosnia-Herzegovina yesterday agreed to
permit his battle-torn country to be
divided into autonomous areas and said
he would resign by the end of the year.
Separately, the presidents of Serb
dominated Yugoslavia and rival Croatia
took steps toward normalizing relations.
The three leaders were meeting in
Geneva to end the bloodshed in Bosnia
and seek a political resolution for the
former Yugoslav federation, which
broke up in a civil war that has killed at
least 24,000 people.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic,
who long opposed any decentralization of
his republic, said a proposal by interna
tional mediators to create eight to 10
autonomous regions is "fully acceptable."
But Izetbegovic again rejected Serb
demands for their own state. "We don't
want to form three religious states. We
want a European country," he said.
The war began in April, when Serbs
took up arms after refusing to accept a ref

erendum for an independent Bosnia.
Since then, the Muslims have lost control
over almost all of Bosnia.
The plan discussed by Izetbegovic
would create regions divided along geo
graphic lines, keeping major farming
and industrial regions intact and Saraje
vo as the administrative capital.
In an unexpected move possibly
aimed at strengthening ties with Bosni
an Croats, Izetbegovic also said he will
give up his presidency by December as
foreseen under a 1990 constitution.
As leader of Bosnia's defense through
out the 8-month-old war, he had been
expected to stay in office. Izetbegovic did
not say who might succeed him.
Meanwhile, Yugoslav President
Dobrica Cosic and Franjo Tudjman, the
Croatian leader, signed an agreement to
speed normalization of relations
between their states.
Serbs hold about one-third of Croat
ian territory, which they captured last
year after Croatia declared indepen

dence from Yugoslavia.
Cosic refused a Croatian demand for
immediate diplomatic recognition, but
the two agreed to open liaison offices in
each other's capitals and to grant dual
citizenship to Serbs in Croatia and
Croats in Yugoslavia.
The accord also would allow resettle
ment of people from one country to the
other.
It was unclear what effect the agree
ments would have without the support
of Slobodan Milosevic, the hard-line Ser
bian president, or that of Serb fighters,
who have tended to disregard pro
nouncements from Belgrade or abroad.
"There are some concrete results from
the talks but I still don't know how they
will be carried out," Izetbegovic said.
Cosic said he had contacted Serb
authorities in Bosnia and Croatia "and
insisted on the immediate stoppage of
ethnic cleansing" — the forced expulsion
of other ethnic groups from the Serb
occupied regions in Croatia and Bosnia.
