## Fee refund follies 
### 
ASSU's refund system
defies democracy,
needs much changing

IN ANY NORMAL democratic
society, a citizen is entitled to
one vote.
But don't tell this to the hun
dreds of Stanford students who
vote "yes" on special-fee funding
for student groups during spring
quarter, only to retract the same
vote once autumn quarter and stu
dent special-fee refunds roll
around.
Every spring quarter, during
the ASSU elections, students are
given the opportunity to decide
which student group's budgets
should be approved and paid for by
a special student fee. Voting stu
dents are provided with informa
tion about each group's budgetary
needs, enabling them to make
somewhat informed decisions.
But regardless of which way
they vote, all students who partici
pate in the spring elections are eli
gible for a full refund of their fee,
about $35. In effect, this means
that a student can "morally" sup
port the existence of every student
organization on campus, yet never
be held accountable for helping
those organizations survive finan
cially.
This voter's "perk" raises sever
al dilemmas both morally and
bureaucratically that could other
wise be avoided if students were
held to their vote during the spring
elections.
Once a special fee is approved,
no member of the Stanford com
munity should receive a refund.
Though special fees are the
most stable forms of funding stu
dent groups can muster, they are
also the most senseless. Each
year, organizations submit bud
getary information inflated by
about 25 percent. Why? Because
the ASSU sees fit to automatical
ly withhold a quarter of each

passed budget for the autumn
student refunds.
Aside from the fact that groups'
budgets are greater than they need
be, students are not held account
able for their voting choices.
In an attempt to provide stu
dents with a pleasant voting thank
you, the ASSU undermines the
entire democratic system it is
based on.
Under Stanford's warped sys
tem, a student is allowed to vote
for as many student organizations
he or she wants, and then return
the following year and collect every
cent of his or her refund.
Students are allowed to take a
moral position with a convenient
back door, something that never
happens in a democratic election.
Furthermore, the ASSU should
not allow a supplementary student
service to stand in the way of
important organizational busi
ness. There is no need for every
student organization's budget to
figure in an additional 25 percent
of funding that it is likely never to
see.
If you decided to vote yes on an
increased property tax in order to
further fund your local school dis
trict, for instance, your vote would
be unchangeable once submitted.
If passed, you and every other cit
izen who passed the bill would
then have to live with the collec
tive decision made by the commu
nity. The idea of casting a moral
vote in favor the raise and a finan
cial vote against it would be
absurd.
Why then should the ASSU feel
it any less absurd to allow students
to morally support the idea of spe
cial fees for MEChA or XTY if they
have no intention of using their
student fees to help these organi
zations?
It is time the ASSU started
treating the student body it serves
as a group of intelligent and
responsible individuals. In future
elections the individual's vote
should count only once, allowing
him or her the right and obligation
to stand by his or her decision.
