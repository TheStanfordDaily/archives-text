## Speech codes limit discourse 
### 
AT ONE TIME I WOULD never
have believed I would write a col
umn defending offensive speech
and the likes of Keith Rabois. How three
years can change your views!
For those of you who are new on cam
pus, Keith Rabois was a perennial conser
vative gadfly who decided he would "chal
lenge" the campus speech code by scream
ing homophobic epithets outside Otero.
There was a tremendous outcry
against Rabois' actions, and while the
University could do nothing officially,
Rabois was pilloried in the press and met
with universal condemnation. The Stan
ford community made it clear that this
was unacceptable behavior.
While it was an unfortunate episode, I
think that the response of the campus
community was the correct one. I am
troubled, though, by the fact that Rabois
was allegedly trying to tailor his com
ments to the campus speech code.
Not because I don't appreciate the
painstaking care he put into being offen
sive, but because I find it very problemat
ic that an institution such as Stanford,
dedicated to the principle of free dis
course, has branded some types of speech
as acceptable while condemning others.
When I entered as a freshman, Presi
dent Kennedy delivered a speech exhort
ing us to challenge authority and harbor
a healthy skepticism of the ideas we
would encounter here. Shortly there

after, though, the campus speech code
went into effect and certain ideas, which
we should have been encouraged to chal
lenge openly, were simply forbidden.
The Stanford speech code is modeled
after the fighting words doctrine of the
Chaplinsky Supreme Court case. In
Chaplinsky, the Court held that certain
types of offensive speech were not pro
tected by the Constitution. The
criticism of efforts to narrow free speech
is that people would feel unable or unwel
come to voice their opinions; that there
would be a chilling effect on free speech
for people who didn't know when certain
speech was acceptable.
Most Stanford students wouldn't be as
thorough in their research of acceptable
discourse as Keith Rabois claimed to be.
The fear of official University retaliation
would be enough to keep a person from
expressing his opinion.
So, you might ask, isn't that the idea,
to keep someone from uttering offensive
views? Well, yes. But to me the solution is
not to keep someone from expressing
obnoxious views aloud, but instead
encouraging them to throw their views
into an arena where they can be openly
debated. Preventing the expression of a
racist view, for example, does not cure
the person's racism. The code addresses
the symptom, not the cause of the error
in thinking. It forces the ideas under
ground to fester and deepen, and maybe

emerge even stronger.
As the heyday of the politically correct
movement fades from prominence, it is
essential that we re-evaluate the institu
tions it left behind. Across the nation,
campus speech codes are coming under
attack from all sides. Several campus
codes have already been struck down by
the courts. There is also a bill pending in
Congress which requires campuses
receiving federal funds to eliminate
speech codes. I believe we are now mov
ing in the right direction.
Stanford has entered a new era. Presi
dent Casper seems dedicated to restoring'
Stanford's image as a premier university
with lively and stimulating intellectual
discourse. What better way to underscore
Stanford's sincerity in this endeavor
than by abolishing the campus speech
code and allowing the free market of
ideas to function unfettered.
I am confident that the Stanford com
munity will continue to make clear what
it considers to be valid expression with
out the need for a codified standard.

Tom Flemma would strongly defend your
right to disagree with him. His column
appears on Wednesdays.
