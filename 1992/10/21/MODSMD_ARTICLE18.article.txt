Stanford seniors have qualifications for law school

IT WAS WITH utter disgust that I
read yesterday's editorial urging
Stanford seniors not to apply directly
to law school. Although I have come to
expect very little from The Daily, I was
insulted by the gall of the editors to
insinuate that they are in a better posi
tion to recommend the proper career
path than are the individuals so
involved.
For a paper that has become a bas
tion of liberalism and a sounding board
for the liberal agenda of the University
administration, I am amazed at the
paternalism voiced in the editorial.
How can a paper that endorses a
woman's unqualified right to make her
own reproductive decisions — a position
with which I strongly agree — turn its

own liberal ideology on its head by sug
gesting that a student's decision to apply
directly to law school is inherently
wrong? Surely, The Daily would not pre
judge a homosexual as having selected a
lifestyle that is inherently "wrong," nor
would they suggest that the individual
make a more "appropriate" choice.
Not only does the editorial smack of
paternalism, but it is an insult to the
intelligence and unadulterated aspira
tions of Stanford seniors. To state that
"most college students have no idea
what law school would be like" or "don't
understand what lawyers do" is to sug
gest that the decision to attend law
school is made in a vacuum without
careful attention to the pros and cons.
And to suggest that someone's deci-

sion to attend law school is influenced
by the most recent "LA Law" episode is
to endorse Vice President Quayle's
inane assertion that viewing "Murphy
Brown" will create a proliferation of sin
gle mothers.
Most students do not, as you state,
attend law school for lack of a better
option or in the hopes of financially
liquidating their education. Believe it
or not, there exist Stanford students
with bonafide interests in legal
careers, even careers in the less lucra
tive public sectors, who have spent
their summers and/or undergraduate
years investigating their career goals.
In stating that older law students
have more to contribute, you assume
that age automatically means experi

ential knowledge.
Take for example, the 30 year old stu
dent who has spent his post-undergrad
uate years basking in the Caribbean sun
as compared with the 21 year old Stan
ford senior who has presented a paper to
the American Political Science Associa
tion, volunteered for the ACLU legal
task force, interned at the White House
Chief Counsel office and written an hon
ors thesis on the legislative history of
the first amendment.
Sound crazy? Not if you believe, as I
do, that Stanford students are uniquely
impressive and dedicated leaders, as
opposed to the money-grubbing intellec
tual drones suggested by The Daily.
