# Asians need to break their long silence
## 
### 
Asian students at Stanford dwell in
silence, overly polite like nervous dinner
guests. Why our smiling feebleness, so
inappropriate to a group that claims a
quarter of the Stanford population? How
will we claim a voice, and so force our
selves into the debate of the wretched of
the earth, the fire that burns around us
and makes us sweat?
I will present here possible elements
of that debate, intended to provoke and
to anger.
First, forget rejecting the current
Asian stereotype. The fact that we still
occupy ourselves with battling this
stereotype demonstrates the stale and
anachronistic character of "the Asian
question" today; we fight the wrong foe
in unison, and end up wearing Depeche
Mode shirts together. Asian taste is bad
because it arises from (a misplaced) hys
teria.
But Asian bad taste — that is, Asians'

lack of a vital, positive, self-originating
culture — is also cultivated in organiza
tions such as AASA and Christian youth
groups, where a wish for community
subsumes idiosyncrasy and genius. They
dance idly around the lowest common
denominator, the most diluted cultural
products.
AASA produces little more than
careers and marriages. Asian (especially
Korean) Christian groups — colonized
religions — produce little more than
bent backs and hysterical symptoms:
mass catharsis, aphonia before the
preacher, paralysis in relentless prayer.
These are our first enemies.
As a race, we have attained relative
financial success, while resigning to
social and political failure, forgetting
that one wins moral authority by resis
tance and struggle. We are the "invisible
minority": abiding, harmless and impo
tent. Wishing for invisibility, we have
lost our vision — our eyes failed, the
fires that stir about us burn but more
clearly.
