## Best of both worlds Students assemble hybrid car 
### Sanjai Rao 
When most people think of the
car of the future, they probably
envision a vehicle like the time-trav
eling DeLorean from the movie
"Back to the Future."
They probably don't think of a
Ford Escort.
But by using only existing tech
nology, the Stanford Hybrid Auto
mobile Research Project (SHARP) is
attempting to modify an Escort into
a prototype of a "hybrid electric
vehicle" — one with a range of over
500 miles and a fuel efficiency of
over 50 miles per gallon.
"We want to create a car that you
could be viably produced today,"
said Project Coordinator Joel Miller.
The SHARP project, along with
similar projects at 29 other universi
ties, began in response to a challenge
issued by the Ford Motor Company
to build the best hybrid car.
This challenge was issued in light
of an upcoming state law that will
force any car manufacturer selling
cars in California to make 2 percent
of its cars zero-emission vehicles by
the year 1998.
Although a hybrid car, strictly
speaking, is not a zero-emission
vehicle, Miller feels that it is a big
step in the right direction.
The hybrid car's strategy is to
extend the range of an electric vehi
cle by using a gasoline generator to
recharge the battery system while
driving.
Miller believes that the hybrid
car is, at present, the best compro
mise between gasoline and electric
cars. The principal reason for this,
he says, is that electric cars require
large numbers of batteries that
severely limit their range.
For example, the General
Motors' Impact, developed as a pro
totype last year, has a range of only
100 miles, despite 1,100 pounds of
batteries. It takes approximately six
hours to recharge, making it
impractical for most consumers.
Right now, batteries have a limit
ed storage capacity — it would take
about 6,000 pounds of lead-acid bat
teries to contain the energy stored in
the Escort's 13 gallon gas tank.
A hybrid car, by contrast, should
in principle have a greater range
than most conventional gasoline
vehicles.
For the first 60 miles, the hybrid
will be a pure electric car, using only
the energy in its batteries to run a
75 horsepower electric motor. When
only 25 percent of the battery's
stored energy remains, a 23 horse
power gas generator kicks in. After
that, the car runs on what is effec
tively a gas-powered battery. Since a
car only needs 17 horsepower to
maintain its speed at 60 miles per
hour, the extra six horsepower
recharges the battery system.
"The generator under the hood

is very similar to your typical
Honda camping generator," said
Miller. "Of course it's significantly
more high-tech, lightweight, and
fuel efficient, but the basic design is
exactly the same — you pour in gas
and it puts out electricity. That elec
tricity is used to run the electric
motor that powers the car."
Although this process might
seem strange, the car is designed
this way in order to allow the gas
generator to operate at a constant
speed. Doing this makes the engine
more fuel-efficient and reduces its
emissions.
For example, a gasoline engine in
a standard car converts, at the most,
20 percent of its fuel into useful
energy. The hybrid's gas generator
has a 30 percent efficiency, and the
electric motor is 95 percent efficient.
When using the gas generator,
Miller says, the car should get 50-60
miles per gallon.
SHARP simulations show that
the car will be able to accelerate
from 0-60 mph in about 7 seconds,
and its top speed will probably be
electronically limited to 90 mph so
as to not damage the transmission.
SHARP has already modified the
Escort to run on electricity. They
are currently installing a larger elec
tric motor and the gas generator.
Although the advancements
made by Miller and his team have
been frequently publicized, SHARP
is still having trouble securing cor
porate donations.
"Corporate cash donations have
been really tough to come by," said
Miller. "So what we do instead is
call up a company and ask them for
a specific part that we need, that
they have already produced." The
group already has the batteries,
generator, and electric motor need
ed for the car, but they still need
better batteries and a complicated
control system.
Although Miller would like to see
auto manufacturers producing
hybrid cars in the near future, he
believes it may not necessarily be
financially practical for them. Since
the hybrid car is an ultra-low emis
sions vehicle, not a zero-emissions
vehicle, it does not fall under the
upcoming California requirements.
There is, however, a proposal in the
California legislature to alter the
law to require 10 percent of car sales
be ultra-low emissions vehicles
instead of the two percent sales of
zero-emission vehicles.
"Ultimately, I would really like to
see the public become aware of the
practicality and viability of cars like
this," said Miller. "If the public real
izes that there is an environmental
ly-friendly alternative which will not
affect their lifestyle or driving
habits, there will be a demand for
these vehicles. If the public is willing
to buy them, the auto manufactur
ers will produce them."
