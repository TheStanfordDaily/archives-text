# Potter's wheels versus Achilles' heels
## Flywheel batteries might make electric cars practical 
### Jim Morris 
The electric car's ability to compete
equally with the conventional gas-powered
automobile might come a step closer to
fruition if the owners of US. Patent No.
5,124,605 live up to their claims.
American Flywheel Systems, an
entrepreneurial firm based in Washington
state, didn't invent a completely new vehi
cle, but they outlined a new design for a
small but vital part of the increasingly pop
ular electric car: the battery.
Instead of storing energy by means of
electrochemistry, as in a lead-acid battery,
AFS claims that by using flywheels spin
ning at 200,000 RPM in a vacuum to accu
mulate kinetic energy, they can create bat
tery modules that can store three times as
much energy per pound as a chemical bat
tery.
The idea of using flywheels to store
energy is hardly new. Swiss buses in the
1960s used steel flywheels, and in the
19705, American engineers studied many
designs for building such a battery.
But the practical technology hadn't
caught up with the theoretical designs,
and federal funding was discontinued in
the 1980s.
Richard Post at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, and a Stanford gradu
ate, has spent more than 20 years modeling
the possibilities of flywheel batteries. In
1973, he and his son wrote a paper suggest
ing that flywheels be made out of very
strong composite fibers instead of steel, an
idea that has been used by designers ever
since.
Last year, at the behest of Electrical
Engineering Prof. Emeritus Robert Kinch
eloe, a flywheel enthusiast, Post gave a pre
sentation to a Stanford audience of stu
dents, engineers and faculty about the
changes in flywheel battery concepts since
1980. And in a recent interview with The
Daily, he voiced his opinions on the feasibil
ity of the AFS design.
"Several technological advances have
now made a flywheel battery feasible," he
said, citing stronger carbon fibers for fly
wheel fabrication, better magnetic bearings
and magnetic designs, and cheaper, more
advanced solid-state electronics. He said,
however, that the technology still needs to
become cost-competitive.
Post has outlined the fundamental
advantages of using a flywheel battery over
a chemical battery in a paper published.
Because of. a five-fold increase in
strength of fiber composites over the past
decade, Post claimed that a flywheel battery
could store 112 Watt-hours per kilogram,
almost three times the 35 Watt-hours per
kilogram a chemical battery provides. Post
also noted that an electric car motivated by
such a battery would be more powerful
than a V-6 gasoline engine.
Another advantage of flywheels over
chemicals is the reduction in charging time
required. In a society that covets conve
nience, the prospect of having to charge
chemical batteries overnight dooms the
appeal of an electric car to a few diehard
environmentalists.
A flywheel design could recharge in just
seven minutes, according to both Post and
the patent.
But the major appeal of a flywheel
system would be that its "turnaround

efficiency" is very high, Post explained.
Lead-acid batteries typically release only
70 percent of the energy fed into them.
In theory, however, virtually all the
energy fed into a frictionless flywheel
can be recovered by electromagnetic
techniques.
Although the flywheel idea is seductive,
Post noted in his lecture that problems with
safety, gyroscopic effects, excessive vibra
tions and materials have led industry and
the government to virtually ignore flywheel
research.
Both AFS and Post said they have meth
ods to solve all these new problems. To
ensure optimum safety during an accident,
the flywheels are to be constructed with
carbon fibers that are 10 times stronger
than their equivalent in steel.
If the flywheel does break down, "the
carbon fibers would melt into a benign mass
of cotton candy," according to Kincheloe. A
failing steel flywheel, by contrast, would
spew harmful grenade-like shrapnel into
hapless passersby.
The next problem attacked by AFS was
the gyroscopic effects felt by the flywheel
when turning a corner or going uphill. A
change in the car's direction can put stress
on the magnetic bearings of the flywheel,
causing it to malfunction. The patent

describes a system whereby two flywheels
inside the module spin in opposite direc
tions.
Post disagrees with this approach, say
ing "this configuration is quite unnecessar
ily complicated. A pair of modules next to
each other producing no net force would
accomplish the same goal without the com
plexity."
Vibrations are aiso a hindrance to a
smoothly
bumps like a car hitting a curb at 40 mph
can cause the flywheel to become unbal
anced and break down without proper sus
pension," said Post.
AFS would solve this problem by using
liquid bearings to cushion the spinning
disks from impacting their magnetic bear
ings. Post is currently working on two dif
ferent solutions. Each would require
advancements in magnetic bearing technol
ogy that he believes could be achieved at
present technology levels.
Post's continuing work on the flywheel
over the past twenty years has been upgrad
ed from "on the side work" to a full project
with discretionary funding. In addition,
LLNL is encouraging its researchers to help
transfer their research to the private sector,
in accordance with a recent federal man
date.

5,124,605 live up to their claims.
American Flywheel Systems, an
entrepreneurial firm based in Washington
state, didn't invent a completely new vehi
cle, but they outlined a new design for a
small but vital part of the increasingly pop
ular electric car: the battery.
Instead of storing energy by means of
electrochemistry, as in a lead-acid battery,
AFS claims that by using flywheels spin
ning at 200,000 RPM in a vacuum to accu
mulate kinetic energy, they can create bat
tery modules that can store three times as
much energy per pound as a chemical bat
tery.
The idea of using flywheels to store
energy is hardly new. Swiss buses in the
1960s used steel flywheels, and in the
19705, American engineers studied many
designs for building such a battery.
But the practical technology hadn't
caught up with the theoretical designs,
and federal funding was discontinued in
the 1980s.
Richard Post at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, and a Stanford gradu
ate, has spent more than 20 years modeling
the possibilities of flywheel batteries. In
1973, he and his son wrote a paper suggest
ing that flywheels be made out of very
strong composite fibers instead of steel, an
idea that has been used by designers ever
since.
Last year, at the behest of Electrical
Engineering Prof. Emeritus Robert Kinch
eloe, a flywheel enthusiast, Post gave a pre
sentation to a Stanford audience of stu
dents, engineers and faculty about the
changes in flywheel battery concepts since
1980. And in a recent interview with The
Daily, he voiced his opinions on the feasibil
ity of the AFS design.
"Several technological advances have
now made a flywheel battery feasible," he
said, citing stronger carbon fibers for fly
wheel fabrication, better magnetic bearings
and magnetic designs, and cheaper, more
advanced solid-state electronics. He said,
however, that the technology still needs to
become cost-competitive.
Post has outlined the fundamental
advantages of using a flywheel battery over
a chemical battery in a paper published.
Because of. a five-fold increase in
strength of fiber composites over the past
decade, Post claimed that a flywheel battery
could store 112 Watt-hours per kilogram,
almost three times the 35 Watt-hours per
kilogram a chemical battery provides. Post
also noted that an electric car motivated by
such a battery would be more powerful
than a V-6 gasoline engine.
Another advantage of flywheels over
chemicals is the reduction in charging time
required. In a society that covets conve
nience, the prospect of having to charge
chemical batteries overnight dooms the
appeal of an electric car to a few diehard
environmentalists.
A flywheel design could recharge in just
seven minutes, according to both Post and
the patent.
But the major appeal of a flywheel
system would be that its "turnaround

efficiency" is very high, Post explained.
Lead-acid batteries typically release only
70 percent of the energy fed into them.
In theory, however, virtually all the
energy fed into a frictionless flywheel
can be recovered by electromagnetic
techniques.
Although the flywheel idea is seductive,
Post noted in his lecture that problems with
safety, gyroscopic effects, excessive vibra
tions and materials have led industry and
the government to virtually ignore flywheel
research.
Both AFS and Post said they have meth
ods to solve all these new problems. To
ensure optimum safety during an accident,
the flywheels are to be constructed with
carbon fibers that are 10 times stronger
than their equivalent in steel.
If the flywheel does break down, "the
carbon fibers would melt into a benign mass
of cotton candy," according to Kincheloe. A
failing steel flywheel, by contrast, would
spew harmful grenade-like shrapnel into
hapless passersby.
