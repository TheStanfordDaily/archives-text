Q # When people get too much
Ihead on their beer, some
times they will wipe the side of
their nose with their finger and
stir the beer, thus eliminating the
foam. How does this work?
— A Beer Drinker
A # Allow me to confess that
I before you asked, I hadn't
considered the possibility that
someone could get too much head.
Different strokes for different
folks, I guess.
I only learned of the trick that
you describe a few months ago.
The kind woman who taught me
this strategy for getting one's
foam down informed me that it is
also an excellent strategy for pick
ing someone up: after a demon
stration of the trick, simply invite
your mark to lick the foam from
your finger. Assuming you go
after the kind of people who like to
do that sort of thing, you'll be set.

I must admit that my kind
instructor in no way used the
aforementioned ploy to pick me up.
Then again, the last time a woman
picked me up, it was only because
it was time to change my diapers.
But I digress. I'm not getting
paid to complain about my sex
"life," but rather to inform you
about the physical and chemical
underpinnings of this fascinating
phenomenon.
Beer forms a head when poured
for the same reason that dishwash
ing liquid forms bubbles when agi
tated. Both beer and soapy water
contain chemicals called surfac
tants, substances which have a
somewhat schizophrenic relation
ship with water.
A surfactant molecule has a
water-loving charged portion (the
hydrophilic region), as well as a
water-avoiding oily portion (the
cunningly named hydrophobic
region). When a surfactant hits
water, the conflicting behavior of
these two regions can result in the
formation of some very interest

ing structures.
Interesting to us is the surfac
tant structure known as a bilayer.
Here, the hydrophobic tails are
sandwiched between two layers
(hence, the name) of hydrophilic
heads, kind of like the sugary white
stuff in the middle of an Oreo 1 ".
A bilayer sheet can wrap
around to form a sphere, and it is
from such bilayer bubbles — with
air on the inside and water on the
outside — that foam is made.
The source of foam's stability

is not yet precisely understood.
The pressure inside a bubble is
inversely proportional to its
radius, so there is a natural ten
dency for small bubbles to fuse
into larger ones, forming bigger
and bigger bubbles until they
burst. The odds are therefore
stacked against a bunch of adja
cent bubbles trying to maintain
their individual integrity.
It is thought that a complex
array of electrostatic and mechan
ical forces, acting at the interfaces

between bubbles, give suds their
staying power. Surface tension, a
result of water molecules' desire
to stay together, is doubtless a key
player in maintaining a bubble's
individuality.
When you wipe the side of your
nose with your finger and stir
beer foam, your major contribu
tion to what happens next has
been the introduction of a small
amount of skin oil to the mixture
of alcohol, water, and surfactants.
The oil is hydrophobic (hence the
old saw, "Oil and water don't
mix."), and its molecules spread
out over the surface of the beer as
a layer only one molecule thick.
The oily monolayer drastically
reduces surface tension. (To vivid
ly demonstrate this, pour a table
spoon of olive oil onto a lake on a
windy day. The ripples, which
depend on surface tension for
their continued existence, will dis
appear.) This effect disrupts the
delicate balance of forces at the
bubble interfaces, causing the
bubbles to fuse together and even

tually burst, leaving behind a
smooth surface that won't mus
tache your upper lip every time
you take a drink.
Incidentally, the disruptive
effect of oils on surfactant suds
also explains why, when you wash
your hair twice in succession, only
a small amount of shampoo is
needed the second time around —
a phenomenon I've heard friends
refer to as the "shampoo effect."
The oils which prevented massive
foaming during the first wash are
not present during the second —
so even if you use a little Finesse,
it will feel like you've used a lot.
Sometimes, I find the unity of
science truly frightening.

Q # When people get too much
Ihead on their beer, some
times they will wipe the side of
their nose with their finger and
stir the beer, thus eliminating the
foam. How does this work?
— A Beer Drinker
A # Allow me to confess that
I before you asked, I hadn't
considered the possibility that
someone could get too much head.
Different strokes for different
folks, I guess.
I only learned of the trick that
you describe a few months ago.
The kind woman who taught me
this strategy for getting one's
foam down informed me that it is
also an excellent strategy for pick
ing someone up: after a demon
stration of the trick, simply invite
your mark to lick the foam from
your finger. Assuming you go
after the kind of people who like to
do that sort of thing, you'll be set.

I must admit that my kind
instructor in no way used the
aforementioned ploy to pick me up.
Then again, the last time a woman
picked me up, it was only because
it was time to change my diapers.
But I digress. I'm not getting
paid to complain about my sex
"life," but rather to inform you
about the physical and chemical
underpinnings of this fascinating
phenomenon.
Beer forms a head when poured
for the same reason that dishwash
ing liquid forms bubbles when agi
tated. Both beer and soapy water
contain chemicals called surfac
tants, substances which have a
somewhat schizophrenic relation
ship with water.
A surfactant molecule has a
water-loving charged portion (the
hydrophilic region), as well as a
water-avoiding oily portion (the
cunningly named hydrophobic
region). When a surfactant hits
water, the conflicting behavior of
these two regions can result in the
formation of some very interest

ing structures.
Interesting to us is the surfac
tant structure known as a bilayer.
Here, the hydrophobic tails are
sandwiched between two layers
(hence, the name) of hydrophilic
heads, kind of like the sugary white
stuff in the middle of an Oreo 1 ".
A bilayer sheet can wrap
around to form a sphere, and it is
from such bilayer bubbles — with
air on the inside and water on the
outside — that foam is made.
The source of foam's stability

is not yet precisely understood.
The pressure inside a bubble is
inversely proportional to its
radius, so there is a natural ten
dency for small bubbles to fuse
into larger ones, forming bigger
and bigger bubbles until they
burst. The odds are therefore
stacked against a bunch of adja
cent bubbles trying to maintain
their individual integrity.
It is thought that a complex
array of electrostatic and mechan
ical forces, acting at the interfaces

between bubbles, give suds their
staying power. Surface tension, a
result of water molecules' desire
to stay together, is doubtless a key
player in maintaining a bubble's
individuality.
When you wipe the side of your
nose with your finger and stir
beer foam, your major contribu
tion to what happens next has
been the introduction of a small
amount of skin oil to the mixture
of alcohol, water, and surfactants.
The oil is hydrophobic (hence the
old saw, "Oil and water don't
mix."), and its molecules spread
out over the surface of the beer as
a layer only one molecule thick.
The oily monolayer drastically
reduces surface tension. (To vivid
ly demonstrate this, pour a table
spoon of olive oil onto a lake on a
windy day. The ripples, which
depend on surface tension for
their continued existence, will dis
appear.) This effect disrupts the
delicate balance of forces at the
bubble interfaces, causing the
bubbles to fuse together and even

tually burst, leaving behind a
smooth surface that won't mus
tache your upper lip every time
you take a drink.
Incidentally, the disruptive
effect of oils on surfactant suds
also explains why, when you wash
your hair twice in succession, only
a small amount of shampoo is
needed the second time around —
a phenomenon I've heard friends
refer to as the "shampoo effect."
The oils which prevented massive
foaming during the first wash are
not present during the second —
so even if you use a little Finesse,
it will feel like you've used a lot.
Sometimes, I find the unity of
science truly frightening.
