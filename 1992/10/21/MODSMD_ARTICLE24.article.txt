# Why electric cars save both energy and the environment

### Aaron Thode Editorial staff 
Electric cars use less fossil fuels and pro
duce fewer emissions than gas-powered vehi
cles. Period.
The internal combustion engine has only
a 10 percent efficiency while driving in the
city. In addition, when distilling gasoline
from crude oil, oil refiners lose 15 percent of
the original fuel. The net result is that
Americans import nearly 12 gallons of crude
oil in order to produce one gallon of useful
power.

Now let's look at a conservative sce
nario for electric vehicles. A typical power
plant has a 33 percent efficiency, if one
includes electricity transmission losses.
Suppose that only 70 percent of the elec
tricity fed into a battery can be recovered
as useful power, as is the case for lead-acid
batteries.
By plugging in the numbers one sees that
an electric car would consume 2.7 times less
energy than a gasoline vehicle.
If all the cars in America became electric
overnight, how much additional electricity
will utilities have to produce? Currently 25
percent of all energy consumed in America is

for transportation purposes. Dividing 25
percent by '2.7, and then dividing this num
ber by 75 percent, shows that utilities would
have to only increase their output by 12 per
cent, mostly during the night as the cars
recharge.
And whoever said power plants had to use
oil, anyway? Natural gas, which burns much
cleaner than coal or oil, is the fastest grow
ing power plant fuel, .
