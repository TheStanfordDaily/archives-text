## Unassuming frosh finds niche in Cardinal midfield 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
For any freshman, coming to Stanford
can be an intimidating experience. You
and your above-average SAT score arrive
to meet a roommate who speaks four lan
guages fluently, assists a Nobel Prize
winning physicist and plays a mean game
of quarters.
If that sounds familiar, you know
what freshman soccer player Carmel
Murphy felt like when she got here. Mur
phy, an excellent center midfielder,
earned a starting spot alongside senior
Julie Foudy, who won the World Cup last
year and has been called "the premier
center midfielder in the world" by the
U.S. national team coach.
Not surprisingly, Murphy was initially
intimidated by her talented teammate.
"Carmel's very polite and unassum
ing, and tends to defer too much to her
teammates on the field," said Cardinal
coach Berhane Andeberhan.
Murphy agreed. "One of the things I
need to work on is to demand the ball
more," she said. "A lot of times I'll let
Julie do a lot of the work."
But Murphy is adjusting to college
soccer, which is more physically and
mentally strenuous than the game she
played at the club level. She started
playing soccer at the age of four when
her father, a former club player in Ire
land, pushed his six daughters into the
sport.
Since making the transition to the
Stanford program, Murphy has focused
on playing rigorous defense, which Ande
berhan demands of every athlete.
"What we stress is playing defense
first, and then work the ball to offense,"
Murphy said. "At the beginning of the
year I wasn't too clear on [defensive
strategy!."
But she's made rapid progress in that
realm. Andeberhan was particularly

pleased with how well Murphy controlled
the midfield against two top-20 squads,
Central Florida and Notre Dame.
Besides playing tough defense, the
freshman also contributed to the offense
by notching an assist against, fittingly,
the Fightin' Irish. The Cardinal won
both its games and, because of the posi
tion she occupies, Murphy's play was
crucial to the team's success.
As a center midfielder, she has exten
sive offensive and defensive responsibili
ties. Center midfielders link the fullbacks
and forwards, organize play in the most
active part of the field, create scoring
opportunities and come up and take
shots themselves.
Murphy has quickly adapted to the
position and its many duties after playing
forward for most of her club career.
"I actually like midfield better because
I'm not as good with my back to the
goal," she said. "When I'm at midfield I
can see the entire field. More options are
available to me there."
However, the change to midfield has
had a negative effect on her play in a
purely statistical sense.
Formerly a prolific scorer, Murphy
has only three goals and two assists on
the season and finds herself in a goal
drought since she's been concentrating
more on defense.
"Sometimes I'm not up in the play

because I've been playing defense and
I'm tired so I don't run up on the
offense," she said. "If I'm hanging way
back I'm not going to get a shot."
Despite the fewer opportunities on
goal, Murphy expected to light up the
scoreboard a few times. But she has yet
to score at home, something she has the
confidence to joke about.
"I used to have a good shot, I
thought," she said. "I've been a little
rusty."
Murphy's best scoring opportunity at
Maloney Field came in last week's match
with California. From outside the penal
ty box, she curved a missile towards the
upper left corner of the net. The ball
eluded the goalie's fingers but found the
goalpost with a resounding smack.
Murphy threw her head back in dis
gust when she realized the shot hadn't
gone in."The first thing I said to Julie
was, 'This field's a jinx. I know it,'"
Murphy said.
Despite the scoreless streak, her
tenacity and ability to see the field has
made her a force in the middle. But she
will likely have to be even more of a play
maker and field general next year when
Foudy is gone.
"I think Julie does more of that than I
do," Murphy said of being a team leader.
"But I think I'll have to take over next
year. I'll have to learn from her."

Stanford midfielder Carmel Murphy fakes out a Cal State- Hayward opponent early in
the season. Murphy's control of the center will be a key factor today as the Cardinal
faces St. Mary's.
For any freshman, coming to Stanford
can be an intimidating experience. You
and your above-average SAT score arrive
to meet a roommate who speaks four lan
guages fluently, assists a Nobel Prize
winning physicist and plays a mean game
of quarters.
If that sounds familiar, you know
what freshman soccer player Carmel
Murphy felt like when she got here. Mur
phy, an excellent center midfielder,
earned a starting spot alongside senior
Julie Foudy, who won the World Cup last
year and has been called "the premier
center midfielder in the world" by the
U.S. national team coach.
Not surprisingly, Murphy was initially
intimidated by her talented teammate.
"Carmel's very polite and unassum
ing, and tends to defer too much to her
teammates on the field," said Cardinal
coach Berhane Andeberhan.
Murphy agreed. "One of the things I
need to work on is to demand the ball
more," she said. "A lot of times I'll let
Julie do a lot of the work."
But Murphy is adjusting to college
soccer, which is more physically and
mentally strenuous than the game she
played at the club level. She started
playing soccer at the age of four when
her father, a former club player in Ire
land, pushed his six daughters into the
sport.
Since making the transition to the
Stanford program, Murphy has focused
on playing rigorous defense, which Ande
berhan demands of every athlete.
"What we stress is playing defense
first, and then work the ball to offense,"
Murphy said. "At the beginning of the
year I wasn't too clear on [defensive
strategy!."
But she's made rapid progress in that
realm. Andeberhan was particularly

pleased with how well Murphy controlled
the midfield against two top-20 squads,
Central Florida and Notre Dame.
Besides playing tough defense, the
freshman also contributed to the offense
by notching an assist against, fittingly,
the Fightin' Irish. The Cardinal won
both its games and, because of the posi
tion she occupies, Murphy's play was
crucial to the team's success.
As a center midfielder, she has exten
sive offensive and defensive responsibili
ties. Center midfielders link the fullbacks
and forwards, organize play in the most
active part of the field, create scoring
opportunities and come up and take
shots themselves.
Murphy has quickly adapted to the
position and its many duties after playing
forward for most of her club career.
"I actually like midfield better because
I'm not as good with my back to the
goal," she said. "When I'm at midfield I
can see the entire field. More options are
available to me there."
However, the change to midfield has
had a negative effect on her play in a
purely statistical sense.
Formerly a prolific scorer, Murphy
has only three goals and two assists on
the season and finds herself in a goal
drought since she's been concentrating
more on defense.
"Sometimes I'm not up in the play

because I've been playing defense and
I'm tired so I don't run up on the
offense," she said. "If I'm hanging way
back I'm not going to get a shot."
Despite the fewer opportunities on
goal, Murphy expected to light up the
scoreboard a few times. But she has yet
to score at home, something she has the
confidence to joke about.
"I used to have a good shot, I
thought," she said. "I've been a little
rusty."
Murphy's best scoring opportunity at
Maloney Field came in last week's match
with California. From outside the penal
ty box, she curved a missile towards the
upper left corner of the net. The ball
eluded the goalie's fingers but found the
goalpost with a resounding smack.
Murphy threw her head back in dis
gust when she realized the shot hadn't
gone in."The first thing I said to Julie
was, 'This field's a jinx. I know it,'"
Murphy said.
Despite the scoreless streak, her
tenacity and ability to see the field has
made her a force in the middle. But she
will likely have to be even more of a play
maker and field general next year when
Foudy is gone.
"I think Julie does more of that than I
do," Murphy said of being a team leader.
"But I think I'll have to take over next
year. I'll have to learn from her."
