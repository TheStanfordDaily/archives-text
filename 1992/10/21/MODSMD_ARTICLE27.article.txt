# Stanford men's soccer hopes to defeat Dons
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Today the Stanford men's soc
cer team will put its four-game
winning streak on the line as it
faces off against the defending
West Coast Conference champi
ons, the University of San Fran
cisco Dons, at Maloney Field.
Stanford is coming off two solid
performances over the weekend as
it up-ended California on the road,
2-1, and then returned home to
blank conference rival Fresno
State in a 2-0 contest.
On the other hand, USF (7-6-
1, 1-2-0 in WCC play) has strug
gled as of late and is entering the
game on the heels of a three-game
skid. That does not, however,
detract anything from the power
and depth of its front-line attack
ers.
Junior Greg Vandenberg, who
is playing his first injury-free sea
son for the Dons, leads his team
in scoring with nine goals and
four assists, including three
game-winning goals. Comple
menting him is senior forward
Angelo Sablo, a pre-season Ail-
American candidate. Thus far he
has registered six goals and four
assists on the year.
Trying to shut down the
Dons' powerful scorers will be a
Cardinal defense that has
allowed only one goal in its last
four games. Backfielders Robert
Brophy and Niels Bruckner will
anchor the Cardinal defense,
which features senior goalkeeper
and co-captain Kyle Krpata, who
is currently rated fourth in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion with a 1.07 GAA and six
shutouts.
On the offense, Stanford (10-4-

0,4-1-0 in MPSF action) will be led
by senior midfielder Jason Vana
cour's seven goals and two assists.
Sophomore midfielder Ryan
Collins is only one goal short of
tying Vanacour for the team lead.
However, coming off two con
secutive conference wins, the Car
dinal starters might not see that
much action today against a strug
gling, non-conference club such as
USF.
"Since this game is not as cru
cial as a conference match, I might
play some of the guys who don't
get to start as often," coach Colin
Lindores said.
"It would be nice to get some
fresh bodies out there and allow
some of our key players to take a
physical and mental break before
Friday's game against San Jose
State, which will count in the con
ference standings."
But the fact remains that USF
is coming off a championship year
and boasts two legitimate offen
sive threats in Vandenberg and
Sablo.
"The Dons are a team, record
wise, that is not in great shape,"
Lindores said. "But we can't go in
too relaxed, because they're just
the type of team that has the abili
ty to catch us off guard if we are
not ready to play."
After the USF match, the Car
dinal will stay at home to take on
San Jose State and then, in a
showdown which might decide the
conference title, Stanford will go
up against a solid Washington
team that still leads them by one
game.
"Let's hope that we can beat
USF and San Jose pretty soundly
so we can concentrate on going
head-to-head with Washington for
the championship," Lindores said.
