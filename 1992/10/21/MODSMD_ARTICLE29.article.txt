# Battered Cardinal looks to beat Beavers
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
Stanford coach Bill Walsh called his Cardi
nal a very concerned team, and said the days
leading up to Saturday's game against Oregon
State could be a "dangerous week for us emo
tionally."
The battered Cardinal is coming off a mis
erable performance against No. 21 Arizona
that left many doubts about the Stanford
offense.
For the second consecutive week, the Cardi
nal was simply unable to move the ball against
a defense with quickness. And its offensive
impotence has caught Stanford off guard.
"I was shocked that we were unable to cope
with [Arizona's defense]," Walsh said. "I felt
we could throw the ball very effectively on first
and 10. We started out the game doing it, but
it would be one thing after another that would
go wrong."
One of those things was Arizona's pass rush
exploiting what has so far been the Cardinal's
greatness weakness this season: it's offensive
line. Not helping matters was the fact that
starting left tackle JefT Bailey missed Satur
day's game with mononucleosis, and is expect
ed to be out at least two more weeks.
"Steve Stenstrom has been underdressed all

year because of problems with our pass protec
tion," Walsh said. "Now there's not quite a
feeling of desperation, but we're just going to
have to get things together with our offensive
line."
Stanford is fortunate that Oregon State
presents an excellent opportunity to do just
that. The Beavers have racked up just 11
sacks, and coach Jerry Pettibone admits the
pass rush is one of his team's weak links.
"We don't have big, strong lineman that can
force a rush on the passer themselves, so we
have to do other things to compensate. We
have to bring our linebackers or people out of
the secondary to put pressure on the quarter
back"
After the beating Stenstrom took last week
end, including a frightening concussion that
took him out of the game for a quarter and a
half, Pettibone's words are music to Sten
strom's ears.
Stenstrom will be fine for Saturday's con
test in Corvalis. But, Walsh joked, "its good
that (Stenstrom) doesn't remember what hap
pened to him" last weekend.
Many other Cardinal key figures, however,
are not as physically sound. Starting tailback
Glyn Milburn suffered a separated shoulder
against Arizona and — while he may start —
will only be available on a limited basis.

Butkus Award candidate Ron George, will,
according to Walsh, see action on a limited
basis, due to a nagging hamstring contusion.
Last weekend's 21-6 loss to Arizona sent
the Cardinal plummeting in the polls. After
reaching the top 10 for the first time in 20
years, Stanford fell all the way to No. 16.
But more important than polls at this ptflrtt
is the Pacific 10 Conference race. A first place
finish and Rose Bowl berth is still feasible. In
fact, the Cardinal controls its own destiny — if
it wins all five remaining games, it will go to
Pasadena.
But a more realistic goal is to try and avoid
a third-place finish, which would lock Stan
ford into the less-than-attractive Freedom
Bowl.
All this talk seems to overlook the Beavers,
which, given that they've been outscored 159-
32 over the last four weeks, isn't difficult to do.
To give credit where credit is due, Oregon
State did tie Arizona 14-14 in the third week of
the season, though all parties agree that the
Wildcats are now an incomparably improved
team.
But if the Cardinal's crushing loss to Ari
zona did anything, it gave Stanford a wake-up
call.
"After last week's shocker, we're unable to
look past anyone," Walsh said.
