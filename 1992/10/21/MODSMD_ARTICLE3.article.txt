# Profs endorse Eshoo
## Huening counters with Campbell commercial 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
With less than two weeks of campaign
ing left in the tight race for the 14th Con
gressional District seat, nearly 200 Stan
ford faculty members have thrown their
support to Democratic candidate Anna
Eshoo.
The endorsement by the group, which
includes former University presidents
Donald Kennedy and Richard Lyman,
comes as both Eshoo and her Republican
opponent, Tom Huening, are intensifying
their advertising campaigns in an effort to
sway undecided voters.
At a news conference Monday featuring
Kennedy and Lyman, Eshoo's campaign re
leased a list of 179 Stanford faculty mem
bers who endorsed her, including Law
School Dean Paul Brest and 11 department
chairs. The group called her the best advo
cate for health-care reform, children's wel
fare and environmental protection.
But Huening's campaign responded
quickly, noting that he has already secured
the support of several prominent members
of the Stanford community. They include
Hoover Institution Distinguished Fellow

George Shultz, a former secretary of state;
Political Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice, a
former Bush administration adviser; and
Law Prof. Tom Campbell, who has held the
local seat in the House of Representatives
for the last four years.
Securing high-profile endorsements may
be particularly important for the 14th Dis
trict race because many voters appear to be
undecided. A poll conducted by The Daily
last week found that 31 percent of Stanford
students planned to vote for Eshoo, while 9
percent intended to support Huening. But
an overwhelming 60 percent said they were
still undecided.
Both Eshoo and Huening are members of
the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors,
and both hold generally progressive positions
on a range of social issues. Huening has fo
cused his campaign around the themes of con
trolling government spending and reforming
Congress, while Eshoo said she is more con
cerned about policy reform on health care, the
environment and other issues.
"I don't think she decides issues on the
basis of ideological prescription," Kennedy
said, explaining his endorsement of Eshoo.
"I got to know her on some real
ly difficult health care issues,"
Kennedy added. "She's very, very
savvy about how to get things
done."
Bob Marks, Huening'B cam
paign manager, said yesterday
that he is unconcerned by the
endorsement of Eshoo, adding
that the campaign is "extremely
happy" with the endorsements it
has already secured.
Huening's campaign plans to
step up its advertising by featuring
a Stanford supporter of its own:
Campbell, who abandoned his
House seat to pursue an unsuccess
ful bid for the U.S. Senate this year.
Marks said the new ad, sched
uled to run on a dozen Bay Area
radio stations, features Campbell
criticizing Eshoo's economic plan
and saying that Huening's agenda,
which calls for a freeze in spending
and a line-item veto, would be
more effective in cutting the feder

al deficit.
The 14th District includes por
tions of San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties and stretches from
the Pacific coast to San Francisco
Bay. Eshoo ran against Campbell
for the local seat in 1988 and lost
by 5 percentage points.
This week's endorsement of
Eshoo ironically comes just after
University President Gerhard
Casper expressed his reservations
about endorsements in general. In
a visit to Kimball Hall two weeks
ago, Casper said that neither uni
versities, nor people representing
them, should take public positions
on political issues.
While Casper was unavailable
for comment yesterday Kennedy
said Casper would not object to the
endorsement.
Kennedy said he and Lyman
made it clear at the news confer
ence Monday that they and the fac
ulty members "were doing this as
private individuals — not on behalf
of or in our roles as members of the
University."
