# Stanford volleyball crushes UOP Tigers

If you were in attendance at the
Stanford women's volleyball game
against the University of Pacific
last night, you might have thought
Halloween came early this year.
Dozens of orange-and-black
clad fans swarmed into Maples to
root on their fourth-ranked Tigers
against the No. 2 Cardinal, but
Stanford brought the home crowd
alive and silenced Pacific fans with
a resounding 3-0 win, 15-8, 15-9,
15-11.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team (15-1, 8-1 in Pacific-10
Conference play) outlasted the
Tigers (14-3) with flawless execu
tion on offense and a stubborn dig
ging defense. The Tigers had trou
ble getting kills all night, as senior
tri-captain Laurie Sawin and
senior Anne Wicks seemed to dig
up everything but the floor at
Maples.
"I feel good — we handled them
pretty well," Stanford head coach
Don Shaw said after the game.
"We played some good defense and
in the end we just hung in longer
than they did."
In the first game, Stanford and
UOP rallied back and forth to tie
the game at 8-8. Then the Cardinal
went on a 6-0 run behind solid hit
ting from freshman Carrie Wen
dell and senior tri-captain Bev
Oden, and never looked back afler
that, winning the game 15-8.
Pacific rallied in the second
game behind hitters Vikki Simonis
and captain Katy Eldridge, and led
the Cardinal 8-5 late in the match.
But the Cardinal fought back,

putting together a 7-0 run to go
ahead for good. Stanford held on
to win the game 15-9.
The lead went back and forth in
the third game. The two teams
were tied at 6-6, then again at 8-8,
and kept within two points of each
other until Stanford put together
four points at 11-11 to take the
game and match 15-11.
"They were all hard-fought
games tonight," Shaw said. "It's a
credit to them (Stanford) that they
always get up for the big games,
and this was one of them. Every
big game, we seem to rise to the
occasion."
For the third match in a row,
the Cardinal got solid production
from its bench. Wendy Hromadka
entered the contest in the first
game and provided a much-needed
spark to the Stanford attack,
pulling together broken plays and
digging tough spikes from Pacific's
Eldridge.
Shaw agreed that Hromadka
was a key part in the Cardinal's
formula last night. "The team
needed a lift, and she's been hot
lately," Shaw said. "It's great
when we can have someone come
in from off the bench and help us
like that, and she gave us the lift
we needed."
Stanford's offense was notice
ably improved since it's last
matches against Washington State
and California, and Shaw credits
that in large part to setter Carrie
Feldman.
"Feldman doesn't get the noto
riety of a Bev, but when the game
plan is going well for us — like
tonight — she's got a lot to do with
that."
