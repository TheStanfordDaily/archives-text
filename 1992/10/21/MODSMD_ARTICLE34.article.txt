# Trouble in paradise
## A 						Lantana is a Lantana is ... a poisonous tree

Residents of Lantana, one of the two new dormi
tories on campus, are unhappy with the house's
name and have hung a new sign declaring it "Coun
try Club North."
This latest alternative name comes after weeks of
grumbling about the official name. Earlier this year,
Lantana residents put up a large banner requesting
"underground name suggestions." On the poster
next to the sign, several people in the past few weeks
scrawled alternative suggestions — including Love
Shak, Nirvana, House of Pain, Lambada Hall and
Better Homes and Gardens.
"The sound 'Lantana' is not pleasing," said resi
dent Anna Conklin, a junior. Other students said
they would have liked to participate in the naming of
the residences that comprise the Manzanita II com
plex completed this year.
"Castano" — the name of the other half of the
new dormitory — and "Lantana" were chosen
because the two primary benefactors wanted them
to be consistent with the name Manzanita, a Span
ish plant, said Robin Hensley, coordinator of new
student housing. Both residences are built on the
site of the old Manzanita trailer park.

Drew Oman, who works in the Planning Office,
said Manzanita means "group of woody shrubs or
ground covering." The housing office researched
and picked 12 names of Spanish plants based on the
criteria of sound, spelling and ease of remembrance.
The benefactors selected the names Lantana and
Castano from this list.
Despite residents' displeasure, other buildings
that are planned for the site will also have names
related to the word Manzanita, said housing offi
cials.
Many residents said one reason they disliked the
name Lantana is that it means "poisonous tree."
Castano Resident Assistant Jeff Ciriello said he
researched the meanings of both names and that
this translation is accurate, although Lantana is
technically a shrub rather than a tree.
But Oman, who was on the committee that
helped choose the names, said Lantana is a "small to
medium, flowery shrub" and is "definitely not a poi
sonous tree."
Lantana and Castano are both native to Central
America. Lantana is also found in California and
campus specimens are located behind History Cor
ner. Oman said that Castano is a sub-tropical ever
green tree that is used for timber.
