## Stanford Stadium to host six soccer games 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Stanford Stadium will host six World
Cup soccer games between June 20 and
July 10, 1994, the tournament organizing
committee announced yesterday.
Stanford will be the site of games June
20, June 24, June 26 and June 28. In addi
tion, one Round of 16 match, July 4, and a
July 10 quarterfinal will be played in the
86,019-seat stadium.
Approximately 500,000 of the world's
most rabid sports fans will descend upon
Stanford for the six contests, estimated World
Cup USA representative John Griffin. About
half the spectators will be foreign, he said.
"In effect, Stanford will be playing host
to six Super Bowls," Griffin said. "For the
first time ever, we will be able to see what it
is that captivates the rest of the world."
The quadrennial event — in which 24
team finalists from around the world

compete for the cup — is one of the largest
and most popular international sporting
events. The 1994 tournament will be the
first one held in the United States.
Griffin said tickets will be sold only in
six-game "venue strips." Members of the
U.S. Soccer Federation will receive first
crack at tickets before sales open to the gen
eral public in April of next year.
Stanford is one of nine sites across the
country hosting World Cup matches. Two of
the four first-round matches at Stanford
will feature one of the six seeded teams,
which will be announced in December 1993.
The championship and third-place
games will be held in the Rose Bowl.
World Cup organizers announced last
month that Stanford Stadium would re
ceive $3.5 million in renovations in prepa
ration for the tournament including recon
struction of the press box and replacement
of wooden bleachers with aluminum seat
ing.
