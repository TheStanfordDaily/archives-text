# Need a second opinion? Cowell to open health library
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Cowell Student Health Center
will house a student health library
on its second floor within a month,
thanks to a $10,000 donation from
the Stanford Mothers' Club.
"We're shooting for a mid-No
vember opening," said Carol
Pertofsky, the director of Cowell's
Health Promotion Program. The
projected date depends on
whether the rest of the 250-vol

ume collection arrives on time, she
added.
Anyone with a student ID will
have access to library resources,
but at least initially, materials will
not be available for borrowing.
Computers, furniture and the
collection itself will be covered
with the year-old donation, al
though the Health Promotion
Program hopes to receive addi
tional funding from other sources
for future acquisitions, according
to Pertofsky.

Cowell Director Harvey Wein
stein said the program had been
searching for funding when the
Mothers' Club made its donation.
However, the departure of former
program director Pat Fabiano put
the library plans off until hiring
Pertofsky.
The new library will contain
health journals, files of clips from
several magazines and periodicals
geared toward the health concerns
of students.
According to Pertofsky, the

program ordered material with
the Stanford student body in
mind. "You don't need a medical
background to use the materials,"
she said.
The library is being created "for
people who want to answer the
right questions about health and
become better educated con
sumers" who are better prepared
to ask their doctors questions, We
instein said.
"We want I the library) to be
student-focused and student-led,"

Pertofsky said.
Already the Health Promotion
Program has a handful of student
volunteers led by Janna Friedly,
the coordinator for the library. Ac
cording to Weinstein, her duties
include: acting as liaison between
the student library and the Health
Library at the Stanford Shopping
Center; insuring the resources ar
rive on time; and working closely
with a soon-to-be-chosen advisory
group.
This advisory group will keep

track of student needs and up-date
materials as necessary, Weinstein
said. He and Pertofsky plan to
choose the members of the board
before the opening.
The program also hopes to in
volve many students as volunteers
soon. "No previous background is
required," she said.
All interested students are en
couraged to attend the informa
tional meeting tomorrow at 4 p.m.
at Cowell, Pertofsky said.
