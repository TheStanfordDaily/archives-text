# Solar car project catches some sun on the run

Unlike car teams at other
schools, Stanford students in
volved with the Solar Car Project
don't subscribe to Autoweek.
"None of us are really interested
in cars," coordinator Alex Tilson
said. "I don't even have a car."
But the team is interested in
winning two upcoming races —
one across the United States and
the other through Australia.
In 1989, about 20 students
founded the project. It allows stu
dents to apply engineering skills
along with environmentalism
through the use of an alternative
energy source.
The project's goal was to design
and build a car for the General Mo
tors Sun Ray ce last year. After two
years of planning, production
began in January of 1991.
College teams across the coun
try participated in the Sunßayce,
speeding from Florida to Detroit.
Stanford entered their completed
vehicle, the SunSurfer, placing
seventh out of 32 teams.
Students involved with the pro
ject are now gearing up their new
car, Sunßurner, for the upcoming
races.
According to project coordina
tor Alex Tilson, Sunßurner seats
two people: a driver and a passen
ger, who must lie down in the rear
portion of the vehicle. Sunßurn
er's roof is lowered down onto the
car after passengers have been
seated he said.

A solar panel, which serves as
the vehicle's roof, is composed of
11.7 square meters of solar cells
and provides the car with power,
Tilson explained.
The team is learning how to
make a more lightweight, efficient
car, said Brett Bowman, the
team's other project coordinator.
At peak performance, Sunßurn
er converts about 17 percent of the
sun's energy into 1,800 watts — or
2.5 horsepower — of electricity,
Tilson said. Energy absorbed from
the sun through the solar panel is
stored in the batteries located in
side the car, he added.
The batteries currently being
used in the car weigh 330 pounds,
he said, but the ones used for the
racing events weigh only 95
pounds. The lighter batteries, he
said, are more expensive and have a
very limited life cycle.
Sunßurner is 200 pounds
lighter than its predecessor — in
race configuration, it weighs a
mere 410 pounds. Its top speed is
61 miles per hour using batteries,
47 mph while fueled by solar
power alone. To date, the car has
travelled a total of 200 miles.
The team hopes to reduce the
drag of the vehicle to the equiva
lent of a 1.6 square foot flat plate,
said Tilson.
"The goal is always to go fast ef
ficiently," Tilson said.
Sunßurner will participate in
this year's Sunßayce, in which
solar cars will sprint across the
country from Texas to Minnesota.
Teams from UC-Berkeley,

Pomona, Fresno, Michigan and
Reed are also competing in this
event.
Next November, Stanford stu
dents are scheduled to race in Aus
tralia's 1993 World Solar Car

Challenge, an 85-team, 3,000 mile
event, which Tilson called "the
Super Bowl of car racing."
Bowman said solar-powered
cars will most likely never be inte
grated into the mass transit sys

tem. They are analogous to formu
la-one race cars that go 200 miles
per hour at two miles per gallon,
he said. Like these race cars, pure
