Government predicts quake
PARKFIELD, Calif. (AP) — Residents
of this tiny coastal range town on the San
Andreas fault went about their business
yesterday despite a unique warning from
government seismologists that a powerful
earthquake could hit soon.
Prompted by a 4.7-magnitude quake
Monday night, the state Office of Emer
gency Services warned residents in a 30-
mile radius of a 1 in 3 chance of a large
quake by tomorrow night.
The prediction was the first such warn
ing issued as part of the U.S. Geological
Survey's Parkfield project, the world's
most comprehensive earthquake predic
tion experiment.
An earthquake measuring 5.5 to 6.0 on
the Richter scale would fulfill a 1985 agen
cy forecast that a strong shaker would
strike the area by the end of 1992.
The warning did not deter residents
from their routines.

"We're so used to all these earth
quakes. . . . It's really no big deal to us,"
said Alice Miller, who owns a ranch out
side town.
A sign outside the Parkfield Cafe reads:
"Earthquake Capital of the World. Be
Here When It Happens."
New job for NATO
GLENEAGLES, Scotland (AP) - The
United States and its NATO allies agreed
yesterday to draw up plans for a new post-
Cold War peacekeeping role in European
conflicts.
U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
met with his counterparts from 15 other
nations in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization in northern Scotland. The
purpose of the meeting was to assess
nuclear strategy.
The ministers discussed their plans to
have 5,000 soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina
by early December to guard relief convoys.
