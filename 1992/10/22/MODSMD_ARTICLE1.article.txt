A discharged can of mace sent
at least two women to the hospi
tal and forced the evacuation of
more than 80 Potter residents
for almost two hours yesterday
afternoon.
Stanford police closed Santa
Theresa Street from Lagunita to
Campus Drive and prevented
pedestrians, bicyclists and cars
from approaching Sterling Quad
as approximately 15 Palo Alto
firefighters spent more than an
hour searching the dormitory for
what they initially suspected was
a gas leak.
But two hours after evacuating
all of the residents, firefighters
declared that the "acid-like" odor
had disappeared and allowed peo
ple to return to their rooms.
"Apparently, there was an
anonymous report that someone

accidentally discharged a can of
mace," said Palo Alto Fire Capt.
Tom Rice. "It was an hour before
anyone called.
"We don't have the canister.
We just have the report and symp
toms, but it all adds up," he said.

"There was a very strong acidic
odor. We had to go in with a
breathing apparatus," Rice said.
Soon after they arrived at Pot
ter, firefighters said they be
lieved the odor originiated in ei
ther the dorm kitchen or lounge

but appeared baffled by the cause
before they received the anony
mous tip. University Health and
Safety representatives were
going to be called in to use gas de
