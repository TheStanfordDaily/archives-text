# Odor vacates Potter
## 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Howard Libit Editorial staff 
A discharged can of mace sent
at least two women to the hospi
tal and forced the evacuation of
more than 80 Potter residents
for almost two hours yesterday
afternoon.
Stanford police closed Santa
Theresa Street from Lagunita to
Campus Drive and prevented
pedestrians, bicyclists and cars
from approaching Sterling Quad
as approximately 15 Palo Alto
firefighters spent more than an
hour searching the dormitory for
what they initially suspected was
a gas leak.
But two hours after evacuating
all of the residents, firefighters
declared that the "acid-like" odor
had disappeared and allowed peo
ple to return to their rooms.
"Apparently, there was an
anonymous report that someone

accidentally discharged a can of
mace," said Palo Alto Fire Capt.
Tom Rice. "It was an hour before
anyone called.
"We don't have the canister.
We just have the report and symp
toms, but it all adds up," he said.

"There was a very strong acidic
odor. We had to go in with a
breathing apparatus," Rice said.
Soon after they arrived at Pot
ter, firefighters said they be

but appeared baffled by the cause
before they received the anony

Safety representatives were
going to be called in to use gas de

tectors to test the air in the dorm.
The mace probably dispersed
through the windows and doors in
the dorm lounge.
Rice said the incident was par
ticularly unusual because "it's
not a lab. You wouldn't expect
something like that there."

Theresa Riseborough, the
facilities supervisor for Gover
nor's Corner, said she was con
tacted by a resident assistant who
said someone "smelled something
strange in the lounge area."
"I started choking the moment
I walked in. It was like you
couldn't breathe," Riseborough
said. She called the fire depart
ment and was eventually taken to
Stanford Hospital for observation.
Sophomore Sunny Chung, who

said he was one of the first to
detect the smell, said in the area
near the dorm lounge everyone
"was on the floor coughing."
"They were coughing and com
plaining of a burning sensation in
their throat," Chung said. "So we
felt there must be something seri
ously wrong instead of just some
thing normal."
