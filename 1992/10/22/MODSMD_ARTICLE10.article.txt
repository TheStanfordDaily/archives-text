Hard-liners challenge Yeltsin
MOSCOW (AP) — Hard-line legislators yesterday set the
stage for a political showdown with President Boris Yeltsin by
voting to convene the Communist-dominated parliament for a
session aimed at slowing market reforms.
Lawmakers also decided to investigate Yeltsin aides who told
Western reporters that hard-liners were preparing a "constitu
tional coup" against Yeltsin's reformist Cabinet.
In a raucous legislative session, supporters of Speaker Ruslan
Khasbulatov voted 114-59 to reject Yeltsin's plea to put off con
vening the Congress of People's Deputies, or parliament, until
March. The parliament will meet Dec. 1.
"The purpose of the session will be to seek the resignation of
the government. Not Yeltsin. But leading Cabinet members,"
said lona Andronov, a conservative lawmaker from Vladimir.
Reformers accused Khasbulatov of being intoxicated late yester
day, after the meeting.
The lopsided vote showed that reformers in the government
are losing ground to a coalition of state industrialists, labor lead
ers and collective farm managers who fear market reforms.
