# Massacre locale found in El Salvador

EL MOZOTE, El Salvador (AP)
— With trowels and brushes,
archaeologists are laying bare the
floor of a parish house-turned
charnel house where dozens of
dirty skulls and a puzzle of chil
dren's bones attest to atrocity.
The Legal Aid Office of the San
Salvador archdiocese of the
Roman Catholic church said in a
report last year that the U.S.-
trained Atlacatl counterinsurgen
cy battalion killed about 1,000
peasant men, women and children

in six hamlets over four days.
Digging in this remote aban
doned hamlet has produced proof of
a December 1981 massacre that the
U.S. Embassy now officially recog
nizes, but initially tried to deny and
that local rightists still call a fig
ment of subversive propaganda.
At the time, American aid to
this Central American country was
being challenged by Congress
because of widespread human
rights abuses by Salvadoran forces.
Until now there had been no

physical evidence. The church
based its report on testimony from
a handful of survivors and sketchy
accounts from residents of nearby
villages.
In the polarized climate during
12 years of civil war, such testimo
ny often was impugned as biased
or politically motivated.
The site had not been excavated
previously because of El Mozote's
location in the heart of the north
eastern war front.
But the signing of U.N.-bro

kered peace accords in January per
mitted excavation here that, since
work began Oct. 13, has uncovered
the remains of 37 individuals, most
under 13 years of age.
A team of forensic anthropolo
gists, assisted by the government's
Institute of Legal Medicine and the
church legal office, is investigating
the site.
The legal aid office said nearly
400 people were killed in El Mozote,
80 miles northeast of San Salvador,
on Dec. 11, 1981, and that more
than 600 others were slain in other
hamlets during the following days.
The parish house appears to
have been the place where children
were held or took refuge while
their mothers and fathers were
being slain.
The Argentine team plans to
spend weeks excavating at least
one site in each of the six hamlets
and analyze skeletal remains,
spent cartridges, coins, scraps of
clothing — and draft a preliminary
report by mid-November.
The report will go to the Sal
vadoran judiciary and to the Truth
Commission, a panel of three for
eign dignitaries established under
the peace accords.
The commission is investigat
ing the worst cases of human
rights abuses during the war.
The area around El Mozote was
a bastion of leftist rebels battling
government forces that were fund
ed and trained by the Reagan
administration.
The Diario de Hoy, which often
expresses ultra-conservative views,
blamed accusations against the
Atlacatl on "leftist groups" and
cited unidentified "analysts" as
maintaining that those killed in El
Mozote died "in a confrontation
between terrorists and the army."
