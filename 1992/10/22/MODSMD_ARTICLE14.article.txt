## Stop White flight

Street vendors are a vital
part of the relaxed nature
associated with the Plaza

FOR ALL ITS TALK OF mul
ticulturalism and diversity,
Stanford can sometimes be a
really bland place. Students seem
to wear the same informal uniform
of sweats and jeans as they travel
under ever-blue skies to various
destinations within the Taco Bell
monolith.
A pleasant contrast from the
monotony is the vendors in White
Plaza. Though they are a definite
ly different, sometimes motley
group, they have come to charac
terize the free-for-all, fiea-market
meets-Fifth-Avenue essence of
White Plaza for Stanford stu
dents.
Students can find all kinds of
gadgets, accessories, and wares on
the short expanse between
Tresidder and the post office.
Many of the goods come with an
interesting story or special hand
crafting.
The vendors themselves run the
gamut from psycho-comical, bor
derline members of society to polit
ical dissidents to Mom and Pop
outfits. They are a bit of spice and
sophistication, a nice departure
from the quick, impersonal service
found in most established areas of
business.
But as of Nov. 1, students will
have to buy their Guatemalan
sweaters, funky T-shirts, and nov
els on Confucius elsewhere. The
tax-exempt status of the land and
the lack of funds available to pay
for monitoring the vendors, have
caused University officials to
decide to remove them from the
area. Paul Szczesiul, associate
manager of Tresidder said, "With
the vendors we aren't getting any
thing tangible by letting them sell
there."

Such action is hasty and does
not give other options a chance.
White Plaza is no Telegraph
Avenue or Haight Street, but the
vendors, like the skateboarders
and other refreshingly non-Stan
ford types, add a dash of flavor to
the otherwise pretty, but often
boring, atmosphere. They offer
students an interesting and acces
sible alternative to the yuppie
haven of Palo Alto, the overpriced
Bookstore, or distant San Francis
co.
There are other avenues. The
University could change the tax
status of the land. In conjunction
with this move the price of the
vendor license can be raised to
cover the pay for a monitor to
make sure that sales tax is being
properly charged.
Another alternative is that the
ASSU could sponsor the vendors.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
has said that the University is not
adverse to the idea of a student
run monitor group supervising the
tax collection. It has been noted
that student government at other
colleges have successfully — and
profitably — sponsored business
strips.
At a time when there are budget
cuts and rising costs — such as the
proposed price hike on Flicks pass
es to cover the cost of a new sound
system — affecting every segment
of student life, students would
really appreciate some wise inno
vation on the part of their student
government. The ASSU could save
a much-loved institution and in
the process make a profit.
With a rising national dissatis
faction with the political process
and an "I Prefer Not To Have A
COP" slate, it might be prudent
for the politicos in the ASSU to get
a hold of a project that is less
redundant than fee-refunds and
more profitable than "Beat the
Bookstore".
Save the vendors in White
Plaza. Otherwise, the only inter
esting thing left there may be the
smell.
