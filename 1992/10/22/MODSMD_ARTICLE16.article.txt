IN A RECENT ARTICLE, The New
York Times expressed the world's
praise and respect for Derek Walcott,
the West Indian poet and this year's
recipient of the Nobel Prize in literature.
After extensive discussion of Walcott's
African, Dutch and English ancestry, and
his artistic contribution to Caribbean cul
ture and the English language, the article
uses one of its last paragraphs to refer, in
a cursory fashion, to an incident involv
ing Walcott which occurred 11 years ago.
While serving as a visiting professor at
Harvard, he was reproached for sexually
harassing a student.
The paragraph seems to be squeezed
into the article without any care whatso
ever — a jarring break in the text preced
ing and following its appearance. My ini
tial reaction was dismay with the vague
mention of the past episode, with its
power to stain the laudatory tone of the
rest of the article.
Wasn't this hasty interjection irrele
vant to his being honored as a seminal
figure in world literature? And why was
it that I couldn't help but feel accustomed
— practically numb — to such treatment
by the media? It's hard these days to
swallow any piece of news that doesn't
leave one disgusted with the human con
dition.
After considering further the article's
reference to Mr. Walcott's offense, I
began to realize that those reading the

article probably should know about the
harassment charge. Why not? It's Ameri
ca, and we love to throw darkness upon
those in the spotlight. No, it's more than
this. It's about the truth, and the truth
can be ugly.
If the Nobel Prize recipient is being
revered as an eminent figure, our appre
ciation and reception of him should not
be limited by our propensity to equate
excellence in accomplishment with excel
lence in character.
I am not making any sort of judgment
of this specific author, because I know
nothing about his reputation as a teacher
and human being. Rather, I am glad to
accept this instance of personal truth and
revelation in the media as a means of
awakening — not as a means of baiting as
it often appears to be. I finally decided
that The New York Times was merely
careless in its presentation, and I could
leave it at that.
On Tuesday morning, however, I had
to confront, on a more intense level, the
vulnerability of the individual to the
power and persuasion of the media.
Reluctantly, I refer to the Stuart Thomas
incident of last year, and to a letter in
Tuesday's Daily headlined "Stuart
Thomas doesn't deserve affiliation with
Stanford, ever."
I will not recall the specific circum
stances of the incident, but I will make
the claim — albeit risky — that the reali

ty of what happened did not fully justify
Thomas' face being smeared all over The
Daily for the length of the year.
This is not at all meant to excuse or
defend what Thomas did, but rather to
propose the question: did he really
deserve such excessive headline expo
sure? Perhaps so, because one could
argue that it was the exposure which
could serve to deter future offenses. But
perhaps it is also the relentless expo
sure which led to such an absurd state
ment in Tuesday's letter that the
author "still wants to shoot the bastard
in the head."
Such a "basic instinct" ridicules the
author's premise which could have been
stated with eloquence rather than vio
lence and an ugliness exceeding that of
the very event it recalls. Maybe the
source of such an instinct is in the accu
mulation of front-page articles and not
the author's heart.
Maybe not. Maybe we should not let
the age of information degenerate into
one of batterv and indifference.
