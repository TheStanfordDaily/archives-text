Psych department dismayed over portrayal of Psych 1

C C Tl hysician, heal thy-
SELF," we say to the Daily in
J- response to last Friday's mor
tifying diagnosis of Stanford's intellectu
al health.
Commendably, the Daily editors echo
University President Gerhard Casper's
commitment to a vigorous intellectual
life at Stanford. Sadly, they show little
academic rigor in their own analysis of
the matter.
As members of the Psychology Depart
ment we were particularly dismayed to
see the editorial portray Psych 1 as "a
lousy introduction . . . that relies almost
exclusively on rote memorization."
We couldn't disagree more. More
over, the authors offered no evidence in
support of their condemnation. In the
spirit of true intellectualism, then, we
would like to present evidence for the
opposite conclusion — that Psych 1 is
one of Stanford's best courses.
We do not know how the editorial
board came to their conclusions about
Psych 1, so we can only assume that
they surveyed themselves. At last count

there were seven editorial board mem
bers.
If they had done their Psych 1 home
work they would have learned that their
survey method suffers from the prob
lems of small sample size and extreme
sample bias. If you want to know how
students view Psych 1 you should ask
lots of them, not just seven.
Over 250 students took the class last
spring and 153 turned in evaluations. Of
those who rated the overall quality of
the course, 98 scored it as excellent, 50
as good and three as fair. Likewise,
when students rated the content of the
course, 79 checked off excellent, 66 good
and five fair.
Although close to 100 students didn't
respond to the survey, it seems unlikely
that this group is dominated by harsh,
yet silent critics. The most conservative
conclusion we can draw is that students
who like Psych 1 don't end up working
for the Daily.
Furthermore, the instructor last
spring, Prof. Anne Fernald, received 131
excellent ratings and 21 good scores.

That same quarter, Fernald was elected
by undergraduate students to receive an
ASSU Teaching Award for classes with
more than 30 students.
Finally, we cannot resist quoting the
Daily's orientation issue last year which
lists Psych, as taught by Prof. Laura
Carstensen, as one of Stanford's "superb
courses with lots of class. . . that exposes
students to the best of the country's top
psychology department."
Has so much changed in one year —
besides the editorial board?
But, of course, just because the class
is popular, does not mean that it meets
high intellectual standards. Intellectual
strength is more difficult to achieve
than popularity and a much thornier
variable to measure.
Nevertheless, those of us who teach
Psych 1 at Stanford make this our pri
mary goal of the class: We want students
to understand both the depth and
breadth of contemporary research psy
chology.
One of the consequences of reaching
for this goal is that students must mas

ter a large body of information; hence
memorization is necessary — in psy
chology as in any other science. Psy
chology is an incredibly broad field and
we expect students who finish the class
to be conversant in all of its topics.
What is more, we spend much effort
in Psych 1 teaching the fundamentals of
scientific methodology. Students may
sign up for research sections where they
learn to design and conduct their own
psychology research projects. Our goal in
these sections is to give students the
tools they need to go beyond late night
dorm debates and answer their questions
about psychology with intellectual rigor.
So before you write another column
condemning intellectual life at Stanford,
we urge you to follow your own prescrip
tion: "Burn the midnight oil," and apply
a bit of intellectual rigor to your analy
ses of the world.
