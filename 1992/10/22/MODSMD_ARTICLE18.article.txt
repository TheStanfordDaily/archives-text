# Endorsement policy is misleading to students
## 
### 
The Daily's Oct. 19 article, "'Sorry,
no endorsements' policy dictated to stu
dent political groups" was ambiguous
and misleading.
The guidelines are as follows: prohib
ited political activities include 1) solicit
ing of funds or endorsements for candi
dates 2) receiving University support 3)
use of Stanford name and seal, address
and telephones, services and equip
ment, or personnel.
Permitted political activities include
1) use of public places, such as White

Plaza, for information tables or speech
es 2) intermittent use of facilities for
meetings or speeches by political candi
dates.
The reason for these guidelines is to
avoid implying University involvement
or support in partisan political activi
ties.
Student organizations can endorse a
candidate, as long as they are repre
senting their own membership and not
Stanford as an institution.
