# Problems? The Ombudsperson is in
## Annual report shows total complaints increased slightly last year 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Skyrocketing faculty complaints and "up
heavals" at the Medical School due to highly
publicized sexual harassment cases have Uni
versity Ombudsperson Leah Kaplan worried.
"People don't feel they're being fairly dealt
with by the University, and that concerns me,"
said Kaplan, who released her annual report
yesterday.
The report showed a slightly higher number
of visits to her office for the 1991-92 school
year, with 431 compared to 408 the previous
year.
However, the number of complaints by fac
ulty and academic staff nearly doubled, from
44 to 73.
Kaplan, who acts as an impartial adviser but
has no decision-making authority, attributes
the huge increase to concerns over recent bud
get cuts.
After some employees lost their positions,
she said, "the remaining people paid a terrible
price. There's a lot of stress on the job."
"A lot of upheavals" have also taken place in
the Medical School after last year's sexual ha
rassment charges, Kaplan said. "It's been a
year where it's a very touchy problem."
Neurosurgery Prof. Frances Conley drew
national attention when she resigned in June
1991, citing "pervasive sexism" in the Medical
School. In an unrelated case, then-University
President Donald Kennedy brought sexual ha
rassment charges against Prof. Mark Perlroth
just weeks later.
When the associate ombudsperson left the

Medical School last year, Kaplan said she
ended up dealing with an increasing number of
grievances from the school.
The total number of visits concerning sexual
harassment reached 11 last year, compared to 18
the year before. But Kaplan noted that the num
bers include people just looking for information.
She estimated that there were four com
plaints of actual harassment during 1991-92.

As an example, she described an incident in
volving "a staff member who felt her supervi
sor was making inappropriate remarks" and
writing sexually suggestive poems.
Kaplan said she advised the woman to write
a letter telling the supervisor his actions "could
be construed as sexual harassment" and asking
