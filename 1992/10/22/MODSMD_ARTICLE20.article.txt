## Frosh Wendell big hit on Farm 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
When Cary Wendell stepped
back to serve for the first time
against No. 4 University of Pacif
ic, she was greeted by a chorus of
taunts by the rowdy Tiger cheer
ing section, who chanted, "Fresh
man! Freshman!"
Twenty seconds later, Wendell
drove the ball into the Pacific side
of the floor for the point, setting
the tone for a match in which she
would put away about a dozen
more just like that.
Of course, the Cardinal has no
problem with three more years of
Cary Wendell. She leads the team
in digs this year with 134, and is
hitting. .291 with 127 kills. She
adds to Stanford's imposing start
ing lineup by combining solid dig
ging on defense with a punishing
swing at the net. And all this from
someone who worries more about
her Philosophy CIV homework
than her national ranking.
"I'm just now getting back
into classes — I've been sick
awhile," she confessed.
In 1990 Wendell was selected
as Newsweek's high school player
of the year, and in 1991 she gar
nered player of the year honors
from Volleyball Monthly, titles
which quickly made her one of the
top two recruits in the nation.
But even after this early success
on the court in high school, Wen
dell was not entirely sure she'd
start at Stanford.
"I always knew I could do it —
I had a chance," she said. "But it
wasn't going to be easy. It's defi
nitely more intense at this level,
way more than it was in high
school."
Wendell did crack the starting
lineup however, and has started
for the Cardinal since the begin
ning of the year. Now, she says,
she is having the time of her life.
"It's a lot of fun to play volley
ball full time," Wendell said. "My
family comes up every weekend to
watch, and it's fun just to hang
out with the team because they're
all great to be with."
Stanford is now second in the

Pacific 10 Conference and is well
on its way to another NCAA
appearance in December, thanks,
according to Wendell, to a confi
dent attitude and tight execution
on the part of the players.
"Everyone has a role on this
team, and any one of us can come
into the match and do the job," she
said. "We are really confident
because we feel like we're always
improving, that we've never
reached our potential as a team."
Wendell credits her play and
that of her teammates to the sup
port and the guidance of the
coaches and the team itself.
"Everyone on the team helps each
other — the coaches, the players,"
she said. "Our job is to play good
volleyball as a team."
Wendell admits, however, that
while the team is always concen
trating on the next match, there
will always be one team in the
Cardinal's way of a national
championship.
"UCLA is always there in the
back of our minds," she said. 'We'll
hit them again next week in L.A. —
if we beat them, fine, if we don't,
fine. The season is what matters to
us, and we know we'll get another
chance at it (in NCAA's)."
Wendell is quick to point out
that key players have kept the
Cardinal winning this year, specif
ically setter Carrie Feldman.
"Carrie's the leader out there
— she's like our quarterback,"
she said. "She's a smart player
and she's the main reason why we
get a lot of the points we do."
While it's common knowledge
that Stanford women's volleyball
is a perennial contender for the
national championship, the title
itself has eluded the Cardinal.
Wendell believes that this year
might be different.
"I think we have one of the
best shots of any team this year,"
she said. "We know we have the
ability to do it — it's just a matter
of it all coming together for us at
the right time."
If the past is any indication,
Cary Wendell might just have
them chanting a different tune in
the NCAA Finals.
