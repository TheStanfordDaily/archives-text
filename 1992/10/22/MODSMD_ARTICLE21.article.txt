# Stanford squeaks out win over St. Mary's
## Cardinal soccer breaks out of beginning slump to dominate St. Mary's in second-half action 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Sometimes it's good to just get off the
field with a win. That's the way women's
soccer coach Berhane Andeberhan felt after
the No. 2 Cardinal eked out a 1-0 victory
over No. 20 St. Mary's.
"We were a little flat today," Andeberhan
said. "But we battled well enough to win."
Neither offense nor defense hit on all
cylinders in the first half. The Gaels con
trolled play and took advantage of Stanford
defensive miscues to pressure Cardinal
goalie Lesley Garrard.
"Instead of coordinating the defense they
wanted to get the ball immediately and go,"
Andeberhan said of the impatient defense.
"And then sometimes they sat back and
seemed to wait for St. Mary's to lose the
ball."
Stanford didn't fare much better on
offense as the midfielders and forwards had
difficulty connecting with each other close
to the Gael goal. With key attackers Sarah
Rafanelli and Dena Dey struggling through
slumps, the Cardinal lacked scoring punch
in the first half and escaped the period with
a scoreless tie.
Rafanelli came to life in the second half
and kept constant pressure on the Gaels'
defense while Dey knocked in the lone goal
to secure the Cardinal's 13th victory of the
season.
Andeberhan was relieved to see Rafanel
li show signs of her normally explosive
play.

"She created a lot of opportunities in the
second half and showed a lot of composure,"
he said. "We can't do it without her. She
doesn't have to play her best all the time,
but we need her to be a factor for two
halves."
The Cardinal dominated the second half
by constantly putting pressure on the Gael
defense and shutting down St. Mary's
offense. Almost the entire period was
played on St. Mary's half of the field and,
while Stanford bombarded the Gael goalie
with 17 shots on goal, Garrard faced not
one.
Dey scored the only goal of the game 20
minutes into the half. Julie Foudy took the
ball down the left side and shot it towards
the mouth of the goal. The ball caromed off
a defender, Dey picked it up near the right
post and angled it past the diving goalkeep
er.
Minutes later Dey was again the center
of attention when the referee warned her
about objecting to a call.
On a play on St. Mary's end line, the ref
eree said the ball had gone out on Stanford
and signaled for a goal kick. Several Cardi
nal players, including Dey, anticipated a
corner kick and disagreed with the call.
"All Dena said was that it was a corner
kick," Andeberhan said. "The referee was
trying to cover up for his mistake."
Despite the controversy, Stanford con
tinued to control play and eventually ran
out the clock. The Cardinal is now 13-1 on
the season and next hosts Santa Clara on
Saturday.
