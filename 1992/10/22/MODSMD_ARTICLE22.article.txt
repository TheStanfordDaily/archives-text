# Don't stop Chop
## 
### 
The World Series is upon us, and with game five
tonight, what seemingly could becomo an annual
occurrence has reared its annoying head once more.
The Atlanta Braves are the National League
Champions for the second year in a row, and along
with their pennant, Atlanta fans and the rest of the
nation must endure petty protests outside of Ful
ton County Stadium and the Toronto Sky Dome
regarding the name of the ballclub and its rallying
cry, the Tomahawk Chop.
The protesters outside the venues believe that
the name "Braves," and the Chop-and-chant the
fans utter, are offensive to Native Americans. They
feel that the team name should be changed and the
Chop stopped.
The problem is, however, that these protesters
are doing more to hurt their cause than help it.
Sports should not be politicized. If these people
could somehow get the team names changed, what
would be accomplished?
Would Native Americans be seen in a newer,
more positive light? If anything, the opposite would
occur. People would resent both Native Americans
and their entire agenda because the protesters are
treading on sacred ground. For this is not about
employment discrimination, or civil rights. This is
about the national pastime.
Nicknames are as much a part of the tradition of
baseball as are peanuts and hot dogs. If the nick
name "Braves" is so offensive, why was it chosen
when the team was first organized in Boston? Or
why wasn't it changed when the club moved to Mil
waukee? Or even when the team moved for a third
time, to Atlanta? Political correctness seems to be
losing steam, so the movement supposedly has
found a new target in the sports world.
The entire issue is a giant nuisance to Joe Sports
Fan, who goes to a game to escape the outside world
and relax with the family. Politics is not supposed
to be included in the day's outing at the ballpark,
and justly so.

When people do the Tomahawk chop, the last
thing they are thinking about is, "I'm pretending
now to be an Indian warrior so I'll take out my axe
and chant." On the contrary, the Atlanta fans are
simply rooting for their team earnestly in hopes of
victory. Much like the USC fight song, the Chop
serves to rally the home team while pestering the
opposition ad infinitum.
The Portland Oregonian has even gone so far as
to refuse to refer to the Braves by their name, calling
them simply "Atlanta" or "the baseball club" when
recounting game summaries. The paper's policy also
extends to other nicknames which it finds offensive,
such as the NFL's Washington Redskins or the
NHL's Chicago Black Hawks. By doing so, the Ore
gonian is shirking its journalistic duty to report the
complete facts of the game, regardless of opinion.
Thankfully, other papers have not extended the Ore
gonian's foolishness to their sports sections.
The groups outside the stadium this year are a
lot smaller than last, probably because many
protesters have realized that there are larger con
cerns to be dealt with. Many Native Americans
even support the use of the Chop and the Braves
name, because it portrays a positive image of their
people, especially now that the Braves are a win
ning team.
When William and Mary college recently faced
pressure to change its Indian mascot, Nansemond
tribe Chief Earl "Running Deer" Bass stated, "I
will stand behind this symbol as long as I draw
breath," and the nickname remained.
The picketers have also received a lot less media
coverage, as much of the general public is tired of
hearing about this tiny problem when there are
more important things to worry about, such as
whether Tom Glavine can pitch on three days rest.
Just think what could happen if the Braves did
change their name as a result. Would atheists
object to the California "Angels," claiming that the
Angels exclude them because their name is reli
giously focused? Would groups gather en masse to
object to the glorification of oppressors that is
inherent in the nicknames "Pirates" and "Bucca
neers?" Would protectionists boycott stadiums that
use Mitsubishi Diamond Vision? When would it
end? Would the Stanford Cardinal be the last nick
name standing?
So if you're a Braves fan, do not feel guilty for
doing the Chop. If Ted Turner, Jane Fonda and for
mer President and Mrs. Carter can do it, you can
too. Just root for the home team, leave the politics
to the politicians, and make sure that the only thing
with the initials PC allowed into the stadium is the
Phoenix Cardinals.
