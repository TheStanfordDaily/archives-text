### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
The Stanford men's soccer team was
surprised yesterday by the University of
San Francisco, as the visiting Dons
played the Cardinal to a virtual stand
still in a game that ended in overtime, 1-
1.
Stanford's only goal of the contest
came off of a Ricky Goad assist to senior
forward Lance Killian, who rifled the
ball past the Don's goalkeeper for his
fourth goal of the season and his second
in as many games.
"Lance has really been coming
through for us when we need it," said
coach Colin Lindores.
"Usually he comes into the game
when one of the guys needs a rest. But

today I thought he deserved to start, and
he performed wonderfully. "
Although the Cardinal defense had
recorded three shutouts in its last four
games, it could not make their 1-0 lead
stand, as USF stormed back at the end
of the first half to tie the score on mid
fielder Brent Kirsten's goal, assisted
by their leading scorer, Greg Vanden
berg.
In the second half, Stanford had sev
eral opportunities to score the go-ahead
goal, but failed to convert on several
plays within the Don's penalty box.
Senior midfielder Jason Vanacour
brought the ball in close on three occa
sions, but USF's goalkeeper stifled his
attempts each time. In overtime, for
ward Robert Brophy centered a ball per
fectly for midfielder Jason Keyes, but

Keyes misread the play as the Dons
harmlessly cleared the ball out of the
backfield.

'The game was just plain
frustrating, no matter how
you look at it.'

In spite of a couple of miscues on
offense, the Cardinal dominated
throughout the match by outdistancing
the Dons in shots on goal by a margin of
17 to eight.
"I was rather disappointed today,

because we should have finished off the
game on a number of occasions," Lin
dores said. "We've got to work more on
executing and scoring whenever we get
the ball within the attacking zone."
Junior midfielder Goad added, "The
game was just plain frustrating, no
matter how you look at it. We knew
that we were the better team, and yet
they battled back to tie us and then
shut us out in the second half and in
the overtime."
Despite dropping their first game in a
week, Stanford (10-4-1, 4-1-0 in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
remains tied with first-place Washing
ton for the overall lead in the MPSF.
Since the USF game was non-confer
ence, it can only come back to haunt the
Cardinal if they end up in a dead heat for

the conference title. In that case, the
overall records will decide the champi
onship.
For now, the Cardinal is looking for
ward to the San Jose State match this
Friday, before they turn their attention
to the last conference game of the season
against a tough Washington ball club.
Both games will be crucial if Stanford
wants to capture the MPSF title and an
NCAA Tournament berth.
"Right now, we are still on a roll and
our confidence level continues to be
high," said senior midfielder and co-cap
tain Randy Mann. "I think we can put
USF behind us now and just concentrate
on our next two games. We have the best
team in the conference, and we should
go on to beat Washington and then take
the NCAA title."
