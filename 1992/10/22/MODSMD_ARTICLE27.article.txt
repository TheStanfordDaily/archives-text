# English Only? Not, says speaker

### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
James Crawford, editor of the book "Language
Loyalties" and a strong advocate of bilingual edu
cation, attacked the English Only movement as a
"thinly veiled anti-immigration movement" in a
talk at Kimball Hall last night.
Speaking to about 100 people in the dormito
ry's lounge, Crawford compared the movement's
tactics to "cultural genocide" and called for more
support of bilingual programs.
The English Only movement, which hopes to
make English the official language of the United
States, has surged in popularity in recent years.
Crawford said donations to the cause total
more than $45 million, and prominent figures
such as Whoopi Goldberg and Arnold
Schwartzenegger are among the contributors.
According to Crawford, an internal poll asking
the group's supporters why they donated money
found that 42 percent of the respondents agreed
with the statement, "I think Americans should
stand up to Hispanics who shouldn't be here."
"The mqjor problem is that people who support
these movements do not have enough knowledge
about the necessity of bilingual programs," Craw
ford said.

He pointed out that only one of three Ameri
cans is aware of the controversy surrounding this
issue. Almost all of the states have considered the
proposal that English be made the official lan
guage, and 17, including California, have passed it
into law, he added.
Crawford rejected the group's ideology, saying
that preserving different cultures is one of the
foundations of the United States.
"The notion that we have been an English
speaking nation all along is false," he said. "Even
in the early days of our country, support for other
languages and cultures was evident."
"Because of the ignorance of the general popu
lace to this problem," Crawford added, "people
don't understand how harmful legislation like
this can be."
He outlined how bilingual programs might
help the community. He explained that through
intelligent use of bilingual education, a student
will actually learn English better than one in an
English-only school.
"In the last 10 years, California went from hav
ing the strongest support of bilingual education to
none at all," he said, adding that organizations
like English Only must be stopped in order to
allow immigrants a chance for success in the
future.
