It flows like a river:
strong, deep & free
"A River Runs Through It," director Robert
Redford's new film, is an ode to a time passed
and a memorial to a prodigal son who never
found his way back home.
Based on the novel by Norman Maclean, the
film chronicles his relationship with his
younger brother, Paul. Norman, the academic,
pensive brother is played with an effective
thoughtfulness and brooding by Craig Sheffer.
However, it is Brad Pitt's portrayal of Paul,
the wayward brother, that consumes the screen
and the audience's attention.
Philippe Rousselot's cinematography is
breathtaking, fluid and graceful. Shot in Gal
latin, Mont., the film turns the outdoors into a
living force, which explains the concentration
on the river and fly-fishing. "I'll never leave
Montana" Paul tells Norman — a statement
amply justified by the expansive camera work.
The Maclean boys grow up in Missoula,
Mont., as sons of a Scottish Presbyterian min
ister who teaches them that there is "no clear
line between religion and fly fishing."
The first half of the film is tight and flows
well as it moves from the Macleans' childhood
to college years. Their childhood spent in the
wilds of the American northwest is as beautiful
as it is rough, and Norman and Paul learn the
value of toughness early on. But, as Norman
notes later, Paul was always the one willing to
take any risk, meet any challenge and fight any
fight.
The brothers reverse roles as Norman be
comes the introspective follower and Paul be
comes not only the leader of the pack, but the
self-assured charmer who loves women, gam
bling and, as always, fly-fishing.
The last portion of the film focuses on the
summer after Norman returns home from col
lege. While Norman searches for his future, all
Paul seems to find is trouble.
A pervading sense of melancholy that runs
adds depth and character to the story. Narrated
from Norman's point of view, the film suggests
unhappiness is inevitable, but the audience be
comes lost in the way of life shared by the
Macleans and the special bond between the
brothers and their father.
The second half of the film does not carry
over the same sense of continuity as the first
portion, and the film's length only makes the
suspense fatiguing. However, the acting is first

rate, which compensates for some of the se
quences that seem to drag.
Tom Skeritt brings a love and wit to his role
as Rev. Maclean. He ages convincingly, playing
a young father as well as a fading old man.
The big star to emerge from this film will un
doubtedly be Brad Pitt. Pitt, remembered as the
sweet-talking hustler from "Thelma and
Louise," effectually portrays Paul's complex
character.
When Norman tells Paul that he is going to
marry a local girl, Jessie (Emily Loyd), and
move to Chicago, Pitt masterfully lets pride,
jealousy and sadness play across his face at
once. The moment fine tunes the love of two
brothers which continues to reach across two
very divergent life paths and goals.
Redford's direction is impeccable and
brings to life not only the relationship of the
two brothers, but the beautiful, rugged envi
ronment in which they grew up.

Sad, sweet story
of dance and despair
Foreign films are like wine. You have to pay
attention to all the details: the mystery, the cul
ture, the hard-to-read lettering that makes you
wonder about the content.
And like wine, some films are dark and sour.
Others, however, are like "Danz6n" — sweet,
light and astonishingly subtle. It's an airy vin
tage for a cool and sunny afternoon. You'd have
to search cinematic cellars for a long time to
find something this delicate with a domestic
label. And fortunately, the subtitles are legible,
too.
Directed by Mexican filmmaker Maria No
varo, "Danz6n" is the story of a woman named
Julia (Maria Rojo) who reluctantly breaks out
of her working-class life in Mexico City.
Julia is a telephone operator, unmarried,
with a teenage daughter. With her co-workers,
she often goes dancing, always dancing with the
same man, Carmelo (Daniel Rergis).
Carmelo is a quiet, dapper fellow — "a real
gentleman," her friend says. But the only love
in Julia's relationship with him is in their
shared dedication to the danz6n, a stately,
waltz-like dance. In fact, Julia hardly knows
him.
When Carmelo disappears, though, Julia
despairs, refusing other partners. She claims
she is getting out of practice. She loses her cool
at work.
Finally, in a fabulously funny scene, the usu

ally matter-of-fact Julia announces — and ra
tionalizes and sputters and justifies — her deci
sion to leave town and search for Carmelo.
Rojo plays Julia well, somehow managing to
convey both her fragility and her wonderful
equilibrium. The contrast between Julia's un
conscious, confident femininity and her trans
vestite friend Susy's (Tito Vasconcelos) enthu
siastic imitation makes Julia all the more ad
mirable.
The movie is strongest in its details, like the
gentle jokes between Julia and her friends and
songs which float in the air just when the time
is right. It flows, showing no scars from cutting
rooms or missed deadlines. Visually, it's amaz
ingly sharp and glows with natural color. Such
skill is made even more remarkable by the fact
that Danz6n is only Novaro's sophomore di
rectorial effort.
Music also contributes to the success of
"Danz6n." Especially at the beginning, the
soundtrack percolates with many sad, sweet
songs, driven by brass and drums, which don't
require acquired tastes to enjoy.
The only sour note, paradoxically, is the
movie's pervasive sweetness. Julia inspires such
loyalty in her new friends that it seems a bit like
wish fulfillment. And her decisions come at lit
tle personal cost. The movie might linger
longer on the mind with a little more bitter
sweet. But then again, Novaro did intend
"Danz6n" to be a comedy.
Bright and atmospheric, "Danz6n" is like a
perfect dessert wine. It sparkles, and leaves just
the faintest fragrant aftertaste.
