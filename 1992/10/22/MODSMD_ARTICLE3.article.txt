# Scientists progress with cancer vaccine
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Stanford researchers today an
nounced major progress in the at
tempt to create a vaccine against
some forms of cancer.
A team from the School of Med
icine has taken cells from patients
with B-cell lymphoma, a cancer of
the immune system, and geneti
cally engineered them to create a
vaccine that seems to be working.
In a study of nine patients who
had forms of B-cell lymphoma in
remission after chemotherapy,
the vaccine successfully kept the
cancer from returning to seven of
the nine patients.
In addition, the researchers re
ported that two of the nine pa

tients studied had measurable
cancers that were sent into remis
sion by the vaccine.
The study appears in today's
issue of The New England Journal
of Medicine.
"We had no reason to expect
that" remission, said Oncology
Prof. Ronald Levy, director of the
study. "Not all the patients have
made responses . . . but we're
working to where all of them will."
"The results provide a ray of
hope for a therapeutic vaccine
against B-cell lymphoma, a neo
plasm that is fairly common and
often refractory to current thera
py," wrote Dr. Robert Schwartz of
the New England Medical Center
in an accompanying editorial.
According to Levy, the B-cell
works in the body's immune sys
tem to help build antibodies. B
cell lymphoma, the cancer of
these cells, affects about 10,000
new people each year.
Levy said a portion of every B
cell — called a receptor — is
unique to that cell. Thus, when
the cells are taken from the tumor
and turned into the vaccine, they
will identify only with the cancer
ous B-cells that have similar
receptors.
"It gives us a special chance to
do something that directs itself
toward the tumor," Levy said.

The vaccine is then injected
into patients who have already
had their B-cell lymphomas sent
into remission through
chemotherapy. Thus, unlike the
polio vaccine, which prevents the
disease from occurring, the can
cer vaccine prevents the disease
from recurring.
Genetic engineering of the can
cerous cells allows the body to rec
ognize them as foreign when they
are re-injected, Levy said.
The body's immune system
then realizes the tumor also
shouldn't be there and builds up
antibodies against the cancer
which it previously saw as natu
ral, not foreign, he explained.
Levy said that while the initial
study was encouraging, "we really
need to go further to show that it
does people any good."

But, he said, further studies of
the vaccine are continuing, and
within two or three years the vac
cine would ideally help 100 per
cent of the patients who use it.
"Right now, the chemotherapy
treatments we have are very suc
cessful in the short run, but it
only cures about 50 percent of the
cases," Levy said.
Levy said he hoped the tech
nology developed would eventual
ly lead to vaccines for other can
cers, including breast, colon and
lung cancer. While these cancer
cells don't have receptors, Levy
said the tumors do produce
unique chemicals.
"I think we are going to learn
things .. . that can be applied to
other kinds of tumors that don't
have a unique handle on them,"
Levy said.
