Stanford researchers today an
nounced major progress in the at
tempt to create a vaccine against
some forms of cancer.
A team from the School of Med
icine has taken cells from patients
with B-cell lymphoma, a cancer of
the immune system, and geneti
cally engineered them to create a
vaccine that seems to be working.
In a study of nine patients who
had forms of B-cell lymphoma in
remission after chemotherapy,
the vaccine successfully kept the
cancer from returning to seven of
the nine patients.
In addition, the researchers re
ported that two of the nine pa

tients studied had measurable
cancers that were sent into remis
sion by the vaccine.
The study appears in today's
issue of The New England Journal
of Medicine.
"We had no reason to expect
that" remission, said Oncology
Prof. Ronald Levy, director of the
study. "Not all the patients have
made responses . . . but we're
working to where all of them will."
"The results provide a ray of
hope for a therapeutic vaccine
against B-cell lymphoma, a neo
plasm that is fairly common and
often refractory to current thera
py," wrote Dr. Robert Schwartz of
the New England Medical Center
