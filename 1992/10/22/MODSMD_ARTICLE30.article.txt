'Jimmy Dean, Jimmy
Dean' comes back
to play in San Jose
It takes a lot of guts for a man to write a play
about six women. It takes even more guts to
shove them in a small, nearly-abandoned town
in Texas. Even more to make them talk about
their breasts.
The San Jose Stage's revival of Ed Graczyk's
"Come Back to the 5 and Dime, Jimmy Dean,
Jimmy Dean" doesn't correct any of the prob
lems in the more than 15-year old script. But it
doesn't take away any of it's power either.
The power comes from Graczyk's portrayal
of how men view and treat women, and, subse
quently, how they wind up treating and emas

culating other men. If exception can be taken
against the realism of his portrait of women, it
can be justified by the brilliant depiction of
women as men see them.
The play centers around the Disciples of
James Dean, who meet back at the local five and
dime on the 20th anniversary of Dean's fatal
automobile accident. The filming of Dean's
film "Giant," just miles outside of their tiny
town, is the focal point, not of the plot, but of
the characters' lives — particularly Mona, an
extra in the movie and the self-proclaimed
mother of Dean's child.
Rick Singleton, director of the San Jose
Stage's acclaimed three year run of "Angry
Housewives" keeps painstakingly close to
Robert Altman's original Broadway produc
tion and movie-adaptation. The impressive set,
paints a stylistic realism which pulls no punch
es just like the script.
And Singleton, unapologetically following
the style of Graczyk's script in his staging, aids
in the sin of hitting the audience over the head
with the themes.

By the time the minor
characters chirp in with
their personal traumas,
you want to kick them out
of the group-therapy ses
sion and get back to
watching the three main
characters squirm.

At points, the play feels as patronizing and
paternalistic as a George Bush lecture. When
Mona finally overcomes her childhood illu
sions, Singleton has the young Mona grab her
suitcase and wave goodbye to her older self; it
almost makes you want to strangle him.
But, in San Jose, this kind of directing may
make a lot of sense.
The small, intimate theater is great — the
people's feet in the front row are on the stage —
but the audience is not. They laugh at all the
wrong parts, reasoning that if the characters on
stage find a line funny enough to laugh at, then
it must be funny. But in a play where the char
acters are laughing out of nervousness and
pain, that kind of audience can get annoying.
The other main fault of the powerful and
gripping script is that it tries to do too much.
Within this one-and-a-half-hour meeting, every
one of the characters is coming to an epiphany
about some unfulfilled hole in their life. By the
time the minor characters chirp in with their
personal traumas, you want to kick them out of
the group-therapy session and get back to
watching the three main characters squirm.
The acting, for the most part, is impressive,
with the unassuming Kimily Conkle — who,
along with two of the other actresses, is repris
ing her role from the original production —
shining more brightly than the others as the
quiet, unassuming Edna Louise.
Kathryn Howell does an impressive job as
Mona, though her incessant pacing quickly be
comes more a distracting element than a con
vincing character trait. Glenys Davidson does
an adequate job with a difficult liminal charac
ter, making Joanne believable, likeable and, at
points, even sympathetic.
The revival runs until Nov. 1 .Tickets are $ 13
for students on weekdays and Sundays, $15 for
Friday and Saturday nights.

Hits and misses: 'Les
Miz' music strong but
rich plot too diluted
Captivating characters, poignant song and
dark, Gothic sets combine to make "Les Mis
erables" the musical standard it has become.
The popular Tony award-winning musical,
based on Victor Hugo's novel about France's
post-revolutionary underclass, will play at the
Curran Theatre in San Francisco through Nov.
22.
The musical relates the story of the life of
Jean Valjean, a fugitive who attempts to start a
new life for himself amidst the poverty and
chaotic politics of his home country.
Valjean (Dave Clemmons) spends his life
trying to escape the clutches of Inspector
Javert, his sworn enemy who sees Valjean as a
criminal even though his only crime was steal
ing to feed his family.
Through Clemmons' incredible talents for
acting and music — exhibited in such riveting
songs as "Who am I?" — Valjean captures the
sympathies of both the audience and the other
characters.
Several memorable performances provide
support and context for Valjean's story. Jill
Geddes' portrayal of Fantine, for example,
brings insight into the plight of the impover
ished mother.
While her moving performance of "I
Dreamed a Dream," begins by describing her
hopes for a happier life, it ends in despair as she
concludes with the line, "My life has killed the
dream I dream."
Famine's abused orphan daughter, young
Cosette (Jamie Cronin), also evokes pity and
inspires hope as she hauntingly sings, about
castles in the clouds where no one cries.
However, the bumbling, bickering M. and
Mme. (J.P. Dougherty and Gina
Ferrall) add a balanced dose of humor to the
story line.
Their appearance alone provides comic re
lief to the show. In one scene, they arrive at a
party dressed as royalty. Mme. Thdnardier
wears a frilly purple and gold dress and match
ing parasol that would make French designers
cry. Her husband complements her appropri
ately in a multi-colored tuxedo.
The song "Master of the House" parodies
the mournhil "I Dreamed a Dream." Mme.
Th£nardier looks at her less-than-princelike
husband and sings, "I used to dream I'd meet a
prince/ Have you seen what's happened to me
since?"
The couple's hilarious antics and songs

starkly contrast the seemingly endless misery of
the other characters. But even for the Th£-
nardiers, blatant and raw humor is only a last
resort to cope with a comfortless world.
This world is built upon sparse rotating sets
that both create the dark, despairing mood and
propel the plot is fluid, continuous action.
The action is aided through realistic effects:
The audience can smell the smoke and hear the
gunshots of the battle scenes — and the musi
cal does not spare the audience the sight of
blood and death.
Although the entire production is com
pelling, the depth of some characters is lost in
the complicated, epic plot.
Javert (Chuck Wagner) serves only as a rigid
contrast to Valjean. Although their tense inter
actions are skillfully executed and exciting to
watch, Javert seems to lack a clear motivation
outside of the context of their rivalry.
The primary romance of the play also suffers
from a lack of character development. Neither
Cosette's nor Marius' personality is outlined,
except in relation to each other. Cosette
(Tamra Hayden) and Marius (Ron Sharpe) fall
in love instantly and proceed in a romance that
leaves an aftertaste.
The musical eliminates key information by
condensing Hugo's original mammoth novel
into a period of about three hours. So reading
the plot synopsis prior to viewing the show is a
good idea, and does not detract from the emo
tional experience of an amazing visual and mu
sical spectacle.
A final word of advice: Don't forget the
Kleenex.

Guthrie's folk tunes
bring Dust Bowl to life
"American Song," a musical tribute to folk
singer Woody Guthrie, offers a refreshing alter
native to glitzy Broadway musicals. A talented
five-member cast and three musicians perform
a series of scenes portraying the lives of the mi
grant workers of the '30s.
As one of the 50,000 "Okies" that travelled
across America to the West, Guthrie experi
enced firsthand the plight of the displaced
workers. His music, prose and poetry vividly
depict the harshness of the Depression and the
struggles and joys of the people.
Of Guthrie's 1,000-song repertoire, "Amer
ican Song" concentrates on classic tunes like
"This Land Is Your Land" and "Nine Hundred
Miles."
The revue embarks on its musical journey
on a large plain, where a dust storm and a train
heading West evoke the feel of migration. Slide

images of workers, sounds of an approaching
thunderstorm and streaks of lightning make
the scene hauntingly realistic.
One of the memorable moments of the jour
ney occurs on a train heading West, as three
freezing migrant workers sing the "Dust Bowl
Refugee" as one offers the others his coat. The
scene and music poignantly suggest hope dur
ing difficult times, as people come together to
help each other survive.
The multi-gifted three-men orchestra
brings Guthrie's folkloric musical style alive
with a blend of fiddle, banjo, mandolin, guitar
and harmonica.
Dramatic lighting reinforces the mood of
uncertainty among the migrant workers.
Cracks in the walls cast eerie shadows. At one
point darkness envelops all but a solitary singer
lit from behind.
Since its world premier at the American
Stage Festival in 1988, the show has enjoyed
success nationwide, traveling to over 30 cities
across the country.
Co-produced by Berkeley Repertory The
atre, "American Song" is playing at the Mont
gomery Theater in downtown San Jose. Stu
dent tickets ($8) are available through the San
Jose Repertory Box Office, (408) 291-2255.
