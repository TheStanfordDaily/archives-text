'Jimmy Dean, Jimmy
Dean' comes back
to play in San Jose
It takes a lot of guts for a man to write a play
about six women. It takes even more guts to
shove them in a small, nearly-abandoned town
in Texas. Even more to make them talk about
their breasts.
The San Jose Stage's revival of Ed Graczyk's
"Come Back to the 5 and Dime, Jimmy Dean,
Jimmy Dean" doesn't correct any of the prob
lems in the more than 15-year old script. But it
doesn't take away any of it's power either.
The power comes from Graczyk's portrayal
of how men view and treat women, and, subse
quently, how they wind up treating and emas

culating other men. If exception can be taken
against the realism of his portrait of women, it
can be justified by the brilliant depiction of
women as men see them.
The play centers around the Disciples of
James Dean, who meet back at the local five and
dime on the 20th anniversary of Dean's fatal
automobile accident. The filming of Dean's
film "Giant," just miles outside of their tiny
town, is the focal point, not of the plot, but of
the characters' lives — particularly Mona, an
extra in the movie and the self-proclaimed
mother of Dean's child.
Rick Singleton, director of the San Jose
Stage's acclaimed three year run of "Angry
Housewives" keeps painstakingly close to
Robert Altman's original Broadway produc
tion and movie-adaptation. The impressive set,
paints a stylistic realism which pulls no punch
es just like the script.
And Singleton, unapologetically following
the style of Graczyk's script in his staging, aids
in the sin of hitting the audience over the head
with the themes.

By the time the minor
characters chirp in with
their personal traumas,
you want to kick them out
of the group-therapy ses
sion and get back to
watching the three main
characters squirm.

At points, the play feels as patronizing and
paternalistic as a George Bush lecture. When
Mona finally overcomes her childhood illu
sions, Singleton has the young Mona grab her
suitcase and wave goodbye to her older self; it
almost makes you want to strangle him.
But, in San Jose, this kind of directing may
make a lot of sense.
The small, intimate theater is great — the
people's feet in the front row are on the stage —
but the audience is not. They laugh at all the
wrong parts, reasoning that if the characters on
stage find a line funny enough to laugh at, then
it must be funny. But in a play where the char
acters are laughing out of nervousness and
pain, that kind of audience can get annoying.
The other main fault of the powerful and
gripping script is that it tries to do too much.
Within this one-and-a-half-hour meeting, every
one of the characters is coming to an epiphany
about some unfulfilled hole in their life. By the
time the minor characters chirp in with their
personal traumas, you want to kick them out of
the group-therapy session and get back to
watching the three main characters squirm.
The acting, for the most part, is impressive,
with the unassuming Kimily Conkle — who,
along with two of the other actresses, is repris
ing her role from the original production —
shining more brightly than the others as the
quiet, unassuming Edna Louise.
Kathryn Howell does an impressive job as
Mona, though her incessant pacing quickly be
comes more a distracting element than a con
vincing character trait. Glenys Davidson does
an adequate job with a difficult liminal charac
ter, making Joanne believable, likeable and, at
points, even sympathetic.
The revival runs until Nov. 1 .Tickets are $ 13
for students on weekdays and Sundays, $15 for
Friday and Saturday nights.
