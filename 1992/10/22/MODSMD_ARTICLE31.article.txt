Native musicians
share their wealth
A combination of songs, dances, chants,
drums and native rituals contribute to the di
verse performances of the California Genera
tions.
The tour of California Generations was or
ganized by California Presenters, a unique or
ganization that has brought together folk and
cultural events such as Masters of the Folk Vio
lin and Masters of the Steel String Guitar.
For this production they have extensively
sought out renowned artists in the California
region in order to link together the cultures,
communities and arts of the native, ethnic and
immigrant groups that make up California.
Works from Mexican-American, Asian, Na
tive-Californian, African-Diaspora, Anglo-
American and Pacific-Islanders combine to
give the audience a rare portrait of Californian
society.
While the performers are assembled to dis
play cultural diversity, they offer unique enter

tainment as well. In their upcoming perfor
mance at Memorial Auditorium nine groups
will be featured. The show presents everything
from the cowboy poetry of Jesse Smith to the
Caribbean coastal drumming of the Garifuna
people from Belize.
Master Ge Xiong will perform a Hmong rit
ual with his students where they play the"qeej,"
a complex bamboo pipe, while dancing and
doing acrobatics all at the same time. Sissy Kaio
and her family will demonstrate a traditional
ancient hula dance, the Hula Kahiko, which
serves as a tribute to the Polynesian volcanic
gods.
Sponsored by the Lively Arts at Stanford, the
show will take place Oct. 24 at Memorial Audi
torium. Tickets cost between $16 and $22 ($3
student discount) and are available at Tresid
der.

Sacred sounds will fill
Mem Chu when Dutch
ensemble sings
For a cappella lovers who haven't yet seen
the renovated Memorial Church, the Lively
Arts at Stanford presents the perfect opportu
nity. Dutch vocal ensemble Cappella Pratensis
will grace the church with its premiere perfor
mance.
Founded in the Netherlands in 1987, Cap
pella Pratensis is comprised of ten vocalists led
by Dr. Rebecca Stewart, a Stanford University
alumnus now teaching at the Brabants Conser
vatorium in Tilburg.
Specializing in singing 15th and 16th centu
ry polyphony of the "Netherlandish" tradition,
the ensemble makes authenticity its main
thrust.
The group gives the majority of its perfor
mances in churches, where the acoustic and
spiritual ambience are best able to "allow the
music to breathe freely," says Stewart. She says
church acoustics allow the ensemble "to realize
the raison d'etre for its existence, namely exalt
ing the spirits of those who hear it."
Singing from a choir book placed upon a
large music stand, the ensemble feels that the
proximity allows each singer "to respond intel-
