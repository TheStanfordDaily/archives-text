Best of the Talking
Heads overwhelms
Some things work better in
smaller packages.
Although they're songs you
know and love and tried to sing
until discovering you had no idea
what the lyrics meant, after 33 of
them, you want to kill David Byrne.
If you're a Talking Heads fan,
you're better off buying the albums,
even though the compact discs are
overpriced. The albums each have a
distinctive flavor, which they lose in
translation onto "Sand in the Vase
line: Popular Favorites" the two
disc set you've all been waiting for.
For those of you who are only
initiated into the Heads in the most
limited way, this might be your easy
way out — maybe not what David
Byrne would want you to do, but
probably just fine with his agent.
All the popular favorites are
there. There's no opportunity for
the casual fan to ask, "Where's that
take-off on 'Big Yellow Taxi'?" —
it's there. "That Naive Melody
song?" it's there. They didn't even
miss "Sax and Violins," the tune
from the soundtrack of Wim Wen
der's "Until the End of the World."
With a programmable CD play
er, this is a good thing. Without
one, it can get annoying. Byrne's
voice grates after too many songs —
especially combinations that
weren't ever meant to float, meld or
crash into each other.
Ordering the songs chronologi
cally is more intellectually accept
able than ordering them so they ar

tificially mesh or so all the big hits
are at the beginning; the band's
progression is displayed in a way
which is harder to observe when lis
tening to the full albums.
But by speeding up the course of
time, things seem out of place. You
want to skip right to "Psycho Killer"
and then over "No Compassion"
straight to "Take Me to the River."
The less popular, less favorite songs
sneak to the back of the class, while
the hits lose something when taken
out of their rightful seats.
Three new songs were included
on the album, in order to give the
hardcore fans a reason to repur
chase songs they already have. All
three are good, and destined to get
air-play, but none are reason
enough to buy the album.
Yes, it's a great collection of an
incredibly inventive band, and dis
appoints none by leaving out a great
song. But, given the choice, I'd still
rather listen to "Little Creatures" all
the way through.

No masterpieces
or pieces of 'Cake'
for Mudhoney
Greasy-headed, flannel-shirted,
scream-yell-puke-I-dare-you-to
t ry-and -understand -my-lyrics
my-libido-a-mosquito.
It's the "big thing."
It's the Seattle sound.
And Mudhoney is its latest am
bassador.
Mudhoney's latest release,
"Piece of Cake," expands the Nir
vana/Pearl Jam/Soundgarden style.
Although it doesn't break any new
ground, the album's ultra-distort
ed, bad-amp tunes add a grittier
tinge to the Northwestern trend.
Some skeptics might find it
easy to write off Mudhoney —
which makes its major label debut
with "Piece of Cake" — as yet an
other mutated corporate rock
baby. But if you ignore Reprise's
attempt to capitalize on the lucra
tive suburbanite fad, what you get
is an ugly, loud and annoyingly
crisp sound.
"Piece of Cake" opens with a
twisted techno-imitation track that
sports the "Screw you" attitude that
loves to bury itself in alternative
music.
Mudhoney's feedback and dis
tortion immediately shout at you,
even before lead singer Mark Arm
does. The result is a raw-meat
sound that is more varied than the
guitar-based Nirvana, but lacks the
more refined, glossiness of Pearl
Jam and Soundgarden — or Tem
ple of the Dog, for that matter.
Mudhoney is at their best during
their four, half-minute musical
tracks filled with fart noises and
fuzzed-up psychedelia.
However, much of "Piece of
Cake" is filled with extended musi
cal riffs that don't stray too far from
the norm. With songs like "No End
in Sight" — which could be record
ed by almost any hard rock band —
the group evades boredom by the
hairs of their marimbas, banjos and

organs.
Mudhoney's lyrical style is basic
but has potential: "No time like the
present to get ripped apart/ Got this
burning desire aim it straight for
your heart Can't breathe 'til I
suck you dry," yells Arm on "Suck
You Dry." And "I'm Spun" is your
typical angst ditty that's stylistically
nifty, but topically dead.
Don't take this wrong — Mud
honey's better than average, but
still lacks shazam.

Outside of the Seattle scene,
Mudhoney is but one among a
genre of post-punk, pissed-off
rockers.
The Replacements, Husker Dti,
Sonic Youth and a rusty truck-load
of others came around long before
Mudhoney's 1988 Sub Pop debut,
"Superfuzz Bigmuff." The band's
sound differs slightly from that
work, but they defined what Mud
honey does.
Arm's vocals are atypical and

have a household cleaner-sniffing
quality, especially in "Acetone."
But Arm lacks the power and emo
tional intensity of Pearl Jam's Eddie
Vedder and doesn't charm quite
like Dinosaur Jr's J. Mascis — who
has the three-legged, toothless dog
howl down to an art form.
Mudhoney's "Piece of Cake" is
good, but not good enough to live
up to the old, boring connotations
of its title.

No masterpieces
or pieces of 'Cake'
for Mudhoney
Greasy-headed, flannel-shirted,
scream-yell-puke-I-dare-you-to
t ry-and -understand -my-lyrics
my-libido-a-mosquito.
It's the "big thing."
It's the Seattle sound.
And Mudhoney is its latest am
bassador.
Mudhoney's latest release,
"Piece of Cake," expands the Nir
vana/Pearl Jam/Soundgarden style.
Although it doesn't break any new
ground, the album's ultra-distort
ed, bad-amp tunes add a grittier
tinge to the Northwestern trend.
Some skeptics might find it
easy to write off Mudhoney —
which makes its major label debut
with "Piece of Cake" — as yet an
other mutated corporate rock
baby. But if you ignore Reprise's
attempt to capitalize on the lucra
tive suburbanite fad, what you get
is an ugly, loud and annoyingly
crisp sound.
"Piece of Cake" opens with a
twisted techno-imitation track that
sports the "Screw you" attitude that
loves to bury itself in alternative
music.
Mudhoney's feedback and dis
tortion immediately shout at you,
even before lead singer Mark Arm
does. The result is a raw-meat
sound that is more varied than the
guitar-based Nirvana, but lacks the
more refined, glossiness of Pearl
Jam and Soundgarden — or Tem
ple of the Dog, for that matter.
Mudhoney is at their best during
their four, half-minute musical
tracks filled with fart noises and
fuzzed-up psychedelia.
However, much of "Piece of
Cake" is filled with extended musi
cal riffs that don't stray too far from
the norm. With songs like "No End
in Sight" — which could be record
ed by almost any hard rock band —
the group evades boredom by the
hairs of their marimbas, banjos and

organs.
Mudhoney's lyrical style is basic
but has potential: "No time like the
present to get ripped apart/ Got this
burning desire aim it straight for
your heart Can't breathe 'til I
suck you dry," yells Arm on "Suck
You Dry." And "I'm Spun" is your
typical angst ditty that's stylistically
nifty, but topically dead.
Don't take this wrong — Mud
honey's better than average, but
still lacks shazam.

Outside of the Seattle scene,
Mudhoney is but one among a
genre of post-punk, pissed-off
rockers.
The Replacements, Husker Dti,
Sonic Youth and a rusty truck-load
of others came around long before
Mudhoney's 1988 Sub Pop debut,
"Superfuzz Bigmuff." The band's
sound differs slightly from that
work, but they defined what Mud
honey does.
Arm's vocals are atypical and

have a household cleaner-sniffing
quality, especially in "Acetone."
But Arm lacks the power and emo
tional intensity of Pearl Jam's Eddie
Vedder and doesn't charm quite
like Dinosaur Jr's J. Mascis — who
has the three-legged, toothless dog
howl down to an art form.
Mudhoney's "Piece of Cake" is
good, but not good enough to live
up to the old, boring connotations
of its title.

Best of the Talking
Heads overwhelms
Some things work better in
smaller packages.
Although they're songs you
know and love and tried to sing
until discovering you had no idea
what the lyrics meant, after 33 of
them, you want to kill David Byrne.
If you're a Talking Heads fan,
you're better off buying the albums,
even though the compact discs are
overpriced. The albums each have a
distinctive flavor, which they lose in
translation onto "Sand in the Vase
line: Popular Favorites" the two
disc set you've all been waiting for.
For those of you who are only
initiated into the Heads in the most
limited way, this might be your easy
way out — maybe not what David
Byrne would want you to do, but
probably just fine with his agent.
All the popular favorites are
there. There's no opportunity for
the casual fan to ask, "Where's that
take-off on 'Big Yellow Taxi'?" —
it's there. "That Naive Melody
song?" it's there. They didn't even
miss "Sax and Violins," the tune
from the soundtrack of Wim Wen
der's "Until the End of the World."
With a programmable CD play
er, this is a good thing. Without
one, it can get annoying. Byrne's
voice grates after too many songs —
especially combinations that
weren't ever meant to float, meld or
crash into each other.
Ordering the songs chronologi
cally is more intellectually accept
able than ordering them so they ar

tificially mesh or so all the big hits
are at the beginning; the band's
progression is displayed in a way
which is harder to observe when lis
tening to the full albums.
But by speeding up the course of
time, things seem out of place. You
want to skip right to "Psycho Killer"
and then over "No Compassion"
straight to "Take Me to the River."
The less popular, less favorite songs
sneak to the back of the class, while
the hits lose something when taken
out of their rightful seats.

chase songs they already have. All
