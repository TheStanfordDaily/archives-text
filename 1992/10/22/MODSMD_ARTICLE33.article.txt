# Living his Dream
## Stanford grad Cliff Goldmacher cuts an 'extremely independent' album 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
While Def Leppard and L.L. Cool J were
being painfully unplugged by the often cruel
folks at MTV, Stanford grad Cliff Goldmacher
decided to save everyone some time and trouble
and do it himself.
When Goldmacher left Stanford two years
ago, he also left behind the folk-duo "Third and
Beale." With the Beale-half of the duo gone to
Law School, Goldmacher has made a go at
singing — using only an acoustic guitar, har
monica, keyboard and a barely noticeable bit of
drum machine to back up him up on his first
solo album, "Songs from the Oasis".
The Oasis of which the GAPpcd, topsidered
Goldmacher speaks — far from the hardcore,
steelbooted bar nf Garth Brooks lore — is a
friendly little sports pub in yuppified Palo Alto.
It's also the bar over which Goldmacher has
been living since his return to the Bay area last
year.
Although he said he'd never been there dur
ing his four years on campus, he has become in
timately enough acquainted with the Oasis to
capture its — and Stanford's — essence without
letting his music distance those who arc unfa
miliar with either.
The album hooks you in with a catchy song
about the very pub whose parking lot Gold
macher poses next to on the album cover. "Ode
to the O," in defiance to the rest of the slow,
folksy and sometimes morose album, is a play
ful country blues tune, which Goldmacher de
scribes as "lyrics with a pretty predictable
melody."
The simple, clever lyrics — replete with the
prerequisite "fella"sand "or nothin"s — de
scribe the pseudo-hickish place "where they
carve on tables and chairs." But even in this
song, his lyrics betray Goldmacher's Stan
fordized sensibilities and humor with phrases
like "the dangerous mixture of beer and male
bonding" and the Spinal Tap-inspired "1 can
play rock music with the volume on 11 / And the
only one it bothers is me."
The rest of the album takes a turn for the se
rious. "Legacy," a song used in a video for Stan
ford recruiting, plays like a camp song for grad

uation night — a Kumbaya for the twentysome
thing generation: "Drifting along looking for
something/ To fill up this hole in my life/ Too
old to go and live with my family/ And too
young to look for a wife."
Goldmacher's compositions could, in fact,
be sung "Circle Game"- style in front of a camp
fire, or successfully serenaded to a frosh woman.
Especially the softlit, Fellini-free "La Belle Vie,"
which comes with a stanza and a half of roman
tic French lines installed at no extra charge.
The backup vocals, performed by several ex-
Mendicants, are prominent throughout the

album, adding to the rich sound of what Gold
macher called "an extremely independent pro
duction." The recording and pressing of 1,500
copies of the ADD disc were financed through
money he earned playing in cafcs during a year
he spent in France, and "some pretty big loans"
he was able to pull.
Still avoiding the law school he put off more
than two years ago, Goldmacher has financed
his Oasis-style life through savings, occasional
gigs in San Francisco and Oakland and money
from the $2 cover that Cafe Montmartre now
charges for his regular Saturday night shows.

Concentrating his performances more on his
own music and less on the classic rock staples
which used to constitute the majority of his live
performances, Goldmacher said playing covers
distanced him from the audience.
"I think before it was kind of a kick to be
singing in front of people. But, the thing is, it's
easy to make people cheer and clap when they
know and like the song. People would walk up
to me and say, 'I really liked that Paul Simon
song.' And 1 was like, 'That's great, but I didn't
write that.'"
When Goldmacher does play covers, which
make up about 30 percent of his show, he plays
songs which are newer and more closely aligned
with his style of songwriting — artists like
Shawn Colvin and Lyle Lovett.
"The two songs acoustic guitarists come to
dread are 'American Pie' and 'Brown Eyed
girl.'"
But although Goldmacher may be sick of
playing "The Boxer," folk rock is deeply rooted
in his music. He's what the kids listening to the
nihilistic Seattle grunge claim is the last thing
this world needs: another folksinger.
In fact, the album is being sold in, among
other locations, Tower's folk section — seem
ingly appropriate, but deceptively far from the
Eagles and Joni Mitchell albums to which his
music pays homage.
"Songs from the Oasis" oozes Coffee House
and hints at the blues we fear will come with
graduation. The similarities between living in a
bar just a couple of blocks from your old col
lege stomping grounds and going back to "live
with my family," as Goldmacher says on the
album, become clear through the plaintive folk
songs.
But in the same respect, the album reflects
the hopes that we have tucked away: to throw
away our political science degrees, play hookey
on LSAT day and record an album with our a
cappella friends.
If everyone at Stanford made an album and
we all went out and bought it, we'd all be rich.
Check the math yourself.

live tomorrow at the Stanford Bookstore 1-3

nihilistic Seattle grunge claim is the last thing
this world needs: another folksinger.
In fact, the album is being sold in, among
other locations, Tower's folk section — seem
ingly appropriate, but deceptively far from the
Eagles and Joni Mitchell albums to which his
music pays homage.
"Songs from the Oasis" oozes Coffee House
and hints at the blues we fear will come with
graduation. The similarities between living in a
bar just a couple of blocks from your old col
lege stomping grounds and going back to "live
with my family," as Goldmacher says on the
album, become clear through the plaintive folk
songs.
But in the same respect, the album reflects
the hopes that we have tucked away: to throw
away our political science degrees, play hookey
on LSAT day and record an album with our a
cappella friends.
If everyone at Stanford made an album and
we all went out and bought it, we'd all be rich.
Check the math yourself.

A guitar and a place to hang out — that's all that Cliff Goldmacher seems to need.
While Def Leppard and L.L. Cool J were
being painfully unplugged by the often cruel
folks at MTV, Stanford grad Cliff Goldmacher
decided to save everyone some time and trouble
and do it himself.
When Goldmacher left Stanford two years
ago, he also left behind the folk-duo "Third and
Beale." With the Beale-half of the duo gone to
Law School, Goldmacher has made a go at
singing — using only an acoustic guitar, har
monica, keyboard and a barely noticeable bit of
drum machine to back up him up on his first
solo album, "Songs from the Oasis".
The Oasis of which the GAPpcd, topsidered
Goldmacher speaks — far from the hardcore,
steelbooted bar nf Garth Brooks lore — is a
friendly little sports pub in yuppified Palo Alto.
It's also the bar over which Goldmacher has
been living since his return to the Bay area last
year.
Although he said he'd never been there dur
ing his four years on campus, he has become in
timately enough acquainted with the Oasis to
capture its — and Stanford's — essence without
letting his music distance those who arc unfa
miliar with either.
The album hooks you in with a catchy song
about the very pub whose parking lot Gold
macher poses next to on the album cover. "Ode
to the O," in defiance to the rest of the slow,
folksy and sometimes morose album, is a play
ful country blues tune, which Goldmacher de
scribes as "lyrics with a pretty predictable
melody."
The simple, clever lyrics — replete with the
prerequisite "fella"sand "or nothin"s — de
scribe the pseudo-hickish place "where they
carve on tables and chairs." But even in this
song, his lyrics betray Goldmacher's Stan
fordized sensibilities and humor with phrases
like "the dangerous mixture of beer and male
bonding" and the Spinal Tap-inspired "1 can
play rock music with the volume on 11 / And the
only one it bothers is me."
The rest of the album takes a turn for the se
rious. "Legacy," a song used in a video for Stan
ford recruiting, plays like a camp song for grad

uation night — a Kumbaya for the twentysome
thing generation: "Drifting along looking for
something/ To fill up this hole in my life/ Too
old to go and live with my family/ And too
young to look for a wife."
Goldmacher's compositions could, in fact,
be sung "Circle Game"- style in front of a camp
fire, or successfully serenaded to a frosh woman.
Especially the softlit, Fellini-free "La Belle Vie,"
which comes with a stanza and a half of roman
tic French lines installed at no extra charge.
The backup vocals, performed by several ex-
Mendicants, are prominent throughout the

album, adding to the rich sound of what Gold
macher called "an extremely independent pro
duction." The recording and pressing of 1,500
copies of the ADD disc were financed through
money he earned playing in cafcs during a year
he spent in France, and "some pretty big loans"
he was able to pull.
Still avoiding the law school he put off more
than two years ago, Goldmacher has financed
his Oasis-style life through savings, occasional
gigs in San Francisco and Oakland and money
from the $2 cover that Cafe Montmartre now
charges for his regular Saturday night shows.

Concentrating his performances more on his
own music and less on the classic rock staples
which used to constitute the majority of his live
performances, Goldmacher said playing covers
distanced him from the audience.
"I think before it was kind of a kick to be
singing in front of people. But, the thing is, it's
easy to make people cheer and clap when they
know and like the song. People would walk up
to me and say, 'I really liked that Paul Simon
song.' And 1 was like, 'That's great, but I didn't
write that.'"
When Goldmacher does play covers, which
make up about 30 percent of his show, he plays
songs which are newer and more closely aligned
with his style of songwriting — artists like
Shawn Colvin and Lyle Lovett.
"The two songs acoustic guitarists come to
dread are 'American Pie' and 'Brown Eyed
girl.'"
But although Goldmacher may be sick of
playing "The Boxer," folk rock is deeply rooted
in his music. He's what the kids listening to the
nihilistic Seattle grunge claim is the last thing
this world needs: another folksinger.
