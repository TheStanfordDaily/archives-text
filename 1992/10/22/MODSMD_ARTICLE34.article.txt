Comic books used to be a

medium restricted to ei

ther tame
teenage humor
or far-fetched
plots involving
villains in weird
costumes wielding
guns resembling
household appli
ances.

Gone are the days of
"Archie" and "Superman"

however, where comics had little
more to offer than sea-monkeys and X
ray glasses.

Recently, however, twelve artists in the
genre of modern comic art have assembled an
irreverent collection of political cartoons to be

featured in the "Don't Waste the Power:
Vote!" exhibit on the second floor of

Tresidder starting Oct. 26.
Among the artists featured at the ex
hibit are John K., known for "Ren and
Stimpy," a "children's" cartoon which
has been gathering a cult following since
it first aired on Nickelodeon and MTV.
Peter Bagge, known for "Hate" — a
comic depicting the kind of people your
mother told you to stay away from —

has earned many awards for his work in the
underground comic world. "Love and Rock
ets" comic artist Gilbert Hernandez also con
tributes political cartoons.

Together
with nine

other
artists,
these
1 2

comic

veterans

"draw their
own conclu

sions" about the
campaigns for president

with a humorous collection
of political cartoons which

won't be pulling any punches.

The exhibit, hosted by Details magazine, is
also supplemented with the "Details Survey of
Young Voters," a collection of provocative

facts regarding the largely unrealized voting
power possessed by American young adults.
Marketing Director of Details magazine
Stephen Croncota explains, "This is one of the
more interesting political races of recent histo
ry, and we believe that there's an opportunity
to create a political charge among the young
adult population of America."
The combination of political cartoons and
shocking facts about the campaigns is expect
ed to help motivate students and other young
adults to exercise their right to vote, a right
that 18 year-olds didn't have 25 years ago.
The exhibit is scheduled to run from Oct.
26 through election day, November 3. Free
buttons will be given out opening day for those
of you who really want to prove you were
there.
