Of every 10
characters in a
Shakespeare
play, only three are
women.
The Women's Theater
Collective will probably
never perform any
Shakespeare.

In fact, they'll probably gloss over much of
traditional drama — a field that has traditional
ly done the same to women, according to Assoc.

Drama Prof. Harry Elam.
"Women don't feel like they have a place

to speak in traditional theater," said

Sonia Kuftinec, a masters

student in drama who coordinates the collec
tive's activities.
And so the theater collective usually explores
uncharted theatrical terrain, bringing their own
experiences as women into the spotlight.
In this way, the theater collective has con
tributed to the growing murmur of women's
voices during a year when many are turning the
volume up a few notches to hear them.
But the collective actually came together be
fore the "year of the woman" became a national
catch phrase. And its founding stemmed from a
fortuitous accident.
Kuftinec originally intended what turned
into their first production, "Acting Out," to be a
monologue with the voices and experiences of
other actors infused into production.
So last winter quarter,

Kuftinec posted signs in

the drama department inviting all "women and
men" interested in addressing issues of sexual as
sault to attend an organizational meeting.
Only women showed up.
£ n a way I was disappointed," Kuftinec
I said, recalling that some of the women
X said they knew a few male friends who
were interested in attending. "I was surprised
that none of them actually came," she said.
Presented with this somewhat unexpected
situation, the roomful of women decided to con
tinue their meeting, despite the lack of males.
"We decided that we'd like to try to work as a
group of women and see what would happen in
that context," Kuftinec said.
During rehearsals for "Acting Out," the
women would "spend a lot of time just talking,"
Kuftinec said. "Whatever material ends up being
in the production arises out of the discussion."
But these discussions were not confessionals
at which cast members felt pressured to tell all,
Kuftinec clarified. "It was important not to set
up an environment where it was expected that
everyone has this dark past and that now —
you're finally able to be free with it."
However, many women did lend their voices
to the creative process. And eventually the

women ended up not using the original mono
logue. Instead, they created "Acting Out" from
mostly new experience, bringing in some out

side material, but drawing largely from per
sonal experiences. "Very little was set out to

start with — even the focus of the show,"
said Kuftinec.

Putting the show together piece by
piece without any plan was both exhila

rating and frightening for the cast
i members, Kuftinek said. While there

was a "terrific energy to a lcadcrless
kind of exploration into an idea," it

was also "scary bccause you didn't
have anything to hold on to" if

something didn't work.

Uncertainty surrounding the

audience's response to the ex

perimcntal production also plagued some cast
members. "We thought people weren't going to
get it, or that they were going to think it was
mediocre," said senior Michi Barall.
But their worries turned out to be unfound
ed. "Acting Out" proved to be thought-provok
ing theater.
After their "Acting Out" performance, "the
immediate response of the crowd was silence,"
recalled Assoc. Drama Prof. Harry Elam.
And when the post-performance discussion
about sexual assault began, it was the men who
spoke first, Elam said.
One reason for the performance's potent ef
fect was its method of production, Elam said. Be
cause the piece evolved with significant personal
contributions from each member of the cast, he
said "you felt the personal" connections to it.
Dealing with the issue of sexual assault left the
women emotionally drained at the end of each
rehearsal. "Before you left, you'd always give
everybody a hug to let people leave on an upbeat
note," Barall said.
By the time "Acting Out" was almost
completed, the cast members decided
not to sever the connections they had
built with each other through the emotionally
exhausting process, but rather to continue their
efforts, as the Women's Theater Collective.
Currently the group consists of about 12
women, with varying degrees of acting experi
ence among them. They are now beginning to
work on a new performance that examines im
ages of women's bodies, a topic that grew out of
some of their discussions about sexual assault.
"There is a need for a women's theater collec
tive," said Elam. "It grants them agency in ways
not traditionally granted [to women] in theater.'
In some of the group's first rehearsals last
spring, the women realized the lack of theater
roles written for and by women. "What I was
hearing was an outrage about theater, that felt
like it was in some way muffling the voices of
women," Kuftinec said.
"There's this huge silence when it comes to

women on stage," said senior Bridgit Evans.
Not only is the traditional thespian arena
dominated by male characters, the female char
acters are largely defined by male playwrights.
"A lot of bravado [female) roles are written
from a man's view," Evans said. "Sometimes
there are all female casts [ presented ] from a male
point of view."
And, while people argue about the state
ment's importance, being a woman is inherently
different from being a man. This theme is an un
derlying premise of the collective, being both a
point of unity and oftentimes one of dissent.
Having decided upon the women-only
approach to the show, the women sub
sequently struggled with the question of
whether and how to include men in their pro
duction, when some men began to show interest.
"We talked a lot about what to do with the
drummer, who was male," Kuftinec said. "When
you're looking at a group of women on stage, it's
a very strong statement if you put a man on stage
in that context."
The group resolved the conflict by seating the
two drummers, one male and one female, in the
audience.
The collective's cautious deliberation over
the inclusion of males in the formative stages of
the show, stems from reasoning similar to that of
the Women's Self Defense Workshops.
"We don't spend our time bashing men or
anything," Kuftinec said. But the dynamics of
this dialogue — especially when addressing such
private issues as rape and sexuality — alter when
men are present, many of the members insisted.
In the later stages of the show, a few male
technicians joined the production, operating
lights and sound and also providing their com
ments on the performances.
While the "Acting Out" production was crit
icized by some for alienating men, Ray O'Neal,
who operated sound for the group's perfor
mances, disagreed.
"I didn't find the philosophy to be castrating
in any way," he said.
