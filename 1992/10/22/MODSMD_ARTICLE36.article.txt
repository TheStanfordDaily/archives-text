Students will float—or sink— on the dance floor at this
year's Titanic Ragtime Ball, Sat., Oct. 24. The Paul Price So
ciety Orchestra will perform the same "list of dances that
were played by the band on the Titanic," according to Mar
cella Stauber of the Stanford Dance Division.
Friends of Dance at Stanford, a group of dance enthu
siasts from Palo Alto and the surrounding area, organized
the Ball to raise money for Stanford dance scholarships.
This is the fourth year of the Ragtime Ball, but the first
time it has had a theme, said organizer Stan Isaacs.
The new theme was the brainchild of Richard Pow
ers, a visiting instructor this year at Stanford. Although
costumes are optional, organizers encourage people to
come dressed in period attire such as "tails and gown,
nautical uniforms or shuffle-board sporting whites —
like white silk suits," Stauber said.
The price of a ticket ($2O advance, $25 at the door
and $10 for students) includes Friday and Saturday
night lessons before the ball. Powers will teach dances
from 1912, the year of the Titanic's ill-fated voyage, in
cluding the Ragtime One-Step, the Waltz and the
Tango.
At the ball, Powers will perform the Tango with a
partner, and the Stanford Vintage Ensemble will per
form four period dances, including the Grizzly Bear and
the Turkey Trot.
Powers said the Titanic theme will be carried right
down to the name tags dancers receive at the door.

'There will be a box of the
names of people who sur
vived and a box of those who
didn't. Dancers may be sur
prised by "things happening"
throughout the evening.'

"There will be a box of the names of people who survived
and a box of those who didn't," he said. Dancers may be
surprised, he said, by "things happening" throughout the
evening.
Isaac said Friends of Dance expects "a couple hun
dred" dancers. In the past, more than half were students,
but people from the community also attended.
According to Stauber, the crowd tends to be "mostly
couples," but "many students come singly and hope to find
partners."
