# The 						Silent Treatment
## Potholes and poker faces in restored Buster Keaton film 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Students looking for some good
old-fashioned fun on Sunday night
should pass up Flicks at Mem Aud
and head to Palo Alto's Stanford
Theatre for a night of silent film
comedy — '20s style.
Sunday only, the Stanford The
atre will show a recently restored
version of Buster Keaton's 1928 film,
"The Cameraman," with jazz ac
companiment by a live 12-piece or
chestra.
During the heyday of silent film,
Keaton was the third-most popular
movie comic, after Charlie Chaplin
and Harold Lloyd. Under five-and
a-half feet tall, Keaton was known
for his wild physical stunts and the
poker-faced expression he main
tained when everything was falling
down around him — in more sense
than one.
Stanford Theatre Foundation's
Cyndi Mortensen said what makes
Keaton so entertaining is the way he
stoically endures the comical
mishaps that befall him: "He's so an
archic."
"The Cameraman" is the first
film Keaton made for MGM, and is
considered by some critics to be his
last great comedy. In it, Keaton plays
Luke Shannon, a tintype photogra
pher who falls in love with the beau
tiful Sally, played by Marceline Day.

To impress his new love, Keaton de
cides to adopt the profession of
Sally's suitor, Harold Stagg (Harold
Goodwin), who is a newsreel pho
tographer.
Along the road to love, Shannon
runs into several potholes — among
them a mischievous organ grinder's

monkey and a Chinatown gang war
— that give Keaton a chance for
plenty of physical gags.
With the live music and restored
print, this may be the best chance
Stanford students have had to see
such antics in over six decades. And
The Stanford Theatre's huge screen
and old-style charm will provide an
appropriate nostalgic atmosphere.
Restoration of the film was un
dertaken in 1991 by Richard May.
Before that year, only very low-qual
ity copies of the film were available

for screening because original prints
of the movie, made on unstable ni
trate film, had deteriorated.
But in 1991, a high-quality print
of the film was discovered in a pri
vate collection. The movie was
painstakingly restored and reintro
duced to the world last June in New
York.
The opportunity to see any films
of this period is rare, she added, be
cause "probably 90 percent of the
films from the '20s are lost."
Live musical accompaniment by
Vince Giordano's Nighthawks, an
ensemble playing '20s-style jazz, will
ice the Keaton cake.
Because the original movie score
is lost, they will play a jazz score cre
ated for and debuted at the New
York premiere of "The Camera
man."
"The Cameraman" will close an
eight-week run of Wednesday night
Keaton films at The Stanford The
atre, which Mortensen said has been
highly successful, bringing in about
600 people each night.
"Double Whoopee," a 1928 Lau
rel and Hardy short, will be shown
with the film. The Nighthawks will
accompany the short with the origi
nal score by Hal Roach.
"The Cameraman" and "Double
Whoopee" will be shown at 2:30 and
7:30 p.m. Sunday at the Stanford
Theatre, 221 University Ave., Palo
Alto. Tickets are $7.
