# Eclectic offerings at SF Jazz Festival

### Marc Greilsamer 
The 10th annual San Francisco Jazz Festi
val successfully combines top jazz performers
with a unique thematic approach, which will
likely appease even the most demanding jazz
fans.
The festival, which begins tomorrow, will
feature 22 events — ranging from films to
concerts to club performances — to take
place over a 17-day period. Each event high
lights a different theme drawn from the entire
scope of jazz.
"Every night is designed for a particular
taste. You don't have to sit through what you
don't like," says festival producer Randall
Kline, who also founded Jazz in the City.
The festival will include historical tributes
to Jelly Roll Morton and John Coltrane, per
formances by legends Tony Bennett and
Benny Carter, a blues show on Election Day
and contemporary jazz explorations. The re
sult is what Kline calls "one compact and
comprehensive celebration of jazz."
One highlight of the festival, according to
Kline, will be Ken Nordine's "Word Jazz"
performance on Oct. 28 at Bimbo's 365 Club.
Nordine invented "Word Jazz" — impro
visational poetry recited within the rhythm of
jazz— in the late '50s, when the poetry of the
Beat generation was gaining popularity.
However, Nordine explains, "I wanted to
do my own thing. I didn't want to be catego
rized so people would say, 'Oh, he's just an
other Beat poet.' People can use categoriza
tion to make things cease to exist."
While Jack Kerouac used the accompani
ment of pianist Steve Allen for his poetry,
Nordine felt that "it wasn't really Word Jazz
because it wasn't dependent on the music."

In contrast, Nordine says,"I get rhythmi
cally involved with the music. I'm a musician
as well as a writer. It's that sense of being with
the music instead of having music with you."
Performing live is new to Nordine, who
usually records in his home. He likens his home
studio to "an old pair of shoes that I'm very
comfortable with. There's no fear of strangers."
Nordine said his performance at the festival

poses additional challenges.

"The difficulty
of live perfor

mance is I
have to
have the
musi-

cians
listen
very careful
ly to what I'm
doing," say

Nordine. "IH
have to listen

not only to what
T m doing live but also to
any prepared verbal tape
which we may use as welL"

Working with high-quality mu
sicians will make the transition smoother

Howard Levy (keyboards and harmonica) and
David Grisman (mandolin) will be joining him
in his performance. Both were in the studio last
year, along with Jerry Garcia, to record Nor
dine's "Devout Catalyst" album, which was re
leased on Grateful Dead records.
"When you have musicians like David Gris
man and Howard Levy," Nordine says, "it's
unbelievable what they can come up with in a
kind of rapport situation."
Another festival highlight will be Elvin
Jones's performance. Jones and his group, Jazz
Machine, will lead the Coltrane tribute on Oct.
29 at Davies Symphony Hall. Jazz Machine
features Coltrane alumnus Sonny Fortune and
Coltrane's son Ravi.
Many say Jones has changed the direction
of jazz drumming with his invention of the
"polyrhythmic" technique. A member of
Coltrane's groundbreaking quartet of the '60s,
Jones has proceeded to establish himself as one
of jazz's premier percussionists.
The tribute, which commemorates the 25th
anniversary of Coltrane's death, will feature
other notable musicians, including Tommy
Flanagan and Pharoah Sanders.
Although the music of Nordine and Jones
appears to be quite different, there is a con
nection.

Nordinc calls it"the ability to take risks,
chances — to do something that is off the
beaten track. People sense that the guy is
trying to do something that isn't the same
old thing." In addition, both performers
know how to listen to what other musi
cians are playing.
The need for improvisation and spon

taneity has become the definition of jazz. Nor
dine explains, "If you know exactly what you're
going to do, you become a kind of a parrot."
