# Art meets history at Hoover exhibit

What do a voluptuous woman in army
garb and a knife piercing a bible have in com
mon? More than you think. These images are
only two of 47 posters which comprise the
powerful exhibit, "Persuasive Images: Posters
of War and Revolution from the Hoover In
stitution Archives" now on display at the
Hoover Institution.
This exhibit follows the publication of a
book bearing the same title featuring 317 po
litical posters garnered from the Institute's
vast collection.
Authored by Hoover fellow Peter Paret,
Beth Irwin Lewis and Paul Paret, the book
owes its success to a marvelous, coherent inte
gration of war images with an explanatory
text.
No page flipping is necessary because text
and image are presented simultaneously — a
neat invention which makes you wish Peter
Paret had authored your art textbooks.
This presentation craftily emphasizes the
reality and strength of posters as a propagan
da medium. "We decided to treat the posters
both as historical documents and as aesthetic
objects, not as separate items, but as part of
something larger," Paret said.
Posters, he said, "bear on infinite aspects of
both society and culture," serving as an effec
tive form of communication.
The material in both the book and exhibit
outlines major historical developments with
in our century, featuring posters from Russia,
Central and Western Europe and the United
States that span the period from just before
World War I through today.
It is incredible to witness the way the images
reflect the different interpretations of World
War I. For example, a British recruiting poster
screams of self-confidence in traditional for
mat, while a Russian poster portrays a fantasti
cal, futuristic vision of what an air raid might be
like.
Later images become more horrific with en
emies portrayed as beasts and monsters attack
ing defenseless women and children.
The exhibit poignantly demonstrates the
power of mass media art. With strategic posi
tioning and widespread publication, good
posters could and did change public sentiment
toward global politics and altered the course of
history.

The "Persuasive Images" exhibit is open to the pub
lie from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays through Dec. 31
