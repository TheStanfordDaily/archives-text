## Newly homeless have few problems; Alcohol, drugs, illness follow later 
### Michelle Johnson 
When they first hit the streets,
homeless people are not much dif
ferent from the general popula
tion in their incidence of mental
illness, alcoholism and drug
abuse, according to an innovative
Stanford study released this week.
But after losing their homes,
people become more likely to use
alcohol and drugs and have psy
chiatric problems.
In interviewing more than
1,400 homeless, single adults, the
researchers found the rate of alco
hol and drug abuse and mental ill
ness was no more than 12 percent
greater among those who had just
lost their homes than among the
sheltered population.
"The homeless are not as im
paired as we thought," said Mari
lyn Winkleby, the Stanford senior
research scientist who was the
lead author of the study. The
study is one of the most extensive
to date which substantiates the
notion that homelessness is the
cause, not the result, of many
homeless people's substance
abuse and mental illness.
Forty-six percent of the home
less people interviewed in the
Stanford study did not report hav
ing problems with substance abuse
or mental illness before becoming
homeless, Winkleby said. Howev
er, the longer people are homeless,
the more likely they are to have
problems with mental illness and
substance abuse, Winkleby said.
Of those without prior sub
stance abuse problems or mental
illness, 35 percent reported exces
sive alcohol use after being home
less for more than five years, 24

percent reported using illegal
drugs and 21 percent reported
being hospitalized for mental ill
ness, the study said.
Barry Del Buono, executive di
rector of the Emergency Housing
Consortium, said in a statement,
"I think homelessness makes you
crazy. I think that's what they
(the researchers) are saying."
Winkleby said she hopes the
study will encourage public policy
makers to look at homeless people
as a diverse group and realize a va
riety of measures are needed to
help them.
"It argues for either preventing
losing their housing or interven
ing immediately," Winkleby said.
"It's crazy to wait."
In the past, homeless people
have been stereotyped as mentally
ill or as substance abusers, she
said. These stereotypes partly
came from previous studies on the
homeless which only looked at
their incidence of mental illness
and substance abuse after the loss
of shelter, Winkleby said.
Also, many of those studies did
not compare the rates of mental
illness and substance abuse of
homeless, people to those of the
general population, she said.
Winkleby, who has done volun
teer work to help homeless people,
said she began thinking about the
approach for the Stanford study
because the data she read in other
studies did not seem to reflect
what she saw in shelters, clinics
and soup kitchens.
"This is the first study to look
at what people are like when they
first lose their shelter," she said.
The researchers interviewed
more than 1,400 homeless, single
adults in Santa Clara County's
National Guard armories between
November 1989 and June 1990.
At the same time, the
researchers conducted a similar
study on homeless families in
Santa Clara County shelters. Data
from that study is still under
review, Winkleby said.
Of the single homeless people
interviewed, 68 percent had com
pleted high school, and 30 percent
had attended college, the study
showed. In California 75 percent

of the general population finishes
high school, and 47 percent
attend college.
Forty-one percent of men and
25 percent of women interviewed
said they had worked continuous
ly between the age of 18 and the
time they became homeless, the
study said. Seventy-eight percent
of men and 43 percent of women
said they had supported them
selves with their own jobs before
becoming homeless.
"This shows that the homeless
have not always been marginally
attached to the workforce," Win
kleby said.
Two-thirds of the single home
less people interviewed by the Stan
ford researchers were between the
ages of 25 and 44, while 48 percent

of California's general population
falls in this age range. Twenty-one
percent of the homeless people
interviewed were black, compared
to 8 percent of the state's general
population.
Among those reporting sub
stance abuse and mental illness
before becoming homeless, 7 per
cent reported having multiple prob
lems, 17 percent reported heavy
alcohol use, 8 percent reported ille
gal drug use, and 5 percent report
ed a history of mental illness.
Five percent of homeless people
interviewed reported a major
injury or illness which caused
them to lose their homes, and 47
percent of those people lacked
health insurance at the onset of
their injury, the study said.
