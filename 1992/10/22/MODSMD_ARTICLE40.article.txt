# Mary's Danish: An American Standard?
## 
### Daphne Kwong 
The cover of "American Standard," the latest
release from Mary's Danish, features a ham
burger dripping ketchup on to an Uncle Sam
top hat. Only it's not a hamburger, it's a veggie
burger.
This departure from the norm comes across
as rather ironic considering "American Stan
dard" is a movement towards the norm. Until
now, Mary's Danish has been known for funk,
punk, country, blues and folk songs.
Where their eclecticism failed to produce co
herent albums before, their new rock sound suc
ceeds. Strong guitar and drum performances con
tribute to the energy that dominates the album.
The band wrote "American Standard" in a
warehouse in downtown Los Angeles earlier this
year and recorded it in George Lucas' Skywalker
Studios. There, in the lush surroundings of the
ranch, they watched the riots erupt in L.A.
"It was really frightening because it was our
city, but we were really removed," Ritter said.
Los Angeles has been a common subject for
the band's songs. In "Axl Rose is Love," they
sing, "I'm telling you to your face this city's
falling into the hands of disgrace.... There's
racism and bigotry, there's a problem we need to
address."
Before moving to L.A., the founding band
members lived in the Bay Area. Singers Ritter
and Gretchen Seager met while attending UC-
Berkeley, and played Jimi Hendrix covers to
gether.
Their musical direction changed with the ad
dition of guitarist David King, whom Ritter met
while working at Tower Records. In 1987, they

moved down to LA. to pursue a musical career
and added bassist Chris Wagner, drummer
James Bradley, Jr. and guitarist Louis Gutierrez
to their line up.
"American Standard," the band's third album,
marks the first time the band has collaborated on
every song "We were nervous that if we wrote to
gether we would lack a spearheaded passion,"
Ritter said. Writing in pairs instead of collaborat
ing was alienating, according to Ritter. "It was
putting pressure on the group. The musical dif
ferences were turning into personal differences."
While on tour, they called an emergency
meeting to overcome their divisions. "We said,
'Let's focus on our common denominator' —
which was rock," Ritter said. "But everybody
had a different idea of what rock was." The
meeting kept the band together and gave them a
somewhat coherent idea as to the direction of

their album.
Noticeably absent in their lyrics is the theme
of politics — which is strange for a band who is
so politically active, participating in Rock the
Vote, Rock for Choice and benefits for Barbara
Boxer. But the group keeps their politics sepa
rate from their songs.
"We're endorsing the Clinton/Gore ticket,"
said Ritter.
WTiat about Tipper Gore, Al's wife, who led
the movement for censorship in rock music?
Ritter points out that voting for Bush doesn't
necessarily protect musicians from censorship
either .And what if Clinton isn't all that he seems
to be? "I'd rather have a liar that is pro-choice
than a liar that is not pro-choice."

Mary's Danish will be playing the Edge in Palo Alto
tonight and Slim's in San Francisco on Friday.
