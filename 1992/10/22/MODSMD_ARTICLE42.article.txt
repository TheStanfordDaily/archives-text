# A 						cosmopolitan gourmet's dream
## 
### Peter Edmonston 
Stanford students venturing out
to eat must inevitably confront the
age-old ponderous question: Mexi
can, Italian, or Chinese? This gastro
nomic Bermuda Triangle of the col
lege world, as enticing as it is, must be
escaped from time to time. Cafe
Claude is the perfect alternative.
Unlike most cafes, where the $3
minimum is the only reason to order
the overpriced food, San Francisco's
Cafe Claude is a place where you
want to eat as well as drink.
The menu contains all the basic
staples of French cuisine at reason
able prices. Baguette sandwiches are
all under six dollars. The croque
monsieur — grilled cheese with ham
and real cheese (not Kraft Singles like
its American counterpart) — is a
deal at $6.75. It comes with a salad
and lots of cornichons.
Cafe Claude's more elaborate fare
is just as enticing and still inexpen
sive. One special is the duck leg con
fit. After tasting the tangy sauce and
crisp skin, even those who do not
care for canard will be made into
faithful converts. Served on a salad of
spinach and arugula with marinated
potatoes, this gourmet preparation is
a steal at $10.
And of course, no French meal
would be complete without dessert.
The creme caramel is not to be
missed. Presented on a large plate
with the caramel dripping down the
sides, it looks as good as it tastes.
But the cafe's charm comes from
more than just its food. The interior
is straight out of a Toulouse-Lautrec
poster. Globular lamps hang from
the ceiling, dimly illuminating the
rough wood floors and the beams
that arch from the walls. The front
windows look out on the cul-de-sac
where, during the day, the locals
lunch Parisian style.
If you are expecting cafe attitude,
however, you will be pleasantly sur

prised. The atmosphere is casual and
friendly.
The cafe's owner and founder,
Steven Decker, says he intended to
make Cafe Claude a "neighborhood
bar," like those frequented by the
French working class. Indeed, many
of the clientele are "regulars" who
work in the area.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays the
carefree ambience is enhanced by a
jazz band that plays unobtrusively in
the front by the bar. The Brian
Melvin Trio breaking into a ultra-hip
rendition of "Hava Nageila" com
pletes the festive mood.
And evidently, Cafe Claude has a
dedicated following, judging from
the dozens of postcards wedged into
the backs of the booths. "II fait hot"
read one particularly pithy message.
Cafe Claude's authentic French
feel is no accident. Almost everything
inside — from the beer taps to the
cappuccino cups to the bar itself —

was part of a cafe in Paris. When the
cafe was forced to close, Decker
bought as much as he could and
transported it to San Francisco,
where he found the perfect alleyway
in which to rebuild Cafe Claude.
Since its opening four years ago, Cafe
Claude has attracted much of the
substantial French community of
San Francisco, as well as local Fran
cophiles.
"The discovery of a new dish does
more for the human race than the
discovery of a new star." This typical
ly French sentiment expressed by
Anthelme Brillat-Savarin applies to
new cafes as well. Those who discov
er Cafe Claude will understand what
he meant.

Cafe Claude is heated in San Francisco at
7 Claude Lane, at the comer of Bush and
Kearny. It is open Monday through
ThursdayBa. m. to 9p.m., Friday Ba. m.
to 10 p.m., and Saturday 10a.m. to9p.m.
