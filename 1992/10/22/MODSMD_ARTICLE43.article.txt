What's a graduate in engineering de
sign doing teaching tango? That's the
question often asked of Stanford gradu
ate Richard Powers.
"If you would've told me I was going
to be teaching historical dance, I wouldn't
have believed you," said Powers.
The renowned dance instructor
graduated from Stanford with a self-de
signed major focusing on the "creative
process," incorporating art, philosophy,
and engineering design. He worked in
graphic and product design for several
years, and currendy holds eight patents
on products such as the jet-ski and tam
per-proof caps for medicine bottles.
The change came in the mid-'7os,
when Powers began studying Tai Chi and
Kendo (the art of the Japanese sword) in
which he has since become a black belt.
These classes gave him "an awareness of
space" and movement, he says.
He began attending folk dances and
discovered that it was "even more fun to
move with someone else in synchronicity."
That eventually led him to Renais
sance dance workshops. Within his first
year of historical dance, he started his
own Renaissance dance company, the
Clifton Court Dancers.
It was when he tried 19th and 20th
century dance, though, that he knew
he'd found his art form. He explains the
difference between Renaissance and
more recent dance as the contrast be
tween "dancing around your partner
versus holding them and spinning
around the room." The latter is "more
kinesthetically exhilarating," he said.
His dance hobby became an increas
ingly important part of his life, Powers
said, and "soon it was more than paying
the bills." He left his design clients to
pursue a full-time career in dance.
In 1982, he started The Flying Cloud
Vintage Dance Troupe, which holds
classes, performances and recreations of
Victorian and ragtime balls in Cincinnati.
Powers has taught summer classes at
Stanford for many years, but this is his
first year-long position as a historical
dance instructor. He works only half
time, which permits him to travel across
the country to teach dance workshops
on the weekends. He uses the flights to
research dance.
According to Stan Isaacs, also a vin
tage dance instructor and a member of

Friends of Dancc at Stanford, Powers
"has the best combination of historical
accuracy, teaching ability and charis
ma" of any dance instructor he knows.
Above all, Isaac said, Powers has the
talent "to take a historical dance and
make it live."
Isaac described Powers as "almost
single-handedly responsible for the vin
tage dance revival in this country."
"He's a level above just teaching,"
Isaacs said. "He's a bringer of atmos
phere and feeling," using everything
from orchestral arrangement, to period
pictures and typesetting, to "names that
make the right sound."
Powers said he prefers working on
fewer productions so he can explore all
their different dimensions. "The plea
sure is in doing the different aspects my
self rather than directing and allocat
ing," he said, holding up an envelope
with the sheet music he found from the
last dance played on the Titanic. "There
are more dimensions (in vintage dance]
than any other I've worked in."
Powers attributed the increasing
popularity of vintage dance among stu
dents to a "growing number of people
who like dancing with a partner." Also,
he added, people come to balls just to try
something "really different and fun."
Interestingly enough, the proportion
of male and female students has changed
in recent years. Both on and off campus,
he said, "my classes have extra men."
Powers doubts that he will remain in
the San Francisco area for more than
two years. Here, he said, cultural op
portunities abound, but the city is hill
of "people with no time to go."
He said his "roots run deep" in
Cincinnati, where he enjoys the relative
rarity of the arts. "There aren't so many
opportunities," he said, "so everyone
knows about what we do."
As evidenced by the purple socks that
emerge beneath the cuffs of his tan suit,
Powers' seriousness about dance is bal
anced by a sense of fun. Students who go
to the Ball, he said, will discover that "it's
fun, it's easy, and it's different."
Powers said the ball's Titanic theme
will appeal to the Stanford communi
ty's often ironic humor. "It's become a
part of our myth," he said, "rather than
a real tragedy."
As an example he tells a joke from
1912, the year the Titanic sunk: "Ever
hear what happened when Mrs. Astor
sent for more ice?"
