# Making love to a tonic with a twist of lemon
## 
### 
It's been two years. Two long, dry years. And I
haven't drank in that long either.
At one point, I was a great drinker. A Hem
ingway-class drinker. I vomited in my house, at
my friend's houses, at house's of people who 1
didn't know as well as the Bradys knew Oliver.
I once gave the technicolor yawn to some
guy's parent who said she delivered me. She
looked down and said it looked familiar, only
my placenta was cuter. So 1 let her talk to Ralph
direct, if you know what I mean.
The first time I ever danced with the devil in
the pale moonlight was New Year's Eve, sopho
more year. Up until then, I had been avoiding
my friends, because they spent their weekends
drinking Chivas Regal out of Crest tubes they
buried in their backyard during the week. Then
they would put on helmets and run into fences.
I didn't think they'd let me do the fence thing
without the flouride-enhanced whiskey.
But it looked like another New Year's with
my parents, watching them do their once-a
year open mouth kiss.
So, in a Nancy Reagan-inspired bout of par
ent-child bonding, I made some sort of con
tract with my parents that I wouldn't drink.
I spent the first half of,the night turning
down swigs of my friend's Wild Turkey and
worrying I'd forget the girl's name who was

throwing the party:
"Hi. Uh, is Kristi — uh, Krista there? I was
wondering if she could come out and play."
She was seven feet tall, and her breasts start
ed to speak. "Who the hell are you? You want to
drink, do you? I think we have some talking to
do, young man...."
And from there it became some demonic
Mr. Rourke-hosts-the ABC-Afterschool-Spe
cial nightmare. My parents were there, my
third-grade teacher was there along with a
short, stumbling man in an enormous, grin
ning Crest costume, threatening to "make
holes in teeth."
But it wasn't like that. Kris somehow knew
my name and took my coat like we were going
to play croquet in her backyard. Only she was
wearing spandcx leggings and a cut-off sweat

shirt with the words "Italian Boy" in big, block
letters.
Then she handed me a beer. I looked up at
her, ran my hand over my mouth and said,
"Thanks, babe." It was a defining moment of
my masculinity, like the time I threw my back
out as an exuberant youth, foolishly trying to
do precisely what no man should be able.
I leaned back in my chair, closed my eyes
and pictured myself on a desert island, hiking
the football, stringing the mast and roping a
dogie. And I knew that after I built up a sweat,
slapped my buddies on the back and downed
that beer, Kris would strip down to a string
bikini, attach herself to my left arm and I could
ignore her to my heart's content.
So I closed my eyes, tilted my head back and
drank. And I drank again. And I drank until my
urine was this perfect, clear color that you
never see in New Jersey.
And for the next four years I continued to
drink. I drank because of that time my parents'
told me not to. I drank because it allowed me to
talk to women about their breasts.
Most of all, I drank because I wasn't 21, and
my Illinois driver's license said I was. It also
said my name was David Kennedy and that I
lived on 63 Oswald drive, but the guy at the
Liquor Locker never seemed to mind.

Then one day, during my sophomore year
here, I noticed it had been two months since I
had last had a drink. And I still haven't.
It's not that I'm afraid of drinking. But
whenever someone offers me a beer, I always
seem to say no. No matter how attractive they
or their beer might be.
The problem is, there's no challenge in it
anymore — no parents on my back, no princi
pal to rifle through my bookbag like I was Stu
art Reges. It all ended the day my freshman RA
came into our room to drink with us. I almost
cried. But she still wouldn't stay the night.
Sometimes, I wonder if I don't drink in
order to keep some artificial self-definition that
might come crashing down like a badly tapped
keg that some freshmen from Alondra had to
toss down the stairs to puncture.
Or maybe I just don't like the idea of control -
ling my emotions by inserting something called
a "hop" into my bloodstream. Call me crazy.
Must be something inside.

Joel Stein thinks lesbians at pro-choice ral
lies are the political paradigm of our era.
His column will continue to appear here
until he is assassinated by some crazed gun
man, thus making his parents the pawns of
some annoying gun control organization.

wearing spandcx leggings and a cut-off sweat

shirt with the words "Italian Boy" in big, block
letters.
Then she handed me a beer. I looked up at
her, ran my hand over my mouth and said,
"Thanks, babe." It was a defining moment of
my masculinity, like the time I threw my back
out as an exuberant youth, foolishly trying to
do precisely what no man should be able.
I leaned back in my chair, closed my eyes
and pictured myself on a desert island, hiking
the football, stringing the mast and roping a
dogie. And I knew that after I built up a sweat,
slapped my buddies on the back and downed
that beer, Kris would strip down to a string
bikini, attach herself to my left arm and I could
ignore her to my heart's content.
So I closed my eyes, tilted my head back and
drank. And I drank again. And I drank until my
urine was this perfect, clear color that you
never see in New Jersey.
And for the next four years I continued to
drink. I drank because of that time my parents'
told me not to. I drank because it allowed me to
talk to women about their breasts.
Most of all, I drank because I wasn't 21, and
my Illinois driver's license said I was. It also
said my name was David Kennedy and that I
lived on 63 Oswald drive, but the guy at the
Liquor Locker never seemed to mind.

Then one day, during my sophomore year
here, I noticed it had been two months since I
had last had a drink. And I still haven't.
It's not that I'm afraid of drinking. But

seem to say no. No matter how attractive they

anymore — no parents on my back, no princi

cried. But she still wouldn't stay the night.
Sometimes, I wonder if I don't drink in

Notes from a rebel lemming
It's been two years. Two long, dry years. And I
haven't drank in that long either.
At one point, I was a great drinker. A Hem
ingway-class drinker. I vomited in my house, at
my friend's houses, at house's of people who 1
didn't know as well as the Bradys knew Oliver.
I once gave the technicolor yawn to some
guy's parent who said she delivered me. She
looked down and said it looked familiar, only
my placenta was cuter. So 1 let her talk to Ralph
direct, if you know what I mean.
The first time I ever danced with the devil in
the pale moonlight was New Year's Eve, sopho
more year. Up until then, I had been avoiding
my friends, because they spent their weekends
drinking Chivas Regal out of Crest tubes they
buried in their backyard during the week. Then
they would put on helmets and run into fences.
I didn't think they'd let me do the fence thing
without the flouride-enhanced whiskey.
But it looked like another New Year's with
my parents, watching them do their once-a
year open mouth kiss.
So, in a Nancy Reagan-inspired bout of par
ent-child bonding, I made some sort of con
tract with my parents that I wouldn't drink.
I spent the first half of,the night turning
down swigs of my friend's Wild Turkey and
worrying I'd forget the girl's name who was

throwing the party:
"Hi. Uh, is Kristi — uh, Krista there? I was
wondering if she could come out and play."
She was seven feet tall, and her breasts start
ed to speak. "Who the hell are you? You want to
drink, do you? I think we have some talking to
do, young man...."
And from there it became some demonic
Mr. Rourke-hosts-the ABC-Afterschool-Spe
cial nightmare. My parents were there, my
third-grade teacher was there along with a
short, stumbling man in an enormous, grin
ning Crest costume, threatening to "make
holes in teeth."
But it wasn't like that. Kris somehow knew
my name and took my coat like we were going
to play croquet in her backyard. Only she was
wearing spandcx leggings and a cut-off sweat

shirt with the words "Italian Boy" in big, block
letters.
Then she handed me a beer. I looked up at
her, ran my hand over my mouth and said,
"Thanks, babe." It was a defining moment of
my masculinity, like the time I threw my back
out as an exuberant youth, foolishly trying to
do precisely what no man should be able.
