# State Senate candidates send similar messages
## Novice Trinkle challenges incumbent Morgan on education, economy, environment 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Although they represent different politi
cal parties, 11th District State Senate can
didates Becky Morgan and Frank Trinkle
must appeal to the same largely upscale con
stituency to get elected.
As a result, both Morgan, the Republican
incumbent, and Trinkle, a Democratic new
comer, are communicating a remarkably
similar, moderate message to Stanford and
surrounding communities, focusing on the
need for educational, economic and envi
ronmental improvements.

Morgan and Trinkle both emphasize the
importance of school funding and reform,
but each insist they are better suited to be the
"education senator" than their opponent.
"Education is what's going to keep build
ing up this country. It's the root of. . . econ
omy and government," said Trinkle. "I
want to restore California's education to
the support it had in the past."
Morgan, from Los Altos Hills, said she
has consistently worked to improve the
state's educational system. "The issue that
I have focused on as a legislator ... is edu
cation," she said. "People are concerned
that our schools do not have the resources
they need and our graduates do not have the
skills they need for college."

A former teacher and school board mem
ber, Morgan has authored legislation to in
crease the use of computers in schools and to
reduce the size of high school English classes.
"I want to have our schools be 21st centu
ry schools to help our students with their sub
jects and languages. There is so much we can
do both in educating people and in preparing
students for jobs in the future," she said.
Trinkle, a businessman who resides in
Mountain View, said that Morgan had sup
ported educational issues adequately until
this summer, when she decided to back Gov.
Pete Wilson's efforts to cut school funding.
Faced with a multi-billion dollar drop in
state revenue due to the recession, Wilson
and the Legislature spent weeks trying to
hammer out a spending plan. The final bud
get compromise included large funding cuts
for schools and social programs.
Particularly hard-hit was upper-level ed
ucation, which took a 12 percent cut. Other
cutbacks included a 3 percent decrease in
the financial aid budget for students in both
private and public schools as well as a 9 per
cent reduction in the University of Califor
nia system's annual budget.
"Becky Morgan represented big business
and big money. . . . She was one of the chief
supporters of cutting education," said Trin
kle. "You can't balance the budget on the
backs of children."
Morgan said she feels people will under
stand and forgive her for her decisions dur
ing the budget crisis. "I think people have
fairly short memories and they're frustrat
ed. They know we're in a recession and we
just didn't have the money to provide what
we did in the past," she said.
Despite this year's cuts in financial aid,
Morgan said student assistance has been
one of her imyor priorities. "I have worked
closely with the student aid commission and

I am trying to get more money into it," she
said. "It is just unfortunate that this year
we couldn't do that."
Trinkle, a former Army lieutenant
colonel, said he would advocate increasing
financial aid in the form of grants repayable
with military service, a notion consistent
with his own history since he attended Har
vard under the GI Bill.
"Every child should be able to receive the
maximum education they are capable of de
spite their financial situation," he said.
Economic woes
Both candidates said their prior business
experience has given them an understand
ing of how to pull California out of its con
tinuing recession by focussing on the needs
of businesses.
In the past, Morgan has been viewed as a
candidate of big business because her hus
band is the president of a large Silicon Valley
firm. However, she said her interests focus
on all businesses, both great and small.

"One of the reasons
California is in so much
trouble is that people don't
understand the role of
businesses. And you can't
tax businesses or over-reg
ulate them so they can't
create jobs," said Morgan.
Morgan said that if elected
one of her goals for the
coming term would be re-

forming the workers' compensation system.
u lt is something that is killing the state of
California," she said, adding that fraudu
lent claims affect "Stanford University,
cities and all employers."
However, Trinkle said that small business
es should be the foremost concern of legislators
who want to create jobs and spur the economy.

"I understand the problem of small busi
nesses. The rest of our economy has to come
from helping small businesses," he said.
"Large companies can take care of them
selves."
Both candidates said they would support
a research and development tax credit. Mor
gan added that she would support a higher
level of tax credits for university-based re
search.
Environment a priority
Environmental protection is a goal that
both candidates say can be achieved while
boosting the economy.

"I think that you can
protect the environment
and still have businesses
that succeed," said Mor
gan. "But I think it re
quires a reduction in the
bureaucracy that has
grown up around the envi
ronmental issue. We've
come to the point where we
are immobilized in trying

to do what's right."
During her last term, she voted in favor
of the Clean Air Act, a bill to prevent oil
spills and another to ban off-shore drilling.
Trinkle agreed that maintaining the en
vironment must be a high priority. "If the
environment is destroyed, there is no way to
get it back," he said.
Trinkle said he proposes increased mass
transit programs and a greater gas tax as so
lutions that would serve dual purposes by
increasing state revenue for programs and
cleaning up the environment.
Morgan and Trinkle both said they are ar
dent supporters of women's rights. Trinkle,
