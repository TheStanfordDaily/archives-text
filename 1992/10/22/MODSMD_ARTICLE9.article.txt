Democrats sue religious group
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic Party filed a com
plaint yesterday accusing a group founded by religious broadcast
er Pat Robertson of engaging in illegal political activity.
The complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission
accused the Christian Coalition of raising money as a tax-exempt
group but spending it on pro-Republican activities without regis
tering as a political group.
The coalition denied the allegations. It insisted it does not need
to register, because it does not endorse parties or candidates but
merely educates its members about issues.
The coalition, which has applied for tax-exempt status, was
founded in 1989 by Robertson, an unsuccessful Republican presi
dential candidate four years ago, and has a budget this year of
about $7 million, according to its executive director, Ralph Reed Jr.
The Democratic National Committee complaint accused the
coalition of working with Republican candidates and the Republi
can party to produce heavy voter turnout by evangelical Chris
tians — widely viewed as pro-Republican — on Election Day.
