DISTINOUISHED VISITOR AT THI STANFORD HUMANITIES CENTER
Joseph Brodsky, winner of the 1987 Nobel Prize for Literature, was born in 1940 in Leningrad and began writing
poetry at the age of eighteen. In 1964 he was charged with "parasitism" and sentenced to five years in exile in the
Arkhangelsk region of northern Russia However, his sentence was commuted two years later due to internal and
international protests In 1972 Brodsky became an involuntary exile from his native country. After brief stays in Vienna
and London he came to the United States, and now resides in New York City Recipient of honorary degrees from a
number of universities, Brodsky also won the prestigious Mac Arthur Award in 1981, and served as the fifth Poet
Laureate of the United States in 1991. He is the author of four books of poetry, a play, and a collection of essays. His
most recent book, Watermark, is a book-length essay on Venice.
