More endorsements for Clinton
NEW YORK (AP) — For the first time since
1964, it appears likely that a Democratic candidate
for president will receive more newspaper endorse
ments than his Republican opponent.
In a nationwide survey of newspapers, the
industry journal Editor & Publisher found 149
endorsements for Bill Clinton and 121 for Presi
dent Bush, the magazine's managing editor, John
Consoli, said yesterday.

Since 1940, when E&P began conducting its
quadrennial survey, only one Democrat has
received a majority of endorsements. That was
Lyndon Johnson, who received 440 endorsements
in 1964. Republican Barry Gold water got 359.
Newspaper publishers, a famously conservative
lot, have preferred Wendell Willkie over Franklin
D. Roosevelt, Thomas Dewey over Harry Truman,
Richard Nixon over John F. Kennedy and Gerald
Ford over Jimmy Carter. They have endorsed
every successful Republican candidate as well.
