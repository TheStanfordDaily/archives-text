Russia, Ukraine sign accords
MOSCOW (AP) — Russia and Ukraine complet
ed a round of major economic negotiations yesterday
with the signing of three agreements meant to lay
the foundations for future cooperation, officials said.
The accords, signed by prime ministers Yegor
Gaidar of Russia and Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine,
provide for exchanging trade missions, for "most
favored treatment" in mutual trading, and for coop
erating in construction projects in third countries.
Gaidar told the ITAR-Tass news service the two
former Soviet republics strived to achieve a full
free-trade agreement, otherwise "very serious
obstacles to the movement of goods might arise."
Kuchma said Russian-Ukrainian relations will
determine the progress of Ukrainian economic

reform, and that Ukraine had "no other way" but
to maintain and develop close economic links with
Russia, ITAR-Tass reported.
FEC orders Gephardt to pay
WASHINGTON (AP) — Majority Leader
Richard A. Gephardt, whose $2.9 million in re-elec
tion fund-raising is tops in the House, tried unsuc
cessfully yesterday to convince officials he's been
unable to raise $119,000 he owes the government
from his failed 1988 presidential bid.
The Federal Election Commission, calling the
Missouri Democrat's argument "ridiculous,"
unanimously ordered him to pay the money within
10 days. The FEC said he could transfer the money
from his congressional war chest.
