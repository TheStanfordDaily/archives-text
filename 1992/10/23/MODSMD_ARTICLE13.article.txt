# Earthquake-tracking satellite to be released by space shuttle

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) â€” Columbia thun
dered off its launch pad and bolted into space yester
day with six astronauts and a laser-reflecting ball that
geologists will use to track Earth's creeping crust and
learn more about earthquakes.
The 100-ton spaceship blasted off at 1:09 p.m.
EDT. Liftoff was delayed nearly two hours because of
high crosswinds at the shuttle emergency-landing
strip at Kennedy Space Center. The wind eased a lit
tle early in the afternoon, but gusts still exceeded
NASA's allowable limits. NASA waived a flight rule so
Columbia could be launched.
Shuttle deputy director Brewster Shaw, a former
shuttle commander, said he and other mission man
agers opted to launch Columbia despite the gusts

because the average speed of the wind was within
limits.
Wetherbee and his crew are to release the Laser
Geodynamics Satellite, or Lageos, on Friday. The 900-
pound aluminum and brass ball, about two feet in
diameter, is covered with 426 prisms for reflecting
laser beams fired from Earth.
By measuring the round-trip travel time of the
light pulses, scientists hope to measure the slow drift
ing of Earth's tectonic plates. Researchers expect to
measure shifts of less than an inch a year.
"It's a key point for a better understanding of the
mechanisms which are behind the earthquake pro
cess," said Susanna Zerbini, a scientist with the Ital
ian Space Agency.
