MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -
West African peacekeepers fired
artillery barrages at rebels attack
ing Liberia's capital yesterday,
and their warplanes reportedly
bombed the rebels' headquarters
in the interior.
The air raid on the base of rebel
leader Charles Taylor could signal
all-out war between the 7,000-man
peacekeeping force and the rebels.
It came after a week of escalat
ing lighting around Monrovia. The

seven nations that have provided
troops for the force have been rush
ing in reinforcements and weapons.
Commanders of the West
African force could not be contact
ed for comment yesterday. Regular
communications in the city have
been disrupted by the fighting.
Taylor has issued no statements.
The fighting has driven an esti
mated 100,000 refugees into
Monrovia. Red Cross sources said
most of them found shelter with

families or friends. Food does not
appear an immediate problem,
but water is short because Tay
lor's rebels cut off water to the
city during the weekend.
The stepped-up fighting was
likely to strain the alliance of West
African nations that sent the inter
vention force into Monrovia in
August 1990 to stop a bloody civil
war. More than 15,000 people were
killed before the force imposed a
cease-fire in November 1990.
