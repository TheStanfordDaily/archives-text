Faculty need right to
free speech, regardless
of the form they use

ONLY A MONTH INTO the
new school year, and
already the faculty is show
ing disregard for the statements of
University President Gerhard
Casper.
Just days after Casper voiced
misgivings over large numbers of
faculty making collective political
statements — lest it appear the
University itself was taking a
political stance — almost 200 fac
ulty defied his position Tuesday
by holding a press conference to
announce their support of Anna
Eshoo, a democratic candidate for
the 14th Congressional District
seat.
Because anything said by the
president can be easily mistaken
for official University policy,
Casper has said he will refrain
from making political statements.
His reasoning is valid, and Casper
would indeed be wise to practice
great caution when talking on
political matters unrelated to the
University.
However, when this policy is
applied to the faculty, it is wrong.
Although Casper may or may not
agree with it ideologically, he
should recognize that the faculty
members' endorsement of Anna
Eshoo is a valid and appropriate
form of political expression.
Universities are inherently
political institutions. Large num
bers of faculty would risk losing
their jobs if they did not publish
their political views periodically.
Faculty members regularly
shuttle back and forth from Wash
ington, serving as anything from
head of the Food and Drug Admin
istration to Congressional wit
nesses. History has shown us that
universities regularly instigate
important political and social
change.

It is clear that political activism
by faculty is a reality — and a def
inite benefit — for the modern
university. All forms of such
activism, should be allowed and
encouraged.
Granted, reading about 179 fac
ulty endorsing Anna Eshoo is hard
ly as inspiring as our other roman
ticized visions of faculty expres
sion, such as professor participa
tion in Vietnam-era teach-ins.
However, the two cases of facul
ty politicization share a similarity
in their purpose. In both cases, the
professors have stimulated politi
cal debate and brought attention
to important problems facing our
society.
And when today's audience is a
student body sixtysome percent
undecided — read "unknowledge
able" — on the race for the 14th
Congressional District seat,
maybe any attention brought to
our political system is as desper
ately needed now as it was in the
'60s and '70s. And if joining
together in large groups as "Stan
ford faculty" is the most effective
way for faculty to make their voice
heard, they should not hesitate to
do just that.
Having a faculty that remained
silent rather than making joint
statements would pose its own,
more troubling, problems. Not
only would it stifle the exchange of
ideas and political debate, our fac
ulty would appear to support the
status quo.
For example, if plans for last
year's faculty ad in The New York
Times, which condemned the ver
dict in the Rodney King case, were
to have been cancelled or simply
never undertaken, one could easi
ly have perceived faculty accep
tance of the verdict.
Certainly, as Casper has said,
there exists a danger that state
ments made by large numbers of
Stanford affiliates could be mis
read as Stanford policy. This is,
however, a risk that must be
taken in the name of allowing
faculty their freedom of expres
sion.
