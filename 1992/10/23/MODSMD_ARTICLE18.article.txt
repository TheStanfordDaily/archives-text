AASA demonstrates political activism, hardly silent

THIS LETTER IS written in
response to Michael Kim's Oct. 21
letter to The Daily on Asian-Amer
ican invisibility. Michael: You wanted
controversy and debate? You got it.
I am an Asian-American female from
the south, raised in a traditional Chi
nese family. I learned to be polite, listen
to my elders and respect authority. I am
not "breaking my silence" now because I
was provoked by your oh-so-inspiring
letter. Rather, I am condemning your
mindless attempt to stir controversy.
You claim that groups such as the
Asian American Student Association are
only by-products of Asian bad taste and
do nothing to build a positive culture for
Asian-Americans. If you had spent some

time at some of the AASA meetings in
the past and participated in their events
and discussions, you would have found
that AASA does indeed struggle — but
for a positive purpose rather than a dis
play of attention.
Sure, AASA serves as a means for
Asian-Americans (and all those who are
interested in Asian-American culture) to
meet and socialize. But AASA and Asian-
American groups also work for positive
change for the Asian-American commu
nity and provide an outlet for Asians to
"claim our voice," as you suggest.
Rather than spend your time con
demning other Asian-Americans for
their silence, why don't you take part in
AASA's endeavors to enrich the lives

and cultures of Asian-Americans at
Stanford? You are surprised that Asians,
who comprise a quarter of the under
graduate student population, are so
silent. Do you think the Asian-American
population could have gotten so large
without the voices of Asian-American
students, faculty and administrators
who helped push the way?
In the past three years that I have
been involved with AASA, I have worked
to bring about Asian-American studies,
tenure for Asian-American faculty, finan
cial aid for minority students in need,
more minority Asian-American students
on campus, ethnic centers and theme
dorms free from budget cuts and endow
ment for the ethnic centers — not to

mention countless discussions on issues
within the Asian-American community.
If you think Asians are feeble, you
should attend some of these meetings.
We always need more Asian-American
students to get involved in the issues. If
AASA isn't your cup of tea, then get
involved in campus politics. Don't just
sit there and complain about the ineffi
ciency of Asian-Americans.
I understand your frustrations with
the Asian-American community. Howev
er, don't waste your energies by trying
to provoke needless anger. Rather, chan
nel your frustrations towards fruitful,
consolidated efforts.
