# Taco Bell, Elvis show the real problem with contemporary culture
## 
### 
In Brett Rogers' Oct. 19 column he
talks about the bitterness that some
blacks feel when watching whites reap
the benefits of the blacks' cultural lega
cy. The bitterness is not necessarily the
result of an inability to appreciate an
expansion of their culture — in fact,
African-American culture prides itself
on being one of the most dynamic,
expanding and adaptive cultures cur
rently alive.
Rather, the bitterness he spoke of
comes from the recognition that a non
dominant cultural activity will be
ignored, or worse, suppressed, until it is
marketable to the dominant culture.
That's when we see the Taco Bells,
Elvises and Madonnas. These institu
tions don't appreciate, embrace and
expand cultures — they appropriate,
control and exploit them, leaving them
diluted and meaningless to the people

for whom they were a way of life. That's
the more valid and potent source of the
bitterness he described.
