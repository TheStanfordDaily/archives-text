# Neglected pot on stove causes fire at Grove

### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
Food left in a pot on a hot stove caught
fire at Grove Mayfield last night, filling the
house's lower floor with smoke and forcing
the evacuation of approximately 15 resi
dents.
The Row house sustained no major
damage and no residents were injured in
the early evening fire, which was first no
ticed by residents around 7 p.m.
According to Margrit Juretzka, the

house's resident assistant, the pot was ap
parently left on the stove by Food Service
workers.
"They locked the kitchen after they left,
leaving the stove on," Juretzka said.
Fire crews were summoned to the scene
after smoke triggered a fire alarm. Because
no house resident had a key to the kitchen,
which is University-operated, firefighters
were forced to bump out a glass door to gain
entry to the kitchen.
"We had a little bit of a hard
time getting in," said apparatus
operator Ken Gonzales, a member
of the fire crew.
Once inside the kitchen, crews
quickly extinguished the flames,
which reached three feet, with a
fire extinguisher, said Fire Capt.
Chris Jackson.
"We have no master key to the
kitchen, which is interesting,"
Juretzka said.
In self-operative and co-opera
tive houses, residents have keys
to the kitchens because they are
student-run.
But house resident Mike Zwibel
man said he didn't find it odd that
no one had a key to the kitchen.
"If you live most anywhere on
campus, in a big dorm like Stern or
whatever, no one has a key (to the
kitchen), I don't think," he said.
According to Jackson, because
the fire occurred in an area with
both a full sprinkler system and a
dry-chemical system, the fire would
probably have extinguished itself if
the flames had gotten any higher.
After putting out the fire, fire
fighters opened windows and used
a smoke ejector — a large, gas
powered fan — to remove smoke
from the house.
The glass door, which was not
shattered, was then replaced.
