# Neglected pot on stove causes fire at Grove

### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
Food left in a pot on a hot stove caught
fire at Grove Mayfield last night, filling the
house's lower floor with smoke and forcing
the evacuation of approximately 15 resi
dents.
The Row house sustained no major
damage and no residents were injured in
the early evening fire, which was first no
ticed by residents around 7 p.m.
According to Margrit Juretzka, the

house's resident assistant, the pot was ap
parently left on the stove by Food Service
workers.
"They locked the kitchen after they left,
leaving the stove on," Juretzka said.
Fire crews were summoned to the scene
after smoke triggered a fire alarm. Because
no house resident had a key to the kitchen,
which is University-operated, firefighters
were forced to bump out a glass door to gain
entry to the kitchen.
