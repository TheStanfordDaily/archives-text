# History prevents blacks, whites from sharing an American culture
## 
### 
I have bitterly swallowed Brett
Rogers' first two columns, inane as they
both have been. But in his third column,
Roger's plea for everyone to "share
American culture," was just too much to
take.
Rogers, and indeed most Americans,
are proud of that American culture
which represents monumental achieve
ments in personal liberty, technology,
standard of living, etc. Neither coinci
dentally nor surprisingly, Rogers and
most American whites see these accom
plishments as the most salient features
of American history.
But Rogers would face a long and

arduous task if he wanted to convince
me that American culture means free
dom, equality and justice to African-
Americans, Native Americans, Asian-
Americans, Latinos, immigrants, etc.
To a good many citizens, American
culture has come to represent enslave
ment, genocide and annexation under
the epithet of Manifest Destiny.
If Rogers cannot answer his own ques
tion, "Why then doesn't everyone share
this pride?", it is simply because he is not
looking very hard for an answer.
It's funny how Rogers wants African-
Americans to selflessly share their cul
ture, when whites throughout American
history have told blacks that their cul
ture is, in essence, not worth sharing.
Outside of slavery and indentured servi
tude, American whites have historically
wanted nothing to do with blacks.
But as soon as rap goes mainstream,
whites want to incorporate it into
"their" culture. Who can fault African-
Americans for wanting to hold onto
some piece of their culture which is dis
tinctly their own? Allowing the white
music industry to take control of a
black art form can hardly be viewed as

beneficial, especially since, under white
dominance, one cannot expect rap to
remain true to its roots.
The most absurd of Roger's argu
ments is his statement that "White
acceptance of and involvement in rap
shouldn't be seen as some sort of defeat
of black culture at white hands, but
rather as a triumph."
Sorry, Brett, but it just doesn't work
like that. We're not talking about mutu
al exchange of culture, but an absorption
and eventual dilution of one culture by
another. Had whites always been inter
ested in black culture, the story might
be different.
But that's not the way American his
tory has worked, and as things stand,
who is Rogers to chastise blacks and
black rappers for "blindly subscribing to
a racial pride that is a dangerously nega
tive knee-jerk reaction towards any
external influence?"
I would submit that blacks are com
paratively less guilty of such abominable
actions then certain other racial groups
in our country.
