YOU'VE SEEN THEM. YOU'VE
walked by them. But, chances are,
you've never been in one of them.
No, I'm not talking about sorority girls
— I'm talking about adult novelty shops.
Every time I drove by one on El Camino,
their neon signs, exclaiming "Shocking
Books" and "Torrid Movies — 250"
grabbed my attention, but I never had the
cajones to stop and go in. Until recently.
Firstly, so as not to tarnish my good
name, I must make it absolutely clear
that I was not looking to satisfy any deep
seeded Freudian desires or depraved sex
ual fantasies. I was going in strictly as a
reporter, and if I had to suffer through a
few torrid movies in the name of journal
ism, then so be it.
I entered the shop, armed only with
my faith in humanity and 10 bucks in
quarters.
The first thing that grabbed my eye as
I walked through the door was the wall of
"multi-speed stimulators." There were
enough faux-sausages here to make all of
Berlin green with envy.
I had always been fairly satisfied with
the size of my penis, but the Original
Peter Pump, displayed prominently
amongst the dildos, was enough to make
even the most confident of men question
his manhood. "Pump your way to bigger,
harder and better pleasures," it pro
claimed, "with our revolutionary telescop
ing vacuum chamber." I eventually reject-

Ed the pump, because it looked more pow
erful than the Dustbuster I used to use,
and I am not a gambling man.
My fellow shoppers struck me as the
kind of guys who would go to the circus
just to see the animals have sex, and as I
watched their greasy hands rubbing
everything in sight, I began to under
stand why the owner had placed a 15
minute maximum on browsing.
I sauntered over to the magazine rack,
where an elderly man in an expensive
suit stood with a copy of "Young and
Shaved" in his trembling hands. I passed
over the fetish magazines, like "Cross-
Dressers in Bondage" and "Blistered
Buns," and pulled out a magazine called
"Night of Egyptian Delights."
Looking at the beautiful girl on the
cover, I thought to myself "When was the
last time I held a woman close and whis
pered in her ear?" I opened the magazine,
and thought "My God, that woman must
be ambidextrous!"
This boutique d'amour had more oils
than Jiffy Lube in more flavors than
Baskin Robbins. The packaging for these
ointments, however, can be deceiving.
Most of them don't taste remotely like
the advertised flavor (except for kiwi
fruit, which was positively scrumptious).
The most popular feature of any adult
novelty shop is the adult movie, and this
store was no exception. They had just
about every porno known to man, includ

ing "Thanks for the Mammaries," "On
Golden Blonde," "Close Encounters with
my Kind Uncle," "Edward Penishands"
and"The Sperminator." For anyone who
is considering going into acting, these
films are a must.
On my way out, the smiling imp
behind the counter tried to sell me a bot
tle of pheromone cologne, saying it was a
maximum-strength sex attractant and
would unleash animal urges in women.
What kind of fool did he take me for?
I bought four bottles, just in case.
So what is my conclusion from this
brief sojourn through latex heaven?
Don't lament the fact that you're not
having sex; lament all the different vari
eties and styles of sex that you're not
having, and take solace in the fact that
you don't drool every time you see the
word "plastic."
As I walked outside, I glanced at the
sign hanging on the door. It read, "Thank
you for shopping here. We are very proud
of our store, so please come again." Oh,
the irony.
