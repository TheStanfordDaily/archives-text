## Richard Holeton Lecturer responds to brewing controversy over Freshman English 
### 
IN A RECENT SERIES OF letters,
the Freshman English Program has
gotten almost as much free publicity
as Hoover Fellow Martin Anderson's new
book about education, "Impostors in the
Temple." Professors Kenneth Fields, and
then Anderson again, have made or
rebutted a number of charges and claims
about the required writing courses at
Stanford and who teaches them.
For students and others whose heads
were left spinning, I'd like to clarify exactly
how the program is structured. And given
that everyone in sight seems to be in favor of
improving teaching, as a lecturer and former
teaching administrator in the program I'd
also like to redirect the energy of this dia
logue toward making concrete improve
ments.
Four categories of people teach most
Freshman English courses:
1) Second-year graduate students from
English, Comparative Literature and Mod
ern Thought and Literature (about 25 to 30
percent of all sections).
2) Advanced graduate students from the
same departments (about 25 to 30 percent
of sections).
3) English professors, tenured or tenure
line (less than 5 percent of sections this
year).
4) Lecturers (currently about 40 percent
of all sections, down from 50 percent two

years ago).
While some of the second-year graduate
students have prior teaching experience,
most have only TA'd and all are teaching
their own course at Stanford for the first
time. As both Fields and Cohen explained,
they undergo extensive training in peda
gogy and supervised apprentice teaching.
Advanced graduate students are eligible
to teach Freshman English again in their
fourth, fifth and sometimes later years.
English professors may or may not have
previously taught Freshman English cours
es. They are professional literary scholars
or professional fiction writers or poets.
There are no tenure-line rhetoricians or
composition or writing-across-the-disci
plines specialists at Stanford, as there are
at many other institutions.
While many English faculty may be
highly qualified to teach freshman writing
courses, Anderson is mistaken to assume
that their status as "honest-to-God profes
sors" is what gives them these qualifica
tions. In fact it does not.
The only professional composition spe
cialists at Stanford are lecturers.
It is the lecturers, not "real professors,"
who publish textbooks and articles and
attend professional conferences in the fields
of composition and rhetoric. It is the lectur
ers who have developed innovative, nation
ally recognized curricula in the Community

Service Writing Project and in multimedia
computer applications.
Professors Fields and Cohen, in their
replies to Anderson, elaborated on the
accomplishments and professionalism of
the Freshman English lecturers. Faculty
committees, deans and administrators have
repeatedly stressed the importance of the
undergraduate writing program and reaf
firmed the central role played by lecturers.
Why is it, then, that these supposedly
crucial teachers continue to be treated at
Stanford as seasonal, part-time labor?
The facts are, Freshman English lectur
ers are offered one-year contracts only,
although some have taught at Stanford as
long as 20 years. There are no full-time
teaching jobs offered in Freshman English.
Most lecturers make less than $15,000 per
year and do not receive full benefits cover
age, and many are forced to teach at other
colleges in order to make a living.
R«x)gnizing these inequities, the Facul
ty Senate voted overwhelmingly in 1990-91
to recommend that departments offer lec
turers five-year, renewable appointments
and address the "benefits gap."
Furthermore, a special Provost's Task
Force appointed the same year made a
number of specific recommendations about
paid leave, professional travel, compensa
tion and other lecturer issues; the Universi
ty Cabinet endorsed all the University-wide

recommendations in spring of 1991.
What has happened to all these recom
mendations?
Evidently, recommendations and new
policies were nipped in the bud by the
School of Humanities and Sciences during
the University's budget crisis. Why?
Apparently because lecturers — though
an incredible bargain compared to profes
sors — are more expensive labor than
graduate student teachers.
Moreover, under budget pressure from
the school, Freshman English has been
forced to cut back further the number of
sections taught by lecturers, to increase
the sections taught by graduate students
and to increase maximum class enroll
ments to 20.
Perhaps it should not be surprising,
given these trends, that Anderson got the
impression that graduate students do all
the teaching in Freshman English.
Does all this add up to a lack of institution
al commitment to undergraduate teaching for
a course universally seen as fundamental?
Clearly it does, and here again Anderson is
asking the right questions.
However, if Anderson really wants to
make a difference in undergraduate educa
tion at Stanford, he should work together
with Professors Fields and Cohen, and
other professors who care about these
issues, to:

• Ask H&S if it is their policy to simply
ignore, or effectively veto, the recommen
dations of the Faculty Senate and the
Provost's Task Force regarding lecturer
and senior lecturer appointments at Stan
ford.
• Lobby H&S to allow the English
Department to offer Freshman English lec
turers five-year contracts and benefits
packages and to appoint senior lecturers
according to the new official University
guidelines.
• Ask H&S and the Provost's Office to
increase the Freshman English budget so
the program can return to smaller section
sizes and can support its outstanding cur
ricular initiatives.
• Petition the University Cabinet and
the new administration to follow through
on all the recommendations of the 1991
Provost's Task Force on Lecturers.
The real "impostors" in Stanford's
"temple" are not graduate students, lectur
ers or professors but the deans and high
level administrators who pay lip service to
the quality of undergraduate education and
the importance of writing in the curricu
lum without committing real resources to
back up their rhetoric.
