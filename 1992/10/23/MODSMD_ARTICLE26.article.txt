# Meat or no meat? EBF keeps the peace
## 
### Jane Bahk 
While many dorms spent their first house
meeting arguing about whether to spend dorm
funds on alcohol, Enchanted Broccoli Forest
residents were reaching a consensus on com
post, cruelty-free eggs and cutting boards.
"The biggest controversy this year was
regarding meat," said Mike Franz, EBF's res
ident assistant. "This year we have fewer veg
etarians than we have had in past years —
only about a dozen or so, plus one vegan."
Located on Campus Drive behind the Knoll,
this campus co-operative is home to 51 stu
dents and is even named after a vegetarian
cookbook.
A separate cutting board and opaque con
tainers keep the peace between vegetarians
and meat lovers. "We're just taking care of
where the meat is put and making sure that
the juices aren't flowing everywhere," Franz
said.
Another issue discussed at a recent meeting
was whether the house would buy eggs from
humanely raised chickens, even if they cost an
extra 14 cents apiece.
Residents were concerned about supporting
commercial chicken farms that keep their ani
mals caged in the dark, according to Franz.
Consensus — rather than majority rule —

determines house policies, Franz said. When
it appears that the house has reached an
agreement on an issue, the house meeting
leader will ask, "Is there consensus?" and res
idents will snap their fingers. If not, they will
continue to talk until a compromise is
reached.
"People make fun of consensus, but here it
seems to work just fine," sophomore Ruby
Rosas said. "I think that you'll find that in co
ops people are pretty open-minded about
things. I like how you contribute to living in
the house instead of hiring people to do every
thing for you."
Formerly home to the Alpha Delta fraterni
ty, EBF is now a co-op where residents are
responsible for the upkeep of the house. Resi
dents are assigned compost, kitchen, dry
goods and produce duties.
While some EBF residents chose the house,
high draw numbers left others with no alter
native. Franz said about 15 current residents
did not put the house on their draw cards at
all.
"When I found out that I was going to live
here, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry,"
junior Arbora Johnson said. But with a draw
number of 4807, she realized that she was
lucky to get housing.
And Johnson said she has been "positively

surprised" by EBF. "The two-room doubles
are nice, the board bill's cheap, and the food is
awesome. I thought that I wouldn't fit in, but
there's not really a 'type' of person here.
There are a lot of different people."
Franz said he hasn't planned programs to
"encourage multiculturalism in the hbuse,"
because "we have a pretty diverse group and it
tends to happen on its own. The most educa
tional activities tend to be those that are more
informal."
Common house activities include improvi
sational workshops, batikking, tie-dying and
performances by folk musicians.
Traditionally, Franz said, residents have
been music-oriented. Every other Wednes
day, bands play for free at the house's happy
hour.
"It serves as a venue where musicians can
just come play, see people enjoying their music
and just relax," Franz said. "It's gotten
around by word of mouth and we've had some
bands play at the house for five years now. "
"I think music is a real interest, a real
theme of the house," he said.
Toleration is another key element in EBF,
Franz added. "There's a broad range of toler
ance and a broad range of lifestyles, but cer
tainly nobody's style infringes on anybody
else's."
