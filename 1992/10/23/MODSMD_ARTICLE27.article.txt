## Linebacker Garnett uses mind for football success Thinking-man's player collects books, crushes on defense 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
To the casual observer, college foot
ball may not seem to have much to do
with the inner life of an individual.
However, it is precisely his ability to
fuse his physical and intellectual worlds
into a coherent philosophy that makes
senior outside linebacker Dave Garnett
such a unique player.
A four-year starter, Garnett has
made key plays all year and has
emerged as one of the cornerstones of
the Cardinal defense. At practice, one
minute he is on the field making the
play and the next minute he is on the
sideline discussing the pros and cons of
various formations with the coaches.
But Garnett hasn't always been a
student of the game. "I've been playing
for about 12 years now," he said.
"When I was little I liked it, but I didn't
become an avid fan until I got older."
The turning point came during his
sophomore year at North High School
near Chicago, when he was moved up
from the B-team and began getting
more playing time.
It was this first taste of success that
ignited his desire to understand his
sport. "Once you start actually playing,
you want to learn more about it,"he said.
Always a lover of good defense, Gar
nett grew up idolizing Mike Singletary
and the vaunted linebacking corps of
the 1985 Chicago Bears. Ever since, he
has brought a particular love to watch
ing defensive football.
"I tend to relate to defense more," he
said. "You can see what sort of tenacity
and chemistry are required to play
well."
Garnett credits those Chicago Bears
with bringing popularity to a defensive
style that relies on an aggressive philos

ophy. He seems pleased that the Cardi
nal defense has adopted that style and
attributes its success to this philosophy.
"Our defense is fun to watch," he
said. "It's the sort of defense that forces
the offense to do certain things, an
action defense instead of a reaction
defense."
At Stanford, Garnett spent his first
two years at inside linebacker before

'Once you start actually
playing, you want to learn
more about It.'

moving to outside linebacker last sea
son. In 1991, he was second on the team
with 64 tackles and second in tackles
for loss, with 17 on the season.
This year, Garnett has helped the
Stanford defense become one of the
toughest in the nation. He is the only
defensive player to line up on virtually
every down and is the Cardinal's third
leading tackier, with 39 so far this year.
Garnett credits defensive coordina
tor Fred vonAppen with bringing this
year's unit together. VonAppen
bestows a "pearl of wisdom" on his
players every week, which Garnett likes
because they apply not only to football
but to life in general.
"One week he told us 'Experience is
a tough teacher. First it tests, then it
teaches,"' Garnett said. "If you think
about it, it means a lot."
Garnett has clearly spent a lot of
time thinking about the role football
plays in his life. Although he loves the
game, he has many other interests and

maintains a realistic outlook.
A political science major and avid
reader, Garnett is always on the look
out for a good book. He cited John
Grisham, Robert Ludlum and Stephen
King as some of the authors he has
been reading lately.
"I collect books," he declared. "It's
the biggest thing I buy besides food.
Right now I'm trying to control it,
though. I'm trying to avoid bookstores
and stay on my budget."
No amount of bookishness, however,
will stop Garnett from trying to play
professional football. If nothing else,
playing in the NFL would provide him
with a much larger book budget. If
things don't work out, though, he'll
probably attend law school.
"We'll see how it goes," he said. "If I
get a chance to play, I'm going to do
everything I can to make it."
Right now, Garnett is enjoying the
last year of his Stanford career. Despite
offers to live off-campus, he lives in
Faisan because he likes to stay close to
campus life.
"There's a lot more to college than
going to class and playing football," he
said.
This weekend, there won't be more
than football as Garnett and his team
mates travel to Eugene to battle the
Oregon State Beavers. Although Stan
ford enters the game a heavy favorite,
the defense has made some special
preparations for the Beavers' option
style attack.
"We're trying to add some different
looks and fiddling with some new calls,"
he said. "We've just got to concentrate
on what's happening now and forget
about last week."
With the intelligence and skill Gar
nett brings to the gridiron, it shouldn't
be too difficult a task.

said. "It's the sort of defense that forces
the offense to do certain things, an
action defense instead of a reaction
defense."

two years at inside linebacker before

moving to outside linebacker last sea
son. In 1991, he was second on the team
with 64 tackles and second in tackles
for loss, with 17 on the season.
This year, Garnett has helped the
Stanford defense become one of the
toughest in the nation. He is the only
defensive player to line up on virtually
every down and is the Cardinal's third
leading tackier, with 39 so far this year.
Garnett credits defensive coordina
tor Fred vonAppen with bringing this
year's unit together. VonAppen
bestows a "pearl of wisdom" on his
players every week, which Garnett likes
because they apply not only to football
but to life in general.
"One week he told us 'Experience is
a tough teacher. First it tests, then it
teaches,"' Garnett said. "If you think
about it, it means a lot."
Garnett has clearly spent a lot of
time thinking about the role football
plays in his life. Although he loves the
game, he has many other interests and

maintains a realistic outlook.
A political science major and avid
reader, Garnett is always on the look
out for a good book. He cited John
Grisham, Robert Ludlum and Stephen
King as some of the authors he has
been reading lately.
"I collect books," he declared. "It's
the biggest thing I buy besides food.
Right now I'm trying to control it,
though. I'm trying to avoid bookstores
and stay on my budget."
No amount of bookishness, however,
will stop Garnett from trying to play
professional football. If nothing else,
playing in the NFL would provide him
with a much larger book budget. If
things don't work out, though, he'll
probably attend law school.
"We'll see how it goes," he said. "If I
get a chance to play, I'm going to do
everything I can to make it."
Right now, Garnett is enjoying the
last year of his Stanford career. Despite
offers to live off-campus, he lives in
Faisan because he likes to stay close to
campus life.
"There's a lot more to college than
going to class and playing football," he
said.
This weekend, there won't be more
than football as Garnett and his team
mates travel to Eugene to battle the
Oregon State Beavers. Although Stan
ford enters the game a heavy favorite,
the defense has made some special
preparations for the Beavers' option
style attack.
"We're trying to add some different
looks and fiddling with some new calls,"
he said. "We've just got to concentrate
on what's happening now and forget
about last week."
With the intelligence and skill Gar
nett brings to the gridiron, it shouldn't
be too difficult a task.

To the casual observer, college foot
ball may not seem to have much to do
with the inner life of an individual.
However, it is precisely his ability to
fuse his physical and intellectual worlds
into a coherent philosophy that makes
senior outside linebacker Dave Garnett
such a unique player.
A four-year starter, Garnett has
made key plays all year and has
emerged as one of the cornerstones of
the Cardinal defense. At practice, one
minute he is on the field making the
play and the next minute he is on the
sideline discussing the pros and cons of
various formations with the coaches.
But Garnett hasn't always been a
student of the game. "I've been playing
for about 12 years now," he said.
"When I was little I liked it, but I didn't
become an avid fan until I got older."
The turning point came during his
sophomore year at North High School
near Chicago, when he was moved up
from the B-team and began getting
more playing time.
It was this first taste of success that
ignited his desire to understand his
sport. "Once you start actually playing,
you want to learn more about it,"he said.
Always a lover of good defense, Gar
nett grew up idolizing Mike Singletary
and the vaunted linebacking corps of
the 1985 Chicago Bears. Ever since, he
has brought a particular love to watch
ing defensive football.
"I tend to relate to defense more," he
said. "You can see what sort of tenacity
and chemistry are required to play
well."
Garnett credits those Chicago Bears
with bringing popularity to a defensive
style that relies on an aggressive philos

ophy. He seems pleased that the Cardi
nal defense has adopted that style and
attributes its success to this philosophy.
"Our defense is fun to watch," he
said. "It's the sort of defense that forces
the offense to do certain things, an
action defense instead of a reaction
defense."
