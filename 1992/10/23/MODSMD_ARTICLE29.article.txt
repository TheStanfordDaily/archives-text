## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Yet another conference
championship may fall into Car
dinal hands this weekend,
Stanford's second-ranked
water polo team will compete in
the Mountain Pacific Tourney
at Long Beach State University
tomorrow and Sunday.
The winner of the 16-team,
elimination tournament will
become the Mountain-Pacific
division champion and receive
an automatic invitation to the
NCAA tourney.
Eight of the top 10 teams in
the nation comprise the Moun
tain-Pacific conference, includ
ing No. 1 California, No. 2 Stan
ford, No. 3 USC, No. 4 UC-
Irvine, No. 5 Pepperdine, No. 6
UCLA, No. 7 UC-Santa Barbara
and No. 9 Long Beach State.
They will test themselves
against each another, as well as
the eight other teams, six of
which are also top-'2O caliber.
Cardinal head coach Dante
Dettamanti and his squad want
to accomplish two goals in the
tournament, along with captur
ing the divisional title and an
NCAA bid
First, they hope to use the
opportunity as practice for the
national tourney. While the
NCAAs will involve only five of
the top Californian teams, the
Mountain-Pacific event will fea
ture eight. And part of the
Mountain-Pacific confrontation
will take place at the Belmont
Plaza Pool, the site of the

national tournament.
Also, Dettamanti and his
team want to establish their
standing in their own minds.
"We're anxious to play Cal in
the finals," Dettamanti said.
"It'll show us where we stand as
far as the NCAAs go — if we
belong in first place."
Stanford is not concentrat
ing on the possible Cal
encounter, however. Dettaman
ti emphasized that the Cardi
nal's opening games have more
significance in terms of mental
preparation.
"It's more stressful to actual
ly get into the final than to play
in it," Dettamanti said. He also
recognized that Stanford's pre

liminary opponents could very
well eliminate the Cardinal.
Stanford's training regimen
has conformed to Dettamanti's
words. The Cardinal has focused
on playing against commonly
used zone defenses for the first
of the last two weeks. Only in
the past week has it practiced
against pressure defense, the
type Cal employs.
"We don't practice for
teams," Dettamanti said. "We
adjust to what an opponent
does. Besides, basic execution of
our own tactics is more impor
tant
Stanford features a basically
healthy squad, except for cap
tain Chip Blankenhorn, who

suffered a hand injury against
USC two weeks ago. The senior
sat out of scrimmages for a
week, but has played in practice
since Monday. Detlamanti said
he expects him to play in the
upcoming tournament.
"It's an inflammation
injury," Dettamanti said. "Pain
isn't going to keep him out."
Stanford's quest for the con
ference title begins Saturday
against unranked Chaminade
University of Hawaii. If all pro
ceeds according to seed in Kb, the
second-rated Cardinal will face
No. 7 UC-Santa Barbara in the
second round. No. 3 USC in the
third round and No. 1 Cal in the
finals.
