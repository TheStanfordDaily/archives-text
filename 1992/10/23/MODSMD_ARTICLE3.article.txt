# Dishes for disco lights
## Members convert eating club into new dance hall 
### Jake Dorman 
Dissatisfied with the campus party
scene, members of Stanford's Toyon eating
clubs have traded dishes for disco lights
and converted the old El Tigre eating club
into a dance hall called "Boneyard."
"The idea is to give people on campus a re
liable place to go and dance," said senior
Meghan Blake, who is the former manager of
El Tigre. "There are a lot of people who aren't
catered to. It's hard to find a place to dance."
The former Toyon eating club, which
was closed at the end of last year, has al
ready held two successful parties with no
cover charge in the last three weeks. If the
positive response continues, it will be open
for dancing on a weekly or biweekly basis,
eating club members said. The next party
is scheduled for next Friday.
"We wanted to restore the social scene
that's been lost," said eating club General
Manager Matt Puzos, a senior. "Parties are
either very exclusive or at fraternities."

The emphasis at Boneyard will be on
dancing, not drinking, organizers said.
While they will serve beer to those over 21,
Blake pointed out that one has to cross the
dance floor to get to the alcohol.
Senior Seye Iwedemi, who works as a
bouncer at the club, said drinking will not
be the focus. "It's more for people who
want to go and dance," he said.
"Times are changing," Puzos said.
"There used to be much more heavy drink
ing. Now there is a different crowd."
El Tigre was closed at the end of last year
because of an overall decline in membership
in the five Toyon eating clubs. According to
Blake, the drop was caused by the fact that
the new dorms such as Lantana, Castano
and Kimball — which replaced the Food
Service-less Manzanita trailer park — have
mandatory Food Service plans.
The dance club idea is part of an attempt
by the eating clubs to diversify their role
and buttress their falling member
ships. "This will give people a rea
son to keep us around," Blake said.
Eating club members have also
planned other social activities such
as aerobics classes, beach trips and
movie nights in order to introduce
the clubs to Stanford students.
The Toyon eating clubs, found
ed in 1897, own their own build
ings, but lease the land yearly
from the University.
The organizers expect the dance
club to have relatively low operat
ing expenses, but they said they
may establish a low cover charge in
the future to cover costs. So far
their main expenses have involved
repainting the doors, putting mir
rors on the walls and hanging a
disco ball and flashing lights.
