# Talent overflow plagues women's tennis
## 
### Quinn Moo Staff writer 
Frank Brennan can't make up his mind. But
you really can't expect him to. After all, he
must figure out what to do with ten bona fide
queens of collegiate tennis: two pre-season Ail-
Americans, the number one high school recruit
in the country, and seven other blue-chip play
ers.
"We're all excited and ready to see how far
they've come over the summer," Brennan said.
The Rolex Northwest Regional Women's
Tennis Championships, to be held today
through Monday at Stanford's Stadium Court,
should help Brennan sort out the stack of tal
ented Cardinal players.
"This is one of our stronger Rolex tour
neys," Brennan said, referring to the fact that
nine of ten Stanford players will compete. It
could well be the strongest, because Stanford
(No. 3 in the nation) boasts four of the top six
seeds in singles, and the two top seeded teams
in doubles.
"We may see a lot of intrasquad matches,"

Brennan kidded.
Laxmi Poruri and Heather Willens, ranked
second and fourth in the nation respectively,
figure to demolish their unranked first round
opponents in the field of 64. Third-seed junior
Kristine Kurth is expected to defeat her first
round opponent Kristy Smith (Fresno State).
History favors Poruri, who won the Rolex
singles title in 1991. Kylie Johnson and Emma
Woodhouse captured the doubles prize a year
ago.
But Johnson was lost to graduation, and in
1992 the Cardinal is experimenting with dou
bles combinations. Poruri and Willens repre
sent the top seed, and Beth Berris teams up
with Kurth at second seed.
Redshirt freshman Kim Shasby, ranked No.
65 in pre-season singles, returns to the Cardi
nal after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament
in her knee last season. She and Chiminello are
seeded fourth in doubles.
"We may reshuffle or keep the cards the way
they are," head coach Frank Brennan said.
The singles finalists and doubles champions
will earn automatic berths in the Rolex Nation

als, to be held in February 1993. Brennan says
he will use the Rolex tourney to observe the
team's progress, survey other teams such as
rival Cal, and "kick off" after a long off-season.
Last season the Cardinal faltered in the NCAA
semifinals and finished third, two heartbeats
away from a national title.
But Stanford has reloaded with three true
freshmen for another shot at the NCAA crown.
Berris, the top-ranked high school recruit in
the nation, will don a Stanford jersey for the
first time today in collegiate competition. She
faces Mary Innes (Nevada) in the first round of
singles.
"I'm a little nervous but this is what I've
been waiting for," Berris said.
Sonya Cotero, the youngest freshman at 17
years, will step onto Stadium Court in another
first round match with Marie Capuyan (San
Jose State).
The third freshman, Wendy Sacks, is skip
ping the Rolex tourney to rest her right rotator
cuff.
"Another week, and she would have made it
in," Brennan said.
