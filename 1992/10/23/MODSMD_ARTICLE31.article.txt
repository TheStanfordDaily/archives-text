# Stanford soccer takes on Bay Area-rival Broncos

Whether or not the No. 2 Stan
ford women's soccer team beats
No. 8 Santa Clara on Saturday
will depend on which Cardinal
squad shows up for the game.
In the past three games, Stan
ford (13-1) has sandwiched a
smooth, cleanly played victory
with two sluggish near-losses.
According to coach Berhane
Andeberhan, the difference is in
the players' approach to the con
tests. At times they don't control
their emotions and waver
between impatience and compla
cency, as they did Wednesday
against St. Mary's, he said. The
Cardinal barely won the 1-0 con
test.
"We're used to showing up and
picking up a win, but we don't do
the dirty work we need to get the
win," Andeberhan said.
"We came expecting to win. It
was almost like, 'So when are we
going to get some goals and crush
them?'" said Stanford forward
Sarah Rafanelli. "We woke up and
played better in the second half
but we can't do that against real
ly good teams."
And the 9-3-1 Broncos squad is
the kind that could upset the Car
dinal on a Stanford ofT-day. Santa
Clara did just that last year, when
the Broncos edged Stanford in its
only regular-season loss.
Although Stanford avenged the
defeat by beating the Broncos in
the NCAA tournament, Santa
Clara could pull off another upset
tomorrow if the Cardinal is unable
to find the emotional stability it
seeks.

"They get really fired up for us
and sometimes our attitude is,
'We can get more fired up, emo
tional and unstable than you,'"
Andeberhan said. "It's hard for
anyone to play in that framework
when you're that out of control."
Rafanelli agreed. "You've got to
have a passion for the game, but
you can't play solely on emotion.
You can't just run around the field
and ignore team tactics."
In preparing for the show
down, Andeberhan stressed keep
ing to the game plan and focused
on both positive and negative
aspects of recent play.
"I don't try reverse psychology
or try to scare them," he said. "I
just tell them the truth and let
them deal with it.
"I don't chastise them for a
badly played game," he added.
"The game is punishment
enough "
But Andeberhan was encour
aged by how the team fought St.
Mary's on Wednesday and domi
nated most of the second half.
"We battled very well," he said.
"It was encouraging to see that we
made sure we kept it locked up. At
least we weren't beating our
selves."
However, Santa Clara might do
the job if the Cardinal doesn't play
a steady, controlled game in an
important match for both squads.
Stanford wants to retain its top
ranking in the West Region while
Santa Clara needs a victory to pull
ahead of the Cardinal and UC-
Santa Barbara, a squad that
recently beat the Broncos. If they
lose the 11 a m contest on Satur
day, the Broncos could fall out of
NCAA contention.
