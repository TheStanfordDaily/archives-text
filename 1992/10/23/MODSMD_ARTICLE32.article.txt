# Cardinal spikers host Oregon, OSU
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
As the second-ranked Cardinal
heads into the tail end of its six
game home stand this weekend, it
might be tempted to look past its
two matches with seventh-place
Oregon and last-place Oregon
State, two teams whose total con
ference winning percentage this
year is less than Bev Oden's hit
ting average.
On the contrary, according to
Stanford head coach Don Shaw.
"We can't afford to look past
any team in this conference," Shaw
said. "Any team we play is capable
of the upset, so we always have to
be playing as well as we can."
Stanford (15-1, 8-1 in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference) will face Oregon
(6-10, 2-7 in Pac-10) tonight at
Maples Pavilion, followed by a Sat
urday night match against Oregon
State (10-9, 1-8 in Pac-10). Both
matches start at 7:30 p.m.
The Ducks travel to Stanford
after a four-game win against Ari
zona last weekend.
Sophomore outside hitter
Stephanie Warren leads Oregon
into tonight's match with 164
kills, 151 digs and 30 blocks on
the season. She recorded eight
kills and four digs against the
Cardinal on Sept. 26 when the
two teams met in Eugene.
Laßeina Woods and Gretchen
Hughes round out the Duck
attack on the outside. Hughes has
117 digs on the season, while
Woods has 122 kills and a team
leading 14 aces and 216 digs on

the season. Woods also led Ore
gon against Stanford in the
teams' last meeting, hitting .600
with nine kills and 11 digs.
"Oregon has good talent and is
good physically," Shaw said.
"They'll be a tough match for us,
especially since we haven't had
much rest over the past week."
Stanford easily handled the
Ducks in their Sept. 26 match, 15-
7, 15-8, 15-6. Senior tri-captain
Bev Oden hit .458 with 14 kills,
four digs, and a season-best three
solo blocks on the match, while
hitter Cary Wendell added 10 kills
and 12 digs and setter Carrie
Feldman hit .667 with 31 assists.
On Saturday, Oregon State
comes to town off back-to-back
losses to Arizona and Arizona
State. Shelley Smith leads the
Beaver attack with 316 kills and
33 aces on the season.
Senior middle blocker Leslie
Preiss leads the team in digs with
220, and has registered 162 kills
and 60 blocks. In their meeting
with the Cardinal on Sept. 25 in
Corvallis, Smith led the team with
10 kills and eight digs, while Preiss
added four kills and seven digs.
The Cardinal will head to
Southern California next weekend
for a showdown with No. 6 USC
and top-ranked nemesis UCLA.
The Cardinal will have a
chance to avenge its loss to UCLA
on Oct. 30, and possibly move up
to No. 1 in the polls for the first
time this year.
That would be something
sweet in the Cardinal's trick-or
treat bag this Halloween.
