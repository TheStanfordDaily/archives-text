# Field Hockey meets UOP Tigers

### Oscar Dominguez 
Name the sport that has existed on campus
since 1919, gone to the NCAA tournament five of
the last eight years, and competed successfully
with the best and most prestigious programs in
the country. Give up?
If you're like most, womens' varsity field hock
ey does not spring immediately to mind. But it
should.
"We've been very successful for the past eight
years," said head coach Sheryl Johnson. "We
always recruit team-oriented players, very dedi
cated individuals who work hard."
That hard work includes double-session prac
tices starting mid-August, more than a month
before classes start.
"Historically, women's field hockey was the
only acceptable sport for women," said Gina Bian
chini, a women's field hockey team member. "It
was and still is one of the more popular sports for
women.
Competing in the Northern Pacific (NorPac)
Conference for more than 80 years, Cardinal field
hockey has become a sport with many loyal fol
lowers.

"We have between 100 and 200 fans at every
home game," coach Johnson said. "We have sev
eral alums who bring their families as well as high
school players who are considering playing at
Stanford. Some of the players' friends come from
the dorms also."
Support has been steadily increasing, but the
women always welcome more, Trevino said. "It
makes a huge difference when we have support
out there, not only from the fans but from the
University as well."
The Cardinal squad is 3-6-1, carrying a record
of 1-1-1 into conference play, and has a good
chance of earning a berth in the NCAA Tourna
ment.
The majority of the scoring has been done by
the team's center forward, Sara Hallock, who has
scored 11 goals this season.
"We'd like the scoring to be spread out a little
more," Johnson said. "We want our wings and
mid-fielders to score also."
Opponents standing in the way include the
University of the Pacific, who they will meet
tomorrow in Stockton. Stanford will also be play
ing against an alumni squad at 2 p.m. on Sun
day.
