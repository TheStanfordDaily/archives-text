# Cardinal soccer to round up conference play against SJSU, UW
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
After a brief hiatus from conference
action, during which the Stanford men's
soccer team tied the University of San
Francisco Dons 1-1, the Cardinal will close
out conference play with matches against
San Jose State today and Washington
tomorrow.
Stanford (10-4-1, 4-1-0 in Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation action) should

have a relatively easy time pummeling a
weak San Jose team (6-7-2, 1-3-0 in MPSF
play), led by Matthew Ball and Daniel
Ortega. Both players are coming into Fri
day's game with four goals and one assist.
In spite of the San Jose State game, the
Cardinal's main focus during the weekend
will be the Washington Huskies team (8-2-
3, 4-1-0 in MPSF games), which ushers in
some of the most talented players in the
nation.
As a sophomore, Huskies' forward Erik

Penner is already topping college scoring
charts across the the nation. Presently, he
is ranked second in the NCAA Far West
Region with 11 goals and two assists.
Not to be outdone by his offensive sup
port, the Huskies' goalkeeper, junior
Dusty Hudock, rivals only UCLA's
Olympic Team-caliber goalkeeper in the
category of goals against average (GAA).
Hudock is second in the Far West
Region and third in the nation with an
0.44 GAA, while Brett Friedel of UCLA

leads with a 0.43 GAA. In addition,
Hudock's defense has shut out its oppo
nents in eight of its 13 contests thus far.
The Cardinal will counter with a more
balanced offensive attack that features the
scoring of senior midfielder Jason Vana
cour, who has seven goals and two assists,
and sophomore forward Ryan Collins, who
has registered six goals and two assists on
the year.
Trying to stop the Huskies' Penner in
the backfield will be a Stanford defense led

by senior goalkeeper and co-captain Kyle
Krpata, who is sixth in the Far West
Region with a 1.00 GAA and six shutouts
in 14 games.
Since Stanford and Washington are
presently tied for the lead in the MPSF
with identical 4-1 records in conference
action, Sunday's showdown will be for the
division crown and possibly a ticket to the
NCAA Division I Tournament.
"Sunday's game is for all or nothing,"
said senior co-captain Randy Mann.
