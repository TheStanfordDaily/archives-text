# Charges of cheating, scandal leveled in Greek FB picks battle

glory he basked in oh so long ago.
DK (if we may still call him
DK) picked all California teams,
in what can only be seen as an
attempt to land a job that is still
in the state where it never rains.
But state schools? Come on, Don.
They have more trouble balanc
ing books than you do. And you
can't buy decent shower curtains
with lOUs.
He also picked friend and co
worker Denny Green. DK picks
Denny, all California teams,
chose not to pick Harvard, of
which he is an alumnus. Bad
blood? Outstanding debts? Picked
on by the bigger, Lampoonier kids
in his freshman dorm? It would
take a far better reporter than I.
And someone with a lot of time on
his hands. Kevin Jeffery?
Which effortlessly brings us
full circle on this whole Greek
thing. Throw the losers out, I say,
and hire Paul Biddle to keep a
watch over all of them. Steel-cage,
no holds barred, winner gets Eliz
abeth.
That's what this country is all
about. Not poorly designed tropes
about cultures that know nothing
about football besides what they
see in the World League.
Keep an eye out, kids. It just
might be worse than I thought.

As this Greek thing goes on
and on like a "Facts of Life"
filmed on location, the Macedo
nians (the real ones, dammit, not
the ones in Bosnia-Herzowhatev
er) are getting uppity.
Their name, their culture,
their raison d'etre have been con
tinually mocked on these very
pages so some uptight, pre-yuppie
sports nerds can show off their
unmarketable skills.
But you may ask, how do we
know the records printed by their
names are correct? Isn't it odd
that the sports editors rise to the
top, and the one person who has
the power and the guts to disclose
their wily scheme does not? (And
putting him next to last is even
more conspicuous.)
Well, try this one on for size
and comfort: No one would ever
think to go back to last Friday's
paper (though they're still at His
tory Corner) and check people's
records against what we say they
are. Why? Because nobody cares
besides the sports nerds. So let's
let them have their fun.
This week, ex-president Donald
Kennedy joins the team of ersatz
Greeks, hoping to reprise the
