# Cardinal linksters to tee off today
## 
### Andy Collins 
Has that crushing loss to Ari
zona last Saturday got you down?
Are you feeling a void in your life
that mountains of muscle just
can't cure? Got that sniffling
sneezing-achy-stuffy-head-
haven't-studied-for-midterms
feeling? Well, look no further
than our own Stanford golf
course for help.
The lady linksters tee off today
at the Stanford golf course in their
second match of the season. Run
ning through Sunday, the 29th
Annual Stanford Women's Inter
collegiate Tournament features
the Cardinal in a battle with 14
other squads, including the top
ranked San Jose State Spartans.
Stanford is led by junior Melin
da Daniels, who placed sixth over
all at the Washington Intercolle
giate earlier this month.
Senior Martha Richards and
sophomore Jamille Jose are start
ing at second and third, respec
tively, for Stanford, after tying
for eighth in Seattle.
Freshmen Kathryn Weber, in
her first collegiate appearance,
and Vicky Strada round out the
Cardinal starting five.
Coach Tim Baldwin asserts
that the Stanford course, a 6,190-
yard par 73, is in "outstanding
condition, . . . probably the best
conditioned course that anyone
will play all year."
Such hyperbole can be
excused, for Baldwin no doubt
hopes that the home-course
advantage will help the Cardinal

improve its game from the rather
irregular play it experienced in
Seattle.
With one tournament under
their belts, however, the women
should be able to avoid many of
the bugs that prevented them
from finishing higher than third
place last week. The Cardinal fin
ished third out of a field of 18
teams at last year's Stanford
Intercollegiate.
Baldwin is disappointed, how
ever, at the lack of overall talent
this weekend. Usually "the
strongest field of the year," the
coach said this year's tournament
must compete with the NCAA
Preview match held this weekend
at the University of Georgia, also
the site of the upcoming NCAA
Championships in May of 1993.
Teams that would normally be
competing at Stanford include
UCLA, USC, SMU, Arizona State
and perennial powerhouse Ari
zona.
Therefore, Baldwin describes
the match as "strictly between
San Jose State, Tulsa, Indiana
and us." Other teams competing
this weekend include New Mexi
co, Oregon, Oregon State, Wash
ington and Washington State.
The Spartan squad, runaway
winner of last week's Washington
Intercollegiate, features senior
Tracy Hanson, who Baldwin calls
"the strongest amateur player in
the world," along with "four very,
very experienced players."
The Cardinal tees off at 10
a.m., with the full 18 holes of play
lasting for about four hours.
