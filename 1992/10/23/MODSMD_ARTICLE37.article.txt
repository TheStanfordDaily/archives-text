# Crew heads to American River
## 
### Greg Collins 
After weeks of practice and
early mornings, the men's and
women's crew teams are ready
for competition this weekend.
Both squads journey to the
Head of the American in Sacra
mento this Saturday. For the
men, this will be their second
race of the year, while it serves as
the the debut for the 1992
women's crew team.
Women's coach Wendy Davis
is looking forward to this week
end's race. "The team has a posi
tive attitude for the season, and
that's a major part of the battle,"
Davis said.
UC-Santa Barbara and UC-
Davis will be competing, and
because this is an open event,
club teams — usually consisting
of graduate students from Stan
ford and California — will also be
participating.
The women's team will be rep
resented by two eight-women
boats. At least half of the Cardi

nal squad is comprised of return
ing rowers from last year's team,
which placed second on the West
Coast. Coach Davis describes
this year's team as one without
any standouts but with a solid
core of team-oriented women.
The women's team appears
to have a good chance to stay at
the top of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence this year. Cal and perenni
al powerhouse Washington,
which swept the championships
in every event last year, look to
be the Cardinal's top competi
tion.
The men's team is looking at
the upcoming race much differ
ently than the women.
Coming off last weekend's sev
enth place finish in Boston, coach
Wieslaw Kujda sees this week
end's race as training and not
competition. Because of this, the
Cardinal is sending three even
boats of eight men apiece.
By evening out the three
boats, Kujda said he hopes to
move the focus off winning and

on to having some fun.
He added that he still wants
the physical challenge of racing
for his team, but wishes to keep
them "mellow-yellow" mentally
in preparation for the Newport
Fall Regatta on Nov. 22.
The Newport race, held in
Newport Beach, Calif., is Stan
ford's chance to go head-to-head
with Washington and Cal, two of
the conference's top teams.
The men's squad hopes to
establish a top-five caliber pro
gram this year. Coming off last
year's disappointing fourth-place
finish in Pac-10's, Stanford
hopes to use its technical superi
ority to defeat physically stronger
teams.
"Last year, we were at a tech
nological disadvantage," Kujda
said.
"In one race, the Cal team
used a new shorter oar with a big
ger blade. This new model could
cut as much as 2 percent off your
time, and Cal beat us because of
the new blade."
