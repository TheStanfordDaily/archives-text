# Cross country to run at Crystal Springs
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
The men's and women's cross country
teams head right down the road tomorrow to
Crystal Springs to participate in the Notre
Dame Invitational.
The meet consists primarily of small,
Division 111 colleges, according to assistant
coach Scott Chisam. These competitors
include Notre Dame College, Mills College,
Pomona Pitzer College, Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps Colleges and other, smaller colleges
from Northern California.
Head coach Vin Lananna describes the
Notre Dame Invitational meet as "low-key.
[We will] run all the runners who need the
race, but rest a lot of people."
In keeping with their coach's statement,
many of Stanford's top runners will be side
lined in preparation for next week's Pacific 10

Conference Championships.
On the men's side, these runners include
seniors Gary Stolz, Mike Reilly and Todd
Lewis, junior Brian McCafTery and freshman
Rob Reeder.
The resting women consist of captain Sarah
Truitt, junior Louise Watson, sophomore Kay
Luo as well as freshmen Bennie Dehlendorf
and Laura Hayward.
Last week, their performance in the Arizona
State Invitational earned Cardinal cross-coun
try runners some national recognition. The men
were able to use their impressive showing in the
desert to enter the national rankings for the
first time this year, at 26. The women, who were
already ranked No. 19, jumped two places to 17.
These rankings show the Cardinal is begin
ning to accomplish coach Lananna's goal of
"surprising some people."
This is the first time the Stanford cross
country team has been ranked in more than a

year. The team is moving up on the national
charts based "not on previous reputation, but
on hard work," according to Chisam.
The Notre Dame meet will be low key for
the Cardinal. "We will use this meet as a tune
up for Pac-10's," Lananna said.
The Pac-10 Championships loom ever closer
on the horizon, to be run Oct. 31 on the Stan
ford Golf Course. The men's race begins at 3
p.m., and the women follow at 3:45 p.m.
Although the results do not determine if a
team will attend the NCAA Championship
Meet, Pac-10's serve as a showcase for a con
ference that traditionally features some of the
best cross country teams in the nation. This
year the conference sports especially strong
teams from Arizona and Washington.
The Stanford women have never won Pac
10's, while the men last did so in 1985. The
men placed fifth last year, while the women
finished sixth.
