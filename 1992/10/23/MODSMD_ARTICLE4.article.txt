# Congressional candidates call for change, stress priorities
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Anna Eshoo and Tom Huening agree on this: It's
time for a change.
But what kind of change?
According to Eshoo, the Democratic candidate for
the 14th Congressional District seat, it's time to re
form health care, to better protect the environment,
to see more women in Congress.

For Huening, her Republican opponent, it's time
to get control of the federal budget, to reform the
House of Representatives and to weed out ineffective
bureaucracy in government.
Their battle over what kind of change the nation
needs more urgently — policy reform or fiscal reform —
lies at the heart of the race to succeed Tom Campbell as

the lower Peninsu
la's representative
in Washington.
And that battle
takes on added sig
nificance because,
in numerous other
ways, the two can
didates appear
hardly distin
guishable.
After all, both
are San Mateo
County supervi
sors. Both are pro
choice, and both
call themselves
strong environ
mentalists. And
both claim to be
agents of change
who have shaken

up local institutions and taken on political giants
from special interests to the party machines.
"If you were to go back to the Board of Supervisors
and look at our voting record, it's some place between
85 and 90 percent of our votes that are exactly the
same," Huening said in a recent interview. "Where

we differ is on fis
cal issues."
The race
in the 14th Dis
trict, which in
cludes parts of San
Mateo and Santa
Clara counties and
runs from the Pa
cific coast to San
Francisco Bay, is
among the most
closely watched in
the state this year.
After the
1990 census, Cali
fornia was award
ed seven new seats
in Congress. The
State Supreme
Court redrew the

congressional dis
tricts, throwing out many of the boundaries that had
ensured safe districts for Democrats throughout the
1980s.
Thanks to the redistricting, the general mood of
anti-incumbency and an unusually large number of
open seats, Republicans this year have a shot at taking

a majority of the California congressional delegation.
And the 14th District is one of a handful of swing dis
tricts that will determine whether that happens or not.
Campbell, a Republican and Stanford law profes
sor who gave up his seat to pursue an unsuccessful
bid for the U.S. Senate this year, beat Eshoo by 5 per
centage points in 1988 and defeated an obscure De
mocratic opponent by a much larger margin in 1990.
But the district has changed since then; reappor
tionment has given Democrats a registration edge of
48 percent to 38 percent over Republicans. Both can
didates this time around say the race will be tight.
As a result, the election has become something of a
referendum not only on the records and agendas of
the two candidates, but on their basic approaches to
government as well.
Asked why she's running for Congress, Eshoo, a
member of the Board of Supervisors since 1983,
launches into a discussion of issues. Health care tops
the list.
Eshoo, who also is president of the board of San
Mateo County's general hospital, is pushing a "man
aged care" plan that she says would guarantee uni
versal access and set cost guidelines to stem inflation
in medical care.
She talks, too, about the environment — about

banning offshore oil drilling and
construction of nuclear power
plants, about increasing fuel-effi
ciency standards for autos. And
she talks about families — about
the need for family leave, a tax
credit for children and comparable
worth laws for women.
Again and again, Eshoo talks
about her record in San Mateo
County.
"I feel prepared to serve — emi
nently prepared to serve," Eshoo
said in an interview. "I think all of
these issues are critical. They not
only demonstrate a record locally,
but what's to come. I think they
have a direct correlation to the fed
eral level, and they are in my view
the top priorities of the people of
this district."
That's where Huening dis
agrees.
"We don't even get to solve, per
haps not even work on, issues like
homelessness and joblessness and
the problems in the inner city unless

we first get control of the deficit,"
Huening said. "That problem over
shadows the other problems."
A former pilot who owns a small
investment company, Huening is
calling for a 20 percent reduction
in the deficit in each of the next
five years. He would accomplish
this by cutting or at least freezing
federal spending, cutting "pork"
legislation and restoring the
Gramm-Rudman congressional
spending restraints.
The other half of Huening's
agenda calls for reform in
Congress, including cutting its
budget by one-third, eliminating
the congressional seniority system
and reducing the number of House
committees. He also supports a
balanced budget amendment (as
does Eshoo), a presidential line
item veto and term limits for
House members.
Huening says he knows he can't
do all of that by himself. So, he has
initiated a November summit
meeting of all non-incumbent can
didates who win congressional
seats this year; 130 candidates
have already agreed to attend if
they are elected.

While critics have called the
"Omaha Summit" an election ploy,
Huening says it will offer the best
chance of shaking up Congress —
by rallying its new members
around a consensus agenda before
they get to Washington and are
swallowed up by "the system."

serve — eminently
prepared to serve.'

"Just today I had to tell a senior
Republican that he was not invited
to Omaha," Huening said.
"There's been a whole bunch, and
that's a good sign.
"I may wind up when they're
giving out office space with a card
board box on one of those grates
outside the Capitol, but I'm will
ing to take that chance because
the worst of all worlds is being
elected and then not making a dif
ference."
Eshoo says she supports the

reforms Huening is focusing on,
but adds that an exclusive focus on
them ignores what people need
from government most.
"I think the real reforms, the
biggest and most important
reforms that need to take place,
are the structural reforms that
will change the priorities of the
country and get us on the right
track," she said.
"That's the problem now.
(People aren't) getting anything
that means anything to them.
That's where I'm at my best. ... I
don't deal with just theories; I
understand that you've got to
make it work for people."
Here's where the candidates
stand on some of the mtyor issues:
• The economy: Eshoo calls
for reducing capital gains taxes,
targeted to those who invest in
business starts, and making the
research and development tax
credit permanent.
Huening favors a capital-gains
tax cut, the R&D tax credit and
other tax credits for investing and
creating new jobs. Huening has
picked up endorsements from the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and

the National Federation of Inde
pendent Business.
• The federal deficit: Eshoo
calls for a 10 percent reduction in
the deficit in each of the next five
years, to be paid for with savings
from defense cuts. Huening says
he will vote for a 20 percent
reduction for each of the next five
years, to be paid for by cutting or
at least freezing federal spending,
among other things.
• Education: Eshoo supports
expanding Head Start programs,
restructuring the college student
loan program to expand access
while guaranteeing repayment,
and creating scholarship and loan
forgiveness incentives for new
teachers.
Huening calls for lengthening
the school year, adopting national
standards tests and paying teach
ers based on how well their stu
dents perform, and providing
market-rate child care at all pub
lic schools.
• Health care: Eshoo has pro
posed a national health-care sys
tem guaranteeing access to all
while containing costs and
expanding insurance coverage to

small businesses. Huening says
he is concerned about increasing
costs and insurance availability
and has asked a panel of experts
to advise him on the issues.
• The environment: Eshoo
favors increasing auto fuel-effi
ciency standards, developing
alternative energy sources, ban
ning offshore oil drilling and pass
ing the Wetlands Reform Act. She
has been endorsed by both the
Sierra Club and the League of
Conservation Voters.
Huening also supports the
fuel-efficiency increase and oppos
es offshore oil development. He
supports a "no net loss" policy on
wetlands and supports protection
of ecologically important old
growth forests.
• National defense: Eshoo
calls for a $150 billion cut in
defense spending over the next
five years and would shift the
money to deficit reduction and
domestic investment. Huening
supports a $75 billion cut over the
same period, with 80 percent of
that going to deficit reduction and
the rest going to job training pro
grams.
Anna Eshoo and Tom Huening agree on this: It's
time for a change.

nently prepared to serve," Eshoo
said in an interview. "I think all of
these issues are critical. They not
only demonstrate a record locally,
but what's to come. I think they
have a direct correlation to the fed
eral level, and they are in my view
the top priorities of the people of
this district."
That's where Huening dis
agrees.
"We don't even get to solve, per
haps not even work on, issues like
homelessness and joblessness and
the problems in the inner city unless

we first get control of the deficit,"
Huening said. "That problem over
shadows the other problems."
A former pilot who owns a small
investment company, Huening is
calling for a 20 percent reduction
in the deficit in each of the next
five years. He would accomplish
this by cutting or at least freezing
federal spending, cutting "pork"
legislation and restoring the
Gramm-Rudman congressional
spending restraints.
The other half of Huening's
agenda calls for reform in
Congress, including cutting its
budget by one-third, eliminating
the congressional seniority system
and reducing the number of House
committees. He also supports a
balanced budget amendment (as
does Eshoo), a presidential line
item veto and term limits for
House members.
Huening says he knows he can't
do all of that by himself. So, he has
initiated a November summit
meeting of all non-incumbent can
didates who win congressional
seats this year; 130 candidates
have already agreed to attend if
they are elected.

While critics have called the
"Omaha Summit" an election ploy,
Huening says it will offer the best
chance of shaking up Congress —
by rallying its new members
around a consensus agenda before
they get to Washington and are
swallowed up by "the system."

"Just today I had to tell a senior
Republican that he was not invited
to Omaha," Huening said.
"There's been a whole bunch, and
that's a good sign.
"I may wind up when they're
giving out office space with a card
board box on one of those grates
outside the Capitol, but I'm will
ing to take that chance because
the worst of all worlds is being
elected and then not making a dif
ference."
Eshoo says she supports the

reforms Huening is focusing on,
but adds that an exclusive focus on
them ignores what people need
from government most.
"I think the real reforms, the
biggest and most important
reforms that need to take place,
are the structural reforms that
will change the priorities of the
country and get us on the right
track," she said.
"That's the problem now.
(People aren't) getting anything
that means anything to them.
That's where I'm at my best. ... I
don't deal with just theories; I
understand that you've got to
make it work for people."
Here's where the candidates
stand on some of the mtyor issues:
• The economy: Eshoo calls
for reducing capital gains taxes,
targeted to those who invest in
business starts, and making the
research and development tax
credit permanent.
Huening favors a capital-gains
tax cut, the R&D tax credit and
other tax credits for investing and
creating new jobs. Huening has
picked up endorsements from the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and

the National Federation of Inde
pendent Business.
• The federal deficit: Eshoo
calls for a 10 percent reduction in
the deficit in each of the next five
years, to be paid for with savings
from defense cuts. Huening says
he will vote for a 20 percent
reduction for each of the next five
years, to be paid for by cutting or
at least freezing federal spending,
among other things.
• Education: Eshoo supports
expanding Head Start programs,
restructuring the college student
loan program to expand access
while guaranteeing repayment,
and creating scholarship and loan
forgiveness incentives for new
teachers.
Huening calls for lengthening
the school year, adopting national
standards tests and paying teach
ers based on how well their stu
dents perform, and providing
market-rate child care at all pub
lic schools.
• Health care: Eshoo has pro
posed a national health-care sys
tem guaranteeing access to all
while containing costs and
expanding insurance coverage to

small businesses. Huening says
he is concerned about increasing
costs and insurance availability
and has asked a panel of experts
to advise him on the issues.
• The environment: Eshoo
favors increasing auto fuel-effi
ciency standards, developing
alternative energy sources, ban
ning offshore oil drilling and pass
ing the Wetlands Reform Act. She
has been endorsed by both the
Sierra Club and the League of
Conservation Voters.
Huening also supports the
fuel-efficiency increase and oppos
es offshore oil development. He
supports a "no net loss" policy on
wetlands and supports protection
of ecologically important old
growth forests.
• National defense: Eshoo
calls for a $150 billion cut in
defense spending over the next
five years and would shift the
money to deficit reduction and
domestic investment. Huening
supports a $75 billion cut over the
same period, with 80 percent of
that going to deficit reduction and
the rest going to job training pro
grams.
Anna Eshoo and Tom Huening agree on this: It's
time for a change.
But what kind of change?
According to Eshoo, the Democratic candidate for
the 14th Congressional District seat, it's time to re
form health care, to better protect the environment,
to see more women in Congress.

For Huening, her Republican opponent, it's time
to get control of the federal budget, to reform the
House of Representatives and to weed out ineffective
bureaucracy in government.
Their battle over what kind of change the nation
needs more urgently — policy reform or fiscal reform —
lies at the heart of the race to succeed Tom Campbell as

the lower Peninsu
la's representative
in Washington.
And that battle
takes on added sig
nificance because,
in numerous other
ways, the two can
didates appear
hardly distin
guishable.
After all, both
are San Mateo
County supervi
sors. Both are pro
choice, and both
call themselves
strong environ
mentalists. And
both claim to be
agents of change
who have shaken

up local institutions and taken on political giants
from special interests to the party machines.
"If you were to go back to the Board of Supervisors
and look at our voting record, it's some place between
85 and 90 percent of our votes that are exactly the
same," Huening said in a recent interview. "Where

we differ is on fis
cal issues."
The race
in the 14th Dis
trict, which in
cludes parts of San
Mateo and Santa
Clara counties and
runs from the Pa
cific coast to San
Francisco Bay, is
among the most
closely watched in
the state this year.
After the
1990 census, Cali
fornia was award
ed seven new seats
in Congress. The
State Supreme
Court redrew the

congressional dis
tricts, throwing out many of the boundaries that had
ensured safe districts for Democrats throughout the
1980s.
Thanks to the redistricting, the general mood of
anti-incumbency and an unusually large number of
open seats, Republicans this year have a shot at taking

a majority of the California congressional delegation.
And the 14th District is one of a handful of swing dis
tricts that will determine whether that happens or not.
Campbell, a Republican and Stanford law profes
sor who gave up his seat to pursue an unsuccessful
bid for the U.S. Senate this year, beat Eshoo by 5 per
centage points in 1988 and defeated an obscure De
mocratic opponent by a much larger margin in 1990.
But the district has changed since then; reappor
tionment has given Democrats a registration edge of
48 percent to 38 percent over Republicans. Both can
didates this time around say the race will be tight.
As a result, the election has become something of a
referendum not only on the records and agendas of
the two candidates, but on their basic approaches to
government as well.
Asked why she's running for Congress, Eshoo, a
member of the Board of Supervisors since 1983,
launches into a discussion of issues. Health care tops
the list.
Eshoo, who also is president of the board of San
Mateo County's general hospital, is pushing a "man
aged care" plan that she says would guarantee uni
versal access and set cost guidelines to stem inflation
in medical care.
She talks, too, about the environment — about



Anna Eshoo


Tom Huening
banning offshore oil drilling and
construction of nuclear power
plants, about increasing fuel-effi
ciency standards for autos. And
she talks about families — about
the need for family leave, a tax
credit for children and comparable
worth laws for women.
Again and again, Eshoo talks
about her record in San Mateo
County.
"I feel prepared to serve — emi
nently prepared to serve," Eshoo
said in an interview. "I think all of
these issues are critical. They not
only demonstrate a record locally,

among other things.
• Education: Eshoo supports
expanding Head Start programs,
restructuring the college student
loan program to expand access
while guaranteeing repayment,
and creating scholarship and loan
forgiveness incentives for new
teachers.
Huening calls for lengthening
the school year, adopting national
standards tests and paying teach
ers based on how well their stu
dents perform, and providing
market-rate child care at all pub
lic schools.
• Health care: Eshoo has pro
posed a national health-care sys
tem guaranteeing access to all
while containing costs and
expanding insurance coverage to

small businesses. Huening says
he is concerned about increasing
costs and insurance availability
and has asked a panel of experts
to advise him on the issues.
• The environment: Eshoo
favors increasing auto fuel-effi
ciency standards, developing
alternative energy sources, ban
ning offshore oil drilling and pass
ing the Wetlands Reform Act. She
has been endorsed by both the
Sierra Club and the League of
Conservation Voters.
Huening also supports the
fuel-efficiency increase and oppos
es offshore oil development. He
supports a "no net loss" policy on
wetlands and supports protection
of ecologically important old
growth forests.
• National defense: Eshoo
calls for a $150 billion cut in
defense spending over the next
five years and would shift the
money to deficit reduction and
domestic investment. Huening
supports a $75 billion cut over the
same period, with 80 percent of
that going to deficit reduction and
the rest going to job training pro
grams.
Anna Eshoo and Tom Huening agree on this: It's
time for a change.
But what kind of change?
According to Eshoo, the Democratic candidate for
the 14th Congressional District seat, it's time to re
form health care, to better protect the environment,
to see more women in Congress.

For Huening, her Republican opponent, it's time
to get control of the federal budget, to reform the
House of Representatives and to weed out ineffective
bureaucracy in government.
Their battle over what kind of change the nation
needs more urgently — policy reform or fiscal reform —
lies at the heart of the race to succeed Tom Campbell as

the lower Peninsu
la's representative
in Washington.
And that battle
takes on added sig
nificance because,
in numerous other
ways, the two can
didates appear
hardly distin
guishable.
After all, both
are San Mateo
County supervi
sors. Both are pro
choice, and both
call themselves
strong environ
mentalists. And
both claim to be
agents of change
who have shaken

up local institutions and taken on political giants
from special interests to the party machines.
"If you were to go back to the Board of Supervisors
and look at our voting record, it's some place between
85 and 90 percent of our votes that are exactly the
same," Huening said in a recent interview. "Where

we differ is on fis
cal issues."
The race
in the 14th Dis
trict, which in
cludes parts of San
Mateo and Santa
Clara counties and
runs from the Pa
cific coast to San
Francisco Bay, is
among the most
closely watched in
the state this year.
After the
1990 census, Cali
fornia was award
ed seven new seats
in Congress. The
State Supreme
Court redrew the

congressional dis
tricts, throwing out many of the boundaries that had
ensured safe districts for Democrats throughout the
1980s.
Thanks to the redistricting, the general mood of
anti-incumbency and an unusually large number of
open seats, Republicans this year have a shot at taking

a majority of the California congressional delegation.
And the 14th District is one of a handful of swing dis
tricts that will determine whether that happens or not.
Campbell, a Republican and Stanford law profes
sor who gave up his seat to pursue an unsuccessful
bid for the U.S. Senate this year, beat Eshoo by 5 per
centage points in 1988 and defeated an obscure De
mocratic opponent by a much larger margin in 1990.
But the district has changed since then; reappor
tionment has given Democrats a registration edge of
48 percent to 38 percent over Republicans. Both can
didates this time around say the race will be tight.
As a result, the election has become something of a
referendum not only on the records and agendas of
the two candidates, but on their basic approaches to
government as well.
Asked why she's running for Congress, Eshoo, a
member of the Board of Supervisors since 1983,
launches into a discussion of issues. Health care tops
the list.
Eshoo, who also is president of the board of San
Mateo County's general hospital, is pushing a "man
aged care" plan that she says would guarantee uni
versal access and set cost guidelines to stem inflation
in medical care.
She talks, too, about the environment — about

banning offshore oil drilling and
construction of nuclear power
plants, about increasing fuel-effi
ciency standards for autos. And
she talks about families — about
the need for family leave, a tax
credit for children and comparable
worth laws for women.
Again and again, Eshoo talks
about her record in San Mateo
County.
"I feel prepared to serve — emi
nently prepared to serve," Eshoo
said in an interview. "I think all of
these issues are critical. They not
only demonstrate a record locally,
but what's to come. I think they
have a direct correlation to the fed
eral level, and they are in my view
the top priorities of the people of
this district."
That's where Huening dis
agrees.
"We don't even get to solve, per
haps not even work on, issues like
homelessness and joblessness and
the problems in the inner city unless

we first get control of the deficit,"
Huening said. "That problem over
shadows the other problems."
A former pilot who owns a small
investment company, Huening is
calling for a 20 percent reduction
in the deficit in each of the next
five years. He would accomplish
this by cutting or at least freezing
federal spending, cutting "pork"
legislation and restoring the
Gramm-Rudman congressional
spending restraints.
The other half of Huening's
agenda calls for reform in
Congress, including cutting its
budget by one-third, eliminating
the congressional seniority system
and reducing the number of House
committees. He also supports a
balanced budget amendment (as
does Eshoo), a presidential line
item veto and term limits for
House members.
Huening says he knows he can't
do all of that by himself. So, he has
initiated a November summit
meeting of all non-incumbent can
didates who win congressional
seats this year; 130 candidates
have already agreed to attend if
they are elected.

While critics have called the
"Omaha Summit" an election ploy,
Huening says it will offer the best
chance of shaking up Congress —
by rallying its new members
around a consensus agenda before
they get to Washington and are
swallowed up by "the system."

1 feel prepared to
serve — eminently
prepared to serve.'
— Anna Eshoo

"Just today I had to tell a senior
Republican that he was not invited
to Omaha," Huening said.
"There's been a whole bunch, and
that's a good sign.
"I may wind up when they're
giving out office space with a card
board box on one of those grates
outside the Capitol, but I'm will
ing to take that chance because
the worst of all worlds is being
elected and then not making a dif
ference."
Eshoo says she supports the

reforms Huening is focusing on,
but adds that an exclusive focus on
them ignores what people need
from government most.
"I think the real reforms, the
biggest and most important
reforms that need to take place,
are the structural reforms that
will change the priorities of the
country and get us on the right
track," she said.
"That's the problem now.
(People aren't) getting anything
that means anything to them.
That's where I'm at my best. ... I
don't deal with just theories; I
understand that you've got to
make it work for people."
Here's where the candidates
stand on some of the mtyor issues:
• The economy: Eshoo calls
for reducing capital gains taxes,
targeted to those who invest in
business starts, and making the
research and development tax
credit permanent.
Huening favors a capital-gains
tax cut, the R&D tax credit and
other tax credits for investing and
creating new jobs. Huening has
picked up endorsements from the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and

the National Federation of Inde
pendent Business.
• The federal deficit: Eshoo
calls for a 10 percent reduction in
the deficit in each of the next five
years, to be paid for with savings
from defense cuts. Huening says
he will vote for a 20 percent
reduction for each of the next five
years, to be paid for by cutting or
at least freezing federal spending,
among other things.
• Education: Eshoo supports
expanding Head Start programs,
restructuring the college student
loan program to expand access
while guaranteeing repayment,
and creating scholarship and loan
forgiveness incentives for new
teachers.
Huening calls for lengthening
the school year, adopting national
standards tests and paying teach
ers based on how well their stu
dents perform, and providing
market-rate child care at all pub
lic schools.

and has asked a panel of experts
to advise him on the issues.
