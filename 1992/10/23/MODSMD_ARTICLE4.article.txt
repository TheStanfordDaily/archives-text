# Congressional candidates call for change, stress priorities
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Anna Eshoo and Tom Huening agree on this: It's
time for a change.
But what kind of change?
According to Eshoo, the Democratic candidate for
the 14th Congressional District seat, it's time to re
form health care, to better protect the environment,
to see more women in Congress.

For Huening, her Republican opponent, it's time
to get control of the federal budget, to reform the
House of Representatives and to weed out ineffective
bureaucracy in government.
Their battle over what kind of change the nation
needs more urgently — policy reform or fiscal reform —
lies at the heart of the race to succeed Tom Campbell as

the lower Peninsu
la's representative
in Washington.
And that battle
takes on added sig
nificance because,
in numerous other
ways, the two can
didates appear
hardly distin
guishable.
After all, both
are San Mateo
County supervi
sors. Both are pro
choice, and both
call themselves
strong environ
mentalists. And
both claim to be
agents of change
who have shaken

up local institutions and taken on political giants
from special interests to the party machines.
"If you were to go back to the Board of Supervisors
and look at our voting record, it's some place between
85 and 90 percent of our votes that are exactly the
same," Huening said in a recent interview. "Where

we differ is on fis
cal issues."
The race
in the 14th Dis
trict, which in
cludes parts of San
Mateo and Santa
Clara counties and
runs from the Pa
cific coast to San
Francisco Bay, is
among the most
closely watched in
the state this year.
After the
1990 census, Cali
fornia was award
ed seven new seats
in Congress. The
State Supreme
Court redrew the

congressional dis
tricts, throwing out many of the boundaries that had
ensured safe districts for Democrats throughout the
1980s.
Thanks to the redistricting, the general mood of
anti-incumbency and an unusually large number of
open seats, Republicans this year have a shot at taking

a majority of the California congressional delegation.
And the 14th District is one of a handful of swing dis
tricts that will determine whether that happens or not.
Campbell, a Republican and Stanford law profes
sor who gave up his seat to pursue an unsuccessful
bid for the U.S. Senate this year, beat Eshoo by 5 per
centage points in 1988 and defeated an obscure De
mocratic opponent by a much larger margin in 1990.
But the district has changed since then; reappor
tionment has given Democrats a registration edge of
48 percent to 38 percent over Republicans. Both can
didates this time around say the race will be tight.
As a result, the election has become something of a
referendum not only on the records and agendas of
the two candidates, but on their basic approaches to
government as well.
Asked why she's running for Congress, Eshoo, a
member of the Board of Supervisors since 1983,
launches into a discussion of issues. Health care tops
the list.
Eshoo, who also is president of the board of San
Mateo County's general hospital, is pushing a "man
aged care" plan that she says would guarantee uni
versal access and set cost guidelines to stem inflation
in medical care.
She talks, too, about the environment — about
