# 21st Assembly race remains low key
## Although they continue to tow the party line, candidates avoid mud-slinging 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
In contrast to the name-calling and
conflicts characterizing the presidential
election, the race for the 21st Assembly
District seat has been decidedly low-key,
with the two main candidates disagree
ing on issues that typically divide De
mocrats and Republicans.
Democratic incumbent Byron Sher,
an emeritus professor at the Law
School, is relying mainly on his 12-year
record of environmental legislation and
political reform, while Republican chal
lenger Janice La Fetra has emphasized
economic pragmatism, criticizing her
opponent for being "too liberal" and
"tax-and-spend."
There hasn't been much conflict on
specific issues — for instance, they're
both pro-choice — with the candidates
really disagreeing on only two of this
year's 13 ballot measures. "There is no
acrimony between us," Sher said.
But on more general themes, Sher
and La Fetra, who is a former mayor of
Menlo Park, have found themselves at
odds.
Taxing and cutting
As on the national level, the local
issue that is first in the minds of voters
is the economy. With California's seri
ous budget-balancing problem, the state
has to look at both cutting programs and
raising taxes.
La Fetra keeps firmly with the Re
publican hostility toward raising taxes,
pointing to Sher's votes in favor of rais
ing income taxes to show that her De
mocratic opponent "rarely finds a tax he

doesn't like."
While Sher agrees that he did vote for
a tax hike in 1991 — the one proposed
by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson — he
said that he is not for across-the-board
tax increases. "I've resisted all year any
increase in tax generally," he said.
He said that the times he has voted
for tax increases have been to make the
tax system more equitable, to close the
loopholes for the wealthy and to prevent
"excessive business deductions." But La
Fetra says cutting such deductions is
problematic, because those tax breaks
encourage business.

'I like Byron and
everything he stands for,
but I don't think we can
afford him any more.'
— Janice La Fetra

Nevertheless, the two both agree cuts
can be made to reduce government
waste.
Sher said there are many "useless
boards, commissions, and positions"
that need to be eliminated, while La
Fetra said she has always fought against
"excessive red tape" and regulations
since she was mayor in 1989.
They also agree that the government
should do everything possible to help
make secondary education available to
all qualified students.
But when it comes to more sensitive
areas, such as welfare, they don't agree
so readily. This has led to several de

bates over Proposition 165, the ballot
measure they disagree about the most.
The proposition would give the gov
ernor constitutional powers to cut
spending in a "fiscal emergency" and
would reform certain welfare programs
by reducing benefits.
Sher said he is against the measure
because it gives the governor too much
power and will cut too much of the
money going to poor children. La Fetra
agreed that the bill could be damaging,
but said, "We have to start somewhere,
with some reform."
She said her vote will be "reluctant,"
though, because while she likes the idea of
welfare reform, the"the pluses (in the bill)
only slightly outnumber the minuses."
Another area they dispute concern
ing possible programs cuts is the issue
Sher is best known for — the environ
ment.
The environment and the economy
In this campaign, Sher has relied
heavily on his record, especially focus
ing attention on the environmental leg
islation he's helped pass.
"I hope that people think I've done a
good job and see that I care about the en
vironment and public education," he
said.
Sher, who has been endorsed by the
California League of Conservation Vot
ers and the Sierra Club of California, is
one of the state legislature's most
prominent environmentalists, author
ing such bills as the 1983 Groundwater
Protection Act and the 1988 California
Clean Air Act, which required districts
to reduce air pollution in their areas by
