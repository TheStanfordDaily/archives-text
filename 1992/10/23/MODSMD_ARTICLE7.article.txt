# 21st Assembly race remains low key
## Although they continue to tow the party line, candidates avoid mud-slinging 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
In contrast to the name-calling and
conflicts characterizing the presidential
election, the race for the 21st Assembly
District seat has been decidedly low-key,
with the two main candidates disagree
ing on issues that typically divide De
mocrats and Republicans.
Democratic incumbent Byron Sher,
an emeritus professor at the Law
School, is relying mainly on his 12-year
record of environmental legislation and
political reform, while Republican chal
lenger Janice La Fetra has emphasized
economic pragmatism, criticizing her
opponent for being "too liberal" and
"tax-and-spend."
There hasn't been much conflict on
specific issues — for instance, they're
both pro-choice — with the candidates
really disagreeing on only two of this
year's 13 ballot measures. "There is no
acrimony between us," Sher said.
But on more general themes, Sher
and La Fetra, who is a former mayor of
Menlo Park, have found themselves at
odds.
Taxing and cutting
As on the national level, the local
issue that is first in the minds of voters
is the economy. With California's seri
ous budget-balancing problem, the state
has to look at both cutting programs and
raising taxes.
La Fetra keeps firmly with the Re
publican hostility toward raising taxes,
pointing to Sher's votes in favor of rais
ing income taxes to show that her De
mocratic opponent "rarely finds a tax he

doesn't like."
While Sher agrees that he did vote for
a tax hike in 1991 — the one proposed
by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson — he
said that he is not for across-the-board
tax increases. "I've resisted all year any
increase in tax generally," he said.
He said that the times he has voted
for tax increases have been to make the
tax system more equitable, to close the
loopholes for the wealthy and to prevent
"excessive business deductions." But La
Fetra says cutting such deductions is
problematic, because those tax breaks
encourage business.

'I like Byron and
everything he stands for,
but I don't think we can
afford him any more.'
— Janice La Fetra

Nevertheless, the two both agree cuts
can be made to reduce government
waste.
Sher said there are many "useless
boards, commissions, and positions"
that need to be eliminated, while La
Fetra said she has always fought against
"excessive red tape" and regulations
since she was mayor in 1989.
They also agree that the government
should do everything possible to help
make secondary education available to
all qualified students.
But when it comes to more sensitive
areas, such as welfare, they don't agree
so readily. This has led to several de

bates over Proposition 165, the ballot
measure they disagree about the most.
The proposition would give the gov
ernor constitutional powers to cut
spending in a "fiscal emergency" and
would reform certain welfare programs
by reducing benefits.
Sher said he is against the measure
because it gives the governor too much
power and will cut too much of the
money going to poor children. La Fetra
agreed that the bill could be damaging,
but said, "We have to start somewhere,
with some reform."
She said her vote will be "reluctant,"
though, because while she likes the idea of
welfare reform, the"the pluses (in the bill)
only slightly outnumber the minuses."
Another area they dispute concern
ing possible programs cuts is the issue
Sher is best known for — the environ
ment.
The environment and the economy
In this campaign, Sher has relied
heavily on his record, especially focus
ing attention on the environmental leg
islation he's helped pass.
"I hope that people think I've done a
good job and see that I care about the en
vironment and public education," he
said.
Sher, who has been endorsed by the
California League of Conservation Vot
ers and the Sierra Club of California, is
one of the state legislature's most
prominent environmentalists, author
ing such bills as the 1983 Groundwater
Protection Act and the 1988 California
Clean Air Act, which required districts
to reduce air pollution in their areas by
five percent every year until they
reach state standards.
According to the California
Public Interest Research Group,
Sher was the only California legis
lator in 1985 to get a perfect score
when it came to the environment,
government reform and fighting
for consumers.
But La Fetra says that Sher's
environmental legislation has been
anti-business and pro-government
regulation.
"He doesn't realize how much
he's hurting the state economy,"
she said, adding that all the
demands on business in California
are pushing the little businesses —
and consequently, many jobs —
out of the state.
"I like Byron and everything

that he stands for, but I don't
think we can afford him anymore,"
La Fetra said, criticizing Sher's
1989 Waste Management Act as
too expensive.
The act requires cities and
counties to reduce or recycle 25
percent of the solid waste in their
landfills by 1995 and half of it by
the end of the century.
La Fetra said recycling is cost
ing much more than these areas
can afford to spend, saying "some
times you have to be reasonable
.... We should use the landfills
until we have cheaper ways" of
recycling, she said.
Changes in the district
Because of his popularity and the
large number of Democrats in the
district, Sher has usually had an
easy time winning the assembly seat
— once getting as much as 87.8 per
cent of the vote — against unknown
and unfinanced opponents.

But with changes in the assem
bly district and the national feeing

against incum
bents, Sher will
have a more diffi
cult time this year.
The assembly seat
still represents
Stanford and Palo
Alto, but it has
lost Mountain
View and Sunny
vale and picked up

other cities, including Menlo Park
and Los Altos.
Losing those 150,000 voters
and gaining 200,000 new ones
means that Sher will have a hard
er time simply because these new
voters are not familiar with him.
La Fetra's chances are also bol
stered by the fact that the moder
ate Republican woman is — in
Sher's words — "not an incum
bent, in the year of the woman."
"It's not an advantage to be an

incumbent this year," Sher said,
pointing to tlk large turnover of

incumbent candi
dates at the
national level.
La Fetra
knows what that
means for the
election. "It's
winnable," she
said, adding that
her chances "have
gone from the

unthinkable to the possible."
To deal with this more challeng
ing opponent, Sher said he will be
spending a lot more money on the
campaign than he has in previous
years — up to $200,000.
Although it may not be a good
year to be an incumbent, it's also
"not a good year to be a Republi
can," La Fetra said, and both can
didates will be pushing hard with
in the next two weeks to make
themselves known in the district.

With the high cost of radio and
television advertising, the two
candidates have been campaign
ing mostly through ads in local
newspapers, mailings and several
candidate forums which allow the
two to discuss the issues in a pub
lic arena.
Door-to-door district walking is
also part of the campaign. Sher
said interested students from his
classes have sometimes volun
teered to walk with him.
La Fetra, who graduated from
Stanford in 1954, said she will
probably be spending only about
$22,000 on her campaign, mean
ing that she will not be able to
advertise as much as Sher will.
"The fact that ISher] can do a
district-wide mailing means that
he is going to get to that many
more voters," she said. "It is an
uphill battle when you're not the
incumbent and don't have enough
money."
