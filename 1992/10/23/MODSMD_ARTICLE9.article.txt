# Hi-tech challenges journalists
## Prof warns of declining role of media in presidential elections 
### Greg Miller 
Talk shows, satellites and 1-800 numbers are
bypassing journalists during this year's presidential
campaign, Assoc. Communication Prof. Jeremy
Cohen warned Sterling Quad residents during a dis
cussion last night.
"This (campaign represents) the best manipula
tion of the press you could hope for, if you're a cam
paign manager," Cohen said. "I don't want to be
interviewed by Nina Totenberg if I can be inter
viewed by Phil Donahue."

'The real story is Clinton's record
as governor and Bush's actions
as president.'
— Jeremy Cohen

Taking part in Adams' quarter-long program
series on decision making, Cohen cited the success of
former California Gov. Jerry Brown's 1-800 number
and Democratic nominee Bill Clinton's numerous
talk show appearances as examples of the evolution
of presidential campaigning.
"This is the first time that high technology, other
than television, is playing a big part in the election,"
Cohen said. "People are more comfortable, and they
like that journalists are getting a back seat, but what
does it do to the knowledge level?"
Pointing to the second presidential debate, in
which candidates responded to questions posed by a

studio audience, Cohen said candidates were able to
detail their proposals without fear of cross-examina
tion by journalists who may be more familiar with
the proposals' flaws.
But Cyndi Robison, a senior majoring in human
biology, argued that many people feel overburdened
by journalists' extensive delineation of issues and
proposals.
"I think it gives most of the citizens the informa
tion they want," Robison said of the format of the
second debate. "Otherwise people just say, 'We don't
have time to deal with it and we don't want to deal
with it."'
Cohen also discussed the candidates' use of satel
lite and fax technology to thwart attacks from oppo
nents.
"Faxed responses to attacks have really put a
dent in the ability to use negative campaigning,"
Cohen said. "An attack at 4 p.m. can be handled with
a response in 15 minutes, before the evening news
casts."
Many problems of election coverage, including
"horse-race" stories, result from requiring campaign
reporters to file a new story every day, Cohen said.
"The real news is not in the daily interview,"
Cohen said. "The real story is Clinton's record as
governor and Bush's actions as president. But
researching these stories takes too much time and
costs too much money."
Cohen did not predict a future for the press that
would allow for more thorough coverage.
"I think the most interesting question is whether
direct access. . . is the future of campaigning,"
Cohen said. "My guess is we're going to see more
and more. That, to me, is a real danger."
