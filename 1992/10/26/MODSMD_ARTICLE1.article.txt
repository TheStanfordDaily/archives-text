# Meanwhile, back on the Farm...
## Campbell returns to teaching after defeat in June primary 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Four months after losing the U.S.
Senate primary nearly everyone be
lieved he would win, Tom Campbell
is back in his Stanford office, doing
his best to convince visitors that
there's no place he'd rather be.
The two-term congressman had
fully expected to be spending these
last October days elsewhere: on the
campaign trail, battling for last
minute votes in a high-profile race
with Democrat Barbara Boxer.

Instead, he's preparing lectures
and meeting with students from his
public policy class in the Law School
while the man who snatched the
nomination away from him — a man
who stands for many of the things
Campbell strongly opposes — strug
gles in an effort to win the Senate
seat Campbell knows could have
been his.
But here he is, putting the best
possible face on his situation. With
the boyish smile and earnest tone
that have become his trademark,
Campbell skirts questions about his
own political future, insisting he's
happy being a professor. He says he
has no regrets about giving up his
House seat to run for the Senate and
notes that losing gave him extra time
to work on important legislation.
Still, beneath all the upbeat talk,

Campbell reveals that his four years
as a public servant have marked him.
He's still rankled by some of the tac
tics his opponents used against him in
the Senate campaign. And he's wor
ried, more generally, that his party is
headed in the wrong direction.
"I am concerned about the right
ward drift of the Republican Party,"
Campbell said in a recent interview.
"I'm concerned about the Pat
Robertson organization, and I'm also
concerned that if Gov. Clinton wins
for president — which I hope he
doesn't — the radical right will ex
plain the outcome as due to George
Bush not being right-wing enough."
Robertson's organization, a lobby
ing group called the Christian Coali
tion, is wielding sizeable influence in
a number of state Republican organi
zations this year, attempting to pro
duce a massive vote by evangelical
Christians.
Campbell, who supports abortion
rights and who has been viewed as
one of the most moderate members of
the California Republican congres
sional delegation, said he is worried
both by Robertson's growing influ
ence and by the far-right positions
taken by his party at the Republican
National Convention last August.
So, instead of preparing another
run at elective office, Campbell is
planning a new political venture: a
national committee that will raise
funds for moderate Republican can
didates committed to bringing a pro
abortion rights plank to the party
platform. He plans a formal an
nouncement with more details the
week after the election.
But Campbell emphasized that his
own "terribly disappointing" and
"surprising" loss to TV commentator
Bruce Herschensohn in the June pri
mary shouldn't be explained as the
product of increasing support for the

far right in California. It was, he said,
more of a loss caused by the third Re
publican candidate, Sonny Bono.
"I didn't realize it at the time, but
in retrospect, I'm convinced that the
outcome was decided the day Sonny
Bono entered the race," Campbell
said. "(The defeat) was not a repudia
tion of being a pro-choice, pro-envi
ronment fiscal conservative."
Herschensohn, a far-right Repub
lican who favors repealing the Endan
gered Species Act, supports offshore
oil drilling and would dismantle the

federal Education Department and
other agencies, won 38 percent of the
primary vote to Campbell's 36 per
cent. Bono, the singer and former
Palm Springs mayor, took 16 percent.
Campbell said he knew Herschen
sohn would have strong support from
conservatives, especially in Southern
California, but didn't count on Bono
taking much of the vote. "If we had a
runoff, I think I would be the nomi
nee," Campbell said.
