## Campbell returns to teaching after defeat in June primary 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Four months after losing the U.S.
Senate primary nearly everyone be
lieved he would win, Tom Campbell
is back in his Stanford office, doing
his best to convince visitors that
there's no place he'd rather be.
The two-term congressman had
fully expected to be spending these
last October days elsewhere: on the
campaign trail, battling for last
minute votes in a high-profile race
with Democrat Barbara Boxer.

Instead, he's preparing lectures
and meeting with students from his
public policy class in the Law School
while the man who snatched the
nomination away from him — a man
who stands for many of the things
Campbell strongly opposes — strug
gles in an effort to win the Senate
seat Campbell knows could have
been his.
But here he is, putting the best
possible face on his situation. With
the boyish smile and earnest tone
that have become his trademark,
Campbell skirts questions about his
own political future, insisting he's
happy being a professor. He says he
has no regrets about giving up his
House seat to run for the Senate and
notes that losing gave him extra time
to work on important legislation.
Still, beneath all the upbeat talk,

Campbell reveals that his four years
as a public servant have marked him.
He's still rankled by some of the tac
tics his opponents used against him in
the Senate campaign. And he's wor
ried, more generally, that his party is
headed in the wrong direction.
"I am concerned about the right
ward drift of the Republican Party,"
Campbell said in a recent interview.
"I'm concerned about the Pat
Robertson organization, and I'm also
concerned that if Gov. Clinton wins
for president — which I hope he
doesn't — the radical right will ex
plain the outcome as due to George
Bush not being right-wing enough."
Robertson's organization, a lobby
ing group called the Christian Coali
tion, is wielding sizeable influence in
a number of state Republican organi
zations this year, attempting to pro
duce a massive vote by evangelical
Christians.
Campbell, who supports abortion
rights and who has been viewed as
one of the most moderate members of
the California Republican congres
sional delegation, said he is worried
both by Robertson's growing influ
ence and by the far-right positions
taken by his party at the Republican
National Convention last August.
So, instead of preparing another
run at elective office, Campbell is
planning a new political venture: a
national committee that will raise
funds for moderate Republican can
didates committed to bringing a pro
abortion rights plank to the party
platform. He plans a formal an
nouncement with more details the
week after the election.
But Campbell emphasized that his
own "terribly disappointing" and
"surprising" loss to TV commentator
Bruce Herschensohn in the June pri
mary shouldn't be explained as the
product of increasing support for the

far right in California. It was, he said,
more of a loss caused by the third Re
publican candidate, Sonny Bono.
"I didn't realize it at the time, but
in retrospect, I'm convinced that the
outcome was decided the day Sonny
Bono entered the race," Campbell
said. "(The defeat) was not a repudia
tion of being a pro-choice, pro-envi
ronment fiscal conservative."
Herschensohn, a far-right Repub
lican who favors repealing the Endan
gered Species Act, supports offshore
oil drilling and would dismantle the

federal Education Department and
other agencies, won 38 percent of the
primary vote to Campbell's 36 per
cent. Bono, the singer and former
Palm Springs mayor, took 16 percent.
Campbell said he knew Herschen
sohn would have strong support from
conservatives, especially in Southern
California, but didn't count on Bono
taking much of the vote. "If we had a
runoff, I think I would be the nomi
nee," Campbell said.

Law Prof. Tom Campbell takes a break from teaching to read the Stanford
Law Review. After his defeat in the U.S. Senate primary, Campbell said he
is concerned about the future of the Republican Party.
But he's not — and Herschen
sohn is having trouble appealing to
the broad base of voters he will
need to win the Senate election
next Tuesday. While he has cut
into Boxer's substantial lead some
what, polls still show him trailing
by about 11 points.
And while Campbell endorsed
Herschensohn after the primary,
wanting to maintain party unity,
he's hardly a supporter.
Asked what he thinks of Her
schensohn, Campbell replied by
not talking about him: "I will say
that I've worked very hard for
John Seymour (who is running for
California's other Senate seat),
and that I'm very comfortable with
Sen. Seymour's approach to his
office. I chose to give back to my
party by trying to help John Sey
mour, and so — I think that's
answering the question."
What are Herschensohn's

chances of winning? "I'm not
going to respond on that. I wish to
be loyal, so I'm not going to com
ment," Campbell said.
Not only does Campbell pro
foundly disagree with Herschen
sohn on almost every social issue,
he insists that Herschensohn lied
about his record during the prima
ry campaign. Herschensohn,
Campbell said, took his reputation
as a consensus-seeker in the House
of Representatives, highlighted a
few key votes on which he split with
Republicans, and ended up painting
him as a liberal.
But Campbell admits he could
have done more to thwart that
strategy.
"In tone, had I emphasized the
fiscal conservative aspects earlier
and stronger, there perhaps would
have been less ammunition for
Herschensohn to use," he said.
"On the issues, I still would have
been yes on civil rights, yes on
desert protection, and no on off
shore drilling, but the packaging
was such that I allowed him to say
I was out of step."

In addition, Campbell said, he
shouldn't have tried so hard to
defend himself against his oppo
nents' attacks in the debates.
"Bono generally tried to attack
me for being an incumbent — he
used the phrase that I was a 'pig at
the trough' — and Herschensohn
attacked me for being a liberal,"
Campbell said. "What I should
have done probably was to say,
'Let's skip the labels and skip the
name calling."
But Campbell remains proud
that he stated his positions on
social issues forcefully — some
thing he believes Republicans
must do more often if they are to
retain broad-based support.
" 'Pro-choice' was the first word
out of my mouth in my television
ads. I was taking some very clear
ground," he said. "Other candi
dates have tried to fudge it many
times by saying they were against
abortion personally but that it was
a matter for the courts. That's a
great waffle."
Here, he slips in one of his few,
muted criticisms of President

Bush: "Or, 'I'm for civil rights but
against quotas,' that's a great one,"
Campbell said. "I truly believe that
the Republican Party is better from
the point of expanding opportunity
in this country, but if you are con
stantly vetoing civil rights bills, you
have a credibility problem."
Campbell, however, generally
expressed strong support for Bush
in his re-election bid.
"He's a great leader, and he
showed tremendous resolve in the
Persian Gulf," Campbell said. "I
wished that the economy had done
better, and that the president had
been better advised on the econo
my, and I think we could have
done mqjor things to turn the
recession around sooner, but
that's in the nature of helpful crit
icism," he said.
Campbell, who has been a pro
fessor in the Law School since
1983, unseated the 12th District's
Republican incumbent in the 1988
House primary and went on to
defeat Democratic challenger
Anna Eshoo. He was re-elected by
a wide margin in 1990.

in this country, but if you are con
stantly vetoing civil rights bills, you

Campbell, however, generally
expressed strong support for Bush
in his re-election bid.
"He's a great leader, and he

been better advised on the econo

done mqjor things to turn the

that's in the nature of helpful crit

Campbell, who has been a pro
fessor in the Law School since
1983, unseated the 12th District's
Republican incumbent in the 1988

a wide margin in 1990.
Four months after losing the U.S.
Senate primary nearly everyone be
lieved he would win, Tom Campbell
is back in his Stanford office, doing
his best to convince visitors that
there's no place he'd rather be.
The two-term congressman had
fully expected to be spending these
last October days elsewhere: on the
campaign trail, battling for last
minute votes in a high-profile race
with Democrat Barbara Boxer.

Instead, he's preparing lectures
and meeting with students from his
public policy class in the Law School
while the man who snatched the
nomination away from him — a man
who stands for many of the things
Campbell strongly opposes — strug
gles in an effort to win the Senate
seat Campbell knows could have
been his.
But here he is, putting the best
possible face on his situation. With
the boyish smile and earnest tone
that have become his trademark,
Campbell skirts questions about his
own political future, insisting he's
happy being a professor. He says he
has no regrets about giving up his
House seat to run for the Senate and
notes that losing gave him extra time
to work on important legislation.
Still, beneath all the upbeat talk,

Campbell reveals that his four years
as a public servant have marked him.
He's still rankled by some of the tac
tics his opponents used against him in
the Senate campaign. And he's wor
ried, more generally, that his party is
headed in the wrong direction.
"I am concerned about the right
ward drift of the Republican Party,"
Campbell said in a recent interview.
"I'm concerned about the Pat
Robertson organization, and I'm also
concerned that if Gov. Clinton wins
for president — which I hope he
doesn't — the radical right will ex
plain the outcome as due to George
Bush not being right-wing enough."
Robertson's organization, a lobby
ing group called the Christian Coali
tion, is wielding sizeable influence in
a number of state Republican organi
zations this year, attempting to pro
duce a massive vote by evangelical
Christians.
Campbell, who supports abortion
rights and who has been viewed as
one of the most moderate members of
the California Republican congres
sional delegation, said he is worried
both by Robertson's growing influ
ence and by the far-right positions
taken by his party at the Republican
National Convention last August.
So, instead of preparing another
run at elective office, Campbell is
planning a new political venture: a
national committee that will raise
funds for moderate Republican can
didates committed to bringing a pro
abortion rights plank to the party
platform. He plans a formal an
nouncement with more details the
week after the election.
But Campbell emphasized that his
own "terribly disappointing" and
"surprising" loss to TV commentator
Bruce Herschensohn in the June pri
mary shouldn't be explained as the
product of increasing support for the

far right in California. It was, he said,
more of a loss caused by the third Re
publican candidate, Sonny Bono.
"I didn't realize it at the time, but
in retrospect, I'm convinced that the
outcome was decided the day Sonny
Bono entered the race," Campbell
said. "(The defeat) was not a repudia
tion of being a pro-choice, pro-envi
ronment fiscal conservative."
Herschensohn, a far-right Repub
lican who favors repealing the Endan
gered Species Act, supports offshore
oil drilling and would dismantle the

federal Education Department and
other agencies, won 38 percent of the
primary vote to Campbell's 36 per
cent. Bono, the singer and former
Palm Springs mayor, took 16 percent.
Campbell said he knew Herschen
sohn would have strong support from
conservatives, especially in Southern
California, but didn't count on Bono
taking much of the vote. "If we had a
runoff, I think I would be the nomi
nee," Campbell said.



Victor Cheng — Daily
Law Prof. Tom Campbell takes a break from teaching to read the Stanford
Law Review. After his defeat in the U.S. Senate primary, Campbell said he
is concerned about the future of the Republican Party.
But he's not — and Herschen
sohn is having trouble appealing to
the broad base of voters he will
need to win the Senate election
next Tuesday. While he has cut
into Boxer's substantial lead some
what, polls still show him trailing
by about 11 points.
And while Campbell endorsed
Herschensohn after the primary,
wanting to maintain party unity,
he's hardly a supporter.
Asked what he thinks of Her
schensohn, Campbell replied by
not talking about him: "I will say
that I've worked very hard for
John Seymour (who is running for
California's other Senate seat),
and that I'm very comfortable with
Sen. Seymour's approach to his
office. I chose to give back to my
party by trying to help John Sey
mour, and so — I think that's
answering the question."
What are Herschensohn's

chances of winning? "I'm not
going to respond on that. I wish to
be loyal, so I'm not going to com
ment," Campbell said.
Not only does Campbell pro
foundly disagree with Herschen
sohn on almost every social issue,
he insists that Herschensohn lied
about his record during the prima
ry campaign. Herschensohn,
Campbell said, took his reputation
as a consensus-seeker in the House
of Representatives, highlighted a
few key votes on which he split with
Republicans, and ended up painting
him as a liberal.
But Campbell admits he could
have done more to thwart that
strategy.
"In tone, had I emphasized the
fiscal conservative aspects earlier
and stronger, there perhaps would
have been less ammunition for
Herschensohn to use," he said.
"On the issues, I still would have
been yes on civil rights, yes on
desert protection, and no on off
shore drilling, but the packaging
was such that I allowed him to say
I was out of step."

In addition, Campbell said, he
shouldn't have tried so hard to
defend himself against his oppo
nents' attacks in the debates.
"Bono generally tried to attack
me for being an incumbent — he
used the phrase that I was a 'pig at
the trough' — and Herschensohn
attacked me for being a liberal,"
Campbell said. "What I should
have done probably was to say,
'Let's skip the labels and skip the
name calling."
But Campbell remains proud
that he stated his positions on
social issues forcefully — some
thing he believes Republicans
must do more often if they are to
retain broad-based support.
" 'Pro-choice' was the first word
out of my mouth in my television
ads. I was taking some very clear
ground," he said. "Other candi
dates have tried to fudge it many
times by saying they were against
abortion personally but that it was
a matter for the courts. That's a
great waffle."
Here, he slips in one of his few,
muted criticisms of President

Bush: "Or, 'I'm for civil rights but
against quotas,' that's a great one,"
Campbell said. "I truly believe that
the Republican Party is better from
the point of expanding opportunity
in this country, but if you are con
stantly vetoing civil rights bills, you
have a credibility problem."

have done probably was to say,
'Let's skip the labels and skip the
name calling."
But Campbell remains proud
that he stated his positions on
social issues forcefully — some
thing he believes Republicans
must do more often if they are to
retain broad-based support.
" 'Pro-choice' was the first word
out of my mouth in my television
ads. I was taking some very clear
ground," he said. "Other candi
dates have tried to fudge it many
times by saying they were against
abortion personally but that it was
a matter for the courts. That's a
great waffle."
Here, he slips in one of his few,
muted criticisms of President

Bush: "Or, 'I'm for civil rights but
against quotas,' that's a great one,"
Campbell said. "I truly believe that
the Republican Party is better from
the point of expanding opportunity
in this country, but if you are con
stantly vetoing civil rights bills, you
have a credibility problem."
Campbell, however, generally
expressed strong support for Bush
in his re-election bid.
"He's a great leader, and he
showed tremendous resolve in the
Persian Gulf," Campbell said. "I
wished that the economy had done
better, and that the president had
been better advised on the econo
my, and I think we could have
done mqjor things to turn the
recession around sooner, but
that's in the nature of helpful crit
icism," he said.
Campbell, who has been a pro
fessor in the Law School since
1983, unseated the 12th District's
Republican incumbent in the 1988
House primary and went on to
defeat Democratic challenger
Anna Eshoo. He was re-elected by
a wide margin in 1990.
