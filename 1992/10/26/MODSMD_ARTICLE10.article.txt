BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -
President Bush yesterday signed
into law a bill providing the for
mer Soviet Union with $410 mil
lion in U.S. assistance and under
writing billions of dollars more in
international aid.
The measure also provides
assistance for the destruction of
nuclear weapons in Russia and
other former Soviet states and for
the conversion of military facilities

to peaceful uses.
In a statement issued as he
began a nine-day campaign trip,
Bush said the bill demonstrates
the U.S. commitment to democra
cy and free markets in the former
Soviet Union. The bill had been
stalled in Congress for months
amid arguments that the deficit
ridden United States should
spend money on its own problems
before giving aid overseas.

"Once again, the American peo
ple have united to advance the caus
es of freedom, to win the peace, to
help transform former enemies
into peaceful partners," Bush said.
The bill authorizes $410 million
in direct U.S. assistance for human
itarian purposes, improvement of
food distribution systems, health
and human services programs,
civilian nuclear reactor safety and
environmental problems.
