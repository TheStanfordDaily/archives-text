## Escape from myopia 
### 
Boxer is the safest choice
now that most agree that
changes need to be made

IN CONTRAST TO MANY of
this year's races featuring car
bon-copy candidates "oppos
ing" one another, the contest for
California's six-year U.S. Senate
seat is a battle between two polar
opposites: Barbara Boxer and
Bruce Herschensohn. Their stark
differences give the public a real
choice, and the choice should be a
clear one: Boxer.
Myopic might be too gentle a
term for Herschensohn, whose
proposals epitomize the short
sighted vision that for too long has
informed policy in this country,
leaving "this mess" for which no
one is willing to take the blame.
Examples of Herschensohn's
short-ranging vision are painfully
abundant. For instance, in spite of
the fact that the Cold War is over,
he opposes any cuts in the Defense
Department, and in the primaries
even advocated an increase in
defense spending.
He continues to support the
Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star
Wars") and the Stealth bomber in
the face of their rapidly impending
obsolescence, demonstrating a
complete denial of reality. It is
almost universally acknowledged
that this country needs to acceler
ate its transition to a peacetime
economy, and maintaining defense
spending at current levels is entire
ly antithetical to this objective.
Furthermore, in spite of the fact
that America's education system
now rates a pathetic 21st in the
world, Herschensohn favors elimi
nating the U.S. Department of
Education in order to balance the
federal budget. Again, he seems
willing to shortchange this coun
try's future; if Herschensohn's
educational vision is realized, the
budget may be balanced, but an
entire generation of Americans

may not know how to balance their
checkbooks.
Adding insult to injury, Her
schensohn also favors sacrificing
the environment for short-term
economic interests. He opposes
policy that would require tougher
automobile fuel-efficiency stan
dards, favors oil drilling off the
California coast, would abolish the
Department of Energy and would
set a date for the elimination of the
Environmental Protection Agency
and its regulations. He also oppos
es the Endangered Species Act.
In stark contrast, Boxer demon
strates the long-range vision this
country has been lacking. She says
she'll aggressively push for the
federal government to spur the
development of an economy less
dependent on defense spending.
Instead of maintaining the sta
tus quo, i.e. the defense industry,
Boxer supports reduced capital
gains tax rates for entrepreneurial
investments and tax credits for job
creation and research and develop
ment. She advocates $150 billion
in defense spending cuts over five
years, and would push allies like
Germany and Japan to pay for
their own defense.
Boxer also has demonstrated
her commitment to preserving the
environment, authoring legisla
tion protecting the California coast
from oil drilling and supporting an
energy policy that would require
tougher auto fuel-efficiency stan
dards. She supports the Endan
gered Species Act as well as Sen.
Alan Cranston's proposed Desert
Protection Act.
At long last, Americans seem
ready to plan for 10 years ahead
instead of 10 minutes. Deteriorat
ing infrastructure, lagging schools
and outmoded industries are con
tributing to the country's rapid
and steady decline — and everyone
seems to agree that changes have
to be made.
Everyone, that is, except Bruce
Herschensohn. A vote for him is a
vote for the past. A vote for Bar
bara Boxer is an investment in our
collective future.
