## White, male, reasonable 
### 
I'M NOT JUST A STRAIGHT white
male — I'm a fully-abled, upper
middle class, heterosexual white
Christian male. European? Ha! Try
Anglo-Saxon. The closest my relatives
come to speaking a foreign language is
calling soccer "football." Anti-discrimi
nation laws should mention me by
name.
Despite these damning demograph
ics, though, I'm a pretty fair and rea
sonable guy. Historically, my American
ancestors oppressed just about every
one they could get their hands on. But
I'm honestly sorry that it happened. I'm
sorry that they slaughtered Native
Americans, enslaved Africans, refused
the vote to women and the like.
But we need to separate those who
actually commit the crimes from those
who simply share their characteristics.
Everyone agrees that it was wrong for
America to punish Japanese-Americans
during the 1940s simply because we
were fighting their distant relatives.
Think about that, while you go to battle
with mine.
I'm a descendant of people who used
to discriminate and look like many oth
ers who currently do. There are those
who will take one look at my race, sex,
sexual orientation or whatever and
decide that, no matter what my person
ality is, I'm their problem. Why?
That question must sound supremely

ironic, since my ancestors judged many
of your ancestors in exactly the same
way. A lot of bitterness has carried over
since then, leading to strict divisions
between races, genders and cultures.
But we are not our grandparents. We
can and absolutely should use their
experiences and mistakes as an oppor
tunity to grow stronger together — not
as an excuse to become even more divi
sive.
Do we really want a nation composed
entirely of Hatfields and McCoys, locked
in a vicious cycle of mortal combat that
feeds off of revenge? It's not right for
sons and grandsons who have no per
sonal conflict with each other to contin
ue the battles of their predecessors.
Retaliation for the evils of the past
causes friction between groups in the
present, making harmony impossible.
Even if we disagree with those who
lived in the past, we should take the
time to decide whether or not it's worth
trying to get along with their children
— born innocent of their fathers'
crimes, in a different era, with a differ
ent sense of morality and ethics.
Unfortunately, in a lot of cases it
may not be worth the effort. All too
many bigots exist today, and they
should be battled with ferocity. But we
should resist the temptation to damn
entire demographic groups regardless of
individual guilt. Many people have lived

their lives fairly. Blaming them for oth
ers' crimes of ignorance breeds frustra
tion, exasperation and more of the bit
terness that America has so much of
already.
It's easier to simply spread out a
broad net of blame ensnaring everyone
than to take the time to find out who
the true racists, sexists and other-ists
are. And while I'm not claiming to be
nearly as cute as a poor dolphin acci
dentally caught in a tuna net, I'd hate
to waste the analogy.
We should extend the benefit of the
doubt to those we haven't met and don't
understand. We should hold people
responsible for their own actions and
beliefs — not for every indiscretion of
those who share their lineage.
Think back to that feeling you got
when your little brother was running
around the house for no reason whatso
ever, broke something expensive, and
got you both in trouble because "you
should have known better."
Everybody remembers that feeling.
And everybody hates that feeling.
