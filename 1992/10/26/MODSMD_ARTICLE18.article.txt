A war waged with words against an unjust societg

IN RESPONSE TO [ANDREA
Parkes] "Non-sexism isn't an
excuse" column, I would like to
address not your arguments but your
language.
First, you rely heavily on the com
mon and confusing rhetoric of social
reform. Your detractors will often
equate vagueness of language with
invalidity of point. Look at how atten
tion to derogatory nomenclature has
become a subject of confusion and is
now ridiculed as "P.C."
Your essay suggests the terms
"woman with attitude," "struggling
other person," "culturally pigeonholed
woman" and "differently experienced
person of different gender, color or
preference" with little regard to their
effectiveness. Jargon and euphemisms
cause important issues to be simply
talked to death.
You fault a man for considering "a
lack of negative action" as a positive or
blameless quality. Following the argu
ment of your column, one can only

assume that "negative action" means
being non-sexist or not actively engag
ing in sexist practice.
Yet, coupled with the phrase "a lack
of," the term suggests either actively
sexist behavior, or the behavior that
you recommend, an active, but not
intrusive, support of women. In this
context, the entire phrase is contradic
tory.
You contradict yourself further by
recommending the very behavior you
condemn. Two of the seven suggestions
you make to men are not interrupting,
and not asking a favor [of a woman).
Do you imply that to interrupt any
woman is automatically an act of
aggression specifically against her iden
tity as a woman, and that a man must
actively suppress this tendency of his
unenlightened mind?
Two other suggestions you make
are "acknowledgment" and "recogni
tion," but are you suggesting intro
spection or public vocalization and
political action? You and the writer you

cite subtly ridicule both possibilities.
While I appreciate your automotive
metaphor, it drives you to suggest
"walking next to women" and walking
with them "through a dark parking
lot." One seems clearly metaphoric,
but does the other suggest literal
action? Metaphoric or literal, it is a
bad suggestion to make to a campus
whose nights are filled with women
wary of men and men wary of women
wary of men.
I am not belittling your arguments
with hyper-attentiveness to semantics.
You are deliberate in some of your lan
guage. You choose to say "I was talking
with a man," rather than "I was hav
ing intercourse with a man" because
the latter can also suggest something
very different from your meaning.
In your column the word sex and its
variants are associated with bad things,
undoubtedly a result of our puritanical
American culture. Gender, once limited
to grammar, is now the word of choice.
An "enlightened" society would not

question your language, but you're not
trying to convince the enlightened, are
you?
Language has institutionalized sexist
attitudes in law, speech, and the media.
In your capacity as a writer, you are
waging a war with words in order to
bring about a more just society. Be cau
tious. Language is loaded and can blow
up in your face. You still won't be able
to completely avoid opposition to your
opinions, but you can make your oppo
nents respect you and your arguments.
I suggest supplementing your read
ing of Naomi Wolf with some William
Safire, not for any ideological content,
rather, because he is a great source for
English majors, and for anyone who
uses or is used by language.
I apologize in advance for my own
peccadillos of logic and language, but
even Safire would concede that the
English language is elusive; the pen, it
seems, is a double-edged sword.
