# All constitutional rights, inculding free speech, are bound by limitations
## 
### 
In response to Tom Flemma's recent
column on free speech, it seems to me
that he is missing an important point.
His concern seems to be that a speech
code limiting hate speech is an improp
er limit on the right to free speech
because it limits the exchange of ideas.
What he's missing, however, is that
hate speech itself limits the exchange of
ideas through intimidation.
I cannot agree that slurs of the type
that Flemma defended can in any way
contribute to "stimulating intellectual
discourses." Every day of our lives, gays

and lesbians encounter such comments
and usually respond with silence; a
silence that was intentionally induced
by these comments. The infamous
statement of Keith Rabois was certainly
not intended to start a conversation
with whom Rabois disagreed.
From my own experience, I have
found that similar comments in the
work place or at school have prevented
me from exercising even the simplest
forms of free speech. The fear of losing
friends, the respect of colleagues, or
even my job, has often prevented me
from carrying on conversations that
most of society takes for granted.
Off-hand comments like "My
boyfriend and I saw this great movie
last night," are edited in response to
the fear that is generated by hate
speech. If I was uncomfortable engag-

ing in even simple conversation that
would identify my sexual orientation,
you can be sure that I did not express
ideas that would constitute "simulating
intellectual discourse" on the subject.
Hate speech, or its equivalents, can
come in many forms. It doesn't have to
be a graphic as the death wish we all
heard last spring. Simple insults like
"you're such a fag," can keep people
silent for years.
Yes, the Constitution grants us all
the right to "free speech." It also grants
us the right to use them to harm oth
ers. Every constitutional right has its
limits, and speech is no exception.
These limits have valid reasons, and, in
my opinion, a speech code is one valid
limit.
