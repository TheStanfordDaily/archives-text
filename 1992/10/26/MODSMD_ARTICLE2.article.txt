# Setting a new standard
## Committee to evaluate status of women faculty 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
A recently formed provost's
committee is exploring the hiring,
salary, advancement and well
being of women faculty members
on campus.
Members of the Committee on
Recruitment and Retention of
Women Faculty at Stanford agree
that their efforts are needed, since
women represent only a small
fraction of tenured professors at
the University.
In the 1990-91 academic year,
women made up 13 percent of Stan
ford's faculty in all schools, and 9
percent of the total tenured faculty.
While these numbers are an im
provement over the statistics of
the early '70s, women faculty

"have a long way to go, baby," said
Education Prof. Myra Strober,
committee chair.
Strober said she is concerned
not only with the numbers, but
also with the message that the lack
of women in many departments
and schools is sending to students.
"For example, in the {Graduate
School of Business], more than
one-third of the students are
women," she said. "What is the
message that is given to these
women — as well as to the male stu
dents — if only two of the tenured
faculty are women?"
Strober said one of the commit
tee's greatest challenges will be to
find ways to increase the number
of women faculty while upholding
fair hiring standards.
"There can be no hint of any

difference in competence" be
tween female and male faculty re
cruits, Strober said.
"To me, affirmative action
means increasing the pool by using
a search process that casts the net
far and wide, and makes a sincere
effort to look at the records and
qualifications of women," she said.
Provost Gerald Lieberman said
the question is not merely, "How
do we get more women faculty?"
but also, "How do we retain them?"
The University will not be able
to retain its women faculty mem
bers if their numbers are thought
lessly increased, Lieberman said.
Furthermore, the hiring
process must be followed by insur
ing salary and advancement equi
