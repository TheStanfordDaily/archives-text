# Setting a new standard
## Committee to evaluate status of women faculty 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
A recently formed provost's
committee is exploring the hiring,
salary, advancement and well
being of women faculty members
on campus.
Members of the Committee on
Recruitment and Retention of
Women Faculty at Stanford agree
that their efforts are needed, since
women represent only a small
fraction of tenured professors at
the University.
In the 1990-91 academic year,
women made up 13 percent of Stan
ford's faculty in all schools, and 9
percent of the total tenured faculty.
While these numbers are an im
provement over the statistics of
the early '70s, women faculty

"have a long way to go, baby," said
Education Prof. Myra Strober,
committee chair.
Strober said she is concerned
not only with the numbers, but
also with the message that the lack
of women in many departments
and schools is sending to students.
"For example, in the {Graduate
School of Business], more than
one-third of the students are
women," she said. "What is the
message that is given to these
women — as well as to the male stu
dents — if only two of the tenured
faculty are women?"
Strober said one of the commit
tee's greatest challenges will be to
find ways to increase the number
of women faculty while upholding
fair hiring standards.
"There can be no hint of any

difference in competence" be
tween female and male faculty re
cruits, Strober said.
"To me, affirmative action
means increasing the pool by using
a search process that casts the net
far and wide, and makes a sincere
effort to look at the records and
qualifications of women," she said.
Provost Gerald Lieberman said
the question is not merely, "How
do we get more women faculty?"
but also, "How do we retain them?"
The University will not be able
to retain its women faculty mem
bers if their numbers are thought
lessly increased, Lieberman said.
Furthermore, the hiring
process must be followed by insur
ing salary and advancement equi
ty, he said.
Assoc. English Prof. Mary
Wack, a committee member, said
she has submitted material to the
committee on national trends of
salary discrepancies between
male and female faculty.
She said she hopes these stud
ies will lead the committee to
examine Stanford's own prac
tices.
"I think there are things Stan
ford has to look at really hard
regarding differing career pat
terns, advancement and salary,"
Wack said. "Whether it is a mat
ter of one or two cases or system
atic, institutional pressure is
something the whole group needs
to decide."
Strober said the committee
intends to interview current and
former women faculty and
explore problems that may cause
women to leave Stanford.
"We will look at sexual harass
ment as a possible motivation to
leave," she said. "But we will need

to be discreet and sensitive. We've
taken vows of confidentiality."
In the long term, Strober said
she hopes the committee will cre
ate a new standard at Stanford.
"I have talked to students who
are so used to the predominance
of male faculty that they consider
it 'normal,' " she said. "My hope
is that we can produce a situation
over time where gender balance in
the faculty will be considered
'normal.' "
Lieberman said he appointed
the committee based on recom
mendations from its predecessor,
the Committee on Faculty
Recruitment and Retention.
Members were selected to
reflect a range of departments,
and Lieberman noted that the
committee is formed of "techni
cally, six men and five women," at
the request of some of the women
on the committee.
Lieberman said it was impor
tant to include both men and
women on the committee to give
it more credibility with the facul
ty.
The original committee had
looked at issues concerning
women and minority faculty, said

Strober, who was a member.
"We decided the issues that
faced of women on the faculty
were complex enough that anoth
er committee should be formed
specifically to deal with them,"
Strober said.
Ultimately, the committee will
produce a report, due to be
released at the end of the academ
ic year.
The report will contain the
committee's evaluation of the sta
tus of women faculty on campus,
and provide recommendations to
Lieberman on how to improve it.
Lieberman will then take the
recommendations to the Univer
sity Cabinet.
"I will talk to the cabinet and
we will decide if we can carry it
out," Lieberman said. "The rec
ommendations are not binding."
Lieberman said he hopes the
committee's work will "be taken
seriously by all faculty con
cerned" in all departments.
"Ultimately, the process of hir
ing faculty is a bottom-up opera
tion — the president and provost
don't mandate it,"he said. "The
process initiates at a departmen
tal level."
