# Bosnian ambassador asserts Muslim rights
## 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
In a speech Friday, Bosnia's
ambassador to the United States
decried the oppression Muslims
have experienced during the ongo
ing civil war in the former
Yugoslavia.
"What is going on now is a holo
caust," Sacirbey told the
audience, which included people
with allegiances to all sides of the
strife. "Those who are with us and
ignore [itJ are wrong."
In a speech entitled "Bosnia,
Until When?", Sacirbey champi
oned the rights of Muslims in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and accused
the Serbians of bending the truth.
"Muslims are being accused by
Serbs of killing, scaring, robbing
and raping," he said. "It would be
unfair here in Stanford to vote for
(believe) the Serbian press, when we
have freedom of press in the U.S."
Bosnian Muslims are the small
est of the Yugoslav region's three
major ethnic groups, and Serbian
and Croatian military forces have
captured large portions of Bosnia
in the region's bloody civil war.
Speaking in Kresge Auditorium
before more than 80 people, Sacir

bey attacked critics who accuse
Bosnia of being overly aggressive.
"We are being accused of having
our own state [by force!," he said.
"That is not true. We are willing to
share responsibilities. We just
want to have freedom ... and ...
equality. Democracy means caring
about your own people, not fight
ing others."
Sacirbey began his hour-long
speech with a history lesson of the
Muslim presence that has been in
Bosnian territory for almost 1,000
years, and he described the Mus
lim struggle as one for basic
human rights.
"[All we wanted was] to stay
alive, the right to practice our reli
gion and to not be treated as second
or third-class citizens," he said.
Reflecting on the history of the
region since World War I, Sacirbey
argued that resolutions to past
conflicts have always benefitted
Serbs or Croatians more than the
Bosnian Muslims.
"Counties with Bosnian Muslim
majorities were given to the Serbs
and to the Croats," he said, citing
examples of what he thought was
unfair treatment of the Muslims.
He decried Belgrade as a symbol
of Serbian hegemony, and disput

ed the concept of Yugoslavia as
promoted by the Serbs.
"Communism in Yugoslavia was
especially harsh on religious
beliefs," Sacirbey said. "(Whenl the
Berlin Wall was broken, things
started to change and we were very
happy."
Sacirbey outlined the events of
the last two years in great detail,
discussing the 1991 Bosnian par

liamentary vote for independence,
the subsequent application to the
United Nations for recognition as
a sovereign state, and the recogni
tion by the European Community
and the United States in April and
May of this year, respectively.
During the question-and
answer session that followed, one
person accused Sacirbey of "inac
curacies, some gross, some minor",

prompting various members of the
audience to boo, cheer or yell.
The harshest question was,
"How come you did not mention
that 90 percent of Muslims are
converted from Serbs?"
"That is not relevant," Sacirbey
responded. "What matters is what
we feel. That is why it is important
that no one can declare who we are
and what we are."
