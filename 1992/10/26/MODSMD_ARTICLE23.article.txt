## Offense stumbles in ugly Cardinal win over Beavers 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
At a fine restaurant, a palate
cleanser is usually served
between courses, cleaning out the
taste of the just-eaten portion
and allowing one to pause and
regroup before moving on to the
next plate.
Such is the function that Ore
gon State served for No. 16 Stan
ford on Saturday, as the Beavers
were a bland, digestible dish
before the Cardinal heads into
the meat-and-potatoes section of
its schedule.

Before 26,594 fans at Parker
Stadium in Corvallis, Ore., Stan
ford got back on the winning track
after last week's defeat by Ari
zona, beating Oregon State 27-21.
The Cardinal improved its record
to 6-2 overall, 3-1 in the PacificlO
Conference, and moved up one
notch to No. 15 in the Associated
Press poll, while the Beavers
dropped to 1-6-1 and 0-4-1.
"It was ugly, but we got the
W," said outside linebacker Dave
Garnett.
Halfback Glyn Milburn provid
ed the only real excitement for
Stanford, dashing to a 79-yard
touchdown punt return to give
the Cardinal an early 7-0 lead.
However, Stanford's usual
problems were evident in the win,
as the offense again struggled and
the offensive line did a sporadic
job in protecting quarterback
Steve Stenstrom, who was sacked
three times.
The first of those sacks was a
vicious hit by defensive tackle
Sailusi Poulivaati that resulted in
a loss of seven yards and the all
too-familiar sight of Stenstrom
lying in pain on the ground.

"They got me pretty good,"
Stenstrom said.
Aside from a 65-yard drive
which started midway through
the first quarter and ended in the
second quarter on a two-yard dart
from fullback Ellory Roberts,
offensive treads into the end zone
were generated by the defense.
When the offense tried to put
together drives of its own, the
only points that resulted were
due to the strong leg of freshman
kicker Eric Abrams, who booted
field goals of 49 and 44 yards.
"I sort of had a monkey on my
back that I couldn't make a long
field goal," Abrams said. "I want
ed to give the coaches confidence
in me, because I hit them in prac
tice and hit them in high school."
Another bright spot on offense
for Stanford was Roberts, who
carried the ball 13 times for 54
yards and two touchdowns.
Oregon State proved to be a lot
tougher than the Cardinal expect
ed, playing the best that it could
and keeping the game close
throughout. The Beavers princi
pal problem, though, was its
inability to throw the football,
ending the game after attempting
to pass only seven times and with
a total of zero net passing yards.
For the Stanford defense, Oregon
State's wishbone offense was good
preparation for next week's show
down with No. 1 Washington.
"As an offense, they come off
the ball incredibly hard and with
full speed," said lineman Estevan
Avila. "They ran every down and
tested us."
Oregon State pulled out all the
stops in its attempt to win the
game, including a nine-and-a-half
minute touchdown drive to start
the fourth quarter, and a trick
play to tie the game in the open
ing period.
With 4:55 remaining in the
first quarter and the ball on their
own 28-yard line, the Beavers
faked a handoff to fullback John
Young. In reality, center Johnny
Feinga hiked the ball to quarter
back Mark Olford, who left the
ball on the ground. Left guard
Fletcher Keister fell down as if he
missed his blocking assignment,
scooping up the ball. While every
one moved left to counter the fake
handoff, Keister got up and went

right, rambling 72 yards for a
touchdown to tie the score at 7-7.
The "fumble-rooski" pumped
up the young Beaver team, who
left the field at the half down by
only three points, 17-14.
"We still don't know exactly
how that happened," said head
coach Bill Walsh. "No one knows,
and that was what scared us. Boy,
it had me worried because our
defensive coaches did not see
exactly how it happened. We
knew about that play but when
you practice against the wishbone
you sort of lose track of that. But
it can happen with anybody."
Stanford scored twice in the
second half on the second of
Abrams' field goals and a four
yard run by Roberts after a

Vaughn Bryant interception to
increase the lead to 27-14. OSU
then embarked on its long drive,
but was unable to close the gap
afterward as its running game
ran out of steam.
The Cardinal will need a sig
nificant improvement in offensive
output to topple the Huskies this
week. Stenstrom, who again was
battered and bruised, completed
15-of-25 passes for 167 yards, and
the Cardinal managed 290 yards
of total offense.
"At times we picked Oregon
State apart and at other times we
played sophomoric football,"
Walsh said. "All in all, we're 6-2
and we've got a big game this
week and that's what we're look
ing forward to."

full speed," said lineman Estevan
Avila. "They ran every down and
tested us."
Oregon State pulled out all the
stops in its attempt to win the
game, including a nine-and-a-half
minute touchdown drive to start
the fourth quarter, and a trick
play to tie the game in the open
ing period.
With 4:55 remaining in the
first quarter and the ball on their
own 28-yard line, the Beavers
faked a handoff to fullback John
Young. In reality, center Johnny
Feinga hiked the ball to quarter
back Mark Olford, who left the
ball on the ground. Left guard
Fletcher Keister fell down as if he
missed his blocking assignment,
scooping up the ball. While every
one moved left to counter the fake
handoff, Keister got up and went

right, rambling 72 yards for a
touchdown to tie the score at 7-7.
The "fumble-rooski" pumped
up the young Beaver team, who
left the field at the half down by
only three points, 17-14.
"We still don't know exactly
how that happened," said head
coach Bill Walsh. "No one knows,
and that was what scared us. Boy,
it had me worried because our
defensive coaches did not see
exactly how it happened. We
knew about that play but when
you practice against the wishbone
you sort of lose track of that. But
it can happen with anybody."
Stanford scored twice in the
second half on the second of
Abrams' field goals and a four
yard run by Roberts after a

Vaughn Bryant interception to
increase the lead to 27-14. OSU
then embarked on its long drive,
but was unable to close the gap
afterward as its running game
ran out of steam.
The Cardinal will need a sig
nificant improvement in offensive
output to topple the Huskies this
week. Stenstrom, who again was
battered and bruised, completed
15-of-25 passes for 167 yards, and
the Cardinal managed 290 yards
of total offense.
"At times we picked Oregon
State apart and at other times we
played sophomoric football,"
Walsh said. "All in all, we're 6-2
and we've got a big game this
week and that's what we're look
ing forward to."

Before 26,594 fans at Parker
Stadium in Corvallis, Ore., Stan
ford got back on the winning track
after last week's defeat by Ari
zona, beating Oregon State 27-21.
The Cardinal improved its record
to 6-2 overall, 3-1 in the PacificlO
Conference, and moved up one
notch to No. 15 in the Associated
Press poll, while the Beavers
dropped to 1-6-1 and 0-4-1.
"It was ugly, but we got the
W," said outside linebacker Dave
Garnett.
Halfback Glyn Milburn provid
ed the only real excitement for
Stanford, dashing to a 79-yard
touchdown punt return to give
the Cardinal an early 7-0 lead.
However, Stanford's usual
problems were evident in the win,
as the offense again struggled and
the offensive line did a sporadic
job in protecting quarterback
Steve Stenstrom, who was sacked
three times.
The first of those sacks was a
vicious hit by defensive tackle
Sailusi Poulivaati that resulted in
a loss of seven yards and the all
too-familiar sight of Stenstrom
lying in pain on the ground.

"They got me pretty good,"
Stenstrom said.
Aside from a 65-yard drive
which started midway through
the first quarter and ended in the
second quarter on a two-yard dart
from fullback Ellory Roberts,
offensive treads into the end zone
were generated by the defense.
When the offense tried to put
together drives of its own, the
only points that resulted were
due to the strong leg of freshman
kicker Eric Abrams, who booted
field goals of 49 and 44 yards.
"I sort of had a monkey on my
back that I couldn't make a long
field goal," Abrams said. "I want
ed to give the coaches confidence
in me, because I hit them in prac
tice and hit them in high school."
Another bright spot on offense
for Stanford was Roberts, who
carried the ball 13 times for 54
yards and two touchdowns.
Oregon State proved to be a lot
tougher than the Cardinal expect
ed, playing the best that it could
and keeping the game close
throughout. The Beavers princi
pal problem, though, was its
inability to throw the football,
ending the game after attempting
to pass only seven times and with
a total of zero net passing yards.
For the Stanford defense, Oregon
State's wishbone offense was good
preparation for next week's show
down with No. 1 Washington.
"As an offense, they come off
the ball incredibly hard and with
full speed," said lineman Estevan
Avila. "They ran every down and
tested us."
