# Pac-10 Conference football update
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
With four games left in the col
lege football regular season, the
Pacific 10 Conference race is head
ing into the home stretch. The
bizarre results from this past Sat
urday's contests give cause for
some rumination on who will rep
resent the conference in this year's
Rose Bowl.
Washington is clearly the
favorite to finish the season
undefeated and make another
trip to Pasadena. Tied for the
number-one national ranking
with Miami and boasting a 4-0
Pac-10 record so far, the Huskies
play Stanford at home this week
and haven't really been tested all
year.
It can be argued, however, that
the aura of invincibility enveloping
Washington has disappeared.
Their quarterback controversy
just recently ended with senior
Mark Brunell taking over the
starting job from Billy Joe Hobert.
Never mind that each of these
quarterbacks has won a Rose
Bowl, they haven't looked that
good this season.
The Huskies struggled against
UC-Berkeley and should have
crushed the University of Pacific
Tigers worse than 31-7. With the
Cardinal visiting Seattle on Satur
day, Washington could be ripe for
an upset.
But is Stanford the team to
administer that defeat? This
question largely depends on
which Cardinal team shows up for
the game. So far this year, Stan
ford has played up for the big
games with road defeats of Notre
Dame and UCLA but has been
unable to shake loose of the infe
rior teams.
This weekend's game against
Oregon State is the perfect illus
tration of a growing trend. The
Beavers, now 1-6-1, had chances to
win late into the fourth quarter
but let the Cardinal escape with a
27-21 win.
The success of the fum
blerooskie play symbolized Stan
ford's frustrations. A left guard
named Fletcher Keister scored on

a 72-yard touchdown run with a
play that left Stanford players and
coaches flabbergasted. None of the
Beaver's best running backs had
much success against the Cardi
nal, but the 284-pound Keister
did.
After two straight subpar show
ings, look for Stanford to play a
better game in Seattle this week
end. Steve Stenstrom and Glyn
Milburn will be healthy, and the
Cardinal is only one game back in
the conference standings with a 3-
1 mark. If the trend continues,
Stanford should be playing its best
football against an ostensibly
superior opponent.
If the Cardinal fails in its mis
sion, three other teams are also
poised to make a run at the confer
ence title. The Arizona Wildcats
seem to be playing the most
inspired football in the league
right now, with consecutive wins
against UCLA, Stanford and
Berkeley.
If the Wildcats can't topple
Washington on November 7 in
Tucson, state rival Washington
State hosts the Huskies in the
Apple Cup, both teams' final regu
lar-season game. The Cougars
remain in the thick of the Pac-10
hunt with a 3-1 league record
despite losing to USC, another 3-1
team, 31-21.
One team in the Where Are You
Now? file is UCLA. Onced ranked
as high as 11th in the nation, the
UCLA Bruins have become the
doormat of the Pac 10, losing all
four conference games. This past
Saturday, they were shut out for
the first time since 1971, losing to
Arizona State at home 20-0.
Stanford's game against Wash
ington is followed in the schedule
by home clashes with USC and
Washington State, along with the
Big Game at Berkeley. With no
easy games left in the schedule,
the Cardinal can finish as well as
10-2 and headed for Pasadena or
as dismal as 6-6.
If the season so far is any indi
cation, the Cardinal should play
good football against tough compe
tition for the rest of the year. Look
for the Pac-10 race to be one of the
most interesting ever.

One team in the Where Are You
Now? file is UCLA. Onced ranked
as high as 11th in the nation, the
UCLA Bruins have become the
doormat of the Pac 10, losing all
four conference games. This past
Saturday, they were shut out for
the first time since 1971, losing to
Arizona State at home 20-0.
Stanford's game against Wash
ington is followed in the schedule
by home clashes with USC and
Washington State, along with the
Big Game at Berkeley. With no
easy games left in the schedule,
the Cardinal can finish as well as
10-2 and headed for Pasadena or
as dismal as 6-6.
If the season so far is any indi
cation, the Cardinal should play
good football against tough compe
tition for the rest of the year. Look
for the Pac-10 race to be one of the
most interesting ever.
