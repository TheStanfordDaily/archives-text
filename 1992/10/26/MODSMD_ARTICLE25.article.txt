# Stanford shoots down Ducks, Beavers to end homestand
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
After finishing its six-game homestand
in convincing fashion last weekend, the
Stanford women's volleyball team will
finally get something they've been waiting
two weeks for: a week off.
The Cardinal disposed of Oregon and
Oregon State last Friday and Saturday at
Maples Pavilion in 3-0 and 3-1 decisions,
respectively. On Friday, Stanford rolled
over the Ducks 15-10, 15-8, 15-6, then took
an extra game to down the Beavers on Sun
day, 15-2, 15-6, 13-15, 15-4.
Stanford (17-1, 10-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference) headed into this weekend hop
ing for some momentum going into next
week's matches against No. 6 USC and No.
1 UCLA. They started with Oregon (6-11, 2-
8 in the Pac-10), a team that has struggled
against Pac-10 opponents this year. But for
a while, it looked as if the Ducks would put
up a fight. In the first game, Oregon led the
Cardinal midway through the match, 10-7.
Then Stanford rallied behind the dazzling
defensive play of Kristi Paaso, and went on
an 8-0 run to take the game 15-10.
The second and third games were back
to business as usual for Stanford. The Car
dinal rattled off eight points to start the
second game, then outlasted the Ducks to
take the game 15-8. The third game saw
Stanford jump out to an early 11-3 lead
before finishing the game and match with a
15-6 win.
"We never surrendered much of a lead,"
head coach Don Shaw said after the match.
"We just kept siding out and really sus
tained an attack tonight."
Senior setter Carrie Feldman's 40
assists paced the Cardinal offense, and
allowed Paaso, senior hitter Jennifer Jack
son and tri-captain Bev Oden to post solid
offensive numbers against Oregon.
Paaso hit .222 with 13 kills and 14 digs
for Stanford, while Jackson added 10 kills
and four digs, with a .231 hitting percent

age. Oden blazed to a .481 average on the
match, and registered 14 kills and eight
digs for the team.
"Paaso's been playing well all the way
around," Shaw said. "She and Feldman
have been giving us some solid play lately
— they deserve a lot of credit."
Stanford looked to continue its success
Saturday against Oregon State (10-11, 1-
10), but quickly learned that the Beavers
would play much better than their 1-9 Pac
-10 record might suggest.
Stanford had little problem in the first
game, putting together 11 straight points
to blow by Oregon State 15-2. It was the
same story in the second game, as Stanford
went ahead 13-2 and subbed for almost all
the starters in the game. Marni Triefen
bach, Maureen McLaren, Piper Hahn,
Denise Rotert and Heidi Eick helped finish
off the Beavers, 15-8.
In the third game, however, Stanford
ran into hitting and passing problems. Ore
gon State ran 14 straight points off numer
ous Cardinal errors to threaten at 14-3.
Then Stanford mounted an incredible 10-
point comeback to close the gap to 14-13,
before the Beavers finished the game 15-13.
Stanford rebounded in the fourth game,
putting together seven straight points to
take the game and match 15-4.
Shaw explained that many of the prob
lems in game three came from disorganiza
tion. "We had a new lineup out there, and
we just made a ton of mistakes," Shaw said.
"We just couldn't get it together."
Shaw admitted that the loss in game
three puts teams like Oregon State in per
spective. "You can't take anything for
granted in this conference — any team can
come in and make you work for it."
The Cardinal will have a week to prepare
for its showdown with USC and UCLA in Ixxs
Angeles next weekend.
"We're really focusing on USC — that's
the more important match for us," Shaw
said. "We can afford to go 1-1 and lose to
UCLA, but we can't afford to go 0-2."

the more important match for us," Shaw
said. "We can afford to go 1-1 and lose to
UCLA, but we can't afford to go 0-2."

Bev Oden dives for the dig in a Stanford victory this weekend. The Cardinal defeated Oregon and Oregon State in its last
home performances before its LA road trip.
After finishing its six-game homestand
in convincing fashion last weekend, the
Stanford women's volleyball team will
finally get something they've been waiting
two weeks for: a week off.
The Cardinal disposed of Oregon and
Oregon State last Friday and Saturday at
Maples Pavilion in 3-0 and 3-1 decisions,
respectively. On Friday, Stanford rolled
over the Ducks 15-10, 15-8, 15-6, then took
an extra game to down the Beavers on Sun
day, 15-2, 15-6, 13-15, 15-4.
Stanford (17-1, 10-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference) headed into this weekend hop
ing for some momentum going into next
week's matches against No. 6 USC and No.
1 UCLA. They started with Oregon (6-11, 2-
8 in the Pac-10), a team that has struggled
against Pac-10 opponents this year. But for
a while, it looked as if the Ducks would put
up a fight. In the first game, Oregon led the
Cardinal midway through the match, 10-7.
Then Stanford rallied behind the dazzling
defensive play of Kristi Paaso, and went on
an 8-0 run to take the game 15-10.
The second and third games were back
to business as usual for Stanford. The Car
dinal rattled off eight points to start the
second game, then outlasted the Ducks to
take the game 15-8. The third game saw
Stanford jump out to an early 11-3 lead
before finishing the game and match with a
15-6 win.
"We never surrendered much of a lead,"
head coach Don Shaw said after the match.
"We just kept siding out and really sus
tained an attack tonight."
Senior setter Carrie Feldman's 40
assists paced the Cardinal offense, and
allowed Paaso, senior hitter Jennifer Jack
son and tri-captain Bev Oden to post solid
offensive numbers against Oregon.
Paaso hit .222 with 13 kills and 14 digs
for Stanford, while Jackson added 10 kills
and four digs, with a .231 hitting percent

age. Oden blazed to a .481 average on the
match, and registered 14 kills and eight
digs for the team.
"Paaso's been playing well all the way
around," Shaw said. "She and Feldman
have been giving us some solid play lately
— they deserve a lot of credit."
Stanford looked to continue its success
Saturday against Oregon State (10-11, 1-
10), but quickly learned that the Beavers
would play much better than their 1-9 Pac
-10 record might suggest.
Stanford had little problem in the first
game, putting together 11 straight points
to blow by Oregon State 15-2. It was the
same story in the second game, as Stanford
went ahead 13-2 and subbed for almost all
the starters in the game. Marni Triefen
bach, Maureen McLaren, Piper Hahn,
Denise Rotert and Heidi Eick helped finish
off the Beavers, 15-8.
In the third game, however, Stanford
ran into hitting and passing problems. Ore
gon State ran 14 straight points off numer
ous Cardinal errors to threaten at 14-3.
Then Stanford mounted an incredible 10-
point comeback to close the gap to 14-13,
before the Beavers finished the game 15-13.
Stanford rebounded in the fourth game,
putting together seven straight points to
take the game and match 15-4.
Shaw explained that many of the prob
lems in game three came from disorganiza
tion. "We had a new lineup out there, and
we just made a ton of mistakes," Shaw said.
"We just couldn't get it together."
Shaw admitted that the loss in game
three puts teams like Oregon State in per
spective. "You can't take anything for
granted in this conference — any team can
come in and make you work for it."
The Cardinal will have a week to prepare
for its showdown with USC and UCLA in Ixxs
Angeles next weekend.
"We're really focusing on USC — that's
the more important match for us," Shaw
said. "We can afford to go 1-1 and lose to
UCLA, but we can't afford to go 0-2."
