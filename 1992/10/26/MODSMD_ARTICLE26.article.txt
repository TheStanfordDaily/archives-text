The San Jose State Spartans annihi

golf tournament, while the young Cardi
| nal team finished in third place.
Top-ranked San Jose State set a
course and tournament record with
865 strokes. The second-round score of

the Spartans set an 18-hole team
record at 282 strokes. Finishing a dis
tant second, Indiana shot a 904, while
Stanford followed closely behind with
907 strokes.
Fifth-year senior Martha Richards
bounced back from a rough first round,
shooting blistering second- and third
round scores of 70 and 71, respectively.
Her total of 219 led the Stanford team
and put her in a tie for fifth place overall.
Freshman Vicky Strada tied for 12th

place at 228, while sophomore Jamille
Jose, with 229, ended the tournament in
a tie for 15th place. Melinda Daniels, a
junior, tied for 24th with 232 strokes,
and first-time competitor Kathryn Weber
shot a 240, which placed her in a tie for
45th place.
The Spartan squad accomplished the
amazing feat of placing all five of its
starters in the top eight. First-place fin
isher Tracy Hanson, called "the best
amateur player in the world" by Stanford

women's coach Tim Baldwin, set another
course and tournament record for the
Spartans this weekend. Her three-round
total of 210 was nine strokes under par
for the tournament.
Regarding San Jose State's phenome
nal 11-under-par team performance,
Baldwin stated unequivocally that "there
has never been a college team that has
shot like that . . . This is the best team
that has ever played women's golf."
Baldwin was pleased by Stanford's

performance, rating the weekend as "a
good tournament" for the Cardinal.
"We're a young team, a learning team,"
he commented.
The Cardinal finished third in a field
of 15, weakened by the withdrawal of
many teams who played in the concur
rent NCAA Preview tournament held at
the University of Georgia.
