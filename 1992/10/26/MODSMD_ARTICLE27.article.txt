# Cardinal loses to UW Huskies
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Yesterday, the Stanford men's soccer team beat
themselves in a 1-0 game against the Washington
Huskies, settling for second place in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation.
The only goal of the contest came on a seemingly
routine play in the Cardinal backfield. Stanford
defenders had a four-on-two advantage at the top of
their penalty box with sweeper Jeff Kogl ready to
clear the ball out, but the entire unit hesitated and
allowed the Huskies to put the ball into the net.
Washington midfielder John Cowmey had appar
ently touched the ball with his hands, and the Cardi
nal was anticipating a personal foul call that never
came. Instead, Huskies' forward Erik Penner took
advantage of Stanford's confusion and tapped the
ball to Cowmey, who easily pushed it in for the score.
"[Cowmey] definitely had his hand on the ball
during the play," said senior midfielder and co-cap
tain Randy Mann. "The referee had the whistle in
his mouth, but decided not to make the call."
Stanford had plenty of offensive opportunities of
their own, overwhelming Washington in shots on
goal by a margin of 20 to 5, as they continually pres
sured the Husky defenders in their penalty box.
"It was just one of those games where we couldn't
buy a goal if we wanted to," Mann said. "No doubt
about it, we were the better team
"I think we should have had that game won on
four or five occasions," said coach Colin Lindores.
"It's just that today the players were being a little
selfish and individualistic. Sometimes that works,
but most of the times it backfires on you. From now
on we've got to learn to play together as a team."
Preceding the Washington match, the Cardinal
warmed up by pummeling a struggling San Jose
State team 6-1. Senior forward Lance Killian, given
his second consecutive start, almost doubled his goal
total by scoring three against the Spartans for a sea
son total of seven goals and two assists.
In addition, forward Carmen D'Onofrio, midfield

er Jason Vanacour, and forward Jim Talluto also
contributed to the offensive onslaught with a goal
apiece. For Vanacour, that goal was his team-leading
eighth of the year.
"The San Jose score was not surprising," Lin
dores said. "But after scoring six goals against them
we came into the Washington game trying to make

all the big plays as individuals. You just don't win by
playing individualistic soccer."
Stanford's loss against the Huskies means that
the MPSF title game, which includes the Pacific half
of the conference as well (Stanford is in the Moun
tain region.), will be played in Seattle on Washing
ton's Astro Turf.
