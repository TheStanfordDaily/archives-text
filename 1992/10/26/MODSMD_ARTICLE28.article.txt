# Stanford strong in American race
## 
### Greg Collins 
Finally getting a chance to show their stuff, the
men's and women's crew teams competed Saturday at
the Head of the American race in Sacramento.
The three eight-person men's boats finished first,
third and fourth overall, beating out two strong teams
from California.
The women's varsity eight-person boat finished
third, one second behind second-place California and
several seconds behind the first-place club team from
the Long Beach Rowing Association. In the four-per
son event, Stanford finished in the middle of the pack
of 12 boats.
Tom Grace, senior tri-captain, was pleased with the
day's outcome on the men's side. "It was very impor
tant in terms of showing our depth," Grace said.
The mens-8 won with a time of 14:55, with Cal four
seconds behind. Stanford's other two boats were 14
and 19 seconds, respectively behind the top Cardinal
team. Other teams competing included Sacramento
State, UC-Davis and various club teams from around
the area.
Women's head coach Wendy Davis was somewhat
disappointed by the outcome of the women's races.
"We were supposed to double up from our four-per
son boats in our eights, but two of our women were sick
and we were forced to use assistant coach Emily Dirk
sen in our eight-person race," said Davis.
"Some of our new varsity women were intimidated
by the longer course," said Davis. "Normally we race a
two-kilometer course, but this one was five kilometers."
Grace also commented on the promising beginning
of this year's men's team.
"Last week in Boston and this week were good indi
cations that we are starting strong," Grace said.
"November is a good month to really pick it up and
practice hard before the four- or five-week hiatus dur
ing December."
Most likely, both teams will begin to gear up for the
Stanford Fall Regatta to be held November 15. Still
looming large on both teams' schedules is the Newport
Fall Regatta in Newport Beach, Calif., on November
22.
