# Women's soccer ties Broncos
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
After barely beating California and St.
Mary's last week, the No. 2 Stanford
women's soccer team realized it would take
a stronger effort to defeat No. 8 Santa Clara.
And though the Cardinal raised its level
of play yesterday, it wasn't quite enough for
a victory as the two squads tied, 1-1.
"I'm not pleased with the result but I'm
pleased with the players," said Stanford
coach Berhane Andeberhan. "I think they
did a good job. We had our chances but we
couldn't put it away."
The game ended in a deadlock despite
each team creating several golden scoring
opportunities in overtime.
In the first half of overtime, Cardinal for
ward Sarah Rafanelli gave Santa Clara a
scare when she received a cross-field pass
from midfielder Jen Potok and angled in for
a shot on goal.
Unfortunately, Rafanelli didn't have
much room to work with near the left post
and slid an acutely angled shot toward the
corner of the goal. The goalie unsuccessfully
dove for the ball, but it rolled wide right.
On a day of frustrating near-misses for
Rafanelli, the capper was yet to come. In the
second 15-minute half of overtime, there
was a melee in front of the Bronco goal and
the Santa Clara goalie fell to the turf while
going for the ball.
But it squirted away and Rafanelli, who
had her back to the goal, got possession
inside the penalty box. All the Cardinal for
ward had to do to was pivot and shoot at the
keeper-less goal.
Which is what Rafanelli did. Unfortu
nately, she shot right at the goalie who was
still struggling to get to her feet. The ball
was blocked and play continued.
"I saw her and shot right at her,"
Rafanelli said. "I don't know what that was.
I'm killing myself right now for missing
some of those."
Though the Broncos escaped these
attempts unscathed, they could not finish

off the Cardinal when they had the chance.
Santa Clara midfielder Kristi DeVert
slipped through the Stanford defense on a
breakaway with about five minutes left in
overtime. She faked out goalie Lesley Gar
rard near the top of the penalty box, but
couldn't get the shot off as Cardinal fullback
Melinda Minstrell raced after DeVert and
executed a perfect slide tackle to knock the
ball away.
The miss, on what looked like a sure goal
was DeVert's second in two games against
Stanford. In the Cardinal's 2-1 win over
Santa Clara in the NCAA tournament last
year, the Bronco midfielder had a similar
opportunity. She blew past the defenders on
a breakaway and avoided Garrard's slide
tackle.
But she came up empty on the one-on
none when she shot left of the barren goal.
This year, neither squad managed a goal
in overtime and the game ended in a tie.
Andeberhan viewed the tie as a step forward
since the Broncos beat the Cardinal 2-1 dur
ing the 1991 regular season.
"In the second half and overtime the
players' emotional stability was good," he
said. "In the first half, eh, not as bad as last
year. We're still not quite settled, but I want
to take that as progress. Last year when we
played them we were scatterbrains."
The only flat period Andeberhan saw was
at the beginning of the second half, when
the Broncos managed their only goal on a
close-range low shot by Amy Kroeger.
"For about 15 minutes they absolutely
dominated play and had a lot of oomph,"
Andeberhan said. "But I was glad to see that
we took it back again. Except for that spot,
we had an excellent game. Sometimes the
ball has to bounce for you."
At the beginning of the first half, the ball
did bounce the Cardinal's way. Stanford
scored 30 seconds into the game when fresh
man Kristin Hulvey fed the ball to Andrea
Johnson who was slicing toward the goal
from the left. The sophomore forward slid
the ball past the goalie for her third goal of
the year.

year, the Bronco midfielder had a similar
opportunity. She blew past the defenders on
a breakaway and avoided Garrard's slide
tackle.
But she came up empty on the one-on
none when she shot left of the barren goal.
This year, neither squad managed a goal
in overtime and the game ended in a tie.
Andeberhan viewed the tie as a step forward
since the Broncos beat the Cardinal 2-1 dur
ing the 1991 regular season.
"In the second half and overtime the
players' emotional stability was good," he
said. "In the first half, eh, not as bad as last
year. We're still not quite settled, but I want
to take that as progress. Last year when we
played them we were scatterbrains."
The only flat period Andeberhan saw was
at the beginning of the second half, when
the Broncos managed their only goal on a
close-range low shot by Amy Kroeger.
"For about 15 minutes they absolutely
dominated play and had a lot of oomph,"
Andeberhan said. "But I was glad to see that
we took it back again. Except for that spot,
we had an excellent game. Sometimes the
ball has to bounce for you."
At the beginning of the first half, the ball
did bounce the Cardinal's way. Stanford
scored 30 seconds into the game when fresh
man Kristin Hulvey fed the ball to Andrea
Johnson who was slicing toward the goal
from the left. The sophomore forward slid
the ball past the goalie for her third goal of
the year.
