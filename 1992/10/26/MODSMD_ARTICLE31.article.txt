## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Although they rested their
top runners, the Stanford cross
country team still obliterated
the rest of the field at the Col
lege of Notre Dame Invitational
Saturday.
The field was weak, consist
ing mostly of local Division 111
teams, and the Cardinal men
and women dominated in simi
lar fashions.
The women received a team
score of 17, with the next two
closest competitors, Santa Clara
and San Francisco State, scor
ing 98 and 105 points, respec
tively.
Not to be outdone, the men
garnered 16 points, only one
point away from a perfect
score.
Second in that race was
Santa Clara, with 51 points, fol
lowed again by San Francisco
State, with 117 points.
Individually, all of the Stan
ford runners placed in the top
10 in both races.
For the women, Nicole Wood
ward blazed to the finish line in
a meet-record 18 minutes and
11 seconds on the 2.9 mile
course.

Only eight seconds behind
was teammate Anne Sheehee, in
second, followed by third-place
finisher Amy Ewing.
Rounding out the Cardinal
scorers were Jeannie Rothman
and Julie Makley, in fourth and
seventh place, respectively.
The men also ran the same
hilly 2.9 mile course, instead of
their usual five miles, with sim
ilar results.
Setting the pace was Derek
Bork, who covered the distance
in a meet-record 15:17.
The next three finishers were
teammates Greg Schrock, Bret
Lobree and James Woodward.
The last Cardinal scorer was
Mikkal Jollet, in sixth.
The top Stanford runners
rested this meet to prepare
themselves for next weekend's
Pacific 10 Championships,
which will be held on the Stan
ford Golf Course this Satur
day.
Since Stanford may enter
only its top seven runners from
each squad, the Notre Dame
Invitational gave the Cardi
nal's top runners a much-need
ed respite and also allowed oth
ers, often overshadowed, to
enjoy some time in the spot
light.
