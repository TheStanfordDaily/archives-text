# Asian subgroups to be recognized

Stanford will begin asking
Asian-Americans for their specific
ethnicity during this year's admis
sions process, according to Dean of
Admissions James Montoya.
Applicants will be able to iden
tify themselves as Chinese-, Kore
an-, Japanese-, Filipino-, Viet
namese-, Pacific Islander- or
Other Asian-American by check
ing boxes on this year's form.
"Part of the selection process
involves understanding the expe
rience of students," Montoya said,
"and these (boxes] are simply for
better understanding."
Before this year, the University
did not collect any data on the sub
groups within the Asian commu
nity. Estimates were made by flip
ping through the Directory and
looking at last names.
Gathering that information
could be a first step toward imple
menting a recommendation of the
1989 University Committee on
Minority Issues, which said Fil
ipinos, Southeast Asians and Na
tive Hawaiians should be desig
nated as targeted minorities.

Filipino students prefer that
the term be spelled "Pilipino" for
cultural reasons, and the Admis
sions Office writes it that way on
the application.
Targeted minorities — groups
that are under-represented be
cause of historical discrimination
— are assigned an admissions offi
cer with primary recruiting re
sponsibility and would qualify for
special financial aid benefits.
Senior Julius Paras, president
of Stanford's Pilipino -American
Student Union, said he is curious
to see the numbers resulting from
the newly collected information.
"It's important for people to
know that the range of experi
ences for Asian-Americans is as di
verse as the range of experiences
for everyone else," he said.
People generally think of
Asians as being Japanese, Chinese
and Korean and know less about
Pacific Islanders and Native
Hawaiians, he said.
"A lot of the newly arrived immi
grants ... have a totally different
socioeconomic status," Paras
added.
There seem to be relatively few
Vietnamese and Filipino students at
Stanford, he said, despite the high
representation of these ethnicities
within the general Asian population.
"It's just unusual to me that
the Filipino composition at Stan
ford with respect to the different

Asian groups doesn't reflect the
composition of the population in
California and the U.S."
While the Admissions Office
will be gathering information on
the Asian applicant pool, Montoya
said, the Committee on Under
graduate Admission and Financial
Aid decides whether to designate a
group as a targeted minority.
The committee will probably
concentrate largely on financial
aid issues this year, he added.
