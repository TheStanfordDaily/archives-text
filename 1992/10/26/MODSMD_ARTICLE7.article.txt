# Grad office cut creates frustration
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
More than a year after an administrative shake-up
that eliminated the Office of Graduate Studies, many
graduate students say that "chaos" and "confusion"
lingers.
Shuttled back and forth among various offices when
they have questions about their fellowships, registra
tion holds or doctoral projects, students like Susan
Bree are becoming increasingly frustrated.
"The problem is that if you have any difficulty what
soever with your graduate requirements, you just get
sent from person to person and everybody will disclaim
responsibility," said Bree, a graduate student in French
and Italian. "You can't ever say, 'You're responsible for
this. Fix it.' "
While recognizing that many of the problems are
probably transitional, many graduate students worry
that without a central advocate for graduate issues, the
larger policy questions — such as monitoring affirma
tive action and overall performance — will be ignored.
"It's become so decentralized that nobody keeps in
mind the broader picture," said Maria Stampino, a
graduate student in French and Italian.
When the Graduate Studies Office — which had
been headed by a full-time dean and had a 38-person
staff — was eliminated in the summer of 1991, the in
dividual departments and schools were expected to
pick up the slack.
But many say the transition was implemented too
quickly, leaving the schools — particularly the School of
Humanities and Sciences and the School of Education,
which had relied heavily on Graduate Studies for ad
ministrative tasks — overworked and underprepared.
"It has been a difficult process because of the rapid
ity with which it happened," said Elizabeth Fitting, di
rector of student services in the School of Education.
"It has definitely meant more work for us, because
we've been given additional tasks and not the same
amount of funding."
Students, too, have been frustrated by the changeover.
"There's an unsureness about where things are going,"
said David Miyahara, a graduate student in sociology and
a member of the Committee on Graduate Studies. "There
doesn't seem to be a set policy on who's going to be re
sponsible for things."
The Graduate Studies Office
was eliminated due to "reposi
tioning" budget cuts and as part
of a general University move
toward more decentralized forms
of management.
Under a decentralized struc
ture, the various schools and
departments have control over
issues such as admissions and
funding that were previously
determined by the central office.
The advantage of the new sys
tem, its supporters say, is greater
autonomy for the departments —
which are closest to the students
and most able to understand their
needs.
"I think in the long run, ser
vices will be delivered to students
a lot better," said Assoc. Political
Science Prof. Judith Goldstein,
chair of the Committee on Gradu
ate Studies. "Centralization is not
always a good thing — it can be a

lot of bureaucracy."
While Goldstein said, "of
course we're moving slowly into
uncharted territory," she believes
the transition has gone relatively
smoothly.
"We haven't specifically seen
any student get hurt by the pro
cess," she said. "If we did I think
we'd look a lot more seriously at
it."
While Fitting said the transi
tion has been difficult, she agreed
that in the long run, decentraliza
tion will allow her school to serve
its students more effectively.
"We have more control of the
processes now," she said. "We
really try to deal with things on
an individual level, and our deans
are very student-oriented. We feel
that, in a way, it's enabled us to
improve that, because we've been
given more autonomy."
Before decentralization, Fit
ting added, decisions were made
"on a distant level" by people
whose relationships with the stu
dents were not as close.
But Fitting remains convinced

that there should be an advocate
for graduate students within the
University, similar to the role
that had been played by the dean
of Graduate Studies.
"I think there does need to be
central representation of some
type, just to kind of help keep this
all coordinated," she said.
Linguistics Prof. Elizabeth
Traugott, who had been dean of
graduate studies until the office
was eliminated, warned in her
final report to the Faculty Senate
in May 1991 that "where there is
dissonance or lack of attention all
students suffer" — particularly
minority students and women in
certain fields.
"It is extremely important to
have someone identified whose
prime task is to think about
graduate issues across schools
and across departments," Trau
gott said in an interview.
"There's no such person doing
that now."
Goldstein, however, said that
while "there is unclear authority"
as a result of the decentralization,

graduate students do not lack
advocacy.
"There are a lot of advocates
for graduates out there — the
committee is (an advocate]. The
senate is. . . . It's not as if no one's
looking out for graduate stu
dents."
Diversity is not being ignored
either, according to Goldstein.
The Committee on Graduate
Studies has a subcommittee that
examines affirmative action and
made a "thorough review" last
year of each of the schools, she
said.
But students say they worry
that without a central advocate
like the dean of graduate studies,
the "big picture" will be unexam
ined and graduate issues will not
receive a strong enough voice in
University policy-making.
"There's a lack of a superior
authority," said Stampino. "What
do we do, do we talk to the presi
dent? Either you talk to the
department, or there's nobody
else who can put together the bits
and pieces."

given more autonomy."
Before decentralization, Fit
ting added, decisions were made
"on a distant level" by people
whose relationships with the stu
dents were not as close.
But Fitting remains convinced

that there should be an advocate
for graduate students within the
University, similar to the role
that had been played by the dean
of Graduate Studies.
"I think there does need to be
central representation of some
type, just to kind of help keep this
all coordinated," she said.
Linguistics Prof. Elizabeth
Traugott, who had been dean of
graduate studies until the office
was eliminated, warned in her
final report to the Faculty Senate
in May 1991 that "where there is
dissonance or lack of attention all
students suffer" — particularly
minority students and women in
certain fields.
"It is extremely important to
have someone identified whose
prime task is to think about
graduate issues across schools
and across departments," Trau
gott said in an interview.
"There's no such person doing
that now."
Goldstein, however, said that
while "there is unclear authority"
as a result of the decentralization,

graduate students do not lack
advocacy.
"There are a lot of advocates
for graduates out there — the
committee is (an advocate]. The
senate is. . . . It's not as if no one's
looking out for graduate stu
dents."
Diversity is not being ignored
either, according to Goldstein.
The Committee on Graduate
Studies has a subcommittee that
examines affirmative action and
made a "thorough review" last
year of each of the schools, she
said.
But students say they worry
that without a central advocate
like the dean of graduate studies,
the "big picture" will be unexam
ined and graduate issues will not
receive a strong enough voice in
University policy-making.
"There's a lack of a superior
authority," said Stampino. "What
do we do, do we talk to the presi
dent? Either you talk to the
department, or there's nobody
else who can put together the bits
and pieces."
More than a year after an administrative shake-up
that eliminated the Office of Graduate Studies, many
graduate students say that "chaos" and "confusion"
lingers.
Shuttled back and forth among various offices when
they have questions about their fellowships, registra
tion holds or doctoral projects, students like Susan
Bree are becoming increasingly frustrated.
"The problem is that if you have any difficulty what
soever with your graduate requirements, you just get
sent from person to person and everybody will disclaim
responsibility," said Bree, a graduate student in French
and Italian. "You can't ever say, 'You're responsible for
this. Fix it.' "
While recognizing that many of the problems are
probably transitional, many graduate students worry
that without a central advocate for graduate issues, the
larger policy questions — such as monitoring affirma
tive action and overall performance — will be ignored.
"It's become so decentralized that nobody keeps in
mind the broader picture," said Maria Stampino, a
graduate student in French and Italian.
When the Graduate Studies Office — which had
been headed by a full-time dean and had a 38-person
staff — was eliminated in the summer of 1991, the in
dividual departments and schools were expected to
pick up the slack.
But many say the transition was implemented too
quickly, leaving the schools — particularly the School of
Humanities and Sciences and the School of Education,
which had relied heavily on Graduate Studies for ad
ministrative tasks — overworked and underprepared.
"It has been a difficult process because of the rapid
ity with which it happened," said Elizabeth Fitting, di
rector of student services in the School of Education.
"It has definitely meant more work for us, because
we've been given additional tasks and not the same
amount of funding."
Students, too, have been frustrated by the changeover.
"There's an unsureness about where things are going,"
said David Miyahara, a graduate student in sociology and
a member of the Committee on Graduate Studies. "There
doesn't seem to be a set policy on who's going to be re
sponsible for things."
The Graduate Studies Office
was eliminated due to "reposi
tioning" budget cuts and as part
of a general University move
toward more decentralized forms
of management.
Under a decentralized struc
ture, the various schools and
departments have control over
issues such as admissions and
funding that were previously
determined by the central office.
The advantage of the new sys
tem, its supporters say, is greater
autonomy for the departments —
which are closest to the students
and most able to understand their
needs.
"I think in the long run, ser
vices will be delivered to students
a lot better," said Assoc. Political
Science Prof. Judith Goldstein,
chair of the Committee on Gradu
ate Studies. "Centralization is not
always a good thing — it can be a

lot of bureaucracy."
While Goldstein said, "of
course we're moving slowly into
uncharted territory," she believes
the transition has gone relatively
smoothly.
"We haven't specifically seen
any student get hurt by the pro
cess," she said. "If we did I think
we'd look a lot more seriously at
it."
While Fitting said the transi
tion has been difficult, she agreed
that in the long run, decentraliza
tion will allow her school to serve
its students more effectively.
"We have more control of the
processes now," she said. "We
really try to deal with things on
an individual level, and our deans
are very student-oriented. We feel
that, in a way, it's enabled us to
improve that, because we've been
given more autonomy."
