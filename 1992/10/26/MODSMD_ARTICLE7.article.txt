# Grad office cut creates frustration
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
More than a year after an administrative shake-up
that eliminated the Office of Graduate Studies, many
graduate students say that "chaos" and "confusion"
lingers.
Shuttled back and forth among various offices when
they have questions about their fellowships, registra
tion holds or doctoral projects, students like Susan
Bree are becoming increasingly frustrated.
"The problem is that if you have any difficulty what
soever with your graduate requirements, you just get
sent from person to person and everybody will disclaim
responsibility," said Bree, a graduate student in French
and Italian. "You can't ever say, 'You're responsible for
this. Fix it.' "
While recognizing that many of the problems are
probably transitional, many graduate students worry
that without a central advocate for graduate issues, the
larger policy questions — such as monitoring affirma
tive action and overall performance — will be ignored.
"It's become so decentralized that nobody keeps in
mind the broader picture," said Maria Stampino, a
graduate student in French and Italian.
When the Graduate Studies Office — which had
been headed by a full-time dean and had a 38-person
staff — was eliminated in the summer of 1991, the in
dividual departments and schools were expected to
pick up the slack.
But many say the transition was implemented too
quickly, leaving the schools — particularly the School of
Humanities and Sciences and the School of Education,
which had relied heavily on Graduate Studies for ad
ministrative tasks — overworked and underprepared.
"It has been a difficult process because of the rapid
ity with which it happened," said Elizabeth Fitting, di
rector of student services in the School of Education.
"It has definitely meant more work for us, because
we've been given additional tasks and not the same
amount of funding."
Students, too, have been frustrated by the changeover.
"There's an unsureness about where things are going,"
said David Miyahara, a graduate student in sociology and
a member of the Committee on Graduate Studies. "There
doesn't seem to be a set policy on who's going to be re
sponsible for things."
