# Getting focused
## Houses try new idea on for size 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Pointing to a plethora of innov
ative programming ranging from
"intellectual sound bites" on exis
tentialism to "Name That Tune"
from the '60s to the '90s, resi
dents of the new Governor's Cor
ner focus houses say the conver
sion has, to this point, been a suc
cess.
Through a cooperative effort
between the resident fellows of
each of the three dormitories and
the Office of Residential Educa
tion, Potter House has assumed
the focus "American Society: the
Sixties Through the Nineties,"
while Schiff and Murray Houses
have become "Arts and Perform
ing Arts" and "Modern Thought
and Culture," respectively.
Although the RFs for the hous
es approached Res Ed with poten
tial themes in mind, the notion of
developing additional focus hous
es did not originate with them.
"Apparently Res Ed was consid
ering the idea that upper class hous
es might be focus houses," said
Michael Ramsaur, RF for Schiff and
the Chair of the Drama Depart
ment. Res Ed was "willing on a
year-by-year basis to see how the
idea worked with a few test houses."
If these programs are deemed
successful, new focus houses may
be proposed as RFs change, Direc
tor of Res Ed Alice Supton said
last year.
Student interest, an important
component of any measurement of
success, has run fairly high. Ac
cording to Ramsaur, he initially be
came interested in spearheading
the program after some of his stu
dents approached him with ideas.
Each house reserved 20 slots
for students who submitted pro
posals last year in an effort to re
ceive priorities for those houses in
the spring housing lottery, Ram
saur said.
"A fair number of those stu
dents with priorities got in," said
Robert Weisberg, RF for Murray
