# Getting focused
## Houses try new idea on for size 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Pointing to a plethora of innov
ative programming ranging from
"intellectual sound bites" on exis
tentialism to "Name That Tune"
from the '60s to the '90s, resi
dents of the new Governor's Cor
ner focus houses say the conver
sion has, to this point, been a suc
cess.
Through a cooperative effort
between the resident fellows of
each of the three dormitories and
the Office of Residential Educa
tion, Potter House has assumed
the focus "American Society: the
Sixties Through the Nineties,"
while Schiff and Murray Houses
have become "Arts and Perform
ing Arts" and "Modern Thought
and Culture," respectively.
Although the RFs for the hous
es approached Res Ed with poten
tial themes in mind, the notion of
developing additional focus hous
es did not originate with them.
"Apparently Res Ed was consid
ering the idea that upper class hous
es might be focus houses," said
Michael Ramsaur, RF for Schiff and
the Chair of the Drama Depart
ment. Res Ed was "willing on a
year-by-year basis to see how the
idea worked with a few test houses."
If these programs are deemed
successful, new focus houses may
be proposed as RFs change, Direc
tor of Res Ed Alice Supton said
last year.
Student interest, an important
component of any measurement of
success, has run fairly high. Ac
cording to Ramsaur, he initially be
came interested in spearheading
the program after some of his stu
dents approached him with ideas.
Each house reserved 20 slots
for students who submitted pro
posals last year in an effort to re
ceive priorities for those houses in
the spring housing lottery, Ram
saur said.
"A fair number of those stu
dents with priorities got in," said
Robert Weisberg, RF for Murray
and a professor in the Law School.
"Lots of students drew in with a
commitment to the program."
One senior English mqjor plans
to present his honors project, a
monologue on "The Performance
of the Canterbury Tales," to a test
audience in Schiff next week,
Ramsaur said.
Weisberg added that after the
focus assistants in Murray held
"good, pure house discussions" on
seduction and domination in
"Madame Butterfly" and existen
tialism, other residents expressed
interest in leading discussions.
"I really believe that each stu
dent here is an expert at some
thing," said senior Stephan
Gutzeit, one of Murray's two focus
assistants. "Hopefully, the focus
house provides a forum for sharing
that expertise."
Every Thursday night, Murray
has a coffee night that alternates
between being a study hall one
week and a place where people can
get "intellectual sound-bites" the

next, he added.
According to senior Heidi Hess,
a focus assistant for Potter, her
dorm's programming revolves
around the presidential election
this week.
Senior Dezi Nebedum, a focus
assistant in Potter this year and
one of the dorm's resident assis
tants last year, said that because
the focus narrows the range of pos
sible programming topics, actual
events can be more structured and
have a greater impact.
"People feel more open and free
in coming to us with more than
just social things," she added.
In SchifT, staff members are
preparing for their third "Open
Mike Night" for this coming Fri
day. Residents and non-residents
perform every other Friday
evening, said Ramsaur.
In addition, the dorm puts out a
weekly newsletter that highlights
films and events in the Bay Area,
as well as on campus, along with
commentary from the residents.
Although Res Ed has not
increased dorm programming
funds over last year's levels, this
does not appear to be a problem.
"We have had programs in the

past, but now they have an arts
focus," Ramsaur said, mentioning
the SchifT art gallery as one pro
gram carried over from last year.
"There's more work involved [in]
running a house with a focus, but
the rewards are greater."
Already strongly committed to
the Law School, Weisberg said he
finds having a focus in the dorm
gives him the opportunity to share
his humanities background with
undergraduates.
Both Ramsaur and Weisberg
said it is too early to tell whether
the new focus houses will be suc
cessful, yet they said they believed
the program is a good idea.
"I think it would be a good idea
if all houses with resident fellows
had a focus," Ramsaur said. Weis
berg, however, had a different
perspective.
"I don't think it would be a good
idea to set up a particular focus and
to expect Res Ed to keep staffing it
after I'm gone," Weisberg said. But
he still encouraged other RFs to
consider starting focus houses.
As a goal for this year, Weisberg
said he would like for Murray to be
"a suggestive example for other
houses in the future."

of the Canterbury Tales," to a test
audience in Schiff next week,
Ramsaur said.
Weisberg added that after the
focus assistants in Murray held
"good, pure house discussions" on
seduction and domination in
"Madame Butterfly" and existen
tialism, other residents expressed
interest in leading discussions.
"I really believe that each stu
dent here is an expert at some
thing," said senior Stephan
Gutzeit, one of Murray's two focus
assistants. "Hopefully, the focus
house provides a forum for sharing
that expertise."
Every Thursday night, Murray
has a coffee night that alternates
between being a study hall one
week and a place where people can
get "intellectual sound-bites" the

next, he added.
According to senior Heidi Hess,
a focus assistant for Potter, her
dorm's programming revolves
around the presidential election
this week.
Senior Dezi Nebedum, a focus
assistant in Potter this year and
one of the dorm's resident assis
tants last year, said that because
the focus narrows the range of pos
sible programming topics, actual
events can be more structured and
have a greater impact.
"People feel more open and free
in coming to us with more than
just social things," she added.
In SchifT, staff members are
preparing for their third "Open
Mike Night" for this coming Fri
day. Residents and non-residents
perform every other Friday
evening, said Ramsaur.
In addition, the dorm puts out a
weekly newsletter that highlights
films and events in the Bay Area,
as well as on campus, along with
commentary from the residents.
Although Res Ed has not
increased dorm programming
funds over last year's levels, this
does not appear to be a problem.
"We have had programs in the

past, but now they have an arts
focus," Ramsaur said, mentioning
the SchifT art gallery as one pro
gram carried over from last year.
"There's more work involved [in]
running a house with a focus, but
the rewards are greater."
Already strongly committed to
the Law School, Weisberg said he
finds having a focus in the dorm
gives him the opportunity to share
his humanities background with
undergraduates.
Both Ramsaur and Weisberg
said it is too early to tell whether
the new focus houses will be suc
cessful, yet they said they believed
the program is a good idea.
"I think it would be a good idea
if all houses with resident fellows
had a focus," Ramsaur said. Weis
berg, however, had a different
perspective.
"I don't think it would be a good
idea to set up a particular focus and
to expect Res Ed to keep staffing it
after I'm gone," Weisberg said. But
he still encouraged other RFs to
consider starting focus houses.
As a goal for this year, Weisberg
said he would like for Murray to be
"a suggestive example for other
houses in the future."
Pointing to a plethora of innov
ative programming ranging from
"intellectual sound bites" on exis
tentialism to "Name That Tune"
from the '60s to the '90s, resi
dents of the new Governor's Cor
ner focus houses say the conver
sion has, to this point, been a suc
cess.
Through a cooperative effort
between the resident fellows of
each of the three dormitories and
the Office of Residential Educa
tion, Potter House has assumed
the focus "American Society: the
Sixties Through the Nineties,"
while Schiff and Murray Houses
have become "Arts and Perform
ing Arts" and "Modern Thought
and Culture," respectively.
Although the RFs for the hous
es approached Res Ed with poten
tial themes in mind, the notion of
developing additional focus hous
es did not originate with them.
"Apparently Res Ed was consid
ering the idea that upper class hous
es might be focus houses," said
Michael Ramsaur, RF for Schiff and
the Chair of the Drama Depart
ment. Res Ed was "willing on a
year-by-year basis to see how the
idea worked with a few test houses."
If these programs are deemed
successful, new focus houses may
be proposed as RFs change, Direc
tor of Res Ed Alice Supton said
last year.
Student interest, an important
component of any measurement of
success, has run fairly high. Ac
cording to Ramsaur, he initially be
came interested in spearheading
the program after some of his stu
dents approached him with ideas.
Each house reserved 20 slots
for students who submitted pro
posals last year in an effort to re
ceive priorities for those houses in
the spring housing lottery, Ram
saur said.
"A fair number of those stu
dents with priorities got in," said
Robert Weisberg, RF for Murray
and a professor in the Law School.
"Lots of students drew in with a
commitment to the program."
