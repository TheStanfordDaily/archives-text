Major wants EEC unity
LONDON (AP) — Defying rebellious lawmak
ers from his own party, Prime Minister John Major
reiterated his support yesterday for greater Euro
pean unity and said he did not want to see an "iso
lated, sour" Britain.
British news reports said Major had threatened
to resign and call a national election if Parliament
refused to ratify the Maastricht Treaty for closer
political and economic union among the 12 Euro
pean Community member states. Debate begins in
the House of Commons on Nov. 4.
Lithuanians vote in first election
VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Lithuanians
trudged through heavy snow to the polls yesterday
in the country's first parliamentary election since
it won independence from the Soviet Union.
President Vytautas Landsbergis, from the gov
erning Sajudis Popular Front, tops the list of can
didates. But with 16 other parties vying for seats,
there was no guarantee the movement that led
Lithuania to independence would win a majority in
the new parliament.
Voters also were being asked to approve a new
constitution that creates a stronger presidency. It

would provide for popular election of a president,
who currently is chosen by the parliament.
According to preliminary reports, 60 percent of
the electorate had cast their ballots by the time
polls closed at 10 p.m.
LA. Metrolink rail line opens
LOS ANGELES (AP) — This traffic-clogged
metropolis takes another step today toward wean
ing itself from the automobile as commuter trains
begin serving suburban valleys.
But some worry that the cost of riding the
Metrolink rail line — $12 for a round-trip ticket and
$176 for a monthly pass for some riders — won't
end Southern California's love affair with the car.
"The cost . . . that's the only concern I hear
from our employees. I've heard it from the very
beginning," said Joan Boulden, who arranges car
and van pools at Atlantic Richfield Co.'s headquar
ters in downtown Los Angeles.
"The time saving and ease of travel do not seem
to make up for the expense."
Metrolink was made possible by the passage of a
$1 billion statewide bond measure in 1990. The
five-county Southern California Regional Rail
Authority was formed a year later to purchase
rights-of-way for the system and to operate it.
