# Women candidates raise new voice
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff Writer 
When Stanford voters go to the
polls on Election Day, they will see an
unprecedented number of women on
the ballot, from local candidates to the
two front-runners for California's
Senate seats.
Sophomore Shana Yansen of the
Pro-Choice Alliance said as both the
number and visibility of women candi
dates skyrocketed this year, issues
such as abortion rights and child care
have come into the forefront.
Even if the election does not increase
the number of women in Congress, the
campaigns themselves have increased
the strength of the women's voice,
Yansen said. "I think [male candidates)
realize now that they have to listen to
women's concerns to get votes."
Three Democratic women, Senate

hopefuls Dianne Feinstein and Bar
bara Boxer and Congressional candi
date Anna Eshoo, are leading in their
respective races.
"A lot of people are hesitant to call
this the Year of the Woman, but it re
ally is," said sophomore Mike Zwibel
man, President of the Stanford De
mocrats.
With 119 women across the country
running for Senate and Congress — a
60 percent increase from years past —
students like sophomore Britt Wahlin

say they are seeing less disillusion
ment with politics among female Stan
ford students.
Many women, especially those who
have recently reached voting age, say
they feel more connected with the po
litical process from which older gener
ations may have grown up feeling
alienated.
"I've noticed a lot of freshmen

women come into Stanford already re
ally involved in politics or acutely
aware of the issues," Wahlin said. "I
think this has increased as time has
progressed and more women candi
dates have moved to the forefront."

Although leaders of political groups
on campus agree there is a lot of excite

ment on campus about this year's
strong women candidates, they are re
luctant to say there has been increased
activism specifically for women's cam
paigns.
