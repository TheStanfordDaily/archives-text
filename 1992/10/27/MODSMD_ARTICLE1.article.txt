# Women candidates raise new voice
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff Writer 
When Stanford voters go to the
polls on Election Day, they will see an
unprecedented number of women on
the ballot, from local candidates to the
two front-runners for California's
Senate seats.
Sophomore Shana Yansen of the
Pro-Choice Alliance said as both the
number and visibility of women candi
dates skyrocketed this year, issues
such as abortion rights and child care
have come into the forefront.
Even if the election does not increase
the number of women in Congress, the
campaigns themselves have increased
the strength of the women's voice,
Yansen said. "I think [male candidates)
realize now that they have to listen to
women's concerns to get votes."
Three Democratic women, Senate

hopefuls Dianne Feinstein and Bar
bara Boxer and Congressional candi
date Anna Eshoo, are leading in their
respective races.
"A lot of people are hesitant to call
this the Year of the Woman, but it re
ally is," said sophomore Mike Zwibel
man, President of the Stanford De
mocrats.
With 119 women across the country
running for Senate and Congress — a
60 percent increase from years past —
students like sophomore Britt Wahlin

say they are seeing less disillusion
ment with politics among female Stan
ford students.
Many women, especially those who
have recently reached voting age, say
they feel more connected with the po
litical process from which older gener
ations may have grown up feeling
alienated.
"I've noticed a lot of freshmen

women come into Stanford already re
ally involved in politics or acutely
aware of the issues," Wahlin said. "I
think this has increased as time has
progressed and more women candi
dates have moved to the forefront."
Student support
Although leaders of political groups
on campus agree there is a lot of excite

ment on campus about this year's
strong women candidates, they are re
luctant to say there has been increased
activism specifically for women's cam
paigns.

teers, Zwibelman said the organi
zation's interest is in both Eshoo
the Democrat as well as Eshoo the
woman.
Similarly, senior Kim Yang
emphasizes that her own full-time
involvement with Eshoo's cam
paign is based on the candidate's
personal merits as well as Yang's
own interest in women politicians.
But student leaders recognize
the danger in pushing "The Year
of the Woman" and thus creating
a misconception that gender is a
qualification.
"It is counterproductive to sup
port candidates purely on the basis
of gender," Yang said.
Nevertheless, the exposure the
Stanford community has had to
female candidates has led to
increased awareness and strong
support on campus.
Women's Center Coordinator
Rebecca Bliss said she is pleased
about the strong female candidates
on the ticket this year, especially
because many are locally based.
"With candidates like Anna
Eshoo running, we at Stanford
have access to prominent candi
dates," she said.
Eshoo, whose campaign is based
in Palo Alto, has targeted Stanford
voters by portraying herself as a
young, progressive Democratic can
didate. Since the primary, Eshoo
has frequently appeared on campus
to court the Stanford vote.
A Daily poll showed that as of
last week, 31 percent of Stanford
students planned to vote for Eshoo,

9 percent for Republican candidate
Tom Huening and 60 percent were
undecided.
Last week, nearly 200 faculty
members officially endorsed Eshoo
in a move that is likely to sway a
large number of undecided voters
on campus.
Wahlin said Stanford students
"made a difference in getting Anna
(Eshoo) on the ballot" during the
primaries. "Students walked
precincts, and it united a lot of peo
ple."
Wahlin pointed out that she and
other students are pleased that can
didates like Boxer and two-year
Senate candidate Feinstein "feel
confident with what are feminist
beliefs."
But Boxer and Feinstein's suc
cess will depend on being able to
attract votes from both women and
men. Wahlin said that "quite a few
male Democrats support Boxer and
Feinstein."
The number of women on the
ballot this year has also drawn in
campus women's groups, such as
the Pro-Choice Alliance and the
Women's Center Collective, that
may not have followed the races as
closely in the past, Wahlin said.
The need for a voice
Members of the Stanford com
munity agreed the general percep
tion that women were underrepre
sented in government — and there
fore did not have a voice — influ
enced a relatively large number of
women to run.
And recent events, such as the
Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hear
ings, have brought further atten
tion to the lack of women in the
Senate, Yang said.

Zwibelman said the lack of diver
sity in the Judiciary Committee for
the Thomas case has been a point of
contention for many women in pol
itics.
"The Judiciary Committee for
the Thomas hearings was all men,
most of them over 50," he said.
"They were totally out of touch
with the world."
With only two women, Zwibel
man emphasized that the current
Senate is not representative of the
population.
"If you've ever looked down at
the Senate in session, it doesn't
take long to notice they're all the
same," he said. "They're all bald
ing and graying, wearing dark
suits and red ties."
Yang said it was ironic that 'the'
two prominent women candidates
running for Senate in California
alone may double the number of
women in the Senate, from two to
four.
With the issues surrounding this
election, the need has arisen for so
called "women's issues" to be per
ceived as "human issues," said
Prof. Jane Collier, Feminist Studies
Department Chair.
"People just don't get it," she
said. "Reproductive freedom, child
care, parental leave — these things
affect everyone.
"(President) Bush's policies are
not paying attention to the real
needs of families and women who
work," she said, citing his veto of
the Family Leave Act.
A question of choice
"The fact that many women
support reproductive freedom is
not reflected in our laws," Yansen
said. "And that goes back to the

lawmakers. It's definitely a moti
vating factor for women to run."
A recent Supreme Court case
which allowed Pennsylvania's
restrictions on abortion brought to
light the tenacity of Roe v. Wade,
Zwibelman said. •
"Women are going, 'Wait a
minute, 83 percent of counties
have limits on abortion,' and real
izing something needs to be
done," he said.
Collier said the backpedaling
from Roe v. Wade has scared
women sufficiently and has spurred
them to a new awareness of the
issues.
"We're realizing that we could
be back to backroom abortions, and
it's time for a change," she
explained.
'Shaking up' Congress
Yang said having more women
in Congress will change its dynam
ics as well as its policies.
"In any situation, even in social
interactions, people talk different
ly and about different subjects
within a same-sex group than they
do when you add members of the
opposite sex," she explained.
"We need to get people used to
seeing women's faces in Senate and
create a norm," Yang said, pointing
out that considering the "Year of the
Woman" a phenomenon attests to
the lack of women in government.
Stanford's supporters of women
candidates are looking ahead to
Election Day with guarded opti
mism.
Zwibelman said he "can see an
Eshoo-Feinstein-Boxer sweep. On a
personal level, I think it's terrific
they're going to shake up the U.S.
Senate."
