New poll, same standings
NEW YORK (AP) — Bill Clinton's lead over
President Bush increased slightly to 11 points in
two polls released yesterday.
Clinton led 44 to 33 in ABC's poll of 1,332 likely
voters and 42 to 31 in the Cable News Network-
USA Today poll of 1,000 registered voters. In
ABC's poll, taken Friday through Sunday, Ross
Perot rose two points to 19 percent. Perot was also
at 19 percent in the CNN-USA Today poll taken
Saturday and Sunday, putting him down one point
from a Friday-Saturday sample. The margins of
error in both polls were 3 percent.
A separate CNN-USA Today poll found that
Perot has edged out Clinton as the candidate voters
see as best able to handle the economy. Thirty
eight percent said Perot would do best, 33 percent
Clinton and 23 percent Bush.
More plots from Perot
Ross Perot took over a campaign briefing in Dal
las yesterday and angrily repeated his suspicions
that the Republicans had concocted a plan to smear
his daughter and sidetrack his candidacy.
Meanwhile, all three candidates continued to

campaign hard, in their own ways.
Perot aired an hour-long commercial prior to
Monday Night Football on ABC, half a rerun of a
segment featuring family members and half a new
show on his plans to create jobs.
Bill Clinton and running mate A 1 Gore rode a
bus through North Carolina yesterday, taking
questions from citi2ens on CBS morning television.
President Bush, campaigning in Colorado, New
Mexico and lowa, hoped to rally voters with a
pledge that he would make domestic affairs the
focus of his second term.
Perot caused a sensation as the candidate dis
cussed how he had been a victim of death threats,
wiretapping and political tricks.
When pressed for details, however, he conceded
that he had no direct evidence of any dirty tricks.
The Bush campaign issued a statement saying it
had never "attempted, directly or indirectly, to tap
Mr. Perot's telephones, disrupt his daughter's wed
ding, alter photographs of Mr. Perot or his family,
or take any other action to interfere with the pri
vate lives of Mr. Perot of his family."
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater went
on the attack, saying Perot "seems to have latched
onto this theory much like other people latch onto
UFO theories, and he seems to believe it."
