Canada heads toward disunion
TORONTO (AP) â€” Canadian voters were head
ing toward a rejection yesterday of constitutional
reforms designed to put an end to 200 years of
French-English squabbling and keep Canada unit
ed, according to early unofficial returns.
Failure of a single province to approve the
reforms would kill the deal, which represented the
farthest-reaching attempt to modernize Canada's
political structure by balancing provincial and fed
eral rights and resolving long-standing differences
between the nation's French and English speakers.
The ultimate effect could be the breakup of the
country, but the more likely effect will be to set
aside constitutional issues for the immediate
future and continue with the current system.
Yesterday's referendum appeared doomed in
French-speaking Quebec, according to federal elec
tions figures compiled by the news agency Canadian
Press and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
With 29 percent of the votes counted in Quebec,
the "No" vote was leading with 58 percent, while
the "Yes" vote had 42 percent, Canapress reported.
With 20 percent counted in Ontario, the "No"
vote was ahead 51 percent, to 48 percent for those
in favor of the reforms, it said.
The referendum's roots lay in negotiations ini

tially begun to dampen secessionist sentiment in
Quebec by granting it special status.
But many Canadians have come to think of
rejecting the reforms as a way to get back at Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, the most unpopular
Canadian leader in post-war history.
Mulroney said that if the package failed in any
one province, the deal was dead. It would be "moral
ly unacceptable" for a provincial legislature to pass
the reforms after rejection by its voters, he said.
The key parts of the agreement recognize Que
bec as a "distinct society" with the right to protect
its French language and culture. It would guaran
tee Quebec 25 percent of the seats in the House of
Commons and three of the Supreme Court's nine
seats permanently.
The reforms would change the appointed Senate
to an elected body with each province having six
members. The less populated provinces have com
plained about the political dominance of Ontario
and Quebec, which have more than half of Cana
da's people.
The package also would recognizes the inherent
right of the aboriginal people to self-government.
The referendum was actually a non-binding
plebiscite. The constitution can be amended only
with approval of the federal Parliament and the
legislatures of all 10 provinces.
