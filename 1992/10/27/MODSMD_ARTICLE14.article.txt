NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) â€”
Israel deployed war jets, missile
boats, helicopter gunships and
artillery against guerrilla targets
in Lebanon yesterday after a road
side bombing Sunday killed five
Israeli soldiers in southern
Lebanon.
Police said at least seven people
were killed and 11 wounded over
all in the strikes and in counter
strikes by Muslim guerrillas.
Israel's reprisals targeted fun
damentalist hideouts in south
Lebanon and a Palestinian refugee
camp in the north, more than 100
miles from the border.
The bombing Sunday in the
Jewish state's self-designated
"security zone" was the deadliest
blow against Israeli forces in two
years. The Shiite Muslim Hezbol
lah, or Party of God, claimed

responsibility.
The violence dramatically
increased tension in the region as
Israeli and Arab negotiators held
peace talks in Washington. The
Iranian-backed Hezbollah opposes
the talks.
Israel said its targets in the
Nahr el-Bared refugee camp in the
north were bases of the Palestini
an fundamentalist Islamic Jihad
and the radical Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-Gener
al Command. The two factions
recently claimed attacks in Israeli
occupied territories.
Police said three Israeli missile
boats blasted the camp at 9:30
p.m.
Fires lit up the area. Police said
at least one Palestinian was killed,
and two were wounded.
Earlier, Israeli aircraft struck

targets in south Lebanon in four
separate air raids and artillery
exchanges with Hezbollah posi
tions.
Hezbollah's leader, Sheik Has
san Nasrallah, ordered a general
mobilization of the group's 3,500
hard-core fighters, an announce
ment that suggested he was send
ing fighters entrenched in east
Lebanon to the south.
Hezbollah guerrillas sporadi
cally lobbed mortars and rockets
into the security zone after night
fall. Police said two Lebanese were
killed and two wounded in the
Israeli-held enclave.
Also yesterday, a roadside
bomb, similar to Sunday's, explod
ed inside Israel's enclave, wound
ing three patrolmen of the South
Lebanon Army. No one claimed
responsibility.
