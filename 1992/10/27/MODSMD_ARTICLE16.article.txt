### 
Feinstein's history of
leadership makes her
the clear choice in '92

FROM THE IMAGES por
trayed in their position
papers, U.S. Senate candi
dates Dianne Feinstein and John
Seymour seem more similar than
not. Both have positioned them
selves as moderates who are con
servative on fiscal issues, liberal on
social ones and tough on crime.
This race exhibits none of the ide
ological free-for-all found in the
Boxer-Herschensohn contest.
These similarities are, however,
superficial. Dianne Feinstein, the
former mayor of San Francisco,
has a track record as a credible
leader with consistent stances on
issues. In contrast, John Seymour,
the incumbent Senator and former
mayor of Anaheim, has shown lit
tle leadership during his two years
in the U.S. Senate. He has instead
concentrated on shoring up an
unstable political base — trying to
appear moderate on abortion and
the environment while towing the
Republican party line on other
issues.
When Pete Wilson left his Sen
ate seat to become governor two
years ago, he appointed John Sey
mour to the position. Seymour was
relatively unknown publicly but
well-known within political circles
for his ability to raise huge
amounts of money — an impor
tant skill in California politics.
Seymour's position statements
repeat the usual platitudes of
moderate conservatism. He
favors cuts in the capital-gains
tax, providing the president with
a line-item budget veto, minimal
cuts in defense, some kind of
health care "reform" short of
national health insurance and
environmental protection moder
ated by economic considerations.
None of these positions is espe

cially ground-breaking or contro
versial.
On one noteworthy occasion,
Seymour broke from the Republi
can pack. This occurred in 1989,
after the Supreme Court's Webster
decision, when he changed his pre
vious opposition to abortion to
support of choice. However, on
other issues critical to the Republi
can leadership, Seymour has
notably voted along party lines, as
when he voted in favor of Clarence
Thomas' nomination to the
Supreme Court. In California
environmental disputes, he has
sided with central valley farmers
and opposed legislation supported
by environmentalists and urban
water districts.
Taken together, Seymour's posi
tions and political history suggest
more a tendency toward political
expediency than a coherent set of
beliefs.
When Dianne Feinstein as
sumed office after the assassina
tions of former mayor George
Moscone and supervisor Harvey
Milk, San Francisco was on a eco
nomic downward slide. Her terms
as mayor brought sound fiscal
management to the city while cre
ating a cooperative atmosphere in
the uniquely diverse city.
While her positions on issues
like investment in infrastructure,
cuts in defense spending and
national health care call for mod
erate changes, they represent a
step forward from current political
stagnation.
Feinstein has been criticized by
liberal detractors in the same way
that Seymour is criticized by his
more conservative opponents.
During her terms as San Francis
co's mayor, Feinstein was criticized
by liberals as being overly pro
business; her support for the death
penalty has been called expedient.
She is no outsider to politics. How
ever, she has clearly shown the
ability to get things done.
Dianne Feinstein is the right
choice for U.S. Senate because her
proven leadership ability promises
she will be an effective Senator.
