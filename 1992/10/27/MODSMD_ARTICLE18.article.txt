# Andrea Parkes
## One individual, one vote 
### 
IN EXACTLY ONE WEEK I will be
casting my vote for the one man who
will represent America to its citizens
and the rest of the world. My social con
science compels me to pull the lever for
what I believe in. But my soul squirms at
such simplicity. What is it that I am sur
rendering?
First of all, my individuality. Casting a
vote means announcing that I am an
American. Underneath a socially responsi
ble veneer, my individualist self balks at
the idea of succumbing to the labels of a
particular country, a particular party, a
particular history.
That the thought of using a label imme
diately makes me begin inventing odd
combinations of quotation marks and ital
ics to get around using them is indicative
of the discomfort they cause me. They
enclose the unique, diverse, conflicting
elements that are so important in defining
the individual into limiting categories. A
story tells me more than a thousand
debates.
Secondly, by voting I surrender my
options. Choosing one position or the other
as outlined on a page shuts down the pos
sibility of enacting a whole range of others
that haven't even been considered. Experi
ence does not suggest simple yeas or nays.
I am overwhelmed by the obstacles
involved in converting the experiences of
individuals into national or international
policy. How can laws that try to be logical

govern people who often are not?
Language itself is a simplification of
experience — and the distillation of emo
tions and thoughts into characters or
sounds is an imperfect translation. An
attempt to explain one's true meaning
would produce a world where opinion
columns are as big as course readers.
And yet, how could we communicate
without categories? To stand at a cross
roads forever, to choose to not choose,
would be stifling for the individual as well
as a society as a whole.
Is it more frightening to belong, or
never to belong?
There's a story by Nella Larsen called
"Quicksand," about a woman who has a
black father from Chicago and a white
mother from Denmark. Her attempts to
belong in various communities always end
in her not being able to give up her
uniqueness for the stability of one particu
lar lifestyle. Once she makes an irrevoca
ble choice, however, her psyche slips into
solipsism.
I am more practical than to suggest
that we are all too individual to ever be
able to relate to each other at some level —
eternal individualization would equal
anarchy. The world is huge and incompre
hensibly complex. Even vaguely to under
stand its workings means having to sim
plify its peoples. And simplifications mean
stereotypes, stereotypes mean division,
tension, pain.

So here is the paradox represented by a
vote: To function in a world defined by
regions of land and bounded by language,
one must affiliate and be affiliated. But in
being defined by a label, one sacrifices a
primary freedom. I lose my right to be an
individual when I exercise my right to be
an American. But if I am not an American,
where do I belong?
It's a sacrifice I have very little choice
but to make — no social security card, no
paycheck; no passport, no plane tickets; no
vocabulary, no voice.
If there is one element of the American
that I can relate to, it's the restlessness
that is the force of its history — to move,
to change, to drive long distances in the
name of adventure. I suppose the freedom
to be an individual is what America is all
about.
So, yes, I will punch in my choices on
Nov. 3, but not without acknowledging the
paradox of existing both as an individual
and an American. To be a citizen of the
world, I become less a citizen of my self.
