## Judicial affairs officer clears up misconduct questions 
### 
Recent editorials in The
Daily and The Stanford Review
have raised questions about the
student judicial process, due process
rights, confidentiality and appropriate
penalties for admitted or proven mis
conduct. I write to share information
on these matters and to correct some
wrong impressions.
Stanford students accused of miscon
duct have the right to confidential hear
ings in the University disciplinary pro
cess. This right may be waived if a stu
dent requests a public hearing, a fre
quent choice in the era of campus disrup
tions. In the past decade, however, only
one student has opted for a public hear
ing.
Given this privacy guarantee, campus
reporters sometimes are frustrated in
trying to report the progress and out
come of cases that are both well-known
and important. Not surprisingly,
reporters resort to a lot of reading
between the lines and other forms of

journalistic invention. Unfortunately,
readers may be seriously misled by such
editorial license, as in the Review's
recent opinion concerning Stuart
Thomas.
Because I and others involved in the
student judicial process are not free to
tell the Stanford community the details
of any judicial case, some reporters
have focused on a few words in the
judicial affairs report that was released
at the beginning of the term. It men
tioned a Fundamental Standard case
involving "exploitive, manipulative con
duct" that led to a penalty of withhold
ing a student's degree conferral for two
years beyond academic eligibility — a
description that led the student press
to conclude that the student was Mr.
Thomas.
I am not free to elaborate upon what
those three words encapsulate. I can,
however, describe what a typical contest
ed disciplinary case involves. First, there
is a detailed charge memorandum that

specifies the facts I believe constitute a
violation of University student conduct
regulations; this initiates the judicial
process.
Then there is a hearing before a non-
Stanford hearing officer, an attorney
whose job is to make factual findings
based on a "beyond a reasonable doubt"
standard of proof. Next there is a hear
ing before the Stanford Judicial Council,
a student/faculty group which decides if
those facts constitute a violation of stu
dent conduct regulations; it then sub
mits a report to the president summariz
ing the proceedings to date and recom
mending a particular disposition. And,
finally, there is the actual penalty
imposed by the president and communi
cated in writing to the Judicial Council,
the student and others directly involved
in the particular case.
My title and role get the big press but
my involvement injudicial cases is
marginal once the decision is made to
proceed with a formal process.

In summary, unless and until each
segment of the Stanford community
votes to change the right of students to
a confidential judicial process, the
administration may not initiate the
release of factual information about any
case.
In the meantime, I will continue to
release an annual report with summary
statistics and minimal descriptions of the
cases that went through the student dis
ciplinary process in any given year. In
addition to "exploitive, manipulative con
duct," the recent report also mentioned
"assault," "false allegations," "unpermit
ted aid," "misrepresentation" and "falsi
fication of data."
If campus reporters choose to read
into these brief descriptions entire
morality plays of good, evil, justice, dan
ger and duplicity. . .well, maybe it grabs
the readers attention. It's a far cry from
what really happened.
