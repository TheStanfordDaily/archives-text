# Senior plunges into Eshoo's campaign
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
While some students have gained campus notori
ety by leading athletic teams to victory or heading
up student organizations, senior Kim Yang has es
tablished her claim to Stanford fame as "the one
who registered University President Gerhard
Casper to vote."
Yang was registering voters in Palo Alto as part
of her work as a local field organizer with the Anna
Eshoo campaign when "a man in a T-shirt and
shorts came up to register."

"When he gave me the form, I noticed that he
had put down Stanford as the city but he left the Zip
code blank. So I said, 'I know the Stanford Zip code.'
"Then I looked up at the name — 'Gerhard
Casper' — and finally recognized him. I had seen his
picture before, but I just never pictured him in such
casual clothing."
When asked what party Casper registered with,
Yang smiled as if she had fielded this question quite
a few times before and said, "I'm not supposed to
say. Even though my candidate is a Democrat, we
register voters from all parties."
But in the larger scheme of things, registering

Stanford's president to vote was just one task in a
day of Yang's work on congressional candidate
Eshoo's campaign.
Yang, a human biology and feminist studies
major, stopped out this quarter to work approxi
mately 80 hours per week on Eshoo's campaign.
Driven by her interest in politics and women can
didates, Yang has been involved in the National
Women's Political Caucus since last fall and in
Eshoo's campaign since the beginning of the prima
ry season.
"No two days on the campaign are the
same," Yang said, looking down at her T
shirt (complete with a large red "Anna"
button) and shorts. "I look so grungy
because I've been moving boxes.
"Today I did grunt work; tomorrow I
could be at a reception, sitting next to the
vice president of Apple Computer."
Although Yang described her job as
"very stressful," she hardly seemed phased
by her high-pressure, whirlwind life, which
includes serving as the organizer of the
Jing Lyman lecture series.
Her busy pattern was established during
the summer of 1991, when she interned at
the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the
National Women's Political Caucus and
was eventually offered a full-time paid posi
tion for the fall.
When Yang returned to Stanford, she
founded the Stanford Women's Political
Caucus, a branch of the national organiza
tion, with a group of other students and
"wound up diving right into primary sea
son.
She volunteered for Eshoo's campaign
and applied for the job she now holds before
the primary — taking a gamble on the
results of the election.
"If she hadn't won, I wouldn't have had
a job," Yang said. "But I was so convinced I
wanted to do it that I told the campaign I
would do whatever it took to get the job,
including stopping out of school."
After Eshoo won the primary, Yang was
told she would most likely be offered the job,
but she would have to wait until August.
"I worked seven jobs this summer to
save up enough money to stay here," she
said. "Six of them were simultaneous."
At the end of the summer, the job was
hers, and it was full speed ahead.

"It's been great working on a local cam
paign because we get so much more contact
with the candidate than in bigger cam
paigns," she said. "Working on a smaller
campaign, I also get so much more respon
sibility."
And for Yang, responsibility inspires
both motivation and fear.
"I know I can't fall apart," she said,
explaining that she has to reach her share
of voters and recruit enough volunteers to
make sure the office fulfills its quota of vot
ers reached by phone or precinct-walking.
"If I don't make sure that everything is
taken care of before Election Day, then my
candidate is dead," she said. "That's
enough to make me want to phone until the
cows come home."
Incidentally, with her 7 a.m.-to-10:30
p.m., 7-day-a-week schedule, Yang said she
sleeps "five hours a night — seven if I'm
real lucky."
Judging by the collection of campaign
buttons on her backpack to the Eshoo,
Dianne Feinstein, Barbara Boxer and other
female candidates' bumper stickers on her
car, Yang has clearly immersed herself in
politics and its women candidates.
However, Yang pointed out that she
does not want people to believe that she
would "-endorse any candidate just because
[the candidate] was female."
Although she recognizes the importance
of increasing the number of women in
Congress, she "would never choose a female
who wasn't the best candidate for the job.
"It would work against what (women]
are working for, which is to gain credibili
ty," she said.
As the countdown to Election Day nears,
Yang braces herself from what she said is
sure to be a "close race" against Eshoo's
opponent, Tom Huening.
Dropping her superhumanly energetic
demeanor for a moment, Yang anticipated
the culmination of her work by simply say
ing, "It's going to be a very long night."
