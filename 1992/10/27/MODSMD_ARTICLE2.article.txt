# Senior plunges into Eshoo's campaign

### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
While some students have gained campus notori
ety by leading athletic teams to victory or heading
up student organizations, senior Kim Yang has es
tablished her claim to Stanford fame as "the one
who registered University President Gerhard
Casper to vote."
Yang was registering voters in Palo Alto as part
of her work as a local field organizer with the Anna
Eshoo campaign when "a man in a T-shirt and
shorts came up to register."

"When he gave me the form, I noticed that he
had put down Stanford as the city but he left the Zip
code blank. So I said, 'I know the Stanford Zip code.'
"Then I looked up at the name — 'Gerhard
Casper' — and finally recognized him. I had seen his
picture before, but I just never pictured him in such
casual clothing."
When asked what party Casper registered with,
Yang smiled as if she had fielded this question quite
a few times before and said, "I'm not supposed to
say. Even though my candidate is a Democrat, we
register voters from all parties."
But in the larger scheme of things, registering

Stanford's president to vote was just one task in a
day of Yang's work on congressional candidate
Eshoo's campaign.
Yang, a human biology and feminist studies
major, stopped out this quarter to work approxi
mately 80 hours per week on Eshoo's campaign.
Driven by her interest in politics and women can
didates, Yang has been involved in the National
Women's Political Caucus since last fall and in
Eshoo's campaign since the beginning of the prima
ry season.
