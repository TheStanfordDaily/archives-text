# Criticism of Bush's foreign policy ignores big picture
## 
### 
Although I am not an avid supporter
of President Bush, I believe that Dale
Edmondson and Laurie Koon's letter of
Oct. 20 is not a fair assessment of the
president's foreign policy record. To begin
with, the letter focuses almost entirely on
one aspect of the Bush foreign policy,
namely its Chinese strategy, and extrapo
lates from it that Bush is "sadly lacking
in foreign policy expertise."
No mention at all in the letter is
made of Bush's other foreign policy
achievements: the unprecedented arms
reduction agreements which the Bush
administration negotiated with Mikhail
Gorbachev, the U.S.'s very adroit han
dling of German reunification while still
preserving NATO, Secretary of State

James Baker's impressive — if not
wholly successful — handling of the
Middle East peace process, Bush's pru
dent behavior during and after the
August 1991 Soviet coup, or the admin
istration's completion, after years of
effort, of the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
With regard to Edmondson and
Koon's criticism of the president's
China policy, I am still unsure what
they think the U.S.'s proper policy
ought to be. Should we "take a stand
against China's aggressive policies" and
restrict or cut off our trade links with
red China?
Cutting off the trade may seem
"moral" but it won't bring back the dead

of Tiananmen, nor is it likely to force out
their butchers. Instead, it will probably
hurt precisely those economic reforms
and budding Chinese entrepreneurs
whom we would like to see prosper. Like
it or not, our ability to foster political
reform in China is much less than our
ability to further economic reform.
Whether Bush's decision to sell F
-168 to Taiwan was actually the cause of
China's sale of nuclear technology is as
yet unclear. The sale was probably
unwise but I suspect the China will sell
its arms to Third World countries no
matter what we do. As for Bush's
"unbelievably clumsy resolution of the
Gulf War," I remind Edmondson and
Koon that the U.S.'s U.N. mandate in

the Gulf War authorized the coalition
only to liberate Kuwait, not to change
the Iraqi government or renew its bor
ders. It is not even clear whether the
current "no-fly zone" in Southern Shi
ite Iraq was authorized by the U.N.
resolutions.
To be sure, the Bush administration
has made its share of foreign policy
mistakes; I challenge the critics to
name a president (of any country, for
that matter) who hasn't made any. But
overall I think Bush's foreign policy
record is definitely better than average.
Whether this is reason enough to re
elect him is up to the individual voter.
