## Stanford netters dominate Rolex Championships Poruri downs Willens in singles final, Kurth-Berris take doubles 
### Mike Langford Editorial staff 
What's a poor women's tennis coach
to do?
After this weekend's Rolex North
west Women's Tennis Championships,
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan
may soon have a serious dilemma on his
hands. Of nine entered singles players,
six made it to the quarterfinals. Of
three entered doubled teams, all made it
to the semifinals.
Is this a problem?
"Oh yeah it's a problem," Brennan
said. "But it's the kind of problem every
coach would like to have."
In last weekend's tournament, which
concluded yesterday, Brennan's Cardi
nal squad completely dominated. By the
time the singles semifinals rolled
around, all non-Stanford players could
have gone home. The same was true of
the doubles finals.
"I am very pleased," Brennan said.
"Very happy. We had great perfor
mances team-wise and a lot of individu
al bright spots."
Two of those bright spots were creat
ed by Laxmi Poruri and Heather Wil
lens. Stanford's two best players met
each other in the final and showed why
they have garnered preseason rankings
of second and fourth in the nation,
respectively.
In the semis, Willens defeated team
mate Kim Shasby 5-7, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3.
Shasby, the tournament's 15th seed,
had beaten fourth-seeded Tracee Lee of
Pacific 6-4, 6-7 (1-7), 6-0 in the quarter
finals. The redshirt freshman's long
awaited performance earned the praise
of her coach.
"There have been a lot of people
waiting to see what Kim could do,"
Brennan said. "Teammates, coaches,
fans. And she was just great, in both
singles and doubles."
Shasby also defeated freshman team
mate Beth Berris, the No. 1-rated
recruit in the nation and sixth seed in
the tournament, by a score of 6-4, 6-2.
Berris also had an impressive debut.
"I'm very pleased with Beth's play,"
Brennan said. "The first collegiate level
matches are never easy, and she did a
great job."

In the other semifinal, Poruri defeat
ed fellow Stanford junior Kristine
Kurth 6-2,6-4. Kurth, on her way to the
semis, had beaten teammate Emma
Woodhouse in the quarterfinals 6-2, 6-
2. She had also taken down Stanford
frosh Sonya Cotero earlier in the tour
nament 6-2, 7-5.
"Kurth was great — very focused,"
Brennan said. "She was injured much of
last year, and now she's showing the
kind of player she is."
In the final, Poruri, having just fin
ished a physics midterm, downed Wil
lens 6-4, 6-3. But the ease with which
she won may be a bit deceiving.
"Willens was not at her best, which
means she must be very good," Brennan
explained.
On the other hand, Poruri did finish
third in the NCAA Championship sin
gles tournament last year and could
conceivably play No. 1 singles for the
Cardinal this year, barring Brennan's
penchant for rigid lineups (Willens
played No. 1 last season).
"Laxmi looked great," Brennan said.
"She's improved dramatically since this
time last year. Her commitment to the
game is really paying off."
In doubles play, Poruri and Willens
— the second-ranked doubles tandem in
the land — was edged out by Kurth and
Berris in the championship final, 6-1,3-
6, 6-2. The Kurth-Berris team had also
defeated teammates Shasby and Amy
Chiminello 6-2, 6-1 in the semifinals.

Chiminello, the ninth seed in the sin
gles draw, lost a tough match to Pacif
ic's Kimberly Chang 5-7, 6-1, 2-6 in the
second round. However, Brennan saw
positives in the sophomore's play.
"Amy's been working on things, so
her performance was deceiving," Bren
nan said. "She is improving and making
herself into quite a good player."
Woodhouse also showed improve
ment. After suffering a hamstring
injury which limited her action for
much of last year, the junior had an
impressive win over eighth-seeded Cara
Abe of California before falling to
Kurth.
Senior Mario Carruth, after falling to
14th-seeded Veena Prabhakar in the
first round, proceeded to tear up the
consolation bracket. Carruth finally lost
to Washington's Lisa Proctor, who went
on to the consolation final.
Performances by players such as
Woodhouse, Chiminello, Shasby,
Cotero and Carruth show the Cardi
nal's depth while posing interesting
questions about the season ahead.
Who will the top six be? Where in the
lineup will they play? Will the talent
and depth be enough to beat Florida
and Texas and bring the NCAA Cham
pionship back home?
Meanwhile, Brennan will have to
bide his time trying to fit an excess of
talent into a limited amount of playing
positions.
Poor guy.
