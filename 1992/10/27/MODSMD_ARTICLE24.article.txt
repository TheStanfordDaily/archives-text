# Is best Cardinal defense a changed offense? Huskies await...
## 
### 
Ring. . .ring. The Cardinal offense
needs a wake-up call some time
before 12:30 p.m. Saturday. This
slumbering bunch showed few signs of
life last week in a 27-21 win over hapless
Oregon State.
A repeat performance will make for
an ugly Huskies' clobbering in Seattle
this weekend. Therefore, a few twists in
the playbook are in order.
In the last three weeks, Bill Walsh's
pride and joy has simply been unable to
move the ball. The problems have been
many. A veteran offensive line has
somehow failed to click. Inexperienced
receivers have yet to exploit man-to
man coverage. Injuries have hampered
both Steve Stenstrom and Glyn Mil
burn.
But what has given Stanford's
offense the most trouble this season is
defensive quickness. Unfortunately,
Washington has plenty of it.
The Cardinal offense (especially if
Milburn's availability is limited) is a

slow unit. Their three most anemic
offensive showings this year have come
against defenses with superior speed.
Texas A&M held Stanford to just 236
yards and a touchdown in the season
opener. UCLA, a talented defensive
team despite their poor Pac-10 record,
limited the Cardinal offense to 10 points
and 259 total yards. And Arizona, with
one of the quickest defenses in the coun
try, humiliated Walsh's cadre by allow
ing only 146 yards and two field goals.
Stanford's lone truly impressive
offensive outing came in the upset at

South Bend. Yet that performance can,
so to speak, be explained away by the
Irish defense's lack of speed. While they
have shut down some quality oppo
nents, Notre Dame is by no means fleet
of foot.
So the problem that faces the Cardi
nal this weekend is how to cope with
Washington's speed advantage: their
ability to stay with receivers and not get
beat deep, their strong sideline-to-side
line pursuit on sweeps and their quick,
ferocious pass rush.
Walsh said his offense was "out
quicked" by Arizona — if the
same thing is to be avoided in
Seattle, Stanford needs to present a
more creative offensive approach.
To be sure, we all know Walsh is the
offensive genius in these parts. Three
Super Bowl rings and a decade of NFL
standard-setting speak for themselves.
Lowly sports writers, on the other
hand, are in no position to play offensive

coordinator from the press box. Hell, I
can't even beat Joel Stein or Dean Jean
in the lousy Greek Picks; I'm not about
to start questioning the play calling of
the "greatest offensive mind of this
era."
But maybe there are a few things
we've yet to see from the Cardinal that
just might be effective against the
defensive prowess of the Rose Bowl
champs.
All season long, opposing pass rushes

have wreaked havoc on Stenstrom. Even
the lowly Beavers sacked him three
times. Perhaps the standard drop in the
pocket needs to be reconsidered. When's
the last time you saw Stanford run a
draw? Invite a pass rush, and let Mil
burn make them pay for it up the mid
dle. Pre-set screens haven't been a cor
nerstone either. But a few dump-offs to
J.J. Lasley with two linemen lead-block
ing could make the Huskies think twice
before sending their rushers full-bore at
the Cardinal's battered signal caller.
Milburn's "Bob sweep" play ate up
the plodding Irish in the second half
four weeks ago, but the pursuit of UCLA
and Arizona pretty much rendered that
— and other wide running plays — use
less. Let the Huskies over-pursue. And
then beat them the other way with a
reverse or two. Better yet, throw Ellery
Roberts behind that 1,500-pound mass
of offensive line and pound up the mid
dle. That kind of ball may not be
