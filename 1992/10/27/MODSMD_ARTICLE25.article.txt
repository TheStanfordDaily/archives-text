# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
Stanford athletics, while relying heavily
on a century-old tradition of excellence, have
always kept a watchful eye on the future of
the Cardinal legacy. Like their academic
counterparts, Stanford coaches and players
know that a good thing will only demon
strate its worth after it stands the test of
time.
In keeping with this foresight, The

Daily's Athletes of the Week — freshman
Eric Abrams and junior Laxmi Poruri —
represent the present and the future of the
Cardinal football and women's tennis teams.
Abrams, who has already solidified his
hold on the starting placekicking job in just
seven collegiate starts, provided the winning
margin of victory for Stanford last Saturday,
nailing field goals of 49 and 44 yards as the
football team downed Oregon State, 27-21.
By converting all three of his extra-point
opportunities in that contest, he was person
ally responsible for nine points, or one-third
of the Cardinal total.
A native of San Diego, Abrams graduated
from La Jolla Country Day School last June
having set an all-time high school record for
extra points while competing for an eight
man prep team. The 49-yarder last Saturday
was his longest collegiate field goal to date,
though Abrams connected from as far as 53
yards in high school, meaning that his best is
yet to come.

Poruri, a Claremont, Calif, native, took
her second consecutive Rolex North .vest
Women's Tennis Championships singles
title yesterday at the Stanford Tennis Sta
dium. In the final, she defeated senior
teammate Heather Willens in straight sets
6-4, 6-3.
"Popeye," as she is affectionately known,
was not alone in making a shambles of the
tournament field. In fact, Poruri and Wil

lens, the top-seeded doubles team, won their
half of the draw before falling to fellow Car
dinal stars Beth Berris and Kristine Kurth
in a thrilling three-set final.
Poruri. now the second-ranked college
player in the nation, hopes to improve upon
a disappointing semifinal loss last spring
when the NCAA Championships roll around
again next May.
