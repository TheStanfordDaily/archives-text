# Women take on Aztecs
## Face SDSU as long homestand continues 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's
soccer team plays the hump
game of a five-match homestand
today against San Diego State.
The 3 p.m. showdown features a
steadily improving Cardinal
squad (13-1-1) and an Aztec
team (5-6-3) that is coming off
two straight losses and has yet
to claim victory in an oppo
nents' lair.
But Stanford coach Berhane
Andeberhan is not about to
chalk up another 'W' yet.
"They are an energetic, fit,
emotional team," he said. "We
definitely can't take them light
ly"
San Diego State is led by a
pair of midfielders, freshman
Shawn Viloria and senior Lean
na Jay. Viloria has notched
seven goals on the season and
Jay has six.
The Cardinal is hoping to
shut down the Aztec scoring
threats while providing some
offensive punch of its own. In
the last four games, Stanford
has scored more than one goal
only once. But Andeberhan saw
signs of progress in the team's
recent 1-1 tie with Santa Clara.
Despite having only one goal

to show for its efforts, the Car
dinal created many excellent
scoring opportunities. The
Stanford attackers accom
plished 90 percent of what was
needed to score, only couldn't
quite put the ball in the net.
Andeberhan was particularly
encouraged by the play of for
ward Sarah Rafanelli, who leads
the team in scoring but has been
shut out the last five games.
"Rafanelli created great scor
ing opportunities," he said.
"She showed a lot of creativity
and composure but was
unlucky. She's one of the play
ers we need to come through for
us, so that was very satisfying to
see."
Along with Rafanelli's forays
through the Bronco defense,
Andeberhan pointed to the Car
dinal's more settled play as a
sign that Stanford is closer to
hitting playoff form.
"Now we just need to play
our game and play it for two
halves," he said. "We need to
concentrate on all parts of the
game â€” the technical, tactical,
physical and mental aspects."
After today's match, the Car
dinal faces Washington State
and top-10 contender Connecti-
cut this weekend to wrap up the
regular season.
If Stanford can escape the
rest of the season unscathed, it
has a virtual lock on one of two
NCAA tournament automatic
berths given to teams in the
Western Region.
Two squads from each of the
four regions receive automatic
bids, while the NCAA selection
committee chooses four at-large
teams to fill out the 12-squad
tourney.
