# Water polo takes second in conference tourney
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Despite missing its 10 p.m.
flight and arriving home at 1 a.m.
Monday, Stanford's second
ranked water polo team had a
good weekend.
The Cardinal placed second in
the Mountain Pacific Conference
Tournament this weekend, host
ed by Long Beach State.
Though Stanford lost to No. 1
California in overtime by one
point, head coach Dante Detta
manti feels that his team accom
plished two important tasks.
First, by emerging from the invi
tational with only one loss — and
that to the top team in the coun
try — the Cardinal solidified its
bid for a No. 2 seeding in the
NCAA championship tourna
ment. In addition, the close con
test against California gave Stan
ford players greater confidence in
themselves.
The Cardinal played with con
fidence and ability from the start
of the Mountain Pacific event. In
the opening round, Stanford dis
sected the University of Chami
nade's defense.
"We just blitzed them," Detta
manti said. Although Dettamanti
said the Cardinal tried to keep
the score down, Stanford won 20-
3. Every Cardinal player received
playing time, and 11 scored.
Sophomore Frank Schneider and
freshman Jeremy Laster led the
way with four goals each. Sopho
more Dan Hancock added three.
The second round provided
Stanford with an opportunity for
revenge against No. 7 UC-Santa
Barbara. In an earlier encounter
with the Gauchos, a Santa Bar

bara player threw a flagrant
punch at senior Chris Smith — a
hit which resulted in an injury
requiring stitches.
"We've had this kind of trou
ble against them for the last two
years," Dettamanti said.
Surprisingly, this confronta
tion, although plenty physical,
remained relatively foul-free. The
Cardinal triumphed handily, 17-6.
"We got revenge by destroying
them, not hitting them," Detta
manti said.
Ten Cardinal players scored,
paced again by Laster's three
goals. Sophomore Wolf Wigo,
Schneider, juniors Chris Wallin
and Antonio Busquets and senior
John Matarangas each contribut
ed two.
Against No. 3 USC, however,
Stanford found itself in a pitched
battle. Defense keyed the game.
After three quarters, the score
was tied, 5-5. In the final quarter,
the Cardinal struck first with a
six-on-five power play goal by
Busquets and a fast-break score
by Wallin, who led Stanford with
two goals. The Trojans cut the
Cardinal lead to 7-6 with three
minutes remaining, but Stanford
held on for the victory.
In the final, the Cardinal once
again found itself in a close con
test with California. This time,
however, Stanford's opponent
would emerge triumphant, win
ning 11-10 in overtime.
"I tell my players that a cham
pionship team does two things,"
Dettamanti said. "It takes advan
tage of an opponent's mistakes,
and can come from behind to win
close games. That's what Cal did."
Indeed, the Cardinal offense
performed well, according to Det

tamanti. Stanford's match-up
zone was the problem.
"Cal scored whenever we made
one little mistake," Dettamanti
said.
The Golden Bears jumped on
the Cardinal 3-1 in the first quar
ter, prompting a Dettamanti
timeout. Afterward, Stanford
made its surge, including a five
goal second quarter to enter half
time with a 7-6 advantage. The
Cardinal held its lead in the third

quarter, but found itself down 9-
8 in the fourth. However, Laster,
Stanford's tournament scoring
leader, struck pay-dirt on a shot
fired underneath the Cal goalie's
arms with one minute left to
force the overtime.
Unfortunately, a couple more
Cardinal defensive errors in over
time resulted in two Bear goals,
while Stanford managed only one.
"We lost our aggression after
our 8-6 lead in the third quarter,"

explained Dettamanti. "From
there, we played to protect — we
tried to sit on our lead, and we lost."
The close match only spurred
the Cardinal's desire for its Nov.
8 rematch, to be played in its
home pool.
"Our guys now realize we can
beat Cal," Dettamanti said.
But that's only likely to come
true if Stanford's defense can
hold for all four quarters of that
contest.

Indeed, the Cardinal offense
performed well, according to Det

tamanti. Stanford's match-up
zone was the problem.
"Cal scored whenever we made
one little mistake," Dettamanti
said.
The Golden Bears jumped on
the Cardinal 3-1 in the first quar
ter, prompting a Dettamanti
timeout. Afterward, Stanford
made its surge, including a five
goal second quarter to enter half
time with a 7-6 advantage. The
Cardinal held its lead in the third

quarter, but found itself down 9-
8 in the fourth. However, Laster,
Stanford's tournament scoring
leader, struck pay-dirt on a shot
fired underneath the Cal goalie's
arms with one minute left to
force the overtime.
Unfortunately, a couple more
Cardinal defensive errors in over
time resulted in two Bear goals,
while Stanford managed only one.
"We lost our aggression after
our 8-6 lead in the third quarter,"

explained Dettamanti. "From
there, we played to protect — we
tried to sit on our lead, and we lost."
The close match only spurred
the Cardinal's desire for its Nov.
8 rematch, to be played in its
home pool.
"Our guys now realize we can
beat Cal," Dettamanti said.
But that's only likely to come
true if Stanford's defense can
hold for all four quarters of that
contest.

Junior goaltender Larry Bercutt has warded off enough of Stanford's opponents' shots to take his
team to a No. 2 national ranking, a position that was reaffirmed by the Cardinal's second-place finish
in the Mountain Pacific Conference Tournament last weekend.
Despite missing its 10 p.m.
flight and arriving home at 1 a.m.
Monday, Stanford's second
ranked water polo team had a
good weekend.
The Cardinal placed second in
the Mountain Pacific Conference
Tournament this weekend, host
ed by Long Beach State.
Though Stanford lost to No. 1
California in overtime by one
point, head coach Dante Detta
manti feels that his team accom
plished two important tasks.
First, by emerging from the invi
tational with only one loss — and
that to the top team in the coun
try — the Cardinal solidified its
bid for a No. 2 seeding in the
NCAA championship tourna
ment. In addition, the close con
test against California gave Stan
ford players greater confidence in
themselves.
The Cardinal played with con
fidence and ability from the start
of the Mountain Pacific event. In
the opening round, Stanford dis
sected the University of Chami
nade's defense.
"We just blitzed them," Detta
manti said. Although Dettamanti
said the Cardinal tried to keep
the score down, Stanford won 20-
3. Every Cardinal player received
playing time, and 11 scored.
Sophomore Frank Schneider and
freshman Jeremy Laster led the
way with four goals each. Sopho
more Dan Hancock added three.
The second round provided
Stanford with an opportunity for
revenge against No. 7 UC-Santa
Barbara. In an earlier encounter
with the Gauchos, a Santa Bar

bara player threw a flagrant
punch at senior Chris Smith — a
hit which resulted in an injury
requiring stitches.
"We've had this kind of trou
ble against them for the last two
years," Dettamanti said.
Surprisingly, this confronta
tion, although plenty physical,
remained relatively foul-free. The
Cardinal triumphed handily, 17-6.
"We got revenge by destroying
them, not hitting them," Detta
manti said.
Ten Cardinal players scored,
paced again by Laster's three
goals. Sophomore Wolf Wigo,
Schneider, juniors Chris Wallin
and Antonio Busquets and senior
John Matarangas each contribut
ed two.
Against No. 3 USC, however,
Stanford found itself in a pitched
battle. Defense keyed the game.
After three quarters, the score
was tied, 5-5. In the final quarter,
the Cardinal struck first with a
six-on-five power play goal by
Busquets and a fast-break score
by Wallin, who led Stanford with
two goals. The Trojans cut the
Cardinal lead to 7-6 with three
minutes remaining, but Stanford
held on for the victory.
In the final, the Cardinal once
again found itself in a close con
test with California. This time,
however, Stanford's opponent
would emerge triumphant, win
ning 11-10 in overtime.
"I tell my players that a cham
pionship team does two things,"
Dettamanti said. "It takes advan
tage of an opponent's mistakes,
and can come from behind to win
close games. That's what Cal did."
