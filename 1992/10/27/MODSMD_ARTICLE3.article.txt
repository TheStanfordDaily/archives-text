# ASSU proposes $100,000 for sound system
## Senate to discuss bill that would ax Friday Flicks and up Sunday pass $1 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The proposed Memorial Auditorium
sound system got the green light from
the ASSU Budget and Finance Com
mittee last night, but its installation
may mean the cancellation of Friday
Flicks and a $1 surcharge on Sunday
Flicks passes.
The sound system bill created by the
committee, which passed unanimously,
will be voted on by the ASSU Senate at
its Nov. 3 meeting.
If passed, a Dolby Surround Sound
and stereo presentation system would
be installed in January.
Under the provisions of the bill,
$100,000 from ASSU reserves would be
used to pay for the system, and the
money would be recovered over a five
year period.
According to graduate senator
Sanford Dickert, the money would be

recovered through the cancellation of
Friday Flicks, which loses about
$15,000 per year, a $1 surcharge on
Sunday Flicks passes, and other pos
sible venues such as alumni dona
tions and future Sunday Flicks prof
its.

If passed, a Dolby
Surround Sound and
stereo presentation
system would be
installed in January.

He said he would also negotiate with
University Events and Services about a
possible surcharge on groups that rent
the equipment in Memorial Auditori
um to help recover costs.

Undergraduate senator Lawrence
Baeck called the bill" a show of support
for the students."
The ASSU plans to transfer owner
ship of the system to the University at
the time of purchase so that the ASSU
would not have to pay maintenance
costs.
The committee will decide this week
which sound system they will choose to
include in the bill. The two bidders,
Pro Media and Black Boxes Inc., both
have offered bids of about $100,000,
Dickert said.
"It's a basic system," Dickert said.
"There are no speakers under the seats
like in Memorial Church."
Pro Media would use Meyer sound
components and has recently lowered
its bid from $130,000 to about
$100,000, he said.
He added that Black Boxes, Inc.
would use Apogee sound components
and has slightly lowered their initial bid

ofsloo,ooo.
The two companies demonstrated
their proposed speaker systems in
Memorial Auditorium last Thursday
for those involved with the project.
"It certainly wasn't conclusive ei
ther way," said graduate senator Brian
Flachs, chair of the budget committee.
Dickert added, "The main outcome
was that reverberation time in the au
ditorium is important."
Flicks manager Suzy Anderson
said she asked the audiences' opinion
at Flicks on Sunday about the possi
bility of a surcharge. She said the au
dience was enthusiastic about a $1
surcharge in exchange for the system,
but unenthusiastic about any higher
amount.
She said of the 500 people who at
tended Flicks Sunday night, about 250
signed a petition supporting the pro
posed system, although it did not men
tion the possibility of a surcharge.
