## Med School awaits sexism probe results 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
An investigation into sexism charges against the
chair of the Medical School's radiology department
has ended after almost five months, according to
Dean David Korn.
"I think the investigation was painstakingly
thorough," Korn said, adding that he is studying
the findings and hopes to issue a public statement
by the end of next week.
Dr. Gary Glazer was singled out in a May 26 let
ter alleging that widespread gender discrimination,
harassment and intimidation occurred within his
department.
A two-man, two-woman committee held its first
meeting June 4 to investigate the charges and was
scheduled to submit its report to Korn by the end of
that month.
But Dr. Robert Cutler, the senior associate dean
for faculty affairs, said the report was completed
only recently. "The committee interviewed over 60
people, and that took a long time," he said.
A letter written to Cutler by Dr. Margaret
Billingham, director of the Program for Women in
Medicine and the Medical Sciences, sparked the in
vestigation of Glazer.
According to the San Jose Mercury News, after
interviewing eight women in the radiology depart
ment, Billingham wrote, "In every case, there was
some gender discrimination and in some cases ha
rassment, intimidation and abuse of power."
In her letter, Billingham reportedly blamed
many of the problems on Glazer without mention
ing him by name.
"It seems apparent that the chairman is totally
focused on his own interests and goals to put him-
self on the map at all costs, includ
ing overriding and ignoring all the
rules of fairness, decency, respon
sibility to his staff, honesty and
gender discrimination to meet his
own ends," she wrote.
In June, Glazer denied any
impropriety and welcomed the
probe "as an opportunity to have
this matter decided by fact rather
than in the media on the basis of
rumor, innuendo and unsupport
ed claims."
"The department and myself
are looking forward to a resolution
of this and being able to learn of
the information gleaned from the
hearings," he said in an interview
yesterday.
He added that he is pleased by
the investigation because the sub
ject is "so laden with emotions."
The letter also charged that
women in the department are
subjected to sexist comments,
have fewer research opportunities
than men and receive lower
bonuses.
The allegations involving Glaz
er are just the latest in a series of
sexism charges which have rocked
the Medical School.
