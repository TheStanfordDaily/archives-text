## On-campus school supply store to rival Bookstore

A University-operated discount store selling
school, office and home supplies in bulk will open on
campus in mid-December.
Stanford's Procurement Department is plan
ning to open a satellite of Central Stores at 330
Bonair Siding Rd., next to Maples Pavilion, accord

It will serve as a retail outlet, competing directly

continue to place their orders through an on-line
computer service and wait two to three days to re
ceive their orders.
The outlet will make it easier for faculty mem

President Donald Kennedy approved the idea
shortly before leaving office.
Because it is University-operated, she said the
outlet's goal will be to break even. Only 5 percent of
the profits will go toward expenses such as employ
ee salaries, and any additional revenue will benefit
the University.
