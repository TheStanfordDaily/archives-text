## On-campus school supply store to rival Bookstore 
### Lindsey Marcus 
A University-operated discount store selling
school, office and home supplies in bulk will open on
campus in mid-December.
Stanford's Procurement Department is plan
ning to open a satellite of Central Stores at 330
Bonair Siding Rd., next to Maples Pavilion, accord
ing to marketing manager Jane Williams.
It will serve as a retail outlet, competing directly
with the Stanford Bookstore by selling more than
12,000 items and essentially acting as "the Price
Club of the University," Williams said.
The materials will be comparable to those at the
Bookstore, she said, with the exception of books.
The items should cost less because the store will
purchase large quantities, she added.
The Procurement Department currently runs
the Electrical Engineering Stores in the Electronic
Research Labs building, but Williams said Central
Stores will carry more housewares.
The 30-year-old EE Stores sells electrical engi
neering materials as well as 8,000 items of student
and secretarial supplies, according to Procurement
Department employee Ann Leeds.
Until the new store opens, faculty members will
continue to place their orders through an on-line
computer service and wait two to three days to re
ceive their orders.
The outlet will make it easier for faculty mem
bers to get the supplies they need right away,
Williams said. The Central Stores outlet will also
allow people to actually see what they are buying,
instead of ordering it through a computer.
The idea of opening an outlet was raised last
year, according to Williams, and former University
President Donald Kennedy approved the idea
shortly before leaving office.
Because it is University-operated, she said the
outlet's goal will be to break even. Only 5 percent of
the profits will go toward expenses such as employ
ee salaries, and any additional revenue will benefit
the University.
"When the students purchase here, they're actu-
ally helping Stanford," Williams
said.
Stanford receives no profits
from the Bookstore, which oper
ates independently of the Univer
sity.
Representatives from the Book
store did not return phone calls
yesterday regarding their opinions
on the new store.
Williams said she is pleased
that the University is providing an
alternative to the Bookstore for
students. "We're not here to make

money," she said. "We've wanted
to serve the students for so long
and now we can."
The opening of Central Stores
also means jobs will be available
for students, she said, adding that
the number of employees will
start small and grow gradually
depending on Central Stores' pop
ularity.
Students will have to pay for
supplies in cash, according to
Williams. Faculty members can
use cash, checks, credit cards or a
University account.
She said students and faculty
members are invited to Central
Stores' product show Oct. 28 and
29 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
