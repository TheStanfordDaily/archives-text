# Debates inform campus
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Combining forces to inform
students about where their candi
dates stand on the issues, the
Stanford Democrats and the Col
lege Republicans continued their
series of mock debates last night
in the Mirlo lounge.
Each debate has been held in a
different dormitory to reach as
many students as possible. The two
campus parties are scheduled meet
in Roble lounge tonight at 7 p.m.
Sophomores Cyd Zeigler and
Adam Ross represented the Re
publicans, and senior Dale Ed
mondson and sophomore Robin
Wall represented the Democrats.
Moderated by sophomore
Nancy Luxon, also a member of
the Stanford Democrats, the for
mat consisted of four previously
rehearsed questions — two con
tributed by the Democrats and
two by the Republicans — with

one minute rebuttals for each side.
Last night's debate was the
fifth of 10 proposed meetings be
fore next Tuesday's election.
After the debate, the panelists
fielded questions from the 23- per
son audience.
The debate brought up very lit
tle information that has not al
ready been relayed in the national
news, but the groups' objective
was to raise awareness.
However, when one member of
the audience said, under existing
Pennsylvania law, a recently mar
ried lesbian friend of his cannot
visit her wife in a hospital because
she is not considered a spouse,
Ross made a personal appeal to the
audience in behalf of his party.
"I was very disturbed by the
negative tone of the homophobic
gay and lesbian bashing at the Re
publican convention,"he said, at
tributing the comments to the

"Pat Buchanans" and the "Pat
Robertsons."
Ross said that the majority of
Republicans are moderate like
he and Zeigler, but headlines
lead the public to believe other
wise.
"It's interesting, I think, 160
people speak and the people who
the media focus on, of course, are
Pat Robertson and Pat
Buchanan," he said.
Ross added that some gay and
lesbian voters, many of whom
are business owners who don't
want to be taxed, have remained

undecided because of the gay
bashing at the convention.
"There is a place for gays and
lesbians in the Republican
Party," he said, predicting that
within the next decade or so,
this stance will "completely
change."
Unlike the vice-presidential
debate, the student panelists
remained respectful and stuck to
the issues. The panelists fielded
questions earnestly and profi
ciently, except for when one
audience member caught all four
of them off-guard by asking
where each candidate stood on
Native American issues and
reservations.
"You got me," admitted Zei
gler. "I honestly don't know."
