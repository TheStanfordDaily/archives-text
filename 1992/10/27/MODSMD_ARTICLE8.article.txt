Combining forces to inform
students about where their candi
dates stand on the issues, the
Stanford Democrats and the Col
lege Republicans continued their
series of mock debates last night
in the Mirlo lounge.
Each debate has been held in a
different dormitory to reach as
many students as possible. The two
campus parties are scheduled meet
in Roble lounge tonight at 7 p.m.
Sophomores Cyd Zeigler and
Adam Ross represented the Re
publicans, and senior Dale Ed
mondson and sophomore Robin
Wall represented the Democrats.
Moderated by sophomore
Nancy Luxon, also a member of
the Stanford Democrats, the for
mat consisted of four previously
rehearsed questions — two con
tributed by the Democrats and
two by the Republicans — with

one minute rebuttals for each side.
Last night's debate was the
fifth of 10 proposed meetings be
fore next Tuesday's election.
After the debate, the panelists
fielded questions from the 23- per
son audience.
The debate brought up very lit

news, but the groups' objective
was to raise awareness.
However, when one member of
the audience said, under existing
Pennsylvania law, a recently mar
ried lesbian friend of his cannot
visit her wife in a hospital because
she is not considered a spouse,
Ross made a personal appeal to the
audience in behalf of his party.
"I was very disturbed by the
negative tone of the homophobic
gay and lesbian bashing at the Re
publican convention,"he said, at
tributing the comments to the
