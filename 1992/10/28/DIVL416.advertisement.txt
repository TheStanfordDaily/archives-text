Student conduct is guided by the Fundamental
Standard, which states the expectation that students will
act in ways that demonstrate respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights of others. Implicit in the
Standard is the understanding that students are responsi
ble for making their own decisions and accepting the
consequences of those decisions.
In order to make informed decisions about alcohol
use, students and others should be aware of the health
and safety risks associated with its use, as well as the
state and local laws about possessing, serving and con
suming alcohol. It is widely recognized that the misuse
and abuse of drugs ("controlled substances") and the
abuse of alcohol are major contributors to serious health
problems as well as to social and civic concerns. The
health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs and the
abuse of alcohol include various deleterious physical and
mental consequences including addiction, severe disabili
ty, and death. Information concerning the known effects
of alcohol and specific drugs is available from the Alcohol
and Drug Information Center at the Cowell Student
Health Center.
The goal of this policy is to reduce drug and alcohol
abuse and the human and material costs associated with
it. The University, as an educational institution, approach
es student conduct issues from a perspective that places
greater emphasis on individual responsibility and devel
opment than on regulatory measures. Consequently, edu
cation about and prevention of alcohol-related problems
will continue to be our primary emphasis. Moreover, it is
the intention of the University that students as individuals
and as members of groups will conduct themselves in
accordance with this and all other University policies gov
erning student conduct.
■ Controlled substances are those defined in 21 U.S.C.
812 and include, but are not limited to, such substances
as marijuana, heroin, cocaine and amphetamines.
Policy
It is the policy of Stanford University to maintain a
drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufac
ture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of
controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use, or
distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Stanford cam
pus, in the workplace, or as part of any of the University's
activities. The workplace and campus are presumed to
include all Stanford premises where the activities of the
University are conducted. Violation of this policy may
result in disciplinary sanctions up to and including termi
nation of employment or expulsion of students.
Violations may also be referred to the appropriate author
ities for prosecution. This policy will be reviewed at least
biennially.
Some Applications
■ No University funds or funds collected by the University
may be used in a way which violates the policy.
While there are a few frosh at Stanford who are 21 or
older, and residence staff members often are in the 21 or
older age range, the fact remains that the great majority
of residences of an all-frosh dormitory are minors.
Consequently, it is hard to imagine how house dues for
all-frosh residences could be used to buy alcohol without
violating both state law and University policy.
■ Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless of how
money is collected, all provisions of the policy apply to all
students, faculty, and staff.
■ Event planners will be held individually and collectively
responsible for planning and carrying out events in com
pliance with the policy. One or more house/organization
officers must assume responsibility for the events com
pliance with the alcohol policy. These officers' names
must be made available to the police and to the
University upon request.
Consequence of Violation
Educational and rehabilitative measures will be the
preferred response to infractions unaccompanied by
more egregious conduct. However, behavior could run
the gamut from a simple Minor in Possession (of alcohol)
with no prior disciplinary history to drunken behavior
resulting in loss of life. Penalties will be calibrated accord
ing to the severity of the misconduct. Behavior associated
with drug or alcohol use and abuse may constitute one
or more of the following.
1. Violation of the University residence agreement or
Terms and Conditions of Fraternity Occupancy, subjecting
the student to loss of University housing.
2. Violation of student organization conditions of recogni
tion, subjecting the student to expulsion from the organi
zation and/or the organization's loss of University recogni
tion and associated privileges.
3. Violation of the Fundamental Standard, subjecting the
student to University discipline which includes as a possi
ble outcome suspension or expulsion from Stanford.
Inebriation is not an excuse for misconduct but rath
er is an aggravating circumstance. A student's careless or
willful reduction, through the use of alcohol or other
intoxicants, of his or her own ability to think clearly, exer
cise good judgment and respond to rational intervention
is considered grounds for more stringent penalties than
might be levied otherwise.
Residences or student organizations found to have
violated the policy are subject, as groups, to University
sanctions such as suspension of social privileges and loss
of University recognition, meeting space, and housing, if
applicable.
Civil Liability
While the law regarding civil liability is complex, it is
important to know that under some circumstances party
hosts, sponsors, bartenders, or others may be held legally
liable for the consequences of serving alcohol to under
aged drinkers or to obviously intoxicated persons.
