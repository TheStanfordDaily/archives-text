Criminal Liability
Stanford University is not a sanctuary from the
enforcement of state and local laws. Students and others
on campus who violate the law may be and have been
arrested and prosecuted. Primary responsibility for law
enforcement, including that related to alcohol, rests with
law enforcement agencies, primarily the Stanford Police
Department. Uniformed officers who patrol the campus
and respond to calls are deputized by the sheriff of Santa
Clara County and are fully empowered and authorized to
stop vehicles, make arrests, and enforce all laws. Laws are
subject to change; consequently, the following information
is illustrative but must not be relied upon as a complete
and current citing of relevant laws. More information is
available at the Stanford Department of Public Safety, 71J
Serra Street.

THE ROLE OF RESIDENCE STAFF
PERTAINING TO STANFORD
UNIVERSITY'S POLICY ON
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
AND ALCOHOL
The role of Resident Assistants and Resident
Fellows ("residence staff") at Stanford is principally
educational, advisory, and developmental. It is crucial
that students trust their residence staff members and
feel comfortable confiding in them, turning to them
freely for assistance whenever they need it. As role
models and as employees and agents of the
University, residence staff are expected to comply with
the Controlled Substances and Alcohol Policy them
selves. For example, they must not provide alcohol to
minors, nor may they allow program funds under their
control to be used in a way which violates the policy.
With regard to the policy, residence staff members are
expected to work with students in the following ways.
As educators, residence staff should help ensure that
students are made aware of University policy, pertinent
California law, and the health risks associated with the use
and abuse of alcohol and other drugs.
As advisors, residence staff should urge sensible party
planning and management and help students in their
efforts to abide by the event planning guidelines.
As community builders, RAs and RFs should work
closely with residents to create and maintain a safe and
healthful residential environment.
Resident Assistants and Resident Fellows are not
expected to police or monitor the conduct of students, or
to receive or act upon reports of violations. They are
expected to exercise the same judgment concerning this
policy as they do with other University policies. For exam
ple, they must continue to intervene and exercise responsi
ble guidance any time they are aware of any situation that
is threatening to the health or safety of individuals or
groups.
THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
AND ALCOHOL POLICY
GUIDELINES FOR
EVENT PLANNERS
The following guidelines are meant to assist stud
ents in planning and managing events in ways that
are in compliance with the Controlled Substances and
Alcohol Policy. The guidelines apply to all students
planning events on the Stanford campus or any off
campus University program or activity. The list below,
drawn up for events at which alcohol will be served, is
not exhaustive. Individuals and groups are responsible
for developing strategies for planning and carrying
out events that are safe and in compliance with
University policy.
■ If you choose to serve alcohol at all, make it an adjunct
to the event not the center of it.
■ Ensure that norvalcoholic drinks (EANABS) are at least as
accessible and attractive as, and more plentiful than, alco-
