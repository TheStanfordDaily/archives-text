holic drinks. The amount of alcohol provided should be
reasonable and in proportion to the number of event par
ticipants who are legally able to drink.
■ Create an atmosphere in which people are encouraged
to interact, and are helped to feel comfortable — have
something for people to do besides just stand around and
drink.
■ Encourage moderation by using moderate-sized glasses
and cups.
■ Have the alcohol in a secure part of the room where
access can be readily controlled. Ensure that it is attended
at all times, and have it served rather than leaving it open
to self-service. Make sure that servers have been trained in
responsible alcohol serving.
■ Stop serving alcohol at least an hour before the end of
the event and make sure you have plenty of other bever
ages and snacks left to serve at this time.
■ Refuse to serve someone who has had too much to
drink.
■ Do not let an intoxicated person drive!
■ If the event is advertised, do not mention alcohol in the
publicity.
■ If the event is open to people who are not known to the
residence or the organization, take extra precautions to
guard against problems such as theft, assault, drunken
driving, individuals wandering off in need of assistance,
and possible injuries. While any of these concerns can
arise among people who know each other, experience
shows that they are more common when gatherings re
large and include strangers.
■ High school students should be afforded vigorous pro
tection from access to alcohol, if they are allowed to
attend the event at all. It is generally wiser to restrict atten
dance to college-aged people or older.
■ Designate plenty of sober monitors to help manage the
party. Station them at the front door and in the area
where alcohol is being served, and have some circulate
inside and outside the house to check other possible
means of entry, attend to house security, respond to pro
blems, and so forth.
■ Emphasize to the group sponsoring the event (e.g., a
residence, a fraternal group, a student voluntary organiza
tion), that it is each member's responsibility to ensure that
the event is managed well and to exercise care for the
well-being of all participants.
■ Exercise care and authority in hiring the band. Do not
permit members to bring minors ("friends of the band") to
the event.
■ Control the noise of the event. The farther away it can
be heard, the more likely you'll draw complaints and
unwanted guests.
