IF YOU THOUGHT COLLEGE WAS
EXPENSIVE, TRY PUTTING YOURSELF
THROUGH RETIREMENT.
Think about supporting yourself for
twenty-five, thirty years or longer
in retirement. It might be the greatest
financial test you'll ever face. Fortunately,
you have one valuable asset in your
favor. Time.
Time to take advantage of tax-deferral.
Time for your money to grow.
But starting early is key. Consider this:
ifyou begin saving just $100 a month at
age thirty, you can accumulate $192,539*
by the time you reach age sixty-five.
Wait ten years and you 'd need to set aside
$227 a month to reach the same goal.
At TIAA-CREF we not only under
stand the value of starting early, we
can help make it possible—with flexible
retirement and tax-deferred annuity
plans, a diverse portfolio of investment
choices, and a record of personal
service that spans 75 years.
Over a million people in education
and research are already enrolled in
America's largest retirement system.
Find out how easy it is to join them. Call
today and learn how simple it is to put
yourself through retirement when you
have time and TIAA-CREF on your side.
Start pLanrtirtfl your future. Call our Enrollment Hotline I 800 842-2888.

IF YOU THOUGHT COLLEGE WAS
EXPENSIVE, TRY PUTTING YOURSELF
THROUGH RETIREMENT.
Think about supporting yourself for
twenty-five, thirty years or longer
in retirement. It might be the greatest
financial test you'll ever face. Fortunately,
you have one valuable asset in your
favor. Time.
Time to take advantage of tax-deferral.
Time for your money to grow.
But starting early is key. Consider this:
ifyou begin saving just $100 a month at
age thirty, you can accumulate $192,539*
by the time you reach age sixty-five.
Wait ten years and you 'd need to set aside
$227 a month to reach the same goal.
At TIAA-CREF we not only under
stand the value of starting early, we
can help make it possible—with flexible
retirement and tax-deferred annuity
plans, a diverse portfolio of investment
choices, and a record of personal
service that spans 75 years.
Over a million people in education
and research are already enrolled in
America's largest retirement system.
Find out how easy it is to join them. Call
today and learn how simple it is to put
yourself through retirement when you
have time and TIAA-CREF on your side.
