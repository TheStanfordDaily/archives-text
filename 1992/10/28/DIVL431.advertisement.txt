"MY ARMY ROTC SCHOLARSHIP
IS FAYING OFF TWICE"
Greatpeople, exhilarating experiences, and major financial
benefits! I joined the Army ROTC program to supplement my finan
cial needs, but gained a lot more. I have made great friends, had
incredible experiences, and gained insight into many opportunities
waiting for me after graduation. I will have both a rewarding job and
proven leadership and managerial skills. My skills will also make me
more marketable in the business world.
