# Senate grants funding
## 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate quickly ap
proved both the program board
budget and the community ser
vice board budget at a special
meeting last night, earmarking
funds for 32 student groups.
The only amendment to either
budget was a $625 reduction in
travel expenses appropriated to
the International and Cross Cul
tural Medical Association. ASSU
by-laws prohibit the funding of
travel expenses for members of
student groups.
"We have to call the appropria
tions process for this year an un
paralleled success," Senate Chair
Ron Brown said. "The willingness
of the Program Board and the Ap
propriations committee to inter
view all the groups and take the
time made all the difference."
Some of the biggest recipients
of Program Board funds were the
Ayn Rand Society, the Stanford
Hybrid Automobile Research Pro
ject (SHARP) and Students for
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Kappa
Alpha Mud Volleyball and Delta
Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. re
ceived the largest amounts of
Community Service Board funds.
Last night's meeting was un
like past years when Program
Board meetings ran late into the
night as debate raged over small
amounts of money. One and a half
years ago, a program meeting ran
seven hours, until 2 a.m.
"I feel wonderful," said gradu
ate senator Ralph Ermoian, chair
of the Appropriations committee.
"To only have one amendment and
to be over by 9 p.m. is amazing."
A proposed amendment to cut
funding to SHARP sparked the
most debate at the meeting, but
the amendment was rejected by
the Senate.
Graduate senator Robert Lo
denkamper, who proposed the
amendment, said SHARP'S large
budget of about $250,000 and its
small student involvement did not
merit the $1,000 it was slated to
receive.
"This thing is not really a pro
gram," Lodenkamper said. "Al
though it is a worthwhile engineer-
ing project."
But undergraduate senator
Jaasi Munanka felt the group
deserved the funds.
"The great thing about SHARP
is their great initiative and drive â€”
that they're able to secure funding
by their own means," Munanka
said. "They've shown so much ini
tiative that if they feel this is going
to help them, we should [give them
the money]."
The amendment failed to gain

the two-thirds vote necessary to
pass.
Also at last night's meeting,
members of the Provost's Com
mittee on Budget Implementation
addressed the Senate on the
effects of the recent budget cuts on
students.
Graduate student Chris Golde
and junior Brenda Ky, the two
students on the committee, asked
the senators to find out from stu
dents what the effects of the cuts
have been.
"We're trying to figure out
which budget cuts were poorly
administered or badly implement
ed," Ky said.
