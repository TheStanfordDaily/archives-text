The ASSU Senate quickly ap
proved both the program board
budget and the community ser
vice board budget at a special
meeting last night, earmarking
funds for 32 student groups.

funding to SHARP sparked the
most debate at the meeting, but
the amendment was rejected by
the Senate.
Graduate senator Robert Lo
denkamper, who proposed the
amendment, said SHARP'S large
budget of about $250,000 and its
small student involvement did not
merit the $1,000 it was slated to
receive.
"This thing is not really a pro
gram," Lodenkamper said. "Al
