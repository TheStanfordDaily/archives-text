# Economic hope for Eastern Europe

Senior Hoover Fellow Ed Lazear, an eco
nomic adviser to the Romanian and Russian
governments, discussed first-hand experi
ences of the economic challenges facing
Eastern Europe with a packed room of stu
dents in the Graduate School of Business
last night.
In his talk titled "The Emerging Economies
of Eastern Europe," Lazear outlined neces
sary changes the former communist countries
must adopt in order to make the transition to
a market economy. He also expressed confi
dence that they would be successful in the
long run.
"I think it's going to work," he said. "Look
at the post-war success of Germany and
Japan."

His faith in their ability to succeed arose
from his respect for the architects of the
reforms. "It really surprised me how sophisti
cated they were. The top minds of the country
are in government," he said.
According to Lazear, the first of the neces
sary steps is allowing prices to be determined
by the forces of supply and demand. In a com
mand economy, such as the former Soviet
Union, the government artificially sets prices
too low, causing mass waste and distortion in
the economy.
Lazear cited the example of people waiting
in line to buy bread. Once they get to the front,
prices were so low that they would buy enough
bread not only to feed their family, but their
animals as well.
But the way prices have been raised has
also caused severe problems, he said. When

the former Soviet Union allowed butter prices
to rise while keeping milk prices low, a short
age of milk resulted because dairy farmers
halted milk production in order to produce
higher-priced butter.
Lazear did not feel that foreign economic
assistance would alleviate the problems these
countries will face in the future. "While aid
sounds like a good thing, you can't find any
evidence that it helps," he said. "In fact, it can
hurt."
He described how some forms of aid can
actually prove detrimental. If you give away
food, no one will be willing to pay market
prices to the domestic producers, he said.
Yesterday's talk was part of a series provid
ing background information for an upcoming
conference, "Europe 1992: Changes, Chances,
Challenges," at the Business School.
