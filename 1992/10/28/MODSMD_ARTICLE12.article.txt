Disaster victims fight back
WASHINGTON (AP) — Victims of hurricanes in Florida and
Hawaii and riots in California yesterday accused the government's
emergency relief agency of failing to deliver "full and fair" assis
tance when disaster struck.
In a petition to the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
legal aid lawyers in the three states said they were acting "to dispel
any illusions the public might have about FEMA's ability to deliver
basic disaster relief."
A spokesman said a lawsuit might be filed if the groups are not
satisfied with FEMA's response to the accusation that it has failed
to provide "full, fair and equitable disaster relief."
But FEMA representatives said the lawyers have delivered a fog
of "half truths," outright inaccuracies and unfair criticism that dis
regards the thousands of disaster victims who have received mil
lions of dollars in needed assistance.
