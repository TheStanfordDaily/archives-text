Economy blocks Bush comeback
WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans' economic
worries and desire for change are proving stiff
obstacles to a comeback for President Bush, who is
making late progress in some traditional Republi
can states, but in others has stalled or even slipped.
The numbers underscore his troubles in the
campaign's final days. Several pollsters inter
viewed yesterday said Bush's standing is remark
ably stagnant in national surveys because so
many voters are convinced he is not the best
choice with regard to the economy.
"The feeling was that he wasn't paying as much
attention as they wanted him to pay to the central
thing — which is jobs and the economy," said
Andrew Kohut, director of surveys for Times Mir
ror Center for The People & The Press.
Two tracking polls released yesterday offered con
flicting views of the national dynamics. CNN-USA
Today's tracking had Clinton's lead holding at 11
points; ABC News had the gap narrowing to 7 points.

Clinton led Bush 41-34 in the ABC poll and 42-
31 in CNN's poll. Both polls have a statistical mar
gin of error of plus or minus 3 points.
Blacks support Clinton
WASHINGTON (AP) — Blacks are prepared to
support Bill Clinton by overwhelming margins on
Election Day, a poll by a black advocacy group
showed yesterday.
Clinton got the support of 75 percent of blacks
surveyed, compared to 7 percent for Ross Perot and
6 percent for President Bush.
Despite Clinton's run-ins with the Rev. Jesse
Jackson earlier this year over the execution of an
Arkansas inmate, just 30 percent of blacks polled
said the Arkansas governor has been "cooler and
less friendly" to black leaders than recent Demo
cratic nominees.
Clinton allowed the execution of a brain-dam
aged black murderer, Rickey Ray Rector, despite
pleas for leniency by Jackson.
