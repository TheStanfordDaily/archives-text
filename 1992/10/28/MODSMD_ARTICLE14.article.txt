# Arab-Israeli peace talks threatened
## Israel amasses tanks on Lebanese border, responding to Islamic guerillas 
### 
TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — Israel
amassed tanks along its border
with Lebanon yesterday and
deployed warplanes and artillery
against guerrilla positions to
avenge attacks by Muslim guerril
las that killed six Israelis.
The fighting, which has left at
least 13 people dead and 35
wounded in Israel and Lebanon
this week, threatened to under
mine the seventh round of Arab-
Israeli peace talks currently
under way in Washington.
Israel sent nine Merkava tanks
into its buffer zone in south
Lebanon yesterday night, accord
ing to security sources, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
An Israeli army spokeswoman
said "a lot" of tanks are being
amassed along Israel's northern
border, but refused to give num
bers. She said reinforcements
were being deployed in the zone
but did not specify if that meant
troops, tanks or both.
Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim
fundamentalist group that wants
to derail the talks, claimed
responsibility for a bombing Sun
day in the Israeli buffer zone that
touched off the latest round of
violence. The blast killed five
Israeli soldiers and wounded five
others.
In addition, a guerrilla rocket
killed a 14-year-old in northern
Israel before dawn yesterday.
"We must be ready and
deployed to respond in the neces
sary manner if Hezbollah contin
ues in its attempts to attack,"
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin said after the rocket attack.
Later, Rabin chastised an
Israeli newspaper for quoting him
as ordering the army "to wipe out
Hezbollah."
"I have never said that we can
eliminate totally a terrorist orga
nization," he said in remarks to
the Foreign Press Association.
Coupled with a wave of Pales
tinian attacks on Jews in the

Israeli-occupied territories, the
fighting in Lebanon is arousing
Israeli public opinion and ham
pering Rabin's efforts to prepare
his people to make concessions
in return for peace with the
Arabs.
Right-wing politicians in Israel
who lost during the June elec
tions have been portraying Rabin
as soft on the Arabs, and some
have demanded the government
withdraw from the peace talks
because of escalating violence.
Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
which said it was mobilizing its
3,500 hard-core fighters, clam
ored yesterday for Lebanon to
withdraw from the talks.
The Beirut government, which
is supported by Syria, ignored the
demand but said it "would lodge a
complaint with the United
Nations Security Council over the
"ferocious Israeli aggressions."
Security sources said the
Israeli tanks that crossed into
the buffer zone took up positions
around the village of Markaba. It
faces Majdal Silm, which Israel
radio said was where Shiite
guerrillas fired the latest
Katyusha rocket volleys on
northern Israel.
The sources said they feared
the tank reinforcements could
herald an Israeli ground thrust
outside the security zone.
Israeli troops already patrol
the buffer zone, which Israel set
up in 1985 to guard against guer
rilla attacks on northern towns.
Timur Goksel, a spokesman for
the U.N. monitoring force in
southern Lebanon, said U.N.
observers had not detected any
unusual military moves.
Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai,
commander of Israel's northern
forces, said at a news conference
that Israeli tanks had not moved
north of the security zone. He
refused to discuss whether more
tanks were sent into the zone.
Yesterday the warplanes

staged two separate raids in east
ern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley,
apparently in response to the
rocket attack that killed the teen
age Ukrainian immigrant and
wounded five people in the
Israeli border town of Kiryat
Shmoneh.
Police said Israeli gunners
intermittently shelled villages in
southern Lebanon and the west
ern Bekaa Valley with 155 mm
howitzers, causing hundreds of
people to flee.
Cars crammed with refugees
and beds and mattresses tied on

top streamed along roads leading
to the coastal cities of Tyre and
Sidon, where buildings are
equipped with air raid shelters.
Smoke billowed from the hills
as the thunder of shell blasts
echoed across the region overlook
ing the market town of
Nabatiyeh, where people emerged
to stockpile food and drinking
water.
"It looks like we're going to be
holed up indoors for quite a long
time. So it's prudent to have food
stocks around," said Mariam Sab
bagh.

time. So it's prudent to have food

TYRE, Lebanon (AP) — Israel
amassed tanks along its border
with Lebanon yesterday and
deployed warplanes and artillery
against guerrilla positions to
avenge attacks by Muslim guerril
las that killed six Israelis.
The fighting, which has left at
least 13 people dead and 35
wounded in Israel and Lebanon
this week, threatened to under
mine the seventh round of Arab-
Israeli peace talks currently
under way in Washington.
Israel sent nine Merkava tanks
into its buffer zone in south
Lebanon yesterday night, accord
ing to security sources, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
An Israeli army spokeswoman
said "a lot" of tanks are being
amassed along Israel's northern
border, but refused to give num
bers. She said reinforcements
were being deployed in the zone
but did not specify if that meant
troops, tanks or both.
Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim
fundamentalist group that wants
to derail the talks, claimed
responsibility for a bombing Sun
day in the Israeli buffer zone that
touched off the latest round of
violence. The blast killed five
Israeli soldiers and wounded five
others.
In addition, a guerrilla rocket
killed a 14-year-old in northern
Israel before dawn yesterday.
"We must be ready and
deployed to respond in the neces
sary manner if Hezbollah contin
ues in its attempts to attack,"
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin said after the rocket attack.
Later, Rabin chastised an
Israeli newspaper for quoting him
as ordering the army "to wipe out
Hezbollah."
"I have never said that we can
eliminate totally a terrorist orga
nization," he said in remarks to
the Foreign Press Association.
Coupled with a wave of Pales
tinian attacks on Jews in the

Israeli-occupied territories, the
fighting in Lebanon is arousing
Israeli public opinion and ham
pering Rabin's efforts to prepare
his people to make concessions
in return for peace with the
Arabs.
Right-wing politicians in Israel
who lost during the June elec
tions have been portraying Rabin
as soft on the Arabs, and some
have demanded the government
withdraw from the peace talks
because of escalating violence.
Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
which said it was mobilizing its
3,500 hard-core fighters, clam
ored yesterday for Lebanon to
withdraw from the talks.
The Beirut government, which
is supported by Syria, ignored the
demand but said it "would lodge a
complaint with the United
Nations Security Council over the
"ferocious Israeli aggressions."
Security sources said the
Israeli tanks that crossed into
the buffer zone took up positions
around the village of Markaba. It
faces Majdal Silm, which Israel
radio said was where Shiite
guerrillas fired the latest
Katyusha rocket volleys on
northern Israel.
The sources said they feared
the tank reinforcements could
herald an Israeli ground thrust
outside the security zone.
Israeli troops already patrol
the buffer zone, which Israel set
up in 1985 to guard against guer
rilla attacks on northern towns.
Timur Goksel, a spokesman for
the U.N. monitoring force in
southern Lebanon, said U.N.
observers had not detected any
unusual military moves.
Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai,
commander of Israel's northern
forces, said at a news conference
that Israeli tanks had not moved
north of the security zone. He
refused to discuss whether more
tanks were sent into the zone.
Yesterday the warplanes

staged two separate raids in east
ern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley,
apparently in response to the
rocket attack that killed the teen
age Ukrainian immigrant and
wounded five people in the
Israeli border town of Kiryat
Shmoneh.
Police said Israeli gunners
intermittently shelled villages in
southern Lebanon and the west
ern Bekaa Valley with 155 mm
howitzers, causing hundreds of
people to flee.
Cars crammed with refugees
and beds and mattresses tied on

top streamed along roads leading
to the coastal cities of Tyre and
Sidon, where buildings are
equipped with air raid shelters.
Smoke billowed from the hills
as the thunder of shell blasts
echoed across the region overlook
ing the market town of
Nabatiyeh, where people emerged
to stockpile food and drinking
water.
"It looks like we're going to be
holed up indoors for quite a long
time. So it's prudent to have food
stocks around," said Mariam Sab
bagh.
