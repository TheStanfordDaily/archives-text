# Yeltsin will ban hard-liners
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — President
Boris Yeltsin said yesterday he
would outlaw a new hard-line
political group because it under
mines Russian society and poses a
"great danger" to the country.
The ban would be the first by
Yeltsin since he dissolved the
Communist Party in 1991.
Yeltsin is under increasing
pressure from hard-liners in the
Russian legislature and elsewhere
who oppose his free-market
reforms and believe he has
wrecked the nation.
But Yeltsin reassured the
country that "things will be look
ing up in 1993. The people have
endured the most difficult — the
10 months of reforms. . . . The
worst is behind us."
Yeltsin said in a speech to the
Russian Foreign Ministry that he

was directing an aide to prepare a
presidential decree dissolving the
National Salvation Front.
He said the Front is "calling
for the overthrow of legal author
ities, it is destabilizing the society
(and) setting people against each
other."
Alexander Prokhanov, a Front
leader, called Yeltsin's action
"political gangsterism, lunacy
and idiocy."
Although they represent a
vocal minority, the hard-liners
have set the stage for a political
showdown Dec. 1, when the
Congress of People's Deputies —
the parliament dominated by pro-
Communist legislators — will
convene.
More than 3,000 members of
pro-Communist and ultra-nation
alist factions founded the Front in

a heavily guarded Moscow audito
rium Saturday. The group vowed
to oust Yeltsin and save the
nation from ruin.
Yeltsin said the Front should
be dissolved as "an unregistered
organization, the activities of
which contradict the Constitution
and the country's laws."
After the failed Communist
coup in August 1991 that led to
the breakup of the Soviet Union,
Yeltsin banned the Communist
Party and seized its property — a
move the hard-liners challenge as
unconstitutional.
Prokhanov said the Front was
seeking to achieve its goals by
constitutional means. "lYeltsin]
has dissolved the U.S.S.R., is dis
solving Russia, and it's not a sur
prise that he has decided to dis
solve our Front."
