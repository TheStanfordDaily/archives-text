Huening's leadership,
commitment to reform
should impress voters

THE 1992 ELECTION YEAR
has been named "The Year of
the Woman" because of the
record-breaking number of female
candidates contending for national
political office. The congressional
race in the 14th district, which
stretches from the Pacific Coast to
Silicon Valley and includes Stan
ford, is no exception to the trend.
While this political groundswell
has greatly invigorated constituen
cies around the nation, voters need
to transcend the issue of gender
and ask themselves which candi
date would better distinguish him
self or herself in the turbulent
world of national politics.
Tom Huening has proven he is
one who will not shy from the task
of restoring fiscal responsibility in
this country. He has already re
ceived national attention for his
innovative ideas about Congression
al reform and deserves the opportu
nity to put his ideas to work.
Huening and his democratic
opponent, Anna Eshoo, hold many
similar beliefs. Both are pro-choice
and both favor heavy cuts in
defense spending, in addition to
supporting a line-item presidential
veto. They call themselves strong
environmental advocates and both
support increasing auto fuel effi
ciency. In fact, during their joint
tenure on the San Mateo Country
Board of Supervisors, they have
voted identically on the vast
majority of issues.
Where they strongly differ is in
the agenda that each would fight
for once in office. Huening's over
riding goal is reform. His innova
tive "Omaha Summit" would gath
er newly elected, non-incumbent
members of Congress for intensive
consultations in late November
before assuming office in Washing
ton. The hope is to achieve biparti-

San consensus — free from the
pressures of Washington — on
how to effect real change in this
country.
While many candidates, Eshoo
included, have endorsed the idea of
reform — perhaps in an attempt to
ride the anti-incumbency tide —
Huening has gone one step further
and put forward concrete propos
als. He firmly believes that before
we can solve many of the pressing
social issues in this country, we
must be on firm financial footing.
To this end Huening has pro
posed an ambitious plan to reduce
the budget deficit by 20 percent for
each of the next five years. His
first step towards this goal would
be a one-third reduction of
Congress' $3 billion operating
budget. Though perhaps overly
ambitious, it is aimed in the right
direction. Before expecting the
American public to partake in
painful belt-tightening, Congress
must demonstrate its own fiscal
restraint.
Unlike Eshoo, who has shown
strong ideological adherence to the
democratic party line, Huening
has proven flexible and non-ideo
logical. He is far from the rising
"religious right" that so appalled
many in this country during the
Republican National Convention.
His proposed summit is an
attempt to bring both parties clos
er together towards achieving a
common goal.
Admittedly, Huening's "700 lb.
congressional gorillas" is more
than a bit gimmicky, his message is
not. Next year's congressional
"freshman class," many of them
women, will be the most reform
minded, charged group that this
country has seen since the force
that swept through Congress in the
wake of Watergate. Huening has
strongly positioned himself to fun
nel the energies of this group into
effective and much-needed reform.
Rather than electing another
party-loyal sheep, Stanford voters
have the occasion to send a proven,
dynamic leader who is not afraid to
stray from the flock.
