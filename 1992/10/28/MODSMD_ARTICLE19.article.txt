Lesbians, gays snubbed on Coming Out Day coverage

SUNDAY, OCT. 11 WAS THE first
Full Moon on the Quad of the year.
It was also National Coming Out
Day. In honor of both, we headed to the
Quad to celebrate. As we sat beneath a
large pink triangle, playing kissing
games with queer friends, we overheard,
"Hey, it's guys kissing guys!" and "Wow,
it's great that they feel free enough to
express themselves." Thinking over our
reasons for participating, we wonder
how many other people that night
understood:
• That you don't have to kiss a senior
of the other sex to become a Stanford
man or woman, that you have choices
and options.
• That it's OK to talk about Les
bian/Gay/Bisexual/Queer issues — in

public, in daily conversation. It's OK to
admit that you have questions and don't
know all the answers.
• That LGBQ folk are capable of doing
silly things and having fun.
National Coming Out Day is too
important for many in the LGBQ com
munity to simply let it pass without
more fanfare. Accordingly, a group of us
handed out pink triangles in White
Plaza the next day.
Friends and strangers, some straight,
some whatever, walked away wearing
triangles that said "Straight but not
Narrow," "Queer Ally," "I Brake for
Dykes," "Queer and Proud." Together,
the two days were a time of overwhelm
ing joy, pride, acceptance, support, com
fort, visibility and celebration.

Considering the importance this day
holds for so many in the LGBQ commu
nity — whether out, closeted or ques
tioning — we are surprised at The
Daily's omission of any reference to
Coming Out Day. Perhaps you don't
realize what this oversight does to us
and those around us.
The absence once again excludes us,
and deems our pride and identities irrel
evant — something to be overlooked and
ignored. Do you not realize that this day
is a time for the LGBQ community to
stand up and be counted? To feel vali
dated and proud? To remind the world
around us that not everything is as they
perceive it to be, that not everything
need to be as it is?
But this is not really about "us" and

"them." Rather, it is about the simple,
common decency the LGBQ community,
just as any other community, deserves.
We challenge The Daily to overcome the
media's hypocrisy of wantonly picking
and choosing which underrepresented
groups to bring to the public's attention.
We do thank everyone who acknowl
edged our presence on Coming Out Day
and our need to celebrate, everyone who
closed the gap by approaching the table
to pick up a pink triangle and especially
those who made the effort but do not
share our views. We only hope The Daily
can learn a lesson from you.
