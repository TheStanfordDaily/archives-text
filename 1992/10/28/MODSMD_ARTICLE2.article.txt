## Brodsky speaks

Imagine strolling in a supermarket
and finding the poems of Robert Frost,
Shakespeare and Keats juxtaposed with
Vogue, The Enquirer and Newsweek.
It's a dream only a poet like Joseph
Brodsky could have.
"I was not joking," said the 1987 Nobel
Prize recipient, referring to an essay in
which he proposes poetry be sold in su
permarket stands.
"It should be sold in hospitals and air
ports as well. That is the way people kill
time or whether time kills them," said

Brodsky, who will hold an open conversa
tion today at 3 p.m. in the Humanities
Center, and read some of his poetry to
morrow night at 7:30 in Annenberg Audi
torium.
"The role of the poet is simple. It is to
write well," Brodsky said. "By writing a
poem, a poet makes a decisive step to
wards society. It is society's duty to meet

Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky will speak
today at 3 p.m. at the Humanities Center. I

the poet halfway."
Born in Leningrad in 1940,
Brodsky began writing poetry at
age 18. "It was simply a creative
impulse of youth at first, outpour
ings," he remembered.
TTiese "outpourings," however,
soon began to irk the Soviet govern
ment, which sentenced him to five
years of exile in Northern Russia.
"I don't think the poetry I wrote
was terribly political. It was sim
ply, presumably, language," said
Brodsky, whose sentence was com
muted after international protests.
; In 1972, however, Brodsky was
again exiled, this time from the
Soviet Union. After living briefly
in Vienna and London, he came to
live in the United States, where he
was named Poet Laureate in 1991.
' After coming to the United
States, Brodsky began to write
poems in both English and Russian.
' t "English is a wonderful thing.
I think I would find myself in a
very peculiar mental state if I had
!to be confined to only one lan
guage," he said.
"I don't think Russian and
English are that much apart as
languages because they come
from a similar psyche and a simi
lar history," said Brodsky.

"If democratic changes in Russia
continue unimpeded, I think in the
foreseeable future, in the course of
my lifetime, there will be more and
more translations of Russian poet
ry into English," he predicted.
Brodsky cites Richard Wilbur,
John Berry man, Derek Walcott,
Thomas Hardy and Frost as some of
his favorite English-language poets.
Of the modern poetry being
written today, Brodsky asserts
that there is no distinct direction.
"Poetry is not a trend. It is like a
starfish or a porcupine. It goes in
all directions," he said.
He acknowledged, however,
that "There has been a great per
centage of poetry that is being
written in a more formal way for
the last part of the second half of
the century. It's more.. .how shall
I put it. .. firmly disciplined. I wel
come this change."
Brodsky's latest book, "Water
marks," is an extended essay on
Venice. "I don't know why, but
something about cities fascinates
me. The appearance, architecture,
the topography.... I like Venice,
and Naples, cities that have water.
"What's behind poetry is simply
is the love of words," Brodsky said.
"If you love words, if you love your
language, you will be attracted to
words and realize what a big thing
it is before you. You will realize
that it is bigger than you are. You
will learn it all your life.
