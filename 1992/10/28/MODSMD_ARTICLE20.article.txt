# Prop 161 provides ill patients with a safe and humane option
## 
### 
In his Oct. 19 letter, Paul Longmore
voiced his concerns about Propostion
161: Physician Aid in Dying. I support
this initiative and would like to allay
his fears.
Proposition 161 was initially drafted
seven years ago and has undergone much
examination and revision by experts in
law, ethics and medicine. In no way is it
"loosely written" or "badly constructed."
It was carefully crafted to respect the
patients' right to privacy and to consider
all moral and religious beliefs. No one
would be forced to participate; indeed, it
would be criminal to coerce or persuade
anyone into this purely voluntary under
taking. There are numerous safeguards.
Under Proposition 161, only those
people verified as terminally ill by two
physicians may request aid in dying. Doc
tors must certify that the patient is of

sound mind, knows the alternatives, gives
informed consent and makes an enduring
request. The request form must be signed
in the presence of two neutral witnesses
and can be revoked at any time, orally or
in writing.
Patients can notify their family, if they
wish. But physicians must respect the
patient's right to privacy. Notification is
up to the patient, who also can choose
who is present during the final procedure.
Mr. Longmore's prediction that "the
practice of euthanasia will be unsuper
vised and unregulated" is a considerable
leap, given the elaborate legal constraints
specifying eligibility and consent.
Nor is it true that disabled persons
would be "classified as terminal" under
Proposition 161. The terminally ill have
less than six months to live, a prediction
that doctors can reasonably make in
many cases. Very few disabled persons,
by this definition, would qualify for
physician-assisted death. The "power
over life and death" would be in the
hands of patients, not doctors.
Proposition 161 would simply allow
those few who qualify to have the option,

should they desire it, to seek a dignified
and painless exit when the only alterna
tive is a personal degradation, unbeat
able pain and prolonged suffering.
