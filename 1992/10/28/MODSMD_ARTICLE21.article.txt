# Perot makes the tough, inevitable choices on the big debt problem
## 
### 
One-hundred fifty billion dollars each
year, every year. Enough money to give
1.9 million students full scholarships
through Stanford. Enough money to
employ nine million people at twice the
minimum wage. Enough money to literal
ly feed every starving mouth in the world.
That is how much more money we'll
spend for the rest of our lives on the
national debt if we don't do something to
balance the budget now. If the budget
were balanced today we would still have
to pay one out of seven tax dollars every

year for the rest of our lives on the inter
est and principal of our $4 trillion debt.
According to authorities like The New
York Times, Bill Clinton's budget propos
al will at best maintain the current $300
billion deficit. If we conservatively
assume that after his four-year tenure
Mr. Clinton is replaced by someone with
deficit reduction as a priority, then by the
time the budget is balanced another $2
trillion will have been added to the debt,
increasing the portion paid to interest to
25 percent.
The cuts Ross Perot suggests would
need to be made either today or in 1996.
Today these cuts would hurt; tomorrow
they will hurt much more. By making
these cuts today we give the government
an extra $150 billion to spend every year
on useful programs.
By delaying we dedicate another 10
percent of the federal budget to be forev
er tied to payments on the debt. The abil
ity of the government to do good for us
will be made that much weaker.
