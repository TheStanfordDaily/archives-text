## Drinking to the politicians 
### 
I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING with a for
mat to vent my frustrations over the
Presidential election when suddenly,
it struck me â€” the Presidential Debate
Drinking Game.
It works on the same premise as the
"Star Trek" drinking game but instead of
drinking every time Picard says "engage"
you drink every time one of the candidates
repeats a particular catch phrase. Its
genius lies not in the endless opportunity
for drinking but in its sadly simple sum
mary of the candidates and campaign.
For example, let's take a look at the
Perot rules. First, drink every time he
mentions the $4 trillion deficit. This is
Perot in a nutshell. Deficit talk alone
would be enough to kill a Mickey's 40-
ouncer.
Then you drink every time he talks
about a new task force, the endless num
ber of plans "lying around Washington,"
how much he loves this country, his elec
tronic town meetings, the giant sucking
sound of jobs to Mexico NAFTA would
produce or utters one of his country
bumpkin analogies about sports teams
and "getting under the hood."
Clinton has so many different topics,
boring statistics and human-interest sto
ries it's almost difficult to follow him for
consistent imbibing. Those of you who
want to keep your buzz for 90 minutes
might consider another candidate. But
may I begin by suggesting a slug every

time he talks about "change." Granted,
we've heard it ad nauseam, but definitely
the most bang for the word, so to speak.
Also, "trickle-down economics" would
provide a good buzz, although the term
has been distorted so badly by both par
ties that no one knows what it means
anymore.
Other points to listen for would be
anytime he pushes a tax on the rich or
points to a Bush veto as a catastrophe
(two drinks for the Family Leave Act
veto). Finally, anytime he rags on "12
years of' anything take a swig. If it's ever
12 years of something positive you drink
everything within reach, but don't count
on it.
Finally, President Bush has honed his
rhetoric down to a few consistent themes
that he harps on continually, so he's
probably the easiest to summarize and
far and away the best choice for those of
you who really like to indulge.
Obviously, for Bush not to mention
"tax and spend" in every other sentence
would be a major deviation from the
script, so bet on that one.
The whole draft evasion, demonstrat
ing in a foreign land, admitting a mis
take, TRUST issue would be a sure win
ner, although I wouldn't mind if I never
heard about Oxford or weekend jaunts to
Moscow ever again.
In easy-to-read list form, take a drink
every time George says: 1) "gridlock" 2)

"trickle-down government" (whatever
that means) 3) "He'll tax Mr. and Mrs.
Middle America." 4) "It's the fault of the
Democratic Congress." 5) "liberal" 6)
"Willie Horton" (Sorry, that's the 1988
game.) 7) "Clinton" in the same breath as
"Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, and
Mike Dukakis" 8) "Our children go to bed
without the fear of nuclear war." or 9)
that Jim Baker will have a specific role in
the new Administration.
Simplistic? Maybe. But the modern
day art of political campaigning demands
a consistently banal repetition for the
television audience's remote-controlled
attention span. The media-dominated
campaigns of the '80s and '90s have
transformed the legitimate exchange
between divergent candidates into a
sound bite war between increasingly sim
ilar, centrist candidates.
Yes, the debate format this year was a
bit more animated than usual, but the
simple fact that this drinking game actu
ally exists (Not to mention that it's so
accurate it can get you really messed up.)
is a testament that the process is adrift.
