## Speech codes can protect minorities, preserve intelligent discourse 
### 
UPON READING TOM Flemma's
column last Wednesday attacking
University policies designed to
protect the interests of its minority com
munities, I was once again disappointed
in the limited scope of understanding
displayed by students such as Flemma in
their appraisal of the complex issues sur
rounding the subject of campus speech
codes.
The issues surrounding the entire
"PC" debate are quite a bit more com
plex than Flemma seems to realize, with
much more at stake than the obvious
possibility of a curtailment of First
Amendment rights or a "chilling effect"
on one's freedom of expression.
While most Americans, myself
included, cling tenaciously to what they
feel is their God-given right to freely
exchange ideas, perceptions and view
points, few would argue that an issue
with as much explosive potential as the
debate over hate speech is as straight
forward as the laughably simplistic

interpretations we are presented with
in countless newspaper columns. It is a
shame to see a publication with as pro
gressive a tradition as The Daily slip
ping into the same stifled, backwards
mode of thinking.
Any thorough assessment of the con
troversy surrounding speech codes will
come to the conclusion that, "Yes, stu
dents do in fact need to feel free to
express themselves" — all Btudents, not
just the straight white males who choose
to scream "faggot" at the walls of a
vacant Otero resident fellow's cottage.
The behavior displayed by Rabois is in
no way noble, or valorous conduct wor
thy of the deification it received in Flem
ma's column, and Rabois is hardly a
modern-day Thoreau resisting his poll
tax.
Classifying Rabois' behavior under
the rubric of constitutionally protected
behavior does little to protect the rights
of the majority while doing much to
damage the atmosphere of tolerance and

acceptance that is a necessary compo
nent of any multi-ethnic community.
Such warped interpretations and abuses
of one's right to express one's feelings
freely are what prompted the creation of
speech codes — a very necessary evil —
in the first place.
The platitudes espoused by Flemma
are quite pleasing to the ear. "Free
speech." "Marketplace of ideas." "Unfet
tered intellectual discourse." These are
all terms that look nice on paper, and in
their purest forms, they are as beautiful
as they sound. Things are never quite as
simple as we'd like them to be, and con
cepts such as free speech and "unfet
tered intellectual discourse" are too vast
ly complex to be defined in the limited,
parochial manner of writers like Flem
ma.
With only a very superficial under
standing of the issues, we run the risk of
encroaching upon the rights of others.
As a minority student at Stanford, I
have encountered little of the ignorance

and intolerance displayed by men such as
Rabois, and I am grateful for this fact.
How much of this has to do with the exis
tence of speech codes, PC and a multicul
tural agenda is hard to say, but if this
"oppressive agenda" is indeed the entity
responsible for what has thus far been a
relatively comfortable and prejudice-free
stay at the university, I will not be the
one to look a gift horse in the mouth.
Obnoxiously displaying one's infantile
fear of homosexuals by wailing epithets
to an empty room can hardly be consid
ered a reasonable engagement of intel
lectual or philosophical discussion.
The relatively peaceful manner in
which the matter resolved itself should
not be seen as any indication of how
future conflicts will be resolved. Vio
lence, hatred and further division seem
the more likely outcomes, as most people
would not be in the mood for calm dis
cussion of, say, gay rights after just
being called a faggot by their "discussion
partner."

"Oh, hi, Keith, how are you? Gee,
what time Lb it? Two in the morning?
Would you perhaps like to discuss why it
is that you're screaming 'faggot' outside of
my window in the middle of the night?"
In short, giving license to Rabois'
behavior by allowing it to seek refuge
under the protective wing of the First
Amendment is like allowing gun stores to
sell Uzi's to children because the Constitu
tion says we have the right to bear arms.
Offering hate speech the sanctuary of
First Amendment protection is a grave
mistake — one that will ultimately create
an atmosphere of hostility, division and
strife — not one of increased communica
tion. My advice to men such as Rabois
would be to somehow dig really deep, get
a grip and the next time the bogeyman of
tolerance creeps out of that closet, don't
jump out of bed and run over to Otero
screaming homophobic epithets. Stay in
your room and turn the lights on.
