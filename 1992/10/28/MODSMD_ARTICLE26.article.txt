# Attorneys debate abortion
## 
### Greg Miller 
On one side of Kresge Auditorium last night was
Greg Cunningham, the author of a 1980 bill ending
state funding for abortion in Pennsylvania. On the
other was Beth Parker, a Harvard Law School grad
uate who recently received a Planned Parenthood
award.
Between them was an issue that polarized the
audience in the same way it has polarized much of
the nation: abortion.
In the debate co-sponsored by Stanford Students
for Life and the ASSU, the two struggled to sway an
audience of about 100 students and local residents.
The sparks began to fly almost immediately when
Cunningham opened his introductory remarks with
a five-minute film consisting primarily of pictures of
torn fetuses.
Cunningham introduced the film by warning of
its graphic nature. "We don't want anyone to be
tricked into watching this," he said. "If you don't
want to see it, we invite you to look away from the
screen. The film is scored only by music."
The musical score, however, was infused with the
pro-life message, containing verses such as "doctors,
who love their money more than man — the butchers of
mankind," and "Save them Lord, or slay them dead."
Parker, in her introductory statement, character
ized the film as "base propaganda," and later said
she hadn't been told there would be a film. "It

seemed like a set-up," Parker said.
Sophomore Maria Alaniz, the moderator of the
debate and a member of Stanford Students for Life,
defended the use of the film, saying, "We told (Park
er) that she could bring anything she wanted to."
"The overwhelming majority of the photos you
saw were of babies in the third trimester," said
Parker, who added that 90 percent of abortions are
performed in the first trimester.
Cunningham responded by saying that the pho
tos were mostly of first and second trimester fetuses
taken from a dumpster behind an abortion clinic in
Houston. "Abortion clinics aren't allowed to per
form an abortion in the third trimester," he said.
"If you have been told that a baby is a blob of tis
sue, you have been lied to," Cunningham said.
"Abortion doesn't merely kill babies, abortion tor
tures babies to death."
Parker countered that in the very early stages of
pregnancy "there are just a few cells. To say that
when the sperm meets the egg there is a child, that's
just not right."
She then defended Roe v. Wade, saying that there is
no reason abortion should again be criminalized. "The
overwhelming msyority of the country feels abortion is
a private issue," Parker said. "I do not believe that
[Cunningham] should impose his views on others."
Cunningham concluded by saying, "We are
becoming preoccupied with our own material well
being, even at the expense of others."
