## The
						story behind Stanford's (not so little) toxic waste site 
### Katherine Kao 
Stanford University may or may not have a lake,
but it definitely has a toxic waste site.
In 1982 the Watkins-Johnson Company discov
ered low levels of chemicals in ground water and soil
under the Hillview-Porter area of the Stanford
Research Park.
The Park is adjacent to Page Mill Road in between
Foothill Expressway and El Camino Real. Stanford
owns the land, but has issued 99-year leases to sever
al companies.
Samples from wells in the adjacent Barron Park
neighborhood indicated low levels of volatile organic
compounds (VOC's), including TCE (trichloroethene)
and DCE (1,2-dichloroethene).
According to information released by the Califor
nia Environmental Protection Agency Department
of Toxic Substances Control, VOCs are known car
cinogens and have a high degree of persistence in the
environment. Other hazardous chemicals present
within the region include Freon, vinyl chloride, chlo
roform, methylene chloride, benzene and toluene.
These contaminants are often by-products of elec
tronics, chemical and other high-tech manufacturing
processes.
Investigations this year conducted by the Califor
nia Environmental Protection Agency indicated lev
els of TCE at 14 parts per billion in ground water at
a maximum depth of 310 feet. In the nearby Barron
Park Neighborhood, located to the south and east of
the research park, a range of concentrations from
zero to 54 parts per billion were detected. The Maxi
mum Contaminant Level of TCE permitting in
drinking water is 5 parts per billion.
Leaky underground storage tanks and pipes
deposited these synthetic compounds into the area
over a long period of time. As one example, the Cali
fornia EPA found that over a 16 year period, from
1974 to 1990, Hewlett-Packard utilized the same
area successively as a chemical dilution storage pit,

shed and bunker.
A 1 Wanger, a representative of the California
Toxic Substances Control Department, said the situ
ation is complex because polluted groundwater is not
static — the water and its associated chemicals are
constantly moving. Although it is known that the
polluted water is heading towards Matadero Creek
and the Barron Park neighborhood, the exact direc
tion and speed of the flow is unknown.

The flow of contaminated groundwater through
the soil forms "plumes," which can commingle as
various contamination sources combine, Wanger
said. The depth of the plumes also varies from loca
tion to location within the region.
Determining the directional flow and the vertical
and horizontal characteristics of the plumes is diffi
cult and time-consuming, but it is a fundamental step
in estimating the concentration of the chemicals and

evaluating feasible remediation methods, he added.
The sheer number of chemicals involved also con
tributes to the difficulty of the problem. The Califor
nia EPA has found approximately 20 to 30 separate
compounds present in appreciable amounts in the
area, and various groups of chemicals can require dif
ferent remediation methods.
Other complications include the region's varied
geology and the interaction between Matadero Creek
and the area's ground water.
Over the past decade some progress has been
made in the clean-up of many of the sites. According
to Wanger, nine locations within the Research Park
were identified as cleanup sites. From December
1988 to April 1992, the California EPA fingered 21
groups as "responsible parties," which meant they
were legally obligated to investigate and clean up the
Hillview-Porter region.
Out of the 21 groups, 14 have responded, includ
ing Stanford University.
This September, one of Hewlett-Packard's con
taminated sites became the first to have its remedial
action plan approved. In a recent company newslet
ter, HP outlined its plans to utilize vapor extraction
with air injection to remediate the soil — a process
wherein vapors with the contaminants are removed
from the soil by applying a vacuum to several strate
gically located wells.
Ground water extracted from the study area will
be run through granular-activated carbon to "filter"
the contaminants. The treated groundwater will
then be discharged into neighboring Matadero
Creek.
"We will begin construction in February of '93
and will be in full operation by July '93," said Joan
Tharp, a spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard. Restor
ing water quality could take a very long time due to
the stringency of state standards, she said. "The
pumping must be done at a very slow rate. Full reme
diation [down to drinking water standards] could
take as long as 10, 15, 20 years."

Hewlett-Packard has chosen the vapor extraction process as the best way to remove contaminants from
its groundwater. It may take over a decade to make the water safe to drink.
