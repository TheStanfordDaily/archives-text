# What not to say to your target

A. Just how "far" did these guys

upstairs to show you their mono
grammed paddles, or as far as the
room with the two-way mirror and
video camera?
I don't mean to sound cranky. It's
just that the blue balls story is the
oldest trick in Man's book of ways to
bring Woman down, and I wish it
weren't an issue in the sexual deci
sion-making of Stanford students or
anyone else.
Thus, when I began researching
this question, I hoped that a jaunt to
Lane medical Library, or a quick chat
with Human Sexuality Lecturer Her
ant Katchadourian, would convince
me that this legendary phenomenon
was merely that — legendary.
Unfortunately, after weighing the
evidence presented by both of these
sources, I must conclude that there is
a grain (perhaps I should say "nut")
of truth in the assertion that sexual
arousal without orgasm can cause
discomfort. The genuine physical
component of such unpleasant feel
ings, however, is trivial.
To put it more succinctly: Blue
balls happens, but it doesn't matter.
Blue balls is likely a side effect of
the natural processes of sexual
arousal. The most noticeable out
ward manifestation of arousal in
both sexes is the congestion of certain
tissues with blood. When confronted
at close range with an object of desire

(or likeness thereof), the skin flushes,
the nipples grow erect and the genital
region becomes engorged with blood.
Such congestion puts pressure on
a man's genital region — which, as
any self-respecting graduate of Self-
Defense for Women knows, is an
excruciatingly sensitive target. If sus
tained, this pressure could result in
mild discomfort.
Since women's tissues also under
go swelling during arousal, the pic
ture I paint above applies equally well
to the Unpredictable Sex. Indeed, as
Prof. Katchadourian pointed out,

women do feel some discomfort asso
ciated with long periods of sexual
excitement.
However, there exist profound
physiological differences between men
and women. The most germane of
these contrasts involves the fact that
men have testicles, and women don't.
Unlike any sexually responsive
organ in women, the testicles are
tightly encapsulated units. When
they are engorged with blood, their
expansion is gravely limited by the
inflexibility of their taut "shell," and
the sharp pressure buildup associat
ed with this expansion may trigger an
unpleasant sensation.
I want to emphasize, however, that
the discomfort potentially associated
with prolonged congestion is minor. It
is definitely not "intense pain." If the

sufferer nearest you is insisting that
your actions (or inaction) is putting
him through agony, he is either so vic
timized by his own desperation that
psychosomatic factors have intensi
fied his discomfort, or he is lying to
get you between the sheets.
As Katchadourian said, "Although
there may be some physiological
basis, I think it is primarily some
thing men use as a basis for eliciting
pity."
There are two "cures" for blue
balls, neither of which requires a trip
to Cowell Student Health Center or

your complicity. A firm "No," fol
lowed by a calm discussion about a
nonsexual subject like integral calcu
lus, will do wonders for relieving the
pressure involved.
An orgasm will also do the trick.
Should you not feel like having the
orifice of your choice used as a vessel
for Biff's release (before he rolls over,
falls asleep and starts dreaming
about the new notch in his pledge
pin) remind him that this "cure" is
not something a man finds too diffi
cult to take care of by himself.
And if he's still too insistent,
remember what I said about sensitive
targets.

women do feel some discomfort asso
ciated with long periods of sexual
excitement.
However, there exist profound
physiological differences between men
and women. The most germane of
these contrasts involves the fact that
men have testicles, and women don't.
Unlike any sexually responsive
organ in women, the testicles are
tightly encapsulated units. When
they are engorged with blood, their
expansion is gravely limited by the
inflexibility of their taut "shell," and
the sharp pressure buildup associat
ed with this expansion may trigger an
unpleasant sensation.
I want to emphasize, however, that
the discomfort potentially associated
with prolonged congestion is minor. It
is definitely not "intense pain." If the

sufferer nearest you is insisting that
your actions (or inaction) is putting
him through agony, he is either so vic
timized by his own desperation that
psychosomatic factors have intensi
fied his discomfort, or he is lying to
get you between the sheets.
As Katchadourian said, "Although
there may be some physiological
basis, I think it is primarily some
thing men use as a basis for eliciting
pity."
There are two "cures" for blue
balls, neither of which requires a trip
to Cowell Student Health Center or

your complicity. A firm "No," fol
lowed by a calm discussion about a
nonsexual subject like integral calcu
lus, will do wonders for relieving the
pressure involved.
An orgasm will also do the trick.
Should you not feel like having the
orifice of your choice used as a vessel
for Biff's release (before he rolls over,
falls asleep and starts dreaming
about the new notch in his pledge
pin) remind him that this "cure" is
not something a man finds too diffi
cult to take care of by himself.
And if he's still too insistent,
remember what I said about sensitive
targets.
