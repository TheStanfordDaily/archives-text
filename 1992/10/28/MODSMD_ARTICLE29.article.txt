Ben Franklin did it with a kite. Now, Assoc.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Umran Inan will
try to strike down the mysteries of lightning
using remote sensing equipment slightly more
advanced than a key on a string.
Inan, who works in the Space Telecommu
nications and Radioscience Laboratory, and
other Stanford researchers will set up remote
sensing equipment in Newfoundland to con
duct experiments to understand the interac
tion of lightning with the ionosphere, a
region of the atmosphere 100 kilometers
from Earth.
The experiment will examine lightning
ionosphere interactions, so that researchers
can get a better understanding of lightning
and how it affects the entire atmosphere, Inan
said.
By understanding such interactions, scien
tists may be able to obtain insight into issues
such as global warming and the energy bal
ance of the Earth, he added.
The ionosphere is composed of ionized
atoms. During the day the sun's intense rays
pummel atoms, stripping off electrons.
During the night cosmic rays from the sun
also ionize the atmosphere, but the density of
electrons in the ionosphere is much lower.
The majority of Inan's experiment will be
conducted at night due to equipment con
straints.
Inan is presently recording ionospheric
disturbances from six other remote sensing
stations around the world.
"We measure the changing density of elec
trons in the ionosphere," Inan said, "and the
change of temperature, which [indicates] how
energetic the electrons are."
Numerous factors can affect the flow of
electrons in the ionosphere, according to elec
trical engineering graduate student Juan
Rodriguez, who designed and built the sens
ing equipment.
Rodriguez indicated that lightning — and
to a lesser extent radio transmissions —
cause acceleration of the natural flow of elec
trons in the ionosphere, a process called iono
spheric heating.
The ionosphere is, in essence, an umbrella

shielding the Earth. When ionospheric heat
ing takes place, a protuberance develops on
the surface of the umbrella. "Heating causes
a change in the conictivity of the ionosphere,"
Rodriguez said. "It would look like a small
bump — like a pimple."
Lightning releases so much energy, Inan
said, it causes visual effects in the iono
sphere. On the other hand, transmitters are
energetically weaker, so there are no visual
effects.
However, since transmitters still affect the
ionosphere similarly to lightning, Inan is able
to use them, instead of lightning, in order to
simulate the effect lightning has on the iono
sphere.
It is difficult to design an experiment that
needs a lightning strike in order to collect
data, Inan indicated. "We are using a man
made signal with which we can do controlled
experiments and ultimately figure out what
lightning does."
The Stanford researchers are utilizing
U.S. Navy communication transmitters to
heat electrons. By turning the transmitters
on and off, the sensing equipment, housed on
the transmitters, will be able to measure
changes in the ionosphere.
When the transmitters are turned off
there is no effect on the ionosphere. But
when scientists activate the transmitters,
ionospheric heating occurs, and the sensing
equipment will measure the extent of heat
ing.
The scientists chose to put the remote
sensing equipment in Newfoundland because
it is located in a direct line with the two Navy
transmitters, one in Annapolis, Maryland,
and the other in Maine. The transmitters
produce about the same amount of power as
an AM radio station.
The position of the sensing equipment will
allow researchers to measure the effects of
both transmitters on the atmosphere.
This experiment is one in a series Stanford
is conducting concerning lightning's effect on
the atmosphere. Arizona, where lightning is
more common, may be the next sight.
"This is one step towards a more ambi
tious experiment where we will go after light
ning itself," Inan said.
