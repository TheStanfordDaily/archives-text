# Students seek support for streamlined SWOPSI series
## 
### Eileen Schnabel 
A small group of students has
begun raising money and seeking
support to resurrect SWOPSI, but
the innovative course offerings
may reappear under a new name
and without academic credit.
A victim of budget cuts last
year, the Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues allowed
graduate and undergraduate stu
dents to lead classes in areas of
personal expertise.
"We are looking for funding
outside the University depart

ments through groups such as the
ASSU, dorms, alumni contribu
tors and outside foundations," se
nior Susan Fox said.
Synergy House, which was
formed as a result of a SWOPSI
workshop in 1972, has contributed
the largest donation to date: $750.
By streamlining the program
and possibly dispensing with the
full-time administrator position,
organizers hope they can afford to
bring the program back to life.
Senior John Abromeit has also
suggested that the $800 previous
ly paid to instructors for each

course could be reduced.
Graduate student Shira
Wohlberg said she believes
streamlining the program would
be beneficial. "The huge allotment
took away from the grass-roots be
ginning," she said.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo, the
associate dean of humanities and
sciences, said students are wel
come to initiate, organize and even
teach courses.
But participants in student
taught courses will not receive
academic credit as they did for
SWOPSI, he added.

"Clearly, there is not going to
be a new SWOPSI. The program
will not be reinstated," he said.
Students needed a faculty spon
sor and approval by an academic
accreditation committee to teach
SWOPSI classes.
Camarillo said funding was cut
because the University, facing very
difficult fiscal constraints, had to
make decisions pn what was the
University's core mission. Innova
tive Academic Courses, which ad
ministered SWOPSI, was deemed
to be outside of that central goal.
"The core mission is courses

taught by faculty and research
sponsored by faculty," Camarillo
said.
Abromeit, however, said the
program served an important pur
pose.
"SWOPSI recognized that pro
fessors are not the only ones in the
Stanford community who have
much to teach undergraduates,"
he said.
According to Fox, who would
like to see student-taught classes
receive credit, "SWOPSI gives stu
dents and people a chance to learn
new things in new ways that you

don't necessarily learn in a tradi
tional academic setting."
The crux of the problem, she
said, is how big of a role the faculty
will play. Students and professors
might teach together, she said.
SWOPSI was previously
grouped together under the lAC
with Undergraduate Special
courses and Peters Seminars.
The Peters Seminars, which
are taught by faculty and have
their own endowment funding,
will be offered again through regu
lar University departments in
winter quarter.
