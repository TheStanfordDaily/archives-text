# One should shun sun because becoming well done is not fun

### Catherine Ivey 
With afternoon temperatures lately
reaching mid 80s and 90s, the temptation
to blow off class and tan one's bod may be
high, but don't give in. While your tan
might make you look great now, chances
are in the long run you'll wish you'd
stayed inside.

Many people are aware of the damage
that the sun can do, but few people realize
that skin cancer is the most common form
of cancer in the United States. In fact,
according to estimates by the National
Cancer Institute, 40 to 50 percent of
Americans who live to age 65 will develop
skin cancer at least once.
The principle cause of skin cancer is
overexposure to ultraviolet radiation
from the sun. Although other risk factors
such as family history, exposure to car
cinogens, sun lamps or tanning booths
can also lead to skin cancer, the NCI
blames the sun as the main cause of skin
cancer.

Much to many people's dismay (Cali
fornians especially) there is, in fact, no
such thing as a healthy tan. On the con
trary, a suntan is evidence that damage
has been done to the skin.
The skin, or epidermis, is comprised of
several cell layers. On the surface lie the
squamous cells; beneath them are basal
and melanoma cell layers.
When the sun's rays are very intense,
UV rays can penetrate through these lay
ers, wreaking havoc on normal cell pro
cesses like replication. The result? Uncon
trollable proliferation of these damaged
cells, otherwise known as cancer.
The skin's main defense against over
exposure is the production of a pigment
called melanin at the site of the penetra
tion. Melanin is responsible for causing
the skin to turn a darker color in efforts to
protect itself from the sun. This "protec
tion," however, is slight and only mini
mally helps prevent damage.
The American Academy of Dermatolo
gy categorizes three types of skin cancer:
basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carci
noma and malignant melanoma, each cor
responding to the cell layer in which dam
age occurs. Of the three, basal and squa
mous cell carcinomas are the most com

mon skin cancers, while malignant
melanoma is the most virulent.
However, the AAD claims that if
detected in early stages, all three cancers
can usually be treated with great success.
Still, successful treatment is no guar
antee that the cancer is permanently
removed. A study released earlier this
summer from Dartmouth Medical School
found that among those subjects with
prior history of at least one skin cancer,
35 percent developed a repeat case within
three years of treatment. Within five
years of the original treatment, subjects
had a 50 percent risk of new skin cancers.
The Dartmouth study also showed fair
skinned and light-haired individuals to
have higher risks for cancer recurrence
than those with darker complexions or
hair color. Living in California was also
determined to be a risk factor.
In addition, males, people with a his
tory of multiple skin cancers, and those
who spent more time outdoors were
more at-risk. The authors concluded
that "avoidance of future solar damage
seems prudent" for those with a history
of cancer.
Although most skin cancers frequently
develop around 60 years of age, skin can

cers can occur in much younger people.
Rather than waiting until cancer devel
ops to get serious about sun damage,
there are many ways to reduce skin can
cer risks. The following suggestions are
compiled from the National Cancer Insti
tute, the American Academy of Dermatol
ogy, the Neutrogena Skincare Institute
and Cowell Student Health Center:
• Know yourself. By becoming familiar
with your moles, freckles and "beauty
marks" you can monitor any develop
ments that might occur in your skin.
Changes in size, color or appearance of
moles or colored patches should be noted
and reported to a physician immediately.
Periodically checking your entire body,
especially your scalp and neck, in front a
full-length mirror will insure that no
places are overlooked.
• Wear protective clothing on hot days.
Hats and shirts are good for blocking out
harmful rays. Lightweight, loose-weave
or wet garments won't.
• Rub in some sunscreen. Sunscreens
should be applied liberally whenever you
plan to be out in the sun for extended
periods of time. Each sunscreen is rated
by Sun Protection Factor ratings to help
you choose a lotion that is right for your

skin. If you have fair hair and light skin,
or a tend to burn easily, you'll want to
stick with higher numbered sunblocks
like SPF 15 and 20.
• Be careful regardless of risk-factor.
Black or brown skin is no guarantee that
you're free from the sun's penetrating
rays. Dark skinned people can also devel
op melanomas, especially on soles of the
feet, palms of the hand, under nails or in
the mouth.
• Protect yourself from midday sun.
The sun is most powerful during the
hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Avoid overex
posure during these times by planning
outside activities earlier or later.
If you need further incentive to forego
baking in the sun, consider this: habitual
exposure to the sun has been shown to
accelerate cellular aging.
Collagen and elastin are proteins in the
skin that function to keep tissue supple
and elastic. If they are damaged by the
sun, they break down, clump together and
thicken. The result? (Hint: Have you seen
what the California sun does to raisins?)

plan to be out in the sun for extended
periods of time. Each sunscreen is rated
by Sun Protection Factor ratings to help
you choose a lotion that is right for your

skin. If you have fair hair and light skin,
or a tend to burn easily, you'll want to
stick with higher numbered sunblocks
like SPF 15 and 20.
• Be careful regardless of risk-factor.
Black or brown skin is no guarantee that
you're free from the sun's penetrating
rays. Dark skinned people can also devel
op melanomas, especially on soles of the
feet, palms of the hand, under nails or in
the mouth.
• Protect yourself from midday sun.
The sun is most powerful during the
hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Avoid overex
posure during these times by planning
outside activities earlier or later.
If you need further incentive to forego
baking in the sun, consider this: habitual
exposure to the sun has been shown to
accelerate cellular aging.
Collagen and elastin are proteins in the
skin that function to keep tissue supple
and elastic. If they are damaged by the
sun, they break down, clump together and
thicken. The result? (Hint: Have you seen
what the California sun does to raisins?)

With afternoon temperatures lately
reaching mid 80s and 90s, the temptation
to blow off class and tan one's bod may be
high, but don't give in. While your tan
might make you look great now, chances
are in the long run you'll wish you'd
stayed inside.

Health watch

Many people are aware of the damage
that the sun can do, but few people realize
that skin cancer is the most common form
of cancer in the United States. In fact,
according to estimates by the National
Cancer Institute, 40 to 50 percent of
Americans who live to age 65 will develop
skin cancer at least once.
The principle cause of skin cancer is
overexposure to ultraviolet radiation
from the sun. Although other risk factors
such as family history, exposure to car
cinogens, sun lamps or tanning booths
can also lead to skin cancer, the NCI
blames the sun as the main cause of skin
cancer.

Much to many people's dismay (Cali
fornians especially) there is, in fact, no
such thing as a healthy tan. On the con
trary, a suntan is evidence that damage
has been done to the skin.
The skin, or epidermis, is comprised of
several cell layers. On the surface lie the
squamous cells; beneath them are basal
and melanoma cell layers.
When the sun's rays are very intense,
UV rays can penetrate through these lay
ers, wreaking havoc on normal cell pro
cesses like replication. The result? Uncon
trollable proliferation of these damaged
cells, otherwise known as cancer.
The skin's main defense against over
exposure is the production of a pigment
called melanin at the site of the penetra
tion. Melanin is responsible for causing
the skin to turn a darker color in efforts to
protect itself from the sun. This "protec
tion," however, is slight and only mini
mally helps prevent damage.
The American Academy of Dermatolo
gy categorizes three types of skin cancer:
basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carci
noma and malignant melanoma, each cor
responding to the cell layer in which dam
age occurs. Of the three, basal and squa
mous cell carcinomas are the most com

mon skin cancers, while malignant
melanoma is the most virulent.
However, the AAD claims that if
detected in early stages, all three cancers
can usually be treated with great success.
Still, successful treatment is no guar
antee that the cancer is permanently
removed. A study released earlier this
summer from Dartmouth Medical School
found that among those subjects with
prior history of at least one skin cancer,
35 percent developed a repeat case within
three years of treatment. Within five
years of the original treatment, subjects
had a 50 percent risk of new skin cancers.
The Dartmouth study also showed fair
skinned and light-haired individuals to
have higher risks for cancer recurrence
than those with darker complexions or
hair color. Living in California was also
determined to be a risk factor.
In addition, males, people with a his
tory of multiple skin cancers, and those
who spent more time outdoors were
more at-risk. The authors concluded
that "avoidance of future solar damage
seems prudent" for those with a history
of cancer.
Although most skin cancers frequently
develop around 60 years of age, skin can

cers can occur in much younger people.
Rather than waiting until cancer devel
ops to get serious about sun damage,
there are many ways to reduce skin can
cer risks. The following suggestions are
compiled from the National Cancer Insti
tute, the American Academy of Dermatol
ogy, the Neutrogena Skincare Institute
and Cowell Student Health Center:
• Know yourself. By becoming familiar
with your moles, freckles and "beauty
marks" you can monitor any develop
ments that might occur in your skin.
Changes in size, color or appearance of
moles or colored patches should be noted
and reported to a physician immediately.
Periodically checking your entire body,
especially your scalp and neck, in front a
full-length mirror will insure that no
places are overlooked.
• Wear protective clothing on hot days.
Hats and shirts are good for blocking out
harmful rays. Lightweight, loose-weave
or wet garments won't.
• Rub in some sunscreen. Sunscreens
should be applied liberally whenever you
plan to be out in the sun for extended
periods of time. Each sunscreen is rated
