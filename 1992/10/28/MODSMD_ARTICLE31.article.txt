## Soccer musters 14th win, edges Aztecs by 2-1 score Andeberhan, players unhappy about sluggish play 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's soccer
team edged San Diego State 2-1
yesterday in a manner that is
looking all too familiar to coach
Berhane Andeberhan.
The Cardinal started out flat
while the underdog Aztecs were
fired up. Stanford managed to
avert a loss with two unanswered
goals but played sub-par soccer
for most of the game.
"It was a terrible game," said
the clearly frustrated Cardinal
coach. "People came mentally
unprepared and just expected to
win instead of taking responsibil
ity for doing the job."
Team captain Julie Foudy also
noticed the lag in first-half play
and yelled for her teammates to,
"Put some enthusiasm into this!
Pick it up!" And she had reason to
worry about the team's play. Mid
way through the first half, San
Diego State forward Lynn Mur
ray picked off an errant pass from
Stanford sweeper Jessica Fischer
and sped toward the Cardinal
goal.
With the defense caught flat,
goalie Lesley Garrard started out
from the goalmouth to challenge
Murray. Once she committed to
the play, Murray blooped the ball
over her head. Garrard leapt
backwards but couldn't reach the
ball, which landed a few feet in
front of the net and rolled in.
While the Aztecs celebrated,
the Cardinal tried to regroup.
"We started off very slowly,"
Foudy said. "People didn't play
with intensity. The coaches told
us to play a low pressure defense
and maybe people thought that
meant don't even play."

But the Stanford players
seemed to realize a loss in this
game could erase their playoff
hopes altogether and began to
pick up their play.

'The playoffs aren't
going to happen
unless we focus on
these last few games.'
— Julie Foudy

The Cardinal evened the game
minutes later. Foudy took the ball
into the corner and then whirled
around a defender to feed Sarah
Rafanelli, who was cutting
toward the post. Instead of shoot
ing, the forward one-touched the
ball out to sophomore Amanda
Tyler, who blasted the shot low
and wide past the diving goal
keeper.
With the score tied at one,
Stanford opened the second half
with junior Chris Massell in goal.
Although she had to make only
one non-routine save to insure
the victory, Massell stayed vocal
and impressed her coach.
In fact, Andeberhan plans to
start Massell in the next game
and implied that Garrard would
have to take the job back from the
senior if she hopes to be the No. 1
keeper.
"Chris played with a lot of con
fidence and passion," Andeber
han said. "She's our team leader
off the field. It's tough to be a
reserve but she never pouts, com
plains or slacks off. There was an
opening and she made the most of
it, so she's got to be rewarded for

that."
But Andeberhan was disap
pointed not only with Garrard's
play, but with that of the whole
squad. He sent several reserves
into play in hopes of sparking the
Cardinal.
"I was just trying to find some
one who was interested in play
ing," he said. "We seem to have
lost all passion for the game."
Sparked by the reserves' play,
Stanford took the lead for good on
a textbook play executed by
Rafanelli and Foudy. On a free
kick taken by Foudy, Stanford
overloaded the far side of the goal
in the hope that someone break
ing across the goalmouth would
get a shot. That's exactly what
happened, as Rafanelli raced
toward the pass and, with a flip of
her head, knocked the ball past
the charging Aztec goalie and into
the corner of the net.
Despite his team's improved
play in the second half, Andeber
han was not pleased. "Yes, we
played a little better in the second
half, but we were behind so we
had to," said the coach, who was
stumped as to why the team con
tinues to lack intensity, especially
in first-half play.
"I'm all out of ideas," he said.
The players themselves
couldn't quite find a reason for
the sluggish play. "It was like we
had to warm up before we could
play," Rafanelli said.
"It shouldn't take them scor
ing for us to get into the game,"
Foudy said. "It's like we can't get
up for a game unless its a big one.
That's stupid because if we lose
one of these, we're out of it. ...
The playoffs aren't going to hap
pen unless we focus on these last
few games."

toward the post. Instead of shoot
ing, the forward one-touched the
ball out to sophomore Amanda
Tyler, who blasted the shot low
and wide past the diving goal
keeper.
With the score tied at one,
Stanford opened the second half
with junior Chris Massell in goal.
Although she had to make only
one non-routine save to insure
the victory, Massell stayed vocal
and impressed her coach.
In fact, Andeberhan plans to
start Massell in the next game
and implied that Garrard would
have to take the job back from the
senior if she hopes to be the No. 1
keeper.
"Chris played with a lot of con
fidence and passion," Andeber
han said. "She's our team leader
off the field. It's tough to be a
reserve but she never pouts, com
plains or slacks off. There was an
opening and she made the most of
it, so she's got to be rewarded for

that."
But Andeberhan was disap
pointed not only with Garrard's
play, but with that of the whole
squad. He sent several reserves
into play in hopes of sparking the
Cardinal.
"I was just trying to find some
one who was interested in play
ing," he said. "We seem to have
lost all passion for the game."
Sparked by the reserves' play,
Stanford took the lead for good on
a textbook play executed by
Rafanelli and Foudy. On a free
kick taken by Foudy, Stanford
overloaded the far side of the goal
in the hope that someone break
ing across the goalmouth would
get a shot. That's exactly what
happened, as Rafanelli raced
toward the pass and, with a flip of
her head, knocked the ball past
the charging Aztec goalie and into
the corner of the net.
Despite his team's improved
play in the second half, Andeber
han was not pleased. "Yes, we
played a little better in the second
half, but we were behind so we
had to," said the coach, who was
stumped as to why the team con
tinues to lack intensity, especially
in first-half play.
"I'm all out of ideas," he said.
The players themselves
couldn't quite find a reason for
the sluggish play. "It was like we
had to warm up before we could
play," Rafanelli said.
"It shouldn't take them scor
ing for us to get into the game,"
Foudy said. "It's like we can't get
up for a game unless its a big one.
That's stupid because if we lose
one of these, we're out of it. ...
The playoffs aren't going to hap
pen unless we focus on these last
few games."

Senior midfielder Jen Potok readies for the attack of an SDSU player. Despite their uninspired play for
much of the first half, Potok and her Cardinal teammates ran their record to an impressive 14-1-1 with
yesterday's victory.
The Stanford women's soccer
team edged San Diego State 2-1
yesterday in a manner that is
looking all too familiar to coach
Berhane Andeberhan.
The Cardinal started out flat
while the underdog Aztecs were
fired up. Stanford managed to
avert a loss with two unanswered
goals but played sub-par soccer
for most of the game.
"It was a terrible game," said
the clearly frustrated Cardinal
coach. "People came mentally
unprepared and just expected to
win instead of taking responsibil
ity for doing the job."
Team captain Julie Foudy also
noticed the lag in first-half play
and yelled for her teammates to,
"Put some enthusiasm into this!
Pick it up!" And she had reason to
worry about the team's play. Mid
way through the first half, San
Diego State forward Lynn Mur
ray picked off an errant pass from
Stanford sweeper Jessica Fischer
and sped toward the Cardinal
goal.
With the defense caught flat,
goalie Lesley Garrard started out
from the goalmouth to challenge
Murray. Once she committed to
the play, Murray blooped the ball
over her head. Garrard leapt
backwards but couldn't reach the
ball, which landed a few feet in
front of the net and rolled in.
While the Aztecs celebrated,
the Cardinal tried to regroup.
"We started off very slowly,"
Foudy said. "People didn't play
with intensity. The coaches told
us to play a low pressure defense
and maybe people thought that
meant don't even play."

But the Stanford players
seemed to realize a loss in this
game could erase their playoff
hopes altogether and began to
pick up their play.

'The playoffs aren't
going to happen
unless we focus on
these last few games.'

The Cardinal evened the game
minutes later. Foudy took the ball
into the corner and then whirled
around a defender to feed Sarah
Rafanelli, who was cutting
toward the post. Instead of shoot
ing, the forward one-touched the
ball out to sophomore Amanda
Tyler, who blasted the shot low
and wide past the diving goal
keeper.
With the score tied at one,
Stanford opened the second half
with junior Chris Massell in goal.
Although she had to make only
