# Day at races clears mind, pockets of daring columnist
## 
### 
A few weeks ago, I ventured for the
first time this year to see a sporting
event away from the Stanford cam
pus. And to my amazement, the event did
not involve Cal, the Warriors, the Giants,
or the A's. I went to the track.
When my friend Jay asked if I wanted
to go to the track with a few friends, I was
at first unsure what he meant. "You
mean horse racing?" I asked.
"Exactly," he said.
So after watching the first half of
Stanford-Notre Dame on television, we
piled into the car and headed to Bay
Meadows. Armed with a Togo's sandwich
and $30 in my wallet, I had no idea what
to expect. Before this day, my only expe
rience with horse racing had been watch
ing the Kentucky Derby and listening to
Trevor Denman announce the stretch
run from Santa Anita on the radio news.
Meanwhile, Jay was fully prepped, hav
ing bought the Daily Racing Forum and
marked it with notes and betting strate
gies.
Upon arrival, we purchased reserve
grandstand seats, went upstairs, and sat
in a nice, clean, air-conditioned area. I
had pictured in my mind a dirty,

unkempt place where we would stand
outside and everyone but us would have
huge Stoagies in their mouths — but I
was pleasantly surprised. Adjacent to us
was the Turf Club, where yuppie regulars
sipped wine and watched the races.
I decided to sit the first few races out
so I could learn what to do. At the same
time, while my friend Andy explained
how to read the program to me, Jay had
already placed a bet on the Daily Double
— and won a quick $50.
There was so much to learn. Before
placing a bet, I had to study every horse
in the race, and every aspect about the
race itself. Things to consider were each
horse's starting position, the odds on the
horse to win, who the jockey was, who the

trainer was, whether the race was on turf
(grass) or on dirt, how long the race was
(6 furlongs, 1 mile, etc.), the age of the
horse and the horse's recent race perfor
mance. And I thought Stanford was
tough.
As if all the detail wasn't enough to
get me lost, I had a hard time concen
trating because I was surrounded by
television screens showing the Stanford
game. There are 30 minutes between
races, so at least I could watch football.
I used the opportunity to focus in on
the Cardinal, who were in the midst of
pulling off a stunning upset. Soon
after, I was ready to bet, feeling a little
extra-confident because of the Stanford
victory.
I had $24 to work with after the
admission fee. I waited in line, and placed
a $3 bet on the number four horse to win.
A short period later, my $3 and I parted
company. Andy had taken a brief break
from his teaching duties and bet $2 on a
40-1 longshot in the same race. It was his
lucky day, for two minutes later he was
holding $80.
At this point, I was dismayed. I had
waited almost 10 minutes in line to place

a bet that disappeared about as fast as it
took for me to hand over my cash to the
teller. There must be a better way, I
thought.
Then I saw the computer betting
machines, but had no idea how to use
them. You could bet an exacta, an exacta
box or many other combinations that I
did not understand or remember. This
time, after learning the machines, I
placed $5 down — and lost again. So far, I
was $8 down, with possibly no end in
sight.
But the entertainment of the race
itself was so great that it was easy to for
get the losses and return to bet once
again. For what had been just a bunch of
horses running around the track in the
first two races turned into a spectacle
where I had a personal stake. I found
myself cheering for a horse down the
stretch along with the rest of the crowd,
caring whether 49er Days beat Quatif in
the Feature.
In the sixth race, it happened. After
complaining for the past hour that I had
not won anything, I placed a $3 bet on a
2-1 odds horse, but the odds changed
from the time I was in my seat to the time

I got to the window. The trainer on my
horse was Russell Baze, who is one of the
best, and the horse came through for me.
I was excited. I ran down to the window
and proudly collected my $2.80. This was
easy money.
Then I got a little cocky, placing multi
ple bets on exactas and exacta boxes. I got
delusions that I was knowledgeable, slap
ping cash on the counter because I liked
the jockeys, Gary Stevens and Chris
McCarron, because they are from my
hometown of L.A.
I bet on Luthier Enchanter because
the name sounded good. The only exacta
I got was exactly nothing. I won one other
time ($5), but the balance was definitely
in the negative. I kept thinking I could
turn it around, but my wallet was telling
me otherwise. I could see myself getting
hooked on this.
After betting my remaining sums in
the final race, I went home poorer but
wiser, though I did get a souvenir set of
Bay Meadows drinking glasses.
