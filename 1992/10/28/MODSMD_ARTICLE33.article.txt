# Road to Roses goes through Seattle
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
Pacific 10 Conference watchers will
see the Rose Bowl race crystallize after
Stanford's match-up with No. 2 Wash
ington in Seattle this Saturday. At the
same time, coach Bill Walsh should
learn a thing or two about his 15th
ranked Cardinal.
Stanford enters the game with a 6-
2 overall record and is 3-1 in the Pac
-10. A win would make the Cardinal
the front-runner in the conference
title chase and give it a virtual lock on
some kind of New Year's Day bowl
berth.
A loss, on the other hand, could send
Stanford plummeting to as low as a tie
for fifth place in the conference and
conceivably out of the nation's top 20.
Saturday's is a pivotal game.
But don't take that line of thought
too far.
"This could very well be a game
where we find out what kind of team we
have. This is a big game, a conference
game with serious Rose Bowl implica
tions," Walsh said.
"On the other hand. . .we could still
have an excellent season if we lose. So
we won't throw everything into this
week and pack it in if we fail."
That's reasonable thinking, especial
ly considering the defending national
champion Huskies are 7-0 and have
won 21 consecutive contests, dating
back to November, 1990.

As has often been the case in the Pac
-10 this year, two of the nation's top
defenses will clash this weekend. Wash
ington's perennially stingy defense will
pose problems for Stanford and its
struggling offensive line.
While the Huskies have given up
more yards this year than in seasons
past, their game has been of the "bend
but not break" variety.
In other words, despite giving up
over 300 yards per game, they are sec
ond nationwide only to Alabama in
scoring defense, at 9.6 points per game.
Those are the kind of statistics of
which national championships are
made.
And Washington, as one of only four
NCAA Division I unbeaten, untied
teams, is indeed chasing another NCAA
title. Miami and Washington, after
sharing the national championship in
1991, have shared the top spot of the
AT and USA Today/CNN wire polls this
season.
But the Huskies' performance in the
last two weeks against unheralded Ore
gon and Pacific apparently left voters
less than impressed, and Washington
has dropped to No. 2 in both polls.
The Cardinal defensive 11 have
arguably outshined their Seattle coun
terparts this season. Stanford is cur
rently ranked third nationally in total
defense, allowing a paltry 245 yards per
game.
That impressive eight-game perfor
mance has been led bv outside lineback

er Ron George, who this week was
named one of 10 semifinalists for the
Butkus Award, given annually to the
nation's best linebacker.
George currently leads the Pac-10 in
sacks with 12 and in tackles for a loss
with 19.
Joining George in that prestigious
group of 10 is the stalwart of the Husky
defense, inside linebacker Dave Hoff
man. Hoffman leads the Huskies with
62 tackles, eight sacks and 15 tackles
for a loss.
For the first time this season, the
Cardinal will face an offense that
rotates at the quarterback position.
Senior Mark Brunell starts as the
Huskies' signal caller, but gives way for
a few series at a time to junior Billy Joe
Hobert.
Brunell is a left-hander with speed
who can run the option and move well
outside of the pocket. But head coach
Don James doesn't lose anything in the
way of talent when right-hander Hobert
enters.
Hobert led last year's dominant
Washington team to Pasadena and
ended the year by garnering Rose Bowl
MVP honors.
A defensive coach, James acts oblivi
ous to the unorthodoxv of the system he
has implemented.
"I'd do the same at any other posi
tion on the field if I had two very talent
ed players. And we've won all seven
games, so it can't be causing much of a
problem."

A loss, on the other hand, could send
Stanford plummeting to as low as a tie
for fifth place in the conference and
conceivably out of the nation's top 20.
Saturday's is a pivotal game.
But don't take that line of thought
too far.
"This could very well be a game
where we find out what kind of team we
have. This is a big game, a conference
game with serious Rose Bowl implica
tions," Walsh said.
"On the other hand. . .we could still
have an excellent season if we lose. So
we won't throw everything into this
week and pack it in if we fail."
That's reasonable thinking, especial
ly considering the defending national
champion Huskies are 7-0 and have
won 21 consecutive contests, dating
back to November, 1990.

As has often been the case in the Pac
-10 this year, two of the nation's top
defenses will clash this weekend. Wash
ington's perennially stingy defense will
pose problems for Stanford and its
struggling offensive line.
While the Huskies have given up
more yards this year than in seasons
past, their game has been of the "bend
but not break" variety.
In other words, despite giving up
over 300 yards per game, they are sec
ond nationwide only to Alabama in
scoring defense, at 9.6 points per game.
Those are the kind of statistics of
which national championships are
made.
And Washington, as one of only four
NCAA Division I unbeaten, untied
teams, is indeed chasing another NCAA
title. Miami and Washington, after
sharing the national championship in
1991, have shared the top spot of the
AT and USA Today/CNN wire polls this
season.
But the Huskies' performance in the
last two weeks against unheralded Ore
gon and Pacific apparently left voters
less than impressed, and Washington
has dropped to No. 2 in both polls.
The Cardinal defensive 11 have
arguably outshined their Seattle coun
terparts this season. Stanford is cur
rently ranked third nationally in total
defense, allowing a paltry 245 yards per
game.
That impressive eight-game perfor
mance has been led bv outside lineback

er Ron George, who this week was
named one of 10 semifinalists for the
Butkus Award, given annually to the
nation's best linebacker.
George currently leads the Pac-10 in
sacks with 12 and in tackles for a loss
with 19.
Joining George in that prestigious
group of 10 is the stalwart of the Husky
defense, inside linebacker Dave Hoff
man. Hoffman leads the Huskies with
62 tackles, eight sacks and 15 tackles
for a loss.
For the first time this season, the
Cardinal will face an offense that
rotates at the quarterback position.
Senior Mark Brunell starts as the
Huskies' signal caller, but gives way for
a few series at a time to junior Billy Joe
Hobert.
Brunell is a left-hander with speed
who can run the option and move well
outside of the pocket. But head coach
Don James doesn't lose anything in the
way of talent when right-hander Hobert
enters.
Hobert led last year's dominant
Washington team to Pasadena and
ended the year by garnering Rose Bowl
MVP honors.
A defensive coach, James acts oblivi
ous to the unorthodoxv of the system he
has implemented.
"I'd do the same at any other posi
tion on the field if I had two very talent
ed players. And we've won all seven
games, so it can't be causing much of a
problem."

Stanford's stingy defense, featuring seniors such as linebacker Dave Garnett and nose
tackle Aaron Rembisz, ranks third in the nation as the Cardinal heads to Seattle this
weekend.
