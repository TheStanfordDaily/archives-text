# When the home field isn't such an advantage

What is Stanford football? Images of Bill
Walsh, Glyn Milburn, a top-20 ranking, the
Stanford Band and thousands of raucous
students jumping and shouting after the
count of eight come to mind.
But when the Cardinal took on North
western and the University of Oregon ear
lier this season, Stanford Stadium offered a
much different picture — no students.
These games took place in September, well
before students had arrived on campus.
In 1992, the Cardinal played three of its
six home contests before the full student
body had arrived.
This problem is by no means a new one,
either. Last season, national champion
Washington visited Stanford Stadium
before any students did. In 1990, it was
Oregon State which made an early-season
appearance on the Farm.
Early season home games diminish the

intangible home-field advantage that the
football team receives from the presence of
a student body. But according to Athletics
Department officials, they seem to be large
ly unavoidable.
Tom Beckett, associate director of the
Department of Athletics, said that for the
most part, the school itself has no say in its
own schedule. The Pacific 10 Conference
schedules each of the Cardinal's four annu
al conference home games.
"Actually, the Pac-10 already has our
schedule prepared up until the year 2004,
so our hands are tied," he explained.
Jim Muldoon, the Pac-10's associate direc
tor of scheduling, said that while the confer
ence attempts to accommodate Stanford's
wishes, this is often a next-to-impossible task.
"Each team is scheduled for eight Pac
-10 games each year, four home, four
away," Muldoon said. "We try to schedule
Stanford games at home while the students
are there, but it's very difficult."

Muldoon said that the other nine schools
in the conference operate on a semester
basis, making the coordination of their
schedules with Stanford's quite hopeless.
This year, for instance, Stanford's first day
of classes (Sept. 29) was at least two weeks
later than any other Pac-10 school.
The Cardinal, however, does have con
trol over its schedule outside the Pac-10.
Beckett said that the Athletics Department
"attempts to schedule its early [non-confer
ence] games on the road, then have later
non-conference games at home."
This, too, is often difficult to achieve.
This season's schedule didn't give Stanford
many choices for non-conference games;
the Pac-10 scheduled Stanford for confer
ence matches on each of the last seven Sat
urdays of the season.
As a result, both of the Cardinal's out
of-conference home games (Northwestern
and San Jose St.) occurred before the first
day of classes.

"With the San Jose St. game, we had to
host the game, and the date was the only
time available," Beckett said. The Spar
tans had time commitments themselves
within their own Big West Conference.
Stanford also includes one "off-date" in
its annual schedule. Historically, the Ath
letic Department tries to schedule this date
as early as possible. This year, Stanford
was off the week of Sept. 5, and in most
seasons, this off-week is scheduled before
students arrive.
Cardinal coaches agree that while it's a
disadvantage to play without students,
there's no real practical alternative. Defen
sive Backfield Coach Tom Holmoe said that
the problem is unavoidable.
"There's not much we can do," said Hol
moe. "If we catch our first games at home,
then we'll just have to deal with that. Actu
ally, the crowd was pretty good for the first
three home games, and it should get even
better now that the students are back."
