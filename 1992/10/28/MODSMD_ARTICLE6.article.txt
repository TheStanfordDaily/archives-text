## Students trade long lines for on-line at CPPC 
### Lenora Chu 
Despite a few bugs, Career Planning
and Placement Center workers say their
new computerized recruiting process is
helping eliminate long lines for job-hungry
students.
"There have been lots of technical prob
lems early on, but those problems are being
fixed," said senior Graham Spencer, who
was responsible for programming the on
line "CPPC Remote."
The service, which became available
earlier this month, allows students to use
any Apple Macintosh connected to SUNet
to find out which companies are coming to
recruit, retrieve employer contact informa
tion and review job requirements.
But too many students have been trying
to access the employer informat ion at once,
causing a backup in the system, CPPC Di
rector Ruth Schneider said. "It's been a lit
tle slow in operation, but that will get bet
ter."
Before the on-line program was avail
able, the staff matched students with em
ployers by hand, a job that called for "an in
credible amount of detail," Schneider

added. "All information had to be recorded
in an average of seven different places."
Another problem was the massive
crowds that congregated in the center.
Rachel Hahn, the center's recruiting coor
dinator, said traffic should be "significant
ly reduced" with the new on-line program.
"Students will no longer need to deal
with crowds and long lines. Recruiting can
be accessed in the dorms at any time," she
said.
Besides accessing information, the com
puterized system allows students to bid for
interviews. The system gives each student
1000 points a quarter to bid for a limited
number of interview slots.
The process makes recruiting "a fair
and equitable system for all," said Virginia
Mak, the CPPC's media coordinator. The
bidding system applies to all types of job in
terviews, and can now be handled through
CPPC Remote.
The CPPC requires that students at
tend an Orientation Workshop and pay a
$20 fee before taking advantage of the on
line service.
