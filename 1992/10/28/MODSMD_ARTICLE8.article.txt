## Police nab three suspects in string of thefts 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Stanford Police arrested three San Jose
men yesterday for a string of auto burglar
ies in the parking lots near the Oval, said
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The suspects were caught after a brief
chase by two officers, who had arrived only
moments before to begin taking informa
tion from victims.
The suspects "were not conversant with
the area and were a little slow in getting
away, so our guys got 'em," Niemeyer said.
Niemeyer said police have confirmed
that the suspects robbed two vehicles, and
estimate that as many as four more were
burglarized yesterday.
Items stolen included stereos, back
packs and luggage, Niemeyer said.
"It was definitely a good burglary," he
said. "They gained entry by breaking win

dows or punching holes in doors."
At about 3:30 p.m. yesterday, one victim
reported to police that his car had been bro
ken into, Niemeyer said. Police arrived at
the area near the intersection of Lasuen
Street and Campus Drive near the Gradu
ate School of Business shortly afterward to
take down descriptions of the suspects and
their vehicle.
A second person then came forward,
who gave police the suspects' license plate
number and told them he had seen the men
stealing items from one of the vehicles,
Niemeyer said.
The three men, who were still in the
area, attempted to flee via Palm Drive but
were caught by two officers, Deputy Art
Tiedemann and Deputy Ed Branscome, ac
cording to Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said he could not release the
suspects' names because police were still
processing the case.
