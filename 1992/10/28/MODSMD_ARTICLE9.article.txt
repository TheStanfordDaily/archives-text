# Battle for the budget
## Prop 165 creates questions, controversies 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Last summer, while the rest of Califor
nia watched in pain, state lawmakers in
Sacramento engaged in one of the longest,
bloodiest budget battles ever seen at the
State Capitol.
For 63 days past their constitutional
deadline — even as the state resorted to
lOUs to pay its bills for the first time since
the Depression — they waged a war of wills
and egos over how to close a $10.7 billion
gap in the state budget.

Gov. Pete Wilson called for deep spend
ing cuts and insisted taxes not be raised to
balance the budget. Democrats in the Leg
islature called the governor a "terrorist"
and blocked his efforts to cut public educa
tion and welfare programs.
When a truce was finally called, Wilson
had won the spending plan he wanted. But
the governor noted that the summer fiasco
was likely to replay itself in future years
unless something was done to fix two struc
tural problems: the size of the budget, and
the budgeting process itself.
The solution he has in mind is Proposi
tion 165, a measure that would grant the
governor sweeping new budget-making
powers and significantly reduce welfare

grants in California.
But winning won't be easy. The fight
over Prop. 165 has become one of the
fiercest in the state, with a small army of
high-profile interest groups lining up to de
nounce the measure as a Wilson "power
grab" that attempts to fix the state's mas
sive fiscal problems on the backs of its most
vulnerable residents.
"It concentrates power in a foolish way,"
said Trudy Schafer, legislative advocate for
the League of Women Voters of California.
"It's too much power in the hands of one
person without the people and the Legisla
ture having a say about the priorities."
Here, essentially, is what Prop. 165
would do:
• Allow the governor to cut spending in
numerous areas if a budget is not passed by
July 1 or if revenues during the year fall 3
percent below projections. The cuts could
be rescinded only by the Legislature pass
ing, and the governor signing, a new spend*
ing plan. The governor would not be able to
raise taxes or cut education funding.
• Eliminate pay for the governor and Leg
islature on each day after June 15 that the
state goes without a budget being enacted.
• Cut all welfare payments by 10 per
cent, and by an additional 15 percent once a
family has been on aid for six months.
Women becoming pregnant while on wel
fare would be denied additional benefits,
while teenage mothers would get an extra
$50 a month for staying in school.
• Institute new incentives rules to allow
working families on welfare to keep a larg
er portion of their part-time earnings.
