# Battle for the budget
## Prop 165 creates questions, controversies 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
Last summer, while the rest of Califor
nia watched in pain, state lawmakers in
Sacramento engaged in one of the longest,
bloodiest budget battles ever seen at the
State Capitol.
For 63 days past their constitutional
deadline — even as the state resorted to
lOUs to pay its bills for the first time since
the Depression — they waged a war of wills
and egos over how to close a $10.7 billion
gap in the state budget.

Gov. Pete Wilson called for deep spend
ing cuts and insisted taxes not be raised to
balance the budget. Democrats in the Leg
islature called the governor a "terrorist"
and blocked his efforts to cut public educa
tion and welfare programs.
When a truce was finally called, Wilson
had won the spending plan he wanted. But
the governor noted that the summer fiasco
was likely to replay itself in future years
unless something was done to fix two struc
tural problems: the size of the budget, and
the budgeting process itself.
The solution he has in mind is Proposi
tion 165, a measure that would grant the
governor sweeping new budget-making
powers and significantly reduce welfare

grants in California.
But winning won't be easy. The fight
over Prop. 165 has become one of the
fiercest in the state, with a small army of
high-profile interest groups lining up to de
nounce the measure as a Wilson "power
grab" that attempts to fix the state's mas
sive fiscal problems on the backs of its most
vulnerable residents.
"It concentrates power in a foolish way,"
said Trudy Schafer, legislative advocate for
the League of Women Voters of California.
"It's too much power in the hands of one
person without the people and the Legisla
ture having a say about the priorities."
Here, essentially, is what Prop. 165
would do:
• Allow the governor to cut spending in
numerous areas if a budget is not passed by
July 1 or if revenues during the year fall 3
percent below projections. The cuts could
be rescinded only by the Legislature pass
ing, and the governor signing, a new spend*
ing plan. The governor would not be able to
raise taxes or cut education funding.
• Eliminate pay for the governor and Leg
islature on each day after June 15 that the
state goes without a budget being enacted.
• Cut all welfare payments by 10 per
cent, and by an additional 15 percent once a
family has been on aid for six months.
Women becoming pregnant while on wel
fare would be denied additional benefits,
while teenage mothers would get an extra
$50 a month for staying in school.
• Institute new incentives rules to allow
working families on welfare to keep a larg
er portion of their part-time earnings.
Supporters of Wilson's measure — al
most exclusively taxpayers' groups — say

the budget-powers provisions in
Prop. 165 would give the governor
the necessary powers to prevent an
extended impasse like that of last
summer.
"We've had gridlock and deficit
spending in California year after
year under the current system,"
said Ron Roach, spokesman for the
California Taxpayers Association.
"The governors of most other
states have more authority than
California's governor to deal with
fiscal emergencies — such as being
able to reduce spending when you
don't have any money to spend."
But the lobbies arrayed against
the measure — including Califor
nia Common Cause, the League of
Women Voters and the California
State Employees Association —
argue that Wilson is attempting to
undermine the democratic process
by altering the balance of power in
the budget process. They say Prop.
165 would give California's gover
nor budget powers greater than
those of any other in the country.
"Regardless of who the gover
nor is, to have this kind of power,
we're talking about leading to a
dictatorship," said Harold Boyd,
legislative advocate for the Califor
nia Teachers Association, another
of the measure's opponents.
Critics add that the governor
already has more power than many
other governors because passing a
budget in California requires a
two-thirds vote of the Legislature
instead of a simple majority.

But the more
difficult part of
the measure for
many voters will
be its welfare pro
visions. About
2.4 million Cali
fornians are on
Aid to Families
with Dependent

Children. And on Wilson
the surface, everyone seems to
agree that the system needs
reforming.
"Right now, the system penal
izes the working poor," said
Thomas MaCurdy, a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution whose
studies include welfare policy.
"There are no incentives in the pro
gram to work. There are huge dis
incentives to work, unless you work
so much you get off the program."
Currently, after small allowances
for expenses, every dollar earned
through work cuts a dollar from a
person's monthly welfare grant.
But not everyone agrees about how
to create a better incentive struc
ture.
Prop. 165 proponents argue that
cutting benefits by up to 25 percent
is justified by allowing welfare
recipients to make up the difference
by keeping more of the money they
make through work. The measure
would allow recipients to keep the
first $30 of their monthly earnings
and one-third of any additional
earnings without a cut in benefits.
"It will only take a couple of
shifts a week to ensure that a fam
ily experiences no change in its
standard of living" as a result of
the benefits cut, said Amy Albright,
spokeswoman for the Yes on 165

committee. Albright said the aver
age welfare recipient would have to
work just over six hours a week to
make up the difference.
Supporters also argue that Cal
ifornia's welfare payments are
now among the nation's highest,
that the state's welfare caseload is
growing too quickly for its tax
base, and that, with California's
business and income taxes already
being so high, the only way to get
the budget under control is to
clamp down on ballooning spend
ing programs like welfare.
"California is becoming the wel
fare state," said Roach of the Cali
fornia Taxpayers Association.
"Spending per capita on welfare is
far above the national average, and
the system is rife with abuse and
fraud. [Prop. 1651 seeks to encour
age people to get jobs and break
the cycle of dependency."
The state's legislative analyst
has estimated that the benefits
reductions in Prop. 165 would save
the state $680 million a year — out
of a total general fund budget of
$57 billion.
Opponents say that's not much,
and that California already is only
average in its support for the poor
when housing subsidies provided
by other states are accounted for.
"The total California payments
now leave families 20 percent below
the poverty line, and some states
leave them 50 percent below," said
Law Prof. Michael Wald, who
authored a study criticizing the
measure. "To say we're leaving peo
ple incredibly poor instead of
tremendously poor doesn't strike
me as a very persuasive argument."
Wald and other critics say Prop.

165 will plunge welfare families
deeper into poverty and create
more homelessness because jobs
are so difficult to come by in a reces
sion, many recipients lack the skills
and experience needed to get a job,
and the measure has no provisions
to improve access to child care.
"Even if a mother could find
part-time work to help earn back
what she's losing, most if not all of
what she earns would go into child
care — if she can find it," said
Patricia Whitney-Wise, executive
director of the California Council of
Churches. A parent would have to
work much more than six hours a
week to pay for child care, she said.
Wald said children would be
hurt the most by Prop. 165
because many working welfare
parents would have to leave their
children without adequate child
care, and the benefits cuts would
force many families to move into
unstable living situations.
And while Prop. 165 claims to
break down the "cycle of depen
dency" of welfare recipients, Wald
said there is no such cycle for up to
60 percent of AFDC recipients,
who leave the system within a
year. Those who stay on longer
have more serious problems — like
limited education — that the mea
sure doesn't even address, he said.
A Los Angeles Times poll
released yesterday found CalLfor
nians evenly divided over Prop.
165, with 42 percent of those
polled intending to support it, 43
percent opposed to it and 15 per
cent undecided. Republicans back
the measure by a 2-to-l margin
while Democrats oppose it by the
same ratio, The Times reported.
