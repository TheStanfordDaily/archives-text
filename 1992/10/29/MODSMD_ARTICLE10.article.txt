# Staff member and wife plea not guilty to abuse charges
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Daniel Blomquist, a former accountant in the
Controller's Office, and his wife Ethel have
pleaded not guilty to charges including torture
and child endangerment.
The couple is also accused of two counts of
corporal injury to a child, according to Santa
Clara County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia
Sevely. They entered their plea in Superior
Court Monday.
The Blomquists were arrested this summer
after their 10-year-old son became gravely ill and
paramedics were summoned to the Blomquist
home.
The child appeared malnourished and had
severe bruises on his buttocks, the police report
said. According to testimony in the preliminary
hearing, he was repeatedly spanked with a wood
en spoon and forced to eat his own vomit.
This is "the second time in our county" that a
torture charge has been used in a child abuse
case, Sevely said, testing a new law approved by
California voters in June 1990.
The law defines torture as "causing cruel and
extreme pain and suffering for the purpose of
revenge, extortion, persuasion" and inflicting
great bodily injury for "sadistic" purposes.
Because the Blomquists allegedly used the
beatings to force their son to eat his vomit, Seve
ly said she believes the charge is justified.
In the other case, a San Jose couple is await
ing trial for allegedly punishing their 3-year-old
daughter by whipping her with a switch and

scalding her.
Deputy Public Defender Jeffrey Kroeber, who
is representing Ethel Blomquist, said the trial is
set for Nov. 23, but he added that he will "prob
ably file a motion for a continuance" because of
the complexity of the case.
Three of the charges carry two-, four- or six
year prison or county jail sentences, Kroeber
said. The torture charge is punishable by life
imprisonment with the possibility of parole.
Ethel Blomquist is free on a $200,000 bond
while Daniel Blomquist remains in jail in lieu of
$500,000 bail, said Kroeber, who declined to
comment on any specifics about the case or the
defense.
Daniel Blomquist resigned in early August
from his position as an assistant manager in the
Controller's Office, according to Marjorie Cald
well, secretary to the Controller.
After his arrest, Daniel Blomquist reportedly
told police he was "given authority by God" to
spank his son. "We are to discipline our children.
[Our son] was not willing to accept that he was
wrong," said Blomquist, according to the police
report.
The boy was provided with one quart of
unprocessed raw milk, three eggs and some
"food supplements" each day, the report said,
leaving him "very malnourished."
Three of the Blomquists' children are cur
rently in foster care, Sevely said, while the
fourth — a 19-year-old — is living with Ethel
Blomquist.
