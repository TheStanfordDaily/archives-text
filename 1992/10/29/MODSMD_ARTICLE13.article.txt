Politicians play endgame
Bill Clinton alternately poked and praised Ross
Perot yesterday, hoping to siphon off support in a
race for the White House growing closer by the day.
Clinton's lead has shrunk in recent days as
Perot has gained in the polls and traditional
Republicans have reconsidered their opposition to
President Bush.
In an appearance on NBC's "Today" show,
Clinton said Perot's recent claims, including one
that Republican operatives planned to disrupt his
daughter's wedding had "called his temperament
into question in many quarters."
But shortly after, he told a call-in questioner that
if he wins the election he would like to have Perot's
advice "on the issues that he cares and knows
about." He referred specifically to prisoners of war
missing in Southeast Asia and steps to reduce the
deficit and control government spending.
Clinton's campaign supplemented his com
ments by announcing that 122 former Perot sup
porters, including nine previous statewide coordi
nators, were endorsing the Democratic ticket.
Also on the campaign trail yesterday, Bush crit
icized what he said was overly negative media cov
erage about the economy, assailed the "voices of
doom and gloom" who predict his demise, and said,
"Believe me, we are going to win this election."
Pointing to news of 2.7 percent economic
growth in the July-September quarter, Bush and
Vice President Dan Quayle said over and over that
the nation was no longer in a recession, and is
poised for a strong recovery.

Meanwhile, federal campaign reports showed
Perot dropping $ 1 million a day on his independent
bid over the past 10 days. He arranged an appear
ance last night in Colorado, where a poll showed
him challenging Bush for second place, and aides
said he would campaign in Florida, Missouri, Cali
fornia and Texas before Election Day.
Is the recovery real?
NEW YORK (AP) — One day the government
says the economy is robust again because con
sumer spending has improved. The next day it says
consumer spending actually isn't so strong.
Is the economy recovering or not?
Taken together, the jumble of other government
statistics on the economy are open to just about
any spin that economists or politicians wish to put
on them.
President Bush's re-election campaign called a
report of a 2.7 percent growth rate in the third
quarter, which was double the expected pace, "very
good news" and said it proves his economic stew
ardship hasn't been so bad after all.
Indeed, Bush's presidency can claim average
annual growth of 0.8 percent. Growth has been
consistent, but slow.
While that may look positive, private economists
say to look at the fine print and the footnotes.
The nation's savings rate fell to 4.5 percent of dis
posable income from 5.3 percent in the second quar
ter. That means whatever increase in spending there
was came largely out of people's savings, and not
because they're necessarily making more money.
