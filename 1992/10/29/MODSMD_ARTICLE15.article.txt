# ANC: A war in South Africa
## 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) — War has erupted in
Natal province and "no amount of
talk" between the African Nation
al Congress and Inkatha Freedom
Party leaders will stop it, a top
ANC official said yesterday.
An Inkatha leader, meanwhile,
claimed the ANC had declared
war against his group and sent its
fighters to commit mass killings.
The charges follow a series of
attacks and ambushes in Natal
that have killed dozens of people
and raised tension dramatically in
the eastern province.
More than 12,000 blacks have
died in nationwide violence since
1984, and more than 50 have been
killed in Natal in the past week.
Reggie Hadebe, the ANC's No. 2
official in Natal, was shot to death
Tuesday as he was going to a meet
ing of a committee formed to halt
violence. The government offered a
$8,500 reward yesterday for infor
mation leading to his killers.
Deputy Law and Order Minis
ter Gert Myburgh, who visited

Natal and announced the reward,
urged leaders of the ANC and
Inkatha to hold peace talks.
Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize, also urged the sides
to talk.
But Harry Gwala, a member of
the ANC's governing national
executive from Natal, rejected a
meeting between ANC leader Nel
son Mandela and Inkatha leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi as useless.
"No amount of talk between
Mandela and Buthelezi can bring
an end to violence," he said. "We
have war taking place."
Another ANC official said
Hadebe was on an Inkatha hit list
of ANC leaders to be killed. Inkatha
denied the accusation.
"The ANC has declared war on
(Inkatha)," said Ben Ngubane, a
member of Inkatha's central com
mittee. "Its.. . cadres are murder
ing our people in mass killings."
Police in the KwaZulu black
homeland, Inkatha's stronghold
and the site of a Saturday night

massacre of 20 people, offered up
to $28,000 for information lead
ing to conviction of those killers.
Mandela said Tuesday he sup
ported a peace summit involving
all major political groups, includ
ing the white government and
Buthelezi. Such a meeting would
bring the major political groups
together for the first time since
talks on constitutional reforms
broke down in May.
But the ANC has continually
rejected a bilateral meeting with
Inkatha.
Buthelezi is angry at Mandela
and President F.W. de Klerk for
agreeing last month to ban tribal
weapons at political rallies. The
ban was aimed at Inkatha's main
ly Zulu supporters, who carry
spears and clubs at marches.
The government blames the
violence on an ANC-Inkatha
power struggle. The ANC blames
the government, saying police and
soldiers are biased in favor of
Inkatha and instigate attacks on
ANC members.
