EP OKs free trade zone
STRASBOURG, France (AP) - By a 351-16
vote, the European Parliament gave a vital go
ahead yesterday for the opening of the world's
largest single market by next year.
Deputies said the accord envisions free move
ment of people, goods, services and capital by Jan.
1 in an area containing 380 million consumers
accounting for 46 percent of world trade.
The European Economic Area created would
join the European Community's 12 member states
with the seven countries comprising the European
Free Trade Association, creating a single trade
zone. The deal took four years to negotiate.
British deputy Gary Titley called the vote "a
major political watershed that ends the historic
division in Western Europe."
The pact also establishes joint efforts relating to
consumer protection, the environment, research and
development and other areas.
The accord must be ratified by national parlia
ments of all 19 countries. The European Parliament,
whose approval was also required, is composed of
members elected directly from all EC member states.
Danish deputy Marie Jepsen said she expected all
the parliaments to easily approve the accord.
Italian fascists hail II Duce
ROME (AP) — Alessandra Mussolini dared
Italians to join her in tribute to her dictator
grandfather on yesterday's 70th anniversary of
his black-shirted followers' march on Rome.
About 1,000 neo-fascist sympathizers rallied in
Naples, home district of the 29-year-old Parlia
ment member, to hear her speak, the news agen
cy ANSA said. About 300 police were on hand.
The anniversary of the march that brought
Benito Mussolini to power comes amid similar
conditions today — strikes, protests and a rapidly
swelling upstart political movement challenging
Italy's dominant parties.
"Just as 70 years ago Italy was illuminated by
the revolutionary thought of my grandfather, so
have we been pushed by the same ideal of restor
ing the pride and splendor of the past to Italy,"
ANSA quoted Ms. Mussolini as saying.
Two weeks ago, she led 50,000 neo-fascist sup
porters in a march through Rome. Her followers

were protesting widespread political corruption in
a kickback scandal involving the major govern
ment parties and the Communists, Italy's largest
opposition party.
Keating trial begins
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Charles Keating Jr.'s
federal fraud and racketeering trial opened yes
terday with a court clerk reading aloud more than
an hour's worth of charges against the former
owner of collapsed Lincoln Savings & Loan.
Several of 116 prospective jurors at a morning
session appeared to doze as excerpts from the 73-
count indictment against Keating were read.
U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer ordered
the review to impress the potential jurors with
the gravity of the case against Keating. Question
ing of jury candidates and opening statements in
the trial aren't expected until next week.
Keating is accused of devising a fraud that
bankrolled huge salaries and jet-set perks for his
family and business associates while bilking buyers
of worthless securities. Taxpayers were stuck with a
$2.6 billion bill when Irvine-based Lincoln collapsed.
He faces up to 525 years in prison if convicted
of all charges.
Sing, Weenie, sing!
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — A campus crooner
had something to sing about yesterday after a
judge dismissed charges that his al fresco concerts
were a breach of the peace.
Rick Starr, 46, was in court to face a charge of
disturbing the peace.
Thomas Ventresco, administrator at UC-
Berkeley, filed a complaint that Starr's serenades
were striking a sour note. The stress of working
50 yards from Starr's off-key concerts "is causing
me to lose sleep at night," he said.
Starr, who contended he was protected by the
First Amendment, faced a possible sentence of 90
days or a $400 fine.
After prosecutors declined to take the case to
trial, Judge Julie Conger dismissed the charge
and Starr was free to go on his way singing.
He didn't waste time, treating a news confer
ence to "I Will Wait for You," from the movie
"Umbrellas of Cherbourg."

the gravity of the case against Keating. Question
ing of jury candidates and opening statements in
the trial aren't expected until next week.
Keating is accused of devising a fraud that
bankrolled huge salaries and jet-set perks for his
family and business associates while bilking buyers
of worthless securities. Taxpayers were stuck with a
$2.6 billion bill when Irvine-based Lincoln collapsed.
He faces up to 525 years in prison if convicted
of all charges.
Sing, Weenie, sing!
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — A campus crooner
had something to sing about yesterday after a
judge dismissed charges that his al fresco concerts
were a breach of the peace.
Rick Starr, 46, was in court to face a charge of
disturbing the peace.
Thomas Ventresco, administrator at UC-
Berkeley, filed a complaint that Starr's serenades
were striking a sour note. The stress of working
50 yards from Starr's off-key concerts "is causing
me to lose sleep at night," he said.
Starr, who contended he was protected by the
First Amendment, faced a possible sentence of 90
days or a $400 fine.
After prosecutors declined to take the case to
trial, Judge Julie Conger dismissed the charge
and Starr was free to go on his way singing.
He didn't waste time, treating a news confer
ence to "I Will Wait for You," from the movie
"Umbrellas of Cherbourg."
