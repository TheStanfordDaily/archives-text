## Morgan, a safe bet 
### 
INCUMBENTS. THEY'RE BAD,
bad. That's the message voters
are getting this year, and it's
coming from disparate sources from
George Bush to the media.
In the 11th district race for state
senator, however, sticking with the
tried and true — Becky Morgan — is
the wise choice. Morgan, a state sen
ator since 1984, has been active on
several Senate committees during
her tenure. She founded and has
served as chair of a committee on
child care and development.
Her attention to issues and her
progressive stances on a number of
social issues — support of basic
health care, a ban on assault guns
and the Clean Air Act — earned her
over 60 percent of the 1988 vote in a
district with more registered
Democrats than Republicans.
With both candidates espousing
similar moderate proposals, the
biggest issue in this race has
turned out be education. Tinkle

has criticized Morgan for her sup
port of Gov. Pete Wilson's recent
cuts in educational spending. How
ever, Morgan's support of Wilson
was motivated by the slow passing
of the State's budget for the new
fiscal year, and does not indicate an
indifference to education.
Indeed, Morgan has a record of
supporting improvements in educa
tion, authoring and strongly advo
cating a number of proposed bills.
Trinkle's own plans, on the
other hand, are neither new nor
innovative. He suggests more
financial aid through grants paid
for by military service, a plan that
sounds suspiciously like the cur
rent ROTC program available to
students.
Other priorities of Trinkle's,
such as a commitment to zero pop
ulation growth, seem a bit odd at
best.
In this particular race, its best to
go with someone you can count on.
