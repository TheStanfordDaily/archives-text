# Sher's committed
## 
### 
Sometimes, choosing
which candidate to vote for is
a hard decision. And in other
instances, such as in the 21st dis
trict race for state assembly, it's
pitifully easy
Voters can pick either a legisla
tor committed to the environment
or an inexperienced candidate who
takes a dangerous stand on that
issue and others as well.
In previous state assembly terms,
Democrat Byron Sher has been a
champion of the environment,
authoring a number of bills designed
to protect California's water, air and
forests. He has worked on every
thing from strengthening timber
regulations to preventing toxic con
tamination.
Sher, however, isn't one-dimen
sional. He has indicated that in his
next term he will focus on restor
ing funding for California's public
school system. Sher's strong envi

ronmental record indicates that he
will push hard to regain money for
public schools.
Jan LaFetra, the republican can
didate, has said that although she
agrees with Sher on many issues, the
state can't "afford him" any more.
And while the state must be
tight with its budget, LaFetra's
zeal for spending restraints may
come at the expense of the poor and
the environment. LaFetra supports
Proposition 165, a measure that
would save the state money, but
place welfare recipients into unac
ceptable poverty levels.
LaFetra has also displayed an
anti-environmental stance, criti
cizing Sher's Waste Management
Act and suggesting continued use
of landfills as an alternative.
That is not the kind of alterna
tive the environment can take.
And LaFetra isn't the kind of alter
native voters should take, either.
