# Fac Sen to vote today on domestic partner benefits
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
A bill extending University
benefits, including health insur
ance, to the unmarried "domestic
partners" of staff and faculty is
likely to be passed by the Faculty
Senate today, several members
said.
However, they expect there to
be some reservations about the
possible costs of the proposal, as
well as concern over its effect on
the University's image with alum
ni and the public.
"You can't just assume the Uni
versity is going to magically pay for
it," said Chemistry Prof. Steven
Boxer. "They'll pay for it by raising
the cost of something else."
But he added that he still ex
pects the senate's decision to be
made as a "matter of principle."
The measure the senate will
consider today was unanimously
recommended by one of its sub
committees in a report completed
in June. It proposes that both
same-sex and opposite-sex unmar
ried couples be provided with Uni
versity benefits that include ath
letic privileges, library privileges
and medical care.
When the University approved
a similar measure for students two
years ago, it provoked criticism
from some alumni.
But Political Science Prof.

Terry Karl said the subcommit
tee's extensive, 61-page report
should sway many senators.
"It's a unanimous recommen
dation from a committee that has
spent a very long time, and a very
thoughtful time, considering this

issue," she said, adding that in her
experience in the senate, when a
committee makes such a "strong
recommendation," its proposal is
almost always accepted.
