# Fac Sen to vote today on domestic partner benefits
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
A bill extending University
benefits, including health insur
ance, to the unmarried "domestic
partners" of staff and faculty is
likely to be passed by the Faculty
Senate today, several members
said.
However, they expect there to
be some reservations about the
possible costs of the proposal, as
well as concern over its effect on
the University's image with alum
ni and the public.
"You can't just assume the Uni
versity is going to magically pay for
it," said Chemistry Prof. Steven
Boxer. "They'll pay for it by raising
the cost of something else."
But he added that he still ex
pects the senate's decision to be
made as a "matter of principle."
The measure the senate will
consider today was unanimously
recommended by one of its sub
committees in a report completed
in June. It proposes that both
same-sex and opposite-sex unmar
ried couples be provided with Uni
versity benefits that include ath
letic privileges, library privileges
and medical care.
When the University approved
a similar measure for students two
years ago, it provoked criticism
from some alumni.
But Political Science Prof.

Terry Karl said the subcommit
tee's extensive, 61-page report
should sway many senators.
"It's a unanimous recommen
dation from a committee that has
spent a very long time, and a very
thoughtful time, considering this

issue," she said, adding that in her
experience in the senate, when a
committee makes such a "strong
recommendation," its proposal is
almost always accepted.
The Medical School Faculty
Senate endorsed the proposal in
September by a 22-3 vote. In addi
tion, more than 200 faculty mem
bers, including several members of
the Faculty Senate, have signed a
petition supporting the initiative.
The senate's role in the issue,
however, is only advisory. The
final decision on extending bene
fits will be made by University
President Gerhard Casper and the
Board of Trustees.
That lack of real power led some
members of the senate to question
whether the body should even be
involved in the issue yesterday.
"We're just cheerleaders on this
one," said Statistics Prof. Bradley
Efron. "It's a pressure tactic on

our administration and our admin
istration doesn't need any more
pressure tactics put on it."
Efron, who said he might sup
port the proposal if he were an
administrator, intends to vote
against it because he disapproves
of the way it is being handled by
the senate.
Because the senate has no real
authority in determining how the
proposal will be paid for, he said it is
being asked only to say whether it is
a "good thing" rather than to deter
mine its total costs and benefits.
"The Faculty Senate was never
intended to be the moral conscience
of the faculty, and it certainly
wasn't intended to be a lobbying
group," Efron said. "I guess I'd just
feel more comfortable if we were
talking about educational issues."
Others, however, argued that it
is essential that Casper and the
trustees receive the faculty's input

on the issue.
"I tend to see the Faculty Sen
ate as a sounding board for faculty
opinion on a whole range of issues
in the University," said English
Prof. Albert Gelpi. "I would think
the administration would want
some indication of what faculty
opinion is on the issue."
The proposal to extend dbmes
tic partner benefits to faculty and
staff was first made in spring 1991,
but the senate postponed discus
sion on the issue, seeking further
study. University President Don
ald Kennedy then appointed the
Subcommittee on Domestic Part
ners' Benefits to examine the issue
— especially its costs — more fully.
A few senators said that
although the subcommittee had
studied the issue thoroughly and
estimated how much the proposal
might cost, they remain uncon
vinced that the subcommittee's

estimates are the final word.
"There are some pretty big mar
gins of error in those numbers,"
said Economics Prof. John
Shoven. "There is still a lot of
uncertainty."
The subcommittee estimated
that 40 to 60 employees would
enroll in the program for same-sex
partners, costing the University
$30,000 to $60,000 per year. That
figure would rise to $70,000 to
$140,000 if 90 to 135 opposite-sex
partners are included.
The subcommittee said those
figures represent a "relatively triv
ial" portion — 0.0015 to 0.05 per
cent — of the University's $24 mil
lion budget for medical benefits.
The group also produced a
worst-case scenario using pes
simistic cost estimates, based
mainly on a possible rise in HlV
related illnesses. For same-sex
partners, the subcommittee esti

mated, the worst-case total health
cost could range from $150,000 to
$230,000. When opposite-sex part
ners are included, the worst-case
total health cost could range from
$220,000 to $325,000.
If those costs were passed on to
employees rather than the Uni
versity, premiums would increase
by amounts ranging from $1 a
month for 40 same-sex partners to
$1.85 a month for 135 opposite
sex partners, the subcommittee
estimated.
The subcommittee recommend
ed that if cost considerations pre
clude extending benefits to both
same-sex and opposite-sex part
ners, the senate should give priori
ty to same-sex partners.
"The subcommittee is unani
mous in the view that the case for
extending benefits to heterosexual
partners is weaker than for gay
and lesbian partners," the report

said. "Unmarried heterosexual
partners have the option to marry
if they wish, thereby securing
whatever benefits are available to
marital partners. Gays and les
bians do not."
Several senators said yester
day, however, that it is unlikely
the senate would consider extend
ing benefits only to same-sex part
ners.
The chances are "about zero,"
Efron said. "That would mean
that in the whole University, the
only group not getting the bene
fits would be the heterosexual
partners of staff and faculty, and
that doesn't seem very likely to
me."
Beyond the immediate costs,
extending domestic partner bene
fits may "at least in the short-run,
.. . adversely affect alumni sup
port," the subcommittee's report
said.
