## All Saintsâ€™ in the middle 
### 
Decisions, decisions, with
Halloween on Saturday and Elec
tion Day on Tuesday, you're stuck
somewhere in between, walking down
Irony Lane to the low-lit house at the end
of the street. Like the rest of the country
you want the truth, to the point where
maybe it's not such a good idea to put on
a mask, even for this one night.
Trick or treat? Ding dong. Your
favorite stuffed animal opens the door
wide, and just as you did for so many
years, you opt for the treat.
Too bad. From the bottom of the
huge salad bowl you pull a handful of
candies flavored with the candidates and
all their tricks. Shiny little wrappers
with smiling faces on the outside; lies,
failures and empty promises on the
inside. You scream at Fuzzy for pulling a
trick of his own, but Fuzzy can't hear.
Can anyone hear these days? Is anyone
listening?
Don't worry, I also want to make an
escape Saturday night. Slam the door on
Fuzzy, throw your candies into the night
and meet me at my place. We'll dress in
cellophane bunny suits and old pilot gog
gles, and rollerblade up and down El
Camino all night long and into Sunday
morning. At dawn we find ourselves in a
pool hall in Redwood City.
We run the table in front of a crowd of
regulars, we're too good to get beat up for
our costumes, and at sunrise the owner is

flowing free beers in celebration of All
Saints' Day. . . .
Unless you really want to, you and I
will not make a ridiculous escape this
Saturday night. We may not even dress
up on our own. But we will be here Sun
day and Tuesday, I hope.
As is the case every four years, All
Saints' Day will come right after Hal
loween, and right before election day.
Sunday will mark the feast of the Roman
Catholic and Anglican churches as they
celebrate the known and unknown saints
of God.
This year, however, the sequence is
eerie, by virtue of the recent political
maneuvers of Sinead O'Connor and the
presidential candidates.
Regardless of religion, we all must
consider O'Connor's recent claim that
the Roman Catholic church is responsible
for child abuse in the Western hemi
sphere. In view of Sunday, the timing of
this claim seems to be quite intentional.
The pitfall of O'Connor's statement is
that it creates an abstract scapegoat for
the horror at the root of many families.
But its personal honesty, matched by
previous incidents and claims of a similar
nature, has successfully provoked the
western world into a rage of controversial
discourse. Discourse which challenges
the disguise that is just as much a part of
Tuesday as Saturday.
In view of Tuesday, her claim is a slap

in the face to the one-sided discourse
between candidates and voters: It spot
lights even more the dishonesty that the
country has had to swallow in this cam
paign. From the Roman Catholic church
down to the Madison Square Garden
audience, we chastise an artist for self
expression (a lot more bold than Madon
na), but with our very own leaders, we
seem accustomed to the lies and cos
tumes.
How do we reconcile the two
extremes? How do we find our way
between one who is booed off stage for
daring to speak what she feels (whether
appropriate or absurd), and one who
will either regain or usurp office after
daring to hide what he has done or not
done?
The microphone will come to few, but
the chance to awaken has come to all.
You're hardly at public risk with the
audience of peers and family. The only
risk is not waking us out of our particular
corners of slumber.
