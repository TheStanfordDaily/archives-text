Intentionally offensive or not, the Tomahawk Chop is foul

AS A RESIDENT OF ATLANTA
for 20 years, I am naturally (or
unnaturally) a Braves fan. The
fact that I am also Native American
obviously brings up mixed feelings on
the issue of mascots and the Tomahawk
Chop.
I have never considered myself an
activist; however, I cannot imagine that
anyone who read David Schwartz's col
umn on "Don't stop Chop" would not
react negatively.
Simply put, the article was illogical
and unsympathetic with regards to the
feelings of Native Americans. I was per
sonally hurt to hear him describe our
movement as "annoying. .. petty ... a
giant nuisance . . . foolishness." In addi
tion, his insinuation that Glavine's rest

period is more important than the issues
of an entire race only further demon
strates his insensitivity.
Several topics constantly arise when
this issue is discussed. First, some peo
ple (Native Americans included) view
mascots as flattering gestures when
done in good taste. It is honorable to
have a race viewed as a strong figure
that can "lead" a team to victory. How
ever, one must wonder about this when
other teams use tigers and blue jays as
their mascots. I don't appreciate having
my culture compared to cats and birds.
Secondly, his argument that "when
people do the Tomahawk chop, the last
thing they are thinking about is, 'I'm
pretending now to be an Indian warrior
so I'll take out my axe and chant,'" is

valid for the most part (although with
enough Ice Cold Bud, I'm sure anything
is possible). But this is simply a result of
cultural ignorance. Are we content with
keeping these people uneducated? I can't
imagine that.
He asked the question, "If these peo
ple could somehow get the team names
changed, what would be accomplished?"
While I think his ignorance keeps this
answer from him, I also wonder if some
people asked in the 1800s, "If these peo
ple could some how abolish slavery,
what would be accomplished?"
I'm not here to solve the issue of
mascots and chants, but I do want to
voice my utter disgust at the high-and
mighty attitude that Schwartz takes in
his column. He seems to suggest that

Native American issues are still not
important. If he is so withdrawn from
society to be unaware that this is not the
case, I suggest that he spend less time
watching baseball and seriously get a
clue.
Maybe a majority of his ancestors
were not slaughtered like mine were. Or
possibly he is too ashamed of his her
itage to care about it. I happen to be
extremely proud of my heritage and I
refuse to let him diminish its meaning in
front of me.
I feel that the only reassuring fact
that comes from all of this is that most
people reading his column know that it
is bogus.
