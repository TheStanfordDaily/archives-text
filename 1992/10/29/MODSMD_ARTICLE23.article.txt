# How can we be sure that Huening's the best choice
## 
### 
Maybe Tom Huening is the best can
didate for the Congressional seat vacat
ed by Tom Campbell. There are probably
some great reasons why many will vote
for him.
Unfortunately, yesterday's Daily
endorsement listed none of those rea
sons. Instead, it chose to raffle off a
number of weak excuses to vote for him.
Everyone wants to see the deficit cut,
and almost everyone knows doing it will
require sacrifice by most Americans. So
what does The Daily point out as a first
step in Huening's proposal? A one billion
dollar cut in the Congressional operating
budget. That will go a long way toward
cutting a $250 billion deficit by $50 bil
lion.
Huening may have outlined other
ways of cutting the deficit, but none
were cited.
The editorial also praises the "Omaha

Summit." If Huening is organizing this
conference, why is he putting it in
Omaha? I'd bet the other 150 candidates
that he mentions in his ad, who are sup
posed to attend the conference, are also
telling voters they are organizing this
conference. Great politics, little sub
stance.
Meanwhile, The Daily did not say
that Huening supports a balanced bud
get amendment, something that would
require either huge spending cuts or
massive new taxes if implemented over
the next five years. That is a courageous
position to take, particularly if he has
provided specifics.
Finally, The Daily editorial says he is
not as ideologically driven as Anna
Eshoo. The only evidence in the editorial
that he is not ideologically driven is that
he is pro-choice and supports cutting
defense. A majority of people who call
themselves Republicans are pro-choice,
just ask Tom Campbell. He'd be crazy to
run in this district and not support
defense cuts.
Meanwhile, no examples of Anna

Eshoo being captive to left-wing inter
ests were provided. If Huening wins, I
hope it will be because voters like the
substance of his campaign more than
they liked Anna Eshoo's.
Unfortunately, Stanford voters will
have to find those details from sources
other than The Daily's endorsements.
