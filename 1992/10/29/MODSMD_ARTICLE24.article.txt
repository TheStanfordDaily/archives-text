# Idealism is only useful when grounded in truth
## 
### 
I am responding to the Daily editorial
of Oct. 23 entitled "Express Yourselves."
The arguments presented show very
clearly the degree to which "political
coercion" has become a way of life in the
Stanford community. I believe that the
faculty and administration bear much of
the responsibility for this situation.
However, my primary disagreement
with the editorial in question is that it
relies on a false premise. The idea that

universities "regularly instigate impor
tant political and social change" is sim
ply not true. History has shown that
schools do not lead society — they are
led.
The civil rights movement was start
ed by ordinary citizens in communities
like Birmingham, Ala. — not by intel
lectuals on college campuses.
In 1968, during the Apollo space mis
sions to the moon, the picture of our
small blue planet floating in a sea of
darkness was broadcast all over the
world. This single event, in my opinion,
did more to turn people into environ
mentalists than any book written by a
college professor.
I do not believe that it is bad to be
idealistic, but idealism must be ground
ed in truth. Otherwise, the points being
made in The Daily's editorials will con
tinue to ring pitifully hollow; and the
actions taken based on idealism are like
ly to do more harm than good.
