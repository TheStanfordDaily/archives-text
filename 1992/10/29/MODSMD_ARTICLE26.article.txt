## Ace defender Stephan fights curse Sophomore wards off opponents, injuries 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Sophomore Jen Stephan
hasn't followed the route many
players take to land a spot in a
major college program. You'd
expect a midfielder for the No. 2
Cardinal squad to have logged
years of experience in the sport.
But Stephan didn't start play
ing seriously until her sophomore
year of high school. She did try
the sport once when she was six,
but dropped it four years later,
partly because her coach told her
that she had no future.
"I just decided to concentrate
on other sports because I wasn't
enjoying it," she said. "I would
hate going to practices because he
always said, 'You're too slow.
You're so bad.' So I quit."

If she makes a
mistake, she doesn't
wallow in self-pity but
jumps back into
battle to clean up the
mess.'

Not only was Stephan turned
off by her coach's attitude, but
she also was disgusted with the
politicking of overbearing parents
and coaches who crushed young
players with weighty expecta
tions.
"(Some parents] start in sev
lth and eighth grade, calling up
Olympic development coaches
and saying, 'Come look at my
kid,'" she said.
"And it causes a lot of distress,
even between friends. It's like,
'Oh, gosh, you're dad is doing this
and thinks you're so great but
you're really not. I'm actually bet
ter than you.'"
So Stephan concentrated on
Softball, volleyball and basketball
until she haphazardly picked up
soccer again in ninth grade.
But she still did not begin play
ing year-round until her junior
year, when she joined a south
Texas club squad and started to
think about playing in college.
After Stephan had put in only
two years of intense soccer, some
may have questioned whether her
skills were of college caliber. But
she has proven at Stanford that
her short exposure to the sport
shouldn't be a mark against her.
In fact, she considers it just the

opposite.
"I still feel really new to soc
cer," Stephan said. "I still have so
much enthusiasm for it and right
now I can't see myself ever get
ting sick of it."
She has been particularly
pleased with her game this sea
son, making the jump to a start
ing position. And she usually fin
ishes the game, with only an occa
sional breather during the 90
minutes of action.
Playing nearly a full game is no
small feat considering Stephan is
responsible for covering from end
line to endline. Not only does she
take care of throw-in and corner
kick duties, but she also marks
opposing attackers, distributes
the ball from fullbacks to for
wards and supports the forwards
on scoring opportunities.
This year, Stephan is focusing
on offensive play, particularly fin
ishing off scoring opportunities.
Although she has improved her
crossing passes and is more
aggressive when pushing the ball
upfield, scoring goals has not been
easy for her.
"I'm terrible at finishing," she
said. "I panic and get too excited
or I'm thinking, 'There's no way
in hell I'm going to score.'"
A Cardinal player who admits
the need to focus more on offen
sive skills is unusual, because the
coaches heavily emphasize team
defense. But Stephan can afford
to concentrate on offense.
"Defensively, one-on-one, she's
impossible to beat," said Stanford
coach Berhane Andeberhan. "She
plays and practices with total con
centration. She's one of a few who
never cheats. She may get tired
but she never cuts corners.
"If she makes a mistake, she
doesn't wallow in self-pity but
jumps back into battle to clean up
the mess," he added.
Aside from her excellent defen
sive skills, the 5 foot 3 inch mid
fielder is also distinguished by her
aggressive and dogged play. She's
not afraid to play a physical game
and battle a much larger player
for the ball. It's that style of play
that stuck her with the nickname
Scrappy.
But the nickname didn't just
stick, it stuck like glue. Her team
mates and coaches began calling
her Scrappy. Then her friends
outside the sport picked it up.
"Now absolutely everyone calls
me .Scrappy," said Stephan, who
is not altogether pleased by the
moniker's popularity.
But she has more to worry about
now than a nickname. The squad
has been plagued for several years
by the Jen Curse, which stipulates
that anyone on the team named

Jennifer will suffer a season-ending
knee injury before November of
their sophomore year. Understand
ably, Stephan is anxiously awaiting
the end of the month.
However, her roommate Jen
Gardiner, who has had both knees
operated on, isn't making it easy
for her.
"She said, 'It's your turn. You
better be ready because it's com
ing up,"' Stephan said. "She
thinks it's funny and I'm sweat

ing bullets."
But if Stephan can avoid seri
ous injury and stay healthy
through the last few days of Octo
ber, her future in the sport looks
promising. Considering she's
made great strides in the few
years she's played and that she
applies a strong work ethic and
unbridled enthusiasm to the
game, Stephan's best soccer is
probably yet to come.

centration. She's one of a few who
never cheats. She may get tired
but she never cuts corners.
"If she makes a mistake, she
doesn't wallow in self-pity but
jumps back into battle to clean up
the mess," he added.
Aside from her excellent defen
sive skills, the 5 foot 3 inch mid
fielder is also distinguished by her
aggressive and dogged play. She's
not afraid to play a physical game
and battle a much larger player
for the ball. It's that style of play
that stuck her with the nickname
Scrappy.
But the nickname didn't just
stick, it stuck like glue. Her team
mates and coaches began calling
her Scrappy. Then her friends
outside the sport picked it up.
"Now absolutely everyone calls
me .Scrappy," said Stephan, who
is not altogether pleased by the
moniker's popularity.
But she has more to worry about
now than a nickname. The squad
has been plagued for several years
by the Jen Curse, which stipulates
that anyone on the team named

Jennifer will suffer a season-ending
knee injury before November of
their sophomore year. Understand
ably, Stephan is anxiously awaiting
the end of the month.
However, her roommate Jen
Gardiner, who has had both knees
operated on, isn't making it easy
for her.
"She said, 'It's your turn. You
better be ready because it's com
ing up,"' Stephan said. "She
thinks it's funny and I'm sweat

ing bullets."
But if Stephan can avoid seri
ous injury and stay healthy
through the last few days of Octo
ber, her future in the sport looks
promising. Considering she's
made great strides in the few
years she's played and that she
applies a strong work ethic and
unbridled enthusiasm to the
game, Stephan's best soccer is
probably yet to come.

Sophomore midfielder Jen Stephan is making an impact on Stan
ford's second-ranked soccer team in only her fourth year of inter
scholastic play.
Sophomore Jen Stephan
hasn't followed the route many
players take to land a spot in a
major college program. You'd
expect a midfielder for the No. 2
Cardinal squad to have logged
years of experience in the sport.
But Stephan didn't start play
ing seriously until her sophomore
year of high school. She did try
the sport once when she was six,
but dropped it four years later,
partly because her coach told her
that she had no future.
"I just decided to concentrate
on other sports because I wasn't
enjoying it," she said. "I would
hate going to practices because he
always said, 'You're too slow.
You're so bad.' So I quit."

If she makes a
mistake, she doesn't
wallow in self-pity but
jumps back into
battle to clean up the
mess.'

Not only was Stephan turned
off by her coach's attitude, but
she also was disgusted with the
politicking of overbearing parents
and coaches who crushed young
players with weighty expecta
tions.
"(Some parents] start in sev
lth and eighth grade, calling up
Olympic development coaches
and saying, 'Come look at my
kid,'" she said.
"And it causes a lot of distress,
even between friends. It's like,
'Oh, gosh, you're dad is doing this
and thinks you're so great but
you're really not. I'm actually bet
ter than you.'"
So Stephan concentrated on
Softball, volleyball and basketball
until she haphazardly picked up
soccer again in ninth grade.
But she still did not begin play
ing year-round until her junior
year, when she joined a south
Texas club squad and started to
think about playing in college.
After Stephan had put in only
two years of intense soccer, some
may have questioned whether her
skills were of college caliber. But
she has proven at Stanford that
her short exposure to the sport
shouldn't be a mark against her.
In fact, she considers it just the

opposite.
"I still feel really new to soc
cer," Stephan said. "I still have so
much enthusiasm for it and right
now I can't see myself ever get
ting sick of it."
She has been particularly
pleased with her game this sea
son, making the jump to a start
ing position. And she usually fin
ishes the game, with only an occa
sional breather during the 90
minutes of action.
Playing nearly a full game is no
small feat considering Stephan is
responsible for covering from end
line to endline. Not only does she
take care of throw-in and corner
kick duties, but she also marks
opposing attackers, distributes
the ball from fullbacks to for
wards and supports the forwards
on scoring opportunities.
This year, Stephan is focusing
on offensive play, particularly fin
ishing off scoring opportunities.
Although she has improved her
crossing passes and is more
aggressive when pushing the ball
upfield, scoring goals has not been
easy for her.
"I'm terrible at finishing," she
said. "I panic and get too excited
or I'm thinking, 'There's no way
in hell I'm going to score.'"
A Cardinal player who admits
the need to focus more on offen
sive skills is unusual, because the
coaches heavily emphasize team
defense. But Stephan can afford
to concentrate on offense.
"Defensively, one-on-one, she's
impossible to beat," said Stanford
coach Berhane Andeberhan. "She
plays and practices with total con
centration. She's one of a few who
never cheats. She may get tired
but she never cuts corners.

doesn't wallow in self-pity but
