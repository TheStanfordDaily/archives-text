Under the direction of
women'B fencing coach Sherry
Posthumus, the IM depart
ment has instituted a new for
feit policy to try to deal with
the increased amount of "no
shows" last year.
"It just got to be ridiculous,"
said Greg Gottlieb of the IM
staff. "We were upset because
we had to pay officials to be out
on the fields, and the other
teams were upset because they
had no one to play." So at the
instigation of Gottlieb and the
rest of the staff, a new policy
was implemented.
Now, teams must pay $50 at
the beginning of the quarter,
and lose $10 each time they for
feit. The new policy has worked
well so far.
"The real test will come
when everybody has
midterms," said IM staff mem
ber Miguel Bernal.
The league sports offered
this quarter are football, four
player volleyball and co-ed
inner tube water polo. The staff
also runs single elimination
tournaments for sports includ
ing three-on-three basketball,
table tennis doubles and hand
ball. One-day events are also on
the upcoming schedule: a cross
country meet (Oct. 31, register
at 3:45 p.m. on the second tee
of the Stanford Golf Course),
and a wrestling meet (Nov. 17
at 7 p.m. in Encina Gym).
Playoffs for league sports
begin in three weeks, and the
competition is already fierce.
The two top football teams
from last year, the Invisible
Hands and Rains I, are back
again with their playbooks and
audibles.

Rankings update
Note: Volleyball rankings are based
on the results of a coaches' poll
conducted biweekly.
