# Forget midterms, get spiked in L.A.
## 
### 
Midterms give me furballs.
Like you're supposed
to actually be caught
up on your reading by the
third, fourth or fifth week of
school. If I sit tight until the
end of the quarter, the Simp
sons are usually into re-runs,
I've given up on the man with
the hairy back who lives in the
room below, and I've flirted
with my professors enough to
have a basic desire to learn the
material.
I also have my laundry done.
You can't start cramming
when you have to wear jeans
with no underwear. It's too
painful.
But midterms are absurd.
Getting caught up on 400 pages
of reading in one weekend is as
fruitless and painful as trying
to shave your legs in the dimly
lit Stern showers.
So this weekend, don't
study for midterms. Not at all.
Not one page. You know you
can b.s. your way through it.
So it's physics. . . b.s. with
exponents.
This weekend, you're going
to LA. The roadtrip. The col
lege experience. A good excuse
to get away from crappy North
ern California weather. Bring
back ajar of smog and a tan for
me.
Our No. 2-ranked women's
volleyball team is playing No. 1
UCLA this Friday and I would
like to see them wipe the floor
with Natalie Williams'
exhausted body after she dives
to the floor, missing the win
ning Cardinal spike.
My heart was broken when
the Bruins stole a slim victory
in Maples a few weeks ago.
Nothing would be a sweeter
pre-Halloween surprise than
giving the axe to the Bruins'
Marissa Hatchet.
UCLA deserves to be massa
cred. I chanted "Bev is God" at
the game. I watched Kristi
Paaso dive to the floor stopping
everything but a black-clad Phi
Delt falling from the fourth
row of the stands from hitting
the court. I want revenge.
We were as unstoppable as a
frosh in search of free beer for
the first two games, until the
Bruins came out of the locker
room on fire. But we didn't fall
apart. Stanford just couldn't
counter the momentum of the
reigning NCAA champions, or
was laughing too hard at that
"Who-dat" girl's last name, as
UCLA snatched up the next
two games.

Then came the fifth game
. . . What the heck was that?
What is that sudden-death
elimination, it-doesn't-matter
who's-serving business? Before
that buff cheerleader guy could
even get a good "Go, Stanford"
going, UCLA had taken the
game, with the packed stands
reeling from the shock.

If you have the attention
span of a sperm whale, stay at
home. They should play out the
fifth game. We were robbed. Or
at least we can say we were. So
we lost. But it doesn't have to
happen again.
I personally think the
karma was bad. This weekend
the karma is very, very good.
Stanford has been pulverizing
every team that steps near
Maples Pavilion, leaving the
Pac-10 in a heap on the floor.
This Friday could be a glee
ful continuation of this trend,
and with a second-course of
USC to help wash down the
victory, it would be a great
weekend. And you could wit
ness it all.
I must, however, offer a
warning for the USC game,
depending on where it's being
played. Although it is Hal
loween, I would suggest leaving
your "Horale, vato"-gangster
costume in the dorm, because
back in LA. they play for keeps.
But you could watch Stan
ford devour the Trojans, then
go see the transvestites walk
Hollywood Boulevard. What
better combination could there
be? Volleyball, with its new,
non-sexist uniforms and L.A.,
the place where nothing is
absurd, where grandmothers
wear more makeup than all the
Chi O's put together and geni
tal piercing is a reality.
And when you get back, tell
me how it went. I have three
midterms to study for. I'll be
living vicariously through you.

the library all weekend. Her

So this weekend, don't
study for midterms. Not at all.
Not one page. You know you
can b.s. your way through it.
So it's physics. . . b.s. with
exponents.
This weekend, you're going
to LA. The roadtrip. The col
lege experience. A good excuse
to get away from crappy North
ern California weather. Bring
back ajar of smog and a tan for
me.
Our No. 2-ranked women's
volleyball team is playing No. 1
UCLA this Friday and I would
like to see them wipe the floor
with Natalie Williams'
exhausted body after she dives
to the floor, missing the win
ning Cardinal spike.
My heart was broken when
the Bruins stole a slim victory
in Maples a few weeks ago.
Nothing would be a sweeter
pre-Halloween surprise than
giving the axe to the Bruins'
Marissa Hatchet.
UCLA deserves to be massa
cred. I chanted "Bev is God" at
the game. I watched Kristi
Paaso dive to the floor stopping
everything but a black-clad Phi
Delt falling from the fourth
row of the stands from hitting
the court. I want revenge.
We were as unstoppable as a
frosh in search of free beer for
the first two games, until the
Bruins came out of the locker
room on fire. But we didn't fall
apart. Stanford just couldn't
counter the momentum of the
reigning NCAA champions, or
was laughing too hard at that
"Who-dat" girl's last name, as
UCLA snatched up the next
two games.

Then came the fifth game
. . . What the heck was that?
What is that sudden-death
elimination, it-doesn't-matter
who's-serving business? Before
that buff cheerleader guy could
even get a good "Go, Stanford"
going, UCLA had taken the
game, with the packed stands
reeling from the shock.

If you have the attention
span of a sperm whale, stay at
home. They should play out the
fifth game. We were robbed. Or
at least we can say we were. So
we lost. But it doesn't have to
happen again.
I personally think the
karma was bad. This weekend
the karma is very, very good.
Stanford has been pulverizing
every team that steps near
Maples Pavilion, leaving the
Pac-10 in a heap on the floor.
This Friday could be a glee
ful continuation of this trend,
and with a second-course of
USC to help wash down the
victory, it would be a great
weekend. And you could wit
ness it all.
I must, however, offer a
warning for the USC game,
depending on where it's being
played. Although it is Hal
loween, I would suggest leaving
your "Horale, vato"-gangster
costume in the dorm, because
back in LA. they play for keeps.
But you could watch Stan
ford devour the Trojans, then
go see the transvestites walk
Hollywood Boulevard. What
better combination could there
be? Volleyball, with its new,
non-sexist uniforms and L.A.,
the place where nothing is
absurd, where grandmothers
wear more makeup than all the
Chi O's put together and geni
tal piercing is a reality.
And when you get back, tell
me how it went. I have three
midterms to study for. I'll be
living vicariously through you.

Tish Williams will be "busy" in
the library all weekend. Her
column appears here bi-weekly.
