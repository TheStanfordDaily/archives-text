An important characteristic of a truly great
athletic team is the ability to rebound after a
tough loss. In the last week, the Stanford Car
dinal women's varsity field hockey team has
proven worthy of this distinction.
The Cardinal suffered a mild setback last
Saturday in a 3-2 overtime loss at Pacific, a
game marred by a late Tiger rally and ques
tionable officiating.
"We had a lot of really good scoring oppor
tunities, a lot of chances to put the game
away," said team captain Christina Vidal.
"But all the breaks went against us."
The Cardinal opened the scoring against the
Tigers midway through the first half on a Sara
Hallock short-corner shot. Just before the half,
the Tigers tied it up with another successful
short-corner. The Cardinal dominated the sec
ond half, taking most of the shots on goal and
playing tough inside the Pacific circle.
"The kids played great," said head coach

Sheryl Johnson. "We did everything right, we
just had bad luck."
The bad luck began when controversial
calls by officials nullified two second-half Car
dinal goals.
Hallock, the team's scoring leader, added to
her total of 16 goals with one in the second
half. But the Tigers answered with a break
away score minutes before the end of the
game, sending it into sudden death overtime.
"We dominated the game but had the two
goals called back," Johnson said. "They went
down and got a lucky shot."
In overtime, the Tigers mounted yet
another break away with a 3-on-2 advantage
in the Cardinal circle, and scored the winning
goal.
"They were a good team but we were bet
ter," Hallock said. "It was just one of those
games that should've been 4-2 (Stanford)."
Entering the final two games of the regular
season, both against Cal, the women found
themselves in a must win situation Tuesday at

Berkeley. The Cardinal rose to the occasion,
beating the Bears, 1-0.
"Our team played strongly," Vidal said. "We
put a lot of pressure on their defense and every
one scrambled well. It was a good win for us."
The lone goal of the game was the result of
a pass from Tina Syer, right wing, to left wing
Courtney Newman, who deflected the ball into
the goal. The Cardinal women played a solid
g£me and held on for the win.
"Our defense was exceptionally good,"
Johnson said. "Everybody did their part on
defense."
With the win, the women earned a 2-2-1
record in the Northern Pacific Conference and
clinched a berth in the NorPac playoffs, to be
held Nov. 5.
Saturday's pivotal final game against Cal
will determine the conference champion.
"The fact that we won this game gives us
momentum going into the second game,"
Vidal said. "We've shown we can beat them
and feel we can do it again."
