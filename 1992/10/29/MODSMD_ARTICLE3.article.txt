# Few universities provide benefits to faculty, staff
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
If the Faculty Senate passes
the domestic partners bill
today, Stanford will move a step
closer to becoming one of the
few universities nationwide to
provide health benefits to its
employees' domestic partners.
Only slightly more than 5
percent of the 500 universities
surveyed by the National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force Policy
Institute in 1990 said they had
some sort of domestic part
ner/non-traditional family
recognition policy in effect.
Many of the other campuses
surveyed were in the negotiat
ing stages of the policy.
However, most major uni

versities — such as Harvard,
UCLA and the University of
Michigan — simply make ben
efits available to an employee's
legal spouse.
Of the few universities that
do have partner benefits, pro
grams range from ones that
allow sick and bereavement
leave, such as Brown Universi
ty and Columbia University, to
Occidental College and North
Dakota University, which give
recreational access, to ones that
offer housing benefits, such as
Grinnell College and the Union
Theological Seminary.
Even fewer universities go
beyond these relatively low-cost
benefits to the more expensive
step of extending health coverage
to domestic partners. And cost is
often one of the first issues that
come to administrators' minds
when schools are considering
increasing benefits.
For instance, MIT has estimat
ed it would cost an additional
$300,000 to $600,000 annually if
health benefits were extended to
domestic partners.
That estimated cost is likely the
biggest factor blocking approval of
a proposal to provide both medical
and dental benefits to domestic
partners of Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology employees,
according to Stephen Fairfield,
the chair of the MIT Council of
the Family and Work.
Fairfield said the community
has generally been supportive of

the proposal, which was initiated
by employees, but that cost is an
issue that cannot be ignored by
the university.
One university that has accept
ed the added costs of a domestic
partner benefits policy is the Uni
versity of lowa. Last week, lowa's
Board of Regents approved a pro
posal which allows employees to
purchase health insurance for
their domestic partners.
A committee at lowa studied
the issue for two years and even
tually concluded that the universi
ty should extend its coverage. It
reasoned that the original purpose
behind university-provided cover
age for marriages also justified
insurance for domestic partners.
"We didn't want faculty to suf
fer from a financial crisis because
of someone they're economically
responsible for," said Mary Jo
Small, the associate vice president
for finance and university services
at lowa.

The same protection from
financial catastrophe should be
extended to faculty and staff who
can prove economic responsibility
for a domestic partner, she said.
Like the proposed domestic
partners bill at Stanford, an
employee at lowa has to sign an
affidavit of domestic partnership
to be eligible for the benefits.
Some of the conditions include
joint ownership of property, des
ignation of the partner as a bene
ficiary in the university's insur
ance company and cohabitation
for at least one year. Heterosexu
al couples are also included under
this policy.
Pitzer College, one of the five
Claremont Colleges, also has
health insurance benefits for
domestic partners. According to
Peter Nardi, chair of the college's
policy-making committee, the
issue came up after several faculty
members asked about coverage for
their partners.

The college's domestic partner
policy "conforms to Ithe college's]
nondiscrimination policy," Nardi
said. "It's bringing it up to standard
— it's not a contentious thing."
The other four colleges in the
Claremont system, however, do
not recognize domestic partners.
"It just hasn't come up," said
Barbara Condit, the director of
personnel at Claremont-McKenna
College, noting that no employees
have asked about it.
Condit said the college is just
following California policy. "It's
not a matter of discrimination or
nondiscrimination," she said.
"The insurance covers those who
the employees have a legal liability
for. Domestic partners are not a
legal liability."
UC-Berkeley follows the same
policy, according to Mary Deshaw,
a senior benefits analyst. In accor
dance with state law, "domestic
partners are not considered eligi
ble as dependents," Deshaw said.

recreational access, to ones that
offer housing benefits, such as
Grinnell College and the Union
Theological Seminary.
Even fewer universities go
beyond these relatively low-cost
benefits to the more expensive
step of extending health coverage
to domestic partners. And cost is
often one of the first issues that
come to administrators' minds
when schools are considering
increasing benefits.
For instance, MIT has estimat
ed it would cost an additional
$300,000 to $600,000 annually if
health benefits were extended to
domestic partners.
That estimated cost is likely the
biggest factor blocking approval of
a proposal to provide both medical
and dental benefits to domestic
partners of Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology employees,
according to Stephen Fairfield,
the chair of the MIT Council of
the Family and Work.
Fairfield said the community
has generally been supportive of

the proposal, which was initiated
by employees, but that cost is an
issue that cannot be ignored by
the university.
One university that has accept
ed the added costs of a domestic
partner benefits policy is the Uni
versity of lowa. Last week, lowa's
Board of Regents approved a pro
posal which allows employees to
purchase health insurance for
their domestic partners.
A committee at lowa studied
the issue for two years and even
tually concluded that the universi
ty should extend its coverage. It
reasoned that the original purpose
behind university-provided cover
age for marriages also justified
insurance for domestic partners.
"We didn't want faculty to suf
fer from a financial crisis because
of someone they're economically
responsible for," said Mary Jo
Small, the associate vice president
for finance and university services
at lowa.

The same protection from
financial catastrophe should be
extended to faculty and staff who
can prove economic responsibility
for a domestic partner, she said.
Like the proposed domestic
partners bill at Stanford, an
employee at lowa has to sign an
affidavit of domestic partnership
to be eligible for the benefits.
Some of the conditions include
joint ownership of property, des
ignation of the partner as a bene
ficiary in the university's insur
ance company and cohabitation
for at least one year. Heterosexu
al couples are also included under
this policy.
Pitzer College, one of the five
Claremont Colleges, also has
health insurance benefits for
domestic partners. According to
Peter Nardi, chair of the college's
policy-making committee, the
issue came up after several faculty
members asked about coverage for
their partners.

The college's domestic partner
policy "conforms to Ithe college's]
nondiscrimination policy," Nardi
said. "It's bringing it up to standard
— it's not a contentious thing."
The other four colleges in the
Claremont system, however, do
not recognize domestic partners.
"It just hasn't come up," said
Barbara Condit, the director of
personnel at Claremont-McKenna
College, noting that no employees
have asked about it.
Condit said the college is just
following California policy. "It's
not a matter of discrimination or
nondiscrimination," she said.
"The insurance covers those who
the employees have a legal liability
for. Domestic partners are not a
legal liability."
UC-Berkeley follows the same
policy, according to Mary Deshaw,
a senior benefits analyst. In accor
dance with state law, "domestic
partners are not considered eligi
ble as dependents," Deshaw said.
