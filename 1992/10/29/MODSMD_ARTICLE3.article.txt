# Few universities provide benefits to faculty, staff

If the Faculty Senate passes
the domestic partners bill
today, Stanford will move a step
closer to becoming one of the
few universities nationwide to
provide health benefits to its
employees' domestic partners.
Only slightly more than 5
percent of the 500 universities
surveyed by the National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force Policy
Institute in 1990 said they had
some sort of domestic part
ner/non-traditional family
recognition policy in effect.
Many of the other campuses
surveyed were in the negotiat
ing stages of the policy.
However, most major uni

versities — such as Harvard,
UCLA and the University of
Michigan — simply make ben
efits available to an employee's
legal spouse.
Of the few universities that
do have partner benefits, pro
grams range from ones that
allow sick and bereavement
leave, such as Brown Universi
ty and Columbia University, to
Occidental College and North
Dakota University, which give
recreational access, to ones that
offer housing benefits, such as
Grinnell College and the Union
Theological Seminary.
Even fewer universities go
beyond these relatively low-cost
benefits to the more expensive
