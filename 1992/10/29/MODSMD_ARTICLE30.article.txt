# Cardinal skaters sizzle, bring ice action west
## 
### Rich Stolz 
Since when has anyone associ
ated Stanford with ice hockey?
Palm trees maybe, and, oh yeah,
football. But ice hockey?
Well, yes. Just ask UCLA, San
Jose State or California, who also
sport ice hockey teams in the
Pacific Collegiate Hockey League
(PCHL).
So far this season, Stanford
ice hockey has reestablished its
reputation as a powerhouse in
the PCHL, and as a quality team
capable of competing with some
of the better club teams in the
nation.
The Cardinal was victorious in
its first two games, 9-0 and 9-1
wins over UCIiA. Stanford split
its second series against SJSU,
making its PCHL record 3-1.

Ice hockey is likely to be a
familiar sport for members of the
Stanford community harking
from the East Coast and Canada.
But the sport does not traditional
ly enjoy the same level of enthusi
asm in California.
Mark Benning, left-winger,
said, "(Ice hockey) is just a club
sport now, but over time it may
grow to be more prominent here
on the West Coast."
Benning, who played for Har
vard and spent some time as a
professional in Europe before
attending Stanford for his MBA,
added, "It's great to be able to
play here and I'm really excited
about it. I didn't know Stanford
had a hockey team."
Luke Winters and Cory Sam
mons, the top two returning scor
ers in the conference, are joined

on the team by the top two goal
tenders in the league last year,
Keith Bowen and Bill Suther
land.
Stan ford's players are general
ly hockey fanatics from the East
Coast, midwest and Canada who
have played since childhood. The
Cardinal possesses a powerful mix
of experience and talent; half of
its 20 players are graduate stu
dents.
Head coach Ernie Ferrari, who
Benning said is "a credit to the
team," has been instrumental in
expanding the PCHL and in
bringing respected teams such as
Colorado State and Arizona to the
schedule.
• The PCHL itself has 20 teams.
Four teams — Stanford, San Jose
State, UCLA and Cal — make up
the first division. While Cardinal

players consider the Spartans to
be their biggest rival, the Cal
games draw the most fans.
Several nationally competitive
teams will face the Cardinal in the
near future at Golden Gate Ice
Rink in Redwood City. Stanford
faces Colorado State at home this
Friday at 7 p.m and Saturday at
7:30 p.m. Arizona visits Golden
Gate on Dec 4 and 5, and Arizona
State comes to town .lan. 29 and
30.
Games are played in pairs, so
as to minimize the cost of travel,
and are played Friday and Satur
day nights. Tickets are available
at the rink for $3 — $4 for non
students.
"These should be good, com
petitive games. We're really look
ing forward to them," Morrison
said.
