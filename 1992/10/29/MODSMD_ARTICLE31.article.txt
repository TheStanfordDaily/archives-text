# Sailors take North Sloop, look to PCC Championships
## 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
The winds of victory carried Stanford
sailors to two separate wins last week
end at the North Sloop Eliminations in
Santa Cruz and at the Frosh-Soph
Regatta in Redwood City.
Junior Scott Sellers and his crew nav
igated Stanford's team into the confer
ence championships by finishing first in
Saturday's North Sloop Regatta at UC-
Santa Cruz.
The crew of Sellers, senior Geoff
McDonald, senior Rusty Lhamon and
junior Jeremy Mclntyre will join qualify
ing crews from California and the Cali
fornia Maritime Academy to represent
the north in this Saturday's Pacific
Coast Conference Sloop Championships
in Newport Beach.
"It's good that we dominated these
races, but it was really only important to
finish in the top three to qualify. Next
weekend, that's when all the marbles are
on the table," coach Blake Middleton said.
With Sellers at the helm, Stanford
won three of the four races in the regat
ta to ensure not only a top-three finish,
but a commanding first place standing.

Stanford needs to finish first or second
in Southern California to advance to the
national sloop championships, Middle
ton said.
Victory also gathered in the sails of
sophomore Charles Meade and his crew
as they blew away the competition in the
Frosh-Soph Regatta, which was hosted
by the Cardinal.
In a sport where the top two finishers
are usually separated by less than five
points, Meade and his crewmate, sopho
more Mary Kussmaul, put an ocean
between his boat and the other 20, beating
the second-place finishers by 44 points.
Meade's boat won seven races and
finished in the top three in all but two of
them.
Two Cal boats and a San Diego State
boat placed second through fourth in the
competition, and Cardinal sailors fin
ished in the next sixth berths.
In a surprise performance, freshman
Stephan Teitge sailed to a fifth-place fin
ish, with freshman Cibyl Diver and
junior Larry Jen alternating as his crew
mate. Teitge finished all his Sunday
races in the top 10. •
"I was very pleased with their perfor
mance considering the step up they took

over the week. During practice Stephen
hasn't really been consistent in beating
other sailors on the team," Middleton said.
Two weekends ago, in the Pacific
Coast Conference Singlehanded Champi
onships at Santa Cruz, Stanford failed to
finish in the top two and therefore to send
a competitor to national competition.
Racing lasers (one-person boats) in
round-robin competition, senior Rusty
Lhamon, Mclntyre, Meade and Sellers
each qualified to the final rounds, but
were outmanned by more experienced
sailors.
Meade, Stanford's best single-handed
racer, finished in a disappointing sixth
place.
"Charles is by far Stanford's best
laser racer and one of the best in the
country. He actually has the ability to go
to nationals and possibly win, but he
obviously had a really bad racing week
end," Middleton said.
Halfway through the competition,
Meade was still in third place and within
striking distance of the top two spots, but
he dropped in the standings Sunday, leav
ing Morgan Larson of Hawaii and Rand
Lake of UC-Irvine as the only racers with
national championship possibilities.
