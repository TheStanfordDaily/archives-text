# Anarchy, famine plague Somalia
## Media, U.N. ignoring problem, Red Cross spokesperson says 
### Bill Ackerman 
Two million Somalians will die of starvation and
other causes by Christmas, but most of their deaths
will fall on deaf ears, a prominent American Red
Cross official warned Stanford yesterday.
"A situation like Lord of the Flies is being played
out in Somalia," said Ann Stingle, international
spokesperson for the American Red Cross, before a
crowd of about 40 students. "Social orders and
human systems are being completely destroyed in the
only sustained case of anarchy in this century."
Stingle described the severe starvation, fleeing,
looting, and anarchy that are tearing apart the east
African country.
To her organization's frustration, the problems
continue to be ignored by the international communi
ty — the press, the United Nations, politicians and
individuals. "The entire international community is
at fault," she said.
"Somalia is a nation committing suicide," Stingle
added. One hundred thousand people have died from
starvation or fighting since January, 1 million have
fled the country, and the death rate has reached
10,000 per day. An estimated 2 million will die before
the end of the year, she said.
The problems are made worse by a public fully

armed with weapons as individuals respond to the
anarchy, Stingle said.
"If you have a gun you have a life. If you have no
gun, you have no life," she said.
To combat these problems, the International Red
Cross is conducting the largest single relief effort
since World War II: 624 kitchens have been built, a
distribution system has been established, and build
ings have been converted to hospitals.
"The world does not know how to act when there is
no government or social order to deal with. When
does the international community have the right to
intervene? It's a problem of humanitarian assistance
versus sovereignty of state," she said.
Stingle pointed to potential solutions, but was
insistent that "complex crises require complex
answers."
"The situation will not soon get better, but there
is hope and a real need for long-term commitment.
Often, the world has the attention span of a 2-year
old. Stanford students and faculty can help remedy
this," she said.
A "Focus on Somalia" sponsored by the Center for
African Studies will continue today with a lecture on
the origins of the crisis by Prof. Abdi Samatar from
the UC-Berkeley. The session will be held at the Bech
tel International Center Dining Room at noon.
