# Cardinal football hits big time
## Walsh's arrival lures national radio, television contracts 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
When Bill Walsh announced last spring that he
was returning to Stanford for a second stint as head
football coach, the sports marketing department
knew the football team would become a much bigger
attraction.
Walsh's arrival pushed Stanford football into
the national limelight, and the Department of Ath
letics seized the moment by negotiating a national
radio and television contract this past spring to
provide game coverage for Cardinal fans from coast
to coast.
According to Associate Athletic Director Tom
Beckett, Stanford started looking for a replacement
for KCBS last year, searching for a radio station that
would more actively promote Stanford athletics.
KCBS, primarily a news station which uses the
slogan, "All News — All the Time," was problematic
because many people called the station to complain
when Stanford sports were being aired. "People
didn't like sports on the station," Beckett said.

The new contract should
increase Athletics Department
revenues by approximately
$250,000 over the the old KCBS.

"Also, the World Series was always a problem.
The CBS Network (the parent company of KCBS)
would force them to air it, and the Saturday (base
ball) game would usually interfere (preempt Stan
ford football)," Beckett said. "We don't want people
to think that Stanford football isn't as important as
the World Series, because in our opinion it is."
Athletic Director Ted Leland agreed there were
problems with KCBS.
"It's harder for them to be pro-Stanford because
of their news format," said Leland. "We needed
someone who would help us promote, and we also
had a desire to gain a national market."
The Athletics Department was looking for a sta
tion that would treat Stanford as its principal client
and increase the University's revenues.
Enter Noble Broadcast Group, a division of NMS
Sports Marketing. NMS signed a three-year contract
with Stanford in the spring, becoming the new
media outlet for Cardinal sports.
The Cardinal Radio Network's new originating
station is San Francisco-based KFRC (610 AM), a
5,000-watt station.
The new contract should increase Athletics
Department revenues by approximately $250,000
over the the old KCBS deal, Leland said.
The network currently comprises 19 stations that
broadcast Cardinal football and men's basketball to
a number of cities, including Boston, Los Angeles,
Tampa Bay, Houston, Kansas City, Denver, St.
Louis, Long Island, N.Y., Arlington, Va., and La

Grange, Ga.
Halfway through the first year of the contract,
both KFRC and the University say they are extreme
ly satisfied with the union.
"Its been a lot of fun," said John Bassanelli, the
San Francisco sales manager for KFRC. "It's given a
lot of visibility to the station, and Stanford has been
great to work with."
"We went into the association knowing that both
parties had a lot to give," said Brent Osborne, KFRC
vice president and general manager. "Stanford was
interested in increasing its promotion and market
ing, and our stations could profit from that.
"Stanford athletics are different, and we're trying
to emphasize the fun, visibility and excitement of
Stanford sports. Not just football but basketball,
too. Its the job of our radio station to do that."
KFRC began negotiating with Stanford last year
for the rights to Cardinal sports. With Walsh as head
coach, KFRC was that much more eager to sign on
the dotted line.
"We started negotiating for Stanford before
Walsh was on," Bassanelli said. "The addition of
Walsh was just an added benefit."
The addition of Walsh has made KFRC's job of
convincing advertisers to sign up to sponsor the
broadcasts easier than anticipated. The fact that
Stanford has proven itself to be a top-20 team has
not hurt the station's efforts, either.
"In the beginning, it was easier to sell Bill Walsh
than it was to sell Stanford," said Peter Remington,
General Sales Manager of KFRC.
"Mercedes Benz signed on to sponsor the Bill
Walsh show. . . . After the Notre Dame game, it
became easier to sell Stanford (to advertisers)."
In addition to broadcasting the games, KFRC airs
a weekly report on Stanford sports called "Cardinal
Sportspage" every Wednesday evening from 7 to 8
p.m. featuring Walsh.
The television arm of the contract is Sports Cha
nnel America, a cable sports network. The package
Stanford forged with Sports Channel calls for every
Stanford game to be nationally televised on a
delayed basis on Sunday evenings at 11:00 EST
(8:00 PST).
In addition, Walsh has his own weekly television
show on the station, "Bill Walsh on College Foot
ball." This coverage, coupled with the radio expo
sure the University is receiving, has made Stanford
one of the most visible college programs nationally.
The winning ways of the football program and the
subsequent press resulting from it benefits not just
the athletic program, but the entire University, said
Beckett.
"Its a tremendous vehicle for Stanford," Beckett
said. "The success and recognition will help us in all
of our sports. I think we create interest in the Uni
versity in general — athletic and academic.
"On broadcasts, we speak to professors, adminis
trators, and Athletic Directors. I think the exposure
will help the general student population," Leland said.
"We feel like we have to recruit nationally and we
feel that Stanford football is a program that has to
have national prominence to do that," added Leland.
"This is one of the things that helps us do that."

will help the general student population," Leland said.
"We feel like we have to recruit nationally and we
feel that Stanford football is a program that has to
have national prominence to do that," added Leland.
"This is one of the things that helps us do that."
When Bill Walsh announced last spring that he
was returning to Stanford for a second stint as head
football coach, the sports marketing department
knew the football team would become a much bigger
attraction.
Walsh's arrival pushed Stanford football into
the national limelight, and the Department of Ath
letics seized the moment by negotiating a national
radio and television contract this past spring to
provide game coverage for Cardinal fans from coast
to coast.
According to Associate Athletic Director Tom
Beckett, Stanford started looking for a replacement
for KCBS last year, searching for a radio station that
would more actively promote Stanford athletics.
KCBS, primarily a news station which uses the
slogan, "All News — All the Time," was problematic
because many people called the station to complain
when Stanford sports were being aired. "People
didn't like sports on the station," Beckett said.

The new contract should
increase Athletics Department
revenues by approximately
$250,000 over the the old KCBS.

"Also, the World Series was always a problem.
The CBS Network (the parent company of KCBS)
would force them to air it, and the Saturday (base
ball) game would usually interfere (preempt Stan
ford football)," Beckett said. "We don't want people
to think that Stanford football isn't as important as
the World Series, because in our opinion it is."
Athletic Director Ted Leland agreed there were
problems with KCBS.
"It's harder for them to be pro-Stanford because
of their news format," said Leland. "We needed
someone who would help us promote, and we also
had a desire to gain a national market."
The Athletics Department was looking for a sta
tion that would treat Stanford as its principal client
and increase the University's revenues.
Enter Noble Broadcast Group, a division of NMS
Sports Marketing. NMS signed a three-year contract
with Stanford in the spring, becoming the new
media outlet for Cardinal sports.
The Cardinal Radio Network's new originating
station is San Francisco-based KFRC (610 AM), a
5,000-watt station.
The new contract should increase Athletics
Department revenues by approximately $250,000
over the the old KCBS deal, Leland said.
The network currently comprises 19 stations that
broadcast Cardinal football and men's basketball to
a number of cities, including Boston, Los Angeles,
Tampa Bay, Houston, Kansas City, Denver, St.
Louis, Long Island, N.Y., Arlington, Va., and La

Grange, Ga.
Halfway through the first year of the contract,
both KFRC and the University say they are extreme
ly satisfied with the union.
"Its been a lot of fun," said John Bassanelli, the
San Francisco sales manager for KFRC. "It's given a
lot of visibility to the station, and Stanford has been
great to work with."
"We went into the association knowing that both
parties had a lot to give," said Brent Osborne, KFRC
vice president and general manager. "Stanford was
interested in increasing its promotion and market
ing, and our stations could profit from that.
"Stanford athletics are different, and we're trying
to emphasize the fun, visibility and excitement of
Stanford sports. Not just football but basketball,
too. Its the job of our radio station to do that."
KFRC began negotiating with Stanford last year
for the rights to Cardinal sports. With Walsh as head
coach, KFRC was that much more eager to sign on
the dotted line.
"We started negotiating for Stanford before
Walsh was on," Bassanelli said. "The addition of
Walsh was just an added benefit."
The addition of Walsh has made KFRC's job of
convincing advertisers to sign up to sponsor the
broadcasts easier than anticipated. The fact that
Stanford has proven itself to be a top-20 team has
not hurt the station's efforts, either.
"In the beginning, it was easier to sell Bill Walsh
than it was to sell Stanford," said Peter Remington,
General Sales Manager of KFRC.
"Mercedes Benz signed on to sponsor the Bill
Walsh show. . . . After the Notre Dame game, it
became easier to sell Stanford (to advertisers)."
In addition to broadcasting the games, KFRC airs
a weekly report on Stanford sports called "Cardinal
Sportspage" every Wednesday evening from 7 to 8
p.m. featuring Walsh.
The television arm of the contract is Sports Cha
nnel America, a cable sports network. The package
Stanford forged with Sports Channel calls for every
Stanford game to be nationally televised on a
delayed basis on Sunday evenings at 11:00 EST
(8:00 PST).
In addition, Walsh has his own weekly television
show on the station, "Bill Walsh on College Foot
ball." This coverage, coupled with the radio expo
sure the University is receiving, has made Stanford
one of the most visible college programs nationally.
The winning ways of the football program and the
subsequent press resulting from it benefits not just
the athletic program, but the entire University, said
Beckett.
"Its a tremendous vehicle for Stanford," Beckett
said. "The success and recognition will help us in all
of our sports. I think we create interest in the Uni
versity in general — athletic and academic.
