# Family values discussed

### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Inspired by the recent talk
about "family values" among
the presidential candidates, sev
eral Stanford students
described what the concept
means to them yesterday.
In a panel discussion titled,
"Decoding Family Values: Chal
lenging the Myths," Assistant to
the President Jean Fetter mod
erated speeches by four Stan
ford students.
Nicole Johnson, a senior
majoring in public policy, used her
own family foundation as a basis
for her opinions regarding what
family values should encompass.
"When I came as a minority
transfer to a predominantly
white school, I realized that my
family was everything to me,"
she said. "I became aware that
my mother was younger than
the other children's mothers,
and that I would come home to
my grandmother after school."
The main purpose of a fami
ly, according to Johnson, is to
rear and raise children. "If a
family is raising their children
to the best of their ability, then
they are successful," she said.
"The parent, or parents,
needs to have the tools and
needs to know how to make
their family work regardless of
the structure."
The panel discussion, attend
ed by about 20 people, was part
of the 1992 Jing Lyman Lecture
Series.
Thomas Arnold, a junior
majoring in philosophy, started
his speech by revealing that he
is an advocate of what he
termed "Christian values."
"In the Bible, when Christ
states that you must love him, I
interpret that as loving every
one. Christ is all people. We need
to get away from this vision of
'us' and 'them' and start saying
'we,' " he said.
Arnold continued by explain

ing that in order to ensure the
survival of families, the Ameri
can family must maintain con
tact with the outside world.
"The borders of the family
must be penetrable," he said. "It
is wrong to assume that a family
must be secure at the expense of
other people. I mean, having het
erosexual parents doesn't make
sleeping on the street any easier."
The third speaker, Mae Lee, a
co-terminal student, centered her
argument around the daily ques
tions with which she is faced.
"My parents always wanted
the best for me and taught me
to have respect for others, as a
sort of personal integrity and
understanding," she said.
"Out of this understanding
comes various questions," Lee
said "Why do I tend to feel
uncomfortable speaking in my
classes which are made up most
ly of men? Does it matter what
I do? Does it matter what I
think?"
She related these questions
to family values by stating that
these issues should be "at the
root of all of our thinking
regarding family values."

"What is hindering families
today is the fear of breaking
away from the traditional fami
ly, the fear of social change and
the fear of immigrant families
bringing different cultures and
values. In holding family values
we must hold compassion for
others," she said.
Monisha Pasupathi, a gradu
ate student in psychology,
explained that to her the two
functions of a family are sacri
fice and dependence. She said
that these two functions were
extremely prevalent in her fam
ily while growing up.
"You never mind sacrificing
for your family, for you know
that you can always depend
upon them," she said. "Any
group of people can sacrifice and
depend upon each other. It's
very nice to have families in the
way we choose."
She said America needs to
make having families more fea
sible economically. "It strikes
me as funny. Here, a bad econo
my makes the families weaker.
But in other countries, a bad
economy sometimes strength
ens the familiar bond," she said.
