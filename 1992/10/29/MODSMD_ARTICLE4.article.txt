# Casper defends free speech
## No 'Casper doctrine' outlining political endorsements 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
When University President Gerhard
Casper visited Kimball Hall earlier this
month to make what he called a "subtle"
point about the role of universities in po
litical issues, he never expected to be ac
cused of stifling free speech.
But that is exactly what happened, as
many interpreted his comments about
avoiding appearances of partisanship as
a sign that he would discourage students
and faculty from speaking out publicly.
It was an unfamiliar situation for
Casper, a legal scholar who sharply op

poses limits on speech and has been a
strong critic of political correctness.
"The notion that I am trying to in
hibit anybody's free speech is just so
ridiculous that I never thought anybody
could think it,"he said in an interview
yesterday. Instead, his remarks were in
tended merely as "cautionary observa
tions" that would not necessarily trans
late into policy.
"There is no such thing as a 'Casper
doctrine', " he said, referring to a column
in the Stanford Review that applauded
Casper's stance and urged him to apply
his "doctrine" to faculty members.
"I never meant to suggest that I

would take anybody to task for engaging
in either speech or political activity,"
Casper said. "That should have been
just so obvious that it really beats me
how anybody could conclude that I
would end up proposing sanctions to re
strict the speech of Stanford faculty.
That's just sheer nonsense."
The issue has reemerged in the past
week because of public endorsements of
Democratic political candidates made by
Stanford faculty members — and, in one
case, by the president of the Board of
Trustees.
Last Monday, 179 faculty
members, headed by former Stan
ford presidents Donald Kennedy
and Richard Lyman, endorsed
Democratic Congressional candi
date Anna Eshoo in the 14th Dis
trict race.
And this week, Law School
Dean Paul Brest, School of Edu
cation Dean Marshall Smith and
Board of Trustees President John
Friedenrich joined 220 other col
lege presidents, deans and
trustees in endorsing Gov. Bill
Clinton for president.
But Casper said yesterday that
while he still has reservations
about endorsements by "large
numbers" of faculty, he does not
intend to "start counting num
bers or petitions."
"That is an uninteresting
game," he said.

Friedenrich, Casper said,
talked to him before he made the
endorsement and said he was act
ing as an individual in endorsing
Clinton, not as the president of
the board.
That was a perfectly acceptable
position, Casper said, adding that
there is no conflict as long as
endorsements are made "clearly
as citizens."
"Every single faculty member
can and should do whatever they
want to do — debate here should
be uninhibited, robust and wide
open," he said. "Faculty can act
individually or collectively."
Casper said the more question
able point, which he highlighted
in his Kimball speech, is that
when large numbers of faculty
join to endorse a certain position
it may create the impression that
Stanford as a whole has endorsed
it — and it may isolate those who
disagree with that point.
"When we get to large num
bers, the lines get blurred and it

becomes more difficult in terms of
the outside perception as well as
in terms of inside — those who
would like to dissent believing
there are dominant views on cam
pus," Casper said.
Although he ended up getting
into a "lot of trouble" after his visit
to Kimball, Casper said he plans to
continue visiting dormitories and
elaborating on some of the other
points that he had "only touched
upon" in his inaugural address.
The public criticism of his com
ments was a difficult experience,
but Casper said he was neverthe
less impressed by the discussion
they sparked.
"We have a lively discussion on
campus now," he said. "That is
the way I want it, and that's what
is taking place now, and that is
just fine.
"When it comes to defending
the freedom of speech at the Uni
versity, I will defend everybody's
freedom of speech. That is part of
my function — not to limit it."
