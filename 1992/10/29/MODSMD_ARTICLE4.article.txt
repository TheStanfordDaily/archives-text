# Casper defends free speech
## No 'Casper doctrine' outlining political endorsements 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
When University President Gerhard
Casper visited Kimball Hall earlier this
month to make what he called a "subtle"
point about the role of universities in po
litical issues, he never expected to be ac
cused of stifling free speech.
But that is exactly what happened, as
many interpreted his comments about
avoiding appearances of partisanship as
a sign that he would discourage students
and faculty from speaking out publicly.
It was an unfamiliar situation for
Casper, a legal scholar who sharply op

poses limits on speech and has been a
strong critic of political correctness.
"The notion that I am trying to in
hibit anybody's free speech is just so
ridiculous that I never thought anybody
could think it,"he said in an interview
yesterday. Instead, his remarks were in
tended merely as "cautionary observa
tions" that would not necessarily trans
late into policy.
"There is no such thing as a 'Casper
doctrine', " he said, referring to a column
in the Stanford Review that applauded
Casper's stance and urged him to apply
his "doctrine" to faculty members.
"I never meant to suggest that I

would take anybody to task for engaging
in either speech or political activity,"
Casper said. "That should have been
just so obvious that it really beats me
how anybody could conclude that I
would end up proposing sanctions to re
strict the speech of Stanford faculty.
That's just sheer nonsense."
The issue has reemerged in the past
week because of public endorsements of
Democratic political candidates made by
Stanford faculty members â€” and, in one
case, by the president of the Board of
Trustees.
