Tough guys in
top dog film of
hoods and crime

Reservoir Dogs

"Reservoir Dogs" is unquestionably one
of the year's most violent films. It's also one
of the year's best — a tornado that grabs
you almost immediately with its over-the
top energy, and refuses to let you go until it
reaches its stunning climax.
The film opens with a casual discussion
among several principals of a school: over
breakfast, they debate the true meaning of
Madonna's "Like A Virgin," and their vari

ous philosophies on tipping waiters. Then,
six of them walk out to their cars and drive
to a pre-planned robbery of a Los Angeles
jewelry store.
After the opening credits, the film cuts
right to the post-heist insanity. Two of the
hoods, played by Harvey Keitel and Tim
Roth, flee the scene. While Roth bleeds pro
fusely from the stomach and begs to be
dropped off at a hospital, Keitel ignores his
pleas. They drive on to their rendezvous, an
abandoned warehouse, where they wait for
the rest of the team to arrive to figure out
who ratted on them.
Though all of the film's present action
takes place inside the warehouse, writer-di
rector Quentin Tarantino shifts efficiently
between the past and present to explain the
origins of the heist.
But rather than interrupting the flow of
action, each flashback heightens the sus
pense. Even when the audience learns the
squealer's identity halfway through the
film, the tension is only increased.
Tarantino's direction is supremely confi
dent. He knows just how long each shot
should last, when to move the camera and
when to keep it still. This is especially true
in an unnerving torture scene, which he
shoots in real-time (without any interrup
tion) to heighten the immediacy.
Tarantino is also possessed of great visu
al wit. Each of the hoods — all of whom
have been code-named after colors — is
dressed identically in black suits, white
shirts, black ties and black sunglasses. It's a
retro-pop look that recalls the "B" pulp
movies of the '50s while suggesting the
characters' need for anonymity.
Tarantino's filmmaking is matched by
the crack cast he has assembled. Harvey
Keitel ("Bugsy") as Mr. White is the film's
moral center, a man whose fierce loyalty
proves his undoing. And Steve Buscemi is
by turns funny and weaselly as Mr. Pink, a

professional hood who worries that his
code name casts aspersions on his sexuality.
But the "top dog" award goes to Michael
Madsen ("Thelma and Louise") whose psy
chotic Mr. Blonde uses the chaos of the
heist as a chance to unleash his worst im
pulses. A sadist whose quiet, deliberate
manner masks his true nature, Mr. Blonde
is terrifying because no one — not even the
audience — can figure out what he'll do
next.
Unlike recent films that don't have the
courage to follow through on their fatalistic
premises, "Reservoir Dogs" maintains its
joyfully nihilistic tone until the very end.
Though it's not for the squeamish, the film
is well worth seeing. It's the calling card of a
director who will be around for long time to
come.

Black and white:
Movie explores
interracial dating

Zebrahead

"Zebrahead," the story of an interracial
romance, brings to the screen a combina
tion of integrity and reality that has often
been missed by films of this genre.
First-time writer and director Anthony
Drazan, who based the film partially on his
own past as a white youth in racially mixed
high schools, chronicles the affair between
two teenagers, Zack (Michael Rapaport),
who is white, and Nikki (N'bushe Wright),
who is African-American.
What makes Drazans efforts special is
not his subject matter, which has been ex
plored since the days of "West Side Story"
and more recently by Spike Lee in "Jungle
Fever," but the complexity of his treat
ment. Drazan's film is a multi-layered tes
tament about race, youth, families and
America.
Zack is accepted as "down" because he
listens to black music and is best friends

with Dee (Deshonn Castle), Nikki's cousin.
Matters change after Zack and Nikki start
dating, but the battle lines aren't drawn in
the trite two-dimensional manner between
black and white.
Dee has no problems with Zack dating
his cousin and even defends him in the black
community at school. Zack's ex-girlfriend,
who is white, accepts the relationship and
makes an effort to befriend Nikki, a transfer
student.
Zack's white friends appear accepting
also, but in a well-crafted party scene,
Drazan reveals the more realistic, malicious
attitude that Zack's friends have. "Is it true
what they say?" a couple of guys ask, "The
blacker the berry the sweeter the wine?"
Drazan sharply portrays American fami
lies who don't fit into the Ozzie and Harriet
stereotype. Zack's father is a womanizing
record salesman who doesn't chastise his
son for dating Nikki; he only checks to make
sure that it's lust and not love.
Nikki's mother, also a bit on the flaky
side, doesn't make a big scene either. In
stead, she meets Zack at the door with the
not-so-subtle question, "So, have you come
slummin'?"
The film contains some of the unfortu
nate cliches that tend to plague interracial
stories — noticeably the use of death to
symbolize the futility of intolerance.
Drazan takes a big gamble on his lead ac
tors, all of whom are untried actors, which
becomes obvious in some overacted scenes.
In one scene a group of students makes a
string of overdone, soapbox speeches that
no do nothing but belabor the point.
On the editing side, the first half of the
film is tightly directed and flows well, but
the last half tends to wander and lose fluidi
ty-
Overall, however, Drazan's first effort at
writing and directing is impressive.
Drazan's homework — taping 60 hours of
conversation in New York high schools —
pays off in the bite of the dialogue and the
snap of the script.
Provoking and entertaining, "Zebra
head" adds some insight into an often
volatile issue while remaining an enjoyable
film.
