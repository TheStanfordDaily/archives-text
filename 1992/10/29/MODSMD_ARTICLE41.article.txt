Brand New Heavies

Bonin', blunts and rhyme. With every
passing day, it seems the acceptance of hip
hop and b-boy culture increases ten-fold.
But while an increasing number of listen
ers want "EFX" or insist on jumping
"Around," many of the beat fiends responsi
ble for hooking up tracks as smooth as but
ter find themselves at odds with stingy artists
prepared to protect — at any cost — the mu
sical virtue of their original arrangements.
Fortunately, this salt hasn't soured hip
hop's flavor beyond repair. Instead, it has
forced the art form's proprietors to move in
new directions both technically and musi
cally.
In recent years, an increasing number of

hip-hoppers have turned to the synthesis of
dope rhymes, turntable wizardry and live
music in hopes of developing a rhythmical
alternative to sampling and drum machine
programming — with varied success.
The Brand New Heavies' latest album,
"Heavy Rhyme Experience: Vol. 1," will be
seen by most as one of the early successes of
this "unplugged" hip-hop movement.
Hailing from Britain, the Heavies first
hit the American market in 1991. On their
self-titled first album guitarist Simon
Bartholomew, bassist Andrew Levy, drum
mer Jim Kincaid and guest vocalist N'dea
Davenport served up 10 zesty plates of im
provisational jazz fused with gritty funk—
a sampling oasis in a wasteland of spent
Zap, James Brown, Meters and P-funk
loops.
The second album is as sound as the first,
and it features the capable rhyme skills of
artists like Main Source's large Professor,
Grand Puba, Dres of the Black Sheep and
Gang Starr's G.U.R.U. Nevertheless, the ma
jority of the album s 10 cuts lack the anchor
ing grooves necessary to pull them into the
realm of consummate party jams.

Though tracks like Main Source's
"Bonafide Funk" or Grand Puba's "Who
Makes the Loot," are sure to bring grins of
satisfaction to the faces of many, they don't
make you wanna get down.
Other cuts like Jamalski's "Jump n'
Move," Ed O.G.'s "Do Whatta I Gotta Do"
and Masta Ace's "Wake Me When I'm Dead"
have ideal tempos but aren't inventive with
their music.
The Heavies' faultless but repetitive ac
companiments detract a great deal from
each cut.
Though technically exceptional, their
music lacks what jazz bassist Ron Carter has
accomplished in his classic Tribe Called
Quest track, "Versus from the Abstract."
The Heavies give listeners nothing to
latch onto emotionally, reducing many of
their deliveries to something just a little
above robotic.
It might seem as if the Heavies' "Heavy
Rhyme Experience: Vol. 1" is practically
worthless to hip-hop listeners and acid jazz
fans alike. It's not. But the high expectations
of most fans will not be met.
