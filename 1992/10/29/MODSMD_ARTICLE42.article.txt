Not one, but dozens of Madon
nas, Dick Tracys and every other
creature imaginable flock to the Cas
tro on Halloween night to be part of
the surreal spectacle. With them goes
much of the gay community here at
Stanford, because they know that
nothing like this could ever happen
here.

Every year at its Halloween street fair, the
Castro and part of Market Street are blocked off
by police, and within a half-mile of the Castro
parking becomes impossible. A stage and sound

system are set up in the
middle of Market
Street for bands and
other outrageous per
formances. The San

Modesty, prudishness and good taste are energetically parodied.

From Castro to Greenwich Village to
Provincetown, gay enclaves are known for their
Halloween celebrations. For much of the gay
community Halloween is a symbolic throwing
aside of traditional dictates about what is "nor
mal" or "decent." Modesty, prudishness and good

taste are energetically parodied. The shocking
and the uncensored are the order of the day.
Many gay students in Stanford's suburban
environment are quick to take advantage of the
rebellious significance of Halloween. They make
their annual trip into Castro to celebrate in grand
fashion the importance of rejecting the ordinary.

"The Castro
knows how to have a
party right. It's just
insane," says Stan
ford junior Ben-

jamin Morgan, who is planning on attending this
Halloween. He and a group of his friends will
forego the Mausoleum and Stanford's other Hal
loween offerings.
Though he is still unsure, he is considering
dressing up as Jesus for the festivities: "1 might
make myself a crown of thorns — and of course
I'd have to grow my beard out."
Morgan's irreverence will fit right in with the
Castro scene. Traditionally, a brigade called "The
Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence" features rosary
swinging men in nun's outfits roller skating

about what is 'normal' or 'decent/

through the crowds all night. Besides countless
photo opportunities, the Sisters offer first aid in
the form of emergency hair spray for those drag
queens whose elaborate hairdos are flagging.
And the 'dos can be big. Marge Simpson was
one of the more popular costumes in the Castro
last Halloween and some of that blue hair reached

almost eight feet high. One particularly towering
coiffure even required a metal strut to keep aloft.
A saleswoman at Undercover — a popular
clothing store on Castro Street — predicts that
Marge Simpson will be out of style this year. In
stead, she says, "Lots of Peg Bundys. Of course,
lots of Madonnas too, but you always get those."
But as festive as this gender-twisting event
might seem, she has her complaints. "Being a girl
on Halloween at the Castro stinks; all of the
tourists think you're a drag queen and they try to
take your picture." With a sudden gesture to her
bosom, she asserts, "These are real"
As many people come to the Castro to marvel
at the spectacle as to participate. This voyeurism
extends far beyond the gay community as well:
"You never find more straight people in the Cas
tro than on Halloween night," Morgan claims.

But this spectacle does not come without
much preparation. Even a week before Halloween,
Castro street is buzzing with talk about the up
coming party. A woman in a polka-dot skirt and
fruit bowl hat k la Carmen Miranda does a brisk
business handing out flyers for a San Francisco
costume shop.

While people at Stanford are gearing up for
midterms, employees at Headlines are stocking up

on sequined bras. One
customer, paying for
his black boa and size
12 black pumps, has
come all the way from
Denver for the event.

of traditional dictates

When asked what his costume is going to be, he
has one word: "Fabulous."
Some Castro residents try to cash in on the
pre-Halloween rush with garage sales overflowing

with crino
lines, platform
shoes and
tacky jewelry.
One vendor
models a flow

ered apron, hiked up long-johns and hiking boots
for passers-by: "It's the slut-housewife look," he
explains.
Although many old-timers say they can go the
rest of their lives without seeing another body
builder in a dress, big men in little dresses are un
deniably the mainstay of a Castro Halloween.

The creativity
of the costumes
knows no bounds.
One salesman at a vari
ety store in the Castro
recalls one of the most
elaborate projects his

(U

store helped to create: a giant
sea anemone. "This guy must
have bought hundreds of yards

of sequin trim to make all of the tentacles," he
says."It turned out beautifully."
Eangelica Aton, a Stanford senior who will be
attending the event this year, is considering cross
dressing up. "1 can see myself as Charlie Chaplin
— something 1 wouldn't have the chance to do or
dinarily."
A Stanford student who attended the affair
last year says, "There was everything — just every
thing. The Mausoleum is just a party, but the Cas
tro is a show."
Indeed, many residents of the apartments on
Castro sit out on their balconies all night enter
taining people below. And last year, up above

them, a man
hanging dan
gerously off
of his fire es
cape stripped
all the way

down to a G-string.
One group of creative young men set out a
sign in their bay window showing their next show
time. Totally naked and covered with fluorescent
body paint, they gave a free dance show that
brought the crowds to a standstill.
Such showmanship at the Castro has many fer
vent devotees. One San Francisco resident comes
every year to take pictures. His favorite costume? A
few years ago, his friends dressed up as a drag pas
tiche of San Francisco. "One was Ms. Chinatown,
one was Ms. South-of-Market, and so on. This was
right after the earthquake, so Ms. Marina's make
up was all smeared and her hair was a disaster."
This year's turnout at the street fair is expect
ed to be even better than past years, because Hal
loween falls on a Saturday night. Many gay Stan

ford students
say they hope
that this means
Halloween at
the Castro will

be more outrageous than ever
because another Stanford
Halloween just won't cut it.
One student complains
that "the only thing at Stan
ford that's close to the Cas
tro Halloween is the Exotic Erot

ic — and it's not close at all."

and the uncensored
are the order of the day.
