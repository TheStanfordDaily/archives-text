If you haven't gotten your cos
tume together yet, a trip up to the
Castro would be well worth your
while. Notoriously offbeat to begin
with, Castro fashion becomes
downright bizarre come Hal
loween.
Headlines, a clothing and
novelty store, normally carries lots
of leather jackets and skimpy
shorts. But recently customers are
agog over the enormous strap-on
penises — ordered especially for
the season — that jut out into the
aisles.
For the less adventurous, one
Headlines employee suggested
blonde wigs as an attractive alter
native. "It's very Madonna."
More thrifty answers to the
costume question are stretched
across Castro sidewalks: garage
sales. Residents find that a Hal
loween yard sale is an ideal way to
get rid of their particularly tacky
items. Racks of musty dresses and
tables covered with garish hats
often contain the perfect outfit for

about $5.
On an appropriately morbid
note, one clothes peddler said, "We
get some of our best stuff from peo
ple who pass away."
If wearing a dead person's
clothes isn't what you had in mind
for Halloween, then make your
own costume. Cliffs Variety store
boasts every material the enter
prising costume designer might
need. One customer, buying yards
and yards of black-and-white vel
vet, explained that she and her
friends were going to be lesbian
cows this year.
In the hardware section of
Cliffs lie costume possibilities of a
different sort. Evoking a less pas
toral Halloween, chains of every
metal and thickness are available
by the yard — in order to achieve
the bondage look at minimal cost,
one employee explained.
But what about those who
want to get noticed on Halloween
without any expenditure at all?
"Just wear as little as possible," ad
vises a Cliff s customer. "That's as
cheap as it gets."
