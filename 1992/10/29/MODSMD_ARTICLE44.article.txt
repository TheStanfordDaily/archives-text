# Luscious love and lust...in the library?
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
People don't wear black bras for nothing.
There are black bra occasions, such as
going to meet your young up-and-coming
professor in the Coffee House for an insight
ful discussion on Third World development.
Hip Hop night, maybe. But the
library... .people don't wear black bras to
the library.
But as the packs of study-fiends head off
to Green after dinner, one must wonder if
French history books written in Russian
aren't the only thing being studied.
It's one thing to have that accomplished
feeling after finishing an econ problem set.
The high pro glow is another matter entirely.
In the library. Sex in the library. A shocking
thought indeed.
Being intimate in the library is an affront
to all that Stanford stands for: mocking the
serious student, doing things that would
make Res Ed blush and enjoying it, no less.
Frolicking amidst all those sweaty, leather
bound volumes of the masters, where at any
minute some grey-haired, grandmotherly li
brarian, or RF could come around the corner
and spectate.
But, for those adventurous students look
ing for a new experience that can't be packed
into a resume, sex in the library can be just
the thing to make a parent ashamed.
Green offers a wide variety of experiences,
from risky to private, all readily available to
the ID-card-bearing Stanford student. But
one must use imagination, for the phone
booth encounter is something grandparents
would do; and the elevator, though featuring
a helpful hand rail and carpet-padded walls,
unfortunately has no "close door" button,
except for the emergency lock.
Hands down, the third floor is the most
intriguing. This less-populated floor features
two emergency staircases leading to well-lit,
quietly-secluded, fully-carpeted play
grounds of passion.
Not to mention the foreboding, boarded
up, it's-almost-as-if-they-knew-what-you
had-come-there-for ramp leading to that
post-industrial experience located only foot

steps away from your third floor study carrel
â€” Old Green.
Old Green is a cold, metallic heaven on
earth. Though the ceilings are low and the air
is as stale as food service bagels, Old Green is
not just for crusty grad students anymore.
The sixth and seventh floors are Meccas for
that daring individual who holds the glow-in
the-dark plastic penis for the speaker at every
Safer Sex Shoppe dorm demonstration.
The top floor of Old Green, slightly less
populated by doctoral students looking for
pure silence, is home to a mind-boggling
array of locales catering to a variety of prefer
ences.
On the side of the building facing Meyer,
all the way on the left hand side, a brown file
cabinet providing a nice large surface area

about three feet off the ground brings images
of Mayan pyramids to mind. lust be careful
not to pull the fire alarm on the wall.
For a more isolated area, there is a nice, se
cluded, three-foot wide space behind the last
shelf in the left hand corner on the Cubberley
side of the library. The floor is a little cold,
but generally clean, providing a narrow, yet
comfortable place to test hip flexibility.
Unfortunately the bookshelf in the
220.88R/224T row is an unforgiving specta
tor, featuring old copies of the Holy Bible and
critiques of the different chapters.
Those who insist on the best Green has to
offer should scale the stairway on the Cub
berley side, coming to a dead end at what
must have led to the eighth floor earlier in the
century.

One almost feels faint at the sight. This
post-modern whitewashed world of wonder
boasts a huge wall to separate the stairs from
suspicious eyes. A Clockwork Orange-esque
blue collar industrial nightmare come alive.

Old Green is not just for
crusty grad students
anymore.

There are white painted bars enclosing the
spacious platform, just the right size for a good
grip. But be careful the bars are a little slick,
and leather gloves are advisable to avoid taking
the 20-foot drop to the library floor.
At the top of the aforementioned staircase is
a door which appears too big for the doorjam
leading to the Armageddon room, a breathtak
ing alternative for those in search of risk. This
magical door leads to a small work platform
with a non-slide floor for extra traction, com
bined with open wire work for that air of dan
ger. Be careful not to roll off the platform and
plunge into the flimsy acoustic tiles below.
For those with no shame, or a friend will
ing to play lookout, the most mouth-water
ing location is the criss-crossing staircase
leading from the sixth to the seventh floor.
The stairs are bordered by a 20-foot long,
slick, splinter-firee shelf which could serve
multiple purposes, not to mention fit several
consenting adults.
The handrails for the staircase add to the
possibilities. Not to worry, acrobatic types:
the chalky, white paint doesn't come off on
the back of your knees. The bars, stairs, shelf
and floor create multi-level prospects. And
the low hanging metal support beams are
covered with foam pads, as if the library de
signers had your safety in mind.
Green is the perfect nighttime getaway for
those looking for a change of pace. So next
time those parents urge you to, "Do us a favor
... hit the library," seize the day.
