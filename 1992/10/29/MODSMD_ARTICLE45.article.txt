## Fortune cookies and fun in Chinatown

Ever had an urge to worship the
deified general Gwan Dei? Or to
read French adult fortune cookies?
How about losing your tuition to
Chinese card sharks in Portsmouth
Square?
If you feel yourself culturally
lacking or dim-sum-experience de
prived, then take a trip to China
town. Start your tour in colorful
Portsmouth Square, around which
Chinatown and San Francisco, for
that matter, were built.
If you are diplomatic enough in
your entrance to the Square, you
can gamble with — and lose much
money to — old Chinese men play
ing poker, chess or cards. That is,
after you've watched their morning
tai chi.
At the Ten Ren Tea house on
Grant street you can learn the com
plexities of the Chinese tea ritual,
which involves using a special clay
Yi-Xang pot that helps protect the
tea against bitterness. While there
you may want to try some free sam
ples of teas that, depending on your
choice, will extend your life, ease
your pregnancy or grant you fertility.
Near the tea shop is Waverly
Street, called the street of colored
balconies because, well, it has col
ored balconies. The street, and
much of Chinatown is flooded with
red, a color that is supposed to ward
off evil spirits.
Chinatown, though adept at
maintaining its cultural indepen

dence, is not immune to the Finan
cial District. The Kong Chow tem
ple, for example, was moved to the
fourth floor of 855 Stockton Street
from Pine Street by an attractive
offer from the Hartford Insurance
Company.
The temple is the oldest of its
kind in the United States and is
filled with carvings and artifacts
donated by worshipers. Incense is
usually burning, and people leave
food offerings to Tian How, god
dess of the sea and protector of
sailors.
The highlight of the temple is its
fortune sticks: the custodian of the
temple will interpret the number
marked on the stick that falls out of
a bag when you shake it. M rs. Harry
S. Truman came here during the
1948 election at a time when her
husband's popularity was at a low.
The sticks, as attested by a sign on
the wall, predicted her husband's
election.
Chinatown is filled with such
stories — contrasts of history and
culture, piety and commercialism.
Not far from Mrs. Truman's story
and the burning incense are adver
tisements for 'Dieter's special Tea,'
with no preservatives and a guaran
teed longer life.
Fortune cookies, long thought
to be an authentic Chinese institu
tion, were actually invented in San
Francisco. Some of the tastiest can
be found at Golden Gate Fortune
Cookies, in Ross Alley. The newest
fortune cookie fad is the "French

Adult fortune cookie." These X
rated treats are twice the price of
your average fortune cookie —
four dollars a pound — and are ru
mored to be great at parties.
If you're interested in Chinese
medicinal herbs and teas, the Chi
nese Herbs and Native Produce
Company at 622 Broadway is a
health bonanza and a veritable
warehouse for traditional Chinese
doctors.
On the premises almost every
day is a doctor who practices both
Chinese and Western medicine.
Get your ginseng there. But re
member, as wise shop owners will

tell you, if your nose starts to bleed
while you're drinking ginseng tea,
it's time to move down to a less po
tent ginseng.
To walk down the streets of Chi
natown on a busy weekend day is to
participate in a massive food fren
zy. As the variety of food stores tell
you, the Chinese diet is expansive.
If you want your food fresh, like the
Chinese do, some stores sell live an
imals. And every corner has a gen
eral food store selling "thousand
year old duck eggs," dried seaweed
or roasted quail to go.
Some dining highlights from
Chinatown include the King Tin

restaurant at 826 Washington
Street, an inexpensive Cantonese
restaurant with noodles that beat
the Tea House at Stanford. Try their
"wor mein" with star-shaped anise
flavored beef tendons.
For the age-old student staple of
stir-fry, go to the Wok Shop at 718
Grant Avenue, featuring technologi
cally-advanced flat-bottomed woks.
You can buy cheap trinkets virtu
ally anywhere. Chinese "kung fu"
slippers are always in, and you can
usually find them for about $2. In the
Chinese Trade Center, lose yourself
among the three floors of jewelry,
linen, clothing and souvenirs.

Chinatown's Portsmouth Square is the hub of all kinds of activities. Old men play chess on an upper level
terrace as children play below.

If you want your food fresh, like the
Chinese do, some stores sell live an
imals. And every corner has a gen
eral food store selling "thousand
year old duck eggs," dried seaweed
or roasted quail to go.
Some dining highlights from
Chinatown include the King Tin

restaurant at 826 Washington
Street, an inexpensive Cantonese
restaurant with noodles that beat
the Tea House at Stanford. Try their
"wor mein" with star-shaped anise
flavored beef tendons.
For the age-old student staple of
stir-fry, go to the Wok Shop at 718
Grant Avenue, featuring technologi
cally-advanced flat-bottomed woks.
You can buy cheap trinkets virtu
ally anywhere. Chinese "kung fu"
slippers are always in, and you can
usually find them for about $2. In the
Chinese Trade Center, lose yourself
among the three floors of jewelry,
linen, clothing and souvenirs.

Chinatown's Portsmouth Square is the hub of all kinds of activities. Old men play chess on an upper level
terrace as children play below.
Ever had an urge to worship the
deified general Gwan Dei? Or to
read French adult fortune cookies?
How about losing your tuition to
Chinese card sharks in Portsmouth
Square?
If you feel yourself culturally
lacking or dim-sum-experience de
prived, then take a trip to China
town. Start your tour in colorful
Portsmouth Square, around which
Chinatown and San Francisco, for
that matter, were built.
If you are diplomatic enough in
your entrance to the Square, you
can gamble with — and lose much
money to — old Chinese men play
ing poker, chess or cards. That is,
after you've watched their morning
tai chi.
At the Ten Ren Tea house on
Grant street you can learn the com
plexities of the Chinese tea ritual,
which involves using a special clay
Yi-Xang pot that helps protect the
tea against bitterness. While there
you may want to try some free sam
ples of teas that, depending on your
choice, will extend your life, ease
your pregnancy or grant you fertility.
Near the tea shop is Waverly
Street, called the street of colored
balconies because, well, it has col
ored balconies. The street, and
much of Chinatown is flooded with
red, a color that is supposed to ward
off evil spirits.
Chinatown, though adept at
maintaining its cultural indepen

dence, is not immune to the Finan
cial District. The Kong Chow tem
ple, for example, was moved to the
fourth floor of 855 Stockton Street
from Pine Street by an attractive
offer from the Hartford Insurance
Company.
The temple is the oldest of its
kind in the United States and is
filled with carvings and artifacts
donated by worshipers. Incense is
usually burning, and people leave
food offerings to Tian How, god
dess of the sea and protector of
sailors.
The highlight of the temple is its
fortune sticks: the custodian of the
temple will interpret the number
marked on the stick that falls out of
a bag when you shake it. M rs. Harry
S. Truman came here during the
1948 election at a time when her
husband's popularity was at a low.
The sticks, as attested by a sign on
the wall, predicted her husband's
election.
Chinatown is filled with such
stories — contrasts of history and
culture, piety and commercialism.
Not far from Mrs. Truman's story
and the burning incense are adver
tisements for 'Dieter's special Tea,'
with no preservatives and a guaran
teed longer life.
Fortune cookies, long thought
to be an authentic Chinese institu
tion, were actually invented in San
Francisco. Some of the tastiest can
be found at Golden Gate Fortune
Cookies, in Ross Alley. The newest
fortune cookie fad is the "French

Adult fortune cookie." These X
rated treats are twice the price of
your average fortune cookie —
four dollars a pound — and are ru
mored to be great at parties.
If you're interested in Chinese
medicinal herbs and teas, the Chi
nese Herbs and Native Produce
Company at 622 Broadway is a
health bonanza and a veritable
warehouse for traditional Chinese
doctors.
On the premises almost every
day is a doctor who practices both
Chinese and Western medicine.
Get your ginseng there. But re
member, as wise shop owners will

tell you, if your nose starts to bleed
while you're drinking ginseng tea,
it's time to move down to a less po
tent ginseng.
To walk down the streets of Chi
natown on a busy weekend day is to
participate in a massive food fren
zy. As the variety of food stores tell
you, the Chinese diet is expansive.
