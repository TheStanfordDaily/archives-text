# Sex made soporific
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
Madonna has done the impossible. She
has taken sex — in all its most interesting,
perverse, curiosity-arousing forms — and made it
boring. Her new book, "Sex," is a parody of bad
pornography, and it's not even a good parody.
Without the oil-slicked look of the L.A.-grown in
dustry, the book becomes a set of annoyingly repetitive
tableaus of white trash having sex in public — more
often than not with punks. In fact, there are more bald,
over-body-pierced lesbians in her book than at a San
dra Bernhardt concert.
And where the book doesn't bore, it offends. A full
page shot shows Madonna being raped by two cheery
punk males. Another shows her bound with a knife to
her crotch, as two bald lesbians snarl for the camera.
On the facing page, under the guise of her alter ego,
faux-dominatrix Dita Parlo, Madonna writes, "I think
for the most part if women are in an abusive relationship
and they know it and they stay in it, they must be digging
it." Madonna — a feminist?
The attractively designed, but often impossible-to
decipher text, reads like a well-edited but-equally-un
creative Penthouse Forum letter. By the middle of the
book, it gets so tiresome it's hard to get through.
But the essays may have more in them than the pho
tographs. As she spastically runs through trope after
trope without any more context than the crucifixes in
her videos, the text, often written in Ralph Stead
manesque handwriting, reveals a bit more:
" It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and

full of life. I love my pussy, it Is
the complete summation of

my life. It's the place
v where all the most

painful tilings have

"Sex" is cleaning house,
but unfortunately it's Madonna's
own house, and the mess ain't
pretty. Evoking more pity than sex

happened."

uality, she poses with an old, fatherly-looking man,
while dressed in a frilly pedophile-inviting skirt.
And if all of that wasn't painful enough, you have to
see Vanilla Ice receiving oral sex from a very sexual
looking blonde. Naomi Campbell, Isabella Rossellini
and Big Daddy Kane also appear, but, unlike the Ice
Man, they make for some of the more impressive pho
tos in the book.
For the most part, however, Steven Meisel's photog
raphy is a letdown. Other than one very striking picture
of Madonna with a dog, the book could be scrapped.
And taking all the other pages out of the metal
binding wouldn't be all that difficult for those so
minded, because "Sex" is bound worse than your
third-grade book report.
On the first day of its release, a club in San Jose
charged its patrons $ 1 to look at a copy of the book for
60 seconds. Instead of freeing us, Madonna has sent us
back to the second grade, behind the school house,
bargaining with Susie Wilson for a "peek."
The peck we get, again and again and again, is in
fact of Madonna's second grade sexuality, and its
often-disturbing effects on her adult sexuality. Instead
of turning us on, they make us sad, then bored and
then bitter about the $55 she swindled.
