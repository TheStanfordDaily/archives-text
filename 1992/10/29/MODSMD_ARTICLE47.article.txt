The grill was a good idea.
Late-night pizza was a good idea.
Candy, frozen-yogurt, cappucino, this
"juice for humans" stuff — all good ideas.
But what students are clamoring for — and
going to places like Tresidder Express and
Mud and Bolts to get — is Snapple.
Although they'd be sure to charge us 2.50

"points" per bottle, we'd sure like to sink our
gullet into one of those mint ice-teas.
Food service has tried to put its finger on
the campus' palatial pulse again and again.
But the gestalt of the twentysomething food
culture turns more rapidly than their meat
loaf, and if they want to stay on top of it,
they're going to have to start doing some,

good, old-fashioned research.
Snapple is the drink of the '90s, and,
damnit, we're the kids of the '90s. We deserve
no less.
It might even make the "nutty spaghetti"
go down easier.
Maybe not.
