"The Duchess of Malfidirected by Drama
PhD student Judith Dolan and starring senior
Krista Hoeppner, plays on the Memorial Auditori
um stage at 8 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday,
Nov. 4-7 and Nov. 11-14.
If you go, you'll be on stage too, literally. The
audience gets to watch all the violence and eroti
cism of this Jacobean tragedy while sitting on the
stage in church pews.
Bertolt Brecht's adaptation of John Webster's
original "Duchess" explores the sexual politics of
the 17th century with a tale of incest, insanity and
corruption.
Tickets for "Duchess" cost $5 for students and
are available at Tresidder or at the door.
