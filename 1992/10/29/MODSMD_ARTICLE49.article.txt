For those of you who always wondered what it
would be like to see Elton John, Neil Young, James
Taylor — and Pearl Jam — perform together on
the same stage, here's your chance.
The Sixth Annual Bridge School Benefit at Shore
line Amphitheatre is Nov. 1, at 7 p.m. And if you're
overwhelmed with guilt about wasting more of your
money on just another concert, while there are so
many disabled children in the world who aren't as
lucky as yourself, rest your conscience. Remember that
proceeds from this concert go to help those children.
And they'll probably be at the concert too.
