# From protests to programming
## After King verdict fervor, coalition develops mentor program 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Despite a storm of protest and ac
tivism on campus in the days following
the Rodney King beating verdict, many
believed the rage would die and Stan
ford would once again forget about East
Palo Alto and the racial problems in the
world beyond the ivory tower.
But a small core of volunteers has not
forgotten, and has quietly built up a pro
gram to help East Palo Alto youth im
prove their practical and educational
skills.
The Stanford volunteers have
formed the Community Action Coali
tion and have created a comprehensive
program to help high school students.
The program is based on a pre-existing
job training program — Students Offer
ing Alternative Realities (SOAR) — and

organizers added tutoring, mentoring
and extra-curricular components to it.
"The Knowledge Sharing Program,"
as the effort is called, currently works
with about 20 kids and is growing, said
senior Tracy Clay, a leader of the coali
tion. "Every day there is a whole new set
of kids getting involved" because com
munity organizations are recommend
ing students to the program.
"I don't think we could have gotten
the initial support without the initial
events of the Rodney King verdict and
the aftermath," she said. "But that kind
of commitment you can find in any com
munity of color at Stanford."
Three days a week, the students come
to Stanford for academic tutoring with
more than 30 tutors, said Clay. During a
fourth day, students participate in one of
four extracurricular activities.
The program features a strong men

toring component. "I try and emphasize
a lot of the mentoring skills that are
usually lost in the academic tutoring. I
try to teach life skills," said Jim Shelton,
a tutor in the program.
But the academic tutoring alone cre
ates a mentor situation, said Clay. "Peo
ple are developing personal relationships
because students need help with certain
areas and work with those tutors."
Although the mentoring is signifi
cant, providing the students with jobs
may be the most important aspect of the
program, said Assoc. Dean of Memorial
Church Floyd Thompkins, who serves as
an adviser and fund-raiser to the group.
"It's a can't-miss program. The
unique part is not the tutoring. . . . It's
the work part, the private employers
that donate a few hours a week," he said.
