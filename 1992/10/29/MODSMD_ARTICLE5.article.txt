# From protests to programming
## After King verdict fervor, coalition develops mentor program 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Despite a storm of protest and ac
tivism on campus in the days following
the Rodney King beating verdict, many
believed the rage would die and Stan
ford would once again forget about East
Palo Alto and the racial problems in the
world beyond the ivory tower.
But a small core of volunteers has not
forgotten, and has quietly built up a pro
gram to help East Palo Alto youth im
prove their practical and educational
skills.
The Stanford volunteers have
formed the Community Action Coali
tion and have created a comprehensive
program to help high school students.
The program is based on a pre-existing
job training program — Students Offer
ing Alternative Realities (SOAR) — and

organizers added tutoring, mentoring
and extra-curricular components to it.
"The Knowledge Sharing Program,"
as the effort is called, currently works
with about 20 kids and is growing, said
senior Tracy Clay, a leader of the coali
tion. "Every day there is a whole new set
of kids getting involved" because com
munity organizations are recommend
ing students to the program.
"I don't think we could have gotten
the initial support without the initial
events of the Rodney King verdict and
the aftermath," she said. "But that kind
of commitment you can find in any com
munity of color at Stanford."
Three days a week, the students come
to Stanford for academic tutoring with
more than 30 tutors, said Clay. During a
fourth day, students participate in one of
four extracurricular activities.
The program features a strong men

toring component. "I try and emphasize
a lot of the mentoring skills that are
usually lost in the academic tutoring. I
try to teach life skills," said Jim Shelton,
a tutor in the program.
But the academic tutoring alone cre
ates a mentor situation, said Clay. "Peo
ple are developing personal relationships
because students need help with certain
areas and work with those tutors."
Although the mentoring is signifi
cant, providing the students with jobs
may be the most important aspect of the
program, said Assoc. Dean of Memorial
Church Floyd Thompkins, who serves as
an adviser and fund-raiser to the group.
"It's a can't-miss program. The
unique part is not the tutoring. . . . It's
the work part, the private employers
that donate a few hours a week," he said.
"It teaches the kids the skills they
will need for jobs after high
school. It exposes them to work
ing-class values."
Andrew Hartwell, the director
of Bayshore Associated Min
istries, said he has worked with
three students participating in
the program and feels the
employment aspect of the pro
gram has benefitted them great
ly-
"lt was the first real job expe
rience they had. It was just real
helpful in getting them the
opportunity to work," he said.
"They appreciated all of the addi
tional meetings to discuss their
jobs."
Thompkins said the program
benefits the kids by bolstering
their self-confidence.
"Students and kids who have
work tend to believe in their abili
ty to work. Those who have not
worked tend not to believe in
work. Putting the tutoring on top

of that real-world experience
teaches them something unique,"
he said.
In addition, the program places
a strong emphasis on communi
cating with parents, and parent
tutor meetings are scheduled
before the end of the year, said
Clay.
The coordinators of the pro
gram have received "an outpour
ing of calls from parents saying
'thank you' because their kids are
coming home with a purpose,"
said SOAR coordinator A.J.
Robinson.
"We need the parents to follow
up and to say 'why aren't you at
tutoring?'.. . We want to empow
er not only the students, but also
the parents," he said.
A unique part of the program
is the extracurricular activities
which include a drama group, a
college preparatory class, a news
paper project and a community
service project, said Clay.
"What the extracurricular
parts stress is that they have to
give back to the community," said
Robinson. "These programs are
run by the students and they can

see now that it's about helping
yourself.
"We are realistic in what we
think we can achieve. If a student
is behind in classes, the alterna
tive reality may be counseling and
graduation," he said. "We want
kids to see they have other choic
es than dropping out."
The program gives students "a
rigorous schedule that gives them
academic and emotional support.
It keeps them out of trouble," he
added.
"I think every little bit helps.
There are so many programs in
East Palo Alto designed to keep
youth in school. We'll be part of
an important trend," said Clay.
"With our help they'll possibly
stay in school. With our help,
they'll possibly look at college as
an option. With our help they'll
build up their self-esteem," she
said.
But in the end, Clay said the
program is all about community
relationships. "The connection
that we made between Stanford
and the community is important.
We asked what their need was
and we're trying to fill it."

The program is based on a pre-existing
job training program — Students Offer
ing Alternative Realities (SOAR) — and

organizers added tutoring, mentoring
and extra-curricular components to it.
"The Knowledge Sharing Program,"
as the effort is called, currently works
with about 20 kids and is growing, said
senior Tracy Clay, a leader of the coali
tion. "Every day there is a whole new set
of kids getting involved" because com
munity organizations are recommend
ing students to the program.
"I don't think we could have gotten
the initial support without the initial
events of the Rodney King verdict and
the aftermath," she said. "But that kind
of commitment you can find in any com
munity of color at Stanford."
Three days a week, the students come
to Stanford for academic tutoring with
more than 30 tutors, said Clay. During a
fourth day, students participate in one of
four extracurricular activities.
The program features a strong men

toring component. "I try and emphasize
a lot of the mentoring skills that are
usually lost in the academic tutoring. I
try to teach life skills," said Jim Shelton,
a tutor in the program.
But the academic tutoring alone cre
ates a mentor situation, said Clay. "Peo
ple are developing personal relationships
because students need help with certain
areas and work with those tutors."
Although the mentoring is signifi
cant, providing the students with jobs
may be the most important aspect of the
program, said Assoc. Dean of Memorial
Church Floyd Thompkins, who serves as
an adviser and fund-raiser to the group.
"It's a can't-miss program. The
unique part is not the tutoring. . . . It's
the work part, the private employers
that donate a few hours a week," he said.
"It teaches the kids the skills they
will need for jobs after high
school. It exposes them to work
ing-class values."
Andrew Hartwell, the director
of Bayshore Associated Min
istries, said he has worked with
three students participating in
the program and feels the
employment aspect of the pro
gram has benefitted them great
ly-
"lt was the first real job expe
rience they had. It was just real
helpful in getting them the
opportunity to work," he said.
"They appreciated all of the addi
tional meetings to discuss their
jobs."
Thompkins said the program
benefits the kids by bolstering
their self-confidence.
"Students and kids who have
work tend to believe in their abili
ty to work. Those who have not
worked tend not to believe in
work. Putting the tutoring on top

of that real-world experience
teaches them something unique,"
he said.
In addition, the program places
a strong emphasis on communi
cating with parents, and parent
tutor meetings are scheduled
before the end of the year, said
Clay.
The coordinators of the pro
gram have received "an outpour
ing of calls from parents saying
'thank you' because their kids are
coming home with a purpose,"
said SOAR coordinator A.J.
Robinson.
"We need the parents to follow
up and to say 'why aren't you at
tutoring?'.. . We want to empow
er not only the students, but also
the parents," he said.
A unique part of the program
is the extracurricular activities
which include a drama group, a
college preparatory class, a news
paper project and a community
service project, said Clay.
"What the extracurricular
parts stress is that they have to
give back to the community," said
Robinson. "These programs are
run by the students and they can

see now that it's about helping
yourself.
"We are realistic in what we
think we can achieve. If a student
is behind in classes, the alterna
tive reality may be counseling and
graduation," he said. "We want
kids to see they have other choic
es than dropping out."
The program gives students "a
rigorous schedule that gives them
academic and emotional support.
It keeps them out of trouble," he
added.
"I think every little bit helps.
There are so many programs in
East Palo Alto designed to keep
youth in school. We'll be part of
an important trend," said Clay.
"With our help they'll possibly
stay in school. With our help,
they'll possibly look at college as
an option. With our help they'll
build up their self-esteem," she
said.
But in the end, Clay said the
program is all about community
relationships. "The connection
that we made between Stanford
and the community is important.
We asked what their need was
and we're trying to fill it."
Despite a storm of protest and ac
tivism on campus in the days following
the Rodney King beating verdict, many
believed the rage would die and Stan
ford would once again forget about East
Palo Alto and the racial problems in the
world beyond the ivory tower.
But a small core of volunteers has not
forgotten, and has quietly built up a pro
gram to help East Palo Alto youth im
prove their practical and educational
skills.
The Stanford volunteers have
formed the Community Action Coali
tion and have created a comprehensive
program to help high school students.
The program is based on a pre-existing
job training program — Students Offer
ing Alternative Realities (SOAR) — and

organizers added tutoring, mentoring
and extra-curricular components to it.
