# Guilt trip for the apathetic
## 
### 
If the pen is mightier than the sword, a
few presidential candidates are in for some
big paper cuts. Witty politically incorrect
comics along with shocking statistics about
the surprising apathy of our generation will
be exhibited on the second floor of Tresid
der, Oct. 26 until Election Day, as part of
Details Magazine's "Don't waste the power:
Vote!" exhibit.
Take advantage of this opportunity to
exercise your ability to choose; not since
Axess have you had so much power to really
mess with your future.
