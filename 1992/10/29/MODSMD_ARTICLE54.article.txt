# Don't vote, get busy
## 
### 
Somewhere, deep inside, where
the hearty lasagna meets the
walnut loaf, I hope Ross Perot
wins.
I want to see the panicked, sick
ened look on Dan Rather's face as
he rips those things out of his ear
and gets Letterman-dose to the
camera, sputtering, "Good God,
are you people finally satisfied? Do
you want to send me back to 60
minutes? 1 didn't go through 'Nam
for this. I'll kill Andy Rooney and
then I'll find each and every one of
you who ..."
Because I'm sick of this whole
presidential election thing. I don't
want to hear about polls, projec
tions or this seedy Matalin-Carville
affair. I know more about the inside
of Gennifer Flowers than what this
deficit thing actually does — other
than raise the ugly specter of buy
ing loaves of bread by rolling
wheelbarrows of colorful "Mickey
Dollars" into Mike Ovitz's office.
I'm sick of this ingeniously or
chestrated guilt trip the entire na
tion is laying on us young folk.
Sure, we may not vote, but we voice
ourselves in plenty of important
ways. We rent movies instead of
waiting for cable. We grow ugly fa
cial hair. And we single-handedly
created and recreated Aaron
Spelling. All our parents did was
throw one good concert. I'm not
impressed.
I realized things were awry this
summer, while waiting for the
adrenaline rush that seemed to
come whenever that "Life is a High
way" song came on.
I was still fantasizing about that
cartoon guy who smashes into
doorjambs in the A-Ha video, when
a public service spot came on. And
there was no sign of David Crosby
stifling giggles during an anti-drug
speech.
Instead, I was told to Rock the
Vote. Which, to be honest, sounded
very exciting, though requiring way
too much energy compared to
camping out in front of some good
repeats of "Real World."
But then, right after the virgin
girl tried to come on to Kevin, I got
angry. MTV was telling me to vote.
This from the people who brought
back a regressive poll tax through
"smash" or "trash."
My whole life I got this same,
mindlessly didactic "Go vote" mes
sage. In sixth-grade, before I could
perform many of the functions
normally associated with man
hood, my Civics teacher told us if
we didn't vote we would forfeit our
right to complain. There's no more
effective scare tactic on a class of
Jewish 13-year-olds. Except maybe
trying to mess with their post Bar-
Mitzvah trust-funds.
And as mature as it might seem
to go into a booth, close a curtain
behind you and pull down a lever

— even though you know there's
absolutely no chance of a nude
woman dancing in front of you —
there is absolutely nothing ma
ture about the presidential cam
paigns.
Campaign organizers and
Christian missionaries both be
lieve that one simple psychologi
cal principle is the key to control
ling the American psyche: "If this
many people — people who drive
cars — believe in this Christ/Clin
ton/Dancing Bears Trinity, then
maybe I should too."
Voting is designed to make
you apathetic. Revolution is
somehow rendered ineffec
tive if you feel included in choosing
who gets to look down Georgette
Mosbacher's dress at Washington
parties.
By giving you a choice, even if it's
just between two Yalies, you get that
false sense of power you normally
only associate with making Mario
bang his head against large steel
girders.
So don't vote. Come Nov. 3, find
someone who is planning on voting
for the other guy, hang out for the
day, argue about politics, share
some beers and make sure no one
leaves the house. Not only will you
increase country unity, but we'll all
get the results that much quicker.
Instead of wasting your time
digging up Arkansas newspapers
about Bill Clinton's unrelenting
fight for underpaid chicken-mur
dering jobs, do something con
structive with your time.
Take whatever it is that's impor
tant to you — whether its parental
gun control, keeping abortion off
our streets or making sure that
Kevin Costner/Whitney Houston
movie never makes it out of the stu
dio — and do something about it.
Build a house with Jimmy Carter.
Buy a semi-automatic rifle. What
ever it takes.
Men go crazy in congregations,
but only get better one by one.
I'm taking Clinton and giving
120 electoral votes.
