# Incentive or quick fix?

Capitalizing on widespread public dis
satisfaction with incumbent legislators,
supporters of Proposition 164 say the mea
sure, which would limit the terms of Cali
fornia's Senators and Representatives, is a
way to make elected officials more respon
sive to the needs of their constituents.
But opponents argue that the proposi
tion is a poorly constructed "quick fix"
that actually would decrease the power
and responsibility of the state's delega
tion in Washington.
The measure, if passed, would limit the
number of times incumbents could run
for re-election.

Members of the House of Representa
tives who had served six of the previous 11
years or Senators who had served 12 of
the previous 17 years would be prohibited
from placing their names on the ballot.
The bill does allow those prospective can
didates to mount write-in campaigns.
The proposition follows a statewide
term-limiting initiative, Proposition 140,
which was approved by voters in 1990.
The measure set lifetime term limits for
state legislators and most elected officials
in Sacramento.
"We believe that in order for the gov
ernment to be for the people we must have
new ideas. We believe in bringing in fresh

ideas and the only way to do that is to bring
in fresh people," said sophomore Anthony
Westerfield, vice-chair of the College Re
publicans.
Many feel the term-limitation move
ment is drawing its strength from anger
over recent scandals, such as those involv
ing the House bank and post office. But op
ponents argue that the proposition will not
accomplish the supporters' intended goals.
Roy Heatley, media director for the
"No on 164" campaign, says the measure
will effectively reduce California's politi
cal clout in Washington, D.C.
"The net effect of this will be to reduce
California's impact in Congress," Heatley
said. "It important we retain what senior
ity we have . . . because we have the
biggest population in the nation as well as
the largest delegation.
"If this passes, California will become
emasculated as far as its power in Wash
ington is concerned," he added.
Opponents further argue that term
limits will give more power to non-elected
congressional staff members
"It's like the movie 'Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington' when he asks his secretary
how to launch a filibuster," Heatley said.
"It's going to be putting more power in
the hands of people who are not elected."
But supporters of the proposition don't
agree that the state will lose its promi
nence in Congress.
"The argument that it will take the
juice away from California is garbage. We
have no real power now," said Tim Cary,
executive director of "Citizens for Term
Limits."
Although the Stanford Democrats
have not officially discussed the proposi
tion, co-chair Andrew Byrnes said he is
personally against term limits.
"The unfortunate thing ... is that it
