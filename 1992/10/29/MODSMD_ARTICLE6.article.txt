# Incentive or quick fix?
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Rajiv Chandrasekaran Staff writers 
Capitalizing on widespread public dis
satisfaction with incumbent legislators,
supporters of Proposition 164 say the mea
sure, which would limit the terms of Cali
fornia's Senators and Representatives, is a
way to make elected officials more respon
sive to the needs of their constituents.
But opponents argue that the proposi
tion is a poorly constructed "quick fix"
that actually would decrease the power
and responsibility of the state's delega
tion in Washington.
The measure, if passed, would limit the
number of times incumbents could run
for re-election.

Members of the House of Representa
tives who had served six of the previous 11
years or Senators who had served 12 of
the previous 17 years would be prohibited
from placing their names on the ballot.
The bill does allow those prospective can
didates to mount write-in campaigns.
The proposition follows a statewide
term-limiting initiative, Proposition 140,
which was approved by voters in 1990.
The measure set lifetime term limits for
state legislators and most elected officials
in Sacramento.
"We believe that in order for the gov
ernment to be for the people we must have
new ideas. We believe in bringing in fresh

ideas and the only way to do that is to bring
in fresh people," said sophomore Anthony
Westerfield, vice-chair of the College Re
publicans.
Many feel the term-limitation move
ment is drawing its strength from anger
over recent scandals, such as those involv
ing the House bank and post office. But op
ponents argue that the proposition will not
accomplish the supporters' intended goals.
Roy Heatley, media director for the
"No on 164" campaign, says the measure
will effectively reduce California's politi
cal clout in Washington, D.C.
"The net effect of this will be to reduce
California's impact in Congress," Heatley
said. "It important we retain what senior
ity we have . . . because we have the
biggest population in the nation as well as
the largest delegation.
"If this passes, California will become
emasculated as far as its power in Wash
ington is concerned," he added.
Opponents further argue that term
limits will give more power to non-elected
congressional staff members
"It's like the movie 'Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington' when he asks his secretary
how to launch a filibuster," Heatley said.
"It's going to be putting more power in
the hands of people who are not elected."
But supporters of the proposition don't
agree that the state will lose its promi
nence in Congress.
"The argument that it will take the
juice away from California is garbage. We
have no real power now," said Tim Cary,
executive director of "Citizens for Term
Limits."
Although the Stanford Democrats
have not officially discussed the proposi
tion, co-chair Andrew Byrnes said he is
personally against term limits.
"The unfortunate thing ... is that it

has been billed as a quick fix, a
sweeping way to get at the group
as a whole," said Byrnes.
"I think a lot of people will
vote for this and still vote for
their incumbent, because this
seems to be a way to get at
Congress as a whole."
Byrnes argues that the propo
sition would restrict voters even
more than candidates.
He said the bill "will take away
the power of voters. I think vot
ers should be able to vote for
whomever they want to, whenev
er they want to. It seems to me
the best term limit is going out
and voting.
"It's sort of making the voter's
decision for them. You know that
even if you don't vote your repre

sentation will change," he said.
"It seems to me another rationale
to vote is removed."
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody said there will probably be
120 new members of Congress
this year without term limits.
"There is turnover without
term limitations. The way to
affect turnover is to increase the
quality of challengers," he said.
The way to improve competi
tion is to find challengers with
political experience and funding,
he added.
"Federal financing of elections
would be a much better way to
level the playing field," Brody
said. "But it's easier to write a
term limit than finance regula
tions."
The concept of term limits
does enjoy the support from two
local Congressional candidates
who are each hoping to make the
next two years their first term in

Washington.
Republican candidate Tom
Huening said it is "almost impos
sible to up « it an incumbent. I
think term limits are a kind of
blunt instrument for gaining
some competition on the federal
level. With term limitations, peri
odically there won't be an incum
bent."
Democratic candidate Anna
Eshoo says she sees both sides of
the issue and has no problem
with term limits correctly tai
lored to individual offices.
Term limitations "can provide
the opportunity for new ideas,
new people, all that," said Eshoo.
But at the same time, term
limitations could cause the state
to lose the service of good people,
she said.
Opponents question whether
the proposition has the ability
improve the dedication of elected
officials to their constituency.

Brody argues that the desire
for re-election forces legislators
to please their constituents.
"One of the reasons people are
re-elected is that they serve their
constituencies. If I have a prob
lem with immigration or income
tax ... it's often the case that my
representative will check into
that for me. That's what a lot of
the life of a member of Congress
is taken up with," he said.
"It's not done for altruistic
reasons, but it's a way represen
tatives serve their constituen
cy."
But others see incumbency in
a different light.
"Your Congressperson
doesn't sit there all the time
wondering about being re-elect
ed," said Westerfield. "If you
have a term limit, the represen
tative will be considering more of
California's needs than their
own needs.

"Most of the people caught in
the mail scandal and the banking
scandal were career politicians,"
he said.
Term limitations, argues
Huening, will encourage more
qualified candidates to run for
office.
"If we have a well-functioning
system in Congress, people will
be willing to interrupt their
careers (to run for political
office)," he said. Such a change
would spell the end of "career"
politicians, he argued.
But Brody sees a positive
side to long-term politicians.
"The things that keeps them
getting re-elected is service to
their district," said Brody. "The
more powerful their position on
the right committee, the more
they can serve their con
stituents."
In addition to California, term
limits are on the ballot in 13

other states. But even if they
pass, they are likely to be tested
in the courts before becoming
law.
"Most Constitutional scholars
believe it would be unconstitu
tional for a state to pass a
restriction on federal offices.
Only the Congress or the Consti
tution can set those restric
tions," said Political Science
Prof. David Brady.
He said he believes the propo
sition will pass, but will eventu
ally be struck down by the
courts.
But Cary said his group is
determined to get reforms enact
ed, even if it means a protracted
legal battle.
"(After this passes) the next
hurdle will be to prepare for a
multi-year court battle," he said.
"But we'll take this one all the
way to the Supreme Court if we
have to."

The measure set lifetime term limits for
state legislators and most elected officials
in Sacramento.
"We believe that in order for the gov
ernment to be for the people we must have
new ideas. We believe in bringing in fresh

ideas and the only way to do that is to bring
in fresh people," said sophomore Anthony
Westerfield, vice-chair of the College Re
publicans.
Many feel the term-limitation move
ment is drawing its strength from anger
over recent scandals, such as those involv
ing the House bank and post office. But op
ponents argue that the proposition will not
accomplish the supporters' intended goals.
Roy Heatley, media director for the
"No on 164" campaign, says the measure
will effectively reduce California's politi
cal clout in Washington, D.C.
"The net effect of this will be to reduce
California's impact in Congress," Heatley
said. "It important we retain what senior
ity we have . . . because we have the
biggest population in the nation as well as
the largest delegation.
"If this passes, California will become
emasculated as far as its power in Wash
ington is concerned," he added.
Opponents further argue that term
limits will give more power to non-elected
congressional staff members
"It's like the movie 'Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington' when he asks his secretary
how to launch a filibuster," Heatley said.
"It's going to be putting more power in
the hands of people who are not elected."
But supporters of the proposition don't
agree that the state will lose its promi
nence in Congress.
"The argument that it will take the
juice away from California is garbage. We
have no real power now," said Tim Cary,
executive director of "Citizens for Term
Limits."
Although the Stanford Democrats
have not officially discussed the proposi
tion, co-chair Andrew Byrnes said he is
personally against term limits.
"The unfortunate thing ... is that it

has been billed as a quick fix, a
sweeping way to get at the group
as a whole," said Byrnes.
"I think a lot of people will
vote for this and still vote for
their incumbent, because this
seems to be a way to get at
Congress as a whole."
Byrnes argues that the propo
sition would restrict voters even
more than candidates.
He said the bill "will take away
the power of voters. I think vot
ers should be able to vote for
whomever they want to, whenev
er they want to. It seems to me
the best term limit is going out
and voting.
"It's sort of making the voter's
decision for them. You know that
even if you don't vote your repre

sentation will change," he said.
"It seems to me another rationale
to vote is removed."
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody said there will probably be
120 new members of Congress
this year without term limits.
"There is turnover without
term limitations. The way to
affect turnover is to increase the
quality of challengers," he said.
The way to improve competi
tion is to find challengers with
political experience and funding,
he added.
"Federal financing of elections
would be a much better way to
level the playing field," Brody
said. "But it's easier to write a
term limit than finance regula
tions."
The concept of term limits
does enjoy the support from two
local Congressional candidates
who are each hoping to make the
next two years their first term in

Washington.
Republican candidate Tom
Huening said it is "almost impos
sible to up « it an incumbent. I
think term limits are a kind of
blunt instrument for gaining
some competition on the federal
level. With term limitations, peri
odically there won't be an incum
bent."
Democratic candidate Anna
Eshoo says she sees both sides of
the issue and has no problem
with term limits correctly tai
lored to individual offices.
Term limitations "can provide
the opportunity for new ideas,
new people, all that," said Eshoo.
But at the same time, term
limitations could cause the state
to lose the service of good people,
she said.
Opponents question whether
the proposition has the ability
improve the dedication of elected
officials to their constituency.

Brody argues that the desire
for re-election forces legislators
to please their constituents.
"One of the reasons people are
re-elected is that they serve their
constituencies. If I have a prob
lem with immigration or income
tax ... it's often the case that my
representative will check into
that for me. That's what a lot of
the life of a member of Congress
is taken up with," he said.
"It's not done for altruistic
reasons, but it's a way represen
tatives serve their constituen
cy."
But others see incumbency in
a different light.
"Your Congressperson
doesn't sit there all the time
wondering about being re-elect
ed," said Westerfield. "If you
have a term limit, the represen
tative will be considering more of
California's needs than their
own needs.

"Most of the people caught in
the mail scandal and the banking
scandal were career politicians,"
he said.
Term limitations, argues
Huening, will encourage more
qualified candidates to run for
office.
"If we have a well-functioning
system in Congress, people will
be willing to interrupt their
careers (to run for political
office)," he said. Such a change
would spell the end of "career"
politicians, he argued.
But Brody sees a positive
side to long-term politicians.
"The things that keeps them
getting re-elected is service to
their district," said Brody. "The
more powerful their position on
the right committee, the more
they can serve their con
stituents."
In addition to California, term
limits are on the ballot in 13

other states. But even if they
pass, they are likely to be tested
in the courts before becoming
law.
"Most Constitutional scholars
believe it would be unconstitu
tional for a state to pass a
restriction on federal offices.
Only the Congress or the Consti
tution can set those restric
tions," said Political Science
Prof. David Brady.
He said he believes the propo
sition will pass, but will eventu
ally be struck down by the
courts.
But Cary said his group is
determined to get reforms enact
ed, even if it means a protracted
legal battle.
"(After this passes) the next
hurdle will be to prepare for a
multi-year court battle," he said.
"But we'll take this one all the
way to the Supreme Court if we
have to."
Capitalizing on widespread public dis
satisfaction with incumbent legislators,
supporters of Proposition 164 say the mea
sure, which would limit the terms of Cali
fornia's Senators and Representatives, is a
way to make elected officials more respon
sive to the needs of their constituents.
But opponents argue that the proposi
tion is a poorly constructed "quick fix"
that actually would decrease the power
and responsibility of the state's delega
tion in Washington.
The measure, if passed, would limit the
number of times incumbents could run
for re-election.

Members of the House of Representa
tives who had served six of the previous 11
years or Senators who had served 12 of
the previous 17 years would be prohibited
from placing their names on the ballot.
The bill does allow those prospective can
didates to mount write-in campaigns.
