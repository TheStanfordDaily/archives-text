# Med copter landing at Roble field
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
A flying whirlybird replaced
flying dusks on Roble Field yester
day afternoon, and it may have
saved a life.
Stanford Ultimate Frisbee prac
tice was interrupted around 3:20
by a Coast Guard helicopter that
landed on the field, where an am
bulance was waiting to whisk its 4-
year-old passenger to Stanford
Hospital's emergency room.
According to Jerry SafTold, a
petty officer in the San Francisco
based Coast Guard, the San
Mateo County sheriffs depart
ment called the Coast Guard to
fetch the sick boy at an elemen
tary school in Tescadero Beach.

The transfer of a boy patient Is completed from a Coast Guard helicopter to a Stanford Medical Center ambulance. The helicopter landed on
Roble Field because it was too large to land on the Med Center roof.
The boy was "unconscious and
had trouble breathing" when they
arrived, he said.
Because the Coast Guard heli
copter is too big to land at the usual
landing pad on top of the hospital,
the crafl had to set down in Roble
field and the boy was transferred to
an ambulance, said Sgt. Rick
Enberg of the Stanford Police.
The police received a call from
the Coast Guard only 10 minutes

before the helicopter was to land,
and several officers converged on
the field to clear debris — and fris
bee players — off the ground.
A fire engine also waited in case
the helicopter crashed. "Heli
copters tend to be a little danger
ous," Enberg explained.
SafTold said it was unusual for a
Coast Guard chopper to pick up
patients on land — usually the
group only does sea rescues.
"It was just an unusual incident
where somebody's life was in dan
ger, and we responded," he said.
Joyce Thomas, who works for
the Medical Center's News Bureau,

said the center's Life Flight heli
copter could not fly because of
heavy fog. As of last night, the hos
pital would not release the identity
or condition of the boy.
"It was pretty cool," said Marc
Weinberger, a graduate student in
aeronautics who took a break from
throwing his Frisbee to watch the
landing.
And Weinberger said he wasn't
surprised to see players on the
field tossing disks right up to the
moment the helicopter first
appeared. "You've got to get your
warm-up in before practice," he
said.
