WHAT In The World Will I
Do?!
Near the end of my freshman year I realized, even
though I was taking great courses, there was an
education I wasn't getting — one that could only
be found outside the classroom. A year later I was
teaching English in a government health
department office in Bali. It was one of the best
moves I ever made.

Program Stanford Business School (Indonesia 1971)
I intended to pursue a medical degree when I
returned from Asia, so I applied for deferred
admission. Basically, you'd be crazy not to take time
off before medical school. The time and
opportunities to do things like VIA just don't exist
once you begin.
—Jay Crary, Stanford Medical School Student (China 1987)

I hope to gain more intimate knowledge of a country and its
people. I hope to gain teaching skills, and experience that
will be an asset as I look for future work in an international
field. And I hope to grow personally.
