Bishops say no to wife abuse
(AP) — The Bible does not tell women to submit to abusive hus
bands, Roman Catholic bishops said in the U.S. church's first offi
cial statement on spouse abuse.
In a statement that condemns sexism, the bishops declared
women shouldn't consider themselves religiously bound to remain
in abusive relationships, and encouraged parish priests to be ready
with "a safe place" for abused women seeking help.
"Violence in any form — physical, sexual, psychological or ver
bal — is sinful," the bishops said in "When I Call for Help: A Pas
toral Response to Domestic Violence Against Women."
Injectable birth control OK'd
WASHINGTON (AP) — The government yesterday gave
women the option of using an injectable drug, Depo Provera, that
provides birth control for three months but may also cause weight
gain and menstrual irregularities.
"This drug presents another long-term effective option for
women to prevent pregnancy," Food and Drug Commissioner
David Kessler said in a written statement. "As an injectable, given
once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems relat
ed to missing a daily dose."
About a quarter of the women of childbearing age in the United
States use the birth control pill, which must be taken every day.
Madonna's "Sex" sells best
NEW YORK (AP) — Some say it's raunchy. Some say it falls
apart. But Madonna's new X-rated book "Sex" is selling — well
enough to top The Washington Post best-seller list.
"We're thrilled. . . and I'm sure Madonna is, too," said Diane
Ekeblad, associate director of public relations at Warner Books.
Worldwide sales total 600,000 to 650,000 copies of the $49.95 opus,
which shows Madonna — all of her — in various sexual fantasies
including with men and women. Warner has printed 1 million copies,
500,000 for U.S. distribution and 500,000 overseas, Ekeblad said.
"Sex" was No. 1 on the Post's best seller list Sunday, topping
Desert Storm commander H. Norman Schwarzkopf's "It Doesn't
Take a Hero."
