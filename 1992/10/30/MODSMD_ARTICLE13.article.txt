# Russian people face difficult winter
## Economic future gloomy with increasing inflation and unemployment figures 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Russians got economic
news as gloomy as their wintry weather yes
terday as the government reported worsening
inflation and unemployment as well as budget
shortfalls.
Russian currency also fell to a record low
of 398 rubles to the dollar, despite Presi
dent Boris Yeltsin's assurances that the
country was over the worst of its economic
hurdles.
Industrial workers in the north got an
extra whammy: the government announced
that 20 to 30 percent of them will have to
move south in the next several years
because factories there are losing too much
money.
"The future has nothing bright in store for
many people who still hold jobs in Russia," the
ITAR-Tass news agency lamented in a report
on the growing unemployment.
The news came as Yeltsin and his economic
team have come under intense attack from
nationalist and pro-Communist lawmakers
who vow to slow the market-oriented reforms
in a meeting of the nation's highest legislature
in December.

More than 920,000 people had registered at
unemployment offices as of Oct. 1, the agency
said, quoting the State Statistics Committee,
which released a report of uninspiring third
quarter figures.
Another 2 million industrial workers — 9
percent of the work force — are underem
ployed as factories switch to shorter work
weeks or force workers to take unpaid leave,
ITAR-Tass said.
The Statistics Committee warned that
many Russians are on the "brink of physical
survival," with one-third earning less than
2,000 rubles, or $5, a month and 5 percent of
the country's 149 million people earning half
that.
The average monthly wage has hovered at
around 5,900 rubles.
The only glimmer of good news from the
committee was that wages grew faster than
prices in five of the first nine months of this
year.
But they still could not make up for the
drop since the government lifted wage and
price controls in January. Compared with
December 1991, prices have risen twice as fast

as wages.
Not even the Cabinet could escape that
economic reality, as it met in the Kremlin on
yesterday to approve a tentative 1993 bud
get and hear the bad news about 1992
spending.
The budget deficit ballooned to $1.79 bil
lion in the first nine months of the year,
Finance Minister Vasily Barchuk said. He said
spending would have to be slashed to meet the
$2.38 billion target set by parliament for next
year.
Revenues fell $70 million short of the
forecast of $336 million, and will be even
lower in 1993, ITAR-Tass quoted Barchuk
as saying. The 1993 budget deficit is fore
cast at 6 percent of gross national product,
he said.
He proposed taxing interest on deposits and
lottery winnings, a move opposed by Central
Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, ITAR-
Tass reported.
Military spending will account for 15.3 per
cent of the budget — only slightly lower than
the current 16 percent — or roughly $4.7 bil
lion, Interfax reported.
