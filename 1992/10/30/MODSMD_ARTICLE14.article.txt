# Jury acquits black in riot murder of Jew
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - A black
teenager was acquitted yesterday
of stabbing to death a rabbinical
student during a riot last year in a
neighborhood shared by blacks
and Jews.
Lemrick Nelson, 17, had been
accused of killing Yankel Rosen
baum, 29, of Melbourne, Aus
tralia, during unrest that erupted
after a black boy was struck by a
car from a Jewish leader's motor
cade and fatally injured.
A state Supreme Court jury
acquitted Nelson of murder and
manslaughter charges after four
days of deliberations.
Judge Edward Rappaport had
warned spectators against any
outbursts. One man who screamed
"There is no justice for Jews in
this country" was removed from
the courtroom.
Outside the courthouse, about
100 Hasidic Jews chanted,
"Every Jew a .22" â€” a reference
to a small-caliber firearm.
After the verdict, about 200
people marched on City Hall,
where Mayor David Dinkins
pleaded for calm and announced a
$10,000 reward for information
leading to the conviction of
Rosenbaum's killer.

Prosecutors had said Nelson
was caught up in the violence that
broke out Aug. 19 after 7-year-old
Gavin Cato's death.,
Shortly after the traffic acci
dent, Rosenbaum was surrounded
by more than a dozen young blacks
and beaten and stabbed. Only Nel
son was charged with his murder.
Police said they found a bloody
knife on Nelson, that he con
fessed to the stabbing and that
Rosenbaum, before he died, iden
tified him as his assailant. But
Nelson's lawyer said he was
framed by corrupt police.
"I did not believe the police were
honest," said juror Norma Hall.
Protesters outside the court
house attacked the ruling.
"You can slaughter a Jew in
the city today and walk the
streets a free man." said. Yehuda
Kapaloun. "Yankel Rosenbaum's
fate was decided By t 'jury of what
was certainly not his peers."
The jury was made up of six
blacks, four Hispanics and two
whites.
Rosenbaum's brother, Norman
said, "Jewish blood is not cheap.
My brother looked him in the eye
and he identified this person, this
murderer."
