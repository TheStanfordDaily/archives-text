## Death with dignity 
### 
Proposition i6i, the
"Death With Dignity Act,"
gives terminally ill patients
the right to physician-aided death.
Critics like to point to the fact
that Proposition 161 doesn't pro
tect patients from misdiagnoses.
However, they overlook the initia
tive's definition of a terminal con
dition: "an irreversible or incur
able condition that — in the opin
ion of two physicians — would
result in death within six
months."
The measure only allows termi
nally ill adults, determined to be
mentally sound by their physi
cians, to request — in writing —
"aid-in-dying." This written
request must be signed by two wit
nesses who are not family or med
ical personnel and don't stand to
gain from the patient's death.
Critics also claim that the

proposition doesn't require physi
cians to offer their patients coun
seling and alternatives.
One can reasonably infer that
most physicians would indeed pro
vide counseling and other support
services for their patients. Fur
thermore, even after the sincerity
of a patient's request has been ver
ified, he or she can still opt to
change their mind at any point in
time and immediately invalidate
the directive.
Proposition 161 also protects
participating doctors and their
facilities from civil or criminal lia
bility, makes patient coercion into
seeking aid in death a misde
meanor, protects the insurance
rights of the terminally ill and
insures that each individual is
allowed the right to choose his or
her own destiny and die with dig
nity.
