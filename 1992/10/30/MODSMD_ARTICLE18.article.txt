# Limit the Governor

IF ENACTED, Proposition 165
— Gov. Pete Wilson's new plan
to reform welfare and the bud
get process — is certain to cause
more harm than good.
The measure will allow the gov
ernor to cut spending in various
areas if a budget isn't passed by
the July 1 deadline or if annual
revenues fall 3 percent below pro
jections.
This allowance may insure that
the state's budget will be adopted
on time, but gives the governor no
incentive to work cooperatively
with the state legislature. In fact,
many of the measure's harshest
critics fear that Wilson might use
this new power to declare "fiscal
emergencies" whenever he chooses.
Once declared, any cuts in the
budget that Wilson or any future
governor might pass could not be
overturned by the legislature, leav
ing every service unprotected by the
state's constitution and vulnerable
to this kind of budgetary reform.

Proposition 165 also calls for
cuts in welfare payments by 10
percent, and by an additional 15
percent once a family has received
aid for six months. Furthermore,
women who become pregnant
while on aid would receive no addi
tional benefits.
In addition to allowing Wilson
and future governors to coerce the
legislature into submission, the
measure attacks the poorer mem
bers of the state, failing to provide
suitable employment alternatives.
It makes no allowances for job
training or placement and makes no
effort to eliminate welfare fraud.
Despite the initiative's positive
aspects — like incentives for
teenage mothers to continue
school and the elimination of pay
for the governor and legislature
for each day after June 15 that the
state functions without a ratified
budget — Proposition 165, at
heart, is little more than a power
grab by Wilson and his followers.
