# Cost rate set at 60.3 percent
## 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
The federal government slightly in
creased Stanford's indirect-cost rate to
60.3 percent yesterday, and, while the
move does little to relieve the Universi
ty's budget crisis, it ensures that addi
tional cuts will not need to be made.
The new rate also signals an im
provement in the relations between the
Office of Naval Research and the Uni
versity, which had been unable to agree
upon a new rate since the government
abruptly reduced annual reimburse
ment to Stanford by more than $20 mil
lion in April 1991.
Although the 60.3 percent rate was
again unilaterally imposed by the gov
ernment, the move is a "significant step
toward settlement" of past disagree
ments, said Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten.
"It is no reason to be jubilant or any
thing like that, but it is certainly
progress," said University President
Gerhard Casper while briefly announc
ing the new rate to the Faculty Senate
yesterday afternoon.

The University has been operating
under a unilaterally imposed rate of 55.5
percent during the last two academic
years, and the new rate means the gov
ernment will reimburse Stanford approx
imately $7 million more this year. The
new rate applies retroactively to Sept. 1,
the beginning of University's fiscal year.
Indirect costs are the expenses asso
ciated with research that cannot be at
tributed to any individual project, such
as utilities and libraries, and they repre
sent more than 20 percent of the Uni
versity's operating budget.
Theoretically, a rate of 60.3 percent
means that for every $ 1,000 of a federal
ly sponsored grant, Stanford also re
ceives an additional $603 to cover indi
rect costs. But a number of complicated
rules reduce the actual amount of
money the University is reimbursed by
the government.
The new 1992-93 rate is 18 percent
age points below the 78 percent figure
proposed by the University in August
1990 for academic year 1990-91.
Unable to agree during the fall of that
year, the Office of Naval Research set
Stanford's rate at 74 percent.

An investigation spurred by then
campus Navy regulator Paul Biddle pro
duced a number of revelations of inap
propriate items the University had inad
vertently included under indirect costs,
and the government unilaterally
knocked 2 percent off the rate twice dur
ing winter 1990-91.
Following an embarrassing hearing
before the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations, the Navy
slashed the University's rate to 55.5 per
cent, where it remained until yesterday.
The abrupt reduction was the largest
factor responsible for Stanford's $43
million annual deficit, forcing the Uni
versity to undergo a year-long process of
budget-cutting from both academic and
administrative areas.
Without yesterday's rate increase,
Stanford could have been forced to
make additional cuts, Van Etten said.
In putting together this year's oper
ating budget, administrators had been
forced to predict a rate and calculated an
expected value that was "not far from
where we are now."
"When we put together the
budgets for the next two fiscal
years, we did assume an increase
above 55.5 percent," Van Etten
said. "The new rate does not pro
vide us with budget relief, but it is
about the rate we had projected."
The 60.3 percent rate does not,
however, reimburse the Universi
ty for what it has calculated its
actual costs to be. Van Etten esti
mated they were about 64 percent.
"Stanford will continue to sub
sidize research," he said. "The
research relationship is a partner
ship.
"Stanford pays and the govern
ment pays. Stanford will pay
more," Van Etten added.
Navy officials did not return
phone calls yesterday afternoon.
The University's calculation of
its actual costs was reduced from
74 percent a year ago to 64 per
cent because of changes in the
rules regarding indirect-cost
recovery.
The biggest change was a 26-
percent cap set on reimbursement
for administrative expenses,
which Van Etten estimated cost
Stanford 6 percentage points —
or more than $8 million.
The University and the Office
of Naval Research will continue
their ongoing negotiations in an
attempt to set a provisional rate
with carryforward for this year.
Such a rate would allow Stan
ford to calculate its actual costs at
the end of the year, then adjust the
future rate to reflect the difference
between the previous year's rate
and actual costs.
"Although we believe our actual
costs are closer to 64 percent, we
are pleased by the actions taken by

the government," Van Etten said.
"We intend to work with the gov
ernment and provide additional
information to them. Our hope is
to replace this unilaterally imposed
rate with a provisional rate with
carryforward."
Despite the new rate, many of
the large issues surrounding indi
rect costs remain unresolved.
Little change has occurred on
the University's legal appeal of
the Navy's rate reduction for
1990-91 and 1991-92.
The appeal, filed last November
with the Armed Services Board of
Contract Appeals, appears to be
Stanford's only chance of being
reimbursed for its true costs, Van
Etten said.
"I do not see any other way,"
he said. "The government may
have other plans in mind, but I do
not know what they are."
Van Etten said it is "too early
to tell" when the appeal might be
resolved, or if it will be done in

court or through a settlement
with the government.
Indirect-cost reimbursement
received by the University during
the 1980s is also being challenged
by a qui tam lawsuit filed by Navy
regulator Biddle last fall.
The lawsuit alleges that Stan
ford defrauded the government
hundreds of millions of dollars in
indirect costs during the last
decade, and Biddle could receive up
to 30 percent of any court award.
The Department of Justice is
currently deciding whether to join
in prosecuting Biddle's qui tam
suit, and a settlement cannot be
reached until it makes its decision.
"Obviously our hope is that
they will not find incidence of
fraud that would lead them to join
the qui tam suit," Van Etten said.
"We would be happy to achieve a
settlement with the government
for past years."
Biddle declined to comment on
the prospects of his lawsuit.
