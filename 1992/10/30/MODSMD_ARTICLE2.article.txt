# Cost rate set at 60.3 percent

The federal government slightly in
creased Stanford's indirect-cost rate to
60.3 percent yesterday, and, while the
move does little to relieve the Universi
ty's budget crisis, it ensures that addi
tional cuts will not need to be made.
The new rate also signals an im
provement in the relations between the
Office of Naval Research and the Uni
versity, which had been unable to agree
upon a new rate since the government
abruptly reduced annual reimburse
ment to Stanford by more than $20 mil
lion in April 1991.
Although the 60.3 percent rate was
again unilaterally imposed by the gov
ernment, the move is a "significant step
toward settlement" of past disagree
ments, said Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten.
"It is no reason to be jubilant or any
thing like that, but it is certainly
progress," said University President
Gerhard Casper while briefly announc
ing the new rate to the Faculty Senate
yesterday afternoon.

The University has been operating
under a unilaterally imposed rate of 55.5
percent during the last two academic
years, and the new rate means the gov
ernment will reimburse Stanford approx
imately $7 million more this year. The
new rate applies retroactively to Sept. 1,
the beginning of University's fiscal year.
Indirect costs are the expenses asso
ciated with research that cannot be at
tributed to any individual project, such
as utilities and libraries, and they repre
sent more than 20 percent of the Uni
versity's operating budget.
Theoretically, a rate of 60.3 percent
means that for every $ 1,000 of a federal
ly sponsored grant, Stanford also re
ceives an additional $603 to cover indi
rect costs. But a number of complicated
rules reduce the actual amount of
money the University is reimbursed by
the government.
The new 1992-93 rate is 18 percent
age points below the 78 percent figure
proposed by the University in August
1990 for academic year 1990-91.
Unable to agree during the fall of that
year, the Office of Naval Research set
Stanford's rate at 74 percent.

An investigation spurred by then
campus Navy regulator Paul Biddle pro
duced a number of revelations of inap
propriate items the University had inad
vertently included under indirect costs,
and the government unilaterally
knocked 2 percent off the rate twice dur
ing winter 1990-91.
Following an embarrassing hearing
before the House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations, the Navy
slashed the University's rate to 55.5 per
cent, where it remained until yesterday.
The abrupt reduction was the largest
factor responsible for Stanford's $43
million annual deficit, forcing the Uni
versity to undergo a year-long process of
budget-cutting from both academic and
administrative areas.
Without yesterday's rate increase,
Stanford could have been forced to
make additional cuts, Van Etten said.
In putting together this year's oper
ating budget, administrators had been
forced to predict a rate and calculated an
expected value that was "not far from
where we are now."
