## Tips for grade grubbers 
### 
The quarter is half over,
and everybody seems to be getting
them except you. As more and
more of your friends bring them back
from classes and brag about getting them
to their parents, grandparents and just
about anyone who will listen, you vow
you'll do anything to get them.
No, I'm still not talking about sorority
girls. I'm talking about better grades.
Everybody wants them, but what if
you possess neither the intelligence nor
the dedication necessary to get them?
Leave studying and stress to the weak
hearted and narrow-minded. There are
other steps to a stellar G.P.A. that won't
tax your delicate brain.
•Step one: Eliminate the competition.
If a professor assigns certain topics for a
paper, rush to the library and check out
every book that could possibly provide
relevant information.
Leave nothing to chance: as soon as
your paper is done, destroy the texts.
Burn them. Bury them. Just don't let
them get into enemy hands. Your's may
not be the most brilliant paper, but how
good can anyone else's be without a bibli
ography?
Curves can kill you. You know who
sets them. When turning in an exam,
grab the most promising blue books, stuff
them in your pants and donate them to
the nearest recycling bin. Everybody
loves an environmentalist.

•Step two: Feign a deadly illness. Sym
pathy can be a powerful weapon. Go to
class swathed in 14th-century garb,
smelling worse than a Hoboken sewer
and sporting festering facial lesions. A
few rats placed strategically on your per
son will add authenticity. Who could give
a B minus to a kid with bubonic plague?
•Step three: Cheat. Honor code,
shmonor code. Remember, it's only a vio
lation if they catch you. Every test can be
open book if you want it to be. Today's
high-tech calculators can store and recall
volumes of vital information at the touch
of a button. Results are what matter,
even if a calculator does look out of place
in a philosophy final.
•Step four: Establish a personal rela
tionship with your professor. Call him or
her at unusual hours, "just to chat."
Relate the funny anecdote about the
Stanford grad student who killed his pro
fessor with a claw hammer. Tell amusing
stories about the history of violent men
tal illness in your family. Ask how you're
doing in class.
•Step five: Dominate section. Speak as
loudly and as often as possible, regardless
of knowledge about the subject. If some
snivelling cur dares to contradict you,
glare at the savage with utter contempt
and coolly explain, "If you'd read the text
in its original Greek, Russian, Italian,
etc. you wouldn't be making the mistake
you're making now." No one will ever

question you again.
•Step six: Blackmail. The same money
you waste on books every quarter can be
better spent on a video camera. Keep tabs
on your professor. Wouldn't his wife like
to know what he's doing at Honeybun's
Obese All-Nude Dance Review in San
Francisco when he's supposed to be at a
biology conference in Oakland? Wouldn't
her husband be surprised to find that
she's been testing the laws of friction
with that physics T.A. from Greece?
•Step seven: Witchcraft. Put your
faith in the forces of the night. Your
classmates spent the week before the
final going to review sessions, re-reading
their notes and taking old exams. You
ripped the heads off six live chickens and
drank their blood, walked on burning
coals and chugged snake venom. Now
who's going to kick butt on that test?
•Step eight: Kill your roommate. Make
it look like suicide and collect an easy 4.0.
See? It's just that easy. And you spent
all that time studying.
