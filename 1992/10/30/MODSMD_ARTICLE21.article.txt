Pro-lifers deceived, made real debate impossible

ON OCT. 27,1 HAD the "privilege"
of representing the pro-choice
position in a debate on the validity
of Roe vs. Wade at Kresge Auditorium.
The debate turned out to be a setup for
recruiting Stanford students to join the
pro-life forces and prevent women from
having abortions.
The woman who invited me to speak
had told me she was a law student who
was a member of Stanford Students for
Life. Instead, she turned out to be a resi
dent of Palo Alto who has no affiliation
with the University.
She further represented that the
debate would be co-sponsored by both a
pro-life and a pro-choice group. It turned
out that no pro-choice group participated
in the event; apparently, they were not

even asked.
The biggest misrepresentation, howev
er, was in the format of the debate. Greg
Cunningham, the speaker for the pro-life
position, both began and ended the
evening. He started his position with a
five minute film which consisted of lurid
photographs of mangled fetuses and
other body parts blown up on a movie
screen size. He ended the evening with a
pitch to the audience to attend an all-day
training session (phone number included)
to learn how to stop women from obtain
ing abortions.
The film was intended to disgust the
audience. There is no way anyone could
watch it without having a violent visceral
reaction. There is no way anyone could
concentrate on the weighty legal, medical

and philosophical issues being discussed
after seeing that presentation.
We were debating the validity of Roe
vs. Wade. That case recognizes a woman's
right to have an abortion in the first
trimester free of interference from the
state.
Obstetricians and gynecologists who
have seen these photographs are
adamant that the fetuses depicted were
either stillbirths or from third trimester
abortions.
Only 100 out of the 1.6 million abor
tions performed in this country each year
take place in the third trimester. And
those occur only because of severe defor
mities or to save the life of the mother.
The overwhelming majority, 89 per
cent, of abortions occur in the first

trimester. I do not espouse, nor do most
in the pro-choice movement, that we
should have abortion by demand in the
third trimester.
Reasonable people can, and do, differ
in their feelings about choice and abor
tion. An intellectual discussion about the
constitutional, medical and theological
issues helps inform the debate. The pre
sentation on Tuesday in no way served
this function.
I have no problem advocating the
choice position. I am, however, offended
to be used as a pawn by those whose sole
motive is to prevent women from exer
cising their constitutional right.
