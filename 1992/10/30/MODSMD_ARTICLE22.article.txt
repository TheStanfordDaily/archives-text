# The 						Band embarrasses ally should cease with political expression
## 
### 
In my opinion, the "Cardinal" nick
name and the Stanford Band's antics
on the football field are both unfortu
nate legacies of the Donald Kennedy
years. I believe that it is time for the
community to reassert its true institu
tional personality and remove political
activism, once and for all, from Stan
ford athletics.
If the members of the Band want to
express their political opinions on the
football field, I would suggest that they
transfer to Harvard where this type of
behavior is accepted and goes hand-in
hand with athletic mediocrity. Other
wise, the band would do better to con
centrate more on providing high quality
music and less on "educating" the pub
lic about current events.
Apparently, the previous Stanford
president's willingness to pander to

students, even when they are wrong,
has created this situation.
The Stanford community should
wake up. The Band, in its current state,
makes Stanford the laughingstock of
the Pacific Ten Conference.
