# Prop 156 will give us the good clean air and transportation we need
## 
### 
Just ask a few Stanford students
who come from the greater Chicago
area or from the northeastern seaboard
cities about the conveniences of good
public transportation and they will tell
you how important it is.
California voters at Stanford, vote
"yes" on Proposition 156. It will bring
about cleaner air, less gridlock on free
ways and more jobs through the expan
sion of the various pieces of the Cali-

fornia transportation system
