# Stockdale shouldn't blame protestors for length of Vietnam War
## 
### 
Admiral James Stockdale distorted his
tory this week when he blamed oppo
nents of the Vietnam War for prolonging
the fighting. Stockdale was quoted by an
Idaho newspaper as saying, "Those com
rades that died — the extra 10, 15, 20
thousand — that blood is on your hands,
you war protestors."
Stockdale could not have been aware
of events taking place during his years in
solitary confinement, but he should have
learned since then that it was not anti
war demonstrators who were prolonging
the war but his own government.
Both the Johnson and Nixon adminis
trations knew long before 1973 that the
war in Vietnam could not be won. The

U.S. had deployed all the military force
at its command, short of nuclear
weapons.
The reason the U.S. was forced to
quit is that the war we were waging was
hopeless as well as pointless. American
soldiers had no clear idea of why they
were fighting in jungles 8,000 miles
from home, while the Vietnamese had a
cause they were ready to die for.
Although Nixon knew in 1969 that
the war was unwinnable, he and Henry
Kissinger dragged it on for four more
years in order to preserve American
"credibility."
If the opponents of the war had any
effect on its duration, it was to shorten it
by convincing Americans — and eventu
ally Congress — that the continued
killing was both fruitless and uncon
scionable. If our government had listened
earlier to the protestors, Admiral Stock
dale would have been spared years of
agony in his prison cell, and tens of thou
sands of Americans and untold numbers
of Vietnamese would not have died.
