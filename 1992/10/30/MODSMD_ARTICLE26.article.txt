# Language complicates issues
## Faculty Senate debates wording of domestic partners bill 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
While much of the Faculty Senate's debate over
domestic partner benefits yesterday concerned the
costs and moral implications of the proposal, a few
members raised the more subtle issue of language:
Do the words "gay and lesbian" used in the bill,
they asked, have connotations more insidious than
"same-sex"?
In the end, the senate decided to strike the words
"gay and lesbian" from the bill, along with the word
"intimate," which had been used to describe the
type of relationship needed to qualify for domestic
partner benefits.
The issue was raised by English Prof. Bliss
Carnochan, who questioned whether the words
"gay and lesbian" should have been included in
parentheses after the word "same-sex" in the origi
nal version of the bill.
Law Prof. Barbara Fried, chair of the subcom
mittee that authored the bill, at first asked if
Carnochan's question was "rhetorical."
"No, it's not rhetorical," he responded sharply.
"It's a serious question."
After a hesitating exchange, in which Fried
attributed the subcommittee's wording to "over
scrupulousness of definition," Genetics Prof. David
Botstein broke in, saying bluntly that the question
was: "Is sex involved here or not?"
"Here's the possibility," Botstein said. "If two
(heterosexual) people of the same sex who have no
sexual relationship, but do all the rest that you
would expect, want to live together ..."
"I'm sorry. I understand," Fried said quickly.
The phrase "gay and lesbian," she said, makes a
judgement about "the quality of the relationship"
instead of merely identifying the "sex characteris
tics" of those involved in the relationship.
"That is correct," Carnochan said. "Outside of
the parentheses you're talking about something
more or less reasonably factual, but inside the
parentheses you're talking about something else."
He added that the word "intimate" did not take
into account that the relationship could also be
"non-intimate, with all of the other defining char
acteristics."

But Law Prof. William Simon, finding himself in
"an unexpected, Burkean mood," said the word
"intimate" was used on many companies' certifica
tions for domestic partnership â€” and nothing sinis
ter was intended by its use.
"It would be troubling if the University were
going to do an investigation to determine the level
of intimacy, but that's not the case," Simon said,
provoking laughter from some members.
Carnochan moved to strike both phrases from
the bill, and the motion passed by voice vote.
