Words in brackets were part of the original text of the
bill, but were struck from the version finally passed:
RESOLVED: That the 25th Senate of the Academ
ic Council endorses the following UC-FSB recom
mendations and forwards them to the president of
Stanford University:
(A) That the University extend all benefits now
available to spouses and children of faculty and staff
to the same-sex [(gay and lesbian)] and opposite-sex
domestic partners of faculty and staff and such part
ners' children. The relevant benefits include health
benefits, benefits under the tuition grant program,
athletic privileges, library privileges, the right to audit
University courses, and the surviving spouse's right
to remain in on-campus housing after an employee's
death under the same terms now provided for surviv
ing partners.
(B) That "domestic partnership" for these purpos
es be defined to mean two individuals who live
together in a [intimate) long-term relationship of indef
inite duration, with an exclusive mutual commitment
similar to that of marriage, in which the partners agree
to be financially responsible for each other's well
being, and each others' debts to third parties. It
should further be stipulated that partners are not mar
ried to anyone else, do not have another domestic
partner, and are not related by blood, closer than
would bar marriage in their state of residence.
Employees should be required to sign a declaration
that the foregoing conditions have been met, as part
of the process of enrolling their partners.
