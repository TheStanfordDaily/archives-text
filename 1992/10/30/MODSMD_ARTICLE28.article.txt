## George: a 'sackman' hangs on 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
So many top athletes these
days seem to have been reared
from birth to play their sport.
When someone can rise to the
top of their position despite a
late start, it makes their story all
the more remarkable.
Such is the case with senior
outside linebacker Ron George.
Named this week as one of 10
semifinalists for the Butkus
Award — given to the top colle
giate linebacker — he didn't play
an organized game of football
until his senior -year in high
school.

'There isn't time for
self-reflection. This
sport requires a self
lessness, or you can
lose the moment/
— Ron George

Growing up in Heidelberg,
Germany, George played soccer
from second grade all the way
through high school. His experi
ence in this sport taught him the
eye-foot coordination that has
helped make him one of the
quickest linebackers in college
football.
"A lot of players are a bit
heavy in the feet," he said. "I
stay up a little better because of
soccer."
Although football is now
George's consuming passion, he
did not join an organized team
until his junior year in high
school, when he did not play a
down. It wasn't until his senior
year at Heidelberg American
High School that he began to
make recruiters sit up and take
notice.
That season, George was all-
Europe as a defensive end and
decided to attend the Air Force
Academy in Colorado Springs.
"My father was in the Air
Force, so it was the logical
choice for me," he said. At Air
Force, George didn't see the
field during his freshman sea
son.
It was at this point in his life,
after his freshman year at Air
Force, that George saw the need
to focus his energies; he decided
to transfer to Stanford.
"At the Academy, I was trying
to be a military man, a student,
and a football player," he said.
"It was like three full time jobs. I
had to limit my experience in

order to advance myself." '
When he arrived at Stanford,
George had a lot to learn about
playing major college football.
After all, the only real games he
had appeared in were during his
senior year in high school in Ger
manyl.
"I had never hit a tackling
sled until I came to Stanford,"
he said. "Coach Green had to
take me aside after practice and
show me how. That's how little I
knew about the game."
George had to sit out the 1989
season because of NCAA regula
tions. In the fall of 1990, defen
sive coordinator Willie Shaw
made a decision which sealed
George's destiny as a college
football star.
Despite the glaring fact that
George hadn't played a collegiate
down, Shaw elected to start him
at outside linebacker against
national power Colorado. "It was
a leap of faith," George said.
It was a leap of faith that has
paid big dividends for the Cardi
nal defense. That year, George
was named to the All Pacific 10
Conference Honorable Mention
team and has improved steadily
ever since.
He attributes his rapid
progress as a player to the teach
ers that have surrounded him
since he came to Stanford. He
said coaches Denny Green and
Willie Shaw gave him the atten
tion that led to his development
into a complete player.
"Those guys made me the
player I am today," he said.
"They spent an inordinate
amount of time teaching me the
game."
When George looks for play
ers he admires, he looks right
across the field at fellow outside
linebacker Dave Garnett. The
credit and respect which he
accords Garnett reflect his
eagerness to learn from anyone
who has something to say.
"If there's a recurring
thought I have on the field, it's
'play like Dave Garnett,'" he
said. "He's one of the best col
lege players I've seen. And he's
the most knowledgeable player
I've ever met. He's taught me an
incredible amount."
Perhaps reflecting his mili
tary side, George has a simple
prescription for how to progress
as a player. "Hard work, listen
ing instead of talking and never
giving up — those are what got
me here," he said.
At the end of 1991, George
considered leaving Stanford for
the NFL. His decision to stay
centered on one factor — Bill
Walsh.
"There are players in the

NFL who would give up their
careers to play under him,"
George said. "Only a fool
would've left, and I don't consid
er myself a fool."
After he finishes college,
George still plans to try his hand
at professional football. Speak
ing modestly, he spoke of his
desire for an opportunity to play
and said that if things don't
work out, he would like to be a
fireman.
Entering the final stretch of
his senior season, George is now
considered to be one of the pre
mier linebackers in college foot
ball. This year, he has piled up 12
sacks and 19 tackles for loss, lead
ing the Pac-10 in both categories.
Despite his personal accom
plishments, George remains
unsatisfied and hungry as he
eyes the rest of the season.
"As an individual, there isn't
time for self-re fleet ion," he said.

"This sport requires a selfless
ness, or you can lose the
moment."
As the Cardinal heads to Seat
tle to face the No. 2-ranked
Washington Huskies, time for
self-assessment has grown even
more scarce. Win or lose, George
sees the game this weekend as
crucial.
"You don't beat them, you
don't go to the Rose Bowl," he
said. "It has to be the best game
we've played all season."
As he speaks about tomor
row's game, George exudes a
quiet confidence. "These guys
don't fall for schemes," he said.
"They make a hole and challenge
us to beat them to it. Mano a
mano. We're going to stand up
and be counted, to play with the
big boys."
With Mr. George anchoring
the Stanford defense, it looks
like they can play with anybody.

said. "It has to be the best game
we've played all season."
As he speaks about tomor
row's game, George exudes a
quiet confidence. "These guys
don't fall for schemes," he said.
"They make a hole and challenge
us to beat them to it. Mano a
mano. We're going to stand up
and be counted, to play with the
big boys."
With Mr. George anchoring
the Stanford defense, it looks
like they can play with anybody.

Senior linebacker Ron George has come a long way from the
soccer fields of Heidelberg, Germany, and is now ready to pro
pel himself to an NFL goal.
So many top athletes these
days seem to have been reared
from birth to play their sport.
When someone can rise to the
top of their position despite a
late start, it makes their story all
the more remarkable.
Such is the case with senior
outside linebacker Ron George.
Named this week as one of 10
semifinalists for the Butkus
Award — given to the top colle
giate linebacker — he didn't play
an organized game of football
until his senior -year in high
school.

'There isn't time for
self-reflection. This
sport requires a self
lessness, or you can
lose the moment/
— Ron George

Growing up in Heidelberg,
Germany, George played soccer
from second grade all the way
through high school. His experi
ence in this sport taught him the
eye-foot coordination that has
helped make him one of the
quickest linebackers in college
football.
"A lot of players are a bit
heavy in the feet," he said. "I
stay up a little better because of
soccer."
Although football is now
George's consuming passion, he
did not join an organized team
until his junior year in high
school, when he did not play a
down. It wasn't until his senior
year at Heidelberg American
High School that he began to
make recruiters sit up and take
notice.
That season, George was all-
Europe as a defensive end and
decided to attend the Air Force
Academy in Colorado Springs.
"My father was in the Air
Force, so it was the logical
choice for me," he said. At Air
Force, George didn't see the
field during his freshman sea
son.
It was at this point in his life,
after his freshman year at Air
Force, that George saw the need
to focus his energies; he decided
to transfer to Stanford.
"At the Academy, I was trying
to be a military man, a student,
and a football player," he said.
"It was like three full time jobs. I
had to limit my experience in

order to advance myself." '
When he arrived at Stanford,
George had a lot to learn about
playing major college football.
After all, the only real games he
had appeared in were during his
senior year in high school in Ger
manyl.
"I had never hit a tackling
sled until I came to Stanford,"
he said. "Coach Green had to
take me aside after practice and
show me how. That's how little I
knew about the game."
George had to sit out the 1989
season because of NCAA regula
tions. In the fall of 1990, defen
sive coordinator Willie Shaw
made a decision which sealed
George's destiny as a college
football star.
Despite the glaring fact that
George hadn't played a collegiate
down, Shaw elected to start him
at outside linebacker against
national power Colorado. "It was
a leap of faith," George said.
It was a leap of faith that has
paid big dividends for the Cardi
nal defense. That year, George
was named to the All Pacific 10
Conference Honorable Mention
team and has improved steadily
ever since.
He attributes his rapid
progress as a player to the teach
ers that have surrounded him
since he came to Stanford. He
said coaches Denny Green and
Willie Shaw gave him the atten
tion that led to his development
into a complete player.
"Those guys made me the
player I am today," he said.
"They spent an inordinate
amount of time teaching me the
game."
When George looks for play
ers he admires, he looks right
across the field at fellow outside
linebacker Dave Garnett. The
credit and respect which he
accords Garnett reflect his
eagerness to learn from anyone
who has something to say.
"If there's a recurring
thought I have on the field, it's
'play like Dave Garnett,'" he
said. "He's one of the best col
lege players I've seen. And he's
the most knowledgeable player
I've ever met. He's taught me an
incredible amount."
Perhaps reflecting his mili
tary side, George has a simple
prescription for how to progress
as a player. "Hard work, listen
ing instead of talking and never
giving up — those are what got
me here," he said.
At the end of 1991, George
considered leaving Stanford for
the NFL. His decision to stay
centered on one factor — Bill
Walsh.
"There are players in the

NFL who would give up their
careers to play under him,"
George said. "Only a fool
would've left, and I don't consid
er myself a fool."
After he finishes college,
George still plans to try his hand
at professional football. Speak
ing modestly, he spoke of his
desire for an opportunity to play
and said that if things don't
work out, he would like to be a
fireman.
Entering the final stretch of
his senior season, George is now
considered to be one of the pre
mier linebackers in college foot
ball. This year, he has piled up 12
sacks and 19 tackles for loss, lead
ing the Pac-10 in both categories.
Despite his personal accom
plishments, George remains
unsatisfied and hungry as he
eyes the rest of the season.
"As an individual, there isn't
time for self-re fleet ion," he said.

"This sport requires a selfless
ness, or you can lose the
moment."
As the Cardinal heads to Seat
tle to face the No. 2-ranked
Washington Huskies, time for
self-assessment has grown even
more scarce. Win or lose, George
sees the game this weekend as
crucial.
"You don't beat them, you
don't go to the Rose Bowl," he
said. "It has to be the best game
we've played all season."
As he speaks about tomor
row's game, George exudes a
quiet confidence. "These guys
don't fall for schemes," he said.
