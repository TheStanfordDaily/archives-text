# Fac Sen votes to extend benefits
## 'Loud voice' asks Casper to implement partners policy for faculty, staff 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate recommended
yesterday that the University extend
benefits — including health insurance
— to both same-sex and opposite-sex do
mestic partners of its employees.
Though the final decisions will be
made by the president and Board of
Trustees, Katherine O'Hanlan, the au
thor of the original bill introduced to the
senate in April 1991, said the senate's
approval will have some weight with the
administration.
The resolution passed with a clear
majority on a voice vote.
University President Gerhard Casper
will be "compelled by the voice of the Sen
ate," O'Hanlan said in an interview after
the meeting. "It's a loud voice — it wasn't
something that had to be counted."

Law School Prof. William Simon,
who introduced the bill to the senate,
said he hoped that the senate's approval
of the bill would not be a "simple pro
logue" to a long period of study and that
the administration would "act as expe
ditiously as possible."

□ Faculty Senate battles over
language in bill

During the 90-minute discussion,
none of the senators questioned the
basic principle of the resolution — that
domestic partners should be treated the
same way as married couples.
Rather, the debate centered on
whether the proposal should include op

posite-sex couples in its definition of do
mestic partners. Some members wanted
to vote separately on extending the ben
efits to same-sex and opposite-sex cou
ples, but this motion was defeated.
The original proposal said that non
married opposite-sex couples should not
be included in the definition because
they have the option to marry while
same-sex couples do not.
This bill was amended to include op
posite-sex couples. Simon said he was
against the amended definition because
the "inclusion of the opposite sex dilutes
the symbolism" of the bill as a step for
increased gay and lesbian civil rights.
Although agreeing that a broader de
finition of domestic partners could "vio
late the political or conceptual purity" of
the bill, Economics Prof. Paul David ar-
