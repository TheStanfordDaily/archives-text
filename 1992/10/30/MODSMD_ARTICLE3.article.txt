# Fac Sen votes to extend benefits
## 'Loud voice' asks Casper to implement partners policy for faculty, staff 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate recommended
yesterday that the University extend
benefits — including health insurance
— to both same-sex and opposite-sex do
mestic partners of its employees.
Though the final decisions will be
made by the president and Board of
Trustees, Katherine O'Hanlan, the au
thor of the original bill introduced to the
senate in April 1991, said the senate's
approval will have some weight with the
administration.
The resolution passed with a clear
majority on a voice vote.
University President Gerhard Casper
will be "compelled by the voice of the Sen
ate," O'Hanlan said in an interview after
the meeting. "It's a loud voice — it wasn't
something that had to be counted."

Law School Prof. William Simon,
who introduced the bill to the senate,
said he hoped that the senate's approval
of the bill would not be a "simple pro
logue" to a long period of study and that
the administration would "act as expe
ditiously as possible."

□ Faculty Senate battles over
language in bill

During the 90-minute discussion,
none of the senators questioned the
basic principle of the resolution — that
domestic partners should be treated the
same way as married couples.
Rather, the debate centered on
whether the proposal should include op

posite-sex couples in its definition of do
mestic partners. Some members wanted
to vote separately on extending the ben
efits to same-sex and opposite-sex cou
ples, but this motion was defeated.
The original proposal said that non
married opposite-sex couples should not
be included in the definition because
they have the option to marry while
same-sex couples do not.
This bill was amended to include op
posite-sex couples. Simon said he was
against the amended definition because
the "inclusion of the opposite sex dilutes
the symbolism" of the bill as a step for
increased gay and lesbian civil rights.
Although agreeing that a broader de
finition of domestic partners could "vio
late the political or conceptual purity" of
the bill, Economics Prof. Paul David ar-
gued that it was unfair to exclude
opposite-sex domestic partners
simply because they chose not to
marry.
The inclusion of opposite-sex
couples in the bill led some faculty
members to wonder if the defini
tion of domestic partners could
stretch even to a child-parent rela
tionship, in which an employee
was caring for an elderly parent in
his or her home.
Rebholz said a policy that
included all long-term relation
ships would be ideal, but too
expensive. "We shouldn't allow the
best to defeat the good," he said.
After the vote, Economics Prof.
John Shoven, who was against the
bill, said the senate had at least
done "the right thing" by includ
ing heterosexual couples in the
definition of domestic partners.

Members also conflicted over
whether the Faculty Senate
should consider the issue at all.
"We are called advisers," Statis
tics Prof. Brad Efron said. The
senate should not play the role of
advocate and pressure group in the
University, which is what it would
be doing if it passed the bill, he
said.
"I'm against taking an advo
cate's role in defense of a proposal
which is so far removed from our
expertise in academic and scholar
ly policy," Efron said.
But History Prof. Ronald Reb
holz said the senate should be an
advocate, especially of a proposal
that "moves the University toward
greater equity."
Shoven said he felt the Univer
sity should not be "in the position
of certifying the seriousness or the
level of commitment of unmarried
relationships" in order to check if a
domestic partnership is legitimate.
If the government established a
legal equivalent to marriage for

domestic partners, Shoven said,
then he would vote for the bill,
because that legal partnership
would be the criteria for benefits.
But Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy said benefits par
ity should not be postponed until a
legal equivalent is developed.
A first-year law student who
attended the meeting said she was
pleased by the result.
"One of the reasons I came to
Stanford was because there was
benefits parity for students,"
Michelle Magar said. She said she
was surprised when she learned
the same benefits weren't avail
able to employees' domestic part
ners.
The senate approval "renews
my faith that I made the right deci
sion about where to go to law
school," Magar said. "I hope that it
will be borne out when President
Casper makes his final decision."

the same benefits weren't avail
able to employees' domestic part
ners.

The Faculty Senate recommended
yesterday that the University extend
benefits — including health insurance
— to both same-sex and opposite-sex do
mestic partners of its employees.
Though the final decisions will be
made by the president and Board of
Trustees, Katherine O'Hanlan, the au
thor of the original bill introduced to the
senate in April 1991, said the senate's
approval will have some weight with the
administration.
The resolution passed with a clear
majority on a voice vote.
University President Gerhard Casper
will be "compelled by the voice of the Sen
ate," O'Hanlan said in an interview after
the meeting. "It's a loud voice — it wasn't
something that had to be counted."

Law School Prof. William Simon,
who introduced the bill to the senate,
said he hoped that the senate's approval
of the bill would not be a "simple pro
logue" to a long period of study and that
the administration would "act as expe
ditiously as possible."

□ Faculty Senate battles over
language in bill

During the 90-minute discussion,
none of the senators questioned the
basic principle of the resolution — that
domestic partners should be treated the
same way as married couples.
Rather, the debate centered on
whether the proposal should include op

posite-sex couples in its definition of do
mestic partners. Some members wanted
to vote separately on extending the ben
efits to same-sex and opposite-sex cou
ples, but this motion was defeated.
The original proposal said that non
married opposite-sex couples should not
be included in the definition because
they have the option to marry while
same-sex couples do not.
This bill was amended to include op
posite-sex couples. Simon said he was
against the amended definition because
the "inclusion of the opposite sex dilutes
the symbolism" of the bill as a step for
increased gay and lesbian civil rights.
Although agreeing that a broader de
finition of domestic partners could "vio
late the political or conceptual purity" of
the bill, Economics Prof. Paul David ar-
gued that it was unfair to exclude
opposite-sex domestic partners
simply because they chose not to
marry.
The inclusion of opposite-sex
couples in the bill led some faculty
members to wonder if the defini
tion of domestic partners could
stretch even to a child-parent rela
tionship, in which an employee
was caring for an elderly parent in
his or her home.
Rebholz said a policy that
included all long-term relation
ships would be ideal, but too
expensive. "We shouldn't allow the
best to defeat the good," he said.
After the vote, Economics Prof.
John Shoven, who was against the
bill, said the senate had at least
done "the right thing" by includ
ing heterosexual couples in the
definition of domestic partners.

Members also conflicted over
whether the Faculty Senate
should consider the issue at all.
"We are called advisers," Statis
tics Prof. Brad Efron said. The
senate should not play the role of
advocate and pressure group in the
University, which is what it would
be doing if it passed the bill, he
said.
"I'm against taking an advo
cate's role in defense of a proposal
which is so far removed from our
expertise in academic and scholar
ly policy," Efron said.
But History Prof. Ronald Reb
holz said the senate should be an
advocate, especially of a proposal
that "moves the University toward
greater equity."
Shoven said he felt the Univer
sity should not be "in the position
of certifying the seriousness or the
level of commitment of unmarried
relationships" in order to check if a
domestic partnership is legitimate.
If the government established a
legal equivalent to marriage for

domestic partners, Shoven said,
then he would vote for the bill,
because that legal partnership
would be the criteria for benefits.
But Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy said benefits par
ity should not be postponed until a
legal equivalent is developed.
A first-year law student who
attended the meeting said she was
pleased by the result.
"One of the reasons I came to
Stanford was because there was
benefits parity for students,"
Michelle Magar said. She said she
was surprised when she learned
the same benefits weren't avail
able to employees' domestic part
ners.
The senate approval "renews
my faith that I made the right deci
sion about where to go to law
school," Magar said. "I hope that it
will be borne out when President
Casper makes his final decision."
