# Cardinal soccers conclude at home
## No. 2 Women face Cougars, Huskies 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's soccer
matches against Washington
State and Connecticut this week
end will both challenge the Car
dinal, but in different ways.
While the WSU game should
test whether Stanford is mental
ly prepared to play well against a
weaker but improving opponent,
the Connecticut match should
reveal how the Cardinal stacks
up against a team of equal cal
iber.
The Cougars (7-4-2), who visit
Stanford today at 2 p.m., have
yet to beat a top-20 squad in four
tries this year. While the No. 4
Cardinal appears to have a deci
sive edge on paper, the team has
had difficulty putting away lesser
opponents in recent matches.
Against San Diego State,
Stanford played a sluggish first
half and had to come from
behind to beat the Aztecs 2-1.
"Our players have a lot pride,"
said Cardinal coach Berhane
Andeberhan. "I don't think they
were pleased with recent perfor
mances. . .They've responded
well and I'm really pleased with
the last few practices."
One player the Cardinal will
have to watch carefully is Wash
ington State forward Kim
Lynass, one of the top scoring
threats in the West. The junior
has notched 13 goals and two
assists in 13 games.
The Cardinal's scoring coun
terpart, Sarah Rafanelli, may not

be 100 percent healthy for the
match. She's missed the last two
practices due to a sore leg, which
she may have jammed in the last
game.
Washington State and Stan
ford have met only once before,
in 1990 â€” the Cougars' second
season as a varsity team. The
Cardinal got goals from Rafanelli
and Julie Foudy en route to a 5-0
blowout. Lynass notched the
only two Washington State shots
on goal in what was the worst
offensive showing in team histo
ry-
But considering the Cougars'
improvement over the past two
years and Stanford's recent
struggles, today's match could be
a lot closer.
The Husky game, an 11 a.m.
showdown on Sunday, is almost
certain to be a nail-biter. Con
necticut (15-2-1) has been a fix
ture in the top-five all season and
boasts some of the top national
players in the country.
"They don't have a Julie
Foudy but they have more play
ers of scholarship caliber," said
Andeberhan, who added that a
key matchup will be Rafanelli
and Husky defender Jennifer
Strong.
The Connecticut match wraps
up the regular season for the
Cardinal, and Andeberhan is
pleased to finish with a top qual
ity opponent.
"If we are going to have any
effect in the playoffs, we need to
be tested now so we can see what
the playoffs will be like," he said.
