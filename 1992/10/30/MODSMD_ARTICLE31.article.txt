# Men to take on Div. II Seattle Pacific
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
After a disappointing loss to
the Washington Huskies last
weekend, the Stanford men's
soccer team (10-5-1, 5-2-0 in
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion play) will look to rebound
tomorrow against the Seattle
Pacific Falcons, a NCAA Division
II powerhouse.
Although the Falcons are not
a Division I-caliber team, Seattle
Pacific has, like Stanford, domi
nated the nation in their division
for the past 10 years. This season
is no different, as they have
already clinched the Olympic
Conference title with a 12-3
record.
Two of their three preseason
losses, however, came against
Fresno State and Oregon State,
both MPSF teams. The Cardinal
dominated both the Bulldogs and
the Beavers in conference action
by scores of 2-0 and 3-0, respec
tively.
Nevertheless, the Falcons
will pose an offense threat to
the Cardinal as they head into
tomorrow's game having aver
aged seven and a half goals per
game in their last four match
es.
They are led on the front line
by junior forward Jason Dunn,

who has registered 22 goals and
eight assists on the season,
including a record-breaking
streak of seven consecutive
games in which he has scored at
least one goal. Dishing off to him
on the attack has been forward
Jason Farrell, who has seven
goals and 15 assists on the year.
Overall, Seattle Pacific has
dominated Division II soccer as
they have outscored their oppo
nents by a margin of 61 to 13,
including eight shutouts.
The Falcons will be pitted
against a strong Division I con
tender in the Cardinal, however,
as Stanford has secured a MPSF
playoff berth for the second year
in a row.
The Cardinal, who struggled to
score against the Huskies last
weekend, will look to turn things
around with an offensive unit
headed by senior scoring leader
Jason Vanacour, who has eight
goals and three assists. Right
behind him is senior forward
Lance Killian, who has emerged as
of late to compile five goals in his
last three games for a season total
of seven goals and two assists.
On defense, the Cardinal will
welcome the return of senior
goalkeeper and co-captain Kyle
