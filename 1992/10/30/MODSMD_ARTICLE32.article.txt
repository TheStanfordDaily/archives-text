# Greeks 'party on' as Tresidder Express clerk enters fray
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
Greeks. They conjure up
images of big men, strapping
men, barrel-chested men — men
who squeeze into giant metal
horses together, and not just for
body heat.
And what is the modern mani
festation of this homo-eroticism
if not college football? Instead of
group bathing with pre
pubescent boys, today's men
gather each Saturday to watch
19-year-olds in form-fitting lycra
bend over an enticingly obloid
shaped ball.
But that's not what the
Greeks — the ones who so badly
want their names in the paper
they're willing to be ruthlessly
mocked in the intro — are about.
They're about guts, intelligence
and passing on oral traditions.
Real oral traditions.
And as the sports editors, beat
writers and columnists fail week
after week, one thing remains as
inexplicable as the existence of this
time-honored, space-eating tradi
tion: the image of the underdog.
And with the same degree of
emotion and irony as when Apol
lo became Rocky's manager, Joel
Stein has moved from next-to
last to just one game away from

the lead.
Using only what he knows
about the local cuisine of the
states the teams come from, and
second-hand knowledge about
the strength and endurance of
friends who happen to be
enrolled there, Stein was the only
Greek to go above .500 last week.
And as if to directly challenge
his lack of knowledge, guest
Greek Eric Moggridge joins the
team. Claiming to know nothing
about football, but desperately
begging to plug for his speed
metal band "Epidemic," Mog
gridge agreed to prostrate him
self to the Greeks like a virgin to
the Oracle of Delphi.
Moggridge, admired by mil
lions campus-wide as "The long
haired guy at Tresidder Express
who didn't giggle when you asked
for a Penthouse" was, unlike for
those Big Game Gaieties cameos,
not pushed into the Greek gig by
his publicist. It was his own idea.
Because Moggridge knows
that becoming a Greek, even a
guest one, is, for all intents and
purposes, just like joining Skull
and Bones. If Moggridge doesn't
break six figures with the band,
well, let's just say that Tish
Williams will help him get there.
Let's hope to God that Kevin
JefTery isn't involved.

Greeks. They conjure up
images of big men, strapping
men, barrel-chested men — men
who squeeze into giant metal
horses together, and not just for
body heat.
And what is the modern mani
festation of this homo-eroticism
if not college football? Instead of
group bathing with pre
pubescent boys, today's men
gather each Saturday to watch
19-year-olds in form-fitting lycra
bend over an enticingly obloid
shaped ball.
But that's not what the
Greeks — the ones who so badly
want their names in the paper
they're willing to be ruthlessly
mocked in the intro — are about.
They're about guts, intelligence
and passing on oral traditions.
Real oral traditions.
And as the sports editors, beat
writers and columnists fail week
after week, one thing remains as
inexplicable as the existence of this
time-honored, space-eating tradi
tion: the image of the underdog.
And with the same degree of
emotion and irony as when Apol
lo became Rocky's manager, Joel
Stein has moved from next-to
last to just one game away from

the lead.
Using only what he knows
about the local cuisine of the
states the teams come from, and
second-hand knowledge about
the strength and endurance of
friends who happen to be
enrolled there, Stein was the only
Greek to go above .500 last week.
And as if to directly challenge
his lack of knowledge, guest
Greek Eric Moggridge joins the
team. Claiming to know nothing
about football, but desperately
begging to plug for his speed
metal band "Epidemic," Mog
gridge agreed to prostrate him
self to the Greeks like a virgin to
the Oracle of Delphi.
Moggridge, admired by mil
lions campus-wide as "The long
haired guy at Tresidder Express
who didn't giggle when you asked
for a Penthouse" was, unlike for
those Big Game Gaieties cameos,
not pushed into the Greek gig by
his publicist. It was his own idea.
Because Moggridge knows
that becoming a Greek, even a
guest one, is, for all intents and
purposes, just like joining Skull
and Bones. If Moggridge doesn't
break six figures with the band,
well, let's just say that Tish
Williams will help him get there.
Let's hope to God that Kevin
JefTery isn't involved.
