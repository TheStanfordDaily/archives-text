# Spikers rematch Bruins, Trojans on huge road trip
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
This weekend, as you might have heard, a Stan
ford team will hit the road to face a undefeated, top
-10 national power at its home arena, with visions of
postseason play in mind.
Unlike the football team, however, the second
ranked Cardinal women's volleyball team will face a
top-10 national power the next night as well.
Stanford (17-1, 10-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
will travel to Los Angeles this weekend to face the
top-ranked UCLA Bruins (18-0, 11-0 in Pac-10), fol
lowed by a match the next evening against the No.
10 USC Trojans (14-4, 9-2 in Pac-10). Both matches
will be tests for the Stanford squad, a team coming
off a grueling two-week, six-game homestand.
While the Cardinal's matches against No. 6 USC
and No. 1 UCLA might have to take a back seat in
the sports pages to Stanford football's Saturday
showdown with the Huskies, they certainly won't
take a back seat with fans who have been following
the squad from the beginning of the season — fans
who painfully remember the Cardinal's heartbreak
ing loss to UCLA on Oct. 3.
"We know we would have won if we would have
executed better," Stanford head coach Don Shaw
said following that loss. "That match actually gave
us the confidence and motivation for our ultimate
goal."
The ultimate goal, of course, is winning the
national championship in December. But the road to
the title always seems to go through Los Angeles, and
Shaw and his team know that better than anyone.
"They've been in the back of our minds all year,"
Shaw said. "UCLA really isn't our focus — we know
we'll see them again down the road, and that's when
we need to be ready for them. Our main concern is
with playing to our potential against USC."
Stanford defeated the Trojans in their last meet

ing on Oct. 2 at Maples, 15-8, 15-3, 9-15, 15-1, and
USC will have revenge on its mind when the two
teams meet on Halloween in Lyon Center.
Outside hitters Katie Haller and 6-5 Cica Baccelli
will lead the Trojans against Stanford on Saturday
night. Haller leads the Trojans with 264 kills and
284 digs, and is hitting .267 on the year. Baccelli is
hitting .323 with 238 kills, 140 digs, and 54 blocks
on the season, and registered 11 kills in USC's loss
to Stanford.
The Cardinal, however, will have a tough time
looking past Friday's showdown with UCLA. The
Bruins come into the match red-hot, having won
their last 24 games and dropping only three earlier
this year.
UCLA is led by a host of talented players, includ
ing Player-of-the-Year candidate Natalie Williams,
middle blockers Marissa Hatchett and Lisa Hudak,
and former Ail-American outside hitter Jenny
Evans. Stanford will hope to contain the nation's
most explosive team in what many see as a preview
to the NCAA final.
"A lot of people are calling them the best colle
giate women's volleyball team ever," Shaw said,
"and I figure, that's fine — let them go ahead and
say that. They're an awfully good team, but I can tell
you that we had our chances to win, and we'll be a
much-improved team when we meet them again."
Shaw emphasizes that the match will be impor
tant in terms of his team's development, but that
the more important match against the Bruins will
hopefully come in the NCAA Tournament.
"We'd like to win on Friday, but that's not where
our attention is. We can afford to go 1-1 down there
— we can't afford to go 0-2, and that's why USC is
so important."
Of course, this does not mean that the Cardinal
doesn't want to win the UCLA match.
"We always get up for UCLA," said freshman hit
ter Cary Wendell. "It's always an intense match."

national championship in December. But the road to
the title always seems to go through Los Angeles, and
Shaw and his team know that better than anyone.
"They've been in the back of our minds all year,"
Shaw said. "UCLA really isn't our focus — we know
we'll see them again down the road, and that's when
we need to be ready for them. Our main concern is
with playing to our potential against USC."
Stanford defeated the Trojans in their last meet

ing on Oct. 2 at Maples, 15-8, 15-3, 9-15, 15-1, and
USC will have revenge on its mind when the two
teams meet on Halloween in Lyon Center.
Outside hitters Katie Haller and 6-5 Cica Baccelli
will lead the Trojans against Stanford on Saturday
night. Haller leads the Trojans with 264 kills and
284 digs, and is hitting .267 on the year. Baccelli is
hitting .323 with 238 kills, 140 digs, and 54 blocks
on the season, and registered 11 kills in USC's loss
to Stanford.
The Cardinal, however, will have a tough time
looking past Friday's showdown with UCLA. The
Bruins come into the match red-hot, having won
their last 24 games and dropping only three earlier
this year.
UCLA is led by a host of talented players, includ
ing Player-of-the-Year candidate Natalie Williams,
middle blockers Marissa Hatchett and Lisa Hudak,
and former Ail-American outside hitter Jenny
Evans. Stanford will hope to contain the nation's
most explosive team in what many see as a preview
to the NCAA final.
"A lot of people are calling them the best colle
giate women's volleyball team ever," Shaw said,
"and I figure, that's fine — let them go ahead and
say that. They're an awfully good team, but I can tell
you that we had our chances to win, and we'll be a
much-improved team when we meet them again."
Shaw emphasizes that the match will be impor
tant in terms of his team's development, but that
the more important match against the Bruins will
hopefully come in the NCAA Tournament.
"We'd like to win on Friday, but that's not where
our attention is. We can afford to go 1-1 down there
— we can't afford to go 0-2, and that's why USC is
so important."
Of course, this does not mean that the Cardinal
doesn't want to win the UCLA match.
"We always get up for UCLA," said freshman hit
ter Cary Wendell. "It's always an intense match."
