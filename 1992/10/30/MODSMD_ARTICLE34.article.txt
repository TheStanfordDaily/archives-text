# Cross country hosts Pac-10's
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
The Stanford community has a unique oppor
tunity this weekend — to watch some of the best
cross country teams in the nation race head-to
head in an event that will have a major effect on
national rankings.
The event is the Pacific 10 Conference Cross
Country Championships, and they will be run on
the Stanford Golf Course this Saturday. The men
start at 3 p.m., with the women following at 3:45
p.m..
Competing on the golf course Saturday will be
nine teams (Oregon State does not have a pro
gram.), four of which are nationally ranked. This
tremendous field reflects the Pac-10's distinction
of having the strongest cross country in the
nation.
On the men's side, Stanford is ranked 26th
and faces some powerful competition from Ari
zona, Oregon, Washington and UCLA.
The Cardinal is familiar with both Arizona
and UCLA, having raced (and lost) to both at the
Stanford Invitational four weeks ago. The Wild
cats, who are "clear favorites this weekend,"
according to Stanford head coach Vin Lananna,
are ranked No. 2 in the country. UCLA, although
receiving votes, is not ranked in the top 25.
Stanford has yet to face the men from Oregon
and University of Washington, but expects
strong showings from these two squads, who are
ranked ninth and 20th, respectively.
The women's side boils down to the same five
teams, but here the Cardinal (ranked 17th) has a
better chance of sliding into the top three. The
women from Oregon are the returning champi
ons and come in as the favorites, ranked ninth.
Close behind in the national rankings are the
lOth-ranked Wildcats, to whom Stanford only
lpst by a scant 20 points two weeks ago at the Ari
zona State Invitational. The Huskies, last year's
third place finishers, are ranked 20th, and will
also duel against Stanford for the top spots.

Individually, there is a good chance to see
some Cardinal red among the leaders. Gary Stolz,
last year's fourth-place finisher, says he "expects
to be in the top four [again]." His strategy will be
tq "sit back and watch things develop. . .You have
to be there at the fifth mile, not the first."
Pressing Stolz will be two runners who have
attained national prominence this season. One,
Martin Keino, is all too familiar to Stolz and his
teammates. Keino, who finished second at the
Pac-10 meet last year, tends to blaze through the
first mile. He displayed this tendency at the Stan
ford Invitational this year, obliterating the first
mile in a stunning 4 minutes 28 seconds before
wining easily.
Washington State, although not that strong of
a team, boasts one preeminent runner — Joe
Kapkory. Kapkory, who broke a course record
earlier this month in Montana, has enjoyed a
tremendous season and should challenge Keino
early and often.
The Cardinal women's hopes lie with Louise
Watson. Watson, a junior transfer from England,
said she would like to be in the top five finishers,
and has a shot to win the whole race. She plans
on "going out strong with the leaders and getting
in a competitive position while staying in con
trol."
Pressuring Watson for the victory will be
Nicole Woodward of Oregon, Tara Carlson of
Washington, and Katie Williams of Arizona. Wat
son has never faced Woodward or Carlson, but
beat Williams handily at the Stanford Invitation
al and then again at the Arizona State Invita
tional. As Lananna put it, "Louise should be
right in the thick of it and has a good chance to
win it all."
Recently Stanford has been a middle-of-the
road team in the powerful Pac-10. In the last
three years the men have placed fifth last year
and fourth for the two years before that, while
the women have garnered seventh, sixth and
fifth, respectively. Expectations are that the Car
dinal will have similar performances this year.
