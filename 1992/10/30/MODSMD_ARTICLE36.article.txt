# Water polo hosts pair: UCLA, SCU at deGuerre
## No. 2 Cardinal hopes to splash Bruins, Broncos 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
After playing its last six games
on the road, Stanford's water
polo team will finally have the
opportunity to defend its No. 2
ranking at home. The Cardinal
will host sixth-ranked UCLA and
unranked Santa Clara today at 3
and 4:30 p.m., at deGuerre Pool.
Although the visitors do not
provide the same caliber of opposi
tion Stanford has recently faced in
No. 1 California and No. 3 USC,
the confrontations still affect
national standings. A loss by the
Cardinal to less highly regarded
teams such as the Bruins will
result in a drop in the polls.
Stanford head coach Dante
Dettamanti feels quite confident
in his team, however. He believes
that the Cardinal has improved
steadily over the course of the
season, and is welding as a team.
In particular, he noted that
younger players such as fresh
man Jeremy Laster, who is sec
ond in team scoring, have risen to
the challenge.
Dettamanti views the Santa
Clara encounter as "just another
game" where he will deploy his
second squad. He said, however,
that UCLA will prove more
formidable.
"We didn't just pull away from
them," Dettamanti said in regard
to Stanford's last contest against
the Bruins. Indeed, the Cardinal
had to fight back from a 3-2

deficit to win that match, 8-4.
Junior Chris Kellerman of
UCLA scored three of his team's
four goals in the last outing. He
and goalie Kevin Dillenbeck, who
according to Dettamanti ranks
among the top three goaltenders
in the country, are the individu
als with which Stanford used
against a young Bruin team. Oth
erwise, the Cardinal has prac
ticed against the Bruins' zone
defense, which utilizes Dillenbeck
by collapsing on the opposition's
centerforward and giving oppo
nents the outside shot.
Stanford will feature a mostly
healthy squad. Senior captain
Chip Blankenhorn has a taped
wrist as a result of an injury suf
fered during an USC encounter
three weeks ago, but played in
last weekend's Mountain Pacific
Conference Championship Tour
nament. Sophomore Frank
Schneider, who sprained his
thumb in practice earlier in the
week, is expected to play as well.
