# Law students angry over cuts in loan forgiveness program
## 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
More than 50 students met yes
terday with Law School Dean Paul
Brest and asked him to rescind a
45-percent reduction in the
school's loan forgiveness program,
which helps graduates working in
low-paying public interest fields to
pay their student loans.
"The school has shown a com
mitment to excellence in public in
terest law, but we want the admin
istration to know that the money
has to be there too," said Lisa Hay

den, member of the Public Inter
est Law Student Association.
"Without money, intentions
don't get too far, and these cuts
don't foster public interest ideals,"
she said.
As part of its $1.2 million budget
reduction, the school has substan
tially reduced the financial help
students receive under the Public
Interest Low Income Protection
Plan. The first class affected will be
the graduating class of 1995.
Under the old plan, a typical
graduate with a yearly public in
terest career income of $26,000

ideals.'

and a debt of $60,000 would repay
$173 monthly. Under the new
plan, graduates would pay $317
monthly — about one-fourth of
their income, according to the stu
dent association's figures.
Students said the reduction in

financial assistance will discourage
graduates from choosing public in
terest careers and that these pro
gram cuts are incongruous with the
school's commitment to academic
excellence in public interest law.
"I don't think plan B (the re

vised plan) is sufficient loan for
giveness to enable students to
make a choice for public interest ca
reers without having to also think
about poverty," one student said.
Funding for the plan was initial
ly provided by the Cummins En
gine Foundation. But the funds
from that contribution ran out last
year, coinciding with the Universi
ty-wide budget cuts, Brest said.
He said the school had a plan to
continue the program when the
Cummins endowment ran out, but
could not implement the plan in the
wake of the current budget crunch.

Brest said the Law School is
now working on a short-term plan
to bring the loan forgiveness aid
for the class of 1995 up to the level
of the old plan. A special commit
tee is also researching possibilities
for restoring the program, includ
ing separating the plan's funding
from the general Law School bud
get and finding private donations
for its endowment.
Brest said the Law School will
have to reconsider its decision and
try to bring loan forgiveness back
"because it's obviously an area of
big concern to the students."
The student association pre
sented Brest with petition letters
from 223 students in which they
said the cuts were unfair.
The letter said that the class of
1995 was not told of the cuts, and

that many students chose Stan
ford based on "what now appears
to be a misrepresentation of the
program."
Indeed, two students at the
meeting said that if they had
found out about the cuts before
making their decision, they
would have chosen another law
school with better loan forgive
ness.
Brest took responsibility for
the apparent misinformation.

The Law School's reputation
will suffer, students said, if loan
forgiveness is not restored. As a
result, potential students,
whether interested in public
interest law or not, will turn their
backs on Stanford.
"Even if I'm not interested in
public interest law, I wouldn't
want to be in a place where stu
dents weren't into public interest.
I think it would be a scary place,"
one student said.
