# Public service on Halloween
## 700 students spend day of death helping others, ecology 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Instead of spending tomorrow applying Hal
loween makeup or watching the football game,
about 700 students will participate in 40 different
public service activities throughout the Bay Area.
The ninth annual campus-wide service day, called
"Reach Out Today," is sponsored by the Stanford
Volunteer Network, which operates out of the Haas
Center for Public Service.
"This is sort of a one-day blitz, where students
can get out there and have fun," said Megan
Sweezey, assistant director of the public service cen
ter. "The idea is to inspire students to get involved
with service groups and internships."
Students will be involved in projects ranging from
painting a house for homeless teenagers in Redwood
City to cleaning up ecologically threatened marsh
lands in Palo Alto.
Staffers from the Reach Out Today program sent
letters last June to various agencies in the Bay Area
asking them to design one-day service projects for
Stanford students, said co-chair Roopal Mehta.
About 50 agencies responded to the requests and

agreed to fund activities.
Generally, a campus residence signs up as a group
for one or more projects. Most of the projects were
reserved about two weeks ago by dorm service repre
sentatives, although 10 projects have not been selected.
"There definitely has been a fantastic sign-up,"
Sweezey said. "I think most dorms see this as some
thing they do every year."
Reach Out Today also organized several dorm
based lectures on social and environmental issues by
Stanford professors and public service leaders this
week.
Program organizers hope tomorrow's activities
will bring even more students into Stanford's
already-growing public service program. Sweezey
said more freshman expressed interest in public ser
vice during orientation this fall than ever before.
Earlier this month, Haas put on the largest service
fair in its history.
Mehta believes this enthusiasm for service is
related to the construction of a new building for the
public service center.
"A lot of people are putting together new groups
and trying to see if they can get space or be affiliated
with the new center," she said.
