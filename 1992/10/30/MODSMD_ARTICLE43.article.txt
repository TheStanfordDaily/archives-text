# Activists discuss peace prospects
## Women said to have 'special role' in Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
### John Borland 
In a passionate display of the
differences separating Israelis
and Palestinians, two activists
from the region yesterday dis
cussed the prospects for peace and
the role of women in any solution.
Paula Guzman, an Israeli Jew,
and Miriam Ma'ari, a Palestinian,
led a dialogue titled "Women's
Visions for Peace." The two are
currently on a tour of college cam
puses across the country orga
nized by the Progressive Zionist
Caucus. Their talk at Stanford
was co-sponsored by Hillel, a Jew
ish student organization.
Guzman spoke first, saying the
status of women in Israel is
declining. This will be overcome
only by the end of what she called
the constant "state of war"
between Israel and the Palestini
ans.
"Women are not really involved
in the policy-making process," she
told the group. "This liberates us
from the mainstream."
She spoke of a "special role" for
women, noting protest singers
and writers as well as the large

representation of females in
groups dedicated to the search for
peace.
Guzman took a cautiously opti
mistic approach to the current
peace talks being held in Wash
ington. Israel's coalition govern
ment led by Yitzhak Rabin is frag
ile, she said. Continued violence

The Likud were
honest — they were
antagonistic to
everyone.'
— Miriam Ma'ari

on either side will only tip the
scales in favor of the more mili
taristic parties, dashing hopes for
any peaceful compromise.
"My vision of peace is this,"
she said. "Two peoples with the
same rights of determination, two
states, and collaboration to make
each one flourish."
Ma'ari responded with a more
personal appeal. She told of the

uprooting and division of her fam
ily as a child, of refugees' constant
waiting to "return home" and of
the prayers of her mother for an
end to the family's separation.
Looking at the primarily Jew
ish audience, she stated her inten
tion to "present the other side of
the coin."
"We should not deceive our
selves on the issue of violence,"
she said, admitting that there is
considerable violence directed at
the soldiers and settlers.
But the Palestinians, she said,
are not to blame. "Soldiers are
victims of circumstances, or vic
tims of policy, but they are not
victims of Palestinians."
Ma'ari was not optimistic
about the Labor coalition's dedi
cation to peace. "The Likud were
honest — they were antagonistic
to everyone," she said. "The new
government is not as honest in its
position."
"People can not live on bread
alone," she concluded. "It takes
much more for the human being
to live on than the economic life;
humans must have their own dig
nity, their own life."
