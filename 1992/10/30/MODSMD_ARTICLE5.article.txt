# ANC's Mandela to speak at Maples
## 
### June Mølgaard Staff writer 
South African anti-apartheid leader
Nelson Mandela, chairman of the
African National Congress, will speak at
Stanford Monday, Nov. 9. Tickets will
be available beginning this Monday.
As the first stop on a short trip to the
United States, Mandela will receive the
Jackson H. Ralston Prize of Internation
al Law from the Stanford Law School and
then speak at Maples Pavilion at 4 p.m.

The speech will be open to a limited
number of Stanford students, faculty
and staff. Tickets will be available to
anyone with valid University ID on a
first-come-first-served basis beginning
at 7 a.m. Nov. 2 at the ticket office in
Tresidder.
According to Frank Brucato, associate
dean of the Law School, Mandela's speech
will probably concern the long-awaited
constitution still under negotiation with
the white South African government.
The Jackson H. Ralston Prize Man

dela will receive was established to rec
ognize "original and distinguished con
tributions to the development of the role
of law and the establishment of peace
and justice."
The prize, awarded periodically, has
previously been given to Prime Minister
Olaf Palme of Sweden, Ambassador
Tommy Coh of Singapore, former Pres
ident Jimmy Carter, President Oscar
Arias Sanchez of Costa Rico and Prime
Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau of
Canada.
Nominations for the prize are
made by faculty members of the
Law School's Ralston/Flaeger Com
mittee — chaired by Law Prof. Bill
Gould — and must be approved by
the Dean of the Law School, the
University President, the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of

California and the Secretary Gener
al of the United Nations.
"Mr. Mandela was chosen
because of the fact of his impor
tant and enormous commitment
to solving a conflict of interna
tional proportions through the
rule of law," said Gould.
Mandela, who earned a law
degree at the University of Witwa
tersrand, helped form the Youth
League of the outlawed African
National Congress in 1944 and
went on to form the nation's first
black law partnership with Oliver

Tambo in 1952.
He spent five years on trial for
treason between 1956 and 1961,
was found innocent and re-arrest
ed in 1962. Mandela was impris
oned for life in 1963, but was
released in 1990.
His staunch unwillingness to
compromise his vision of a South
African state governed by majori
ty rule made Mandela the symbol
ic leader of the struggle for jus
tice, and he was appointed deputy
president of the legalized ANC in
1990, and president in 1991.
