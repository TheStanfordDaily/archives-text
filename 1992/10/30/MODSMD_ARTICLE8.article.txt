# Prop 161: 'Death with dignity?'
## 
### Andy Dworkin Ceara McNiff 
California will become the first place in
the world to allow physician-assisted death
for terminally ill patients if the controver
sial Proposition 161 is approved by voters
Tuesday.

Proponents argue that the terminally ill
should have the right to end their suffering
through humane death. But many people
say the proposition lacks adequate safe
guards to protect the patient. And others,
including the Roman Catholic Church,
have raised moral objections.
However, all sides agree more is at stake

than the legislation itself. Californians will
be changing the way people look at human
life when they pull the lever to vote, they
say. And they expect the vote to be close.
Generally, "what the initiative does is
allow a terminally ill person to ask for help
in dying, and it allows a physician to help the
patient," said Stephen Jamison, regional di
rector of the Hemlock Society of Northern
California, which supports the initiative.
There is a point in the progress of a ter
minal illness when the patients "start the
dying process," and can only be kept alive
by medical technology, said Marianne
Schneller, campaign field coordinator for
Californians Against Human Suffering.
Proposition 161 would allow patients to
forego the indignity of living connected to a
machine and choose to die a painless death,
she added.
The point of the proposition is "the em
powerment of (a) terminally ill patient" to
end their life humanely, said Schneller.
But physician Elizabeth Menkin, coor
dinator of the Kaiser Santa Teresa Hos-

pice, said she believed doctors
should focus on stopping suffering,
not on ending their patients' lives.
"It is not necessary or proper to
eliminate the suffering by elimi
nating the patient," she said. "Kill
pain, not patients."
Proposition 161 "is not neces
sary and detrimental," said
Thomas RafFin, professor at the
Medical School and co-director of
the Stanford Center for Biomedi
cal Ethics.
Raffin believes this measure
would distort the role of the physi
cian. Instead, he said, doctors need
better pain-relief medications to
relieve suffering.
The "death with dignity" mea
sure, drafted by Californians
Against Human Suffering, would
give mentally competent adults
the right to ask their physician to
help them end their life when they
become terminally ill. It only
applies if two physicians, including
the patient's attending doctor,
judge that the patient's condition
is terminal — within six months of
death.
The patient must also ask for
aid-in-dying on more than one
occasion. The mode of death must
be "painless, humane and digni
fied."

The measure absolves doctors
and nurses from legal responsibili
ty when they assist in voluntary
death. Also, any organization or
individual religiously, morally or
ethically opposed would not be
required to provide assistance in
dying.
Deep divisions
There are deep divisions within
both the medical and religious
communities on the issue.
Aid-in-dying has become an
issue since medical advances have
begun "the prolonging of life
beyond the time it has quality,"
said Douglas Norris, senior minis
ter at the First United Methodist
Church of Palo Alto and a strong
proponent of 161.
"It really is getting hard to die,"
he said.
Norris said he became interest
ed in the issue after dealing with
terminally ill members of his con
gregation and after his mother
died of cancer. Allowing terminally
ill patients, many of whom are in
pain, to die is a humane action, he
said.
And while the Methodist
church has not taken an official
stand on such issues, Norris said,
"As a Methodist, I do not necessar
ily believe death is the worst
option."
The Catholic Church, on the
other hand, has become one of the
mqjor forces against the proposi

tion. It considers aid-in-dying a
"serious immoral act," said James
Erps, a priest with the Catholic
Community at Stanford.
"For the individual who is ask
ing for it, it would be suicide" and
against Catholic doctrine, he
added.

'It really is getting
hard to die'

"The (Catholic) Church's posi
tion, however, is that no extraordi
nary means are required to sustain
life. ... The church isn't saying life
at all costs," Erps continued. The
removal of artificial respiration
from dying patients would be
allowed under Catholic doctrine,
for example, he said.
But, he added, "what [the
church] is saying in response to
161 is you can't positively take a
life. That's the definition of mur
der."
Many medical groups opposed
to the proposition fear that it may
be dangerous for patients or that
abuses could occur.
Menkin said she feared the mea
sure did not contain sufficient safe
guards for the patient's life. The
proposition does not require wit
nesses at the time of death and fam

ily notification is not mandatory.
Others have complained that
there is no required waiting period
between the time a patient requests
aid-in-dying and receives it.
But Jamison argued that the
measure does include safeguards.
"Individuals are protected every
step of the way. There is a waiting
period because you need two physi
cians' opinions," he said.
Menkin said she feared report
ing procedures are insufficient.
Hospitals are required only to give
a yearly count of the age, disease
and date of death of all patients
given aid-in-dying.
"You will be blind as to whether
it is working or not," she said. "It
would be impossible to review the
cases to look at other factors that
could let us see the impact of the
law, who is being killed and why."
A 'slippery slope*
One main argument against the
proposition is that it will put Cali
fornia on a "slippery slope," that
allowing aid-in-death today may
lead to legalized mercy killings
where the patient is a passive par
ticipant.
"I am concerned it might pave
the way for less voluntary forms of
euthanasia," said Stanford Law
Prof. Henry Greely, an expert in
medical ethics.
Erps agreed, saying, "This is
really a foot in the door, and you
could paint some pretty ugly

things to follow this." Like the ter
minally ill, the indigent poor also
have a low quality of life, but it
would be immoral to kill them, he
said.
"If we're talking about keeping
alive a famous movie star, I think
a very different (standard) would
be applied than for this alcoholic
we just pulled out of the gutter,"
Erps said. "There's kind of a Hit
lerian final solution quality to it."
But proponents disagreed with
the slippery slope argument.
"This is a personal decision and
something you do after two doc
tors have declared you terminally
ill. I don't see how it is slippery,"
Norris said.
"I can't find this being inter
preted into a slippery slope,
because nobody is doing anything
to anyone. Someone is answering a
patient's request," said Schneller.
History of dying
As a state, California has been
on the cutting edge of legalizing
assisted death, Greely said. Cur
rently, the state has some of the
broadest laws on withdrawal of life
support systems from patients in
the country.
But Greely stressed the differ
ence between withdrawal of life
support — the issue in famous
cases like the Karen Ann Quinlan
case in New Jersey — and what
161 proposes.
The proposition "is really a

mqjor extension past the previous
right-to-die cases" in that it allows
for a patient who is not being kept
alive by artificial life support sys
tems to ask for death, he said. "It's
kind of the difference between
action and inaction."
Greely stressed that there is
also a difference between what the
measure allows and the activities
of Jack Kevorkian, the Michigan
doctor who helps patients kill
themselves with his "suicide
machine."
Kevorkian's technique "would
be equivalent to a doctor handing a
patient some pills, and the patient
taking an overdose," Greely said.
"161 is taking a more active role."
Kevorkian's actions would still
not be allowed by Proposition 161,
said Schneller. She said
Kevorkian's patients are not ter
minally ill, and he is not their
attending (regular) physician.
Some have suggested that as
many as 15 to 20 percent of physi
cians already, and illegally, assist
their patients in dying. Greely
said, "It is alleged, quite plausibly,
that doctors often give patients
morphine knowing that the
inevitable conclusion will be
death."
"This measure gets it out of the
closet," Jamison said.
"This is already happening on
every AIDS ward in the country
. . . and nobody is challenging
that," said Schneller.
California will become the first place in
the world to allow physician-assisted death

sial Proposition 161 is approved by voters

161 is you can't positively take a
life. That's the definition of mur
der."
Many medical groups opposed
to the proposition fear that it may
be dangerous for patients or that
abuses could occur.
Menkin said she feared the mea
sure did not contain sufficient safe
guards for the patient's life. The
proposition does not require wit
nesses at the time of death and fam

ily notification is not mandatory.
Others have complained that
there is no required waiting period
between the time a patient requests
aid-in-dying and receives it.
But Jamison argued that the
measure does include safeguards.
"Individuals are protected every
step of the way. There is a waiting
period because you need two physi
cians' opinions," he said.
Menkin said she feared report
ing procedures are insufficient.
Hospitals are required only to give
a yearly count of the age, disease
and date of death of all patients
given aid-in-dying.
"You will be blind as to whether
it is working or not," she said. "It
would be impossible to review the
cases to look at other factors that
could let us see the impact of the
law, who is being killed and why."
A 'slippery slope*
One main argument against the
proposition is that it will put Cali
fornia on a "slippery slope," that
allowing aid-in-death today may
lead to legalized mercy killings
where the patient is a passive par
ticipant.
"I am concerned it might pave
the way for less voluntary forms of
euthanasia," said Stanford Law
Prof. Henry Greely, an expert in
medical ethics.
Erps agreed, saying, "This is
really a foot in the door, and you
could paint some pretty ugly

things to follow this." Like the ter
minally ill, the indigent poor also
have a low quality of life, but it
would be immoral to kill them, he
said.
"If we're talking about keeping
alive a famous movie star, I think
a very different (standard) would
be applied than for this alcoholic
we just pulled out of the gutter,"
Erps said. "There's kind of a Hit
lerian final solution quality to it."
But proponents disagreed with
the slippery slope argument.
"This is a personal decision and
something you do after two doc
tors have declared you terminally
ill. I don't see how it is slippery,"
Norris said.
"I can't find this being inter
preted into a slippery slope,
because nobody is doing anything
to anyone. Someone is answering a
patient's request," said Schneller.
History of dying
As a state, California has been
on the cutting edge of legalizing
assisted death, Greely said. Cur
rently, the state has some of the
broadest laws on withdrawal of life
support systems from patients in
the country.
But Greely stressed the differ
ence between withdrawal of life
support — the issue in famous
cases like the Karen Ann Quinlan
case in New Jersey — and what
161 proposes.
The proposition "is really a

mqjor extension past the previous
right-to-die cases" in that it allows
for a patient who is not being kept
alive by artificial life support sys
tems to ask for death, he said. "It's
kind of the difference between
action and inaction."
Greely stressed that there is
also a difference between what the
measure allows and the activities
of Jack Kevorkian, the Michigan
doctor who helps patients kill
themselves with his "suicide
machine."
Kevorkian's technique "would
be equivalent to a doctor handing a
patient some pills, and the patient
taking an overdose," Greely said.
"161 is taking a more active role."
Kevorkian's actions would still
not be allowed by Proposition 161,
said Schneller. She said
Kevorkian's patients are not ter
minally ill, and he is not their
attending (regular) physician.
Some have suggested that as
many as 15 to 20 percent of physi
cians already, and illegally, assist
their patients in dying. Greely
said, "It is alleged, quite plausibly,
that doctors often give patients
morphine knowing that the
inevitable conclusion will be
death."
"This measure gets it out of the
closet," Jamison said.
"This is already happening on
every AIDS ward in the country
. . . and nobody is challenging
that," said Schneller.
California will become the first place in
the world to allow physician-assisted death
for terminally ill patients if the controver
sial Proposition 161 is approved by voters
Tuesday.

Proponents argue that the terminally ill
should have the right to end their suffering
through humane death. But many people
say the proposition lacks adequate safe
guards to protect the patient. And others,
including the Roman Catholic Church,
have raised moral objections.
However, all sides agree more is at stake

than the legislation itself. Californians will
be changing the way people look at human
life when they pull the lever to vote, they
say. And they expect the vote to be close.
Generally, "what the initiative does is
allow a terminally ill person to ask for help
in dying, and it allows a physician to help the
patient," said Stephen Jamison, regional di
rector of the Hemlock Society of Northern
California, which supports the initiative.
There is a point in the progress of a ter
minal illness when the patients "start the
dying process," and can only be kept alive
by medical technology, said Marianne
Schneller, campaign field coordinator for
Californians Against Human Suffering.
Proposition 161 would allow patients to
forego the indignity of living connected to a
machine and choose to die a painless death,
she added.
The point of the proposition is "the em
powerment of (a) terminally ill patient" to
end their life humanely, said Schneller.
But physician Elizabeth Menkin, coor
dinator of the Kaiser Santa Teresa Hos-

pice, said she believed doctors
should focus on stopping suffering,
not on ending their patients' lives.
"It is not necessary or proper to
eliminate the suffering by elimi
nating the patient," she said. "Kill
pain, not patients."
Proposition 161 "is not neces
sary and detrimental," said
Thomas RafFin, professor at the
Medical School and co-director of
the Stanford Center for Biomedi
cal Ethics.
Raffin believes this measure
would distort the role of the physi
cian. Instead, he said, doctors need
better pain-relief medications to
relieve suffering.
The "death with dignity" mea
sure, drafted by Californians
Against Human Suffering, would
give mentally competent adults
the right to ask their physician to
help them end their life when they
become terminally ill. It only
applies if two physicians, including
the patient's attending doctor,
judge that the patient's condition
is terminal — within six months of
death.
The patient must also ask for
aid-in-dying on more than one
occasion. The mode of death must
be "painless, humane and digni
fied."

The measure absolves doctors
and nurses from legal responsibili
ty when they assist in voluntary
death. Also, any organization or
individual religiously, morally or
ethically opposed would not be
required to provide assistance in
dying.
Deep divisions
There are deep divisions within
both the medical and religious
communities on the issue.
Aid-in-dying has become an
issue since medical advances have
begun "the prolonging of life
beyond the time it has quality,"
said Douglas Norris, senior minis
ter at the First United Methodist
Church of Palo Alto and a strong
proponent of 161.
"It really is getting hard to die,"
he said.
Norris said he became interest
ed in the issue after dealing with
terminally ill members of his con
gregation and after his mother
died of cancer. Allowing terminally
ill patients, many of whom are in
pain, to die is a humane action, he
said.
And while the Methodist
church has not taken an official
stand on such issues, Norris said,
"As a Methodist, I do not necessar
ily believe death is the worst
option."
The Catholic Church, on the
other hand, has become one of the
mqjor forces against the proposi

tion. It considers aid-in-dying a
"serious immoral act," said James
Erps, a priest with the Catholic
Community at Stanford.
"For the individual who is ask
ing for it, it would be suicide" and
against Catholic doctrine, he
added.

'It really is getting
hard to die'
— Douglas Norris

"The (Catholic) Church's posi
tion, however, is that no extraordi
nary means are required to sustain
life. ... The church isn't saying life
at all costs," Erps continued. The
removal of artificial respiration
from dying patients would be
allowed under Catholic doctrine,
for example, he said.
But, he added, "what [the
church] is saying in response to
161 is you can't positively take a
life. That's the definition of mur
der."
Many medical groups opposed
to the proposition fear that it may
be dangerous for patients or that
abuses could occur.

should have the right to end their suffering
through humane death. But many people
say the proposition lacks adequate safe
guards to protect the patient. And others,
including the Roman Catholic Church,
have raised moral objections.
However, all sides agree more is at stake

than the legislation itself. Californians will
be changing the way people look at human
life when they pull the lever to vote, they
say. And they expect the vote to be close.
Generally, "what the initiative does is
allow a terminally ill person to ask for help
in dying, and it allows a physician to help the
patient," said Stephen Jamison, regional di
rector of the Hemlock Society of Northern
California, which supports the initiative.
There is a point in the progress of a ter
minal illness when the patients "start the
dying process," and can only be kept alive
by medical technology, said Marianne
Schneller, campaign field coordinator for
Californians Against Human Suffering.
Proposition 161 would allow patients to
forego the indignity of living connected to a
machine and choose to die a painless death,
she added.
The point of the proposition is "the em
powerment of (a) terminally ill patient" to
end their life humanely, said Schneller.
But physician Elizabeth Menkin, coor
dinator of the Kaiser Santa Teresa Hos-

pice, said she believed doctors
should focus on stopping suffering,
not on ending their patients' lives.
"It is not necessary or proper to
eliminate the suffering by elimi
nating the patient," she said. "Kill
pain, not patients."
Proposition 161 "is not neces
sary and detrimental," said
Thomas RafFin, professor at the
Medical School and co-director of
the Stanford Center for Biomedi
cal Ethics.
Raffin believes this measure
would distort the role of the physi
cian. Instead, he said, doctors need
better pain-relief medications to
relieve suffering.
The "death with dignity" mea
sure, drafted by Californians
Against Human Suffering, would
give mentally competent adults
the right to ask their physician to
help them end their life when they
become terminally ill. It only
applies if two physicians, including
the patient's attending doctor,
judge that the patient's condition
is terminal — within six months of
death.
The patient must also ask for
aid-in-dying on more than one
occasion. The mode of death must
be "painless, humane and digni
fied."

The measure absolves doctors
and nurses from legal responsibili
ty when they assist in voluntary
death. Also, any organization or
individual religiously, morally or
ethically opposed would not be
required to provide assistance in
dying.
Deep divisions
There are deep divisions within
both the medical and religious
communities on the issue.
Aid-in-dying has become an
issue since medical advances have
begun "the prolonging of life
beyond the time it has quality,"
said Douglas Norris, senior minis
ter at the First United Methodist
Church of Palo Alto and a strong
proponent of 161.
"It really is getting hard to die,"
he said.
Norris said he became interest
ed in the issue after dealing with
terminally ill members of his con
gregation and after his mother
died of cancer. Allowing terminally
ill patients, many of whom are in
pain, to die is a humane action, he
said.
And while the Methodist
church has not taken an official
stand on such issues, Norris said,
"As a Methodist, I do not necessar
ily believe death is the worst
option."
The Catholic Church, on the
other hand, has become one of the
mqjor forces against the proposi

tion. It considers aid-in-dying a
"serious immoral act," said James
Erps, a priest with the Catholic
Community at Stanford.
"For the individual who is ask
ing for it, it would be suicide" and
against Catholic doctrine, he
added.

hard to die'

"The (Catholic) Church's posi
tion, however, is that no extraordi
nary means are required to sustain
life. ... The church isn't saying life
at all costs," Erps continued. The
removal of artificial respiration
from dying patients would be
allowed under Catholic doctrine,
for example, he said.
But, he added, "what [the
church] is saying in response to
161 is you can't positively take a
life. That's the definition of mur
der."
Many medical groups opposed
to the proposition fear that it may
be dangerous for patients or that
abuses could occur.
Menkin said she feared the mea
sure did not contain sufficient safe
guards for the patient's life. The
proposition does not require wit
nesses at the time of death and fam

ily notification is not mandatory.
Others have complained that
there is no required waiting period
between the time a patient requests
aid-in-dying and receives it.
But Jamison argued that the
measure does include safeguards.
"Individuals are protected every
step of the way. There is a waiting
period because you need two physi
cians' opinions," he said.
Menkin said she feared report
ing procedures are insufficient.
Hospitals are required only to give
a yearly count of the age, disease
and date of death of all patients
given aid-in-dying.
"You will be blind as to whether
it is working or not," she said. "It
would be impossible to review the
cases to look at other factors that
could let us see the impact of the
law, who is being killed and why."
A 'slippery slope*
One main argument against the
proposition is that it will put Cali
fornia on a "slippery slope," that
allowing aid-in-death today may
lead to legalized mercy killings
where the patient is a passive par
ticipant.
"I am concerned it might pave
the way for less voluntary forms of
euthanasia," said Stanford Law
Prof. Henry Greely, an expert in
medical ethics.
Erps agreed, saying, "This is
really a foot in the door, and you
could paint some pretty ugly

things to follow this." Like the ter
minally ill, the indigent poor also
have a low quality of life, but it
would be immoral to kill them, he
said.
"If we're talking about keeping
alive a famous movie star, I think
a very different (standard) would
be applied than for this alcoholic
we just pulled out of the gutter,"
Erps said. "There's kind of a Hit
lerian final solution quality to it."
But proponents disagreed with
the slippery slope argument.
"This is a personal decision and
something you do after two doc
tors have declared you terminally
ill. I don't see how it is slippery,"
Norris said.
"I can't find this being inter
preted into a slippery slope,
because nobody is doing anything
to anyone. Someone is answering a
patient's request," said Schneller.
History of dying
As a state, California has been
on the cutting edge of legalizing
assisted death, Greely said. Cur
rently, the state has some of the
broadest laws on withdrawal of life
support systems from patients in
the country.
But Greely stressed the differ
ence between withdrawal of life
support — the issue in famous
cases like the Karen Ann Quinlan
case in New Jersey — and what
161 proposes.
The proposition "is really a

mqjor extension past the previous
right-to-die cases" in that it allows
for a patient who is not being kept
alive by artificial life support sys
tems to ask for death, he said. "It's
kind of the difference between
action and inaction."
Greely stressed that there is
also a difference between what the
measure allows and the activities
of Jack Kevorkian, the Michigan
doctor who helps patients kill
themselves with his "suicide
machine."
Kevorkian's technique "would
be equivalent to a doctor handing a
patient some pills, and the patient
taking an overdose," Greely said.
"161 is taking a more active role."
Kevorkian's actions would still
not be allowed by Proposition 161,
said Schneller. She said
Kevorkian's patients are not ter
minally ill, and he is not their
attending (regular) physician.
Some have suggested that as
many as 15 to 20 percent of physi
cians already, and illegally, assist
their patients in dying. Greely
said, "It is alleged, quite plausibly,
that doctors often give patients
morphine knowing that the
inevitable conclusion will be
death."
"This measure gets it out of the
closet," Jamison said.
"This is already happening on
every AIDS ward in the country
. . . and nobody is challenging
that," said Schneller.
