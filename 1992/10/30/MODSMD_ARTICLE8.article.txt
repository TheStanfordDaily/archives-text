# Prop 161: 'Death with dignity?'

### Andy Dworkin Ceara McNiff 
California will become the first place in
the world to allow physician-assisted death
for terminally ill patients if the controver
sial Proposition 161 is approved by voters
Tuesday.

Proponents argue that the terminally ill
should have the right to end their suffering
through humane death. But many people
say the proposition lacks adequate safe
guards to protect the patient. And others,
including the Roman Catholic Church,
have raised moral objections.
However, all sides agree more is at stake

than the legislation itself. Californians will
be changing the way people look at human
life when they pull the lever to vote, they
say. And they expect the vote to be close.
Generally, "what the initiative does is
allow a terminally ill person to ask for help
in dying, and it allows a physician to help the
patient," said Stephen Jamison, regional di
rector of the Hemlock Society of Northern
California, which supports the initiative.
There is a point in the progress of a ter
minal illness when the patients "start the
dying process," and can only be kept alive
by medical technology, said Marianne
Schneller, campaign field coordinator for
Californians Against Human Suffering.
Proposition 161 would allow patients to
forego the indignity of living connected to a
machine and choose to die a painless death,

The point of the proposition is "the em
powerment of (a) terminally ill patient" to
end their life humanely, said Schneller.
