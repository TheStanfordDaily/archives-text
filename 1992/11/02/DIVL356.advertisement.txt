Invitation to
Nominate Candidates
for
The James W. Lyons
Award for Service
The James W. Lyons Award for Service was
established to recognize and honor
students of the Stanford community for
service contributions made by students from a
variety of schools, departments, teams, clubs,
residences, and community projects. All enrolled
students are eligible to receive the award.
Selections are made on the basis of
nominations from members of the Stanford
community: faculty, staff, and students.
Nominations can be made in the form of a letter
addressed to Michael Jackson, Dean of Students,
323 Old Union, Mail Code (3010); or by electronic
mail to CR.MI J. The award ceremony and dinner
will be held during winter quarter 1992-93. The
award ceremony and dinner will be held during
winter quarter 1992-93. The deadline for
submitting nominations for fall/winter quarter
awards is:
Friday, December 11,1992

The Service Award program is a nice way to
express appreciation to some of the amazing
student-citizens in our community. I hope you
will think of this program when you encounter
such students.
