Leading Edge
The leading-edge starts with people driven to simplify
the complexity of global data networking. That's
our goal here at 3Com. And we're making it
happen thanks to continued strong demand for
our core products: network adapters, terminal
servers, wiring hubs and internetworking
products. As an industry pioneer, we'll settle for
nothing less than ongoing innovation with the
next-generation of technology.
Ultimately, our networks go the distance! So do our
people. See how far you can go in the following
opportunities at 3Com.
