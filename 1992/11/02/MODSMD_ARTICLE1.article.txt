## 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
Despite gains by President
Bush and independent candi
date Ross Perot, Gov. Bill Clin
ton still retains a commanding
50 percent lead among Stan
ford student voters, according
to a Daily poll.
Democratic candidates for
both of California's Senate
seats and the local congression
al race all continue to enjoy
strong support at Stanford.

In the last two weeks, Bush
and Perot have closed in on
Clinton's lead, both in nation
wide polls and at Stanford. Sev
enteen percent of students sur
veyed Thursday night said they
plan to vote for Bush and Vice
President Dan Quayle, up from
12 percent two weeks ago.
Ten percent of respondents
said they plan to cast their bal
lot for Perot and running mate
James Stockdale, doubling his
support.
Democratic nominee Clin
ton and running mate A 1 Gore
received the support of 67 per
cent of the respondents, down
from 71 percent two weeks ago.
Six percent of students said
they are still undecided.
The Stanford trend mirrors
national polls, which show
Bush narrowing Clinton's lead.
A Gallup poll conducted for
CNN and USA Today, released
yesterday, shows Clinton with
a scant 3 percent lead over
Bush. Several weeks ago, the

Democrat enjoyed a double-digit
margin of support over his rival.
The Daily poll, which surveyed
315 Stanford students who are
registered voters and plan to vote
tomorrow, has a margin of error of
plus or minus 5.7 percent.
Democratic Senate candidates
Barbara Boxer and Dianne Fein
stein have large leads on the Farm.
Seventy percent of students said
they plan to vote for Boxer for Cal
ifornia's six-year seat and 68 per
cent said will they vote for Fein
stein for the two-year seat.
But just as the presidential
race has tightened in the last
week, Boxer, a Marin County
Congress woman, has found her
self with only the narrowest of
leads going into tomorrow's elec
tion.
Statewide, her challenger,
Bruce Herschensohn, a conserva
tive television commentator from
Los Angeles, has pulled within one
point, according to the latest Field
Poll. The survey, released Friday,
showed Boxer at 44 percent and
Herschensohn at 43 percent in the

race for the six-year Senate seat.
But on campus, Herschensohn
currently ei\joys the support of
only 18 percent of voters, up from
9 percent two weeks ago.
Feinstein's challenger, John
Seymour, is backed by 19 percent
of students, a six-point rise since
the last campus poll. Statewide,
Seymour also trails Fein stein at a
distance, 36 percent to 50 percent,
according to the Field Poll.
In the race for the 14th District
Congressional seat, the mid-Octo
ber Daily poll found the "undecid
ed" category to be the front runner
among students.
But as the election nears, 58
percent of Stanford voters said
they plan to vote for Democratic
candidate Anna Eshoo. Republi
can candidate Tom Huening is
supported by 22 percent of stu
dents, and 17 percent said they are
still undecided.
Two weeks ago, 31 percent sup
ported Eshoo, 9 percent backed
Huening and 59 percent said they
had not yet chosen a candidate.
Sixty percent of survey respon
dents were male and 40 percent
female. Graduate students made
up 41 percent of the polled group,
while 59 percent of those surveyed
were undergraduates.
