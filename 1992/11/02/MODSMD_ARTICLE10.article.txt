Pakistan train crash kills 14
SUKKUR, Pakistan (AP) — An express train
packed with sleeping passengers slammed into a
parked freight train yesterday, and at least 1,000
soldiers crawled through the mangled wreckage to
search for survivors and recover bodies.
As darkness fell, they pulled the 14th body from
the wreckage. It wasn't known how many bodies
were still buried beneath the twisted metal, but rail
way officials said it was probably not more than five
or six.
About 60 people, many of them seriously
injured, were rushed to the nearest hospital, about
50 miles away, the state-run Associated Press of
Pakistan reported.
Possible anti-AIDS drug developed
DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Duke University Medi
cal Center researchers say they have created a pro

tein fragment that stops the AIDS virus from
infecting human cells in laboratory tests.
The finding could open the door to a new class of
drugs against HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. But
researchers warned there's no guarantee of success
and said a new drug wouldn't be developed quickly.
A report on the advance will be published this
week in the Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences.
Columbia space shuttle lands
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Columbia
swooped through a clear sky and landed at NASA's
spaceport yesterday with six astronauts who
released a laser-reflecting satellite and tested a
robotic eye during their 10-day journey.
Columbia landed on the concrete runway at
Kennedy Space Center at 9:05 a.m. EST. Columbia
traveled 4.1 million miles during its voyage, which
began Oct. 22, and circled Earth 159 times.
