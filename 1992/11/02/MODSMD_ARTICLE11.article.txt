cease-fire between government
and rebels troops in Angola,
where two days of fighting had
threatened to renew civil war.
The cease-fire took effect at
12:01 a.m. today and details will be
worked out by U.N. officials in the
southern African nation, accord
ing to a statement issued by Joe
Sills, a spokesman for the U.N.
Secretary-General in New York.
The statement also said for
eigners being held by the warring
sides would be released. Sills was
not immediately available to elab
orate on how many foreigners
were being held and by whom.
Unconfirmed reports yesterday
said at least 100 people died over

the weekend in battles that threat
ened to ruin the 1991 peace accords
between UNITA — the National
Union for the Total Independence
of Angola — and the ruling MP LA
party, the Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola.
The accords halted a 16-year
civil war in what was once a Cold
War battleground.
Yesterday, government forces
backed by armored personnel carri
ers and armed civilians moved
against UNITA strongholds in the
capital, pounding the rebels with
mortar shells and machine-gun fire.
Portuguese news reports said
two U.N. monitors were among
the dead. Officials at the U.N.
mission in Luanda monitoring
the peace accords said they could
not confirm the report.

Angola first became engulfed in
civil war after gaining indepen
dence from Portugal in 1975. At
least 350,000 people died in the
fighting.
Cuba and the Soviet Union
armed the government, and the
United States and South Africa
backed UNITA.
Some of the heaviest fighting
raged in Luanda's diplomatic dis
trict of Miramar, where a UNITA
garrison resisted with mortars
and rocket-propelled grenades.
The fighting, which began Satur
day, followed elections in September
in which UNITA trailed the govern
ing party. U.N. voting monitors said
the balloting was generally free and
fair. Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi had
threatened to fight rather than
accept electoral defeat.
