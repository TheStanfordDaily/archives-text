## Clinton's vision thing 
### 
His stance on social
issues makes him right
choice over Bush, Perot

IT'S A VISION THING. A
vision of what this country
should look like when we grad
uate, head out into that big, lonely
job market and raise our kids.
Gov. Bill Clinton has led in the
polls because of the economy. The
buzzwords of the campaign —
"change" and "youth" — directly
translate to "small bank account."
When things aren't going well, the
gut reaction is to hand the incum
bent a rope.
The campaign has been reduced
to a boring economics class at a
junior college. We're not electing
the chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board — Alan Greenspan
isn't going anywhere.
What we're electing is an emo
tional and political leader. Clinton
— partially due to youth and par
tially due to political experience —
is riding the crest of a wave of
American discontent, while George
Bush is lollygagging in his cigarette
boat.
Clinton, slick, smooth and con
ciliatory as he might be, is willing
to take on progressive issues which
are currently unpopular, if they
seem to be in line with the direc
tion the country is heading
toward.
In Clinton's multi-media pre
sentation available on the Apple
Macintosh, gay and lesbian rights
is addressed as one of his eight
main issues. And while bringing
gays into the military may not be
popular with the white suburban
voters he seeks, Clinton's position
is one which recognizes the direc
tion in which American attitudes
are heading.
Likewise, Clinton's stances or
women's rights, health care, abor
tion, education and the environ
ment reflect a forward-looking

vision that contrasts dramatically
with that of the backward religious
right which has controlled much of
the Bush campaign.
Ross Perot emerged as a power
ful force in the campaign because
he directly addresses the nation's
future, particularly the deficit,
social security burden and other
economic problems which we will
have to face in the not-too-distant
future. These, in fact, are the polit
ically dangerous issues which our
next president must address.
But Perot isn't the man to do it.
The ideas he proposes — electron
ic town meetings, steamrolling
bills through Congress — show lit
tle respect for our system of checks
and balances. Perot has no experi
ence in politics (although he's been
involved in the underbelly of it all
for a while), and bringing his
inevitable frustration to the people
could shake things up in all the
wrong ways.
Clinton's experience, his ability
to work with Congressional leader
ship — as proven through his
experience in the moderate-lean
ing Democratic Leadership Coun
cil — will be an important step in
making real legislation out of his
"vision thing."
Bush's vision reared its head at
the Republican Convention in
August. Its power consisted almost
solely of anti-gay, anti-Hillary
speeches by the religious right.
Since the convention, Bush has
given up on the vision thing and
moved on to the trust thing — which
isn't washing with anyone. Iraqgate,
the Iran-Contra affair and his
1988 tax pledge all damage Bush's
ability to be an influential leader.
Bill Clinton may not be the
most straightforward politician on
the block, and some of his propos
als (a nation-wide apprenticeship
program?) may be ridiculously
unfeasible, but he can provide the
direction this country needs. He's
aware enough of what this coun
try is thinking and feeling that he
can adjust his policies to the way
we're going — not to where we've
been.
