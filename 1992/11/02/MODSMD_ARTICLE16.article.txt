## Wanted: some real heroes 
### 
We tell ourselves not to look, but
we can't help it. There's some
thing basic and irresistible about
their attraction that pleads for our atten
tion. And if we allow ourselves just a lit
tle peek — it's inevitable — soon we put
our grubby hands to work, revealing for
bidden secrets we know we'll feel guilty
about later.
No, I'm not talking about Peter
Huyck's bouncing sorority girls. I'm
talking about those damned supermar
ket tabloids.
When did we develop this appetite for
dirt? We know that Delta Burke has
never joined Roseanne and Tom Arnold
in a swinging sexual tryst, but that
doesn't stop us from flipping to a page
promising fake photographs and emo
tional scars.
There are no rules in today's game of
public humiliation, and the tabloids
aren't the only contestants. If your name
is public knowledge your private life is
too, and it seems that the entire media
corps strives to ensure this equality.
The past was strikingly different.
They had heroes then, characters larger
than life, adored by millions. John F.
Kennedy. Babe Ruth. James Dean. Like
the protagonists from our greatest liter
ary classics, these heroes came complete
with their tragic (and sometimes fatal)
flaws.
But the urgency to expose them didn't

eat away at the public as it does today.
People knew about Kennedy's womaniz
ing, Ruth's heavy drinking, and Dean's
dangerously fast living. Yet they under
stood that these traits didn't completely
define the men — that they were only
minor components within a bigger pic
ture of greatness.
That same ability to place a healthy
perspective on life doesn't exist in a soci
ety that creates new celebrities
overnight and destroys them by noon.
We thrust new cultural icons into the
sky like clay pigeons, only to shoot them
back down again with an unhealthy
bloodlust.
Why can't we have a Kennedy, a Ruth
or a Dean today? Why are we stuck with
Gary Hart, Pete Rose and Rob Lowe?
Wby do we derive so much satisfaction
out of exposing our idols as human —
and scorning them for it?
The press acts lecherously, to be sure.
Spending weeks trailing political candi
dates in the hopes of uncovering a new
Gennifer Flowers isn't journalism.
Defending the unauthorized revelation
of Arthur Ashe's AIDS condition as the
"public's right to know" isn't just wrong,
it's sick. Rut they wouldn't be selling if
no one was buying, and we line up in
droves to consume the personal lives of
our public figures.
Perhaps it makes us feel better inside
to know that nobody's perfect. Maybe

checking up on the Betty Ford Clinic's
guest list periodically reassures us that
everyone can be just as corrupt as we are.
I don't really need to know that Jose
Canseco breaks the sound barrier with a
loaded gun in his car, or that Woody
Allen lingers a bit too long when he kiss
es his daughter good night. These all rate
about a negative five on the "Things
That Really Matter to Me" list. But for
some bizarre reason I lap it up anyway.
Ultimately, we aren't looking for
heroes anymore. We're buying self
esteem by dragging down figures we
used to strain our necks looking up to.
In our over-scrutinization of America's
cultural icons, we're inwardly hoping to
discover that in fact we are the true
heroes.
Isn't the price too high to pay? Why
do we need to make ourselves feel better
at the expense of leaving no one for our
children to look up to?
I want my heroes back.
Just give me a couple more minutes in
the checkout line.
