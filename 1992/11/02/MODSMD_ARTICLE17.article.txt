Men's group forms to explore gender roles, issues

IAM WRITING IN RESPONSE to
Andrea Parke's Oct. 20 column enti
tled "Non-Sexism isn't an excuse."
At one point she jokingly encourages
men to form a group that could be
named "Men for Change for Women."
When I read this suggestion, I laughed
aloud, but it was not for the sexist rea
sons some may assume.
I thought her suggestion was ironic,
because I was, in fact, in the process of
establishing a group similar to the one
she desired.
This organization had its first meet
ing on Wednesday, Oct. 28, and nine
eager men attended even though there
was little advertisement. We engaged in
a brainstorming session in order to
develop aims for our new men's group.

Although we are not yet set on our
plans, our efforts will probably center
around two main goals:
•to explore ourselves as "men" and
how gender roles affect us.
•to lead outreach programs with
other men that facilitate open and hon
est discussions on violence against
women and gender issues.
Our group will probably not be
named "Men for Change for Women,"
because the name is too limiting. We
seek changes because they benefit both
women and men. For example, both
women and men suffer from rape
because both women and men are raped.
In May, 1988, the Rape Education
Project surveyed over 1,000 Stanford
students and approximately one in eight

men reported being sexually coerced at
least once in their lives. In addition,
both men and women have loved ones
that we do not want to see raped.
Somewhere between one in four and
one in three women are raped in their
lifetime. That means that every person
who reads this letter will probably have
a mother, sister or wife/girlfriend/part
ner raped. If you do not want that to
happen, I encourage you to take an
active part in changing the structure of
female-male interactions.
Both men and women endure rela
tionships that are affected by socially
constructed gender roles. These norms
result in behaviors that are detrimental
to healthy interactions, including
women subordinating their needs and

feelings to their partners and men being
trained not to share their inner feelings.
This does not have to be the case;
more satisfying relationships can be con
structed.
If male readers wish to join the new
men's group in order to help improve
their relationships and to gain a better
understanding of themselves, please
come to our meetings, Mondays at 9
p.m. We do not have a regular meeting
site, but we should by the time of publi
cation. Therefore, call me at 497-5950
for information.
We have control over our lives, but
we each have to actively pursue change
to make it happen. The choice is ours.
