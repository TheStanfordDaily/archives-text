# Faculty Senate passes domestic partners bill, rejects good morals
## 
### 
Ross Perot got one thing very right:
The future of our children is a sacred
responsibility. On these clear and simple
grounds, the action of our Faculty Sen
ate in voting to support the irresponsi
bility of pseudo-marriages — homosexu
al pairs — and unmarried couples, out of
a Woody Allenesque permissiveness, is
exactly the sort of thing that has mas
sively discredited academics in the eyes
of sophisticated citizens in the world at
large.
The failure to support the basic moral
fabric of the nation is in a lineage with
all the other academic cop-outs: the
refusal to endorse preparation for the
wars against Hitler and Saddam, the
refusal to stand up to the Soviet Union
and inability to think anything through
to the long-range needs of mankind.
The kind of steadfastness in the name

of deep principle that Admiral Stockdale
stood for can find no resonance on this
campus.
