As you prepare for your futures,
many of you are worried about whether
there will be jobs for you when you grad
uate — jobs in which you can apply all
you've learned, and through which you
can realize the American dream.
I want all of you to have the opportu
nity to graduate from college, repay your
student loans, begin your careers and
start families of your own.
My "Agenda for American Renewal"
will do just that by reinvigorating Amer
ica's economy and creating jobs and
opportunities for all Americans while
protecting our environment.
Revitalizing America's economy

starts with individuals, families and
communities. It requires lower taxes on
individuals and businesses, enhancing
competition and cutting regulation. It
includes health care for all Americans,
child care, job training, housing opportu
nities, a competitive school system based
on community involvement and choice
for American families.
My "Agenda" prepares America's
youth for the 21st century by promoting
national academic standards so schools
like Stanford have a strong student pop
ulation from which to draw.
For you college students, my admin
istration calls for the largest-ever one
year increase in student Pell Grants,
and a 50 percent increase in the
amounts of individual Pell Grant
awards. In addition, I want to raise the
loan limit on guaranteed student loans
and make the interest on student loans
deductible for federal income tax pur
poses.
My "Agenda" calls for continued sub
stantial funding for responsible environ
mental protection. The United States
has the toughest environmental laws of

earth, and it was the Bush administra
tion that proposed and negotiated the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,
which I signed as the most protective
and market-oriented clean air laws in
the world.
My administration also established a
moratorium on offshore oil and natural
gas drilling; accelerated the phaseout of
ozone harming substances; added more
than 1.5 million acres to America's
national parks, wildlife refugees and
other public lands; tripled the rate of
toxic waste site cleanups since 1989;
and collected more fines and penalties
and secured more prison sentences for
environmental crimes in the last three
years than in the previous 20 years
combined.
My "Agenda for American Renewal"
empowers all Americans to make their
own choices and better their lives. No
one will be left behind for want of
opportunity.
Good luck to you, and may you
achieve your goals in life.
