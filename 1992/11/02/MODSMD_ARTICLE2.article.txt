# Polls show Clinton has a hold on Ivy League schools
## 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
With one day left in the race for the
White House, Gov. Bill Clinton may
have to worry about voter support in the
South and Midwest. But among stu
dents at America's top universities, the
Democratic nominee can rest easy.
Similar to the results at Stanford, 65
percent of students at Ivy League col
leges and universities express strong
support for Clinton, according to polls
conducted by individual campus news
papers. President Bush received the
backing of 17 percent of student voters
and independent candidate Ross Perot
netted 7 percent. Eleven percent said
they were undecided or planned to vote
for another candidate.

Support for Clinton at individual
schools ranged from 79 percent at tradi
tionally liberal Brown to 51 percent at
the University of Pennsylvania. Seven
ty-four percent of students at Harvard,
73 percent of those at Yale, 64 percent at
Princeton and Columbia as well as 63
percent at Dartmouth said they support
the Arkansas governor.
The president's support ranged from
24 percent at Princeton to 9 percent at
Brown.
In addition, the respondents said
that the job market, abortion, education
and health care were the most impor
tant issues influencing their votes.
The polls, conducted in late October,
surveyed roughly 5 percent of each
school's undergraduate student body.
The margin of error for each survey is

between 5 and 7.7 percent in either di
rection. No poll was conducted at Cor
nell University.
Among other polls, an informal sur
vey of 161 students conducted at the
University of Southern California after
the first presidential debate showed
Clinton with a 47 to 26 percent lead
over Bush. Perot received 14 percent.
Senate hopefuls Barbara Boxer and
Dianne Feinstein also received strong
support from USC students, with more
than 60 percent supporting each candi
date.
Support for candidates at most top
public schools, such as UC-Berkeley,
UCLA, Washington, Texas and Indiana
have not be determined because their
campus newspapers have not conducted
pres. polls.
