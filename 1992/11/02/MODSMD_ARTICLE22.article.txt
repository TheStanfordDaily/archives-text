## Cardinal victimized as Huskies regain No.1 rank Stanford loses Rose hopes in 41-7 trouncing 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE — The Washington Huskies
left no doubt that they remain a notch
above the rest of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence as they embarrassed the over
matched Cardinal in a 41-7 Halloween
bashing.
Behind a frighteningly impressive
defensive performance, the Huskies (8-0
overall, 5-0 in the Pac-10) moved one
step closer to Pasadena and dashed Stan
ford's already waning Rose Bowl aspira
tions.
Steve Stenstrom and Justin Armour
treated an ABC television audience to an
early 7-0 Stanford lead with a 31-yard
first quarter scoring connection. If Bill
Walsh and his struggling squad didn't
draw solace from the fact that the Dawgs
hadn't trailed an opponent since last
November, they should have.
Because from that point on, the game
was a Cardinal nightmare.
Walsh said he could see disaster com
ing. Even on the first scoring drive, the
Cardinal (6-3, 3-2) couldn't suppress
Washington's heavy pass rush. "We really
came unraveled offensively," Walsh said.
"We just didn't protect the passer."
That lack of protection plagued the
Cardinal to the tune of seven sacks and
another Stenstrom injury. Indeed, the
pass rushing Dawgs were chomping at the
bit all game long and it looked like the
Stanford signal callers were wearing
Milkbone underwear.
Stenstrom's plight, however, was not
one to mock. The junior quarterback
again took a plethora of poundings that
culminated in a badly sprained left wrist
after he was stepped on during a ferocious
second quarter hit.
Stenstrom did not return, and fresh
man backup Mark Butterfield fared only
slightly better against the onslaught. He
completed eight of his 18 passing
attempts for 117 yards, was sacked twice
and coughed up one fumble.
Yet the problem with the Cardinal is
not at the quarterback position. Nor, for
that matter, is it at running back or wide
receiver. Stanford's offensive ineptitude
boils down to this: the line is performing
miserably. And never was it more obvious
than in Husky Stadium.
Granted, they were up against the
nation's second-rated defense (in points
allowed) that sent five rushers into the
backfield on a regular basis. The deafen
ing crowd noise (so loud that center Glen
Cavanaugh said even he couldn't hear
audibles) couldn't have helped, either.
But that doesn't explain their apparent
decision to perform matador imperson
ations for 60 frustrating minutes. Rarely
did plays even have a chance to develop.
Seven sacks and another dozen clean hits

on the quarterbacks say enough about the
pass protection.
Stanford's running game suffered as
well. Blocks were not held on the weak
side of off-tackle plays. Too many times,
Milburn was hit before he even reached
the line of scrimmage. The Cardinal aver
aged less than a yard per first-down rush.
This is a disappointing performance for
a line that returned four starters from a
year ago and was expected to be a strong
point of the Stanford squad.
The Huskies' front five, on the other
hand, dominated their end of the game.
Led by 6-foot-7, 325-pound Lincoln
Kennedy, a front-runner for the Lombar
di Award, Washington's offensive line
completely neutralized the Cardinal pass
rush and eventually wore them down with
a punishing attack.
All told, the Huskies piled up 467 yards
against what was the nation's third-rated
defense. Sophomore tailback Napoleon
Kaufman ate Stanford alive on the
ground with 87 yards on 11 carries, but it
was his scintillating 65-yard punt return
that turned the game in Washington's
favor.
With less than five minutes to go in the
first period, the Cardinal defense had
stuffed three consecutive Husky drives
and was holding on to a seven-point lead.
But Kaufman took a short Paul Stone
house punt down the sideline and fol
lowed a herd of blockers to the Stanford
four-yard line. Three plays later, Wash
ington quarterback Mark Brunell scram
bled 20 yards behind the line of scrim
mage on a broken play before finding Leif
Johnson wide open in the corner of the
end zone.
The Huskies followed up with an
impressive 11-play, 85-yard drive on their
next possession to take a 14-7 lead. And
after James Clifford picked off an errant
Stenstrom toss and ran it back 40 yards
for a 21-7 lead, the game, from the Cardi
nal's perspective, became an exercise in
damage control.
The loss dropped Stanford out of the
nation's top 20 for the first time in eight
weeks. The latest Associated Press poll
ranks the Cardinal No. 21, and the team
stands at No. 22 in the CNN/USA Today
rankings.
Washington's dominating performance
swayed enough AP voters to reclaim the
No. 1 ranking from Miami, although the
Hurricanes held on the CNN/USA Today
top spot.
The road gets no easier for the hum
bled Cardinal. Saturday they face No. 11
USC in a crucial Pac-10 game. A win over
its long-standing Southern California
rival could re-elevate Stanford into major
bowl contention. A loss, however, would
drop the Cardinal to a mediocre 3-3 in the
conference and likely out of the national
rankings altogether.

house punt down the sideline and fol
lowed a herd of blockers to the Stanford
four-yard line. Three plays later, Wash
ington quarterback Mark Brunell scram
bled 20 yards behind the line of scrim
mage on a broken play before finding Leif
Johnson wide open in the corner of the
end zone.
The Huskies followed up with an
impressive 11-play, 85-yard drive on their
next possession to take a 14-7 lead. And
after James Clifford picked off an errant
Stenstrom toss and ran it back 40 yards
for a 21-7 lead, the game, from the Cardi
nal's perspective, became an exercise in
damage control.
The loss dropped Stanford out of the
nation's top 20 for the first time in eight
weeks. The latest Associated Press poll
ranks the Cardinal No. 21, and the team
stands at No. 22 in the CNN/USA Today
rankings.
Washington's dominating performance
swayed enough AP voters to reclaim the
No. 1 ranking from Miami, although the
Hurricanes held on the CNN/USA Today
top spot.
The road gets no easier for the hum
bled Cardinal. Saturday they face No. 11
USC in a crucial Pac-10 game. A win over
its long-standing Southern California
rival could re-elevate Stanford into major
bowl contention. A loss, however, would
drop the Cardinal to a mediocre 3-3 in the
conference and likely out of the national
rankings altogether.

Steve Stenstrom is punished by Washington lineman Steve Hoffmann in the first half of last Saturday's game. Stenstrom
was Injured in the second quarter, but is expected to return to action when the Cardinal faces USC this week.
SEATTLE — The Washington Huskies
left no doubt that they remain a notch
above the rest of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence as they embarrassed the over
matched Cardinal in a 41-7 Halloween
bashing.
Behind a frighteningly impressive
defensive performance, the Huskies (8-0
overall, 5-0 in the Pac-10) moved one
step closer to Pasadena and dashed Stan
ford's already waning Rose Bowl aspira
tions.
Steve Stenstrom and Justin Armour
treated an ABC television audience to an
early 7-0 Stanford lead with a 31-yard
first quarter scoring connection. If Bill
Walsh and his struggling squad didn't
draw solace from the fact that the Dawgs
hadn't trailed an opponent since last
November, they should have.
Because from that point on, the game
was a Cardinal nightmare.
Walsh said he could see disaster com
ing. Even on the first scoring drive, the
Cardinal (6-3, 3-2) couldn't suppress
Washington's heavy pass rush. "We really
came unraveled offensively," Walsh said.
"We just didn't protect the passer."
That lack of protection plagued the
Cardinal to the tune of seven sacks and
another Stenstrom injury. Indeed, the
pass rushing Dawgs were chomping at the
bit all game long and it looked like the
Stanford signal callers were wearing
Milkbone underwear.
Stenstrom's plight, however, was not
one to mock. The junior quarterback
again took a plethora of poundings that
culminated in a badly sprained left wrist
after he was stepped on during a ferocious
second quarter hit.
Stenstrom did not return, and fresh
man backup Mark Butterfield fared only
slightly better against the onslaught. He
completed eight of his 18 passing
attempts for 117 yards, was sacked twice
and coughed up one fumble.
Yet the problem with the Cardinal is
not at the quarterback position. Nor, for
that matter, is it at running back or wide
receiver. Stanford's offensive ineptitude
boils down to this: the line is performing
miserably. And never was it more obvious
than in Husky Stadium.
Granted, they were up against the
nation's second-rated defense (in points
allowed) that sent five rushers into the
backfield on a regular basis. The deafen
ing crowd noise (so loud that center Glen
Cavanaugh said even he couldn't hear
audibles) couldn't have helped, either.
But that doesn't explain their apparent
decision to perform matador imperson
ations for 60 frustrating minutes. Rarely
did plays even have a chance to develop.
Seven sacks and another dozen clean hits

on the quarterbacks say enough about the
pass protection.
Stanford's running game suffered as
well. Blocks were not held on the weak
side of off-tackle plays. Too many times,
Milburn was hit before he even reached
the line of scrimmage. The Cardinal aver
aged less than a yard per first-down rush.
This is a disappointing performance for
a line that returned four starters from a
year ago and was expected to be a strong
point of the Stanford squad.
The Huskies' front five, on the other
hand, dominated their end of the game.
Led by 6-foot-7, 325-pound Lincoln
Kennedy, a front-runner for the Lombar
di Award, Washington's offensive line
completely neutralized the Cardinal pass
rush and eventually wore them down with
a punishing attack.
All told, the Huskies piled up 467 yards
against what was the nation's third-rated
defense. Sophomore tailback Napoleon
Kaufman ate Stanford alive on the
ground with 87 yards on 11 carries, but it
was his scintillating 65-yard punt return
that turned the game in Washington's
favor.
With less than five minutes to go in the
first period, the Cardinal defense had
stuffed three consecutive Husky drives
and was holding on to a seven-point lead.
But Kaufman took a short Paul Stone
house punt down the sideline and fol
lowed a herd of blockers to the Stanford
four-yard line. Three plays later, Wash
ington quarterback Mark Brunell scram
bled 20 yards behind the line of scrim
mage on a broken play before finding Leif
