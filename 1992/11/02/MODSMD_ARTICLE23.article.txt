# Bowl still probable for gridders
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
Despite their crushing defeat at the
hands of the Washington Huskies this
past Saturday, all is not lost for the Car
dinal. Although the loss effectively
extinguished the team's Rose Bowl
hopes, Stanford could still earn a place
in one of the more lucrative bowl games
this winter.
With the loss, the Cardinal dropped
to 6-3 overall and 3-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference. They are now tied for
fourth in the conference standings with
Washington State, which lost to Oregon
this weekend, 34-17.
Despite falling behind both USC and
Arizona in the conference standings, the
team largely controls its own destiny as
to whether Stanford will win the race
for second place. Next week, the Cardi
nal returns home for two consecutive
games against the Trojans and the
Cougars.
Assuming that Washington beats
Arizona in Tucson this weekend, the
clash with the Trojans this Saturday

could determine who finishes second in
the conference. USC is on a roll, having
won four games in a row, including a 23-
13 victory over Arizona State in Tempe.
The Trojans are now 5-1-1 overall and 4-
1 in the Pac-10.
In this respect, the Cardinal has a
favorable schedule. USC has to venture
into Stanford Stadium on Parents'
Weekend, with the Cougars to follow
on Nov. 14. Stanford will wrap up reg
ular-season play on Nov. 21 with Big
Game at Memorial Stadium in Berke
ley.
USC and Arizona have more treach
erous roads ahead. After Arizona hosts
Washington, the two teams will clash
in Los Angeles. USC will then play at
UCLA in the Southern California ver
sion of Big Game and battle national
power Notre Dame in its final contest.
Arizona finishes its season by hosting
the ASU Sun Devils.
If Stanford can somehow pull itself
together and win its last three games, a
9-3 finish would put them in contention
for a bowl birth. With the new bowl
coalition, it is difficult to project where

the second place team in the Pac-10 will
go. The new system places teams in
bowls based on their ranking at the end
of the season.
For those who watched the game
against the Huskies, it is difficult to
imagine Stanford pulling out a 9-3
record. However, it is not necessary for
the Cardinal to win all three games to
get into a bowl. With the brutal schedule
Stanford has played this year, even win
ning one out of the three remaining
games would place the Cardinal in some
bowl with a 7-5 record.
Given how well Stanford has per
formed this season despite the schedule
and the injuries, Cardinal players say
there is no room for lowering expecta
tions in the wake of last weekend's
demoralizing loss. Team members con
tend they are looking ahead and are
ready to take on their remaining com
petitors.
Senior free safety John Lynch stated
the case with confidence. "We're going
to make the most of our season," he
said. "We have too much character to go
down the tubes."
