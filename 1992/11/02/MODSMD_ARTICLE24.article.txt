### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team got only half of what it
wanted during its Los Angeles
road trip last weekend. But
according to head coach Don
Shaw, that's just fine.
The second-ranked Cardinal
(18-2, 11-2 in Pacific 10 Confer
ence play) split its two matches in
L.A. this weekend, falling to the
No. 1 UCLA Bruins on Friday,
15-3, 15-7, 15-12, then rebound
ing against No. 10 USC on Satur
day, 15-11, 15-8, 16-14.
"We really decided to focus on
USC this weekend," Shaw said.
"We know we'll hit UCLA again,
and that's when it will count."
Unlike the first meeting
between Stanford and UCLA this
year, a five-game nail-biter before
5,600 fans at Maples Pavilion,
this match wasn't even close. The
defending national champions
dominated from the first point,
led by senior Natalie Williams'
blazing .500 hitting percentage
with 16 kills, six digs and five
blocks.
Senior Marissa Hatchett also tal
lied 13 kills, four digs and four
blocks with a .456 hitting per
centage, while Elaine Youngs
added seven kills, 10 digs and a
.429 hitting percentage.
Stanford found itself out
gunned by the solid Bruin offen
sive attack, managing only a .092
hitting percentage on the match,
including a - .083 mark in the sec
ond game. Still, the Cardinal
managed to put together key
individual performances from
senior tri-captain Bev Oden,
freshman hitter Cary Wendell,
senior hitter Kristi Paaso and
freshman hitter Wendy Hromad
ka. Oden led the Stanford effort
with 12 kills and six digs, hitting
.222 for the match. Wendell
added seven kills and six digs,
while Paaso and Hromadka each

had five kills and six digs for the
Cardinal.
Saturday's match against
USC, however, was all Cardinal.
The Trojans took Stanford to
four games in the two teams' last
meeting at Maples on Oct. 2, but
this time Stanford swept USC out
of Lyon Center in three. Oden
and Wendell combined to lead
Stanford in the match. Oden reg
istered a .225 hitting percentage
with 16 kills, 11 digs, two blocks
and a Cardinal season-best five
aces on the match, while Wendell
added 16 kills, 14 digs and three
blocks. Senior setter Carrie Feld
man directed the Stanford
offense, putting up 45 assists in
the match and posting a .500 hit
ting percentage, while Paaso
added nine kills and 14 digs for
the Cardinal. Five players regis
tered double-digits in digs,
including Wendell, Paaso, Oden,
tri-captain Laurie Sawin and
senior hitter Jennifer Jackson.
For the Trojans, Cica Baccelli
and captain Katie Haller posted
team-leading numbers in the los
ing effort. Baccelli hit .265 on the
match with 16 kills, 11 digs and
six blocks, while Haller hit .243
with 13 kills, 21 digs and five
blocks. No other USC player hit
over .150 in the match, and the
Trojans finished with a .123 team
hitting average.
Stanford put together a team
best 83 digs in Saturday's match,
while solidifying its hold on the
second-place position in the Pac
-10. Stanford wrapped up its regu

and UCLA, and can now only
meet them again in the NCAA
Tournament — a fact of which
Shaw is all too aware.
