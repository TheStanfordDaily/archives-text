# Women win two, await playoff news

### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
After 18 regular-season games, including
two victories over the weekend, the post-sea
son fate of the Stanford women's soccer team
will be determined by an NCAA selection com
mittee this morning.
The top two squads in each of the four
regions receive bids, with the No. 1 seed get
ting a first-round bye. The committee also
chooses four more teams as at-large selections.
After the Cardinal edged Connecticut 2-1
and thrashed Washington State 5-0, Stanford
coach Berhane Andeberhan is optimistic
about his team's chances for a playoff berth.
"All I can feel reasonably comfortable
about is that we'll be playoffs. In my opinion,
we have a chance to be the No. 1 or No. 2. seed
in the region," he said.
Yesterday, Stanford outfought the Huskies
to complete the weekend sweep and all but
assure the squad a playoff berth.

Both teams had scoring chances early, but
Stanford drew blood first on a give-and-go by
Andrea Johnson and Julie Foudy. Johnson
slid a pass to Foudy and beat the defender
through the penalty box, where she received
the ball from the senior midfielder and angled
a shot sharply to the left corner of the net.
Near the end of the half, a bit of a Stanford
letdown resulted in a barrage of Husky shots.
However, Cardinal goalie Chris Massell and
the rest of the defense held the lead.
Fifteen minutes into the second period, the
Cardinal scored again. On a free kick, Foudy
sent the ball arcing toward the goal, where for
wards Sarah Rafanelli and Vicky Haring were
poised. Rafanelli made contact on a header
directly in front of the goal, but the ball
bounced off the crossbar to Haring, who made
a diving header into the net.
While Stanford held a 2-0 advantage, Con
necticut had several opportunities to tighten
the match. The Huskies' leading scorer,
Denise Swenson, had breakaways down the

right side of the field. Both times she shot
early and sent the ball wide left.
But Swenson finally scored near the end of
the game when fullback Melinda Minstrell
slipped on the sloppy turf, allowing Swenson a
clear path to the Cardinal goal. But, despite
the last-minute score, Stanford controlled
most of the game.
For the most part, Andeberhan was pleased
with the team's play, especially that of Hanng
and Johnson. However, he said the team could
have slowed down play more when it was ahead.
The Cardinal was able to control play dur
ing most of the match, partly because the
Huskies were without the services of defender
Jennifer Strong. The absence of the national
team starter allowed Andeberhan to use
Rafanelli, who is nursing a sore leg, sparingly.
But the junior forward plans to be on the
field next week if the Cardinal doesn't receive
a first-round bye in the NCAA tourney.
"There's no way I'd miss that," she said. "It's
now or nothing."
