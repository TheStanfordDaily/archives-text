# Men shot down by Falcons in season finale
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Going into last Saturday's game
against Division II powerhouse
Seattle Pacific, the Stanford men's
soccer team was looking to get
back on track after yielding a 1-0
loss to the Washington Huskies in
last week's conference-title match.
Instead, Cardinal confidence
took another serious blow as the
underdog Falcons upended Divi
sion I Stanford (11-6-1, 5-2-0 in
MPSF action) in a very physical 2-
1 contest.
Seattle Pacific (13-3-0 in the
Olympic league) took the early
lead in the first half with a perfect
ly executed drive deep in Cardinal
territory. From the far sidelines.
Falcon midfielder Dion F,arl beat
his defender and easily crossed the
ball in front of Stanford's goal, set
ting up forward Jason Farrell's
first score of the match.
in the half, Stanford came

back to tie the game on a goal that
resulted from a questionable foul
called against the Falcon backfield
ers. That allowed senior midfielder
Jason Vanacour to boot in a five
yard penalty kick for his team
leading ninth goal of the season.
Neanng the end of regulation,
the score remained knotted at 1-1.
Stanford had the edge in shots on
goal by a margin of 15 to 14, as
both teams continually challenged
their opponent's defenders.
The Cardinal defense broke
down first with a series of unforced
turnovers deep in their backfield.
The Falcons had several opportu
nities to finish the game, but Stan
ford goalkeeper and co-captain
Kyle Krpata stymied their attacks.
Then, on a routine play, the Car
dinal defenders experienced a com
munication breakdown as Krpata
cleared the ball out of the goal box
before his teammates were back in
position. The Falcons' Farrell took
advantage of the confusion by rac

ing back to cut off Krpata's pass.
He then rocketed the ball past
Krpata, the lone defender, for the
unassisted game-winner.
"Overall, it was a typically frus
trating game for us," said head
coach Colin Lindores. "We've
reached a point in the season
where we're just not playing well.
Instead of raising our game up at
the end of the season, we seem to
be making mistakes that other
teams normally make at the begin
ning of the year. We're creating
more and more ways to self
destruct. It's very disappointing."
On top of that, the Cardinal
may have lost forward Ryan
Collins, their leading scorer last
year, to a broken nose. Collins was
injured during the second half
when a Falcon flew past him and
apparently threw a straight-arm
into his face. There was no subse
quent misconduct foul on the Fal
cons, as the referee consistently
allowed a very physical game to be

played.
Postgame X-rays show that
Collins' nose was cleanly broken in
three places, and surgery today will
determine whether he can suit up
for next week's conference playoffs.
By losing its last two regular
season games, Stanford now has to
sweep all other MPSF contenders
in next week's conference tourna
ment in order to secure a definite
playoff berth. If they had won or
tied against Washington and Seat
tle Pacific, a 1-1 showing in the
conference finals would have been
enough to gain entrance into the
NCAA Tournament.
"Now it becomes a test for us,"
Lindores said. "If we can come back
from two bad losses, then this team
has the character it needs to do well
in the tournament. But if we lose
again next week, our season's over.
We've definitely dug ourselves a
hole, because sweeping two games
up on Washington's Astro Turf will
be a challenge in itself."
