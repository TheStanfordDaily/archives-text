# Cross country takes two fourths in Pac-10 meet
## Watson finishes second, Stolz third on muddy golf course 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
It was fitting that Saturday's wet
and muddy cross country race was dom
inated by ducks.
Oregon swept the field at the Pacific
10 Championships on the Stanford Golf
Course, winning both the women's five
kilometer and the men's 8K race.
In a day that was "better than aver
age," according to head coach Vin
Lananna, both the Stanford men's and
women's teams placed fourth in their
respective fields of nine.
The men, ranked 26th nationally,
garnered a team score of 93 and were
nudged out of the top three by
unranked UCLA. The last time these
two teams raced was at the Stanford
Invitational, where the Cardinal lost to
the Bruins by 30 points.
In a little bit of an upset, No. 9 Ore
gon beat second-ranked Arizona by four
points, 51 to 47.
Individually, the men's race was
expected to be a duel between co
favorites Martin Keino of Arizona and
Joe Kapkory of Washington State.
For the first mile the two K's led the
way by a good 50 yards, but by the two
mile mark Kapkory made a move that
sent him past Keino and into first by 30
yards. He never relinquished that lead
and won the race by a good 100 yards in
a time of 23 minutes, 46 seconds.
As Kapkory broke away, Stanford's
Gary Stolz came up to challenge Keino.
Although Stolz had lost to Keino by big

margins at both the Stanford Invita
tional and the Arizona State Invitation
al, he closed the gap as the race pro
gressed.
At the one-mile mark, Stolz was 15th
in a huge pack. But he pressed forward,
moving to eighth at the two-mile mark,
fifth at the three-mile mark, and up to
third at the four-mile mark. Unfortu
nately, Stolz was still 100 yards behind
Keino.
In a thrilling finish, Stolz began a
kick at about 400 yards out that sent
him within diving distance of Keino.
But he was never able to catch the Wild
cat and finished third by only a few
tenths of a second at 23:58.
Afterwards, Stolz said he ran a good
tactical race until the end. "I made my
move too late," he said. "I would have
caught him if I had started my kick
sooner."
Other top Cardinal finishers were
junior Todd Lewis at 14th and seniors
Mike Reilly, Derek Bork and Greg Shry
ock at 15th, 28th, and 33rd, respective
ly*
On the women's side, the No. 8 Ore
gon Ducks won the 5K race with a team
score of 58. Next were the upset-mind
ed Huskies, tallying 73 points.
Rounding out the top four were the
Wildcats, ranked 10th, with a score of
82 and the Cardinal, ranked 16th, with
a score of 95.
As advertised, the women's race was
a dogfight between Oregon's Nicole
Woodward and Stanford's Louise Wat
son. Woodward and Watson shared the

lead after about 1.5 miles over a tightly
packed group of about 20 runners.
Watson took control at the bottom of
the hill at the two-mile mark, only to be
passed by Woodward going up the
incline. Watson made up some ground
toward the end, but was never able to
fully recover as Woodward won with a
time of 16:51.

1 would have caught him
if I had started my kick
sooner.'
— Gary Stolz

Tiring visibly at the finish, Watson
barely fought off a late challenge from
Washington freshman Tara Carlson to
finish second at 17:04.
After the race, Watson said she made a
tactical error at the hill. "I expended too
much energy at the downhill," she said,
which left her little for an ending kick.
Leading the rest of the Cardinal
women was junior team captain Sarah
Truitt at 19th, followed by freshman
Christine Dehlendorf at 21st and senior
Kim McElhinney at 22nd. The last
Stanford scorer was sophomore Kay
Lou at 33rd.
Lananna, although satisfied with the
women's performance, said that, "The
main pack lof Stanford women 1 was
about 10 seconds in back of where it
should be."
