# Water polo dominates Bruins, Broncos in triumphant return
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
For four weeks, the Stanford water
polo team has successfully defended its
No. 2 ranking. During that time, the Car
dinal has fought off formidable chal
lenges from the likes of former No. 2 Pep
perdine and third-ranked USC.
Such achievements didn't quell Stan
ford's hunger and aggression, however, as
No. 6 UCLA discovered at deGuerre Pool
last Friday, suffering an 11-3 pasting.
As in weeks past, the Cardinal viewed
their top-10 clash with the Bruins not as

a threat to its ranking, but rather as an
opportunity to assert its dominance.
"We didn't just want to win," said
Stanford head coach Dante Dettamanti.
"We wanted to beat them decisively."
Stanford nearly quadrupled the Bru
ins' offensive output.
Anticipating UCLA would deploy a
zone, the Cardinal had practiced against
such a defense all last week. Although
Stanford encountered pressure defense,
the Bruins' change in strategy effectively
tilted the balance in the Cardinal's favor.
Stanford players were able to drive past
their opponents and score.

"We're better driving against the
press," Dettamanti said.
Senior captain Chip Blankenhorn
paced Stanford's shelling of Bruin goalie
Kevin Dillenbeck with four goals. Junior
Chris Wallin and sophomore Frank
Schneider each contributed two, while
sophomore Wolf Wigo, freshman Jeremy
Laster and senior John Matarangas each
added one. Junior goalkeeper Larry
Bercutt gathered seven saves.
Dettamanti said that in the Cardinal's
first victory over UCLA earlier in the sea
son, Stanford did not know what to
expect from the young Bruins, and thus

won by a more modest score of 8-4. This
time, the coach explained, his team
understood their opponents and adjusted
accordingly, shutting them down.
Indeed, Dillenbeck, who Dettamanti
considers one of the top three goalies in
the nation, could not halt the Cardinal
scoring hailstorm, and his teammate
Chris Kellerman, who accounted for 75
percent of UCLA's scoring in his first
encounter with Stanford, could not get
into his game.
The only negative, according to Detta
manti, is that the Cardinal scored only
once in six six-on-five power plays. Other

than that, "We scored in every possible
way," he said.
This proved to be the case as well in
Stanford's second game that day against
unranked Santa Clara. In that contest,
the Cardinal starters never even got wet.
Stanford's second-and third-stringers
demolished their foes by a score of 11-2.
Sophomore Tom Mitchell and freshman
Brian Pyle led the barrage with three
goals each.
The Cardinal, now with a record of 20-
3, will face tougher competition next
weekend in home games against No. 3
USC and No. 1 California.
