# Prof. influenced health-care plans
## Presidential candidates consulted Business School's Enthoven 
### Alexa Lee Staff writer 
All three presidential candidates have
armed themselves with parts of Business
School Prof. Alain Enthoven's "managed com
petition" strategy to salvage the nation's ailing
health-care system.
Although no one has wholly adopted the 17-
year-old plan, which has called for creating a
market driven by "informed cost-conscious
choice," Enthoven said he has met with each of
the candidates to discuss his ideas.
He has briefed the Perot campaign and is in
constant contact with the Bush and Clinton
camps, Enthoven said.
"What I am interested in is promoting the
best way to reform the health-care system,"
said Enthoven, who maintains that he is
staunchly non-partisan.
Enthoven's plan grew out of the Jackson

Hole Initiatives Group, an in
formal collection of health in
dustry leaders, public offi
cials, and health officials that
has been meeting since the
mid-1970s at the home of
Stanford alumnus Dr. Paul
El wood.
At the heart of Enthoven's
health-care plan is the idea of
a system designed to surren-

der skyrocketing health care costs to the will of
the market.
This choice "would allow small employers to
share the same bargaining power that the large
corporations have, by pooling the smaller busi
nesses together," Enthoven said.
While government regulation would allow
doctors and hospitals to set fees, managed com
petition shifts this task to a handful of large
health insurance companies which engage in

competition and act like private regulators of
health-care spending.
Although the candidates have borrowed some
of his ideas, Enthoven said their health-care plat
forms "have been less than convincing."
"So far, none of the candidates have really
come out in detail about health care," he said.
"We know their intentions, but they are still
straddling many aspects, like how to pay for it.
"Bush came out with a plan in February
tnat stayed with the Jackson Hole Initiatives
but did not include some of the very important
features about our ideas on how to raise money
for the care of the poor. Bush's plan also had no
financing component to it."
In the second-to-last debate, Clinton an
nounced a change in his platform from the De
mocratic "Play or Pay" initiative to "managed
competition," clearly alluding to the Jackson


Enthoven
