How many College Bowl players does it
take to screw in a lightbulb?
"Three," says senior Garret Vargas of
team United We Stand. One to moderate,
one to screw in the lightbulb, and one to ref
eree so the wily players "don't cheat."
"n," said junior John Christian of The
Raving Band of Hasidic Jews. No explana
tion needed.
Welcome to the annual College Bowl, the
Varsity Sport of the Mind.
Student teams with illustrious names
like Consenting Adults, We Know Nothing,
and Gray Matter slugged it out at the annu
al trivia contest in Tresidder this past
week.
"We really worked well together. All our
bases ranging from questions on literature
to science were covered," said senior David
Frazee, the president of the College Bowl,
whose team The Council on Competitiveness
emerged victorious after defeating the Rav
ing Band of Hasidic Jews on Saturday.
"We played close for awhile, but then they
got away," said Steve Lin of The Raving
Band who was vanquished by Council, the
"dream team."
But not all the teams were so lucky. A
member of Cold Winds, after being blown
away by the Council on Competitiveness by
485 points, said, "we feel humiliated and
scarred for life, but overall it was a reward-

ing experience."
College Bowl is the game for aficionados
of Jeopardy or those who know random triv
ia for which a professor would never give
credit. Watching TV can become preparation
for such questions like: "Though Candace
Bergen was not pregnant on the show Mur
phy Brown, this actress on Designing
Women was and spent most of the season
hiding behind furniture as Mary Jo." The
answer: Annie Potts.
Like Jeopardy, speed is crucial in order
gain control of play. Each player clasps a
wired control with a little button on top to
buzz in when they know the answer to the
first question, known as the "tossup."
"It's an exhilarating feeling," said Vargas.
If a player answers the tossup correctly,
then the team plays for the bonus points and
can confer, scribble notes to each other, and
gesture wildly until they are called for an
answer.
If however, a player buzzes in while the
moderator is still reading the question and
answers the question incorrectly, the team is
penalized.
"What kind of person would spend their
afternoons going to a stupid Bowl gripping
onto a goddamn tiny buzzer trying to push it
before anyone else does?" said a bitter senior
Eugene Chen, whose team did not make it to
semi-finals.
"I think we're all nerds. You almost have
to be in any trivia type event," admitted Var

gas.
"It's kind of an acquired taste, sort of like
scotch, jazz or the Houston Astros," said
sophomore Kyle Graham, who was on Col
lege Jeopardy over the summer.
Most players have had experience playing
College Bowl or Science Bowl in the past.
However, the goal is to have a good time
showing off with the answer to "Name the
year in which the British House of Com
mons abolished the House of Lords, abol
ished the monarchy and had King Charles I
beheaded." The answer: 1649.
College Bowl may even justify owning a
Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Calendar
because it can help answer questions such
as, "Name the model that is the wife of the
famous singer Billy Joel." The answer:
Christie Brinkley.
And what was the lamest team name?
"Team Soto," says Lin of the Raving
Band of Hasidic Jews without hesitation.
"Probably the Raving Band of Hasidic
Jews," says Doug Bone of Perot, adding
upon reflection, "but then again, it might be
ours."
"Definitely 'Perot'," agreed Christian.
So, what was the reason that most players
gave for playing?
"We were in it for the cash prizes and
glory," admitted Christian.
Fame and fortune aside, if you happen to
finish in the top four, you get a really neat
mug.
