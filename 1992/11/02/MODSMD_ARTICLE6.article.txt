A leaky water heater created a waterfall in the
Stanford Quad's offices Saturday afternoon, damag
ing as much as $10,000 worth of yearbooks and send
ing staff members scrambling to salvage the publica
tion's archives.
The heater, located on the second floor of the
Storke Publications Building, "busted loose" and
sent more than 100 gallons of water pouring down
through the ceiling in the Quad's office, said Palo

Alto Fire Capt. Dale Hopkins.
"A lot of our books are trashed," said senior Shan
non Resnick, the Quad's editor. "We're going to be
making one giant trip to the dumpster."
She estimates that more than 25 boxes, each con
taining several yearbooks, were damaged. More
boxes and a handful of computers would also have
been damaged had it not been for the quick reaction
of Stanford Directory staff members, Resnick said.
Andrea Koerselman, the Directory's graphic de-
designer, was working in a office
adjacent to the Quad's when she
heard what sounded like rain.
"It sounded like my thunder
storm CD. When I opened the
door, though, I saw gallons of
water pouring out of the ceiling,"
she said.
Koerselman and Chris Eisen
berg, the Directory's project
director, moved the computers
out of the room and attempted to
stem the flood of water on the
floor with old copies of the Direc
tory.
"I called the facilities people

right away, but apparently they
didn't realize the severity of the
situation," Eisenberg said. "They
said they would try to call a
plumber."
Seeing the downpour grow
larger, Eisenberg said he called
911 and within minutes, six fire
fighters arrived with mops, a
water vacuum and a tarpaulin in
hand to control the leak.
An hour and a half later, as the
firefighters were nearly finished
with mopping up the leak, a
maintenance official finally
arrived.
After looking around, he
approached Eisenberg and asked,
"I'm from the water department.
What seems to be the problem
here?"
