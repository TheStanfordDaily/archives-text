# Reach Out: that spells ReLeaf
## 
### Caroline Smrstik 
Every Saturday at 9 a.m.,
Peninsula ReLeaf volunteers hike
through the Stanford Foothills,
attending to fledgling oak trees.
This week, ReLeaf regulars
were joined by a dozen Stanford
students participating in the
ninth annual "Reach Out Today"
one-day community service event.
Nearly 60 volunteers spent the
morning under the tutelage of
Dave Muffly, a member of Magic,

Inc., the nonprofit corporation
whose activities include Peninsula
ReLeaf.
The organization has been
under contract with Stanford for
the last eight years to plant and
tend oaks in the Foothills. The
Foothills were once covered with
oaks, but 150 years of cattle graz
ing decimated the oak population.
Grazing was stopped in 1985, and
reforestation was begun.
Experienced volunteers were
sent to evaluate the sites where

young oak plantings were injured
in last July's fire. At least 60 of last
year's plantings appear to have
sustained damage, but may re
sprout if given proper attention,
volunteers said.
"We don't know all the an
swers. We're out here learning.
This is the cutting edge of refor
estation," Muffly said.
New volunteers, including
Branner Hall residents, were
given a lesson in the whys and hows
of acorn planting. More than 50
acorns were planted and enclosed
in rodent-proof wire mesh cages.
"We attempt to do projects
which fit with our values," MufDy
said. He said he is hoping that
some of the Stanford students in
this week's planting brigade will
return to water and take care of
the nearly 1,000 oaks growing in
the foothills.
Other Reach Out Today partic
ipants volunteered with commu
nity organizations ranging from
homeless shelters and schools to
soup kitchens and battered
women's shelters.
"Things seemed to go really
well," said junior Roopal Mehta,
co-chair of Reach Out Today. "We
had a whole variety of people. We
were very lucky in that we cov
ered a whole variety of issues."
Junior Gloria Sanchez and
four Potter residents spent their
Saturday distributing 500 dona
tion bags throughout Palo Alto on
behalf of the American Cancer
Society Discovery Shop. Next

week, Potter volunteers will go to
the Mid-Peninsula YWCA child
care center to repair a jungle gym
and spruce up the landscaping.
"I really get excited about this.
It's our chance to reach out,"
Sanchez said. "If you take some
time out of your busy lives, you
might get a reward."

Two projects ran into prob
lems. One group was unable to
attend a project at an Alameda
food bank due to the closure of
San Mateo Bridge, Mehta said.
A project in which students
would join a park ranger and clean
up Palo Alto marshlands was can
celed because of rain, she said.
"Unfortunately, we had three
freshman dorms assigned to that
project," Mehta said. "We're going
to see if they can reschedule."
