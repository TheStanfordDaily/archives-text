# No U.S. visit for Mandela
## 'Critical situation' cited, campus speech cancelled 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Citing a "very critical situation of violence" in
South Africa, anti-apartheid leader Nelson Man
dela — who was scheduled to give a speech at
Maples Pavilion on Nov. 9 — has cancelled his visit
to the United States.
Mandela, president of the African National Con
gress, was invited to campus to receive the Jackson
H. Ralston Prize of International Law, which rec
ognizes original and distinguished contributions to
the development of the role of law and the estab
lishment of peace and justice.
In a letter faxed to Law Prof. William Gould, who
helped arrange the planned visit, Mandela said:

"I regret to inform you, at such
late notice, that due to the very criti
cal situation of violence which has
escalated to a dangerous level, I am
forced to curtail my forthcoming
visit to the United States of America.
"Please do accept my deep
apologies but I hope that you will
understand the very grave circum
stances and continue to lend sup
port to the people of South Africa

in their bid for peace, justice and democracy."
The Stanford Law School, which was sponsoring
the campus appearance, will hold the award pre
sentation at a future date. In a letter to Mandela,
Law School officials said, "We deeply regret but
fully understand [the situation|. . . We have can
celled all events for the day and hope to reschedule
them at a more peaceful time."
Mandela, who earned a law degree at the Uni
versity of Witwatersrand, helped form the Youth
League of the outlawed African National Congress
in 1944 and went on to form the nation's first black
law partnership with Oliver Tambo in 1952.
He spent five years on trial for treason between
1956 and 1961, was found innocent and re-arrested
in 1962. Mandela was imprisoned for life in 1963,
but was released in 1990 under the F.W. de Klerk
government.
His staunch unwillingness to compromise his vi
sion of a South African state governed by majority
rule made Mandela the symbolic leader of the strug
gle for justice, and he was appointed deputy presi
dent of the legalized ANC in 1990, and president in
1991.
Margery Savoye, the Law School organizer for
the Mandela visit, said they will try to find a mutu
ally convenient time to reschedule events, possibly
during the spring or summer of next year.
"We have left the door wide open for him to come
in the future," she said.
