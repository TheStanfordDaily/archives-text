Janice LaFetra
La Fetra, who is running for the seat for the
first time, describes herself as a moderate
Republican with a pro-business stance.
She is firmly against raising taxes to balance the
state budget, saying that there are many excessive
government programs — such as Sher's stringent
recycling policy and certain welfare benefits — that
could be cut or reduced to save money.
La Fetra's message is to simplify and to economize.
Recalling her one-year term as mayor of Menlo Park
she says there is "excessive red tape" in government
— especially in the form of regulations that slow busi
ness growth — that need to be eliminated because
they are driving businesses and jobs out of the state.
She argues that the 66,000 laws that regulate
public schools are excessive, saying that many of
the rules should be eliminated and control returned
to parents. La Fetra also says she favors "coopera
tive, not confrontational" ways of dealing with
environmental concerns.
Byron Sher
Sher, the Democrat incumbent, is known mostly
for the environmental legislation he's authored
during his 12 years as the district assemblyman.
Some of the most notable legislation he has
passed through the state legislature includes the
1983 Groundwater Protection Act and the 1988
California Clean Air Act. Sher is endorsed by the
California League of Conservation Voters and the
Sierra Club of California.
Though he did vote for the 1991 tax hike pro
posed by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, he says he
does not favor general tax increases.
He says that businesses can be helped by
reforming the expensive workers' compensation
system and cutting down on regulations — all
without sacrificing the environment.
Sher says cuts in higher education are necessary
but he will do what he can to make sure qualified stu
dents can afford to go to college. He is a big supporter
of public education and opposes vouchers.
11th State Senate District seat
Becky Morgan
Republican incumbent Morgan, a Los Altos
Hills resident, says she wants to improve the
state's educational system and create a posi
tive business climate. She argues that excessive
taxes and over-regulation are causing businesses in
falter in California. Morgan favors a reform of the
workers' compensation system and changes in the
building permit process.
As a legislator, Morgan says she has consistently
worked to improve the state's educational system.
She has authored legislation to increase the use of
computers in schools and reduce the size of high
school English classes. She favors increased train
ing for teachers. Morgan also says student financial
aid has been one of her top priorities.
She supports environmental programs that can
be achieved while boosting the economy. During
the last term, she voted in favor of the Clean Air
Act, a bill to prevent oil spills and another to ban
drilling off the California coast.
She favors private health insurance with the cre
ation of an insurance pool which the poor can use
to purchase insurance.
Frank Trinkle
Trinkle, a Democrat from Mountain View, is a
retired businessman who pledges not to run
for a second term if elected. He says that small
business concerns should be a top priority for legisla
tors and favors incentives for long-term research
and development. He supports Gov. Bill Clinton's
programs to improve the infrastructure and convert
defense-related technology to consumer products.
He says education must be given the highest
budget priority and that local districts should
experiment with innovative programs to improve
educational standards. A former Army lieutenant,
he also advocates a financial aid program in the
form of grants repayable with military service.
He says the maintenance of the environment
must be a high priority. He proposes increased
mass transit programs and a greater gas tax as well
as stricter enforcement of current regulations to
reduce pollution.
Trinkle favors a universal health care system.
He says such a system should emphasize preventa
tive care, pre-natal care and inoculations to reduce
care costs.
Selected propositions
Proposition 161 would allow
doctors to help end the lives of
terminally ill patients who
request aid in dying. The "death
with dignity" measure would
apply only to mentally competent
adults who sign a directive
authorizing authorizing such
help. The measure would require
two doctors to certify that the
patient has an incurable condi
tion that will probably lead to
death within six months.
Proponents say the terminally
ill should have the right to end
their life through humane death.
It would allow patients to forego
the indignity of living connected
to a machine. Opponents say the
proposition lacks needed safe
guards. They also argue that
medical science cannot yet do a
reliable job of predicting whether
or not a patient is terminal, or
that they will die within six
months.
Proposition 164 would limit the
number of terms one may serve in
the United States Senate or House
of Representatives. The measure
would deny ballot access to those
who had served six of the past 11
years in the House and to those
who had served in the Senate for
at least 12 of the previous 17 years.
Proponents say the measure
would help break-up the power of
incumbents and career politicians,
returning control to non-politi
cians. The measure would allow
newcomers a better chance of get
ting elected and would help dis
mantle the seniority system.
Opponents say if the measure
passes, California will lose its clout
in Washington because the state
would have fewer representatives
in high-ranking legislative posi
tions. They also argue that the
measure would put more power in
the hands of non-elected congres
sional support staff members.
Proposition 165 would give
California's governor the power
to cut state spending without leg
islative consent if a budget is not
passed by July 1 or if revenues
fall 3 percent below projections
at any time during the year. The
measure would also cut welfare
benefits by 10 percent and an
additional 15 percent once a fam
ily has been on aid for six
months.
Proponents say the measure
is needed to help solve the
state's mounting fiscal problems
and reform the welfare system.
Opponents of the measure say it
would give Governor Pete Wil
son dictatorial budget powers
and drive more people into
poverty — because it lacks pro
visions for child care and job
training, and because welfare
recipients will have extra trou
ble finding jobs during a reces
sion.

Frank Trinkle
Trinkle, a Democrat from Mountain View, is a
retired businessman who pledges not to run
for a second term if elected. He says that small
business concerns should be a top priority for legisla

programs to improve the infrastructure and convert
defense-related technology to consumer products.
He says education must be given the highest
budget priority and that local districts should
experiment with innovative programs to improve
educational standards. A former Army lieutenant,
he also advocates a financial aid program in the
form of grants repayable with military service.
He says the maintenance of the environment
must be a high priority. He proposes increased
mass transit programs and a greater gas tax as well
as stricter enforcement of current regulations to
reduce pollution.
Trinkle favors a universal health care system.
He says such a system should emphasize preventa
tive care, pre-natal care and inoculations to reduce
care costs.
Selected propositions
Proposition 161 would allow
doctors to help end the lives of
terminally ill patients who
request aid in dying. The "death
with dignity" measure would
apply only to mentally competent
adults who sign a directive
authorizing authorizing such
help. The measure would require
two doctors to certify that the
patient has an incurable condi
tion that will probably lead to
death within six months.
Proponents say the terminally
ill should have the right to end
their life through humane death.
It would allow patients to forego
the indignity of living connected
to a machine. Opponents say the
proposition lacks needed safe
guards. They also argue that
medical science cannot yet do a
reliable job of predicting whether
or not a patient is terminal, or
that they will die within six
months.
Proposition 164 would limit the
number of terms one may serve in
the United States Senate or House
of Representatives. The measure
would deny ballot access to those
who had served six of the past 11
years in the House and to those
who had served in the Senate for
at least 12 of the previous 17 years.
Proponents say the measure
would help break-up the power of
incumbents and career politicians,
returning control to non-politi
cians. The measure would allow
newcomers a better chance of get
ting elected and would help dis
mantle the seniority system.
Opponents say if the measure
passes, California will lose its clout
in Washington because the state
would have fewer representatives
in high-ranking legislative posi
tions. They also argue that the
measure would put more power in
the hands of non-elected congres
sional support staff members.
Proposition 165 would give
California's governor the power
to cut state spending without leg
islative consent if a budget is not
passed by July 1 or if revenues
fall 3 percent below projections
at any time during the year. The
measure would also cut welfare
benefits by 10 percent and an
additional 15 percent once a fam
ily has been on aid for six
months.
Proponents say the measure
is needed to help solve the
state's mounting fiscal problems
and reform the welfare system.
Opponents of the measure say it
would give Governor Pete Wil
son dictatorial budget powers
and drive more people into
poverty — because it lacks pro
visions for child care and job
training, and because welfare
recipients will have extra trou
ble finding jobs during a reces
sion.

Janice LaFetra
La Fetra, who is running for the seat for the
first time, describes herself as a moderate
Republican with a pro-business stance.
She is firmly against raising taxes to balance the
state budget, saying that there are many excessive
government programs — such as Sher's stringent
recycling policy and certain welfare benefits — that
could be cut or reduced to save money.
La Fetra's message is to simplify and to economize.
Recalling her one-year term as mayor of Menlo Park
she says there is "excessive red tape" in government
— especially in the form of regulations that slow busi
ness growth — that need to be eliminated because
they are driving businesses and jobs out of the state.
She argues that the 66,000 laws that regulate
public schools are excessive, saying that many of
the rules should be eliminated and control returned
to parents. La Fetra also says she favors "coopera
tive, not confrontational" ways of dealing with
environmental concerns.
Byron Sher
Sher, the Democrat incumbent, is known mostly
for the environmental legislation he's authored
during his 12 years as the district assemblyman.
Some of the most notable legislation he has
passed through the state legislature includes the
1983 Groundwater Protection Act and the 1988
California Clean Air Act. Sher is endorsed by the
California League of Conservation Voters and the
Sierra Club of California.
Though he did vote for the 1991 tax hike pro
posed by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, he says he
does not favor general tax increases.
He says that businesses can be helped by
reforming the expensive workers' compensation
system and cutting down on regulations — all
without sacrificing the environment.
Sher says cuts in higher education are necessary
but he will do what he can to make sure qualified stu
dents can afford to go to college. He is a big supporter
of public education and opposes vouchers.

Becky Morgan
Republican incumbent Morgan, a Los Altos

taxes and over-regulation are causing businesses in
falter in California. Morgan favors a reform of the
workers' compensation system and changes in the
building permit process.
As a legislator, Morgan says she has consistently
worked to improve the state's educational system.
She has authored legislation to increase the use of
computers in schools and reduce the size of high
school English classes. She favors increased train
ing for teachers. Morgan also says student financial
aid has been one of her top priorities.
She supports environmental programs that can
be achieved while boosting the economy. During

Janice LaFetra
La Fetra, who is running for the seat for the
first time, describes herself as a moderate
Republican with a pro-business stance.
She is firmly against raising taxes to balance the
state budget, saying that there are many excessive
government programs — such as Sher's stringent
recycling policy and certain welfare benefits — that
could be cut or reduced to save money.
La Fetra's message is to simplify and to economize.
Recalling her one-year term as mayor of Menlo Park
she says there is "excessive red tape" in government
— especially in the form of regulations that slow busi
ness growth — that need to be eliminated because
they are driving businesses and jobs out of the state.
She argues that the 66,000 laws that regulate
public schools are excessive, saying that many of
the rules should be eliminated and control returned
to parents. La Fetra also says she favors "coopera
tive, not confrontational" ways of dealing with
environmental concerns.
Byron Sher
Sher, the Democrat incumbent, is known mostly
for the environmental legislation he's authored
during his 12 years as the district assemblyman.
Some of the most notable legislation he has
passed through the state legislature includes the
1983 Groundwater Protection Act and the 1988
California Clean Air Act. Sher is endorsed by the
California League of Conservation Voters and the
Sierra Club of California.
Though he did vote for the 1991 tax hike pro
posed by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, he says he
does not favor general tax increases.
He says that businesses can be helped by
reforming the expensive workers' compensation
system and cutting down on regulations — all
without sacrificing the environment.
Sher says cuts in higher education are necessary
but he will do what he can to make sure qualified stu
dents can afford to go to college. He is a big supporter
of public education and opposes vouchers.
11th State Senate District seat
Becky Morgan
Republican incumbent Morgan, a Los Altos
Hills resident, says she wants to improve the
state's educational system and create a posi
tive business climate. She argues that excessive
taxes and over-regulation are causing businesses in
falter in California. Morgan favors a reform of the
workers' compensation system and changes in the
building permit process.
As a legislator, Morgan says she has consistently
worked to improve the state's educational system.
She has authored legislation to increase the use of
computers in schools and reduce the size of high
school English classes. She favors increased train
ing for teachers. Morgan also says student financial
aid has been one of her top priorities.
She supports environmental programs that can
be achieved while boosting the economy. During
the last term, she voted in favor of the Clean Air
Act, a bill to prevent oil spills and another to ban
drilling off the California coast.
She favors private health insurance with the cre
ation of an insurance pool which the poor can use
to purchase insurance.
Frank Trinkle
Trinkle, a Democrat from Mountain View, is a
retired businessman who pledges not to run
for a second term if elected. He says that small
business concerns should be a top priority for legisla
tors and favors incentives for long-term research
and development. He supports Gov. Bill Clinton's
programs to improve the infrastructure and convert
defense-related technology to consumer products.
He says education must be given the highest
budget priority and that local districts should
experiment with innovative programs to improve
educational standards. A former Army lieutenant,
he also advocates a financial aid program in the
form of grants repayable with military service.
He says the maintenance of the environment
must be a high priority. He proposes increased
mass transit programs and a greater gas tax as well
as stricter enforcement of current regulations to
reduce pollution.
Trinkle favors a universal health care system.
He says such a system should emphasize preventa
tive care, pre-natal care and inoculations to reduce
care costs.
Selected propositions
Proposition 161 would allow
doctors to help end the lives of
terminally ill patients who
request aid in dying. The "death
with dignity" measure would
apply only to mentally competent
adults who sign a directive
authorizing authorizing such
help. The measure would require
two doctors to certify that the
patient has an incurable condi
tion that will probably lead to
death within six months.
Proponents say the terminally
ill should have the right to end
their life through humane death.
It would allow patients to forego
the indignity of living connected
to a machine. Opponents say the
proposition lacks needed safe
guards. They also argue that
medical science cannot yet do a
reliable job of predicting whether
or not a patient is terminal, or
that they will die within six
months.
Proposition 164 would limit the
number of terms one may serve in
the United States Senate or House
of Representatives. The measure
would deny ballot access to those
who had served six of the past 11
years in the House and to those
who had served in the Senate for
at least 12 of the previous 17 years.
Proponents say the measure
would help break-up the power of
incumbents and career politicians,
returning control to non-politi
cians. The measure would allow
newcomers a better chance of get
ting elected and would help dis
mantle the seniority system.
Opponents say if the measure
passes, California will lose its clout
in Washington because the state
would have fewer representatives
in high-ranking legislative posi
tions. They also argue that the
measure would put more power in
the hands of non-elected congres
sional support staff members.
Proposition 165 would give
California's governor the power
to cut state spending without leg
islative consent if a budget is not
passed by July 1 or if revenues
fall 3 percent below projections
at any time during the year. The
measure would also cut welfare
benefits by 10 percent and an
additional 15 percent once a fam
ily has been on aid for six
months.
Proponents say the measure
is needed to help solve the
state's mounting fiscal problems
and reform the welfare system.
Opponents of the measure say it
would give Governor Pete Wil
son dictatorial budget powers
and drive more people into
poverty — because it lacks pro
visions for child care and job
training, and because welfare
recipients will have extra trou
ble finding jobs during a reces
sion.
