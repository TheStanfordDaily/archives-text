# Noise Pollution course utilizes love poems, sirens as audio aids

Professors reading love poems over the wail of a
siren... field trips to sound-proof rooms. . .
Sound like a surreal drama seminar?
Actually, it's Noise Pollution, an undergraduate
class being offered this quarter through the Depart
ment of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
"(The class) has a double purpose: as an introduc
tion to education of noise control engineers and also
as an important component of environmental aware
ness for everyone," said Aeronautics/Astronautics
Prof. Daniel Bershader, who teaches the course along
with Profs. Vincent Salmon and Sam Haddad.
"There is an underlying demand for the course,"
said Bershader. "Several students a year express
interest in noise control, and the aspect of noise pol
lution has fallen between the cracks of many depart
ments."
According to Bershader, this kind of class is proba
bly given in only six or seven universities around the
country.
Noise Pollution delves into problems of noise and
acoustics, touching on everything from noise in cars
to the ear and how it is affected by loud music.
Legal aspects of noise, including lawsuits against
Shoreline Amphitheater and airports with loud
airstrips, have also been emphasized.
The class includes demonstrations, field trips and
student projects. One previous student designed a
muffler for Palo Alto's leaf-blower machines as his
term project.
"It's pretty interesting and laid-back compared to
most other engineering classes," said graduate stu
dent Jonathan Chow.
Graduate engineering student Frank Zsirai said,
"This class is good for engineers to learn that noise is
an important part of design and an important part of
making a quality product."
In one demonstration, Bershader read a love poem
while gradually increasing the volume of a siren.
When students could understand less than half of the
poem, they raised their hands, and a noise meter mea-

sured to what degree spoken language can be heard in
a noisy environment.
Once this is known, how much louder someone has
to talk to be heard can be determined, explained Ber
shader.
For example, a restaurant owner, before his grand
opening, could measure the noise level in the crowded
restaurant to see if it is too high. If it is, he could
install absorbers in the walls so that his patrons could
hear each other comfortably, Bershader said.
In addition to participating in demonstrations, noise
pollution students visit the IBM Center in San Jose
where they can experience total quiet in the anechoic
chamber, a room in which the walls absorb all sound.
The room is so quiet that it's almost possible to
hear your heart beating and blood pumping, said Ber
shader.

Building houses which won't be plagued with
excess noise is another problem the class addresses.
For example, students learn how to prevent pipe noise
caused by water running and about the unexpectedly
large amount of noise that can be let in by a small,
badly installed electric outlet.
"The construction industry may tiy to build the
most cost-effective house rather than the quietest
house," said Bershader.
"If the buyer is aware of how well it can be built,
they can control the amount of noise they will have in
their home," he explained.
Although the class is very small — less than 10 stu
dents — and is comprised mainly of graduate stu
dents, it is an undergraduate course and is open to
anyone who has taken freshman-level calculus and
physics.
