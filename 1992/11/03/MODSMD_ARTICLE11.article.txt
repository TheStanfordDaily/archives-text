# Row house carpets mark fire escape zone
## 
### Sarah Nagae 
Instead of bolted-down furni
ture, residents of Row house
rooms with access to fire
escapes arrived this year to fmd
dark strips of carpeting running
through their rooms.
The strips mark areas that
must be kept clear at all times,
according to Marty Keller,
manager of Housing Facilities
Projects.
Over the summer, he said,
Student Housing Operations
did away with the bolts, which
used to ensure that residents
would not move furniture and
block the escapes.

There would be no
room for my bed if I
abide by the rules. I
would have to
sleep vertically,'
— Vinay Bhagat

"Students have been cooper
ative about the change because
they recognize that in an emer
gency, their fellow housemates
need a way out," Keller added.
But the two-tone pathway
through Vinay Bhagat's room
in Columbae poses a problem.
"There would be no room for
my bed if I abide by the rules. I

would have to sleep vertically,"
he said.
Grove-Lausen resident Matt
Beltramo said he never con
cerned himself with the dark
strip running to his window
other than finding it "conve
nient because I can just leave my
room through the fire escape."
In the case of an emergency,
Keller said the windows in these
designated fire exit rooms func
tion as secondary escape routes
when staircases cannot be used.
This new system better
complies with stricter fire safe
ty codes requiring that path
ways through these rooms stay
absolutely clear of obstruc
tions, he said.
In past years, occupants of
fire escape rooms in most Row
houses as well as in Toyon and
Branner had to submit a plan
satisfying fire safety regulations
if they wanted to rearrange
their furniture.
The new system eliminates
such hassles with a clear-cut indi
cation of where furniture can and
cannot be placed, Keller said.
According to the Tips for
Residents brochure, which stu
dents receive when they move
in, these rooms are "frequently
and randomly inspected by the
fire marshal." Violations can
result in harsh fmes.
Students must pay a $200
administrative fee for a first
offense, while repeated offenses
can be grounds for withdrawal
of housing privileges.
