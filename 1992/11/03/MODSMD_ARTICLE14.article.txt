GM shakes up management
NEW YORK (AP) — General Motors Corp. exe
cuted the largest management shakeup in its his
tory yesterday, naming an outsider as chairman
and betting on the man who resurrected the trou
bled company's European operations.
Moving to decisively reverse a staggering financial
and competitive slide, the GM board of directors also
cut the dividend on common stock to 80 cents a year
from $1.60, a move expected to save $500 million a
year. It was the second cut since February 1991.
In a satellite broadcast to GM's 390,000 North
American employees, Jack Smith said Saturn
Corp. will remain an independent car company but
its engineering, manufacturing and marketing
functions will report to GM's North American
Operations.
Although a huge success in marketing and in
customer satisfaction, Saturn has been losing
about $1 billion a year, partly because the profit
margins are so thin on its small cars.
Smith told employees there are no plans to
dump any of GM's marketing divisions — Chevro
let, Cadillac, Pontiac, Oldsmobile and Cadillac — or
any distribution systems.
Bush signs drift net bill
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush signed a
bill yesterday to impose trade penalties on any
nation that fishes with drift nets in the North Pacif
ic Ocean next year and in the North Atlantic in 1994.
The new law puts teeth into a U.N. resolution
adopted in 1991. The United Nations banned the 30-
mile-long nets that critics call "curtains of death."
Used primarily to catch squid in the North
Pacific, the nets vacuum the ocean, indiscriminate
ly killing all marine life in their path, critics say.
The National Marine Fisheries Service reported
that in 1990, just 10 percent of Japan's drift-net

fleet killed 1,758 whales and dolphins, 253,288
tuna, 81,956 blue sharks, 30,464 sea birds and
more than 3 million other non-target fish.
Gerry an oceans expert for the activist
environmental group Greenpeace, said Monday the
U.S. law was needed because the U.N. ban "carries
no enforcement power whatsoever."
Under the law, fishing vessels of nations which
continue to use drifl nets afler the international
moratorium begins would be denied access to U.S.
ports. Tariffs or outright import bans could be
imposed on imports of fish, fish products and sport
fishing equipment from those countries.
If a country continued to use drifl nets for anoth
er six months, the president would be authorized to
impose tariffs or import bans on any product from
that country.
The United States imported between $124 mil
lion and $168 million worth of fishery products
from Asian countries in 1990.
FDA checks altered Dow records
DETROIT (AP) — Some records on the manu
facture of silicone-gel breast implants at Dow
Corning Corp. in the 1980s were altered by employ
ees, a review of the pharmaceutical giant's opera
tions revealed yesterday.
Dow Corning officials found no evidence of any
health risks because of the changes, which involved
substituting original charts recording oven tem
peratures with replacement charts.
But former U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell
— hired by Dow Corning in January to examine its
silicone-gel operations — recommended the com
pany inform the Food and Drug Administration
about the violation of company policy.
An FDA spokesman, Gary Fendler, refused to
comment on the report because of the agency's
ongoing investigation into the controversial
implant devices.
