Polls show Clinton still ahead
NEW YORK (AP) - Polls released by the
three major broadcast networks yesterday on
the eve of the election showed Democrat Bill
Clinton with a lead of seven to 10 points over
President Bush.
With Gallup and Harris polls included, there
were five national polls all consistently showing
Clinton leading with a percentage in the mid
40s. But Gallup and Harris disagreed in pre
election estimates on whether Clinton's lead
Wad as big as 12 points or as small as six points.
Each poll had the same order of finish: Clin
ton, Bush and independent Ross Perot. And in
each case, Clinton still would be ahead if the
margin of sampling error was subtracted from
his total and added to Bush's.
Young voters may have impact
WASHINGTON (AP) - Although young
people have shunned polling places in recent
elections, they could hold the key in a tight
contest between President Bush and Democrat
Bill Clinton, experts say.
In recent years, people aged 18 to 24 have
replaced blacks as the single biggest block of
unregistered voters. Only 17 percent of that
age group voted in the last presidential elec
tion, compared with a 50 percent turnout
among all age groups.
Most of the experts agreed that overall
turnout would be up from 1988, when 50.1 per
cent of potential voters cast ballots. There was
less certainty about what the effect would be.
