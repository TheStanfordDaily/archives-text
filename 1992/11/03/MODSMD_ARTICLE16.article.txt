MOSCOW (AP) — President
Boris Yeltsin yesterday declared a
month-long state of emergency in
the North Ossetia and Ingushetia
regions to try to halt the first seri
ous outbreak of ethnic warfare on
Russian soil.
Fighting erupted Friday between
Ingush and Ossetian forces in the
Caucasus Mountains of southern
Russia, where Ingush militants ere
seeking control over regions from
which they were expelled during
World War 11.
The 100,000 Ingush, most of
whom are Sunni Muslims, live in

part of what used to be called
Chechen-Ingushetia. Last year the
area was broken into separate
regions called Chechenia and
Ingushetia.
About 400,000 Ossetians, most
of them Orthodox Christians, live
in North and South Ossetia. Osse
tia was divided between Russia
and Georgia by dictator Joseph
Stalin.
Until now, the Russian Cauca
sus territory stretching from the
Black Sea to the Caspian Sea had
been spared the kind of ethnic
fighting that has flared across

Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia.
At this stage, the Ingush-Osse
tian dispute, which has left at least
seven dead and resulted in scores
of Russian servicemen being taken
hostage, is considered to be more
about land than religious differ
ences.
Yeltsin' state of emergency dec
laration remains in force until Dec.
2 in North Ossetia and Ingushetia.
His decree bans the activity of
political groups, allows for searches,
increases security at facilities such
as power plants, and takes control of
news and broadcast facilities.
