LUANDA, Angola (AP) — Angolan government
forces had most of Luanda back under control yester
day and appealed to citizens not to wreak revenge on
UNITA rebels after fighting reportedly left up to
1,000 dead.
As rebel resistance melted in the capital, armed
civilians were reported to be hunting down rebels.
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi's second-in-command
and nephew were reported killed and a third top
rebel wounded. Police said they captured three
UNITA generals.
If confirmed, the losses would be a major setback
to the U.S.-backed UNITA rebels, who signed a cease
fire with the pro-Soviet government in 1991 to end a
16-year civil war in which 350,000 people died.
Clashes between the governing MPLA — the Pop
ular Movement for the liberation of Angola — and

UNITA — the National Union for the Total Indepen
dence of Angola — erupted in the provinces Thursday
and spread to Luanda Saturday.
State radio said up to 1,000 people died in the fight J
ing, which threatened to renew the war until a U.N.i
sponsored truce took effect just after midnight Sunday..
Tensions had been rising since national elections
in September, which UNITA lost. Savimbi contends
the vote was rigged; the United Nations says the bal
loting was generally free and fair. ,
Rebel officials reported skirmishes in some parts of
the country Monday, but police claimed to have Luan
da back under control. Only sporadic shooting and
explosions were heard in some districts.
A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed, and police,
warned civilians to stay off the streets because of
snipers. !
