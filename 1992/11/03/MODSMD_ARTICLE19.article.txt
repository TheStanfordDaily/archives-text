# Magic retires again
## Basketball star cites other players' fear; of contracting AIDS virus as his reason; 
### 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -
Earvin "Magic" Johnson retired
from basketball again yesterday —
this time for good — not because
the AIDS virus sapped his
strength or talent, but because it
struck fear among fellow players.
"It has become obvious that the
various controversies surrounding
my return are taking away from
both basketball as a sport and the
larger issue of living with HIV for
me and the many people affected,"
Johnson said in a statement four
days before the start of the 1992-
93 National Basketball Associa
tion season.
After talking it over with his
wife, Cookie, and his family,
Johnson said, "I decided I will
retire — for good — from the (Los
Angeles) Lakers."
He didn't elaborate on the con
troversies, but his agent, Lou
Rosen, said he was referring to
public comments by other NBA
players that competing against
him put them at risk of contract
ing the HIV virus.
"His feeling was, if people were
afraid to play against him, that
could affect the outcome of the
game, and Earvin didn't want
that," Rosen said.

Dr. Michael Mellman,
personal physician and the Lakers'"
team doctor, said the 33-year-old
superstar was physically fit to play.'
Mellman repeated what other!
doctors have said: There was prac-;
tically no chance of contracting'
the virui from Johnson through!
basketball.
The AIDS virus is transmitted)
through blood, semen and some 1
other bodily fluids. !
But several NBA stars, includ-;
ing fellow Olympic team member.
Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz, said;
they were concerned about playing
with Johnson for health reasons. ]
"It is a physical game and you
do get kicked and scratched," Mal-i
one said Monday. "I do have con-;
cerns, just like anybody would,
have. It's not a thing of kicking a;
man when he's down."
Dr. David Rogers, vice chair-;
man of the National Commission'
on AIDS and an adviser to the
NBA, said players' fears of John-;
son "shows how poorly we've done
in public education efforts."
"When somebody as admired
and respected as Magic Johnson
decides he's got to leave his life's
work due to people's unwarranted
fears, that's a tragedy," he said.
