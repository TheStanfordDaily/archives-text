# Program funds for pro-life group held

In the wake of allegations that last
week's abortion debate was little more
than a sham by pro-life supporters, the
ASSU is temporarily withholding reim
bursement for the event from the spon
soring pro-life student group.
The ASSU Program Board has put a
hold on the funds of Stanford Students
for Life in response to a letter published
in The Daily from Beth Parker, the at
torney who represented the pro-choice
side in the Oct. 27 debate.
In her letter, Parker claimed that the
debate "turned out to be a set-up for re
cruiting Stanford students to join the
pro-life forces" and that she was "of
fended to be used as a pawn."
"We will meet with the Stanford Stu
dents for Life and until that time, there
is just a temporary hold on the funds,"
said ASSU Program Board Director Pa
tricia Bowlin. The money was to cover
the overhead costs associated with the
event.
"Groups must use the funds for what
they were allocated for. The money for
the program was for a balanced debate
presenting both sides, and the letter
suggests that perhaps that's not what
happened," Bowlin said.
The debate was the first function spon
sored by the Stanford Students for Life.

Sophomore Maria Alaniz, president
of the group, said the debate was hastily
organized when the pro-life speaker, at
torney Greg Cunningham, contacted
them and said he would be speaking in
the area.
Alaniz defended the debate against
Parker's charges, saying that the main
purpose was not to recruit members but
to provide a forum for intellectually
honest debate.
"We did want to get out the views of
the other side. Right now, the campus is
pretty much one-sided on this issue,"
Alaniz said.
Graduate student Vince Mooney,
who helped found Stanford Students for
Life, said membership is only about
eight people right now. "But we hope
that after the debate, more people will
join," he said.
Putting a hold on funds is uncom
mon, Bowlin said, but "it is also rare to
get such an angry letter from a speaker
in a program."
Parker said she was told that the
event was co-sponsored by both pro
choice and pro-life organizations.
"We were invited to the debate but we
were not asked to co-sponsor it or to help
select the pro-choice speaker," said se
nior Mary Yu, president of the Pro
choice Alliance.
Parker also said she was not told

about a film that Cunningham showed
at the beginning of the debate. In her
letter, she said the film was "base propa
ganda" and that it "prevented a discus
sion of legal, medical and philosophical
issues that should have been discussed."
"She was told that she could bring
anything she wanted," said Alaniz. "If
she couldn't figure out that he might
bring a film, she just wasn't prepared."
The film was one reason why
Yu refused to attend the debate. She had
viewed it when Cunningham participat
ed in a debate put on by the Law School
last year.
"It's disgusting and distorted. You
see all these mangled babies which gy
necologists and obstetricians state are
stillborn babies. There are all these hor
rible images set to music with lyrics like
a music video," Yu said.
Parker made the similar charges dur
ing the debate, but Cunningham denied
them, claiming that "most of those ba
bies came from garbage bags taken out
of dumpsters behind abortion clinics;
they don't do third-/trimester abortions
in clinics."
"The film is not an easy thing to
watch," Alaniz admitted. "But I think
people don't realize whet they're sup
porting when they say they're pro
choice. The film drives home the fact
that abortion is murder."
