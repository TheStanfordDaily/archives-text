Gov. Bill Clinton's experience,
his ability to work with Congres
sional leadership — as proven
through his experience in the mod
erate-leaning Democratic Leader
ship Council — will be an impor
tant step in making real legislation
out of his "vision thing."
Clinton is willing to take on pro
gressive issues which are currently
unpopular, when they seem to be
in line with the direction the coun
try is heading. Likewise, Clinton's
stances on women's rights, health
care, abortion, education and the
environment reflect a forward
looking vision that contrasts dra-

matically with that of the back

controlled much of the Bush cam

Bill Clinton can provide the
direction this country needs.
Unlike Bush, he's aware enough of
what this country is thinking and
feeling so he can adjust his policies
with the way we're going — not to
where we've been.

This year, the contest for Cali
fornia's six-year U.S. Senate seat is
a battle between two polar oppo
sites: Democrat Barbara Boxer and
Republican Bruce Herschensohn.
Boxer demonstrates the long
range vision this country has been
lacking for too long. She supports
reduced capital-gains tax rates for
entrepreneurial investments and
tax credits for job creation and
research and development.

U.S. Senate
71 Barbara Boxer
Boxer also has demonstrated
her commitment to preserving the
environment, authoring legisla
tion protecting the California
coast from oil drilling and support
ing energy policies.

The images of U.S. Senate can
didates Dianne Feinstein and
John Seymour seem more similar
than not. Both have positioned
themselves as moderates who are
conservative on fiscal issues, liber
al on social ones and tough on
crime.
These similarities, however, are
superficial. Dianne Feinstein, the
Democratic former mayor of San
Francisco, has a track record as a
credible leader with consistent
stances on issues.
Feinstein's positions on issues
like investment in infrastructure,

U.S. Senate
\7\ Dianne Feinstein
cuts in defense spending and nation
al health, represent a step forward
from current political stagnation.
Though she has been criticized
by liberal detractors in the same
way that Seymour is criticized by
his more conservative opponents,
she has clearly shown the ability to
get things done, proving that she is
the right choice for U.S. Senate.

While Republican Tom Huening
and his Democratic opponent,
Anna Eshoo, hold many similar
beliefs — pro-choice, cuts in
defense spending, pro-environ
ment — they strongly differ in the
agendas that they would fight for
once elected.
Huening has proven flexible
and non-ideological. His pro
posed summit is an attempt to
bring both parties closer together

towards achieving a common
goal.
Tom Huening has proven he is
one who will not shy from the task
of restoring fiscal responsibility in
this country.

In the 11th district race for
state senator, voting for incum
bent Republican Becky Morgan
seems the safest bet.
Her attention to issues and her
progressive stances on a number
of social issues earned her over 60
percent of the 1988 vote in a dis
trict with more registered
Democrats than Republicans.
She has a record of supporting

improvements in education,
authoring and strongly advocating
a number of proposed bills her
Democratic opponent, Frank Trin
kle, supports.

In his previous terms in the
state assembly, Byron Sher has
been a champion of the environ
ment, authoring a number of bills
designed to protect California's
water, air and forests.
While Jan LaFetra, the Republi
can candidate agrees with her on
many issues, she belives the state
must be tight with its budget.
LaFetra's zeal for spending
restraints may come at the

expense of the poor and the envi
ronment. LaFetra supports Propo
sition 165, a measure that would
save the state money, but place
welfare recipients in unacceptable
poverty levels.

Propositionl6l, the "Death
With Dignity Act," gives terminal

the terminally ill. Proposition 161

Proposition 161

allows a painless, dignifed death to

Proposition 165 — Gov. Pete

good.

— cash incentives for teenaged
mothers in school and pay cuts

Gov. Bill Clinton's experience,
his ability to work with Congres
sional leadership — as proven
through his experience in the mod
erate-leaning Democratic Leader

tant step in making real legislation
out of his "vision thing."
Clinton is willing to take on pro

unpopular, when they seem to be
in line with the direction the coun

stances on women's rights, health
care, abortion, education and the
environment reflect a forward

Bill Clinton can provide the
direction this country needs.
Unlike Bush, he's aware enough of
what this country is thinking and
feeling so he can adjust his policies
with the way we're going — not to
where we've been.

This year, the contest for Cali
fornia's six-year U.S. Senate seat is
a battle between two polar oppo
sites: Democrat Barbara Boxer and
Republican Bruce Herschensohn.
Boxer demonstrates the long
range vision this country has been
lacking for too long. She supports
reduced capital-gains tax rates for
entrepreneurial investments and
tax credits for job creation and
research and development.

Boxer also has demonstrated
her commitment to preserving the
environment, authoring legisla
tion protecting the California
coast from oil drilling and support
ing energy policies.

The images of U.S. Senate can
didates Dianne Feinstein and
John Seymour seem more similar
than not. Both have positioned
themselves as moderates who are
conservative on fiscal issues, liber
al on social ones and tough on
crime.
These similarities, however, are
superficial. Dianne Feinstein, the
Democratic former mayor of San
Francisco, has a track record as a
credible leader with consistent
stances on issues.
Feinstein's positions on issues
like investment in infrastructure,

U.S. Senate
\7\ Dianne Feinstein
cuts in defense spending and nation
al health, represent a step forward
from current political stagnation.
Though she has been criticized
by liberal detractors in the same
way that Seymour is criticized by
his more conservative opponents,
she has clearly shown the ability to
get things done, proving that she is
the right choice for U.S. Senate.

While Republican Tom Huening
and his Democratic opponent,
Anna Eshoo, hold many similar
beliefs — pro-choice, cuts in
defense spending, pro-environ
ment — they strongly differ in the
agendas that they would fight for
once elected.
Huening has proven flexible
and non-ideological. His pro
posed summit is an attempt to
bring both parties closer together

goal.
Tom Huening has proven he is
one who will not shy from the task
of restoring fiscal responsibility in
this country.

In the 11th district race for
state senator, voting for incum
bent Republican Becky Morgan
seems the safest bet.
Her attention to issues and her
progressive stances on a number
of social issues earned her over 60
percent of the 1988 vote in a dis
trict with more registered
Democrats than Republicans.
She has a record of supporting

improvements in education,
authoring and strongly advocating
a number of proposed bills her
Democratic opponent, Frank Trin
kle, supports.

In his previous terms in the
state assembly, Byron Sher has
been a champion of the environ
ment, authoring a number of bills
designed to protect California's
water, air and forests.
While Jan LaFetra, the Republi
can candidate agrees with her on
many issues, she belives the state
must be tight with its budget.
LaFetra's zeal for spending
restraints may come at the
