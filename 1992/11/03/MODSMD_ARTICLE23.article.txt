## Grief's rejuvenating power 
### 
Thursday is the first
anniversary of my father's death.
Before last November I had never
been to a funeral. I had never touched a
dead person. My experiences with death
came from Russian novels and TV mur
der mystery shows. But for it actually to
happen to my family, and happen so sud
denly. ... I had no idea I would grow up
in a week.
It seems our society deals with death
by offering consolation and help and
greeting card visions of serenity. The
support my family received was impor
tant. But I still felt repulsed by people's
attempts to sympathize with my person
al, incomprehensible pain.
After a point I didn't want the sugar
coated hugs and flowers and chicken-rice
casseroles.
I wanted to be left as alone as I felt, to
wallow in the vastness of unfairness in
the world.
The funeral remains a surreal experi
ence. I got off the airplane completely
engulfed in grief. But at the same time I
felt an anthropological detachment from
the situation. There I was, randomly
making decisions about types of coffins,
life insurance benefits and what
metaphor I could possibly use to trans
late love and memories into a readable
eulogy.
How can I explain the feelings I expe
rienced while watching an attendant re

apply foundation makeup to the face
that I knew, underneath, was blue and
ugly and freezing cold? I felt only vio
lent, sickening anger toward the light
blue walls and soft music of the mortu
ary, the strategically placed Kleenex
boxes and the undertaker's diamond
pinky ring.
Since then, the continuation of the
everyday facets of life have numbed the
intensity of crisis. I now know where the
ladies' restroom is at the cemetery. I have
watched grief crumple my strong-willed
mother into someone small and frail and
bitter. And I now realize that mine was
one of those single parent families Dan
Quayle has warned us about.
I received a check from the Financial
Aid Office last spring, and then was asked
several weeks later to return it. Because I
had less members in my family I qualified
for a smaller Pell Grant.
Answering a simple question can
become an awkward emotional testimo
ny. I struggle over verb tense when I
must make references to both of my par
ents — if someone asks where they are
from, do I say that they "are," or "were,"
from Northern Ireland?
Last winter I sat invisibly in the Coffee
House listening to people make small talk
and big plans. I was amazed that my
experience had recently been so similar;
now they seemed confident of fascinating
futures, while I couldn't choose between

mocha and vanilla nut.
From these jabs of reality I have
learned to make a crucial distinction.
Happiness is ephemeral and unguaran
teed. More important is peace — the feel
ing of fulfillment in fully understanding
that disgust, pain and solemnity shape
one's life as much as joy and anticipation.
The feeling that aloneness also means
completeness.
Accepting life as unpredictable has
finally given me the ability to function
again in a seemingly callous world. I have
eliminated the fear of emotional pain
because I know how much grief it is pos
sible to absorb and still remain sane. I
know I will survive any attack, any lack
of understanding from others because I
have replaced the physical stability of a
family with an indestructible mental pre
paredness.
I have become fierce. Acting in defi
ance of death's inevitability by living and
caring without fear — that is the
strength that comes from loss.

fiercely. Her column appears here Tues
