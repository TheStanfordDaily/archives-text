Libertarian mailing false

THE STANFORD libertarians mail
ing received by thousands of stu
dents last week is simply fraud. In
the center of the newsletter was a two
page spread on Ayn Rand, in which the
Libertarians claim she greatly influ
enced their movement with her concept
of individual rights.
In fact, not one fundamental idea of
Rand's philosophy, Objectivism, is part
of the libertarian movement. Perhaps an
analogy will help to clarify the true rela
tionship between Objectivism and Liber
tarianism.
Imagine a heart patient requiring
immediate care, and a cardiologist and a
witch doctor both wanting to perform
the operation. The patient desperately
needs the cardiologist, with his back
ground of rational, scientific study of
the human body. But the witch doctor
argues that he should perform the oper
ation, since he wants to perform
"surgery" also.
The witch doctor claims to be greatly
influenced by the cardiologist, but that
he isn't "limited" by the scientific study
that limits the cardiologist. Besides, says
the witch doctor, if we save the patient,
isn't that all that matters, regardless of
whether we save him with science-based
medicine?

In the political realm, the witch
doctor is Libertarianism and the car
diologist is Objectivism.
According to Objectivism, "indi
vidual rights" is a meaningful con
cept only when derived from a ratio
nal ethics, just as "surgery" is mean
ingful to the cardiologist only as
term for a procedure rooted in sci
ence.
Libertarianism uses the words "indi
vidual rights" with no specific meaning,
basis or justification, just as a witch doc
tor uses the word "surgery." The 1980
Libertarian Party presidential candi
date, Ed Clark, makes this view explicit.
"In the Libertarian point of view," said
Mr. Clark, "we don't support any moral
codes."
The superficial similarities of Objec
tivist politics and Libertarianism are
precisely that: superficial. By stealing
the name and intellectual power of Ayn
Rand, Libertarians do more damage to
Rand's ideas than Marxists. As Ayn
Rand once said, "If you want to think
of [joiningl the Libertarian Party, I
would say join the Communist Party.
You will be cleaner, intellectually at
least."
