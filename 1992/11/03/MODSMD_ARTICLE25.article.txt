# OASIS/Hillel team-up is a step in right direction
## 
### 
While I was pleased that coverage
was given to "Women's Visions for
Peace: An Arab-Jewish Dialogue," in the
Oct. 30 Daily, I was extremely disap
pointed by an important omission.
As I clearly stated when I introduced
the program, the talk was co-sponsored
by not only Hillel and the Jewish Stu
dent Association, but also OASIS, the
Organization of Arab-American Stu-

dents in Stanford and the Feminist
Studies Program.
I believe the fact that a Jewish stu
dent group and an Arab student group
co-sponsored a talk on the peace move
ment is as significant as the event itself.
We hope to continue to work with
other groups on campus, especially
OASIS in the interests of better rela
tions between students and helping in
our own small way to further the peace
process in the Middle East.
