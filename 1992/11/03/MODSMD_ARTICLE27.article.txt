## Field hockey splits, misses NCAA's Cardinal takes one of two 
### Oscar Dominguez Staff writer 
The success or failure of a season is often depen
dent upon a few key games. For the women's varsi
ty field hockey team, these games are all against
California.
The Cardinal split the last two games of the reg
ular season last week with the Bears winning the
first game 1-0 and dropping the second 3-1. Both
games were at Berkeley.
"Everything was working for them," said team
co-captain Kristina Vidal. "They took more shots
and we weren't quite together."
Early on, the tone of the game was set by Cal,
who scored twice within the first 10 minutes of the
contest.
The first Bear score came when a straight shot
hit a Cardinal defender's foot and glanced off into
the goal.
With six minutes left in the first half, the Cardi
nal scored off a free hit. Sara Hallock took the
deflected shot and beat the goalie to the right side
for the score.
The second half ended the way the majority of
the game had gone, with the Bears scoring one last
time.
"We played completely the opposite from Tues
day," said Hallock, the team's scoring leader with
17 goals. "We know we didn't play to the best of our
capabilities; we know we're a better team."
With the loss, the team's chances of going to the
NCAA tournament were also lost, as Cal will
remain at least one game ahead of Stanford for the
rest of the season.
However, the women still have a chance of cap
turing the Northern Pacific Conference title with
another win over Cal in the NorPac playoffs, to be
held Thursday at Berkeley.
"I'm really glad we get to play them [Cal] again,"
said co-captain Chris Trevino. "It's important that
we finish on a good note. It's not as important to
win or lose, but to play to our potential."
"It needs to be a better executed game," said
head coach Sheryl Johnson. "They need to be there
mentally as a unit."
After the all-important final meeting with the
Bears, the Cardinal travels to meet UC-Santa Bar
bara, a club team awaiting varsity status, on Satur
day.
Because Santa Barbara,.along with Chico State,
is waiting to gain official status in the NorPac, the
contest against the Gauchos has plenty of future
implications.
