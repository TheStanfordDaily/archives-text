# Soccer is No.2 in West Region
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
In a controversial decision,
the NCAA selection committee
for the 1992 Women's Soccer
Championships ranked Stan
ford (16-1-1) second in the
West regional behind Santa
Clara (11-4-2).
As a result, the Cardinal
will host Portland (18-1) Sun
day at 2 p.m. in first-round
action, with the winner facing
Santa Clara.
The regional committee had
placed Stanford ahead of both
Santa Clara and Portland, but
the national committee over
ruled that move, citing
strength of schedule as a major
reason that the Broncos were
eventually seeded above the
Cardinal.
"They had a tough schedule,
but they still have four losses
and two ties while we only
have one loss and one tie," said
Stanford coach Berhane Ande
berhan, who is a member of
the selection committee but
had no input regarding his
team's ranking.
"When your team is being
considered, you have to get off
the committee," he said. "I dis
agreed with [the ranking] but I
have to abide by it."
The Cardinal would proba
bly have received a first-round
bye if it hadn't tied Santa
Clara 1-1 at home. Even after
the tie, Stanford appeared to
have the inside track to the top
seed in the region by virtue of a
2-1 victory over Connecticut
last Sunday, combined with a
Bronco loss to Hartford.
But instead of having two
weeks to prepare for the play

ofTs, the Cardinal must focus
on the Sunday match with
Portland.
"We just tried to keep the
players in a positive frame of
mind," Andeberhan said after
explaining the playoff situa
tion to the team. "We want to
stay on course and keep a good
level of intensity."

'When your team is
considered, you have
to get off the com
mittee. I disagreed
with [the ranking] but
i have to abide by it.'

While Andeberhan was dis
pleased with the NCAA sched
ule, he was probably not the
only coach surprised by the
draw. North Carolina (22-0),
the obvious choice, was chosen
as the top seed in the country.
But Virginia (14-4-1) was
named the second seed overall
and got a first-round bye while
Hartford (18-1) was placed in
the Cavaliers' half of the draw
and was seeded below Virginia.
Stanford, Santa Clara and
Portland were put in the Tar
Heels' half of the draw. If the
Cardinal reaches the Final
Four, it will battle North Car
olina in the NCAA semifinals,
unless the Tar Heels lose to the
winner of the William and
Mary-North Carolina State
match. The Final Four will be
held Nov. 21-22.
