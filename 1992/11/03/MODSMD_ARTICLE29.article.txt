The Cardinal will finish 9-4,
ranked No. 14.
• Goodbye, Magic.
Earvin Johnson decided to
hang up the sneakers for good
Monday night, and the time to
elevate him to a new level is now.
Magic announced that his res
olution to leave the game was
based largely on the fact that
other players had reservations
about competing against him.
Without rehashing the entire
should-he-play-if-he's-HIV-posi
tive issue, the man who brought
professional basketball back to
life a decade ago earned yet
another round of commemora
tion.
The NBA should make an
exception to its waiting period
before a player is eligible for
induction to the Hall of Fame. Let
us all ei\joy Magic's coronation
while his health is still with him.
• Thank goodness Arizona
beat us last month. In a moronic
ofT-season deal (considering the
preponderant football power of
the Pac-10), the conference com
mitted its third-place team to
play the second-best team from

the WAC in the measly, unpubli
cized Freedom Bowl.
That's where the Wildcats will
likely be playing the last week of
December. Meanwhile, we'll be
spending New Year's weekend in
Miami at the Blockbuster.
• Warriors coach Don Nelson
will start five off-guards in Gold
en State's NBA opener. But he
plans to stick with that lineup
only until Sarunas Marciulionis
returns from a broken leg. . .
Then he'll see if they let him start
six.
• I didn't go to the horse races
last weekend. . . . Aren't you
glad?

• Washington locks up with
Arizona in Tucson this weekend.
If anyone is going stop the
Huskies from winning their sec
ond-straight national champi
onship, it will happen in a low
scoring game Saturday.
• Someone please tell me the
Trojan defense possesses no
speed.
• Kudos to Daily Weenie
columnist, Todd Kummer.
Apparently, his column lament
ing the demise of Russell White
offended the Bears senior tail
back enough that he rushed for
148 yards in a 48-12 stomping of
Sure, our 300-pounder
laden offensive line hasn't quite
been up to par of late. . . but I
think I'll let Joel Stein handle
that one.
• Weenie Watch: The Golden
Bears looked awesome in their
rout of the Bruins Saturday.
They also did a much better job of
staying with the Huskies (in Seat
tle) than we did. Admittedly, it's
early to look ahead, but don't be
surprised if the fate of the Axe
rests on the last-second mettle of
Eric Abrams' left foot.

Kevin Jeffery still thinks the Wee
nies have about as much of a
chance to win Big Game as
George Bush does to win tonight.
BEAT CAL!
