# One tough cookie
## Sexual Assault Info Resource Center coordinator works to define new role 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Although she has lived in
Northern California for four
years, Fran Gibson's easy-going
manner and slight drawl betray
her Southern roots.
For Gibson, the new coordinator
of the Sexual Assault Information
Resource Center, the word "home
town" conjures up images of Wilm
ington, N.C. But the energetic new
comer is hardly a Southern belle.
In fact, Gibson was chosen for
the coordinator position because
of her grittiness and dedication to
fighting against the degradation
of women by addressing "sexual
assault, harassment and the full
gamut of sexual coercion issues."
Her first visit to California was
as a South Carolina delegate for
the Democratic National Conven
tion, during which she educated
other women delegates about po
litical activism. She also has a
strong background and interest in
human and civil rights, public pol
icy and counseling.
As the Southern "good ol' boys"
that Gibson decries would say, she
is "one tough cookie."
Gibson first heard about Stan
ford's search for a second sexual
assault-prevention coordinator
while she was teaching sex educa
tion and human health earlier this
year at Diablo Valley College, an
East Bay community college.

The two-year, half-time position
— which was funded by the Cowell
Student Health Center and the Of
fice of Student Affairs — supple
ments the role played by Coordina
tor of Sexual Assault Prevention
Education Caroline Mitchell.
Mitchell said her predecessor,
Susan Epstein, was the most visi
ble advocate of sexual-assault pre
vention on campus, and her re
sponsibilities beraime too numer
ous for one person to handle.
When Gibson heard of the
opening, she hesitated at first be
cause she was "a bit daunted by
Stanford's reputation.
"One day later, I told myself,
'Get with it! You like students and
you have the skills,' and I ap
plied," she said, flashing a smile as
if to say, "And the rest is history."
Gibson has been working in the
center for two weeks now, getting
acquainted with students and
Stanford in general.
She said while she and Mitchell
"are in the process of articulating
the two roles" of center coordina
tor and coordinator of prevention
education, Gibson already has
some definite goals she wants to
accomplish this year.
While Mitchell concentrates on
outreach and education, Gibson
said she would like to serve as a re
source for both victims and policy
makers at the University.
