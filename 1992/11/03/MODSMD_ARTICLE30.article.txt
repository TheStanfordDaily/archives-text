# Basketball doesn't wait, starts practice
## Men's team begins post-Keefe era shortly after Nov.1 deadline

Roscoe Maples Pavilion, empty for two
weeks longer than usual due to the new
NCAA practice schedule, was finally an audi
torium for the squeaking of new sneakers as
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery held the
first official practice of the 1992-93 basket
ball season Sunday morning.
Fifteen players arrived bright and early at
10 a.m., filled with optimism and anticipa
tion for the new campaign and a repeat trip
to the NCAA Tournament. The team prac
ticed again in the afternoon, and will con
vene daily until the first exhibition game of
the season on Thursday, Nov. 19 at home
against the Blue and Gold Fleet.
All but two players return from a squad
that went 18-11 and advanced to the First
Round Southeast Regional of March Mad
ness. All-American forward Adam Keefe
(25.3 ppg, 12.2 rebounds), Stanford's go-to
guy for the past four years, is now displaying
his talents as a first-round draft choice of the

NBA's Atlanta Hawks. Meanwhile, forward
Paul Garrett (7.6 ppg, 6.0 rebounds) forgave
his final year of athletic eligibility to pursue
a career in public policy.
Stanford's offensive focus will shift this
year from a get-the-ball-inside approach to a
perimeter style game. The backcourt
remains intact and is Stanford's most coher
ent element. Senior point guard Marcus Lol
lie, last year's Pac-10 leader in assists, will
run the offense, and senior off-guard Peter
Dukes will again be expected to provide con
sistent outside shooting. Montgomery
expects each to increase his role this season.
"Marcus needs to become more scoring
oriented, and Pete needs to be a more com
plete player â€” not just shoot the three but
be more responsible and provide team lead
ership."
A third senior, guard Kenny Hicks, pro
vides quickness off the bench, but "needs to
be more consistent game in and game out,"
Montgomery said. Sophomore Bobby Patton
has been performing well in practice, as has
freshman Dion Cross. Sophomore David

Harbour injured his thumb in a water-skiing
accident this summer and his status is ques
tionable. Sophomore Warren Gravely
rounds out the list of returning guards.
The small forward position is strong as
well, with junior 6-foot-6-inch starter Brent
Williams resuming his role. The exciting
Williams still has a lot of untapped talent,
and with the departure of Keefe, could
emerge as a true superstar for the Cardinal.
"Brent has the chance to be a dominant,
all-Pac-10 player, but he's now going to have
to deal with being overplayed and being
denied," Montgomery said. "He's going to
have to step up."
Behind Williams is 6-foot-7-inch sopho
more swingman Andy Poppink, who showed
a lot of promise last year and is held in high
regard by the Cardinal coaching staff.
The biggest question of all is the front
line, where the Cardinal has only one player,
6-foot-ll Jim Morgan, who saw significant
