# Basketball doesn't wait, starts practice
## Men's team begins post-Keefe era shortly after Nov.1 deadline

Roscoe Maples Pavilion, empty for two
weeks longer than usual due to the new
NCAA practice schedule, was finally an audi
torium for the squeaking of new sneakers as
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery held the
first official practice of the 1992-93 basket
ball season Sunday morning.
Fifteen players arrived bright and early at
10 a.m., filled with optimism and anticipa
tion for the new campaign and a repeat trip
to the NCAA Tournament. The team prac
ticed again in the afternoon, and will con
vene daily until the first exhibition game of
the season on Thursday, Nov. 19 at home
against the Blue and Gold Fleet.
All but two players return from a squad
that went 18-11 and advanced to the First
Round Southeast Regional of March Mad
ness. All-American forward Adam Keefe
(25.3 ppg, 12.2 rebounds), Stanford's go-to
guy for the past four years, is now displaying
his talents as a first-round draft choice of the

NBA's Atlanta Hawks. Meanwhile, forward
Paul Garrett (7.6 ppg, 6.0 rebounds) forgave
his final year of athletic eligibility to pursue
a career in public policy.
Stanford's offensive focus will shift this
year from a get-the-ball-inside approach to a
perimeter style game. The backcourt
remains intact and is Stanford's most coher
ent element. Senior point guard Marcus Lol
lie, last year's Pac-10 leader in assists, will
run the offense, and senior off-guard Peter
Dukes will again be expected to provide con
sistent outside shooting. Montgomery
expects each to increase his role this season.
"Marcus needs to become more scoring
oriented, and Pete needs to be a more com
plete player — not just shoot the three but
be more responsible and provide team lead
ership."
A third senior, guard Kenny Hicks, pro
vides quickness off the bench, but "needs to
be more consistent game in and game out,"
Montgomery said. Sophomore Bobby Patton
has been performing well in practice, as has
freshman Dion Cross. Sophomore David

Harbour injured his thumb in a water-skiing
accident this summer and his status is ques
tionable. Sophomore Warren Gravely
rounds out the list of returning guards.
The small forward position is strong as
well, with junior 6-foot-6-inch starter Brent
Williams resuming his role. The exciting
Williams still has a lot of untapped talent,
and with the departure of Keefe, could
emerge as a true superstar for the Cardinal.
"Brent has the chance to be a dominant,
all-Pac-10 player, but he's now going to have
to deal with being overplayed and being
denied," Montgomery said. "He's going to
have to step up."
Behind Williams is 6-foot-7-inch sopho
more swingman Andy Poppink, who showed
a lot of promise last year and is held in high
regard by the Cardinal coaching staff.
The biggest question of all is the front
line, where the Cardinal has only one player,
6-foot-ll Jim Morgan, who saw significant
time last year. Morgan, however,
has a herniated disk in his back,
and according to trainer Dake
Walden will return by Christmas
at the earliest.
"We've got a lot of people back,
so your expectations are high,"
said Montgomery. "But what we
did lose was substantial. We're
going to need to find some people
that can play inside."
The responsibility of filling the
holes in the front line falls on rel
atively inexperienced shoulders,
with junior 6-foot-8-inch forward
Jason Weaver and 6-foot-9-inch
sophomore Todd Manley expected
to round out the starting five.
Sophomores Bart Lammersen
and Nick Ravn and freshman
Darren Allaway will be called on

early to produce in reserve. Car
los Williams, a transfer from
Brown who was expected to con
tribute, quit the team for person
al reasons.
Practice this year began on
Nov. 1 under new NCAA guide
lines. The opening date in previ
ous years y/as Oct. 15. Mont
gomery feels that the two weeks
lost hurt programs like Stan
ford's that emphasize teaching,
while they benefit those with the
most blue-chip athletes.
"It hurts a school like us
because that's twelve practices
that I don't have," Montgomery
said. "But a lot of rules that are
made benefit people with all the
All-Americans. You'd hate to see
that recruiting is the only thing
that matters in college basket
ball . . . you'd like to think that
you could coach."
To compensate, Stanford went
on a two-week tour of Europe

'We've got a lot of peo
ple back, so your ex
pectations are high.'
— Mike Montgomery

this summer, allowing the play
ers to get used to each other and
making up for the lost time in
October.
If the inexperienced players
can get the flow down early, Stan
ford will be in good shape; if not,
given the strength of Stanford's
schedule, it could be a long year.
"We're going to have to do the
little things, play very focused
and very together," Montgomery
said. "We have some guys who are
capable of being big time players.
Trying to get to the postseason
again will be tough, but it's a real
istic goal."
