# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
On this Election Day, The Daily's selec
tions for Athletes of the Week — seniors
Chip Blankenhorn and Julie Foudy —
reflect a vote that celebrates the accomplish
ments of the last four years, of a time of
growth and success for Cardinal athletics
under experienced leadership.
Both on and off the field, the Cardinal
water polo and women's soccer teams have

placed their trust in the steady character
and accomplishment of Blankenhorn and
Foudy since 1989. Now, after overcoming
numerous obstacles in recent years, both
squads stand poised on the verge of unprece
dented achievement.
Blankenhorn, a fieldman from Newport
Beach, Calif, lived up to his captain's billing
last Friday as he paced Stanford with four
goals against conference rival UCLA. The
second-ranked Cardinal (20-3) went on to
clobber the No. 6 Bruins by an 11-3 count.
Blankenhorn, a second team All-American
and first team All-Pacific 10 Conference
selection in 1991, will figure largely in coach
Dante Dettamanti's plans as the Cardinal
heads into what could be its biggest weekend
of the season — one that features back-to
back home clashes with USC and No. 1 Cali
fornia on Saturday and Sunday — seeking a
push toward its first NCAA crown since
1986.

Foudy, a midfielder from Laguna Niguel,
Calif., came up huge last weekend. Led by
Foudy's two goals and four assists, the Car
dinal (16-1-1) swept Washington State and
Connecticut off of the Maloney Field turf
and assured itself of a berth in the 12-team
NCAA Women's Soccer Championship
Tournament.
As Stanford's road to a 1992 title starts
with a home contest against Portland this
Sunday, the squad need only to look back to

a year ago to witness Foudy's importance to
the team. With the junior leader off winning
a Women's World Cup as a representative on
the United States national team, the 1991
Cardinal and wound up on the short end of a
1-0 triple overtime loss in the second round
of the NCAA playoffs. With Foudy in the
lineup this time around, there is no telling
how far her team will go.
