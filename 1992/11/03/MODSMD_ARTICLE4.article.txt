# White Plaza vendors get extended deadline
## 
### Alexa Lee Staff writer 
The University has extended the deadline
for White Plaza vendors to close up shop,
giving them until Dec. 18 to continue selling
their wares.
Just two weeks ago, the University noti
fied the vendors that they would no longer be
able to sell in White Plaza starting Nov. 1.
Stanford officials said the vendors' com
mercial activity was a potential threat to the
tax-free status of University land and that
they would no longer monitor them to en
sure compliance with California tax law.
"After being approached by a vendor who
requested an extension, we decided to allow
them to continue until Dec. 18," said Tresid
der Union Director Bobbi Braden, whose of
fice is currently responsible for overseeing
the vendors.
"We recognize that the holiday season is
one of the busiest times for them, and it
would allow additional time for them to relo
cate," she said.
But Chris Canellos, accounting officer in
the Controller's Office, said, "We remain

very concerned with the potential liabilities
surrounding these issues."
Jewelry craftsman Brian Cooperrider,
owner of Lone Mountain Designs, said he did
not expect the extension but added that it
"felt good because it will give us some extra
days to adjust and possibly work things out."
"People have been really supportive, and
we get the feeling that they want us to stay,"
said Freed.
The original decision prompted the circu
lation of a petition asking the University to
let the vendors stay, Freed said.
More than 700 people have signed the pe
tition, which is posted in White Plaza during
the day. Several students are also circulating
petitions.
"We hope that this will show the people in
charge how important this is to us, as well as
the students," Freed said.
The matter is also scheduled to be dis
cussed at tonight's ASSU Senate meeting.
"A few members are now looking at possibil
ities to keep the vendors here," said undergrad
uate senator Anoop Prakash. "I personally feel
that its something about Stanford
that's worth saving."
The student governments at
Foothill and DeAnza colleges
manage similar commercial activ
ities on their campuses.
"Vendors sign up two to three
weeks ahead of time, sign in, sign
out and then give 10 percent of
what they earned that day to the
school's Club Fund," explained a
staff member in the Office of Stu
dent Activities at Foothill Col
lege.
"It works out at the other
places that I've checked in with,"
said one vendor. "Student groups
sponsor us, so we can stay. We
sell, and they earn a little too."
Proceeds from vending could
be used to support the ASSU or
other student groups, he said.
Paul Szczesiul, associate direc
tor of Tresidder, said that if the
vendors were part of a non-profit
organization, the nature of their
business might not be strictly
commercial, possibly eliminating
the problem of conducting com
mercial activity on tax-free land.
Any alternatives would still
need to meet the legal guidelines
that the University is trying to
enforce, Canellos said.
Braden said, "The University
has not changed its position, and
I haven't heard any potential
alternatives formally proposed
yet."
Freed said he hopes "the stu
dents keep up the support. I
believe they like us here. We cer
tainly like them."
"I'm going to do whatever I
can to stay," he added.
