# White Plaza vendors get extended deadline

The University has extended the deadline
for White Plaza vendors to close up shop,
giving them until Dec. 18 to continue selling
their wares.
Just two weeks ago, the University noti
fied the vendors that they would no longer be
able to sell in White Plaza starting Nov. 1.
Stanford officials said the vendors' com

But Chris Canellos, accounting officer in
the Controller's Office, said, "We remain

very concerned with the potential liabilities
surrounding these issues."
Jewelry craftsman Brian Cooperrider,
owner of Lone Mountain Designs, said he did
not expect the extension but added that it
"felt good because it will give us some extra
days to adjust and possibly work things out."
"People have been really supportive, and
we get the feeling that they want us to stay,"
said Freed.
The original decision prompted the circu

let the vendors stay, Freed said.
More than 700 people have signed the pe
tition, which is posted in White Plaza during
the day. Several students are also circulating
petitions.
"We hope that this will show the people in
charge how important this is to us, as well as
the students," Freed said.
The matter is also scheduled to be dis
cussed at tonight's ASSU Senate meeting.
"A few members are now looking at possibil

uate senator Anoop Prakash. "I personally feel
