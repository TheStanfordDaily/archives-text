# Down the homestretch
## For political activists, it ain't over 'til it's over 
### Michelle Johnson 
Campus political activists will be working
down to the wire today, trying to garner sup
port for their candidates by doing everything
from staffing information tables to phoning
Peninsula residents to remind them to vote.
The Stanford Democrats will staff an in
formation table in White Plaza today so that
students who do not know where to vote can
stop by the table to find out, said Andrew
Byrnes, co-chair of the group's campaign.

In addition, volunteers will hand out
Clinton-Gore and Boxer-Feinstein litera
ture at the White Plaza table and some
polling places. They will conclude a week
long literature campaign by making some
last-minute "literature drops" at campus
residences, Byrnes said.
The College Republicans are taking yester
day and today off, but some will gather tonight
to watch the election returns at Tom Huen
ing's headquarters in Palo Alto, said John
Griggs, College Republicans' chief of staff.
Huening is running against Democrat
Anna Eshoo in the 14th Congressional Dis
trict. Griggs said several members of the
campus group have been working on Huen
ing's campaign.
