# Down the homestretch
## For political activists, it ain't over 'til it's over 
### Michelle Johnson 
Campus political activists will be working
down to the wire today, trying to garner sup
port for their candidates by doing everything
from staffing information tables to phoning
Peninsula residents to remind them to vote.
The Stanford Democrats will staff an in
formation table in White Plaza today so that
students who do not know where to vote can
stop by the table to find out, said Andrew
Byrnes, co-chair of the group's campaign.

In addition, volunteers will hand out
Clinton-Gore and Boxer-Feinstein litera
ture at the White Plaza table and some
polling places. They will conclude a week
long literature campaign by making some
last-minute "literature drops" at campus
residences, Byrnes said.
The College Republicans are taking yester
day and today off, but some will gather tonight
to watch the election returns at Tom Huen
ing's headquarters in Palo Alto, said John
Griggs, College Republicans' chief of staff.
Huening is running against Democrat
Anna Eshoo in the 14th Congressional Dis
trict. Griggs said several members of the
campus group have been working on Huen
ing's campaign.

Students who have worked on
Eshoo's campaign say they plan to
continue working for her right up
to the last second.
"We will be calling her support
ers all day remind them to vote,"
said sophomore Britt Wahlin. "We
need to make sure people are vot
ing for her until the polls close at 8
p.m.
Wahlin said students will also
hold up signs at street corners to
help Eshoo's "name recognition"
when people enter the polling booth.
The Stanford Democrats will
host a party at the Coffee House at
8 p.m. to watch the election returns

come in, Byrnes said, and Wahlin
said Eshoo volunteers will gather at
her Palo Alto headquarters.
Members of both political par
ties have been busy this quarter
preparing for today's election.
In addition to working on cam
paigns and sponsoring debates,
they have distributed campaign
flyers and pamphlets and regis
tered students to vote. The Stan
ford Democrats also organized pre
sentations on the Clinton-Gore
ticket and a bicycle rally.
Last night at Toyon Hall, the
Stanford Democrats and College
Republicans sponsored the last in
a series of 10 election debates.
Some members of the Stanford
Democrats spent yesterday
evening working phone banks at
the Clinton-Gore office in Moun

tain View, Byrnes said.
Although the campus group is
not formally affiliated with the
Clinton campaign, some members
have worked with the local office
during the campaign, he said.
"Recently, it's been impressive
to see how involved and excited
people are," Byrnes said, although
he noted that midterms have cut
into some volunteers' activity.
Both Byrnes and Griggs said
this year's exciting campaign has
spawned growth in their groups.
"It has been a good year," Grig
gs said. "We've definitely expand
ed our membership."
He said the College Republicans
will continue to recruit members
after the election. The group mem
bers also hope to "serve as an alter
native voice" on campus, he said.
