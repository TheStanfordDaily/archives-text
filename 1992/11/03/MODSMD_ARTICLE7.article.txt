# Palestinian leader addresses Hoover
## 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Hanan Mikhail-Ashrawi, spokesperson for the
Palestinian delegation to the Mideast peace talks, set
out her guidelines for a acceptable settlement in a
speech at the Hoover Institution yesterday.
"We can't just say, 'We want peace.' We need more
than that." In her view, a successful peace process
will require effective party involvement, clear identi
fiable references, a close-ended time frame, a frame
work of logical and chronological cohesiveness and

clear objectives, she said.
In the past, "we accepted a peace process that
didn't have these things," said Ashrawi.
"At the time in which Palestinians present them
selves and make their stand internationally known,
they will have developed their vehicle or tool of
change," she said.
"When the Israeli government collapsed, the world
was in a state of euphoria. We thought, 'Now we are
going to see a new surge of energy. . . of equality," she

said. "We can't expect overnight
solutions, though. We've been on
the receiving end for a long time.
We need to adjust."
Any settlement must not take
advantage of Palestinian inter
ests, as has happened in the past,
she said. She called the Israeli gov
ernment's release of certain pris
oners to appease the Palestinians
a "cruel hoax."
"They intended to release some
prisoners — there were about 800
prisoners at the time. They looked
at the prisoners and only released
the ones who were going to be
released at the end of the month. It
was somewhat of a recycling of the
prison population," Ashrawi said.
Deportation, she said, is the
most cruel of all measures taken
against the Palestinians.
"Deportation has such a final
flavor for us. We, as a people, are
closely connected to the land. To
uproot us is to remove something
organic within us," she said.
Ashrawi's brother-in-law and
one of her college professors were
deported.
A native of Palestine, Ashrawi
has participated in several inter
national peace conferences,
including the Madrid talks in
October 1991.
Ashrawi briefly discussed
today's U.S. presidential election,
saying, "I would like to get to the
point in our history where we
could take elections for granted."
An English professor and for
mer Dean of the Faculty of Arts
at Bizreit University, Ashrawi is
also a founder and member of the
Bizreit Human Rights Action
Project.
