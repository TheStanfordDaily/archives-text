# Clinton trounces Bush in electoral landslide; Popular vote tighter as Perot nets one-fifth
## 
### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
In the end, George Bush was
defeated not by his flip-flop on
taxes, not by his debate perfor
mances, not by the reports about
his role in the Iran-Contra scandal
and not by the far-right rhetoric
generated at his party convention.
The president's loss was a re
sult of something far simpler and
far broader, Stanford analysts
said last night: the dismal state of
the economy and Bush's failure to
communicate a convincing vision
for revitalizing it.

News Analysis

And when Bush finally sharp
ened his message by insisting the
campaign was about "trust and
taxes," several of these analysts
said, he missed the point of what
Americans were most looking for
in their next president: a leader
who really knew what he wanted
to do in the White House.
"People are basically fed up,"
said Political Science Prof. Terry
Moe. "They're upset about the
economy, and I think they basical
ly believed George Bush didn't
stand for anything."
While the presidential cam
paign in its closing weeks became
a battle over little things — like
who was ahead by how many
points, what Bill Clinton had done
in Moscow and to what extent
Bush had "coddled" Saddam Hus
sein — the economy was the real
issue in the race all along. And it
may have decided the outcome
long ago, one scholar said.
"The critical moment came a
year ago when the recession was
becoming the No. 1 story, and

Bill Clinton was elected the na
tion's 42nd president yesterday in
a Democratic landslide that swept
George Bush from office and
ended 12 years of divided govern
ment in Washington. The
Arkansas governor vowed to con
front problems "too long ig
nored," from the economy to
AIDS to the environment.
Bush promised a smooth tran
sition of power and wished Clinton
well in the White House. "It's
over," he whispered to his wife
Barbara.
Clinton, who campaigned as a
"different kind of Democrat" and
pledged an end to Republican
"trickle-down" economics, built
his majority from all regions of the
country. He clinched his victory by
prevailing in Oregon, Washington
and California, becoming the first
Democrat to prevail in the nation's
most populous state since 1964.
"My fellow Americans, on this
day, with high hopes and brave
hearts, in massive numbers the
American people have voted to
make a new beginning," Clinton
said.
He won customary Democratic
strongholds, captured key battle
grounds in Illinois, Ohio and New
Jersey, and made Democratic in
roads into the South for the first
time in many years.
With 80 percent of the
precincts reporting in the presi
dential race, it was Clinton with
43 percent of the vote, Bush with
38 percent and independent Ross
Perot with 19 percent. One expert
said at least 100 million Ameri
cans had cast their ballots, pro
ducing the first reversal in a 32-
year decline in voter turnout.
The Associated Press tally
showed Clinton had won 349 elec
toral votes and led for 32 more —
far more than the 270 needed to
win the election. Bush had 132

electoral votes and led for 25, a far
cry from the 426 he amassed in
1988.
Perot ran the strongest third
candidate race in more than a gen
eration, and the Clinton-Gore
team will take office after having
won far less than 50 percent of the
vote. Abraham Lincoln and
Woodrow Wilson took office with
lesser percentages in eras gone by.
Savoring his triumph, Clinton
appeared with Vice President
elect Albert Gore and their fami
lies before a huge crowd at an out
door rally in Little Rock.
The 46-year-old Clinton will
become the nation's third
youngest president when he takes
office Jan. 20.
"This election is a clarion call for
our country to face the challenges
of the end of the Cold War and the
beginning of the next century,"
Clinton said. "To restore growth to
our country and opportunity to our
people, to empower our own people
so they can take more responsibili
ty for their own lives."
And he added, "I accept tonight
the responsibility you have given
to me, to be the leader of this, the
greatest country in human histo
ry. This is a remarkable coalition
for change. I ask you to keep that
commitment as we move from the
election to governing."

President-elect Bill Clinton 4hd Vice President-elect Al Gore join hands on the podium at the Old State
Mouse last night In Little Rock, Ark. Clinton defeated President Bush in an electoral-vote landslide.
[people were] clamoring for the
president to speak out forcefully
on what his plans were for jump
starting the economy," said Politil
- Science Prof. Richard Brody.
"Instead of acting decisively, he
announced he'd propose a plan in
his State of the Union message.
The impression he left with the
American people was one of, This
guy just doesn't know what's going
on — he doesn't care,' " Brody
said.
Bush only compounded his
troubles by abandoning his conser
vative base when he was pushed to
act on the economy, argued
Annelise Anderson, a senior
research fellow at the Hoover
Institution.
"George Bush wasn't Ronald
Reagan," Anderson said. "He did
not put forth a consistent conser
vative program and push it. His
administration increased taxes
and regulation.... People voted
for Clinton because Bush had not
delivered on the economy and the
deficit, and they decided to try
something new."
Despite Clinton's landslide vic
tory in electoral votes, he edged
Bush by only a few percentage
points in the popular vote — and

failed to win a majority of the pop
ular vote. The apparently luke
warm feelings many voters have
for Clinton hint that the president
elect won't have a cake walk after
his inauguration, observers said.
"He's got 56 percent of the
country voting against him,"
Anderson said. "That should give
him cause to stop and think about
what it was those people were sup
porting."

Political Science Prof. David
Brady added that, while Clinton
will have a Democratic Congress to
work with, he is likely to have a
short political honeymoon because
expectations are high and mem
bers of Congress, who are perpetu
ally running for re-election, will
expect quick action.
"Electoral coalitions do not
always make successful governing
coalitions," Brady said. "Clinton

will have three to six months when
he first comes in to get a lot done."
In addition, the presidential
campaign brought some difficult
issues to the top of the national
agenda — issues that will con
strain the kinds of things Clinton
is able to do, Brody said.
"The campaign raised the
salience of the deficit issue, and it
will be hard to run away from
that," Brody said. "A $4 trillion
national debt substantially
restricts his freedom of play."
While Ross Perot is credited
with impressing Americans with
the importance of controlling the
federal deficit, Stanford analysts
were divided on whether the Texas
billionaire will continue to be a
mtgor player in the nation's politi
cal process.
"He's an individual who follows
an inner voice, and it's very hard to
figure out his psychology," Brody
said. "Certainly he's going to keep
being sort of a public gadfly. But I
can't imagine that organization is
going to stay together."
Brady, in contrast, said Perot
fans should be setting their sights
on a 1996 presidential run.
"The only reason it made sense
for him to come back into the race
[after once quitting it) was because
he wants to run in '96, and his
statement (last night I was perfectly
consistent with that," Brady said.
"I think he's going to be around."

Independent presidential candidate Ross Perot displays a specula
tive bumper sticker during his concession speech in Addison,
Texas last night.
To Bush and Perot supporters,
he said, "We need your help, and
we will do our best to deserve it."
Clinton outdrew Bush and
Perot among key groups including
young people, women, indepen
dents, the elderly and those who
didn't vote in 1988, according to
surveys. He matched Bush's popu
lar vote in the South.
And he was pulling back more
than half of his party's long-lost
Reagan Democrats — the ethnic,
blue-collar, rustbelt voters who
had helped elect Republican presi
dents since 1980.
Forty-three percent surveyed
by Voter Research and Surveys
poll, a joint project of the major
television networks, cited jobs and
the economy as issues that mat
tered most to them. The deficit
was cited by 22 percent and health
care by 21 percent.
When Vice President Dan
Quayle congratulated Clinton at
his Indiana rally, some in the
crowd booed. But Quayle held up
his hand and said of Clinton, "If he
runs the country as well as he ran
this campaign, we'll be all right."
Bush, who had sharply
attacked Clinton during the cam
paign, conveyed his congratula
tions by telephone, and then made
a televised concession. He pledged
a "smooth transition of power."
"I wish him well in the White
House and I want the country to
know that our entire administra
tion will work closely with his
team to ensure the smooth transi
tion of power," said Bush, a touch
of resignation in his voice. "There
is important work to be done and
America must always come first.
So we will get behind this new
president and wish him well.
"The people have spoken," the
president said. "We respect the
majesty of the democratic sys
tem."
The president spoke before sup
porters with the first lady at his
side. He thanked Quayle and
James A. Baker, his closest confi
dante in three decades of politics.
White House Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said Mrs. Bush
had invited Hillary Clinton to visit
the private quarters of the White
House, where she, her husband
and their 12-year-old daughter

will take up residence beginning
this winter.
Perot conceded in Dallas, where
he said, "the people have spoken,"
and offered his congratulations.
But he told his supporters, "We
will stay together and you will be a
force for good for our country and
for our children. As long as we are
together nationwide, you have an
enormous voice in our country."
"I'm available to you any time,
any place, anywhere," Perot said.
Clinton-Gore supporters in San
Francisco emphasized the role of
young voters in the Democratic
victory.
"There was a huge surge of
young people coming into [the
political process]. The sheer energy
of everyone in their teens and 20s
— you made a huge difference,"
said California Democratic Party
Chair Phil Angelides at a victory
celebration in the packed grand
ballroom of the Fairmont Hotel.
• "This (election! w totally going
to change politics," said San Fran
cisco State University student
David Serrano Sewell, a campus
organizer for the state Democratic
Party. "In a very close race, stu
dents make the difference," he
said, adding that the Democrats
registered 52,000 new college vot
ers this year.
Marsha Scott, co-director of the
Clinton-Gore campaign in North
ern California, called on young
people to stay involved in the polit
ical process.
"We've made history today,"
Scott said. "It's going to be tough
and we're going to need every per
son. Get a good education and
come out and join us."
Clinton's victories included
Arkansas, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii,
Illinois, lowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Mas
sachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Montana, New Jersey,
New Mexico, New York, Ohio,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, Tennessee, Vermont,
Washington, Wisconsin, West Vir
ginia and the District of Columbia.
Bush won in Texas, Alabama,
Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Mississip
pi, Nebraska, North Dakota, Okla
homa, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Utah, Virginia and
Wyoming. He led in Florida, nar
rowly.
