# Clinton trounces Bush in electoral landslide; Popular vote tighter as Perot nets one-fifth

### Brad Hayward Senior staff writer 
In the end, George Bush was
defeated not by his flip-flop on
taxes, not by his debate perfor
mances, not by the reports about
his role in the Iran-Contra scandal
and not by the far-right rhetoric
generated at his party convention.
The president's loss was a re
sult of something far simpler and
far broader, Stanford analysts
said last night: the dismal state of
the economy and Bush's failure to
communicate a convincing vision
for revitalizing it.

And when Bush finally sharp
ened his message by insisting the
campaign was about "trust and
taxes," several of these analysts
said, he missed the point of what
Americans were most looking for
in their next president: a leader
who really knew what he wanted
to do in the White House.
"People are basically fed up,"
said Political Science Prof. Terry
Moe. "They're upset about the
economy, and I think they basical
ly believed George Bush didn't
stand for anything."
While the presidential cam
paign in its closing weeks became
a battle over little things — like
who was ahead by how many
points, what Bill Clinton had done
in Moscow and to what extent
Bush had "coddled" Saddam Hus
sein — the economy was the real
issue in the race all along. And it
may have decided the outcome
long ago, one scholar said.
"The critical moment came a
year ago when the recession was
becoming the No. 1 story, and

Bill Clinton was elected the na
tion's 42nd president yesterday in
a Democratic landslide that swept
George Bush from office and
ended 12 years of divided govern
ment in Washington. The
Arkansas governor vowed to con
front problems "too long ig
nored," from the economy to
AIDS to the environment.
Bush promised a smooth tran
sition of power and wished Clinton
well in the White House. "It's
over," he whispered to his wife
Barbara.
Clinton, who campaigned as a
"different kind of Democrat" and
pledged an end to Republican
"trickle-down" economics, built
his majority from all regions of the
country. He clinched his victory by
prevailing in Oregon, Washington
and California, becoming the first
Democrat to prevail in the nation's
most populous state since 1964.
"My fellow Americans, on this
day, with high hopes and brave
hearts, in massive numbers the
American people have voted to
make a new beginning," Clinton
said.
He won customary Democratic
strongholds, captured key battle
grounds in Illinois, Ohio and New
Jersey, and made Democratic in
roads into the South for the first
time in many years.
With 80 percent of the
precincts reporting in the presi
dential race, it was Clinton with
43 percent of the vote, Bush with
38 percent and independent Ross
Perot with 19 percent. One expert
said at least 100 million Ameri
cans had cast their ballots, pro
ducing the first reversal in a 32-
year decline in voter turnout.
The Associated Press tally
showed Clinton had won 349 elec
toral votes and led for 32 more —
far more than the 270 needed to
win the election. Bush had 132

electoral votes and led for 25, a far
cry from the 426 he amassed in
1988.
Perot ran the strongest third
candidate race in more than a gen
eration, and the Clinton-Gore
team will take office after having
won far less than 50 percent of the
vote. Abraham Lincoln and
Woodrow Wilson took office with
lesser percentages in eras gone by.
Savoring his triumph, Clinton
appeared with Vice President
elect Albert Gore and their fami
lies before a huge crowd at an out
door rally in Little Rock.
The 46-year-old Clinton will
become the nation's third
youngest president when he takes
office Jan. 20.
"This election is a clarion call for
our country to face the challenges
of the end of the Cold War and the
beginning of the next century,"
Clinton said. "To restore growth to
our country and opportunity to our
people, to empower our own people
so they can take more responsibili
ty for their own lives."
And he added, "I accept tonight
the responsibility you have given
to me, to be the leader of this, the
greatest country in human histo
ry. This is a remarkable coalition
for change. I ask you to keep that
commitment as we move from the
election to governing."
