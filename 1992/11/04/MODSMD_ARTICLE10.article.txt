# Sher defeats LaFetra

### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Despite decisively defeating
Republican challenger Janice
LaFetra by a 65 to 35 percent
margin, Democratic incumbent
Byron Sher called this year's race
for the 21st Assembly District
seat one of the most competitive
races he has had.
In his previous six races, Sher,
a Stanford Law professor, has
had an easy time, once netting as
as 87.8 percent of the votes.
He said that it was only near the
end that he felt confident of win
ning last night.
The race was closer this time,
Sher said, because he had an
"active opponent who was credi
ble and took [the race] seriously,"
in contrast to previous opponents
who were young unknowns more
interested in getting political
experience and exposure than
actually winning.
LaFetra, who called Sher last
night to congratulate him, said
she was satisfied despite her loss,
because she had succeeded in giv
ing Sher a greater challenge than
he was used to.
"Competition is a healthy
thing," she added, saying that
Sher had learned "a thing or two"
as a result of her determined cam
paign.
"I created some dialogue,"
LaFetra said, noting that dur
ing the campaign, Sher did
"moderate somewhat" what she
considers his anti-business
views.
During the campaign, the two
candidates had differed along
general Democrat-Republican
party lines, with LaFetra declar

ing herself very pro-business
while Sher was known mostly for
his strong environmental legisla
tion.
Contrasting the $14,000 she
has spent on the campaign since
the primary with the $200,000
Sher raised, LaFetra said "I won
everything except the election
. . . . I've done what I set out to
do."

'It's a good day for
Democrats.'

She said she doesn't have any
plans to run for public office again
soon, but said she would "wait to
see what Byron does in the next
two years."
Sher would not say if he plans
to run again in 1994. Because of
the term limits imposed by
Prop. 140 in 1990, Sher can only
serve four more years, and"I
might very well do that," he
said.
Though the returns came in
too late for Sher to give an accep
tance speech, the atmosphere at
fellow Democrat Anna Gshoo's
Palo Alto headquarters
remained confident because of
Eshoo's victory and other Demo
cratic wins by Bill Clinton, Bar
bara Boxer and Diane Feinstein.
"It's a good day for
Democrats," Sher said.
He said he would continue
teaching his classes at the Law
School this quarter, until he is
formally inaugurated on Dec. 7.
