Voters handed Democrats
renewed control of both houses of
Congress yesterday, resulting in a
modest Democratic gain over the
party's old 57/43 Senate mtyority,
balanced out by Republican gains
of roughly 15 seats in the House.
The expected overwhelming
tidal wave of anti-incumbent
anger failed to materialize, but the
103 rd Congress will convene in
January with far more women and
people of color than in the past.
Carol Moseley Braun won in Illi
nois to become the first black
woman ever elected to the Senate.
Patty Murray won in Washington,
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer in California. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell of Colorado became the
first Native American to win a Sen
ate seat.
Two women fell narrowly
before GOP Senate incumbents —
Lynn Yeakel to Arlen Specter in
Pennsylvania, and Geri Rothman-
Serot to Kit Bond in Missouri.
Other new senators include
Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin
Democrat who ousted Robert Kaa
ten, and North Carolina's Lauch

Faircloth, who defeated Democrat
Terry Sanford.
Senate incumbents who won
new terms included Democrats
Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, Daniel
Inouye of Hawaii, John Glenn of
Ohio, Wendell Ford in Kentucky,
Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Bob
Graham of Florida, John Glenn of
Ohio, Richard Shelby of Alabama,
Barbara Mikulski of Maryland,
Tom Daschle in South Dakota,
Harry Reid of Nevada, Ernest
Hollings in South Carolina and
Christopher Dodd in Connecticut.
Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dole won in Kansas, Dan Coats in
Indiana, John McCain in Arizona,
Don Nickles in Oklahoma. Alfonse
D'Amato survived a close call in
New York.
In the House, women won or
led for 45 seats, up from the cur
rent 28. Blacks held or led for 38
races, up from 25.
Among the incumbents ousted
were Rep. Gerry Sikorski of Min
nesota and Joseph Early of Mas
sachusetts, two of the biggest bad
check writers in the House. Mas
sachusetts Democrat Nick
Mavroules, under federal indict
ment, also fell.
