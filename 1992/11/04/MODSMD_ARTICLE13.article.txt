WASHINGTON (AP) -
Women and people of color made
political history yesterday as
female candidates captured Senate
seats in California, Illinois and
Washington and African-Ameri
cans won election to the House, in
some Southern states for the first
time since the 1800s.
"It is exceeding our wildest
expectations," said Harriett
"Woods, president of the National
Women's Political Caucus.
1 The Senate added four women,
all Democrats, to its ranks, bringing
the total number of women to six.
Most of the women who won House
seats were Democrats as well.
Fprmer San Francisco M a Y9 r
Dianna Falnstein. and Coajgifabs
woman Barbara Boxer were both
elected in California; makingsit the
first state to ever be represented
by two women. And the first black
woman senator, Cook County
Recorder of Deeds Carol Moseley
Braun, was elected in Illinois.
First-term Washington state
legislator Patty Murray, who cam
paigned as "a mom in tennis
shoes," also earned a Senate seat.
In California, women won four
House seats and were leading in
three races that had not been

determined. Democrat Anna
Eshoo was one of the winners,
beating opponent Tom Huening in
the 14th Congressional District.
"There was the strong focus of
the 'Year of the Woman.' I can see
why there need to be more women
in Congress," Huening conceded.
But for female candidates, the
"Year of the Woman" brought
defeats as well as victories.
In perhaps the biggest disap
pointment for feminists, Lynn
Yeakel failed to upseat Pennsylva
nia's Republican Sen. Arlen
Specter, whom she accused of churl
ish treatment of Anita Hill during
the confirmation hearings for
Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas.
Kansas state government whrk
er Gloria O'Ddl fell short in an
uphill battle to unseat Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole. Dole
said she ran "about as good a race
as she could."
In addition to the women's vic
tories, races won by a number of
people of color will help bring the
Congress closer to representing the
gender and racial mix of the nation.
Blacks won significant victories,
taking advantage of districts creat
ed under a strengthened Voting

Rights Act to capture their first
House seats since Reconstruction
in Alabama, Florida, Virginia and
North and South Carolina.
"Today's election marks the
largest single increase of African-
American members of Congress
since reconstruction," said Rep.
Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y., chairman
of the Congressional Black Caucus.

Latinos, with a record of 30 can
didates on the ballot, were also
doing well as returns mounted.
In Colorado, Democratic Rep.
Ben Nighthorse Campbell defeat
ed Republican Terry Considine to
become the first full-blooded
American Indian in the Senate.
There have been three other sena
tors of American Indian descent.
