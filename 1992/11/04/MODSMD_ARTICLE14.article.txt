# Morgan wins re-election over Trinkle
## 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
Republican Becky Morgan comfortably
defeated businessman Frank Trinkle last night,
sailing to her third consecutive term in the State
Senate despite the flood of Democratic Party
successes in both local and statewide elections.
After winning the contest for the redrawn
11th Senate district with 64% of the vote, Mor
gan reminded a crowd of about 100 supporters
of her belief in a woman's right to an abortion
and suggested a lack of Republican unity may
have hurt the party as a whole.
"It is discouraging that we lost the presiden
cy," Morgan told the campaign workers who
gathered at congressional candidate Tom
Huening's Palo Alto headquarters. "Perhaps
too many Republicans have been eating our
seed corn and fighting among ourselves.
"It's about time we start planting our seed,"
Morgan continued, harkening back to her child

hood, spent on a farm. "I put myself forth as one
of those kernels ready to start (a) rebirth."
That rebirth, she implied, requires a differ
ent platform from the one on which President
Bush ran. Referring to a recent Republicans for
Choice rally, Morgan extolled the people who
"cheered Barbara Bush and I for being on the
right path for Republicanism."
Speaking from his home in Mountain View,
Trinkle conceded defeat, saying money played a
big role in the election's outcome. He said Mor
gan "had all the money in the world," and that
was an "overwhelming" obstacle.
"We need campaign reform so that candidates
are on an equal playing field," Trinkle added.
Morgan listed education, taxes and the state
budget process as the issues she will focus on
most closely in her next term.
She stressed the need to improve the state's
vocational and technical schools, saying,
"We've done a terrible job — really a disservice
— [training people fori employment."

Morgan also pledged to reintroduce a "tax
payers' bill of rights," aimed at helping individ
uals and small businesses contend with the
complexities of the state tax codes.
Morgan criticized State Assembly Speaker
Willie Brown for starting the budget-making pro
cess too late and said she supported Proposition
165 as one means of addressing the process' ills.
In particular, Morgan countered the claim
made by Trinkle and other opponents of the
proposition that it represented an attempt by
Gov. Pete Wilson to usurp the legislature's bud
get-making authority.
"If the legislature does its work and gets
[Wilsonl a budget by June 15," she proclaimed,
"we stay in control."
Trinkle, meanwhile, reiterated his criti
cisms. "I hope 165 doesn't pass. (If it does,)
that's going to be a disaster."
Claims that Proposition 165 includes "wel
fare reform," Trinkle said, are "ridiculous. It
just eliminates welfare."
