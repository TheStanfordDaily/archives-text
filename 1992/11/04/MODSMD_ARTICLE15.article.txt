# Welfare, death, tax propositions defeated
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Voters yesterday
repealed the "snack" tax, imposed term limits
on more elected officials and appeared to favor
an initiative that would protect public pensions.
But voters appeared to be rejecting initia
tives that would have cut welfare and given ter
minally ill the right to die.
Voters rejected an initiative that would have
extended health insurance to more workers and
another that would have boosted taxes on the
rich and businesses. Foes of both initiatives
said the proposals would have cost jobs.
Voters also rejected a $1 billion bond mea
sure for rail mass transit, but were evenly split
on $900 million in bonds for school construc
tion.
Overall, voters expressed sentiment against
politicians and appeared worried about the econ
omy, defeating measures tied to possible job loss
es and opposing spending or tax measures.
Other defeated propositions would have
banned tolls on privately owned roads once
they revert to the state, created the Office of
California Analyst, and made auditor general a
constitutional office.
Voters appeared to favor another proposi
tion that would exempt from property taxation
the home of someone killed while serving in the

military.
Recession-plagued campaigners raised $37
million for the seven initiatives, placed on bal
lots with voter signatures, the public-interest
group Common Cause reported yesterday. The
amount was less than half the $96 million
spent on November 1990 initiatives.
With 43 percent of precincts reporting, the
defeated tax-the-rich initiative, Proposition
167, had 1,719,636 yes votes, or 42 percent, to
2,421,453 no votes, or 58 percent.
Proposition 167 would have raised income
taxes for businesses and the wealthy while cut
ting the sales tax a quarter percent. Supporters
said the sales tax decrease would have boosted
the economy but businesses said the measure
would have worsened unemployment.
Gov. Pete Wilson's initiative, Proposition
165, was trailing with 1,984,383 yes votes, or
48 percent, to 2,124,205 no votes, or 52 percent,
with 43 percent of precincts reporting.
Proposition 165 would cut welfare about 25
percent and give the governor more budget
authority. Wilson said it was needed to control
California's deficit-plagued budget. Foes said
the measure would hurt the poor.
The congressional term limits initiative,
Proposition 164, was approved. With 43 per

cent of precincts reporting, it had 2,639,201 yes
votes, or 68 percent, to 1,223,200 no votes, or
32 percent.
The initiative reflected sentiment against
career politicians but foes said it would weaken
California's political power on Capitol Hill.
Under Proposition 164, anyone who has
served 12 of the last 17 years in the U.S. Senate
will be ineligible for the Senate primary. House
candidates will be ineligible for the primary bal
lot if they serve three two-year terms in the pre
vious 11 years.
The right-to-die initiative, Proposition 161,
was trailing with 1,958,759 yes votes, or 47 per
cent, to 2,196,121 no votes, or 53 percent, with
43 percent of precincts reporting.
Proposition 161 would establish the right of
the terminally ill to have a doctor hasten death.
Supporters said the terminally ill should have
the option of a dignified death but foes said the
measure would condone suicide.
Proposition 166 would have required busi
nesses to provide basic health insurance cover
age for most employees and their families. Doc
tors said it would have provided coverage for 4
million working Californians with no health
insurance. Insurers said it would have driven
more small businesses to other states.
