## A 						very worthy bill 
### 
Clinton's GI bill allows
college grads to help
solve problems in U.S.

THE ELECTION SMOKE has
finally cleared. Alleluia. With
talk of Gennifer Flowers
mercifully exhausted and George
Bush's microscope off Bill Clinton's
draft record, we can now begin to
look seriously at Clinton proposals
previously overshadowed by a crazy
campaign year and never-ending
attacks on "character."
One of the issues receiving little
attention in the campaign was the
candidates' plans for college finan
cial aid. Bush, sporting his election
year Santa Claus suit and coming
fresh from the chimney of defense
contractors, recently promised col
lege students an unprecedented
increase in Pell Grant aid in a let
ter to college newspapers.
While this increase would cer
tainly have been welcome, it seems
to have come from an A 1 Davis-like
determination to "Just win, baby,"
rather than a true commitment to
providing all with an opportunity
for higher education.
Ross Perot was, of course, with
out a definite proposal, waiting
instead to pick up one of the many
infamous plans that people in
Washington are always leaving on
curbsides and under park benches.
Although it was little-publi
cized, Clinton's plan for college
financial aid is without doubt one
of his most interesting and hopeful
ideas. Slick Willie calls it his
"Domestic GI Bill," and it is indeed
worthy of association with the
landmark post-war bill that
changed this nation.
Clinton proposes the formation
of a "national trust fund" from
which any student could draw
upon to fund a college education.
Repayment would come from
either a percentage of graduates'
future earnings or public service in
a number of possible fields.

With luck, the benefits of this
program will act as WD-40 for our
gridlocked Congress. It would
indeed seem hard to vote against a
measure allowing each and every
high school graduate the chance at
a college education.
The Domestic GI Bill would
allow its beneficiaries, through
their public service commitments,
to address firsthand the very prob
lems of America which have gar
nered so much attention in the
past four months — and so little in
the past four years.
Education. Drugs. Child care.
Deterioration of our big cities.
These are things people care about
deeply.
Whether any of them can be
"fixed" with the passage of one bill
is questionable, but there can be
no doubt that a small army of
recent college graduates working
on them as teachers, police officers
and child care workers can do
nothing but a whole lot of good.
This energized youth, serving as
a kind of domestic peace corps,
would provide invigoration, new
ideas and future leaders in the
areas of government service they
choose — not to mention a dimin
ished government payroll for
workers which would have been
employed in their stead.
The post-graduate work will
help both the served and the
servers. Doing public service, in
addition to giving a feeling of ful
fillment, makes one care more
about the community they are
serving.
And while these fuzzy benefits
are decidedly hard to define, the
bill from which they come may be
the first concrete legislative
attempt to make this a "kinder,
gentler" nation.
In a world in which financial aid
for Stanford law students working
in public interest fields is one of
the first programs to be cut from
the budget, this government
encouragement of community ser
vice can only be called a refreshing
surprise.
