## Don't talk to strangers 
### 
MY MOM TENDS TO be a bit sus
picious of her surroundings. I, on
the other hand, often flaunt my
youthful optimism and semi-arrogance
by being confident of my ability to avoid
or, at worst, handle adverse situations.
Mom is sure that I'm going to get myself
in trouble sometime by being so naive.
Before I left for Washington, D.C., she
reiterated her desire that I "be careful"
when I travel and not "trust anybody."
My cousin made sure I knew not to walk
home from the Metro alone at night. Her
roommates even chipped in with their
life-in-the-big-city advice. So, with these
words of wisdom and healthy skepticism
of any stranger foremost in my mind, I
trekked to work and back each day.
Still, I quickly learned to hate the
impersonal "Metro Face" which most rid
ers on the train wore, especially at night.
It actually wasn't a face, but the absence
of a face â€” no expression and few signs of
life. Tension and suspicion abound on the
late night Metro. The train cars were
usually very quiet. Sometimes I tried to
chat with people to make the time go
faster. Mom insisted I was too friendly
and trusting with strangers.
Still, I wasn't stupid. I didn't saddle up
to any random person in the car to talk
politics. I usually chose people who
looked "OK" to talk with. But one time,
had I followed my norm, I would have
missed out on one of the greatest conver

sations I've ever had. In retrospect, it
would be decent material to use for the
"best conversation" essay on the Stan
ford application.
He did not look like a person you'd
really want to talk with. He was pretty
grimy, wore tattered jeans and carried a
crumpled paper bag. He was slumped
against the window, staring out at the
black tunnel walls and closing his eyes at
the lighted passenger stops.
We pulled into the Woodley Park Zoo
stop and he stiffly shuffled off behind me.
Nervously, I looked over my shoulder to
see where he was. His footsteps resound
ed on the metal steps until he stood next
to me on the escalator. I tried the Metro
face for a while but felt too guilty to con
tinue. Mom was right.
"Beautiful night, isn't it?" Boy, how
trite. I sounded like I was trying to strike
up a conversation with a blind date.
"It sure is, son. Are you just getting
home from work?"
"Yes sir. I'm here for the summer. I go
back to school in August."
"That's great, man. Stay in school as
long as you can. That's the only way to
improve yourself. I just went back to
night school because my company fired
me. I hope I can get a better job with a
degree. Still, I'm not that worried because
I know the good Lord will see me through
it. As long as I have him I'll be OK."
"I agree. Well, this is where I break

off."
"Good luck, son. Enjoy life while
you're young."
I walked the rest of the way to my
house amazed with this man, how the
cover showed nothing of the book's splen
dor. It could have been a teacher or rela
tive talking. He said many things I've
heard from my parents growing up.
I called Mom the next day and told her
the story. She, also, was impressed. She
said something about how people can
often surprise you. Still, it did not mean
that every strange person I talked to
would be as cordial or admirable. I still
had to be careful.
"OK, Mom. Don't worry about me."
I got used to walking past homeless
people in Washington, but I never
stopped feeling guilty. The guy outside
my building the next day didn't look too
savory. As I watched him 10 people
walked by and ignored his plea for
change. I talked to him briefly and
dropped some coins in his hat.
I don't think Mom needs to worry.
