SAN FRANCISCO — Democrats Bar
bara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, who
both promised to shake up the male-domi

first women senators.
"We will be the Cagney-Lacey, one-two

She finally took the stage with Feinstein
at midnight to address more than 1,000
boisterous supporters. "I am here to tell you
that, once again California is on the cutting
edge of history, sending two women to the
United States Senate," said Boxer, who held
up a boxing glove with a Boxer sticker on it.
"In this particular race between Bruce
Herschensohn and Barbara Boxer, the pol

of division. . . have been rejected by the
