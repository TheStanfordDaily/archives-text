SAN FRANCISCO — Democrats Bar
bara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, who
both promised to shake up the male-domi
nated U.S. Senate, captured historic victo
ries last night by becoming California's
first women senators.
"We will be the Cagney-Lacey, one-two
punch for the state of California," Fein
stein told hundreds of cheering supporters
in San Francisco. "So Washington, ready
or not, here we come."
Feinstein, who held a significant lead
over her rival, Republican Sen. John Sey
mour, going into yesterday's election, was
able to make her claim to the two-year seat
early in the evening.
But Boxer — who found her once-large
margin of support evaporating in the past
two weeks — had to wait until much later
before declaring victory.
With 81 percent of precincts reporting at
3:00 a.m., Boxer held a 48 to 43 percent
lead over rival Bruce Herschensohn, a con
servative television commentator from Los
Angeles. Feinstein had a 54 to 38 percent
lead over Seymour.
Herschensohn would not concede the
race late last night, instead scheduling a
news conference for this morning.
"It's pretty close," he said. "I don't know
what's going to happen."
But Boxer, leading in early returns and
exit polls, refused to wait until morning to

claim victory in the battle for the six-year
seat.
She finally took the stage with Feinstein
at midnight to address more than 1,000
boisterous supporters. "I am here to tell you
that, once again California is on the cutting
edge of history, sending two women to the
United States Senate," said Boxer, who held
up a boxing glove with a Boxer sticker on it.
"In this particular race between Bruce
Herschensohn and Barbara Boxer, the pol
itics of hate, the politics of fear, the politics
of division. . . have been rejected by the
.jworld," she said. "What has won,
• in this particular race, is the poli
tics of unity, the politics of togeth
erness, and we are gonna come
.together, all of us."
"We began this campaign
Ltogether and we ended this cam
paign together," Feinstein said.
,-«" We are going into the Senate to
.iwork for all of you."
* Feinstein, the former mayor of
.San Francisco, continued to
(.emphasize the significance of a
female presence in the Senate.
"The roosters may crow but the
hens deliver the goods. Two hens
Sfrom California will go to Wash
ington to deliver the goods," she
'.said, quoting Texas Gov. Ann
-.Richards.
Boxer said she and Feinstein
pwould concentrate on economic
issues, education and abortion
> rights during their terms,
i "We want you to know that we
will never, never vote for a

Supreme Court nominee who is
not for a woman's right to choose,"
she said.
Boxer also reiterated a familiar
campaign theme of hers — cutting
defense spending. "We're going to
tell our allies and friends — Ger
many, Japan and yes, even Nor
way — isn't it time you paid for
your own military?"
Feinstein said she would make
economic growth a priority in a
state which faces 10 percent unem
ployment. "I've seen the problems
and the needless pain annind the
state," she said. "But I've also
touched the possibility and poten
tial of the great state of California."
Seymour conceded shortly after
Feinstein gave her acceptance
speech.
"It was a fair campaign. I have
no remorse. I have no regrets,"
Seymour said. "But let me tell you
that I believe what we fought for,
the philosophies that we repre
sented, they will go on to victory."
