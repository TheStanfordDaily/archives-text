Students for Life just trying to promote honest discourse

STANFORD STUDENTS FOR Life
was created to foster discussion
and promote awareness on the
quality of life from conception to natu
ral death. To this end we invited two
prominent attorneys to debate abortion
on Oct. 27 at Kresge Auditorium.
We placed no restrictions on their
presentations in an effort to provide an
intellectually honest debate.
Attorney Beth Parker now complains
she was "set-up." She fails, however, to
explain why she did not voice her concerns
(all of which were addressed before the
debate) until after the event. We believe
the pro-choice side was very well repre
sented and Parker was well-informed.

Parker was first contacted by phone
and told that she could use any media to
present her case; there were no restric
tions on free speech. Furthermore, sev
eral days before the debate she was
mailed information that detailed the
order and length of speeches, restated
that both presenters could structure
their presentations in any manner they
wished and announced the sponsors on
a draft flyer. No objections were raised.
Regarding the video, Parker states
that physicians claim the babies were
from third trimester abortions or still
births. Most of the babies videotaped
were taken from garbage bags in a
dumpster behind an abortion clinic in

Houston, Texas. The size of the babies
alone indicated that many were less
than 24 weeks old. Mothers do not go to
abortion clinics if they are going to mis
carry; they go to hospitals.
Parker goes on to suggest that third
trimester abortions are rare. Planned
Parenthood's Guttmacher Institute
estimates that 1 percent of women who
have abortions have been advised by
their doctors that the unborn child may
have a birth defect ("Facts in Brief,"
Alan Guttmacher Institute).
That means that some 16,000 out of
1.6 million abortions a year relate to
birth defects. The standard test for
birth defects, amniocentesis, is not opti

mally reliable until late in the second
trimester of pregnancy. Thus, it seems
improbable that only 100 abortions
occur in the third trimester, as Parker
claimed. However, even if there were
only 100, why should we tolerate the
deliberate killing of those babies whose
only fault is being handicapped?
The Stanford Students for Life
believe in a person's right to make
informed decisions. We will continue to
provide educational programming that
will promote open discussion of issues
relating to the quality of life.
