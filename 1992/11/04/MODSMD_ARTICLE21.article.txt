# Partners deserve equal benefits, don't pose a moral danger to our kids
## 
### 
I am writing in response to French
Prof. Robert Greer Cohn's letter of Nov.
2. In his letter, Cohn argues that the
Faculty Senate's approval of domestic
partnership benefits has "massively dis
credited academics in the eyes of sophis
ticated citizens" on the "clear and simple
grounds" that it threatens the "future of
our children."
Cohn has overlooked one clear and
simple reason the Faculty Senate was
completely justified in its actions. Given
that benefits constitute a significant pro
portion of an employee's compensation,
denial of domestic partnership benefits
violates a central principle: equal pay for
equal work.
I find it surprising that Cohn, who
clearly counts himself among such men
of "deep principle" as Ross Perot and
Admiral Stockdale, fails to understand
this most compelling reason for extend
ing benefits to domestic partners.

Lesbians, gay men and unmarried
heterosexual couples do not seek the
moral approval of academics such as
Cohn or of his so-called "sophisticated
citizens." My life as a lesbian, and the
lives of other lesbians, gay men and
unmarried heterosexual couples are nei
ther more nor less moral than the lives
of legally married people.
In its support of the benefits propos
al, the Faculty Senate has shown an
understanding of this fact. At a time
when extremist anti-gay measures are
on the ballot in Oregon and Denver,
there's a tremendous need for some
understanding.
Extending benefits to domestic part
ners in no way threatens the "future of
our children." On the contrary, unequal
treatment of workers based on charac
teristics unrelated to job performance is
unprincipled and dangerous. Our chil
dren will be far better off when this kind
of injustice is no longer tolerated. Far
from being a discredit to academia, the
Faculty Senate should be congratulated
for its foresight.
