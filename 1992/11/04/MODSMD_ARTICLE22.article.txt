# Critics of '80s "greed" ignore achievements of our great capitalists
## 
### 
A recurrent theme during the past
election campaign has been the reference
to the 1980s as the "decade of greed."
This phrase is becoming another popular
historical myth, similar to describing the
late 19th century as the "robber baron
era." Both of these periods have been
times of great economic prosperity, bene
fitting millions of Americans.
Some of the attacks on "the decade of
greed" cite genuine problems — such as
the savings and loans debacle — which
were the result of government's massive
intervention in the economy, and blame
them on private enterprise.
But mostly, the attacks simply cite the
large profits that businessmen made dur
ing the 1980s. Those who denounce the
"decade of greed" refuse to distinguish
between the Michael Milkens and the
Lee lacoccas — between those who earn
their wealth by risk-taking entrepreneur
ship and those who acquire their wealth

by seeking government favors and pro
moting government intervention.
They regard large profits as, in and of
themselves, proof of wrongdoing. *
The real target of the denunciations
of the "decade of greed" is capitalism,
the economic system that recognizes the
individual's right to the material profits
of his productive activity.
It is moral for the individual to live
for his own sake, pursue his own happi
ness and enjoy as much material pros
perity as he is able and willing to create.
Periods of prosperity, and the productive
businessmen who make prosperity possi
ble, should be celebrated, not vilified.
