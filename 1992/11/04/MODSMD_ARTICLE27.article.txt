## Frosh sweeper cleans up 'D' Fischer leads fullback corps to 10 soccer shutouts 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Petite is not quite the word you
would use to describe Jessica Fischer.
The 5-foot-7, 150-pound freshman
sweeper of the Stanford women's soccer
team is an imposing player and, as the
last line of defense before the goalie, a
difficult one for opponents to avoid.
What s even scarier for the competi
tion is that she's the shortest of three
starting fullbacks. Along with Fischer,
5-8 Melinda Minstrell and 5-10 Laura
Wilkes form an almost impenetrable
wall between attackers and the net.
"[Coach Berhane Andeberhan) calls
us the tall women in the back," Fischer
joked. "We re the big trees. Then we've
got Leslie Garrard in goal and she's the
spruce.
"We formed our own club," added
Fischer, who included 5-9 Anna Pati
tucci and 5-10 Dena Dey in the group.
"It's the B-dub club, which stands for
Big Women."
While Fischer has obviously found a
niche among her teammates, the youth
national team starter has also settled
into the college game.
"She's done an excellent job for us,"
Andeberhan said. "The things she can
do with the ball are amazing."
Since coming to Stanford, Fischer
has become a take-charge player on the
field. As sweeper, Fischer reads oppos
ing offenses, calls for defensive adjust
ments and makes sure other players are
covering their assignments.
"At first she tended to defer to her
teammates, but she plays a position
where she must make demands on peo
ple, and not always in the polite vernacu
lar of the classroom," Andeberhan said.
But Fischer is quick to admit she can
still improve, especially in sticking up
for her teammates when opponents play

dirty. Like most of the Cardinal squad,
she is a calm player who disdains rough
play and who concentrates on technical,
tactical execution.
But when a rival takes advantage of
that laid-back demeanor, Fischer steps
in."I just say, 'Hey, watch out. This is
a team you're dealing with and you're
not going to get away with that."' she
said.
And that's exactly what she did
when a UC-Santa Barbara forward
tried to rough up Minstrell in a recent
match.
"I don't know if she even heard me,
but maybe at least Melinda heard," she
said. "It makes you feel a lot better to
know you've got teammates around
and you're not as isolated as you feel."
Besides being more supportive of her
teammates, Fischer would also like to
be a more efficient, less stylish player.
In last month's game against San
Diego State, Fischer received the ball
on Stanford's half with several attack
ers charging towards her. Instead of
just booting the ball out of bounds, she
tried to spin the ball down the line to a
teammate.
The pass bounced off another player
and the Aztecs took off on a breakaway
and scored.
"I should have just hit the ball out,"
she said. "Instead I tried to play pretty
and keep possession."
But the times Fischer and the Cardi
nal defense get beaten are few and far
between. Stanford notched 10 shutouts
during the 18-game regular season and
only once allowed a team more than a
single goal in 90 minutes of action.
Because of this success, opposing
squads sometimes try to avoid running
straight into the teeth of the Cardinal
defense by booting balls deep over the
fullbacks. Then their speedy forwards
have a chance to outrace the fullbacks

to the ball.
"A lot of times the backs are playing
too close to their opponents so the team
can just play through. Then they turn
and blow by us because we're B-dubs
and we get beat like that sometimes,"
said Fischer, who added that Stanford
responds to that tactic by playing softer
defense.
"You have to give them more space
and expect Ithe long balll," she said.
"Let them push it up, and you stay back
a few yards."
While Fischer has become a defen
sive leader and a steadying force in the
Cardinal backfield, soccer serves as a
stabilizing influence in her life.
"I know what I'm doing now, three
months from now and two years from
now," she said. "There's no ambiguity
to my life because soccer is such a major
part. It takes me wherever I go."
After college, she hopes it leads her
to a professional athletic career. Several
American and European players com
pete in a Japanese pro league and she is
considering doing the same. However,
there are drawbacks said Fischer, who
heard about the league from a former
Stanford player.
"The way she was describing it, it
reminded me of 'A League of Their
Own,"' Fischer said. "It's for the enter
tainment of the people. The name of her
team was the 'Lovely Ladies' or some
thing like that. Some kind of degrading
name.
"That's just my impression, but I
hope it's not that way," Fischer added.
But, for now, Fischer is focused on
the immediate future.
"I'm just going to keep demanding
the best out of myself and and never
slow down. Ever," she said.
And as opponents have already dis
covered, a B-dub with a full head of
steam is difficult to stop.
