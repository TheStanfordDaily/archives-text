# Magic pulls disappearing act, crushes hopes of LA fans
## 
### 
On Monday evening, Earvin
"Magic" Johnson again retired
from the world of professional bas
ketball. Stay tuned in March, for he
might "unretire" to don the purple and
gold in time for the playoffs.
Not only does this decision hurt his
team, but it also lessens the credibility
that he worked so hard to achieve.
Instead of promoting a positive example
for HIV-carriers, he has walked away
from the challenge. Magic is turning into
basketball's version of Ross Perot: If
things get tough, he quits; if the people
want him to run (up and down a basket
ball court), he runs.
Lon Rosen, Magic's agent, said, "His
feeling was, if people were afraid to play
against him, that could effect the out
come of the game, and Earvin didn't want
that." Didn't want that?!? Let's get this
straight here. Magic retired last Novem
ber because he was HIV-positive. Then,
he played in the NBA All-Star game
knowing the possible effects — and he
was named Most Valuable Player. This
summer, despite the questioning by for
eign players about spilled blood, Magic
played with the Dream Team in the
Olympics.
After thinking about it for ten
months, he made the decision — a con
scious, well thought-out decision — to

rejoin the Lakers. And now, four days
before the start of the regular season,
after undergoing training camp in
Hawaii and playing in several exhibition
games, Magic takes a hike.
Magic knew the consequences of
returning, and after weighing the costs
and benefits, decided to come back. "It
has become obvious that the various con
troversies surrounding my return are
taking away from both basketball as a
sport and the larger issue of living with
HIV for me and the many people affect
ed," Magic said. These same "controver
sies" were obvious a month ago when he
chose to return.
Why, then, did he choose to return
when all the cards were laid out on the
table in front of him, only to change his
mind a few weeks later? He would have
been better served by putting the issue to

rest a month ago. If his decision then had
been not to come back, fine. No one
would have questioned it. Now, he has
tainted himself further.
Rather than being remembered as
simply a great basketball player, or a
player who overcame adversity to rise to
the top once again, he will now always
have a qualifier around his accomplish
ments: "He was a great player, but. .
Had he made this decision on Sept. 29,
the HIV aspect would have been a mere
footnote to his career. However, Magic
toyed with his fans and his team, and
now all three parties are suffering the
consequences.
The Lakers are now stuck paying a
$19.6 million contract to someone who is
not going to play for them. He's now
making more money than several of the
players who are on the active roster! This
is unjust. He has totally disrupted the
chemistry of the team. Training camp
is supposed to be the time when teams
learn plays and players get used to each
other. Magic has essentially nullified
many of the leakers' training camp bene
fits. For they practiced, and Randy Pfund
coached, with the expectation that Magic
would be a part of the team.
The only "benefit" is that the Lakers
can use the NBA minimum $140,000 to

sign someone else under the salary-cap
rules. But where are the Lakers going to
find a superstar at this point who will
play for chump change?
The fans, both basketball fans in gen
eral and Laker fans in particular, are also
hurt by the decision. Over the summer,
the Lakers had plenty of seats available,
for not many Angelenos were willing to
shell out exorbitant sums to see an aver
age team. Then, Magic announced his
return, and seats that the ticket office
was struggling to sell were snapped up
faster than T.V.s from electronic stores
during the riots.
Now, fans have the seats, but they

won't get what they paid for. This is a
"bait-and-switch" in its purest form. The
Fabulous Forum will be sold out to see a
lower-rung, possible-playoff team, while
the cheaper-priced — and perhaps better
— Clippers still have seats available
crosstown.
In other NBA cities, most games
against the Lakers are sold-out, as fans
hoped to get one last glimpse of Magic.
They'll get to see a decent hoops contest,
but if they want to see a glimpse of Magic,
a trip to the local video store for a high
light tape will be the best they can do.
Much like Admiral James Stockdale,
Magic waited until after he resumed
being an active participant in public life
to ask "Who am I? Why am I here?" The
same answers were available in Septem
ber as were available two days ago. Magic
has always been a winner.
But heeding the ignorant voices of a
few peers rather than continuing with
the single passion that has guided his life
could be his ultimate defeat. Everyone
knew that the day of his retirement
would come again; it's just unfortunate
that it had to come so soon.

David Schwartz will nonetheless root for
the Lakers, with or without Magic. His
column appears here Wednesdays.
