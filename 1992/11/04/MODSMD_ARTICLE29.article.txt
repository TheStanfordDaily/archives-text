# Cardinal golf hits desert
## 
### SooSang Park Staff writer 
Despite heading south for last week
end's Pioneer Electronics Bruin Golf Clas
sic, the Stanford men's golf team was not
treated to sunny skies and perfect condi
tions, eventually finishing tlth out of 14
teams.
The tournament was held at the Red
Hawk Golf Club, a 7070-yard, par-72
course, in Temecula, California.
The first two rounds were played on
Monday, with the final round held yester
day.
Red Hawk is a notoriously difficult
course. Both U.S. Amateurs as well as U.S.
Open qualifiers have taken their shots
there, and before this tournament only one
professional had ever broken par on the
course.
The young Cardinal squad finished with
a team score of 962. Sophomores Steve
Burdick, Jerry Chang, and Matt Thomp
son joined senior Brandon Farley and
freshman Paul Hinkle in their collegiate
debuts.
Conditions for the first two rounds were
clear and crisp, making the course itself
the main obstacle to good scores.
As expected, the stronger, more expe
rienced teams took the early lead. Host
UCLA and Oregon held first and second
place, respectively, after Monday's play.
But the scene changed dramatically yes
terday. As winds gusted to 35 miles per
hour, the final round conditions became
abysmal.
"The weather was so terrible. The

scores were astronomical. We didn't have
anybody below 80 today," said Stanford
coach Wally Goodwin.
Such extreme conditions caused a myri
ad of surprising results on an already diffi
cult course.
A strong UCLA squad, which had won
one tournament as well as placing third in
another this season, finished in sixth place
with a third-round score of 347. In com
parison, the inexperienced Cardinal team
scored a 333 yesterday.
Pepperdine was awarded the tourna
ment championship although they finished
in a tie with Cal St. Northridge with 922
strokes.
The conditions were so difficult that
neither side wanted to continue on and
play a tie-breaker. The winner was decided
by the No. 5 player's final score.
"They weren't expecting any winds, and
they had set up the pins pretty tough."
Chang said. "It just got ridiculous."
"It was really tough on the guys to play
I the course)." Goodwin said.
"After a while it got so bad, you couldn't
take it seriously. Nothing was relative to
normal golf today. It just got be a joke,"
The individual title went to Washing
ton's Jeff Glodt who finished with a 220.
Burdick led Stanford with a 236. He shot a
76 and 74 on Monday, but the howling
winds caused the Cardinal's No. 1 player to
shoot an 86 yesterday.
"There's no way I can be happy or
upset," said Goodwin.
"I've been in that kind of situation
before as a player and a coach, and you just
have to cope with it."
