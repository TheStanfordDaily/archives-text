## Fire or ice? Why climate models can't predict planet's fate 
### Ceara McNiff 
While almost all scientists
agree that greenhouse gases like
carbon dioxide and methane are
heating up the earth, they
remain uncertain as to how
human activities — such as fos
sil fuel combustion — might
affect global warming.
Exactly how the global cli
mate will change is of interest
not only to climate scientists,
but to environmentalists around
the world.
If the warming is severe, not
only will sea levels rise and
coastal areas be flooded, but
entire ecological systems —
forests in particular — could be
transplanted or destroyed.

Computer models used to
predict climate change cannot
agree on the severity of the glob
al temperature change.
They have come up with a
range of predictions between 1.5
to 6 degrees Celsius over the
next century. This wide varia
tion leaves many people wonder
ing how accurate such results
are, and whether they can be
trusted.
Biology Prof. Stephen Schnei
der and Michael MacCracken, a
division leader for Atmospheric
and Geophysical Sciences at
Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, both study global
warning with computer simula
tions called global circulation
models which attempt to recre

ate and predict global climates.
The models break the planet
into a giant grid composed of
cube-shaped pieces the size of
Colorado, MacCracken said.
Massive parallel-processing com
puters then calculate climate
processes for each grid square
and synthesize all the results
into a global climate prediction.
Although researchers would
like to add more precision to
their computer models, "no com
puter is fast enough " to run the
simulation if more detail were
included, said MacCracken.
One of the main reasons dif
ferent computer simulations dis
agree is that "everyone is mak
ing different compromises"
regarding what details to leave

Despite these un
knowns, many scien
tists still put their
trust in these models.

out, he said.
Computer simulations, for
example, assign each grid square
the same temperature and rain
fall, MacCracken said. Any cloud
cover is assumed to cover the
whole state as well, when in fact
we know no clouds would ever be
that large, he said.
Likewise, mountains are
other features that computer
simulations cannot recreate
with precision, he said.
Another reason that comput
er simulations have uncertain
ties is simply because we don't
understand enough about the
physics behind global climate.
The roles of such important
variables as clouds, ice, oceans
and soils in transferring energy
and carbon dioxide are still
uncertain, Schneider said.
All these variables contribute
to planetary positive and nega
tive feedback mechanisms. An
example of negative feedback is
when your body shivers to warm
itself when it cools, he said.
Certain variables in the global
climate work in the same way.
Melting snow, for example, is a
positive feedback.
As snow melts, it uncovers
green land which reflects less of
the sun's radiation than the
snow, thereby enhancing warm
ing which in turn causes more
snow to melt, Schneider said.
Oceans, however, can be
either positive or negative feed
back mechanisms, and scientists
do not yet know which type of

feedback will be more significant
for climate change. It is most
likely, however, that the oceans
give positive feedback, Schneider
said, meaning that they too
would enhance warming.
Despite these unknowns,
many scientists still put their
trust in these models, Schneider
said, because they have predict
ed the temperature variations in
the seasons so well.
However, the difference
between seasons is only six
months, whereas most scientists
are trying to predict global cli
mate into the next decade or
even the next century, he added.
The rate of climate change is
also critical. The feedback mech
anisms of the atmosphere,
oceans, ice, biosphere and soils
all have different time scales,
Schneider said. Scientists need
to know not only whether the
oceans will add to global heating,
but at what rate they will do so.
The rate of warming is partic
ularly critical from an ecological

standpoint, Schneider added,
because species or ecosystems
may not be able to adapt if cli
mate change occurs quickly.
Schneider's present research
concerns the effect climate
change will have on living
things.
He is attempting to bridge the
traditional gap between atmo
spheric research and ecology.
His research at International
Studies is part of a quest to
answer the question. "What are
we going to do about climate
change?"
MacCracken's emphasis at
Livermore Laboratories is
somewhat different. He works
on improving the models scien
tists use to study climate
change, and on getting the mod
els running on massive parallel
computers which allow more
precision with less cost, but run
slightly slower. He said he
hopes this combination will
eventually make the future a
little less uncertain.
