# The
						logic is fuzzy, but the results are real

No, fuzzy logic is not Stanford's lat
est interdisciplinary mqjor between the
English and Computer Science depart
ments. Rather, it is a new approach to
computer control. Already, everything
from washing machines to automotive
transmissions has seen the application
of this concept.
First coined in 1965 by U.C. Berke
ley Professor Lotfi A. Zadeh, fuzzy
logic approaches common sense deci
sions differently than traditional, bina
ry, logic. Instead of forcing yes or no
decisions, fuzzy logic electronically
simulates the imprecise nature of
human thinking.
As explained in recent issues of
Electronic Design and EDN, a fuzzy
logic computer must perform several
steps to reach a decision.
'Fuzzification' is the key to fuzzy
logic. The human mind thinks of
things as vague degrees: very hot, hot,
somewhat hot or not hot. To a tradi
tional computer, something is either
hot or not hot. Fuzzy logic approxi
mates the human thought through
'variable set membership'.
The fuzzifier might define 95 degrees
as a 100 percent member of the "hot
set." Seventy would be 50 percent hot,
and so forth until 40 is 1 percent hot.
A variable may have differing
degrees of membership in several over

lapping sets. For example, each of the
above temperatures may also belong to
a "cold" set, in which 75 degrees might
be a 20 percent member and 40, a 90
percent member.
After the incoming information
(temperature in the example) is turned
into fuzzy set 'membership' data, the
fuzzy logic processor goes to work and
calculates the corresponding response.
Seventy degrees, known to the pro
cessor as 30 percent cold and 45 per
cent hot, might have an output of 30
percent 'heater—on', and 55 percent
'cooler—on'. In current fuzzy applica
tions, this step is performed by tradi
tional computer chips with special pro
gramming.
The 'defuzzifier' has the final task
of turning the fuzzy output into a set of
instructions for the device controlled
by the fuzzy system. The output of the
last step might require the computer to
run the cooler, but with the fan on a
low speed setting.
With sufficiently clever program
ming, traditional, binary logic can
mimic the nature of fuzzy logic. The
work required, however, is prohibitive
ly expensive for use in consumer elec
tronics.
Since fuzzy logic can achieve smooth
results with little effort, it has been
popping up in hundreds of applica
tions, primarily consumer electronics.
Camera auto focus, washing machine
water level control, automotive trans

mission, cruise control and traffic light
control, all use some form of fuzziness.
The range of applications for fuzzy
logic are fairly limited. Controlling
physical apparatus under difficult con
ditions is the ideal environment for
fuzzy logic devices.
Though an American invention, the
past five years have seen the fuzzy logic
market dominated by Japanese elec
tronics firms. Ironically, most have been
using control chips produced by Motoro
la, an American chip manufacturer.
In response to this Japanese domi
nation, many American firms are now
beginning to investigate fuzzy logic.
Whirlpool and Otis Elevator are among
the U.S. firms now marketing products
with fuzzy logic electronics.
Aptronix, a San Jose firm, is cooper
ating with Motorola in developing cus
tom 'fuzzyprocessors'. Aptronix has
developed Fide, a program which devel
ops and encodes fuzzy logic rules easily
using standard PC computers.
Perhaps more important to Ameri
can industry than production of new
fuzzy logic chips is the increasing
acceptance of fuzziness. American
industry has been reluctant to embrace
this technology.
Some analysts feel that unpleasant
connotations from the word "fuzzy"
are to blame, perhaps if "encoded ana
log set reproduction processing" had
been the term coined by Zadeh, things
would have been different.
