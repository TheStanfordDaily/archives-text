# The 						disease of quiet desperation: depression
## 
### Catherine Ivey Staff writer 
Depression is not easily defined, nor
is it easily categorized. As a result, it is a
condition that is frequently misunder
stood and often misdiagnosed.
A recent study from the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine suggests
that people who suffer from serious
depression might return to normal
states more quickly if their condition are
treated as a long-term chronic disease
instead of an acute problem.
The study goes against conventional
methods for treating depressed individ
uals, which favor halting antidepressant
drug treatments as soon as symptoms
disappear.
However, according to the study, pre
sent methods fail to recognize the high fre
quency of recurring bout* of depression.
"More and more, we're finding that
people don't just have single episodes of
depression," the authors wrote.
The medical world has long struggled
for a good definition of depression.
According to the National Institute of
Mental Health, it is "more than the nor
mal blues or the blahs, lit) is a serious
health problem that affects the total per

son. ... It can change behavior, physical
health and appearance, academic perfor
mance and the ability to handle everyday
decisions and pressures."
Estimates from the National Insti
tute of Mental Health (NIMH) report
that depression strikes 15 million Amer
icans yearly. At any given time; between
6-10 percent of the country's population
is clinically depressed.
Psychologists have also claimed that
women have twice the risk of depression
than men
Those with a family history of depres
sion are also genetically more likely to
become depressed.
Despite the statistics, according to an
article in last month's New York Times,
less than 50 percent of Americans
believe that depression is a serious
health problem. More than 40 percent
said they believe it is a sign of personal
weakness.
With attitudes like these, it is no won
der that depression usually goes unre
ported and is frequently misdiagnosed.
But the condition is very real, according
to Dr. Douglas Daher, a psychologist
who staffs at Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services.
Daher believes that depression is

most recognizable through the persis
tence of symptoms that last for more
than one or two weeks. Such warning
signals include sleep interference, low
energy, loss of appetite, poor concentra
tion, weight loss, preoccupation with
sadness or hopelessness, low self-esteem
and thoughts of suicide.
These symptoms do not necessarily
indicate depression. But if these symp
toms persist, help should be sought.
On campus, there are many resources
available for the Stanford community.
CAPS and The Bridge provide counsel
ing and supportive services including
seven-day-a week crisis counseling.
The first priority in helping those who
come in for treatment, says Daher, is to
put people "in touch with themselves."
Daher encourages patients to exercise
more regularly since exercise often
relieves tension that builds during bouts
of depression. He also recommends that
depressed people stop drinking alcohol.
Finally, depending on the seriousness
of the depression and the person's fami
ly history, medication might be recom
mended.
