Q: Cosmic rays are pretty powerful. Is it
safe for astronauts to have children
alter they go up in space, or are their
reproductive systems damaged?
— A space traveller who wants a family
A: We live in a country that lets Dan
Quayle judge spelling bees and upholds
Brenda and Brandon Walsh as cultural ide
als. Frankly, I don't think it's safe for any
one to have children, whether or not
they've taken One Giant Step for
Mankind.
The dose of cosmic radiation received by
an astronaut in near-earth orbit is about 1
millirem (or "mrem") per hour. The gov
ernment of our great nation has, some
what arbitrarily, set the maximum allow
able dose at 500 mrem per year.
For those of you who don't want to
reach down and grab your calculator, this
means that the Right Stuff basically enti
tles you to a pretty view and a way to get
your maximum yearly dose of radiation in
three short weeks.
To the extent that radiation exposure is
a hazard to the reproductive system, then,
our John Glenns and Neil Armstrongs are
at higher risk than those of us who stay
comfortably earthbound.
To understand what these risks mean in
biological terms, we need to discuss the
nature of radiation's effects on the sub
stances that make up our bodies. Although
most highly energetic particles (e.g., the
protons, helium ions and X-ray photons
found in cosmic rays) damage all kinds of
biological molecules — proteins, lipids and
nucleic acids — we want to pay closest
attention to the havoc wreaked by these
particles on our DNA, the molecules which
carry cells' genetic information.
Genetic damage in the cells called the
"germ line" — sperm and eggs, as well as
their immediate progenitors — can have
profound effects on the development of the
embryos that these cells combine to pro
duce. Mutations in certain vital genes in a
germ line cell could result in a completely
nonviable fetus, while changes in other
genes might cause profound physiological
abnormalities.
An astronaut who received unusually
high doses of radiation in orbit would be
more likely to have sustained such germ

line genetic damage than she would have if
she'd stayed on the ground.
The situation is bad enough for the
germ line, but even worse for a developing
embryo. The kind of genetic damage
caused by radiation is particularly harmful
to rapidly dividing cells, especially when
the cells are involved in a complex, finely
programmed process like human develop
ment.
This is because a single cell means much
more to a fetus than to an adult. Lethal
damage to a couple of Mom's cells leaves
plenty behind to do the job, but killing a
few crucial cells at just the right time in
development could result in the absence of
an entire organ or limb in the full-term
fetus.
Hence, if the astronaut in question were
actually with child, the risks posed to the
fetus by cosmic rays would be so large that
she should definitely be held earthside for
the duration of her pregnancy.
Assuming that an increased probability
of having deformed or retarded children is
not what you consider "safe," then, the
answer to your question is a resounding
"No."
Fortunately, there is hope for those of
you who don't want to sacrifice the family
life — so poignantly glorified by our fine
vice president — for a career spent among
the stars. An astronaut who spent only
short times in orbit, staying below the
maximum permitted doses of radiation,
would have only a marginally higher risk of
parenting a physiologically abnormal child.
Even if longer stays were essential, all
hope would not be lost. An astronaut
expecting to receive high doses of cosmic
radiation would have only to freeze speci
mens of his or her germ cells. If the partner
in parenting were known in advance,
whole embryos could also be frozen.
It wouldn't be without risks — power
failures and poor recovery efficiencies have
always plagued cryogenic storage of
human tissue — but, as I said earlier, what
in life is risk-free? Parenting, like a presi
dential election, certainly isn't. Compared
to the risk of sterility or producing crippled
children, freezing embryos is the lesser of
two evils.

embryos that these cells combine to pro
duce. Mutations in certain vital genes in a
germ line cell could result in a completely
nonviable fetus, while changes in other
genes might cause profound physiological
abnormalities.
An astronaut who received unusually
high doses of radiation in orbit would be
more likely to have sustained such germ

line genetic damage than she would have if
she'd stayed on the ground.
The situation is bad enough for the
germ line, but even worse for a developing
embryo. The kind of genetic damage
caused by radiation is particularly harmful
to rapidly dividing cells, especially when
the cells are involved in a complex, finely
programmed process like human develop
ment.
This is because a single cell means much
more to a fetus than to an adult. Lethal
damage to a couple of Mom's cells leaves
plenty behind to do the job, but killing a
few crucial cells at just the right time in
development could result in the absence of
an entire organ or limb in the full-term
fetus.
Hence, if the astronaut in question were
actually with child, the risks posed to the
fetus by cosmic rays would be so large that
she should definitely be held earthside for
the duration of her pregnancy.
Assuming that an increased probability
of having deformed or retarded children is
not what you consider "safe," then, the
answer to your question is a resounding
"No."
Fortunately, there is hope for those of
you who don't want to sacrifice the family
life — so poignantly glorified by our fine
vice president — for a career spent among
the stars. An astronaut who spent only
short times in orbit, staying below the
maximum permitted doses of radiation,
would have only a marginally higher risk of
parenting a physiologically abnormal child.
Even if longer stays were essential, all
hope would not be lost. An astronaut
expecting to receive high doses of cosmic
radiation would have only to freeze speci
mens of his or her germ cells. If the partner
in parenting were known in advance,
whole embryos could also be frozen.
It wouldn't be without risks — power
failures and poor recovery efficiencies have
always plagued cryogenic storage of
human tissue — but, as I said earlier, what
in life is risk-free? Parenting, like a presi
dential election, certainly isn't. Compared
to the risk of sterility or producing crippled
children, freezing embryos is the lesser of
two evils.
Kind of like Rill Clinton.
