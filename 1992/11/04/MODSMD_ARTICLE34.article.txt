# Fifty years after Trinity, nuclear testing may become history
## Scientists, arms-control experts debate effect of recent moratorium on nuclear safety, proliferation 
### Aaron Thode Editorial staff 
The fate of the United States nuclear
weapons program will be decided over the
next four years, as Congress will decide
whether to make a temporary nuclear test
moratorium permanent in 1996.
Last Wednesday, the Peninsula Com
prehensive Test Ban Coalition and the
Stanford Regional Chapter of PSR spon
sored a panel of physicists, engineers and
arms-control experts to discuss the possi
ble effects of such a ban on weapons relia
bility and nuclear proliferation.
The panel consisted of Paul Brown and
Ray Kidder of Livermore National Labora
tory, Sydney Drell and Wolfgang Panofsky
of SLAC, and George Bunn of the Center
of International Security and Arms Con
trol. Herbert Abrams, Professor of Radiol
ogy and co-founder of the Nobel-prize win
ning organization Physicians for Social
Responsibility, moderated the discussion.
The Hatfield-Mitchell amendment pro
hibits any nuclear tests until July 1993.
After that, 15 tests will be allowed
between July and Sept. 30, 1996. Beyond
that date, no further nuclear tests will be
allowed unless another foreign power con
ducts a test.
President Bush signed the amend
ment into law this October in order to
secure funding for the Superconducting
Collider project in Texas. President-elect
Clinton has endorsed the moratorium as
it stands.
The panelists focused their arguments
around questions of weapons safety, relia
bility and proliferation.
Drell chairs the Panel on Nuclear
Weapons Safety of the House Armed Ser
vices Committee. In his opening state

ment he outlined his concerns about the
safety of the nation's present stockpile.
"My view is that further testing is
required, based on our panel's technical
analysis of current nuclear weapons," he
said. However, "safety is the only reason
to continue testing," he added.
The conventional explosive that ignites
the nuclear reaction in certain weapons is
highly unstable. Also, the "pits" which
comprise the fission bomb need to be made
more fireproof, he argued.

The human race must
demonstrate that it has
not lost control over
its own destiny.'
— Wolfgang Panofsky

In particular, the Navy's Trident mis
sile "seriously lacks certain safety fea
tures," he said. In the heyday of the Cold
War, the submarine-based missiles used a
highly sensitive propellant to increase its
range. But now these missiles can and
should be made safer, Drell said.
Also, since several warheads are
"bused" together on a single missile, Drell
is concerned that the accidental detona
tion of an explosive in one warhead may
trigger the explosive in the rest. Although
an actual nuclear explosion would not
occur, the effects on the submarine would
be dangerous.
Kidder, a senior physicist for 35 years
at Livermore, agreed with Drell. He
believes that only 11 to 13 tests will be

needed to confirm that newer, safer
designs will work.
Both Abrams and Panofsky, who is
chairman of the Committee on Interna
tional Security and Arms Control of the
National Academy of Sciences, remained
skeptical.
"Is there such a thing as a safe nuclear
weapon?" Abrams said in an interview
after the discussion. He also questioned
the need for submarine missiles due to
the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"The main disagreement I have with
Drell," Panofsky said after the discussion,
"is that I cannot believe safety is some
thing that you can quantify." Safety
requirements involve "a large component
of judgment on top of analysis."
Concerns about the reliability of the
weapon stockpile were also addressed by
the panelists. Abrams quoted a 1985 let
ter signed by Nobel-Prize winner Hans
Bethe and Panofsky suggesting that "the
best way to confirm reliability is to disas
semble sample weapons and to subject the
components to non-nuclear tests." Sever
al members of the audience also ques
tioned the panelists on whether computer
modeling could replace physical testing.
Drell agreed in part, noting that the
development of new 3-D computer codes
exposed safety concerns with the
weapons.
However, Brown, another nuclear
engineer, said that although computer
codes have "improved considerably over
the past five years," they are still only pre
dictions and need testing.
He also argued that "non-nuclear test
ing can only carry you so far." He told The
Daily that a nuclear cruise missile test a
decade ago failed to detonate, even though
non-nuclear tests didn't indicate any

problem. He also said that current non
nuclear testing facilities (like "flash" X
ray facilities) are not powerful enough to
completely replace nuclear testing.
He also warned that without occasion
al testing beyond 1996, the stockpile will
deteriorate.
"Today, expert designers can do a good
job in maintaining the stockpiles," he
said. But "many of the people who can
make such judgments will be gone in ten
years." Their inexperienced successors
will need to test safety upgrades to verify
their predictions, he argued.
The strongest argument for a perma
nent nuclear test ban treaty, Bunn said, is
that it encourages other countries to
remain non-nuclear.
Bunn was one of the negotiators of the
1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, which
prohibits nuclear countries from export
ing their weapons or knowledge, and non
nuclear countries from manufacturing or
buying nuclear weapons.
The treaty is renewed every five years,
and in 1995 the hundred-plus countries
that signed the treaty will vote on whether
to extend it into the next century.
Bunn conducted an informal survey of
countries attending the 1990 non-prolif
eration conference. "Based on a lot of
scraps I made a guestimate" on whether
treaty would be extended, he told the
audience.
"It will be extraordinarily difficult to
get an extension greater than five years"
if the United States does not commit to a
permanent testing ban sometime in the
future, he said. In other words, many
non-nuclear countries will not promise to
remain non-nuclear.
Bunn strongly opposes any further
tests beyond 1996. "I believe I testing!

Bends a message to other nations that the
U.S. considers nuclear weapons an impor
tant aspect of its national security. This
will encourage other nations to seek
weapons."
Bunn strongly defended the current
treaty, saying that technical issues aside,
"the treaty is symbolically very important
to the rest of the world."
"The failure of nuclear countries to
stop testing is single most contentious
issue" between nuclear and non-nuclear
nations, he said.
Panofsky, who witnessed the first
nuclear explosion at Trinity, also sup
ports the treaty, but not for technical rea
sons.
"The purely technical arguments for
and against a test ban treaty are weak,"
he said.
Arguments that a world-wide test ban
will prevent the development of nuclear
weapons are also flawed, he said.
"As Israel has shown, nuclear weapons
can be developed and presumably stock
piled without an identified nuclear test."
Thus the final decision must be based on
political and military criteria, he said.
His own personal reasons for support
ing a test ban are more philosophical.
"The human race must demonstrate that
it has not lost control over its own destiny
and has not yielded to the 'technological
imperative,' " he said.
Vitaly Bystritskii, a Russian physicist
and Visiting Science Fellow at the Center
for Arms Control, who attended the dis
cussion as an audience member, said he
strongly opposes any test ban treaty.
"If we have a test ban treaty the U.S. may
have to dismantle all of its weapons." And
"the world is not yet ready for life without
nuclear weapons," he said.

ment he outlined his concerns about the
safety of the nation's present stockpile.
"My view is that further testing is
required, based on our panel's technical
analysis of current nuclear weapons," he
said. However, "safety is the only reason
to continue testing," he added.
The conventional explosive that ignites
the nuclear reaction in certain weapons is
highly unstable. Also, the "pits" which
comprise the fission bomb need to be made
more fireproof, he argued.

demonstrate that it has
not lost control over
its own destiny.'

In particular, the Navy's Trident mis
sile "seriously lacks certain safety fea
tures," he said. In the heyday of the Cold
War, the submarine-based missiles used a
highly sensitive propellant to increase its
range. But now these missiles can and
should be made safer, Drell said.
Also, since several warheads are
"bused" together on a single missile, Drell
is concerned that the accidental detona
tion of an explosive in one warhead may
trigger the explosive in the rest. Although
an actual nuclear explosion would not
occur, the effects on the submarine would
be dangerous.
Kidder, a senior physicist for 35 years
at Livermore, agreed with Drell. He
believes that only 11 to 13 tests will be

needed to confirm that newer, safer
designs will work.
Both Abrams and Panofsky, who is
chairman of the Committee on Interna
tional Security and Arms Control of the
National Academy of Sciences, remained
skeptical.
"Is there such a thing as a safe nuclear
weapon?" Abrams said in an interview
after the discussion. He also questioned
the need for submarine missiles due to
the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"The main disagreement I have with
Drell," Panofsky said after the discussion,
"is that I cannot believe safety is some
thing that you can quantify." Safety
requirements involve "a large component
of judgment on top of analysis."
Concerns about the reliability of the
weapon stockpile were also addressed by
the panelists. Abrams quoted a 1985 let
ter signed by Nobel-Prize winner Hans
Bethe and Panofsky suggesting that "the
best way to confirm reliability is to disas
semble sample weapons and to subject the
components to non-nuclear tests." Sever
al members of the audience also ques
tioned the panelists on whether computer
modeling could replace physical testing.
Drell agreed in part, noting that the
development of new 3-D computer codes
exposed safety concerns with the
weapons.
However, Brown, another nuclear
engineer, said that although computer
codes have "improved considerably over
the past five years," they are still only pre
dictions and need testing.
He also argued that "non-nuclear test
ing can only carry you so far." He told The
Daily that a nuclear cruise missile test a
decade ago failed to detonate, even though
non-nuclear tests didn't indicate any

problem. He also said that current non
nuclear testing facilities (like "flash" X
ray facilities) are not powerful enough to
completely replace nuclear testing.
He also warned that without occasion
al testing beyond 1996, the stockpile will
deteriorate.
"Today, expert designers can do a good
job in maintaining the stockpiles," he
said. But "many of the people who can
make such judgments will be gone in ten
years." Their inexperienced successors
will need to test safety upgrades to verify
their predictions, he argued.
The strongest argument for a perma
nent nuclear test ban treaty, Bunn said, is
that it encourages other countries to
remain non-nuclear.
Bunn was one of the negotiators of the
1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, which
prohibits nuclear countries from export
ing their weapons or knowledge, and non
nuclear countries from manufacturing or
buying nuclear weapons.
The treaty is renewed every five years,
and in 1995 the hundred-plus countries
that signed the treaty will vote on whether
to extend it into the next century.
Bunn conducted an informal survey of
countries attending the 1990 non-prolif
eration conference. "Based on a lot of
scraps I made a guestimate" on whether
treaty would be extended, he told the
audience.
"It will be extraordinarily difficult to
get an extension greater than five years"
if the United States does not commit to a
permanent testing ban sometime in the
future, he said. In other words, many
non-nuclear countries will not promise to
remain non-nuclear.
Bunn strongly opposes any further
tests beyond 1996. "I believe I testing!

Bends a message to other nations that the
U.S. considers nuclear weapons an impor
tant aspect of its national security. This
will encourage other nations to seek
weapons."
Bunn strongly defended the current
treaty, saying that technical issues aside,
"the treaty is symbolically very important
to the rest of the world."
"The failure of nuclear countries to
stop testing is single most contentious
issue" between nuclear and non-nuclear
nations, he said.
Panofsky, who witnessed the first
nuclear explosion at Trinity, also sup
ports the treaty, but not for technical rea
sons.
"The purely technical arguments for
and against a test ban treaty are weak,"
he said.
Arguments that a world-wide test ban
will prevent the development of nuclear
weapons are also flawed, he said.
"As Israel has shown, nuclear weapons
can be developed and presumably stock
piled without an identified nuclear test."
Thus the final decision must be based on
political and military criteria, he said.
His own personal reasons for support
ing a test ban are more philosophical.
"The human race must demonstrate that
it has not lost control over its own destiny
and has not yielded to the 'technological
imperative,' " he said.
Vitaly Bystritskii, a Russian physicist
and Visiting Science Fellow at the Center
for Arms Control, who attended the dis
cussion as an audience member, said he
strongly opposes any test ban treaty.
"If we have a test ban treaty the U.S. may
have to dismantle all of its weapons." And
"the world is not yet ready for life without
nuclear weapons," he said.
The fate of the United States nuclear
weapons program will be decided over the
next four years, as Congress will decide
whether to make a temporary nuclear test
moratorium permanent in 1996.
Last Wednesday, the Peninsula Com
prehensive Test Ban Coalition and the
Stanford Regional Chapter of PSR spon
sored a panel of physicists, engineers and
arms-control experts to discuss the possi
ble effects of such a ban on weapons relia
bility and nuclear proliferation.
The panel consisted of Paul Brown and
Ray Kidder of Livermore National Labora
tory, Sydney Drell and Wolfgang Panofsky
of SLAC, and George Bunn of the Center
of International Security and Arms Con
trol. Herbert Abrams, Professor of Radiol
ogy and co-founder of the Nobel-prize win
ning organization Physicians for Social
Responsibility, moderated the discussion.
The Hatfield-Mitchell amendment pro
hibits any nuclear tests until July 1993.
After that, 15 tests will be allowed
between July and Sept. 30, 1996. Beyond
that date, no further nuclear tests will be
allowed unless another foreign power con
ducts a test.
President Bush signed the amend
ment into law this October in order to
secure funding for the Superconducting
Collider project in Texas. President-elect
Clinton has endorsed the moratorium as
it stands.
The panelists focused their arguments
around questions of weapons safety, relia
