## Graduate John Wagner wins 'Story of the Year' 
### June Cohen Editorial staff 
CHICAGO — Nine months after The Daily print
ed articles revealing unusual and questionable com
pensation practices at the Stanford Bookstore, Stan
ford graduate John Wagner has received national
honors for his reporting of the investigative series.
Wagner was awarded first place in the Story of the
Year contest this weekend during a national college
media convention in Chicago, 111.
The contest, which was sponsored and judged by the
Associated Collegiate Press and the Los Angeles Times,
was open to all college newspapers and magazines and
attracted several hundred applicants nationwide.
The articles on the Stanford Bookstore, which
appeared in The Daily last spring, reported the host of
lavish perks — including luxury cars, a motorhome

and a vacation home in northern California —
bestowed upon the upper management of the store,
calling into question its non-profit status.
Later articles disclosed that the Bookstore had lost
$2 million in the stock market in 1991 due to what
one store director called "horrendous" investment
decisions made by a former employee. The investiga
tive series led to an ongoing formal inquiry by the
state Attorney General's office.
Wagner, who lives in St. Louis and took a 6-hour
train ride to attend the ceremony, appeared some
what nervous before the winner was announced.
But after receiving the wood plaque, he said with
characteristic reticence that he felt "Fine, thanks."
At a post-awards-ceremony celebration, Wagner
loosened up and spoke more freely about the award.
"It's good for me. It's good for The Daily. It's good for
humanity," Wagner said.
