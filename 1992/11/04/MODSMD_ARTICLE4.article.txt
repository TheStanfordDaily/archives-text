Democrat Anna Eshoo easily defeated Republican
Tom Huening last night in the battle to represent the
Peninsula in Congress and replace Stanford Law
Prof. Tom Campbell.
In a closely watched campaign, the two moderate
San Mateo County Supervisors sought to win the
14th Congressional District. Eshoo captured 58 per
cent of the vote to 39.5 percent for Huening, with
about 88 percent of the ballots counted.
Eshoo's supporters crowded into her Palo Alto
campaign headquarters throughout the evening,
waiting for her to appear at about 11:10 p.m. to make
a short victory speech.
"Just a few moments ago my good friend [Huen
ing! from the Board of Supervisors called and wished
me well," she said. "I accepted his best wishes. ... I
would like to reach out tonight to all of the people of
this district."
Eshoo said her top priority will be "repairing the
economy," followed by fixing the health care system.
Law School Prof. Byron Sher — re-elected last
night to the California State Assembly — shared the
stage with Eshoo, calling her win "doubly sweet."
In his 35 years in the district, Sher said, "I've never
been represented by a Democrat before. And what a
Democrat she is."
