# Eshoo prevails over Huening
## 
### Miranda Doyle Howard Libit Senior staff writers 
Democrat Anna Eshoo easily defeated Republican
Tom Huening last night in the battle to represent the
Peninsula in Congress and replace Stanford Law
Prof. Tom Campbell.
In a closely watched campaign, the two moderate
San Mateo County Supervisors sought to win the
14th Congressional District. Eshoo captured 58 per
cent of the vote to 39.5 percent for Huening, with
about 88 percent of the ballots counted.
Eshoo's supporters crowded into her Palo Alto
campaign headquarters throughout the evening,
waiting for her to appear at about 11:10 p.m. to make
a short victory speech.
"Just a few moments ago my good friend [Huen
ing! from the Board of Supervisors called and wished
me well," she said. "I accepted his best wishes. ... I
would like to reach out tonight to all of the people of
this district."
Eshoo said her top priority will be "repairing the
economy," followed by fixing the health care system.
Law School Prof. Byron Sher — re-elected last
night to the California State Assembly — shared the
stage with Eshoo, calling her win "doubly sweet."
In his 35 years in the district, Sher said, "I've never
been represented by a Democrat before. And what a
Democrat she is."

with Eshoo, said that while "every
body touts this as the Tear of the
Woman,' " Eshoo would have won
anyway.
"She did it the old-fashioned
way. She worked her tail off to get
where she is today," Speir said.
Huening and his campaign
manager, Bob Marks, attributed
the loss to a number of factors
beyond their control, including the
strong showing of the Democrats
and redistricting.
"She ran in this district before
and began with bigger name recog
nition," Huening said. "The Repub
licans did not do well nationally,
and there were the strong forces of
the 'Year of the Woman.' "
"What went wrong was that it
was the wrong year. We were over
whelmed by the Democratic vote,"
Marks said. "We did exactly what
we set out to do. ... It couldn't
have made a difference."
"Redistricting hurt a lot. . . .
The Republicans abandoned Cali
fornia in mid-September and gave
us no real help," he said. "It was a
tough year."
Both were seeking to replace
Rep. Campbell, R-Stanford. The
Stanford law professor had given
up his seat to run in the June pri
mary for California's six-year U.S.
Senate seat, which he lost to Bruce
Herschensohn.
Eshoo lost a close race to Camp
bell when he was first elected to
Congress in 1988.
In her speech, Eshoo thanked
her friends and campaign workers.
"You have walked, you have
phoned, you have licked, you have
stamped," she said to laughter and
chants of "Anna, Anna."

"What a privilege it has been to
make this journey with you," she
said. "We look forward to the
great responsibility of leading this
nation."
Turning to her children, Eshoo
asked, "Did you ever think your
mother was going to be a Con
gressman?"
After conceding defeat, Huen
ing downplayed some of the nega
tive campaigning that cropped up
near the end of the race.
"There was never any question
that she is a dedicated public ser

vant, and I told her that," Huen
ing said.
Huening said he still plans to go
ahead with organizing the
"Omaha Summit" — his idea for
new congressmen to meet and dis
cuss ways of reforming Congress
and tacking the country's fiscal
problems.
"Tomorrow I will be on the
phone to the 170-some candidates
in 50 states," he said. "I am going
to ask them if they will still attend
Omaha."
But Huening admitted that he

"didn't know what the response
will be" because, in proposing the
idea to non-incumbent candidates
around the country, "we assumed
that we were going to win."
"Something could be said for
the idea of having an 'outside' step
in and propose ideas," he said.
"The question is, 'Will they agree
to come?' I don't know."
Huening said he will serve out
the remaining two years of his
term as a San Mateo County
supervisor, and said he has not yet
decided what to do afler that.

"What went wrong was that it
was the wrong year. We were over
whelmed by the Democratic vote,"
Marks said. "We did exactly what
we set out to do. ... It couldn't
have made a difference."
"Redistricting hurt a lot. . . .
The Republicans abandoned Cali

us no real help," he said. "It was a

In her speech, Eshoo thanked
her friends and campaign workers.
"You have walked, you have

chants of "Anna, Anna."

"What a privilege it has been to
make this journey with you," she
said. "We look forward to the
great responsibility of leading this

After conceding defeat, Huen

near the end of the race.
"There was never any question

Huening said he still plans to go
ahead with organizing the
"Omaha Summit" — his idea for
new congressmen to meet and dis
cuss ways of reforming Congress
and tacking the country's fiscal
problems.
"Tomorrow I will be on the
phone to the 170-some candidates
in 50 states," he said. "I am going
to ask them if they will still attend
Omaha."
But Huening admitted that he

"didn't know what the response
will be" because, in proposing the
idea to non-incumbent candidates
around the country, "we assumed
that we were going to win."
"Something could be said for
the idea of having an 'outside' step
in and propose ideas," he said.
"The question is, 'Will they agree
to come?' I don't know."
Huening said he will serve out
the remaining two years of his
term as a San Mateo County
supervisor, and said he has not yet
decided what to do afler that.

Anna Eshoo, Democratic candidate for the 14th Congressional District, and Byron Sher, Democratic
candidate for the 21st Assembly District seat, rejoice last night at Eshoo's Palo Alto headquarters.
Democrat Anna Eshoo easily defeated Republican
Tom Huening last night in the battle to represent the
Peninsula in Congress and replace Stanford Law
Prof. Tom Campbell.
In a closely watched campaign, the two moderate
San Mateo County Supervisors sought to win the
14th Congressional District. Eshoo captured 58 per
cent of the vote to 39.5 percent for Huening, with
about 88 percent of the ballots counted.
Eshoo's supporters crowded into her Palo Alto
campaign headquarters throughout the evening,
waiting for her to appear at about 11:10 p.m. to make
a short victory speech.
"Just a few moments ago my good friend [Huen
ing! from the Board of Supervisors called and wished
me well," she said. "I accepted his best wishes. ... I
would like to reach out tonight to all of the people of
this district."
Eshoo said her top priority will be "repairing the
economy," followed by fixing the health care system.
Law School Prof. Byron Sher — re-elected last
night to the California State Assembly — shared the
stage with Eshoo, calling her win "doubly sweet."
In his 35 years in the district, Sher said, "I've never
been represented by a Democrat before. And what a
Democrat she is."

with Eshoo, said that while "every
body touts this as the Tear of the
Woman,' " Eshoo would have won
anyway.
"She did it the old-fashioned
way. She worked her tail off to get
where she is today," Speir said.
Huening and his campaign
manager, Bob Marks, attributed
the loss to a number of factors
beyond their control, including the
strong showing of the Democrats
and redistricting.
"She ran in this district before
and began with bigger name recog
nition," Huening said. "The Repub
licans did not do well nationally,
and there were the strong forces of
the 'Year of the Woman.' "
"What went wrong was that it
was the wrong year. We were over
whelmed by the Democratic vote,"
Marks said. "We did exactly what
we set out to do. ... It couldn't
have made a difference."
