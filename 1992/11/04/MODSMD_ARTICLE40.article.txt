# ASSU OKs changes to Judicial Charter
## 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate accepted all
but one of the Committee of Fif
teen's amendments to the Stan
ford Judicial Charter at a quiet
and routine meeting last night.
The amendments, which are
directed primarily toward sexual
assault cases, regard the process of
filing complaints and the rights of
witnesses. They have already been
accepted by the Faculty Senate and
will now be included in the charter.
One of the key amendments
which was accepted states that "evi
dence of the sexual history of per
sons initiating complaints shall not
be admissible unless a hearing offi
cer at the fact-finding hearing
makes a specific finding of relevance
according to the rules of evidence."
But the Senate did not accept
the amendment which states that
students may make confidential
anonymous reports to the Univer
sity's judicial affairs officer. These
complaints, which cannot be used
in court proceedings, remain in an
accused student's file until after
graduation.
Former Council of Presidents
member Beth Morgan said the
confidential anonymous complaint
process is already in use and the
ASSU's rejection of it will proba
bly only keep it out of the judicial
charter, not end the procedure.
Graduate senator Paul Joyce,
Jr. said he was not comfortable
with the idea of the complaint pro
cess because the amendment

didn't give enough information on
how the complaints would affect
an accused student.
"We don't want to make any
mistakes," Joyce said.
The Senate also approved a bill
titled "Senate Accountability,"
which acknowledges student dis
content with the ASSU and tries
to address some student concerns.
The main provision of the bill
allocates funds to run weekly
advertisements in The Daily to
inform students about upcoming
bills, speakers, important dates,
bills passed at the last meeting and
the names of current senators and
other students involved with the
ASSU.
At the beginning of the meet
ing, Senate Chair Ron Brown
informed the Senate that six sena
tors have been placed on "displace
ment" — the first step in the pro
cess of being removed from their
seats. Undergraduate senator
Rafe Sagarin and graduate sena
tors Amy Zegart, Leonard Lopez,
Jaime Fernandez, Robin Ghio and
Colin Hampson have all been
absent at the past three meetings,
which is grounds to begin dis
missal procedures.
In other news, the Memorial
Auditorium sound system bill was
tabled until the next meeting on
Nov. 17. Graduate senator San
ford Dickert said the bill was not
presented before the senate
because of disagreements over cost
recovery plans and ongoing discus
sions with University Events and
Services.
