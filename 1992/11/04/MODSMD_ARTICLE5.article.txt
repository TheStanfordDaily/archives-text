# Radiology Prof. cleared of gender discrimination charges
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
A five-month investigation has un
earthed no evidence of gender discrimina
tion by the chair of Stanford Medical
School's Radiology Department, according
to a report released yesterday.
In May, Dr. Gary Glazer was singled out
in a letter alleging widespread discrimina
tion, harassment and intimidation within
his department.
While some of the 61 people interviewed
criticized Glazer's management style and
"people skills," the report said, "the com
mittee found no evidence through direct
testimony and review of documents to sup
port any of the allegations."
Sparked by charges in a May 26 letter
written by Dr. Margaret Billingham, direc
tor of the Women in Medicine and the Med
ical Sciences program, the two-man, three
woman committee's investigation ended
last month.

I was very confident that
gender discrimination does
not and has not existed in
our department.'
â€” Gary Glazer

"None of the women who spoke about
their situations with Dr. Billingham felt
they had charged Dr. Glazer with any dis
criminatory practice or sexism. They felt
the tone of Dr. Billingham's letter was ex
cessively harsh," the report said.
Billingham, who is out of the country and
unavailable for comment, said in a state
ment that she "felt it necessary to bring to
the attention of the Dean and the Women's
Steering Committee the complaints that
had been brought to my attention."
Dr. Robert Cutler, a Medical School dean

and member of the committee, called the alle
gations "hurtful" and said Billingham had
"perhaps dramatized them a bit in the letter."
But he added, "I believe that she was act
ing with the interests of women in her
heart."
Glazer, who denied the allegations when
Billingham's letter was leaked to the press
in June, said he was not surprised by the in
vestigation's outcome.
"I was very confident that gender dis
crimination does not and has not existed in
our department," he said, calling Radiology
a "very fair place."
After interviewing eight women in the
department, Billingham wrote, "In every
case, there was some gender discrimination
and in some cases harassment, intimidation
and abuse of power," according to the San
Jose Mercuiy News.
The letter also charged that women in
the department are subjected to sexist com
ments, have fewer research opportunities
than men, receive lower bonuses and are

given less money for attending professional
conferences.
In her letter, Billingham reportedly
blamed many of the problems on Glazer
without mentioning him by name.
For example, she wrote that "young
macho males" who relate their sexual fan
tasies about other women in front of young
female residents and interns are presum
ably following the role model of the chair
man.
Witnesses did tell the committee about
"two fellows who engaged in so-called lock
er room humor and 'macho' behavior." Res
idents and technicians who overheard re
marks about others were "uncomfortable,"
the report said.
Despite allegations that he took no ac
tion, department members testified that
Glazer received a memorandum on one inci
dent and "ascertained that the offending be
havior had ceased."
