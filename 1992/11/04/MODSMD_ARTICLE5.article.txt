# Radiology Prof. cleared of gender discrimination charges
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
A five-month investigation has un
earthed no evidence of gender discrimina
tion by the chair of Stanford Medical
School's Radiology Department, according
to a report released yesterday.
In May, Dr. Gary Glazer was singled out
in a letter alleging widespread discrimina
tion, harassment and intimidation within
his department.
While some of the 61 people interviewed
criticized Glazer's management style and
"people skills," the report said, "the com
mittee found no evidence through direct
testimony and review of documents to sup
port any of the allegations."
Sparked by charges in a May 26 letter
written by Dr. Margaret Billingham, direc
tor of the Women in Medicine and the Med
ical Sciences program, the two-man, three
woman committee's investigation ended
last month.

I was very confident that
gender discrimination does
not and has not existed in
our department.'
— Gary Glazer

"None of the women who spoke about
their situations with Dr. Billingham felt
they had charged Dr. Glazer with any dis
criminatory practice or sexism. They felt
the tone of Dr. Billingham's letter was ex
cessively harsh," the report said.
Billingham, who is out of the country and
unavailable for comment, said in a state
ment that she "felt it necessary to bring to
the attention of the Dean and the Women's
Steering Committee the complaints that
had been brought to my attention."
Dr. Robert Cutler, a Medical School dean

and member of the committee, called the alle
gations "hurtful" and said Billingham had
"perhaps dramatized them a bit in the letter."
But he added, "I believe that she was act
ing with the interests of women in her
heart."
Glazer, who denied the allegations when
Billingham's letter was leaked to the press
in June, said he was not surprised by the in
vestigation's outcome.
"I was very confident that gender dis
crimination does not and has not existed in
our department," he said, calling Radiology
a "very fair place."
After interviewing eight women in the
department, Billingham wrote, "In every
case, there was some gender discrimination
and in some cases harassment, intimidation
and abuse of power," according to the San
Jose Mercuiy News.
The letter also charged that women in
the department are subjected to sexist com
ments, have fewer research opportunities
than men, receive lower bonuses and are

given less money for attending professional
conferences.
In her letter, Billingham reportedly
blamed many of the problems on Glazer
without mentioning him by name.
For example, she wrote that "young
macho males" who relate their sexual fan
tasies about other women in front of young
female residents and interns are presum
ably following the role model of the chair
man.
Witnesses did tell the committee about
"two fellows who engaged in so-called lock
er room humor and 'macho' behavior." Res
idents and technicians who overheard re
marks about others were "uncomfortable,"
the report said.
Despite allegations that he took no ac
tion, department members testified that
Glazer received a memorandum on one inci
dent and "ascertained that the offending be
havior had ceased."
Witnesses, asked whether they
believed that the men were follow
ing the chairman's role model
"found the charges to be prepos
terous," the report said. "Dr. Glaz
er's behavior was described as the
model of professional decorum in
this regard."
Billingham also wrote that
Glazer "is totally focused on his
own interests and goals to put
himself on the map at all costs,
including overriding and ignoring
all the rules of fairness, decency,
responsibility to his staff, honesty
and gender discrimination to meet
his own ends."
But in her statement she said
the report indicated that "the com
plaints were not gender related but
rather due to the many changes
resulting from the reorganization
of the Department of Radiology
affecting men as well as women,
and particularly the junior faculty."
Medical School Dean David
Korn said that while he is "sure
Dr. Billingham was acting in good
faith," dissatisfaction seemed to be

caused by changes within the
department rather than discrimi
nation.
"There are always groups that
resist change," he said. "Every
time there is some stress, you can't
assume it's due to gender and eth
nicity."
The 10-page summary of the
report made public by Korn con
cluded that Glazer "was a fair and
thoughtful chairman who was
keenly interested in the welfare of
his faculty," and praised him for
his leadership.
Some members of the faculty
have found changes in perfor
mance expectations "hostile and
threatening," it said, and "have
had difficulty adjusting to the new
directions espoused by Dr. Glazer."
Glazer, Korn and Cutler said
they believe the investigation's
results reflect the true situation
within the department.
Although the investigation was
"a bit intimidating" for some peo
ple, Cutler said the committee "did
not find that anybody was reti
cent."
The issue of whether women
felt free to speak out came up often
during the committee's 19 meet
ings, he added.

With "three senior and tough
minded women" on the commit
tee, Korn said he is confident
about the results. "I have to
assume they felt free to speak to
the committee," he said.
And Glazer agreed. "There are
always individuals who will doubt
the credibility of the report," he
said, but there is "no reason to
believe Ithe committee) had an
agenda other than finding the
truth."
While the committee findings
clear him, Glazer said the charges
have taken their toll nonetheless.
"One unfortunate aspect of
these events was the relatively
long period of time during which
our department could not discuss
these issues to ensure an impartial
investigation," he said.
"Many women as well as men
were placed in an uncomfortable
position because of these unfound
ed allegations," he said, calling the
situation a "trial via the media."
"As an individual, I have known
since the publication of the letter
that the allegations were unfound
ed, and so I was very disappointed
by the breach of due process and
disregard for the consequences of
the deliberate leak."

But Glazer added that both he
and the department are "resilient"
and will recover from the problems
generated by the allegations.
According to Korn, he has been
meeting with Glazer to discuss the
healing process and is also in the
process of appointing a new direc
tor of the Women in Medicine and
Medical Sciences program.
Billingham had decided to
resign the position "a while ago,"
Korn said, a decision unrelated to
her letter.
The allegations involving Glaz
er and the Radiology Department
are just the latest in a series of sex
ism charges in the Medical School.
Neurosurgery Prof. Frances
Conley drew national attention
when she resigned in June 1991
citing "pervasive sexism" in the
school. She later returned, saying
the University had moved to
address her concerns. The chair
man she had criticized was demot
ed in February.
Just weeks after Conley's resig
nation, then-University President
Donald Kennedy brought sexual
harassment charges against Prof.
Mark Perlroth. The case was
resolved in February, but the
results were not made public.

blamed many of the problems on Glazer
without mentioning him by name.
For example, she wrote that "young
macho males" who relate their sexual fan
tasies about other women in front of young
female residents and interns are presum
ably following the role model of the chair
man.
Witnesses did tell the committee about
"two fellows who engaged in so-called lock
er room humor and 'macho' behavior." Res
idents and technicians who overheard re
marks about others were "uncomfortable,"
the report said.
Despite allegations that he took no ac
tion, department members testified that
Glazer received a memorandum on one inci
dent and "ascertained that the offending be
havior had ceased."
Witnesses, asked whether they
believed that the men were follow
ing the chairman's role model
"found the charges to be prepos
terous," the report said. "Dr. Glaz
er's behavior was described as the
model of professional decorum in
this regard."
Billingham also wrote that
Glazer "is totally focused on his
own interests and goals to put
himself on the map at all costs,
including overriding and ignoring
all the rules of fairness, decency,
responsibility to his staff, honesty
and gender discrimination to meet
his own ends."
But in her statement she said
the report indicated that "the com
plaints were not gender related but
rather due to the many changes
resulting from the reorganization
of the Department of Radiology
affecting men as well as women,
and particularly the junior faculty."
Medical School Dean David
Korn said that while he is "sure
Dr. Billingham was acting in good
faith," dissatisfaction seemed to be

caused by changes within the
department rather than discrimi
nation.
"There are always groups that
resist change," he said. "Every
time there is some stress, you can't
assume it's due to gender and eth
nicity."
The 10-page summary of the
report made public by Korn con
cluded that Glazer "was a fair and
thoughtful chairman who was
keenly interested in the welfare of
his faculty," and praised him for
his leadership.
Some members of the faculty
have found changes in perfor
mance expectations "hostile and
threatening," it said, and "have
had difficulty adjusting to the new
directions espoused by Dr. Glazer."
Glazer, Korn and Cutler said
they believe the investigation's
results reflect the true situation
within the department.
Although the investigation was
"a bit intimidating" for some peo
ple, Cutler said the committee "did
not find that anybody was reti
cent."
The issue of whether women
felt free to speak out came up often
during the committee's 19 meet
ings, he added.

With "three senior and tough
minded women" on the commit
tee, Korn said he is confident
about the results. "I have to
assume they felt free to speak to
the committee," he said.
And Glazer agreed. "There are
always individuals who will doubt
the credibility of the report," he
said, but there is "no reason to
believe Ithe committee) had an
agenda other than finding the
truth."
While the committee findings
clear him, Glazer said the charges
have taken their toll nonetheless.
"One unfortunate aspect of
these events was the relatively
long period of time during which
our department could not discuss
these issues to ensure an impartial
investigation," he said.
"Many women as well as men
were placed in an uncomfortable
position because of these unfound
ed allegations," he said, calling the
situation a "trial via the media."
"As an individual, I have known
since the publication of the letter
that the allegations were unfound
ed, and so I was very disappointed
by the breach of due process and
disregard for the consequences of
the deliberate leak."

But Glazer added that both he
and the department are "resilient"
and will recover from the problems
generated by the allegations.
According to Korn, he has been
meeting with Glazer to discuss the
healing process and is also in the
process of appointing a new direc
tor of the Women in Medicine and
Medical Sciences program.
Billingham had decided to
resign the position "a while ago,"
Korn said, a decision unrelated to
her letter.
The allegations involving Glaz
er and the Radiology Department
are just the latest in a series of sex
ism charges in the Medical School.
Neurosurgery Prof. Frances
Conley drew national attention
when she resigned in June 1991
citing "pervasive sexism" in the
school. She later returned, saying
the University had moved to
address her concerns. The chair
man she had criticized was demot
ed in February.
Just weeks after Conley's resig
nation, then-University President
Donald Kennedy brought sexual
harassment charges against Prof.
Mark Perlroth. The case was
resolved in February, but the
results were not made public.
A five-month investigation has un
earthed no evidence of gender discrimina
tion by the chair of Stanford Medical
School's Radiology Department, according
to a report released yesterday.
In May, Dr. Gary Glazer was singled out
in a letter alleging widespread discrimina
tion, harassment and intimidation within
his department.
While some of the 61 people interviewed
criticized Glazer's management style and
"people skills," the report said, "the com
mittee found no evidence through direct
testimony and review of documents to sup
port any of the allegations."
Sparked by charges in a May 26 letter
written by Dr. Margaret Billingham, direc
tor of the Women in Medicine and the Med
ical Sciences program, the two-man, three
woman committee's investigation ended
last month.

I was very confident that
gender discrimination does
not and has not existed in
our department.'
— Gary Glazer

"None of the women who spoke about
their situations with Dr. Billingham felt
they had charged Dr. Glazer with any dis
criminatory practice or sexism. They felt
the tone of Dr. Billingham's letter was ex
cessively harsh," the report said.
Billingham, who is out of the country and
unavailable for comment, said in a state
ment that she "felt it necessary to bring to
the attention of the Dean and the Women's
Steering Committee the complaints that
had been brought to my attention."
Dr. Robert Cutler, a Medical School dean

and member of the committee, called the alle
gations "hurtful" and said Billingham had
"perhaps dramatized them a bit in the letter."
But he added, "I believe that she was act
ing with the interests of women in her
heart."
Glazer, who denied the allegations when
Billingham's letter was leaked to the press
in June, said he was not surprised by the in
vestigation's outcome.
"I was very confident that gender dis
crimination does not and has not existed in
our department," he said, calling Radiology
a "very fair place."
After interviewing eight women in the
department, Billingham wrote, "In every
case, there was some gender discrimination
and in some cases harassment, intimidation
and abuse of power," according to the San
Jose Mercuiy News.
The letter also charged that women in
the department are subjected to sexist com
ments, have fewer research opportunities
than men, receive lower bonuses and are

given less money for attending professional
conferences.
