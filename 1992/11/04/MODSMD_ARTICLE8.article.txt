# ELECTION 92
## Campus Demos celebrate wins 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
If they'd been a little less excited, you might think
they'd won the lottery.
Celebrating national and statewide Democratic
victories, the Stanford Democrats gathered in the
Coffee House for a victory party last night and talked
about the immense significance of the voting results.
"This is a watershed moment in American political
culture," said Deborah Castler, a senior and Area
Coordinator for the Stanford Democrats, with tears
of joy trickling down her cheeks. "I've been waiting
for this for four years. I've been waiting for this for 12
years. ... This is amazing."
"I've never been so goddamn happy in my life,"
echoed Nancy Luxon, Stanford Democrats' campaign
co-chair. "It's this incredible day. It just seems very,
very unreal."
In a Coffee House bedecked with red, white and
blue streamers and balloons, a crowd of about 70 —
mostly Democrats — watched the state-by-state
results on a big-screen TV, and cheered as Democrats
Bill Clinton, Anna Eshoo, Diane Feinstein and Bar
bara Boxer were projected as winners by NBC.
As the initial euphoria wore off, many students in
attendance expressed hope for the future.
"Clinton can celebrate for a whole day or two, but
he's got to realize the Democrats control the White
House [and] both houses of Congress and it's their
turn to run the country," said Mike Zwibelman, co
president of the Stanford Democrats.
Zwibelman said he expected Clinton to propose at
least three major programs early in his administra
tion: a jobs bill, an education package including
increased financial aid for college students, and a
health-care reform bill.
Luxon said she hopes to see a Freedom of Choice
Act passed in Clinton's first 100 days as president.
Senior Paul Lorimer said he had high hopes for
the Democratic victory as well. "My hope is that he
can stimulate the economy," Lorimer said, adding

that he would also like to see Clinton undertake wel
fare reform.
Excitement centered not only on Clinton, but on
California's election of two female Democratic sena
tors, Boxer and Feinstein.
"It will be a more representative Senate. We are 51
percent of the population, we deserve to be seen,"
exuded junior Samantha Halem.
The Coffee House was not the only site of campus
celebration. Some residences hosted election parties,
including the American Studies House. Amid bal
loons, streamers and champagne, residents' reactions
ranged from ebullience to cynicism.
"I'm incredibly excited," said senior Ginger Cook
while waving an American flag and cheering the
Democrats' victory speeches.
Other students were not as enthusiastic. Senior

Dan Sullivan voted for Clinton but said he is "very
skeptical" about the Democrat's chances for success.
Still, most who voted for Clinton — especially at
the Coffee House — seemed ecstatic.
At the Stanford Democrats' party, if joy filled the
room when Clinton clinched the race, excitement
soared to a World Series-like pitch when the
Arkansas governor gave his acceptance speech.
And through cheers and tears, Castler expressed
the mix of joy and disbelief that pervaded the victory
celebration.
"This is amazing. This is Reaganomics ending,"
she said. "Although I've been working for this for
four months, it wasn't until tonight that it seemed
real. ... I think it sets an exciting tone of change."
