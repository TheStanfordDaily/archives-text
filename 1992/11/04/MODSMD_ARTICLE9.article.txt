# Vow to redefine
## Republicans talk change 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Stanford Republicans maintained a generally low
profile yesterday, expressing disappointment at GOP
defeats but vowing to revitalize and redefine the
party's direction.
The College Republicans, Stanford's Republican
organization, had originally planned to watch election
returns at congressional candidate Tom Huening's
headquarters in Palo Alto. However, most members
decided yesterday not to attend the Huening party.
John Griggs, the College Republicans' chief of staff,
said the decision not to go to the Huening headquar
ters was "made by individuals." The group's absence
was "attributable to various things," and not solely to
Republican losses, Griggs said.
"I'm disappointed Bush lost," Griggs said. "I'm not
looking forward to the Clinton presidency."
Despite the loss, Griggs said College Republicans
will try to increase its visibility on campus.
"We want to start a renewed recruitment drive," he
said. "We want to act as a voice for all types of Repub
licans â€” conservative, moderate, and liberal."
College Republican Noel Manalo said the group's
immediate goal was to "be an alternative voice on cam
pus." He said College Republicans would continue to
"sponsor speakers (and) write letters to the editor."
Manalo cited Bush's failure to articulate a vision for
the GOP as a reason for the President's defeat. He said
he believes the loss will allow Republicans to "redefine
what we stand for," particularly on social issues.
But while Manalo downplayed the influence of the
religious right on the party's direction, Griggs said the
GOP's conservative swing in the 1992 campaign was a
significant factor in yesterday's Republican failures.
"The Republican Party has to move to the center of
the political spectrum, especially on abortion," he said.
Both Griggs and Manalo named Jack Kemp, Bush's
head of the Department of Housing and Urban Devel
opment, as one of the party's best hopes for 1996.
"He has the potential to heal the wounds of this
party," Griggs said.
