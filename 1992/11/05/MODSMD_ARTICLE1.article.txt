Three out of every four voters on the
Stanford campus cast their ballots for
Gov. Bill Clinton on Tuesday, and more
than 50 percent of students backed De
mocratic candidates for state and local
offices.
Receiving particularly strong support
were California's two female Democratic
Senate candidates, who each captured
more than 80 percent of the campus vote.
According to results released by the
Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters
yesterday, 75.4 percent of voters in the

15 campus precincts supported Clinton.
President Bush received 14 percent and
independent candidate Ross Perot got
9.6 percent.
Nationally, the race was much narrow
er, with Clinton garnering only 5 percent
more of the popular vote than Bush. With
99 percent of precincts reporting nation
wide, Clinton stood at 43 percent, Bush at
38 percent and Perot at 19 percent.
Clinton'« showing on campus mir
rors national trends among young vot
ers. According to the massive Voter Re
search and Surveys exit poll, the
Arkansas governor had a 14-point edge"
with 18-24 year-old voters. He also

picked up 48 percent of first-time voters,
compared to 30 percent for Bush.
"This completely reverses the Reagan-
Bush gains of the last 12 years with
younger voters," said Republican pollster
Bill Mclnturff. He attributed the fallofTto
"the whole image of the Republican
Party, the way the convention played, the
whole sense of status quo versus change."
Congresswoman Barbara Boxer, pre
vailing in a tight race over Republican
Bruce Herschensohn for the state's six
year Senate seat, received 81.5 percent
of the Stanford vote to her rival's 14.2
