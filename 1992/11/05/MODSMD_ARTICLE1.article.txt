Three out of every four voters on the

15 campus precincts supported Clinton.
President Bush received 14 percent and
independent candidate Ross Perot got
9.6 percent.
Nationally, the race was much narrow
er, with Clinton garnering only 5 percent
more of the popular vote than Bush. With
99 percent of precincts reporting nation
wide, Clinton stood at 43 percent, Bush at
38 percent and Perot at 19 percent.
Clinton'« showing on campus mir
rors national trends among young vot
ers. According to the massive Voter Re
search and Surveys exit poll, the
Arkansas governor had a 14-point edge"
with 18-24 year-old voters. He also

picked up 48 percent of first-time voters,
compared to 30 percent for Bush.
"This completely reverses the Reagan-
Bush gains of the last 12 years with
younger voters," said Republican pollster
Bill Mclnturff. He attributed the fallofTto
"the whole image of the Republican
Party, the way the convention played, the
whole sense of status quo versus change."
Congresswoman Barbara Boxer, pre

Bruce Herschensohn for the state's six

Seymour, who was appointed
to fill the seat vacated by Gov.

tight race into a wide margin of
victory, besting her rival 57 per
cent to 38.5 percent.
Byron Sher, a Stanford emeri
tus professor of law, had an easy
time securing a seventh term in
the state Assembly. On campus he
received 82.8 percent of the vote,
and 63.2 percent districtwide.

race was only local contest in
which Stanford voters bucked
community trends. Stanford vot
ers supported Frank Trinkle, a
Democrat, over Republican
incumbent Becky Morgan by a

margin of 53 percent to 42 per
cent, but Morgan won the contest
with the support of 64 percent of
the total electorate.
Voters on campus favored the
right-to-die proposition and
opposed congressional term limits

with dignity" measure, received
62.5 percent approval on campus

"the whole image of the Republican
Party, the way the convention played, the
whole sense of status quo versus change."

percent.
Dianne Feinstein, running for
the two-year seat, got 82.1 per
cent of the campus vote. Her
opponent, Republican Sen. John
Seymour, was backed by only 15.2
percent.
Statewide, however, the races
were much tighter. Boxer had to
wait until late Tuesday night
before claiming victory over Her
schensohn, who refused to con
cede until yesterday. Final state
vote tallies gave her 48 percent to
his 43 percent.
Seymour, who was appointed
to fill the seat vacated by Gov.
Pete Wilson in 1990, could only
muster 37 percent of the vote
statewide.
The hotly contested 14 th Con

gressional District seat, vied for
by moderate San Mateo County
Supervisors Anna Eshoo and Tom
Huening, proved not be a contest
for Stanford voters. Eshoo, a
Democrat, ran away with 72.5
percent of the vote while Huening
received only 24.4 percent.
Districtwide, Eshoo turned
what had been predicted to be a
tight race into a wide margin of
victory, besting her rival 57 per
cent to 38.5 percent.
Byron Sher, a Stanford emeri
tus professor of law, had an easy
time securing a seventh term in
the state Assembly. On campus he
received 82.8 percent of the vote,
and 63.2 percent districtwide.
The 11th district State Senate
race was only local contest in
which Stanford voters bucked
community trends. Stanford vot
ers supported Frank Trinkle, a
Democrat, over Republican
incumbent Becky Morgan by a

margin of 53 percent to 42 per
cent, but Morgan won the contest
with the support of 64 percent of
the total electorate.
Voters on campus favored the
right-to-die proposition and
opposed congressional term limits
as well as overwhelmingly reject
ing Gov. Wilson's welfare reform
plan.
Proposition 161, the "death
with dignity" measure, received
62.5 percent approval on campus
but only 46 percent in the state.
Proposition 164, the term limit
measure, received 63 percent
approval statewide, but did not
fare as well on the Farm, where
57.6 percent voted to reject it.
Proposition 165 was opposed
by 54 percent of the state's voters.
On campus, 71.7 percent voted
against it.
