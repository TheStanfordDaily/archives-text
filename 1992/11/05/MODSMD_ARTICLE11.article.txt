GOP gains in legislatures
Republicans made gains, but Democrats main
tained supremacy in races Tuesday for the nation's
state legislatures, where at least one of every four
faces will be new come January.
Incumbents who made it to Tuesday's ballot
didn't fare as badly as some had feared, however; at
least nine of every 10 won. As in congressional
races, the "throw the bums out" wave crested ear
lier, washing out most of its victims before the gen
eral election.
Women and minorities were poised to fill a
growing number of the nation's nearly 7,500 leg
islative seats. Hispanics claimed a record number
of them.
As returns from about 6,300 races continued to
be tallied yesterday, the GOP leaned toward a net
gain of at least six of the nation's 99 legislative
chambers. Democrats appeared headed toward a
net loss of four in the number of states where they
control both houses.
Democrats went into the elections controlling
70 chambers. Democrats controlled both houses in
29 states, the GOP in six and 14 states were split.
Nebraska's legislature is unicameral and nominal
ly non-partisan.
Edelweiss 6-5000
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A lovesick college stu
dent in Austria ran up a $30,000 telephone bill

making more than 10,000 harassing telephone calls
to Harvard University students, authorities said.
The student, whose name was not revealed, called
at random an average of more than 10 Harvard stu
dents a day over the last three years. In some cases,
he called the same student 50 times in one day.
"It's hard to understand how he could do it,"
Harvard Police Chief Paul E. Johnson said of all
the telephone calls. "But he said he has no close
friends, no hobbies and nothing else to do, so he
spent his time on the phone."
Johnson said it may not be possible to charge
the Austrian with anything because of internation
al legal bureaucracy.
He said no harassing calls had been reported
since detectives talked last week with the student
and the student's father, recommending that the
student get therapy.
Bozo knows Bozo
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Bozo the clown has
some advice for Bill Clinton, who President Bush
dubbed a latter-day "Bozo" during the campaign:
Just keep laughing.
Larry Harmon, who played Bozo on television,
sent Clinton a telegram yesterday congratulating
him for winning the presidential election.
"I feel it's an honor to have been so recognized
and wish you all the best in the days to come,"
wrote Harmon, who noted he'd been Bozo for 43
years, since Clinton was 3.
