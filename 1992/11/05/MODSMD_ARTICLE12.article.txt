LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -
Bill Clinton discussed his plans
for America's economic future
yesterday, and appealed to for
eign leaders to cooperate with
George Bush during the presi
dent's final two months in office.
Clinton said the "hard and
vital task" of reviving the U.S.
economy would be his top
domestic priority. "The task has
already begun," the president
elect declared on the first day
alter his electoral victory.
"It will not be easy but we will
spare no effort to restore jobs,
growth and income to the Amer

ican people," Clinton said.
The Democrat sought to quiet
jittery financial markets with a
promise that "we understand
the need to pursue stability even
as we pursue new growth." He
said his changes "will strengthen
America's market systems, not
weaken them."
Clinton also reassured world
leaders that there would be a
smooth transition of power and
no disruption of American for
eign policy.
"America has only one presi
dent at a time," Clinton said,
speaking outside the Arkansas

governor s mansion.
"The greatest mistake any
adversary could make would be
to doubt America's resolve dur
ing this transition."
In the realm of foreign affairs,
Clinton said he wanted to make
progress in global trade talks,
assist Russia and other former
Soviet republics in their transi
tion to democracy and deliver aid
to Somalia's famine victims.
Clinton also said he would
continue Bush's effort to broker
Middle East peace and negotiate
a START II arms treaty with
Russia.
