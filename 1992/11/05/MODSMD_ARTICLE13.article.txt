SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegov
ina (AP) — Serbian forces
attacked more towns in the dwin
dling government-held territory
north of Sarajevo yesterday as
refugees streamed out of the area.
Sarajevo's airport, the Bosnian
capital's lifeline to the outside
world, was caught in a brief fire
fight, apparently between govern
ment and Serb forces, and a French
U.N. peacekeeper was wounded.
A U.S. flight crew was caught
in crossfire at the airport for 40
minutes.
Bosnian government radio
reported heavy fighting around
Olovo, 25 miles northeast of Sara
jevo, Maglaj to the northwest and
Gradacac further north.
If Olovo falls, government
forces would be isolated further

north around Tuzla, an industrial
city 45 miles northeast of Saraje
vo that is among about a half
dozen cities and towns still held
by the Muslim-led Bosnian gov
ernment.
In Sarajevo, AP photographer
Morten Hvaal at the airport said a
French soldier outside the termi
nal was hit in the thigh by a bul
let, treated behind sandbags and
taken by armored vehicle to U.N.
headquarters.
Two U.N. relief flights landed
as fighting began. The crew of an
American C-130 cargo plane
skipped for cover behind sandbags
until the fighting subsided, then
flew off.
At least 14,000 people have
been killed and more than 1 mil
lion left homeless since the Bosni

an civil war started last
after the former Yugoslav repub
lic declared independence.
Jajce, in western Bosnia, fell
last week. Hundreds of
fleeing the town were refused
refuge in Croatia despite pleas
from the U.N. High Commission*
er for Refugees. Croatian Presi-I
dent Franjo Tudjman said his
country's resources were
stretched too far.
Croat authorities reportedly
were pressuring refugees to joirf
the Croat militia. Croatian radio
in Zagreb quoted Bruno Stojic;
defense chief of the Croats' selft
proclaimed canton of Herzeg-C
Bosna, as demanding that all con-*
scripts among refugees report
immediately to military barracks'
or be picked up by military police
