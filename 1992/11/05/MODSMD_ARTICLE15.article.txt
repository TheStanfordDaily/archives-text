## White Scholarships 
### 
Though it sounds weird,
UC-Berkeley's poor-white
kids grant still plays fair.

UC-BERKELEY HAS decid
ed to accept a $513,000
bequest from Marguerite
Hornbeck for Boalt Hall law stu
dents. This in itself is nothing spe
cial. The fact that the money has
been earmarked for "very poor,
American, Caucasian academic
scholars" sets these funds apart
and raises a multitude of issues.
The idea of grants and scholar
ships, federal or otherwise, for
minority students is an accepted
tradition.
In fact, the concept has so many
supporters, that when the Depart
ment of Education tried to declare
most race-specific scholarships
illegal two years ago, a volley of
disapproval prompted the retrac
tion of the statement, sending the
department back to the policy
drawing board.
Minority scholarships are often
seen as a reparation for past his
torical hardships that still effect
certain groups. Inherent in the
rationale behind the scholarships
is that recipients have suffered
primarily for their minority sta
tus.
Because white students don't
normally fit into the need equa
tion outlined above, is it morally
justifiable to grant them special
funding based on race? In light of
the purpose of Hornbeck's grant
— to offset economic hardship
among white students — the Uni
versity of California regents justly
answered yes.
The regents argue that as long
as enough unrestricted student
aid exists to equalize the advan
tages that Hornbeck's donation
might give underprivileged white
students, nothing is wrong with
the race-specific scholarship.
Much like grants allocated to

minorities, the scholarship is set
up for members of a specific hard
ship group.
The operative word here is
"hardship." For a student coming
from the poor coal mining towns
of West Virginia, or the economi
cally retarded hills of Kentucky,
being white isn't a valid credit on
the university bill. Their need for
help is as real as any other minor
ity group.
A poor white student's receipt
of this scholarship in no way
affects his/her admittance to
Boalt. Instead, it lends a helping
hand without hindering other's
chances to receive financial aid or
admittance to the school.
Still, there is a strange prece
dent associated with allowing the
scholarship to be exclusive to
whites. This time there happens
to be an acceptable stipulation:
poverty. Next time being white
may be the only stipulation.
At the moment there is a fine
line drawn by the Civil Rights Acts
of the 19605. Minorities have a
history of racially based disadvan
tages. White students can trace
hardship to many factors, but not
race. The measuring sticks must
therefore be different.
While it is plausible for a pri
vate citizen to make a grant like
the Boalt scholarship, cautious
action needs to be taken to deter
mine for how far we allow race to
be used as a criteria.
Allowing scholarships to target
white students grants racist ten
dencies — a prime factor in the
establishment of minority scholar
ships in the first place — free
reign.
The future ramifications of the
regents' ruling make it as disturb
ing as it is understandable. The
decision to allow race-specific
scholarships for whites may lead
to deeper, more troublesome ques
tions in the future. Banning such
scholarships, however, would be
an intolerable limitation of the
rights of benefactors to target
recipients.
