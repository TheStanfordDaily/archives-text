## Church-step sightseeing 
### 
SINCE I HAVE BEEN DUBBED BY
the editors of The Daily as "poet
laureate of the Phi Delt house," I
will use this space to finally put down in
words my summer experience, which
crossed poetry with the gritty side of
New York City that I love and fear so
intensely.
In the spring of last year, Stanford
accepted my proposal for a Golden Grant,
which would finance my project to spend
much of the summer in New York City
investigating and articulating, through
poetry, the urban conflict between the
world of the church and that of skid row.
After eight years spent in the plush
suburb of Greenwich, Connecticut, each
Sunday as an acolyte in my Episcopalian
church, I decided that now it was finally
time to work out the feelings of guilt and
confusion I experienced as a boy — and
continue to feel — praying for heaven
with the hell of the streets only 50 min
utes from my home.
I wondered how Christian churches
and cathedrals could rise above streets
filled with people left to wander without
food or shelter. And I thought I could
channel my guilt and confusion into
poems that would address the conflict
located on the church steps — at the top
of which strides the polished Sunday
church-goer, and at the bottom of which
lies the homeless woman with a tin can

and her own slurred gospels.
Thus began my summer full of mis
sions to Harlem and the Port Authority
with New York City Relief; a "midnight
run" with St. Thomas' to visit the home
less in Central Park; a night spent with
12 vagrants in the cot-filled foyer of St.
Bartholomew's; a program to feed the
immobile AIDS victims in boarding
houses of the upper west side and days
and nights spent just wandering on my
own without any direction or plan what
soever.
In the beginning of the project, howev
er, these experiences that I thought
would help to channel my guilt and con
fusion seemed to intensify such feelings
as well. Who was I to waltz into this
urban hell for the day or night, and try to
write about it — between the comforts of
a full meal and a full night of sleep in a
bed of my own?
Wasn't it invalid, presumptuous and
artificial of me to try to mediate between
the church and the streets? I couldn't
help but think so at times. But I also
came to realize that I didn't set out upon
this project as a social worker, that my
guilt and confusion should be my drive
and not my growing burden.
So I wrote, with the faith that it would
at least help me better understand my
own conflict, and perhaps someone else
in my circle of family and friends who
might share similar feelings.

With weekly exposure to the Grand
Central prophets, cardboard homes, dot
ted forearms, urine-stained sidewalks
and families wrapped in garbage bags, I
began to accept the fact that I shouldn't
feel remorse for trying to access another
world and the minds of its lost citizens.
I now belong to a world of my own cre
ation, the world of the city church steps.
But between blank faces and blank pages,
I couldn't help but witness the stumble of
my own hopes and beliefs. While ques
tioning others' spirituality, I couldn't
help questioning my own.
I was fortunate to have my stumble
grounded in the world of the imagination
and not reality. I could have left the city
whenever I wanted. But when one of the
members of New York City Relief
described the work we did with the home
less as "fence ministry," I became
increasingly aware of the need for work
inside of myself.

Brad Winters has just resigned as poet
laureate of the Phi Delt House; Mark
Belanger will take over for the remainder
of the year. Please come to his inaugura
tion Sunday at dawn in the house's hack
yard.
