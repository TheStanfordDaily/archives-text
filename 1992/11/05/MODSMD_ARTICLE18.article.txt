Americans can be as un-American as they want to be

BRETT ROGER'S tunnel-visioned
imagery of the lofty American cul
ture in the Oct. 19 Daily complete
ly disenchants my conception of the
reputed open-mindedness of this cam
pus. His assertion that we are all funda
mentally Americans in terms of culture
beats the importance and recognition of
minority contributions into a colorless,
somber paste.
For me, America theoretically stands
for many ideals that I clench fiercely
within my soul. The primary assump
tions of equality, total freedom from
oppression, the ability to speak, assem
ble and petition the government without
retribution are truly noble goals. While
we as a collective people have come
nowhere close to recognizing any one of
these visions in full, I believe that we are
at least moving in positive steps.

Additionally, certain aspects of Ameri
can culture suggest I realize an alle
giance to this country. The protests that
are übiquitous at almost every college
campus in the country make me proud to
be a part of the greater consciousness of
America. And who can discount the fan
tastic works of John Steinbeck and the
myriads of singularly American writers?
These are eclectic features of the
American culture with which every per
son — white, black, Asian, Latino —
should feel proud to be associated.
American culture gives people who don't
associate themselves with another her
itage the opportunity to be proud of a
culture, if they so select.
Not wanting to be associated with
anything American is also perfectly
acceptable, no matter what some Daily
columnist blowing a McCarthyist smog

asserts.
After all, look at how our country has
grown. Exploitation of Africans as sub
humans; genocide of native Americans
masked as a God-given right; the intern
ment of innocent Japanese; and the
xenophobic purgation of foreigners that
still exists today, among others.
The fact that there historically has
been little to no recognition of non-white
infusions of American culture infuriates
me. Of all the tremendous artistic con
tributions from the early soul singers,
the incomparable Afro-Cuban and Latin
musicians and others, who has peaked
as a major cultural icon? Elvis, a bloat
ed, farcical singer who blatantly stole his
music from earlier black vocalists.
This issue of recognition in American
culture is improving, but minority cul
ture that is assimilated by mainstream

American culture still hardly receives
the recognition it properly deserves.
So if you would rather not be associ
ated with these atrocities of cultural
America, I understand completely. But
the beauty about living in America is
that who you are is an individual choice.
Just because my address is listed in San
Jose, Calif, does not mean that I am nec
essarily an American in any spiritual or
cultural sense.
There are positives and negatives
associated with all cultures, and
whichever culture and whatever set of
values I align myself with is completely
my own decision. Freedom of choice is
tantamount to me, and I hope that this
value someday becomes universal among
all of us.
