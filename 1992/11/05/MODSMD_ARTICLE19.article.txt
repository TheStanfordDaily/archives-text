# There's nothing shabby about Stat 60's planning
## 
### 
We were glad to read of The Daily's
concern for Stanford's reputation for aca
demic excellence in their Oct. 16 editorial,
"Keep Stanford Smart."
Unfortunately, the editorial staff
appears to be a victim of anti-intellectual
ism insofar as they have been either
unwilling or unable to assess Stanford's
academic health with any rigorous analy
sis of the facts. As members of the
Department of Statistics, we were
shocked at The Daily's assertion that
Statistics 60 is a course whose "quality
and content fluctuate wildly depending
on which quarter you take it."
They go on to opine that they "attribute
this to poor planning, rather than to late
breaking developments in statistics." The
same criticism might well be levelled at
The Daily itself as we are treated from day

to day to the uniformed, minority opinions
of the editorial board. We find The Daily's
pontifical tone unfortunate.
It is appropriate in view of The Daily's
unprovoked attack on the department that
we set the facts straight. Statistics 60 has
always been of great importance in our
departmental planning. It is a course
which is taken by a wide section of the stu
dent body, and it often comprises the only
statistics many students study in their
lives.
However, statistics pervades many
aspects of our society. Indeed, the front
page of The Daily, on the day they ran
the offending editorial, was full of bright
ly colored bar charts reflecting the cur
rent state of the Presidential race. With
out the field of statistics, these figures are
meaningless for predicting who would
win the presidency.
If The Daily had bothered to speak with
anybody in the department or carried out
even a brief investigation, they would have
found that the teaching of Statistics 60

has recently been given considerable atten
tion. One offshoot of the department's
planning has been the development of a
new course, Statistics 190, to meet the
needs of social science students, particular
ly those majoring in economics.
We in the department are vitally inter
ested in the teaching of elementary statis
tics courses. Statistics 60 is a traditional
ly difficult course to teach — its audience
is very diverse, coming from all parts of
humanities and sciences, and consequent
ly the numeracy skills of the students
taking the course also vary widely.
However, the content of the course has
remained more or less the same for several
years. The charge that the content of the
course "fluctuates wildly" from quarter to
quarter is simply wrong. As to the quality
of the course, the statistics department is
committed to making the course as suc
cessful as possible each time it is taught.
We realize that editorials merely
reflect the opinion of the editorial board,
but Stanford has a right to ask: Why

should we listen to such uninformed sen
timents?
