# A 						chance encounter behind post office

### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Zigging when they should have
zagged, a bicyclist and a
Rollerblader collided behind the
post office yesterday, sending one
of the participants to Stanford
Hospital.
The incident, which drew para
medics and police to the scene,
also attracted the attention of the
noontime White Plaza crowd.
While bicycle accidents around
campus are fairly common, bicy
cle-skater mishaps are rare.
"This was the first ( acci
dent between a bicyclist and an in
line skater) that I have heard of,"
said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
At about 1 p.m., a 19-year-old
male bicyclist collided with sopho
more John Moore in the crosswalk
behind the post office, Niemeyer
said.
"The bicyclist was heading to
the Law School, and they were
both going along pretty good,"
Niemeyer said. "Both zigged when
they should have zagged and

smashed into each other virtually
head-on."
"We were heading straight for
each other and swerved the same
way," Moore said. "His bike wheel
went between my legs and I broke
the reflector off the front."
The bicyclist, who was not iden
tified by police, suffered no in
juries.
But Moore was immobilized on
a backboard and transported to
Stanford Hospital because he com
plained of pain, Niemeyer said. He
was treated for minor abrasions
and eventually was released.
"I feel a lot better now," Moore
said last night. "I am pretty
bruised up. . . . They thought I
might have a spinal cord iryury be
cause my leg was numb, but I had
just hurt my nerves."
Neither Moore nor the bicyclist
were ticketed for the incident im
mediately, but Moore said the po
lice had not yet decided who was at
fault.
Moore said he was told police
might give one or both of them a
citation in four or five days after
completing official paperwork.
