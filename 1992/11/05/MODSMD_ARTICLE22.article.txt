## Golfers take sixth place in Pioneer: Daniels, Richards finish in top 16 Texas wins, Pac-10 foes ASU, UCLA, Oregon place ahead of Cardinal 
### Andy Collins Staff writer 
The Stanford women's golf team faced a
disagreeable course, unfriendly weather and
a disorganized Bruin Sports Information
Department this week, finishing in sixth
place overall at the UCLA Intercollegiate in
Temecula, Calif.
Mired in a dismal 12th place after their
first-round score of 323, the Cardinal women
rallied to fourth place Tuesday, shooting a
319. Unable to maintain the pace, the
linksters dropped into sixth by the end of
play Wednesday, shooting a third-round total
of 323.

It was not real 10ve1y.... The
fairways were very shaggy,
and the rough was extremely
deep ... basically PGA
depth.'
— Tim Baldwin

Junior Melinda Daniels led the Cardinal
golfers. Her third-round total of 234 gave her
a ninth-place finish in the individual compe
tition.
Fifth-year senior Martha Richards shot a
third round of 238 and finished in 16th place
overall.
Jamille Jose, the Cardinal's lone sophomore
starter, finished at 243 after shooting a 77 yes
terday. Freshmen Vicky Strada and Kathryn
Weber shot 250 and 261, respectively.
Head coach Tim Baldwin estimated that
the top five finishers of the match were
Texas, Arizona State, UCLA, Oregon and
Tulsa, but was unable to guess at final scores
for any squads.

According to Baldwin, the par-72 course,
located at the Menifee Lakes Country Club,
was "the toughest, meanest, most poorly-con
ditioned golf course" he could remember play
ing on.
"It was not real lovely," Baldwin said,
laughing wryly. "The fairways were very shag
gy, and the rough was extremely deep . . . basi
cally PGA depth."
Stanford was not the only team to suffer
because of the conditions, though, for Baldwin
observed that "nobody was tearing the course
up."
The weather during the tournament was
equally uncooperative. Baldwin said the high
winds on Tuesday "were knocking over 18-
wheelers on the freeway," and that the Stan
ford squad seemed "pretty spent" after a
grueling, blustery second round of competi
tion.
Despite the rough time at Temecula, Bald
win saw some points of light in the Cardinal
play. He enjoyed the look of top-three starters
Daniels, Richards and Jose. "The first three
positions are really solid," he proclaimed exu
berantly. However, he confessed, the team
needs five solid starters to compete with the
top squads.
"We need strong performances from Vicky
Strada, Kathryn Weber and Amy Lawrence,"
Baldwin said. Lawrence, a sophomore who
played in several tournaments for the Cardi
nal last year, has been unable to produce con
sistently this season and is number six on the
depth chart.
Unfazed by the general lack of production
in the number four and five spots at the UCLA
tournament, Baldwin felt assured of progress.
"It's just a matter of time before they come
around," Baldwin confided. "We need them
badly, but I'm confident that they'll come
through."
When questioned about the performance of
the two freshmen, Baldwin drolly observed
that Strada and Weber "have been baptized to
the difficulties of college golf."

All kidding aside, he admitted that the two
have performed well so far, but more consis
tency — not to mention lower scores — will be
needed in upcoming competitions.
The Cardinal has less than a week off; next
Wednesday the team travels to Hilton Head,
S.C., for the Golf World Invitational Tourna
ment, which runs from Nov. 13-15. This pres
tigious match will wind up the Cardinal fall
season, after which the linksters will have to
wait until March of next year to resume play.

positions are really solid," he proclaimed exu
berantly. However, he confessed, the team
needs five solid starters to compete with the
top squads.
"We need strong performances from Vicky
Strada, Kathryn Weber and Amy Lawrence,"
Baldwin said. Lawrence, a sophomore who
played in several tournaments for the Cardi
nal last year, has been unable to produce con
sistently this season and is number six on the
depth chart.
Unfazed by the general lack of production
in the number four and five spots at the UCLA
tournament, Baldwin felt assured of progress.
"It's just a matter of time before they come
around," Baldwin confided. "We need them
badly, but I'm confident that they'll come
through."
When questioned about the performance of
the two freshmen, Baldwin drolly observed
that Strada and Weber "have been baptized to
the difficulties of college golf."

All kidding aside, he admitted that the two
have performed well so far, but more consis
tency — not to mention lower scores — will be
needed in upcoming competitions.
The Cardinal has less than a week off; next
Wednesday the team travels to Hilton Head,
S.C., for the Golf World Invitational Tourna
ment, which runs from Nov. 13-15. This pres
tigious match will wind up the Cardinal fall
season, after which the linksters will have to
wait until March of next year to resume play.

The Cardinal women's golf team hopes to
utilize its young talent to support its top
three upperclass players. After next week's
Golf World Invitational at Hilton Head, S.C.,
the squad will have played all four of its
allowable fall tournaments and will not
return to action until next March.
