# 'Dream' matchup: no trouble raising 'Canes on West Coast
## 
### 
Miami-Washington, Washington-
Miami. Huskies-Hurricanes, 'Canes-
Dawgs. Number one-number two, num
ber two-number one (and even, in the
mind of one persistent voter from Alaba
ma, numbers two and three).
Round-and-round, up-and-down, back
and-forth, coast-to-coast, and from-here
to-eternity, we could have, for the third
consecutive season, two national champi
ons by the time the country wakes up on
Jan. 2. Then, as has become our favorite
'90's trend, a raging debate will be con
ducted well into 1993 over which team is
the best in all of collegiate football.
For the second straight year, the con
testants, while similar in accomplish
ment, would be, in the literal and figura
tive senses, worlds apart. The Washing
ton Huskies, they of the rain-slicked turf
hard by Puget Sound, will take their Ital
ian-government, I-don't-want-it-you
take-it, quarterback-by-committee sys
tem into a hypothetical battle with the
Miami Hurricanes, who, with Heisman
Trophy candidate Gino Toretta at the
controls, couldn't hear Puget from the
cozy confines of the Orange Bowl if they
tried on James Stockdale's hearing aid.
Without going into the hues through
which my face journeyed after our Cardi

nal's 41-7 loss to one of the parties In
question last Saturday, it must be said
that the Huskies and the Hurricanes
have possibly the most accurately
descriptive names in the nation.

Washington has thrust Steve Emtman
and Lincoln Kennedy, Ultra-Slimfast
candidates both, into national promi
nence in the last two years, while Hurri
cane Andrew beset Miami just in time for
fall practice to get underway last August.
Each team is riding the crest of an
incredible winning streak: Miami possess
es the longest run in the nation at 26
games, while Washington has taken 22
straight. Neither has lost since 1990,
when the 'Canes suffered a humiliating,
season-opening setback to top-ranked

Florida State and the Huskies dropped a
contest to an upstart UCLA squad.
In fact, the level of dominance with
which Washington has seized the Pacific
10 Conference's Rose Bowl berth, coupled
with Miami's ease at tearing through
their basketball-playing, big-buck-grub
bing Big East Conference affiliates, calls
to mind the 1991 NFL season, in which
the Washington Redskins and Buffalo
Bills ripped through the NFC and AFC,
respectively, on parallel fast tracks until
their ultimate clash in Super Bowl XXVI.
However, there is a key difference
between any professional — or, for that
matter, any sane — arrangement and the
one utilized by the NCAA to settle its
Division I-A football championship.
Without getting into the arguments for
or against a true playoff system, suffice it
to say that this "Holy American Coali
tion" — which, like its Roman Empire
counterpart, is neither holy nor truly
American nor a coalition — is the closest
we're going to get to one, given the money
structure of the game today.
Given the inherent limitations of this
newfangled alliance — namely, that a
Pac-10 or Big 10 team cannot compete in
a national championship unless the
respective champions happen to be

ranked No's. 1 and 2 — Washington will
not play Miami any time this season.
So this leaves hopefully-objective-but
woefully-biased college football observers
to decide for ourselves. If we concoct the
"Dream Game" in our minds, we must
assume that the game is being contested
on a neutral field, that the Hurricanes'
50-game (that's right, five-oh) Orange
Bowl string or Washington's Husky Sta
dium advantage would not come into play.
The questions certainly come to mind.
Would Washington's defense, which is
solid but not as dominant as last year's
unit, be able to stop Toretta and other
Miami weapons such as wide receiver
Lamar Thomas and running back
Stephen Maguire? Could the 'Canes use
their defensive quickness to harness the
likes of sophomore sensation Napoleon
Kaufman?
I've played it over and over in my mind,
and, like that never-ending Bobby Fisch
er-Boris Spassky World Championship of
Boredom contest, the result is a lot of
draws and some significant grey space. So
I have resorted to my instincts, coupled
with knowledge of the histories of the two
squads, to arrive at a decision: Miami.
Yes, I was awake last week, as I was the
previous two times that Washington merci

lessly slammed Stanford's collective ego into
the ground. But I'm not letting the school I
happen to attend bias my call in this case.
Face it, while it may look as though
Miami has paid Florida State's kicker to
keep its streak alive, both game-tying
field goal attempts were simply not going
to go in. Not against Miami.
See, Miami is beyond that "bad-boy"
phase that coach Dennis Erickson so despis
es. The Hurricanes have won five national
championships in the last nine years, a
dynasty that will not soon fade, while Wash
ington won its first (sort of) just last year.
Furthermore, the Huskies struggled
with USC and California earlier this sea
son, while the Hurricanes have only fal
tered against the Seminoles and Penn State
— both top-5 schools at the time — and Ari
zona, who Washington gets this weekend.
If it came down to an on-the-field tus
sle, Miami would find a way, like it
always seems to.
Since that game seems rather unlikely
to be played, though, what I say will have
to go.

Andy Eiser, one of the beleaguered Daily
sports editors, has seen the other shoe
drop. He thinks it's kind of funny thai
"taxed " and "spent" mean the same thing.

which Washington has seized the Pacific
10 Conference's Rose Bowl berth, coupled
with Miami's ease at tearing through
their basketball-playing, big-buck-grub
bing Big East Conference affiliates, calls
to mind the 1991 NFL season, in which
the Washington Redskins and Buffalo
Bills ripped through the NFC and AFC,
respectively, on parallel fast tracks until
their ultimate clash in Super Bowl XXVI.
However, there is a key difference
between any professional — or, for that
matter, any sane — arrangement and the
one utilized by the NCAA to settle its
Division I-A football championship.
Without getting into the arguments for
or against a true playoff system, suffice it
to say that this "Holy American Coali
tion" — which, like its Roman Empire
counterpart, is neither holy nor truly
American nor a coalition — is the closest
we're going to get to one, given the money
structure of the game today.
Given the inherent limitations of this
newfangled alliance — namely, that a
Pac-10 or Big 10 team cannot compete in
a national championship unless the
respective champions happen to be

ranked No's. 1 and 2 — Washington will
not play Miami any time this season.
So this leaves hopefully-objective-but
woefully-biased college football observers
to decide for ourselves. If we concoct the
"Dream Game" in our minds, we must
assume that the game is being contested
on a neutral field, that the Hurricanes'
50-game (that's right, five-oh) Orange
Bowl string or Washington's Husky Sta
dium advantage would not come into play.
The questions certainly come to mind.
Would Washington's defense, which is
solid but not as dominant as last year's
unit, be able to stop Toretta and other
Miami weapons such as wide receiver
Lamar Thomas and running back
Stephen Maguire? Could the 'Canes use
their defensive quickness to harness the
likes of sophomore sensation Napoleon
Kaufman?
I've played it over and over in my mind,
and, like that never-ending Bobby Fisch
er-Boris Spassky World Championship of
Boredom contest, the result is a lot of
draws and some significant grey space. So
I have resorted to my instincts, coupled
with knowledge of the histories of the two
squads, to arrive at a decision: Miami.
Yes, I was awake last week, as I was the
previous two times that Washington merci

lessly slammed Stanford's collective ego into
the ground. But I'm not letting the school I
happen to attend bias my call in this case.
Face it, while it may look as though
Miami has paid Florida State's kicker to
keep its streak alive, both game-tying
field goal attempts were simply not going
to go in. Not against Miami.
See, Miami is beyond that "bad-boy"
phase that coach Dennis Erickson so despis
es. The Hurricanes have won five national
championships in the last nine years, a
dynasty that will not soon fade, while Wash
ington won its first (sort of) just last year.
Furthermore, the Huskies struggled
with USC and California earlier this sea
son, while the Hurricanes have only fal
tered against the Seminoles and Penn State
— both top-5 schools at the time — and Ari
zona, who Washington gets this weekend.
If it came down to an on-the-field tus
sle, Miami would find a way, like it
always seems to.
Since that game seems rather unlikely
to be played, though, what I say will have
to go.

Andy Eiser, one of the beleaguered Daily
sports editors, has seen the other shoe
drop. He thinks it's kind of funny thai
"taxed " and "spent" mean the same thing.

Miami-Washington, Washington-
Miami. Huskies-Hurricanes, 'Canes-
Dawgs. Number one-number two, num
ber two-number one (and even, in the
mind of one persistent voter from Alaba
ma, numbers two and three).
Round-and-round, up-and-down, back
and-forth, coast-to-coast, and from-here
to-eternity, we could have, for the third
consecutive season, two national champi
ons by the time the country wakes up on
Jan. 2. Then, as has become our favorite
'90's trend, a raging debate will be con
ducted well into 1993 over which team is
the best in all of collegiate football.
For the second straight year, the con
testants, while similar in accomplish
ment, would be, in the literal and figura
tive senses, worlds apart. The Washing
ton Huskies, they of the rain-slicked turf
hard by Puget Sound, will take their Ital
ian-government, I-don't-want-it-you
take-it, quarterback-by-committee sys
tem into a hypothetical battle with the
Miami Hurricanes, who, with Heisman
Trophy candidate Gino Toretta at the
controls, couldn't hear Puget from the
cozy confines of the Orange Bowl if they
tried on James Stockdale's hearing aid.
Without going into the hues through
which my face journeyed after our Cardi

nal's 41-7 loss to one of the parties In
question last Saturday, it must be said
that the Huskies and the Hurricanes
have possibly the most accurately
descriptive names in the nation.

Washington has thrust Steve Emtman
and Lincoln Kennedy, Ultra-Slimfast
candidates both, into national promi
nence in the last two years, while Hurri
cane Andrew beset Miami just in time for
fall practice to get underway last August.
Each team is riding the crest of an
incredible winning streak: Miami possess
es the longest run in the nation at 26
games, while Washington has taken 22
straight. Neither has lost since 1990,
when the 'Canes suffered a humiliating,
season-opening setback to top-ranked

Florida State and the Huskies dropped a
contest to an upstart UCLA squad.
In fact, the level of dominance with
which Washington has seized the Pacific
