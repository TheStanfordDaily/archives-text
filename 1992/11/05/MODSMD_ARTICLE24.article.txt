# Stanford awaits second-place USC
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
Come November of the college football season,
talk of bowl bids is a difficult subject for coaches to
avoid.
Bill Walsh is doing one heck of a job.
Saturday's humbling defeat at the hands of top
ranked Washington erased Stanford's once-high
Rose Bowl hopes. Right now the 21st-ranked Cardi
nal (6-3, 3-2 in conference) is hoping at least one
other New Year's Day bowl committee is still paying
attention.
But a loss at home this weekend to No. 11 USC
would likely dash Stanford's hopes of playing any
where on Jan. 1, and Walsh has done his best to keep
the focus as short-term as possible and let the chips
fall where they may.
"I'm not looking too closely at that [bowl bids],"
Walsh said. "I'm looking more closely at the next game,
and the next game and the next game. If we win one,
two or three, I'd assume we'd be a bowl candidate."
Try as Walsh may to avoid it, the question is
where that bowl candidacy will wind up. It's a good
bet that the Pacific 10 Conference runner-up will
find in itself in Tempe for the New Year's Day Fies
ta Bowl. The Cardinal will almost surely end up in
that second slot if they can win their last three.
But knocking off USC, No. 24 Washington State
and California (at Berkeley) in succession is a tall
order for this hobbling, struggling squad. If they
don't pull off the trifecta, look for Stanford to wind
up in either the Freedom (if they finish third in the
Pac-10), the Copper, Hancock or possibly in Honolu
lu for a Aloha Bowl encore.
On paper, this Saturday's match-up with USC
(changed to 3:30 p.m. to accommodate a national
cable telecast on Prime Network) looks like the
toughest on Stanford's remaining schedule. The
Trojans have won four straight since their lone loss
to Washington. Since falling by just a touchdown in
Seattle, USC has bested conference foes Oregon,
California, Washington State and Arizona State to

move into sole possession of second place in the Pac
-10.
The Trojans are paced offensively by flanker Cur
tis Conway, who rivals Glyn Milburn in all-purpose
prowess. Conway is fourth in the nation (to Mil
burn's second) in all-purpose yardage with 178.3
yards per game, and is the NCAA's third-leading
kickofT returner, gaining over 31 yards per runback.
Conway has been quarterback Rob Johnson's
favorite target. Conway has pulled down 31 recep
tions for five touchdowns, and leads a talented
receiving corps in both departments.
Johnson, a first-year starter, has become the
nation's sixth-rated passer while completing over 60
percent of his throws. His success has turned the
Trojans into a strong passing team and made people
forget about USC's Tailback U. tradition.
Or maybe it was a stalled running game that
made them forget about it. The Trojans rushing
attack has barely out-performed the pathetic ground
arsenal of the Cardinal. Tailback Estrus Crayton is
USC's leading rusher, but has picked up only 454
yards in seven games.
That should be welcome news for a worn-out
Stanford defense that was run all over by Napoleon
Kaufman and his fellow Huskies last weekend.
Actually, the Cardinal has been extra-soft against
the run for three straight weeks. Washington, Ore
gon State and Arizona all piled up more than 250
yards on the ground. Stanford, however, still boasts
the NCAA's second-rated pass defense. So if you're a
watcher of statistical match-ups, the prognosis for
the Cardinal defense is a good one.
But it is not the defense that recently has given
the Cardinal braintrust fits. The offense in general,
and, specifically the offensive line, has been below
par. If Stanford is to string together some victories
late in the season, the front five will have to up it a
notch or two.
This week they'll have to do so under less than
ideal circumstances. Both guard Chris Dahnan
(neck) and tackle Steve Hoyem (hip, bicep) are hob
bling after last week's punishing defeat.

Pac-10 finish is within their reach if Stanford defeats USC this Saturday.
