# What's your number?
## Caller tries to convince students to give out PAC codes 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
At least two students have been duped into giv
ing their PAC number this week to a man claim
ing to work for Communications Services.
The man, identifying himself over the tele
phone as "Bruce", convinced them to tell him
their Personal Access Code so that he could test
the number, according to Communications Ser
vices Manager Anne Crowley.
The two students who gave their PAC to
"Bruce" later called Communications Services to
check if he really worked for the campus phone
company, Crowley said.
Both PACs were cancelled and the students
were issued new ones, Crowley said, but no unau
thorized long distance calls had been made.

Another student refused to tell "Bruce" her
PAC number and instead immediately notified
Communications Services, Crowley said.
PAC numbers are required to place long-dis
tance phone calls on the University phone system
unless a person uses a private calling card.
"This is the first time I have ever heard of such
a thing," Crowley said. "I encourage students to
treat their PAC numbers like phone credit cards
that shouldn't be given over the phone to an
unidentified person. If students get this call, they
should by all means call us at 7-HELP."
There is no charge for students to cancel
their PAC number and receive a new one, she
said.
Crowley said she was in the process of report
ing the incidents to the police, but said there was
no way she knew of to catch "Bruce."
