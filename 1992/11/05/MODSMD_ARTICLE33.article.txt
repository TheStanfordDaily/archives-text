Dumb cop movie
smarter than the
average thriller

Jennifer Eight

If Hollywood is to be believed, the world is
full of dumb cops.
Dumb cops never call for backup. They never
have a search warrant or a flashlight. Dumb cops
don't wear uniforms. They carry their guns in

their waistbands and their boots. Dumb cops
drive Mercedes, speak in dumb cop lingo and al
ways get romantically involved with key wit
nesses.
"Jennifer 8" is a stylish, intelligent film about
a dumb cop. Andy Garcia is John Berlin, a
burnt-out detective who joins the police force of
a small Northern California town. He quickly
finds himself standing in the rain atop a moun
tain of garbage, hot on the trail of a lurid serial
killer.
His only witness is a blind woman, played by
Uma Thurman, who just happens to be very at
tractive and who lives in a big, spooky building
with plenty of atmospheric lighting.
At their first meeting, Berlin asks insensitive,
dumb-cop questions like, "What are you staring
at?" and "What color was the dog?"
Soon enough, he's telling her his life story
and she's quoting Wordsworth and wearing too
much makeup.
Not even the fact that she's being stalked by
the still-at-large killer can interrupt this groove.
But when a stakeout goes disastrously wrong
and Berlin's partner is killed, our hero finds
himself under federal investigation. If only he
had called for backup.
Berlin's quest to save his girl and clear his
name leads him on a manic chase from the wilds
of Humboldt County to the arts-and-crafts
mecca of Oakland.
Slowly, the clues fall into place, and all the
evidence points to the detective himself. He may
be a good kisser, but he's also a murder suspect.
Unlike most dumb cop movies, "Jennifer 8"
is in no hurry to deliver the proverbial goods.
It's talkier than other films of its genre, and
hence more confusing.
Although director/screenwriter Bruce
Robinson seems more interested in complexity
than clarity, he ultimately achieves both. The
payoff is a long time coming, but come it does in
the form of a whiz-bang surprise ending.
In his first turn as a leading man, Garcia cer

tainly looks the part, but his frantic speech pat
terns and stress-puppy grimace considerably
undermine his performance.
Thurman, burdened with greasy hair and
shapeless avocado dresses, manages to deliver
such insipid lines as "Are my lips lying to you?"
with aplomb.
Pale and sniveling, John Malkovich is alter
nately comic and creepy as the FBI agent who
interrogates Berlin. Lance Henriksen makes a
convincing good ol* boy as Berlin's partner, but
Kathy Baker is wasted as his doting wife.
Designer Richard Mac Donald and director
of photography Conrad Hall create an intimate

small-town environment, a cinema-verite ver
sion of "Twin Peaks."
Filmed on location in Eureka, Calif. "Jen
nifer 8" alternates between the gloomy and the
picturesque. Darkness is its essential element,
followed by blood and snow.
While "Jennifer 8" wants to be a romantic
thriller, it's best when it sticks to catching bad
guys.
The film wallows in some undue coarseness
and unnecessary confusion, but redeems itself
with a sleek look and sophisticated plotting. I
can't wait for "Jennifer 9."
