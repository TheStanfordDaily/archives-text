Jude Narita
dispels myths
of Asian women

Song for a Sansei

Actress Jude Narita aims to dispel stereo
types of Asian women in her performance
"Coming into Passion — Song for a Sansei,"

which depicts the emotional odyssey of the
third-generation Japanese-American, or the
"Sansei."
Motivated by the lack of roles available to
Asian women, Narita forges her own space in

her one-woman show. She
portrays Asian women as
amalgamates of vastly dif
ferent cultures — impossi
ble to stereotype, because
they can't be distinctly de
fined.
Her hour-long perfor
mance consists of a variety
of segments. Beginning
with "Good Job," the tale of
a young Vietnamese prosti
tute in Saigon during the
war, Narita initiates the
viewer into a realm of mis
representation while illu
minating a harsher reality.
Other segments include:
"No. 852," the story of a Fil
ipino mail-order bride;
"Little Boy," a fairy tale
about Hiroshima; "Nisei
Day," about a Japanese-
American girl growing up
in western society, "Strong
Heart," the story of a Cam
bodian woman struggling
with her new American life;
and "Karate and Bamboo,"
about a young Sansei trou
blemaker.
Narita began writing
and performing in an at
tempt to foster understand
ing of Asian women. Her
characters brazenly con
front both racial and sexual
issues, allowing the audi-

ence to look beyond the "Asian" issues and into
the similarities among all people.
Narita received the L.A. Drama Critics
Award for the creation and performance of
"Coming into Passion," along with a Drama

logue Award and a Vesta Award from the
Woman's Building of LA.
Her performance will take place Friday,
Nov. 6 at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel auditorium.
Tickets are available at the Tresidder Ticket Of
fice, 725-ARTS, and cost $18 and $16, ($3 less
with student discount).

A Japanese play
raises questions
of life and death

The Dressing Room

Four actresses straddle the blurred lines be
tween reality and illusion in contemporary
Japanese playwright Kunio Shimizu's
"Gakuya" | M The Dressing Room"].
The actresses, only identified as A, B, C and
D, congregate in a dressing room to discuss the
theater, disputing past plays and regretting
their own failed aspirations. Not until the play
is significantly underway does the audience find
out two of the actresses are ghosts.
The juxtaposition of the failed live actresses
with the dead raises interesting existential ques
tions. The dressing room setting, where actress
es pass in and out donning new identities as ca
sually as costumes, brings these questions to the
fore.
Shimizu, whose theatrical career began in
the tumultuous atmosphere of lapan in the
'60s, uses the actresses' conflicts as a paradigm
for that era. Just as Japan struggled to maintain

its past while blazing along the road of eco
nomic stardom, so the actresscs marvel at the
disorienting advance of time and the ephemer
ality of youth.
Presented in English at the Noh Space, an
intimate theater in San Francisco, "Gakuya"
blurs conventionally defined concepts of the
ater. When the first actress slowly and incon
spicuously flows into the dressing room before
the lights go out, it is not clear that the play has
begun.
And when the actresses recite lines from
Chekhov's plays "The Seagull" and"The Three
Sisters," it's unclear whether they're acting as
actresses or telling their own stories.
The highly stylized Noh choreography is a
highlight of the play. The style, which originat
ed in 14th-century japan, traditionally de
pended upon wooden masks and slow, con
ventionalized movements to reveal the drama
of the play. "Gakuya" features no masks, but
the aimless wandering of the two ghost actress
es captures the feeling of Noh theater.
The play's acting is generally convincing.
Although the loud, shrill cries of "Actress C"
seem too melodramatic at times, the rest of the
actresses portray believable characters.
"Gakuya" will play until Nov. 15 at the Noh
Space at 2840 Mariposa at Alabama. Call the
box office for tickets: 621 -0507.

intimate theater in San Francisco, "Gakuya"
blurs conventionally defined concepts of the
ater. When the first actress slowly and incon
spicuously flows into the dressing room before
the lights go out, it is not clear that the play has
begun.
And when the actresses recite lines from
Chekhov's plays "The Seagull" and"The Three
Sisters," it's unclear whether they're acting as
actresses or telling their own stories.
The highly stylized Noh choreography is a
highlight of the play. The style, which originat
ed in 14th-century japan, traditionally de
pended upon wooden masks and slow, con
ventionalized movements to reveal the drama
of the play. "Gakuya" features no masks, but
the aimless wandering of the two ghost actress
es captures the feeling of Noh theater.
The play's acting is generally convincing.
Although the loud, shrill cries of "Actress C"
seem too melodramatic at times, the rest of the
actresses portray believable characters.
"Gakuya" will play until Nov. 15 at the Noh
Space at 2840 Mariposa at Alabama. Call the
box office for tickets: 621 -0507.

Jude Narita
dispels myths
of Asian women

Song for a Sansei

Actress Jude Narita aims to dispel stereo
types of Asian women in her performance
"Coming into Passion — Song for a Sansei,"

which depicts the emotional odyssey of the
third-generation Japanese-American, or the
"Sansei."
Motivated by the lack of roles available to
Asian women, Narita forges her own space in

her one-woman show. She
portrays Asian women as
amalgamates of vastly dif
ferent cultures — impossi
ble to stereotype, because
they can't be distinctly de
fined.
Her hour-long perfor
mance consists of a variety
of segments. Beginning
with "Good Job," the tale of
a young Vietnamese prosti
tute in Saigon during the
war, Narita initiates the
viewer into a realm of mis
representation while illu
minating a harsher reality.
Other segments include:
"No. 852," the story of a Fil
ipino mail-order bride;
"Little Boy," a fairy tale
about Hiroshima; "Nisei
Day," about a Japanese-
American girl growing up
in western society, "Strong
Heart," the story of a Cam
bodian woman struggling
with her new American life;
and "Karate and Bamboo,"
about a young Sansei trou
blemaker.
Narita began writing
and performing in an at
tempt to foster understand
ing of Asian women. Her
characters brazenly con
front both racial and sexual
issues, allowing the audi-

ence to look beyond the "Asian" issues and into
the similarities among all people.
Narita received the L.A. Drama Critics
Award for the creation and performance of
"Coming into Passion," along with a Drama

logue Award and a Vesta Award from the
Woman's Building of LA.
Her performance will take place Friday,
Nov. 6 at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel auditorium.
Tickets are available at the Tresidder Ticket Of
fice, 725-ARTS, and cost $18 and $16, ($3 less
with student discount).

A Japanese play
raises questions
of life and death

The Dressing Room

Four actresses straddle the blurred lines be
tween reality and illusion in contemporary
Japanese playwright Kunio Shimizu's
"Gakuya" | M The Dressing Room"].
The actresses, only identified as A, B, C and
D, congregate in a dressing room to discuss the
theater, disputing past plays and regretting
their own failed aspirations. Not until the play
is significantly underway does the audience find
out two of the actresses are ghosts.
The juxtaposition of the failed live actresses
with the dead raises interesting existential ques
tions. The dressing room setting, where actress
es pass in and out donning new identities as ca
sually as costumes, brings these questions to the
fore.
Shimizu, whose theatrical career began in
the tumultuous atmosphere of lapan in the
'60s, uses the actresses' conflicts as a paradigm
for that era. Just as Japan struggled to maintain
