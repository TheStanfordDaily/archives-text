Serch success:
MC returns the
hip-hop product

MC Serch

Black culture's favorite hip-hop advocate,
MC Serch, formerly of 3rd Bass, has re
turned ... alone. But his solo effort won't
convince you that he's flipped any scripts —
musically or lyrically.
Back in '89, Serch and his cronies

launched an unprovoked attack against MC
Hammer and his top-40 sound. Three years
later, Serch still scorns the performer with a
diligence that makes many of hip-hop's
more militant brothas look like jiggabooish
integrationists. And Serch hasn't forgiven
himself for being white yet either.
Nonetheless, "Return of the Product" is a
reasonably successful collection of hits and
misses, that won't have any trouble pleasing
the same audience that digs Hammer.
"Here it Comes" and "Back to the Grill,"
the album's first two singles, are dance tunes
rooted in heavy basslines, techno-poppish
sound effects and live instrumentation. Al
though definitely not the hardest tracks to
ever hit pop radio, both hold their own.
Other tracks like "Don't Have to Be" and
"Hard But True," which showcase snappy
guitar and bass riffs, should also spark main
stream interests. Furthermore, they serve as
the vehicles for Serch's more socially con
scious rhymes.
The former urges us to make like Nike ads

and "just do it," while the latter asks blacks
and whites to "sit down and mingle... over
supper." Fortunately, preacher man litters
only a few of the album's 11 tracks with his
"science."
"Daze In A Weak," the dopest track on
"Return of the Product," works because it
avoids commercial victimization.
A march-like cadence, accompanied by a
whining James Brownesque trumpet solo,
pulls you into a hip-hop nether world where
you'll be obliged to bop in unison with the
the groove's syncopation. Serch rhymes ef
fortlessly over the number's looped samples
and programmed beats, rounding out a
package so stellar that it's truly disappoint
ing to hear it end.
When Serch declares himself "the baddest
white boy to ever fuckin' touch a mic," in
"Daze in A Weak," you might be tempted to
agree. But the rest of the album's watery
sound will quickly bring you to your senses.
Serch still hasn't learned that being a
white b-boy isn't about smothering yourself

in urban black culture or swallowing the
poisonous hemlock of white guilt. It's about
skills and attitude.
Until he learns this, you'd do well to let
House of Pain "Put Your Head Out."

'Main Offender:'
Richards offers
pure satisfaction

Keith Richards

On "Main Offender," Keith Richards
proves without a doubt that he no longer
needs the Rolling Stones as a creative outlet.
The album is less accessible than his solo
debut, "Talk is Cheap," or the Stones' "Steel
Wheels." But the result is a richer, more ma
ture album than any the Stones have pro
duced in years.
Richards' second solo effort marks the
end of his four-year separation from the
Xpensive Winos, the band he formed to
record and tour for "Talk is Cheap." The en
semble sounds like they've been playing to
gether since birth, not just two albums.
Drummer Steve Jordan is particularly
outstanding, igniting simple backbeats with
energy and expert fills. It's hard not to enjoy
the sound of musicians having fun; the
band's chemistry brings this album alive.
Since the songs were co-authored by
Richards and Jordan, almost all of them
begin with a propulsive drumbeat or guitar
riff before developing into a network of
rhythmic counterpoints and rich textures.
The first single, "Wicked As It Seems,"
doesn't try to overwhelm with a catchy riff
and chorus, instead seducing with its sinewy

groove and commanding back-up singing.
But its the ballads that show Richards at
his most versatile and moving. "Yap Yap" and
"Demon" are beautiful, worthy successors of
Richards' Stones ballads, "All About You" and
"Slipping Away."
Richards' fragmentary lyrics and ciga
rette-ravaged voice may alienate some listen
ers. But these traits logically reflect his off
hand, ragged-genius guitar style. Anyone
who's ever appreciated the voices of Bob
Dylan, Tom Waits or Bob Marley should have
no trouble enjoying Richards' vocal stylings.
While pretenders like the Black Crowes
try desperately to re-create classic Stones ma
terial, and Mick Jagger struggles to be hip for
the MTV generation, Richards settles into
middle age making confident, honest, addic
tive music.

Half moon better
than full: newest
album drags on

Neil Young

"Harvest Moon" is mellow. Mellower
than 1970's "After the Gold Rush." Mellower,
even, than Neil Young's last team effort with
the Stray Gators, 1972's "Harvest."
The Stray Gators are back, and they've
mellowed even more with age. Fully
acoustic, the album doesn't even feature
much in the way of percussion. Young's voice
sounds like it's traveling from the nether-
worlds, and he's a good 10 feet away
from the microphones down there.
Th« back-up singers, though
they include Linda Rondstadt and
James Taylor, do nothing but
annoy.
If Neil Young is going to play
acoustic, the only people you want
to hear in the background are
David Crosby and Graham Nash.
The slide guitar, however, works
well throughout, particularly in the
Northern California-style lullaby,
"Harvest Moon."
The first song, "Unknown Leg
end," is the catchiest of the bunch,
and the most attention-grabbing
— though it still wouldn't be out of
place on an Enya disc.
"From Hank to Hendrix" is
probably the best of the lot, with a
hauntingly catchy theme. Young
dedicated this song in particular
(along with the entire album) to his

wife Pegi, and the song airs their
marital problems, as he sings, "Cal
ifornia style" more than Neil Young
style. It's sad, yet affirming, as are
most songs with a slide guitar.
After a strong first half, however,
the second half goes nowhere. "One
of These Days" and "Natural Beau
ty" — the live, 10-minute song that
ends the album — save it some
what.
But the rest of the side, consist
ing of two insipid tunes soon to
debut at your dentist's office, along
with an Edie-Brickell-inspired
song about a dead dog, does noth
ing but disappoint.
After his last two albums, "Free
dom" and "Ragged Glory," "Har
vest Moon" is a breather and some
thing of a let down.
It's pretty, it's good to go to sleep
to, but it makes you wonder: How
can the same man have released
"Arc" — a 20-minute collage of
guitar feedback — and this album
one year apart? Must be a tough
marriage.

'Main Offender:'
Richards offers
pure satisfaction

Keith Richards

On "Main Offender," Keith Richards
proves without a doubt that he no longer
needs the Rolling Stones as a creative outlet.
The album is less accessible than his solo
debut, "Talk is Cheap," or the Stones' "Steel
Wheels." But the result is a richer, more ma
ture album than any the Stones have pro
duced in years.
Richards' second solo effort marks the
end of his four-year separation from the
Xpensive Winos, the band he formed to
record and tour for "Talk is Cheap." The en
semble sounds like they've been playing to
gether since birth, not just two albums.
Drummer Steve Jordan is particularly
outstanding, igniting simple backbeats with
energy and expert fills. It's hard not to enjoy
the sound of musicians having fun; the
band's chemistry brings this album alive.
Since the songs were co-authored by
Richards and Jordan, almost all of them
begin with a propulsive drumbeat or guitar
riff before developing into a network of
rhythmic counterpoints and rich textures.
The first single, "Wicked As It Seems,"
doesn't try to overwhelm with a catchy riff
and chorus, instead seducing with its sinewy

groove and commanding back-up singing.
But its the ballads that show Richards at
his most versatile and moving. "Yap Yap" and
"Demon" are beautiful, worthy successors of
Richards' Stones ballads, "All About You" and
"Slipping Away."
Richards' fragmentary lyrics and ciga
rette-ravaged voice may alienate some listen
ers. But these traits logically reflect his off
hand, ragged-genius guitar style. Anyone
who's ever appreciated the voices of Bob
Dylan, Tom Waits or Bob Marley should have
no trouble enjoying Richards' vocal stylings.
While pretenders like the Black Crowes
try desperately to re-create classic Stones ma

the MTV generation, Richards settles into
middle age making confident, honest, addic

Half moon better
than full: newest
album drags on

Neil Young

"Harvest Moon" is mellow. Mellower
than 1970's "After the Gold Rush." Mellower,
even, than Neil Young's last team effort with
the Stray Gators, 1972's "Harvest."
The Stray Gators are back, and they've
mellowed even more with age. Fully
acoustic, the album doesn't even feature
much in the way of percussion. Young's voice
sounds like it's traveling from the nether-
worlds, and he's a good 10 feet away
from the microphones down there.
Th« back-up singers, though
they include Linda Rondstadt and
James Taylor, do nothing but
annoy.
If Neil Young is going to play
acoustic, the only people you want
to hear in the background are
David Crosby and Graham Nash.
The slide guitar, however, works
well throughout, particularly in the
Northern California-style lullaby,
"Harvest Moon."
The first song, "Unknown Leg
end," is the catchiest of the bunch,
and the most attention-grabbing
— though it still wouldn't be out of
place on an Enya disc.
"From Hank to Hendrix" is
probably the best of the lot, with a
hauntingly catchy theme. Young
dedicated this song in particular
(along with the entire album) to his

wife Pegi, and the song airs their
marital problems, as he sings, "Cal
ifornia style" more than Neil Young
style. It's sad, yet affirming, as are
most songs with a slide guitar.
After a strong first half, however,
the second half goes nowhere. "One
of These Days" and "Natural Beau
ty" — the live, 10-minute song that
ends the album — save it some
what.
But the rest of the side, consist
ing of two insipid tunes soon to
debut at your dentist's office, along
with an Edie-Brickell-inspired
song about a dead dog, does noth
ing but disappoint.
After his last two albums, "Free
dom" and "Ragged Glory," "Har
vest Moon" is a breather and some
thing of a let down.
It's pretty, it's good to go to sleep
to, but it makes you wonder: How
can the same man have released
"Arc" — a 20-minute collage of
guitar feedback — and this album
one year apart? Must be a tough
marriage.

Serch success:
MC returns the
hip-hop product

MC Serch

Black culture's favorite hip-hop advocate,
MC Serch, formerly of 3rd Bass, has re
turned ... alone. But his solo effort won't
convince you that he's flipped any scripts —
musically or lyrically.
Back in '89, Serch and his cronies

launched an unprovoked attack against MC
Hammer and his top-40 sound. Three years
later, Serch still scorns the performer with a
diligence that makes many of hip-hop's
more militant brothas look like jiggabooish
integrationists. And Serch hasn't forgiven
himself for being white yet either.
Nonetheless, "Return of the Product" is a
reasonably successful collection of hits and
misses, that won't have any trouble pleasing
the same audience that digs Hammer.
"Here it Comes" and "Back to the Grill,"
the album's first two singles, are dance tunes
rooted in heavy basslines, techno-poppish
sound effects and live instrumentation. Al
though definitely not the hardest tracks to
ever hit pop radio, both hold their own.
Other tracks like "Don't Have to Be" and
"Hard But True," which showcase snappy
guitar and bass riffs, should also spark main
stream interests. Furthermore, they serve as
the vehicles for Serch's more socially con
scious rhymes.
The former urges us to make like Nike ads

and "just do it," while the latter asks blacks
and whites to "sit down and mingle... over
supper." Fortunately, preacher man litters
only a few of the album's 11 tracks with his
"science."
"Daze In A Weak," the dopest track on
"Return of the Product," works because it
avoids commercial victimization.
A march-like cadence, accompanied by a
whining James Brownesque trumpet solo,
pulls you into a hip-hop nether world where
you'll be obliged to bop in unison with the
the groove's syncopation. Serch rhymes ef
fortlessly over the number's looped samples
and programmed beats, rounding out a
package so stellar that it's truly disappoint
ing to hear it end.
When Serch declares himself "the baddest
white boy to ever fuckin' touch a mic," in
"Daze in A Weak," you might be tempted to
agree. But the rest of the album's watery
sound will quickly bring you to your senses.
Serch still hasn't learned that being a
white b-boy isn't about smothering yourself

in urban black culture or swallowing the
poisonous hemlock of white guilt. It's about
skills and attitude.
