Serch success:
MC returns the
hip-hop product

MC Serch

Black culture's favorite hip-hop advocate,
MC Serch, formerly of 3rd Bass, has re
turned ... alone. But his solo effort won't
convince you that he's flipped any scripts —
musically or lyrically.
Back in '89, Serch and his cronies

launched an unprovoked attack against MC
Hammer and his top-40 sound. Three years
later, Serch still scorns the performer with a
diligence that makes many of hip-hop's
more militant brothas look like jiggabooish
integrationists. And Serch hasn't forgiven
himself for being white yet either.
Nonetheless, "Return of the Product" is a
reasonably successful collection of hits and
misses, that won't have any trouble pleasing
the same audience that digs Hammer.
"Here it Comes" and "Back to the Grill,"
the album's first two singles, are dance tunes
rooted in heavy basslines, techno-poppish
sound effects and live instrumentation. Al
though definitely not the hardest tracks to
ever hit pop radio, both hold their own.
Other tracks like "Don't Have to Be" and
"Hard But True," which showcase snappy
guitar and bass riffs, should also spark main
stream interests. Furthermore, they serve as
the vehicles for Serch's more socially con
scious rhymes.
The former urges us to make like Nike ads

and "just do it," while the latter asks blacks
and whites to "sit down and mingle... over
supper." Fortunately, preacher man litters
only a few of the album's 11 tracks with his
"science."
"Daze In A Weak," the dopest track on
"Return of the Product," works because it
avoids commercial victimization.
A march-like cadence, accompanied by a
whining James Brownesque trumpet solo,
pulls you into a hip-hop nether world where
you'll be obliged to bop in unison with the
the groove's syncopation. Serch rhymes ef
fortlessly over the number's looped samples
and programmed beats, rounding out a
package so stellar that it's truly disappoint
ing to hear it end.
When Serch declares himself "the baddest
white boy to ever fuckin' touch a mic," in
"Daze in A Weak," you might be tempted to
agree. But the rest of the album's watery
sound will quickly bring you to your senses.
Serch still hasn't learned that being a
white b-boy isn't about smothering yourself

in urban black culture or swallowing the
poisonous hemlock of white guilt. It's about
skills and attitude.
Until he learns this, you'd do well to let
House of Pain "Put Your Head Out."

'Main Offender:'
Richards offers
pure satisfaction

Keith Richards

On "Main Offender," Keith Richards
proves without a doubt that he no longer
needs the Rolling Stones as a creative outlet.
The album is less accessible than his solo
debut, "Talk is Cheap," or the Stones' "Steel
Wheels." But the result is a richer, more ma
ture album than any the Stones have pro
duced in years.
Richards' second solo effort marks the
end of his four-year separation from the
Xpensive Winos, the band he formed to
record and tour for "Talk is Cheap." The en
semble sounds like they've been playing to
gether since birth, not just two albums.
Drummer Steve Jordan is particularly
outstanding, igniting simple backbeats with
energy and expert fills. It's hard not to enjoy
the sound of musicians having fun; the
band's chemistry brings this album alive.
Since the songs were co-authored by
Richards and Jordan, almost all of them
begin with a propulsive drumbeat or guitar
riff before developing into a network of
rhythmic counterpoints and rich textures.
The first single, "Wicked As It Seems,"
doesn't try to overwhelm with a catchy riff
and chorus, instead seducing with its sinewy

MC Serch's "Return of the Product" proves that white men can rap — sometimes. The
album is his first solo effort.
