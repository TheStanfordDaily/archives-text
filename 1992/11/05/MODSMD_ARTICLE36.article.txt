# In a Stanford Manor
## The
						style of rural gentry lives on in neoclassical residences.

Architecture is the ultimate
expression of man's innate
ability to create, to influ
ence and mold the environ
ment around him. The
Pyramids of Egypt, the
Acropolis of Athens, the
Great Wall of China —
these are the architectural delegations of the
societies for which they were created.
Leland Stanford Junior University, a
humble lodestar of academic sublimity, has
its own architectural masterpieces: Hoover
Tower, Memorial Church — and the often
overlooked Stanford residences.
From the grandeur of Lambda Nu's
bathroom and the elegance of Toyon's own
spiral staircase, to the bowels of Wilbur's
basement bedrooms, Stanford basks in an
unparalleled architectural light.

One of the most unexpectedly unique
sites on campus — the basement of Wilbur
Hall — is home to less treaded, but equally
unusual architectural ground: the Bat Cave.
Located in the often-overlooked base
ment of Wilbur Hall, the Bat Cave is officially
known as the Otero Red Carpet Annex, which
the deep red shag underfoot attributes. But
on the living room wall is displayed its true al
legiance: the shining emblem of the Bat.
"It's sort of Frank Lloyd Wright," said
resident Matt Duckworth, one of four ju
niors occupying the spacious quad.
Originally a product of creative Resi
dential Education, the Bat Cave is converted
office space. It boasts two bedrooms, a bath
room, three large closets and a seminar room
turned living room — complete with vital
accessories: its own wall-length chalkboard,
entertainment center and extra bed.

Although not attached to any one dor
mitory, the Bat Cave is technically considered
part of the nearest four-class dorm, Soto. The
Bat Cave's inhabitants, however, seem to
dance with the devil in their own separate so
cial underworld.
"It's the ultimate place to party and hang
out," Duckworth said. "We have to leave to
really get anything done."
Parties, barbecues on the roof, bath
room windows ideal for potential voyeurs,
and the room's one-of-a-kind location all
contribute to the Cave's activity.
Although much of its interior design is
indigenous to the room itself, the Bat Cave
still accurately reflects the residents' light
hearted personal Zen.
The flesh-toned bathroom tile displays
an underlying humor in its design and the
blue carpeting of the hallways and living
