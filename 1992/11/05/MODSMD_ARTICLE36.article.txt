# In a Stanford Manor
## The 						style of rural gentry lives on in neoclassical residences.

Architecture is the ultimate
expression of man's innate
ability to create, to influ
ence and mold the environ
ment around him. The
Pyramids of Egypt, the
Acropolis of Athens, the
Great Wall of China —
these are the architectural delegations of the
societies for which they were created.
Leland Stanford Junior University, a
humble lodestar of academic sublimity, has
its own architectural masterpieces: Hoover
Tower, Memorial Church — and the often
overlooked Stanford residences.
From the grandeur of Lambda Nu's
bathroom and the elegance of Toyon's own
spiral staircase, to the bowels of Wilbur's
basement bedrooms, Stanford basks in an
unparalleled architectural light.

One of the most unexpectedly unique
sites on campus — the basement of Wilbur
Hall — is home to less treaded, but equally
unusual architectural ground: the Bat Cave.
Located in the often-overlooked base
ment of Wilbur Hall, the Bat Cave is officially
known as the Otero Red Carpet Annex, which
the deep red shag underfoot attributes. But
on the living room wall is displayed its true al
legiance: the shining emblem of the Bat.
"It's sort of Frank Lloyd Wright," said
resident Matt Duckworth, one of four ju
niors occupying the spacious quad.
Originally a product of creative Resi
dential Education, the Bat Cave is converted
office space. It boasts two bedrooms, a bath
room, three large closets and a seminar room
turned living room — complete with vital
accessories: its own wall-length chalkboard,
entertainment center and extra bed.

Although not attached to any one dor
mitory, the Bat Cave is technically considered
part of the nearest four-class dorm, Soto. The
Bat Cave's inhabitants, however, seem to
dance with the devil in their own separate so
cial underworld.
"It's the ultimate place to party and hang
out," Duckworth said. "We have to leave to
really get anything done."
Parties, barbecues on the roof, bath
room windows ideal for potential voyeurs,
and the room's one-of-a-kind location all
contribute to the Cave's activity.
Although much of its interior design is
indigenous to the room itself, the Bat Cave
still accurately reflects the residents' light
hearted personal Zen.

room is a compelling contrast to the deep
shag red. It allows for a subtly patriotic col
oration, but, more importantly, reminds
Duckworth of America's most esteemed en
tertainment center — the movie theater.
The more personal touches of the cave are
found covering the walls, and revealing the in
nermost complexities of its residents. Both
Duckworth and Rivera site their childhood
memories as influential to the Cave's decorum.
"The Field of Dreams is my favorite
place on earth," said Duckworth, a native of
Des Moines, lowa, gesturing to a poster of a
sweeping aerial photograph of the field dis
played in the living room. "It kind of makes
me feel at home."
Paco Rivera, of Brownsville, Texas, has
artfully adorned their living space with rem
nants of his spring break trip to South Padre
Island, just off the coast from his home. Bot
tles of tequila and a variety of other drinks
line many of the cave shelves.
Seemingly disconnected from the light
hearted, Bat-inspired theme of the room, a
Kathy Ireland poster makes a statement by
jutting out from amongst the design. Why
the poster?
"Just because," Rivera said.
Leaving behind the reckless
abandon of some architectural
tendencies, 553 Mayfield has
an aura of rock-like stability.
It's gray exterior reeks of a stal
wart presidio dedicated to in
tellectual brawn. There is a
break in this image, however —
the laissez faire of the first floor quad.
The high windows and their colorful cov
erings juxtaposed against the ominous gray of
the house's exterior, points to this room as a
beacon of titillation. The room, currently a
triple, has two rooms, a bathroom and in
cludes the entire southwest side of the house.
The bathroom, an integral part of the
suite, is decorated with a tropical, pink
flamingo motif. The seafoam green of its ac
cessories and the primitive, grainy look of
the wooden crate magazine rack, is a mod
ern echo of Swiss Family Robinson.
The room, once an integral part of the
house's social scene, was renovated into liv
ing quarters by Res Ed. "My bed is where the
bar was," said Michael Green, referring to
553's prior role as the Delt House.
The interior of the main room is deco
rated with wood paneling. This rich natural
texture, coupled with the soft citrus glow of
light through the tangerine curtains, lends a
playful, impish feel to the room.
"The walls are kind of neat, but I keep
wondering what the Delts did to them all
those years ago," said Green. "The claw marks
over my bed — we've never figured those
out."
The size of the room allows for endless
furniture permutations, but its immensity
does have a solitudinous effect but its loca
tion on the first floor makes the room the
hub of social activity. "Gravity brings people
down here," said Green. "Plus, we have the
kitchen."

level, the wooden deck provides a panoram
ic, picturesque view that overlooks the dry
lake and the foothills, adding the joy of archi
tectural ingenuity to those using the bath
room and those studying on the balcony
alike.
The coed bathroom is used by six
women and two men, and residents claim its
cleanliness is unprecedented. However, ac
cording to resident Rufus Namdies, relaxing
on the sun-swathed deck while people are
using the bathroom is problematic.
"They always leave the door open," he
said. "You're sitting here and suddenly you
hear this noise. And you don't want to con
sider that it's female because that just makes
it infinitely worse."
Stairs fulfill not merely utili
tarian needs, but aesthetic
ones as well — most no
ticeable in Toyon, the Pa
tron Dorm of Lofts, where
room 113 displays the fa
mous Loft With the Spiral
Staircase.
In the middle of the room, the staircase
ascends, connecting to the room-length loft.
The natural wood of its wedge-shaped steps
vibrantly enhances the black iron vertical
supports. The handrail is plastic, and blends
perfectly with the elegance of the timber and
ebony construction.
Although sophomore Nik Kolodny and
roommates did not design the staircase them
selves — they purchased it from an ex-Toyon
resident — they hope to improve upon the
loft's design over the course of the year. Thus
far, their additions include a clothesline.
"Our biggest contribution will probably
be to just get it past the fire code," said Kolod
ny of the iron and plastic-railed staircase.
A sticker on the bottom step of the stair
case facetiously reads: "Danger! Do not stand

on or above this step. You can lose your bal
ance."
Kolodny's roommate, Kyle Utsumi, ad
mitted that the greatest use for the staircase is
its unique role as a social tool. "It will proba
bly prompt us to go to more formals and take
pictures on the staircase," he said.
£ wanted something ab-surd,"
said senior Theresa Urist of
her Palace of Splendor, locat
ed just outside of the heart of
Theta Chi. "I wanted to create
an ephemeral palace for my
self."
Among the swatches of gold lam£, gilded
leaves and statuettes, that palace was created.
Its theme: lounging, fleshy nudes and
cherubs.
Urist transforms her room each year
into an otherworldly refuge. Her Palace of
Splendor, as it has been dubbed, graces the
Theta Chi house with a style worthy of the
Kween of Kitsch.
Painted green and purple by the previ
ous resident, the two room double was ideal
for Urist's theme.
"Purple and green arc the colors of
grapes and decadence and nobility. One
must feel noble when one is lounging with
nudes," she said.
And lounging with nudes is exactly what
one does in the Palace of Splendor. Adorning the
walls are a variety of Baroque and Rococo prints
of nudes. Nudes lying on the shore. Nudes eating
figs. Nudes surrounded by rosy-cheeked
cherubs. Nudes with names like "Naissance De
Venus" by painters like Bouguereau.
Among the prints are flying, ceramic
cherubs, harp and lyre in hand. Arcs of gold
cloth, golden leaves, and even a gilded water
pipe dance across the fabric-covered walls
and the homemade curtains which shimmer
with green light from a tiny, antique lamp.
"It's nice when you come back from a
stressful day of classes to put on harp music
and light the candles and have the cherubs

and nudes come alive," she said.
By exploring garage sales, it takes the bet
ter part of a year for Urist to collect the deco
rations for her themes, which have also in
cluded plastic fruit and '70s schlock.
"People like tacky things and they're just
too afraid to admit it. I like tacky things and I
like to live in it," she admits. "It has the be taken
to the Nth degree. It's not enough to have just
one nude... you have to have bounties to sort
of immerse yourself in it."
Urist feels that her room "has to be a
haven" to her. "It has to be a place where I
could just sort of retreat into and enjoy and
feel very comfortable."
"Wow," she said, holding a print of a nude

surrounding by frolicking cherubs, "Wouldn't it
be fun to be in that situation?"
Referring to a statuette high above her
stereo, "Look at her urn. What could be more
exciting [than] carrying an urn and just pos
ing with grapes.
"It's fun to savor life occasionally. I think
(the nudes] had the right idea."
Part of Urist's savoring of life includes a
guest book for all visitors to sign, which was
used frequently during a grand opening
party held earlier this quarter. She described
it as bacchanalian, complete with guests in
costume, grapes, wine punches, harp music
and printed invitations.
"It was fun. It was stupid," she said.
