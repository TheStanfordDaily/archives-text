# Sex, politics, power in 'Duchess'
## 
### Molly Conroy 
Intrigue, incest and insanity take center
stage in the Drama Department production
of "The Duchess of Malfi." In this version of
the play, director and designer Judith Dolan
mixes a potent dose of modernity with the
17th-century tale.
Rather than drawing from the original
play by John Webster, Dolan, a doctoral can
didate in the Drama Department, employs
the more modern, but lesser known 1946
Bertolt Brecht adaptation, which focuses on
power plays and sexual politics.
In the play, a recently widowed Duchess
— played by senior (Crista Hoeppner — be
comes entangled in the schemes of her two
brothers, both of whom object to her remar
rying. While the Cardinal seeks to control her
money and estates, Duke Ferdinand is con
sumed with incestuous love for his sister.
This volatile set-up is strained further
when the Duchess initiates a love affair with
her servant Antonio.
Dolan, a former professional costume de
signer, adds contemporary touches to the
play through the costumes: Jacobean under
pinnings with a funky, modern twist. While
the Duchess' gowns are somewhat tradition
al, the soldiers' garbs, in basic black, stand out
with their futuristic padding and details.
Dolan points to a scene in which the
Duchess seduces Antonio to illustrate the
modernity she seeks to convey in the produc
tion. She says the combination of humor and
danger in this sex scene, which reverses the
traditional sex roles, speaks to a contempo
rary audience. Ironically, this scene comes
from the 17th-century Webster original, not
the 20th-century version.
For her adaptation, Dolan creates a female
character who, in the tradition of the classical
Greek chorus, comments on the action of the
play. Through this addition, Dolan chal
lenges the audience to think about what they
are seeing instead of absorbing it unquestion
ingly. In her view, theater should actively en

gage the audience, not just provide a form of
escape.
For "Duchess" the audience will be seated in
church pews on stage, where they will be able to
both watch the play and intimately observe its
technical elements.
In an attempt to demystify the audience's
experience with theater, Dolan deliberately
leaves the stage's technical elements — beams,
lighting and actors' entrance and exit points—
completely exposed.
In constructing the set for "Duchess,"
Dolan says she recycled some of the Drama
Department's old sets. Since last year's Uni
versity budget cuts, the department has had
to cut production costs.

But although "Duchess" is her first largt
scale set design, Dolan does not regret h<
limited means, and says the material f<
"Duchess" follows the basic political and ae
thetic instincts of the play. She prefers a basi
elegant approach to overdone "pretty illi
sionism" she says.
Dolan says the smaller venue here allov
her to "take chances" and create somethii
entirely new. Appropriately, the creatis
process for"The Duchess" has been a co
laboration between Dolan and other sti
dents. The show stars mostly undergradi
ates and first-year grad students, and has a
original score composed by senior Karc
Weitzman.
