# Black cows and epidermal art

All I see are black cows
All I need are black cows
I'm in love with black cows.
Drummer Jack Bowen composed
these deep lyrics in the third grade. At
that point he didn't realize he would be
fast on his way to becoming the Mor

rissey of the mQk scene. In only a few
short years, he would be performing
this loud, thrashing opus under a spot
light in front of a crowd of screaming
fans.
Fornaka, Bo wen's newly formed
band, made its debut last Friday at
SchifFs open-mike night. And the
bovine angst number proved a better
crowd pleaser than E Z Cheez.

If you thought the Ed Sullivan
Show was random, then it's time for
enlightenment. While Schiff can't offer
the Beades or Seftor Wences, its acts
are just as eccentric. From black cows
to Hungarian poetry readings, every
Friday night at 7:30 in the Schiff lounge
— complete with colored spotlights
borrowed from the drama department
— grants a stage for all would-be
artists.
For example, try an interactive epi
dermal art experience — something
you'll never find in the DeYoung. In
this act, a performer removed his shirt,
allowing audience members to slather
his body with paint. Accompanying
the tactile display were discordant
notes on the piano.
Better than "Star Search?" Ed
McMahon undoubtedly laments what
he's missing. One can only speculate
how many times he has yearned to
paint the bodies of his performers. Epi
dermal interactive art would be defi
nite four-star material.
Schiff s famous forum began long
before Res Ed approved Schiff as the
performing arts focus house. In the
past, the dorm held cabaret nights of a
different flavor tabic cloths, wine and
polished performances. But absurdity
worketh its wily ways. Witness the de
generation (or regeneration) of perfor
mance, as the new open mike seduces
those to try their hand — or chest — at
entertaining.
Such is the case with Rich Hesp,
guitarist and vocalist for Fornaka. Be
fore his set, he told the audience, "I
don't like to sing. I don't like to sing. I

don't like to sing." Did it stop him? Do
black cows fly?
It's just too bad he wasn't wearing
ruby slippers and tapping his heels
when he said it. Then the show could
have been billed as "Oz Gone Awry."
For, in another act, focus assistant
Kevin Bleyer sang a unique rendition of
"Somewhere Over The Rainbow." Full
of sarcastic head-rolls and jazzy inter
ludes, this comic version of the song
would have made Judy Garland guffaw.
But not all acts are as silly as the har
monious heifer, the painted man or the
exaggerated Oz. At open-mike night,
the serious goes along with the silly. Se
nior Alyson Sharp's soprano perfor
mance of songs from "Phantom of the
Opera" brought a more somber note to
last Friday's show.
So far, half of the performers at
open mike nights have been Schiff resi
dents. Anywhere from 25 to 50 audi
ence members usually attend, and the
number of performers varies erratically
as well. The dorm welcomes artists
from the campus at large.
So, if you want to display your hid
den talents, contact one of the focus as
sistants: Kevin Bleyer, Karen Weitz
man, Doria Fan or dance-machine
Patty Kao. Don't be shy: Bleyer de
scribes the event as "inclusive," which
means that anything goes.
