All I see are black cows
All I need are black cows
I'm in love with black cows.
Drummer Jack Bowen composed
these deep lyrics in the third grade. At
that point he didn't realize he would be
fast on his way to becoming the Mor

rissey of the mQk scene. In only a few
short years, he would be performing
this loud, thrashing opus under a spot
light in front of a crowd of screaming
fans.
Fornaka, Bo wen's newly formed
band, made its debut last Friday at
SchifFs open-mike night. And the
bovine angst number proved a better

he's missing. One can only speculate
how many times he has yearned to
paint the bodies of his performers. Epi
dermal interactive art would be defi
nite four-star material.
Schiff s famous forum began long
before Res Ed approved Schiff as the
performing arts focus house. In the
past, the dorm held cabaret nights of a
different flavor tabic cloths, wine and
polished performances. But absurdity
worketh its wily ways. Witness the de
generation (or regeneration) of perfor
mance, as the new open mike seduces
those to try their hand — or chest — at
entertaining.
Such is the case with Rich Hesp,
guitarist and vocalist for Fornaka. Be
fore his set, he told the audience, "I
don't like to sing. I don't like to sing. I
