## Solo Woolf 
### 
If Virginia Woolf were in charge of the draw, it
would be really hard for a guy to get a single. M A
Room of One's Own" explores female poverty and
artistic expression as well as androgyny and the as
sumption of non-traditional gender roles.
Directed by Richard Schoch and featuring
scathingly scintillating senior Miranda Hope as
Virginia Woolf, this one-woman show deals with a
text which is still as controversial as it once was.
Being the sole focus of the show will be an in
teresting feat for Hope, whose sole focus this past
summer was Woolf. Hope spent her summer in
England retracing Woolf's footsteps through Lon
don, Cambridge and the West Country in prepara
tion for this role, and also enjoying some large
glasses of dark beer.
Hope's work will be showcased Nov. 11-14 at 8
p.m. and Nov. 15 at 2 p.m. at the Nitery. Tickets are
$5 for students and seniors and $9 for less impor
tant people.
