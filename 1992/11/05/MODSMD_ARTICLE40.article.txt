# Food follies
## 
### 
Thursday night, at 6 in the evening, large
amounts of food will appear at Wilbur Hall's
cafeteria. A little later, a lot of it will still be
there.
Then, perhaps, a small bit of it will form a rebel
organization, resist attempts to be scooped, and
scurry away to live underneath Wilbur field. And a
lot of food will wind up half-eaten on dishes in a
sink somewhere else.
Encore engagements are scheduled for every
evening until the end of the quarter. Contact Food
Service for more information.
