# The 						last word On...
## ...fashion?

Forget pocket protectors.
Forget slide rules.
Today's techie walks softly and carries a
Power [look. Indeed, techie fashion is much
more modern than a lot of people would think.
For example, typical techie-wear includes
jeans and a T-shirt. Granted, the T-shirt is
probably very faded and wrinkled from hours

spent in the computer cluster or at the desk
bent over problem sets. But darn it, it's fashion.
The clean-cut, clean-shaven techie with
a part down the middle of his hair no longer
exists. Without time to go to Flicks, let alone
get a haircut, today's tcchies are more likely to
resemble members of grunge rock bands or
Shaggy from "Scooby-Doo."

Some people might think it's laziness, cre
ativity or motivation. But the true inspiration
for techie fashion stems from lack of time—
they're far too busy solving the worlds prob
lems that other people are only writing about.
So don't call it lack of hygiene — call it
art.
