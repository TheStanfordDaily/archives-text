t's like sitting in a
I class that's tele-
I vised on SITN, ex
cept your professor is
singing and the televi
sions look weird. U2's
Zoo Tour comes to
Oakland Coliseum,
and, whether you have
general admission
tickets or reserved
seating, this is guaran
teed to be a show you
won't want to miss —
especially since U2 is
soon off to Ireland.
If you haven't
found tickets yet, you

might be able to find some in the classifieds, or
at the Oakland Coliseum the day of the con
cert. The Tresidder message board also keeps
listings of students trying to sell tickets. If you
can pull it off, be prepared for a great show.
And leave your remote control at home.

Hip Hop Happenings

If one of your midterm questions asked
where the hip-hop action was, a correct an
swer would be, "The Coffee House, Friday
Nov. 6,8 p.m. til midnight." Rapidly becom
ing a Coffee House tradition, Hip-Hop
Night this Friday will feature DJ Kut Masta
Kurt (try saying that three times fast!) along
with KZSU's own DJ Liquid. It's free. It's also
a perfect chance to get free CDs, cassettes, T
shirts and condoms... .and to recover your
lost social life from the dark clutches of your
mid-quarter exams.

If you can't be at U2...

It's Nov. 7, and all of your friends are in
Oakland with a guy named Bono. Well, don't
just sit at home. Prepare for six hours of
madness. U.S. and U.K. dance chartbusters,
The Shamcn and Utah Saints, will be in con
cert together at the Warfield — a great
chance to get a feel for the rave scene, with
out the fear of police dragging you off.
The show will also feature Terence
McKenna, a modern day thinker, as a special
guest. But don't think things will be slow.
With thousands of watts pumped into daz
zling visual displays, who needs the Zoo Tour
anyways?
