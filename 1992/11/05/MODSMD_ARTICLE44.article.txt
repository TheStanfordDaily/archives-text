# 'Til death — or financial woes — do us part
## 
### 
There comes a time when you
have to walk forward and em
brace your future like it was
your rich, fiat aunt. Close your eyes,
hold your breath and pray for a check
with a rainbow on it.

Luckily, that time hasn't come yet.
But it will. And if you don't pre
pare, youU be as sorry as you were,
when you found out they already cast
the new Brady Bunch movie. So get off
your haunches and find a wife. Or the
appropriately gendered mate of your
choice. I'm going with wife. Worked
for Billy Joel. And I'm better looking.
Finding a wife is one of the two
most important things you can do
while you're at Stanford. The other is
complex and concerns explosives and
the keys to Ed Meese's office. Stick
with the wife thing.
Marry early. Your grandparents
married before puberty, and they're

gumming their way to Valhalla.
Senior year is much too late to start
looking. Every Thursday night, in a
desperate attempt to justify this "Se
nior President" scam, 100 people get
dressed up, go to a local bar and talk to
the people they ate dinner with.
The vast majority of them are looking
to tie that big, ugly knot Because if they
don't find someone at Senior Pub Night,
they'll find them at another bar. And they
won't have half the earning potential.
That's right If you marry a Stan
fordite, your cash flow is effectively
doubled. Especially if you're willing to
walk over to the trailer park and feign
interest in graduate-level physics.
Buying a big, gaudy, Tom Shane

sized engagement ring for your secre
tary may sound romantic in a dement
ed Arnie Becker kind of way, but it'll
do nothing for that second home. It
also might land you in front of the Sen
ate Judiciary Committee.
Because, unless you're willing to
chance it and see what happens when
Chelsea's braces come off, waiting a cou
ple of years will only reduce your power
rating in the great game of life. Odds are,
youU have to sell the cattle ranch.
So, for those of you too busy to do
the research yourself, I've set up this
convenient, easy-to-read question
naire. Keep it on you at all times and
bring it into conversation as smoothly
as you did the Purity Test:

Call it a marriage of conve
nience. Call it recession
love. Call it Mr. Happy. I
don't care.
I just want what's best for
you.
And if that means applying
Rogaine with one hand and
paging through a mail order
bride catalog with the other, so
be it.
There's always "Studs."
Amorfati, baby.

Joel Stein loves you. His col
umn will continue to appear
here weekly to justify that.
