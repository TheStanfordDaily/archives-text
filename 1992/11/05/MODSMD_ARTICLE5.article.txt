Ever consider majoring in applied ethics? Or
decision engineering? How about architectural
mechanics and design?
Don't bother flipping through Courses and
Degrees. You won't find any of these majors
there. In fact, they didn't even exist until they
were created by students in the Individually
Designed Program.
IDM provides an alternative for undergrad
uates whose degree goals don't mesh with es
tablished departments or programs. Students
can combine classes from various disciplines to
create mtyors that interest them.
"I think about I IDM) as a chooae-your-own
adventure book," said Peter Liang, a junior who
designed a mtyor in architectural mechanics and
design. "There's an ending you want to reach
and you fill in the blank pages to get there."
Senior Michelle Meilo used the IDM program

to prune away courses that didn't interest her.
"Originally I was majoring in political sci
ence and philosophy," Mello said. "Then 1 real
ized that the only thing I liked about philoso
phy was the ethics." So she kept political sci
ence, dropped philosophy and designed a sec
ond major in applied ethics.
Senior Kyle Dick had the opposite problem.
He worried that the demanding requirements
of an engineering degree left little opportunity
to explore other disciplines.
"I got to a point in my sophomore year
where I really hated my (engineering prerequi
site) classes and wanted to do something differ
ent," Dick said. "A friend told me why not de
sign your own mqjor. And it hit me. . why not
take classes that I want to?"
According to the IDM program coordinator
Hector Cuevas, only about 15 students a year
graduate with individually designed majors,
partly because of the involved application
process. Applicants are required to submit a

proposal including a description of the pro
posed and a list of courses that would
would be taken. Then, after meeting with
Cuevas, applicants must select a total of three
faculty advisors of of whom only two can be
from the same department.
These advisors must assess the application
and write letters of recommendation for the
student before the proposal will be considered
by the Program Committee.
"It's a very rigorous review," Cuevas said.
"The student has to demonstrate that the pro
posed field of study can't be done within any ex
isting mt\jor or department. The burden of
proof is on the student."
Each IDM consists of at least 60 units of
courses numbered 100 and above, but Cuevas
said that most students take between 80 and
100 units. The course list must achieve breadth
and depth commensurate with other degrees.
