Ever consider majoring in applied ethics? Or
decision engineering? How about architectural
mechanics and design?
Don't bother flipping through Courses and
Degrees. You won't find any of these majors
there. In fact, they didn't even exist until they
were created by students in the Individually
Designed Program.
IDM provides an alternative for undergrad
uates whose degree goals don't mesh with es
tablished departments or programs. Students
can combine classes from various disciplines to
create mtyors that interest them.
"I think about I IDM) as a chooae-your-own
adventure book," said Peter Liang, a junior who
designed a mtyor in architectural mechanics and
design. "There's an ending you want to reach
and you fill in the blank pages to get there."
Senior Michelle Meilo used the IDM program

to prune away courses that didn't interest her.
"Originally I was majoring in political sci
ence and philosophy," Mello said. "Then 1 real
ized that the only thing I liked about philoso
phy was the ethics." So she kept political sci
ence, dropped philosophy and designed a sec
ond major in applied ethics.
Senior Kyle Dick had the opposite problem.
He worried that the demanding requirements
of an engineering degree left little opportunity
to explore other disciplines.
"I got to a point in my sophomore year
where I really hated my (engineering prerequi
site) classes and wanted to do something differ
ent," Dick said. "A friend told me why not de
sign your own mqjor. And it hit me. . why not
take classes that I want to?"
According to the IDM program coordinator
Hector Cuevas, only about 15 students a year
graduate with individually designed majors,
partly because of the involved application
process. Applicants are required to submit a

proposal including a description of the pro
posed and a list of courses that would
would be taken. Then, after meeting with
Cuevas, applicants must select a total of three
faculty advisors of of whom only two can be
from the same department.
These advisors must assess the application
and write letters of recommendation for the
student before the proposal will be considered
by the Program Committee.
"It's a very rigorous review," Cuevas said.
"The student has to demonstrate that the pro
posed field of study can't be done within any ex
isting mt\jor or department. The burden of
proof is on the student."
Each IDM consists of at least 60 units of
courses numbered 100 and above, but Cuevas
said that most students take between 80 and
100 units. The course list must achieve breadth
and depth commensurate with other degrees.
"The most difficult part was
picking out the course schedule,"
said Mello. "You have to come up
with your whole schedule for the
next two to three years."
The application process and
stringent degree requirements
are enough to deter three out of
four interested students, accord
ing to Cuevas. Students said it
takes special qualities to perse
vere.
"It starts with knowing
enough about yourself and know
ing what you want to do," Liang
said.
"The whole process requires
ambition. You definitely have to
set a goal."
Mello agreed, saying "The first
thing is to be real sure you can't
get what you want from a depart
ment or program."
It also helps to be a little inde
pendent. IDM students take class
es with other students, but they
are alone in their pursuit of their
designed degrees. Of the three
IDM students interviewed for this
article, only one said he knew
another IDM student.
"One drawback is that you
don't have a department," Dick

said. "Nobody else is doing what
you're doing. You can't talk to
other people about what you're
going to do after you graduate."
Mello said that she might not
feel so comfortable with IDM if
she wasn't simultaneously major
ing in political science.
"You feel kind of homeless,"
Mello said. "If I didn't have
another major I could just imag
ine myself wandering around at
graduation."
Liang cited the lack of interac
tion with other IDM students as
a fault of the program, and sug
gested that IDM should act more
like a department, with functions
and support mechanisms. Liang
even said he would be willing to
have interested students
referred to him for information
or advice.
Students agreed that lack of
familiarity with the program
makes many of their peers skepti
cal of IDM's legitimacy.
"People are surprised that I
can design a major, take classes I
want to and that it will actually
mean something," Liang said.
"But IDM isn't about using the
system to find an easier way of
fulfilling a major. It's definitely
not a way out."
Mello agreed, saying it would
be easier for her to pursue just a
political science degree without

the double mqjor in ethics. But
she acknowledged that even she
was suspicious of some of the
IDMs that have been approved.
"Some are like the 'unmajor,' "
she said.
Program coordinator Cuevas
disputes that notion, saying that
while most of the applications
that reach the committee are
strong and well-supported, the
committee rejects proposals every
year.
Liang, Mello and Dick each
said their proposals were accepted
on the first try.
All three were very apprecia
tive of the program, saying that
without IDM they would have had
to compromise by pursuing less
interesting and less personally
relevant majors.
All three talked about being
impressed by the University's
willingness to promote individual
ity, and the tremendous coopera
tion they received from their
advisers.
Given the parallel nature of
their experiences, and the harmo
ny of their opinions, it wasn't sur
prising that, when asked to
describe a frustrating experience
related to IDM, each hit upon a
common theme.
Dick summed it up: "I've got
ten a little sick of explaining to
people what my major is."

These advisors must assess the application
and write letters of recommendation for the
student before the proposal will be considered
by the Program Committee.
"It's a very rigorous review," Cuevas said.
"The student has to demonstrate that the pro
posed field of study can't be done within any ex
isting mt\jor or department. The burden of
proof is on the student."
Each IDM consists of at least 60 units of
courses numbered 100 and above, but Cuevas
said that most students take between 80 and
100 units. The course list must achieve breadth
and depth commensurate with other degrees.
"The most difficult part was
picking out the course schedule,"
said Mello. "You have to come up
with your whole schedule for the
next two to three years."
The application process and
stringent degree requirements
are enough to deter three out of
four interested students, accord
ing to Cuevas. Students said it
takes special qualities to perse
vere.
"It starts with knowing
enough about yourself and know
ing what you want to do," Liang
said.
"The whole process requires
ambition. You definitely have to
set a goal."
Mello agreed, saying "The first
thing is to be real sure you can't
get what you want from a depart
ment or program."
It also helps to be a little inde
pendent. IDM students take class
es with other students, but they
are alone in their pursuit of their
designed degrees. Of the three
IDM students interviewed for this
article, only one said he knew
another IDM student.
"One drawback is that you
don't have a department," Dick

said. "Nobody else is doing what
you're doing. You can't talk to
other people about what you're
going to do after you graduate."
Mello said that she might not
feel so comfortable with IDM if
she wasn't simultaneously major
ing in political science.
"You feel kind of homeless,"
Mello said. "If I didn't have
another major I could just imag
ine myself wandering around at
graduation."
Liang cited the lack of interac
tion with other IDM students as
a fault of the program, and sug
gested that IDM should act more
like a department, with functions
and support mechanisms. Liang
even said he would be willing to
have interested students
referred to him for information
or advice.
Students agreed that lack of
familiarity with the program
makes many of their peers skepti
cal of IDM's legitimacy.
"People are surprised that I
can design a major, take classes I
want to and that it will actually
mean something," Liang said.
"But IDM isn't about using the
system to find an easier way of
fulfilling a major. It's definitely
not a way out."
Mello agreed, saying it would
be easier for her to pursue just a
political science degree without

the double mqjor in ethics. But
she acknowledged that even she
was suspicious of some of the
IDMs that have been approved.
"Some are like the 'unmajor,' "
she said.
Program coordinator Cuevas
disputes that notion, saying that
while most of the applications
that reach the committee are
strong and well-supported, the
committee rejects proposals every
year.
Liang, Mello and Dick each
said their proposals were accepted
on the first try.
All three were very apprecia
tive of the program, saying that
without IDM they would have had
to compromise by pursuing less
interesting and less personally
relevant majors.
All three talked about being
impressed by the University's
willingness to promote individual
ity, and the tremendous coopera
tion they received from their
advisers.
Given the parallel nature of
their experiences, and the harmo
ny of their opinions, it wasn't sur
prising that, when asked to
describe a frustrating experience
related to IDM, each hit upon a
common theme.
Dick summed it up: "I've got
ten a little sick of explaining to
people what my major is."
Ever consider majoring in applied ethics? Or
decision engineering? How about architectural
mechanics and design?
Don't bother flipping through Courses and
Degrees. You won't find any of these majors
there. In fact, they didn't even exist until they
were created by students in the Individually
Designed Program.
IDM provides an alternative for undergrad
uates whose degree goals don't mesh with es
tablished departments or programs. Students
can combine classes from various disciplines to
create mtyors that interest them.
"I think about I IDM) as a chooae-your-own
adventure book," said Peter Liang, a junior who
designed a mtyor in architectural mechanics and
design. "There's an ending you want to reach
and you fill in the blank pages to get there."
Senior Michelle Meilo used the IDM program

to prune away courses that didn't interest her.
"Originally I was majoring in political sci
ence and philosophy," Mello said. "Then 1 real
ized that the only thing I liked about philoso
phy was the ethics." So she kept political sci
ence, dropped philosophy and designed a sec
ond major in applied ethics.
Senior Kyle Dick had the opposite problem.
He worried that the demanding requirements
of an engineering degree left little opportunity
to explore other disciplines.
"I got to a point in my sophomore year
where I really hated my (engineering prerequi
site) classes and wanted to do something differ
ent," Dick said. "A friend told me why not de
sign your own mqjor. And it hit me. . why not
take classes that I want to?"
According to the IDM program coordinator
Hector Cuevas, only about 15 students a year
graduate with individually designed majors,
partly because of the involved application
process. Applicants are required to submit a

proposal including a description of the pro
posed and a list of courses that would
would be taken. Then, after meeting with
Cuevas, applicants must select a total of three
faculty advisors of of whom only two can be
from the same department.
These advisors must assess the application
and write letters of recommendation for the
student before the proposal will be considered
by the Program Committee.
"It's a very rigorous review," Cuevas said.
