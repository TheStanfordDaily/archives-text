# Meyer to reopen today

### Carrie Chang Editorial staff 
A newly remodeled Meyer Library re
opens today after five months and more
than $500,000 worth of renovations.
"I think it's quite an improvement,"
said Joan Krasner, head of Access Ser
vices. "It's been improved in a number of
ways — the ground floor will be very well
used.
"There is new equipment in the lan
guage lab. It's much lighter and airier,"
she added.
Most conspicuous among the changes
in the new library setup is the circulation
staff and reserve area, now located on the
ground floor.
"It's very pretty. .. . The whole lobby
was done," said senior Gennie Ruskus,
who works at Meyer's circulation desk.
"There's a lot of blue. .. . There are pil
lars and new carpet."
The second floor, which has been open
since early October, houses the language
lab, media desk, computer cluster and
computer classroom.
Meyer's 85,000 volumes have been
consolidated on the third floor.
The fourth floor will be the future

home of the library's acquisition and ser
ial processing staff, which needs to relo
cate from its current space in Green Li
brary which suffered earthquake dam
age.
"There really isn't very much of a dif
ference except for the fact that the books
are all on the third floor now," said
Ruskus. The only other significant
change that she noted was that reference
services will no longer be available at
Meyer.
"Students will have to go to Green for
reference, or use Socrates, which is a little
less convenient," she said.
"Meyer has always been my favorite li
brary. I was really upset when I heard
they were changing it," said senior Debo
rah Martinez. "They messed up the
fourth floor, so now the third one will be
more crowded."
"There's somewhat less studying
space, necessitating the use of fourth
floor staff offices due to the earthquake
damaged Green west wing," explained
Krasner.
"I think the fact that it's taken so long
has been a disservice to the students, but
it's great that's it's open now, and we'll
just have to see how it goes," said Ruskus.
