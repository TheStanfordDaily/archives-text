## Higher Education Act reauthorization changes guidelines, complicates financial aid process 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Three months before the financial aid
filing deadline for new students, appli
cants for 1993-94 don't know how to
apply for University funds. And the Fi
nancial Aids Office doesn't either.
Congress' recent reauthorization of
the Higher Education Act has the Finan
cial Aids Office scrambling to adjust to
changes in federal guidelines before dead
lines arrive.
Last summer, Congress enacted legis
lation that extends federal financial aid to
more families.
Some of the new provisions raised in
come ceilings for students seeking Pell
Grants, instituted a free application
process for federal funds, and removed
home equity from the federal govern
ment's need analysis formula.
However, Congress failed to appropri
ate more money to federal grant and loan
programs to cover the increased demand

for federal financial aid, leaving schools to
make up the difference with their own
funds, according to Assistant Director of
the Financial Aids Office Cynthia Rife.
In the past, Stanford used federal
guidelines to determine need and collect
ed supplementary information to deter
mine how to apportion University funds
above and beyond required federal funds.
But Rife said Stanford can't afford to
use the new federal guidelines when de
termining University aid, and, under fed
eral law, it doesn't have to.
"Students are going to show more need
at the federal level, but that isn't what
Stanford will do with its money," Rife
said. "I can't see us sticking to [federal
guidelines] because they would increase
the demand on our funds tremendously."
Tightening times
In fact, unlike Congress, Stanford will
tighten its definition of need for next
year's applicants.
"This year for the first time,
if a student has a sibling in
school, [the Financial Aids
Office] will look at the actual
cost of the sibling's education,"
Rife said.
Under the previous system, if a
Stanford student had a sibling at
UC-Berkeley, for example, and
Stanford determined the total
family contribution to be $30,000,
the University would simply
divide the figure in half and
expect the family to contribute
$15,000 to Stanford.
Next year, however, Stanford
will look at the actual family con
tribution to the sibling's educa
tion — in this case, $10,000 —
before determining the family
contribution to Stanford — in
this case, $20,000.
If a sibling attends a private
school, Stanford will follow its
former policy of splitting the con
tribution in half — even if the
school is more expensive than
Stanford.
Stanford will continue to con

sider certain economic factors —
such as home equity — that the
federal government will now dis
count.
More forms
The new federal guidelines
complicate Stanford's application
process as well.
Rather than filling out one
form determining need for both
federal and Stanford aid, students
must now complete two or more
forms.
Previously, private processing
companies such as the College
Scholarship Service charged stu
dents a fee before evaluating their
circumstances and determining
their need.
But Congress has mandated
that the application process be
free to everyone who wishes to
receive financial aid.
In order to guarantee this, the
federal government has issued a
new application form exclusively
for federal funds for the 1993-94
school year.
The new form eliminates the
need for the multiple forms used
in the past — the Student Aid
Application for California (SAAC)
for California residents and the
Financial Aid Form (FAF) for

everyone else.
Students may apply through
one of three private processing
companies, all of which will follow
federal aid guidelines when deter
mining need.
Because federal guidelines
have become more lenient, Stan
ford may create its own financial
aid form and request that stu
dents submit it to the College
Scholarship Service for process
ing, Rife said.
If the Financial Aids Office
were to come out with a separate
form, private processing compa
nies would have to process the
separate form in addition to the
free federal applications.
Companies may still charge
processing fees for private insti
tutions' forms. And these prices
will likely be inflated to cover the
cost of processing the free federal
forms, saddling Stanford stu
dents — and other students
whose colleges require they sub
mit a separate form — with the
extra cost.
Fortunately, Congress also
mandated that processors such as
the College Scholarship Service
can charge schools only the
marginal costs of processing extra
data, according to Rife.
