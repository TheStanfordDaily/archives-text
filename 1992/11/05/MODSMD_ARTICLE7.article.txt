## Higher Education Act reauthorization changes guidelines, complicates financial aid process 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
Three months before the financial aid
filing deadline for new students, appli
cants for 1993-94 don't know how to
apply for University funds. And the Fi
nancial Aids Office doesn't either.
Congress' recent reauthorization of
the Higher Education Act has the Finan
cial Aids Office scrambling to adjust to
changes in federal guidelines before dead
lines arrive.
Last summer, Congress enacted legis
lation that extends federal financial aid to
more families.
Some of the new provisions raised in
come ceilings for students seeking Pell
Grants, instituted a free application
process for federal funds, and removed
home equity from the federal govern
ment's need analysis formula.
However, Congress failed to appropri
ate more money to federal grant and loan
programs to cover the increased demand

for federal financial aid, leaving schools to
make up the difference with their own
funds, according to Assistant Director of
the Financial Aids Office Cynthia Rife.
In the past, Stanford used federal
guidelines to determine need and collect
ed supplementary information to deter
mine how to apportion University funds
above and beyond required federal funds.
But Rife said Stanford can't afford to
use the new federal guidelines when de
termining University aid, and, under fed
eral law, it doesn't have to.
"Students are going to show more need
at the federal level, but that isn't what
Stanford will do with its money," Rife
said. "I can't see us sticking to [federal
guidelines] because they would increase
the demand on our funds tremendously."
Tightening times
In fact, unlike Congress, Stanford will
tighten its definition of need for next
