# Recruits remain strong

### John Borland 
Despite a struggling econ
omy and cutbacks in most
major industries, corporate
recruiting on campus re
mains strong, according to
coordinators at the Career
Planning and Placement
Center.
While recruiters are visit
ing fewer campuses nation
wide and hiring fewer people
overall, the number of poten
tial employers visiting Stan
ford has remained fairly con
stant.
According to Rachel
Hahn, coordinator of recruit
ment activities for the CPPC,
fewer companies expressed
interest in recruiting on cam
pus last year than in previous
years, but more students
were granted interviews. She
said the level will likely re
main steady this year.
However, the current re
cession is having a signifi
cant effect on hiring and re
cruitment practices.
"There are less jobs out
there, and people will spend
a longer time looking before
they find them," said Hahn.
"Employers are forced to be
more selective."
This trend is not limited
to American companies.
Daniel Malone, a recruiter
for Toshiba Japan, said his
company is no longer ex
panding its employee base.
"We have held the num
bers the same this year, and
we're projecting almost the
same for next year," he said,
adding that this is the first
year the Tokyo firm has felt
the effects of the recession.
Economic downsizing and
defense cuts are other forces
impacting recruitment patterns
on campus, said Hahn. "The big
companies — AT&T, General
Motors, Hewlett-Packard —
aren't setting up as many [inter
views]. The real growth areas are
smaller and start-up companies."
But a few large companies have
recently expanded hiring, she
said, citing Wells Fargo and Proc
tor and Gamble as examples.
Downsizing has shifted the
emphasis in campus visitations
from speculative hiring to "real

time" recruiting, Hahn said.
Companies now schedule inter
views in response to the number
of positions actually needed,
rather than interview for a larger
number of projected future
spots.
The fall interview process has
been shortened by a week and the
spring session lengthened to com
pensate for lower levels of early
job offers, Hahn said.
The recession has also drawn
unprecedented numbers of stu
dents to the CPPC. "I've never
seen it this busy this early," said
Hahn.
"This senior class is very
intense about the job search.
What we're seeing is the first

class that came in anticipating
recession and has had four years
to deal with it," she said.
"We are at a great place, get
ting a great education, but there
are a lot of people with great edu
cations and more experience,"
said Katherine Lehrer, a senior
currently in the interview pro
cess. "It's tougher to get a job —
companies don't have the budgets
any more."
Hahn said that students not
yet involved in the job search pro
cess have not "missed out.
"Wait until the time seems
right," she said. "Things have
happened, but things are always
happening. We'll be here all
year."
