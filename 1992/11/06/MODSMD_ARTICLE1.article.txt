# Snip, clip, cut, trim and buzz
## Legendary Branner haircutter shears her way to salon fame, scissors status 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Like a modern-day Delilah, sopho
more Shan Liu brings the buzzing clip
pers to sophomore Phil Darringer's
crowning glory — seconds later, dirty
blond locks fall to the Daily-covered floor
of her Schiff dorm room.
Darringer is having his hair cut by Liu
for the third time since he first discovered
"Salon Shan" last year in Branner Hall.
Liu's legendary fame started mush
rooming after she offered to trim a slight
ly shaggy neighbor's 'do. Word of mouth
took care of the advertising, and soon Liu
was taking Friday and Saturday nights
off to meet the demand.
According to a list Liu keeps of every
haircut she's done since she and her clip
pers arrived on campus, she has cut 119
heads of hair, not including Darringer
and the three other former Brannerites
waiting in the hall last Friday.
Chatting like customers at a small

town barber shop, sophomores Tas
Toochinda, Nat Pearson and Chad Stew
ard sit in the hall and reminisce about
their days in Branner when they were
carefree freshmen and Liu made house
calls to residents' dorm rooms.
"I went to Shan because I saw the re
sults of her haircuts (on other residents)
and I knew she did a good job," Toochin
da says, comfortably reclining in the hall
way and strumming a guitar.
"Also it's cheap," Pearson adds.
Liu says she doesn't charge, but ac
cepts tips — ranging "between zero and
10 dollars" — and dinner and movie dates
in exchange for her haircuts.
"Where else can you get your hair cut
and get to go out on a 'date'?" Pearson
says.
So have any of Liu's haircuts led to ro
mance?
"Guess not," she says, laughing sardon
ically as Darringer's sideburns swiftly
meet their doom. "But I can trace most of
my friendships from last year to a haircut."

Darringer and the waiting clientele in
the hallway all agree that "Salon Shan"
— as named by one former Branner resi
dent — earned its distinction because of
Liu's personal touch.
"Usually, having your hair cut by
Shan is like sitting on a psychiatrist's
couch," says Darringer. "I can tell her my
problems."
Toochinda adds, "It's because she can
feel the lumps in your head and read your
mind."
On a slightly more earnest note, Stew
ard complains that "other haircutters
choke you with that collar thing."
"But Shan is always gentle," he says.
Less than 20 minutes after she start
ed, Liu expertly puts the finishing touch
es on Darringer's neatly trimmed tresses,
and Toochinda steps into his place.
Liu gives her clippers a couple of shots
of WD-40, and confidently begins the
process again.

Sophomore Shan Liu satisfies one more customer with a spiffy style on the second floor of Schiff yesterday.
Liu says she first learned how
to cut hair from her dad, who
taught her to cut his hair so he
wouldn't have to go to the barber.
Haircutting is very much a tra
dition in the Liu family — Shan
has her hair cut by her sister.
Since she started cutting hair,
Liu has not made any mqjor mis
takes, she says.
"There was only once when I
used the wrong guard (for the
clippers) but no one noticed," she
recalls.
Whether her psychiatric skills
or her expertise were responsible,
Liu's success in Branner is unde

niable.
Happy customers started a
"testimonial board" outside Liu's
door, with rave reviews like the
one Pearson submitted last year:
"The scissors, obviously in the
hands of a virtuoso, flashed. My
locks tumbled to the floor.. .those
locks took with them my worries
and cares."
Her fame was confirmed when
a student who worked for"The
Good Life At Stanford" directory
offered to list "Salon Shan."
"It didn't work out because I'm
not a licensed business," Liu says.
However, the most important
thing to Liu is that cutting hair is
fun, so she maintains her sense of
humor.
"It's funny how this little
hobby exploded into something

that's a big part of my life," she
says.
With fame, enthusiastic
reviews and a faithful clientele, it
would seem that Liu has achieved
the pinnacle of her haircutting
career.
Yet, like all Stanford over
achievers, Liu has higher aspira
tions.
"She wants to cut Gerhard
Casper's hair," Pearson says, as
Liu's eyes light up at the thought
of taking the clippers to the Uni
versity President's crowning
glory.
"That would be awesome!" she
says.
But in an uncharacteristic
lapse of confidence in her abili
ties, Liu adds, "What if I screw
up? I'd be so nervous."

feel the lumps in your head and read your
mind."
On a slightly more earnest note, Stew
ard complains that "other haircutters
choke you with that collar thing."
"But Shan is always gentle," he says.
Less than 20 minutes after she start
ed, Liu expertly puts the finishing touch

and Toochinda steps into his place.
Liu gives her clippers a couple of shots
of WD-40, and confidently begins the
process again.

Sophomore Shan Liu satisfies one more customer with a spiffy style on the second floor of Schiff yesterday.
Liu says she first learned how
to cut hair from her dad, who
taught her to cut his hair so he
wouldn't have to go to the barber.
Haircutting is very much a tra
dition in the Liu family — Shan
has her hair cut by her sister.
Since she started cutting hair,
Liu has not made any mqjor mis
takes, she says.
"There was only once when I
used the wrong guard (for the
clippers) but no one noticed," she
recalls.
Whether her psychiatric skills
or her expertise were responsible,
Liu's success in Branner is unde

niable.
Happy customers started a
"testimonial board" outside Liu's
door, with rave reviews like the
one Pearson submitted last year:
"The scissors, obviously in the
hands of a virtuoso, flashed. My
locks tumbled to the floor.. .those
locks took with them my worries
and cares."
Her fame was confirmed when
a student who worked for"The
Good Life At Stanford" directory
offered to list "Salon Shan."
"It didn't work out because I'm
not a licensed business," Liu says.
However, the most important
thing to Liu is that cutting hair is
fun, so she maintains her sense of
humor.
"It's funny how this little
hobby exploded into something

that's a big part of my life," she
says.
With fame, enthusiastic
reviews and a faithful clientele, it
would seem that Liu has achieved
the pinnacle of her haircutting
career.
Yet, like all Stanford over
achievers, Liu has higher aspira
tions.
"She wants to cut Gerhard
Casper's hair," Pearson says, as
Liu's eyes light up at the thought
of taking the clippers to the Uni
versity President's crowning
glory.
"That would be awesome!" she
says.
But in an uncharacteristic
lapse of confidence in her abili
ties, Liu adds, "What if I screw
up? I'd be so nervous."
Like a modern-day Delilah, sopho
more Shan Liu brings the buzzing clip
pers to sophomore Phil Darringer's
crowning glory — seconds later, dirty
blond locks fall to the Daily-covered floor
of her Schiff dorm room.
Darringer is having his hair cut by Liu
for the third time since he first discovered
"Salon Shan" last year in Branner Hall.
Liu's legendary fame started mush
rooming after she offered to trim a slight
ly shaggy neighbor's 'do. Word of mouth
took care of the advertising, and soon Liu
was taking Friday and Saturday nights
off to meet the demand.
According to a list Liu keeps of every
haircut she's done since she and her clip
pers arrived on campus, she has cut 119
heads of hair, not including Darringer
and the three other former Brannerites
waiting in the hall last Friday.
Chatting like customers at a small

town barber shop, sophomores Tas
Toochinda, Nat Pearson and Chad Stew
ard sit in the hall and reminisce about
their days in Branner when they were
carefree freshmen and Liu made house
calls to residents' dorm rooms.
"I went to Shan because I saw the re
sults of her haircuts (on other residents)
and I knew she did a good job," Toochin
da says, comfortably reclining in the hall
way and strumming a guitar.
"Also it's cheap," Pearson adds.
Liu says she doesn't charge, but ac
cepts tips — ranging "between zero and
10 dollars" — and dinner and movie dates
in exchange for her haircuts.
"Where else can you get your hair cut
and get to go out on a 'date'?" Pearson
says.
So have any of Liu's haircuts led to ro
mance?
"Guess not," she says, laughing sardon
ically as Darringer's sideburns swiftly
meet their doom. "But I can trace most of
my friendships from last year to a haircut."

Darringer and the waiting clientele in
the hallway all agree that "Salon Shan"
— as named by one former Branner resi
dent — earned its distinction because of
Liu's personal touch.
"Usually, having your hair cut by
Shan is like sitting on a psychiatrist's
couch," says Darringer. "I can tell her my
problems."
Toochinda adds, "It's because she can
feel the lumps in your head and read your
mind."
On a slightly more earnest note, Stew
ard complains that "other haircutters
choke you with that collar thing."
"But Shan is always gentle," he says.

and Toochinda steps into his place.
