# Snip, clip, cut, trim and buzz
## Legendary Branner haircutter shears her way to salon fame, scissors status

Like a modern-day Delilah, sopho
more Shan Liu brings the buzzing clip
pers to sophomore Phil Darringer's
crowning glory — seconds later, dirty
blond locks fall to the Daily-covered floor
of her Schiff dorm room.
Darringer is having his hair cut by Liu
for the third time since he first discovered
"Salon Shan" last year in Branner Hall.
Liu's legendary fame started mush
rooming after she offered to trim a slight
ly shaggy neighbor's 'do. Word of mouth
took care of the advertising, and soon Liu
was taking Friday and Saturday nights
off to meet the demand.
According to a list Liu keeps of every
haircut she's done since she and her clip
pers arrived on campus, she has cut 119
heads of hair, not including Darringer
and the three other former Brannerites
waiting in the hall last Friday.
Chatting like customers at a small

town barber shop, sophomores Tas
Toochinda, Nat Pearson and Chad Stew
ard sit in the hall and reminisce about
their days in Branner when they were
carefree freshmen and Liu made house
calls to residents' dorm rooms.
"I went to Shan because I saw the re
sults of her haircuts (on other residents)
and I knew she did a good job," Toochin
da says, comfortably reclining in the hall
way and strumming a guitar.
"Also it's cheap," Pearson adds.
Liu says she doesn't charge, but ac
cepts tips — ranging "between zero and
10 dollars" — and dinner and movie dates
in exchange for her haircuts.
"Where else can you get your hair cut
and get to go out on a 'date'?" Pearson
says.
So have any of Liu's haircuts led to ro
mance?
"Guess not," she says, laughing sardon
ically as Darringer's sideburns swiftly
meet their doom. "But I can trace most of
my friendships from last year to a haircut."

Darringer and the waiting clientele in
the hallway all agree that "Salon Shan"
— as named by one former Branner resi
dent — earned its distinction because of
Liu's personal touch.
"Usually, having your hair cut by
Shan is like sitting on a psychiatrist's
couch," says Darringer. "I can tell her my
problems."
Toochinda adds, "It's because she can
feel the lumps in your head and read your
mind."
On a slightly more earnest note, Stew
ard complains that "other haircutters
choke you with that collar thing."
"But Shan is always gentle," he says.
Less than 20 minutes after she start
ed, Liu expertly puts the finishing touch
es on Darringer's neatly trimmed tresses,
and Toochinda steps into his place.
Liu gives her clippers a couple of shots
of WD-40, and confidently begins the
process again.
