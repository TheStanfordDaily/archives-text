# Ukraine may sell nuclear bombs

KIEV, Ukraine (AP) â€” Ukraine will sell
its strategic nuclear missiles to the
highest bidder if it so desires, a senior
official said yesterday.
The comments, which defied agree
ments with Russia and the West and
threatened to delay fulfillment of the
START treaty, reflected Ukraine's
unhappiness over its status after the
Soviet Union's collapse.
Igor Yukhnovsky, the first vice prime

minister, told a news conference the 176
strategic missiles on Ukrainian territo
ry belonged to the Ukrainian people and
would not be given up for free.
Under existing agreements on
putting the START treaty into effect,
140 of the missiles are to be transferred
to Russia by the end of 1994. But
Yukhnovsky said a price would have to
be agreed first.
"We can sell these nuclear warheads

to the highest bidder. . . to nuclear
states, that means Russia first of all, or
maybe another state, depending on
which pays most," Yukhnovsky said.
Among the former Soviet republics,
Ukraine has the largest concentration
of nuclear weapons outside Russia. It
has not yet ratified the START treaty
for reducing strategic nuclear missiles,
but Yukhnovsky said it still intended to
become a non-nuclear state.
