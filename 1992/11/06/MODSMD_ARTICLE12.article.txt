JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) - Debra
Lewis has a bullet lodged in her jaw and
can't hear out of her left ear, the effects
of a sniper attack on Interstate 295.
"When you go on 295 right now . . .
it's playing Russian roulette," she said
Thursday.
Such attacks and a fatal assault by
rock-throwers prompted the American
Automobile Association to warn
motorists away from the road ringing
the south and west sides of Jacksonville.

State officials and some business
owners are concerned the unusual
warning will harm Florida's image on
the eve of the winter tourist season,
though the state's own visitors' center
is advising motorists to avoid the road.
About 19 confirmed violent incidents
have been reported since June and 100
other reports are unconfirmed by police.
One motorist died July 4 when he was
hit in the head with a piece of concrete
and lost control of his car. There have

been no arrests.
Sheriff Jim McMillan said he is ask
ing the Florida National Guard for help
in providing night-vision equipment
and possibly troops to patrol the high
way.
"This is not vandalism or a malicious
act. This is attempted murder," he said.
Police suspect several people have
been involved, including copycats.
The bypass around Jacksonville car
ries about 80,000 vehicles a day.
