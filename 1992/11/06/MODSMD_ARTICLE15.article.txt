## Avoiding term limits 
### 
Use vote, not Constitution
to throw bums out of state
and national legislatures

INCUMBENCY IS FALLIBLE.
If there's one result of Bill
Clinton's victory that everyone
can agree on, it's that it demon
strated incumbents aren't guaran
teed re-election.
Nonetheless, the always para
doxical American electorate over
whelmingly approved state initia
tives in 14 states to limit the
terms of both national and state
senators and representatives.
Most measures restrict terms to
12 years.
Californians, by a 63 to 37 per
cent margin, voted to limit terms.
Despite this mandate, Congress
must resist pressure to draft a
Constitutional amendment impos
ing uniform national limits on the
service of senators and representa
tives.
As the public demonstrated in
the presidential election, the vot
ing booth — not the Constitution
— is the place where terms should
and can be limited.
Moreover, imposing unilateral
term limits overlooks the benefits
of incumbency. It takes years to
develop a thorough understanding
of the intricate problems and
issues facing our country.
Congress operates on a committee
system; developing expertise on a
committee is not something that
can be accomplished overnight.
Well-informed legislation pro
duced via the committee system is
in the interest of all; laws drafted
by groups of neophytes carry the
risk of lacking perspective and in
depth understanding of the under
lying complexities of any given
issue.
In addition to promoting reck
less legislation, the current state
by-state progression of term limits
undermines democracy by promot
ing an imbalance of power between
states. As the term limit move

ment takes root in some states and
not in others, states which reject
term limits will gain seniority and
power in Congress.
Senators and representatives
with limited terms will be ren
dered virtually powerless as they
are relegated to under-, sub- and
minor committees.
Even if Congress were to
sidestep the state-imbalance issue
by passing uniform term limits,
the constitutionality of such a
measure would be suspect. Cur
rently, the Constitution controls
eligibility for Federal offices and
specifies only age, citizenship and
residency as requirements for
members of Congress. Just as the
document can't require a candi
date to have competency or experi
ence, it should not exclude people
on these grounds either.
And the public, perhaps subcon
sciously, recognizes this. Despite
professing a desire to "throw the
bums out", voters handily re-elect
ed most veteran incumbents to
Congress. In California, all but one
or two of the 36 incumbent state
representative won re-election. Of
the 116 incumbents running in the
14 states that passed term limits,
only 6 lost. Nationally, only 19
incumbents were defeated.
The public is having its cake and
eating it too. Constituents have
their senior members wielding vast
influence as committee leaders and
acting in their interest, yet they're
smug with the feeling that they've
done something to "restore democ
racy to the people." But come 1998
— the first election in which some
officials will be denied ballot access
— voters may not be so willing to
usher out the old-timers.
To be sure, Congress can use a
transfusion of fresh blood. But
sending the system into shock
every 12 years by imposing uni
form term limits will not solve
this nation's ills. There's work to
be done, and just as new ideas are
needed, so is the seasoned wisdom
of this country's most experi
enced senators and representa
tives.
