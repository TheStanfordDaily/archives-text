## Try a little drowsiness 
### 
Earlier this week i had a
traumatic experience which made
me take a hard look at my life and
revaluate all the things I had taken for
granted.
While lifting weights at Gold's Gym, a
place where balding, acne-ridden men
force their bodies into shapes and sizes
Mother Nature never intended, I hurt my
neck. Later that night — after realizing
that even slight neck movements caused
excruciating pain — I was taken to Stan
ford Hospital.
A paramedic helped me into a bed in
the emergency room. On my left was a
small child who was constantly vomit
ing or crying. On my right was a man
whose blood alcohol level was seven
times the legal limit. As luck would
have it, my head was stuck facing
toward the right.
He kept insisting that he'd been
stabbed by men with ice picks, even
though there wasn't a mark on his body.
Because he had been coughing up blood,
his doctors decided to put a tube in his
nose to see if there was any internal
bleeding. He refused to take a tube in his
nose, so they decided to try to put it down
his throat.
Looking on in dreadful horror, unable
to turn away, I watched as the dipsomani
ac sent the tube back to the doctors, along
with a steady stream of thick, bloody bile.
At that point, I thought things couldn't

get any worse. I was wrong.
As the man on my right continued to
splash gallon after gallon of crimson
vomit onto the floor, the doctors turned
their attention to me and strapped me
onto a hard board, with my head and
neck in a fixed position, before leaving me
alone for close to an hour.
Lying there immobile — on a board
surrounded by the crying and moaning of
the other emergency patients — I
endured the most frightening hour of my
life, other than maybe that "Fantasy
Island" episode with Annette Funicello
and the little puppet that came to life.
I began to realize how much my life
would change if the damage to my neck
were permanent. No more jogging. No
more varsity gymnastics. No more love
making while hanging from a trapeze by
only my teeth. I would never realize my
lifelong dream of going over the top to
"blow my own horn." All these things
that I had once accepted as commonplace
would now be just memories.
After numerous x-rays, the doctors
deduced that I had only injured muscles,
and that after a few weeks of medication
and wearing a neck brace everything
would be fine. They loaded me up with
pain killers, giving me prescriptions for
three different drugs as well as the pam
phlets describing them, and sent me on
my way.
The three pills were cyclobenzaprine,

which relieves muscle spasms, narcotic
analgesics with acetaminophen, a pain
reliever and "nonsteroidal anti-inflam
matory drugs," for the reduction of
arthritis inflammation.
Under the column "Are there any side
effects?" these drugs sported an impres
sive list, including "drowsiness, dizzi
ness, muscle weakness, blurred vision,
confusion, nervousness, constipation,
easy bleeding, yellow skin and eyes, sore
throat, fever, eye/ear problems, difficult
urination, mental changes, difficulty
breathing and bloody stools."
So these pills were going to make my
neck better while making me fall asleep,
puke, bleed and turn yellow. Deee-licious.
I decided that, rather than encourage
a battle between bodily functions in my
posterior, I would wear the brace and let
nature run its course independent of
drugs. Hopefully, I'll be back up on the
trapeze by next Friday.
