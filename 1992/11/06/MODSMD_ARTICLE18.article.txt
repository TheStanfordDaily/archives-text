Domestic partners bill doesn't destroy 'moral fabric 9

lAM HIGHLY IMPRESSED BY Prof.
Robert Greer Cohn; he seems quite
alive for a man who developed his
sense of morality during the Dark Ages.
The contents of his letter against the
domestic partners bill suggest that he is
untainted by modern notions of equal
rights and treatment.
I agree that the future of our children
is vital. That is why I support the
domestic partners bill. The first step to
raising children who are not twisted by
anger, hate and abuse is to have sup
portive parents who themselves are not
hateful and abusive.
Promoting tolerance and open-mind
ed caring in society is a means of pro
moting tolerant, caring parents. A tradi
tional marriage is no guarantee of good
parenting, as can be seen by the number
of abused children raised by legally

bound, heterosexual couples, so-called
"responsible marriages."
Simply because a couple is homosexu
al or unmarried does not mean that they
cannot be loving, caring parents. Sexual
orientation and legal status have noth
ing to do with a person's ability to raise
active, bright, idealistic and loving chil
dren.
Indeed, I wonder if a greater percent
age of heterosexual parents than homo
sexual parents were found to be abusive,
would Cohn suggest that heterosexuals
are not fit to raise children? If more
married couples were found to be less
satisfied with their relationship than
unmarried couples, would Cohn discour
age marriages?
It seems that Cohn is more homopho
bic and prudish than he is concerned
with chUd welfare or anyone's happiness.

Cohn refers to some unspecified "basic
moral fabric" and "deep principle" which
he fears is becoming torn. Does he mean
that the increased freedom to live a full
life and love another human being is a
destruction of "moral fabric?"
If so, to which moral code would he
like to regress? Shall we outlaw interra
cial marriages? Should we stone adulter
ers? Shall we burn homosexuals lovers
at the stake? Who would he like to
repress and terrorize in the name of
"moral fabric?" I would prefer to see
Cohn's moral fabric torn to shreds, than
be tied down and gagged by it.
Cohn claims that a "deep principle" is
being violated. Which principle does he
mean? The domestic partners bill sup
ports the idea of equal treatment under
the law. The bill constitutes an exten
sion of a person's civil rights without

interfering with the rights of others.
The bill removes discriminatory bar
riers which have nothing to do with
"merit." Cohn suggests that the bill vio
lates the "deep principle Admiral Stock
dale stood for," but I believe Admiral
Stockdale would approve of an act which
promotes an individual's freedom of
choice, and his or her ability to be a pro
ductive member of society with dignity.
It seems to me that the only principle
Cohn is supporting is his need to find
approval in the eyes of some vague
group of "sophisticated citizens of the
world." But if these "sophisticated citi
zens" are simply closed-minded, blindly
intolerant homophobes, then neither I,
the university nor anyone else should
seek their twisted opinions.
