# The 						realities of abortion must be considered by all regardless of one's ethics
## 
### 
This is in response to Pro-choice
Alliance president Mary Yu's comment in
the Nov. 3 Daily article entitled "Program
funds for pro-life group held." She said
that the one mtyor reason why she
refused to attend the abortion debate held
Oct. 27, was that she did not want to see
the film in which they showed "all these
mangled babies which gynecologists and
obstetricians state are stillborn babies."
My question is, what does she think
an aborted fetus looks like? Does it just
magically disappear into thin air? In
Maryland legislation has just made abor
tion legal through the ninth month of
pregnancy.
What does she think a fetus looks like
after the first trimester? A tumor? I
think one pro-choice woman's comment

described the situation accurately, "It's
my body and I have the right to kill my
baby whenever I choose."
We now have passed legislation and
elected government leaders to assure
this right for women. But what we all
must recognize, regardless of our stance
on abortion, is that the product of abor
tion, at least after the first trimester, is
exactly what Yu did not wish to see â€”
gross, distorted, "mangled babies."
