# Biz School makes D.C. contacts, tries to find internships
## 
### Neerad Lai Staff writer 
The Graduate School of Busi
ness is putting great efforts to
ward landing its students full
time jobs and internships in the
forthcoming Clinton administra
tion.
Since the 1980s The Career
Management Center for the Busi
ness School has been consistently
placing students from the school's
public management program into
Republican administrations. But
with the election of Bill Clinton,
the center is now searching for
new contacts in Washington —
primarily Democrats — who will
aid Stanford students in getting
jobs there, said Maureen McNul
ty, the director of the center.
"With the regime changing
we'll have a new set of characters..

. . It's not simple magic to form re
lations [with these people). It takes
hard work . . . and we've been
working like crazy to build up con
nections," said McNulty, who con
stantly flies back and forth be
tween Washington and Europe to
extend a Stanford job network.
"We're currently working with
alumni who served at a high level
in the Clinton campaign, new sen
ators and congressmen," she said.
"We're trying to match their
needs with our students' talent."
The center expects payoffs to be
generous. Its primary target in job
placement is the White House Fel
lows Program, which will pair 15
to 20 college graduates who have
extraordinary leadership skills
with top officials in selected
branches of the government, in
eluding the future office of Vice
President-elect A 1 Gore.
Officials hope to arrange jobs
and internships for students in
such government agencies as the
Federal Trade Commission, the
Federal Reserve Board, the Envi
ronmental Protection Agency and
the Department of Agriculture.
Some 40 Stanford students are
scheduled to attend the Washing
ton reception for the program
Dec. 22. A related job-hunt tour in
Washington is planned for Christ
mas, as well as a study tour in
spring.

In addition, Stanford will be
the only university in the country
invited to send an official to a
White House staffing meeting
Dec. 18, where 40 agencies and
nonprofit organizations will pre
sent job opportunities.
Student reaction to these
offers in the public sector has
been markedly positive. "I
haven't seen the same energy
among students in a long time,"
said McNulty, citing that 52 out
of last year's class of 327 business
students successfully completed
the requirements for a certificate
in public management.
"After the elections, many stu
dents who had been lukewarm
about the public sector came ask
ing for job applications," she said.

"We hope to see some good
results."
The public management pro
gram at Stanford has been steadi
ly climbing in reputation and
quality over the last few years,
and was chosen as No. 1 for pub
lic management in the business
school rankings in this year's U.S.
News and World Report collegiate
surveys.
Despite this boost, competition
for these public sector jobs will be
severe.
"Washington receives 3,000
resumes a day right now," McNul
ty said. "It isn't just sending your
resume in. Students don't have
the energy and resources to get
such jobs. You need to get a men
tor, sponsor and patron."
