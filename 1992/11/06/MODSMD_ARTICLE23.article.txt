## Lasley plays for love of the game 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
Both on and off the football
field, senior fullback J.J. Lasley
has been a source of altruism. As
his final season at Stanford draws
to a close, things haven't changed
a bit.
Lasley's crusade of selflessness
began when he was a student at
Crespi High School in Van Nuys,
Calif. His sophomore year, he
rushed for over 2,000 yards and
21 touchdowns.

Australia, play rugby,
surf and never work
again. It all depends
on my mood.'
— J.J. Lasley

The next two years, Lasley
shared the backfield with future
California tailback Russell White.
Because the offense increasingly
revolved around White, Lasley
didn't see the ball that often.
"I still ran the ball but not as
much," Lasley said. "I run
blocked for White. Because of
this, I was worried that colleges
wouldn't look at me."
Although he and White are
still friends, the two have grown
apart as the years have passed.
Lasley takes pride in the fact that
Stanford has not lost a Big Game
since he has been a member of the
Cardinal.
"I refuse to lose to those guys,"
he said. "No matter what hap
pens the rest of the season, we're
going to beat Cal. Period."
Despite a limited number of
carries, Lasley still rushed for 928
yards during his senior year in
high school and was strongly
recruited. He chose Stanford
because of the educational possi
bilities as well as the football pro
gram.
"When I got here Stanford was
known as a passing team," he
said. "I didn't let that bother me,
because I knew at the least I could
get a good education for free."
Lasley was redshirted in 1988,
his freshman season. He was used
sparingly until last season, when
he made valuable contributions
backing up Tommy Vardell and
playing on special teams. The last
two years, he has spent his offsea
son playing rugby with the Stan
ford club team and credits his sec
ond sport with helping improve
his football.
"When you're carrying a ball
and you have 15 guys tpring to
kill you. . .you can't simulate
that," he said. "Rugby keeps me
in great shape and gives me an
extra season carrying the ball."

Always thinking of his future,
Lasley has decided to forgo play
ing rugby this year in anticipation
of NFL tryouts. Whether or not
he is drafted, Lasley plans to give
three years to trying to make it in
the pros. His dedication to suc
ceeding at football is just further
evidence of his selflessness.
"I'm going to give it my best
shot, even if I have to walk on,"
he said. "Hopefully, I can take it
to the next level, because I've got
to take care of my mom. That's
what it all boils down to. I'll
worry about myself after."
If he doesn't find a niche in the
NFL, Lasley will probably use his
economics major to foray into the
business world. He is also consid
ering professional rugby as a pos
sibility.
"The rugby coach said he
thinks I could make a lot of
money playing in Europe," he
said. "I could just move to Aus
tralia, play rugby, surf and never
work again. It all depends on my
mood."
As for this year, Lasley has
emerged as one of the key players
in the Cardinal offense. This
expanded role often goes unseen,
however, due to the nature of his
contributions. Run blocking, pass
blocking, short-yardage runs and
receptions in the flat do not make
for publicity, but he said he
understands and appreciates his
role.
"As a senior, I'm a team leader
who has to perform my specific
function every play," he said.
"I'm not the big play player. They
don't expect the 40 or 50 yard run
from me. The third-and-one runs,
catching short passes in the flat
— those are the plays I have to
execute."
Lasley has been executing very
well this season, with 40 rushes
for 185 yards and 26 catches for
231 yards.

With tHfe Uititffciflg
back Steve Stenstrom has
received of late, however, Lasley's
most pressing task has become
protecting the passer.
"People have seen that we're
vulnerable to the blitz," he said.
"They're sending extra people
after our quarterback, so the
coaches are keeping me in on pat
terns to help block. I'm like
Steve's personal protector."
Lasley has worked at his block
ing all season, especially on keep
ing his head up and staying low.
Since most of the people he runs
up against are linebackers who
outweigh him by 20 pounds, he
has to stay low to make the block
— a job he has done admirably.
Although Lasley was assigned
to do a lot of blocking against
Washington, Stenstrom still hit
the turf often en route to last
weekend's 41-7 defeat. Despite
the loss, the team still has confi
dence it can finish the season in a
positive fashion.

"This year's team is real
close," he said. "No one thought
we were going to lose, so when we
did, everyone was disappointed.
It's not often that the whole team
is on the same page mentally."
As for tomorrow, Lasley and
the rest of the Cardinal have got
ten very excited about the
prospect of beating the surging
USC Trojans. This game also has
special meaning for the Pacific 10
Conference standings — with a
second place finish at stake.
"I don't like those guys any
way," Lasley said of Saturday's
nemesis. "But especially now that
they stand in the way of us having
a great season."

the Cardinal on both the football and rugby fields since his arrival on campus.
