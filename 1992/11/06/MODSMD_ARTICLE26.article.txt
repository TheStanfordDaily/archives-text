# Women face NCAA game
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
The No. 3 University of Portland women's soc
cer team is making its first trip to the NCAA tour
ney Sunday when it faces No. 4 Stanford. Howev
er, one of the Pilots' players — sophomore full
back Kristen Wair — is making her second play
off appearance on Maloney Field.
In 1991, Wair helped the Cardinal to its first
ever tournament win over Santa Clara. But she
was forced to transfer at the end of last year
because of financial reasons and will now walk on
the Cardinal's home field as a member of the pur
ple-clad opposition.
"It's a Catch-22," said Wair, who enjoys play
ing for soccer-mad Portland but still feels a
strong bond with her first collegiate team.
"It's going to be hard for me if we beat them.
It's Julie Foudy's senior year and they really
want to go to the Final Four. But I want to go to
the Final Four, too. Unfortunately, one of the
teams is going to walk off the field with their
heads down."
Wair admitted that facing her former team will
saddle her with an added emotional burden, but
she doesn't think it will affect her play.
"It's going to be hard to stay mentally
focused, but once you're in the game you block
everything else out," said Wair, who joked about
the possibility of marking someone like junior
Sarah Rafanelli, whom she competed with last
year.
"It's like, 'Hey, buddy. How's it going? Sorry,
but you're not going to score today."'
A single play by either Wair or Rafanelli could
make the difference in what looks like a very tight
contest.
Portland (18-1) blitzed through a relatively
light schedule with two of the top four scorers in
the country, Tiffeny Milbrett and Shannon
MacMillen.
Milbrett notched 29 goals and 11 assists for 69
points on the year, second to the North Carolina's
Mia Hamm, who has 85 points.
MacMillen is the third-highest scorer in the
country with 18 goals and nine assists.
On the other hand, Stanford (16-1-1) empha
sized team defense en route to its third-straight
NCAA appearance. Julie Foudy leads Cardinal
scorers with 11 goals and 12 assists. The senior
national team starter keys the Cardinal's preci
sion attack.
Both teams feel they have something to prove
this weekend as No. 6 Santa Clara (11-4-2) was
ranked first in the region and received a first
round bye.
"We were really upset that we were ranked No.
3 in the country and then seeded No. 3 in the
West," Wair said.
"We felt we got the short end of the stick so
we're out to prove that we deserved the No. 1
seeding."
Regional superiority will be determined on the
field Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets, $5 for adults and
$3 for students and children, are on sale at the
Athletics Department Ticket Office.
