# NCAA seedings at stake as water polo takes on USC, Cal
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
The NCAA water polo championship
tournament doesn't take place until late
November, but Cardinal fans can witness
what may be a preview of the semifinal and
final rounds this weekend at deGuerre Pool.
Stanford's second-ranked team will host
No. 1 California and No. 3 USC on Saturday
and Sunday. Since the Cardinal has already
defeated the Trojans in three prior meetings
and lost to the undefeated Bears once, win
ning both contests may not thrust Stanford
into the number one position. Conversely,
losing both games may not mean the Cardi
nal would relinquish its No. 2 status.
However, Stanford head coach Dante Det
tamanti is placing great importance in the
two encounters. If the Cardinal can triumph

over USC for a fourth time, it will have great
psychological advantage over the Trojans
should they confront each other in the semi
finals of the NCAA's, as seedings predict.
Stanford's matchup problems with
fourth-ranked UC-Irvine will also play a key
role. Indeed, the Anteaters dealt the Cardinal
one of its three losses this year, triumphing
10-5 in October. If the Trojans lose to Stan
ford (or to any other opponent), Irvine could
move into the No. 3 position, which would
mean the Cardinal would have to confront
the Anteaters in the national semifinals.
With circumstances as they are now, Det
tamanti admits that Stanford almost wants
to stay at the No. 2 spot, particularly if the
Anteaters remain where they are. Yet if UCI
ascends in the polls, the best way for the
Cardinal to avoid them is to aim for the No.
1 spot.

"But in any case," Dettamanti said, "if
you win all your games, everything will take
care of itself "
As for Stanford's remaining games, Det
tamanti expects close battles. Indeed, Cal
needed overtime to come from behind and
down the Cardinal 11-10 in the Mountain
Pacific Invitational final last month, and
Stanford defeated USC by only one point in
their last meeting.
Both the Bears and the Trojans — like
the Cardinal — feature excellent fast-break
ing ability. In Cal, Stanford will see both a
speedy and physical team. The Bears'
starters average 6-foot-4, led by senior Dirk
Zeien at 6-6, 220 pounds. Contributing to
Cal's strength are United States Junior
National Team member Chris Oeding, who
strikes from the perimeter, junior defensive
specialists Troy Barnheart and Gavin

Arroyo and a host of veteran players.
"They don't have any weaknesses at all,"
Dettamanti said. "They've had eight or nine
games settled by only one point, and they
won them all. That's the sign of a good
team."
As for USC, the Trojans present a bal
anced team led by U.S. Junior National
Team member Santiago. Like Cal, they
have plenty of experience; most of the team
is comprised of juniors.
Dettamanti predicted tight games this
weekend. "A lot of times, Southern Califor
nia teams play better up here than at
home," he said.
The truth in Dettamanti'b theory will be
determined noon on Saturday at deGuerre
Pool. Then, on Sunday, the anticipated 1-2
showdown takes place when the Cardinal
(18-3) faces Cal (22-0) at 1 p.m.
