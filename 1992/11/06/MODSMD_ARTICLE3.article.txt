# Chicano traditions depicted in improv

Every year someone in Teatro
Xicano dies during the group's
performance on Dia de los Muer
tos — the Day of the Dead.
"But they somehow end up
showing up for exams," said first
year law student Alma Medina,
one of the group's three directors.
The group has been performing
its improvisational skits on the
traditional Chicano/Latino holi
day since its birth five years ago,
Medina said. The sluts are based
on traditional stories and often
carry a message.
"We like to use the themes of
the Day of the Dead and the sto
ries our family told us, but we also
like to perform works with social
and political messages," she said.
The message of tonight's per
formance concerns the Los Ange
les riots and environmental de
struction. Both topics are looked
at in relation to death, said gradu
ate student David Duran, another
director.
Past performances dealt with
such issues as the threats of AIDS,
drug abuse, gang warfare and po
lice violence.
Even the name of the group
carries a message. The "X" in
Xicano is the traditional repre
sentation of the ch sound, said
graduate student and director
Jorge "Felix" Cuevas.

Dia de los Muertos is the
group's first and most important
production each year, said Medi
na. But the group also performs
on other Chicano/Latino holidays
and at conferences, she said.
The actors in the group are
Stanford students who expressed

interest in participating after
attending past performances.
"I had seen them perform since
my freshman year at Dla de los
Muertos and it always made me
laugh. It brought back a lot of the
stories my parents told," said
novice performer Eva Silva.
Only the directors remain the
same from performance to perfor
mance; the actors change each
time.
"We're a weird group. We're
not an established group," said
Cuevas, pointing out that they
aren't even registered as an orga
nized student group.
Part of its weirdness is the
group's lack of training.
"We walk through our skits.
We have one dress rehearsal and
then people just sort of shine,"
said Cuevas.
However, the group's inexperi
ence does not cause stage fright.
"It's a very personal celebration.
There's going to be a lot of people
there, but it feels like you are in
front of a family so you don't feel
nervous," Silva said.
One of the things that gives the
group its feeling of family is the

use of the actors' own traditional
stories. The stories are "things
that affect me personally, that I
can do straight from the heart,"
Silva said. "It is sort of like an oral
tradition, an oral culture."
Everyone in the group con
tributes a story or an idea, Medi
na said.
"It's a collective theater," said
Duran. "The stories come from
the people and we give them back
to the people."
Medina said the process helps
bring the meaning of the holiday
closer to the forefront of people's
minds. "We're recreating our cul
ture on a little stage. For a lot of us
Day of the Dead is something we
grow into as we get older," she said.
First-time performer Gloria
S&nchez said the group brings
culture alive. "Teatro Xicano
includes a lot of the Chicano or
Latino experience as it is here in
our minds."
Cuevas said the group reminds
people of parts of themselves they
might have lost. "It's dead culture
coming alive because ... those
traditions may have been lost and
now they're coming alive."
