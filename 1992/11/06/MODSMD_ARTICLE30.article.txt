# Encore for soccer seniors
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
When the unranked Stanford men's soccer team
goes in to face the eighth-ranked UCLA Bruins in
today's Mountain Pacific Sports Federation playoffs,
it might very well signify the end of a dynasty built
by the nine graduating seniors on the team.
Led by top scorer Jason Vanacour and co-captains
Randy Mann and Kyle Krpata, the seniors of this
team rescued Cardinal soccer from near obscurity
four years ago and propelled the program to new
heights last year with its first appearance in the
NCAA Tournament since 1979.
The three central figures in Stanford's ascen
dence as a powerhouse entered the school four years
ago with intentions of being a national contender by
the time they graduated.
"We were the team back in our freshman year,"
said midfielder Mann. "I came here so we could build
a program from scratch and get to the level where
Stanford could compete as national champions. We
took that on as a goal for the entire unit, and so far
we've made it happen."
Since their freshmen year, the threesome have
improved on both the collegiate and national soccer
levels. In addition to improving the Cardinal record
from a dismal 9-9-3 showing in 1988 to its present
11-6-1 mark this year, Krpata, Mann, and Vanacour
have also teamed up for a silver medal at the
Olympic Sports Festival in 1991.
By heading the national West team in that tour
nament, the three individuals gained prominence
beyond the collegiate soccer world. Vanacour has
been contacted by several professional teams since
then, and Krpata returned to the Olympic Festival
this summer.
Meanwhile, Mann, the most ambitious of the
three, has actively sought tryouts with European
teams after graduation next spring.
"I think they are three extremely talented play
ers," said head coach Colin Lindores. "But of the
three, I think Randy is the true lover of the game.
He's already contacted some international clubs, and
I know that if I were to build a team, I would look for
a Randy Mann to be the center of it."
Their focus now, however, is the MPSF and
NCAA playoffs. They are entering today's match on
the heels of a two-game skid, as they dropped their
final regular season contests to the Washington

Huskies and Seattle Pacific Falcons. In order to
secure an NCAA Tournament berth, the Cardinal
has to sweep both its games this weekend, beginning
with an upset of the Bruins today.
"There's a bit of irony involved in this weekend's
matches," Krpata said. "This was the year that we
wanted to be the best, and yet we've been making
stupid mistakes that have hurt our chances in post
season play. We can make up for all that against
UCLA, but in order to do so we have to play the best
game of our lives."
The Cardinal will be fighting an uphill battle
against the Bruins, as UCLA ushers in a squad that
features first-string Olympic talents in goalkeeper
Brad Friedel and midfielder Joe-Max Moore. The
two represented the United States in Barcelona this
summer as starters for the national team.
Friedel is often touted as the best goalkeeper in
the nation on both the amateur and professional lev
els. Presently, he leads the NCAA with a miniscule
0.50 goals against average, while he has registered a
conference high 10 shutouts in UCLA's 17 regular
season matches.
Complementing him on offense is the dominating
figure of Moore, who leads the team with seven goals
and seven assists.
"I can't see us scoring more than one or two goals
against Friedel," Lindores said. "So we have to con
centrate on shutting Moore down."
"They might have the clear edge on paper, but I
think we're as good as they are," Krpata said. "We're
not afraid to play them. And actually I want to play
them because they're the one team in the West that
we have not beaten in my four years here."
Stanford will counter with the passing attack of
Mann, who acts as a "point guard" in the midfield.
On the receiving end of Mann's passes will be Vana
cour, who leads the team with nine goals and three
assists. Krpata rounds out the well-balanced Stan
ford team by guarding the goal with a 0.98 GAA.
"I don't think that there has ever been a bond like
ours," Mann said. "I'm going to play this weekend
like there's no tomorrow. Theoretically it can be the
last time we play together as a team. I just want to
prolong the experience for as long as possible.
"Going into the game, I don't see us as the under
dog, but we've got to go out and prove it. If we don't,
we're done. It's been our goal to get into the NCAA
Tournament and do well. If we win over the weekend,
we'll be right where we wanted to be four years ago."
