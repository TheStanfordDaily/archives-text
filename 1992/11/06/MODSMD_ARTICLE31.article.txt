# Greeks take off with 'Rocketeer' star Connelly at helm
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
But David Schwartz — fresh
out of the estivation of college
statistics compilation — was
unable to harness his Ren-and-
Stimpy-style-tongue-dragging-on
the-floor lust.
In an inner battle the likes of
which can only be found in Augus
tine's "Confessions," Schwartz
went with his true persona over
his lust-driven alter ego, "Randy
Mann" — choosing against Yale
and for Harvard. Maybe she'll
respect him for who he is. Maybe
not.
Tish Williams, whose nude
feats in and out of the library,
Stanford Stadium and the Exotic
Erotic (remember Saran Wrap
Girl?) matches wits with the body
brazen, noticeably-enhanced Yalie.
By next week, a rapt Stanford
audience will indeed know who is
more "Greek."
Connelly — absent from the
not-always-silver screen longer
than Chelsea Clinton was granted
an "awkward stage" — showed a
decipherable-sans-decoder-ring
allegiance to friends at UCLA, a
decision which only hints at the
motivation behind her transfer: to
be that much closer to the Tinsel
town she someday hopes to domi
nate.
First, she better lose Doogie.

Greeks are men. Big hairy men
who drink whichever beer costs
less than $10 a case. Men who
wouldn't think twice about uri
nating off the Space Needle.
Greeks don't appear naked in
"Hot Spot." And they never,
ever take off their clothes in the
general vicinity of Don John
son.
No Greek would ever fall in
love — even for big money — with
a post-pubescent Doogie Howser
with a large piece of tin strapped
to his back.
But this is what it has all boiled
down to. In a pathetic attempt to
boost their otherwise dismal rat
ings (and even dismaller egos),
Team Greek has put aside their
masculinity for Stanford's newest
babe-messiah.
Jennifer Connelly, star of, well,
star of many, joins the dark side
as our Guest Greek. A recent
transfer from Yale (After all,
without inveterate, Woody-Allen
inspired actor Benno Schmidt
around, what did they have to
offer?), Connelly picked Yale to
win and Harvard to lose. Looks
like somebody better alter our
new friend's loyalties.

But David Schwartz — fresh
out of the estivation of college
statistics compilation — was
unable to harness his Ren-and-
Stimpy-style-tongue-dragging-on
the-floor lust.
In an inner battle the likes of
which can only be found in Augus
tine's "Confessions," Schwartz
went with his true persona over
his lust-driven alter ego, "Randy
Mann" — choosing against Yale
and for Harvard. Maybe she'll
respect him for who he is. Maybe
not.
Tish Williams, whose nude
feats in and out of the library,
Stanford Stadium and the Exotic
Erotic (remember Saran Wrap
Girl?) matches wits with the body
brazen, noticeably-enhanced Yalie.
By next week, a rapt Stanford
audience will indeed know who is
more "Greek."
Connelly — absent from the
not-always-silver screen longer
than Chelsea Clinton was granted
an "awkward stage" — showed a
decipherable-sans-decoder-ring
allegiance to friends at UCLA, a
decision which only hints at the
motivation behind her transfer: to
be that much closer to the Tinsel
town she someday hopes to domi
nate.
First, she better lose Doogie.

Greeks are men. Big hairy men
who drink whichever beer costs
less than $10 a case. Men who
wouldn't think twice about uri
nating off the Space Needle.
Greeks don't appear naked in
"Hot Spot." And they never,
ever take off their clothes in the
general vicinity of Don John
son.
No Greek would ever fall in
love — even for big money — with
a post-pubescent Doogie Howser
with a large piece of tin strapped
to his back.
But this is what it has all boiled
down to. In a pathetic attempt to
boost their otherwise dismal rat
ings (and even dismaller egos),
Team Greek has put aside their
masculinity for Stanford's newest
babe-messiah.
Jennifer Connelly, star of, well,
star of many, joins the dark side
as our Guest Greek. A recent
transfer from Yale (After all,
without inveterate, Woody-Allen
inspired actor Benno Schmidt
around, what did they have to
offer?), Connelly picked Yale to
win and Harvard to lose. Looks
like somebody better alter our
new friend's loyalties.
