Death will come to life at
tonight's celebration of El Dia de
los Muertos, co-sponsored by
MEChA and El Centro Chicano.
El Dia de los Muertos stems
from the ancient Aztec custom of
celebrating death as a natural
part of life. "It's like mocking
death," said Asst. Dean of Stu
dents Frances Morales, director of
El Centro Chicano.
Celebrants often dress up and
dance in skeleton costumes, pre
pare skull-shaped candy and eat
pan de muerto, bread in the shape
of a dead person.
Tonight's event at El Centro
will include songs and poetry read
ings by students and a musical
performance by Enrique Ramirez,
a San Francisco lawyer and ac
tivist. A film depicting celebra
tions in Mexico will also be shown.
Teatro Xicano, an improvisa
tional theater group, will act out
skits about the holiday. Ballet
Folklorico de Stanford will per
form "some special dances related
to this event," Morales said.
The festivities will be fol
lowed by a reception with Mexi
can hot chocolate, bread and
arroz con leche, a Mexican rice
pudding.
According to Morales, the cele
bration is "a way to celebrate our

history and culture and share it
with the rest of the Stanford com
munity.
"It's an opportunity for the
freshmen to experience a cultural
event that they may not have cel
ebrated in their own communi
ties," she added.
"I never really celebrated it
where I came from in Texas, so
for me it's a really interesting
alternative to Halloween," said
Stephen Dorow, a resident assis
tant in Casa Zapata. "It's a time
of celebration, but it's not
reduced to going out and getting

candy. It can be a time of happi
ness and remembrance."
El Dia de los Muertos is also an
opportunity to pay respect to
deceased loved ones. Altars have
been erected in Rains, Casa Zapa
ta, Bolivar House and El Centro,
which students can decorate with
candles, flowers and pictures of
deceased friends and family mem
bers.
Marigolds are a traditional
ornament, because "they have a
really nice scent, which is sup
posed to attract the souls of the
dead," Morales said.
