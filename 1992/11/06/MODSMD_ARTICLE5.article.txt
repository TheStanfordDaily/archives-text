# Feminists find 'G-Spot' appealing
## New publication with new title to be introduced at end of fall quarter 
### Emily Bazar 
In past years, "Aurora" and "Critical
Bitch" were the vehicles of the feminist
voice on campus. But not any more. A new
feminist publication — "The Gender
Spot," or "The G-Spot," dedicated to the
advancement of understanding between
the sexes — will be introduced to the Stan
ford community at the end of fall quarter.
"Aurora" was Stanford's mqjor femi
nist newspaper until last year, when it
broke up and reemerged as "Critical

Bitch."
But when the stafT of "Critical Bitch"
graduated last year, nothing was done to
ensure that the magazine would contin
ue to be published. Seniors Lisa Demsky
and Simone Spearman said they decided
to form "The G-Spot" because they be
lieve "there is an audience [at Stanford!
for a different feminist magazine."
According to Spearman, "The G-
Spot" is "a reaction to the negativity and
misrepresentation of women in [the for
mer magazines]." Demsky said the defin

ition of feminism presented in "Aurora"
and "Critical Bitch" was too narrow,
"alienating a lot of groups of people like
men, heterosexuals and women of color."
"People at Stanford were embar
rassed to call themselves feminists,"
Demsky said.
Demsky said she wants "to create a
magazine that has a more inclusive view
of feminism." She and Spearman have
already enlisted a seven- to eight-person
editorial board, consisting of both
men and women.
In addition, "The G-Spot" will
be accepting multimedia contribu
tions from both men and women
in an effort to represent the views
of the campus more fairly.
"We want different views from
different people," Spearman said.
Demsky and Spearman said
they hope the emphasis on

diverse views of feminism will
bring men and women together.
"If men and women contributed,
there will be more empathy and
understanding between the two
genders," Spearman said.
According to Demsky, "Auro
ra" and "Critical Bitch" did not
foster understanding because
they were "angry and accusatory
and too extreme." Demsky and
Spearman want to create a maga
zine that harbors unification.
Demsky and Spearman said
they hope to publish "The G-
Spot" once a quarter. The first

issue is tentatively due one or two
weeks before finals, with a circu
lation of 4,000 to 5,000 copies.
Because the magazine will not sell
advertisements, its creators are
requesting funding from the
ASSU and dorms, as well as out
side support
"The G-Spot" has no specific
theme, but Demsky and Spear
man said they would like to focus
on gender issues while covering a
wide variety of topics. Spearman
said their major goal is to provide
a feminist newspaper that allows
"everybody to have a voice."
