# Grads mentor the clueless
## Undergrads get advice from masters, Ph.D. candidates

Many Stanford students spend their
first few years of college worrying about
choosing a mj\jor, and the last trying to fig
ure out what to do with it.
Even those who have wanted to be a
doctor since nursery school still might be
wondering which graduate school to at
tend, what other majors might be inter
esting, or what it's like to work in a spe
cific company or field â€” questions a new
Stanford mentoring program hopes to ad
dress.
The program, hosted by the Stanford
Economic Association, creates an informal
way for undergraduates in any field to meet
a graduate student with experience in their
particular area of interest.
"The purpose of the program is for
students to have the name of a specific
person they can ask just any question,"
said program chair Patty Kao, a senior.
"The program is open to anyone on cam
pus who would like to meet and talk to
people who have either worked or have

applied and been accepted to graduate
school."
First-year business school student Neal
Bogdanovich, one of the mentors, was ex
cited about the prospect of helping other
students. "When you're about to do some
thing," he said, "it's always great to talk to
someone who has already been through the
process you're about to begin."
Kao described the real benefit of the pro
gram as helping people explore all the op
portunities that will be available after col
lege. Picking a isn't always enough,
she added. "Nowadays, I doubt people end
up doing what their is anyway," she
said.
Finding a job in any field is becoming
more difficult. According to Rachel Hahn of
the Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter, "Recruiters have less jobs than they
have had in the past." But, she said not to
panic; the same number of recruiters are
still coming to campus.
"We tell (students] they are going to find
a job," Hahn said. "It's just going to take
longer."
