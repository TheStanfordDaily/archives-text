# USC/Stanford Match-ups
## 
### 
As the battle for the Heisman
heats up, all eyes will be on junior
flanker Curtis Conway and senior
halfback Glyn Milburn. Milburn
enters today's game first in the
Pac-10 and second in the nation
in all-purpose running, with
186.1 yards per game. His punt
return average of 18.28 yards is
also the best in the conference.
Conway is another dual talent: he
is a dangerous kickoff returner,
with 440 yards and one touch
down on 14 returns this year. In
addition, he leads the USC squad
with 31 pass receptions for 497
yards and five touchdowns.

Back at El Toro High School, Rob
Johnson was the favored wide
receiver of teammate Steve Sten
strom. Both players have come a
long way since then: Johnson is
now at the helm of his own squad,
completing 90 of 148 passes for
1147 yards and 11 touchdowns
this season. Stenstrom has been
taking a bruising this season due
to spotty pass protection, but has
still managed to complete 146-of
-249 for 1728 yards and eight
touchdowns.

Junior Willie McGinest has been
a dominating presence on the
Trojan defense this season. With
38 tackles, including nine sacks
for minus 50 yards, the All-Amer
ican candidate will be hot on
Stenstrom's trail. At 6-8 and 300-
lb, senior Steve Hoyem is repre
sentative of the Cardinal's bulky
offensive line. Stanford will need
to use its size to its full advantage
in order to stop McGinest's
attack.

All-American candidate Johnnie
Morton has made touchdown
receptions part of his regular
routine. This season, he tied the
USC record with three of them
per game against both San Diego
State and Oregon. The Cardinal
pass defense is ranked second in
the nation and first in the Pac
-10, due in part to the efforts of
senior Darrien Gordon. Gordon
has two interceptions and one
fumble recovery on the season,
and has consistently provided
blanket coverage in the backfield.

Senior Dave Garnett has become
a pillar of the Cardinal defense,
compiling a team high of 234
total tackles in his 41-game Stan
ford career. So far he has racked
up 54 this season, and he will be
hoping to add a few more against
Southern Cal's Estrus Crayton.
The tailback leads the Trojan
ground attack with 454 rushing
yards and 3 touchdowns on 127
carries.

Former L.A. chief of police Daryl
Gates may carry a big stick, but
even with his own talk show, he
can't speak as softy as Stanford's
own zig-zagging Capt. Raoul
Neimeyer. After the Rodney King
incident, Gates' city was literally
in flames, while Niemeyer helped
coordinate one of the most peace
ful demonstrations in the state
sparing even Copeland's
Sports from harm.
