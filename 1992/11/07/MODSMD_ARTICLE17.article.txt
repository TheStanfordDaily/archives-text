# Armour steps into new role for Cardinal
## 
### Rich Stolz 
In any sport, an athlete must have a spe
cial kind of drive to be successful. For
flanker Justin Armour, this motivation
comes from the encouragement of his per
sonal support group and his strong reli
gious convictions.
Hailing from Manitou Springs High
School near Colorado Springs, Colo.,
Armour originally came to the Cardinal as a
quarterback. Though he planned to red
shirt his freshman year, he was offered the
opportunity to play at the wide receiver
position. He jumped at the chance.
The first game he played for the Cardi
nal was the Colorado game last season. But
his opening year ended the very next week,
due to a tear in the arch of his foot, keeping
him on the bench for the rest of the year.
His summer was spent healing the injury
and preparing for his next opportunity to
play. Putting his experience into perspec
tive he said, "It was definitely frustrating,
but I did learn a lot."
The actual transition to wide receiver
was not very difficult for the 6-foot-6, 215-
lb. sophomore. In fact, it was not the first
transition he made in sports. Though he
played football in elementary school, he
preferred soccer. "I really didn't like foot
ball very much. I didn't enjoy getting hit so
I turned to other sports. Actually, I really
loved basketball," he said.
But times have changed. As he has
adjusted to his new role, he has also become
more comfortable with the team. "The first
year was frustrating," he explained. "As a
new guy on the team, it seemed like every
one was acting as if they were cool. But the
more I'm there, the more I've gotten to
know the players. And I love it. The guys

are great, and I'm proud to be a part of it."
Regarding his performance this year, he
was less enthusiastic. Confident that he has
put in a 100 percent effort, he is still disap
pointed with the mistakes he has made. "It
has been a season of ups and downs," he
said. "Beating Notre Dame will be hard to
forget, but we all still have room for
improvement."
The highlight of his season so far has
been his touchdown reception against
Notre Dame. "We were close to the goal
line. I ran a shallow crossing pattern and
outran my defender. Steve (Stenstrom)
threw it and we had a touchdown," he said.
Armour attributes the struggles the
team has faced this season tQ mistakes and a
very difficult conference, perhaps the tough
est in the nation. Looking forward to the
USC Trojans, Armour expects it to be a
tough, exciting game with Southern Cal's
traditionally flashy, fast, big-play style on
both sides of the ball. He hopes the Cardinal
will execute what they practiced this week.
He also hopes that the effort he has per
sonally invested will pay him dividends.
Due to a heavy course load and practice
schedule, Armour is often out of his room
for 16 hours at a time.
Despite Armour's busy schedule, his phi
losophy is to "hang out with as many people
as possible. There are lots of cool people
around here from all sorts of different
angles."
Armour's hobbies include just about
anything unusual or athletic. This ranges
from swimming in the ocean at 3 a.m. to
just procrastinating at the beach.
On a personal level, Armour has found
inspiration in the team itself. He admires
quarterback Stenstrom not only because
he's his best friend but because "Steve's

been taking a lot of punishment but he still
hangs in there. It gives the rest of us
strength."
While he would like to continue with
football into the professional ranks, he tem
pers that hope with a dose of realism.
Armour simply wants to be able to support
a family the way his own family has sup
ported him.
"Mom is always terrified of a possible
injury and dad goes through the roller
coaster of emotions with me. They are so
supportive it's amazing. I've been real
lucky that they've trusted me to make my
own decision?," he said.
Today, despite his dedication to the foot
ball team, the most important part of his

life is his Christian identity. "My relation
ship with Christ propels me. I rely on it
heavily. It gets me through the hard prac
tices," he said.
Armour is a member of a Christian sup
port group called Athletes in Action. One
activity he particularly enjoys is Young
Life, a non-denominational community ser
vice organization in which he and Glyn Mil
burn spend time with the students at
Mountain View High School organizing
skits and singing songs.
This weekend against Southern Cal,
Armour will be confident in the support of
his family, his teammates and the thou
sands of Stanford fans cheering on the Car
dinal.

He also hopes that the effort he has per
sonally invested will pay him dividends.
Due to a heavy course load and practice
schedule, Armour is often out of his room
for 16 hours at a time.
Despite Armour's busy schedule, his phi
losophy is to "hang out with as many people
as possible. There are lots of cool people
around here from all sorts of different
angles."
Armour's hobbies include just about
anything unusual or athletic. This ranges
from swimming in the ocean at 3 a.m. to
just procrastinating at the beach.
On a personal level, Armour has found
inspiration in the team itself. He admires
quarterback Stenstrom not only because
he's his best friend but because "Steve's

been taking a lot of punishment but he still
hangs in there. It gives the rest of us
strength."
While he would like to continue with
football into the professional ranks, he tem
pers that hope with a dose of realism.
Armour simply wants to be able to support
a family the way his own family has sup
ported him.
"Mom is always terrified of a possible
injury and dad goes through the roller
coaster of emotions with me. They are so
supportive it's amazing. I've been real
lucky that they've trusted me to make my
own decision?," he said.
Today, despite his dedication to the foot
ball team, the most important part of his

life is his Christian identity. "My relation
ship with Christ propels me. I rely on it
heavily. It gets me through the hard prac
tices," he said.
Armour is a member of a Christian sup
port group called Athletes in Action. One
activity he particularly enjoys is Young
Life, a non-denominational community ser
vice organization in which he and Glyn Mil
burn spend time with the students at
Mountain View High School organizing
skits and singing songs.
This weekend against Southern Cal,
Armour will be confident in the support of
his family, his teammates and the thou
sands of Stanford fans cheering on the Car
dinal.

Catches such as this have become commonplace for the sure-handed sophomore
wide receiver Justin Armour.
In any sport, an athlete must have a spe
cial kind of drive to be successful. For
flanker Justin Armour, this motivation
comes from the encouragement of his per
sonal support group and his strong reli
gious convictions.
Hailing from Manitou Springs High
School near Colorado Springs, Colo.,
Armour originally came to the Cardinal as a
quarterback. Though he planned to red
shirt his freshman year, he was offered the
opportunity to play at the wide receiver
position. He jumped at the chance.
The first game he played for the Cardi
nal was the Colorado game last season. But
his opening year ended the very next week,
due to a tear in the arch of his foot, keeping
him on the bench for the rest of the year.
His summer was spent healing the injury
and preparing for his next opportunity to
play. Putting his experience into perspec
tive he said, "It was definitely frustrating,
but I did learn a lot."
The actual transition to wide receiver
was not very difficult for the 6-foot-6, 215-
lb. sophomore. In fact, it was not the first
transition he made in sports. Though he
played football in elementary school, he
preferred soccer. "I really didn't like foot
ball very much. I didn't enjoy getting hit so
I turned to other sports. Actually, I really
loved basketball," he said.
But times have changed. As he has
adjusted to his new role, he has also become
more comfortable with the team. "The first
year was frustrating," he explained. "As a
new guy on the team, it seemed like every
one was acting as if they were cool. But the
more I'm there, the more I've gotten to
know the players. And I love it. The guys

are great, and I'm proud to be a part of it."
Regarding his performance this year, he
was less enthusiastic. Confident that he has
put in a 100 percent effort, he is still disap
pointed with the mistakes he has made. "It
has been a season of ups and downs," he
said. "Beating Notre Dame will be hard to
forget, but we all still have room for
improvement."
The highlight of his season so far has
been his touchdown reception against
Notre Dame. "We were close to the goal
line. I ran a shallow crossing pattern and
outran my defender. Steve (Stenstrom)
threw it and we had a touchdown," he said.
Armour attributes the struggles the
team has faced this season tQ mistakes and a
very difficult conference, perhaps the tough
est in the nation. Looking forward to the
USC Trojans, Armour expects it to be a
tough, exciting game with Southern Cal's
traditionally flashy, fast, big-play style on
both sides of the ball. He hopes the Cardinal
will execute what they practiced this week.
He also hopes that the effort he has per
sonally invested will pay him dividends.
