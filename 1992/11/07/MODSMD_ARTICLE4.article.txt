# Stanford seeks to stifle speedy Trojans
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
With a second-place Pacific 10
Conference finish on the line,
there's no time for Cardinal fans to
mourn last week's loss. The USC
Trojans are currently playing out
standing football and have their
minds set on New Year's day glory.
On Oct. 3, the Trojans dropped
a close 17-10 decision to the Uni
versity of Washington in Seattle.
Since then, Southern Cal has pro
duced four consecutive Pac-10 vic
tories to run their record to 5-1-1
overall, 4-1 in the Pac-10. All of
this recent success has garnered
the Trojans a No. 11 ranking in
the latest Associated Press poll.
USC's offense is spearheaded
by a passing attack which boasts
two very quick receivers in Curtis
Conway and Johnnie Morton. So
far this year, Conway and Morton
have hauled in 56 catches, produc
ing 11 touchdowns. The man
delivering the ball to them is
sophomore Rob Johnson, who has
hit 90 of 148 passes for a 60.8
completion percentage, good for
sixth best in the nation.
The Trojan passing attack runs
up against its toughest assignment
in facing the Cardinal defense.
With pressure on the quarterback
complemented nicely by good cov
erage, Stanford boasts the second
ranked pass defense in the coun
try. Opponents have completed
only 42 percent of their passes
against the Cardinal for only 129.8
yards per game. In addition, the
defense has tallied 11 intercep
tions and 27 sacks, both of which
already better last season's perfor
mances in those areas.
The major question facing

Stanford, of course, is the ability of
the offensive line to protect quar
terback Steve Stenstrom. Last
week, Stenstrom was knocked out
of the game in the first half with a
sprained forearm. His mid-game
departures have become a familiar
sight for Cardinal fans.
The offensive line will have the
help of fullback J. J. Lasley, who has
been increasingly kept in the back
field to pick up blitzing defenders. If
Stenstrom receives time to throw,

he should be able to find favorite
targets Justin Armour and Mike
Cook, who have combined for 71
catches so far this season.
This should, in turn, open
things up for Heisman Trophy
candidate Glyn Milburn, who is
ranked second in the nation in all
purpose running with 186.1 yards
per game. If Milburn finishes the
season strong with some big
games, he has a chance to break
Trojan alum Marcus Allen's Pac

10 single season record of 2,259
all-purpose yards, set in 1981.
The biggest weakness of the
Stanford offense is quickness, a
problem particularly plaguing the
offensive line and the wide
receivers. In an effort to combat
this problem, head coach Bill
Walsh has kept his players out of
pads all week. Without any hit
ting, the hope is that the Cardinal
speed will be at its maximum for
today's contest, possibly enabling

them to compete with speedy
Southern Cal defensive backs.
"They've got good team speed,"
Lasley said of the Trojan defense.
"For that reason, I think it's a
good idea that we're going to have
fresh legs out there."
Perhaps the most interesting
matchup of the day is at punter,
where senior Paul Stonehouse will
be facing his alter-ego and little
brother John in a familial clash of
the titans. Both punters will be try
ing to impress their parents with
some booming kicks this afternoon.
"There's always been a battle
between us," John said. "Because
we're both athletes who strive to
be better than the other. I'll still
be rooting for him to punt well,
but then I'll just hope that Curtis
Conway returns it all the way."
But there's more than sibling
rivalry to this game. For Stanford,
USC yet another team in a long
list of difficult opponents who
stand in the way of a trip to a bowl
game. All told, the Cardinal will
face six teams ranked in this
week's AP Top 25, more than any
other team in the country.
That's not to say the Cardinal
doesn't feel any personal rivalry in
today's game. Since 1905, the Tro
jans hold a 47-22-3 record over the
collective Stanford heads.
Although Stanford pulled out a
24-21 victory'over USC in Los
Angeles last year, they have not
beaten the Trojans at Stanford
Stadium since 1970.
All of this, combined with the
grinding monotony of the Trojan
band's death march, has produced
a bit of rancor in at least one Stan
ford player. "We've got a lot to
prove," Lasley said. "And I don't
like those guys anyway."

Senior fullback Ellery Roberts and the rest of the Cardinal offense will have to shift it into high gear if
they are going to beat the Trojan defense.
