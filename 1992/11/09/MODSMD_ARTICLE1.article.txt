## Clinton picks Christopher as leader

President-elect Bill Clinton has
selected University trustee War
ren Christopher to direct his tran
sition team, earning applause
from Stanford administrators and
other trustees.
"He's almost perfect for the
role," said former University
President Donald Kennedy. "It's
hard to imagine a person better
suited for the role."
"He has a very quiet but effec
tive way of dealing with complicat
ed, difficult issues," said Chief Fi
nancial Officer Peter Van Etten.
Christopher, a Los Angeles cor
porate lawyer, graduated from
Stanford Law School in 1949 and
is in his fourth term on the Board
of Trustees. He was the board's
president from 1985-88.
Clinton named him Friday to
oversee the day-to-day operations
of the transfer of power. Along with

transition board
chairman Vernon
Jordan, Christo
pher will draft
recommenda
tions for selecting
a Cabinet, build
ing a White House
staff and filling
upward of 3,000
government jobs.

Van Etten said he "doubts"
Christopher's affiliation with the
University increases the chances
of Stanford people being selected
for the administration.
"He doesn't let partisan alle
giances get in the way of what is
best for this country," Kennedy
said. "He will simply get the best
people for the Clinton administra
tion. There are some Stanford
people who deserve attention, and
they will receive it."
Van Etten said he believes
Christopher can bring a "broad
understanding of the role of pri
