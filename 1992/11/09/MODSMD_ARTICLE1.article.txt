# Trustee to direct transition team
## Clinton picks Christopher as leader 
### Miranda Doyle Howard Libit Senior staff writers with AP wire reports 
President-elect Bill Clinton has
selected University trustee War
ren Christopher to direct his tran
sition team, earning applause
from Stanford administrators and
other trustees.
"He's almost perfect for the
role," said former University
President Donald Kennedy. "It's
hard to imagine a person better
suited for the role."
"He has a very quiet but effec
tive way of dealing with complicat
ed, difficult issues," said Chief Fi
nancial Officer Peter Van Etten.
Christopher, a Los Angeles cor
porate lawyer, graduated from
Stanford Law School in 1949 and
is in his fourth term on the Board
of Trustees. He was the board's
president from 1985-88.
Clinton named him Friday to
oversee the day-to-day operations
of the transfer of power. Along with

transition board
chairman Vernon
Jordan, Christo
pher will draft
recommenda
tions for selecting
a Cabinet, build
ing a White House
staff and filling
upward of 3,000
government jobs.

Van Etten said he "doubts"
Christopher's affiliation with the
University increases the chances
of Stanford people being selected
for the administration.
"He doesn't let partisan alle
giances get in the way of what is
best for this country," Kennedy
said. "He will simply get the best
people for the Clinton administra
tion. There are some Stanford
people who deserve attention, and
they will receive it."
Van Etten said he believes
Christopher can bring a "broad
understanding of the role of pri


Christopher
vate universities in this country's
future."
"For the last year he has
chaired a group of trustees look
ing at indirect-cost matters, and I
have been extremely impressed,"
Van Etten added.
Christopher began his latest
five-year term on the board last
December, according to James
Gaither, the former board presi

dent who succeeded him.
Christopher was a trustee for
five years in the mid-'7os, then
returned for two terms in 1981
and began his most recent stint
in 1991.
Gaither had high praise for
Christopher, calling him "just
awfully nice and thoughtful."
"He listens extremely well," he
said. "He has the highest ethical
standards."
The planning of Stanford's
Centennial and many of the
accomplishments of the '80s took
place under Christopher, Gaither

said. "There are veiy few people
in the history of the University
who have contributed more."
Gaither said he first heard of
Christopher while at Stanford
Law School in the early '60s.
"One of the legends of the
school," Christopher inter
viewed Gaither and offered him
a job.
They have worked together at
Stanford and in government ever
since. "His life is filled with ser
vice to our country," Gaither said.
Christopher is a veteran of
Democratic administrations dat

ing back to that of John F.
Kennedy. He was Jimmy Carter's
deputy secretary of state, deputy
attorney general in the Johnson
administration and a trade nego
tiator under Kennedy.
Most recently, he headed the
Christopher Commission, the
civilian panel that reviewed Los
Angeles Police Department con
duct after the beating of black
motorist Rodney King.
Six months ago, he led the
team that went through the list of
potential running mates and
helped Clinton choose Sen. A 1

Gore as the vice presidential can
didate.
Christopher said he told Clin
ton "I assumed I wouldn't be eli
gible for an appointment." Clin
ton aides, however, said the presi
dent-elect has not ruled out
Christopher for an administra
tion post.
Kennedy said Christopher
brings three important things to
the role — experience in govern
ment, "extraordinary judgement
of both people and process," and
connections.
Former Provost James Rosse,

now head of Freedom Newspaper,
Inc., in Irvine, Calif., also com
mended Clinton's choice of
Christopher as director of the
transition team.
"He is well-connected through
out the country. He has handled
difficult jobs here very well,"
Rosse said, calling Christopher
"level-headed" and "a good judge
of people."
"I can't say enough nice things
about my respect for him. He is
one of those rare individuals who
you just have to trust," Rosse
said.

transition board
chairman Vernon
Jordan, Christo
pher will draft
recommenda
tions for selecting
a Cabinet, build
ing a White House
staff and filling
upward of 3,000
government jobs.

Van Etten said he "doubts"
Christopher's affiliation with the
University increases the chances
of Stanford people being selected
for the administration.
"He doesn't let partisan alle
giances get in the way of what is
best for this country," Kennedy
said. "He will simply get the best
people for the Clinton administra
tion. There are some Stanford
people who deserve attention, and
they will receive it."
Van Etten said he believes
Christopher can bring a "broad
understanding of the role of pri


Christopher
vate universities in this country's
future."
"For the last year he has
chaired a group of trustees look
ing at indirect-cost matters, and I
have been extremely impressed,"
Van Etten added.
Christopher began his latest
five-year term on the board last
December, according to James
Gaither, the former board presi

dent who succeeded him.
Christopher was a trustee for
five years in the mid-'7os, then
returned for two terms in 1981
and began his most recent stint
in 1991.
Gaither had high praise for
Christopher, calling him "just
awfully nice and thoughtful."
"He listens extremely well," he
said. "He has the highest ethical
standards."
The planning of Stanford's
Centennial and many of the
accomplishments of the '80s took
place under Christopher, Gaither

said. "There are veiy few people
in the history of the University
who have contributed more."
Gaither said he first heard of
Christopher while at Stanford
Law School in the early '60s.
"One of the legends of the
school," Christopher inter
viewed Gaither and offered him
a job.
They have worked together at
Stanford and in government ever
since. "His life is filled with ser
vice to our country," Gaither said.
Christopher is a veteran of
Democratic administrations dat

ing back to that of John F.
Kennedy. He was Jimmy Carter's
deputy secretary of state, deputy
attorney general in the Johnson
administration and a trade nego
tiator under Kennedy.
Most recently, he headed the
Christopher Commission, the
civilian panel that reviewed Los
Angeles Police Department con
duct after the beating of black
motorist Rodney King.
Six months ago, he led the
team that went through the list of
potential running mates and
helped Clinton choose Sen. A 1

Gore as the vice presidential can
didate.
Christopher said he told Clin
ton "I assumed I wouldn't be eli
gible for an appointment." Clin
ton aides, however, said the presi
dent-elect has not ruled out
Christopher for an administra
tion post.
Kennedy said Christopher
brings three important things to
the role — experience in govern
ment, "extraordinary judgement
of both people and process," and
connections.
Former Provost James Rosse,

now head of Freedom Newspaper,
Inc., in Irvine, Calif., also com
mended Clinton's choice of
Christopher as director of the
transition team.
"He is well-connected through
out the country. He has handled
difficult jobs here very well,"
Rosse said, calling Christopher
"level-headed" and "a good judge
of people."
"I can't say enough nice things
about my respect for him. He is
one of those rare individuals who
you just have to trust," Rosse
said.
