# Dole wants Iran-Contra pardon
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate
Minority Leader Robert Dole yes
terday called for an investigation
of Iran-Contra prosecutor
Lawrence Walsh and said Presi
dent Bush should consider pardon
ing all defendants in the scandal.
Dole called Walsh's office "a
Democratic hotbed of Democratic
activist lawyers." A special prose
cutor from the Justice* Depart
ment should be brought in to
determine "whether or not politics
played any part" in a new indict
ment of ex-Defense Secretary Cas
par Weinberger, Dole said on
CBS's "Face the Nation."
Walsh was deputy attorney gen
eral in the Eisenhower administra
tion.
Walsh denied there was any
political motivation in the second

indictment of Weinberger, handed
up four days before the election. It
disclosed Bush's role in a Jan. 7,
1986 meeting about the Reagan
White House's arms-for-hostages
deals with Iran. The president spent
the final days of the campaign fend
ing off questions about the scandal.
Dole said the Oct. 30 grand jury
charge against Weinberger was
obtained by a newly hired Walsh
aide, James Brosnahan, who con
tributed $500 to Bill Clinton's cam
paign and whose law firm contribut
ed $20,000 to the Clinton campaign.
Dole suggested Clinton's cam
paign got advance notice from
Walsh's office about the new Wein
berger charges, because a Clinton-
Gore press release reacting to *he
indictment and focusing on Bush
was dated Oct. 29 — the day before

the indictment.
Clinton aides have said the date
was a misprint and that they
obtained information for their press
release from wire service accounts
after the indictment was handed up.
Walsh, in an interview yester
day with The Associated Press,
denied that there had been any
communication on the new Wein
berger charge between "me or my
office with anyone" in advance of
the indictment, except for an inter
agency group of intelligence
experts from the Bush administra
tion. That group reviews all pend
ing indictments in Walsh's Iran-
Contra investigation ahead of time
for possible classified information.
"That's the only group that had
any advance information about
the indictment," Walsh said.
