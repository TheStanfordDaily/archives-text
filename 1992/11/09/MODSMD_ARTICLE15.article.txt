THERE ARE VERY FEW eyes
on the ASSU Senate. If their
fliers are catchy enough,
they're looked at in the spring —
and if their names are catchy
enough, they're voted into office.
Very rarely do senators run for
re-election, so they are not subject
to direct re-evaluation by the stu
dent body. And even more rarely do
students have the opportunity or
the desire to view a senator's voting
records or arguments. It's worse
than the U.S. Senate before C
SPAN.
But when senators don't even
fulfill their most basic (and the only
required) responsibility — attend
ing the biweekly meetings — action
is needed to remove them.
Graduate senators Jamie Fer
nandez, Robin Ghio, Colin Hamp
son, Leonard Lopez and Amy
Zegart have been to none of the
three senate meetings.
Senate Chair Ron Brown placed
these five senators on displace

ment, and should continue efforts
to remove them from the senate.
However, Brown also put under
graduate senator Rafe Sagarin on
displacement. Although Sagarin
has not attended any of the meet
ings, he has an excuse — his elec
tion promise was precisely not to
attend these meetings.
Students chose Sagarin to voice
their dissatisfaction with the Sen
ate. Given the choice between a
senator and an unoccupied seat,
they chose the latter. Their desires
should be respected.
To place Sagarin on a list with
uncommitted graduate students is
unfair and disrespectful to the
democratic process. An exception
from the displacement rule should
be made in this case.
Sagarin is not shirking his
responsibility to the student body
by skipping out on these meetings.
To the contrary, he is fulfilling the
mandate he was delivered last
spring.
