# No resume stuffing

THE SENIOR CLASS presi
dents are not presidents.
Presidents are leaders, deci
sionmakers and centers of contro
versy. They do not spend the
majority of their time figuring out
whether Pudley's or the Goose
would work better for December.
This year's Senior Class presi
dents are a thoughtful, socially
adept group of people who have
done a good job. Once a week,
seniors can expect a pub night.
The Mausoleum party went
smoothly, as usual.
Senior Class presidents are
expected merely to pick a bar for
weekly pub nights, to put on a week
of "Dis-Orientation" in the spring
and shop for a parting gift to give
the school at the end of the year.
The position does not grant the
four presidents any real leadership
power. It is a figurehead position,

and it has failed at that; most
seniors don't know who their pres
idents are.
In a year in which the campus
preferred not to have figureheads
and were against campus leaders
in the form of a Council of Presi
dents, the office of Senior Calss
president rings hollow and untrue.
"Social Coordinators" would be
a more suitable title; it forces the
group to be honest about their
duties — honest to both the Stan
ford community and the outside
world who only know of the posi
tion by its title.
The senior class does not need
leaders. They need pub nights.
And they definitely don't need pub
night coordinators who call them
selves presidents. They proved
their disgust with the resume
stuffers concept last April. It's
time to respect that.
