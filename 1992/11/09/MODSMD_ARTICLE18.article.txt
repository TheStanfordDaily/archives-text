## Minute environmental effort 
### 
Dolphin-safe tuna is such a
beautiful environmental concept.
Who can resist the emotionally
powerful image of an innocent little Flip
per, the aquatic Lassie, tangled in a
death net, helplessly squeaking for
mercy? It reaches out and gives our
heartstrings a healthy tug. Dolphin-safe
tuna, we agree, is a Very Good Thing.
But why dolphins? What is it about
dolphins that makes us feel so environ
mental when we save them? Thousands
of armadillos become Texas road-kill
every day and we do nothing. But dol
phins are cute and easily trained.
Armadillos are ugly little beasts.
It seems kind of arbitrary, doesn't it?
Because dolphins are so adorable, a guy
who does nothing ecologically-conscious
all day can stop by Safeway, pick up a can
of the correct tuna and honestly feel he is
saving the Earth. Sure seems to involve a
lot of self-deception.
It reminds me of that sign that pops
up in White Plaza now and again, graph
ically describing how many trees Stan
ford students have saved through recy
cling efforts. Saved?
I picture Stanford students valiantly
chaining themselves to majestic Califor
nia redwoods, fending off loggers with
their SEAS mugs until the Evil Corpora
tion finally gives in. The foreman wipes
away a tear and lovingly pats a nearby
trunk. "These babies are going to live for

a long, long time," he whispers. "God
bless those Stanford kids."
Time out. I still use the copy machine.
And buy textbooks. And get mail. And do
a hundred other things that consume
paper, almost all of it virgin. But because
I put my old Dailys in a green trash bin,
I'm saving trees? It may be at an
insignificantly reduced rate, but I'm still
destroying boat-loads of forest. To claim
anything else is to rely pretty heavily on
euphemism.
I find it difficult to think of myself as
an energy conserver, since I've already
taken two roadtrips to L.A. this year for
Stanford football games. Compared to
the coal shaving I've saved by turning off
lights as I leave a room, they make it
pretty hard for me to picture myself as a
conservationist.
Unfortunately, that doesn't stop a lot
of other environmentalists-by-conve
nience from feeling very self-righteous
about their little contributions. Some
thing is wrong when I get scolded for
throwing away an aluminum can by a
girl who rides her scooter to class every
day, or when I listen to someone wearing
a leather jacket proudly explain that her
hand lotion isn't animal-tested.
Every little bit helps, of course. I'm
not denying that at all. But is it right for
us to overestimate the value of our little
bits so much? It seems dangerous to
ignore the bigger picture of our con

sumption — choosing instead to shed a
self-congratulatory light on our painless
little efforts. For any of us to honestly
imagine ourselves as conservationists is
an annoying phoniness that obscures the
reality of our situation.
Perhaps we can't move on to actual
progress without first laying this attitu
dinal foundation of false ecological
achievement. If we can convince people
to save the tiny, cute and huggable crit
ters today — the spotted owls, the baby
seals, the Emmanuel Lewises — maybe
it'll be a shorter step towards promoting
a more inclusive consciousness tomor
row.
I really hope that's true. But we need
to shed this myopia that allows us to
illustrate ourselves as heroes for recy
cling a few cans or car pooling to work.
Every little bit helps, but flaunting
these little bits while ignoring the awe
some significance of the bigger picture is
a dangerous game. See the world for
what it is, and try not to pat yourself on
the back too much. It's a good way to
break an arm.
