## David Hammerstad Depressed Stanford students unnoticed in community 
### 
'Depression' is a noun with a bland
tonality and lacking any magisterial
presence, used indifferently to describe
an economic decline or a rut in the
ground, a true wimp of a word for such
a major illness.
— William Styron, "Darkness Visible"
Approximately one in 10
Americans will suffer from
depression during their lifetime.
I am one of them.
Unlike the routine blue moods
which we all experience as a part of
everyday living, depression, the "com
mon cold of mental illness," is a more
severe and lasting mood disorder which
engenders the sufferer with clouded,
negative thinking, a loss of self-esteem,
lethargy and an unrealistic sense of
hopelessness. The graveness of the
disorder is misunderstood both because
it is so alien to most people, and
because of the imprecision of the ill
ness' label.
From its first signs during the sum
mer before I entered college, to its full
onset in the fall, until its waning at the
end of my senior year, its effects on my
personal and academic life at Stanford
were myriad.
A move away from the comfort of
familiar surroundings and friends to
college, an already difficult transition,
became truly daunting.
While I was only too aware that
something was going drastically wrong,
my own confusion and inability to
articulate clearly its symptoms or ori
gins, along with a conviction that my
condition was evidence of some person
al weakness, prevented me from
approaching others and seeking the
help I so desperately needed.
Moreover, an atmosphere of almost
forced happiness was promoted by the
residence staff of my freshman dorm —
ironically, "Don't Worry, Be Happy," a
number-one song during the summer

in which my depression began, was
adapted for use as a welcoming skit.
As I was so afraid of being a "down
er" and making a sour impression with
my new dormmates, who had never
seen the "real me," I usually responded
by withdrawing.
I began to feel that the pain of lone
liness was preferable to the discomfort
and awkwardness of subjecting relative
strangers to my gloominess — I felt
contagious, like the cloud that seemed
to follow me everywhere would cast a
dark shadow on others, and I was
afraid, in my needy condition, of slip
ping into a pattern of obnoxious depen
dency with any new friend I made.
When I returned for my sophomore
year and faced the possibility of a
repeat performance, I made the wisest
decision of my Stanford career and
entered therapy.
With the help of counseling and
antidepressants, I was able to manage
my depression better, regained some of
my confidence and interest in school,
and as time passed, improved my con
tacts and made some more solid friend
ships.
However, while the dark troughs of
depression became less intense, my
overall mood remained quite subdued.
To others, this lack of reaction was
often misinterpreted as mere stoicism,
or sometimes even as an admirable
steadiness, a Rock-of-Gibraltar-like
stability.
This past year I ran into a woman
whom I had met overseas the previous
year, and we made small talk about job
interviews. She reassured me, "You'll
do so well at that. You're so much
more even than the rest of us."
Unbeknownst to her, the reason I
had left the overseas program a month
early was because of a drug overdose I
had taken out of despair over my dete
riorating mood.

I now realize that this "systems
shutdown" emblematic of my depres
sion was a defense against a potential
flood of emotions pooling just under
the surface — primarily a suppressed
rage toward my parents. They are par
ents who rarely listen to me, who gave
me little self-esteem based on anything
other than my achievements and who
see me more as an extension of them
selves meant to fulfill their expecta
tions than as an independent person
meant to fulfill my own.
Probably more than a few Stanford
students share my feeling of being
loved more for what I did than for who
I was, and the emptiness and isolation
that results from being enclosed in a
glass trophy case.
I now realize that the impoverish
ment of the spirit that led to my near
total collapse under the weight of
depression was linked largely to my
treatment as a commodity rated on
performance rather than a human
appreciated for my uniqueness.
I don't know if it's because of the
terminally beautiful weather, or just a
general disposition common to many
Stanford students, but I have sensed a
reluctance among many of my class
mates to discuss or even admit to the
darker side of experience.
For me, the darker side of being at
Stanford included such uncomfortable
feelings as the humiliation of feeling
incompetent amid a sea of overachiev
ers, and the bitterness of watching oth
ers enjoying themselves seemingly
effortlessly.
And, while I may be an extreme
case, I think for many of us being at
Stanford could be a double-edged
sword.
The opportunity to meet bright and
interesting people from diverse back
grounds and study varied fields of
inquiry to a depth only previously

imagined, while exciting and invalu
able, can be fraught with uncertainty
and insecurity as sometimes long-held
assumptions are forcefully questioned
for the first time.
I now realize that my depression
happened for a reason, and that only
by learning its message could I hope to
conquer it.
I now have faith that the pain I felt
and sometimes continue to feel guides
me in the direction of more complete
spiritual health.
Opening ourselves up to the darker
side of experience and having the
patience to stay with our emotions
through the process of healing and
rebirth allows us to experience joy and
its fullness, not the one-dimensional
idea of "happiness" that comes from
denial.
