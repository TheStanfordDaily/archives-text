## Budget cuts cause athletic class fees 
### Brian Egan Editorial staff 
Faced with a $700,000 budget
shortfall over the next two years,
the Department of Athletics plans
to make up roughly half that
amount immediately by raising se
lected class fees and cutting funds
to its dance program.
More severe measures are on
the table for 1993-94, as changes
which could alter the depart
ment's structure — such as charg
ing for previously free exercise
classes and axing some programs
— could be implemented.
According to Assistant Athletic
Director Karen Bennett, the main
goal was to avoid adjusting the
curriculum. "We wanted to mini
mize the impact that [the cuts)
had on students," Bennett said.
"While fees were raised in some
classes, we did not want to elimi
nate any classes."
Although the department,
which offers over 200 courses an
nually, did not cut any of its pro
grams entirely, enrollment fees in

the martial arts programs were
raised from $35 to $50. About 350
students participate in the eight
different martial arts programs
offered every quarter.
In addition, the department re
duced its dance budget by approx
imately $40,000, a change which,
according to Assistant Athletic Di
rector Shirley Schoof, "reduces
the number of visiting lecturers
and demonstrations that we can
bring into the program."
About half of the $700,000
deficit is due to a University deci
sion to cut funds which had previ
ously subsidized the department's
"Varsity II" sports programs.
These teams, such as men's and
women's crew, which compete in
"non-major" sports on the Division
I National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation level, will receive extremely
limited funding in the future.
"Basically, there will be very
minimal financial support for Varsi
ty II sports" in the future, Bennett
said. "In general, these non-revenue
sports will become self-funded"
Other changes which have been
implemented this year include a
$5 raise in student greens fees at
Stanford Golf Course and a $15
charge for team participation in
intramural sports.
According to Bennett, the
adjustments made to the Athletics
Department's finances had been
discussed for the better part of a
year before they were enacted
"We held open meetings with
students [last] November and Jan
uary," said Bennett, "and we
reviewed our three-year plan with
the Committee on the Physical

Education Program, a group that
includes students, faculty and staff.
"The department received
quite a lot of support for the pro
posed changes from both groups,"
she added.
In general, both Bennett and
Schoof were satisfied with the cuts
made this year. "I feel that the '92-
'93 reductions had a very minimal
impact on the physical education
program," said Bennett.
Next year, however, the depart
ment must trim an additional
$400,000 from its budget to reach
the $700,000 goal. These cuts will
be felt more sharply than those
already made, according to Schoof.
"We don't know yet exactly
what we're going to do," Schoof
said. "But next year's cuts certain
ly won't be as easy as this year's."

While Bennett stressed that the
department was "just now begin
ning to discuss the 1993-94 bud
get," some changes under consid
eration for next year include elimi
nating the Stanford SCUBA pro
gram and charging enrollment fees
in previously free-of-charge classes
such as aerobics, swim condition
ing and weight training.
Other branches of the Athletics
Department likely to be affected by
cuts in 1993-94 include the club
sports program, which fields teams
in 13 different sports, and the mas
ter's program in dance.
The recent Athletics Depart
ment budget reductions come
despite additional revenue gener
ated by large football season ticket
sales and increased radio and tele
vision-rights fees for the sport.

"The football revenues support
the entire budget," Bennett said.
"It is very helpful to have
increased ticket sales and televi
sion revenues."
Associate Athletic Director
Tom Beckett agreed. "Money gen
erated from varsity sports is used
within the operations of the
department," he said.
While Bennett acknowledged
that further increases in varsity
sports revenue would alleviate
some of the department's econom
ic woes, she stressed that all cuts
made over the next two years will
be permanent.
"I considered all of these reduc
tions to be base reductions," she
said. "We were not looking for
temporary solutions to the (bud
get) problem."

While Bennett stressed that the
department was "just now begin
ning to discuss the 1993-94 bud
get," some changes under consid
eration for next year include elimi
nating the Stanford SCUBA pro
gram and charging enrollment fees
in previously free-of-charge classes
such as aerobics, swim condition
ing and weight training.
Other branches of the Athletics
Department likely to be affected by
cuts in 1993-94 include the club
sports program, which fields teams
in 13 different sports, and the mas
ter's program in dance.
The recent Athletics Depart
ment budget reductions come
despite additional revenue gener
ated by large football season ticket
sales and increased radio and tele
vision-rights fees for the sport.

"The football revenues support
the entire budget," Bennett said.
"It is very helpful to have
increased ticket sales and televi
sion revenues."
Associate Athletic Director
Tom Beckett agreed. "Money gen
erated from varsity sports is used
within the operations of the
department," he said.
While Bennett acknowledged
that further increases in varsity
sports revenue would alleviate
some of the department's econom
ic woes, she stressed that all cuts
made over the next two years will
be permanent.
"I considered all of these reduc
tions to be base reductions," she
said. "We were not looking for
temporary solutions to the (bud
get) problem."
Faced with a $700,000 budget
shortfall over the next two years,
the Department of Athletics plans
to make up roughly half that
amount immediately by raising se
lected class fees and cutting funds
to its dance program.
More severe measures are on
the table for 1993-94, as changes
which could alter the depart
ment's structure — such as charg
ing for previously free exercise
classes and axing some programs
— could be implemented.
According to Assistant Athletic
Director Karen Bennett, the main
goal was to avoid adjusting the
curriculum. "We wanted to mini
mize the impact that [the cuts)
had on students," Bennett said.
"While fees were raised in some
classes, we did not want to elimi
nate any classes."
Although the department,
which offers over 200 courses an
nually, did not cut any of its pro
grams entirely, enrollment fees in

the martial arts programs were
raised from $35 to $50. About 350
students participate in the eight
different martial arts programs
offered every quarter.
In addition, the department re
duced its dance budget by approx
imately $40,000, a change which,
according to Assistant Athletic Di
rector Shirley Schoof, "reduces
the number of visiting lecturers
and demonstrations that we can
bring into the program."
About half of the $700,000
deficit is due to a University deci
sion to cut funds which had previ
ously subsidized the department's
"Varsity II" sports programs.
These teams, such as men's and
women's crew, which compete in
"non-major" sports on the Division
I National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation level, will receive extremely
limited funding in the future.
"Basically, there will be very
minimal financial support for Varsi
ty II sports" in the future, Bennett
said. "In general, these non-revenue
sports will become self-funded"
Other changes which have been
implemented this year include a
$5 raise in student greens fees at
Stanford Golf Course and a $15
charge for team participation in
intramural sports.
According to Bennett, the
adjustments made to the Athletics
Department's finances had been
discussed for the better part of a
year before they were enacted
"We held open meetings with
students [last] November and Jan
uary," said Bennett, "and we
reviewed our three-year plan with
the Committee on the Physical

Education Program, a group that
includes students, faculty and staff.
"The department received
quite a lot of support for the pro
posed changes from both groups,"
she added.
In general, both Bennett and
Schoof were satisfied with the cuts
made this year. "I feel that the '92-
'93 reductions had a very minimal
impact on the physical education
program," said Bennett.
Next year, however, the depart
ment must trim an additional
$400,000 from its budget to reach
the $700,000 goal. These cuts will
be felt more sharply than those
already made, according to Schoof.
"We don't know yet exactly
what we're going to do," Schoof
said. "But next year's cuts certain
ly won't be as easy as this year's."
