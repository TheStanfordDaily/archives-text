## Budget cuts cause athletic class fees 
### Brian Egan Editorial staff 
Faced with a $700,000 budget
shortfall over the next two years,
the Department of Athletics plans
to make up roughly half that
amount immediately by raising se
lected class fees and cutting funds
to its dance program.
More severe measures are on
the table for 1993-94, as changes
which could alter the depart
ment's structure — such as charg
ing for previously free exercise
classes and axing some programs
— could be implemented.
According to Assistant Athletic
Director Karen Bennett, the main
goal was to avoid adjusting the
curriculum. "We wanted to mini
mize the impact that [the cuts)
had on students," Bennett said.
"While fees were raised in some
classes, we did not want to elimi
nate any classes."
Although the department,
which offers over 200 courses an
nually, did not cut any of its pro
grams entirely, enrollment fees in

the martial arts programs were
raised from $35 to $50. About 350
students participate in the eight
different martial arts programs
offered every quarter.
In addition, the department re
duced its dance budget by approx
imately $40,000, a change which,
according to Assistant Athletic Di
rector Shirley Schoof, "reduces
the number of visiting lecturers
and demonstrations that we can
bring into the program."
About half of the $700,000
deficit is due to a University deci
sion to cut funds which had previ
ously subsidized the department's
"Varsity II" sports programs.
These teams, such as men's and
women's crew, which compete in
"non-major" sports on the Division
I National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation level, will receive extremely
limited funding in the future.
"Basically, there will be very
minimal financial support for Varsi
ty II sports" in the future, Bennett
said. "In general, these non-revenue
