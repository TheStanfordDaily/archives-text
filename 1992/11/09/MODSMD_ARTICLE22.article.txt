## Pilots crash land, Cardinal soars in soccer victory 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
The No. 3 Portland women's
soccer team was lucky, but No. 4
Stanford was good. And, for once,
superior play won as the Cardinal
massacred the Pilots 5-2 en route
to the NCAA quarterfinals.
Stanford dominated the game
from the outset as the Cardinal
bombarded Portland with 14
shots on goal in the first half.
Although the Pilots only man
aged five shots, they took a 2-0
lead midway through the first
half on two breakaways.
On one of their first posses
sions in Cardinal territory, the
Pilots took advantage of an
unprepared defense by quick
kicking a free kick to get the ball
to an open Tiffeny Milbrett. The
high scoring forward sliced
toward the right post as sweeper
Jessica Fischer maneuvered for a
tackle. However, goalie Chris
Massell called for the ball and
came out to challenge the speedy
attacker. Keying off Massell's
call, Millbrett lofted the ball over
her and into the vacant net.
Less than a minute later, the
Pilots again caught the defense
off guard and scored on a low shot
by Shannon MacMillan, the sec
ond half of Portland's scoring
duo.
"Even after they scored I
wasn't scared because we had
been dominating so much," said
Cardinal forward Sarah Rafanel
li. "We didn't change the way we
played. We knew we could play
even with them, at least, so we
just forgot about the goals and
played our game."
Staying composed but intense,
the Cardinal continued to pres
sure the Pilots.

"They kept coming at us," Mil
brett said. "Even though we had
two goals, it was just as stressful.
They were relaxed, so that
enabled them to play together as
a team. That was the difference in
the game. When you're relaxed,
you really know what to do. When
you're not relaxed, you can't
make decisions."
Stanford was clearly the
calmer squad and, after Fischer
thwarted a third Portland break
away with a slide tackle, the game
was all Cardinal.
Stanford got on the scoreboard
at 23 minutes, 54 seconds with a
one-touch poke by Rafanelli who
was assisted by Julie Foudy and
Melinda Minstrell.
Near the end of the half, the
Cardinal received a scare when
the referee gave Foudy a yellow
card, a warning — one step away
from an ejection. Moments
before, Foudy had collided with
the Pilot goalie, who had posses
sion of the ball. While the senior
team-captain didn't get carded for
that play, she did seconds later,
when she argued a foul called on
teammate Jen Stephan.
"I think [the ref] was just try
ing to warn me," Foudy said. "I
wasn't worried that he was going
to red card me.
"He had been telling me the
whole game not to argue with
him," she added, explaining why
she wasn't carded for the collision
with the Portland keeper. "I don't
think I went in unfairly, I was
just playing hard. I think he real
ized the difference."
The warning didn't faze Foudy
as she scored minutes later on a
lucky shot along the Pilots' end
line. Foudy centered a pass across
the goal mouth and, just when it
looked like the goalie would cra

dle the ball, it ricocheted off a
defender's hip and into the net.
The goal gave Stanford a 2-2
tie going into halftime. Portland
tried to regroup at intermission
but once play resumed, midfield
ers Carmel Murphy and Foudy
thwarted the Pilots' attempts to
get the ball to their offensive
weapons, Milbrett and MacMil
lan.
"[Foudy and Murphy] domi
nated midfield from start to fin
ish," said Portland coach Clive
Charles. "We had no answer for
them. When we got into their
backline, we murdered them. But
we couldn't get the ball to our for
wards enough, simply because
No. 11 and 13 wore out five of our
players.
"After five minutes we knew
we needed to bypass them, but we
couldn't get the ball by them," he
added. "They won everything in
the air and they won every tackle.
Every ball our goalkeeper kicked
came straight back."
Midway through the second
period, a three-goal flurry put the
Cardinal ahead for good.
Sweeper Jessica Fischer scored
on a penalty kick after Rafanelli
was fouled in front of the Pilot
goal. Less than two minutes
later, Murphy dribbled her way
through the Portland defense and
launched a shot into the far cor
ner of the net. Foudy padded the
lead with another tally on a goal
mouth scramble, as Rafanelli
notched her second assist on the
day.
With the 5-2 victory, Stanford
is coming into playoff form, said
Cardinal coach Berhane Andeber
han.
