# Volleyball annihilates pathetic Pac-10 competition
## Stanford topples Arizona, ASU in record-breaking weekend matches 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
After playing its final home confer
ence matches, the Stanford women's
volleyball team has'demonstrated why
they're one of the top two teams in the
nation.
The Cardinal (20-2, 13-2 in Pacific
10 Conference) swept Arizona and No.
14 Arizona State at Maples Pavilion
last weekend in convincing fashion,
defeating the Sun Devils on Friday 15-
2, 15-6, 15-7, then returning on Satur
day to down the Wildcats 15-9, 15-10,
15-4.
Stanford put on an offensive clinic
in the two matches, hitting .419 as a
team against Arizona, and posting a
school-record hitting average of .519

against ASU. Stanford hit a combined
.462 for this weekend's matches, and
Friday's hitting percentage against
Arizona State was good for fifth-best
in Pac-10 history â€” and was the best
for a Pac-10 team this year.
Friday's match against Arizona
State (20-5, 9-5 in Pac-10 play) repre
sented perhaps the Cardinal's best
team offensive performance of the sea
son, as all 11 Stanford players hit .300
or over, including five over .500.
"Our performance was very encour
aging," Stanford head coach Don Shaw
said. "We found out how good we can
play, and that has moved our expecta
tions up a notch. The job for us now is
to get that kind of match every night."
Stanford dominated the match
from start to finish, holding ASU to a

.146 team hitting average, while com
mitting only seven total hitting errors
all match. Seniors Kristi Paaso and tri
captain Bev Oden led the Cardinal
scorers with nine kills each, with a
.643 hitting percentage for Paaso and
a .692 average with two aces and four
blocks for Oden.
Freshman Cary Wendell added a
.545 hitting percentage with seven
kills and six digs, while Jennifer Jack
son tallied six kills and six digs for a
.300 average. Senior tri-captain Carrie
Feldman and junior Piper Hahn
shared setting duties, with Feldman
posting 26 assists and Hahn adding 13.
Stanford also got some of its best
play of the year from the bench. Fresh
men Marnie Triefenbach and Wendy
Hromadka came into the match and

registered solid numbers for the Cardi
nal, with Triefenbach hitting .444 with
five kills and an ace, and Hromadka
averaging .429 with four kills. As a
unit, the Cardinal bench hit .440 with
14 total kills in the match.
On Saturday, Stanford continued to
roll with a 3-0 win over Arizona (8-14,
2-12 in Pac-10 play). In a match that
saw action from a number of Cardinal
players, Stanford had little problem
handling the struggling Wildcats,
holding them to a .222 average for the
match. Stanford, on the other hand,
continued to execute well on offense,
hitting .438 as a team with seven play
ers hitting .400 or above.
