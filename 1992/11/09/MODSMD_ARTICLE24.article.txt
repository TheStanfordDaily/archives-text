# Stanford drowns USC, falls to Golden Bears
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
National rankings predict out
comes rather infrequently. They
proved correct last weekend, how
ever, as Stanford's second-ranked
water polo team split its two
games with No. 1 California and
No. 3 USC at deGuerre Pool this
Saturday and Sunday.
Still, the Cardinal's perfor
mance solidified its bid for the
second seed in the NCAA champi
onship tournament.
Despite the close score of 7-6,
Stanford dominated Southern
Cal for most of the Saturday
encounter. The Cardinal pounced
upon the unsuspecting Trojans,
jumping to a 3-0 lead in the first
quarter. Southern Cal pulled
within one by halftime, but Stan
ford surged to a 7-2 lead by the
end of the third quarter.
"From there we sat on our
lead," said Cardinal head coach
Dante Dettamanti. Indeed, the
Trojans out-gunned Stanford 4-0
in the final quarter — only to run
out of time.
Senior John Matarangas and
freshman Jeremy Laster paced
the Cardinal scoring with two
goals each. Sophomore Wolf
Wigo, junior Antonio Busquets
and freshman Josh Leachman
each contributed one goal.
On Sunday, despite the Golden
Bears' antics, with Cal players
changing Speedos in the water
and figuring out that two plus six
does not make up a legal squad of
seven, the Bears defeated Stan
ford, 11-7.
Cal led 3-1 after one quarter,
with Stanford's only point coming
from a Matarangas penalty shot.
In the second quarter, the Bears

roared to a 5-1 advantage on a six
on-five power play and a free
throw. However, the Cardinal
pulled to within two by the half
from a Busquets fast-break coun
terattack score and a Laster out
side shot.
As the momentum shifted,
Stanford cut its deficit to 5-4 in
the third quarter, prompting a
Cal time-out. Then the Bears took
over once again.
The Cardinal could not capital
ize on three of four second half
six-on-five opportunities, or on a
penalty shot. All the while, Cal
converted two of three chances
and even scored on a behind-the
back shot. Stanford got to within
three with 1 minute 55 seconds
remaining in the final quarter,
but the Bears sealed their victory
on a score with 1:37 left.
The missed opportunities that
plagued the Cardinal turned out
to be the difference in the con
frontation. Overall, Stanford took
advantage of only two of six six
on-five situations, and Wigo
couldn't hit two penalty shots.
"Our guys played their tails
off," Dettamanti said. "But some
times effort isn't enough. It's
simply a matter of Cal being No. 1
in the nation."
Wigo's three goals led the Car
dinal scoring, while Busquets,
Matarangas, Laster and Leach
man each added one to the lost
cause.
"I still think we can beat
them," said Dettamanti. "We've
just got to play a perfect game to
beat Cal."
Stanford will have opportunity
in the near future, as they begin
preparations for Big Splash week
end at Berkeley November 21 and
then for the NCAA tournament.
