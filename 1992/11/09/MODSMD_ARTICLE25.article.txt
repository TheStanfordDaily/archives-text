# Washington wins in heartbreaking Cardinal face-off
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Over the weekend, the Stanford men's soc
cer team experienced both their most exhila
rating victory and their most crushing defeat
of the season in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation playoffs held in Washington's
Husky Stadium.
Heading into the tournament, the Cardi
nal (12-6-1) needed to sweep both of their
contests in order to secure an NCAA Tourna
ment berth. That goal was well within reach
after the first game, as unseeded Stanford
upset sixth-seed UCLA 2-1 on penalty kicks
in first-round action.
Senior goalkeeper and co-captain Kyle
Krpata had the "game of his life", according
to head coach Colin Lindores, as he nearly
shutout a powerful Bruin offense led by
Olympic star Joe-Max Moore. UCLA's only
goal of the contest resulted from a question
able penalty called against the Cardinal mid
way through the first half. Moore converted
the penalty kick to put the Bruins up 1-0.
Later in the half, Stanford stormed back to
tie the score on forward Ricky Goad's goal
against the nation's premier goalkeeper and
Olympic hopeful, Brad Friedel. Cardinal
leading scorer Jason Vanacour set up Goad's
shot with a perfect cross in front of the penal
ty box for his fourth assist of the year.
The score then remained knotted at 1-1
through regulation play and four overtime
periods as both teams mirrored each other in
style and performance.
UCLA squandered a chance to end the
game with two seconds left in double over
time when Moore intercepted a Krpata pass
in the penalty box. The Bruin forward then
rifled an easy shot from five yards away but
was denied by Krpata on what he called an
"amazing save that was all in the reflexes."
Stanford then prevailed on penalty kicks
by a slim four to three advantage. Vanacour,
Goad, Randy Mann and Jim Talluto account
ed for the Cardinal points, and Krpata
blocked the Bruins' last two shots to provide
the margin of victory.
"Kyle consistently frustrated their offense
throughout the game," Lindores said. "Every
time they would come close to scoring he
would always come up with the big game-sav
ing blocks."
After defeating UCLA (12-3-2), the Cardi
nal advanced to the finals against llth-seed
ed Washington (14-2-3). Stanford was look
ing to avenge their regular season 1-0 loss to
the Huskies, but fell short as Washington
won the MPSF crown and an automatic bid
into the NCAA Tournament with another 1-
0 squeaker past the Cardinal.
Freshman Brian McNeil booted in Wash
ington's game-winning goal 53 seconds into
the first overtime period on a penalty kick
against the Cardinal. Besides the Husky goal,
both teams were held scoreless in a match
marred by heavy rains and occasional hail.
By dropping the Washington contest, the
Cardinal might have eliminated themselves
from the NCAA Tournament. Official word
on first-round pairings and wild-card teams
will be announced this morning at 10 a.m.
