# Unsung heroes shine against USC
## Cardinal offense kicks in for promising Stanford victory 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
Before Saturday's contest against USC, the Car
dinal offense had struggled to move the ball for five
consecutive weeks. This week, however, the team
saw the emergence of some unsung heroes whose
performance keyed the Stanford attack.
Senior fullback J.J. Lasley had the game of his
life, shredding the Trojan defense with nine catches
for 125 yards. He also added six carries for 23 yards
to his output. His biggest play, however, was a 38-
yard touchdown catch with 2 minutes, 48 seconds
left in the first quarter.
"Normally, I catch a pass in the flat for six or
eight yards," Lasley said. "But I saw Justin Armour
busting downfield to make a block so I said 'What
the hell. I'm going to cut it back'."
Lasley caught only 26 passes in the first nine
games of the season. His expanded role was due
largely to head coach Bill Walsh, who saw that the
Trojan game plan didn't defend the fullback posi
tion. "The flats were open and we exploited that
well," Lasley added.
The offensive line's improved play allowed the
Cardinal to move the ball effectively the entire
game. In an effort to shake things up and spare
Stenstrom his weekly pounding, senior Chris Dal
man was moved from his usual spot at right guard
to left tackle, a position he hadn't played since high
school.
"I guess I did pretty well for the situation," Dal
man said. "I don't think I gave up a sack."
The offensive line, however, did surrender five
sacks, which meant five rousing renditions of the
Queen hit "Another One Bites the Dust." Overall,
however Stenstrom had a lot more time to throw
than in previous weeks, and never was hit so hard
that he couldn't pick himself up from the turf.
Although the offense moved the ball well, it con
tinued to have trouble finding the end zone. The
Cardinal only generated one touchdown, despite
gaining 391 yards. Since many drives stalled in Tro
jan territory, the presence of placekicker Eric

Abrams saved the game for the Cardinal.
Abrams capped off the opening drive of the game
with a 47-yard field goal that left no doubt as to
whether or not he has enough distance; the kick
probably would have been good from 55 yards had
he needed it. In the second quarter, he went on to
nail a chip shot from 23 yards to give Stanford a 13-
0 lead.

'Night games are perfect. The
ball seems to carry real well. I
just had to make sure I got a
good plant because it was a little
slippery.'
— Eric Abrams

Under the cover of darkness, Abrams connected
on a 49-yard attempt to give the Cardinal a 16-3
advantage with 9 minutes and 41 seconds left in the
game. This equaled his longest field goal of the sea
son, made even more difficult by the fact that dew
had settled on the grass.
"Night games are perfect," Abrams said. "The
ball seems to carry real well. I just had to make
sure I got a good plant because it was a little slip
pery."
With his perfect game against USC, Abrams has
now made 15 of 17 field goals and all 21 of his extra
points this season. His consistency has been crucial
for an offense that often fails to finish off drives
with touchdowns.
"He's a godsend," Walsh marveled. "He just does
a marvelous job."
With two more tough games left on the regular
season schedule, the emergence of normally unsung
players represents a welcome lift for the often
struggling Cardinal offense.
