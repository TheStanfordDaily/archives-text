# Too much emphasis on appearance
## Health-conscious, pressure-filled environment fosters eating disorders 
### Liesl Olson Staff writer 
After eating enough to make her feel
guilty, "Laura" would immediately "get rid
of' the food by running 15 miles.
Laura, not her real name, is one of many
Stanford women caught in an eating-disor
der cycle.
While most everyone knows that Stanford
is a very fitness-oriented place, many don't
realize that this body-conscious environment
repeatedly fosters eating disorders, say con
cerned students and professionals.
Junior Andrea Marmor, coordinator for
the campus outreach program "Body Image,
Food and Self-Esteem," believes there are
many factors particular to Stanford that
make it easy to develop an eating disorder at
the University.
"It's fashionable to be healthy at Stan
ford. When freshman get here, they're sur
rounded by people who are very academically
competitive. Your outward appearance
becomes another way to compete and mea
sure your self-worth," Marmor said.
Parental pressure can also add to the
stress that causes eating disorders.
"I was expected to be the model child in all
areas. This pressure largely caused my eating
disorder," said a recovering bulimic who
wished to remain anonymous.
Marmor developed anorexia nervosa her
freshman year at Williams College and then
transferred to Stanford as a sophomore. She
believes that Williams and Stanford are sim
ilar in that "both schools have this out
doorsy, athletic image to uphold, on top of
being academically rigorous."
"It's actually more drastic at Stanford

than at Williams," Marmor said.
The pressure around her to work out and
eat healthily contributed to Marmor's eating
disorder.
"It started very quickly when I began
becoming obsessive about exercising and cut
ting out foods. 44 Marmor said. "It was per
petuated by people around me who would
only reaffirm my actions by saying how great
I looked so thin."
Dr. Karen Huang, director of the Body
Image Group at Counseling and Psychological
Services of Cowell Student Health Center
hears many women talk about how "people at
Stanford are very homogeneous in appear
ance. You must look good â€” not fat and not
flabby.
"Technically there is diversity at Stan
ford. But in body type and dress, it's not all
that diverse compared to other schools like
Berkeley or Harvard." Huang said.
Marmor believes that many schools, par
ticularly on the East Coast, do not have as
much focus on appearance.
"At schools like MIT or Swarthmore, it's
actually trendy to look like a slob," she said.
A sign of a poor body image can be detect
ed "if a person spends more time thinking
about their body and food than a 5-unit
class," said Huang.
"If you feel like food and exercise is out of
hand for you, then it probably is," Marmor
said.
Marmor finally received medical help
when she went into the student health center
at Williams for a sinus infection and the doc
tor immediately noticed how thin she was.
Her parents were contacted and she entered
a hospital for treatment.
Yet Marmor lapsed back into her same

patterns during the year she took off
between Williams and Stanford.
M I couldn't change my eating patterns
until I really wanted to [change] myself. At
first, I was just doing it for other people.
Until I was willing to change myself, I wasn't
going to get better," Marmor said.
Marmor now coordinates "Body Image,
Food and Self Esteem," an outreach program
in which a few Stanford women talk about
their personal experiences with eating disor
ders to students in dorms and classes.
"Gating disorders are the most underrat
ed issue for women on this campus," said
sophomore Melissa Paoloni. "It's a topic
[that is] pushed under the rug, when its
prevalence calls out for it to be talked about."
The program begins with factual informa
tion on anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa
and overeating. It leads to a discussion about
the environment at Stanford that many stu
dents feel can foster eating disorders.
"What is important to remember is that a
person must be very unhappy with them
selves in order to develop an eating disorder,"
said Dr. Regina Casper, an expert on anorex
ia nervosa. "There are always emotional
problems underlying an eating disorder that
must be dealt with," she said.
Students frequently ask how they should
approach someone they think has an eating
disorder. Marmor said she believes simply
letting the person know "you care about
them and that what they're doing hurts you
as a friend because they're hurting them
selves" is the best approach.
Marmor's goals for the group this year
include addressing eating disorders within
the Athletics Department and getting health
information posted in dining halls.
