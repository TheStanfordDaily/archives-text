# Not just Stanford's first lady
## Psychiatrist Regina Casper leads her own life as an eating disorder specialist

Mrs. Gerhard Casper who?
That's Dr. Regina Casper, please.
The latest addition to the Medical School's
Psychiatry Department — University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper's wife — is very much her
own woman.
And then some.
"I am not Stanford's first lady," she insists.
"I consider myself the wife of the president of
the university — nothing more.
"There is no contradiction involved," she
says. "One involves a social circle, and the
other my professional life."
The Caspers, in fact, are both professionals,
but in different fields: President Casper is a
lawyer; Regina Casper is a psychiatrist. She has
a distinguished track record as a practicing doc
tor and is an acclaimed expert on certain mental
disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa.
Casper has also co-edited two books about

eating disorders and has published many arti
cles and papers. She is a fellow of the American
Psychiatric Association and serves on the edi
torial boards of a dozen journals.
In order to join Stanford, Casper gave up her
position as professor of psychiatry at the Uni
versity of Chicago. As at Stanford,
she will teach medical students and residents,
in addition to pursuing her research activities.
"We're fortunate to have her," said Dr. Alan
Schatzberg, chair of the psychiatry depart
ment. "She is a distinguished expert in anorex
ia nervosa and an important role model on
campus."
In fact, her reputation is such that Gerhard
Casper is known as "her husband" in academic
circles of psychiatry. When she first came to
Stanford, she overheard someone saying of the
president-elect, "I hope he's the husband of
Regina Casper."
"There are functions that I attend on account
of the position my husband holds — and that's

OK," she says of the tensions involved in wearing
two caps at the same time. "But I've always been
a professional myself. If I had been a lawyer,
things possibly might have been difficult."
Casper, in fact, came to psychiatry elliptical*
ly. Her fifst interest was internal medicine, but
she switched fields when she joined the Uni
versity of Chicago.
"You cletn invent it individually as you go
along," she says of psychiatry. "Most other
areas in medicine follow predetermined rules."
The Caspers met in 1962, at a function or
ganized for the winners of a scholarship in the
city of Freiburg in the former West Germany.
"The scholarship foundation had assigned
different professors to different groups of stu
dents who had gathered," she recalls. "He had
a 'boring professor' assigned to him so he de
cided to come over and chat with me instead.
"I think the first time we went out together
