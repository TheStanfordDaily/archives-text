# Football rips through Trojans

Stanford's roller coaster season hit another peak
Saturday, as the rejuvenated Cardinal knocked off
USC for the second consecutive year, 23-9, in front
of over 72,000 fans at Stanford Stadium.
After seeing their Rose Bowl hopes go up in
smoke during last weekend's humbling loss to
Washington, Stanford got back into the running
for a New Year's Day appearance with an impres
sive performance on both sides of the ball.
The Cardinal defense, which had looked tenta
tive in the past three weeks, rediscovered an "in
your-face" style of play that created four sacks and

five Trojan turnovers. And Steve Stenstrom, with
a 273-yard performance, led a offensive unit with a
few new wrinkles in the playbook to one of its best
efforts of the season.
As scouts from both the Fiesta Bowl and Free
dom Bowl looked on, the Cardinal beat USC for the
first time at home since 1970. The Jan. 1 Fiesta
Bowl is planning to offer a bid to the Pacific 10
Conference runner-up, while the Pac-10's third
place finisher is committed to the Freedom Bowl.
But coach Bill Walsh and his club weren't about
to let postseason contingencies overshadow a
hard-fought victory against the nation's 11th-

ranked team. "I think we played a
great game, maybe our best game
of the year," Walsh said. "We're
really proud to think that this
year we beat Notre Dame, UCLA
and USC — and we're still
rolling."
Free safety John Lynch, who
sealed the game with an intercep
tion return for a touchdown in the
final two minutes, felt the Cardi
nal's rebound Saturday had more
than a little to do with the team's
new-found perspective.

too much to the
Rose Bowl.'

"I think (not worrying about
the Rose Bowl) was good this
week," Lynch said. "It's good to
have goals, but we were looking
too much to the Rose Bowl. When
that was taken from us, we just
got back to taking it one game at a
time. I know it sounds like a big
cliche, but that's what got us here
and we got back to that this
week."
With the win, Stanford (7-3, 4-
2 in Pac-10 play) jumped into a
three-way tie with USC and
Washington State for third in the
conference. The Cardinal also
leapt six spots to No. 15 in the lat
est Associated Press poll. The Tro
jans fell to 5-2-1 and plummeted
seven slots to No. 18.
Saturday's triumph gave Stan
ford back-to-back victories over
USC for the first time since 1970-

71. Last year's game was a water
shed contest for both teams. After
the Cardinal came from behind in
the waning moments to win 24-21
in the Coliseum, they went on a
seven-game winning streak and
finished the regular season 8-3.
The Trojans went winless the rest
of the way.
The fact that this season's
game could serve as a similar
turning point was not lost on
many players; especially not on
senior inside linebacker Tom
Williams, who inspired his team
mates with a pre-game motiva
tional speech.
"I just issued a challenge,"
Williams said. "I reminded every
one what coach Green said last
year — that the USC game was a
turning point for both teams, that
we went on to a bowl and they
didn't win another game all year. I
reminded them that it could be
the same way this year."
The Cardinal responded to
Williams' challenge.
"After Tom got up and talked
about last year, you could see the
determination in everyone's eyes,
that we were going to win the
game no matter what happened,"
said outside linebacker Ron
George.
"This gives us a lot of confi
dence going into the last two
games because USC is a tremen
dous opponent. And if you can
beat USC, then the sky's the limit
to what you can do."
George, Williams and fellow
linebacker Dave Garnett put
together a pass rush that gave
Trojan quarterbacks Rob Johnson
and Reggie Perry fits all evening.
The secondary benefited from
the pressure, but had a great
night of its own. Each of the start
ing four defensive backs had an
interception. Darrien Gordon and
Seyon Albert (off a Vaughn

Bryant tip) both killed Trojan
drives with pick-offs in the end
zone.
Stanford's most imposing
defensive task was to shut down
flanker/kick returner Curtis Con
way, a budding Heisman hopeful.
And shut him down they did.

to just three catches for 16 yards,
before he sprinted for 61 yards
on a short pass after the game
was already decided. On kick
returns, Conway was never a fac
tor as the Cardinal kicked away
from him, or out of bounds, all
evening.
Stanford's offense, on the
other hand, was laden with out
standing individual perfor
mances. Fullback J.J. Lasley
hauled in nine receptions for 125
yards, including a 38-yarder for a
touchdown that gave the Cardi
nal a 10-0 halftime lead.
Ellery Roberts rushed for 66
yards on eight carries, and keyed
a fourth quarter drive that ran
precious minutes off the clock
with runs of 33 and 11 yards.
Most impressive of all was the
leg of freshman placekicker Eric
Abrams. Abrams, who Walsh
accurately described as an "abso
lute godsend," converted on
attempts from 23, 47 and 49
yards. His three-for-three per
formance leaves him at 15-for-17
(88%) on the year.
