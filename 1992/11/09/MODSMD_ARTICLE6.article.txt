Calling for "a cultural agenda
for a society that is completely out
of control," controversial theater,
opera and film director Peter Sell
ars addressed a crowd of artsy
types and their parents Friday in
Annenberg Auditorium.
Co-sponsored by the Dance Di
vision, the Art, Drama and Music
Departments and the Humanities
Center, Sellars' lecture was titled
"Irritating and Useful Art."
Janice Eoss of the Dance Divi
sion introduced Sellars as "a cul
tural provocateur in the most ex
alted sense of that term."
A Harvard graduate, Sellars at
tracted national attention in 1983
when he was appointed director of
the National Theater at the
Kennedy Center at age 26. His
opera, "The Death of Klinghof
fer," opened Saturday in San
Francisco.
Wearing his trademark funky
shirt, Sellars laughed and cried as
he addressed such cultural phe
nomena as the recent riots in his
hometown of Los Angeles and the
difficulties involved in funding the
arts.
"The crisis of the world today is
a crisis of communication," he
said. "In the age of information,
there is not much communication.
The question in this generation is
how to come up with a cultural vo
cabulary that gives people the
words to describe the atrocity of
their period and the strange bat
tered hope that we all feel.
"Right now, America needs a
best friend, and that's what artists
are," he said.
Sellars criticized the nation's
ambivalent attitude towards the

arts, as evidenced by the poor
quality of art instruction in
schools and the scarcity of federal
funding for artists.
"America got it exactly wrong
that culture was the add-on, the
elective, the thing that you did
after math class," he said. "Any
thing valuable in your life is ex
tracurricular. To spend your life
doing only the things you get cred
it for is to miss the point.
"The arts have an extremely
large assignment right now, and
they're basically not up to it,"he
said, proposing that "we abandon
40 years of bad art training which
is all about the artist's personal
self in favor of socially conscious,
community-based art.
"Can we please now have a gen
eration of artists who are in the
room, not outside the room blam
ing all the people who are in the
room?" he asked. "Artists who are
not simply commenting on the
problems but who are part of the
hopelessly inadequate solution?"
To accomplish this, Sellars
called for "a meeting of the arts
and business â€” two things that
have grown increasingly disaffect
ed from social reality in the last 30
years."
However, he defended Stan
ford's recent cuts to the produc
tion budget of the Drama Depart
ment, "because obviously some of
the most important theater ever
done in history was done exactly
with no budget, because people
had no choice.
"The one nice thing about art is
that it will never die, whether it's
funded or unfunded, because the
definition of an artist is someone
who does what they want to do
whether anyone wants them to do
it or not."
