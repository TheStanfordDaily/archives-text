of special benefits
just for students.
For example,
when you take off
during Winter and
Spring Break,
Chase Student
Travel will take off
with you. In fact,
you'll get 5% off
the lowest prices
you find on air
fares, train tickets, car rentals and even
hotels.
Or, if you're moving off campus, we'll
even write a credit reference letter to help
you get an apartment.
Best of all, we won't ask you to fork
over an annual fee for the first year.
So look in your mailbox around
Thanksgiving for an application. Or,
pick one up on campus and apply for
your Chase card today.
And the next time ~

and dad, they
may actually be
happy to iiear
from you.
