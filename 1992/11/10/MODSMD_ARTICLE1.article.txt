### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
The University employee in
jured by a mysterious discharge of
mace in Potter last month has not
returned to work since the inci
dent.
Theresa Riseborough, the facil
ities supervisor for Governor's
Corner, still suffers from "irrita
tion" in her upper chest, she said
yesterday.
Riseborough, who was taken to
Stanford Hospital immediately
after the Oct. 21 incident, said she
has been receiving disability pay
since then.
"I'm very angry and frustrat
ed," Riseborough said. "When I
talk, I lose my breath and feel pain
in my chest."
However, Riseborough said she
does not plan to take legal action
against the University. "I haven't
even thought about it," she said.
Riseborough suffered the mace
inhalation in the Potter lounge
last month after a resident assis
tant asked her to investigate a re
port of a "strange smell" coming
from the lounge area.
At the time, Riseborough said
she "started choking as soon as I
walked in." She and a Potter resi
dent were both taken by ambu
lance to Stanford Hospital.
The Potter resident apparently
suffered no lasting consequences
from the mace.
Assistant Dean of Residential
Education Mary Haynes said the
can of mace had been accidentally
discharged by a student.
The incident caused a two
hour evacuation of more than 80
Potter residents. An anonymous
report filed one hour after the
mace odor was detected informed
Palo Alto firefighters that a canis

ter had been spilled.
Firefighters were unable to
find a source for the odor before
receiving the anonymous tip, and
they still hadn't found the can
when residents were allowed to
re-enter the dormitory.
Haynes said Stanford Police
eventually recovered the canis
ter, but Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said yesterday
he could not confirm that the can
had been recovered or whether
any students had been ques
tioned.
Riseborough said she may
return for limited duty at the
Governor's Corner office after
consulting a specialist today.
