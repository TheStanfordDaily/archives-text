LITTLE HOCK, Ark. (AP) - President-elect
Clinton yesterday detailed plans for a pre-Christmas
economic summit and began working in earnest on a
White House transition that aides said was unlikely
to yield many quick decisions.
Clinton opened the week by exercising his reach
as both a sitting governor and president-elect,
speaking by phone with three world leaders, meeting
with his state Cabinet and lieutenant governor, then
conferring with key members of his transition team.
Aides, meanwhile, set out to organize a summit of
American business and economic leaders and to form
transition "cluster groups" that will develop recom
mendations in various areas of government policy.
As he left his state office for the Governor's Man
sion, Clinton described the summit as an outgrowth

of his campaign promise to put economic recovery at
the top of his agenda.
"I want to bring in some of the brightest people in
the country, a broad range of backgrounds, talk to them
about the gravity of the situation, deal with what our
options are, get as many good ideas as I can," he said.
Clinton spoke throughout the campaign of his plans
to have an economic summit if he won.
Me billed the economic summit as an important
part of his effort to draft a short-term stimulus
package and a longer-term reform program.
"I just think that it would be a very good thing for
me and for the country to have two or three days
where we really just focus on it, give some people the
chance to have their say to me directly and talk
about what our options are," Clinton said.
