# For the first time since 1766, Russia and Britain sign friendship agreement
## 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Boris Yeltsin yes
terday appealed for help in rescheduling
Russia's debt and urged British business
to invest in a new capitalist Russia.
The Russian president and his aides
signed six agreements yesterday with
British Prime Minister John Major,
including the first Russo-British
friendship treaty since the one signed
in 1766 under Russian Empress
Catherine the Great and British
monarch George 111.
The pacts covered trade, defense, civil
aviation and cooperation on nuclear
energy.
Before leaving today, Yeltsin was to
address the joint Houses of Parliament,
an honor previously accorded only to
Western leaders, and have lunch with
Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham
Palace.
He flew into London yesterday and
met with Major for more than four
hours before addressing business execu
tives at the Stock Exchange.
"Our business relations seem to be
locked in the past. They still suffer sig
nificantly from stereotypes and notions
about Russia as a totalitarian nation,"
he told them.
He said the market reforms he intro

duced last January already had pro
duced positive results, adding, "The
worst is behind us."
He said he was planning steps to
attract Western investors to Russia,
including lower taxes on profits and
more opportunity to repatriate profits.
Yeltsin and Major, appearing at a
joint news conference at Major's 10
Downing Street office, said after meet
ing that there were no disagreements
between them.
Yeltsin apparently won Major's sup
port in focusing the United Nations'
attention on ethnic Russians who have
been denied the right to vote in the
Baltic republics of Latvia and Lithuania.
Before the talks, British officials
expressed concern over Yeltsin's decision
to halt withdrawal of Russian troops
from the Baltics. Major told reporters
Britain would help retrain Russian
troops returning from the Baltics and
seek Western credits to help them launch
new careers in Russia.
Yeltsin appealed for British help in
rescheduling the $70 billion debt left by
the Soviet government when it collapsed
last year.
"I am ready to underline here that
Russia is faithful to its obligations to

pay the foreign debt of the former Sovi
et Union," Yeltsin said. But he called
for recalculation of the debt, a subject
other Russian officials have raised with
the Club of Paris, consisting of creditor
nations.
Yeltsin also said Russia should be
obliged to make timely payment only on
credits extended after the Soviet collapse
last December.
British leaders have endorsed
Yeltsin's appeal for the Club of Paris to
reschedule payment of the foreign debt
owed by Russia and other members of
the Commonwealth of Independent
States. But so far Yeltsin has been
unable to sway Germany, which holds
most of the debt and faces its own mam
moth financial problems stemming
from reunification.
As he left Moscow, Yeltsin said he had
given up efforts to delay a scheduled Dec.
1 meeting of the Congress of People's
Deputies. Many members of the body say
they will try to use the session to derail
Yeltsin's market-oriented reforms and
force changes in the Cabinet.
Some hard-line lawmakers say they
will seek Yeltsin's resignation, although
it does not appear they have the votes to
do so.
