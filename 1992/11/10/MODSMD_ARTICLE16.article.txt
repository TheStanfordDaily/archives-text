# Navy violates U.S. court order
## Refuses to reinstate homosexual sailor to previous rank 
### 
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - The
Navy refused to give a homosexual
sailor his job back yesterday,
despite a court order against the
military's ban on gays.
"The day I had hoped for appar
ently has not arrived," Keith
Meinhold told reporters outside
the gates of Moffett Naval Air Sta
tion. "I will never back down until
the policy is changed. I will fight
this to the end."
Meinhold is a petty officer who
trained radar crewmen aboard P-3
submarine hunters. A 12-year
Navy veteran, he was given an
honorable discharge in August
after telling a television news pro
gram he is gay.
After he was discharged, Mein
hold filed a lawsuit seeking rein

statement, arguing that the Navy
violated his constitutional rights by
discharging him because he is gay.
On Friday, U.S. District Court
Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. issued a
temporary order reinstating Mein
hold to his former rank.
But when Meinhold showed up
at Moffett yesterday, all he was
given was a letter referring him to
the Office of Naval Personnel in
Washington.
The Navy said in a statement:
"Mr. Meinhold's current status
remains unchanged pending eval
uation of possible responses to the
judge's ruling."
Moffett spokesman John Shack
leton said officials at the base aren't
authorized to reinstate Meinhold.
Meinhold wore a civilian coat

and tie as he walked onto the base.
He said he hoped to walk out
dressed in the Navy uniform taken
from him when he was discharged.
"It is unfortunate that Washing
ton thinks it can still disregard the
orders of a federal judge," he said.
John McGuire, one of Mein
hold's lawyers, said he and his
client hope President-elect Clinton
will fulfill his campaign promise to
issue an executive order ending
the ban on gays in the military.
"There are thousands of gay
men and lesbians serving in the
military right now. It'll finally lift
that cloud," McGuire said.
Meinhold said he hopes his case
will encourage Clinton to issue the
directive as soon as he takes office.
"I want my job back," he said.
