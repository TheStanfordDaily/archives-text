Senators' first day ori the job
WASHINGTON (AP) — Bathed in television
lights and looking a bit awe-struck, 11 new sena
tors arrived at the Capitol yesterday to learn the
nuts and bolts of their new jobs.
Among the vital lessons: How they and their
staffs will get paid, ethics rules governing senators,
where to go for computers and telephones — and
just who those marble busts are surrounding the
historic chamber. (They're former vice presidents.)
"I'm a little overwhelmed right at this
moment," said Dianne Feinstein, a new Democrat
ic senator from California.
Driving to the Capitol past the city's monu
ments, "all of a sudden I looked at them a little dif
ferently," she said. As the car passed the Lincoln
Memorial, "I said, 'Hello, Abe,' and someone in the
car said, 'Welcome, Dianne.' "
Peace talks will continue
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Hush and
President-elect Clinton staked claims in Middle
East peace talks yesterday, seeking to dispel Arab
and Israeli uncertainty over U.S. commitment to
the negotiations during the presidential transition.
"The president is still the president. People here
are still the ones in charge until January," said
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher as
Arab and Israeli negotiators resumed negotiations
after a week's break for the elections.
State Department officials met yesterday morn

ing with Israeli and Arab delegates, he said, and
expect to do so throughout this round of negotia
tions, which ends next week.
Clinton told Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin by phone that he hoped the Mideast peace
talks would continue "without any slowdown"
during the transition, said spokesman George
Stephanopoulos.
Pleas for Brazilian hostages
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) — Brazil's jus
tice minister flew to an Indian reserve yesterday to
try to negotiate the release of 81 hostages held by
2,000 Indians demanding the removal of settlers
from their land.
Mauricio Correa flew to the northern Amazon
state of Maranhao, where the hostages are being held
on a jungle highway, 1,425 miles northwest of Rio.
The Guajajara tribe demanded the meeting
after rejecting promises made Sunday by Nation
al Indian Foundation officials to evacuate some
6,000 settlers from the Indians' 350,000-acre
Canabrava reservation.
Nearly 150 hostages were seized exactly one
week ago. The tribe later released 39 children and
10 women.
On Sunday, 30 chiefs agreed to release three
people in critical condition from heat stroke and
dehydration. But they said they would not free any
more until the government started removing resi
dents of Sao Pedro dos Cacetes, settled 50 years ago
in the heart of the reserve.
