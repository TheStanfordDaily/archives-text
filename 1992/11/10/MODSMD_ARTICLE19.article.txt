New publication should
provide a balanced view
of feminism on campus

FOR THE PAST FEW years,
feminism may as well have
been a four-letter word on
this campus.
Despite the brief scuffle after
Neurology Prof. Frances Conley's
resignation — due to what she
called "prevalent" sexual harass
ment at the Medical School — and
the institution of a full-time sexual
assault prevention coordinator, the
campus' women's movement has
been sluggish at best.
The most visible vehicle of fem
inist thought during the past few
years was Aurora, a quarterly
newspaper. Aurora and its succes
sor, Critical Bitch, aimed to shock
— and by running features like a
"centerfold" showcasing a 15 x 20-
inch hand-drawn vagina — they
certainly succeeded.
They also succeeded in alienat
ing themselves from most of the
campus, including many women
and men who consider themselves
feminists.
But a new publication — the G-
Spot — slated for release this
quarter, should provide a much
needed alternative for those who
were uncomfortable with Critical
Bitch's or Aurora's approach to
feminism.
G-Spot, short for the "Gender
Spot," has made it a priority to
embrace the viewpoints of women
and men.
And while the G-Spot doesn't
promise multiple orgasms, they do
pledge to provide a more inclusive
view of feminism than has been
offered in the past, countering
"the negativity and misrepresenta
tion of women [in the former mag
azines]," according to Simone
Spearman, one of the two G-Spot
editors. The solution, however,
does not lie in diluting their mes
sage.
In aspiring toward inclusion,

the editors of G-spot should not
feel compelled to water down any
confrontational messages. Indeed,
with the prevalence of sexual
assault, harassment and eating
disorders on this campus, anger
can only be expected.
But there's a difference between
venting anger and channeling it.
Preaching to the choir may let peo
ple get things off their chest, but it
won't change anyone's mind. The
challenge for G-Spot will be to pro
vide words and images that
engage, rather than enrage.
If they can spark real dialogue
in their pages, the discussion is
likely to spill over into the commu
nity. And that is precisely what a
feminist publication should aim to
accomplish.
Although the name "G-Spot"
may be clever and non-confronta
tional, it may not prove to be the
wisest -selection in light of their
overall goal of inclusiveness.
The editors of Critical Bitch
deliberately set themselves up for
criticism. "Don't just be a bitch,"
their masthead read. "Be a critical
bitch." But this "reclaiming" of
the vulgarity came across as defen
sive, rather than defiant, and set
the tone for its readers' impression
of the paper — readers, that is,
who bothered to look past the
masthead.
Unfortunately, G-Spot's editors
may find themselves in the same
situation, as their chosen title, by
so singularly focusing on women's
sexuality, will certainly startle, if
not offend gome, readers.
Despite the choice of name, if
the new editor's outlook is reflect
ed in the paper's contents, it will
likely find a far broader base of
support than either Aurora or
Critical Bitch was able to muster.
While Critical Bitch aimed to
offend, the editors of the G-Spot
aim to please. As long as reality is
not sacrificed for popularity, the
publication's arrival may signal a
new era for feminism at Stanford:
one that opts for discussion over
diatribe, and seeks inclusiveness,
not isolation.
