Sanctity of bonds between same-sex couples just as valid

1 WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND A
"THANK you" to the over 200 fac
ulty members who supported the
domestic partners spousal benefits bill.
Despite the bill's subsequent
endorsement by the Faculty Senate, it
is evident to me from diatribes, such as
Prof. Robert Greer Cohn's (Nov. 2),
that there are still some who remain
unconvinced about the sanctity of
bonds between same-sex spouses.
In areas such as retirement annuity,
tax savings, sickness leave and medical
insurance, this bill provides, in the
form of benefits, equal compensation
for commensurate work for staff and
faculty in domestic partnerships.
Members of a University Subcom
mittee, more qualified than I, have

affirmed the financial, legal and
administrative feasibilities of this pro
posal.
Yet, despite these rational argu
ments in our favor, there are still those
who believe that the university will be
extending preferential treatment to
gay employees.
This criticism is not lodged in logical
analysis as much as it is an expression
of a fundamental disbelief that two
men or two women can indeed be just
as intimately intertwined as a married
heterosexual couple.
Perhaps, Professor Cohn and his ilk
have not had the fortune to meet my
friend who recently graduated from the
School of Education.
After two frustrating years of emo-

tional uncertainty and financial invest
ment in artificial insemination, my
friend and her lover welcomed into the
world a cherished child in April,
planned for by the two women who are
her proud parents.
There is also my friend who is a
domestic partner of a graduate student
in the sciences. He uprooted his own
professional and personal life in New
England so that he can be here, as his
lover earns a degree.
My friend in the engineering depart
ment who risked his Fulbright scholar
ship and placed his education on hold, in
order to care for a lover sick with AIDS.
I grew up believing that love
requires sacrifice, fidelity and faith. A
caring partnership is defined much

more by these substantive relations
than by structure.
If the experiences I have described
are not instances of love and family
values, I do not know what possibly
could be. I cannot agree with those,
like Professor Cohn, who profess to
"save our children" from something as
genuinely human as love.
As gay people, we are responsible for
our own as well as each others' lives.
In quality and commitment, our bonds
are as sacred to us as they are to our
heterosexual brothers and sisters.
Therefore, when we ask for spousal
benefits, we demand not preferential
but equal treatment.
