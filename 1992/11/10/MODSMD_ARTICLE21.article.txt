# Science bug offends Greeks
## 
### 
We feel the need to respond to the
Science Bug's recent article entitled,
"What Not To Say To Your Target," in
the Oct. 28 Daily.
Above all, we agree that no woman
should be coerced into any sexual activi
ty with which a woman does not feel
comfortable.
However, while he justifies this posi
tion by scientifically proving that the
pain associated with unreleased semen
is only mild, we maintain that justifica
tion for saying "no" should be based
entirely on moral grounds.
Despite this disagreement in reason
ing, we respect his intentions in
addressing this issue.
Unfortunately, we must question
whether these were his true intentions
in writing the column. Throughout his
response, he makes quite blatant and
unsubstantiated comments toward
Stanford's Greek organizations.
By these comments, we can only
assume that he is unhappy with the

current state of Stanford's Greek com
munity.
As fraternity members, we will be
the first to agree that the system is not
perfect. However, his cynical approach
and stereotypical comments merely per
petuate the problem.
His references to "two way mirrors,"
"video cameras" and "notched pledge
pins," are not only unwarranted, but
hinder fraternities' attempts to better
themselves and the Stanford communi
ty -
The stereotypes that he subscribes to
are frighteningly similar to those that
promote racism, sexism and other social
injustices in this society.
while stereotypes are static, fraterni
ties are dynamic; their memberships
incur a complete turnover every three
years.
Therefore, if he truly wishes to do
more than simply create resentment
and misunderstanding, we suggest that
he address the issue directly with an
open mind, not blind comments.
Communication is the only means of

correcting the misunderstandings
between Greek organizations and the
rest of the Stanford community.
What finally persuaded us to write,
was the fact that his column is not the
first example of such irresponsible jour
nalism. The slant of his response
against fraternities detracted from the
true gravity of the problems involving
sexual assault at Stanford.
By framing his discussion in an
entirely Greek context (i.e. the letter
from the "anonymous sorority girl"), he
implies that this problem is limited to
the fraternity system.
While fraternity members are by no
means exempt, sexual assault reaches
every corner of our society.
In his attempt at cheap humor, he
has taken advantage of his position as a
journalist to blindly condemn the entire
Greek community and make a mockery
of the sensitive issue of sexual assault.
We suggest that he stick to his role as a
responsible source of information, and
not a comedian.
