## The
						M-word's consequences 
### 
A FEW MONTHS AGO, I HAD A
scary dinner table conversation
with my boyfriend's mother, who
had gotten married after college at age 22
and was pregnant by age 23. She was
telling me how she began feeling "very
adult" then.
Perhaps it was her mention of the M
word that made me panic; I don't find
marriage appealing as an institution. But
legalities aside, the core of my fear is that
marriage is the symbol of a whole over
whelming world of commitment — and
children and house payments — which
she equated with adulthood.
What about freedom? The most impor
tant gain our foremothers have made has
been to Increase the expectations of each
new generation of women. My relative
independence may make decision-making
difficult, but to make my own decisions is
a long-fought-for wish, not a burden.
Now that I am beginning to plan the
life I want to lead after that newfound
rite of passage, college graduation, my
particular dilemma is this: how do I rec
oncile a long-standing romantic relation
ship with my desire and responsibility to
take advantage of the opportunities that
are rightfully, recently and not yet easily
mine? The logistical limitations of time
and geography make it impossible to
"have it all."
Sometimes I am amazed by my own
capacity for wild optimism. But freedom

is uncertain. Am I really qualified to do
anything well? To do anything at all?
Sometimes I feel that the security of
warm arms around me is worth the sac
rifice of all my independent-minded
goals.
And then my fierce mind's eye glares
at my timid little heart. How long, it won
ders, will it take you to learn that safety
is only a packet of NutraSweet in that
sugar bowl of self-esteem? It tastes fine,
but only until you've had the real thing.
Perhaps women feel the importance of
being able to choose to live independently
more acutely; the helpless Victorian
house\\jfe is a difficult image to banish
from our minds, no -id 'lo nH)riom W
Btit thintfrny tiileniMnaTis soleljh
a woman's, or solely limited to a choice
between a partner and a career. It could
be between graduate school and the ski
patrol. Between vanilla and New York
Superfudge Chunk.
At some point everyone makes deci
sions between things that are practical
and safe and useful and things that are
uncertain and brave and enormously
attractive.
What I want for one brief moment is to
have the courage to stand alone. To expe
rience the exhilaration of independence
and the peace of solitude. To reel with the
fear of being teeny and tiny and vulnera
ble, to feel the push of oblivion and hold
it back with a wall of self-reliance that I

build, myself, alone.
That's when I'll be ready to make a
commitment to another person, to appre
ciate the stability of support and take on
the responsibility of being the supporter.
W.B. Yeats wrote, "Too long a sacrifice
can make a stone of the heart." Commit
ment means compromise. But compro
mise made from fear of the unknown —
or of being alone — can turn content
ment to bitterness. Sacrifice of oneself
without prior introspection can turn
commitment to regret.
Compromise to relationships, to
finances, to societal values and the bio
logical clock, is the way that life carries
on. But taking the chance to experience
freedom is important to our ability to
carry out these responsibilities smoothly
and willingly.
Growing up doesn't have to mean
assuming the commitments we associate
with adulthood. It means being brave
enough to meet the expectations you
have for yourself before you meet the
expectations of the world.
