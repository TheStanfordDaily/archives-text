# Clinton: How will he address the issues?
## Trickling into the future 
### 
Bill Clinton ran against trickle
down economics, offering
instead trickle-up economics.
Clinton's success will depend on
whether his version of capitalism
produces a non-inflationary econo
my, more jobs and stronger U.S. com
petition in world markets.
American politics has long veered
between the poles of trickle-down and
trickle-up capitalism. Trickle-down
capitalism promises economic growth
through policies favoring capital:
regressive taxes, government deregu
lation and anti-union measures.
Trickle-up capitalism favors labor:
tax cuts for the working poor and mid
die-class, activist government, striker
replacement legislation and the like.
As William Jennings Bryan put it
in 1896, "There are those who
believe that, if you will only legislate
to make the well-to-do prosperous,
their prosperity will find a way up
through every class which rests
upon them."
Class, economic inequality and the
redistribution of wealth and income
— despite denials — lie at the heart
of trickle-down and trickle-up capi
talism. Whenever anyone mentions
class in America, as Gore Vidal notes
in his recent "Screening History," a
booming chorus thunders across the
land denying that such a horror could
ever exist in the United States.
"Clinton has gotten across the
point that we are a party of growth
and not redistribution," House
Majority Leader Richard Gephart told

new loiaj iormuia is triea, as is
rently planned by Clinton.
Will it work? History suggest
yes, for a time, but not for long.
Politicians, for all their skill,
have been unable to find a per
manent solution to the conflict
between equality and inequali
ty inherent in capitalism.
The metronomic quality of
American politics and eco
nomics is the outstanding les
son of American history; lasting
solutions to America's contra
dictions are conspicuously
absent from the historical record

The New York Times on election day.
Soothing reassurances aside, Clin
ton will not escape the issue of
inequality.
Trickle-down capitalism accepts
greater inequality as the necessary
price for growth; trickle-up capital
ism tilts the balance toward greater
equality, but stops short of its com
plete realization.
Which version of capitalism domi
nates America at any particular time
depends on achieving what might be
called the cornucopia solution to
class conflict: an economic pie large
enough so that those seeking the
American dream do not have to pull
down those who attain it.
When capitalism fails to work this
alchemy, as it now has under the poli
cies of Presidents Reagan and Bush, a
