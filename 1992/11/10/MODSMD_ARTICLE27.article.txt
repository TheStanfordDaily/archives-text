# What's the mandate?
## 
### 
The 1992 campaign is fast becom
ing a memory — bitter for some,
sweet for others. For those inter
ested in politics, the campaign has been
replaced by curiosity over the composi
tion of Bill Clinton's cabinet, Vice-
President A 1 Gore's role or roles in the
Clinton administfatiOh'
detailed shape of the of the Clinton pol
icy agenda during the magical, mythi
cal, first 100 days.
The most popular version of the
agenda question involves the policy
implications of the election; in other
words, what is President-elect Clin
ton's mandate?
It is difficult to deduce a policy man
date from the demographics of support
for the three major candidates. Accord
ing to the exit polls reported in The
New York Times, Clinton did best
among younger and older voters. Vot
ers under the age of 30 were twice as
likely to vote for Clinton as for Perot
and a third more likely to vote for Clin
ton than President Bush. Half the vot
ers age 60 and older voted for Clinton
— that is 12 percent higher than the
vote for Bush and four times their vote
for Perot.
Voters between 30 and 60 gave Clin
ton a very slight edge over President
Bush; one in five of them voted for
Perot. But there is no obvious policy
position that unites the two ends of the
age distribution.
Some would argue that a "gender
gap" suggests a mandate. Women were
more supportive of the Clinton candi
dacy than were men — 46 percent of
women and 41 percent of men reported
voting for Clinton. But men and
women were equally likely to support
Bush — Bush was supported by 38 per
cent of the men and 37 of the women in
the exit polls.
Support for Perot shows a gender
difference — 21 percent of the men and
17 percent of the women report voting
for Perot. But perusal of Perot's mani
festo fails to suggest policies that would
make him differentially attractive to
men and women.
If demographic differences in sup
port for the candidates fail to detail
Clinton's mandate, where's the man
date? The New York Times polls sug
gest that, inter alia, people were voting
their "pocketbooks."
Forty-one percent of those inter
viewed said their family financial situa
tion was neither improving nor getting
worse; these Americans split their
votes 41-41-18 for Clinton, Bush and
Perot.
A quarter of the electorate perceived
their family's financial situation was
improving; this group overwhelmingly
voted for Bush. The vote in this group
split 24-62-14 for Clinton, Bush and
Perot.
Just over a third of the electorate
reported its family's economic situa
tion had gotten worse; Clinton harvest
ed most of the votes in this group. The
vote split of those whose financial situ
ation had declined was 61-14-25 for
Clinton, Bush and Perot.
This is not the full story of the
impact of the economy on the election.
In the summer of 1991 the Gulf crisis
moved off center stage and was
replaced by increasing press attention
to the recession. This change in focus

of public policy took its toll on
the president.

Handling of the econo
my was not Bush's strong
suit as far as the public is
concerned. Over the first
36 months of his presi
ddnby, on average, a bfcre
majority (51.6 percent) of
the public approved of
Bush's handling of the
economy.
This lack of enthusi
asm didn't get much
attention because the
economy was not the
main ingredient in the
public's overall evalua-

handling of the economy.
Last January, at the begin
ning of the election year, only
28 percent of the public
responded positively to
Bush's economic perfor
mance. But the worst was
yet to come. The last pre
election CBS/New York
Times poll showed that
fewer than one American i
in six (16 percent)
approved of the "way
Bush is handling the
nation's economy."
This performance
judgement affected the

tion of Bush. When the economy
emerged as the public's central
concern, support for the presi
dency steadily eroded along
with growing disapproval of his

president's electoral strength. Every 10
percentage point drop in approval of
Bush's handling of the economy over
the period of the primaries and the gen
eral election campaign was accompa
nied by a 12 percent point drop in those
intending to vote for Bush. Between
January and October of this year the
president's approval rating on the
economy dropped 12 percentage
points; this source alone cost him 15
percent of the electorate.
The dissatisfaction of the public
with Bush's economic performance
and concern of many Americans with
the prospects for their own economic
future suggests that Clinton should
plan to improve the economy and
make us all better off. This is an awe
some challenge with no specific guid
ance from the public on the steps that

should be taken to accomplish
it. This is a mandate not for a
particular policy but for success
as such.
In this respect, the 1992
election and the advent of the
Clinton presidency are not
unique. Every president takes
office with a public who, in
effect, admonishes him to be
successful in solving problems.
The public wants nothing more
(nor less) than peace and pros
perity.
The president has a great
deal of latitude on the choice of
means for accomplishing these
goals but the price of failure is
likely to be an unpleasant experi
ence four years down the road.
