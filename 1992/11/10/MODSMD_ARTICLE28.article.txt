# Jump-start not an easy chore

A transition to a new administra
tion is a big business — it
employs about 400 people. The
basic tasks, especially when there's a
change in the party in control of he
White House, are to staff the govern
ment (3,000 people, with the cabinet as
the first priority), develop the policies
that were (necessarily) only outlined
during the campaign and coordinate
with the outgoing administration on
what's happening in the government.
Out of all this — the people, the poli
cies and the problems — should come a
set of priorities for early action.
But what does Clinton want to
accomplish? He will want to keep his
promises to the electorate; George Bush
didn't, and it cost him dearly. Clinton
has a wide range of promises, or at least
commitments, outstanding.
There's a menu of programs. But
he made one promise during the Oct. 19
presidential debate in East Lansing,
Mich., that influences all the others: he
promised not to raise taxes on the mid
dle class to pay for his programs.
"I'll tell you this," he said, "if the
money does not come in there to pay for
these programs, we will cut other gov
ernment spending, or we will slow down
the phase-in of the programs. I am not
going to raise taxes on the middle
class to pay for these programs."

And the middle class begins
with family income below
$200,000. What, then, to

expect? Clinton's tax pro
posals and budget cuts are
unlikely to bring in the

funds to undertake his
programs, so the going
is likely to be slow on
i proposals such as

building a network
of bullet trains or

establishing a
100,000-person

National Police
Corps.
His eco-

nomists will prob
ably discover that private enterprise
will build the proposed hi-tech nation
al computer network if the regulatory
environment is favorable.
What funds he can manage to
make available will come from further
cuts in defense.
All this poses problems for meeting
another commitment — to jump start
the economy. Infrastructure invest
ments — otherwise known as public
works — take time to get underway,
usually enough time so that their maxi
mum impact is at the peak of the next
boom. No jump-start there.

A network of community
banks to lend to entre
preneurs and consumers

in inner cities will also
take time — and take
funds from elsewhere
l in the economy via
I tax subsidies.
!The proposed man
date on business to
spend 1.5 percent of
payroll for worker
training will also be a
drag on the economy,
\ as will a requirement
| to provide health
| insurance and family
I leave.
Even higher taxes
i on foreign corpora
! tions, another proposed
t source of funds, will
damage the job base.
As Paul Tsongas,

an early competitor of Clinton's,
said, if you want employees, you've
got to be nice to employers.
The jump-start is not in public
works or the long-term effects of bet
ter education, but in tax cuts. We
can expect Clinton to have a tax bill
with business investment incentives
— some kind of investment tax cred
it and possibly a capital gains tax cut
— on Capitol Hill just as soon as the
103 rd Congress is sworn in.
But he doesn't have to do much —
just enough to be able to take credit
for a recovery that is, after all,
already underway.
The real trick will be to ensure that
the longer term proposals — the
infrastructure, the federally subsi
dized network of community banks,
the spending for a National Police
Corps, the industrial policy his advis
ers are so eager to establish, the
employer mandates, the tax increas
es and especially the far heavier gov
ernment regulation of prices and out
put in the health care and insurance
industries — don't so damage the
economy that another governor of a
small southern state is thrown out of
office after his first term.
