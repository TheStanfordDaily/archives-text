# Awareness week celebrates Filipino culture
## 
### Matthew Gregory 
Pilipino American Awareness Week
continues today with a dance perfor
mance in White Plaza, part of a series of
events dedicated to improving aware
ness of Filipino culture.
Senior Rand Quinn, a co-founder of
the Pilipino American Student Union,
which is sponsoring the activities, said
today's barrio fiesta is "one of the
biggest events we've ever done" and
will feature food booths and folk danc
ing.
Other activities will include a
reading of works by Filipino-Ameri
can authors tomorrow evening.
Among the guests will be Stanford

graduate Marianne Villanueva, au
thor of "Jinseng and other Tales from
Manilla."
Started just two years ago by sever
al Filipino-American undergraduate
students, the group now boasts 35
members. Quinn said he and others
founded the student union because
there was no organization that met
their needs.
"There was a Stanford Filipino Asso
ciation before, but it was mainly (for
eign) graduate students, and it wasn't
really for Filipino-Americans. So four
of us got together and started a group,"
he added.
On Thursday, the group will sponsor
a panel discussion "focusing on the di

versity within the Asian community
and how some of the smaller Asian-
American groups . . . are different from
the mainstream groups."
"When people say Asian-American
they think Chinese, Japanese, Kore
an, Iwhich] poses a problem for the
smaller groups," Quinn said. "The so
cioeconomic classes between the dif
ferent ethnicities, the education
background, the amount of money
they earn — everything is really dif
ferent."
He added that he hopes to invite a
number of people from "as many differ
ent Asian ethnicities as we can" to par
ticipate in the discussion.
The group is also concerned about

this issue in the context of Stanford
admissions. Currently, Filipino-
Americans are classified as Asian-
Americans and are not targeted as a
special group. "The problem is that
you have such an encompassing term
for such a broad group of people,"
Quinn said
Group members are planning other
events for this year, including a benefit
dinner in spring quarter, to raise
money to support scholarships for Fil
ipino-American students and to raise
awareness in the community and Uni
versity administration.
"Our goal is to reach $10,000 bv the
end of this year," Quinn said.
Since the 1960s many Filipino
groups have used the term
"Pilipino" rather than the more
common spelling "Filipino"

because the "F" sound does not
exist in the Tagalog language.
At Stanford, Quinn said, the
use of Pilipino "is more a term of
self-pride. You're saying Pilipino
and you're being proud of your
culture and your heritage . . .
more so than the superficial rea
son that the 'F' sound doesn't
exist in the Tagalog language."
