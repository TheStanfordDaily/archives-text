## Stolz stays ahead of pack with changed outlook 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
What a difference a year
makes.
Just last year, Gary Stolz, the
Cardinal's most impressive cross
country runner, "threatened to
quit Ithe team! a couple times
because I hated it.
"Last year people didn't have a
real great attitude," he continued.
"There was no . . . team unity.
You had a few little groups, but
there was no sense of a team
itself."
Furthermore, he said, there
was no interaction between the
men's and the women's squads.
"We were basically expressly
forbidden to have any dealings
with the women's team by Brooks
I Johnson, last year's head coach].
He told the women 'I don't want
you dating anyone on the team.'
Nothing was together."
Over the summer Johnson left
and was replaced by Vin
who imposed several major
changes.
Stolz's first impression of the
new coach was less than earth
shattering.
"I had been on the interview
ing committee, so I had met him
and interviewed him for an hour,
and I wasn't super impressed."
The first tangible difference
was that Lananna encouraged
interaction with the women's
team. In fact, the men's and
women's squads sometimes train
together and have developed
inter-team rivalries.
"Louise [Watson] and I always
have this friendly competition
about who's going to score better
at this meet, and who's going to
lead our team to score better.
She's beating me, but who cares?"
Stolz said.
Lananna also changed the
training technique. Instead of
emphasizing speed, as Johnson
did, Lananna emphasizes
strength. Thus, his workouts con

sist of less speed-oriented training
and more mileage. "Now we're a
lot stronger as a team," Stolz said.
With this strength comes a new
race strategy. Instead of running
straight for the lead, then trying
to hold on, Stolz now starts out
slowly and presses forward. He
displayed this strategy two week
ends ago at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships, where he
was 15th after the first mile and
moved up to second by the finish.
This new strategy has taken
some time to sink in, for the fans
as well as the team.
"It's taken a few meets to get
used to," Stolz said. "(At Pac
10'sl I heard a few people yelling
'What are you doing Gary?' and I
was like, 'I'm right where I want
to be, stay calm, don't move too
fast.' Because so often you hear
someone yelling at you . . . and
you panic. So the coach has been
pounding into my head, 'You've
just got to relax and be confident
that that's the way to run a race.'
And its working."
Lananna's arrival has also had
more subtle effects on the team.
"We're all good friends now,"
Stolz said. "We study together
and eat together and stuff like
that."
This new attitude has also got
ten Stolz and the team excited
about running. "We're psyched
about racing in a week and a
half," Stolz said. "We used to get
burnt out by the end [of the sea
son]. Now we stay up late at night
thinking, 'We've got districts.
Okay. Another race, another
notch up.'
"It's the first year in a long
time I'm really enjoying it. Now,
all of a sudden, it's fun again."
He's enjoying it so much that
Stolz, an academic senior who
still has one more year of eligibil
ity in cross country, may try to
find an excuse to stay another
season. He may even redshirt this
season in track to have a full fifth
year athletically. "I haven't really

talked to coach about this, but
we'll see."
When asked about his competi
tors this weekend at the District 8
meet, Stolz laughed. "I don't real
ly know much about names,
places and times. I don't know on
any given day who I'm going up
against."
A common conception of dis
tance runners is of their intense
drive — why else would they will
ingly run 10 to 12 miles daily?
Stolz is driven, but his drive
lies hidden behind his casual,
Southern California air.
When it does reveal itself, that
drive seems to originate from a
Nike commercial. "You keep
doing it. You can't just stop and
think, 'Well, why am I going to
run this workout? Why am I going
to run this race?' You just kind of
do it. You run today's workout,
you're going to run tomorrow's
workout, you've got to race this
weekend. You just go out and test
and see how far you can drive
yourself."
Stolz's next test is the NCAA
District 8 meet this weekend and,
if he performs well enough there,
Nationals a week later. Both the
District B's and Nationals are 10
kilometer races (as opposed to the
8K he is used to running). This
suits Stolz superbly: "I'm very
much distance-oriented."
But Stolz cringes at the
thought of running a marathon.
"I can think of much better
things to do than run 26
miles. ... I mean it can't be a
whole lot of fun. . . . It's like
'Why?'"
After Stolz's Cardinal cross
country career is completed, he
will continue caravanting about
on golf courses, where the home
meets are held, but in a different
capacity.
"I want to learn golf. ... I know
the Stanford Golf Course .... I can
go out there and reminisce, 'Oh, I
remember when I used to run this
course.'"

"Louise [Watson] and I always
have this friendly competition
about who's going to score better
at this meet, and who's going to
lead our team to score better.
She's beating me, but who cares?"
Stolz said.
Lananna also changed the
training technique. Instead of
emphasizing speed, as Johnson
did, Lananna emphasizes
strength. Thus, his workouts con

sist of less speed-oriented training
and more mileage. "Now we're a
lot stronger as a team," Stolz said.
With this strength comes a new
race strategy. Instead of running
straight for the lead, then trying
to hold on, Stolz now starts out
slowly and presses forward. He
displayed this strategy two week
ends ago at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships, where he
was 15th after the first mile and
moved up to second by the finish.
This new strategy has taken
some time to sink in, for the fans
as well as the team.
"It's taken a few meets to get
used to," Stolz said. "(At Pac
10'sl I heard a few people yelling
'What are you doing Gary?' and I
was like, 'I'm right where I want
to be, stay calm, don't move too
fast.' Because so often you hear
someone yelling at you . . . and
you panic. So the coach has been
pounding into my head, 'You've
just got to relax and be confident
that that's the way to run a race.'
And its working."
Lananna's arrival has also had
more subtle effects on the team.
"We're all good friends now,"
Stolz said. "We study together
and eat together and stuff like
that."
This new attitude has also got
ten Stolz and the team excited
about running. "We're psyched
about racing in a week and a
half," Stolz said. "We used to get
burnt out by the end [of the sea
son]. Now we stay up late at night
thinking, 'We've got districts.
Okay. Another race, another
notch up.'
"It's the first year in a long
time I'm really enjoying it. Now,
all of a sudden, it's fun again."
He's enjoying it so much that
Stolz, an academic senior who
still has one more year of eligibil
ity in cross country, may try to
find an excuse to stay another
season. He may even redshirt this
season in track to have a full fifth
year athletically. "I haven't really

talked to coach about this, but
we'll see."
When asked about his competi
tors this weekend at the District 8
meet, Stolz laughed. "I don't real
ly know much about names,
places and times. I don't know on
any given day who I'm going up
against."
A common conception of dis
tance runners is of their intense
drive — why else would they will
ingly run 10 to 12 miles daily?
Stolz is driven, but his drive
lies hidden behind his casual,
Southern California air.
When it does reveal itself, that
drive seems to originate from a
Nike commercial. "You keep
doing it. You can't just stop and
think, 'Well, why am I going to
run this workout? Why am I going
to run this race?' You just kind of
do it. You run today's workout,
you're going to run tomorrow's
workout, you've got to race this
weekend. You just go out and test
and see how far you can drive
yourself."
Stolz's next test is the NCAA
District 8 meet this weekend and,
if he performs well enough there,
Nationals a week later. Both the
District B's and Nationals are 10
kilometer races (as opposed to the
8K he is used to running). This
suits Stolz superbly: "I'm very
much distance-oriented."
But Stolz cringes at the
thought of running a marathon.
"I can think of much better
things to do than run 26
miles. ... I mean it can't be a
whole lot of fun. . . . It's like
'Why?'"
After Stolz's Cardinal cross
country career is completed, he
will continue caravanting about
on golf courses, where the home
meets are held, but in a different
capacity.
"I want to learn golf. ... I know
the Stanford Golf Course .... I can
go out there and reminisce, 'Oh, I
remember when I used to run this
course.'"

Gary Stolz stands proudly as the star of the Cardinal cross country program. Currently in his fourth year
at Stanford, he is contemplating a return in 1993 to use his final year of collegiate eligibility.
What a difference a year
makes.
Just last year, Gary Stolz, the
Cardinal's most impressive cross
country runner, "threatened to
quit Ithe team! a couple times
because I hated it.
"Last year people didn't have a
real great attitude," he continued.
"There was no . . . team unity.
You had a few little groups, but
there was no sense of a team
itself."
Furthermore, he said, there
was no interaction between the
men's and the women's squads.
"We were basically expressly
forbidden to have any dealings
with the women's team by Brooks
I Johnson, last year's head coach].
He told the women 'I don't want
you dating anyone on the team.'
Nothing was together."
Over the summer Johnson left
and was replaced by Vin
who imposed several major
changes.
Stolz's first impression of the
new coach was less than earth
shattering.
"I had been on the interview
ing committee, so I had met him
and interviewed him for an hour,
and I wasn't super impressed."
The first tangible difference
was that Lananna encouraged
interaction with the women's
team. In fact, the men's and
women's squads sometimes train
together and have developed
inter-team rivalries.
