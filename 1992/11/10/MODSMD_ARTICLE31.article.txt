# From Anaheim to St. Petersburg, may Freedom not ring

Nagging questions. Festering queries.
These are the things that leave me dis
combobulated:
How did college football arrive at this
dysfunctional "bowl alliance"?
I guess we all know the real reason. For
years, NCAA Division IA football has
been the ugly duckling of collegiate
athletics — the only sport that does not
produce a true national champion. The
triumverate of pollsters, bowl commit
tees and corporate sponsors still pull the
purse strings that dictate the game's
postseason format. So, instead of a
national playoff, we are left with the
archaic bowl system.
College football's pundits rehashed
the "we need a playoff" argument enough
times that the triumverate felt obliged to
forge a compromise — a bowl system that
did its best to pair the No. 1 and No. 2
teams. This "bowl alliance," in itself, is a
noble creation. And (even though it will
never include the Big 10 or Pac-10
champ, nor can it pit champions from the
Big 8, Southeastern or Southwest confer
ences against one another) it should pro

duce a bout for the national title this sea
son, matching up No. 1 Miami against
No. 2 Alabama in the Sugar Bowl.
But the steps taken to pit No. 1 versus
No. 2 have touched off a series of damag
ing responses, with far more pervasive
consequences.
The alliance not only provides for the
top two teams to meet, it coerces other
major bowls to go down the wire service
polls like a checklist and offer invitations
to the highest-ranked teams, with few
other factors considered.
Consequently, lesser bowls, which
feared being locked out of the bidding for
the marquee teams, devised ways to
weasel out of this dilemma. The worst
example of this phenomenon is the

Blockbuster Bowl, which confirmed the
appearance of Penn State before a single
game of the 1992 season had been played.
More pertinent to those on the Farm is
the deal struck between the Pac-10 and
Anaheim's Freedom Bowl, which, for all
intents and purposes, obligates the confer
ence's third place finisher (probably the
Cardinal) to meet the runner-up from the
WAC (an also-ran like BYU or Air Force).
The type of preordination that the
Blockbuster and Freedom deals foster is
lame. Take Stanford's situation. Even if
it wins its final two games and finishes an
impressive 9-3, it is likely to finish third.
Only a USC upset of Arizona this Satur
day could boost the Cardinal into second.
And, given the Wildcats' recent bril
liance, no such upset is likely.
Under normal circumstances, a team
with nine wins and Bill Walsh at the
helm is a New Year's Day lock. Under the
dictates of the bowl alliance, Stanford is
likely to get mired in obscurity.
Last year, an up-and-coming Stanford
squad rightly rejected the lowly Freedom
for the national network exposure of the
Aloha Bowl. It would be a shame if, this
season, an established Cardinal club was

denied the same choice.
Will someone finally kill the San Fran
cisco Giants?
The city of San Francisco does not
deserve a major league ball club.
You know the story. The team was
legitimately sold to a group in St. Peters
burg months ago. The city's bumbled
efforts to save its team have been pathet
ic, and have finally materialized only
because baseball's owners stood in the
way of the team's move to Florida.
Anyone in The City over the summer
knows that the few "Save the Giants"
rallies smacked of Saddam's anti-Bush
parades through Baghdad. Mayor Frank
Jordan would have mustered more sup
port had he linked his resignation to
blocking the team's departure.
Simply put, not many San Franciscans
were distraught when the Giants
announced their plans to jump ship. The
city had already voted down two propos
als to build a new stadium (entirely
understandable given current economic
belt-tightening), and it seemed most were

fed up with team owner Bob Lurie when
the deal was announced.
Admittedly, the majority of the team's
support comes from outside The City's
limits, from all around Northern Califor
nia. And it's probably true that no city in
this region would approve hundreds of
millions of taxpayer dollars to build an
athletic facility.
But even after the sale of the Giants
was initially formalized, support for the
team was nowhere to be found. No more
than 14,000 fans showed up at Candle
stick Park for the team's first post-sale
home game. The 'Stick has hosted tractor
pulls that drew more in attendance.
San Francisco still does not have a ball
park worthy of playing home to a major
league team; one is already waiting in St.
Petersburg. The Bay Area had its oppor
tunity to prove wide-spread support still
existed. Its effort was seriously lacking.
Another region deserves a chance.
Baseball's owners will determine the
team's fate in the coming days, and they
should let the Giants flee.

No. 2 have touched off a series of damag
ing responses, with far more pervasive
consequences.
The alliance not only provides for the
top two teams to meet, it coerces other
major bowls to go down the wire service
polls like a checklist and offer invitations
to the highest-ranked teams, with few
other factors considered.
Consequently, lesser bowls, which
feared being locked out of the bidding for
the marquee teams, devised ways to
weasel out of this dilemma. The worst
example of this phenomenon is the

Blockbuster Bowl, which confirmed the
appearance of Penn State before a single
game of the 1992 season had been played.
More pertinent to those on the Farm is
the deal struck between the Pac-10 and
Anaheim's Freedom Bowl, which, for all
intents and purposes, obligates the confer
ence's third place finisher (probably the
Cardinal) to meet the runner-up from the
WAC (an also-ran like BYU or Air Force).
The type of preordination that the
Blockbuster and Freedom deals foster is
lame. Take Stanford's situation. Even if
it wins its final two games and finishes an
impressive 9-3, it is likely to finish third.
Only a USC upset of Arizona this Satur
day could boost the Cardinal into second.
And, given the Wildcats' recent bril
liance, no such upset is likely.
Under normal circumstances, a team
with nine wins and Bill Walsh at the
helm is a New Year's Day lock. Under the
dictates of the bowl alliance, Stanford is
likely to get mired in obscurity.
Last year, an up-and-coming Stanford
squad rightly rejected the lowly Freedom
for the national network exposure of the
Aloha Bowl. It would be a shame if, this
season, an established Cardinal club was

denied the same choice.
Will someone finally kill the San Fran
cisco Giants?
The city of San Francisco does not
deserve a major league ball club.
You know the story. The team was
legitimately sold to a group in St. Peters
burg months ago. The city's bumbled
efforts to save its team have been pathet
ic, and have finally materialized only
because baseball's owners stood in the
way of the team's move to Florida.
Anyone in The City over the summer
knows that the few "Save the Giants"
rallies smacked of Saddam's anti-Bush
parades through Baghdad. Mayor Frank
Jordan would have mustered more sup
port had he linked his resignation to
blocking the team's departure.
Simply put, not many San Franciscans
were distraught when the Giants
announced their plans to jump ship. The
city had already voted down two propos
als to build a new stadium (entirely
understandable given current economic
belt-tightening), and it seemed most were

fed up with team owner Bob Lurie when
the deal was announced.
Admittedly, the majority of the team's
support comes from outside The City's
limits, from all around Northern Califor
nia. And it's probably true that no city in
this region would approve hundreds of
millions of taxpayer dollars to build an
athletic facility.
But even after the sale of the Giants
was initially formalized, support for the
team was nowhere to be found. No more
than 14,000 fans showed up at Candle
stick Park for the team's first post-sale
home game. The 'Stick has hosted tractor
pulls that drew more in attendance.
San Francisco still does not have a ball
park worthy of playing home to a major
league team; one is already waiting in St.
Petersburg. The Bay Area had its oppor
tunity to prove wide-spread support still
existed. Its effort was seriously lacking.
Another region deserves a chance.
Baseball's owners will determine the
team's fate in the coming days, and they
should let the Giants flee.

Nagging questions. Festering queries.
These are the things that leave me dis
combobulated:
How did college football arrive at this
dysfunctional "bowl alliance"?
I guess we all know the real reason. For
years, NCAA Division IA football has
been the ugly duckling of collegiate
athletics — the only sport that does not
produce a true national champion. The
triumverate of pollsters, bowl commit
tees and corporate sponsors still pull the
purse strings that dictate the game's
postseason format. So, instead of a
national playoff, we are left with the
archaic bowl system.
College football's pundits rehashed
the "we need a playoff" argument enough
times that the triumverate felt obliged to
forge a compromise — a bowl system that
did its best to pair the No. 1 and No. 2
teams. This "bowl alliance," in itself, is a
noble creation. And (even though it will
never include the Big 10 or Pac-10
champ, nor can it pit champions from the
Big 8, Southeastern or Southwest confer
ences against one another) it should pro

duce a bout for the national title this sea
son, matching up No. 1 Miami against
No. 2 Alabama in the Sugar Bowl.
But the steps taken to pit No. 1 versus
No. 2 have touched off a series of damag
ing responses, with far more pervasive
consequences.
