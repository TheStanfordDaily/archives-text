# Soccer NCAA sites set

Luck has finally come the way
of the Stanford women's soccer
team. After receiving a dubious
No. 2 seed in the West Region of
the NCAA tournament, the Car
dinal will host top-seeded Santa
Clara at 1 p.m. Sunday with a trip
to the Final Four hanging in the
balance.
Normally, the No. 1 seed hosts
the regional final, but the NCAA
committee gave Stanford the nod
yesterday after inspecting Santa
Clara's home field at Buck Shaw
Stadium.
The Broncos play football, soc
cer and baseball at Buck Shaw
and, after a recent men's soccer
game chewed up the turf, the
committee deemed the Cardinal's
Maloney Field to be in better
shape.
However, playing at Stanford
may not give the Cardinal much
of a home field advantage. Santa
Clara is only about 30 miles down
the coast and usually brings a
large contingent to Cardinal-
Bronco tilts. In last year's playoff
game at Maloney, Santa Clara
may have drawn more fans than
did Stanford, and the Bronco
rooters were definitely more vocal
than the Cardinal fans.
But this season, Stanford has

not needed a boisterous crowd to
pull them through a tough playoff
game.
Portland brought a large, pur
ple-painted contingent from the
Spotted Owl State and, although
even the tamest Pilot cheer
seemed to drown out the smatter
ing of polite applause that drifted
from the Cardinal section, Stan
ford butchered Portland, 5-2.
In the last three Stanford-
Santa Clara games, a total of two
goals has decided the matches. If
Sunday's contest holds form, the
crowd may well be a deciding fac
tor.
Men in San Diego
The Cardinal men's soccer
team, despite falling to Washing
ton in the finals of the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tourna
ment, was invited to their version
of the "big dance" yesterday, as it
received an at-large bid to the 28-
team NCAA tournament.
Stanford, the No. 5 seed in the
West Region, will take on the
fourth-seeded San Diego Terreros
Saturday in San Diego.
The Terreros advanced to the
tournament by virtue of an upset
of Portland, the nation's No. 1
team, in the Western Athletic
Conference tourney last week
end.
