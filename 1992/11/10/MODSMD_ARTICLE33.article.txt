As the fall collegiate season draws nearer
to its conclusion, competition hits a higher
level, bringing out the best in those who
emerge victorious while leaving behind
those who fall short of expectations.
The Daily's Athletes of the Week — J.J.
Lasley and Carmel Murphy — rose to
momentous occasions last weekend for the
Cardinal football and women's soccer teams,

keeping Stanford's postseason hopes alive in
one instance and bringing yet another nation
al championship one step closer in the other.
Lasley, a fifth-year senior running back,
could not have picked a better time than last
Saturday to have the finest outing of his Stan
ford career. With the Cardinal staggering into
the contest, Lasley lifted his squad out of its
malaise by snagging a 38-yard touchdown
pass from quarterback Steve Stenstrom and a
10-0 lead for the Cardinal late in the first
quarter. The score proved to be the game-win
ner, as Stanford's defense anchored a 23-9 vic
tory over llth-ranked USC.
A Van Nuys, Calif, native, Lasley was the
overall offensive star for Stanford as he tal
lied a career-high nine receptions for 125
yards. He added six rushes for 23 yards to
the effort, as well as turning in solid blocking
performances in front of Glyn Milburn and
Ellery Roberts.
With the impressive victory, the Cardinal
assured itself a winning record in 1992 and
nearly guaranteed its second consecutive
postseason bowl bid.

Murphy, a freshman midfielder from Leu
cadia, Calif., put the final nail in the coffin of
Portland's NCAA title aspirations Sunday as
she scored Stanford's fourth goal, the insur
ance for a 5-2 first-round playoff win.
After taking a Sarah Rafanelli pass. Mur
phy dribbled into Pilot territory and fired a
low ball between two stunned defenders and

into the net.
The play of the Murphy-Rafanelli tandem
prompted Pilot coach Clive Charles to say,
"They dominated midfield from start to fin
ish. We had no answer for them."
Murphy and the rest of the Cardinal squad
will next host the top-seeded Santa Clara
Broncos Sunday at 1 p.m. at Maloney Field
for the right to advance to the Final Four.
