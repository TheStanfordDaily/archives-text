# Excerpts from Lisa Huerta's stint on "Studs"
## 
### 
What the contestants initially
say and the audience eventually
hears are two very different
things on "Studs." After the pro
ducer talks to each of the contes
tants and finds out how their
dates went, he takes their words
and twists them until they're
racy enough to hold a late-night
television audience's attention.
Huerta shared her thoughts and
her words — and the discrepancy
between them — with us here:
What they had her say:
"Ooh baby, that rippling romeo
can fluff my pom-poms any
time."
What she really said: 1
thought he was really gorgeous.
He looked like a true California

babe, a guy after my own heart.
He had this chiseled face, and his
upper body was really solid. When
I touched his arms and back, I
could feel the rippling muscles.
She said: u Geez, it would
take a tornado to ruffle that hel
met hair."
She meant: When 1 first saw
him, he was on the field with his
players and he looked great.
Kind of wild Qnd kind of Joe
Jock.... But close up, he didn't
look as good. He looked even
worse after his shower — he went
from being a wild jock to a nice
Jewish boy. His hair was too neat
and blow-dried ... too groomed.
She said: "That soft squishy

sucker got my lips a-smackin'."
She meant: We went out for
seafood and he asked me if 1
wanted to try fried calamari. We
were dipping it in these sauces
... and he forced me to try the lit
tle legs. They had cdl these little
tentacles on them ... but I ate it
and it was really good.
She said: "His pelvis was
twitchin' like he had a caterpillar
in his Calvins."
She meant: After dinner, we
went dancing at this club. We
were watching other people
dance, and then we both got up.
He's okay . . . nothing special
and nothing sexy. I mean, he's
got rhythm, but he does the same
exact moves to every single song.
