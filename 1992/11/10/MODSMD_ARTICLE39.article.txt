# Arms sales won't endanger talks
## Ukraine selling weapons to aid economy, scholar says 
### Aaron Thode Editorial staff 
The Ukraine's recent threat to sell nuclear
weapons is unlikely to destroy arms control agree
ments between the United States and the former
Soviet Union, a Stanford arms expert said this
week.
On Friday, Ukrainian First Vice Prime Minis
ter Igor Yukhnovsky said the 176 nuclear missiles
stored in silos on the young republic's soil will not
be given to the Russians for free.
"We can sell these nuclear warheads to the
highest bidder ... to nuclear states, that means
Russia first of all, or maybe another state,
depending on which pays most," he said.
If Ukraine keeps the warheads, it might tear
apart the delicately sewn START agreement
between the United States and Russia, in which
Russia promised to move most of the former Sovi
et Union's missiles into its territory by the end of
1994.
But former arms control negotiator and visit
ing scholar George Bunn, who visited the Ukraine
last month, said he does not think it is likely to go
that far.
Although Ukrainians "are serious about get
ting money," they are unlikely to keep their
weapons or sell them to anyone besides Russia or
the United States, said Bunn.
Bunn, a member-in-residence at the Center for
International Security and Arms Control at Stan
ford, was involved in negotiating the 1963 Limit
ed Test Ban Treaty and the 1968 Non-Prolifera
tion Treaty. Last month he published his latest
book, "Arms Control by Committee".
In his book, Bunn wrote, "Whether Gor
bachev's or Yeltsin's statements cutting Soviet
weaponry and deployment will be fully imple

mented by those with physical control over the
weapons remains to be seen."
Based on his visit to the Ukraine, Bunn said he
believes that "the real problem over there is in the
Parliament," not the government. A faction of the
legislative body wants Ukraine to keep the
weapons.
"I don't have much of a judgement" about the
strength of this faction, Bunn said, but he noted
that the chairman of the defense committee, used
to be the general in charge of all SS-18 rocket
forces in the former Soviet Union.
The Parliament is presently debating whether
to approve the START agreement and Lisbon
Protocol, in which the parties "promise" to sign
the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was
signed in 1991 by the United States and Russia.
Of the two other republics that posses nuclear
weapons, only Kazakhstan has approved both
documents, Bunn said.
The Ukraine "has done hardly any restructur
ing of [its] economy," Bunn said, and "any oppor
tunity to get additional financial assistance" will
get the agreements through the Parliament easi
er.
"I think the government is trying to get more
money so the Parliament will go along" with the
agreements, he added. They know that "someone
will pay them to dismantle the weapons."
The Ukraine is also reluctant to surrender any
warheads to Russia without international super
vision of what Russia does with them.
Both the United States and Russia have agreed
only to supervise the destruction of each other's
missiles, Bunn explained.
The probable outcome of the showdown, Bunn
suggested, is that the Ukraine will be given more
assistance by either the United States or Russia.
