# Out of the closet, into the workplace
## Gay, lesbian and bisexual faculty and staff group aims for visibility

When Karl Knapper inter
viewed for jobs, he used to take out
his earrings in an effort to look
"straighter and more heterosexu
al."
"Most of the pressure we feel in
the workplace is in self-censor
ship," said Knapper, co-chairman
of Out at Stanford, an organiza
tion for gay, lesbian and bisexual
faculty and staff members which
works to support people "coming
out" in the workplace.
"Whenever I respond in the
neutered pronoun and say, 'I went
out with a friend' rather than 'my
lover* I'm being subject to the sub
tle ways in which our lives are in
validated," said Knapper, who is
the program administrator of the
Martin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project.
"We are forced to make our
selves invisible," said Knapper.
While gay sexuality is often sti
fled in the workplace, heterosexu
al ity is unconsciously accepted.
"Many gay people have been ac
cused of flaunting their homosex
uality," Knapper said. "People
don't realize that straight people
flaunt their heterosexuality all the
time by showing pictures of loved
ones and telling about their girl
friends."
Out at Stanford is working to
increase awareness of the large
but relatively silent group of gay,
lesbian and bisexual faculty and
staff.
"It is important to recognize
that the gay, lesbian, and bisexual
community is not limited to stu
dents but that there are a lot of us
in the administration, staff, facul
ty and throughout the hierarchy
at Stanford," said Troy Gilbert,

advisor to the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center and
program coordinator for the Of
fice of Student Activities.
One way in which the group at
tempts to combat anti-gay and les
bian sentiment is to increase their
visibility.
Last month, Out at Stanford
sponsored the Second Annual Les
bian and Gay Workplace Issues
Conference and staffed a booth in
White Plaza for Staff Appreciation
Day.
According to Knapper, "A lot of
people have misconceptions in
thinking that they don't know
someone who is gay or lesbian.
Our job is to make ourselves visi
ble. To prove that people can be
out and active, involved in com
munity service, political issues
and in all aspects of the Stanford
community."
Although the Out at Stanford
tries to promote visibility, the
group takes a "laissez-faire" atti
tude in regard to the public knowl
edge of one's sexuality and re
spects individual choice, said Har
vey Chock, associate director of
Environmental Health and Safe
ty, who is active in promoting and
fostering a sense of ease among
faculty and staff members, some
of whom are uncomfortable with
the idea of coming out.
Out at Stanford is also working
to increase interaction with other
staff groups.
"In the past, we've tended to
lose sight of each other worrying
about our own interests." said
Knapper. "If we work together we
can be a lot stronger."
Most recently, Out at Stanford
has focused on lobbying for the do-
