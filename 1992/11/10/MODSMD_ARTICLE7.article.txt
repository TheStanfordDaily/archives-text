# Few same-sex partners apply for privileges
## 
### June Mølgaard Staff writer 
The number of students who have taken advan
tage of Stanford's student domestic-partners policy
has increased markedly in the last year, but only a
few are same-sex couples.
This year, 99 couples, up from 60 last year, de
clared themselves domestic partners and live in on
campus housing for couples. Six are same-sex rela
tionships, an increase from four last year.
The policy, passed after much controversy,
grants non-married students who claim to be in
long-term relationships the same privileges extend
ed to married couples — including housing, subsi
dized medical care, and access to library, athletic
and recreation facilities.
It applies to both undergraduate and graduate
students, and only one of the partners has to be reg
istered at Stanford.
Bill Georges, acting director of the Stanford
Housing Center, said he was not surprised by the
low number of same-sex couples. He added that he
expects the number of domestic partners to peak
soon, as there is only a limited amount of space for
all couples.
"I don't really anticipate a large increase in the
number of same-sex partners living on campus," he
said. Georges speculated that most
long-term same-sex couples choose
to live off campus for privacy pur
poses.
Graduate student Eleanor Fein
gold said that many same-sex cou
ples were probably already living
off-campus at the time the domes
tic-partners policy was implement
ed and that many new students
probably aren't aware of it.
"The policy is so unusual, that
unless there is a special effort to tell
students about it, they are going to
assume it doesn't exist," she said.
But Georges disagreed, saying
students have been adequately
informed about the program. "The
policy received a lot of attention,"
he said. "The policy is in all the
University publications that go
out to new students."
Feingold said she doesn't
believe that same-sex couples have
been intimidated into staying
away from on-campus housing,
although the introduction of the
policy in 1990 met strong opposi

tion on moral grounds from some
martied couples with children,
religious groups, alumni and inter
national students.
"We came over that very quick
ly," she said.
Feingold said the most impor
tant thing about the domestic
partners policy was not so much
housing as the many other bene
fits, such as health care.
In addition to gaining benefits,
the gay community wanted to gain
more recognition from the Univer
sity and to attract attention to
issues of sexuality, said Troy
Gilbert, advisor to the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center.
"It was of dramatic importance
to the community that the Univer
sity make a statement of support,"
Gilbert said. "The policy makes an
interesting statement about the
institution of marriage and sug
gests it might not be the end-all
and be-all of the ideal heterosexual
relationship."
A move to extend domestic
partners benefits to faculty and
staff was approved by the Faculty
Senate on Oct. 29 and awaits
approval by President Gerhard
Casper and the Board of Trustees.
