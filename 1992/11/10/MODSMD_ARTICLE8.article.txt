# End of debate
## Pro-life program to be funded 
### Jane Bahk Staff writer 
The ASSU Program Board has
lifted its hold on the funding for a
controversial abortion debate
sponsored last month by a pro-life
student group.
Reimbursement for the debate
was temporarily withheld after at
torney Beth Parker, the pro-choice

speaker, alleged that the Oct. 27 debate was a set-up
to recruit members for Stanford Students for Life.
After meeting with the Stanford Students for
Life, program board members decided to release the
funds to the group, said ASSU Program Board Di
rector Patricia Bowlin.
"It was clear that there was no intention on the
part of the Stanford Students for Life to mislead the
program board about the debate," she said.
The board wanted to ensure that the funds were
used for what they were allocated for — a "balanced
debate presenting both sides," Bowlin said.

The Stanford Students for Life
will receive the money to cover
the costs of the debate, which
were around $750, said Bowlin.
"The debate did not turn out
exactly as it was presented to the
program board, and it was under
standable why Beth Parker would
feel that she was set up," Bowlin
said.
Bowlin blamed the problems of
the debate on the pro-life speaker,
who "got a little out of hand."
The program board held the
group's funding after reading a
letter b\ Parker published in The
Daily.
In her letter, Parker called the
debate a sham because the pro
life speaker, Greg Cunningham,
began and ended the debate.
Cunningham also showed a
film which Parker charged was
misleading and "intended to dis
gust the audience." Parker said
she had not been told that he
would be showing the film when
she committed to the debate.
The debate ended with Cun
ningham making "a pitch to the
audience to attend an all-day
training session (phone number
included)," Parker said, adding
that she was "offended to be used
as a pawn" by the pro-life group.

"I think that it's unfortunate
that students' money went to pay
for a debate that was not intellec
tually honest as it should have
been," said Mary Yu, president of
the Pro-Choice Alliance.

'The debate did not
turn out exactly as it
was presented to the
program board, and it
was understandable
why Beth Parker
would feel that she
was set up.'

"However, I look forward to
having an intelligent, thoughtful,
and serious discussion with them
(Stanford Students for Life) in
the future on this issue," she said.
Sophomore Maria Alaniz, pres
ident of the Stanford Students for
Life, said that she was glad that
they received their funds.
"I'm happy that people are
now getting away from just talk
ing about the technicalities of the
debate and are talking about the
issue," she said.
