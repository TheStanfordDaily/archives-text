# End of debate
## Pro-life program to be funded 
### Jane Bahk Staff writer 
The ASSU Program Board has
lifted its hold on the funding for a
controversial abortion debate
sponsored last month by a pro-life
student group.
Reimbursement for the debate
was temporarily withheld after at
torney Beth Parker, the pro-choice

speaker, alleged that the Oct. 27 debate was a set-up
to recruit members for Stanford Students for Life.
After meeting with the Stanford Students for
Life, program board members decided to release the
funds to the group, said ASSU Program Board Di
rector Patricia Bowlin.
"It was clear that there was no intention on the
part of the Stanford Students for Life to mislead the
program board about the debate," she said.
The board wanted to ensure that the funds were
used for what they were allocated for â€” a "balanced
debate presenting both sides," Bowlin said.
