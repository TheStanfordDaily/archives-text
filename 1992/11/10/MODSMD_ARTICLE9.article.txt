Senior Lisa Huerta didn't
write her own answers. But she
wanted to.
Instead, a half hour before

like he had a caterpillar in his
Calvins."
Underneath, in smaller print,
were the words she had actually
used to describe her first date to

intellectual are two different
things.' M
She told the producers she
wanted men who were athletic

but not the blond-hair, blue
eyed, Ail-American type.
Huerta, an ex-yell leader, was
matched up against two other
cheerleaders in a cheerleader/

Although she said she wasn't

show's theme, she agreed to don
a cheerleader outfit. But she had
