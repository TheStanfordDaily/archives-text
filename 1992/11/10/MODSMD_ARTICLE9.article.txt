# Yell leader appears on 'Studs'
## Senior Lisa Huerta reveals script fixing 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
Senior Lisa Huerta didn't
write her own answers. But she
wanted to.
Instead, a half hour before
taping began, a woman handed
her a piece of paper with phrases
like, "His pelvis was twitchin'
like he had a caterpillar in his
Calvins."
Underneath, in smaller print,
were the words she had actually
used to describe her first date to
the overly inquisitive "Studs"
segment producer: "I mean, he's
got rhythm, but he does the
same exact moves to every single
song."
But Huerta bucked the Honor
Code and agreed to have her
words "paraphrased or edited by
the producer," as it says in a dis
claimer that runs nightly with
credits.
"I feel bad," Huerta said
about the changes. "I'm a nice
person. I don't like to say mean
things about people. And I think
some of these things sound
mean."
Huerta decided to try out for
"Studs" during the summer,
after three of her friends from
North ridge, Los Angeles, were
on the show.
"I wasn't looking for the hus
band or the boyfriend or any
thing. I was just looking to be
wined and dined by two guys."
After calling Fox studios,
Huerta underwent a "Studs"
personality test, which she
passed with flying colors. Typi
cally, only 10 percent of appli
cants are accepted for the show.
Being a Stanford student
didn't hurt her chances any.

were like, 'Wow. You're smart

Unaccustomed to dealing
with Stanford students, the
show's producers worried about
finding men who would be able
to match Huerta intellectually.
"They asked me if I wanted
someone who was smart and in
tellectual. And I said, 'Smart and
intellectual are two different
things.' M
She told the producers she
wanted men who were athletic

but not the blond-hair, blue
eyed, Ail-American type.
Huerta, an ex-yell leader, was
matched up against two other
cheerleaders in a cheerleader/
athlete special, scheduled to air
Nov. '24.
Although she said she wasn't
pleased when she learned the
show's theme, she agreed to don
a cheerleader outfit. But she had

to borrow her sister's high school
outfit because the producers said
Stanford's cardinal and white
wouldn't show well on camera.
"I was kind of mad, but I don't
care. I am a cheerleader — or I was
a cheerleader — so I didn't mind."
Huerta received calls from the
two "studs" in September and
arranged dates — which had to be
at least four hours long and could
not be centered around an activity
where someone else provided the
entertainment, per "Studs"
requirements.
She went to dinner and dancing
with Derrik, a 32-year-old high
school football coach whose per
sonality Huerta found as uninspir
ing as his dancing technique.
"He seemed like he was too into
me," she said. "He was like, 'Oh
my God, we have so much in com
mon. Let's get married.' And it
was like we had been to the same
restaurant or something."
Huerta's second date, Don, a
25-year-old triathlete, made a
more favorable impression after he
arrived with flowers, plans to go to
the J. Paul Getty museum and
reservations at a fish restaurant.
She said she wasn't afraid of
having to report any romantic
experiences back to "Studs" host

Marc DeCarlo — and a national
television audience.
"I would say it as vague as pos
sible."
Both Don and Derrik won the
same number of "bonus hearts"
for correctly answered questions.
And when the time came for the
men to choose their favorite date,
Don and Huerta correctly selected
each other, as did Derrik and the
UCLA cheerleader. The couples
split the $1,000 earmarked for a
date-get-away.

Huerta, however, was leaving
for Stanford two days later, and
decided to split the $500 with Don.
She said, however, that she might
go out with him again over winter
break.
The experience — her first blind
dates — provided her with useful
social skills for the working world,
said Huerta, a psychology msyor.
"It teaches you to deal with peo
ple. You're going to have to go out
in the real world and be forced to
go out with your boss or forced to

out with your co-workers. It helps
your interpersonal skills."
The experience will also allow
Huerta to be on national televi
sion, something she said she has
wanted to do for quite a while.
"I think it's going to be really
fun being on TV. It's like a game
show. I've always wanted to go on
'Wheel of Fortune.' "
But being on the show also
helped her more directly.
"It paid my Visa bill this
month," she said.

sion, something she said she has
wanted to do for quite a while.
"I think it's going to be really
fun being on TV. It's like a game
show. I've always wanted to go on
'Wheel of Fortune.' "
But being on the show also
helped her more directly.
"It paid my Visa bill this
month," she said.
Senior Lisa Huerta didn't
write her own answers. But she
wanted to.
Instead, a half hour before
taping began, a woman handed
her a piece of paper with phrases
like, "His pelvis was twitchin'
like he had a caterpillar in his
Calvins."
Underneath, in smaller print,
were the words she had actually
used to describe her first date to
the overly inquisitive "Studs"
segment producer: "I mean, he's
got rhythm, but he does the
same exact moves to every single
song."
But Huerta bucked the Honor
Code and agreed to have her
words "paraphrased or edited by
the producer," as it says in a dis
claimer that runs nightly with
credits.
"I feel bad," Huerta said
about the changes. "I'm a nice
person. I don't like to say mean
things about people. And I think
some of these things sound
mean."
Huerta decided to try out for
"Studs" during the summer,
after three of her friends from
North ridge, Los Angeles, were
on the show.
"I wasn't looking for the hus
band or the boyfriend or any
thing. I was just looking to be
wined and dined by two guys."
After calling Fox studios,
Huerta underwent a "Studs"
personality test, which she
passed with flying colors. Typi
cally, only 10 percent of appli
cants are accepted for the show.
Being a Stanford student
didn't hurt her chances any.

were like, 'Wow. You're smart

Unaccustomed to dealing
with Stanford students, the
show's producers worried about
finding men who would be able
to match Huerta intellectually.
"They asked me if I wanted
someone who was smart and in
tellectual. And I said, 'Smart and
intellectual are two different
things.' M
She told the producers she
wanted men who were athletic

but not the blond-hair, blue
eyed, Ail-American type.
Huerta, an ex-yell leader, was
matched up against two other
cheerleaders in a cheerleader/
athlete special, scheduled to air
Nov. '24.
Although she said she wasn't
pleased when she learned the
show's theme, she agreed to don
a cheerleader outfit. But she had

to borrow her sister's high school
outfit because the producers said
Stanford's cardinal and white
wouldn't show well on camera.
"I was kind of mad, but I don't
care. I am a cheerleader — or I was
a cheerleader — so I didn't mind."
Huerta received calls from the
two "studs" in September and
arranged dates — which had to be
at least four hours long and could
not be centered around an activity
where someone else provided the
entertainment, per "Studs"
requirements.
She went to dinner and dancing
with Derrik, a 32-year-old high
school football coach whose per
sonality Huerta found as uninspir
ing as his dancing technique.
"He seemed like he was too into
me," she said. "He was like, 'Oh
my God, we have so much in com
mon. Let's get married.' And it
was like we had been to the same
restaurant or something."
Huerta's second date, Don, a
25-year-old triathlete, made a
more favorable impression after he
arrived with flowers, plans to go to
the J. Paul Getty museum and
reservations at a fish restaurant.
She said she wasn't afraid of
having to report any romantic
experiences back to "Studs" host

Marc DeCarlo — and a national
television audience.
"I would say it as vague as pos
sible."
Both Don and Derrik won the
same number of "bonus hearts"
for correctly answered questions.
And when the time came for the
men to choose their favorite date,
Don and Huerta correctly selected
each other, as did Derrik and the
UCLA cheerleader. The couples
split the $1,000 earmarked for a
date-get-away.

Huerta, however, was leaving
for Stanford two days later, and
decided to split the $500 with Don.
She said, however, that she might
go out with him again over winter
break.
The experience — her first blind
dates — provided her with useful
social skills for the working world,
said Huerta, a psychology msyor.
"It teaches you to deal with peo
ple. You're going to have to go out
in the real world and be forced to
go out with your boss or forced to

out with your co-workers. It helps
your interpersonal skills."
The experience will also allow
Huerta to be on national televi
sion, something she said she has
wanted to do for quite a while.
