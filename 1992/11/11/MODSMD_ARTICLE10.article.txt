Court orders gay sailor reinstated
LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge yester
day reaffirmed his order that the Navy reinstate a
sailor discharged because he is gay, and said the
sailor likely could prove the Navy's ban of homo
sexuals is unconstitutional.
U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. ordered
the Navy to reinstate Keith Meinhold of Palo Alto
to his previous position by tomorrow morning. He
said that if the Navy refused, it would be banned
from filing future motions in the case.
"This is not a military dictatorship. It is not the
former Soviet Socialist Republic. Here, the rule of
law applies to the military. .. even to the comman
der-in-chief," Hatter said.
Meinhold's attorneys said they considered Hat
ter's action a victory even though it fell short of
their request for a finding of contempt.
"The real implication is that by 8 a.m. Thurs-

day. .. Keith Meinhold will be the first admittedly
homosexual in the armed forces," said attorney
Christopher L. Rudd.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Marcus Kerner
declined to comment.
Presidential house-hunting
HOUSTON (AP) — Once they leave the White
House, George and Barbara Bush may trade their
Houston hotel room for a house.
The soon-to-be-unemployed president, long crit
icized for having the hotel suite as his legal voting
residence, has asked a friend to do some house
hunting for him in his adopted city.
"The thing that pleases me about this... is that so
many people and the media always said, 'They're not
really Texans, and they won't go back to Texas,'"
said friend Jack Steal to the Houston Chronicle. "I
guess this shows 'em."
