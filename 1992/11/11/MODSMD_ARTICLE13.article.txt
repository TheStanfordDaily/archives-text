# Cutting apart the AIDS virus
## Newly developed "molecular knife" may destroy disease 
### 
LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP) â€” Scien
tists have developed a tiny "molec
ular knife" that cuts and destroys
part of the AIDS virus, and they
soon will test the treatment on peo
ple with the deadly disease, a
researcher said yesterday.
"It's a new technology which
could potentially be very powerful,
but it needs a lot of refinement,"
said Dr. Flossie Wong-Staal, a
researcher at UC-San Diego.
"We're working on it and are very
excited about the possibilities."
Wong-Staal, who earned a
national reputation during her
tenure at the National Cancer
Institute, outlined her research
during the 30th annual New Hori
zons in Science briefing.

AIDS cripples the body's dis
ease-fighting immune system, leav
ing patients vulnerable to death
from various infections and can
cers. The virus weakens the system
by infecting certain white blood
cells and then hijacking their genet
ic instructions so the cells mass
produce more of the deadly virus.
The process kills the original
disease-fighting white blood cell
and allows new virus particles to
spread to more cells and kill them.
The "molecular knife" is an
enzyme developed by a team headed
by Wong-Staal and Northern Illi
nois University's Dr. Arnold Ham
pel. They designed it to cut and
destroy genetic instructions used by
the AIDS virus, short-circuiting the

virus' ability to reproduce and
spread throughout the body.
The researchers applied the
enzyme knife to AIDS-infected
human white blood cells grown in
test tubes. When subjected to the
knife, the virus made only 10 to 30
percent as many copies of itself as
it normally would have done.
Tests on AIDS patients "will
start within the year" to learn if
the treatment is safe, and later to
determine if it is effective in halting
or slowing the progression of the
deadly disease, Wong-Staal said.
A single molecular knife
enzyme can cut up the genetic
instructions in many AIDS virus
particles, increasing its effective
ness.
