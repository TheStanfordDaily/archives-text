## Fair ASSU funding 
### 
Students and Program
Board need to be sure
money is not wasted

ACCOUNTABILITY. NOW
more than ever, people are
demanding the responsible
use of public funds. Disgusted
with senators' bounced checks
and post office perks, tales of
$900 Army screwdrivers and sav
ings and loan scams, people are
finally saying "enough is enough"
and demanding that taxpayer
money — their money — be spent
wisely.
Likewise, Stanford's student
body should demand responsible
use of their "public funds." To
some extent, by voting for fee
requests and establishing over
sight committees like the ASSU
Program Board, students have
taken some initiative toward this
end.
However, merely creating over
sight structures does not guaran
tee they will perform their intend
ed function.
Last week, in the first display of
oversight in recent memory, the
ASSU Program Board placed a
hold on funds sought by the pro
life student group, Stanford Stu
dents for Life. The group had
requested $750 to cover the
expenses associated with what was
billed as a balanced abortion
debate between a pro-life and a
pro-choice speaker.
But, in a letter published in The
Daily following the Oct. 27 debate,
pro-choice speaker Beth Parker
decried the purported impartial
debate, calling it a sham and said
she was "offended to be used as a
pawn" by the pro-life group. Park
er was angry because pro-life
speaker Greg Cunningham was
allowed to both open and close the
program and show a film "intend
ed to disgust the audience." Parker
said she was not told of the film
when she consented to participate
in the debate.

Apparently in response to
Parker's comments, the board
placed a hold on the funds they
had previously approved for the
debate and promised to investi
gate the matter.
After meeting with the pro-life
students, the board concluded that
the pro-life speaker had gotten "a
little out of hand," absolved the
student group of responsibility
and released the funds.
The incident raises several
questions: first, if Stanford Stu
dents for Life was not responsible
for the actions and words of its
invited guests, who was? It is rea
sonable to assume that when Stan
ford Students for Life invited the
speaker, the group had some idea
of the content of his lecture.
Had the speaker made racial
slurs or comments offensive to
gays, lesbians and bisexuals, it
seems unlikely that the board
could have just brushed off the
incident as a "speaker who got out
of hand." Groups are expected to
do their homework before hosting
campus-wide events.
Secondly, how does the Program
Board ensure that groups execute
their programs as stated in their
funding requests? Whether or not
the board acted justly in releasing
the funds, the board was acting in
the interest of all students when it
initially withheld the money. It
was attempting to ensure that a
student group was not misrepre
senting a request for student
given funds.
The board's responsibility is not
merely to "rubber stamp" any pro
posal a student group submits.
Beyond reviewing fund requests,
the board has some responsibility
to ensure that the proposals are
implemented as presented.
This is not to imply that the
Program Board should play pri
vate investigator and "go under
cover" at all events funded
through the ASSU. But certainly
there needs to be a more institu
tionalized channel of oversight
than the campus newspaper's
opinions page.
