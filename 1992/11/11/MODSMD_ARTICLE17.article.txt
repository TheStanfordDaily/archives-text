## Ah, to be a freshman again 
### 
Like many seniors, i had
become complacent with Stanford,
confident that I had experienced all
that I needed to.
I no longer marvel at the fact that I
can tan in November while it snows at
home. I barely note that another
Supreme Court Justice is speaking on
campus while I skip to The Daily sports
page to read about the women's soccer
game. I don't need to check the map in
the back of the time schedule to find my
classes, unless they're near Terman, of
course.
I've been to Big Game, touched the
Axe, stormed the field at Memorial Stadi
um. I've done TEAM, tutored
Ravenswood and went to Senior Pub
Night at the Goose — as a sophomore.
I've swallowed goldfish in a shot of
Sharps. I've argued late into the night
about abortion and politics. I've felt the
exhilaration of finishing a paper in one
night and doing well. I've hooked up,
dated, broken up and been dumped. I've
seen Les Mis four times.
I'm a senior. I've done it or seen it
done. I thought to myself, OK, Stanford
what have you done for me lately? What's
next?
And then they arrived, 92 of them —
my freshmen. It was my wake up call
from the class of '96. I had forgotten the
excitement and confusion of starting col
lege. The anxiety of roommates, dorm

mates and CIV. The red waves of ink over
my first paper, second paper. . . .
As a freshman I was sure I was the
only one who was having difficulties.
How I wish I had known the truth.
Now I see the new frosh adjusting,
each at his or her own pace, but adjusting
nonetheless. I try to help, to relate my
own experiences in the hope that they
can learn the same lessons without hit
ting the pitfalls, while always realizing
that the greatest discoveries are those
made alone. And yet, I remember how
alone a freshman can feel sometimes.
In fact, in many ways I feel like a
freshman again. Living with 92 of them
has already begun to remind me of how
I've changed in three short years. The
raw enthusiasm with which they tackle
their new environment is fascinating,
invigorating and contagious.
I can again revel in the little things
which make Stanford life so exciting cheer
ing for a dorm athlete in a contest or wear
ing a triumphant smile after that first A
I laugh at the speed with which gossip
can spread through a dorm; the first
Flick or first beer. I chuckle at the tripe
which passes for the quote of the day on
my dry erase board, a welcoming recep
tion of friends after a first date and the
exhilarating embarrassment which
accompanies it.
I've learned the difference between
zigging and zagging — and how crucial it

can be; what a rave is; the almost
inevitable evolution/destruction of high
school relationships.
I've begun to realize how much of
Stanford I haven't really experienced yet
and how much I've forgotten. I view
myself in the freshman mirrors around
me. I see an additional 10 pounds and a
bit more white eyebrow. I see a bit of
myself in some of them, and so much I
wish I had been, in many. I compare
myself now to the freshman I was. I see
significant growth and maybe a bit of
regression; lost opportunities and fleet
ing triumphs; goals realized and missed.
Don't get me wrong — I don't sit and
bemoan my lost youth for hours on end.
I'm still a kid, I just don't have the time
to play any more. They always said the
college years are the best years of our
lives. Still, at 21 I'm not quite ready to
throw in the towel.
As graduate school and the real world
loom in the all-too-near-future, I can
enjoy the chance to be a freshman again
— on four hours of sleep per night.

Don't get me wrong — I don't sit and
bemoan my lost youth for hours on end.
I'm still a kid, I just don't have the time
to play any more. They always said the
college years are the best years of our
lives. Still, at 21 I'm not quite ready to
throw in the towel.
As graduate school and the real world
loom in the all-too-near-future, I can
enjoy the chance to be a freshman again
— on four hours of sleep per night.

Torn Flemma would like to remind every
one that Donner rules! His column
appears here Wednesdays. 'Nuff said.
