Pro-lifers misrepresent facts with grotesque film

CATHY DE WILDE'S LETTER to
The Daily Friday, Nov. 6 regard
ing my unwillingness to face the
"realities" of abortion was misguided,
misinformed and counterproductive to
any sort of meaningful discussion of the
issue. I am writing to correct the mis
perceptions and misconceptions con
tained in her letter.
First of all, Maryland did not "make
abortion legal through the ninth month
of pregnancy," as De Wilde stated. What
Maryland did was codify Roe v. Wade;
that framework recognizes a woman's
right to have an abortion with the advice
of her physician any time within the
first trimester.
Roe v. Wade also established that the
state could not intervene in the second
trimester except in the interest of the
mother, but it did acknowledge the
state's legitimate interest in protecting
the life of the fetus in the third

trimester.
Secondly, the comments I made
which were offensive to her were taken
from an article in which The Daily
reporter questioned me about my rea
sons for not attending a debate spon
sored by the Stanford Students for Life.
I replied that I refused to attend
because I knew a particular film would
probably be shown, and that it was
made with the express purpose of dis
gusting the audience, and not with the
intention of providing any sort of infor
mation conducive to the thoughtful dis
cussion of abortion.
A film showing distorted, unrepresen
tative "evidence" of abortions injects a
focus altogether inappropriate into a
supposedly intellectually fair and honest
debate. By showing images of mangled,
"aborted" fetuses clearly in the third
trimester, the film irresponsibly conveys
the false impression that most abortions

are performed late in pregnancy when,
in fact, 91 percent of abortions nation
wide occur in the first trimester and 97
percent occur before 24 weeks.(Guttmach
er Institute).
The remaining 3 percent of abortions
are performed because of severe fetal
deformities or to save the life of the
mother. In the latter case, an attempt is
made to save the life of the fetus as well
(Guttmacher Institute).
Had 91 percent of the film shown first
trimester abortions, we would have seen
1 to 3 tablespoonfuls of red, cotton-like,
unrecognizable tissue per fetus (Dr. Kate
O'Hanlan of Gynecology and Obstetrics,
Stanford University Medical School).
Moreover, it is a known fact that pro
life groups doctor their photos to attain
greater emotional impact, i.e., one of the
photos in their literature is a fetus inside
a paper cup enlarged many times to look
like a full-sized baby in a garbage can.

The film in question gave no docu
mentation or explanation as to where
the "evidence" was culled from; instead
the "evidence" was set to religious lyrics,
producing the effect of a macabre music
video. It can only be concluded that the
origins of the gruesome images in the
film are at best questionable.
I wholeheartedly agree with Ms. De
Wilde that we should face the realities of
abortion, but what we should face are
indeed the realities, and not the
attempts to mislead and deceive embod
ied in films such as the one shown in
that debate. This is a very serious issue,
and we should discuss it in all serious
ness by presenting factual information
about abortion without attempting to
distort or misrepresent in order to gain
an unfair advantage.
