# Column makes transfer feel unwelcome in her new, scary environment
## 
### 
We found Joel Stein's "Greek Picks," in
the Nov. 6 Daily, to be tasteless, demean
ing and downright hurtful. Whatever his
intentions may have been, we would like
to ask why, and for what price?
The woman he "featured" in his article,
actress Jennifer Connely, was asked only if
she would submit a list of football score
predictions — nothing more. Neither Stein
nor The Daily staff ever spoke to her
regarding the slant of the article. In short,
his manner of collecting information and
consent for this article was unprofessional,
irresponsible and sophomoric.
Please try to imagine being a transfer
student from a cold, impersonal school,
anxious to meet new people and connect

with fellow students on a personal level.
Instead of being treated as a regular stu
dent, you are intensely scrutinized, sin
gled out and harassed.
Then, the managing editor of your
university's student newspaper writes a
degrading, sexist article which insults
you, those dear to you and much of what
you have worked to accomplish. How
would that make you feel?
Try completely alienated.
Stein went too far on this one. His arti
cle lacked humor, substance and purpose.
As managing editor of The Daily, he
is entrusted with responsible reporting
and upholding the integrity of the paper.
For the price of a few laughs from people
who know Stein's victim as superficially
as he does, he failed in his job and suc
ceeded in alienating a fellow student.
