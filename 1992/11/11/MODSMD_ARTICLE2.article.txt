# Pediatric cuts hurt
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Many graduate students with children
have found themselves greatly inconve
nienced in the wake of Cowell Student
Health Center's elimination of pediatric
services this summer.
"I had to scramble to find a doctor for my
son," said Escondido Village resident Car
olina Montes, who has a three-year-old son.
Carol Nyholm, assistant director for Es
condido graduate residences, said that de
spite innovative efforts by parents, trans
portation and cost difficulties have plagued
the transition to private sources of care.
"It has been a substantial hardship for
many working parents on campus," she
said.
Students investigated off-campus med

ical care this summer, interviewing doctors
at clinics throughout the area. They com
piled a list of "about six sites that offered
services that they felt best replaced those
at Cowell" and distributed it to parents at
the beginning of the year, Nyholm said.
But no follow-up investigations have
been carried out by these students since
this summer, she said.
"There are still problems with people who
don't have cars. It is difficult for them to find
the time to get to an off-campus clinic."
Dr. John Dorman, director of public re
lations at Cowell, offered some insight into
the switch by pointing out that there were
no parents on the student committee that
advises Cowell.
"With more parents, there would be a
better-informed parent popula
tion," he said. "We are trying to
make sure that there are parents
on the committee in the future."
He would not say that having
parents on the committee would
have changed the decision to dis
continue services, which was made
"because of financial considera

tions that Cowell is facing."
The program did not attract
enough children to support itself,
said Cowell Medical Director Peter
Gregory. While an average pedia
trician receives about 3,500 to
4,500 visits per year, CowelTs pedi
atric service received only about
800 to 900, according to Gregory.
Cowell is "down a doctor" since
the pediatric program was cut, Dor
man said. The doctor who had
worked half-time as the pediatrician
also worked at Cowell as a half-time

general practitioner. But when the
pediatric post was eliminated, he
left Cowell, not wanting to work
only half-time, Dorman said.
In the meantime, other mea
sures have been taken to help fill
the void left by Cowell. "Escondido
Village has a nurse who visits on
the second and fourth Wednesday
of each month from 1:30 to 3:00 to
give children immunizations,"
Nyholm said.
When Cowell decided to discon
tinue services, it referred patients

to an already-operating pediatric
practice on Welch Road. But
Montes, who had been taking her
son to Cowell since last year,
described this program as "poorly
done."
Montes decided not to use the
Welch Road services and also shift
ed her son's insurance to another
carrier. "I did it in part because I
was angry at Cowell. I tell other
people not to go to Cowell, but to
go ofT-campus for insurance and
health care."
