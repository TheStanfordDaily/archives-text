# Clinton: How will he address the issues?
## Election inspires thoughts of JFK, service to nation 
### 
Mike Zwibelman and Nancy Luxon

Perhaps it is a bit early to
evoke images of John F.
Kennedy. After all,
Kennedy is an American icon
— an inspirational leader who
challenged America to reach
new heights by the end of the
19605. Kennedy, in one sweep
ing statement, energized the
country into immersing itself
in public service both at home
and abroad.
Americans, for the first time
in decades, were called upon to
take responsibility for improving
their lives and the lives of others.
Like so many others in his gen
eration, Bill Clinton names
Kennedy as the inspirational
force behind his decision to dedi
cate his life to public service.
Like the Kennedy years, the
Clinton administration will
bring to this country a new
generation of leadership. Bill
Clinton and A 1 Gore will chal
lenge Americans to assume
responsibility for changing the
future of this country.
The 1992 election was a piv
otal one. Americans made a
resounding choice to leave the
"me decade" of the 1980s
behind and look to meet the
challenges of the next century.
President-elect Clinton has a
profound sense of America's
desperate call for change.
The first 100 days of the
Clinton administration will set
the tone for the new direction
of the country. The first priori
ty is to revive the economy and
put the American people back
to work.
While rejecting the failed
economic theory of "trickle
down" economics, Clinton also
rejects traditional tax-and
spend policies. Clinton's
detailed and coherent plan,
"Putting People First," insists
on a reciprocal responsibility
which is a far cry from tradi
tional liberalism.
In addition to the support of
enterprise zones and tenant
ownership programs, "Putting
People First" calls for an
earned income tax credit that
ensures that those who work

full time will remain above the
poverty line.
The Clinton administration
will also move quickly to estab
lish community financial insti
tutions which would provide
capital for inner-city business
es. The first 100 days will also
see a capital gains tax cut for
those who invest in new busi
ness ventures and plan to hold
their assets for at least five
years.
i

The Cold War is over
and America must
now face the chal
lenge of remaining
an economic super
power.

Clinton's plans for welfare
and higher education reform
represent his boldest departure
from tax-and-spend liberalism.
Returning to the overriding
theme of his administration —
Americans must take responsi
bility for improving their lives
and the lives of others — Clin
ton would establish welfare
reform that would reduce ben
efits for those recipients who
will not work.
After 20 to 24 months on the
welfare rolls, recipients are
expected to work in public ser
vice programs at below-market
wages until they find long-term
employment.
Similarly, Clinton will offer
every American a college edu
cation as long as those who
borrow the money pay it back
as a small percentage of their
income over time or, even bet
ter, by serving their communi
ty in public service jobs for two
aiAjHJ vmij rioitlw miiw
years.
Clinton will move decisively
to ensure a woman's unequivo
cal right to choose. By signing
the Freedom of Choice Act, and
thereby codifying Roe v. Wade
into law, the Clinton adminis

tration will demonstrate its
commitment to women's rights
in the next decade and the next
century.
The Clinton presidency will
move swiftly to declare that
basic health care coverage is a
right to all Americans and not
a privilege. Clinton's plan will
introduce managed competi
tion and aggressive cost con
tainment measures while

keeping the best aspects
of the private sector of

health care. Clinton
emphatically rejects
the Canadian and

British systems as
well as the status
quo in America
which currently has

38 million Ameri
cans with no
health insurance
and 10 million
more who are
under-insured.
The president
elect under

stands that if
America does not
maintain a sound
and growing econ

omy we can not
establish a strong
foreign policy.

Bill Clinton recog- *
nizes that the success
of foreign policy initia
tives in the next decade

and the next century will

depend on our economic
position in the global econo
my.

The Cold War is over and
America must now

face the chal
lenge of re
maining an i

economic

superpower.
Opt i -
mism. En

ergy. Chal-
Re- ,

sponsi
bility. /

These are the themes that will
fuel the Clinton Administration
and propel America into the
21st century. Even if Bill Clin
ton is no Jack Kennedy, the

spirit of the genera
tion Kennedy

inspired is now poised to chal
lenge the country once again.

Mike Zwibelman and Nancy Luxon
are co-chairs of the Stan/crd
Democrats.
