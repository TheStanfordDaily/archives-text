# More of the same from Washington

In most ways, the Clinton administra
tion will not be that different. It will be
more of the same. And therein lies the
problem: it will be more.
Each administration, Republican and
Democrat, has expanded the power of the
state at the expense of individual liberty.
More laws are passed each year; few are
repealed. Each year more of our personal
lives become either mandatory or prohib
ited. Each year more of our economic lives
are regulated or taxed.
In general, Clinton will probably be
slightly better than Bush in terms of per
sonal liberty, but slightly worse in terms
of economic liberty.
On personal issues: Clinton will allow
gays to serve in the military, and women
will retain the right to abort a pregnancy.
These are good things — but if you are not
in the military or pregnant, these policies
are not going to change your life signifi
cantly.
Recent Republican administrations
have been destructive of personal liberty
because of their belief in morally superior

As for creating jobs, there
is nothing magic about
government spending.

family values. After 12 years, the United
States now has more prisoners per capita
than any other nation on earth — more
than South Africa, more than the former
Soviet Union.
For the most part, this sad fact reflects
the "drug war" pursued so aggressively by
Reagan and Bush. Clinton will not end
our current Prohibition, but he may pur
sue it less aggressively. Why? Because
people in glass houses don't throw stones.
Clinton's own history of mild drug usage
(inhale or no) makes it politically awk
ward.
On economic issues: Bush wrecked the
economy by allowing taxes to rise and reg
ulation to increase. Moreover, domestic
spending under Bush rose 10 percent per

year, the fastest rate since Roosevelt.
Clinton offers no change here, but he
says that by increasing government spend
ing on infrastructure he will create jobs.
This is dubious. Take California as an
example — businesses are leaving our
state because of high taxes and an onerous
regulatory environment. They are not
leaving because we have poor roads and
bridges.
As for creating jobs, there is nothing
magic about government spending. Or, as
libertarian humorist Dave Barry put it,
"See, when government spends money, it
creates jobs; whereas when money is left
in the hands of taxpayers, God only knows
what they do with it. Bake it into pies,
probably. Anything to avoid creating
jobs."
Four years from now, the ironic legacy
of Bill Clinton, the candidate for "change,"
will be that he was simply more of the
same.

Steve Mims is the president of the Stan
ford Libertarians.
