# Clinton will face budget problems

rw ill Clinton has dis-
Iâ€” l Cplayed his mas-
JL-Jtery of the politi
cal game many times during the
past year, but no test of his resolve
will be so great as the task which
now falls before him. His promise of
better times ahead will certainly not
be an easy one to fulfill, especially
considering the blueprint for the
American economy with which he
will work.
Indeed, by the end of Clinton's
term in the White House, we will all
be taxed more, the government will
spend like a drunken sailor and the
deficit will balloon to a new, even
more frightening level.
Throughout his campaign, Clinton
called for "investment in America,"
cleverly using the word "invest" every
time he wanted to say "spend." But,
semantics aside, the Clinton adminis
tration will initiate new spending pro
grams that will create brand-new
bureaucratic behemoths designed to
suck away large amounts of govern
ment money.
With a democratic Congress recep
tive to any calls for new spending,
Clinton will undoubtedly be given
authority to undertake these new
spending initiatives. With his plans
for increasing the size of an already
bloated bureaucracy, government is
likely to expand greatly under Clin
ton's leadership.
Though Clinton claims that new
taxes on the rich and cuts in defense
will cover the costs of his new pro
grams, very few economists believe
that such limited tax hikes and spend
ing cuts will suffice.
Clinton will be forced to either
raise taxes on the middle class or
increase the deficit to record highs, or
both, in order to finance his plethora
of pet projects. Unless the economy
takes a remarkable turn upward, I see
a 500 billion dollar deficit by the end
of the next four years and a comple
mentary tax hike on the middle class.
Despite my pessimistic outlook on
the effects of Clinton's economic plan,
my biggest worry is not how Clinton
will finance his new spending plans,
but how he will finance the even larg
er spending plans likely to be passed
by a liberal, spendthrift Congress.
I wonder how many times this man
with a record of inability to hold fast
in his positions will bring himself to
say "no" to pork barrel legislation
passed by Congress. Will he really
veto bills passed by a "friendly"
Congress who has never seen a spend-

ing bill it didn't like? I fear that the
Democratic Congress will take advan
tage of Clinton's inherent desire to
satisfy everyone and present him with
numerous new spending bills which
he will sign, plunging us even farther
into debt and mortgaging our future
like never before.
Though I am very concerned that
Bill Clinton will tax and spend like

Clinton's tolerant social
agenda will not pay the bills
for the lavish spending we
are about to witness.

Democrats before him have, I do see a
few good things that will come out of
a Clinton presidency. Clinton will
allow gays in the military and provide
some kind of federal civil rights pro
tection for homosexuals, two reforms
long overdue.
Clinton will also resolve the issue
of abortion once and for all by singing
the Freedom of Choice Act, guaran
teeing the right to choose for all
women. But Clinton's tolerant social
agenda will not pay the bills for the
lavish spending we are about to wit
ness.
Clinton may well tax and spend his
way out of second term, however. The
voters elected Clinton to fix the econ
omy, and if he fails to do so, he will
face a difficult re-election fight. The
Republican Party will be energized by
its thirst for lost power and will
aggressively seek to reclaim the White
House. After 12 years of GOP rule,
the party grew too complacent, losing
its vigor and allowing the religious
right to become too powerful.
By 1996, the party will present
its message of fiscal responsibility
as diametrically opposed to the
Democrats' reckless spending, and
it will hopefully abandon the social
conservatism that has cost it cru
cial votes. Just as GOP control of
the White House forced unity and
the appearance of moderation in
the Democratic Party, so will four
years of Democratic rule force the
Republicans to fight to win in 1996.
This will to win, coupled with four
years of high taxes, frivolous spend
ing and record deficits, will position
the GOP well poised for victory in
1996.

John Griggs is co-president of the Col
lege Republicans.
