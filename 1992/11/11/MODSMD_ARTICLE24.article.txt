## How low can you go?

Q: As proved by the popular
movies "Honey I Shrunk
tne Kids" and its corollary,
"Honey I Blew Up the Kid," one
of the burning scientific ques
tions of our day concerns how
big and small people can get
without dying.
How big can a human being
be, given that all other condi
tions are optimal (you know,
the person eats haystacks and
assorted children for fiber and
protein, and gets plenty of exer
cise moving mountains and
wrecking economies)? And how
small can a person be?
— Radioman
A: You've really rocked my
world. After years of being
painstakingly reassured by kind
women, I have inferred from
your question that — at least to
some people — size does matter.
Sigh.
Just to get back at you, then,
I'll challenge one of your implic
it assumptions: Watching Rick
Moranis films is a bad way to
shape your expectations about
scientific fact.
The largest possible healthy
human being would be fairly
close in height to the tallest per
son you've ever seen in real life
— nowhere near the optimal size
for rearranging geography or
snacking on haystacks.
Assuming that you possessed
some infernal machine or equal
ly diabolic hormone treatment
that could arbitrarily increase a
person's height, you would
quickly encounter an insur
mountable physical barrier: At
some point, the person's body
would grow so massive that the
frame would be insufficiently
strong to support its own weight.
Let's do a little gedanken
experiment to illustrate this
point, using Gerhard Casper's
body as our imaginary subject
and making tiresome jokes
about his German ancestry. In
our thought experiment, we
expand our new president from
his current height of around 5-
foot-9 to progressively larger
and larger sizes.
Besides lifting Gerhard's
kopf to where the luft der frei
heit could blow the hair off his
ears, increasing his height
would have two main effects.
The strength of his frame and
musculature would grow, but
so would his mass.
If structural strength and
body mass increased in parallel,
there would be no obvious limit
to Gerhard's size. We could
imagine the new president as a
titan, travelling across the con

tinent in a few long strides,
scooping John Dingell out of his
cushy chair on Capitol Hill and
dispatching him as easily as an
ordinary person would consume
a link of bratwurst.
However, although struc
tural strength is proportional to
the square of height, body mass
grows as the cube. For those of
you who took Psych 60 to fill the
math distribution requirement,
this means that at 11-8 — twice
his current size — Gerhard
would be four times stronger,
but eight times heavier.
Hardly the iibermensch I fan
tasized about in the previous
paragraph, he would be unable
to support his own weight — a
predicament shared by erstwhile
Stanford gadfly Paul Biddle.
A normally proportioned
human frame would become
insufficiently strong to support
its mass at about eight feet tall,
which I therefore consider to
be the upper limit for the size
of a healthy human being.
Robert Pershing Wadlow,
the Guiness-book giant, was a
good deal taller than this — he
grew to 8 feet 11 inches before
he died at age 22 — but he had
to wear leg braces once he
topped 7 feet 6 inches, so I'm
sticking by my figure.
Extremely short people
don't have to face the same
structural problems as the very
tall. However, developmental
abnormalities that are severe
enough to keep an individual
hovering around the 20 inch
birth height through adulthood
generally pose such a serious
threat to normal body function
that the individuals suffering
from them cannot survive.
Although such extremely
small humans have been known
to live past twenty (twice) and
even past thirty (once), it hap
pens so infrequently it may not
be useful to think of birth
height as a minimum size.
A drastic increase in survival
occurs around three feet, how
ever, and many dwarfs of
roughly this height enjoy nor
mal health and longevity.
Hollywood's extremes aside,
then, human bodies nonethe
less span quite a range of sizes.
Confronted by the optimal
human giant, it would take two
or three of the littlest people sit
ting on each other's shoulders
to answer what they would
doubtless find a "burning scien
tific question":
"How's the weather up
there?"

Robert Pershing Wadlow,
the Guiness-book giant, was a
good deal taller than this — he
grew to 8 feet 11 inches before

sticking by my figure.
Extremely short people
don't have to face the same

that the individuals suffering
from them cannot survive.
Although such extremely
small humans have been known
to live past twenty (twice) and
even past thirty (once), it hap

be useful to think of birth
height as a minimum size.
A drastic increase in survival
occurs around three feet, how
ever, and many dwarfs of
roughly this height enjoy nor

Hollywood's extremes aside,
then, human bodies nonethe

Confronted by the optimal

there?"

The Science Bug
Q: As proved by the popular
movies "Honey I Shrunk
tne Kids" and its corollary,
"Honey I Blew Up the Kid," one
of the burning scientific ques
tions of our day concerns how
big and small people can get
without dying.
How big can a human being
be, given that all other condi
tions are optimal (you know,
the person eats haystacks and
assorted children for fiber and
protein, and gets plenty of exer
cise moving mountains and
wrecking economies)? And how
small can a person be?

A: You've really rocked my
world. After years of being
painstakingly reassured by kind
women, I have inferred from
your question that — at least to
some people — size does matter.
Sigh.
Just to get back at you, then,
I'll challenge one of your implic
it assumptions: Watching Rick
Moranis films is a bad way to
shape your expectations about
scientific fact.
The largest possible healthy
human being would be fairly
close in height to the tallest per
son you've ever seen in real life
— nowhere near the optimal size
for rearranging geography or
snacking on haystacks.
Assuming that you possessed
some infernal machine or equal
ly diabolic hormone treatment
that could arbitrarily increase a
person's height, you would
quickly encounter an insur
mountable physical barrier: At
some point, the person's body
would grow so massive that the
frame would be insufficiently
strong to support its own weight.
Let's do a little gedanken
experiment to illustrate this
point, using Gerhard Casper's
body as our imaginary subject
and making tiresome jokes
about his German ancestry. In
our thought experiment, we
expand our new president from
his current height of around 5-
foot-9 to progressively larger
and larger sizes.
Besides lifting Gerhard's
kopf to where the luft der frei
heit could blow the hair off his
ears, increasing his height
would have two main effects.
The strength of his frame and
musculature would grow, but
so would his mass.
If structural strength and
body mass increased in parallel,
there would be no obvious limit
to Gerhard's size. We could
imagine the new president as a
titan, travelling across the con

tinent in a few long strides,
scooping John Dingell out of his
cushy chair on Capitol Hill and
dispatching him as easily as an
ordinary person would consume
a link of bratwurst.
However, although struc
tural strength is proportional to
the square of height, body mass
grows as the cube. For those of
you who took Psych 60 to fill the
math distribution requirement,
this means that at 11-8 — twice
his current size — Gerhard
would be four times stronger,
but eight times heavier.
Hardly the iibermensch I fan
tasized about in the previous
paragraph, he would be unable
to support his own weight — a
predicament shared by erstwhile
Stanford gadfly Paul Biddle.
A normally proportioned
human frame would become
insufficiently strong to support
its mass at about eight feet tall,
which I therefore consider to
be the upper limit for the size
of a healthy human being.
