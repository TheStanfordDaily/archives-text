# Moral of the story? It pays to think big
## Psychology professor examines link between behavior and reproductive prowess 
### Jennifer Cho 
Ever notice how people equate
ego, courage and other "mascu
line" traits with the size of a
man's sexual organs? Are mod
ern-day Casanovas and guys who
bungee-jump off defective cranes
really so much more "well
endowed" than one's next door
neighbor?
Probably not. But members of
the Psychology Department have
put their curiosity to work by
studying the relationship between
a male's social status and gonad
size. Except these males aren't
human, they're fish.
Prof. Russell Fernald heads a
lab that is investigating the phys
iological effects of social interac
tion in the cichlid fish species
Haplochromis burtoni, which is
found in the shallow waters of
Lake Tanganyika in eastern
Africa.
Unlike humans, Haplochromis
burtoni males demonstrate
growth of their sexual organs as a
direct result of behavioral
changes due to elevated social sta
tus.
In the wild, the burtoni males
are found as two distinct types.
Although all are similar in size,
about 90 percent of the male pop
ulation are called non-territorial,
or non-dominant, and are distin
guished by a typically gray color
ing and underdeveloped sexual
organs.
The remaining 10 percent, the
territorial (dominant) males, con
trast markedly — with bright col
oring, large gonads and a black
eyebar called the lachrymal
stripe, which flashes on and off as
a sign of aggression. Territorial
males control all the food
resources.
Vincent Ho, a senior who
works with Fernald, has recently
won an Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Grant for his pro
posal to study the genetic and
hormonal linkage between these
behavioral and physiological
changes.
Call them what you want, Ho
said, "Machos and wimps, studs
and duds," these differences are a
key to the effect of the environ
ment on one's physiological
appearance.
What makes the burtoni males
so interesting to Fernald and Ho
is that dominance or non-domi
nance is not irreversibly pro

grammed into their genes. A
brightly-colored, sexually-active
territorial male may lose his ter
ritory and consequently become
just another "wimp" within a
matter of seconds. After losing a
fight against another dominant
male or even a non-dominant
one, the vanquished male imme
diately changes to a dull grayish
color, and its gonads eventually
shrink.
Similarly, a non-dominant
male can become a "stud" by
defeating a territorial male, a fact
immediately apparent by its
aggressive behavior, subsequent
color change and enlarged testes.
"If you are a territorial male,
you are treated a certain way by
other fish, and you must exhibit
certain behaviors in order to
defend you territory. As your
behavior changes, your physiolo
gy changes," Ho said.
"If you're not a territorial
male, you're a wimp, and you
spend a lot of time running
around scared. If you're a female,
you can basically have your way.
The territorial males spend a lot
of time courting them," he added.
In fact, according to Fernald,
"the whole name of the game is to
spawn with females."
Ironically, one of the things
that makes the territorial males
big cheeses in shallow water also
makes them especially vulnera
ble to attack. Their distinctive
coloring makes them more visi
ble to predatory birds, so the
turnover from dud to stud status
is relatively high and easily
observed.
Exactly how behavior influ
ences physiology is the focus of
Ho's research project.
"What we are looking at is the
underlying process of genetic
expression interacting with social
cues," Ho said.
Ho's study "investigates the
differences in the levels of
gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH) mRNA and peptide levels
as a function of social rank" in the
burtoni males.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a
DNA copy which carries the direc
tions for the production of GnRH
cells. GnRH regulates the release
of pituitary gonadotropins, which
stimulate the release of steroid
hormones from the gonads.
An interesting phenomenon
has been documented in newly
dominant males. Once they have

defeated a territorial male, the
GnRH producing cells in the
brain grow to 150 percent their
original size and eight times their
original volume. These cells in
turn stimulate the growth of the
testes. Therefore, all territorial
males have larger GnRH cells
than their non-territorial coun
terparts.
By quantifying the amount of
mRNA (which codes for GnRH
cell production) produced by the
different males, Ho hopes to
explain the connection between
mRNA levels and GnRH levels in
the males.
Starting with the basic
assumption that as GnRH cell
size increases, the amount of
GnRH increases, Ho has present
ed two possible conclusions to his
study. He may find that mRNA
and GnRH levels are proportional
to each other, or that mRNA lev
els remain the same in all males,
but the messages are amplified in
the territorial males.
If the former is the case, then
the physiological consequences of
behavioral changes are directly
related to increased levels of
mRNA. If the latter is the case,

Ho said he will then need to deter
mine the mechanism of the ampli
fication process.
"Everyone would agree that
our brains have differences, but
when are these differences mean
ingful?" Fernald said. "When you
find an important behavior, such
as sexual behavior, which is high
ly selected for in the fish brain, it
is obvious that there are very big
differences in the brains of domi
nant and non-dominant males."
Like many scientists investi
gating genetic and environmental
influences, Fernald is guided by
the desire to study the long term
consequences of social interac
tion.
The findings of researchers
like Fernald and Ho also suggest
that other animals are subject to
similar behavioral and physiologi
cal interaction.
Fernald has proposed that
even the human brain may be
affected to some degree by behav
ior. A lot of work remains before
that conjecture is proven. Howev
er, for now, it is safe to say that
for Haplochromis burtoni, at
least, studliness is a state of
mind.

Prof. Russell Fernald and Vincent Ho examine tanks of African Cich
lids. Each tank is a self-contained environment in which the social
status of males can be experimentally controlled. The laboratory
has over 75 tanks containing over 1,000 fish.
