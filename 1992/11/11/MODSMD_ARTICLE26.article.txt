## Throwing caution to the wind Kamikaze forward Sarah Rafanelli still running into Wall 
### Gretchen At wood Senior staff writer 
Any soccer player becomes familiar
with her home field, but Stanford for
ward Sarah Rafanelli has gotten to
know Maloney Field up close. As in
spread-eagle, face-plant, turf-swallow
ing close.
The junior's game is stamped with a
gritty, physical style which often helps
her score a goal despite having two or
three defenders climbing over her back
or hacking her legs. However, her
determination and knack for trying the
impossible often lands her at the bot
tom of a pile of bodies.
"I'm pretty short and I run low to
the ground so lots of times I get myself
off balance," Rafanelli said. "Or when I
try to dribble at full speed I get the full
backs off balance. One way or the other,
we always seem to end up on the
ground."
And with the ball resting in the back
of the net. The prolific forward has led
the Cardinal in scoring every year and
runs a close second to Julie Foudy this
season with 12 goals and 12 assists.
But her goals are sometimes over
shadowed by the acrobatic nature of
her play. In fact, some observers would
swear that Rafanelli occasionally uses
her style to milk calls from referees by
taking dives when defenders are hot on
her heels. But she insists that the Hol
lywood touch is not in her repertoire.
"I'm really not a good faker," she
said. "Taking a dive just to make it
obvious to the ref is useless because
then I've taken myself out of the play."
Most of the time that Rafanelli goes
down, it's no act. In last season's 2-1
regular-season loss to Santa Clara,
Rafanelli scored despite suffering a full
speed, head-on collision with Bronco
goalie Sue Wall.
With the Cardinal down 1-0,
Rafanelli sprinted after a loose, high
bouncing ball. Wall broke from the goal
and, just when it looked like she had
the ball in her grasp, Rafanelli leaped
and headed the ball over the keeper and

into the empty net.
A split-second after the shot,
Rafanelli and Wall crashed into each
other with an audible thwack as
Rafanelli tumbled back from the
impact. Cardinal teammates and coach
Berhane Andeberhan rushed over to
the prone forward.

'I'm really not a good
faker. Taking a dive
just to make it obvious
to the ref is useless
because then I've
taken myself out of the
play.'

"When everyone came out they
thought I got hit in the head," said
Rafanelli who was kneed in the chest.
"I just had the wind knocked out of
me.
Reaction to the play was mixed.
Some fans called Rafanelli's action
brave in the face of an imminent high
speed collision. Others considered the
risk of serious injury too high a price to
pay for a single goal and said the move
was reckless. Rafanelli is inclined to
agree with the latter.
"There are definitely smart plays
and stupid plays and that probably was
a stupid play," she said. "It ended up
that I was fine and we did get a goal. I
guess if I had gotten a concussion I
would have kicked myself like 'Why did
I even try that?' But you've got to try
the crazy things to learn how far you
can push it."
And make no mistake, Rafanelli will
try just about anything to help her
team win.
"My parents have always worried

about me because they think I'm a total
kamikaze," she said with a grin "I
always jump into things too fast.''
Although she considers her try-any
thing attitude a strength of her game,
she'd like to temper it with more skill
ful play.
"I need to take people on faster
because I do have speed but I don't use
it to my advantage all the time,"
Rafanelli said. "If I had really good
touch with the ball, I could throw
defenders off by using my speed and my
skill to unbalance them and get by
them."
This weekend Stanford's nemesis,
Santa Clara, will have the difficult task
of reigning in Rafanelli. The NCAA
quarterfinal game will be a rematch of
last year's playoff contest that the Car
dinal won 2-1 in overtime.
Rafanelli helped lead the squad to
victory as team captain Julie Foudy
was in China helping the U.S. National
Team claim the first-ever World Cup in
women's soccer.
"(The Bronco match) was a fun
game because everyone did have to step
up their game that extra notch since we
didn't have one of our key players,"
Rafanelli said. "It also proved, not just
to the other teams, but to ourselves,
that we can win without her."
Rafanelli might join Foudy on the
U.S. women's team by the time the
next World Cup rolls around in 1995.
She played with the national team last
summer and has been asked to several
training camps hosted by the squad's
coaches.
However, if a World Cup opportuni
ty doesn't materialize, she is unlikely to
pursue a professional soccer career
overseas.
"I don't think that's something I
want," said Rafanelli, who plans to
apply to medical school after gradua
tion and "become a real person again."
Whether Rafanelli spends the next
few years preparing for the World Cup
or a medical career, you can bet she
won't be afraid to do some bone
crunching along the way.

Despite being hampered by the wounds of recent soccer wars, junior Sarah Rafanelli
hopes to thrash the Santa Clara defense Sunday when the Cardinal hosts the Broncos
in the NCAA quarterfinals.
