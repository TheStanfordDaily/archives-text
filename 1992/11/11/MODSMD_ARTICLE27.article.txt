Some mid-term musings on the
world of sports. . . .
Remember when Mom said not to
insult someone you will not see for a
while because you might bump into them
again and need a favor? Well, it looks like
the Stanford Athletics Dept. might have
to make nice with the Freedom Bowl.
Last year, it was virtually signed,
sealed and delivered before Big Game
that the Cardinal would go south to Ana
heim. But then Denny Green and his
boys said a big "Aloha" to the Freedom in
favor of Hawaii and national television.
Now with the Bowl Alliance, the Pac
-10 has to send its third place team to the
bowl in Orange County. Currently, Stan
ford sits in the three slot. The Dec. 30
matchup was not what Gerhard Casper
had in mind when he urged the Stanford
community to "Let the winds of Freedom
blow."
The Freedom Bowl would essentially
be a repeat of the Pigskin Classic, but
against a lesser opponent. The Cardinal
would end the season where it started —
posing for mug shots with Mickey at Dis
neyland. . . .
The strongest football conference in
the nation? There's no doubt about it —

it's the Pac-10. Half of the Pac is ranked
in the top-25, and all five of those teams
should gain bowl bids. Take that, SEC,
Big 10 and Big East. . . .
Biggest mystery of the season: How
does the same team lose at home to
Washington State and tie Oregon State
on the road, while beating one No. 1
ranked team at home by 13 points and
narrowly losing by one point on the road
to the other? Must be the desert air. But
let's give Arizona credit. The miscues
were early in the season, and the Wild
cats have beaten Stanford, Cal and
UCLA in addition to Washington. . . .
What was USC coach Larry Smith
thinking when he replaced starting quar
terback Rob Johnson with backup Reg
gie (3-8) Perry during the game on Sat
urday? Talk about not wanting to win.

Smith's move was the answer to Cardi
nal fans' prayers. Sure enough, soon
after entering the game, Perry was in
fine form, tossing an interception. . . .
The Bowl Alliance is good for the Pac
-10 in a down year, guaranteeing that at
least three member schools will go to
bowl games. But in a strong year like this
one, it almost punishes the third place
team, as the third finisher is stuck with
the low-visibility Freedom while the
fourth place team can go to a more lucra
tive, and probably more visible, post sea
son game. . . .
Bring back the instant replay to the
NFL. It was good for the game. . . .
The Bay Area does not deserve the
Giants. Four measures for proposed new
stadiums have gone on the ballot, and all
of them failed. Only when owner Bob
Lurie packed his bags and took the St.
Petersburg offer did Bay Area fans real
ize he was not kidding. And what was
there to kid about? Candlestick Park is a
horrible place for baseball. When people
are wearing parkas, scarfs and earmuffs
in April, something is definitely wrong. .. .
One good thing about the Giants stay
ing in San Francisco is that one of base
ball's oldest and best rivalries, Dodgers-
Giants, is preserved. . . .

NBA predictions: Atlantic-New York
Knicks; Cen/ro/-Chicago Bulls; Midwest•
Utah Jazz; Pacific-Phoenix Suns. Play
offs: Eastern conference /ina/s-Chicago
over New York in seven; Western confer
ence finals-Phoenix over Utah in six.
NBA Finals: 'Da Bulls threepeat in five
over the Suns. . . .
Best off-season NBA movers-and
shakers: the Knicks' Pat Riley has a
potential championship squad, and will
give the Bulls their toughest test. The
acquisitions of Charles Smith and Doc
Rivers from the Clippers, Rolando Black
man from Dallas and Tony Campbell
from Minnesota were excellent. These
pickups lessen the free-agency loss of
Xavier McDaniel to Boston, and getting
rid of the erratic Mark Jackson is a
plus. . . .
Runner-up: Phoenix. Charles Barkley
and Danny Ainge turn this team into the
Best of the West. The Suns will outclass
Portland, who will be saved the embar
rassment of becoming the Minnesota
Vikings of the NBA Finals. . . .
Worst wheeler-dealers: Los Angeles
Clippers. The Clips made the playoffs for
the first time in 16 years last season, so
General Manager Elgin Baylor, with
great wisdom, traded away Smith, Rivers

and Olden Polynice in exchange for the
slow, obese front line of Stanley "I played
with Shaq in college so some people
think I'm good" Roberts and John (not
so) "Hot Rod" Williams. Plus, error
prone Jackson replaces the steady
Rivers. The Clipper brass are so used to
messing with their team after each sea
son that they must have forgotten the
team actually was good last year. Have
fun, Larry Brown. . . .
Mark it on your calendar: Feb. 9,
1993, Oakland Coliseum Arena. Adam
Keefe makes his first Bay Area appear
ance in a NBA uniform when the Atlanta
Hawks take on the Warriors. . . .
College hoops forecast: Michigan,
Duke and Indiana should make return
trips to the Final Four; Kentucky will
join them. . ..
The Pac-10 will again send four teams
to the NCAA Tournament. Arizona,
UCLA and Cal are locks. Stanford, Ore
gon State, and Arizona State will fight
for the other berth. . . .
Mike Tyson has been in jail for six
months. Has anyone noticed?

David Schwartz is thankful that the win
less New England Patriots do not have a
national radio network.

ize he was not kidding. And what was
there to kid about? Candlestick Park is a
horrible place for baseball. When people
are wearing parkas, scarfs and earmuffs
in April, something is definitely wrong. .. .
One good thing about the Giants stay
ing in San Francisco is that one of base
ball's oldest and best rivalries, Dodgers-
Giants, is preserved. . . .

NBA predictions: Atlantic-New York
Knicks; Cen/ro/-Chicago Bulls; Midwest•
Utah Jazz; Pacific-Phoenix Suns. Play
offs: Eastern conference /ina/s-Chicago
over New York in seven; Western confer
ence finals-Phoenix over Utah in six.
NBA Finals: 'Da Bulls threepeat in five
over the Suns. . . .
Best off-season NBA movers-and
shakers: the Knicks' Pat Riley has a
potential championship squad, and will
give the Bulls their toughest test. The
acquisitions of Charles Smith and Doc
Rivers from the Clippers, Rolando Black
man from Dallas and Tony Campbell
from Minnesota were excellent. These
pickups lessen the free-agency loss of
Xavier McDaniel to Boston, and getting
rid of the erratic Mark Jackson is a
plus. . . .
Runner-up: Phoenix. Charles Barkley
and Danny Ainge turn this team into the
Best of the West. The Suns will outclass
Portland, who will be saved the embar
rassment of becoming the Minnesota
Vikings of the NBA Finals. . . .
Worst wheeler-dealers: Los Angeles
Clippers. The Clips made the playoffs for
the first time in 16 years last season, so
General Manager Elgin Baylor, with
great wisdom, traded away Smith, Rivers

and Olden Polynice in exchange for the
slow, obese front line of Stanley "I played
with Shaq in college so some people
think I'm good" Roberts and John (not
so) "Hot Rod" Williams. Plus, error
prone Jackson replaces the steady
Rivers. The Clipper brass are so used to
messing with their team after each sea
son that they must have forgotten the
team actually was good last year. Have
fun, Larry Brown. . . .
Mark it on your calendar: Feb. 9,
1993, Oakland Coliseum Arena. Adam
Keefe makes his first Bay Area appear
ance in a NBA uniform when the Atlanta
Hawks take on the Warriors. . . .
College hoops forecast: Michigan,
Duke and Indiana should make return
trips to the Final Four; Kentucky will
join them. . ..
The Pac-10 will again send four teams
to the NCAA Tournament. Arizona,
UCLA and Cal are locks. Stanford, Ore
gon State, and Arizona State will fight
for the other berth. . . .
Mike Tyson has been in jail for six
months. Has anyone noticed?

David Schwartz is thankful that the win
less New England Patriots do not have a
national radio network.

Some mid-term musings on the
world of sports. . . .
Remember when Mom said not to
insult someone you will not see for a
while because you might bump into them
again and need a favor? Well, it looks like
the Stanford Athletics Dept. might have
to make nice with the Freedom Bowl.
Last year, it was virtually signed,
sealed and delivered before Big Game
that the Cardinal would go south to Ana
heim. But then Denny Green and his
boys said a big "Aloha" to the Freedom in
favor of Hawaii and national television.
Now with the Bowl Alliance, the Pac
-10 has to send its third place team to the
bowl in Orange County. Currently, Stan
ford sits in the three slot. The Dec. 30
matchup was not what Gerhard Casper
had in mind when he urged the Stanford
community to "Let the winds of Freedom
blow."
The Freedom Bowl would essentially
be a repeat of the Pigskin Classic, but
against a lesser opponent. The Cardinal
would end the season where it started —
posing for mug shots with Mickey at Dis
neyland. . . .
The strongest football conference in
the nation? There's no doubt about it —

it's the Pac-10. Half of the Pac is ranked
in the top-25, and all five of those teams
should gain bowl bids. Take that, SEC,
Big 10 and Big East. . . .
Biggest mystery of the season: How
does the same team lose at home to
Washington State and tie Oregon State
on the road, while beating one No. 1
ranked team at home by 13 points and
narrowly losing by one point on the road
to the other? Must be the desert air. But
let's give Arizona credit. The miscues
were early in the season, and the Wild
cats have beaten Stanford, Cal and
UCLA in addition to Washington. . . .
What was USC coach Larry Smith
thinking when he replaced starting quar
terback Rob Johnson with backup Reg
gie (3-8) Perry during the game on Sat
urday? Talk about not wanting to win.

Smith's move was the answer to Cardi
nal fans' prayers. Sure enough, soon
after entering the game, Perry was in
fine form, tossing an interception. . . .
The Bowl Alliance is good for the Pac
-10 in a down year, guaranteeing that at
least three member schools will go to
bowl games. But in a strong year like this
one, it almost punishes the third place
team, as the third finisher is stuck with
the low-visibility Freedom while the
fourth place team can go to a more lucra
tive, and probably more visible, post sea
son game. . . .
Bring back the instant replay to the
NFL. It was good for the game. . . .
The Bay Area does not deserve the
Giants. Four measures for proposed new
stadiums have gone on the ballot, and all
of them failed. Only when owner Bob
Lurie packed his bags and took the St.
Petersburg offer did Bay Area fans real
ize he was not kidding. And what was
there to kid about? Candlestick Park is a
horrible place for baseball. When people
