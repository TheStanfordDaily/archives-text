# Guards, tackles finally in line for Cardinal as third-place conference showdown awaits
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
Stanford put forth its best
offensive effort of the season in
last weekend's win over USC, but
the Cardinal will likely need an
even better one to outlast Wash
ington State and its high-octane
scoring machine this Saturday.
The game has significant post
season implications for both
teams. The winner has a legiti
mate shot to finish second in the
conference and grab a New Year's
Day bowl bid. The loser could fin
ish as low as sixth and possibly
out of the bowl picture altogether.
The Cougars (7-2, 4-2 in con
ference play) snapped a two-game
losing streak last week with a 20-
18 win over Arizona State and
crept to No. 21 in the polls.
Led by All-American quarter
back candidate Drew Bledsoe,
Washington State boasts the Pacif
ic 10 Conference's top offensive
unit. They lead the Pac-10 both in
scoring (29 points per game) and
total yards (414 per game).
Touted as one of the nation's
top professional prospects, Bled
soe has passed for 2,366 yards
and 16 touchdowns in nine
~*nes. But the Cougars attack is

not one-dimensional. Senior tail
back Shauir.be vvright-Fair is the
Pac-10's second-leading rusher
(behind California's Russell
White), averaging 102 yards per
game.

'I think it's going to
be a madcap, high
scoring game.'
- Bill Walsh

"We're going to have to have a
offensive effort to stay with
Washington State," said Stanford
head coach Bill Walsh. "Nobody
has really stopped them yet this
year, so our best bet is to score
with them. I think it's going to be
a madcap, high-scoring game."
If last Saturday was any indica
tion of how the Cardinal can score,
don't count the squad out if this
weekend turns out to be a free-for
all. Walsh and his braintrust made
some subtle changes in the attack
that seemed to give the Stanford
offense a bit more potency.
First, senior offensive lineman
Chris Dalman moved from right

guard to left tackle, the spot
vacated by now-Atlanta Falcon
Bob Whitfield. Previously, four
less experienced lineman had
been given shots at the position,
and none of them provided Sten
strom with solid protection on his
blind side.
Dalman's play against USC
was a key to the resurgence of
Stanford's passing game, as Sten
strom had time to get throws off
without worrying who was
breathing down his neck. Walsh
was especially pleased with Dal
man's performance. "I rue the
day I didn't move Chris over
there sooner . . . he'll play there
the remainder of the year," he
said.
In addition, Walsh varied snap
counts and went without a huddle
at times in an effort to catch the
defense off guard. Before last Sat
urday's game, "we tended to get
too routine with our snap count,
and our offensive linemen didn't
have any edge when the ball was
snapped.
"Those kind of things may
have helped. It appeared that
they did, but we'll find out this
week because Washington State
has a great defense."
If anyone out-performed Stan

ford's regular offensive unit last
Saturday, it was placekicking sen
sation Eric Abrams. Walsh lauded
Abrams' accuracy (15-for-17 field
goal attempts), and then poked at
little fun at Stanford's scant kick
ing tradition.
"He may go down as the great
est kicker in Stanford history . . .
which isn't necessarily the great
est honor you could receive. But
he has been a major contributor
to whatever success we've had
this year."
