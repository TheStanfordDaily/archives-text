Leland named to
investigation committee
Stanford athletic director
Ted Leland was named Tues
day to a three-person commit
tee that will determine whether
the University of Washington
knew of the financial transgres
sions of quarterback Billy Joe
Hobert, and if the school must
forfeit any of the eight games in
which Hobert has played this
season.
Hobert, the most valuable
player of last season's Rose
Bowl, has admitted to spending
$50,000 of borrowed money in
three months last spring and
was declared ineligible for the
remainder of the season by
Washington athletic director
Barbara Hedges yesterday,
according to the Associated
Press.
Leland, UCLA's Douglas
Hobbs and Oregon State's
Patricia Drapela will convene
Thursday in Los Angeles to be
presented with the findings of a
joint investigation by the con
ference and Washington offi
cials, and will make a recom
mendation to the Pac-10 Coun
cil at large on Sunday.
Giants to stay in Bay Area
Baseball owners on Tuesday

rejected the Giants' proposed
move to St. Petersburg, Fla.,
and decided to keep the team in
San Francisco, according to the
Associated Press.
With Giants owner Bob
Lurie excluded from the voting,
the proposed $115 million sale
of the team to a group headed
by Vincent J. Naimoli needed
the approval of 10 of the
National League's 13 other
owners.
The transaction only
received four affirmative votes.
Lurie, who bought the
Giants for $8 million in 1976,
will now consider a $100 mil
lion local offer of Safeway Inc.
chairman Peter Magowan.
