# Trips to begin in fall
## 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The first-year trips program — created
last spring by a $74,000 grant from ASSU
reserves — will begin next fall as a pilot
program, allowing 200 new students to
take three- to five-day trips upon arriving
at Stanford.
The REDWOOD program, Recreational
Educational Developmental Workshops
Out Of Doors, is in charge of organizing the
trips, training student assistants and ob
taining the equipment, said program stu
dent assistant Jessie Levine.
The program will hire a coordinator this
week to begin working on details for next
year's trips and outdoor excursions for in
coming freshmen, transfer students and

first-year graduate students.
Levlne said 30 people from "all over the
country" applied for the position. Many of the
applicants are experienced in creating and ad
ministrating outdoor programs, she said.
Originally the ASSU estimated the trips
would cost about $85 a student, but accord
ing to program student assistant Francisco
Villegas, five-day trips will cost about $150
while three-day trips will total about $100.
He said $5,000 of the ASSU money has
been set aside for financial aid, which will
equal about 66 half-price scholarships.
The remainder of the ASSU money will
fund the coordinator position, several as
sistant positions and will pay for equip
ment like first aid kits, tents and camp
