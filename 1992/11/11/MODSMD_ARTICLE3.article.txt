# Trips to begin in fall
## 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The first-year trips program — created
last spring by a $74,000 grant from ASSU
reserves — will begin next fall as a pilot
program, allowing 200 new students to
take three- to five-day trips upon arriving
at Stanford.
The REDWOOD program, Recreational
Educational Developmental Workshops
Out Of Doors, is in charge of organizing the
trips, training student assistants and ob
taining the equipment, said program stu
dent assistant Jessie Levine.
The program will hire a coordinator this
week to begin working on details for next
year's trips and outdoor excursions for in
coming freshmen, transfer students and

first-year graduate students.
Levlne said 30 people from "all over the
country" applied for the position. Many of the
applicants are experienced in creating and ad
ministrating outdoor programs, she said.
Originally the ASSU estimated the trips
would cost about $85 a student, but accord
ing to program student assistant Francisco
Villegas, five-day trips will cost about $150
while three-day trips will total about $100.
He said $5,000 of the ASSU money has
been set aside for financial aid, which will
equal about 66 half-price scholarships.
The remainder of the ASSU money will
fund the coordinator position, several as
sistant positions and will pay for equip
ment like first aid kits, tents and camp
stoves, said former ASSU senator
Jason Snyder, who helped initiate
the program last spring. After two
years, the coordinator and assis
tant positions will be funded by a
special fee request.

The group is currently
trying to decide
whether the trips will
take place before or
during Orientation.

In addition to first-year trips,
the program will fund departmen
tal trips and workshops for stu
dents beginning this year.
"[We're] beginning to develop
workshops to run winter and
spring quarters that are focused
on things other than backpack
ing," Levine said.
She added that things will begin

happening once the coordinator
arrives on campus. "One of the
main jobs for the program coordi
nator is to train student leaders
for first-year trips," Levine said.
Half of the first-year trips will
focus on wilderness training, and
will be to places such as Yosemite
National Park. Many East Coast
schools such as Dartmouth and
Harvard offer similar programs;
however, Stanford's will be unique
by also offering public service-ori
ented trips, which will resemble
the Alternative Spring Break pro
gram. Between 10 and 15 students
will participate in each trip.
Villegas said the group is cur
rently trying to decide whether the
trips will take place before or dur
ing Orientation. He said the pro
gram is currently talking with the
Office of Residential Education
and the Orientation Committee
about when the trips will take
place, but noted that Res Ed is
worried about students meeting
before Orientation or missing Ori
entation activities.
"We'd like to see it happen
before Orientation," he said.
"Hopefully, they will eventually
become part of Orientation."
