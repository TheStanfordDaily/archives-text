# Taxol treatment fails, cheerleader dies at Hospital
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Valerie Pida, a former UNLV
cheerleader whose battle against
cancer brought her into the public
eye, died yesterday at Stanford
Hospital, where she was receiving
treatment with the experimental
drug taxol. She was 25.
Pida suffered from Hodgkin's
disease, a type of cancer of the lym
phatic system. She was at the hos

pital for treatment with taxol — a
rare cancer-fighting drug derived
from the bark of the Pacific yew
tree — when her condition took a
turn for the worse.
Michael Ennis, a hospital resi
dent who was in charge of Pida's
treatment in the hospital's inten
sive care unit, said Pida was one of
the first Hodgkin's patients to be
treated with taxol. He stressed that
the drug did not cause her death.
Chemistry Prof. Paul Wender,

who is close to creating a com
pletely synthetic molecule of taxol,
said the drug has not commonly
been used on lymphatic cancers.
The drug was first used to treat
ovarian cancers, and more recent
ly has been tried on patients with
breast, head and lung cancers.
According to Ennis, Pida died of
sepsis, a "total-body poisoning
that gets into the blood."
Specifically, Pida became in
fected with strep pneumonia, an

infection "that is best fought by
people with spleens, but because of
her conditions, (doctors) removed
her spleen" many years ago, when
she was first diagnosed with can
cer, Ennis said.
Infections are common in
Hodgkin's patients who have had
chemotherapy, because the treat
ment weakens their immune sys
tems, he added.
On Wednesday, Pida was trans
ferred to intensive care because of

the infection, and her condition
started worsening quickly on Sun
day, Ennis said. She fell into a
coma, and was pronounced dead at
4:22 a.m. yesterday.
Pida came into the public spot
light in 1987, when she was a
cheerleader at the University of
Nevada at Las Vegas. When the
school's basketball team went to
the NCAA Final Four tourna
ment, she postponed a scheduled
bone marrow transplant to at

tend.
Ennis said Pida "requested to
be as conscious as possible for as
long as possible," and was con
scious until Monday morning.
Pida's father Bob recounted
their last conversation, which took
place Monday: "I came over and
held her hand, and said 'Valerie, I
love you.' She couldn't talk, but
with her lips mouthed 'I love you.'
That's the last thing she ever
said."
