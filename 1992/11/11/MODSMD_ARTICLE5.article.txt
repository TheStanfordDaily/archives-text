# Tyrrell speaks, doesn't skateboard

### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
R. Emmett Tyrrell had one question about
Stanford before coming to campus this week:
"Do professors have a place to park their skate
boards outside the Faculty Club?"
"I understand there's a division in the Stan
ford faculty between the hard-core eggheads
who insist on playing six hours of Nintendo per
day and those who wear Bermuda shorts and
insist on playing golf six hours per day," Tyrrell
said in an interview with The Daily. "I would
just like to bring them together and talk about
what a professor ought to do."
Whether asked about the state of higher edu
cation or the recent election, the outspoken, ir
reverent conservative commentator promises to
say everything that's on his mind during his talk
tonight titled "A Post-Election View of the
American Political Scene." He will speak at 7:30
in the Hoover Institution's Staufter Auditorium.
"I will be speaking on American politics. If it

sounds like I'm talking about the Third World,
it is only because my view of American politics
is more accurate than most people about these
things," said Tyrrell, who argues, among other
things, that Ronald Reagan was the most suc
cessful president since Franklin D. Roosevelt.

the dignity of a full professor.'

Tyrrell, the founder and editor of The Amer
ican Spectator, proudly trumpets the fact that
his conservative monthly magazine is one of
the fastest-growing intellectual reviews in the
country, with readership jumping from 26,000
to 85,000 in the last six months.
And what does the election of Bill Clinton
mean for the future of Tyrrell's magazine?
"Happy days are here again!" Tyrrell glee

fully exclaimed. "I haven't had as much fun
since 1979 and Jimmy Carter. ... I will be
grateful to Bill Clinton for all of the zany things
that he is going to do.
But Tyrrell's dislike for Clinton doesn't
mean he was a big supporter of President Bush.
"George Bush didn't deserve to win. He
couldn't formulate a case and he wasn't con
vincing that he was going to do anything differ
ent," he said. "We have just elected the Democ
rats' third team. The first and second string
wanted nothing to do with this campaign.
"George Bush lost against the third string,
and that's not easy to do," Tyrrell said.
This week's visit to Stanford also gives
Tyrrell a chance to sympathize with the stu
dents, he said.
"I feel sorry for American students. They
are the most propagandized, indoctrinated
people on the face of the Earth," he said. "I
have a very low impression of university pro
fessors. ... I think Nintendo and golf are be
neath the dignity of a full professor."
