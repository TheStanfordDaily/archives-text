# Students pedal for dollars

When junior Jennifer Kreshak goes on a bike ride,
she really gets around.
This past summer, over two-and-a-half months,
Kreshak hiked with 20 other cyclists from San Fran
cisco to Washington, 1). C., all in the course of helping
communities, educating each other, charitable fund
raising — and having fun.
Kreshak participated in Bike-Aid, a non-profit
fundraising and awareness project started seven
years ago by the national Overseas Development Net
work, which addresses global problems of poverty
and injustice and funds small-scale, self-sustaining
grass-roots projects worldwide. The Stanford Inter
national Development Organization is the Universi
ty's branch of the network.
Kreshak first became interested in Bike-Aid
through a friend who had done it three years ago. "He
kept talking about it, and when I saw what Bike-Aid
stood for and what it does, everythingjust jelled," Kre
shak said.
Bike-Aid cyclists have raised more than $750,000
to support domestic and international projects rang
ing from rescue financial aid for Missouri farms in
crisis to the learning Tree, an organization aimed at
helping African-American youth in high-risk/high
crime areas.
Bike-Aid cyclists come from all over the world to the
nation's capital from the six send-off cities, including
San Francisco. Along the way, the riders stay in church
es, camps, school gyms or wherever else is suitable.
"We don't pay for lodging, and a lot of the necessary

costs of the trip are funded by donation," Kreshak said.
Along the way, the riders interact with communities
such as battered women's centers, AIDS hospices,
farmers in crises, Native American groups and church
es in order to introduce themselves to different com
munities and their challenges.
Since the project itself is self-sustaining, riders must
have pledges totaling a minimum of $2,000, and they are
encouraged to have pledges of at least $1 per mile; the
route from San Francisco to Washington is 3,600 miles.
"It really opened up my eyes," Kreshak said. "At
Stanford, you're very much in your own little bubble;
with Bike-Aid, you still have your own little routine
with the biking, but you become much more percep
tive and aware.
"Stanford is pretty heterogeneous, but in a way, it's
also not. When you go on Bike-Aid, you're not with your
'I got 1400 on my SAT' group of friends anymore."
Kreshak believes that students can get a feel for the
real world through Bike-Aid. "With Bike-Aid, you may
be out in the middle of Indiana, and that's where you
are," she said. "It made me a lot less concerned with
trivial little detail.
Kreshak said that the one thing she wants to tell
people is what a good experience Bike-Aid can be.
"This is an experience I won't trade for anything else.
I look at a map, and I think, 'I crossed the U.S. on bike.'
Even aside from that, it taught me to see things less
cynically.
"Start small-scale; you can't change the world in a
day. If there's something you see in your community,
do something that you can do — it doesn't have to be
global."
