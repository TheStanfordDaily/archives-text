# King of the board
## Bronstein plays chess for art's sake 
### Carrie Chang Editorial staff 
It is a visual symphony in
black and white: pawns,
knights and queens gliding ef
fortlessly across the board with
the precision of sixteenth notes.
Poised behind the chess
board, David Bronstein seems
more like a conductor or an
artist than one of the greatest
chess masters of all time.
"Chess is an art. It is the art
of thinking, of discovery, fanta
sy, intuition ..." said the 68-yr
old Bronstein, who is visiting
from Russia.
"The position should be
beautiful," he added, moving a
pawn to create a pleasing sym
metry of black and white to il
lustrate his point.
Although Bronstein insists
that "numbers cannot be put on
the mind," he is ranked as one of
the 20 greatest players of all
time. In 1951, he tied with
Mikhail Botvinnik for the World
Chess Championships and has
authored many chess books.
"Chess is simply chess," said
Bronstein, echoing an "art for
art's sake" credo. "It is clever
and intellectual, but it is simply
one of many games.
"It is a pleasant way to spend
the evening," he added with a
smile.
Born in 1924, Bronstein first
began to spend those "pleasant
evenings of chess" when his
grandfather taught him how to
play at age 9.
"My first hopes were very
naive. I thought if I just played
two games, one white and one
black, in a few days I would
know how to play," recalled
Bronstein.
Naive or not, Bronstein, gift
ed with mathematical ability
and logic, went on to win his
first tournament at age 12.
"When you begin to play
chess you learn two things: one,
to respect the way another per
son thinks. And two, to smile

when you know you arc losing,
and then shake hands and say,
'Yes, you played brilliantly!"'
Bronstein said. "This is the
hardest part."
Although chess if useful in
teaching young children "ele
mentary logic," it is not a game
of "pure calculation," Bronstein
said. "First there is feeling. You
must make it a big holiday. You
must express yourself," he said,
snapping his fingers.
Perhaps that is why comput
ers will never be chess players,
said Bronstein, who was invited
to the United States by Hewlett-
Packard to play against comput
ers and to give talks.
"Computers use brute force.
They don't play to say anything
beautiful. They make moves,
and it's a wonder. But they play
moves. They don't play chess,"
Bronstein insisted. "There is
nothing between the moves.

"The sad thing about chess art
is that the master creates the
music of the games in silence, and
it is never heard or recorded. The
moves of the game are published,
but the music between the moves
is lost," he lamented.
But while computers cannot
make "music," in their chess
games, they can help chess players,
Bronstein said. "They open our
limited world. Sometimes I learn

from them. They are not afraid,."
While at Hewlett-Packard Labs
this past week, Bronstein played
several games against the
"bravest" of the world's chess com
puters, Deepthought.
"What was extremely pleasur
able for me was the fact that people
would send messages to me on the
network between the moves," said
Bronstein, delighted with his new
found fans in the world of e-mail.
Bronstein's warm reception on
the network disputes the notion
that chess is merely a "Russian"
sport, relegated in America to a
few park benches.

"Chess is like baseball, basket
ball in my country," Bronstein
said. "But the United States has a
very great and noble history many
people do not know about. It was
one of the first countries in which
chess was made widely popular,"
he explained.
Chess culture often served as
bridge between the then-Soviet
Union and America, allowing an
exchange in plays when words
could not be civilly exchanged.
"I think we played a great part
in ending the Cold War. I do not
agree with your president," said
Bronstein, referring to President

Bush's claim to have "won the
Cold War."
"Many of the best brains on this
planet were fighting for the end of
the Cold War, not only America."
Despite Bronstein's participation
in many professional tournaments,
he insists the "love of play, different
situations and feelings" of com
raderie motivate him to play chess.
"The purpose of chess is to
make friends," he said. "It is the
international language of friend
ship. It does not matter whether
computers become better players
than humans. Chess will always
play this part."

began to spend those "pleasant
evenings of chess" when his
grandfather taught him how to
play at age 9.
"My first hopes were very
naive. I thought if I just played
two games, one white and one
black, in a few days I would
know how to play," recalled
Bronstein.
Naive or not, Bronstein, gift
ed with mathematical ability
and logic, went on to win his
first tournament at age 12.
"When you begin to play
chess you learn two things: one,
to respect the way another per
son thinks. And two, to smile

when you know you arc losing,
and then shake hands and say,
'Yes, you played brilliantly!"'
Bronstein said. "This is the
hardest part."
Although chess if useful in
teaching young children "ele
mentary logic," it is not a game
of "pure calculation," Bronstein
said. "First there is feeling. You
must make it a big holiday. You
must express yourself," he said,
snapping his fingers.
Perhaps that is why comput
ers will never be chess players,
said Bronstein, who was invited
to the United States by Hewlett-
Packard to play against comput
ers and to give talks.
"Computers use brute force.
They don't play to say anything
beautiful. They make moves,
and it's a wonder. But they play
moves. They don't play chess,"
Bronstein insisted. "There is
nothing between the moves.

"The sad thing about chess art
is that the master creates the
music of the games in silence, and
it is never heard or recorded. The
moves of the game are published,
but the music between the moves
is lost," he lamented.
But while computers cannot
make "music," in their chess
games, they can help chess players,
Bronstein said. "They open our
limited world. Sometimes I learn

from them. They are not afraid,."
While at Hewlett-Packard Labs
this past week, Bronstein played
several games against the
"bravest" of the world's chess com
puters, Deepthought.
"What was extremely pleasur
able for me was the fact that people
would send messages to me on the
network between the moves," said
Bronstein, delighted with his new
found fans in the world of e-mail.
Bronstein's warm reception on
the network disputes the notion
that chess is merely a "Russian"
sport, relegated in America to a
few park benches.

"Chess is like baseball, basket
ball in my country," Bronstein
said. "But the United States has a
very great and noble history many
people do not know about. It was
one of the first countries in which
chess was made widely popular,"
he explained.
Chess culture often served as
bridge between the then-Soviet
Union and America, allowing an
exchange in plays when words
could not be civilly exchanged.
"I think we played a great part
in ending the Cold War. I do not
agree with your president," said
Bronstein, referring to President

Bush's claim to have "won the
Cold War."
"Many of the best brains on this
planet were fighting for the end of
the Cold War, not only America."
Despite Bronstein's participation
in many professional tournaments,
he insists the "love of play, different
situations and feelings" of com
raderie motivate him to play chess.
"The purpose of chess is to
make friends," he said. "It is the
international language of friend
ship. It does not matter whether
computers become better players
than humans. Chess will always
play this part."
It is a visual symphony in
black and white: pawns,
knights and queens gliding ef
fortlessly across the board with
the precision of sixteenth notes.
Poised behind the chess
board, David Bronstein seems
more like a conductor or an
artist than one of the greatest
chess masters of all time.
"Chess is an art. It is the art
of thinking, of discovery, fanta
sy, intuition ..." said the 68-yr
old Bronstein, who is visiting
from Russia.
"The position should be
beautiful," he added, moving a
pawn to create a pleasing sym
metry of black and white to il
lustrate his point.
Although Bronstein insists
that "numbers cannot be put on
the mind," he is ranked as one of
the 20 greatest players of all
time. In 1951, he tied with
Mikhail Botvinnik for the World
Chess Championships and has
authored many chess books.
"Chess is simply chess," said
Bronstein, echoing an "art for
art's sake" credo. "It is clever
and intellectual, but it is simply
one of many games.
"It is a pleasant way to spend
the evening," he added with a
smile.
