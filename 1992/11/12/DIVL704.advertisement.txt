Qv) \ VMX was created by entrepreneurial
» engineers whose ideas have evolved
into the billion dollar voice process
ing industry. Since our founding in
1978, we have led the industry with innovations
like voice messaging, call processing, interactive
voice response, and mixed media messaging, lie an
important part of our future. It's an unprecedented
opportunity to advance your knowledge while
helping us create the next generation of voice
processing innovations.
Hardware Engineers
We're developing digital hardware for our latest
voice processing/multiprocessor systems. Areas of
concentration include microprocessor -based
designs, real-time control firmware, FPGA, SCSI,
using the latest development tools (CAD, simula
tion, logic analyzers and emulators). For engi
neering graduates with a BSEE or MSEE degree,
some familiarity with C and assembly language
programming is also required.

Software Engineers
Many of our software needs involve development
and support of real-time control software within a
multiprocessor environment for call processing,
voice messaging and other communication
products. Using Sun workstations in a UNIX
environment, we're developing new products
to work over multiple platforms including
Motorola b<S()x() and Intel xftf> processors.
Requires a BSCS or MSCS degree, proficiency
in C and assembly language programming, plus
good communication skills.
Not every company offers the entrepreneurial
environment where you may make immediate
engineering contributions. We're small, focused
and absolutely committed to creating the best
products in the voice processing marketplace.
Over the next ten years, the industry will grow
substantially, and with your assistance, we'll
retain our technological leadership.
