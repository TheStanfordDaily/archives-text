# A 						new name and identity for XTV
## 
### Caroline Smrstik 
Stanford Cardinal Broadcasting
Network, or SCBN, is the latest incar
nation of Stanford's student television
station.
Formerly known as XTV, the closed
circuit station is taking on a new identi
ty to go with its name.
"I'm thinking in terms of a profes
sional organization, not just a club,"
said station manager Matthew Ku
likowski. "XTV had no procedures, no
structure. Now we have a definite orga
nizational structure."
SCBN has established three divi
sions: arts and entertainment program
ming, news and sports.
The station has yet to make its on-air
debut this year; even though there is
old XTV programming that could be
broadcast over SUNet, SCBN wants to
make a fresh start.

The 12 active staff members are
working feverishly to get new program
ming on the air by the end of fall quar
ter.
In the works is a David Letterman
like talk show, "The Study Break;" on
going sports coverage of men's and
women's basketball and volleyball; and
a drama/mystery series that is not yet
titled.
"I realized the most important thing
for our station was to make ourselves
known," said Kulikowski, a sophomore.
"If we can get three good shows on the
air, it'll attract people."
The top priority for SCBN is to in
crease student involvement with the
network, Kulikowski said, adding that
the station will arrange training ses
sions for volunteers interested in the
technical aspects of broadcasting.
SCBN was denied its special fee re
quest in last year's ASSU election, but

later received $4,000 in Program Board
funds.
"It's minimal, but it's still money to
work with," said Kulikowski. In previ
ous years, the station has had a budget
of as much as $22,000.
SCBN is in the process of applying
for membership in the National Associ
ation of College Broadcasters, a group
of more than 600 university networks.
With a satellite downlink and mem
bership in the group of college broad
casters, the Stanford network could
share programming with other univer
sities across the country.
Other ideas for expansion include an
on-air bulletin board for campus orga
nizations to broadcast messages; more
sports coverage; sharing programming
with the Palo Alto public access televi
sion station; and making contacts with
Stanford alumni :n the television in
dustry.
