Inouye charged with harassment
HONOLULU (AP) — U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye is
denying new allegations of sexual harassment
made by nine women who called a state lawmaker,
most without giving their names.
"We have a problem with nine shadowy figures
that we have no chance to confront," said Inouye's
press secretary, Nestor Garcia. "What evidence do
they have to substantiate the allegations?"
The allegations follow public accusations
against Inouye last month by his former hair
stylist, who said the Hawaii Democrat sexually
assaulted her 17 years ago.
State Rep. Annelle Amaral, head of the House
Women's Caucus, told KHON-TV on Tuesday she
had received "a number of calls from people that
have said to me that they were also victims of the
senator."
Amaral, a Democrat who supported Inouye's re
election bid, said she went public with the claims
without any proof because "I believe it's important
for elected officials to be held to a certain code of
conduct."
Inouye, 68, was re-elected to a sixth term Nov. 3
despite last month's accusations by hair stylist
Lenore Kwock. She initially voiced her complaint
in a private conversation that was secretly record
ed by a former campaign worker for Republican
state Sen. Rick Reed, who faced Inouye in the gen

eral election.
Reed used portions of the tape in campaign ads,
but denied any role in setting Kwock up to talk
about her experiences with Inouye.
53-year-old gives birth to twins
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Twin test tube girls
born to a 53-year-old woman are "beautiful, abso
lutely fantastic" and should inspire others who
have difficulty bearing children, their father said
yesterday.
"I feel like a proud dad, very proud," Don Shear
ing, 32, said at a news conference at Martin Luther
Hospital, where the girls were born prematurely on
Tuesday.
The girls' mother, Mary Shearing, was in good
condition and good spirits, her husband said.
The tiny twins, about 12 weeks premature, were
in guarded but stable condition in the neonatal
intensive care unit, said Dr. Leonard Fox, a neona
tologist at the hospital.
Mrs. Shearing is believed to be the oldest Amer
ican in the latter stages of menopause to deliver
babies through the in-vitro process, said hospital
spokesman Dennis Gaschen.
The twins were conceived using sperm from her
husband of seven years and eggs from an uniden
tified donor in her 20s, who was paid $1,500, doc
tors said.
