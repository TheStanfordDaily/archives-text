# EC to meet with US on trade

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -
European Community negotia
tors said yesterday they will meet
with their U.S. counterparts
within a week to try to avert a
trade war that could damage
struggling economies on both
sides of the Atlantic.
The announcement signaled
that the 12-nation bloc has at
least temporarily bridged differ
ences over dealing with U.S.
demands for further cuts in subsi
dies paid to EC farmers. Britain,
Germany and others have urged
compromise, while France has
pressed for retaliation.
The Bush administration has
given the EC until Dec. 5 to
resolve the dispute or face import

taxes on $300 million worth of
European products, mostly
French white wines. The United
States and other countries argue
that the subsidies keep European
agriculture prices unfairly low in
world markets.
Although farm lobbies are
strong in most of the European
Community nations, influential
British and German industrial
groups, which fear a trade war
would further slow economies,
apparently had the last word.
"There is an urgent need to
come to terms with the Ameri
cans," said EC spokesman Nico
Wegter. "There is a very good rea
son to believe. . . that a deal can
be made," he added.

EC Farm Commissioner Ray
MacSharry and EC Trade Com
missioner Frans Andriessen hope
to meet quickly with their U.S.
counterparts, Agriculture Secre
tary Edward Madigan and Trade
Representative Carla Hills. The
meeting could come as early as
this weekend, but is more likely to
occur next week.
France, the EC's biggest agri
cultural producer, says cuts
could drive many of its small
farmers out of business and
change the social and cultural
fabric of its nation. About 6 per
cent of France's workers are
employed on farms, a far higher
percentage than in most indus
trial nations.
