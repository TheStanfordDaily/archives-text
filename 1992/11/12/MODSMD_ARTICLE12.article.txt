# Police beating rocks Detroit

### 
DETROIT (AP) — At the inter
section of Warren and 23rd, where
empty lots and boarded buildings
still bear witness to the riots of the
19605, there's a new focal point:
police violence of the '90s.
On a wall adorned by flowers is
a plastic-covered picture of Malice
Green, a 35-year-old man beaten
to death by police last week.
"I can't believe this is happen
ing in my city," Carrie Washing
ton, a mother of three grown chil
dren, said in frustration. "The
police used to be our friends."
The death of the black motorist
at the hands of a racially mixed
group of police, that echoes last
year's beating of black motorist
Rodney King by Los Angeles
police, has roiled this city, noted

for its integrated, neighborhood
based policing.
Those familiar with Detroit's
police say Green's death points to
something else: an undermanned
force lacking the money or leader
ship to weed out violent cops of
both races.
Green, an unemployed father of
five, died from head injuries in a
fracas with police last week.
Several hundred people, most of
whom had never met Green, trick
led into a Detroit funeral home for
a wake yesterday. Funeral services
were scheduled for today.
While no official details have
been released, witnesses say the
confrontation began as Green
dropped off a friend near a board
ed-up hair salon suspected to be a

crack house.
Lee Hardv, an emergency medi
cal technician flagged down by
police, told The Detroit News he
saw four white officers kick Green
in the chest and beat his head,
arms and hands with a flashlight.
Six white officers and a black
supervisor were suspended. Mayor
Coleman Young and Police Chief
Stanley Knox, both black, decried
Green's death — Young going so
far as to call it murder.
Police brutality claims here
have decreased over the last
decade, but the department has
had other problems recently,
including huge cutbacks. City bud
get problems forced a 26 percent
cut in the department from 5,186
five years ago to 3,850 today.
