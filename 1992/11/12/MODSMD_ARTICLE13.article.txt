Road trips, camping.
Hiking. These are the things
that inspire bonding
between classmates. And they will
be provided by the new first-year
trips program.
The first-year trips program,
which allows incoming students the
opportunity to take three- and five
day trips before or during Orienta
tion, will give new students a chance
to form close friendships and have a
positive image of Stanford before
ever touching foot on campus.
Many University personnel and
publications talk of the importance
of "community building," "residen
tial-based education," and other
concepts which are difficult to
define. Regardless of what the jar
gon is supposed to mean, an over
riding goal of the Orientation pro
gram should be to make it easy for
students to get to know each other

and feel welcomed by Stanford.
The first year trips program —
much more than Stanfordopoly
and other Orientation events —
will do just that. Other institu
tions, such as Harvard and Dart
mouth, have instituted similar
programs to much success.
Refreshingly, the ASSU has
realized the utility of such a pro
gram and found an appropriate
place to spend a bit of its reserve
money.
The intensity and pressure of
one's first days at Stanford —
which, although fun, can often be
overwhelming — would be eased
by a pre-Orientation trip with
future classmates. Instead of being
forced to sit home, twiddling their
thumbs for the month of Septem
ber, new students will have a
chance to begin their Stanford edu
cation in a positive, exciting way.
