# Expressing yourself

Express yourself -
that's what Madonna tells
us. And one man in Berkeley
— dubbed the "Naked Guy" for his
Adam-like strolls through the cam
pus — has been taking her advice.
Campus authorities finally got
fed up with all the flesh and kicked
the young nudist off campus for
two weeks after adopting a ban on
public nakedness.
It seems strange that this reac
tion would come from Berkeley, hip
pie central of the '60s and home to
everything liberal. However, this
reaction is just another example of
the hysteria that surrounds any sex
ual issue that crops up in America.
Our right to freedom of expres
sion, vigorously protected when it
comes to political issues, is cast
aside when someone wants to dress,
or undress, unconventionally.
In another instance of overexpo
sure, J.J. Lasley caused a stir last
week when a partially nude picture
of him appeared in The Daily.

Lasley's picture drew repeated ref
erences from Stanford football
radio commentators and has been
discussed widely around campus.
Behind the public fear of dis
plays of sexuality, though, lingers a
great private desire to explore the
issue.
Despite scathing reviews from
around the nation, Madonna's new
book sits comfortably atop The
New York Times non-fiction best
seller list. It's unfortunate that
artistic efforts to visually address
sexuality are so rare that a San
Jose bookstore can charge its
patrons $1 a minute just to look at
the book.
Certainly, all of these recent
events are worthy of notice, but
the severe reactions to them reflect
America's unhealthy approach to
all things sexual. Public expression
of sexuality is stifled while we pri
vately thirst for — witness people
paying $50 for a poorly bound book
— exploration of the human body.
