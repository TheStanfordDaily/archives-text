## Highways equal danger 
### 
THIS PAST WEEK, MY DAD SENT
me an article which addresses the
rising threat of crime on many of
America's major highways. He wrote
"Makes good sense to read this" across
the top of the page, and it is my feeling
that it makes good sense for others to
hear it as well.
In a country already rife with detestable
levels of crime, highways are the new and
untapped wells across the land, offering a
large and 24-hour source of potential vic
tims, as well as an easy means of escape for
crimes ranging from car theft and armed
robbery to rape and murder.
A security consultant interviewed in
the article states that his company's
recording of '20,000 serious highway
crimes in the last 12 months is "only the
tip of the iceberg." How happy Mr. Ker
ouac would be to see what his heartland
has turned into; perhaps we should turn
to the skyways in search of "It."
Next time you're on the road and you
see what look like sirens in your rear-view
mirror, perhaps you'll be just one of
25,000 men, women and children each
year, who are victimized by the mock
arrests of people impersonating police offi
cers — men, women and children who
each year suffer abduction, rape and bat
tery as a consequence.
In case you're wondering where anyone
could get such a sick idea, open any given
law-enforcement magazine to find out

where to send away for a set of red or blue
flashing lights that can be attached to the
dashboard of your car.
Or maybe you'll be on the side of the
road struggling with a flat tire or stalled
engine, and a "Good Samaritan" will come
to your aid — the same person who sabo
taged your car while you were inside the
restaurant or rest stop, and now, 10 miles
later, has pulled over to help, walking
towards you with a smile, a set of shiny
tools and intentions of rape and robbery.
"We seem to be reverting to the days of
the highwayman, when everybody got into
the castle at night and pulled up the draw
bridge, leaving the main roads between
communities the most dangerous places,"
said another security consultant inter
viewed in the article.
Perhaps agoraphobia is the appropriate
call to order, and not the disorder we all
saw in our high school psychology books
with the photograph of the ghost-faced
lady being helped down the stairs outside
her house, scared of her new surround
ings. To be afraid of the outside world
seems pretty logical these days.
Why does a person driving to the mall
in Florida have to risk being shot at by
"overpass snipers?" Why do I have to fear
for my mom being "car-jacked" when she
drives into New York City for a doctor's
appointment?
One of the benefits I've enjoyed most
about coming to Stanford is the cross

country trips I've made with friends each
summer between school and home in Con
necticut.
But when I read that methods for deal
ing with crime in rest areas are clearing
shrubs from rest-room windows to keep
the parking lot visible and training custo
dians to be alert to signs of criminal behav
ior, I can only remember the time at a rest
stop bathroom in Kansas this past Septem
ber when the relentless stare of a man's
eyes made me literally fear for my life.
There were times when I wanted to pull
off the road and walk a little ways into the
desert, but I didn't; times when I wanted
to spend the night in a motel in the middle
of nowhere, and didn't.
The time spent watching the car from
our table in a restaurant, or wondering if
the trucker at the gas station didn't like
waiting in line for the diesel fuel behind
two young college boys
Fear seems to be growing like a cancer
these days.
