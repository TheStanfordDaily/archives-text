'Aurora' staffer expresses concern over G-Spot's role

I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR
from the outset that I am not criticiz
ing the prospect of the new feminist
magazine, G-Spot, on campus, nor its
goals. As a member of both the Aurora
and Critical Bitch collectives, I know the
need for a feminist voice on campus. I
look forward to the success of the new
magazine.
I was, however, deeply angered and
disappointed with the tone of the editorial
on Nov. 10 and the references to both
Aurora and Critical Bitch. It seemed writ
ten out of ignorance and a complete

inability to engage with what both maga
zines had to offer. If this is what passes as
broad-based feminism on this campus,
than I am very glad to have my degree
and be on my way.
Has the editorial board ever looked
past the Aurora and Critical Bitch mast
heads? Did it ever speak to members of
the collectives? Can editorial board mem
bers, in all honesty, say that our goal was
to offend and alienate people? Would it
perhaps be more intelligent to consider
the goal of these magazines as creating a
space where women did not have to edit

or erase their voices in any way without
worrying about catering to anyone, male
or female, who might not agree?
I certainly do not believe that these
experiments were entirely successful.
However, I know we did create a valid and
necessary space on this campus.
It is essential to the survival of any
movement, that its radical voice not be
silenced in order to accommodate and
appease. The point is that women have
been accommodating everyone for a very
long time at their own expense. For
myself, one of the major goals of Aurora

and Critical Bitch was to resist these
accommodations and appeasements.
I speak for myself, not the collective.
This also should be very clear. And while
the evolution of Aurora and Critical Bitch
were often due to constructive and truly
interested criticism, I did not find the edi
torial to be either. I hope the editorial
board will reconsider its belief that it has
the right to tell women how to express
their anger.
Again best wishes to G-Spot.
