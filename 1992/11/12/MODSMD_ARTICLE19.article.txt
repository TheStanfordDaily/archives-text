# Asian students object to campus show: 'Mikad'
## 
### 
This weekend on campus, the Stanford
Savoyards will perform Gilbert and Sulli
van's "The Mikado," a 19th century
operetta caricaturing imperialistic Japan.
While we recognize the enduring popular
ity of the work, we're afraid audiences
will come away with more than just a few
laughs.
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders
at several colleges have taken offense at the
decision of theater groups to continue pre
senting the operetta. Let us make it clear
that we don't want to stifle artistic free
dom, but would like to voice our concern
that the performance perpetuates demean
ing stereotypes about Asian Americans.
In 1990, when "The Mikado" was
brought to Pomona College, it sparked
protests by the students and faculty mem
bers. History professor Sam Yamashita
explained that his objections were based
on the portrayals of "submissive . ..
mindless" females, the use of racist lan
guage and the presence of non-Asian
actors in "yellowface" with exaggerated
and distorted features.
All but one of the characters' names —
Titipu, Yum-Yum and Nanki-Poo — and

nearly all of the "foreign" words are
merely nonsensical pseudo-Japanese
sounds. The dialogue is no better. The
opening song begins:
"If you want to know who we are/ We
are gentleman of Japan/ On many a vase
and jar/ On many a screen and fan/ We
figure in lively paints/ Our attitudes
queers and quaint/ You're wrong if you
think it ain't, oh!"
The operetta ridicules Japanese atti
tudes and customs — "abject grovel in a
characteristic Japanese attitude," — and
belittles female characters — a male calls
the female lead "that little parcel."
Anti-Japanese sentiment in the U.S. is
at its highest point since World War 11.
Furthermore, the U.S. Department of
Justice has reported that violence against
Asian Americans is a major problem that
continues to worsen. In light of this, we
believe performances such as "The Mika
do" can only fuel existing misunderstand
ings of and resentment towards the coun
try's fastest-growing ethnic group.
We're not condemning those who are
putting on the operetta or those who are
planning to attend it. We hope that the
Stanford community will be aware of the
operetta's potential impact on already
strained race relations.
