# Conservative speaker blasts liberals

### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
Conservative commentator R. Emmett
Tyrrell discussed, criticized and joked
about American politics last night, praising
the Reagan era and forecasting a disastrous
Clinton administration during a talk at the
Hoover Institution titled "A Post-Election
View of the American Political Scene."
Tyrrell, the founder of the conserva
tive monthly magazine The American
Spectator, spoke to a crowd of about 90
people, mostly faculty and staff, and an
swered questions for a half hour.
The talk centered on what Tyrrell calls
the "conservative crackup" — the recent
end to the conservative period in America
— which he said gave President-elect Bill
Clinton the White House.
He said he feels Ronald Reagan was
the greatest president since Franklin D.
Roosevelt, but that he failed to make a
permanent mark on American politics.
"It is a very great president who can

change the direction of American policy
in two areas — foreign policy and domes
tic policy," Tyrrell said. "[However], he
failed to change or even influence the po
litical culture of this country. I thought
he'd know . . . politics is also decided in
culture."
He added, "At the end of the Ronald
Reagan presidency, I think the culture
was more I opposed ] to conservatism than
it was at the outset."
Tyrrell said liberals have yet to see the
success and prosperity of the 1980s.
"They insisted on misunderstanding the
1980s," he said.
He continuously criticized Clinton,
whom he referred to as "Boy Clinton,"
throughout the evening, warning that the
new president will destroy the American
economy.
"He learned absolutely nothing from
the 1980s, and my conviction is that he'll
bring us back to 1979 very soon," he said.
Tyrrell also criticized George Bush
and said he didn't follow the same type of

conservatism that Reagan did.
"In 1992, [Bush] lost it,"he said. "His
kind of conservatism was defeated — a
conservatism with no ideas, no fire."
Tyrrell also discussed his feelings on
the fundamental differences between
conservatives and liberals.
Conservatives' biggest problem is
their temper, and once this is controlled
they will regain control of American poli
tics in coming years, he predicted.
Tyrrell called liberals "political
nymphomaniacs" and said by paying at
tention to so many special interests, they
have destroyed their cohesiveness. "They
politicize everything in sight," he said.
He refers to this as the "liberal crack
up," a process that began in the 1970s
and gave Ronald Reagan the White
House.
"It wasn't that Ronald Reagan won
the presidency in 1980 but that the liber
als and Jimmy Carter lost [it]," he said.
"Their fundamental goal is social disinte
gration and it's going to start with them."
