# No objection to same-sex and unmarried relations
## 
### 
I have no animus against homosexuals
or unmarried couples. I was referring to
the obvious fact that marriage has
throughout history been aimed primarily
at the production and raising of children.
The family has been an extremely
effective structure in this regard. It is a
cross of two polarities, male-female and
parent-child. It holds up for much the
same reason as a house, it is normally
four-cornered. And, of course, it takes
the male-female pair to procreate. Later
in life, the child profits by the comple
mentary temperaments which extend
the biological.
As for the standard marriage contract,
that is the way we show we mean it for
the duration of upbringing. Granted,
there are exceptions, and I am sure there
are unmarried couples who are good par
ents and homosexuals likewise. Converse
ly, it is clear that not all marriages are
ideal for the children. But society has to
proceed by norms, applying to most cases.
For example, it is possible that an inces
tuous couple, say a mother and son, could
raise their child creditably. But patently
society cannot allow that. It is too unsound

structurally and would mess up our sense
of direction, as well as weaken genes.
Similarly, child-labor laws cannot make
exception for the occasional big tough kid
who could work better than his father.
Laws excluding women from combat can't
blink at the rare Amazonian. Of course
there have always been ways around such
laws, if people are eager enough.
There have to be rules, limits, as the
late Camus discovered (He began as an
all-out "absurdist," until he witnessed
the Holocaust).
My own sense of that began, not with
the Dark Ages, but with my mother, 71
years ago. Her sense went all the way
back to the Ten Commandments to which
I added the Sermon on the Mount. That is
what I refer to as "the basic moral fabric."
If it is not "intolerant" to balk at
murder or incest, why is it tolerant for a
society like ours to frame its legislation
in a way that strengthens its fundamen
tal structures, rather than weakening
them?
Our tax code favors the traditional
family and does so increasingly because
of our demographic setbacks. Fortunate
ly, there are still enough of us around
who take the long view of such matters.
Campuses are something else.
