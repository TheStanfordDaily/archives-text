## Cardinal soccer future in good hands with goalies 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Soccer goalkeepers are a differ
ent breed from field players, and
it's not just because they wear
mismatched jerseys and shorts.
According to junior Leslie Gar
rard and senior team captain
Chris Massell, who have split
keeper duties for the Cardinal
this season, there's a distinct
mentality involved in goalkeep
>ng;
"It's a unique position for
unique people," said Massell, who
has started the last three games
for the No. 4 Stanford squad. "I
don't think you can really under
stand it, unless you've played it.
You can teach someone as many
technical skills as you want, but if
you don't have the killer instinct
to put it all on the line, it won't
get you anywhere."
One of the unique aspects of
the position is that there is only
one starting spot. The Cardinal
often plays a combination of two

forwards, five midfielders and
three fullbacks, but there can be
only one person in goal.
At the beginning of the season,
that person was Garrard. The
junior started all of last year and
notched 56 saves while compiling
a .78 goals-against average in 16
games this season. However, she
was replaced at halftime during
the San Diego State game by Mas
sell, who has played backup the
last three years.
Since coach Berhane Andeber
han often substitutes players in,
Garrard had no idea that her
starting position was in jeopardy.
"When I came out of the game,
I didn't feel like Berhane was
benching me, because he didn't say
anything to me during halftime or
after the game. Then I read the
paper and all of a sudden my start
ing position is questioned and then
I'm not starting three games.
"I don't mind what he did as
much as the method he used. I
was crushed. It seemed like he
was benching me to prove a

point."
After the Aztec game, Andeber
han said he was planning on start
ing whoever was playing better
and, after Massell had a good
game, he decided to reward her for
it. Garrard recognized that her
teammate earned a shot at start
ing, which helped the junior adjust
to spending time on the bench.
"That's actually the reason I'm
not that bitter anymore," Garrard
said. "I was wallowing in self-pity
and all of a sudden I realized that
there are other people who don't
play. Chris has done so much for
this team and she deserves it.
"How much of a difference will
it make in my life if I don't play in
a game and we still win?" she
added. "I'm like, 'Put your ego to
the side and get the job done.'"
Although there could have
been tension between Garrard
and Massell after the switch, they
have stayed good friends. At prac
tice, along with third-string goalie
Jennifer Poehler, they just focus
on what it takes to make them
better keepers.
Which usually means that
while field players do passing
drills, the goalies repeatedly
throw their bodies to the turf.
"Berhane thinks we're crazy,"
Massell said. "One of our old
coaches called us 'funny people."'
And when field players try
their skills in goal, they get the
same way. "They joke around at
practice and try to do things in
goal," Massell said. "(Julie) Foudy
gets in there and she's hilarious.
They all just go crazy."
But an opponent bearing down
on you in a real game is no joke. In
the heat of a match, all hell breaks
loose and a split-second decision
by the goalie may determine the
outcome of the game.
"I'll see a player dribbling
down the sideline on a breakaway
and she's coming straight at me,"
Garrard said. "I'm sitting there
saying, 'Why the hell am I doing
this?"'
Garrard and Massell are both
adept at foiling breakaways, but
they often have to pay a price for
the save.
"You can't even see the ball
after it's shot and you throw
yourself down," Garrard said.
"All of a sudden the ball hits off
your face, the forward's foot is in
your stomach and they're trip
ping over your legs. They're run
ning their cleats down your back
and you don't feel a thing. But as
soon as the ball goes out of
bounds you realize, 'Oh my God.
I'm in pain."'
But it's making that save
which makes the whole game
worthwhile, according to both
keepers.
"It's when you get set and the
person's taking a shot," said Gar
rard of what she likes most about

playing in goal. "It's just this com
plete rush of energy and it goes
through your entire body. It's
flowing and flowing and then you
dive for the ball. Most of the times
you save it, but it's a battle with
yourself as much as the other
team."
Massell points to a specific save
which motivates her. In the last
regular season game of 1991, she
was put in the Northern Colorado
match after the Cardinal had all
hut clinched the victory.
Just 30 seconds after going in,
Massell faced one of the forwards
on a breakaway. The attacker
shot to the upper left of the net
but Massell made a leaping save
to preserve the shutout.
"That second I realized why I
was playing," she said."lt all came
back to me — why I put in the
time and why I wanted the team
to win. Just that one save. I some
times wonder if I hadn't gone in,
whether I'd still be so passionate
about the whole thing."

But Massell hasn't lost her
passion for the game or her voice
for it. One difference between her
style and Garrard's is that she is
extremely vocal on the field. As
Garrard joked, "Chris is a blab."
And while Garrard has worked
on becoming a better communica
tor in the past year, she still con
siders her shot-blocking skills to
be her strength.
"Chris would say I'm dramat
ic," Garrard said. "Even if you're
having a bad day, the goal is to
show the other team you're confi
dent and in control. Whether
that's the visage I manifest or
not, I don't know."
Despite their different approach
es to the game, both of them agree
that they would hate to face their
teammates in an actual match. But
they enjoy pitting their skills
against the Stanford attackers in
practice. Massell rates Julie Foudy
as the best technical shooter and
Sarah Rafanelli as the least pre
dictable.

But in terms of sheer force,
they both agree that freshman
Jessica Fischer is the most fear
some Cardinal kicker. According
to Massell, Fischer's shots could
break a keeper's hands and Gar
rard's description of a blast from
the sweeper was just as graphic. ,
"If you have Jessica shooting
five yards away from you, turn
around and run off the field as
fast as you can," she said. "You
know some part of your body is
going to end up with the ball in
the goal."
But blocking her teammates'
shots is the best preparation for a
real game, said Garrard. "If you
can save Foudy's shot, chances
are you can save some measly
Santa Clara player's shot."
The Cardinal will find out if
that is true on Sunday when it
meets the Broncos in an NCAA
quarterfinal match, when Ande
berhan will have to once again
decide whether to start Massell or
Garrard.
