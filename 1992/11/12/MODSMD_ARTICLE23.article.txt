# Sailors face stormy seas in Pacific coast regattas
## 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
The Stanford sailors will go head to
head against 17 other teams in the most
important regatta of the fall season this
weekend at Lake Cachuma in the
North/South Intersectional.
The southern California regatta is con
sidered by most teams as the fall season
championship and pits the strongest colle
giate teams on the Pacific coast against
each other in competition.
"It's one of our biggest team goals for
the year," said coach Blake Middleton.
"The competition is tops but we have the
the capability to win."
But Stanford must do something it
hasn't done in at least five years; get over
the second-place blues and beat UC-Irvine
for the top spot. Possibilities for that are
strong, according to Middleton.
"This year there's no clear favorite like
there has been in the past. Hawaii, UC-
Irvine, California and Stanford all have
real potential to win, with USC as a dark
horse," he said.
The format of the regatta makes the
team optimistic. In the first and second
divisions each school has two crews sailing
Flying Juniors (two-person boats). In the
third and fourth division, each school has
two single-handed racers sailing leasers
(one-person boats). It's a format that
places high importance on team depth and
strength in each division.
"It won't be a surprise to us or any one
if we win. We have the strength, speed and
team depth. We just have to bring it all
together this weekend," said senior cap
tain Rusty Lhamon.
Manning the Flying Juniors for Stanford
will be senior captain John Emory with
crewmate Michele St. Martin and junior
Scott Sellers with crewmate Britt Johnson.
Sophomore Charles Meade and junior Jere

my Mclntyre will man the Lasers.
This weekend's final rankings have
added importance because they determine
the order in which teams can choose
spring season intersectionals, and which
teams get the chance to compete against
the best squads from the east coast.
Middleton said the team would choose
to go to the Navy Spring Regatta because
it would best prepare the team for nation
al competition. But a loss this weekend
might preclude that choice.
With Hawaii, ranked fifth by Sailing
World Magazine, and UCI, ranked 10th
and climbing, both entered in the competi
tion, the seventh-ranked Cardinal will
have to sail their best to win.
Middleton said he expects the sailors
to be well-focused for the regatta, espe
cially after finishing third in a disap
pointing loss to USC and Cal, in what
should have been an easy win last week
end in the Stanford Invitationals in Red
wood city.
"If we had cruised to an easy victory
like we were expected to, we probably
wouldn't be focused, and would probably
be beaten this weekend. The fact that we
lost may actually bring the team togeth
er," he said.
In spite of a poor overall team perfor
mance, Cardinal sailors still turned in
some good performances.
Mclntyre and senior crewmate Molly
McClain took first place in their division.
Meade and crewmate sophomore Mary
Kussmaul took second, while freshman
(Iretchen Uznis and crewmate junior
Jeremy Hinman took fifth.
In the second division, senior Leo
Sommaripa and crewmate sophomore Liz
Clabaugh turned in their best finish this
season at fourth place, to lead the Cardi
nal team in their division. They finished
in the top four in half their races and in
the top 10 in all but one.
