# The 						naked truth of athletes exposed
## 
### 
I wish I had a body like J.J. Lasley.
Without the penis.
When I saw J.J. Lasley's nude body in
the sports section Friday my first reac
tion wasn't to comment on what a sexy
body he had and run to the phone to call
him up to test the strength of my ultra
high loft.
I saw a cool picture of a naked athlete
with the physique shaped by the hours
of practice needed to gain a position on
the football team. He may have seemed a
little arrogant just for taking such a cool
photo and having the. .. genitalia. . . to
show himself oft in front of God and
everybody.
But I didn't think about pornogra
phy, sex or feel any hormonal overload.
I didn't bike over to Cowell to get a
birth control prescription over it.
Maybe the electric shock treatment is
paying off.
I mean, not to say that I was totally
blase about the whole thing. J.J. Lasley
seems like a stud to me. I'd like to play
quarters with him at the Co Ho. I'd like
to talk to him about body-piercing while
doing laundry in the Stern basement.
But I wouldn't talk to him while looking
below his waist to see why he held his
helmet so low.
Call me crazy.
And I would be genuinely impressed
to see a woman do the same in our sports
pages. It seems unlikely, or a little less
feasible, but it could be done. But it
wouldn't be a Summer Sanders-slink
ing-on-the-pool-deck-at-deGuerre photo
a la Sports Illustrated.
It would be Sanders with her back
facing the camera, no top on to empha
size the muscles in her back as she
flexed. It wouldn't be about sexy. Sexy
would be a side product, but it would be
foremost about athletics. You'd see a
well-defined back that talked of miles of
laps swum at hours when the rest of
campus is still drooling on their pillows.
I agree, if you tried to have a woman
athlete cover herself up and appeal to the
mainstream "cute" standards — where

women wear coconut-flavored Bonne
Bell lip gloss, shave their bikini lines
between avocado-mud masques and talk
to their spouses about pH-balanced
deodorant — it would be degrading.
But if you got Kristi Paaso to hold up
her volleyball jersey so she wasn't expos
ing anything that would make your
mother embarrassed, you wouldn't see a
coy female.

If she were standing just like J.J.
Lasley, you'd see how muscular she was.
You'd see biceps that could spike a ball
down your throat. You'd see legs that
could jump higher than any man who
plays IM basketball.
I have to admit, sex would get tied
into it. Maybe it's because we're going to
Stanford, and we've all been chewing ice
and going to those massage workshops
when we should have been having sex.
Maybe it's the post-teen years and the
fact that the Safer Sex Shoppe sells
things soooo inexpensively.
But I still contend your first impres
sion would be of an athlete The trouble
comes in when you start looking at a
muscular body and get that hot-and
bothered feeling like when you had a
crush on your CIV section leader.
Athletics is athletics, and the fact that
male sexuality is tied to strength is an
unfortunate circumstance. I guess a pow
erful woman is too intimidating to be sexy.
Aren't muscles "beautiful"? Are men
only attracted to pictures of birdlike lit
tle model figures that most women
would run down on their bikes in White
Plaza if given the chance?

Would it be to protect the woman
from the scrutiny of some quasi-human
sexist who lets his fingers do the walk
ing, who'd come out and say she looked
masculine?
Unfortunately, athletics isn't about
those qualities which society has deemed
feminine. Feminine is baking cookies for
your 28 children and making TV dinners
for some slob husband. A woman's place
is in the oven.
Don't make me vomit. Women ath
letes at Stanford lift weights. They work
their butts off. They sweat. And they
aren't always nice and pleasant when
they do it.
Unfortunately, you can't really play
basketball in those god-damned Easy
Spirit high heels, and athletics, for both
sexes, is about being strong, fit and com
petitive. If women are supposed to be
grinning little acquiescent housemaids
that run around in fishnet tights polish
ing male egos all day, then men should
consider finding some sheep looking for
meaningful relationships.
I'd rather meet a woman who could
bench press me than one who was wor
ried if her panty lines showed through
her suede skirt. I guess that's un-Amer
ican.
And I'm not some neo-fascist male
beater. I don't disagree with the swim
suit issue idea. . . just with having it in
Sports Illustrated, the only publication
that treats men and women as equals
based on athletic achievement. It doesn't
put respectable athletes in swimsuits, it
puts faces, hips and chests the size of
Cleveland in swimsuits. It's just the
wrong forum.
So I would love to see a woman pose
naked for The Daily. I'd like to see some
one with the guts to do it. It wouldn't be
Playboy material. It wouldn't be glam
orous. It would be extraordinary.
