# Cardinal faces rough preseason
## Battered basketball squad looks to fill Keefe's shoes 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
With one week to go before the first exhibition
game, the Stanford basketball roster has become
that much leaner.
Coach Mike Montgomery announced Tuesday
that reserve guard David Harbour will be lost for the
season due to an iryured right thumb from a sum
mer water-skiing accident. He will practice with the
team until December before undergoing surgery so
that he will be able to practice at full strength with
the team in the spring.
This comes after last week's announcement that
Jim Morgan, who was to be the Cardinal's starting
center, has a herniated disk in his back and will be
out between one and three months.
In addition, swingman Andy Poppink has been
experiencing lower back problems and has been
practicing on a limited basis. However, his status for
the exhibition against the Blue and Gold Fleet next
Thursday is probable.
The Cardinal now has only four big men practic
ing daily: Jason Weaver, Todd Manley, Bart Lam
mersen and Darren Alloway. "We have players hav
ing to play that shouldn't have to be ready yet,"
coach Mike Montgomery said. "Guys that were
going to be brought along slowly are now going to
have to play and produce."
Even more responsibility lies with the Cardinal's
three returning starters, guards Marcus Lollie and
Peter Dukes, and forward Brent Williams, because
of the losses.
"Marcus is going to have to step up his game in
terms of numbers — scoring the ball," Montgomery
said. "The flip side of that is he has to create oppor
tunities for others, and increase his assists-to
turnovers ratio."
Stanford's focus has shifted toward the outside,
with all three veterans expected to bomb away. "I
think you'll see more three-point attempts," Mont
gomery said. "Pete is very comfortable with the

three, Marcus has gotten more comfortable, and
Brent has extended his range. We're telling our
shooters to be conscious of the line. I think you'll see
more threes by necessity." Montgomery noted that
the three-pointer could even be a frequent option in
the transition game.
A big obstacle Cardinal perimeter players will
have to overcome is their current hesitancy to throw
the ball inside to the post. There is no longer an
Adam Keefe down low to receive a feed for an auto
matic two points. Montgomery has termed the new
approach for this year as "Advantage-Disadvan
tage."
"In the past, our first priority was to look for the
post, then for your shot," Montgomery said. "This
year, we're telling our perimeter guys to look for
your shot, but don't forget the post.
"We're also telling our post guys that just
because they get it down there, they don't have to
shoot; if they get a double-team, kick it out and we'll
reset."
Montgomery expects the young post players to
make mistakes early on, but those mistakes will only
help them get better. "They're going to have to learn
under fire," he said.
The lack of exposure the current frontline players
have received, though, could work to Stanford's
advantage, according to Montgomery.
"One of the things we're aware of is that there
won't be tight coverage on the post," Montgomery
said.
"Our post-guys have to learn how to slow down
and put it down (on the floor), because they'll be able
to score. It's a tremendous advantage because other
teams will say 'Don't leave Dukes."'
Despite the trimmed roster, Montgomery thinks
Stanford still has enough talent to finish in the
upper half of the Pacific 10 Conference.
"We need to block out on the boards, pick up the
loose balls — all the little things that good teams do
well we'll have to put a premium on if we want to
win. But we think we can compete."

Junior forward Brent Williams looks for the open lane against USC last season. He is one of three play
ers Stanford will look to as leaders of its injury-plagued basketball squad as it heads into its upcoming
exhibition matches.
