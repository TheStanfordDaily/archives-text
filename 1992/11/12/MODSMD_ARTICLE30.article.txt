An article in yesterday's
Daily, "Taxol treatment
fails, cheerleader dies at
Hospital," contained mis
leading information about
the role Taxol played in the
25-year-old woman's death.
The woman had suffered
from Hodgkin's Disease for
many years, and had only
recently started receiving
taxol treatment. She had not
yet received her third cycle
of therapy, according to
Assoc. Oncology Prof. Bran
imir I Sikic, and there was
evidence that her Hodgkin's
disease was going into
remission. Her death,
caused by Toxic Shock Syn
drome, resulted from strep
pneumonia — to which she
was predisposed because of a
prior splenectomy and the
immune system suppression
associated with advanced
Hodgkins disease.
