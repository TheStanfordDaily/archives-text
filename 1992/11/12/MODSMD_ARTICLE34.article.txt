Airborne thriller
takes off despite
turbulent scenes

Passenger 57

Film companies have an annoying habit of
clearing mediocre action flicks for landing.
Though Warner Brothers' "Die Hard"-
meets-"Shaft" thriller, "Passenger 57," is as
ridiculously flawed as any other machismo
driven-goodie-goodie-pummels-the
naughty-naughty cinematic scenario re
leased this year, it manages to avoid crashing
short of the entertaining runway.
Charles Rane (Bruce Payne), an interna
tional terrorist with a pension for jumbo
jets, has finally been captured by the FBI. In
stead of transferring him by train or bus to
his California hearing, the Feds opt to fly the
friendly, unsuspecting skies.

While "Passenger 57" is
no genre classic, it
clears the meat-headed
flop fence.

Fortunately, airline security specialist
John Cutter (Wesley Snipes), is on board the
doomed flight — in the lavatory — when
Rane's gun-toting saviors mysteriously pop
out of the paneling. What follows is a pre
posterous ride on the wild side.
Plagued with artistic and technical con
tradictions, "Passenger 57" is a difficult film
to judge. While "Passenger 57" it's no genre
classic, it clears the meat-headed flop fence.
The construction of Dan Gordon's and
David Loughery's screenplay is problematic
in its attempt to establish a two-sides-of-the
same-coin parallel between Cutter and
Rane. The characters' poor development
gives viewers few reasons to connect with ei
ther character emotionally. Hence, learning
that Cutter helplessly watched his wife's
murder or that Rane was abused as a child

does little more than whet the appetite.
Then there's director Hooks' poor atten
tion to detail. Expecting a rational audience
to believe that Rane is physically capable of
sprinting from a well-armed SWAT unit,
after jumping through a third floor window
— wearing only hospital blues and footies —
is insulting to say the least.
Similarly, while the film's combat se
quences engage viewer interest, they lack the
realism of even subdued thrillers like "Blade
Runner" or "Cape Fear." Despite the reality
eight years of martial arts training should
have given him, Snipes ends most of his se
quences James Bond-style — unbruised, un
soiled and with leading lady, Marti (Alex
Datcher), in hand.
Despite the film's clumsiness, Snipes and
Payne deliver intriguing performances.
Snipes' urban sensibilities invigorate the
heroic formula role made so popular by the
Bruce Willlises and Mel Gibsons of tinsel
town. In fact, his "Head-Nigger-In-Charge"
attitude hasn't been seen since the Blax
ploitation flicks of the '70s.
Payne as the cliched diabolic genius
shines brightly as well — sometimes even
brighter than Snipes. Together, the two
dominate the screen.
"Passenger 57" is reasonably successful
because it presents an intelligent black man
in an uncompromising and heroic role. Yet
Hooks' sloppy handling of the "Die Hard"-
esque action-thriller, suggests he'd do well to
book low-stress flights in the future.

Culture clash on
a remote steppe
makes for poetry

Close to Eden

Condoms and TV sets meet dragonflies
and fields of grass in "Close to Eden," a
movie that pits modern civilization against
the steppes of outer Mongolia.
Almost surreal in style, the movie fol
lows Gombo (Bayarteu), the father of a tra
ditional Mongolian family, from his shel
tered family life to the bustling city and
back. The inevitable impact of modern cul
ture on this remote region of the world is
accelerated by the chance arrival of Sergei
(Vladimir Gostukhin), a stranded truck
driver.
Before Sergei arrives, the dynamics of
the family are depicted as beautiful. Gombo
and his young son, Bouin, share a tender
moment admiring the red nose of a drag
onfly until a toy from town catches his at
tention.
The mother's serene concern for her
family is equally touching, especially when
she wordlessly reassures her frightened son
that his father will soon return from his ex
tended adventure in town.

The manner in which Sergei copes with
his unforeseen adventures is one of the
most interesting elements of the film. Din
ner preparations initiate him abruptly into
the ways of Mongolian life. He can't help
but turn away as they proudly skin a sheep
in his honor.
Lost in no-man's-land, Sergei clings to
his identity as a Russian war veteran. In a
night club in the city, he insists on singing
the Russian national anthem while the
band plays the tune tattooed to his back.
When Gombo returns, the television he
brings home becomes the central focus of
the action. When Gombo starts to imagine
his wife on the TV screen, the Sony symbol
of technology seems to have become his re
ality.
The scenes in the steppe and the city
seem like two different movies united only
by the constant presence of Gombo. To
wards the end of the dizzying scenes in the
city, you wish he'd return to the peaceful
steppes.
But the mysteries of the movie are at
once its strength and its weakness. Loaded
with unconventional symbols, "Close to
Eden" is like good poetry. It explores sensi
tive issues in simple language without an
swering any questions.

If only Stanford
profs would tell
their life stories

Waterland

"What is the point? The world's going to
end." High school teacher Tom Crick (Jere
my Irons) becomes deeply unnerved when
renegade student Matthew Price (Ethan
Hawke) asks him this question during a his
tory lesson.
In response to the question, in an attempt
to explain to his class the personal relevance
of history, Crick ends up relaying his own
life story.
"Waterland," based on the book by Gra
ham Swift, follows Crick as he pieces togeth
er the poignant events of his life while he
comes to understand his problems in his
marriage and career.
As Crick tells his story, the film flashes
backs to his pre-World War II adolescence in
the Fens, an area in Northern England
where he lived with his father and retarded
brother. There, he also developed a relation
ship with Mary (Lena Heady), whom he
married.
Windmills, wheatfields and starry nights
that seem like a Van Gogh painting, mixed
with indoor shots reminiscent of a Norman
Rockwell scenario, typify the cinematogra
phy.
Sinead Cusack, who is also Jeremy Irons'
wife, gives a touching performance as the
adult Mary who is on the verge of madness
from the hardships she and Tom endured as
youths, specifically a horrific backstreet
abortion which left her unable to bear chil
dren. Though vulnerable, she maintains a
hard edge.
And Irons delivers an intense portrayal of
Crick, maintaining a desperate tension
