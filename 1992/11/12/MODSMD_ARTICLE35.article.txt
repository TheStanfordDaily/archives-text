Looks' lacking:
Obnoxious rebel
lyrics don't cut it

Pop Will Eat Itself

Fop Will Eat Itself is a band that desper
ately wants to be known as bad boys. But on
their latest release, "The Looks or the
Lifestyle," their attempts at an in-your-face
attitude make them seem more sophomoric
than truly obnoxious.
Their lyrics like "Bad trip? Tough shit!
That's what you get when you think with
your dick," from "Token Drug Song," come
off as stupid and immature.
The band's strength lies in its music
which relies on a dance beat to keep the
songs going.
Neither of the two singers, Clint Mansell

nor Graham Crabb, has a compelling voice.
Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails conveys more
anger and anguish than these two can muster.
If nothing else, "The Looks or the
Lifestyle" manages to come up with a couple
of interesting song titles like "Token Drug
Song" and"I Was a Teenage Grandad." Also,
any band that names a song after actor Harry
Dean Stanton can't be all that bad.

Despite their efforts to be obnoxious, the
only reaction Pop Will Eat Itself elicits is in
difference. Maybe they need to wash their
mouths out with soap. On second thought,
they should keep the bar of soap in their
mouths and concentrate on their music.
Then, perhaps, they'll find the success that's
been eluding them.

They've lost the
faith and turned
into bad posers

Bon Jovi

Bon Jovi is back. And they're more insipid
than ever.
What was once a slightly annoying group
of Jersey kids pumping out amusing bubble
gum-rock albums, has become an indistin
guishable band of self important, second
rate musicians.
After two years of mildly successful solo ef
forts, Bon Jovi's fifth album, "Keep the Faith,"
doesn't hold a post-concert lighter to their
previous efforts. Moral: Goofy, teenage '80s
artists don't age well unless they're Madonna.
There are already too many rock ballads
that sound like "Bed of Roses" and too many
songs with names like "1 Believer "1 Want
You" and "Keep the Faith."
The lack of creativity becomes even more
evident musically. Instead of the Bon Jovi of
"Runaway" or "Wanted Dead or Alive," the
album offers a chameleon-like cover band.
On one song they try to sound like U2. On
another they do a bad Stones impression.
They even try out Def Leppard and Extreme
— while the keyboardist does his best to imi
tate old Rod Stewart songs.
Guitarist Richie Sambora, who put out a
passably good solo album last year, is forced
into compromising roles, and any bit of orig
inality he displays comes off as forced.
Jon Bon Jovi cut his hair, grew some side
burns and bought an LA.-looking pair of
shades. But in doing so, he lost whatever slight
ly likeable, campy Jersey edge he had. Instead,
he poses — precisely as he does on an inside
photo — as the crucified, soul-searching artist.
Nobody's going to buy it.

They're back. Bon Jovi band members David Bryan, Tico Torres, Alec Jon Such, Jon
Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora make a feeble and failed attempt to recapture their once
hopelessly-devoted fans with "Keep the Faith."
