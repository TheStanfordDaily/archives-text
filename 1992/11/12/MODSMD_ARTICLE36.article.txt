# Woolf lives again in 'A Room of One's Own'
## 
### Peter Edmonston Staff writer 
When Miranda Hope strides onto the
Nitery stage in a felt hat clutching a pile of
books, the audience of "A Room of One's
Own" will witness the product of diligent re
search that has sent Hope from the quadran
gles of Cambridge University to the banks of
the Thames to Russell Square in Bloomsbury.
In this demanding one-woman show,
Hope, as Virginia Woolf, recreates a lecture,
entitled "Women and Fiction," that Woolf
delivered 60 years ago to a small group of
college women at Cambridge. In the course
of the 75-minute monologue, Woolf's com
pelling text reveals harsh truths about the
history of gender roles with wit, irony and
haunting imagery.
Hope and her director, Richard Schoch,
have been working for months to recreate
the historic lecture on the stage of the Nitery
Theatre. Because of the minimal set — a
desk, a chair and piles of books — Schoch
explained that most of their energies were
devoted to character work.
Schoch, a Drama Department graduate
student, chose Hope for the role in February,
after she completed one of his classes. "She is
probably the most talented undergraduate
actress I've seen here," he said.
Hope, who was also taking a Virginia
Woolf seminar class at the time eagerly ac
cepted the offer. Since then the project has
evolved into an undergraduate research pro
ject and an Honors thesis on Virginia Woolf.
In "A Room of One's Own", Woolf ex
plains that in order to be an artist, a woman
requires "500 pounds and a room of her
own." Hope used the same argument to per
suade the Undergraduate Research Oppor
tunities board to grant her funds for her
artistic undertaking.
With the grant, Hope traveled through
Britain and studied the background of Vir
ginia Woolf's life. Last summer she visited
Girton College at Cambridge University,
where Woolf originally delivered the lecture
which forms the text of "A Room of One's
Own." There, she saw the "gallant red brick
and wild unkempt grasses of the garden"
that Woolf evokes in the play.
Recalling her first look at one of Woolf's
original manuscripts, Hope said, "There
didn't seem to be much difference between
the yellowed pages of 'Mrs. Dalloway' and
the stretched skin of some ancient, sand

dried specimen of a prehistoric woman up
stairs."
As Hope walked around Bloomsbury,
Woolf's familiar haunt, the only visible sign
of her legacy was a "Virginia Woolf Bar and
Grill." When Hope ventured inside, the host
admitted he had no idea who Woolf was.
In addition to traveling through Britain,
Hope engaged in an in-depth study of
British culture. Under the instruction of a
British vocal coach, she learned the pronun
ciation and inflections of a British, upper
class woman. Through a chance conversa
tion with a dean at the High Table at
Brasenose College in Oxford, Hope received
a quick lesson in the protocol of polite
British dinner talk.

Hope's role also required the memorizing
of 30 pages of text. "I could do three pages a
day, but only every five or six days," she re
called. Hope treats Woolf's words with the
utmost respect; every article and pronoun
must be correct before she considers a sec
tion memorized.
But towards the end of the summer,
Schoch told her he wanted to cut the last five
pages. "It was devastating," Hope said. "It
was then that I realized that I was already
emotionally attached to the text."
Hope said her relationship with her direc
tor is one of immense mutual respect. Hope
feared that upon returning from her months
of travels, she would find that Schoch's image
of Woolf might differ from her own. She said,

however, that her fears were unfounded;
through innumerable hours of rehearsal,
Schoch and Hope have come to agree on al
most every aspect of Woolf's portrayal.
"It's like being married to a total
stranger," Schoch said of his working rela
tionship with Hope. Six days a week, he and
Hope rehearse for at least three hours, not
including extra meetings for photo shoots,
technical rehearsals and costume fittings.
Some members of the Drama Depart
ment expressed concern over a "woman's
show" being directed by a man. To these
doubts, Schoch responds, "Anyone who sug
gests that a man cannot direct a piece about
Virginia Woolf has not read enough Virginia
Woolf."
He points out that in "A Room of One's
Own," Woolf herself argues that one must be
"man-womanly and woman-manly." Her es
pousal of androgyny, which makes Woolf a
contentious figure among modern femi
nists, seems consistent with the male and fe
male collaboration on this production.
Much of Schoch's role as a director is to
make Hope aware of when she is closest to
their vision of Woolf. He is constantly work
ing to "strip away Miranda's colloquial im
pulses," in order to make room for Woolf's.
"Miranda has a tendency to use her head
and shoulders," he said of Hope's gestures,
"whereas Virginia would use her hips and
feet more."
Hope agrees that as herself, she is far more
sarcastic than Woolf ever would have been.
She describes how Schoch yells out during
rehearsal whenever she unknowingly curls
her lips into her instinctive sneer.
For Hope, each new discovery in rehearsal
— a new way to hold her pen, a different way
to cross the stage, another word to empha
size — is a step towards bringing Woolf's
words back to life.
Hope insists that Woolf's words and im
ages should have the same immediacy to a
Stanford audience as they had for the eager
young women of Girton College. "That is the
struggle of every artist," she says, "to get be
yond one's own experiences and start talking
about the world."

"A Room of One's Own" will be shown in the
Nitery Theater, Nov. 11-14 at Bp.m., and No
vember 15 at 2 p.m. Tickets are 55 for students
and seniors, $9 for others and are available at
Tresidder Ticket Office or at the door one hour
before the show.
