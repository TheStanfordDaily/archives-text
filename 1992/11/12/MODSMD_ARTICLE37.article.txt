# A 						twist on the tales:
## Improv renditions of Chaucer's classic 'Canterbury' chronicles 
### Michael Green Staff writer 
Chaucer may have died before
completing "The Canterbury
Tales." But to senior Adam Tobin,
that seems all the more reason to
perform them without a script.
Tobin and his troupe of pilgrims
will use improvisation to create
their own "Tales" to finish the saga
in a newly adapted form of
Chaucer's classic. The three perfor
mances Nov. 12, 13 and 14, will be
partially scripted, with the rest im
provised in the genre of "The Can
terbury Tales."

'I wanted to do a show
that required 'smart'
actors.'
—Adam Tobin

Literature and the Arts never
looked so good.
The project is a portion of Adam
Tobin's senior thesis, which is an ex
ploration of "The Canterbury
Tales" through translation and
adaptation, and comparison with
the stories of other Medieval au
thors who tried to tack their tales
onto Chaucer's canon.
The idea for this innovative pro
ject came to Tobin while at Stan
ford-in-Oxford where he was
teaching improvisation. Planning a
possible performance, Tobin real
ized he needed a big idea with a big
name that would stand out.
Chaucer came to mind, and the
sperm hit the egg.
For Tobin, the "Tales' " allure lay
in its potential to merge eclectic
ideas. "It's the total synthesis of all
my major interests: English, literary
criticism, improv and playwriting,"
said Tobin.
Tobin began work this summer
— with the assistance of a grant
from Undergraduate Research Op

portunities, which he referred to as
"the best kept secret at Stanford" —
on his chosen task of studying the
Medieval age ana adapting
Chaucer's Middle English. In doing
so, Tobin translated 894 lines —
about 25 pages — of Middle Eng
lish into original rhyming iambic
pentameter.
This body of work, which in
cludes The Prologue and The
Knight's Tale, comprises the script
ed portion of the performance. The
remainder, however, will be left to
the actors — of which Tobin is one
— and to the audience.
Tobin said he placed great em
phasis on the actors in this project
for several reasons. In response to
last year's budget cuts in the arts,
Tobin said, "1 wanted to do a show
that required 'smart' actors. I want
ed to prove that acting isn't just
something you get up there and do,
but requires intelligence and train
ing."
To prepare for the performance,
Tobin researched and translated the
work under the "watchful and
mindful eye" of his project adviser,
English Prof. Seth and honed
his improv skills with Drama Prof.
Patricia Ryan.
But getting ready for the produc
tion was also a challenge for the
show's 12 other improvisers, whom
Tobin lauds as "the greatest cast in
history."
Not only did the actors have but
six weeks to completely familiarize
themselves with the conventions of
the Medieval age and genre, but
with its speech as well. This meant
becoming at case with spontaneous
and free-flowing proper poetry. At
least one "Talc" per evening will be
improvised in the famed and dread
ed full rhyming iambic pentameter.
There's your reason for "smart
people" in theater.
Besides serving as an exercise in
criticism, Tobin said the impro
vised performance is also an experi
ence in control, which is transferred

"from Chaucer, to me as translator
and performer, to the actors as per
formers, to the audience.
"I've been to too many [plays]
where the audience didn't have any
thing to do with the performance,"
Tobin added.
With the exception of the trans
lated portion, each night will be a
different show. Each of the actors is
familiar with the repertoire of char
acters available, but no one knows
who will be which or what they will
do until it happens.
Tobin, who is also one of the orig
inal members of the Stanford Im
proviscrs, wanted his long-form im
provisational project to go beyond
the all-too-common short, funny
skit format. "I've set up a form where
each story is 10 minutes long. So
there's no place for quick jokes." The
result, Tobin said, is a story.
After his performances, Tobin
said he will sit down to watch and
evaluate the shows on video. He

plans to compare his translations
and renditions of Chaucer with
those of the Medieval writers who
tried to pass their own work off as a
part of Chaucer's. He will then in
corporate these efforts into his Eng
lish honors thesis, which he plans to
write next quarter.
Tobin said he hopes to eventual
ly seek a master's degree in acting.
Then, he will look "into the abyss of
being an actor or writer, and take
that road wherever it goes."
When asked how he felt about
the actualization of his efforts,
Tobin blushed under his temporary
beard and said, "I'm really excited
actually."
In his characteristic whirlwind
of excitement Tobin said, "We've
learned 'The Canterbury Tales'
through improv and we've learned
improv through 'The Canterbury
Tales.' And I still feel I've been true
to the text. And, most of all, the au
dience is going to have a great time.

What more could you ask for?"
The opening of "The Canter
bury Tales" tonight at 7:30 p.m. also
marks the inauguration of the
newly remodeled Eleanor Prosser
Studio Theater, the once beloved
brown Room 205 of the Drama De
partment, located on the second
floor of Memorial Hall. The new
theater seats 65.
Preceding the performance of
"The Canterbury Tales" will be
Music Prof. Kimberly Marshall's
seminar, titled "Studies in Medieval
Music." During the seminar, stu
dents will perform original musical
compositions and, in accordance
with the theme, improvised me

Ross McCall's training in improv theater enhances his performance in senior Adam Tobin's modernized
rendition of Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales."
Chaucer may have died before
completing "The Canterbury
Tales." But to senior Adam Tobin,
that seems all the more reason to
perform them without a script.
Tobin and his troupe of pilgrims
will use improvisation to create
their own "Tales" to finish the saga
in a newly adapted form of
Chaucer's classic. The three perfor
mances Nov. 12, 13 and 14, will be
partially scripted, with the rest im
provised in the genre of "The Can
terbury Tales."

'I wanted to do a show
that required 'smart'
actors.'
—Adam Tobin

Literature and the Arts never
looked so good.
The project is a portion of Adam
Tobin's senior thesis, which is an ex
ploration of "The Canterbury
Tales" through translation and
adaptation, and comparison with
the stories of other Medieval au
thors who tried to tack their tales
onto Chaucer's canon.
The idea for this innovative pro
ject came to Tobin while at Stan
ford-in-Oxford where he was
teaching improvisation. Planning a
possible performance, Tobin real
ized he needed a big idea with a big
name that would stand out.
Chaucer came to mind, and the
sperm hit the egg.
For Tobin, the "Tales' " allure lay
in its potential to merge eclectic
ideas. "It's the total synthesis of all
my major interests: English, literary
criticism, improv and playwriting,"
said Tobin.
Tobin began work this summer
— with the assistance of a grant
from Undergraduate Research Op

portunities, which he referred to as
"the best kept secret at Stanford" —
on his chosen task of studying the
Medieval age ana adapting
Chaucer's Middle English. In doing
so, Tobin translated 894 lines —
about 25 pages — of Middle Eng
lish into original rhyming iambic
pentameter.
This body of work, which in
cludes The Prologue and The
Knight's Tale, comprises the script
ed portion of the performance. The
remainder, however, will be left to
the actors — of which Tobin is one
— and to the audience.
Tobin said he placed great em
phasis on the actors in this project
for several reasons. In response to
last year's budget cuts in the arts,
Tobin said, "1 wanted to do a show
that required 'smart' actors. I want
ed to prove that acting isn't just
something you get up there and do,
but requires intelligence and train
ing."
To prepare for the performance,
Tobin researched and translated the
work under the "watchful and
mindful eye" of his project adviser,
English Prof. Seth and honed
his improv skills with Drama Prof.
Patricia Ryan.
But getting ready for the produc
tion was also a challenge for the
show's 12 other improvisers, whom
Tobin lauds as "the greatest cast in
history."
Not only did the actors have but
six weeks to completely familiarize
themselves with the conventions of
the Medieval age and genre, but
with its speech as well. This meant
becoming at case with spontaneous
and free-flowing proper poetry. At
least one "Talc" per evening will be
improvised in the famed and dread
ed full rhyming iambic pentameter.
There's your reason for "smart
people" in theater.
Besides serving as an exercise in
criticism, Tobin said the impro
vised performance is also an experi
ence in control, which is transferred

"from Chaucer, to me as translator
and performer, to the actors as per
formers, to the audience.
"I've been to too many [plays]
where the audience didn't have any
thing to do with the performance,"
Tobin added.
With the exception of the trans
lated portion, each night will be a
different show. Each of the actors is
familiar with the repertoire of char
acters available, but no one knows
who will be which or what they will
do until it happens.
Tobin, who is also one of the orig
inal members of the Stanford Im
proviscrs, wanted his long-form im
provisational project to go beyond
the all-too-common short, funny
skit format. "I've set up a form where
each story is 10 minutes long. So
there's no place for quick jokes." The
result, Tobin said, is a story.
After his performances, Tobin
said he will sit down to watch and
evaluate the shows on video. He

plans to compare his translations
and renditions of Chaucer with
those of the Medieval writers who
tried to pass their own work off as a
part of Chaucer's. He will then in
corporate these efforts into his Eng
lish honors thesis, which he plans to
write next quarter.
Tobin said he hopes to eventual
ly seek a master's degree in acting.
Then, he will look "into the abyss of
being an actor or writer, and take
that road wherever it goes."
When asked how he felt about
the actualization of his efforts,
Tobin blushed under his temporary
beard and said, "I'm really excited
actually."
In his characteristic whirlwind
of excitement Tobin said, "We've
learned 'The Canterbury Tales'
through improv and we've learned
improv through 'The Canterbury
Tales.' And I still feel I've been true
to the text. And, most of all, the au
dience is going to have a great time.

What more could you ask for?"
The opening of "The Canter
bury Tales" tonight at 7:30 p.m. also
marks the inauguration of the
newly remodeled Eleanor Prosser
Studio Theater, the once beloved
brown Room 205 of the Drama De
partment, located on the second
floor of Memorial Hall. The new
theater seats 65.
Preceding the performance of
"The Canterbury Tales" will be
Music Prof. Kimberly Marshall's
seminar, titled "Studies in Medieval
Music." During the seminar, stu
dents will perform original musical
compositions and, in accordance
with the theme, improvised me
dieval tunes.

Performances of "The Canterbury
Talcs" will be held Nov. 12-14 at the
Eleanor Prosser Studio Theater, lo
cated in the back of Memorial Audi
