uditions at Stanford can be
M \ like that crucial first date with
• the guy or girl you've been
drooling over for the past few months. You've
mustered up enough nerve to actually call and
set something up. Now you've got a limited
amount of time to prove that you're a perfect
match.

It's your big chance to show

off your personality and
talent, or, to fail miser
ably and recede into the
shadows of those who
never get called back.
However, unlike first

dates, Stanford auditions
can be relatively painless.
While your hypotheti-

cal date may yawn when
you launch into a mono-

logue, and look at his or her
watch when you try anoth
er silly impersonation, the

audition committee is your cap
tive audience. They're trained

to smile, no matter how
abysmal you are.

"We have to keep a

smile on our face espe-

daily when people are

doing badly," says junior

Jamie Way, a member of
the a cappella group Coun

terpoint. "People usually
know when they're blowing

it, and the last thing they need is

an audience of stony faces."
Stanford audition commit

tees pride themselves on their sup

portive nature. "When 1 see someone
really flubbing it,"says junior Alexis

Turner, choreographer for this spring's
"West Side Story," "I'll stand in the aisles and

do the step that's supposed to be going on to
help the person get back on the right track."
When an auditionee enthusiastically belt
ed out the theme to "Gilligan's Island" at this
year's Gaieties audition, not only did everyone
in the auditorium join in with hurricane nois
es, but the assistant director even cued the au
ditionee when he forgot the last few lines.
Ah, Stanford. There are few places on
earth where other people are so willing to help
us make fools of ourselves.

Here are some simple guidelines
to auditioning for Stanford
drama productions: First of all,
check your dorm or the Drama
Department for fliers announc
ing auditions.
• Decide whether you want to be in the

production — if the show interests you, if your
schedule allows enough time for it and if you
want to work with the particular artistic staff
in charge of the production.
• The directors and artistic staff usually
hold an informational meeting a few days be
fore auditions begin. While these meetings are
not mandatory — some Stanford drama vet
erans admit they have never attended one —
the sessions usually can help assuage fears and
provide potential auditionees with guidelines
on audition pieces. Sign-up sheets for audition
times are also posted at the meeting. If you
forego the informational meeting, just call the
stage manager to sign up for a time.
• On the day of the audition, go about 15
minutes early to fill out some forms about

'You want to be everything they're looking for, but
of course, you don't know what they're looking for. So, you try
to be the happiest, saddest, craziest, sanest, uppest,
downest, funniest, most serious person in the world.'
— Andy Goldberg

yourself — and also to collect your spasmodic
nerves.
• A few days after the audition, lists will be
posted in the Drama Department. If your
name is there, place your initials next to it to
indicate that you have seen the list and you ac
cept your part. The stage manager will get in
touch with you about rehearsals.
Some talk to walls, some make
faces at themselves in the mirror,
others lounge around in their
rooms naked all day. But every
body has some way of psyching
themselves up for an audition.
To get those dramatic juices flowing, co
term Toby Chun phases himself into different
characters during the day. He tries to emulate
a known character and put him in a random
situation. But despite these warm-up exercis
es, Chun says it's difficult to build momentum
between auditions. "Each time feels like the
first time. It's always an unknown."
Most actors will try to dress somewhat for
the type of part they want. One would not
wear red lipstick when trying out for a young
virginal role — but for a hooker, it might win
the part. Junior Melissa Wilson credits some of
her successful auditions to her "musical the
ater outfit."
She always wears burgundy shorts and a

periwin
kle top
— basic,
but color-

ful and com-

fortable, she says. Wilson also tries to look athlet
ic because she wants the director to think she
takes dance classes. The real zinger, however, is
the goofy brown bow with white polka dots that
she wears in her hair.
"If I'm auditioning for a really perky part
I can prop it up like rabbit ears, or I can tone it
down as more of a power accessory for some
thing more serious. My bow has character. The
important thing is to have them notice you
somehow. Often you get called back just be
cause you have a sparkle," she says.

Wilson, the current stage manager for
Winter One Acts, has been on the artistic staff
of "Cabaret," performed in Centennial Gai
eties and Big Game Gaieties 1991, and pro
duced the "NuStußevue." She has not failed to
receive a part she has auditioned for since her
freshman year in high school — and it's not
just the goofy polka-dotted bow.
"I know what my strengths are and I audi
tion for parts that play up to them. I try to go
in with a lot of confidence and with a lot of en
ergy," Wilson says.
"Afterwards, if I think I did badly, I ratio
nalize, and try to tell myself that the show isn't
that important. And if I think I did well, I'll try
not to let myself get too psyched up because you
can never really know until call backs But
going in, my main job is to be perky, energetic,
and to have a winner's attitude."
£ 112 ou want to be everything
w they're looking for, but of
course, you don't know
what they're looking for.
So, you try to be the happi
-1 est, saddest, craziest, san
est, uppest, downest, funniest, most serious per
son in the world," says senior Andy Goldberg.
During the audition, the committee sits
back and scribbles notes on those annoying
forms on which auditionees have divulged

such personal
tidbits like their

height, weight

and favorite joke. But what exactly do
the committee members write on the
forms, and what do they do with
them?
No, they're not writing, "She
doesn't look 5-6 and 110 pounds."
But they are writing things that will
help them remember the auditionee:
"Tall and skinny with big teeth." And
more importantly, says junior Jason
Mayland, the producer of this year's

Winter One Acts, they are evaluating your abil
ity and your stage presence: "Great voice, but
can't act" or "Can't dance, but good attitude."
Senior Matt Swanson, speaking from first
hand experience, also encourages auditionees
to put up a confident front.
In the dreaded dance section of the Centen
nial Gaieties audition, Swanson tripped and fell
flat on his face. But instead of taking advantage
of his sprawled-out position by grabbing onto
someone else's ankle so he would not have to
suffer alone, or booking home before somebody
remembered his face, he just picked himself up
and kept giving them more smiles and energy.
He ended up getting a part.
Swanson, now the producer of Big Game
Gaieties 1992, espouses a little wisdom learned
from his own embarrassing experience: "As an
auditionee you think that every little thing
counts," he says. "But in actuality, the stuff that
you do on stage is less important than your
general demeanor."
While neither energy nor attitude has much
to do with talent, each of these can play significant
roles in who gets cast. Arrogance or low energy are
turnoffs for almost any director, Wilson says.
For Big Game Gaieties, Swanson says the
artistic staff looks for "people who are relaxed,
talented, and have the personality to get along
with the rest of the cast."

Auditionees for "Uttle
Shop of Horrors" belt out
their favorite tunes and
dance frantically to the
choreographer's steps,
hoping the artistic staff just
can't get enough and will
call them back for more.

Wilson agrees that coop
erative cast members are
key. "We're not interested in
divas," she says.

' Another audition faux pas
Wilson advises against is over
or-underacting. They don't like
it "if you decide that you're a
character in a soap opera or if
you read [the script] just like
you're reading a bio text book,"
she says.
.And never, ever let 'em
see you sweat. It does not bode
well for auditionees if the di
rector can see their knees
knocking together and their
teeth chattering while they sing
their hearts and lungs out, she
explained.
fter the auditions are over, the
production and artistic staff gets
together at Denny's or, prefer
ably, somebody's house for a ses
sion that lasts at best six hours,
and at worst, all nieht. It's nice to

w — —» - cr —
get off campus, Turner says. "It's a hectic, stress
ful time, and we wouldn't want to be where peo
ple we might know could overhear us."
Then, the committee shuffles through the
forms and compares notes. According to Turn
er, it's an open forum. "Anyone can start dis
cussion about a specific person," she says. If
someone had a really strong voice, the vocal di
rector might start out by recommending him
or her for a certain part, and then the relevant
staff members comment on how he or she
thinks that person would do.
While one person might say, "So and so
had incredible presence; I've seen him in this
other production and I think he'd be really
good," another person might think the same
auditionee had totally overacted the part,
Mayland says.
The staff considers each person's
strengths, weaknesses, and how they might fit a
certain part, he says."It can't help but be a sub
jective process."
However, Wilson says the meeting "is very
collaborative. There's not a lot of ragging on
people; we're really just centering on who's
going to be best for the show."
By the end of the night, everyone's had a
chance to give their input, the tough calls have
been made, all the forms have been put into lit
tle piles and a call-back list is ready to be post
ed. Then, the real excitement begins... Who
knows? If the right names are on the list, this
could be the start of a beautiful friendship.
