# Cruising the Strip...

If you need to study in solitude, have a
sordid fling or book lodging for a visitor,
then El Camino has many a fine offering.
One such locale is the Mermaid Motel, at
727 El Camino Real. Not unlike Homer's
sirens, the Mer-

maid beckons to passing motorists with her
aqua and brown hues.
A true gem on the roadside, the Mer
maid's accommodating hosts, Buck and
Debbi Miles, are gracious and helpful.
Rooms are tidy and moderately priced at $64
for a double.
The biggest lure to this otherwise regular

motel, however, lies within the
stonefaced walls of its courtyard.
There, the motel's piece de resis
tance — a statue of a forlorn mer
maid sitting on a rock — over
looks the swimming pool. In the
evening hours it is bathed in yel
low light, giving it an embalmed
look.

For a unique getaway from
Stanford, you might consider a
relaxing evening by the pool, sit
ting in an aqua lounge chair
where you can marvel at the
Mermaid's sickly pallor. Who
needs Disneyland?

If the mystical nautical
motif fails to thrill, try a trip
into the future at the Riviera
Motor Inn, located at 15 El
Camino Real.

To envision the Riviera is
to recall Spacely's Sprockets.
Bubble-shaped balconies, ac
cordion roofs and abundant
Astro Turf make this environ a
veritable futurama. All this
atmosphere goes for $52 a
night per double.

The Riviera has been visit
ed by Hollywood: Brian De
Palma's film "Raising Cain"
was shot here last year. The
motel's co-manager Wesley
Crates proudly describes the
place in his business cards as
"Menlo's Park's Dramatic

Motel."
If the future scares you, a trip back to the
recent past might provide some nostalgic
respite.
You think your orange shag rug in Stern is
the height of '70s kitsch? For full envelop
ment in a shrine to bad taste, take your pil-

grimage to the
Mayflower Garden
Motel at 3981 El
Camino Real.

Bring Sabrina,
Kelly, Chris and the
whole "Charlie's An
gels" crew. From the

orange and brown
motif to the seven
foot carport that
sports jutting

rocks, the May
flower Garden is a
wonder to be
hold. It's far out.

Tackycity.
Come here
to check out
the atmos
phere, but

don't come
here to stay.
Though it's
only $34 for a
double,
Mayflower
rooms are

on the foul side. Junky furniture, dirty car
pets and thin sheets make a visit here an un
savory experience. And the plastiquc mys
tique is all-pervasive, from the flowers in the
lobby to the honeycomb lamps.
If the leisure suit scene is not your calling,
you might consider donning your tights to
enter the charming world of make-believe
provided by the Glass Slipper Inn at 3941 El
Camino Real. Its neon-adorned alpine-style

high roofs, rising turret and grey stucco walls
preside majestically over the royal road. King
Arthur couldn't have had it better.
The common areas of the Glass Slipper
Inn are not to be missed. The mirrored lobby
sports a white fountain, green leather couch
and pentagon-patterned orange carpet.
Despite outer extravagancies, rooms are
disappointingly run-of-the-mill: no fire
place and broom. But at $34 for a

double, they are
r dean and well kept.
There, you can
close the red door
and turn into a
pumpkin in peace.

If the shoe doesn't
fit, then maybe the
crown will. At the
Coronet Motel, 2455 El

Camino, a toned-down
version of the regal
theme pervades. From
the coat of arms border

I around the pool to the
plush brown carpets, the
Coronet serves to please.
Its literature even boasts a
convenient location: "clos-

est to industrial area."
Double rooms begin at
$42 a night, and have recent
ly been reinforced for earth
quake safety. Also available
are sitting room units that

offer formica counters and vinyl bar stools
that make for convenient entertaining.
So, if you are an aficionado of the absurd,
and want a larger-than-life experience, look
no further than El Camino Real and its mo
tels. There, anything can happen: mermaids
cavort with Jetsons, and Charlies Angels
frolic with Cinderella.
Whoever thought this could occur so
close to campus?
