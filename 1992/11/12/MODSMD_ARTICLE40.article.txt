# Not hackers but huckers take over Stanford
## 
### Brian Egan Editorial staff 
Some people were just born to huck.
To huck, of course, is to throw a frisbee
over a long distance. Not a definition you'd
find in Webster's Dictionary, but a term that
any frisbee golfer knows well.
Hucking is just one aspect of frisbee golf, a
game that has exploded in popularity at
Stanford and other campuses around the na
tion over the last decade.

"Last week, we
were playing at 1:30
a.m. on a Thursday
night in the rain,"
said junior Zack
Dcmko, "and we saw
two other groups of
golfers on our course
alone. It's pretty
amazing."
Just what is frisbee
golf? No, there are no
frisbee golf clubs,

greens, carts, caddies, putters or pins. The
object of the game is quite simple: players try
to get their frisbee from one place, the "tee
off," to another, the "hole," in the least
amount of throws.
Over the last 20 years at the Farm, howev
er, a complex mixture of rules and regula
tions has emerged from this one simple tenet.
The Axe Committee publishes in its student
handbook a description of the "official" 18-
hole, par-72, Stanford frisbee golf course.
More importantly, the Committee has de
veloped a list of seven "golden rules of frisbee
golf" that in many circles have become the

Tourists are 'nice peo
ple who see your fris
bee, pick it up, and say,
Oh, is this yours?'
— Mick Killianey

governing rules of the sport.
These laws range from the highly technical
— a 175-gram Wham-O "World Class" is the
frisbee of choice — to the slightly ridiculous.
For example, "completion of hole" occurs
when your frisbee makes contact with the
hole (if the hole is an object); your frisbee
flies completely through its target (if the hole
is an archway); or your frisbee lands com
pletely within the borders of a designated
area (if the hole is in the ground).
According to graduate student Mick Kil-

lianey, however, such
rules are virtually
meaningless once the
game begins. "Basi
cally, there are no
rules. Anything goes
in frisbee golf."
Killianey, Demko
and senior Jeff
Townsend formed
part of the eight-per
son entourage that left
Okada House last

Thursday night at 11 p.m. for a round of fris
bee golf. What began as a whim for the group
has become something of a tradition —
they've been playing Thursday nights at 11
p.m. for the entire quarter.
Talent and athletic ability are not playing
prerequisites, nor is any knowledge of the
sport whatsoever. At the opening tee, Demko
tells his friend Killianey that frisbee golf is
similar to real golf. Killianey's response? "Oh.
What's real golf like?"
As he tees off, Demko displays his flawless
technique, hucking low, hard and flat, so that
his disc skips smoothly along the pavement.

Others are not so lucky. On the 11th hole,
Townsend climbs the roof of the Storke Stu
dent Publications Building to retrieve an er
rant toss. Killianey, hits the water twice while
attempting to clear Terman Pond on holes
nine and 10.
Obstacles such as Terman Pond, however,
are as much a part of the game as anything
else. While the Handbook permits players to
"move any object that blocks play as long as
they are physically able to move it, short of

dynamiting it," Mick disapproves as another
player moves a bike while driving on the
eighth. M lt doesn't matter what the book says,
you're not allowed to move that!"
Indeed, some obstacles are simply unavoid
able. Playing in the daytime is particularly haz
ardous, according to Mick. "In the day, you
have too many visitors around," he says, char
acterizing tourists as "nice people who see
your frisbee, pick it up, and say, Oh, is this
yours?"
