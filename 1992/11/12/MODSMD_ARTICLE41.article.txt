# They Might Be Giants
## 
### Joshua Walker Staff writer 
Call them loony. Call them wacky. Call
them psychedelic gyrating nerdkins from the
netherworld stuck on perpetual pur£e in the
blender of berserkosity.
Heck, call them They Might Be Giants.
And while you're at it, call them in San
Francisco for three shows next week.
They Might Be Giants, a double John duo
of John Linnell and John Flansburgh, are
currently on their "Don't Tread On The Cut-
Up Snake World Tour." Guitarist/vocalist
Flansburgh promises, with just the slightest
hint of sarcasm, that the shows at the Great
American Music Hall Nov. 15,16 and 17, will

be the "ultimate rock
experience."
TMBG, with new
gimmicks like "Spin
the Dial" (where they
turn on the radio and
play whatever they
hear) and an in-se
quence playing of all 19
tracks from their first
album (on the third
San Francisco date),
also boasts the ultimate
crowd-pleaser: a real
live band.

In the past, the duo has only performed
without accompaniment. "We thought, why
not get a band and make the next leap?"
Flansburgh said. "It's been a real jolt of ex
citement musically."
The tour follows last spring's release of
"Apollo 18," TMBG's fifth album (including
a remix/B-side compilation). The album
cover — a sperm whale battling a giant squid
while a moon-landing spacecraft looks on —
hints at the Giants' classic antics.
"Apollo 18" marks TMBG's second major
label album. Starting on the independent
label Bar/None, TMBG signed a seven
album deal with Elektra in 1989. However,
this move, and the ensuing success of
"Flood" (1990), hasn't drastically altered
TMBG's music-making.
"Our situation is always evolving, and I
don't think we feel any more pressure be
cause we're on a major label than we would if
we were at this level on ari indie [indepen-

thing. We're just groov

dent label]," said Flansburgh.
"Just making records at all was the thing
that started changing our lives," Flansburgh
said. The two Johns started TMBG as a hobby
in 1983. At the time, Flansburgh pasted up
children's books and "counted people on
trains."
"Before we made our first album, our real
goal was just to make a record. That seemed
like a dream to us — it wasn't clear that it was
possible at all," he said.
"For me it always has a really exciting,
extra implausible aspect to it. I'm just really
blown away that I get to play guitar for a liv

ing.
The band worked to create "a kind of
music that was very personal" to them,

Flansburgh continued.
"1 feel like we're ex
tremely serious about
hanging on to that orig
inal spirit. . . . That's
what people seem to
enjoy about what we do
— our songs aren't real
ly like anyone else's."
The band's music
covers a wide range of
styles — from dance
pop to jazz to folk.
Their lyrics are franti
cally complex, dense

with allusion and metaphor, a visceral square
dance with the absurd.
"Our approach, in general, somehow
comes from another direction [than other
rock bands]. It's really hard to say what that
x-factor is but 1 feel like it's obviously there
and I don't think that it has changed that
much.
"We're not rehearsing to be a Top 40 band.
That's not anybody's final goal for us."
The band's music "captures people's in
terests on a lot of different levels," Flansburgh
continued. "So it's really hard to sum up why
someone comes to our show or what makes
somebody interested in what we're doing."
Because of the heterogeneity of TMBG's
audience, Flansburgh doesn't try to influence
what the audience leaves the show with. But
"I don't want them to leave with any of our
equipment," he quipped.
"1 don't want to tell people how to think,"
he said. "I don't want to say, like, 'Yeah, we

want to fill people with good cheer,' because
I don't think that that's our message."
With song titles like "The Famous Polka"
(from "Miscellaneous T"), "Purple Toupee"
(from "Lincoln"), and "Toddler Highway"
(from their self-titled debut), combined with
the upbeat blend of styles, the casual listener
may find it difficult not to interpret a cheer
ful message.
"A lot of our songs are about disappoint
ment," said Flansburgh. "A lot of our songs
are bitter in some ways. I want people to hear
that, even though they might be seeing a
show where everyone's dancing. There's a
certain celebratory aspect to a live perfor
mance, but I still want people to hear what's
inside the songs. I want people to be able to
experience each song the way it should be —
without too much distraction from slam
dancers."
How, then, do these seemingly joyful
jesters become so bitter?
"Man, I am an angry, cranky, mean-spir
ited fellow," Flansburgh said with a snicker.
"I'm just hiding my feelings by being polite,"
he explained, losing his snicker.
These emotions, however, are kept in

check by their meticulous song-writing
process. "We're very self-conscious about
what we're doing," Flansburgh said.
"We work more like pre-rock era song
writers than a lot of rock bands do. We don't
jam and then sift through the ideas that came
up in the jam and write a song. We tend to
cobble the songs together a little bit more," he
said.
"And no, we are not on something. We're
just grooving to the beautiful vibe of New
York City," he explained. "We're just taking
all the love that's around us and turning it in
to a beautiful song."
After spending the better part of this year
touring, those vibes are speaking loudly to
Flansburgh. "At this moment I'm pretty
ready to make another record. I'm really get
ting warmed up to have another crack at it."
Even among the monotony of touring,
Flansburgh finds some semblance of joy in
performing his favorite songs. "It's always
fun for me to play 'Don't Let's Start' (from
their first album), as corny as it sounds. It's
got a really good set of changes in it, so there's
a lot of variety to it... It's always kind of a gas
to play it."

in 1983. At the time, Flansburgh pasted up
children's books and "counted people on
trains."
"Before we made our first album, our real
goal was just to make a record. That seemed
like a dream to us — it wasn't clear that it was
possible at all," he said.

ing.
The band worked to create "a kind of
music that was very personal" to them,

Flansburgh continued.
"1 feel like we're ex
tremely serious about
hanging on to that orig
inal spirit. . . . That's
what people seem to
enjoy about what we do
— our songs aren't real
ly like anyone else's."
The band's music
covers a wide range of
styles — from dance
pop to jazz to folk.
Their lyrics are franti
cally complex, dense

with allusion and metaphor, a visceral square
dance with the absurd.
"Our approach, in general, somehow
comes from another direction [than other
rock bands]. It's really hard to say what that
x-factor is but 1 feel like it's obviously there
and I don't think that it has changed that
much.
"We're not rehearsing to be a Top 40 band.
That's not anybody's final goal for us."
The band's music "captures people's in
terests on a lot of different levels," Flansburgh
continued. "So it's really hard to sum up why
someone comes to our show or what makes
somebody interested in what we're doing."
Because of the heterogeneity of TMBG's
audience, Flansburgh doesn't try to influence
what the audience leaves the show with. But
"I don't want them to leave with any of our
equipment," he quipped.
"1 don't want to tell people how to think,"
he said. "I don't want to say, like, 'Yeah, we

want to fill people with good cheer,' because
I don't think that that's our message."
With song titles like "The Famous Polka"
(from "Miscellaneous T"), "Purple Toupee"
(from "Lincoln"), and "Toddler Highway"
(from their self-titled debut), combined with
the upbeat blend of styles, the casual listener
may find it difficult not to interpret a cheer
ful message.
"A lot of our songs are about disappoint
ment," said Flansburgh. "A lot of our songs
are bitter in some ways. I want people to hear
that, even though they might be seeing a
show where everyone's dancing. There's a
certain celebratory aspect to a live perfor
mance, but I still want people to hear what's
inside the songs. I want people to be able to
experience each song the way it should be —
without too much distraction from slam
dancers."
How, then, do these seemingly joyful
jesters become so bitter?
"Man, I am an angry, cranky, mean-spir
ited fellow," Flansburgh said with a snicker.
"I'm just hiding my feelings by being polite,"
he explained, losing his snicker.
These emotions, however, are kept in

check by their meticulous song-writing
process. "We're very self-conscious about
what we're doing," Flansburgh said.
"We work more like pre-rock era song
writers than a lot of rock bands do. We don't
jam and then sift through the ideas that came
up in the jam and write a song. We tend to
cobble the songs together a little bit more," he
said.
"And no, we are not on something. We're
just grooving to the beautiful vibe of New
York City," he explained. "We're just taking
all the love that's around us and turning it in
to a beautiful song."
After spending the better part of this year
touring, those vibes are speaking loudly to
Flansburgh. "At this moment I'm pretty
ready to make another record. I'm really get
ting warmed up to have another crack at it."
Even among the monotony of touring,
Flansburgh finds some semblance of joy in
performing his favorite songs. "It's always
fun for me to play 'Don't Let's Start' (from
their first album), as corny as it sounds. It's
got a really good set of changes in it, so there's
a lot of variety to it... It's always kind of a gas
to play it."

They Might Be Giants, the duo of John Flansburgh and John Linnell, will play at the
Great American Music Hall Nov. 15-17. New gimmicks In store for their concerts include
a live back-up band and an In-sequence performance of their entire first album.
Call them loony. Call them wacky. Call
them psychedelic gyrating nerdkins from the
netherworld stuck on perpetual pur£e in the
blender of berserkosity.
Heck, call them They Might Be Giants.
And while you're at it, call them in San
Francisco for three shows next week.
They Might Be Giants, a double John duo
of John Linnell and John Flansburgh, are
currently on their "Don't Tread On The Cut-
Up Snake World Tour." Guitarist/vocalist
Flansburgh promises, with just the slightest
hint of sarcasm, that the shows at the Great
American Music Hall Nov. 15,16 and 17, will

be the "ultimate rock
experience."
TMBG, with new
gimmicks like "Spin
the Dial" (where they
turn on the radio and
play whatever they
hear) and an in-se
quence playing of all 19
tracks from their first
album (on the third
San Francisco date),
also boasts the ultimate
crowd-pleaser: a real
live band.

In the past, the duo has only performed
without accompaniment. "We thought, why
not get a band and make the next leap?"
Flansburgh said. "It's been a real jolt of ex
citement musically."
The tour follows last spring's release of
"Apollo 18," TMBG's fifth album (including
a remix/B-side compilation). The album
cover — a sperm whale battling a giant squid
while a moon-landing spacecraft looks on —
hints at the Giants' classic antics.
"Apollo 18" marks TMBG's second major
label album. Starting on the independent
label Bar/None, TMBG signed a seven
album deal with Elektra in 1989. However,
this move, and the ensuing success of
"Flood" (1990), hasn't drastically altered
TMBG's music-making.
"Our situation is always evolving, and I
don't think we feel any more pressure be
cause we're on a major label than we would if
