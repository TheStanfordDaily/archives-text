# Weird trips in Meyer with classic cult films
##

It seems as if there will be no more gratu
itous violence, orgies or eating of feces on the
Stanford campus.
Tuesday Flicks, that loyal companion of
those in search of a bizarre aesthetic experience,
is dead, voted out of ASSU funding. One must
wonder what will become of the weird and
wonderful film connoisseurs looking for their
weekly fix of the avant-garde and subversive.
True, there will be no showings of Mexican
films with French subtitles dubbed in English
this year, but fear not Stanford students: there
is a solution.
Meyer Media Center, that bastion of learn
ing — home of rheumatic documentaries and
every outdated piece of'6os furniture imagin
able — is the answer.
The Media Center, located on the second
floor of Meyer Library, offers a good variety of
classic disturbing films not to be missed by the
serious fan in search of a mind-bending expe
rience.
•"A Clockwork Orange": Without this in
your personal repertoire, you should hardly
consider yourself a serious disturbing-movie
buff. With his artistically choreographed rape

and fight scenes, Stanley Kubrick has captured
the ultra-violent future of a fascist-run Eng
land magically. You will never hum "Singing in
the Rain" in the same key again.
To watch "A Clockwork Orange" is to expe
rience 137 minutes of awe-inspiring beauty as
Alex, portrayed as a punk gangster graced with
a codpiece extraordinaire, is put through the
trials of a futuristic mind-programming sys
tem. Alex loses his free will after undergoing his
"treatment" in jail. His trials will cause viewers
to cringe to the sound of Beethoven's Ninth
and crave Visine for weeks to come.
•"Blue Velvet": On the American front,
David Lynch s films are well represented at the
Media Center, with his masterpiece work, "Blue
Velvet," as the highlight. Lynch turns a seem
ingly sleepy American town scenario upside
down, exposing the drug-frenzied, mercilessly
violent environment of the fringes of society.
Dennis Hopper, an actor who makes you
wet your pants each time he sneers at the
screen, is the terrorizer. Hopper is at his best as
he beats up the aloof but gorgeous Isabella
Rossellini during his nitrous-oxide trances. A
kidnap-mystery is at the heart of Lynch's work,
but it is his penchant for the random close-up
that gives the viewer a week of nightmares.
•"Eraserhead": A classic, yet entirely skip

pable Lynch movie, is also available. Come pre
pared for a black-and-white boredom-fest —
as the excitement of a neurotic father and his
worm-baby fades quickly. However, the film's
blue-ribbon scene, featuring a roasted chicken
having an orgasm, takes the cake for bizarre di
recting, and almost makes it worth your hour
and-a-half.
•"TUX 1138": For those looking for a night
mare in the computer-run futuristic realm,
George Lucas' "THX 1138" stands as an unfor
gettable picture of a sedated society devoid of
human feelings. In this early Lucas work, we
see the protagonist, THX 1138, get tricked out
of sedation by his female roommate, who gives
him sexual urges for the first time.
The film outlines a bald-headed human
race in a Utopia gone awry, where computers

monitor all aspccts of work and home life.
Lucas shoots masterful footage, switching
from probing surveillance screens to the hair
less subjects of the camera's study.
Old-time standards such as "Blade Runner,"
pre-Tina Turner "Mad Max" and "Apocalypse
Now" also take on a new dimension in the
Media Center. While your neighbors catch up
on psychology lectures, you will grip your or
ange vinyl low-rider chair in terror during the
suspenseful twists and turns of the typically
bizarre film.
The Media Center is permanently located
on the second floor of Meyer. It has pathetical
ly scant weekend hours: open Monday through
Thursday, 9 a.m. to midnight, Friday until 6
p.m., Saturday 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. and Sunday
noon to midnight.
