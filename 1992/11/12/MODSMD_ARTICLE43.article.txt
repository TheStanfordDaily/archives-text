## A 						showcase of ski stunts 
### 
Watch expert skiers perform incredible feats, and
novice skiers bite it with face plants. Whether you're an
avid skier or just a big fan of Zudnik the Wonder Dog,
this film is for you. Warren Miller, king of the sports
filmmakers, is at it again with "Steeper And Deeper," his
43rd collection of wild ski adventures.
Miller's movie features footage from Mt. Buller,
Australia, where skiers dodge wombats and kanga
roos, to Telluride, Colorado, home of Zudnik.
And for those of you who thought Wile. E. Coyote
had the right idea, Scot Schmidt, one of America's
most heralded skiers, finishes off the movie with some
spectacular cliff-jumping at Big Sky, Montana.
Tickets are available through BASS, at local ski gear
outlets and at the door. It will be shown Nov. 15, in
Palo Alto at Gunn High School's Spangenberg The
ater at 5 and 8 p.m.
