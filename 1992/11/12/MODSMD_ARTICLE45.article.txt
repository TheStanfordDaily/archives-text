It's no longer enough to chalk it up to Luke
Perry. This whole sideburn/ soul spots/ Ho Chi
Minh craze has become as painful as the "Baby
on Board" thing was in the '80s.
Listen, and listen close: There's nothing at
tractive about facial hair. Women — well,
women who aren't Madonna — don't walk
around nuzzling up to German Shephards.

And there's a damn good reason.
Only people who are really ugly should
hide behind facial hair. And then they should
go the whole nine yards — beard, mustache,
bushy monobrow — whatever it takes. It's a
community service.
But, you argue in your acutely defensive
Stanford style, Elvis Presley grew huge, mut

ton-chop sideburns. But, my Bic-needy
friends, he did it for a very good reason.
He was fat. So instead of letting people
walk around saying what a disgusting pig he
was, he got them to talk about the large, ani
mal-like growths on his face.
Elvis was a master of marketing.
You're no Elvis.
