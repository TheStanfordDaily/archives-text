The great sing-off
— or for Berke
ley groups, sing
off-key —pits Stanford
and Cal singing groups
against each other,
armed only with point
ed humor and their
vocal talents. Hosted at
Berkeley this year, the
sing-off will be held just
before Big Game on
Nov. 18, at 8 p.m.
A tradition perhaps
as old as Wilbur bread,
the concert will feature
The Mendicants, Every
day People, Fleet Street,

Counterpoint, Mixed Company, Talisman and
the newest Stanford a cappella group, the Har
monics. Also many Cal groups. So, come by and
sing along. It's the perfect chance to ruin your
vocal chords before Big Game.
Body Count
If midterms left you with too many warm
and fuzzy feelings, go to One Step Beyond on
Friday, Nov. 13, when Body Count — featur
ing the controversial Ice-T — perform live.
With tracks like "Cop Killer," "Smoked Pork"
and "There Goes the Neighborhood," you can
experience enough fast, dangerous metal angst
to make your mother become very worried.
In the wake of the L.A. riots, local and fed
eral law enforcement and government agencies
have recently applied pressure to Body Count's
parent company Time/Warner regarding "Cop
Killer." Ice-T himself removed the track from
the album, vowing only to distribute it at his
live shows. This is a live show. Don't miss your
opportunity to give your parents the willies
when you tell them who you saw in concert.
Grunge with Sugar
Not to be confused with food service
"bread mold," Bob Mould, dubbed the Godfa
ther of grunge rock, will be performing with his
new band, Sugar, Saturday Nov. 14, at the
Warfield in San Francisco. Formerly from the
burned-out and fallen-apart rock trio Hiisker
Du, Mould has struggled and maintained a
unique style that has influenced groups like
Nirvana, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam.
The concert will also feature the Throwing
Muses and the 800 Radleys. Tickets cost
$17.50.
