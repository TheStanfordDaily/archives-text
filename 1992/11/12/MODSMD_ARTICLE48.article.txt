# Avoiding the gaze: An almost-investigative report
## 
### 
I stopped being friends with Joey Banker in
third grade. Up until then we had a
healthy relationship: Monopoly, Atari,
trick or treating once or twice a year. But in
third grade, Joey insisted on drawing "naked
ladies" in my Puritan company. And, worse
yet, Joey couldn't draw.
Two years later, after Joey lost his Etch-O-
Sketch and I lost my ethics, we patched things
up. Then we found a Penthouse magazine in
my garage.
Less than one week later, Joey and I had al
ready abused the privileges of both his father's
photocopy machine and the copyright laws of
New Jersey.
It didn't take long for us to develop com
plex games with those somewhat blurry, Mat
tissesque mimeographs. We divided these
women into various categories — "face,"
"upper body," "creativity with fruit" — and
rated them from one to 10. Oddly enough nei
ther of us ever joined a fraternity. Or became
an actuary. Go figure.
We also never figured out why they kept
using their index finger to point to their geni
talia. Did they think we couldn't figure out
where it was? It wasn't until years later, a profes
sional therapist and the phrase "clitoral mastur
bation" that it all started making some sense.
I got a call from Joey Banker last week. He
graduated from college in three years and is
enrolled in Dental School. He's also getting
married.
I'm still dealing with that Penthouse.
Not too many years after that first sordid
experience, I had moved on to movies. Movies
with the production value of an XTV project.
But I was able to justify my lechery. After
all, our society is drenched with sex. From

Cosmo to Mickey Rourke movies, the main
focus of much of what goes under the name of
American entertainment is just sex. Pornog
raphy, of course, is also mostly about sex. I was
just being honest about it
Although not much of an exhibitionist my
self since this whole "body hair thing" took me
through a metamorphosis worse than Chevy
Chase in"The Shaggy D.A.," I find something
completely fascinating about the role of the
voyeur. The thought of invasion, of witnessing
the forbidden behind the safe distance of a
television set, made me more excited than
when Norm walks into the bar.
So, last Thursday I had to finally figure out
this whole pornography thing. I had to end
the guilt or decide to live in it—depending on
the cost of admission. Anything under a tithe
and I was in.
I was going to the Mitchell Brothers O'Far
rell Theatre.
For those of you unfamiliar with one of San
Francisco's most significant cultural land
scapes, the Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell The
atre is big. It has several floors and takes up a
good part of a block. It has a tasteful jungle
mural painted on its walls.
A sign at the desk said, in a simple sans
serif font: "This theater will not sell tickets to
anyone wearing shorts."
My friend and I were wearing shorts. But
the man behind the counter said they were
fine, because, fashionable guys that we are,
they were long shorts.
"Just don't want the cow jumping out of the
barn," he explained.
He informed us there were 68 girls inside. I
quickly put out my hand and stopped my
friend from saying "women."

Then he asked for $20.
And I couldn't do it. It wasn't the $20. Al
though the $20 somehow made it more sub
stantive than a $2 rental fee.

It's because it was a freak show. A show de
picting the incomprehensible abilities of a dif
ferent species, revolving around the Freudian
disgust/fascination with female genitalia. And
they were live women. Women I would have
to, at least with eye contact, confront.
Frustrated, more with myself than my cow,
I left. And not more than a block away, was a
sign above the Century Theater. And the sign
read: "Teri Weigel. Live."
Teri Weigel, for those unfamiliar with pop
ular culture, is one of the biggest stars in
today's porn industry. And she was right in
front of us.
I recognized her right away, mostly because
there were about 400 posters ofher in the lobby.
She had just finished "performing" and
was wearing a red, fuzzy wrap-around sweater
which went almost to her knees. She, looked,
well, she looked like a short, badly dressed re
ceptionist from LA.

She turned to the guy behind the desk and
asked him what time it was.
She sounded like a short, badly dressed re
ceptionist from LA.
I wanted so badly to say something to her,
to break through that TV screen which had
separated us for so long. But I had no idea
what to say.
"Hi, Teri. I really like the way..No. Or "I
was just wondering how you ..." No. Or
maybe just "Are you OK?"
I couldn't figure out what I was afraid of.
Was I worried about hurting her feelings? This
is a woman who spends her working hours
smiling at the ejaculate of unattractive men. I
couldn't insult her. Then it struck me.
Objectification.
But that's not why I couldn't talk to her.
I felt like a 13 year-old girl running into
Luke Perry judging pigs at a county fair. I was
star-struck, disappointed and disgusted at the
same time. Kind of like those times I walked in
on my parents having sex. With each other.
In her own childlike, pathetic way, the Teri
Weigel in front of me was powerful. She had a
control — a brazenncss — about her sexuali
ty I would never attain. Not even if I bought
that "How to Please a Woman Book."
She was powerful because she was real. And
that's why she was disappointing. She also
wasn't all that good looking.
I needed that television set to separate us. I
couldn't invade her privacy once I saw her
face-to-face.
Not without a couple good pairs of latex
gloves.

women into various categories — "face,"
"upper body," "creativity with fruit" — and
rated them from one to 10. Oddly enough nei
ther of us ever joined a fraternity. Or became
an actuary. Go figure.
We also never figured out why they kept
using their index finger to point to their geni
talia. Did they think we couldn't figure out
where it was? It wasn't until years later, a profes
sional therapist and the phrase "clitoral mastur
bation" that it all started making some sense.
I got a call from Joey Banker last week. He
graduated from college in three years and is
enrolled in Dental School. He's also getting
married.
I'm still dealing with that Penthouse.
Not too many years after that first sordid
experience, I had moved on to movies. Movies
with the production value of an XTV project.
But I was able to justify my lechery. After
all, our society is drenched with sex. From

Cosmo to Mickey Rourke movies, the main
focus of much of what goes under the name of
American entertainment is just sex. Pornog
raphy, of course, is also mostly about sex. I was
just being honest about it
Although not much of an exhibitionist my
self since this whole "body hair thing" took me
through a metamorphosis worse than Chevy
Chase in"The Shaggy D.A.," I find something
completely fascinating about the role of the
voyeur. The thought of invasion, of witnessing
the forbidden behind the safe distance of a
television set, made me more excited than
when Norm walks into the bar.
So, last Thursday I had to finally figure out
this whole pornography thing. I had to end
the guilt or decide to live in it—depending on
the cost of admission. Anything under a tithe
and I was in.
I was going to the Mitchell Brothers O'Far
rell Theatre.
For those of you unfamiliar with one of San
Francisco's most significant cultural land
scapes, the Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell The
atre is big. It has several floors and takes up a
good part of a block. It has a tasteful jungle
mural painted on its walls.
A sign at the desk said, in a simple sans
serif font: "This theater will not sell tickets to
anyone wearing shorts."
My friend and I were wearing shorts. But
the man behind the counter said they were
fine, because, fashionable guys that we are,
they were long shorts.
"Just don't want the cow jumping out of the
barn," he explained.
He informed us there were 68 girls inside. I
quickly put out my hand and stopped my
friend from saying "women."

Then he asked for $20.
And I couldn't do it. It wasn't the $20. Al
though the $20 somehow made it more sub
stantive than a $2 rental fee.

It's because it was a freak show. A show de
picting the incomprehensible abilities of a dif
ferent species, revolving around the Freudian
disgust/fascination with female genitalia. And
they were live women. Women I would have
to, at least with eye contact, confront.
Frustrated, more with myself than my cow,
I left. And not more than a block away, was a
sign above the Century Theater. And the sign
read: "Teri Weigel. Live."
Teri Weigel, for those unfamiliar with pop
ular culture, is one of the biggest stars in
today's porn industry. And she was right in
front of us.
I recognized her right away, mostly because
there were about 400 posters ofher in the lobby.
She had just finished "performing" and
was wearing a red, fuzzy wrap-around sweater
which went almost to her knees. She, looked,
well, she looked like a short, badly dressed re
ceptionist from LA.

She turned to the guy behind the desk and
asked him what time it was.
She sounded like a short, badly dressed re
ceptionist from LA.
I wanted so badly to say something to her,
to break through that TV screen which had
separated us for so long. But I had no idea
what to say.
"Hi, Teri. I really like the way..No. Or "I
was just wondering how you ..." No. Or
maybe just "Are you OK?"
I couldn't figure out what I was afraid of.
Was I worried about hurting her feelings? This
is a woman who spends her working hours
smiling at the ejaculate of unattractive men. I
couldn't insult her. Then it struck me.
Objectification.
But that's not why I couldn't talk to her.
I felt like a 13 year-old girl running into
Luke Perry judging pigs at a county fair. I was
star-struck, disappointed and disgusted at the
same time. Kind of like those times I walked in
on my parents having sex. With each other.
In her own childlike, pathetic way, the Teri
Weigel in front of me was powerful. She had a
control — a brazenncss — about her sexuali
ty I would never attain. Not even if I bought
that "How to Please a Woman Book."
She was powerful because she was real. And
that's why she was disappointing. She also
wasn't all that good looking.
I needed that television set to separate us. I
couldn't invade her privacy once I saw her
face-to-face.
Not without a couple good pairs of latex
gloves.

Aphorisms That Smudge
I stopped being friends with Joey Banker in
third grade. Up until then we had a
healthy relationship: Monopoly, Atari,
trick or treating once or twice a year. But in
third grade, Joey insisted on drawing "naked
ladies" in my Puritan company. And, worse
yet, Joey couldn't draw.
Two years later, after Joey lost his Etch-O-
Sketch and I lost my ethics, we patched things
up. Then we found a Penthouse magazine in
my garage.
Less than one week later, Joey and I had al
ready abused the privileges of both his father's
photocopy machine and the copyright laws of
New Jersey.
It didn't take long for us to develop com
plex games with those somewhat blurry, Mat
tissesque mimeographs. We divided these
women into various categories — "face,"
"upper body," "creativity with fruit" — and
rated them from one to 10. Oddly enough nei
