# Freshman arrested on charges of battery
## Student breaks another's nose at dorm party 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
A freshman member of the Stanford
baseball team has been arrested in connec
tion with an alleged assault at a dormitory
party.
Brodie Van Wagenen was booked at
Santa Clara North County Jail on Sunday
on charges of battery stemming from a
melee at Cedro Oct. 16, said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
Van Wagenen was released on his own
recognizance later that day. If convicted of
the felony, he could face up to one year in
county jail.
Van Wagenen allegedly punched another
student at a party in the Cedro lounge,
knocking the student unconscious and "se
verely" breaking his nose, said Niemeyer.
According to Niemeyer, Van Wagenen
arrived at Cedro at approximately 11:45
p.m. with three other students. The group
began "intentionally bumping into other
people" who were dancing.
"They were looking for trouble. . . shoul
dering people pretty hard," Niemeyer said.
"It seems people were somewhat appalled at
their behavior.
"After being bumped into four times,
the victim protested," Niemeyer said.
"Suddenly and without warning he got a
couple punches."

The victim, Scott Francis, was taken to
Stanford Hospital by witnesses.
In a brief interview with The Daily, Fran
cis said he reported the assault that night,
but he declined to discuss any other details
of the case.
Stanford Police investigated the incident
and issued a warrant for Van Wagenen's ar
rest last Friday. Van Wagenen turned him
self in Sunday, Niemeyer said.
Van Wagenen did not return phone calls
from The Daily yesterday.
To what extent Van Wagenen was intox
icated during the assault is unclear,
Niemeyer said. "We have some concessions
that he had consumed some beer before
going to the party."
No court date has been set for Van Wage
nen's arraignment.
Assoc. University Counsel Jennifer
Westerland could not confirm whether the
Office of Judicial Affairs is also investigat
ing the incident. Judicial Affairs Officer
Sally Cole is out of town and was not avail
able for comment.
Cheryl Levick, associate athletic direc
tor, said the Department of Athletics has
been "unofficially notified" of the incident
but has not taken any disciplinary action
against Van Wagenen.
"When we receive official notification
(of the charges), we will investigate the
case and act accordingly," Levick said.
