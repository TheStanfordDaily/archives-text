# Men's group talks about issues of sexual assault
## Looking at rape as 'a man's problem' makes some uncomfortable but is important, members say 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
When junior Matt Mizel created a forum
for men to discuss gender issues, he was
looking for an outlet for his personal frus
tration with the destructive effects of sexu
al assault on both men and women.
"I'm sick of rape," Mizel said. "I'm sick
of it happening to people I know."
Mizel and few other male students are
working to lay the foundation of a weekly
discussion group.

'We're not a bunch of studly
sensitive guys trying to
score points with women.'

Although the group is meant to be cre
ate a "new dynamic" in which males can
examine their own roles and experiences in
society, Mizel wanted issues of sexual as
sault to be a starting point for the discus
sion, he said.
Sophomore Jeff Cory, a group member,
echoed Mizel's concerns, pointing out that
"a lot of people come because sexual as
sault has affected their lives in some way
and they don't want to see other people go
through that pain."
Although some people "get mad" when
people say "rape is a man's problem," Cory
said he wants the group to address the
issue seriously and not just use the expres
sion as a catchphrase.
Cory said members are not going to
preach to men or treat them as possible as
sailants.
"We want to get guys to realize it is a
fundamental part of women's experience

to deal with the fear and reality of sexual
assault," Cory said. "For a lot of men,
'rape' is just a term out there."
Coordinator of Sexual Assault Preven
tion Education Caroline Mitchell said it is
important for men to have a forum in
which they can talk about issues of sexual
assault among themselves.
"Men need to discuss their particular
behavior that promotes and perpetuates
sexual violence towards women, and how
sexual assault hurts them too," she said.
Although the group aims to increase
awareness of sexual assault and gender is
sues among men, Cory emphasized that
the members are "not white knights up in
an ivory tower."
"We're not a bunch of studly sensitive
guys trying to score points with women,"
he said.
Instead, the group promotes discussion
about the role and experience of men in so
ciety, Cory said.
"We're not going to try to indoctrinate
people," he added.
The group has held three Monday-night
meetings so far, with about 10 men attend
ing each one.
While word of mouth and limited adver
tising have brought in only a few new mem
bers, Mizel said he is keeping his expecta
tions high.
"There are 6,000 undergrads, 3,000
who are men, and I'm expecting more
members," he said.
However, Mizel said he is pleased that
"the men who are involved are really ener
getic, involved in what we're doing and
eager to share and learn from each other."
Reflective of the fact that the group has
not determined its exact structure yet, the
members have not chosen an official name,
Mizel said.
In publicizing the group's first
meeting, Mizel chose to call the
group "Against Violence Towards
Women," to generate interest.
Mizel said after the first meet
ing, participants seemed to envi
sion two main goals for the group:
discussion and outreach.
"There are men who are more
interested in exploring ourselves
as men, and some who are intent
on outreach to other men," he
explained.
But these goals are not in con

flict, Mizel said, and he plans to
incorporate both into the group.
Mizel said while he had expect
ed some negative reaction from
people who may not be receptive to
the idea behind the group, he
hasn't encountered any yet.
"In fact, a lot of friends that
haven't talked to me in a while are
calling me to say they think it's
great," he said.
"What's important is that we
welcome any men even if they
have completely different views
than mine," Mizel said.
"I'd love to have that kind of
input," Cory said. "I don't want
the group to be just a bunch of
nodding heads."
