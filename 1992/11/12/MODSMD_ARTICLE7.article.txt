# A 						closer look at relations between Asians and blacks
## Program pitting Ming Dynasty against X-Clan in Family Feud game packs lounge 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
Ujamaa lounge was trans
formed into a mock television stu
dio last night as the "Ming Dy
nasty" and "X-Clan" battled it out
in a heated match of "Family
Feud."
Student contestants vied to
guess the top soul foods, what
Asian parents look for in prospec
tive sons- and daughters-in-laws,
and favorite Rarry Manilow songs.
The feud, with four Asian stu
dents representing Ming Dynasty
and four black students making
up X-Clan, remained fairly com
petitive. A "studio audience" of in
terested students packed the
lounge.
At the end of the half-hour
competition, X-Clan won the
fight.
The winners received gold
medals and the losers got "the

biggest loser of them all"— a
small, stuffed Homer Simpson.
This light-hearted "face-off
between Asians and blacks then
segued into a more serious theme
program hosted by two Ujamaa
residents designed to explore
Asian-black relations in the wake
of the Los Angeles riots last
spring.
"We wanted to start off with a
gameshowjust to get peoplethink
ing," said senior J R. Kang, who
designed the second part of the
program along with Michelle 1 lo to
be a "fairly serious discussion."
The talk was led by the Rev.
Floyd Thompkins, associate dean
of Memorial Church and Rick
Yuen, assistant dean of students
and director of the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center.
"Why are you here?" Reverend
Thompkins asked after he and

Survey says... X-Clan is wrong. In a program exploring Asian-black issues at Ujamaa, Ming Dynasty and
X-Clan compete against each other in a game of Family Feud.
Yuen were introduced. "Why did
you come out here on a cold
night?"
The initially reluctant stu
dents began to express their
interest in learning more about
the interactions between blacks
and Asians, both on campus and
in the nation. Special emphasis
was placed on the Los Angeles
area.
One student said that he saw
race as the most important issue
facing America today.

After describing the riot situa
tion in Los Angeles as the result
of societal neglect, Yuen asked
students what they plan to do
about the issue of race.
It is overwhelming how much
influence our parents and grand
parents have had in shaping our
thoughts, one student said. We
need to teach our children how to
break out of these racist percep
tions, he added.
"I think you can celebrate dif
ferences without romanticizing"
them, another participant said.
An Ujamaa resident expressed
the value of living in a theme
dorm. As a white student from
Concord, Massachusetts — a

wealthy, homogeneous town —
he said he feels that, like his
friends who go to other Eastern
schools, "too many people can
live in their own Concord and go
to Middlebury (College) up in
Vermont."
But here at Stanford, he said
he has been able to interact with a
diverse group of individuals and
has had the chance to attend pro
grams that address pluralist con
cerns.
In a time when the word "mul
ticulturalism" is rarely heard on
campus anymore, many said they
are still very concerned about dif
ferent groups and their mutual
interactions.
