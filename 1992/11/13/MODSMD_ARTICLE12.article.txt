De Klerk impatient with ANC
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) — President F.W. de
Klerk said yesterday his supporters believe the African National
Congress is bent on taking over the country and is responsible for
instigating chronic political violence.
De Klerk told foreign journalists the nation was growing tired of
what he called the ANC's perceived "intemperate and intolerant
style and its vitriolic and pervasive propaganda attacks."
He called for a rapid resumption of political talks on ending
apartheid and white minority rule.
But the killing of another ANC official in Natal Province and
fresh allegations of a covert government bid to harm the ANC pro
voked a harsh reaction from the nation's leading black group.
ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus said the latest reports "proved it
was impossible to negotiate with the government on a basis of trust."
Negotiations involving the white government, the ANC and
other leading political groups broke down in June because of con
tinuing political violence.
Free the foghorns
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — "Beep beep," go the newfangled fog
warning gadgets the Coast Guard installed on San Francisco Bay.
Nuts, say traditionalists who want a return to the old foghorns that
moaned through the mist.
"The foghorns are really mournful and romantic — they're Sam
Spade sidling down the Hyde Street hill in the dripping fog," said
Wayne Wheeler, president of the U.S. Lighthouse Society.
Last week, the last of San Francisco Bay's bellowing sentinels on
Alcatraz Island was replaced by a high-pitched, electronic beeper.
But even the city's board of supervisors wants the old horns
back. They voted unanimously Monday to urge the coast guard and
other federal officials to keep the old foghorns.
