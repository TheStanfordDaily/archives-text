# Clinton vows new jobs
## First news conference promises quick changes 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) - President
elect Bill Clinton yesterday sketched the
first strokes of his government-in-the-mak
ing, saying he would seek tax breaks to cre
ate jobs soon after taking office and reverse
a Bush administration restriction on abor
tion counseling at federally funded clinics.
At his first news conference since Elec
tion Day, the 46-year-old president-elect
promised to lay aside politics, to build a
Cabinet with women, minorities and
Republicans and to end "fingerpointing
and blame" in Washington.
It was Clinton in a new role. A candidate
no longer, he appeared confident and
relaxed as he fielded questions at a nation
ally televised news conference.
Clinton yesterday appointed a diverse
group of 48 aides to his transition team,
including some who had served him dur
ing his campaign. Among them were poli
cy experts who will oversee specific areas,
including the economy and health care.
The president-elect said the economy
would be his first priority. He said he would
ask Congress to approve an investment tax
credit that he said would create 500,000
new jobs within a year, and a stepped-up
program of public works projects.
He also vowed to pursue a "longer-term
economic commitment" and said the voters
who elected him president didn't expect
"overnight miracles."

In addition, Clinton said he would press
ahead with his plan to overturn a govern
ment policy that bans homosexuals from
serving in the military. He also said the so
called gag rule restricting abortion counsel
ing at federally funded family planning
clinics "should be repealed."
Clinton scoffed at Republican sugges
tions that he would take office without a
mandate because he won only 43 percent of
the vote. He noted that Abraham Lincoln
had been elected with under 40 percent.
He appeared with Vice President-elect
A 1 Gore at his side, a joint appearance that
the president-elect said signified a close
relationship that is "perhaps unprecedent
ed but quite good for the country."
Asked whether he would formally ask
Congress for a middle-class tax cut — a
point in his campaign economic program —
Clinton said he had not yet made any
changes in that program, and would let
reporters know if he did.
On the tax credit, Clinton cited a St.
Louis consulting firm study that he said
showed a 10 percent tax credit for the pur
chases of new equipment could generate
500,000 new jobs.
He did not directly respond when asked
whether he would seek $20 billion in accel
erated public works spending, the amount
in his campaign book, or a larger sum of $50
billion that some aides have been urging.
