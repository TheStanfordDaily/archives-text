New First Lady comes
with credentials, looks
to change institution

CLASS PRESIDENT AT
Wellesley, Yale law student,
one of the top 100 most
influential lawyers in America,
Children's Defense Fund board
member — her resume reads like
that of a candidate for attorney gen
eral, chief of staff, even president.
Her next job? First Lady.
Hillary Rodham Clinton had
the last laugh election night as
months of painful dissection of
her marital, professional, academ
ic and personal life culminated in
a win. After all the whispers
about her marriage, the attacks
on her legal writings and the
questions about her commitment
to family values, the lady in the
headband must have felt vindicat
ed. Let her bask in the warmth
now — the salad days will be all
too short.
The mantle she inherits from
Barbara Bush will make life on the
campaign trail seem like the good
old days. She faces a task much
more difficult than any other she
has encountered before: changing
the public's perception of a First
Lady.
In order to maximize her effec
tiveness and remain true to herself,
Clinton will have to redefine a role
traditionally characterized by good
party skills and superficial support
of a "personal" cause.
Hillary brings an independence
and spirit to the office not seen
since the days of Eleanor Roosevelt.
While Roosevelt's influence was
significant, Clinton represents —
more than any of her predecesors
— a truly "self-made woman."
Her every move will be fodder for
front page stories, critical comment
and political salvos in 1996. Nobody
appreciates the two-for-one offer
made by Bill Clinton. Just ask
Nancy or Rosalyn or any of the
other first ladies what happens to

those who aspire to be more than
the First Bedmate.
Yet Hillary stands apart from
these women in that she has too
much to offer to become a presiden
tial ornament. Given the work
she's done with the Children's
Defense Fund, she makes no hollow
claim when she says she wants to
be a voice for children.
She has the experience, innova
tion and farsightedness to make the
Clinton presidency a success; it
would be more than a shame to see
that voice muffled.
She has had to deal with a criti
cal public before. The young femi
nist was forced to take on her hus
band's last name and present more
of the motherly side of herself when
the independent, vocal Hillary was
partially blamed for costing Clinton
the governor's chair.
In Arkansas she played the good
wife role well, juggling social teas
with significant strides in health
care and education reform. She
frosted her hair, baked cookies and
gave Bill "the look" all the way to
the White House.
At each step she has managed to
retreat when necessary, playing the
chameleon well enough to accom
plish her goals. But this time the
stakes are higher and the public eye
won't ever blink.
Hillary will have two choices —
she can acquiesce and become the
quiet, little woman the public has
been taught to expect or she can
take on the tormenting, harsh task
of changing the image of the First
Lady.
If she bites that bullet she will
have altered history. It is unlikely
that Hillary is the last of her kind;
all those after her are likely to also
be accomplished, spirited individu
als, credible and competent in their
own right.
If she proves to America that the
First Lady can help craft the
change and the success promised
by the candidate himself, she will
open the door for her successors to
make contributions of which their
predecessors could have only
dreamed.
