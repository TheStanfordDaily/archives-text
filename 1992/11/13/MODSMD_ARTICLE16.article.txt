## Living a life of pure sin 
### 
CC T3 ED 0R WHITE," I ASKED,
smooth as a baby's bare butt.
-L VThe candles were flickering
under the force of my minty-fresh
breath. I could feel the weight of "the
first date" on my shoulders, breathing
down my neck like an angry beast, and I
made a mental note to remember to wear
my Depend undergarment next time.
"Neither, thanks," she replied. The
little vixen was being coy, trying not to
spend too much of my parents' hard
earned money.
"Well, we could just get a glass," I
shot back. Child's play.
"No, thanks. I actually don't drink,"
she said primly.
Okay, so there would be no social
enema. I would have to make up for it
with brilliant conversation, but it was
nothing I couldn't handle. I was a cool
dude in a loose mood. The next line had
to be simultaneously suave and witty,
something to ease the tension in the air.
My sharp mind quickly rifled through a
list of possibilities, selected the best one
and my mouth said,
"Hey, at least you're not a Mormon,
heh-heh."
Silence. Dead silence. Five seconds. 10
seconds. 15.
"I am a Mormon," she whispered,
looking down at her menu.
"Whoops," I croaked. There was a
whole shoe store in my mouth, and onlv

one thought in my head: I was going to
hell.
After 20 years of sin, this was it. My
coup de grace, as it were. I always knew I
was standing on the edge, perhaps hang
ing from it, but this was the clincher. I
was going to burn in eternal damnation,
and not even my brother in divinity
school could help me.
My adolescence was fraught with mis
conduct. I remember spending untold
hours only inches from the television,
praying that Daisy Duke's jeep would
blow a tire so I could watch her bend over
in those super-short jean cut-offs. Every
time I slept over at my buddy Anus'
house, we would jimmy a nail in the back
of the cable box so that we could watch
the Playboy channel until it shut off at 6
a.m.
If masturbation is a sin, then I've
been doomed since I turned 13. It wasn't
until I got to the Farm, though, that I
finally reached the apogee of moral
depravity.
Over the last four years, in attempts
to weasel sympathy and extensions out
of teachers, my parents have had to die
three times, my computer has exploded
four times, and I have had serious cases
of gout, rickets, bubonic plague, amoebic
dysentery, Lyme disease and heavy men
strual cramps, to name just a few.
My academic decisions have been
made predominantly by my throbbing id.

I've taken Human Sexuality, Clay Mod
eling (I feigned blindness just so I could
grope the nude models) and Sleep and
Dreams ("Professor, what does it mean if
in my dream I was making love with a
monkey?").
As I dropped her off at her dorm, I
began to imagine how she would have
introduced me to her parents: "Mommy
and Daddy, this is my booze-swilling,
class-skipping, lie-telling, open-mouth
kissing, sex-craving boyfriend, Pete. You
should see the funny tricks he can do
with his spit."
While her parents might not approve
of my final destination, I have come to
grips with it and am even starting to look
forward to it.
Think about it. Summer all year
round. Nowhere to go but up. You can go
out and whoop it up with the Marquis de
Sade while Father Bruce Ritter watches
your kids. Guilt-free sex, drugs and rock
and roll. After all, where are they going
to send you if you're bad? And people call
Stanford paradise.
