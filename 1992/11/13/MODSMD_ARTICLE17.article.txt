Class presidents stay up late cleaning, deserve title

WE ARE WRITING IN response
to The Daily's editorial on Nov.
9 over the title of Senior Class
presidents.
As this year's Senior Class presi
dents, we are very insulted by your
views of the presidency and your failure
to take into account the many leader
ship roles that this job entails. As
Senior Class presidents, we have deci
sion making power by sitting on boards
and meetings with the administration.
Not only do we represent the senior
class in many of these meetings, but
many times we represent Stanford stu
dents in general.
Two of us are sitting on the gradua
tion board whose duties include input
on the planning of graduation and the
choosing of a graduation speaker.

Another one us sits as the only stu
dent on the Board of Trustees of the
Stanford Alumni Association. In these
meetings we serve as regular members
whose input into the decisions are just
as important as other members, if not
more so, given that we represent the
views of the student body.
In addition, you do not take into
account any of the initiatives of this
year's presidents. You claim that
"Senior Class presidents are expected
merely to pick a bar for weekly pub
nights, to put on a week of 4Dis-Orienta
tion' in the spring and shop for a part
ing gift to give to the school. .
However, we have shown true leader
ship this year by not only keeping tradi
tional events but also by having the
foresight to realize what seniors need.

In order to keep drunk seniors off the
road, we have installed the pub night
shuttle service. If you still think we are
a bunch of resume stuffers, watch on
Thursday nights when many times it is
us driving the vans.
We have also sponsored a Brown Bag
Lunch Series with the Career Planning
and Placement Center and the Under
graduate Advising Center to help
seniors with their lives after gradua
tion. In addition to traditional pub
nights, we have found alternative pub
nights.
You scoff at the abilities needed to
put on pub nights and the Mausoleum
party and say that we should be called
"social coordinators" â€” a name which
might not be so bad except for the nega
tive connotation you place on such a

role.
Did you take into account the leader
ship ability needed in order to organize
events such as the Mausoleum party?
From the large details such as publicity,
set up and clean up, to the little details
such as providing electrical generators,
security and personally cleaning up
until 4 a.m., all these details and more
need to be considered in order for any
event to occur, let alone occur smoothly.
Please do not belittle the work that
went into organizing events such as the
Mausoleum party until you have
planned a similar event.
