# Medication not really cause of woman's death

We would like to respond to the arti
cle headlined "Taxol treatment fails,
cheerleader dies. . ." from the front
page of Tuesday's Daily. We are the
physicians who treated Valerie Pida
and administered taxol under an exper
imental protocol.
Contrary to the headline, taxol treat
ment did not fail. There was clear
objective evidence that Pida's
Hodgkin's Disease was going into
remission after two cycles of taxol ther
apy, and she was about to receive a
third course of treatment when her
infection occurred. This infection was
not in any way related to the taxol, but
was a consequence of her prior splenec
tomy and disease state.
Pida was a brave patient who had
battled Hodgkin's Disease for many
years. Although at this stage her dis
ease was incurable, she was definitely

benefitting from this experimental
therapy. We would hope that The Daily
staff would at least be more accurate
when sensationalizing a patient's
unfortunate death.
