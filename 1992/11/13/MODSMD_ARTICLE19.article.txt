# One semi-nude picture deserves another one

I am greatly appalled and disgusted by
your photograph of Cardinal fullback
J.J. Lasley which appeared in the Nov. 7
sports section. The full-frontal, semi
nude, portrait of this football standout
served no purpose except to turn heads
— either towards or away from — this
blatant objectification of the human
body.
Why does The Daily, a highly rep
utable student publication, find it neces

sary to celebrate the male physique in
such an astonishing fashion? And why,
on a campus of such diversity and intel
lectual prowess, does The Daily choose
to glorify the body of a sports star?
Indeed, Stanford rightfully takes
pride in its reputation as an athletic
powerhouse. But it also plays a role as
one of the world's dominant political
institutions; therefore The Daily should
honor its heroes in all fields — the arts,
the sciences, the professions — with
equal attention.
If The Daily intends to keep its read
ers — and to respect the heterogeneity
and intellectual capacities of those read
ers — it should consider extending equal
consideration to all members of the
Stanford community.
The anatomy of a Stanford athlete
deserves no greater examination than
does the anatomy of a Stanford intellec
tual. I am pleased to share with you
mine (see right).
