### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
After 32 years at Stanford, Ray Bac
chetti — whose position as vice president
for planning and management was elimi
nated in September's administrative
shake-up — is moving to the Hewlett
Foundation to serve as its education pro
gram officer.
The foundation's education program
focuses primarily on donating to kinder
garten through 12th-grade programs
and to universities, said Bacchetti, who
had been asked to stay with Stanford in
another capacity. The Hewlett program
grants approximately $9 million annual
ly to educational activities.
The Menlo Park-based foundation
targets university and high school li
braries around the country as well as for
eign exchange programs, particularly
those between the United States and

Mexico, he said.
When told that people were curious
about his new position, Bacchetti replied,
"So am 1.1 have been reading and getting
caught up on books on education to pre
pare for this job."
"The Foundation will have a new pres
ident next year," he said. "I expect to be
defining my position to a large extent my
self."
William Hewlett started the founda
tion with $2.5 million in 1977. Since
then, its assets have risen to $800 mil
lion, making it one of the 10 richest foun
dations in the country.
The foundation's grants are divided
among seven areas, including education,
environmental issues and families, Bac
chetti explained. It grants approximately
$35 million annually.
Throughout his years at Stanford,
Bacchetti has held a variety of positions
beginning with assistant dean of human

ities and sciences in 1960. In 1982 he re
ceived the Kenneth M. Cuthberston
Award for exceptional service to the Uni
versity. He was appointed vice president
in 1991.
In addition, Bacchetti has served as
the administrative representative to the
Faculty Senate and worked as a part
time lecturer in the School of Education.
Bacchetti, who earned his doctorate
in education at Stanford in 1968, has
also been active in promoting education
outside of the University. He taught ele
mentary school for two years and served
as a trustee of the Foothill-DeAnza Com
munity College District and a board
member of the Palo Alto Unified School
District.
Bacchetti's job was eliminated under
University President Gerhard Casper's
administrative restructuring. His office
was placed under the supervision of Chief
Financial Officer Peter Van Etten.
