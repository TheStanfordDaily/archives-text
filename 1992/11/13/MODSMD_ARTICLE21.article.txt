## Pac-10 picture might be focused after Cougar clash 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
Undeniably college football's most
powerful conference, the Pacific 10
has had at least five of its members in
the nation's top 25 virtually all season.
Six teams will likely earn bowl berths,
and the conference's record against
nonconference opponents has been a
dominating 21-7-1. Even its ninth
place team, UCLA, was at one point in
the early season ranked No. 11.
With just two weeks remaining in
the regular season schedule, here's a
look at how the Cardinal's conference
foes have fared:
• Washington (8-1, 5-1 first in
the Pac-10, ranked No. 6). Remain
ing schedule: OREGON STATE, at
Washington State.
While the potential for a 10-win sea
son would be a dream come true for
most teams, the Huskies already con
sider this year a disappointment.
Granted, they can still clinch their
third consecutive Rose Bowl berth
with wins in their final two games.
But, from day one of the 1992 season,
they've had their sights set on a sec
ond consecutive national champi
onship.
After climbing back into the top
spot in the polls with a thrashing of
Stanford, their title hopes were dashed
by Arizona in a stunning upset last
weekend.
Further, the school was rocked by
scandal in the week preceding the
game in Tucson. Quarterback Billy Joe
Hobert (the backup in coach Don
James' rotational system) was
revealed to have accepted a $50,000
loan last spring, which immediately
raised questions of eligibility.
At the time of the kickoff in Ari
zona, Hobert had been temporarily
suspended by the university, and there
was still a question as to whether the
team would be forced to forfeit all
eight games in which Hobert had
played.
In the days since, Hobert has been
banned for the year and all signs are
that the Huskies will not be forced to
forfeit any of their wins. But the melo
drama probably had more than a little
to do with Washington's first loss in 23
games.
• Arizona (6-2-1, 4-1-1 second in
the Pac-10, ranked No. 9). Remain
ing schedule: at USC, ARIZONA

STATE.
If there's one team in college foot
ball that desperately wishes there
were a national playoff, it's the Ari
zona Wildcats. They're playing the
best football in country right now, bar
none.
Arizona has been the NCAA's
biggest surprise — having knocked off
then-No. 1 Washington 16-3 and com
ing within a point of beating top
ranked Miami on the Hurricanes'
home turf — especially considering
their miserable first month.
After a start that included a home
loss to Washington State and a tie with
lowly Oregon State, the Wildcats — led
by their "Desert Swarm" defense —
have compiled five consecutive wins.
They have their sights set on a New
Year's Day appearance, and could vir
tually lock one up with two wins.
If Washington falls to its intrastate
rival next week, the Wildcats could
even sneak into the Rose Bowl if they
finish 6-1-1 in conference.
• Stanford (7-3, 4-2 tied for
third in the Pac-10, No. 15).
Remaining schedule: WASHINGTON
STATE, at Weenies.
OK, here's the bowl lowdown for
the very, very last time . . . that is, at
least, until next week:
If Stanford wins its next two, they
will finish either second (if Arizona
loses one of its last two) or third (if
'Zona wins both).
One of the bowls from the
"Alliance" — almost certainly the
Fiesta — will take a second team from
the Pac-10 (supposedly, but not neces
sarily, the second place team). The

third (place?) team goes to the Free
dom Bowl.
So even if Stanford finishes third, it
could avoid the Freedom, but it's not
likely. In other words, Cardinal fans
would do well to root for USC and
hope for two Stanford wins.
• USC (5-2-1, 4-2 third for in the
Pac-10, No. 18). Remaining schedule:
ARIZONA, at UCLA, NOTRE DAME.
The Trojans looked like a top-10
team before falling to Stanford last
weekend. With a challenging finishing
schedule in front of them, USC has the
chance to climb back into that top 10.
On the other hand, they could easily
tailspin to a .500 regular season
record.
Beating Arizona and UCLA would
probably leave the Trojans third and
send them down the road to Anaheim
for the Freedom Bowl. Much rides on
the shoulders of Rob Johnson, who
must bounce back from a miserable
performance against the Cardinal if
USC is to have any chance against the
three strong defenses that lie ahead.
• Washington State (7-2, 4-2
tied for third in the Pac-10, No.
21). Remaining schedule: at Stanford,
WASHINGTON.
The Cougars surprised everyone by
getting off to a 6-0 start and climbing
to No. 13 in the polls. The Northwest
was alive with the talk of an end-of
the-season Apple Cup to decide the
Rose Bowl berth.
But Washington State and its high
powered offense stalled in consecutive
weeks as they were beaten by USC and
upstart Oregon. The Cougars come to
Stanford this weekend with a bowl bid
likely secured, but two consecutive
losses would make the Independence,
er, Weed Eater Bowl a good bet.
• Oregon (5-4, 3-3 sixth in the
Pac-10). Remaining schedule: UCLA,
at Oregon State.
The early season trouble the Ducks
gave Stanford was no fluke. All four of
Oregon's losses have come at the
hands of top 25 teams.
The Ducks pulled off impressive
wins over Washington State and Cal in
the last two weeks, and with only the
conference cellar dwellers left on the
schedule, this looks like a 7-4 bowl
team.
• Arizona State (4-5, 2-4 tied for
seventh in the Pac-10). Remaining

play.
schedule: CAL, at Arizona.
Off-field felonies have gar
nered as many headlines as the
play of Bruce Snyder's Sun Dev
ils this season.
In his first year after bolting
from Cal, Snyder has worked no
miracles. Arizona State has
beaten those they should beat,
and lost to those they should
lose to. As a result, they will
spend the holiday season at
home.
• Cal (4-5, 2-4 tied for sev

BIG GAME.
First year coach Keith
Gilbertson has not brought suc
cess with him from Washington.
The Bears were a consensus
top-20 team in the preseason
polls. They were blown out by a
miserable Purdue team early in

the season, and have never hit
full stride.
Not to mention, they've been
Axe-less for five years . . . and
counting.
• UCLA (4-5, 1-5 ninth in
the Pac-10). Remaining sched
ule: at Oregon, USC.
The Bruins have been far and
away the conference's biggest
disappointment.
Injuries have decimated an
offense that was already inexpe
rienced. After UCLA started 3-0
and climbed high in the polls,
that offense hit rock bottom. In
its five conference losses, the
Bruins have averaged less than
eight points per game.
• Oregon State (1-7-1, 0-5-
1 10th in the Pac-10).
Remaining schedule: at Wash
ington, OREGON.
The Beavers are last in the
conference in total offense, last
in the conference total defense
and they're having their best
season in recent memory. 'Nuff

the Pac-10). Remaining sched
ule: at Oregon, USC.
The Bruins have been far and
away the conference's biggest
disappointment.
Injuries have decimated an
offense that was already inexpe
rienced. After UCLA started 3-0
and climbed high in the polls,
that offense hit rock bottom. In
its five conference losses, the
Bruins have averaged less than
eight points per game.
• Oregon State (1-7-1, 0-5-
1 10th in the Pac-10).
Remaining schedule: at Wash
ington, OREGON.
The Beavers are last in the
conference in total offense, last
in the conference total defense
and they're having their best
season in recent memory. 'Nuff
said.
Undeniably college football's most
powerful conference, the Pacific 10
has had at least five of its members in
the nation's top 25 virtually all season.
Six teams will likely earn bowl berths,
and the conference's record against
nonconference opponents has been a
dominating 21-7-1. Even its ninth
place team, UCLA, was at one point in
the early season ranked No. 11.
With just two weeks remaining in
the regular season schedule, here's a
look at how the Cardinal's conference
foes have fared:
• Washington (8-1, 5-1 first in
the Pac-10, ranked No. 6). Remain
ing schedule: OREGON STATE, at
Washington State.
While the potential for a 10-win sea
son would be a dream come true for
most teams, the Huskies already con
sider this year a disappointment.
Granted, they can still clinch their
third consecutive Rose Bowl berth
with wins in their final two games.
But, from day one of the 1992 season,
they've had their sights set on a sec
ond consecutive national champi
onship.
After climbing back into the top
spot in the polls with a thrashing of
Stanford, their title hopes were dashed
by Arizona in a stunning upset last
weekend.
Further, the school was rocked by
scandal in the week preceding the
game in Tucson. Quarterback Billy Joe
Hobert (the backup in coach Don
James' rotational system) was
revealed to have accepted a $50,000
loan last spring, which immediately
raised questions of eligibility.
At the time of the kickoff in Ari
zona, Hobert had been temporarily
suspended by the university, and there
was still a question as to whether the
team would be forced to forfeit all
eight games in which Hobert had
played.
In the days since, Hobert has been
banned for the year and all signs are
that the Huskies will not be forced to
forfeit any of their wins. But the melo
drama probably had more than a little
to do with Washington's first loss in 23
games.
• Arizona (6-2-1, 4-1-1 second in
the Pac-10, ranked No. 9). Remain
ing schedule: at USC, ARIZONA

STATE.
If there's one team in college foot
ball that desperately wishes there
were a national playoff, it's the Ari
zona Wildcats. They're playing the
best football in country right now, bar
none.
Arizona has been the NCAA's
biggest surprise — having knocked off
then-No. 1 Washington 16-3 and com
ing within a point of beating top
ranked Miami on the Hurricanes'
home turf — especially considering
their miserable first month.
After a start that included a home
loss to Washington State and a tie with
lowly Oregon State, the Wildcats — led
by their "Desert Swarm" defense —
have compiled five consecutive wins.
They have their sights set on a New
Year's Day appearance, and could vir
tually lock one up with two wins.
If Washington falls to its intrastate
rival next week, the Wildcats could
even sneak into the Rose Bowl if they
finish 6-1-1 in conference.
• Stanford (7-3, 4-2 tied for
third in the Pac-10, No. 15).
Remaining schedule: WASHINGTON
STATE, at Weenies.
OK, here's the bowl lowdown for
the very, very last time . . . that is, at
least, until next week:
If Stanford wins its next two, they
will finish either second (if Arizona
loses one of its last two) or third (if
'Zona wins both).
One of the bowls from the
"Alliance" — almost certainly the
Fiesta — will take a second team from
the Pac-10 (supposedly, but not neces
sarily, the second place team). The

third (place?) team goes to the Free
dom Bowl.
So even if Stanford finishes third, it
could avoid the Freedom, but it's not
likely. In other words, Cardinal fans
would do well to root for USC and
hope for two Stanford wins.
• USC (5-2-1, 4-2 third for in the
Pac-10, No. 18). Remaining schedule:
ARIZONA, at UCLA, NOTRE DAME.
The Trojans looked like a top-10
team before falling to Stanford last
weekend. With a challenging finishing
schedule in front of them, USC has the
chance to climb back into that top 10.
On the other hand, they could easily
tailspin to a .500 regular season
record.
Beating Arizona and UCLA would
probably leave the Trojans third and
send them down the road to Anaheim
for the Freedom Bowl. Much rides on
the shoulders of Rob Johnson, who
must bounce back from a miserable
performance against the Cardinal if
USC is to have any chance against the
three strong defenses that lie ahead.
• Washington State (7-2, 4-2
tied for third in the Pac-10, No.
21). Remaining schedule: at Stanford,
WASHINGTON.
The Cougars surprised everyone by
getting off to a 6-0 start and climbing
to No. 13 in the polls. The Northwest
was alive with the talk of an end-of
the-season Apple Cup to decide the
Rose Bowl berth.
But Washington State and its high
powered offense stalled in consecutive
weeks as they were beaten by USC and
upstart Oregon. The Cougars come to
Stanford this weekend with a bowl bid
likely secured, but two consecutive
losses would make the Independence,
er, Weed Eater Bowl a good bet.
• Oregon (5-4, 3-3 sixth in the
Pac-10). Remaining schedule: UCLA,
at Oregon State.
The early season trouble the Ducks
gave Stanford was no fluke. All four of
Oregon's losses have come at the
hands of top 25 teams.
The Ducks pulled off impressive
wins over Washington State and Cal in
the last two weeks, and with only the
conference cellar dwellers left on the
schedule, this looks like a 7-4 bowl
team.
• Arizona State (4-5, 2-4 tied for

beaten those they should beat,
and lost to those they should
lose to. As a result, they will
spend the holiday season at
home.
• Cal (4-5, 2-4 tied for sev
enth in the Pac-10). Remain
ing schedule: at Arizona State,
BIG GAME.
First year coach Keith
Gilbertson has not brought suc
cess with him from Washington.
The Bears were a consensus
top-20 team in the preseason
polls. They were blown out by a
miserable Purdue team early in

the season, and have never hit
full stride.
Not to mention, they've been
Axe-less for five years . . . and
counting.
• UCLA (4-5, 1-5 ninth in
the Pac-10). Remaining sched
ule: at Oregon, USC.
The Bruins have been far and
away the conference's biggest
disappointment.
Injuries have decimated an
offense that was already inexpe
rienced. After UCLA started 3-0
and climbed high in the polls,
that offense hit rock bottom. In
its five conference losses, the
Bruins have averaged less than
eight points per game.
• Oregon State (1-7-1, 0-5-
1 10th in the Pac-10).
Remaining schedule: at Wash
ington, OREGON.
The Beavers are last in the
conference in total offense, last
in the conference total defense
and they're having their best
season in recent memory. 'Nuff
said.
