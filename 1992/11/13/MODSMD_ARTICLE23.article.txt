# Best in West set to clash: Cardinal vs. Santa Clara
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
When the No. 4 Stanford women's
soccer team battles No. 6 Santa Clara
in the NCAA quarterfinals at 1 p.m. on
Sunday, intensity and composure will
likely determine the winner.
In last year's regular season loss to
the Broncos, the Cardinal was unset
tled by Santa Clara, who was able to
force Stanford into playing individual
ly instead of the team-focused game
that coach Berhane Andeberhan
emphasizes.
But in the playoffs, the Cardinal
returned the favor with a 2-1 win
fueled by Jen Potok's two scores. In
that game, the Stanford players stayed
intense but under control and were
able to outplay the Broncos.
Andeberhan hopes Stanford can
continue its postseason success
against the Cardinal's Bay Area rival,
who tied Stanford 1-1 earlier this sea
son.
"We played well the last time," he
said. "But we were unable to sustain
it. That's what we need to do this
weekend."
For this Bronco clash, the Cardinal
may have put everything together at
just the right time. In last week's 5-2
blowout of Portland, the team stuck to
its game plan, even when the squad fell
down 2-0.
At other times in the season, the
Cardinal has faltered after getting
behind, but on Sunday Stanford
patiently kept to the attack and scored
five unanswered goals to notch the

program's second-ever NCAA tourney
win.
"That was the first time this season
that they've kept the intensity
throughout the game," Andeberhan
said.
"That was a phenomenal game. If
we play 80-90 percent as well and sus
tain it, then I'd feel very good about
our chances (against Santa Clara)."
One problem which plagued the
Cardinal in the Portland match was
that several passes got through to the
Pilot forwards on breakaways.
"Against Santa Clara we'll need to
dry up the source of their through
passes," said Andeberhan, who added
that the Stanford forwards will be
responsible for keeping the Bronco
fullbacks from connecting with the for
wards.
Despite the Cardinal's hot play of
late, one factor which falls in favor of
Santa Clara is playoff experience.
Stanford has never made it past the
NCAA quarterfinals, while the Bron
cos have reached the Final Four in two
of the past three years. Midfielder
Shannon Douglas, goalkeeper Sue Wall
and forward Debbie Norbutas have all
played in two NCAA semifinals, which
they lost both times.
Wall will pose a test for Cardinal
attackers as she is one of the top keep
ers in the West. The senior has posted
10 shutouts on the season and boasts a
0.76 goals against average.
Norbutas leads the Broncos on
offense with 11 goals and 4 assists. She
is also Santa Clara's go-to player in the
clutch, as she's notched 5 game-win
ning goals. However, Norbutas has
never scored in five postseason match
es, which bodes ill for the Broncos,
who are 8-1 this year when she's
scored, and 3-3-2 when she hasn't.
Even with an experience-laden
team, Santa Clara may have a tough
time rattling the younger Stanford
squad. According to Andeberhan, the
blowout of Portland gave the team a
big boost in confidence.
"The team is a lot calmer emotional
ly," he said. "They're working hard
but they're not hyper. If I'm reading it
correctly, it's a quiet confidence."
That confidence could lead to a trip
to the Final Four. The winner of Sun
day's showdown will face either North
Carolina or William and Mary in next
weekend's NCAA semifinals.
