SUNDAY â€” Stanford vs. Santa Clara, 1
p.m. at Maloney Field
NOTES - No. 4 Stanford (17-1-1)
faces No. 6 Santa Clara (11 -4-2) in an
NCAA quarterfinal match. The winner
will play either North Carolina or
William and Mary in the NCAA semifi
nals.
Unless Stanford is chosen as the site
of the Final Four (an unlikely possibil
ity because most teams are on the
East Coast), this match will be the last
Maloney Field appearance for seniors
