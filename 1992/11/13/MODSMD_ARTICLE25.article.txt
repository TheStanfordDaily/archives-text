# District 8's may '86' cross country
## Young Cardinal must improve against Pac-10 foes, others in desert 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
For the men and women's cross
country teams, six months of hard
work culminate at the District 8 NCAA
Qualifying Meet tomorrow in Arizona.
The District 8 Meet consists of all
the Pacific 10 Conference teams and
several other Division I teams in this
region. The most notable of these non
conference teams are UC-Irvine, Long
Beach State and Portland.
Tomorrow's races determine the
length of the Cardinal cross country
season — the team either runs well
enough to qualify for the NCAA Cham
pionships next weekend or its season
ends.
To qualify as a team, Stanford needs
to place either first or second for an
automatic bid, or place third and per
haps receive one of the at-large bids
(there are six at-large bids for the eight
women's districts and three at-large
bids for the eight men's districts).
According to head coach Vin Lanan
na, "This district is the deepest and
most competitive in the country," so
the chances of either Cardinal squad of

'As for an overall assess
ment, both teams are in
good position to have
shots at going to the
NCAA's.'

qualifying is an "outside shot, although
not out of the realm of possibilities."
The predicted order of finish is simi
lar to that for the Pac-10 Champi
onships (where both Stanford teams
placed fourth) since it is unlikely that
one of the teams that did not compete
in Pac-10's will break into the top
three.
In order to qualify, the Stanford
women need to have an outstanding
race, while the men not only need to
have an outstanding race, but to hope
for one of the top men's teams to run
poorly.
"As for an overall assessment, both
teams are in good position to have shots

at going to the NCAA's," Lananna said.
"This is a tremendous improvement
from where we started at the beginning
of the season, and the improvement is
due to the hard work of both teams."
There is, however, a much greater
chance the Cardinal will have individu
al qualifiers. To qualify individually, a
runner needs to place among the top
three runners who do not qualify with
their teams. Thus, hopes are high that
both Gary Stolz (who placed third at
Pac-10's) and Louise Watson (who
placed second) will represent the Cardi
nal at the NCAA Championships.
For the women, the race consists of
the usual five kilometers, while the
men's race increases from 8K to 10K.
This 1-1/4 mile increase should help the
Stanford men, who are more distance
oriented. "We're a lot stronger as a
team," Stolz said. "The high mileage
should help because we're strong
rather than fast."
The overwhelming favorites on both
the men's and women's sides are Ore
gon and Arizona, while the individual
favorites are Pac-10 champions Joe
Kapkory from Washington State and
Oregon's Nicole Woodward.
