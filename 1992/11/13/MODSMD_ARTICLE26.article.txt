### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
After trouncing Pacific 10 Confer
ence rivals Arizona and Arizona State
in record-breaking fashion last week
end, the No. 2 Stanford women's vol
leyball team is ready to take its act on
the road for the last time in conference
play this season. The Cardinal (20-2,
13-2 in Pac-10 play) travels this week
end to face Washington and No. 21
Washington State, two teams who find
themselves in must-win situations to
reach the NCAA tournament.
"They're both in the hunt," Stan
ford head coach Don Shaw said, "so
we'll see them with they're backs to the
wall. We'll just need to go in and take
care of business."
Washington (9-9, 6-7 in Pac-10 play)
comes into tonight's match hot off an
upset of Washington State, partly as a
result of key lineup changes at the set
ter position. Shaw is confident of Stan
ford's chances against the unranked
Huskies, but is wary of the hot-and
cold play which characterizes the
squad.
"Their lineup is a concern — it's

something different we haven't seen
before," Shaw said. "Everything may
click for them, so we have to be ready
for them and make adjustments as
needed."
Stanford swept Washington in the
two teams' last meeting on Oct. 17 at
Maples Pavilion, 15-4, 15-9, 15-8.
Senior tri-captain Bev Oden led the
Cardinal in that match with 14 kills,
eight digs, seven blocks, and a .345 hit
ting percentage. Senior Kristi Paaso
hit .435 with 12 kills and six digs, while
freshman Cary Wendell added 11 kills
and five digs with a .333 average.
Sophomore Dragana Djordjevic led
the Huskies with 12 kills and five digs
in that match. Washington was held to
a .060 hitting percentage as a team,
while Stanford compiled a .351 average
with only 14 hitting errors all match.
On Saturday, Stanford will travel to
Pullman to face Washington State. The
Cougars occupy fifth place in the Pac
-10, a game ahead of Washington and a
game behind fourth-place Arizona
State. Washington State is looking to
win at least three of its last four to stay
in contention for an NCAA berth, so
Shaw expects a difficult match from

the Cougars.
"It's going to bo a tough match up
there, and it always is," Shaw said.
"They're a good team, and they'll have
extra motivation to win, so we might be
in for a rough night."
Washington took the Cardinal to
four games on Oct. 16, but Stanford
pulled out the win, 15-8, 10-15, 15-6,
15-5. Oden racked up 22 kills and seven
digs to lead Stanford in that match.
Wendell laid down 17 kills and 16 digs,
while Paaso contributed 11 kills and 6
digs. Senior tri-captain Carrie Feldman
also rang up a season-high 65 assists.
Five players registered double digits
in kills for the Cougars in that match,
and three players hit over .400, but
Stanford outhit WSU as a team .415 to
.310. Shaw said he expects more of the
same from the Cougars Saturday
night.
"They hit well the last time they
played us — we just happened to hit
better," Shaw said. "We're hoping to
have better defensive adjustment than
we had against them last time, contin
ue to get sideouts and make the most of
every opportunity that comes our
way."
