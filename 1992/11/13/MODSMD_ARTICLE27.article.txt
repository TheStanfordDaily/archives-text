# Ex-Hoosier Russell at home in NCAA tournament
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Last year, while the Stanford men's soccer team
sat at home lamenting its first round loss to Santa
Clara, Joel Russell and his Indiana Hoosiers blazed
through the NCAA Tournament with flying colors.
However, after Indiana's streak ended in the Final
Four, Russell surprisingly decided to hang up his
Hoosier red in favor of Cardinal red.
It might have been destiny for Russell, a Michigan
high school star, to become a Cardinal. After all, he
was former Stanford head coach Sam Koch's No. 1
recruit two years ago before he accepted an athletic
scholarship from nearby Indiana.
At that time, he was one of the nation's premier
prospects as he headed the 17-and-under national
team to a victory over Brazil in the Junior World Cup.
After signing with the Hoosiers, Russell went on to be
a part of an Indiana team which advanced to the quar
terfinals of the Tournament during his freshman
year and to the semifinals in his sophomore year.
When prodded for a reason why he left one of the
nation's strongest soccer powerhouses for Stanford's
fledgling soccer tradition, Russell simply said he
needed a change.
"Indiana got old and small. I just wanted to try
something new. Right now, Stanford is building a soc
cer tradition, and I want to be a part of that. I wouldn't
have come if Stanford had no chance of making the
playoffs. I came because I saw that this team had the
talent to become a strong national contender."
Fifth-seeded Stanford (12-7-1) will enter the tour
ney this Saturday against the fourth-seeded San Diego
Torreros (15-4-0) in a single-elimination contest.
While most of the Cardinal booters have only one
game of playoff experience, Russell, a junior mid
fielder, will head into this weekend's match with 10
games of tournament play under his belt.

"Joel's playoff experience and overall confidence is
a tremendous asset to this team," said head coach
Colin Lindores. "Last year our players made it this far
for the first time, and they were just happy to be in
[the Tournament!. But this year, with Joel's intensi
ty, I think the team's more focused on winning and
building a Stanford tradition in the NCAA playoffs."
Russell, who has been a stabilizing factor in the
midfield all year long, is modest about his impact on
the squad. "The team doesn't have the playoff expe
rience, but I can see it being a strong contender in
our division. I just hope that I can add that little
extha something to put us over the top.
"I might be a little too intense sometimes. I'm a
rough and tumble type of guy, real Midwestern and
some of the guys aren't used to me being a little
rough on the edges. Most of the guys on the team are
also equally intense, but in different ways; I think
that mentality will carry us through the playoffs."
Undoubtedly, Russell hopes Stanford advances to
the Final Four and beyond, but he has also consid
ered the possibility of meeting up with his Hoosier
teammates in the third round.
"It's possible that we will get to play them,
because they somehow threw Indiana into the West
ern Region," Russell said. "And if we do get to the
third round I would like to play against them. I'd like
to play Indiana in Bloomington, and it'd give me
great pleasure to beat Indiana in Bloomington."
His Cardinal conviction wavered a little when he
continued, "I really like Indiana, and I hope they win
all their games this year, except one. But generally, if
we can't win it all, I hope they do.
"After my college career ends I'd like to stay in
soccer, perhaps as the head coach at Indiana."
Russell, however, amended, "But, 20 years down
the line I wouldn't mind taking over Colin's job
either. I'll always be part Hoosier, but my number
one team will always be Stanford."
