This weekend, the lOth-ranked Stanford
women's golf team travels to the prestigious
Golf World/Palmetto Dunes Collegiate Tour
nament in Hilton Head, SC. Starting today,
the linksters will face their toughest field of
competition this season.
Junior Melinda Daniels starts in the No. 1
spot for the Cardinal. Daniels is coming off a
frustrating ninth-place finish in last week's
UCLA Intercollegiate. Martha Richards, a
fifth-year senior, and Jamille Jose, a sopho
more, occupy the Nos. 2 and 3 spots, respec
tively. Freshman Vicky Strada starts fourth
for Stanford, and, in yet another lineup shift,
sophomore Amy Lawrence makes the trip to
South Carolina in the fifth spot.
"The starting lineup is based on last week's
performance," said head coach Tim Baldwin.
However, freshman Kathryn Weber, who
started for the Cardinal in the last two tour
naments, has been given some time off from
the schedule of competition to improve her
game, according to Baldwin.

'This is one of the best
[courses] we play on. There
is a lot of water, trees and
sand.'

The field at the Golf World tournament
should be the most competitive in the Cardi
nal's short fall season. Though San Jose State
and Georgia have finished their fall schedules
and will not be present, the rest of the top 10
teams have assembled for this invitational
tournament. Oklahoma State, Duke, Arizona
State, UCLA, Miami (Fla.), Tulsa and Fur
man are ranked third through ninth, respec
tively, in the Golf World coaches' poll. Each
squad looks to take home a victory in the
match, called "one of the premiere tourna
ments of the year" by Baldwin.
Also absent is Arizona, which suffers from
every coach's nightmare: the squad's two top

women linksters just entered the ranks of pro
fessional golf, thereby forgoing any further
amateur competition.
In last year's tournament, Tulsa took home
the team trophy, while Stanford senior Adele
Moore won the individual competition.
Baldwin described the 6,257-yard, par-72
Palmetto Hall course as "one of the best we
play on. There is a lot of water, trees and
sand." He also praised Palmetto Hall as "a
very fair championship course . . . very beauti
ful."
The coach rated Stanford's chances as
"about even" with the other teams, and hopes
to challenge for first place. "We have as good a
chance as anybody to win," Baldwin said.
The team is staying in private condomini
ums described by Baldwin as "very luxuri
ous." Such are the perks of playing in a tour
nament sponsored by Golf World magazine,
Etonic and Merrill Lynch.
Stanford tees off at 8:45 a.m. and is paired
with Miami and Southern Cal. Baldwin looks
forward to getting to see the top teams from
the southeast, which have thus far been
absent from Stanford's west coast tours.
