# Swimmers begin repeat quest with golden outlook

The word "dynasty" is often used to describe foot
ball teams that have consistently placed at the top of
their conference. With that definition, Stanford
men's swimming surpassed the mere status of
"dynasty" and moved on to "legend" at some point
along their path to 11 consecutive Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships and four NCAA crowns.
This weekend, the '92-'93 Cardinal squad will
begin its dual meet season against Fresno State
today at 2 p.m. and the U.S. National Team tomor
row at 9 a.m. as the defending NCAA champs. But as
backstroke specialist Brian Retterer predicted, fans
can expect to see a completely different team in the
water this year.
According to head coach Skip Kenney, last year's
graduating class not only left Stanford with diplo
mas, but also with a lot of experience and talent.
However, the potential of this year's freshman
class and the talent of the junior class promise to
strengthen the '92-'93 squad, despite the loss of the

graduated class.
The Cardinal freshman class has been called one
with "lots of scoring potential" and includes stand
outs like Olympian Joe Hudepohl and Pan-American
Champion Eric Diehl.
However, according to coach Kenney, the estab
lished strength of this year's team lies within the
junior class. "This is a class that could go to NCAA's
by themselves and score within the top 10 — they're
possibly the best class to ever swim in the NCAA.
Plus they continue to improve."
Aside from Pac-10 and NCAA championship
meets, the team has pinpointed Michigan as their
toughest rivals this season, which they will meet on
Jan. 15. Co-captain J.J. Freitag said, "Michigan has
been saying that they're number one in the nation.
They had a lot of guys who started training early as
a group. They're very focused."
What Kenney expects to see in his Cardinal this
season is an "unbelievable team. A team that's even
better than last year's with not one weakness.
"It's going to be one heck of a fun year."
