# Russia welcomes Peace Corps
## 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
Ruth Rouse, Class of '63, embarks today on a trip
that will take her where perhaps no American has
gone before — the city of Saratov, Russia.
She and her husband Roger Dennis are among a
group of 100 American volunteers that will partici
pate in the Peace Corps' first-ever mission to Russia,
to help the country develop small businesses.
"It's such an exciting time for them, when they're
trying to move to a freer enterprise and private own
ership, and we'll try to help them however we can,"
she said.
Today the Watsonville couple are on their way to
Washington, D.C., where the group will spend one
week preparing before flying to Russia.
Dennis said that after they arrive in Moscow, they
will travel to the Volga region of Russia, a heavily in
dustrialized area where Russian naval capabilities are
focused — and where no American tourists have been
allowed since before Lenin's ascent to power in 1917.
They plan to stay for about two years.
This marks a distinct change in the relations be
tween Russia and the United States, the couple said,

because in the past, the Peace Corps was portrayed by
the Communist Party as a front for the CIA and U.S.
espionage.
"The world is changing and the needs of people,
and even the people who need help are changing,"
Dennis said. "Now they need us to teach them capi
talism, that's what we'll try to do."
Among other ideas, Rouse and her husband plan
to grow fresh vegetables and sell them, and perhaps
create a small business that would become a direct
supply to people who live in the city.
But what they will actually do depends on what
the people there need, Rouse said. They have some
ideas already set, but their implementation depends
on the structure available to the would-be Russian
entrepreneurs, if any.
"They really have no reference point on what a
small business really is. It's going to be a stumbling,
trial-and-error experience for them. Almost like it is
for small businesses in this country," Dennis said.
Dennis has an MBA degree from Oregon State
University and is a former consultant to the White
House Committee on Small Businesses. Though
Rouse has a degree in economics,
she has spent most of her life
working in social service.
Rouse said previous Peace
Corps experience makes her very
optimistic about the success of
this mission. She was among the
first Peace Corps volunteers
when the organization began in
1961. Just after she received her
degree in economics from Stan
ford in 1963, she went with the
second group that traveled to
Costa Rica to work on rural com
munity development.
"When we got to Costa Rica,

the town had three cars and six
bicycles. Now they have one-way
streets and stop signs. We worked
on a co-op for electricity, and now
most of them have refrigerators
and televisions in their homes,"
Rouse said.
The couple said that they
expect their trip to Russia to be
more exciting because of the
country's past, and because they
will be helping the Russian people
get change started.
"The process of change can be
really slow. We're going to be
working on laying the basic
groundwork, but change will only
start accelerating in the fourth or
fifth year," Rouse said. "To change
70 years of state-controlled econo
my will take some time."
