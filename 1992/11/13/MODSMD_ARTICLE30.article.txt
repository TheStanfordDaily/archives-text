She even has a picture of J.J.
Lasley in her office. Nude. What
could be more Greek than nudi
ty?
But back to this week's ques
tion. "How do the Greeks predict
the winners and losers so accu
rately week after week?"
Well, first of all, there are no
secrets among Greeks. We boast
of our exploits the same way any
man does. When there are no
women around.
There are no magical formu
las, no tricks involving school col
ors or smuggled bank account
statements from the Bank of
Washington with $50,000 with
drawals.
No. We just look at the
spreads. '
I think we've all learned a les
son, over these weeks. You for
reading this, and us, well, us just
for prostituting ourselves to get
our names in the paper.
And me, well, I may take the
heat every now and then, but it
only serves to make me
stronger.
And when I'm rich and power
ful and telling Michael Eisner
what he can do with his little
"cartoon" movies, we'll see whose
laughing hardest.
Anyhow, I get paid for it.

Let me tell you something
about the Greeks. Greeks know
how to take a punch. Slap their
cheek, they'll turn the other and
slap it themselves.
Greeks don't bitch and moan.
If they're upset they turn some
one into a swan or a heifer. That's
the way Greeks handle things.
Nice and clean.
But the real test of a Greek,
besides the sheer perseverance in
continuing this seemingly mean
ingless tradition week after tire
some week, is when your boss is
the Guest Greek.
A chance for cheap brownie
points, for sycophantic obse
quiousness, full of redundant
synonyms? I don't think so.
No, we here at the Greeks look
this opportunity in the eye and
give it the same big sloppy hug
Dan Quayle gave his hypotheti-
pregnant daughter.
June Cohen is a saint. A meis
ter of words. The kindest boss
anyone has ever had. Including
Jesus.
And she's Greek. Greek
through and through. Her hair
resembles Medusa. Her racquet
ball skills are Bacchaen. The per
sonality of the chick who turned

into a tree.
She even has a picture of J.J.
Lasley in her office. Nude. What
could be more Greek than nudi
ty?
But back to this week's ques
tion. "How do the Greeks predict
the winners and losers so accu
rately week after week?"
Well, first of all, there are no
secrets among Greeks. We boast
of our exploits the same way any
man does. When there are no
women around.
There are no magical formu
las, no tricks involving school col
ors or smuggled bank account
statements from the Bank of
Washington with $50,000 with
drawals.
No. We just look at the
spreads. '
I think we've all learned a les
son, over these weeks. You for
reading this, and us, well, us just
for prostituting ourselves to get
our names in the paper.
And me, well, I may take the
heat every now and then, but it
only serves to make me
stronger.
And when I'm rich and power
ful and telling Michael Eisner
what he can do with his little
"cartoon" movies, we'll see whose
laughing hardest.
Anyhow, I get paid for it.

Let me tell you something
about the Greeks. Greeks know
how to take a punch. Slap their
cheek, they'll turn the other and
slap it themselves.
Greeks don't bitch and moan.
If they're upset they turn some
one into a swan or a heifer. That's
the way Greeks handle things.
Nice and clean.
But the real test of a Greek,
besides the sheer perseverance in
continuing this seemingly mean
ingless tradition week after tire
some week, is when your boss is
the Guest Greek.
A chance for cheap brownie
points, for sycophantic obse
quiousness, full of redundant
synonyms? I don't think so.
No, we here at the Greeks look
this opportunity in the eye and
give it the same big sloppy hug
Dan Quayle gave his hypotheti-
pregnant daughter.
June Cohen is a saint. A meis
ter of words. The kindest boss
anyone has ever had. Including
Jesus.
And she's Greek. Greek
through and through. Her hair
resembles Medusa. Her racquet
ball skills are Bacchaen. The per
sonality of the chick who turned
