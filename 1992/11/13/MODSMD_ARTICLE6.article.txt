# 'Temple' no longer sacred, Anderson says
## 
### Jane Bahk Staff writer 
Stanford football players can
receive up to 12 units toward their
degree for playing ball.
Playing in the Stanford Band
can also earn a student one unit a
quarter.
This practice of granting degree
units for what "used to be called ex
tracurricular activities" is damag
ing Stanford's reputation, said Se
nior Hoover Fellow Martin Ander
son in a talk last night about his new
book "Impostors in the Temple."
"You can even earn a unit being
a Stanford Dolly!" he said.
"You might think it's humor
ous but at Harvard, Yale, and

Princeton, they don't think that
it's so funny," Anderson said
when the History Corner audience
of about 50 laughed.
He said that his book was not
about Stanford as many critics
have accused, but about the de
cline of the quality of education in
universities in the country.
"Most Americans still think of
universities as a very special place
— not just as a place of learning or
teaching," he said. "It's a secular
temple of integrity — one place in
society where everybody tells the
truth."
A surge in athletic, personal,
and institutional corruption along
with plagiarism and political cor
rectness are all a part of what is
wrong with universities today,
according to Anderson.
The central problem of the
decline in quality of undergradu
ate education, he said, is the prac
tice of using graduate students as
de facto professors.
Students in general are not
qualified to teach, he said. And
though some students do have
good experiences with graduate
students as their teachers, he
admitted, "you'd probably have a
better educational experience
with a real live honest-to-god pro
fessor."
"One of the reasons universi
ties find this issue undiscussable is

that it's very expensive. There's a
very powerful economic factor in
using graduate students as teach
ers," Anderson said.
Because graduate students are
required to teach, the median time
to get a doctorate is now 10.5 years
and there is a 50 percent dropout
rate, he said.
But Computer Science Prof.
John McCarthy said this was not
the case. "In our department
Ph.D. candidates are required to
T.A. for two quarters and I don't
think this is what's slowing them
down," he said.
Instead, what takes time is for
the students to find a thesis and to
convert from student to researcher,
McCarthy said.
"The ethos now rewards profes
sors' research, not teaching," said
Anderson. "And of course profes
sors will respond to those incen
tives."
