## Fac Sen committee to review grading system 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate last night asked the
Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement to make a review of the Uni
versity grading policy, and in the process
re-evaluate whether student transcripts
should include failing grades.
"It's a big task, but it seems tome it's one
that we have not looked at very thoroughly
for a fairly long period of time now, and it
really affects everything we do," said Bio
logical Sciences Prof. Robert Simoni, who
made the motion for the review. The review
will include a survey to determine peoples'
attitudes toward the grading policy.
More than half of the respondents to a
1989 survey by the committee said they
were unsatisfied with the grading system
and wanted the "F" grade restored to stu
dents' transcripts, but the committee de
cided not to draw any conclusions because
only 400 of the 1700 surveys distributed
were returned. Currently, if a student
earns a grade lower than a "D," no record of
the class appears on the transcript.
Assoc. Geology Prof. Gail Mahood, the
chair of the committee, said the committee
had already decided in its October meeting
to undertake another survey. She said that

although the grading system evaluation
will be the committee's main task, it is un
likely that the report will be finished by the
end of the academic year.
In an interview after the meeting, Ma
hood said the issue of changing the grading
policy is a "basic, fundamental debate" that
has "constantly resurfaced" over the years.
The grading issue came up when Chem
istry Prof. Richard Zare asked for an expla
nation of a motion the Senate passed last
year that moved the course-dropping dead
line from 24 hours before the final to im
mediately before the exam starts.
Engineering Prof. William Nix explained
that the change was made because the 24-
hour deadline was useless in light of the fact
that a student could simply come to the final,
earn a failing grade and have the class not
show up on his or her transcript.
The discussion then turned to whether
the University should even have a no-fail
ing-grade policy. Professors expressed con
cern over what dropping failing grades
from transcripts meant for the University
in terms of costs and principles.
"The reason why I personally think it
makes some sense to think about tinkering
with | the grading system 1 or changing it is
