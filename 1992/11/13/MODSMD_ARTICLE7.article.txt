# The 						return of the 'F'?
## Fac Sen committee to review grading system 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate last night asked the
Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement to make a review of the Uni
versity grading policy, and in the process
re-evaluate whether student transcripts
should include failing grades.
"It's a big task, but it seems tome it's one
that we have not looked at very thoroughly
for a fairly long period of time now, and it
really affects everything we do," said Bio
logical Sciences Prof. Robert Simoni, who
made the motion for the review. The review
will include a survey to determine peoples'
attitudes toward the grading policy.
More than half of the respondents to a
1989 survey by the committee said they
were unsatisfied with the grading system
and wanted the "F" grade restored to stu
dents' transcripts, but the committee de
cided not to draw any conclusions because
only 400 of the 1700 surveys distributed
were returned. Currently, if a student
earns a grade lower than a "D," no record of
the class appears on the transcript.
Assoc. Geology Prof. Gail Mahood, the
chair of the committee, said the committee
had already decided in its October meeting
to undertake another survey. She said that

although the grading system evaluation
will be the committee's main task, it is un
likely that the report will be finished by the
end of the academic year.
In an interview after the meeting, Ma
hood said the issue of changing the grading
policy is a "basic, fundamental debate" that
has "constantly resurfaced" over the years.
The grading issue came up when Chem
istry Prof. Richard Zare asked for an expla
nation of a motion the Senate passed last
year that moved the course-dropping dead
line from 24 hours before the final to im
mediately before the exam starts.
Engineering Prof. William Nix explained
that the change was made because the 24-
hour deadline was useless in light of the fact
that a student could simply come to the final,
earn a failing grade and have the class not
show up on his or her transcript.
The discussion then turned to whether
the University should even have a no-fail
ing-grade policy. Professors expressed con
cern over what dropping failing grades
from transcripts meant for the University
in terms of costs and principles.
"The reason why I personally think it
makes some sense to think about tinkering
with | the grading system 1 or changing it is
I see so many people who take
courses to this point, drop it and
take it again, at a great cost to the
University at a time when the
University can't afford that cost,"
Zare said. The policy also sends
the "wrong message (to students)
about how to go through life."
Genetics Prof. David Botstein
said the no-failing grade policy
drove students into "ironical and
paradoxical behavior."
He recounted a time when "a
student came in tears over the
issue of why would a professor
who has since departed not give
her (or) find some extra points to
take off her final exam so that she
might descend to an F so that she

would have no credit and not have
a bad grade.
"I think that says it all," he
said. "There is something severe
ly amiss when the students come
in tears asking for a failing
grade."
Simoni also said there was
something wrong with removing
the F grade. He said he was
"struck by the expunging of the
record of a course previously taken
and I think we approach a point
when the transcript is not only a
record of accomplishment but has
a little bit of deception."
Though Simoni facetiously
asked to have the report done for
"next week," the Senate has not
yet set a deadline for the commit
tee's findings.
Mahood said the committee will
discuss a time schedule for the
report in its meeting next week.
