# Forced retirement to end
## University may implement early leave incentives 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
A Faculty Senate committee will be
formed to devise a plan encouraging facul
ty to retire early, Provost Gerald Lieber
man announced yesterday.
The plan would replace Stanford's re
tirement age of 70, putting Stanford in
compliance with a recent federal anti-dis
crimination ruling that bans institutions
from enforcing mandatory retirement ages.
Without some type of new policy, Uni
versity officials fear millions could be added
to Stanford's budget and young faculty
would be difficult to hire as older, higher
paid professors stayed on indefinitely.
Lieberman. speaking to the Faculty
Senate, said he expects the committee to
have a plan ready by the end of the acade
mic year.
The federal law, passed this summer,
will go into effect Jan. 1, 1994.
Coming up with mechanisms that en
courage early retirement is a "pressing
need," University President Gerhard
Casper told the senate.
If studies made at universities such as
Michigan and Columbia are any indication,
by the end of the decade 10 percent of Stan
ford's teaching faculty could be between
the ages of 70 and 80, Casper said.
"The issue we have to face is, 'How are
we going to deal with the retirement issue

for years to come?' " he said.
The new committee will consist of five
or six faculty members and two adminis
trators, according to Lieberman.
He said Geoffrey Cox, vice provost for
institutional planning, will be one of the
committee's administrative representa
tives. The committee's faculty members
will be recommended by the Faculty Sen
ate's Committee on Committees, Lieber
man said.
Lieberman sparked criticism from Eng
lish Prof. Bliss Carnochan when he said the
retirement plan the committee eventually
decides upon will be about as "generous" as
the previous temporary plan, which expired
Aug. 31. Currently Stanford has no plan.
Carnochan said that the previous ad
ministration had sent a letter to many fac
ulty members recommending that those
considering early retirement should decide
by Aug. 31 because the new retirement plan
would "almost certainly be less generous."
Those who decided to retire based on
that advice "should be given the opportuni
ty to change their minds," Carnochan said.
"We were told something that turns out to
be not the case."
But Casper told Carnochan that he is
certain the advice had been given in "good
faith." It is not surprising that the previous
administration had been pessimistic,
Casper said, considering that last
year's severe budget crisis created
the impression that "the world
was coming down on us."
In other senate business,
Casper said he would present the
Faculty Senate's recent recom
mendation to extend domestic
partner benefits to faculty and
staff at the Board of Trustees'
Dec. 7-8 meeting.
However, he said he could not
guarantee that the trustees would
actually vote on the proposal dur
ing the meeting, which will be
their "very first discussion" of it.
Casper made no comments
about the merits of the bill passed
by the senate two weeks ago, and
no senators asked him about his
opinion of it.
Later in the meeting, Statistics
Prof. Bradley Efron asked Casper
about the federal government's
Oct. 29 decision to raise the Uni
versity's indirect-cost rate from
55.5 to 60.3 percent.
Efron expressed concern that
raising the rate would renew the

administration's "addiction" to
high rates, ending the "period of
stability" that he had hoped was
beginning in the University's
negotiations with the govern
ment. .
"I certainly haven't got addict
ed to an overhead rate of 55 per
cent," Casper replied. "If I got
addicted to that, we would have to
close Stanford University."
He added that he was "taken
a little aback" that a higher
overhead rate, "under the cir
cumstances we are in," would be
viewed by anyone as "exces
sive."
Indeed, Casper said, a rate of
66 percent is necessary to recover
Stanford's full costs. But he said
he decided to ask the government
for only 61.5 percent, and the
University eventually received a
rate slightly lower than that.
In any event, the University
"may face an altogether new situ
ation" in the next few months,
Casper said. The Office of Man
agement and Budget plans to
introduce a revised draft of circu
lar A-21, which currently regu
lates indirect-cost recovery prac
tices, before the Bush administra
tion leaves office, he said.

ation" in the next few months,
Casper said. The Office of Man
agement and Budget plans to
introduce a revised draft of circu
lar A-21, which currently regu
lates indirect-cost recovery prac
tices, before the Bush administra
tion leaves office, he said.
A Faculty Senate committee will be
formed to devise a plan encouraging facul
ty to retire early, Provost Gerald Lieber
man announced yesterday.
The plan would replace Stanford's re
tirement age of 70, putting Stanford in
compliance with a recent federal anti-dis
crimination ruling that bans institutions
from enforcing mandatory retirement ages.
Without some type of new policy, Uni
versity officials fear millions could be added
to Stanford's budget and young faculty
would be difficult to hire as older, higher
paid professors stayed on indefinitely.
Lieberman. speaking to the Faculty
Senate, said he expects the committee to
have a plan ready by the end of the acade
mic year.
The federal law, passed this summer,
will go into effect Jan. 1, 1994.
Coming up with mechanisms that en
courage early retirement is a "pressing
need," University President Gerhard
Casper told the senate.
If studies made at universities such as
Michigan and Columbia are any indication,
by the end of the decade 10 percent of Stan
ford's teaching faculty could be between
the ages of 70 and 80, Casper said.
"The issue we have to face is, 'How are
we going to deal with the retirement issue

for years to come?' " he said.
The new committee will consist of five
or six faculty members and two adminis
trators, according to Lieberman.
He said Geoffrey Cox, vice provost for
institutional planning, will be one of the
committee's administrative representa
tives. The committee's faculty members
will be recommended by the Faculty Sen
ate's Committee on Committees, Lieber
man said.
Lieberman sparked criticism from Eng
lish Prof. Bliss Carnochan when he said the
retirement plan the committee eventually
decides upon will be about as "generous" as
the previous temporary plan, which expired
Aug. 31. Currently Stanford has no plan.
Carnochan said that the previous ad
ministration had sent a letter to many fac
ulty members recommending that those
considering early retirement should decide
by Aug. 31 because the new retirement plan
would "almost certainly be less generous."
Those who decided to retire based on
that advice "should be given the opportuni
ty to change their minds," Carnochan said.
"We were told something that turns out to
be not the case."
But Casper told Carnochan that he is
certain the advice had been given in "good
faith." It is not surprising that the previous
administration had been pessimistic,
Casper said, considering that last
year's severe budget crisis created
the impression that "the world
was coming down on us."
In other senate business,
Casper said he would present the
Faculty Senate's recent recom
mendation to extend domestic
partner benefits to faculty and
staff at the Board of Trustees'
Dec. 7-8 meeting.
However, he said he could not
guarantee that the trustees would
actually vote on the proposal dur
ing the meeting, which will be
their "very first discussion" of it.
Casper made no comments
about the merits of the bill passed
by the senate two weeks ago, and
no senators asked him about his
opinion of it.
Later in the meeting, Statistics
Prof. Bradley Efron asked Casper
about the federal government's
Oct. 29 decision to raise the Uni
versity's indirect-cost rate from
55.5 to 60.3 percent.
Efron expressed concern that
raising the rate would renew the

administration's "addiction" to
high rates, ending the "period of
stability" that he had hoped was
beginning in the University's
negotiations with the govern
ment. .
"I certainly haven't got addict
ed to an overhead rate of 55 per
cent," Casper replied. "If I got
addicted to that, we would have to
close Stanford University."
He added that he was "taken
a little aback" that a higher
overhead rate, "under the cir
cumstances we are in," would be
viewed by anyone as "exces
sive."
Indeed, Casper said, a rate of
66 percent is necessary to recover
Stanford's full costs. But he said
he decided to ask the government
for only 61.5 percent, and the
University eventually received a
rate slightly lower than that.
In any event, the University
"may face an altogether new situ
ation" in the next few months,
Casper said. The Office of Man
agement and Budget plans to
introduce a revised draft of circu
lar A-21, which currently regu
lates indirect-cost recovery prac
tices, before the Bush administra
tion leaves office, he said.
