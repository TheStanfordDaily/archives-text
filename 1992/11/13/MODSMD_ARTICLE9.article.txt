# 'She doesn't use the stereotypical Jane Fonda approach.'
## Gyrating your way to fitness

On some campuses, the phrase "pelvic action"
may conjure up images of a hot, steamy evening be
tween two young lovers.
But not at Stanford. For Kate Coughlin and her
aerobicizers packed into the steamy walls of Roble
Gym, gyration means sweating to about an hour's
worth of tribal rhythms and exotic boats.
It's a tribute to Elvis, or rather, a New Age
Elvis, but without all that Shake, Rattle and Roll
Coughlin, with her kindler, gentler approach to
aerobics, arrived at Stanford three years ago and
quickly distinguished herself from traditional aer
obics.

"It's low-impact aerobics, which allows me to
make it more like dance, combining power and
beauty. In this mode, you are much more able to
stay in the zone that you need to be in to burn off
fat," explained Coughlin.
Coughlin started teaching in 1978, when
Richard Simmons didn't look so funny and many
were contemplating a terrycloth head band pur
chase.
Rack then, "everyone thought it was good to
jump up and down," said Coughlin. "We now know
that there are better ways to do this."
Despite the facts, many still choose to "bop until
they drop."
