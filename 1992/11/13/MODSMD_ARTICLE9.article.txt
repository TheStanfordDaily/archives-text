# 'She doesn't use the stereotypical Jane Fonda approach.'
## Gyrating your way to fitness 
### Alexa Lee Staff writer Kate Mizrahi 
On some campuses, the phrase "pelvic action"
may conjure up images of a hot, steamy evening be
tween two young lovers.
But not at Stanford. For Kate Coughlin and her
aerobicizers packed into the steamy walls of Roble
Gym, gyration means sweating to about an hour's
worth of tribal rhythms and exotic boats.
It's a tribute to Elvis, or rather, a New Age
Elvis, but without all that Shake, Rattle and Roll
Coughlin, with her kindler, gentler approach to
aerobics, arrived at Stanford three years ago and
quickly distinguished herself from traditional aer
obics.

"It's low-impact aerobics, which allows me to
make it more like dance, combining power and
beauty. In this mode, you are much more able to
stay in the zone that you need to be in to burn off
fat," explained Coughlin.
Coughlin started teaching in 1978, when
Richard Simmons didn't look so funny and many
were contemplating a terrycloth head band pur
chase.
Rack then, "everyone thought it was good to
jump up and down," said Coughlin. "We now know
that there are better ways to do this."
Despite the facts, many still choose to "bop until
they drop."

Dance instructor Kate Coughlin leads a group of aerobicizers in her advanced aerobics section on
Wednesday afternoon.
"In regular aerobics, you might
think you're getting a better work
out, 44 said senior Karla Plesums,
"but you're just doing more than
you have to, and not even thinking
about what you're doing."
"She doesn't use the stereotypi
cal 'Jane Fonda' approach. To get
a good workout you have to put
mental power into it and think
about it," said sophomore Kate
Mizrahi.
The difference between Fonda
and Coughlin is to be expected
since, Coughlin — unlike Fonda —
has a background in martial arts,
tai chi, and modern dance.
Far from the typical military
jumping jacks, Coughlin's rou
tines are intended to "make the
moves move you, through body
and beat."
These rhythms, including a
unique mix of African, "new age,"
house and ritual dance varieties,
"uplift rather than beat you over
the head," said Coughlin. Her rou
tines are inspired "from walking
on the beaches of Hawaii and
swimming the deep blue ocean."
"When she told us that she
didn't want to use the regular
music. . . we were relieved," said
Assistant Athletic Director
Shirley Schoop.

"I try to work out the joy in our
bodies, to experience the sense of
moving, not comparing yourself to
the person next to you," Coughlin
said.
Since most aerobicizers don't
regularly do this, a first class with
Coughlin may seem like an out-of
body experience.
"Some of the stuff she makes
up is kind of weird, you'd never
think of doing it as aerobics," said
freshman Sarah From.
Junior Adolfo Mendez added
the male perspective: "The moves
are very pelvic. They are ones that
men aren't traditionally taught."
"I want my students to feel at
home with their bodies and to ben
efit from doing something physical
as a group. In this way, I hope it's
kind of like a tribal experience."
"I think," she laughs, "I would
have done well in a tribe. I like that
sense of coming together.
"In college you get lost in a
shuttle and you seldom get to expe
rience being able to connect in on a
physical, yet spiritual level," said
Coughlin.
In addition to the two back-to
back classes she effortlessly teach
es most days of the week, Coughlin
manages her own tribe of her hus
band and two twin girls, which "is
a work-out in itself," she admits.
"I'm impressed by her stami
na," said freshman Sarah Fang.
"She can do all that and still be
expressive and kind of spiritual."
