The Stanford Bachelors is a NON-PROFIT organization of
Stanford alumni that hosts social events in the Bay Area.
(Excess proceeds are periodically donated to charity.)
Both informal and formal parties are sponsored for younger
professionals (mostly age 21 to 40) TO HAVE FUN.
Many people who have attended one of our parties say that
it's MUCH MORE FUN than going out to bars or nightclubs.
It's a great chance to meet professionals including many
Stanford alumni for casual chats, business networking, or
friendships.
Just relax and enjoy (or talk about micro-chips if you prefer).
If you would like to be invited to future events, please fill out
the form below and send it to: Stanford Bachelors
Dept. M
P.O. Box 2345
Stanford, CA 94309
We'll send you an invitation!
