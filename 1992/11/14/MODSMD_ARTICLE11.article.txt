# Washington State/Stanford Match-ups
## 
### 
Bledsoe could very easily be the
No. 1 pick in the NFL pro draft
this spring. The 6-5 232-lb junior
quarterback ranks first in the
Pac-10 and seventh nationally in
total offense. If Bledsoe is given
time to set up, odds are high that
he will complete his pass. It will
be up to the Cardinal's own All-
America hopeful Ron George to
make sure that Bledsoe doesn't
get the time that he needs.
George's 13 sacks and 21 tackles
for-loss lead the Pac-10, and have
earned him consideration for the
Butkus Award, given to the best
collegiate linebacker.

Norwood is one of the greatest suc
cess stories on the Stanford squad.
Originally making the team as a
walk-on for the '9O season, the
junior has started at right inside
linebacker in every game he's
played in '92. Norwood will face
one of the greatest tests of the sea
son in the person of Wright-Fair,
who has rushed for 919 yards and
eight touchdowns. The Cougars'
senior running back is second in
the Pac-10 and 21st in the nation in
rushing yards, and has allowed for
an all-out offensive attack by
Washington State as a complement
to Bledsoe's passing game.

McClanahan has been the over
riding force in the Washington
State defense this year. The
junior middle linebacker has an
unbelievable 105 tackles so far
this season. Challenging him on
both runs and pass patterns in
the middle will be J. J. Lasley,
who has been a large portion of
the Cardinal offense of late. The
senior fullback caught nine pass
es for 125 yards last week in addi
tion to performing his usual
rushing and blocking duties.
Lasley currently rates 10th in the
Pac-10 in receptions per game
with 3.5.

Davis has been Bledsoe's favorite
target this year. Coming into
today's game, the senior flanker
has caught 76 balls for 776 yards
and five touchdowns this season,
ranking him second in the Pac-10
and 14th in the nation in receiving
yards. But after he makes the
catch, Davis better make sure he's
not in the vicinity of Lynch. The
senior free safety was named Pac
-10 Defensive Player-of-the-Week
last week for the second time this
season. Lynch's hard-hitting style
has become well-known and makes
more than one receiver think hard
before catching the ball.

Pointer has established himself
as one of the more explosive
return men in the country. The
junior is second in the conference
and eighth in the nation in kick
off returns wth an average of
almost 27 yards per return.
Abrams, who has recently been
given the job of kick-offs to go
along with his place kicking
duties, will need to keep Pointer
pinned in the endzone to prevent
a 98-yard return similar to the
one he had earlier this season.

As any fifth-grade geography stu
dent can tell you, Washington is
the Evergreen State. Forest upon
forest of conifers and little name
less furry things abound, choking
the life out of nice cities like Pull
man. Sure, there may be more
trees in Washington than there
are Birkenstocks at Stanford, but
does our neighbor to the north
have the pine cones to go head to
head with the Stanford Tree?
The official/unofficial mascot of
the University has a short tem
per, and doesn't take to those lit
tle nameless furry things run
ning up his trunk.
