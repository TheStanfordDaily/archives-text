# High-powered offense fuels Cougar attack
## 
### Greg Collins 
In past years, thinking about the Wash
ington State Cougars conjured up images of
high-powered offenses winning games by
the decree "He who has the ball last wins."
However, the 1992 Cougars are a much dif
ferent team.
Although Washington State still centers
its offense around junior quarterback Drew
Bledsoe, the defense has been what has pro
pelled the Cougars as high as 13th in the
Associated Press and CNN/USA Today
polls. Allowing only 117.4 yards rushing
and 175.8 yards passing per game, Wash
ington State brings a quick, blitzing defense
to Stanford Stadium.
Linebacker Anthony McClanahan
anchors a strong front seven for the
Cougars. Only a junior, McClanahan has
the ability to become one of the top
linebackers in the country next year. He
leads the team with 105 tackles this year
and has a three-year total of 288 tackles,
placing him sixth on the all-time Washing
ton State career tackles list.
Other players to watch on defense include
defensive end/linebacker Lewis Bush and
cornerbacks Torey Hunter and Greg Burns.
Bush, a senior, is tied for second with
McClanahan for tackles for loss (7 for -53
yards) and has three sacks for -43 yards.
Hunter and Burns, only sophomores,
have played consistently all season. Hunter
has 10 pass deflections to show for his hard
work, and Burns has shown his ability to
cover by intercepting five passes this year.
On the other side of the ball, Drew Bled
soe has followed a rocky road to the helm of
the Cougars' offense. As a freshman, he
bided his time behind popular Brad Gossen

and fiery Aaron Garcia. After Gossen grad
uated and Garcia quit the team, the reins
were handed to Bledsoe and the Cougars
haven't looked back.
Bledsoe has become the top-rated quar
terback in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Through nine games, he is averaging 257.44
yards of total offense per game, ranking him
seventh in the NCAA. He has completed 54
percent of his passes for 2,366 yards and has
thrown 16 touchdowns though he has
also thrown 12 interceptions. Bledsoe ranks
second on the Washington State career pass
ing list with 6,493 yards and 42 touchdowns.
"He's big and accurate," said coach Bill
Walsh. "He's the best quarterback we'll
face this year."
Linebacker Dave Garnett added, "He's
hard to take down, and he throws a great
fade pattern."
His best passing game this year was the
offensive show he had against Montana.
Completing 37 of 66 passes for 413 yards
and three touchdowns, the Cougars defeat
ed the Grizzlies 25-13. In two previous
games against Stanford, Bledsoe was 25 for
57, for 315 yards, with one touchdown and
one interception.
The receiving corps of the Cougars pre
sents match-up difficulties for the Cardi
nal. Often going with three or even four
receivers and utilizing exceptional pass
catching tight ends, Washington State has
the ability to flood the secondary with
receivers.
C.J. Davis, Phillip Bobo, Deron Pointer
and Calvin Schexnayder make up one of
the most formidable groups of receivers
Stanford will face this year. Rated


Washington State Media Guide
With a prototype passer's body and instincts, Cougar quarterback Drew Bledsoe fig
ures to continue his successful dissection of opposing defenses in the NFL
as the sixth-best unit in The
Sporting News pre-season rank
ings, the Cougar receivers have
caught 119 passes for 1,867 yards
and 15 touchdowns. Davis leads
the group with 46 catches for 776
yards and five touchdowns.
Usually running out of a one
back formation, most of the rush
ing duties fall into the capable
hands of senior Shaumbe Wright-
Fair. Following in the tradition of
past Washington State running

backs Rueben Mayes and Steve
Broussard, Wright-Fair combines
speed and power to exploit defenses
trying to key off of Bledsoe's pass
ing ability.
Wright-Fair has rushed for 919
yards on 195 carries. His 102.1
yards per game places him second
in the Pac-10 behind California's
Russell White. He has scored
eight of the Cougars' 12 rushing
touchdowns this year.
Coach Price is pleased with how
this season has gone so far. "I'm
especially pleased with the defense,"
said Price. "Our team has stayed
healthy, and that's an important part
of winning Pac-10 football games."
