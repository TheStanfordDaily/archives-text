# Stanford clashes with Cougars in home finale
##

Freedom or Fiesta?
As the season nears a close,
exactly where Stanford will end
up in the post-season becomes a
prevalent question with muddled
answers. But the answers will
soon become a little clearer.
Today's home finale between
resurgent and resilient Stanford
(7-3) and streaky Washington
State (7-2) will simplify any post
season travel plans the Cardinal
has in mind.
Another win for Stanford coach
Bill Walsh could put a New Year's
Day bowl game in reach to go with
his two wins in the Sun and Blue
bonnet bowls ('77 and '7B). A loss
could relegate the Cardinal to
fourth place in conference play,
and a likely return to Anaheim for
the Freedom Bowl. One thing is
for certain: Walsh will not under
estimate WSU quarterback Drew
Bledsoe.
"I can't remember a better
quarterback Stanford has faced in
a long time," Walsh said.
Walsh has reason to worry. In
three years at the helm of Wash
ington State's pass-happy offense,
Bledsoe has flourished for 6,493
yards and 42 touchdowns. Bledsoe
bulleted USC for 358 yards three
weeks ago, and threw for 267
yards last week to beat Arizona
State 20-18.
"Nobody's really stopped
them—our best bet is to score
with them," Walsh shrugged.
Or simply let the Cougars
chase their own tails. Washington
State staggered away from hap
less Arizona State, and has lost
two straight to USC and Oregon.
Perhaps the Cardinal can do what
they did last season: shut down
WSU's point production.
Stanford spanked Bledsoe's
Cougars 49-14 at Pullman last
year. The defense recovered two
fumbles, tallied six sacks, and
limited Washington State to 43
yards rushing. And if last week is
any indication, the Stanford
offense might get a few whacks in
too.
In Stanford's surprising but
convincing 23-9 upset victory over
USC, the Cardinal defense

reasserted itself and quarterback
Steve Stenstrom shook off a sea
son full of sacks with 273 passing
yards and one touchdown.
"Stenstrom was doing the
things he does best against USC.
He just has to get the ball off
quickly," Walsh said.
True freshman place kicker
Eric Abrams converted three-of
three field goals, including two
outside 40 yards. The La Jolla,
Calif, native has 15 field goals in
17 attempts, and is a perfect 21-
for-21 on PATs.
"I thought it was those Santa
Ana winds blowing through La
Jolla for those 50-yard field goals,
but it was Eric," Walsh joked.

Another standby returned to
form as well. The Cardinal sec
ondary popped the Trojans for
four interceptions and limited
them to nine points. Free safety
John Lynch returned an intercep
tion 27 yards for a touchdown to
seal the win and tallied 12 tackles
to earn Pacific 10 Conference
Defensive Player-of-the-Week
honors.
"Lynch hits as hard as Ronnie
Lott ... a couple of hits by him
really made those receivers think
about accepting the ball out
there," Walsh said.
Defensive backs Vaughn
Bryant, Seyon Albert and Darrien
Gordon each collected one inter

ception apiece. The defense is
ranked eighth nationally in total
defense (275 yards allowed per
game), and it has amassed 15
interceptions in 1992, more than
doubling 1991's seven intercep
tion total. Bryant has snagged five
interceptions.
"Stanford's defense is a pene
trating, aggressive style defense...
they look like they are blitzing all
the time and then at the snap of
the ball they come out in a zone
coverage," WSU coach Mike Price
said. "It is going to be a real chal
lenge for our offense."
But senior outside linebacker
Dave Garnett, who has played
Bledsoe three times before, says

the defense must run a strong
pass rush or be run over.
"If Bledsoe has time to throw,
it'll be a fast-break basketball
game on the football field," Gar
nett warned. Bledsoe passed for
251 yards in Washington State's
losing effort last season against
Stanford.
Walsh acknowledges that Stan
ford's passing is anything but
fast-break, and says the Cardinal
ground game will be the deciding
factor.
"The running game will
become more and more impor
tant as the game goes on, espe
cially in the third and fourth
quarters ... we need ball con
trol," Walsh said.
Walsh will call on fullback/
halfback Ellery Roberts for
short yardage plays. Roberts
provided big gains and plenty of
control in the fourth quarter
against USC. The transfer from
Miami broke loose for several
big gains, and lumbered to a sea
son-high 66 yards on eight car
ries.
Standout halfback Glyn Mil
burn averages 179.1 total yards
per game, third in the nation
and first in the Pac-10. The
speedy yard-machine declawed
the Cougars for two touchdowns
last' season, but will be chal
lenged by WSU's greatly
improved defense, ranked 16th
in the nation.
Today's game will mark the
last home game for the Cardinal's
graduating seniors. Glyn Milburn,
Ron George, Dave Garnett, Seyon
Albert, Vince Otoupal, John
Lynch, Estevan Avila, Chris Dal
man, Ryan Wetnight, Tom
Williams, Darrien Gordon, J. J.
Lasley, Ellery Roberts, Tyrone
Parker and Paul Storehouse are
some of the four-year players who
have run out of eligibility and
must move on.
The path to success for Stan
ford this season leads through the
Cougars, and the Cardinal must
take care of the business at hand
before they can start thinking
about the end of their Stanford
Stadium careers.
"It's going to be a mad-cap high
scoring game, and I hope we're up
to it," Walsh said.


A! Green — Daily
Cornerback Darrien Gordon is one of the many Stanford seniors playing their last home game. Gordon
has improved tremendously in his Cardinal career to become a force in one of the best secondaries in
the nation.
