Shipboard Somali refugees starving
SAN'A, Yemen (AP) — A French vessel loaded with emergency
supplies of food and water raced to aid about 3,000 starving Soma
lis aboard a ship in the Arabian Sea yesterday.
But the rescue ship was not expected to link up with the refugee
laden cargo vessel, headed to Yemen, until today.
Sources in Yemen who spoke on condition of anonymity said
they feared as many as 100 children may already have died of star
vation or thirst.
Thousands of Somalis have fled clan fighting and a famine that
has killed at least 300,000 people in their country since January.
A steady flow of refugees in small boats has headed north to
Yemen, where United Nations officials have fed and sheltered them.
In Geneva, a spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees said the captain of the ship carrying the latest group of
Somalis made a desperate appeal for water.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Phil Hartman doesn't want President
elect Clinton to be bothered by his "Saturday Night Live" imper
sonation.
"I don't want him to be offended," Hartman said, noting that he
voted for Clinton.
"Whatever I say or do, I want him to know that I'm on his side,
and I'm a fan. I'm a satirist, and satire on the surface can seem cut
ting and mean, but it's my job to impersonate him on network TV."
