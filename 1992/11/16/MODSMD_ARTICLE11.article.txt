# Lithuania elects former Communists
## Voters angered by unemployment and inflation hope for improvements 
### 
VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - The first
republic to break away from the Soviet Union
appeared yesterday to be on the verge of return
ing former Communists to power in a bitterly
contested parliamentary election.
Lithuanian voters, angered by factory shut
downs, soaring prices and a lack of hot water,
said as they left the polls that they were ready
to give the former Communists a chance to
restore economic order.
Leaders of the former Lithuanian Commu
nist Party, now called the Democratic Labor
Party, promised that if they won, they would
safeguard Lithuania's independence and con
tinue to build a Western-style market economy.
But they also said they would improve trade
relations with Russia and demand better terms
from the International Monetary Fund, which
has forced Lithuania to freeze government
wages and hold down public spending in return
for Western loans.
"We will never give up our statehood. That
is not even a subject for discussion," said
Algirdas Brazauskas, the leader of the former
Communists.
"But we must seek compromises," he said,
referring to difficulties in obtaining Russian

energy supplies. "What are we going to do,
freeze all winter?"
Turnout was light in the 61 districts where
runoffs were necessary because no candidate won
a majority in the first round of voting three weeks
ago. About 70 percent of Lithuania's 2.5 million
eligible voters turned out in the first round.
Of the first 10 districts to report results,
seven went to former Communists, according
to preliminary figures.
Sajudis, the anti-Communist party that led
Lithuania to independence in 1990, has "done
very little in the past two years," Andrei
Kobzar, 30, said as he cast his ballot.
"Actually, they've done a lot â€” to make our
life impossible," said his wife, Valentina, an
unemployed waitress. "Everything is bad now.
We live in a such a hole, with two kids. I have no
job, no welfare payments."
More economic bad news appeared on the
eve of the election when the daily newspaper
Tiesa reported that industrial production has
tumbled 48.5 percent this year.
According to other recent reports, one-third
of all factories have closed or sharply cut back
employment. Consumer prices have jumped
2,200 percent since 1990.

Many Lithuanians blame Sajudis and its
leader, Vytautas Landsbergis, for the failing
economy.
In the first round of voting on Oct. 25, the
backlash led to a surprise victory for the Demo
cratic Labor Party.
Sajudis has since fought back with an emo
tional campaign implying that the former.Com
munists might surrender the country's hard
won independence.
"A tear in God's eye: Lithuania, where are
you going?" Sajudis asked voters in black-and
white posters splashed across the capital.
The former Communists needed only about
half the 61 seats in the runoff to gain a majori
ty in parliament. If they fell short, they said,
they would try to form a center-left coalition.
"Sure, our roots are in the Communist
Party, but we're a completely different party
now. A purely social democratic party," said
the vice chairman of the former Communist
Party, Neris Germanas.
He said the Democratic Labor Party was mod
eling itself after Finland's leftist coalition, Swe
den's Social Democrats and Israel's Labor Party.
"We are moving to the right, to the liberal
side and free-market economics," he said.
