## Flicks, now in stereo 
### 
ASSU should approve
bill to provide quality
sound for future films

Aside from being hit
with a really hard paper wad,
nothing about Sunday Flicks
is more annoying than not being
able to hear the movie due to
Memorial Auditorium's poor
sound system. The recent proposal
by some ASSU senators to rectify
the situation by purchasing a new
system is commendable, and
deserves the support of the senate.
The proposed system, which
would include Dolby Surround-
Sound, would benefit not only
Flicks-goers but would improve
the productions of groups like
Ram's Head Theatrical Society,
the Drama Department and the
Stanford Concert Nework. These
organizations, which often use
Mem Aud and are forced to rent
extra equipment to supplement
the current shabby system, would
undoubtedly benefit from the new
equipment.
The new system, which is val
ued in excess of $100,000, would
only cost the ASSU about $45,000
in reserve funds — representing
about 10 percent of the nearly
$500,000 the ASSU currently has
in its coffers.
While some may argue that
spending this amount of money on
one project is excessive, the fact is,
much of the reserve fund making
the preject possible has been gen
erated-by Flicks. It is not unrea
sonable to reinvest some of this in
the program that has greatly con
tributed to the ASSU's current
wealth.
Secondly, while the "let's save
for a rainy day" mentality has
some merit, student money should
benefit students. Hoarding funds
is not cautious — it's unfair. Why
should all the money reaped from
current students go untouched
until some group of senators five,
10 or 20 years from now gets up

the courage to untie the ASSU's
purse strings?
The proposal does an admirable
job of distributing the cost
between the ASSU, moviegoers
and other campus groups using
the auditorium.
The balance of the new system's
cost would be paid for by adding
$1.50 to the cost of a quarterly
Flicks pass (an increase of only
about 10 percent) and by increas
ing the charge assessed to other
groups for using the system by
about 25 percent, or $150 a pro
duction — a drop in the bucket
compared to the budget of an
entire show.
Groups using Mem Aud but
choosing not to use the system
would not pay extra, and groups
that do use it will probably save
money because they no longer
have to rent expensive equipment.
Maintenance costs would be
assumed by the University, as the
proposal calls for donating the sys
tem to the school.
If the ASSU is still concerned
about financing the improve
ments, they would be wise to con
sider canceling Friday Classic
Flicks. This series, which features
older films that are available at the
local video store or even on cable
TY lost about $15,000 last year.
While removal of the program
might anger a few graduate stu
dents who sometimes use Friday
Flicks as wholesome weekend
entertainment for their kids, the
campus won't be losing much of a
resource.
This quarter, less than 100 pass
es were sold. As the ASSU seems to
be moving towards greater fulfill
ment of student needs, Friday Clas
sics seems to be a program that
could be axed while affecting few.
The facts are that Mem Aud's
30-year-old sound system could
use an upgrade, the ASSU has the
means and the students want bet
ter audio for all productions held
in the auditorium. The ASSU
should not blow this opportunity
to uphold their new covenant of
serving students' needs.
