## The 						danger of crying wolf 
### 
THREE YEARS AFTER alleged
marijuana use forces Douglas Gins
burg to withdraw from Supreme
Court consideration, alleged sexual
harassment thrusts Clarence Thomas
into the spotlight of a public hearing.
Thomas, subsequently confirmed as a
justice, compares the investigation to a
"high-tech lynching," a result of "the
most bigoted, racist stereotypes that any
black man will face."
A year after Cecil Fielder is overshad
owed in the American League MVP voting
by Rickey Henderson (a black player who
is quicker, plays better defense, hits for a
higher average and much less power),
Fielder takes second in the balloting to Cal
Ripken Jr. (a white player who is quicker,
plays better defense, hits for higher aver
age and has much less power). He claims
racism is a factor the second time around.
In a year when Martin Scorsese is best
ed by Kevin Costner (!) for Best Director,
Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing" fails to
garner an Oscar nomination for Best Pic
ture. Lee charges racism. "They go for the
golden white boys every time. .
It's difficult to entirely discount these
men's claims. Yet at the same time, it's
difficult to buy entirely into the theory
that while others simply fail, their specific
adversity is driven by something darker,
something more sinister than that faced
by others.
Sometimes there's no easy explanation

for misfortune — and the idea that an
unfair, uncontrollable force has caused it is
appealing. I've failed many times despite
having what I felt were superior qualifica
tions. My sense of accountability would love
to have something, anything, to blame.
But being who I am (King of the
WASPs) gives me a slightly different per
spective. Since my challenges can't ever be
the result of a prejudicial plot, I have space
to realize that sometimes life can be a lit
tle bit arbitrary, with no easy explana
tions.
The Stanford-Harvard Jinx is a good
example. Any student qualified enough to
get into Stanford should certainly meet
the standards of Harvard, but it doesn't
always happen that way. Nobody knows
why, and we'll probably never have an
acceptable reason. Such is life.
That doesn't deny that our society is
incredibly racist. We haven't been able to
completely shed the shackles of prejudice
that have restrained us for generations.
Minorities in this country are faced with a
bigotry that is sometimes overt and at
other more subtle — with the latter often
much worse.
And although there are many situa
tions where racism honestly plays no part
in causing misfortune, the accusation can
be remarkably effective anyway. It makes
those accused uncomfortable, and forces
them to back off. But only at the price of
cheapening the currency of the powerful

concepts that are at play.
When Spike Lee and others insinuate
that prejudice is the cause of their failures
— when no proof exists and others are the
victims of more glaring oversight — the
charge of discrimination becomes less
powerful.
When Clarence Thomas misuses the
term "lynching" in order to soften his own
personal challenges, he soflens for every
one the true historical significance of the
image.
When people develop the (very fcdsf)
perception that charges of racism are juit
excuses, they begin to tune out news
reports and skim over headlines. Rodney
King and Howard Beach lose their power.
This absolutely cannot be allowed to hap
pen. If the concept of racism loses its
impact, we can't effectively fight against it.
Racism is real. Blatant, disguised, sub
tle, obvious and undeniably evil. Our most
effective weapon is public exposure and
challenge. But when wielding this-blade,
we can't afford to dull its edge unnecessar
ily. The battle is too important, and we
have too much to lose.
