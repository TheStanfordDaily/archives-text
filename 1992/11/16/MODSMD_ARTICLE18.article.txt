Athletics Dept. focus on profit dismays crew team

A NOV. 9 DAILY ARTICLE entitled
"Formerly For Free" described
Department of Athletics budget
cuts totalling $700,000. This money is to
be made up by raising student fees on
athletic classes and severely cutting
funding to so called "varsity II" sports.
Among these is Stanford varsity crew.
Sadly, the Athletics Department has
increasingly become like a professional
corporation. In their attempts to prolong
Stanford's current athletic dynasty,
administrators have lost sight of the
basic ideals of college athletics. Unoffi
cial Athletics Department policy seems
to be "Only the most profitable shall
survive."
Only one varsity sport still offers
novices the opportunity to walk on as

freshmen and potentially reach the
Olympic level â€” crew. Rowing has been
a part of Stanford since the University's
founding in 1891. Stanford rowers have
represented the United States in every
Olympiad.
Stanford rowers train as hard as any
team on campus. Total practice time is
compounded, however, by the need to
constantly raise money. After Saturday
practice, we take tickets at football
games. We set up for gymnastics meets
in the winter. This February will bring
the fifth annual "Erg-A-Thon" fund
raiser to White Plaza.
Our program is already partially "self
funded," though we still must depend on
the Athletics Department to pay 25 per
cent of our budget (the term "self fund-

Ed" is Athletics Department phraseology
for "grovelling").
Nevertheless, the amount of money
allotted to Stanford Crew is meager in
comparison to other varsity sports with
one-fourth the student participation.
Stanford rowers already pay dues. They
pay for all their uniforms and most of
their travelling expenses. There are no
scholarships for rowing.
Stanford Rowing embodies all of the
classic ideals of amateur athletics. Yet
the Athletics Department has officially
reduced crew funding because the sport
is not profitable. Why is a program with
such tradition, that provides such a cru
cial outlet for more than 100 Stanford
students, facing such cuts? Why is an
administration, at a university

renowned for its tolerance, making deci
sions based solely on profitability? How
much of this $700,000 cutback is being
taken in salary cuts by athletic adminis
trators?
We believe that "self funded" pro
grams have a tremendous amount to
add to the glory of Stanford athletics.
We don't believe that swimming, basket
ball or baseball have better student ath
letes than rowing, fencing or soccer. We
are all very driven, hard working and
proud to represent Stanford. The only
difference is how much support we
receive from the Athletics Department.
