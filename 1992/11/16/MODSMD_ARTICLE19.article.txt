# Pediatric care cuts painful, but Cowell provides alternatives
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the article
which addressed the closure of the pedi
atrics program at the Student Health
Center.
Pediatrics at Cowell has always been
offered on a fee-for-service basis. It was
not a service funded through student
money. What became clear last late
spring was that the volume of patients
could not support the costs of maintain
ing the service. Although we were all
committed to the easy access and the
special care that we felt Cowell could
offer student families, the financial real
ities dictated a different decision.
We worked with the Standard Chil
dren's Health Task Force (a group of
concerned parents) over the summer to
accomplish several tasks. We were able
to find three provider groups who would

offer care at comparable rates and nego
tiated a discounted rate at the Palo Alto
Medical Foundation.
We committed ourselves to a low-cost
immunization clinic operated by the
Cowell pediatrics nurse in Escondido
Village on a regular basis. Additionally,
she was given time off to serve as a pedi
atric liaison between student families
and the ofT-campus providers. Lastly, we
worked with the committee to draft an
evaluation form for parents to complete
that would allow us to gauge satisfaction
with the providers. We examined the
feasibility of a pediatrician opening an
office at Cowell and concluded it was not
possible.
As part of this change, we worked
with orientation programs to make cer
tain that information for parents was
provided. We are grateful to the student
families who have assisted us in all these
endeavors.
We continue to track concerns as they
arise. I believe that, given the fiscal con
straints, the Student Health Service
worked hard to hear and respond to

parental concerns.
