# AASA forum to strengthen Asian communities' ties
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Hoping to increase communication between
Stanford's diverse Asian communities, the
Asian American Students Association is creat
ing a forum of representatives from each group
to discuss important issues.
The committee will meet regularly and
serve as a type of legislative body for AASA.
Each group within the larger community will
have one representative at the forum to pre
sent their views on issues under consideration.
"I see it as a way to bring the Asian-Ameri
can community together and to increase the
communication that exists between the differ
ent groups," said AASA chair Anne Wong. "I
think there is a lot of support for it, because
members of the communities see a need for
change."
Wong said that the forum, unofficially called
the "AASA Senate," will focus mainly on issues

related to the Asian-American community at
Stanford.
How much decision-making power repre
sentatives will have has not yet been decided,
Wong said. She added that the AASA officer
core will have veto power over the forum's ac
tions.
According to AASA vice-chair Eleanor Lo,
the forum is especially needed this year be
cause the campus' Asian-American communi
ty is continuing to grow. Asian-Americans
make up 24 percent of this year's freshman
class.
"It's almost like we're fragmenting just be
cause we are growing at such a high rate," said
Harrison Hsieh, chairman of the Asian Ameri
can Activities Center Advisory Board.
Rick Yuen, assistant dean of students, said
there are many issues for the forum to discuss,
including admissions, curriculum and lack of
resources for the community.
"More and more people are realizing how

many issues the Asian-American community
has pushed aside and kept quiet about," said
Lo.
Pilipino American Student Union chair
Julius Parus said the forum was necessary for
prompt responses to important incidents.
"Last year, after the Rodney King verdict
came out, people claimed that AASA's response
was a bit slow. The senate would provide for a
more unified voice of the community," he said.
Another purpose of the forum is to give a
larger voice to some of the ethnicities with
fewer students.
"There are groups that feel they are under
represented either by sheer numbers or by the
AASA system," Wong said.
"Each representative will be the voice of
their community," she said. "Everyone has
their own opinion, but the representative
should represent the whole community."
Korean American Student
Association co-chair Lisa Lee said
the forum will create a sense of
cohesion within the community.
"I think it is a step forward
because it's hard for a lot of the
groups to work together."
There has always been "some
exclusiveness within the Asian
community, and this might be a
way to alleviate that sense of sep
aration," she said.
In addition, the forum will
help inform the rest of the Uni
versity about the views of the
Asian-American community.
ASSU Senator Ying-Ying Goh
said she would attend the forum
in her capacity as senator. "This
is an important way for the ASSU
to get information about the
Asian community," she said.
Lee also said that the forum
would be a good way to work to
connect the Asian-American com
munity with other communities
of color.
"I think it also would be a good
idea for [the forum] to reach out
to other Stanford groups outside
the Asian community, since it
would represent the Asian com
munity as a whole instead of just
one individual faction of it," she
said.
