## Cardinal crushes Cougars 40-3, looks to Big Game 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal climbed to sec
ond place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference and shored up its claim
to a New Year's Day bowl bid
Saturday, demolishing Wash
ington State 40-3 for its fourth
victory over a ranked opponent
this year.
Behind Glyn Milburn's elec
trifying three-touchdown per
formance and another strong
defensive showing, the Cardinal
improved to 8-3 (5-2 in Pac-10
play) and jumped one spot to
No. 14 in the latest Associated
Press poll.
With a dominating second
half, in which they scored 30
unanswered points, the Cardi
nal made a laugher out of its
final home game of the 1992
season.
Stanford completely shut
down the conference's highest
scoring offense; before Saturday
the Cougars had averaged 29
points per game.
Stellar man-to-man coverage
by Cardinal cornerbacks and a
heavy pass rush stifled the
Cougars' highly-touted Drew
Bledsoe, who threw for just 145
yards and (for the first time this
season) no touchdowns.
"The key was to put pressure
on him," said linebacker Ron
George, "and cover well down
field. That was a great combina
tion. Our defensive secondary
covered so well today — if any
body deserves applause it's
them."
As free safety John Lynch —
who snatched his fourth inter
ception of the year in the third
quarter — said, "Our ability to
play man-to-man coverage freed
the guys up front to put incredi
ble pressure on Bledsoe. Most
teams don't feel they can cover
man-to-man, and they end up
playing a zone with less pres
sure."
Their second consecutive win
has left the Cardinal eyeing the
Jan. 1 Fiesta Bowl, but the Fies
ta may be looking elsewhere —
namely, at No. 15 USC.
No Fiest'a Bowl representa
tives attended the Washington
State game, and it could be that
Stanford will need a win over
Cal and a Trojan loss either to
UCLA or Notre Dame to secure
a Fiesta bid.
Representatives from the
Hancock, Freedom, Holiday and
Copper Bowls were in atten
dance, and it looks as if the
Hancock Bowl in El Paso Dec.
31 would be the Cardinal's next
choice.
Washington State (7-3, 5-3 in
Pac-10 play) did little to
enhance its postseason hopes.
But, despite the lopsided final
score, the Cougars were by no
means out of the game in the
early going. They scored first on
an Aaron Price 41-yard field
goal, and led 3-0 at the end of
the first period.
"As the game started, I was

concerned about their ability to
move the ball and our inability
to move it," head coach Bill
Walsh said. "But we just played
so fiercely that the breaks start
ed coming our way."
The first of those breaks was
wide open Cougar flanker C.J.
Davis dropping a perfect strike
from Bledsoe that would have
gone for a 73-yard touchdown.
The second — if there can be
one decisive moment in a 37-
point blowout — was the turn
ing point in the game.
With less than three minutes
to go in the first half and the
game tied 3-3, Bledsoe saw a
Cardinal defense with eight men
tight and no safety. He audibled
a quick sneak, and broke in to
the Cardinal secondary on his
way to what looked like a 31-
yard touchdown run. But Dar
rien Gordon raced back from his
cornerback position and not
only caught Bledsoe, but also
created the game's biggest
turnover.
"I came over him with both
arms, and made a conscious
effort to strip the ball out," Gor
don said. "That's something our
coaches have talked about since
day one — to strip the ball
whenever you have a chance. I
knew I had to try to make a big
play, because they had a lot of
momentum at the time."
Indeed, if Gordon hadn't
caught Bledsoe from behind, the
Cougars would have taken a 10-
3 second quarter lead. Instead,
Stanford went on a 96-yard
march that culminated in a
Steve Stenstrom-to-Milburn 42-
yard touchdown pass, and the
Cardinal took a 10-3 lead of its
own.
That scoring drive was just
the beginning for an offense
that put up more points than it
had in any ohter game this sea
son.
Milburn provided most of the
punch as he scored touchdowns
in the second, third and fourth
quarters. Both of his second
half scores came on a brand new
option pitch-out play.
"It hadn'.t been working in
practice, and I wasn't sure how
it would work in the game," Mil
burn said. "But coach Walsh
just said 'Believe me.'"
Coach Walsh was right.
The senior tailback scam
pered in from 31 and then 21
yards on the option play. The
first TD run saw Milburn shed
two would-be tacklers in the flat
before darting down the side
line. A great block by fullback
J.J. Lasley sprung Milburn on
the 21-yard run.
"Every game somebody's had
to make the big plays, and
tonight it happened to be me,"
Milburn said.
The Cardinal rolled over the
Cougars with a rejuvenated
rushing attack that compiled a
season-high 257 yards on the
ground, led by Ellery Roberts'

career-best 100 yards.
"Our blocking schemes were
ideal for their defense," Roberts
said. "They just couldn't hang
with our offensive line.
"We'd hear guys on their side
yelling, 'Don't give up,' and
then we'd come back the next

play get a 15 or 20-yard gain.
Our offensive line played as well
as they played every game last
year, when Tommy Vardell had
1,000 yards."
The offensive line has been a
much-improved unit over the
last two weeks.
And that improvement prob
ably has more than a little to do
with veteran Chris Dalman's
switch to the crucial (and for

merly unstable) left tackle posi
tion.
Unfortunately, the line will
have to raise their play another
notch to compensate for the loss
of starting left guard Brian Cas
sidy.
Cassidy suffered badly
strained knee ligaments in the
fourth quarter, and will be lost
for at least the final regular sea
son game.

coaches have talked about since
day one — to strip the ball
whenever you have a chance. I
knew I had to try to make a big
play, because they had a lot of
momentum at the time."
Indeed, if Gordon hadn't
caught Bledsoe from behind, the
Cougars would have taken a 10-
3 second quarter lead. Instead,
Stanford went on a 96-yard
march that culminated in a
Steve Stenstrom-to-Milburn 42-
yard touchdown pass, and the
Cardinal took a 10-3 lead of its
own.
That scoring drive was just
the beginning for an offense
that put up more points than it
had in any ohter game this sea
son.
Milburn provided most of the
punch as he scored touchdowns
in the second, third and fourth
quarters. Both of his second
half scores came on a brand new
option pitch-out play.
"It hadn'.t been working in
practice, and I wasn't sure how
it would work in the game," Mil
burn said. "But coach Walsh
just said 'Believe me.'"
Coach Walsh was right.
The senior tailback scam
pered in from 31 and then 21
yards on the option play. The
first TD run saw Milburn shed
two would-be tacklers in the flat
before darting down the side
line. A great block by fullback
J.J. Lasley sprung Milburn on
the 21-yard run.
"Every game somebody's had
to make the big plays, and
tonight it happened to be me,"
Milburn said.

career-best 100 yards.
"Our blocking schemes were
ideal for their defense," Roberts
said. "They just couldn't hang
with our offensive line.
"We'd hear guys on their side
yelling, 'Don't give up,' and
then we'd come back the next

play get a 15 or 20-yard gain.
Our offensive line played as well
as they played every game last
year, when Tommy Vardell had
1,000 yards."
The offensive line has been a
much-improved unit over the
last two weeks.
And that improvement prob
ably has more than a little to do
with veteran Chris Dalman's
switch to the crucial (and for

merly unstable) left tackle posi
tion.
Unfortunately, the line will
have to raise their play another
notch to compensate for the loss
of starting left guard Brian Cas
sidy.

strained knee ligaments in the
fourth quarter, and will be lost

The Cardinal climbed to sec
ond place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference and shored up its claim
to a New Year's Day bowl bid
Saturday, demolishing Wash
ington State 40-3 for its fourth
victory over a ranked opponent
this year.
Behind Glyn Milburn's elec
trifying three-touchdown per
formance and another strong
defensive showing, the Cardinal
improved to 8-3 (5-2 in Pac-10
play) and jumped one spot to
No. 14 in the latest Associated
Press poll.
With a dominating second
half, in which they scored 30
unanswered points, the Cardi
nal made a laugher out of its
final home game of the 1992
season.
Stanford completely shut
down the conference's highest
scoring offense; before Saturday
the Cougars had averaged 29
points per game.
Stellar man-to-man coverage
by Cardinal cornerbacks and a
heavy pass rush stifled the
Cougars' highly-touted Drew
Bledsoe, who threw for just 145
yards and (for the first time this
season) no touchdowns.
"The key was to put pressure
on him," said linebacker Ron
George, "and cover well down
field. That was a great combina
tion. Our defensive secondary
covered so well today — if any
body deserves applause it's
them."
As free safety John Lynch —
who snatched his fourth inter
ception of the year in the third
quarter — said, "Our ability to
play man-to-man coverage freed
the guys up front to put incredi
ble pressure on Bledsoe. Most
teams don't feel they can cover
man-to-man, and they end up
playing a zone with less pres
sure."
Their second consecutive win
has left the Cardinal eyeing the
Jan. 1 Fiesta Bowl, but the Fies
ta may be looking elsewhere —
namely, at No. 15 USC.
No Fiest'a Bowl representa
tives attended the Washington
State game, and it could be that
Stanford will need a win over
Cal and a Trojan loss either to
UCLA or Notre Dame to secure
a Fiesta bid.

Hancock, Freedom, Holiday and
Copper Bowls were in atten

choice.
Washington State (7-3, 5-3 in
Pac-10 play) did little to
enhance its postseason hopes.
But, despite the lopsided final
score, the Cougars were by no
means out of the game in the
early going. They scored first on
an Aaron Price 41-yard field
goal, and led 3-0 at the end of
the first period.
"As the game started, I was

concerned about their ability to
move the ball and our inability
to move it," head coach Bill
Walsh said. "But we just played
so fiercely that the breaks start
ed coming our way."
The first of those breaks was
wide open Cougar flanker C.J.
Davis dropping a perfect strike
from Bledsoe that would have
gone for a 73-yard touchdown.
The second — if there can be
one decisive moment in a 37-
point blowout — was the turn
ing point in the game.
With less than three minutes
to go in the first half and the
game tied 3-3, Bledsoe saw a
Cardinal defense with eight men
tight and no safety. He audibled
a quick sneak, and broke in to
the Cardinal secondary on his
way to what looked like a 31-
yard touchdown run. But Dar
rien Gordon raced back from his
cornerback position and not
only caught Bledsoe, but also
created the game's biggest
turnover.
"I came over him with both
arms, and made a conscious
effort to strip the ball out," Gor
don said. "That's something our
coaches have talked about since
day one — to strip the ball
whenever you have a chance. I
