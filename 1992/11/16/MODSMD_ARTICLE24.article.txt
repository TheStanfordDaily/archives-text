# Seniors add touch of class to farewell
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
In the cold night air, Cardinal players
joined the band in saluting the thousands of
students still dancing in the stands. Holding
their helmets aloft, it was a mixture of joy and
emptiness for the players who had just played
their last game in Stanford Stadium.
Across the way, the alumni rocked the sta
dium with a huge "Beat Cal!" cheer. But for a
moment, it was time for seniors to reflect on
the last four or five years and all they had
accomplished as they prepared to leave the
field for the last time.
Most agreed there couldn't have been a
much better way for the seniors to end their
careers in Stanford Stadium. Not only did the
Cardinal maul the Cougars, 40-3, but the
game was highlighted by outstanding perfor
mances from several members of the team's
graduating class.
For their last trip down the ramp onto the
field, seniors were presented with T-shirts
which read "The Last Walk." The rush of
excitement that players associate with that
walk is one of the lasting memories for many
players.
"I kept remembering the walks down the
ramp," fifth-year senior Estevan Avila said.
"There didn't use to be as many people and
that just shows what we've achieved."
Avila achieved greatness on the field as
well, contributing four tackles and a sack in
the end zone which put the icing on the cake of
Saturday's game. The safety made the score
40-3 and served as a fitting ending to a power
ful defensive effort.
"It couldn't have been more perfect," Avila
said. "I got a safety on my last play in Stanford
Stadium."

The defense was highlighted by another
great game from senior outside linebacker
Ron George. George pressured Cougar quar
terback Drew Bledsoe all night, including a
forceful first-half sack. It meant a great deal
for George and his defense to end their home
careers in such convincing fashion.
"It feels wonderful," George said. "We
showed our fans a new era for Stanford foot
ball."

'I played my heart out and
it felt great. It was just a
great way to endour4*eme
season.'

Dave Garnett, George's partner in crime
and Stanford's other outside linebacker, felt a
little nostalgic about the game and the fans.
"We played our hearts out," he said. "A couple
of times I found myself looking out at the
crowd."
In the secondary, seniors John Lynch and
Ron Redell each made a big play. Late in the
third quarter the game was still tight at 10-3.
Lynch then intercepted Bledsoe at the Cougar
37-yard line to set up a short Cardinal touch
down drive.
Ron Redell received extensive playing time
because WSU's offense usually lined up with
at least three wide receivers. In addition to
helping stifle the Cougar passing attack,
Redell returned a fumble 48 yards which led to
a late Cardinal touchdown.

"What a way to go out," Redell said of his
last home game. "I couldn't have written a
better story line."
With the defense so effective in smothering
the WSU offense, the Cardinal didn't need to
put many points on the board. The Stanford
offense played a great game of its own, howev
er, highlighted by the play of senior running
backs Glyn Milburn and Ellery Roberts.
Milburn filled the role of a big-play back
with three touchdowns on the evening, includ
ing runs of 21 and 31 yards and a 42-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback Steve Sten
strom. Milburn finished the day with 89 yards
rushing in one of his best games of the season.
"I played my heart out and it felt..great,"
Milburn said. "It was just a great way to end
our home season."
Roberts led the team with 100 yards rush
ing on just 16 carries in his final home contest.
"I got a chance to carry the ball," he said.
"And I don't think I could have asked for a
better ending than that."
Roberts. Milburn. Lasley. Lynch. Garnett.
George. Avila. These names and many others
represent the senior class of Stanford football,
a group that has been instrumental in bring
ing national respect to the program.
"These guys just have great motivation and
great feeling for each other," head coach Bill
Walsh said.
After joining their fans in one last celebra
tion, the Cardinal seniors put on their new T
shirts and left the locker room. As they began
their last walk up the ramp, some turned
around for one last look at the field and the
now-empty seats.
George led the others away with a cheer. It
was time to join the rest of the team, to cele
brate for a moment and then turn toward the
reality of Big Game, just one week away.

backs Glyn Milburn and Ellery Roberts.
Milburn filled the role of a big-play back
with three touchdowns on the evening, includ
ing runs of 21 and 31 yards and a 42-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback Steve Sten
strom. Milburn finished the day with 89 yards
rushing in one of his best games of the season.
"I played my heart out and it felt..great,"
Milburn said. "It was just a great way to end
our home season."
Roberts led the team with 100 yards rush
ing on just 16 carries in his final home contest.
"I got a chance to carry the ball," he said.
"And I don't think I could have asked for a
better ending than that."

After joining their fans in one last celebra
tion, the Cardinal seniors put on their new T
shirts and left the locker room. As they began
their last walk up the ramp, some turned
around for one last look at the field and the
now-empty seats.
George led the others away with a cheer. It
was time to join the rest of the team, to cele
brate for a moment and then turn toward the
reality of Big Game, just one week away.
In the cold night air, Cardinal players
joined the band in saluting the thousands of
students still dancing in the stands. Holding
their helmets aloft, it was a mixture of joy and
emptiness for the players who had just played
their last game in Stanford Stadium.
Across the way, the alumni rocked the sta
dium with a huge "Beat Cal!" cheer. But for a
moment, it was time for seniors to reflect on
the last four or five years and all they had
accomplished as they prepared to leave the
field for the last time.
Most agreed there couldn't have been a
much better way for the seniors to end their
careers in Stanford Stadium. Not only did the
Cardinal maul the Cougars, 40-3, but the
game was highlighted by outstanding perfor
mances from several members of the team's
graduating class.
For their last trip down the ramp onto the
field, seniors were presented with T-shirts
which read "The Last Walk." The rush of
excitement that players associate with that
walk is one of the lasting memories for many
players.
"I kept remembering the walks down the
ramp," fifth-year senior Estevan Avila said.
"There didn't use to be as many people and
that just shows what we've achieved."
Avila achieved greatness on the field as
well, contributing four tackles and a sack in
the end zone which put the icing on the cake of
Saturday's game. The safety made the score
40-3 and served as a fitting ending to a power
ful defensive effort.
"It couldn't have been more perfect," Avila
said. "I got a safety on my last play in Stanford
Stadium."

The defense was highlighted by another
great game from senior outside linebacker
Ron George. George pressured Cougar quar
terback Drew Bledsoe all night, including a
forceful first-half sack. It meant a great deal
for George and his defense to end their home
careers in such convincing fashion.
"It feels wonderful," George said. "We
showed our fans a new era for Stanford foot
ball."

it felt great. It was just a

Dave Garnett, George's partner in crime
and Stanford's other outside linebacker, felt a
little nostalgic about the game and the fans.
"We played our hearts out," he said. "A couple
of times I found myself looking out at the
crowd."
In the secondary, seniors John Lynch and
Ron Redell each made a big play. Late in the
third quarter the game was still tight at 10-3.
Lynch then intercepted Bledsoe at the Cougar
37-yard line to set up a short Cardinal touch
down drive.
Ron Redell received extensive playing time
because WSU's offense usually lined up with
at least three wide receivers. In addition to
helping stifle the Cougar passing attack,
Redell returned a fumble 48 yards which led to
a late Cardinal touchdown.

"What a way to go out," Redell said of his
last home game. "I couldn't have written a
better story line."
With the defense so effective in smothering
the WSU offense, the Cardinal didn't need to
put many points on the board. The Stanford
offense played a great game of its own, howev
er, highlighted by the play of senior running
backs Glyn Milburn and Ellery Roberts.
Milburn filled the role of a big-play back
with three touchdowns on the evening, includ
ing runs of 21 and 31 yards and a 42-yard
touchdown pass from quarterback Steve Sten
strom. Milburn finished the day with 89 yards
rushing in one of his best games of the season.
