# Soccer toppled by Terreros 3-0, 'new era' concludes in San Diego
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Despite receiving an at-large bid for the NCAA
Tournament this year, the prospects of postsea
son glory for the Stanford men's soccer team were
short-lived.
The Cardinal's season ended last weekend dur
ing the first round of tournament action with a 3-
0 loss to the San Diego Torreros.
Stanford's recent Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation all-star selections — Jason Vanacour,
Randy Mann and Ryan Collins — all had their
best games of the season in the losing Cardinal
effort.
Typical of all their matches this season, the vis
iting Cardinal dominated the entire game offen
sively before letting the Torreros capitalize on a
scoring opportunity with 20 minutes left in the
match.
"Their first goal was a really messy play," said
senior goalkeeper and co-captain Kyle Krpata. "I
blocked their first attempt, but they kept on
scrambling with at least four or five more shots.
Somehow they just got a foot on the baU and toe
poked it in."
After San Diego scored the go-ahead goal,
Stanford began pushing upfield as an entire unit,
leaving the backfield unguarded. The Torreros
took advantage of the wide-open Stanford back
field with two breakaway scores in the final min
utes of the game.
"We had all our guys pressuring their goal,
leaving our backfield empty, and we just got
caught a couple of times on fast break situations,"
said assistant coach Greg Peterson. "Their second
goal was scored on an excellent play, but that last
goal was clearly off-sides. In the end it really

didn't matter, because we weren't able to score
any ourselves."
Stanford (11-8-2) had several chances to take
the early lead in the first half, but squandered all
of them by not being able to execute and finish off
the scoring drives.
"The better team lost the game," Peterson
said. "We did everything better than them, except
for one thing, and that's putting the ball in the
goal. We had at least four or five sitters where the
ball was right in front of an open goal, and we
blew it. That type of frustration is very indicative
of our season."
In a press conference following the game,
Krpata said, "I'm sorry the best team didn't win
tonight. I don't think we've played a single team
that was better than us this season, and knowing
that makes this loss even more disappointing."
Later Krpata added, "We would have consid
ered this a successful season if we had advanced to
the second round. Things obviously didn't turn
out the way we wanted them to.
"We all took the loss pretty hard, especially the
seniors. But .the bottom line is that we are always
going to be proud of what we accomplished with
this program. When this senior class came in
there was literally nothing. Now we're beginning
to build a winning tradition. A couple of years
down the line, the Stanford team will accept noth
ing less than yearly appearances in the INCAA]
Tournament."
Speaking from another perspective, junior Joel
Russell said, "During the game we had lots of
early chances; but the guys gave it their best, and
we still couldn't finish up the big plays. It's frus
trating. I think that the guys who are going to be
around next year have to remember this feel
ing and do better the next time around."
