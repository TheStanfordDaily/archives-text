The NCAA District 8 Cross Country Qualifying
Meet last Saturday confirmed two Cardinal beliefs
and provided fuel for some hopes: Both Louise
Watson and Gary Stolz will be attending the
NCAA Championship Race next Monday and may
be joined by the entire women's team, who ran
what head coach Vin Lananna described as "their
best race of the season."

'Both teams just outdid themselves.'

The women placed fourth with 106 points, 16
points more than the victorious Washington
Huskies. Oregon and Arizona tied for second with
96 points. "It was the closest race I have ever
seen," Lananna said.
The top two teams from each of the eight dis
tricts qualify for the NCAA Championship race in
Bloomington, Ind., with the third team placed "on
the bubble." Today, an NCAA committee chooses
six "on the bubble" teams to receive at-large bids.
Because Oregon and Arizona tied for second,
they both qualify, putting the Stanford women in
a position to receive an at-large bid. The likeli
hood is not good, though, because it is unusual
for one district to send four teams to the champi
onships.
Individually, the women were paced by Louise
Watson, who won the five kilometer race in a time
of 17 minutes, 20 seconds. Watson, a junior
transfer student who has been the Cardinal
front-runner all season, fulfilled both of her goals
for the race.
"My first objective was to qualify and my sec
ond was to win," Watson said. "I wanted to go out
steady and follow any movements. ... I was feel
ing good and, after about 1-1/2 miles, I involun

tarily found myself in the lead. From there, I just
kept rhythm and ran for the line."
Watson's closest teammate was captain Sarah
Truitt in 14th place, followed by Kim McElhinney
in 28th. Rounding out the Cardinal scorers were
Laura Hayward and Andrea Garner in 36th and
39th places, respectively.
The men's race was dominated by Arizona. The
Wildcats placed all five of their runners in the top
10 and three in the top five on their way to gar
nering an impressive team score of 27. The Ore
gon Ducks placed second, with a score of 64, fol
lowed by the Washington Huskies.
The Stanford men placed fourth with a team
score of 95 in a race senior Gary Stolz described as
"a good race, but not a phenomenal one."
Individually, Stolz placed second in the 10K race
with a time of 30:45, losing to Joe Kapkory of
Washington State by only 4 seconds. In the process,
Stolz defeated nemesis Martin Keino of Arizona,
son of former Kenyan Olympian Kip Keino, for the
first time ever — and by more than 20 seconds.
"The 10K took its toll," Stolz said. "I caught
Keino at about the 4-1/2 mile mark. We ran
together for about 1/2 a mile, then I made my
move and he didn't even try to keep up."
Mike Reilly, a fifth-year senior, ran a great race
which culminated a great season, according to
Lananna. Reilly, who came in 12th with a time of
31:59, said, "I keyed off the Oregon guys. I made
my move after four 1 miles] and put them awav
after five."
Reilly's closest teammates were Todd Lewis
and Derek Bork, who placed 25th and 26th,
respectively, while the last Cardinal scorer was
Brian McCaffery, who finished in 35th place.
Notwithstanding the decision of the NCAA com
mittee today, Stanford will, at the very least, be
represented by Watson and Stolz at the NCAA
Championship Race next Monday, and Lananna
said he was pleased with the District 8 meet over
all.
"If I sound enthusiastic, it's because I am," he
said. "Both teams just outdid themselves."
