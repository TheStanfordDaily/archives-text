# Women left one step shy of Final Four
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's soccer team couldn't quite find the
net yesterday, and as the players' shots sailed high and spinned
wide, so did their hopes of a berth in the NCAA Final Four.
The more intense and consistent Santa Clara squad shot
on target and beat the Cardinal 2-0 in front of a capacity crowd at
Maloney Field.
With Sarah Rafanelli hobbled by a leg ir\jury and Julie
Foudy having an ofT-day, the Stanford squad failed to notch a goal
against the physical Bronco defense.
However, the Cardinal had its opportunities to score.
Coach Berhane Andeberhan employed three forwards instead of
his usual two, playing an extra attacker, and thereby confounded
the Santa Clara defense in the first half. However, Stanford was
unable to take advantage of the Broncos' confusion. Several times
Cardinal attackers found openings deep in Bronco territory, but
either the pass didn't reach the forwards or the shot was foiled by
Santa Clara goalie Sue Wall.
"They finished their (scoring) chances better than we did,"
Andeberhan said. "We usually generate a lot of chances, but we're
not very efficient. "
Despite being frustrated by the Cardinal attack, Santa
Clara coach Jerry Smith was relieved to go into halftime knotted
at 0-0.
"I felt we really dodged a bullet," he said. "We were con
fused like we haven't been all year."
Smith made several adjustments during the intermission,
including adding a fourth fullback to help stop the Cardinal attack
and calling for more passes down the sideline to take advantage of
the speed of the Bronco forwards.
The plan worked as Santa Clara jumped on the Cardinal
squad, which was unable to readjust to the Broncos' alterations.
Thirteen minutes into the period, Santa Clara completed a
series of short, sharp passes with a shot by forward Christina
DiGiacomo. The ball deflected off the leg of another player, float
ed over charging goalie Chris Massell and dropped into the left
corner of the net.
The jubilant Bronco squad dogpiled DiGiacomo while the
Santa Clara fans went wild.
However, with over 30 minutes left to play, there was plen
ty of time left for Stanford to come from behind and win.
The question was which Cardinal team would kick-off
after the goal — the squad that folded after North Carolina tallied
the first score in a 5-0 blowout, or the one that spotted Portland
two early scores but calmly retaliated with a five-goal blitz?
Unfortunately for Stanford supporters, it was the former.
The Cardinal lacked intensity and became more tentative as the
Broncos moved in for the kill.
Less than 10 minutes after the first score, sophomore mid
fielder Margaret Krawiec took the ball through the backpedaling
Stanford defense and shot point-blank under the diving Massell.
Late in the half, however, it looked like the Cardinal might
get back in the game. Rafanelli and Santa Clara fullback Lesley
Low got tangled up in the penalty box and fell to the ground while
Wall was gathering up the loose ball in front of the net.
As Low got to her feet, she looked around, deliberately
planted her cleats in Rafanelli's side and calmly walked over the
prone forward.
Since the foul was committed away from the goalie, who
had possession of the ball at the time, an ejection and penalty kick
were not automatically awarded for a foul committed in the penal
ty box. In that situation, it is up to the referee to decide whether
the player deserves a caution or ejection.
The referee whipped out the yellow card, so, despite
protests from Foudy and the Stanford bench, Lqw stayed in the
