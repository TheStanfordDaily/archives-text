# Golfers to close out fall season at Olympic Invite
## 
### SooSang Park Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf team will
complete the fall leg of its season this
week by competing in the Olympic Invi
tational, hosted by the University of San
Francisco.
The tournament will be held in San
Francisco's venerable Olympic Club, an
old, well-established golf course that has
been the site for the U.S. Open and other
mtgor tourneys. Jts length and great
number of trees make the Olympic Club
a notoriously difficult course.

"It's a really tough course. It makes
you stay awake all day long. Guys can't
go to sleep," said Stanford coach Wally
Goodwin.
Despite the rocky road ahead, the
squad does not seem to be lacking in con
fidence.
"Yes, it's a very tough course which
catches your attention more than an eas
ier course, but it makes you concentrate
more, and that tends to compensate for
the difficulty. I don't think anyone is
afraid of the course," said senior Dave
Rutkowski after completing his practice
round.

Rutkowski will be joined by sopho
mores Steve Burdick and Darren
Dragovich as well as freshmen Peter Lig
otti and David Garcia. Garcia will be
competing in his first collegiate event.
The Olympic Invitational has drawn a
drawn a strong field of contenders,
including UCLA, UC-Irvine, Washing
ton, UTEP, Utah, California and Pep
perdine.
Pacific 10 Conference powers UCLA
and Cal are expected to finish strong, and
with its win two weeks ago at the Bruin
Classic, Pepperdine has "displayed some
stamina," according to Goodwin.

With an eye toward postseason play
next May Goodwin declared, "It's impor
tant for us to start knocking some of
these teams ofT."
When questioned about the progress
of the squad thus far, Goodwin replied,
"I think we're on track. The plan this fall
was to get these guys a chance to play,
but everybody up there this week is
going to be older and more experienced.
I'd like to see us finish around the middle
of the field. In this field that would be a
good finish."
Rutkowski, hopes to display
some improvements to his game.
The senior, who won this tourna
ment two years ago, said, "I
haven't played too well lately, and
I've implemented some changes
to my stroke since the last tour
nament and would like to see how

they work out."
Specifically, the senior hopes
to improve his intermediate
game. "My tee shots have been
fine, and my chipping and putting
have been okay, but my approach
shots haven't been too accurate
lately," Rutkowski said.
The Cardinal tees off today and
will play the tournament's first
two rounds. The third and final
round will be played tomorrow.
