# Swim starts on good note
## Men win twice at home 
### Kay Hong 
Last weekend, the Cardinal men's swim team
began its season with a convincing 120-82 victo
ry over Fresno State and an unscored meet
against the U.S. National Team. Both meets
were dubbed "learning experiences" by head
coach Skip Kenney.
"Everyone swam events that they needed to
work on," said Kenney of the Cardinal lineup.
"We tried to see what we could learn — we try to
learn something new at every dual meet so we'll
be ready for NCAA's."
Friday against Fresno State, the Cardinal
swimmers learned their events rather well, as
the all-frosh 200 yd. medley relay team of Gordy
Woolbert, Brian Addleman, Alan Young and
Scott Gagner kicked off the meet with a winning
time of 1 minute, 37.86 seconds. After that, the
Cardinal never looked back.
Juniors Tyler Mayfield and Eddie Parenti
lengthened Stanford's lead by finishing first
(21.37) and second (22.20), respectively, in the
50 freestyle. Another senior, Erik Maurer
(52.64), led sophomores Clay Tippins (53.39)
and Chris Walton (53.96) in a 1-2-3 Cardinal
sweep of the 100 backstroke.
Other Stanford event winners included Eric
Diehl (1,000 free, 9:40.46), Kurt Grote (400
individual medley, 4:17.01), Joe Hudepohl
(100 butterfly, 51.18) and sophomore Greg
Maurer (500 free, 4:43.36), Erik's younger
brother.
Maurer trailed his Fresno State competitor
until the halfway point in the 500, when he
picked up the pace and cruised to a comfortable
five-second victory.
Coach Kenney was also "very pleased" by the
performance of the freshman class. "It was
exciting to see the freshmen swim for the first
time. They made some mistakes, but they're all
very correctable," Kenney said.
Saturday's meet against the National Team
was left unscored since many of the opponents
had retired from competitive swimming after
the 1992 Olympics.
Notable swims came from Derek Weatherford
in the 200 fly (1:53.15) and Greg Maurer in the
1,000 and 500 free (9:44.59 and 4:46.41).
One of the most enjoyable events was the 200
back, as a slew of Stanford swimmers went
head-to-head against, ironically enough, ex-
Cardinal team member and 1992 Olympian Jeff
Rouse.
Despite vocal efforts of the Cardinal men who
chanted a good-natured "beat Rouse," Rouse
emerged as the winner (1:49.94), followed by
current Stanford swimmers Ray Carey (1:56.57)
and Brian Addleman (1:59.74).
Earlier in the season, Kenney commented on
the loss of Rouse and its impact on this year's
team.
"Not only was Jeff a phenomenal swimmer,
but he was one of the best role models we've ever
had," Kenney said. "It's too early to figure out
how the slack will be picked up, but someone's
going to have to step in and do it — that's what
we're looking for now. Leadership through
example."
However, junior Brian Retterer believes that
the intensity and direction of the squad will be
more focused toward team unity this year.
"You can't compare last year's team to this
year's team. Last year was a unique year that
thankfully happens only once every four
years.
The Olympic year kills the team concept and
focuses on individual goals — we had to deal
with priorities of different individuals because
of Olympic Trials. This year, we only have one
goal — to become NCAA champs again. The
team has a whole different attitude."
That attitude was demonstrated this past
weekend, as the Cardinal men's team convinc
ingly showed that once again, Stanford will like
ly prove to be a powerhouse within the collegiate
swimming community.
