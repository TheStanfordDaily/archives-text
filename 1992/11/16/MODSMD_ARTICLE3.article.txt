## Business School students establish loan assistance database in L.A. after riots 
### Carly Berwick 
Until Steve Chan and some of
his fellow students in the Business
School arrived in Los Angeles last
summer, the gutted city was pro
cessing its thousands of emer
gency loan requests by hand.
But in a matter of days, the stu
dents equipped the city with a
database of all the applicants, dol
lars requested and dollars ap

proved. Chan said the establish
ment of the database "was nothing
complex. That's one of my
insights — to be able to go down
there for a couple of days and con
tribute a lot."
In the aftermath of last spring's
riots, 25 students from the Gradu
ate School of Business spent two
weeks assisting in the rehabilita
tion of the city. Group representa
tives shared their experiences Fri

day at the Business School.
They hope to parlay their new
found expertise into a permanent
Business School program — the
Urban Development Initiative —
under the already established
Public Management Program.
This new initiative would address
economic development in tradi
tionally depressed areas, said En
rique Lopez, co-chair of the "L.A.
Business Assistance Summer

1992 Project."
According to Lopez, a group of
students had been "pretty upset"
after the Los Angeles riots. They
decided to brainstorm as to "what
we can do as business students in
the rebuilding efforts, not only in
Los Angeles, but in the develop
ment of our inner cities," he said.
