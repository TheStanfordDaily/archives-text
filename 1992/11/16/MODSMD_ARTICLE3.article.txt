## Business School students establish loan assistance database in L.A. after riots 
### Carly Berwick 
Until Steve Chan and some of
his fellow students in the Business
School arrived in Los Angeles last
summer, the gutted city was pro
cessing its thousands of emer
gency loan requests by hand.
But in a matter of days, the stu
dents equipped the city with a
database of all the applicants, dol
lars requested and dollars ap

proved. Chan said the establish
ment of the database "was nothing
complex. That's one of my
insights — to be able to go down
there for a couple of days and con
tribute a lot."
In the aftermath of last spring's
riots, 25 students from the Gradu
ate School of Business spent two
weeks assisting in the rehabilita
tion of the city. Group representa
tives shared their experiences Fri

day at the Business School.
They hope to parlay their new
found expertise into a permanent
Business School program — the
Urban Development Initiative —
under the already established
Public Management Program.
This new initiative would address
economic development in tradi
tionally depressed areas, said En
rique Lopez, co-chair of the "L.A.
Business Assistance Summer

1992 Project."
According to Lopez, a group of
students had been "pretty upset"
after the Los Angeles riots. They
decided to brainstorm as to "what
we can do as business students in
the rebuilding efforts, not only in
Los Angeles, but in the develop
ment of our inner cities," he said.
With government connections
and corporate support from Apple
Computer and Westin-Bonaven
ture Hotels, the students flew
south to act on their concerns.
They identified the municipal
division of the loan assistance
programs as the area where they
could be most useful.
Under the direction of Los
Angeles deputy mayor Linda
Griego and her assistant, Sandy
Thomas, they were able to
improve the rate at which loans
were processed. For those small
businesses which had been reject
ed due to poor financial records or
missing information destroyed in

the riots, the students provided
reassessments based on personal
interviews.
"The work that we got done
would have not been done by
today if we had not done it," co
chair Jim Shelton said. "It's not
like we were doing rocket science,
but a couple of things required
some basic business background."
By helping small business dev
astated by the riots, volunteer
Justin Dooley said he saw first
hand how an aggregate buildup of
the local economy can lead to the
establishment of a decent tax base
and the eventual concentration of
money and capital needed for
long-term solutions.
This would effect the diffusion
of racial tensions, since, according
to volunteer Leticia Miranda, "If

everybody has opportunities and
chances, animosity towards other
groups decreases."
The three components of the
new Urban Development pro
gram will stress economic devel
opment, housing development
and a loan fund. According to
Lopez, the program will link
academia and practical experience
with a course in economic devel
opment which could be available
this spring.
The economic development
component would help develop
private enterprises in inner cities.
Lopez and Shelton emphasized
the importance of starting locally,
and said they already have identi
fied interested businesses in East
Palo Alto, Redwood City and East
San Jose.
