# Water polo routs Pacific, stays No.2 for 'Big Splash'
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
For more than a month, Stan
ford's second-ranked water polo
team has asserted its aquatic
supremacy over opponents such
as No. 3 USC, No. 5 Pepperdine
and other top-10 opponents. And
last Friday, they traveled to face
the mighty . . . University of the
Pacific?
Granted, Stanford had to con
front the eighth-ranked team in
the nation at their own pool, but
No. 8 may as well have been No.
28. The Cardinal trounced the
Tigers 15-2, as Pacific did not
look so mighty.
As Stanford head coach Dante
Dettamanti put it, the contest
served merely as a "good warm
up" for Big Splash against No. 1
California next weekend.
Indeed, even without
sophomore Ail-American and
team scoring leader Wolf
Wigo, who was rested by coach
Dettamanti, the Cardinal
hammered the Tigers' goalie
from every angle.
After a first quarter that
ended with a 2-1 Stanford
advantage, the Cardinal went on
to score 12 unanswered goals to
amass a 14-1 lead at one point in
the final quarter.
Junior Chris Wallin spear
headed the onslaught with four
goals, while freshman Josh
Leachman tallied three goals
and junior Antonio Rusquets

and senior Chris Smith each
contributed two. Sophomores
Bill Maguy and Frank Schneider
and seniors John Matarangas
and Chip Blankenhorn also
added one goal each.
Stanford's junior goalkeeper
Larry Bercutt gathered 12 saves
while sharing playing time with
classmate Zach Gallagher.
Wigo missed the trip due to a
back injury he suffered in prac
tice last week.
Although he can still swim
and shoot, he cannot exert his
full strength in those motions.
Team physicians believe Wigo
simply strained his back.
According to Dettamanti,
however, Wigo returned to
scrimmage too soon and aggra
vated his injury. And the coach
doesn't know when his leading
scorer will recover.
Until then, Wigo's team
mates will have to fill the gap he
left. Thus far, as demonstrated
by the Pacific encounter, the
Cardinal offense has continued
its success.
Dettamanti noted in particu
lar that Wallin — who led all
scorers in the game — has lifted
his game steadily over the sea
son, and, in his eyes, has
improved the most of any player
since the year before.
Perhaps in combination with
Wigo's return, Stanford may
yet break its 11-game losing
streak to Cal at the annual Big
Splash.
