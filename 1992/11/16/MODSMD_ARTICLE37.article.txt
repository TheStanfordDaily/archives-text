# Shantytowns offer bigger picture of poverty
## Senior's return to Stanford 'culture shock' after working for social change in Brazil 
### Elisabeth Witchel 
Imagine living in a makeshift shack, with
out running water or sanitation and some
times even food. It is a world few Stanford stu
dents have had personal contact with.
But not senior Keisha Albright. For several
years, she has been personally acquainted
with such problems in Brazil, working with
shantytown communities in Sao Paulo and
volunteering through Amnesty International
to improve the plight of the country's street
children, whose numbers are estimated at 7
million.
"To spend a year in a shantytown and come
back to Palo Alto can be disconcerting," said
Albright, who described her return as "culture
shock."
"Poverty isn't the problem as much as
inequality," said Albright, who is is currently
writing her thesis on women's participation in
grassroots shantytown organizing.
"Brazil has the 10th largest economy (in
the world), yet 10 percent of Sao Paulo — over
1 million people — are living in shantytowns,"
she explained.
Albright found it particularly interesting
that women comprise between 70 and 80 per
cent of the participants in grassroots move

ments working for squatters' rights in Brazil
and Latin America. "These are the women of
the shantytown communities, as well as nuns
and social workers."
While living in Brazil, Albright became
interested in the theoretical aspects of social
change, utilizing her ability to gather data in
consideration of the larger scheme of things.

"Social work can be so stressful that you
can get too easily caught up in the smaller
problems and lose the big picture," said
Albright. "I see myself making a contribution
on the 'bigger picture' level."
Working very closely with families and
women in the shantytowns, Albright arranged
and facilitated discussions about alternative
ways of making a living and wrote articles for
a newsletter.
She also helped design and administer a
survey of local squatters' rights organizations

that work for such things as running water
and basic facilities, and "confirming access to
the land so it won't be taken away," Albright
said.
Ironically, while doubts about her education
spurred her to work in Sao Paulo, her experi
ence there convinced Albright that her niche
was in academia; now she plans to pursue a
career as a professor. Although she does not
wish to abandon social concerns, she said she
"will not have grass roots work as a career."
In the shantytown of Sao Jose, Albright
found the people warm and was touched at
how easily they "let me come into their homes
and community," she said. Though she was an
outsider, "they were willing to let me relate to
them on their terms."
She said she "made strong ties to the peo
ple" and in some ways feels "closer to that
community than to the educated elite in Sao
Paulo."
Because of their willingness to share infor
mation, Albright feels a strong obligation to
translate her thesis into Portuguese for the
community. The people she worked with
requested this so that they may have a "clear
historical memory and teach their children
about struggles in terms of not losing hope and
the ability to change, which often gets lost."
