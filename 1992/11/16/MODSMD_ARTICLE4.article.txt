## Fraternity hosts campus visit for middle school kids 
### Chul Ho Hyun 
Every afternoon, Clifford
Brown, armed with a stack of
newspapers, walks along the im
poverished neighborhood streets
of East Palo Alto on his newspaper
route, earning extra cash to help
out his family.
But the 14-year-old — who
talks of becoming a professional
football player or a history teacher
— says he wants "more in life"
than the place where he lives,
studies and works currently has to
offer.
Brown was one of 35 boys from
East Palo Alto's Castano School
who visited campus Friday, host
ed by the Stanford chapter of
Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. The
seventh and eighth graders, whom
teachers have designated as "at
risk students," were participating
in the fraternity's ongoing Guide
Right Program.
Kappa Alpha Psi established
the Guide Right Program with
Castano School three years ago
"to portray to young people that
young black men, and other stu
dents of color, are exercising op
tions on campus," according to
Mike Ross, an alumnus of the
African-American fraternity. The
theme for this year is "Positive
Black Male Role Models Working
Together Into the 21st Century,"

he said.
These students are at risk be
cause they are beginning to make
decisions about educational
goals, while being exposed to neg
ative elements in the community
such as drugs and crime, accord
ing to Willie Hill, president of the
fraternity's chapter. "We want to
catch them at this turning point
in their lives, and provide role
models and positive mentoring,"
he said.
Brown and his classmates
spent the afternoon watching
dramatic and musical perfor
mances by various African-Amer
ican student artists, including
the KUUMBA Dance Ensemble.
They heard Anna Marie Porras,
assistant director of admissions,
speak about preparing for college
admissions, and they later at
tended a barbecue at Ujamaa. "I
came today because we're the
chosen ones. I feel pretty good
about myself," Brown said.
Last Friday marked the begin
ning of this year's relationship
between Kappa Alpha Psi and
Castano School. Upcoming
events include bringing the stu
dents back to campus to visit
classes, taking them on a cruise of
San Francisco Bay, and fundrais
ing to contribute to the Guide
Right Program's scholarship
fund.
