# Staff retire early, ease budget woes
## Nearly 500 take advantage of incentives 
### Lindsey Marcus 
For 62-year-old Lorraine
Yahnke, who worked in the Med
ical Center for 21 years, Stan
ford's Staff Early Retirement In
centive (SERI) program helped
her decide to retire.
"It gave [me anl incentive to
leave, and security to go on," said
Yahnke, who was employed in the
Medical Specialty and Oncology
Department. "My husband asked
me to do this so we could be to
gether."
Since her retirement Aug. 1,
Yahnke has pursued her love of
art, traveled to visit family, and
bought a van.
Faced with shrinking budgets,
the University implemented the
SERI program to decrease the
amount of money it spends on
staff salaries without having to re
sort to layoffs, according to Keith
Smith, manager of Employee Re
lations. Officials said the program
succeeded beyond their expecta
tions.
SERI offered severance pay
and official retiree benefits to staff
members who decided to retire be
fore attaining "official retiree"
status â€” reaching the age of 55
and completing at least 10 years of
service to the University. Those
employees whose age and number
of years worked at the University
totaled at least 75 were allowed to
claim retiree status as well.
Eligible staff members could
apply between Mar. 15 and Oct.
15, and must terminate their work
at the University by Aug. 31,1993.
Under the SERI program,
1,280 staff members were eligible
to retire. These staff members in
cluded non-tenure track faculty,

senior research associates, senior
lecturers and Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center staff.
Maiy Ann Mendonza, a retire
ment counselor in the Benefits Of
fice and former project manager
for the benefits program, said
SERI was very successful because
more people than expected took
advantage of it.
"The goal was one-third (420)
of the 1,280 persons who met the
criteria," she said. "The final
count was 497. From a numbers
perspective, it was successful."
"It's giving staff the opportuni
ty they need and Stanford the staff
redactions it needs, so it's basical
ly a win-win situation," said Lori
Lee, communications specialist in
the Total Compensation Deptart
ment.
The amount of the incentive
salary supplement is based on the
number of years of regular Uni
versity service. It ranges from four
months of salary for working at
least 10 but less than 12 years, to
12 months of salary for working
26 or more years.
SERI was designed to create a
staff program comparable to the
Faculty Early Retirement Pro
gram (FERP). FERP applies to
tenure-lined professors and mem
bers of the Academic Council, and
has recently been phased out.
According to Mendonza, the
benefits of early retirement are
both tangible and intangible.
"The incentive has provided a
number of people with a transi
tional bridge," she said. "It has al
lowed other people to retire earlier
and begin to pursue some lifelong
interests and avocations."
