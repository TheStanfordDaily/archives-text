# New Directory arrives
## Improvements include index, more maps 
### Jeff Brock Editorial staff 
Stanford telephone operators
can breathe a sigh of relief, thanks
to a 769-page tome hitting campus
today — the 1992-1993 Stanford
Directory.
Undergraduates living on cam
pus may pick up a Directory from
their resident assistants, said project
director Chris Eisenberg. Off-cam
pus undergraduates should have al
ready received cards that they can
exchange for a free Directory in the
ASSU business office, he said.
Graduate students can obtain a
Directory through their depart
ments, while faculty and staff will
have their Directories distributed
to their departments. The Direc
tories will also be available at the
Stanford Bookstore and Central
Stores, Eisenberg said.
He said the deliveries of the
31,500 copies should be complete
by next Wednesday.
The 12-member staff reorga

nized last year's labyrinthine blue
"Campus Directory" section.
"In the past, it's been a night
mare, really, to find anything," he
said. "We made a valiant effort to
put things in their proper place.
Things should be where you instinc
tively think to look for them, instead
of some bureaucratic jargon."
Medical Center numbers are
now listed under a separate or
ange section and a purple "Farm
Index" allows quick access to
phone numbers and information.
The maps section has been ex
panded from four to 16 pages —
including a full-color campus map
and a map of Lake Tahoe — and
eight extra pages of coupons have
been inserted.
The Directory is printed on all
recycled paper, using only soy
based inks, rather than petroleum
based inks. "We make an effort to
make it as environment-friendly
as possible," Eisenberg said,
adding that last year's book can go
straight into the recycling bin.
