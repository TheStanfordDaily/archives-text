STEPHEN SCHWARTZ
will discuss recent developments in Nicaragua and his latest book
A Strange Silence
The Emergence of Democracy in Nicaragua
(published by ICS)
"A STRANGE SILENCE is a valuable contribution to the
discussion of the Nicaraguan conflict, which was obscured in
the U.S. by ignorant journalists and intellectuals, ingenuous or
motivated by ideological passions."
â€” Octavio Paz
Nobel Prize Laureate
