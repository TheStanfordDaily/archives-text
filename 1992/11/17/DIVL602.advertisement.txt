Associated Students Program Board presents
American
by Jacob Holdt
A multi-media show of a Danish vagabond's
5 year journey through America's underclass.
"American Pictures challenges the
viewer to act, not merely to react
cathartically. It expresses a global
reality and responsibility we all
share... It possesses an objectivity
which only a non-native American
could express. It is a presentation
that all Americans must experience
for themselves."
