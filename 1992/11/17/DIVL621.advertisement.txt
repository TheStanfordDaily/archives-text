ELFQUEST
GRAPHIC NOVEL Series
by Wendy & Richard Pini
For fifteen years the adventures of Cutter
and his elfin tribe of Wolfriders have captured
imaginations and excited readers young and old. The
American Library Association calls Elfquest
"...one of the most important works in
American fantasy..." You'll call it rousing,
thought-provoking, romantic, fun, engrossing,
sexy, aware —and most of all, an enthralling journey
into fine illustrated fantasy!
