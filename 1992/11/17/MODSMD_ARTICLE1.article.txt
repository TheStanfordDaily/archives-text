### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
Hoover Institution officials will help unveil a
new historical exhibit today in Moscow detailing
economic and commercial relations between the
United States and Russia during the beginning of
the 20th century.
The exhibition, titled "Making Things Work,"
examines issues such as trade relations, joint man
ufacturing ventures and foreign aid between the
the two nations from 1900 to 1930, and details the
effects of entrepreneurs, relief organizations and
technology transfer.
"In many ways, the experiences of that time are
being repeated today," said Hoover Deputy Direc
tor Charles Palm in an interview last Friday before
he left for Moscow.
Palm, Hoover Director John Raisian and Her
bert Hoover 111 will join Russian officials in
today's ceremonies in the Russian Parliament
building.
Material for the exhibit was drawn from the
newly opened Russian archives as well as the insti
tution's vast collection at Stanford.
Included in the project are records of pre-revolu
tionary Russian financial institutions, joint Russ
ian-American corporations and technical documen
tation from Russian engineers.
Another focus of the display is the American in
volvement in relief efforts during the periods of
famine and suffering following the 1917 revolution.
The exhibit highlights the work of the American
Relief Administration and other humanitarian or
ganizations.
"At a time when many changes are taking place
in Russia and the need for expertise and economic
cooperation is great, examples from the past have a
renewed relevance," wrote Palm and Rudolf
Pikhoia, chairman of the Committee on Archival
Affairs of the Russian Federation, in the exhibit's
catalog.
"It is hoped that lessons from the past will in
form the present."
According to Palm, the exhibit is one of a number
of activities resulting from a newly established rela
tionship between Russian archivists and Hoover.
The exhibit will come to Stanford in February
and is scheduled to be displayed in the Hoover
Memorial Building.
Earlier this year, Hoover embarked on a massive
project to microfilm the archives of the former So
viet Communist Party. The project, which is ex
pected to take five years to complete and cost $3 mil
lion, will eventually yield microfilm records of more
than 25 million pieces of paper.
