Clinton, Congress promise 'new era*
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — President-elect Clinton and Demo
cratic congressional leaders promised a "new era" of action yester

would be their top priorities.
Clinton declared an end to "the Cold War between the Congress
and the White House" and promised, "Pennsylvania Avenue will
run both ways again."
The president-elect said that in his first meeting with congres
sional leaders — a three-hour dinner Sunday night — everyone
agreed that "creating jobs, raising incomes, getting our economy
moving again and the long-term competitive strength of the Amer
ican economy" were the main objectives.
Democratic leaders also share his commitment, Clinton said, to
health-care reform and bringing down the deficit.
In a wide-ranging news conference, Clinton also said:
• Despite the deficit, he'd make good on his campaign pledge of
tax breaks for the middle class;
• There are several options available to deal with the strife in the
former Yugoslavia, "short of sending troops in"; and
• He wouldn't improve diplomatic relations with Vietnam until
that country's leaders offer the "fullest possible accounting" of
Americans missing in action since the Vietnam War.
Navy fights to ban gay sailor
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The government returned to court yes
terday to fight a judge's order that gave a gay sailor his job back,
while the sailor is suing to overturn the Pentagon's ban on homo
sexuals.
The Navy is seeking to overturn the order that returned Petty
Officer Keith Meinhold, 30, of Palo Alto, to duty at Moffett Naval
Air Station. The 12 1/2-year veteran was discharged in August after
he went on national television and revealed his sexual orientation.
The Pentagon has banned homosexuals, arguing that discipline
and morale would suffer if they were admitted. Meinhold contends
the half-century-old ban is unconstitutional.
President-elect Clinton has said he plans to overturn the ban.
Somali refugees arrive in Yemen
SAN'A, Yemen (AP) — A ship crowded with 2,500 Somali
refugees limped into the remote Yemeni port of Mukalla yesterday,
where the refugees received their first food and water in several
days but were forbidden to go ashore.
Several hours later, the ship headed on to Aden, some 300 miles
to the southwest, French naval officials said. U.N. workers in Aden
were putting up tents and digging latrines on the beach to prepare
for the refugees.
There was no immediate confirmation of reports that as many
as 100 people might have died during the ship's harrowing six
day, 1,200-mile voyage from Somalia with little or no food or
water.
Yemeni officials said the ship was ordered last night to leave
Mukalla, which was not equipped to handle the refugees, after they
were provided with fish, flour, milk, water and fuel.
