DETROIT (AP) — Two police
officers were charged yesterday
with murder and one with
manslaughter in the beating
death of black motorist Malice
Green.
A fourth officer was charged
with assault with intent to do
great bodily harm. Three other
officers who also had been sus
pended after the Nov. 5 beating
were not charged.
Green, 35, died of head injuries
after being beaten on an inner-city
street near a suspected drug house.
Wayne County Prosecutor John D.
O'Hair refused to give details of
the beating, but witnesses have
said it occurred after Green and
police argued when he dropped off
a passenger near the house.
Three of the officers charged
— including the two charged with
murder — are white. The officer
charged with manslaughter is
black.
Undercover officers Larry
Nevers and Walter Budzyn were
charged with second-degree mur
der. They could get life in prison if
convicted.
Sgt. Freddie Douglas was

charged with involuntary man
slaughter, which carries a maxi
mum 15-year sentence, and willful
neglect of duty, punishable by a
year. The ranking officer on the
scene, he was accused of failing to
try to stop the beating.
Officer Robert Lessnau was
charged with assault with intent
to do great bodily harm, punish
able by 10 years in prison.
O'Hair said there was not
enough evidence to charge the
three other officers. Those offi
cers remain on indefinite suspen
sion, police Sgt. Christopher Buck
said yesterday.
Nevers, 52, was known in the
neighborhood as Starsky, after
the cop in television's "Starsky
and Hutch." Budzyn, 42, was
named an Officer of the Year by
his union in 1990 for making 31
arrests and recovering six stolen
cars. But the two also had been
named in 25 citizen complaints
and five lawsuits.
Budzyn and Nevers were freed
on $100,000 bond each, Douglas
on $25,000 and Lessnau on
$10,000. A hearing was set for
Dec. 14.
