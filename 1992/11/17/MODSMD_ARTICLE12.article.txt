# U.N. OKs more sanctions for Yugoslavia
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Security
Council voted yesterday to authorize a naval
blockade on the Danube River and the Adriatic
coast to tighten economic sanctions on
Yugoslavia. It said force could be used if neces
sary to back up the blockade.
The vote on the resolution was 13-0. China
and Zimbabwe abstained because they felt the
Serbian-led government of Belgrade has no real
control over the Bosnian Serbs whose aggres
sion has been condemned around the world.
The council cited Chapter Seven of the U.N.
Charter, which it has previously used to enforce
embargoes and bans on international weapons
trade with Iraq and Libya.
"The Security Council must adopt firm mea
sures to deal with the problem," said Russian
Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov. "Bosnia-Herze
govina has been devastated."
Twenty-seven nations, led by Islamic coun

tries defending the besieged Muslim-led gov
ernment of Bosnia, denounced Belgrade for
instigating war, capturing vast territories in
Bosnia and Croatia and driving out non-Serbs
in a vicious "ethnic cleansing" campaign.
Serbian forces have occupied about 70 percent
of Bosnia. Most of the rest is held by Croat mili
tias, with only Sarajevo and a few other towns
still in control of the Muslim-led government.
Islamic countries, including Pakistan, Iran,
Afghanistan and Jordan, wanted the council
to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia so it could
rearm, but the council refused to consider that
step.
The main thrust of the new resolution is to
close off loopholes in the economic embargo on
Serbia and Montenegro adopted May 30, and
the ban on arms supplies to all the former
Yugoslav republics, which has been in force for
more than a year.

Until now, ships moving up the Danube River
have not been boarded and searched. Port
authorities merely radio the captain of a ship to
ask what the cargo is and where it is bound. After
that, on it goes, often all the way to Belgrade or
Montenegrin ports on the Adriatic coast.
The new Security Council resolution autho
rizes nations or regional organizations "to use
such measures commensurate with the specific
circumstances as may be necessary. .. to halt
all inward and outward maritime shipping in
order to inspect and verify their cargoes and
destinations."
The new resolution specifically prods Bul
garia and Romania to patrol the Danube, which
also flows along their borders.
NATO and the European Community's
Western European Union each currently have
five frigates along the Adriatic coast, but up to
now have not been authorized to inspect vessels.
