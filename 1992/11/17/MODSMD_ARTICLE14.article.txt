Forced retirement rule
should be replaced by an
enticing pension plan

ITS AMAZING WHAT A little
prompting from the U.S. gov
ernment can do.
Last year, the threat to cut off
valuable research funds caused
Stanford to revamp its alcohol pol
icy.
Now, a government anti-dis
crimination law has made Stan
ford abandon its mandatory retire
ment age of 70.
While many students resented
the forced imposition of the new,
more restrictive alcohol policy,
everyone should thank Washing
ton D.C. for forcing Stanford out of
the dark ages and into a voluntary
retirement policy.
Indeed, it seems strange that a
university such as Stanford — the
first university to grant benefits to
students' domestic partners —
should be lagging behind govern
ment standards of fair treatment
towards the elderly.
While a forced retirement policy
is perhaps the most efficient and
effective way to ensure that
younger, sometimes more energet
ic, scholars get a chance at profes
sorships, it suffers from two glar
ing problems.
•First, it is a clear case of age
discrimination. A policy which
bases its decisions on age rather
than merit is unfair. That no one
within the faculty or the Universi
ty community challenged the dis
criminatory policy earlier borders
on the embarrassing.
•Second, the logic behind
mandatory retirement is faulty.
Just as reaching 21 doesn't neces
sarily mean one has reached matu
rity, reaching 70 does not mean
that one cannot be a valuable asset
to the University.
Some faculty remain productive
and, in fact, offer valuable academ
ic wisdom and perspective, long
after they turn 70.

Others, as many students dis
cover on a regular basis, become
an economic and academic liability
much before they become septua
genarians.
Being 70 means different things
to different people, and the Uni
versity would do well to recognized
that fact.
In fairness to the University,
it is clear that economic con
siderations, not a desire to dis
criminate, lay at the heart of
the former policy.
This is no excuse, however, for
its existence. There are economic
reasons for a number of different
policies — such as only admitting
students who can afford the whole
cost of their education — that
thankfully would never be tolerat
ed.
The economic problems with
allowing voluntary retirement can
be mitigated, though, with the
adoption of a generous retirement
plan. As recent success of the Staff
Early Retirement Incentive pro
gram shows, the right package can
achieve the goals of a mandatory
retirement policy without violat
ing anyone's rights.
It is the method and not the goal
behind mandatory retirement that
was offensive. There is clearly an
understandable motivation for the
University to continue to hire
young faculty members.
New faculty members bring new
ideas and "fresh blood" to Stan
ford's research and teaching
efforts.
The right retirement policy
would make room for these new
members while allowing older fac
ulty still committed to their fields
to continue working.
The University's challenge,
then, is quite clear — and quite
simple. It must offer a retirement
package generous enough to
ensure that a significant number
of aging faculty will accept it.
It is the very simpleness and
logic of this solution that make the
previous years of the University's
age discrimination such an out
rage.
