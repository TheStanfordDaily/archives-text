## Senior skips Big Game 
### 
This year will be the first
year I won't be going to Big Game. I
never have been a football fan.
Playing football looks painful. And
despite numerous explanations, I still
don't understand the purpose of the tight
end or why the referees throw all those
flags on the ground.
But that didn't stop me from buying
four other years' worth of season passes,
putting on that Stanford sweatshirt and
jumping in all the right places during "All
Right Now."
Why? Because Big Game isn't about
football. Whether the team is zero and
eight or going to the Fiesta Bowl, students
are going to go to Big Game. Winning Big
Game is glorious because it gives us all the
satisfaction of giving a certain mangy
golden bear an axe — right in the neck.
Rivalry in reality is ever-present and
ugly. The damage that gang-related vio
lence causes in our inner cities is appar
ent. But Big Game is not reality, and I
don't think anybody takes the Stanford -
Cal rivalry a bit seriously.
Once we get to the stadium, though,
we will head to separate sections and
cheer loudly for violent things to happen
to representatives of the opposing side. It
all seems perfectly reasonable in context.
And it is the context of the rivalry that
is important here. To take it seriously
would be to miss the point of Big Game.
In an article about Balinese cockfighting,

anthropologist Clifford Geertz explains
that "the cockfight renders ordinary,
everyday experience comprehensible by
presenting it in terms which have had
their practical purposes removed and
been reduced to the level of sheer appear
ances." And the appearance of a rivalry
with Cal without the cost of actual vio
lence is the appeal of Big Game.
Whether we win or lose will not affect
the future of the cosmos, or the future of
our own lives. And that's precisely why
we like it — for one week, the complexity
of the world is reduced to a simple Us ver
sus Them. The goal is easily defined—
Beat the Weenies! And the stakes are so
small that losing has no real negative
affect. The winner gets The Axe, and
bragging rights for the next year.
Perhaps the most attractive part of our
rivalry with Cal is that it attempts to
define a collective Stanford identity. By
yelling "We got in!" we are not only
acknowledging our separateness from
(and superiority over) Cal, but we are
acknowledging an overarching similarity
of experience with each other.
Oski, Gaities, et al.— the simplicity of
the Big Game myth makes the underlying
tensions of our lives very clear. An aim for
success, a fear of failure. A desire to bond
with others, and a need to separate our
selves. Big Game allows us to play out
these paradoxical relationships in the
safety of our own stadium without risking

our emotions or our futures.
When you are a person who feels para
lyzed by options as much as I do, Big
Game is a glorious opportunity to stand
confidently on one side. To belong feels
good. I suppose it's the same reason that
people have such conviction about politi
cal parties.
But is there such a thing as a collective
Stanford identity? The quilt that will
blanket the Stanford section on Saturday
will be red, but it will be a patchwork; the
dorms and fraternities and alumni and
friends that sit next to each other are
hardly a homogeneous group. And of
course there are those who choose not to
attend at all.
There is a lot that is attractive about
Big Game. So why my disillusionment?
It's a simple reason, like the rivalry itself.
The Big Game division between Stanford
and Cal is arbitrary — as arbitrary as the
appearance of unity that we put on for the
day. And arbitrary gets old. To define one
self by standing against is easy. The chal
lenge is to stand for.
