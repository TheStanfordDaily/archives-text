Ram's Head can't afford to sport Flicks'new stereo system

ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY OF
this week the Ram's Head The
atrical Society will present its
annual show, "Big Game Gaieties." This
is one of two musicals produced in
Memorial Auditorium each year. The
other is produced by Ram's Head in the
spring.
Ram's Head is the only student orga
nization that presents shows in Mem
Aud. No other student group can afford
the space. The addition of a new sound
system may make the space too expen
sive for any group to use.
Ram's Head is not opposed to making
improvements in Mem Aud, but the bill
before the ASSU to install a new sound
system could cripple us permanently and

prevent further productions in Mem
Aud.
Our opposition to the plan is three
fold. Initially, if the new sound system
will benefit all students, then the reser
vations about the ASSU funding the
entire project are unfounded. If students
want the system, than the funds that
are collected from students should pay
for it.
Instead, Ram's Head will be saddled
with an additional $300 per year bur
den. Unlike Sunday Flicks, we aren't
willing to pass the cost on to the con
sumer. Ram's Head's already tightened
budget would be harmed substantially.
Second, there is no guarantee that,
once Events and Services controls the

system, fees will not increase. Because
the University cannot charge rent to use
Mem Aud, it charges extreme fees for
supervision, custodial assistance and
additional lighting and maintenance.
There has not been any concrete
proof that the new sound system would
help those stuck in the second balcony
hear our shows.
The Daily editorial claimed that stu
dent groups who did not want the sound
enhancement would not have to pay;
this is untrue. We would have to pay a
user fee on the new system regardless of
how much of it we use. We would have
to pay even more if we want to use the
complete system — almost three times
what we pay now.

We all know the sound in Mem Aud
could be better, but a system designed to
help the sound of Flicks is not necessari
ly going to carry voices to the second
balcony.
If the new sound system is desired by
the student body, we would like to see
them talk to the ASSU Senate to show
support for the system to be funded
completely by the ASSU. It is both
unfair and illogical to place a further
burden on the one student group which
uses the theatrical space as a true the
ater.
