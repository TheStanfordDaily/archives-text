# Show support for new system at tomorrow's ASSU Senate meeting
## 
### 
I am writing to you as the ASSU Sun
day Flicks manager to ask for your sup
port. We are currently in the midst of a
proposal to put a new sound system in
Memorial Auditorium.
This sound system, which would
include Dolby Stereo Surround Sound,
would replace the 30-year old "mono" sys
tem currently in use in the auditorium.
Although the main beneficiary of the
system will be Flicks, the system has
been designed to meet the needs of other
student user groups such as Ram's Head
Theatrical Society, Concert Network and
the Drama Department, as well as out
side groups such as Lively Arts.
Because of the cost recovery plan
approved by the Budget and Finance
Committee, the $200,000 system will
only cost the ASSU about $50,000.
Although the ASSU is a non-profit

student organization, it currently holds a
project reserve fund of approximately
$500,000, much of which is from past
Flicks revenue. The cost of this project is
one-tenth of the student government
reserves, but is a solid investment that
will benefit a large percentage of the stu
dent body for many years to come.
This bill goes before the ASSU Senate
on Tuesday, Nov. 17. I know that many
of you are very interested in having this
system installed, but without a strong
showing of student support at that meet
ing, the bill will likely fail.
The senate believes that students do
not want a new sound system, so I ask you
to come to the senate meeting and show
that the support is, in fact, out there. The
meeting will be held at 7 p.m. on Tuesday,
in room 190 of the Law School.
If you want to make a short speech to
the Senate in favor of the sound system,
you need to contact Senate Chair Ron
Brown either at 725-ASSU or at the
beginning of the meeting.
Please come and encourage the ASSU
to give something back to students.
Suzanne Anderson
Flicks Manager
