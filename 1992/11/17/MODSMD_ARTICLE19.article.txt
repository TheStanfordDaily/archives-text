# "700K budget shortfall" though it is not small, is not a shortfall at all
## 
### 
I would like to correct and clarify
information included in the article on
Athletic class fees in the Nov. 9 Daily.
Although the Athletic Department
administers the Physical Education and
Recreation programs and is committed
to providing for their success, funding
for these areas is provided by University
general funds.
The "S7OOK budget shortfall" referred
to in the article is not a shortfall but is a
planned reduction in the Physical Educa
tion and Recreation budget. The reduc
tion was established by the University's
Committee on Budget and Strategic
Planning in November 1991 and will be
implemented over three years.
All program changes affecting the
1992-93 academic year, including class
fees, have been in effect since Septem
ber, and no additional cuts or fees will

be put into place this year.
In recent years, the University has
provided minor support for specific inter
collegiate sports that could offer no schol
arships, were non-revenue producing and
had broad-based student participation.
As part of its overall long-range bud
get plan, the University elected to reduce
its support of Physical Education and
Recreation programs and to eliminate its
subsidy of broad-based varsity sports.
However, budgets for these sports are
expected to remain at the same level,
and future funding will be provided
through a combination of intercollegiate
revenue, gifts and fund raising.
The Athletic Department has a sound
financial plan for both the intercolle
giate and academic programs for the
current year.
Regarding the 1993-94 budget reduc
tions, various changes are being consid
ered; however, no decisions have been
made. Discussions are in progress, and
decisions will be made in early February
when the department submits its pro
posed academic budget to the Provost.
