## Setter lifts Cardinal play 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
You might know her as the four-year starting
setter for the No. 2 Stanford women's volleyball
team, the "quarterback" of the explosive, fast-mov
ing Cardinal offense. But for a brief moment in
senior tri-captain Carrie Feldman's ninth grade
year, Stanford almost lost one of its greatest future
assets to another sport.
"I wanted to be a gymnast then," Feldman con
fessed, "but I was too tall for the team."
Thousands of Cardinal volleyball fans are grate
ful for that twist of fate because shortly thereafter
Feldman discovered volleyball at Davis High
School, and the rest, as they say, is history.
"I was an alternate my first year on the team,"
said Feldman. "It wasn't until junior year that they
moved me over to setter full-time."
At setter, Feldman found a home and led her high
school team to the California state championships in
her senior year, only to lose to an Irvine squad led by
a high-school superstar named Bev Oden.
"It was like set-Bev, set-Bev, set-Bev, every
time," Feldman said. "She was incredible."
Feldman wouldn't get the championship ring,
but she would get the chance to join her nemesis
Oden, as well as other high school rivals like Kristi
Paaso and Laurie Sawin, on the Stanford women's
volleyball team. To Feldman, the choice to attend
Stanford was easy.
"I always wanted to play at Stanford — I lived in
Davis, so I had watched Stanford play before, and I
just liked the school in general. It was really the
only place I considered going when I was recruited."
Feldman didn't have much time to savor her
acceptance to Stanford on a volleyball scholarship,
because after setter Lara Asper injured her back
during the 1989 season, Feldman was inserted into
the lineup as the starting setter. Since then, she has
devoted four years to learning how to effectively
run a high-powered Cardinal offense.
"I think I've worked on a lot of things that have
improved my game," Feldman said. "I've tried to
speed up the offense more — setting lower and
faster to the outside, going to the quick set more
and beating the blocks were key. I feel better than I
ever have now, but I'm still trying to improve every
thing I do out there."
Last year, Feldman watched the team finish the
regular season undefeated in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and garner a No. 1 national ranking, only to
lose to conference-rival UCLA in the NCAA Tour
nament. Feldman recalls last year's loss to the Bru
ins as a wake-up call for the team's winning drive.
"We had a great season for most of the year, but
it seemed to all fall apart at the end," Feldman said.

"I think we kind of took UCLA for granted in
NCAA's and figured we'd have no problem with
them."
This year, Stanford occupies the same position
the Bruins faced last year, having lost to the
defending national champions twice already this
season. Feldman said she hopes this time, with the
roles reversed, history might repeat itself.
"We realized (last year) that there was only one
game that mattered against them, and that was in
the Tournament," Feldman said. "They're a domi
nant team, and they play well, but they're not
unbeatable, and we're hoping they make the same
mistake we did: take us for granted."
Feldman not only enjoys being in the thick of the
hunt for a national championship but also likes the
chemistry between players on the squad this year.
"All of us get along super-well — we communi
cate more, we're more vocal," she said. "It's finally
all clicked for us on offense, and a lot of it is because
we help each other out and have a good time play
ing together."
In particular, Feldman is impressed with the
freshman talent on the team this year, players who
have seen a good amount of court time in Shaw's
rotations.
"They're super-fun," Feldman said. "Marni
(Triefenbach) came to Stanford from the middle of
nowhere and brought a real different hitting style.
She's a problem for other teams because she has a
real powerful arm and knows how to find the gaps
in the defense."
Feldman also had praise for freshman hitter
Wendy Hromadka, a player who has provided a
great amount of spark from the bench for the Car
dinal this year.
"Wendy's smart, and she plays a good, all
around game, on offense and defense," Feldman
said. "Don gave her the chance, and she just jumped
at it."
But Feldman reserves perhaps the greatest
affection for her fellow graduating senior team
mates, who she's gotten to admire as players and as
friends.
"We've had a great four years playing together —
it's just been a fun time," Feldman said. "We're
excited about the end of the season, and it'll be
great to say good-bye with them."
This weekend, Feldman travels with the team to
Berkeley to face California in the Big Match. The
game will wrap up the team's conference schedule
and finish just in time for Feldman to get some
sleep before Big Game on Saturday. Feldman pre
dicts a Stanford victory in Weenieland on the vol
leyball court, as well as in Memorial Stadium.


Al Green — Daily file
Cardinal setter Carrie Feldman's consistently strong setting will be an asset to the Stanford volleyball
squad as they round up their season against Cal on Friday and head into NCAA action.
"Our football team will win —
we're a machine," Feldman
asserted.
Feldman has the rest of this
season to go for the championship
ring she's been longing for, but
after the season ends, there's one
more ring Carrie Feldman is
going for, and she'll need help

from two of Stanford's best
women's volleyball players.
This summer, senior team
mates Bev Oden and Jennifer
Jackson will be bridesmaids at
Feldman's wedding in Memorial
Church.
For a player like Feldman who
has dished hundreds of assists to
hitters like Oden and Jackson, it
only seems fit that they return
the favor with an assist of their
own.
