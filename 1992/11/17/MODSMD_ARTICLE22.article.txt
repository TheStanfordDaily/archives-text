# Expect the unexpected in Big Game madness

an how me someone who
get up for Big
k-/Game," spoke linebacker
Ron George, "and I'll show you
someone that doesn't play football
for Stanford."
As he basked in the glory of a 40-
3 Cougar thrashing, the Cardinal's
postgame pontificator successfully
dispelled any notion that Stanford
will be looking ahead to a Jan. 1
bowl bid — and past the Cal Bears.
"Big Game blocks all vision. That's
honest."
And it's true; you've heard the
cliches. When Big Game time rolls
around, throw out the records and
forget about winning streaks. The
annual Stanford-Cal contest does
put the proverbial blinders on the
Bay Area sports world.
Those blinders do a fine job of
blocking out the postseason bowl
picture, but they can't keep us
from peering in on our cross-bay
cohorts. And as we glance across
the water, it's tough not to notice
that these are troubled times in the

Land of the Weenies.
After a glorious 10-2 1991 sea
son, the Bears have slipped to a
miserable 4-6 record under first
year head coach Keith Gilbertson.
Early in the year, Cal found a way
to lose against the conference's top
notch clubs. Turnovers plagued the
Weenies in narrow losses to USC
and Arizona.
But it was not until the last two
weeks that the wheels fell com
pletely off the cart. Cal was smoked
by Oregon two weeks ago and beat
en soundly by Arizona State (and
Bears' former coach Bruce Snyder)
last Saturday.
Lineman Mack Travis pretty
much summed up feelings in
Berkeley after the loss in Tempe.
"If you'd told me at the begin
ning of the season that we'd lose six
games, we would've had a fist
fight." Don't take off the gloves yet,
Mack, 'cause it's a good bet that six
is about to become seven.
Predictably, Gilbertson sees in
the Big Game a chance to redeem a

season full of disappointments. He
expects his team to be riding an
emotional high. "I can't imagine us
doing anything but going out there
and absolutely spilling our guts,"
Gilbertson says.
In fact, he says, "this is the kind
of game where, if you get your leg
ripped off, you tape it back on and
go play."
Actually, the Bears' embarrass
ments at the hands of mediocre
Purdue, Oregon and Arizona State
make you wonder just how many
one-legged players Gilbertson has
been suiting up.
But this is Big Game, the game

where it seems the underdog
should be the favorite and vice
versa.
I happen to remember the last
time a 4-6 team came into Memori
al Stadium to face a bowl-bound
Bay Area rival. . . Please, clear the
field. The game is not over . .. and
the "bowlers" left none too
pleased.
This is not the space for predic
tions, but don't be surprised if the
game doesn't find a way to resolve
itself until the waning moments.
That's just the way things wind up
when Big Game is played in Bez
erkeley.
I've heard some argue that the
only real Big Games are the ones
played in the East Bay, and there's
a basis for their claim. "The Play"
— that world-renowned meshing
of forward laterals, incompetent
referees and inebriated tuba play
ers — took place in Berkeley.
So did the '88 game, where
Tuan Van Lee blocked a late 19-
yard field goal to preserve a tie and

keep The Axe on the Farm. And, of
course, The Game the Cal Student
Section Lost was a Memorial Stadi
um thriller.
The point is, ready yourself for a
heart-tugging Saturday afternoon.
And, surely, one cannot be com
pletely prepared for the Big Game
without his official Big Game T
shirt.
Yes, I've seen those "Cal Sucks"
pieces of pornographic apparel.
Oski is performing deeds on that
Tree that would make Madonna
cringe.
So, for those who want a shirt
they can show Mom over the
break (or for those on sports
writer's salaries that make $12
way out of line), provided is a Big
Game T-shirt starter's kit. Feel
free to cut and paste to your
favorite crewneck.
The top 10 reasons Cal
shouldn't show up for the 95th



Kevin
Jeffery
Big Game:
10. One more loss, and Keith
Gilbertson is looking for work.
9. Jason Kidd can't play foot
ball. (Neither, for that matter,
can Dave Barr — but those in
Weenie-land have been slow to
notice).
8. Their naked guy catches
administrative flak between class
es. Our naked guy sticks to Sten
strom TD passes.
7. Kansas is not a first-rate
opponent. Notre Dame and USC
are.
6. Russell White's stock is drop
ping faster than the Nikkei.

5. Daily Cal columnists moti
vate the Bears better than coach
Gilbertson.
4. No Cal offensive lineman
would know a good block if it sat
on his face.
3. The ghost of Rosebud still
haunts them.
2. They should be out making
$$$ to cover (yet another) 40 per
cent fee hike/chancellor retire
ment bonus.
1. Revenge for "Revenge of The
Play" isn't due for another six
years.

Kevin Jeffery is usually a believer

This is not the space for predic

That's just the way things wind up

I've heard some argue that the
only real Big Games are the ones

a basis for their claim. "The Play"

So did the '88 game, where
Tuan Van Lee blocked a late 19-

The point is, ready yourself for a

And, surely, one cannot be com

Yes, I've seen those "Cal Sucks"

The top 10 reasons Cal
shouldn't show up for the 95th



Kevin
Jeffery
Big Game:
10. One more loss, and Keith
Gilbertson is looking for work.
9. Jason Kidd can't play foot
ball. (Neither, for that matter,
can Dave Barr — but those in
Weenie-land have been slow to
notice).
8. Their naked guy catches
administrative flak between class
es. Our naked guy sticks to Sten
strom TD passes.
7. Kansas is not a first-rate
opponent. Notre Dame and USC
are.
6. Russell White's stock is drop
ping faster than the Nikkei.

5. Daily Cal columnists moti
vate the Bears better than coach
Gilbertson.
4. No Cal offensive lineman
would know a good block if it sat
on his face.
3. The ghost of Rosebud still
haunts them.
2. They should be out making
$$$ to cover (yet another) 40 per
cent fee hike/chancellor retire
ment bonus.
1. Revenge for "Revenge of The
Play" isn't due for another six
years.

Kevin Jeffery is usually a believer
in journalistic impartiality. But
not this week. He is a junior and
his column appears here Tues
days.
an how me someone who
get up for Big
k-/Game," spoke linebacker
Ron George, "and I'll show you
someone that doesn't play football
for Stanford."
As he basked in the glory of a 40-
3 Cougar thrashing, the Cardinal's
postgame pontificator successfully
dispelled any notion that Stanford
will be looking ahead to a Jan. 1
bowl bid — and past the Cal Bears.
"Big Game blocks all vision. That's
honest."
And it's true; you've heard the
cliches. When Big Game time rolls
around, throw out the records and
forget about winning streaks. The
annual Stanford-Cal contest does
put the proverbial blinders on the
Bay Area sports world.
Those blinders do a fine job of
blocking out the postseason bowl
picture, but they can't keep us
from peering in on our cross-bay
cohorts. And as we glance across
the water, it's tough not to notice
that these are troubled times in the

Land of the Weenies.
After a glorious 10-2 1991 sea
son, the Bears have slipped to a
miserable 4-6 record under first
year head coach Keith Gilbertson.
Early in the year, Cal found a way
to lose against the conference's top
notch clubs. Turnovers plagued the
Weenies in narrow losses to USC
and Arizona.
But it was not until the last two
weeks that the wheels fell com
pletely off the cart. Cal was smoked
by Oregon two weeks ago and beat
en soundly by Arizona State (and
Bears' former coach Bruce Snyder)
last Saturday.
Lineman Mack Travis pretty
much summed up feelings in
Berkeley after the loss in Tempe.
"If you'd told me at the begin
ning of the season that we'd lose six
games, we would've had a fist
fight." Don't take off the gloves yet,
Mack, 'cause it's a good bet that six
is about to become seven.
Predictably, Gilbertson sees in
the Big Game a chance to redeem a

season full of disappointments. He
expects his team to be riding an
emotional high. "I can't imagine us
doing anything but going out there
and absolutely spilling our guts,"
Gilbertson says.
In fact, he says, "this is the kind
of game where, if you get your leg
ripped off, you tape it back on and
go play."
Actually, the Bears' embarrass
ments at the hands of mediocre
Purdue, Oregon and Arizona State
make you wonder just how many
one-legged players Gilbertson has
been suiting up.
But this is Big Game, the game

where it seems the underdog
should be the favorite and vice
versa.
