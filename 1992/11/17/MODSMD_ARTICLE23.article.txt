# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
This weekend was a rollercoaster ride for
Stanford athletics, as the football team
scored at will for a huge victory, the volley
ball team cruised to two more wins, while
both soccer teams ended their seasons after
being eliminated in NCAA tournament play.
The Athletes of the Week both led Stan
ford with their exciting performances over
the weekend, each on different ends of their
careers. Louise Watson captured the individ

ual championship title in the Regional eight
cross country meet on Saturday in her first
year on the Farm. Glyn Milburn, the peren
nial rushing menace of the Pacific 10 Con
ference, played his last home game in Stan
ford stadium, finishing up on an amazing
note during the 40-3 rout of the Cougars.
Milburn was named one of this week's
Pac-10 players of the week after scoring
three touchdowns against the hapless Wash
ington State squad. Rushing 12 times for 89
yards, with 153 all-purpose yards on the
game, Milburn bid farewell to his home
crowd in style.
After one of his most electrifying perfor
mances of the season, Milburn stands
ranked first in the Pac-10 and third in the
nation, in all-purpose running, with a 176.7
yard average per game. He has worked his
way up to the third slot in the Pac-10 career
all-purpose yard statistics.
With Big Game left to go, Milburn holds
the top spots in four different categories in
the Stanford record books: career punt
return yardage, season all-purpose running
(1990), season punt return yardage and sea
son punt return average.

Watson has made an immediate impact in
her first year on the Stanford cross country
team, culminating in her victory last week
end. She ran the Woodward Park course in
Fresno in an impressive 17 minutes, 20.37
seconds, earning her an individual bid to the

national championships to be held Nov. 23
in Indiana.
Watson has led the new and improved
squad all season after transferring in as a
junior from a British university. She took
second at the Pac-10 championships after
victories earlier in the season. Watson
returned to the top of the victory stand and
now looks to the national championships.
