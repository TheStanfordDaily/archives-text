# Cardinal warms up in Stanford regatta
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
With less than a week until a
much-anticipated showdown
with Washington at the New
port Beach Regatta, the Stan
ford men's and women's crew
teams took different approaches
toward preparation this week
end.
Women's coach Wendy Davis
warmed her team up at the
Stanford Fall Regatta on Sun
day while the men's team stayed
home to rest before the Newport
race.
As both a varsity and open
event, the Stanford Fall Regatta
included boats from Stanford,
California, Santa Clara and sev
eral clubs from the area. This
race was the first chance many
of the novices got to compete.
Along with their two varsity
boats, the women's team sent
three novice eights. These boats
were made up mostly of fresh
men and sophomores who had
never rowed competitively
before.
Due to an error while start
ing, Stanford's top varsity boat
lost at least 30 seconds off the

beginning of the race, dropping
them far behind the top Cal
boat.
Cal finished first and second
with times of 15 minutes, 43
seconds and 16:45 as Stanford's
two boats finished with times of
16:58 and 17:33. Santa Clara
brought up the rear of the varsi
ties with a time of 18:14.
"At the Sacramento race,
they (Cal) were using their bet
ter equipment and we weren't
and they beat us," Davis said. "I
want to see how much closer to
them we could get, but with our
starting problem we can't get an
accurate reading on what we
need to do to beat them."
This is only the second year
the race was held at the exciting
and curvy five kilometer course.
"It's a coxswain's nightmare,"
Davis said.
"It has some pretty good
hairpin turns. Luckily the
novice boats avoided any real
damage which could have come
about from their inexperience."
The top novice team came in
second behind Cal's top novice
boat with a time of 18:42 â€”
1:24 behind the Cal boat.
Because Stanford has a rela
tively small program compared
to Washington or Cal, every
practice will be taken seriously,
said Davis.
"Our philosophy is we attack
the workouts. We don't have the
workouts attack us," Davis said.
"Attitude will make or break us
this year. After the bad start,
the women were pretty mad, but
they pulled together to finish the
race."
The progress of the women's
team continues to please coach
Davis. There has been little
drop-off between last year and
this season from the returning
juniors.
"Their first tests this year
were as good or better than their
fastest last year," Davis said.

"We'll go with a medium
workout this week, but since we
are only on the water three days
a week compared to Cal's five,
we have to work that much
harder."
Davis also noted the excep
tional progress of senior Larissa
Cochron. "She was somebody
that was pretty easily intimidat
ed by a lot of the workouts last
year, but now she attacks them,"
Davis said. "That's been really
neat to see."
Men's coach Wieslaw Kujda
decided to rest his team before
the Newport Regatta. "We'll be
facing Washington, which is
probably the fastest boat in the
country," said Kujda.
"We want the extra practice
because we will leave for New
port Friday. With midterms this
week and next, we wouldn't have
been able to concentrate on prac
tice like we need to had we raced
this weekend."
