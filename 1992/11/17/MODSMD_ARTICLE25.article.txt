# Women linksters end fall golf season with problems on Hilton Head course
## 
### Andy Collins 
The women's golf team closed
its fall season this weekend, fin
ishing a disappointing ninth at
the Golf World/Palmetto Dunes
Collegiate tournament in Hilton
Head, SC.
Fifth-year senior Martha
Richards led the lackluster Stan
ford squad. Her three-round total
score of 236 strokes tied her for
28th place overall.

'We stunk. I was very
disappointed in our
performance.'

Following only a single stroke
behind Richards was junior
Melinda Daniels, who rebounded
from a first-round 83 to shoot
stronger second and third rounds
of 76 and 78, respectively. How
ever, she was unable to rise above
30th place.
Sophomore Jamille Jose shot
rounds of 81, 80 and 78, finish
ing in 33rd place. Freshman
Vicky Strada shot a first round
of 79, but was unable to main
tain the pace, finishing in a tie
for 44th place after second and
third rounds of 86 and 82,
respectively.
Sophomore Amy Lawrence
continued to experience difficulty
in intercollegiate competition this
year. She finished a dismal 54th
place after shooting a three
round total of 259.
Arizona State won the team
competition with a total of 896
strokes, three ahead of second
place Duke University. Three
Sun Devil golfers finished in the
top 10, as well as four Blue Devil
linksters.
Furman's Caroline Peek, a
sophomore, shot a tournament
record 217 to win the individual
title by two strokes.
Stanford head coach Tim Bald
win was not pleased with the per

formance of the Cardinal.
"We stunk," commented Bald
win bluntly. "I was very disap
pointed in our performance."
Baldwin tried to maintain a
sense of optimism, however, and
remarked that Richards, Daniels
and Jose all played "solid golf,
but something always went
wrong ... a few bogeys here and
there really hurt. The scores
were not truly indicative of how
they played."
Commenting on Strada's per
formance, Baldwin said that
"Vicky has continued to struggle,
but she will definitely get bet
ter."
Baldwin seemed at a loss to
explain the difficulty that
Lawrence has been experiencing.
"Amy somehow lost a lot of her
game over the summer , and has
had real trouble getting it back."
About the only facet of this
weekend's tournament for which
Baldwin could find praise was the
competition. "ASU played fabu
lous golf, and so did Duke and
Furman," he said.
The Cardinal golfers will be on
hiatus until next spring, when
the season resumes. The team
will return to practice Feb. 15,
and the spring season kicks off on
March 5 at the San Jose State
Intercollegiate at Monterey.
Until then, the golfers are on
their own for practice, since
NCAA regulations limit the num
ber of weeks of formal, coach
assisted workouts. Each player
will receive a personal review of
their performance in the fall sea
son to assist in their off-season
training.
Baldwin insisted that he was
"still optimistic" for the year.
"The team has a lot of improve
ment to do for next spring," he
said. "But we know what we have
to do to get back into the top
five."
"We have a very, very busy
spring schedule," said Baldwin.
Indeed, the Cardinal linksters
will be playing in seven tourna
ments this spring, culminating in
the NCAA Championships in
Athens, Ga.
