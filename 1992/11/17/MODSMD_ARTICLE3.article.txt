# ‘Woodside arsonist' unlikely culprit
## Fire department says suspect has no connection to fire in Foothills 
### Lindsey Marcus 
Palo Alto fire officials said yesterday they do not
believe the "Woodside arsonist" arrested Friday is re
sponsible for this summer's fire in the Stanford
Foothills.
"He had nothing to do with it according to him,
and we have no evidence that would suggest his in
vblvement," said Mark Moore, an inspector in the
Palo Alto Fire Department.
Moore refused to discuss the cause of the fire until
an official report is released. He said a statement
would likely be issued within the next two weeks.
The suspected firestarter, Patrick Gregory Foley,

30, of Redwood City, was charged yesterday with 42
counts of arson.
According to Sgt. Don O'Keefe of the San Mateo
Sheriffs Office, Foley has admitted to setting at least
42 fires in the Woodside and Portola Valley areas dur
ing two periods: June 23 to Aug. 5 and Oct. 9 to Nov.
13.
Six of the fires began on Alpine Road — which bor
ders the Foothills — between June 23 and Aug. 1,
O'Keefe said, but Foley denied any link to the fire in
the Stanford Foothills.
Foley is scheduled to return to court to enter his
plea next week. He is currently in
custody at the San Mateo County
Jail in lieu of $1 million bond.
Foley has no previous criminal
record, according to O'Keefe.
The fire that swept through the
Foothills July 10 consumed more
than 500 acres and forced the
evacuation of more than 200 resi
dences and University buildings.
The fire, which was controlled
within four hours, was the largest

in the Foothills since 1985. While
no injuries were reported and no
buildings were damaged in the
blaze, it reminded the campus how
vulnerable California's brushlands
are to fire after a six-year drought.
The week after the fire, several
firefighters said they thought
that fallen Pacific Gas and Elec
tric power lines started the fire,
and Palo Alto Fire Chief Robert
Wall said at the time he had ruled
out arson as the cause of the fire.
However, Moore would not
comment on the cause of the
Foothills Fire until the report is
released.
