# Stanford in Washington RFs make the move
## McBride and Milton's transition to nearby house smooth for students, faculty 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Bill Clinton isn't the only person getting a
new house in Washington.
Stanford in Washington resident fellows
Thomas Mcßride and Catherine Milton have
moved out of the building where the pro
gram's students live to a house about five
minutes away. But if having your RF move
out sounds like a problem — or a boon — stu
dents and faculty say things are pretty much
the same.
The reason for the move was twofold, said
Mcßride, who is a visiting lecturer at the
Haas Center for Public Service, which Milton
directs. First, he said, the apartment for visit
ing faculty was too small to house himself,
Milton and two teen-age sons, who needed
more room to breathe. The move will provide
the family with the needed space.
Also, the University wanted to renovate
the faculty apartment and lay new carpet. To
do the work, however, all the furniture need
ed to be moved out. This was easily accom
plished by moving the occupants out.

Mcßride, formerly director of Stanford's
Environmental Health and Safety Depart
ment, is teaching a course in Washington on
legal perspectives in biology and a tutorial on
"governmental gridlock." Milton has been in
Washington since last October, serving as
executive director of the Commission on
National and Community Service.
Mcßride said the move from the 32-stu
dent house has gone fairly smoothly.
According to program Resident Assistant
Quan Phung, the move at first seemed
"strange," because of the traditional picture
of the Stanford RF as dorm resident. Howev
er, Phung said the different role of the Stan
ford in Washington RF and the large amount
of time Mcßride still spends in the dorm have
not changed the program in any significant
way.
"The role [of RFJ is really loosely defined
here," Phung said. Contrary to the tradition
al Stanford RF, the Washington program's
RF is less involved in the social activities of
the house. Many of the social functions are
planned by the program administrator, not
the RF, Phung said.

Mcßride said his office is still located in the
program's house, so he is there much of the
day. In addition, he eats dinner with the stu
dents every night. Phung said Mcßride usual
ly stays until about 8 p.m..
"It's not a big change at all," Stanford in
Washington student Matthew Scelza said
about the move. "He's here every day."
Scelza also pointed out that the program,
partly due to its location in a big city, has
fewer planned activities that would be the
domain of a Stanford RF.
"Res Ed is de-emphasized more than on
the Stanford campus," he said.
Mcßride said the renovations on the apart
ment were moving along quickly and should
be finished by next quarter. At that point, for
mer University President Donald Kennedy
will take up residence in the apartment.
Kennedy will be the resident faculty mem
ber for the program winter quarter, which
will focus on environmental issues. This is the
first year Stanford in Washington has been
held winter quarter. Mcßride said he planned
to stay in Washington and write a book after
Kennedy takes over the faculty post.
