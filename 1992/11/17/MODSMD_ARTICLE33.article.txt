### Theodore Quinn 
Mostly Harmless
by Douglas Adams (Harmony
Books, S20.00)
When Douglas Adams left be
hind his popular and lucrative
"Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy" series in the mid-'Bos,
many of his loyal readers won
dered why he abandoned the wild
ly funny stories that had propelled
him to the top of best-seller lists
worldwide.
After reading "Mostly Harm
less," whose jacket proclaims it to
be the "fifth book in the increas
ingly inaccurately named Hitch
hikers Trilogy," many of these fans
may wonder why he chose to
come back.
The new book marks a return to
the old days, when the series was
still an actual trilogy and the hapless
protagonist, Earthling Arthur
Dent, wandered about the galaxy
with his less-than-constant com
panion, the impulsive Ford Prefect.
Adams left this formula behind
in the fourth Hitchhiker install
ment, "So Long, and Thanks For
All the Fish," which eschewed the
frenetic pace and science fiction
settings of the early books for a
more thoughtful style, set on
Earth. After that, he left the
Hitchhiker series behind entirely.
"I was beginning to feel really
trapped by this thing that I'd creat
ed," Adams said in a telephone in
terview. "I was worried I was going
to become a one-trick pony and I re
ally wanted to go and do other
things, so I had to say no to anything
having to do with Hitchhiker's."
Adams went on to new heights
of narrative complexity with his
two Dirk Gently detective novels.
Then in 1990 he entered the realm
of non-fiction with "Last Chance
to See," a chronicle of his global
travels to observe endangered
wildlife.

Now, eight years older and no
longer in any danger of being a
"one-trick pony," Adams makes a
valiant attempt to bring all of the
narrative complexity, psychologi
cal texture and stark verisimilitude
of his recent work back to the sci
ence fiction universe of his first
three books.
But without the ebullient
comic intensity of his early career,

Adams finds the galaxy rather cold
and unforgiving despite his literary
skill. Adams said he sensed this dif
ficulty before he ever started the
new novel.
"There were bits for me when I
went back and read the early
Hitchhiker books where I
thought, 'Fuck, how the hell did
whoever wrote this manage to
write that bit?' "
The book also smolders with a
sense of grim pessimism that occa
sionally flares up into graphic vio
lence, totally clashing with the
comic mood Adams attempts to
sustain.
When Dent finds himself on a
planet populated by furry crea
tures called boghogs, who can
only communicate by biting,
Adams describes in grisly detail the
brutal beating one of these crea

tures receives in reply.
Such scenes, which are com
pletely atypical of Adams breezy,
lighthearted style, leave the reader
feeling uncomfortable and uncer
tain when to stop laughing.
Adams said that, in retrospect,
he believes such scenes were invol
untary expressions of his mood
while he was writing the book,
during which time he endured a
heartrending death in his immedi
ate family. He also attributes some
of this mood to emotions that
built up during his work on "Last
Chance to See" — emotions that
he tried to suppress in order to
make the book more upbeat and
accessible.
"There was a residual anger and
frustration that came from that
and found its way into ['Mostly
Harmless']," which was supposed
to be an entertaining book, he
said.
Adams said he wanted "Mostly
Harmless" to be more character
driven than the first three books in
the series. Unfortunately, he cov
ered this ground much better in
"So Long, and Thanks For All the
Fish" by painting Dent's life in
broad, but convincing strokes.
Whether it's Dent force-feed
ing himself bagpipe music in order
to suppress his scattcrbrain,
lovesick ecstasy or haplessly navi
gating the moral desert of Los An
geles with charming British polite
ness, his character came through
with imaginative clarity in "So
Long."
By contrast, "Mostly Harm
less" seems stretched too thin to
support such character develop
ment; Adams tries to follow three
separate story lines around the
galaxy, joining them together only
at the end of the book.
The abrupt and nihilistic end
ing that comprises these final
pages leaves the reader with the
feeling Adams was desperate for a
way to tic up the dangling ends of

his badly frayed plot structure.
Adams admitted that he only
dccided on the ending of the book
a few days before he actually wrote
it. Moreover, he said problems of
plot and structure have plagued
him throughout his career, citing
the influences of his sketch-writ
ing origins at British Broadcasting
Corporation.
"I accidentally sort of hacked
into writing novels. ... In a sense,
I've had to learn the trade very
much in public," he said. "It's like
learning to be a tightrope walker
in public."

Adams has conqucrcd this
arena in previous books, but he
can't seem to transfer that ability
back to the stomping grounds of
his literary youth.
Despite the disappointment
that "Mostly Harmless" will un
doubtedly bring to many of its
readers, glimmers of Adams' irre
pressible wit still shine throughout
the novel, and several scenes are,
as usual, laugh-out-loud funny.
For now, though, his vast fol
lowing would be well-advised to
reread his earlier books and wait
for the next one. ■

ate family. He also attributes some
of this mood to emotions that
built up during his work on "Last
Chance to See" — emotions that
he tried to suppress in order to
make the book more upbeat and
accessible.
"There was a residual anger and
frustration that came from that
and found its way into ['Mostly
Harmless']," which was supposed
to be an entertaining book, he
said.
Adams said he wanted "Mostly
Harmless" to be more character
driven than the first three books in
the series. Unfortunately, he cov
ered this ground much better in
"So Long, and Thanks For All the
Fish" by painting Dent's life in
broad, but convincing strokes.
Whether it's Dent force-feed
ing himself bagpipe music in order
to suppress his scattcrbrain,
lovesick ecstasy or haplessly navi
gating the moral desert of Los An
geles with charming British polite
ness, his character came through
with imaginative clarity in "So
Long."
By contrast, "Mostly Harm
less" seems stretched too thin to
support such character develop
ment; Adams tries to follow three
separate story lines around the
galaxy, joining them together only
at the end of the book.
The abrupt and nihilistic end
ing that comprises these final
pages leaves the reader with the
feeling Adams was desperate for a
way to tic up the dangling ends of

his badly frayed plot structure.
Adams admitted that he only
dccided on the ending of the book
a few days before he actually wrote
it. Moreover, he said problems of
plot and structure have plagued
him throughout his career, citing
the influences of his sketch-writ
ing origins at British Broadcasting
Corporation.
"I accidentally sort of hacked
into writing novels. ... In a sense,
I've had to learn the trade very
much in public," he said. "It's like
learning to be a tightrope walker
in public."

Adams has conqucrcd this
arena in previous books, but he
can't seem to transfer that ability
back to the stomping grounds of
his literary youth.
Despite the disappointment
that "Mostly Harmless" will un
doubtedly bring to many of its
readers, glimmers of Adams' irre
pressible wit still shine throughout
the novel, and several scenes are,
as usual, laugh-out-loud funny.
For now, though, his vast fol
lowing would be well-advised to
reread his earlier books and wait
for the next one. ■

Mostly Harmless
by Douglas Adams (Harmony
Books, S20.00)
When Douglas Adams left be
hind his popular and lucrative
"Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy" series in the mid-'Bos,
many of his loyal readers won
dered why he abandoned the wild
ly funny stories that had propelled
him to the top of best-seller lists
worldwide.
After reading "Mostly Harm
less," whose jacket proclaims it to
be the "fifth book in the increas
ingly inaccurately named Hitch
hikers Trilogy," many of these fans
may wonder why he chose to
come back.
The new book marks a return to
the old days, when the series was
still an actual trilogy and the hapless
protagonist, Earthling Arthur
Dent, wandered about the galaxy
with his less-than-constant com
panion, the impulsive Ford Prefect.
Adams left this formula behind
in the fourth Hitchhiker install
ment, "So Long, and Thanks For
All the Fish," which eschewed the
frenetic pace and science fiction
settings of the early books for a
more thoughtful style, set on
Earth. After that, he left the
Hitchhiker series behind entirely.
"I was beginning to feel really
trapped by this thing that I'd creat
ed," Adams said in a telephone in
terview. "I was worried I was going
to become a one-trick pony and I re
ally wanted to go and do other
things, so I had to say no to anything
having to do with Hitchhiker's."
Adams went on to new heights
of narrative complexity with his
two Dirk Gently detective novels.
Then in 1990 he entered the realm
of non-fiction with "Last Chance
to See," a chronicle of his global
travels to observe endangered
wildlife.

Now, eight years older and no
longer in any danger of being a
"one-trick pony," Adams makes a
valiant attempt to bring all of the
narrative complexity, psychologi
cal texture and stark verisimilitude
of his recent work back to the sci
ence fiction universe of his first
three books.
But without the ebullient
comic intensity of his early career,

Adams finds the galaxy rather cold
and unforgiving despite his literary
skill. Adams said he sensed this dif
ficulty before he ever started the
new novel.
"There were bits for me when I
went back and read the early
Hitchhiker books where I
thought, 'Fuck, how the hell did
whoever wrote this manage to
write that bit?' "
The book also smolders with a
sense of grim pessimism that occa
sionally flares up into graphic vio
lence, totally clashing with the
comic mood Adams attempts to
sustain.
When Dent finds himself on a
planet populated by furry crea
tures called boghogs, who can
only communicate by biting,
Adams describes in grisly detail the
brutal beating one of these crea

tures receives in reply.
Such scenes, which are com
pletely atypical of Adams breezy,
lighthearted style, leave the reader
feeling uncomfortable and uncer
tain when to stop laughing.
Adams said that, in retrospect,
he believes such scenes were invol
untary expressions of his mood
while he was writing the book,
during which time he endured a
heartrending death in his immedi
ate family. He also attributes some
of this mood to emotions that
built up during his work on "Last
