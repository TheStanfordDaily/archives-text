The Power of One
by Bryce Courtenay (Ballantine Books,
55.99 paperback)
In racially segregated South Africa, divi
sion and tribal identity can often smother
the individual.
Yet in his debut novel, "The Power of
One," Bryce Courtenay explores the influ
ence a young white boy has on pockets of
the South African countryside.
By teaching people to read, writing let
ters and fighting in a series of boxing match
es, the lonely, prodigal and always lovable
Pcckay dedicates his life to celebrating the
impact one man can have in such a divided
society.
The novel follows the life ofPeekay from
infancy to young adulthood — a life marked
by pain, struggle and a wide array of unique,
multi-dimensional characters.
The story blends heartrending episodes
with universal social struggles, from the
Rooineks South African elementary school

mates' cruel mistreatment ofPeekay because
he is English South African to his exposure
to the brutal inequalities of apartheid
through writing letters for black prisoners.
The early and traumatic experiences of
Peekay's grade school hazing mark him for
life, as he becomes determined to dedicate
his life to overcoming South African racial
rifts of all kinds — between Roonikers and
English South Africans, whites and blacks,
Jews and Christians and so on.
Given his noble mission, it may be sur
prising that much of the story centers on
Peekay's boxing career and his aspirations
to overcome the pain and degradation he
has faced by becoming "the welterweight
champion of the world."
While the novel packs quite a few Rocky
esque punches with detailed, ultra-technical
boxing scenes and the trials and tribulations of
training and competing, it transcends the pure
testosterone-pumping aspect of the sport.
In typical David and Goliath accounts,
Pcckay, eternally smaller than his peers, de
livers satisfying blows and pummels over
confident bully-types twice his size.
Rut more importantly, boxing is the only

sport in World War 11-cra South Africa in
which black .and white people compete
equally.
It is the common ground on which two
groups whose members normally do not
even speak to each other on the street come
together — and at least temporarily, the
question of superiority is determined by
merit, not color.
Through his boxing and his work at the
prison, Peekay becomes familiar with the
South African black community and works
to improve their situation. He literally
reaches godlike status among the black
South Africans as he becomes a friend and
savior to the community.
South African Courtenay struck it big
when "The Power of One," his debut novel,
was written into a screenplay and had its
stint in movie theaters last spring.
Yet, like the novel, the movie version of
"The Power of One" never reached epic
proportions; both remain in a state of quasi
obscurity — the Limbo of the entertain
ment industry.
While critics of the movie proclaimed it
"condescending" because the story portrays

a white boy "saving the black masses from
the scourge of ignorance," one has to keep
the context in mind.
Courtenay is portraying a white society
that is so divided against itself that the only
way it can assert itself is by completely op
pressing a third parry, the black South
Africans. Without money, social standing or
literacy, the black people arc largely power
less until they arc given a means by which
they can help themselves.
Peekay's work centers on developing a
system by which the black people can teach
each other to read. By this Peekay becomes
a member of the community and earns gen
uine respect, rather than assuming the role
of an inherently superior figure on whom
the community is dependent.
In a time when "change" has become the
catchword for American politics, and peo
ple seek a savior to mend seemingly un
bridgeable racial rifts, "The Power of One"
carries a valid message. And in a way that
may even transcend its social significance,
"The Power of One" is a satisfying, en
grossing read that leaves the reader with
plenty to think about ■
