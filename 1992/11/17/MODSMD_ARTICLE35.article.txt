The Tale of the Body Thief
by Ann Ricc (Knopf, $24.00)
Part Satanic Bible, part travel
ogue, Anne Rice's long-awaited
fourth novel in the Vampire
Chronicles recounts the latest, and
hopefully final, adventures of the
Vampire Lestat.
In"The Talc of the Body
Thief," Rice eschews occultism
and Gothic ambience for a good
old-fashioned treasure hunt, and
Lestat spends most of his time en
gaged in supernatural globe-trot
ting — if it's sundown, this must
be Barbados.
The story opens in the ghostly
environs of . . . Miami, where a
guilt-ridden Lestat stalks serial
killers, ailing retirees and other
eminently disposable types.
In between cosmic sojourns,
our hero waxes nostalgic and be
moans his depraved existence.
"The evil of one murder is infi
nite," he wails. "And my guilt is
like my beauty — eternal."
But the arrival of a strange
package and a series of dizzy fits
soon interrupts the vampire's noc
turnal grind, provoking Lestat to
question his all-supremacy and
start speaking in exclamation
points.
W I was dumbfounded! No one
knew I was here! Oh, there were
credit card numbers involved, but
dear God, it would have taken

hours for any mortal to locate me
that way, even if such a thing were
possible, which it really was not."
Enter the title character, who,
contrary to expectations, is not a
vampire but a master psychic, thief
of bodies and just about every
thing else. Raglan James by name,
this nefarious character makes Le
stat an offer he simply can't refuse;
the chance to be mortal for a day.
I-estat spends about 10 seconds
dwelling on the moral implica
tions of James' offer. Tempted by
such cunning rhetoric as "You'll
never know what it's like to walk in
the sunlight, to enjoy a full meal of
real food, to make love to a
woman or a man," he accepts,
against the advice of colleagues
worldly and otherwise.
In the course of just a few short
hours, Lestat manages to experi
ence such mortal perks as urina
tion, premature ejaculation,
drunkenness and safe sex. He
catches a nasty cold, befriends a
dog, watches a sunrise and burns
his tongue.
But when the bargain goes bad,
Lestat realizes that he should have
been less concerned about what
his little friends would think and
more suspicious of the Body
Thief, now at large in Lcstat's
splendiferous vampire body.
Jusdy abandoned by his fellow
vampires, Lestat must rely on his
friend and mentor David Talbot
to help him regain his body and
power, a plot reminiscent of
"Rockv III."

The path back to immortality is
littered with awkward, self-con
gratulatory references to Rice's
previous books and characters,
such as "my intrepid little Claudia,
companion hunter and slayer of
random victims — vampire par ex
cellence."
"Body Thief" features all of
Rice's usual suspects plus a few
new ones, each more preposter
ously contrived than the last.
L-ouis and Lestat bicker like an old

married couplc, Claudia and
Gabriellc haunt Lcstat's dreams
like so much half-digested garlic
and even Marius makes an entirely
gratuitous cameo appearance.
Although Rice captures the
horrors of mortality with depress
ing accuracy, the total effect is
reminiscent of a bad episode of
"Tales From the Crypt," complete
with a wholly predictable "sur
prise" ending.
While all this body switching is

fresh territory for Rice and makes
for some wacky mistaken identity
hijinks, one wonders if the author
has drained the whole vampire
concept dry, so to speak.
Typically, Lestat's adventures
in body switching are more con
vincing than his mortal romance
with a friendly nun. But his self
conscious narration has no place in
the spirit world, and the search for
his stolen body — like a bad
"Where's Waldo?" — is engaging,
but entirely too easy.
In yet another instance of form
slaying function, a spectacular
vampire suicide attempt comes in
Chapter Three, when readers
haven't had time to know or care
about the victim.
Indeed, Rice's greatest conceit
is the assumption that those who
aren't loyal fans could follow the
novel's flashback-laden plot. Fortu
nately, Rice has plenty of loyal fans
— a fact brought out in her fiction
by Lestat's unwilling celebrity.
"I should never feed upon
these tender, innocent ones," he
groans. "Even when they bare
their throats at me and say, 'Lc
stat, right here!' This has hap
pened, reader, in Jackson Square,
and more than once."
Like her protagonist, Rice needs
to stop preying on her faithful fol
lowing. A wholly unnecessary sec
ond ending seems tagged onto
"Body Thief," as if to guarantee yet
another installment in the Vampire
Chronicles. But it's about time
Rice let the dead rest in peace. ■
