Possessing the Secret of Joy
by Alice Walker
(Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, $19.95)
A graceful tome that blurs the lines be
tween fiction, anthropology, psychology
and social commentary, "Possessing the Se
cret of Joy" charts the spiritual and psycho
logical development of Tashi, an African
woman tortured to the point of madness
over her decision as an adolescent to under
go a traditional, tribal clitcrectomy.
Tashi, a peripheral character from"The
Color Purple" brought back in Alice Walk
er's recent novel, is motivated by a misled
sense of loyalty to her native culture to undcr
gocs the grisly procedure of genital mutila
tion, or "female circumcision," in which part
or all of a woman's external sexual organs —
all, in Tashi's ease — arc removed, usually with
less-than-sharp instruments in a less-than-ster
ile environment. But instead of bringing her
closer to her people, the agonizing procedure
and its painful aftermath — which forever pre
vents her from enjoying sex — alienates Tashi
from both her culture and herself.
After marrying the son of a black English
missionary to her childhood village, she
spends decades undergoing various forms
of psychotherapy, seeking the root of her
emotional numbness and her merciless,
haunting nightmares on the couches ofvar
ious Freud and Jung disciples — and even
Jung himself — before tracing her angst
back to the straw hut in which she was cir
cumcised.

Though her literary artwork is precise
and careful, Walker also paints in broader
brush strokes, commenting on the com
plexities of interpersonal relationships, the
repression of women's sexuality and the
long road to emotional recovery from trau
matic childhood experiences.
Walker wrote "Joy" entirely in the first per
son, but the narrator changes with each chap
ter, allowing her to develop multilayered, al
most-painfully realistic characters. In the
course of the book we gain so many perspec
tives on each narrator, and particularly Tashi
herself, that the descriptions jar as well as jell.
Indeed, at times the sequential chapters
read like the books of the Gospel: the simi
larities between the narrators' descriptions
are great enough that the reader knows
they're describing the same person; yet the
differences arc so marked, they're left to
wonder whether everyone's memory could
possible be accurate.
This disparity of recollections is one of
the smaller triumphs in Walker's novel: a
painstaking detail that brings the narrative
another step closer to the human experi
ence. Since everyone has different perspec
tives and priorities, memories arc necessari
ly selective, a human limitation the charac
ters themselves recognize. And by describ
ing events through the eyes of more than
one character, Walker subtly highlights the
personality of each.
And now when Olivia says, But don 't you
remember, Adam, Tashi was weeping when
we met her! I am at a loss. For that is not the
little girl I remember. The Tashi I remember
was always laughing, and making up stories,
or flitting cheerfully about the place on er

rands for her mother.
Sometimes I think Olivia and I remember
two entirely different people, and now, because
Tashi and I have lived together for so many
years, I think my recollection of her as a child is
sure to be the correct one. But what if it is not?
Walker's work is also a stunning observa
tion on the complexities and seeming con
tradictions that characterize real-life rela
tionships. Instead of falling prey to the
cliches and romantic notions that dominate
so many novels, in which true love is black
and-white and everlasting, Walker focuses
instead on its subtleties and hardships.
Adam, Tashi's husband, exhibits undying
love for his wife despite her mental illness.
But while he remains loyal to her, he also
maintains a long-term extramarital relation
ship with Lisettc, a white Parisian whom he
later impregnates and who decides, against
his will, to carry the pregnancy to term.
It was summer, and we sat on chaises longues
under the linden trees in the graden behind
Lisette's house... It is so hot, I said, to be knitting
wool. Unless, I added, smiling at her, you are ex
pecting to have very cold feet this winter.
Very cold petitsfeet, she said, without look
ing up.
And that is how I learned of petit Pierre.
I had always been careful with Lisette. ...
Ours was a friendship of shared sadness as well
as passion, but a friendship first of all, and I
spent many nights in her fluffy white bed,
holding her in my arms, but so distraught
about my own life with [Tashi], all I could
yearn for was sleep.
On the other hand, there had been an oc
casional weak moment, which is, after all, all
one needs.

"Joy" is as brave in its assertions and con
demnations as it is insightful in its commen
tary. The past decade has brought great ad
vancements in intercultural understanding
and has cast doubt on Westerners' well-inten
tioned but often misguided urge to "help" or
"save" the indigenous peoples whose cultures
they denounce as "primitive."
And as this missionary outlook becomes less
acceptable, so has criticism of indigenous ritu
als. But this doesn't prevent Walker from speak -
ing out against a practice she feels is unjust.
Despite the fact that genital mutiliation
has been going on for centuries in tradition
al African cultures — between 90 and 100
million women and girls living today in
Africa, Asia and the Middle East have un
dergone "female circumcision," according
to Walker — Walker tears apart the founda
tion for its perpetuation, exposing the real
motivation behind the ritual: to control and
subjugate women's sexuality.
It was only after I came to A merica, I said,
that I even knew what was supposed to be
down there.
Down there?
Tes. My own body was a mystery to me, as
was the female body, beyond the function of
breasts, to almost everyone I knew. ... Our
Leader said we must keep ourselves clean and
pure . . . by cutting out unclean parts of our
bodies. Everyone knew that if a woman was
not circumcised her unclean parts would
grow so long they'd soon touch her thighs; she'd
become masculine and arouse herself. No
man could enter her because her own erection
would be in his way.

logical development of Tashi, an African
woman tortured to the point of madness
over her decision as an adolescent to under
go a traditional, tribal clitcrectomy.
Tashi, a peripheral character from"The
Color Purple" brought back in Alice Walk
er's recent novel, is motivated by a misled
sense of loyalty to her native culture to undcr
gocs the grisly procedure of genital mutila
tion, or "female circumcision," in which part
or all of a woman's external sexual organs —
all, in Tashi's ease — arc removed, usually with
less-than-sharp instruments in a less-than-ster
ile environment. But instead of bringing her
closer to her people, the agonizing procedure
and its painful aftermath — which forever pre
vents her from enjoying sex — alienates Tashi
from both her culture and herself.
After marrying the son of a black English
missionary to her childhood village, she
spends decades undergoing various forms
of psychotherapy, seeking the root of her
emotional numbness and her merciless,
haunting nightmares on the couches ofvar
ious Freud and Jung disciples — and even
Jung himself — before tracing her angst
back to the straw hut in which she was cir
cumcised.

Though her literary artwork is precise
and careful, Walker also paints in broader
brush strokes, commenting on the com
plexities of interpersonal relationships, the
repression of women's sexuality and the
long road to emotional recovery from trau
matic childhood experiences.
Walker wrote "Joy" entirely in the first per
son, but the narrator changes with each chap
ter, allowing her to develop multilayered, al
most-painfully realistic characters. In the
course of the book we gain so many perspec
tives on each narrator, and particularly Tashi
herself, that the descriptions jar as well as jell.
Indeed, at times the sequential chapters
read like the books of the Gospel: the simi
larities between the narrators' descriptions
are great enough that the reader knows
they're describing the same person; yet the
differences arc so marked, they're left to
wonder whether everyone's memory could
possible be accurate.
This disparity of recollections is one of
the smaller triumphs in Walker's novel: a
painstaking detail that brings the narrative
another step closer to the human experi
ence. Since everyone has different perspec
tives and priorities, memories arc necessari
ly selective, a human limitation the charac
ters themselves recognize. And by describ
ing events through the eyes of more than
one character, Walker subtly highlights the
personality of each.
And now when Olivia says, But don 't you
remember, Adam, Tashi was weeping when
we met her! I am at a loss. For that is not the
little girl I remember. The Tashi I remember
was always laughing, and making up stories,
or flitting cheerfully about the place on er

rands for her mother.
Sometimes I think Olivia and I remember
two entirely different people, and now, because
Tashi and I have lived together for so many
years, I think my recollection of her as a child is
sure to be the correct one. But what if it is not?
Walker's work is also a stunning observa
tion on the complexities and seeming con
tradictions that characterize real-life rela
tionships. Instead of falling prey to the
cliches and romantic notions that dominate
so many novels, in which true love is black
and-white and everlasting, Walker focuses
instead on its subtleties and hardships.
Adam, Tashi's husband, exhibits undying
love for his wife despite her mental illness.
But while he remains loyal to her, he also
maintains a long-term extramarital relation
ship with Lisettc, a white Parisian whom he
later impregnates and who decides, against
his will, to carry the pregnancy to term.
It was summer, and we sat on chaises longues
under the linden trees in the graden behind
Lisette's house... It is so hot, I said, to be knitting
wool. Unless, I added, smiling at her, you are ex
pecting to have very cold feet this winter.
Very cold petitsfeet, she said, without look
ing up.
And that is how I learned of petit Pierre.
I had always been careful with Lisette. ...
Ours was a friendship of shared sadness as well
as passion, but a friendship first of all, and I
spent many nights in her fluffy white bed,
holding her in my arms, but so distraught
about my own life with [Tashi], all I could
yearn for was sleep.
On the other hand, there had been an oc
casional weak moment, which is, after all, all
one needs.

"Joy" is as brave in its assertions and con
demnations as it is insightful in its commen
tary. The past decade has brought great ad
vancements in intercultural understanding
and has cast doubt on Westerners' well-inten
tioned but often misguided urge to "help" or
"save" the indigenous peoples whose cultures
they denounce as "primitive."
And as this missionary outlook becomes less
acceptable, so has criticism of indigenous ritu
als. But this doesn't prevent Walker from speak -
ing out against a practice she feels is unjust.
Despite the fact that genital mutiliation
has been going on for centuries in tradition
al African cultures — between 90 and 100
million women and girls living today in
Africa, Asia and the Middle East have un
dergone "female circumcision," according
to Walker — Walker tears apart the founda
tion for its perpetuation, exposing the real
motivation behind the ritual: to control and
subjugate women's sexuality.
It was only after I came to A merica, I said,
that I even knew what was supposed to be
down there.
Down there?
Tes. My own body was a mystery to me, as
was the female body, beyond the function of
breasts, to almost everyone I knew. ... Our
Leader said we must keep ourselves clean and
pure . . . by cutting out unclean parts of our
bodies. Everyone knew that if a woman was
not circumcised her unclean parts would
grow so long they'd soon touch her thighs; she'd
become masculine and arouse herself. No
man could enter her because her own erection
would be in his way.
