# Megalomania to the max:
## Mark Leyner as main character, mega-star and all around demi-god 
### Theodore Quinn 
My advice to the young people of today?
I'm tempted to say: Surround yourself with
flunkies and yes-men and have naked
slaves, perfumed with musk, fan you with
plastic fronds as you write. Because that's
what's worked for me.
This passage typifies the kind of
hyperbole that oozes from
ever)' page of Mark Leyner's
megalomaniacal fantasy, "Et
Tu, Babe."
The narcissistic novel
tracks the ascension of the main character
— Leyner's namesake — to a semi-divine
position as the head of a sprawling multi
national conglomerate founded entirely on
the success of his writing.
In reality, tilings may not have escalated
this far, but as "Et Tu, Babe" attracts more
and more attention both from critics and the
public at large, life is beginning to imitate art
for this 36-year-old New Jersey native.
Leyner made the cover of The New York
l imes Magazine in September, and Esquire
wants to run a photo essay of a day in his
life, complete with photos of him running
with his dog, Carmella, and text by, you
guessed it, Leyner.
Even in person, the soft-spoken Leyner
seems more a phenomenon than a person.
Dressed in blue jeans, a rough cotton shirt
and snake-skin boots, his thinning brown
hair slicked back, Leyner is bedecked with
human skulls: a silver one hangs from a
chain around his neck, and tiny ivorv ones
are strung around his wrist.
As he takes a drag from his cigarette, his
wide eyed intensity exudes an invisible but
nearly palpable form of radiation that
bounces off the walls of the dim hotel room
as he muses on his recent success.
"I don't think I'm even aware of what's

'I wanted
the reader
to feel
like you
were joy
riding
with
some
kind of
lunatic.
but a
with a
sense of
direction.'

going on right
now because
I'm in the mid
dle of it, espe
cially being on a
tour like this. I
think in a cou
ple of months I
will clear my
living room and
put all the stuff
out on the floor
and get a bottle
of scotch and
look at it for a
day and say
'Look — can
you believe that
from the insane
books you write
this has hap
pened?' "
Fort he
books he's refer
ring to, "insane"
may be an un
derstatement.
Kevner entered
the mass market
in 1990 when
Harm on y
Books published
"My Cousin,
My Gastroen
terologist," his
eclectic collec
tion of jarringlv

hallucinatory stories and razor-edged prose
poetry that combine the rather incongruous
vocabularies of biotechnology, mass market
ing, micro circuitry, anthropology and fatuous
American television into mature literary sensi
bility.
Add Leyner's New Jersey street smarts
and dangerous concentrations of anabolic
steroids and you have a highly reactive com
pound indeed.
The absurd incongruities resonate with
the deafening chaos of modern life in an al
most painfully illuminating way; we laugh
in spite of ourselves. This quality of surreal
juxtaposition has everything to do with
Leyner's writing process, and to explain it,
Leyner borrows a French word from
Claude Levi Strauss' "The Naked Mind":
bricollajic.
"[Strauss] used it to describe the way
certain tribal people w ill use everything and
anything they have on hand to make the
utensils of their life. They use everything
from an animal: some of the animal they eat;
they use the rest of it to clothe themselves;
the bones they use to make tools. It's an en
ergetic making use of what's around.
"That's a perfect description of the way 1
work. I use everything I have lying around in
a piece, no matter how anomalous it may be."
Leyner uses this process even in the rare
instance when he sets out to accomplish a
particular writing task. For example, when
lie interviewed Keith Richards — one of his
idols — for Spin magazine, he threw all
sorts of literary fragments into the piece and
attempted to integrate them. Leyner laughs
at the results: "I have things in this Keith
Richards piece that are so far from having
anything to do with Keith Richards."
The linguistic synergies generated by
bringing together such wildly disparate situa
tions are perhaps the cornerstone of Leyner's
style, lending the work both its hyperkinetic
humor and its significance. He explains:
"I will take the language of intimacy and
put it into the mouth of an ad, for instance,
on television; or inversely take a very public
kind of discourse, the language of corporate
marketing, and put that in the mouth of a
dental hygienist who's cooing to someone
in an office.
"When we take language out of its every -
day context to which we become inured
somehow and put it in a very fresh and dif
ferent context it enables us to see it for the
first time. I think that's one of the things
that makes my books, hopefully, so funny
and also of more serious value to people."
As one examines this unconven
tional writer's relationship to
his unconventional work, a
hazy sort of paradox — one of
controlled chaos — emerges.
On the one hand, Leyner
seems to forge an organic connection be
tween his mind and the page — like a tribal
shaman channeling for a greater conscious
ness.
He eschews any kind of control, refusing
to impose upon himself any restrictions of
theme or structure that might dampen his
creative freedom. Therefore, he never starts
writing with an idea in mind, preferring in
stead to let the process of writing itself gen
crate the ideas.
On the other hand, this former ad writer
is capable ofextreme pragmatism, rewriting
individual sentences ad nauseam and en

thusiastically taking assignments such as the
Keith Richards interview and the Esquire
photo essay.
"I take it as a challenge and a paycheck,"
quips I.cyner. He compares such assign
ments to a period in his ad-writing days
when he'd order exactly whatever the per
son in front of him ordered in the compa
ny cafeteria — a Thoreau-like attempt to
wrest himself from the stifling grasp of his
daily habits.
How does one reconcile these two por
traits of a man and his life's work? C 'loser ex
animation reveals that the crux of the para
dox rests on the premise that there exists a
Mark Leyner separate from his writing
with an agenda and the literary tools to
achieve it.
With Leyner, this simply isn't true. He's
neither a sociologist writing fiction to illumi
nate his theories nor a historian writing fiction

t( > portray an era. He is simply a tic
tion writer, and his writing

process seems to defy
the laws of thermo-

dynamics, con

Th is
fusion of vo

cation and
identitv has never

been more evident
than in "Et Tu, Babe." Al

though similar to "My Cousin, My
Gastroenterologist" in its surreal texture
and manic energy, "Kt Tu, Babe" has some
of the large-scale coherence that "My
Cousin" entirely lacks.
I his shift resulted from a conscious deci
sion by Ixyner to provide "Kt Tu, Babe"
with a minimal narrative skeleton without
cramping his style. "1 wanted the reader to
feel like you were joy riding with some kind
of lunatic, but a lunatic with a sense of di
rection," he says.
The narrative framework Ixyner has
chosen, in some twisted, hyperbolic sense,
is himself.
"Kt lu. Babe" recounts in a blaring first
person the meteoric nse and nihilistic fall of
his persona, also named Mark Keyner, a nar
cissistic ultra macho steroid-inflated Über
mensch who commands the attention of the
entire world from his perch atop the com

mand structure of Team Ixryncr, an interna
tional cult/corporation that apparently has
sprung from the explosive success of his writ
ing.
Leyner the character trots about the
globe flanked by a cadre of personal assis
tants and a phalanx of bionic hormone en
hanccd nonagenarian women. He bestows
small kindnesses on his obsequious and
adoring public, eliminates enemies and
generally enjoys his fame, material success
and Zeus like sexual prowess.
The immediate source of this idea can be
traced back to the time shortly after "M\
Cousin, My Gastrocntcrologist" was pub
lished w hen Leyner experienced a modest
degree of success and notoriety.
"It was like being inoculated with a weak
form of the disease of celebrity, and I began

to feel a little of what that
could be like, and it en

gendered in me all <>t
my own fantasies and

delusions about it,
and it was right

at the time

when
I

didn't
kn o w

what to do
with this next
book. . I
took re
course in

what I was col
tcmplating so obsessively at the time."
Tongue-in-cheek self worshi
runs a constant risk of sinkin
into banality, but I.eyner
unflagging energy keeps "I
Tu, Babe" afloat.
Although less denscl
packed than "My ('ousin, My Clastroentero
ogist," the story's narrative exoskcleton i»ci
tlv shapes his style into longer stretches ot c<
herent thought, building more comedic tei
sion and letting the language resonate mor
fully.
l ittle ot his intensity is lost in the proves
and the reader is pulled into the text tar mor
forcefully than in his earlier work.
Devotees of his earlier, more poetic st\ I
will almost certainly be disappointed b\ tin
new accessibility, but I.eyner is opening, u

many new literary vistas with this book, and
there's a strong feeling that he's treading
new ground, not backsliding.
Beneath all the lunacy and hyperbole of
this book, however, there also lurks a nag
£ing feeling of honesty that is actually a bit
frightening, given the book's megalomani
acal premise. Beneath the swaggering in
souciance of Mark Leyner the character, the
reader repeatedly catches glimpses of the
fantasies and the fears of the real Mark
1 .eyner.
Whether he's nonchalantly discussing
the selection of his design for the new Mu
seuni of Modern Art or portraying his wife's
exasperation with his insensitivity, the eerie
ring of truth is unmistakable despite its fan
ciful context.
Actual episodes from his real life that
range from the banal, such as the removal
of mole above his left eyebrow, to the high
ly personal, such as his divorce from his
long time wife, Arleen Portada, pepper the
story.
()nce again veiled by a rather transparent
shroud of hyperbole, these elements lend an
almost chilling verisimilitude to the work.
I eyner acknowledges this strange blur
ring of fact and absurd fiction and points
out that its consistent with the book's ex
animation of the phenomenon of notori
ety.
"If one strips away the hyperbolic com
edv of the book, you w ill find a fairly accu
rate journal of the year and a half it took
me to write it. . . . If I am internalizing this
mechanism of celebrity making, then the
book is about making myself into one.
"It's about taking these kinds of details
my dog, my wife, my marriage, my moles
and elevating them so thex loom large in
the reader's imagination."
At this point it becomes clear that Leyn
er's obsession with fame runs far deeper
than some passing literary interest. Al
though Leyner claims he doesn't entirclv
understand the origins of this obsession,
one can turn up many important clues by
examining his life, going back to when he
w as <X years old.
I his is the time when lie first began to
think of himself as a writer. He remembers
seeing rock bands on television and thinking
how wonderful it would be to be an artist.
"The notion of performing in front of
thousands of people and being able some
how to move other people with a perfor
mance — that was the thing I wanted to do
less then out of any kind of egotism than
just a fascination with being able to do it."
Both because the tools of the trade
paper and ink — were readily available and
because his family placed a "profound pre
mium on verbal dexterity" as an instrument
of power within the home, the art form
I .evner picked to achieve his dream w as writ
ing. He wrote a column for his high school
newspaper and majored in English at Bran
deis.
To hear him tell it, Leyner was a rather
poor Lnglish student at college, but there
he developed Ins passions for other fields
that remain important to Ins work, includ
ing biology and painting both of which
lie still pursues today in his ravenously au
todidactic manner.
As lie moved on to a graduate writing
program at the University of Colorado,
Boulder, though, his passion for the writ
ten word — and more particularly his ob

session with an audience — once again sub
sumed his other interests.
Because the program provided him with
a small, sympathetic group of readers with
whom he could interact, it gave him the
opportunity to fine tune the emotional re
spouses of his audience to his work.
1 <> this day, Leyner feels lus relationship
to his audience is akin to that of a dramatist,
and he considers the reactions of his readers
with every sentence.
Reading "Lt lu, Babe," it's clear that
some part of Leyner still sees the throngs of
screaming teenage fans from his childhood
television as he taps at the keys of his word
pre icessor.
So what's the point of all this,
other than a good belly laugh?
What does Leyner want the
readers to take away from a
book like "Et Tu, Babe?" be
sides the book itself?
Leyner's almost instantly defensive
stance seems practiced; it's clear lie's been
asked this question many times. He delivers
some standard rhetoric on the importance of
laughter in these uncertain times, then ex
pounds on the thematic content of his work.
"First and foremost the book is the
book. The book is the story. The book is the
process. I'he book is the theme. I don't
want you be able to say this book is about
anything.
"It someone says, 'What's this book like?
What's it about?' I want to have concocted
the kind of writing that necessitates saving
l I lere, I better just read some of it to you.' "
Once again, process as meaning. The
idea comes up again and again when study
ing his work. Leyner is also forthcoming,
though, with what he feels is the most im
portant subtext of "Lt Tu, Babe." To him,
it has to do with deconstructing the mvthos
of celebrities in our culture.
"lo the degree that we aggrandize
celebrities in this society, we correspond
ingly disparage our own achievements pro
portionally. . . . It's screwed up people to
some degree — you can't grow up as a kid
in this culture and really appreciate the
w hole fabric of good deeds that keep com
munities together when you've been
brought up with People magazine and In
side Edition and tabloids and television.
"The volume on the aggrandizement is
so high that it drowns out the more basic
and fundamental achievements in our lives,
and I think 'Lt Tu, Babe' makes the process
of notoriety-making so transparent that
hopefully people will look a bit at the w hole
process."
If this sounds like it was concocted after
the fact — to satisfy interviewers — then we
shouldn't be surprised. After all, Mark
Leyner is the reigning literary champion of
the artful segue — making Siamese twins
out of distant strangers.
Nobody seems to be complaining,
though. With requests for interviews and
talk show appearances pouring in, "Lt Tu,
Babe" is quickly becoming a self fulfilling
prophecy.
This isn't a man who's beginning to be
licve his ow 11 press — the press is starting to
believe him ■

some degree — you can't grow up as a kid
in this culture and really appreciate the

"The volume on the aggrandizement is
so high that it drowns out the more basic
and fundamental achievements in our lives,
and I think 'Lt Tu, Babe' makes the process

process."
If this sounds like it was concocted after
the fact — to satisfy interviewers — then we
shouldn't be surprised. After all, Mark
Leyner is the reigning literary champion of
the artful segue — making Siamese twins
out of distant strangers.
Nobody seems to be complaining,
though. With requests for interviews and
talk show appearances pouring in, "Lt Tu,
Babe" is quickly becoming a self fulfilling
prophecy.
This isn't a man who's beginning to be

My advice to the young people of today?
I'm tempted to say: Surround yourself with
flunkies and yes-men and have naked
slaves, perfumed with musk, fan you with
plastic fronds as you write. Because that's
what's worked for me.
This passage typifies the kind of
hyperbole that oozes from
ever)' page of Mark Leyner's
megalomaniacal fantasy, "Et
Tu, Babe."
The narcissistic novel
tracks the ascension of the main character
— Leyner's namesake — to a semi-divine
position as the head of a sprawling multi
national conglomerate founded entirely on
the success of his writing.
In reality, tilings may not have escalated
this far, but as "Et Tu, Babe" attracts more
and more attention both from critics and the
public at large, life is beginning to imitate art
for this 36-year-old New Jersey native.
Leyner made the cover of The New York
l imes Magazine in September, and Esquire
wants to run a photo essay of a day in his
life, complete with photos of him running
with his dog, Carmella, and text by, you
guessed it, Leyner.
Even in person, the soft-spoken Leyner
seems more a phenomenon than a person.
Dressed in blue jeans, a rough cotton shirt
and snake-skin boots, his thinning brown
hair slicked back, Leyner is bedecked with
human skulls: a silver one hangs from a
chain around his neck, and tiny ivorv ones
are strung around his wrist.
As he takes a drag from his cigarette, his
wide eyed intensity exudes an invisible but
nearly palpable form of radiation that
bounces off the walls of the dim hotel room
as he muses on his recent success.
"I don't think I'm even aware of what's

'I wanted
the reader
to feel
like you
were joy
riding

some
kind of
lunatic.
but a
with a
sense of
direction.'

going on right
now because
I'm in the mid
dle of it, espe
cially being on a
tour like this. I
think in a cou
ple of months I
will clear my
living room and
put all the stuff
out on the floor
and get a bottle
of scotch and
look at it for a
day and say
'Look — can
you believe that
from the insane
books you write
this has hap
pened?' "
Fort he
books he's refer
ring to, "insane"
may be an un
derstatement.
Kevner entered
the mass market
in 1990 when
Harm on y
Books published
"My Cousin,
My Gastroen
terologist," his
eclectic collec
tion of jarringlv

hallucinatory stories and razor-edged prose
poetry that combine the rather incongruous
vocabularies of biotechnology, mass market
ing, micro circuitry, anthropology and fatuous
American television into mature literary sensi
bility.
Add Leyner's New Jersey street smarts
and dangerous concentrations of anabolic
steroids and you have a highly reactive com
pound indeed.
The absurd incongruities resonate with
the deafening chaos of modern life in an al
most painfully illuminating way; we laugh
in spite of ourselves. This quality of surreal
juxtaposition has everything to do with
Leyner's writing process, and to explain it,
Leyner borrows a French word from
Claude Levi Strauss' "The Naked Mind":
bricollajic.
"[Strauss] used it to describe the way
certain tribal people w ill use everything and
anything they have on hand to make the
utensils of their life. They use everything
from an animal: some of the animal they eat;
they use the rest of it to clothe themselves;
the bones they use to make tools. It's an en
ergetic making use of what's around.
"That's a perfect description of the way 1
work. I use everything I have lying around in
a piece, no matter how anomalous it may be."
Leyner uses this process even in the rare
instance when he sets out to accomplish a
particular writing task. For example, when
lie interviewed Keith Richards — one of his
idols — for Spin magazine, he threw all
sorts of literary fragments into the piece and
attempted to integrate them. Leyner laughs
at the results: "I have things in this Keith
Richards piece that are so far from having
anything to do with Keith Richards."
The linguistic synergies generated by
bringing together such wildly disparate situa
tions are perhaps the cornerstone of Leyner's
style, lending the work both its hyperkinetic
humor and its significance. He explains:
"I will take the language of intimacy and
put it into the mouth of an ad, for instance,
on television; or inversely take a very public
kind of discourse, the language of corporate
marketing, and put that in the mouth of a
dental hygienist who's cooing to someone
in an office.
"When we take language out of its every -
day context to which we become inured
somehow and put it in a very fresh and dif
ferent context it enables us to see it for the
first time. I think that's one of the things
that makes my books, hopefully, so funny
and also of more serious value to people."
As one examines this unconven
tional writer's relationship to
his unconventional work, a
hazy sort of paradox — one of
controlled chaos — emerges.
On the one hand, Leyner
seems to forge an organic connection be
tween his mind and the page — like a tribal
shaman channeling for a greater conscious
ness.
He eschews any kind of control, refusing
to impose upon himself any restrictions of
theme or structure that might dampen his
creative freedom. Therefore, he never starts
writing with an idea in mind, preferring in
stead to let the process of writing itself gen
crate the ideas.
On the other hand, this former ad writer
is capable ofextreme pragmatism, rewriting
individual sentences ad nauseam and en

thusiastically taking assignments such as the
Keith Richards interview and the Esquire
photo essay.
"I take it as a challenge and a paycheck,"
quips I.cyner. He compares such assign
ments to a period in his ad-writing days
when he'd order exactly whatever the per
son in front of him ordered in the compa
ny cafeteria — a Thoreau-like attempt to
wrest himself from the stifling grasp of his
daily habits.
How does one reconcile these two por
traits of a man and his life's work? C 'loser ex
animation reveals that the crux of the para
dox rests on the premise that there exists a
Mark Leyner separate from his writing
with an agenda and the literary tools to
achieve it.
With Leyner, this simply isn't true. He's
neither a sociologist writing fiction to illumi
nate his theories nor a historian writing fiction

t( > portray an era. He is simply a tic
tion writer, and his writing

process seems to defy
the laws of thermo-

dynamics, con

Th is
fusion of vo

cation and
identitv has never

been more evident
than in "Et Tu, Babe." Al

though similar to "My Cousin, My
Gastroenterologist" in its surreal texture
and manic energy, "Kt Tu, Babe" has some
of the large-scale coherence that "My
Cousin" entirely lacks.
I his shift resulted from a conscious deci
sion by Ixyner to provide "Kt Tu, Babe"
with a minimal narrative skeleton without
cramping his style. "1 wanted the reader to
feel like you were joy riding with some kind
of lunatic, but a lunatic with a sense of di
rection," he says.
The narrative framework Ixyner has
chosen, in some twisted, hyperbolic sense,
is himself.
"Kt lu. Babe" recounts in a blaring first
person the meteoric nse and nihilistic fall of
his persona, also named Mark Keyner, a nar
cissistic ultra macho steroid-inflated Über
mensch who commands the attention of the
entire world from his perch atop the com

mand structure of Team Ixryncr, an interna
tional cult/corporation that apparently has
sprung from the explosive success of his writ
ing.
Leyner the character trots about the
globe flanked by a cadre of personal assis
tants and a phalanx of bionic hormone en
hanccd nonagenarian women. He bestows
small kindnesses on his obsequious and
adoring public, eliminates enemies and
generally enjoys his fame, material success
and Zeus like sexual prowess.
The immediate source of this idea can be
traced back to the time shortly after "M\
Cousin, My Gastrocntcrologist" was pub
lished w hen Leyner experienced a modest
degree of success and notoriety.
"It was like being inoculated with a weak
form of the disease of celebrity, and I began

to feel a little of what that
could be like, and it en

gendered in me all <>t
my own fantasies and

delusions about it,
and it was right

at the time

when
I

didn't
kn o w

what to do
with this next
book. . I
took re
course in

what I was col
tcmplating so obsessively at the time."
Tongue-in-cheek self worshi
runs a constant risk of sinkin
into banality, but I.eyner
unflagging energy keeps "I
Tu, Babe" afloat.
Although less denscl
packed than "My ('ousin, My Clastroentero
ogist," the story's narrative exoskcleton i»ci
tlv shapes his style into longer stretches ot c<
herent thought, building more comedic tei
sion and letting the language resonate mor
fully.
l ittle ot his intensity is lost in the proves
and the reader is pulled into the text tar mor
forcefully than in his earlier work.
Devotees of his earlier, more poetic st\ I
will almost certainly be disappointed b\ tin
new accessibility, but I.eyner is opening, u

many new literary vistas with this book, and
there's a strong feeling that he's treading
new ground, not backsliding.
Beneath all the lunacy and hyperbole of
this book, however, there also lurks a nag
£ing feeling of honesty that is actually a bit
frightening, given the book's megalomani
acal premise. Beneath the swaggering in
souciance of Mark Leyner the character, the
reader repeatedly catches glimpses of the
fantasies and the fears of the real Mark
1 .eyner.
Whether he's nonchalantly discussing
the selection of his design for the new Mu
seuni of Modern Art or portraying his wife's
exasperation with his insensitivity, the eerie
ring of truth is unmistakable despite its fan
ciful context.
Actual episodes from his real life that
range from the banal, such as the removal
of mole above his left eyebrow, to the high
ly personal, such as his divorce from his
long time wife, Arleen Portada, pepper the
story.
()nce again veiled by a rather transparent
shroud of hyperbole, these elements lend an
almost chilling verisimilitude to the work.
I eyner acknowledges this strange blur
ring of fact and absurd fiction and points
out that its consistent with the book's ex
animation of the phenomenon of notori
ety.
"If one strips away the hyperbolic com
edv of the book, you w ill find a fairly accu
rate journal of the year and a half it took
me to write it. . . . If I am internalizing this
mechanism of celebrity making, then the
book is about making myself into one.
"It's about taking these kinds of details
my dog, my wife, my marriage, my moles
and elevating them so thex loom large in
the reader's imagination."
At this point it becomes clear that Leyn
er's obsession with fame runs far deeper
than some passing literary interest. Al
though Leyner claims he doesn't entirclv
understand the origins of this obsession,
one can turn up many important clues by
examining his life, going back to when he
w as <X years old.
I his is the time when lie first began to
think of himself as a writer. He remembers
seeing rock bands on television and thinking
how wonderful it would be to be an artist.
"The notion of performing in front of
thousands of people and being able some
how to move other people with a perfor
mance — that was the thing I wanted to do
less then out of any kind of egotism than
just a fascination with being able to do it."
Both because the tools of the trade
paper and ink — were readily available and
because his family placed a "profound pre
mium on verbal dexterity" as an instrument
of power within the home, the art form
I .evner picked to achieve his dream w as writ
ing. He wrote a column for his high school
newspaper and majored in English at Bran
deis.
To hear him tell it, Leyner was a rather
poor Lnglish student at college, but there
he developed Ins passions for other fields
that remain important to Ins work, includ
ing biology and painting both of which
lie still pursues today in his ravenously au
todidactic manner.
As lie moved on to a graduate writing
program at the University of Colorado,
Boulder, though, his passion for the writ
ten word — and more particularly his ob

session with an audience — once again sub
sumed his other interests.
Because the program provided him with
a small, sympathetic group of readers with
whom he could interact, it gave him the
opportunity to fine tune the emotional re
spouses of his audience to his work.
1 <> this day, Leyner feels lus relationship
to his audience is akin to that of a dramatist,
and he considers the reactions of his readers
with every sentence.
Reading "Lt lu, Babe," it's clear that
some part of Leyner still sees the throngs of
screaming teenage fans from his childhood
television as he taps at the keys of his word
pre icessor.
So what's the point of all this,
other than a good belly laugh?
What does Leyner want the
readers to take away from a
book like "Et Tu, Babe?" be
sides the book itself?
Leyner's almost instantly defensive
stance seems practiced; it's clear lie's been
asked this question many times. He delivers
some standard rhetoric on the importance of
laughter in these uncertain times, then ex
pounds on the thematic content of his work.
"First and foremost the book is the
book. The book is the story. The book is the
process. I'he book is the theme. I don't
want you be able to say this book is about
anything.
"It someone says, 'What's this book like?
What's it about?' I want to have concocted
the kind of writing that necessitates saving
l I lere, I better just read some of it to you.' "
Once again, process as meaning. The
idea comes up again and again when study
ing his work. Leyner is also forthcoming,
though, with what he feels is the most im
portant subtext of "Lt Tu, Babe." To him,
it has to do with deconstructing the mvthos
of celebrities in our culture.
"lo the degree that we aggrandize
celebrities in this society, we correspond
ingly disparage our own achievements pro
portionally. . . . It's screwed up people to
some degree — you can't grow up as a kid
in this culture and really appreciate the
w hole fabric of good deeds that keep com
munities together when you've been
brought up with People magazine and In
side Edition and tabloids and television.
"The volume on the aggrandizement is
so high that it drowns out the more basic
and fundamental achievements in our lives,
and I think 'Lt Tu, Babe' makes the process
of notoriety-making so transparent that
hopefully people will look a bit at the w hole
process."
If this sounds like it was concocted after
the fact — to satisfy interviewers — then we
shouldn't be surprised. After all, Mark
Leyner is the reigning literary champion of
the artful segue — making Siamese twins
out of distant strangers.
Nobody seems to be complaining,
though. With requests for interviews and

some standard rhetoric on the importance of
laughter in these uncertain times, then ex
pounds on the thematic content of his work.
"First and foremost the book is the
book. The book is the story. The book is the
process. I'he book is the theme. I don't
want you be able to say this book is about
anything.
"It someone says, 'What's this book like?
What's it about?' I want to have concocted
the kind of writing that necessitates saving
l I lere, I better just read some of it to you.' "
Once again, process as meaning. The
idea comes up again and again when study
ing his work. Leyner is also forthcoming,
though, with what he feels is the most im
portant subtext of "Lt Tu, Babe." To him,
it has to do with deconstructing the mvthos
of celebrities in our culture.
"lo the degree that we aggrandize
celebrities in this society, we correspond
ingly disparage our own achievements pro
portionally. . . . It's screwed up people to
some degree — you can't grow up as a kid
in this culture and really appreciate the
w hole fabric of good deeds that keep com
munities together when you've been
brought up with People magazine and In
side Edition and tabloids and television.
"The volume on the aggrandizement is
so high that it drowns out the more basic
and fundamental achievements in our lives,
and I think 'Lt Tu, Babe' makes the process
of notoriety-making so transparent that
hopefully people will look a bit at the w hole
process."
If this sounds like it was concocted after
the fact — to satisfy interviewers — then we
shouldn't be surprised. After all, Mark
Leyner is the reigning literary champion of
the artful segue — making Siamese twins
out of distant strangers.
Nobody seems to be complaining,
though. With requests for interviews and
talk show appearances pouring in, "Lt Tu,
Babe" is quickly becoming a self fulfilling
prophecy.
This isn't a man who's beginning to be
licve his ow 11 press — the press is starting to
believe him ■


My advice to the young people of today?
I'm tempted to say: Surround yourself with
flunkies and yes-men and have naked
slaves, perfumed with musk, fan you with
plastic fronds as you write. Because that's
what's worked for me.
This passage typifies the kind of
hyperbole that oozes from
ever)' page of Mark Leyner's
megalomaniacal fantasy, "Et
Tu, Babe."
The narcissistic novel
tracks the ascension of the main character
— Leyner's namesake — to a semi-divine
position as the head of a sprawling multi
national conglomerate founded entirely on
the success of his writing.
In reality, tilings may not have escalated
this far, but as "Et Tu, Babe" attracts more
and more attention both from critics and the
public at large, life is beginning to imitate art
for this 36-year-old New Jersey native.
Leyner made the cover of The New York
l imes Magazine in September, and Esquire
wants to run a photo essay of a day in his
life, complete with photos of him running
with his dog, Carmella, and text by, you
guessed it, Leyner.
Even in person, the soft-spoken Leyner
seems more a phenomenon than a person.
Dressed in blue jeans, a rough cotton shirt
and snake-skin boots, his thinning brown
hair slicked back, Leyner is bedecked with
human skulls: a silver one hangs from a
chain around his neck, and tiny ivorv ones
are strung around his wrist.
As he takes a drag from his cigarette, his
wide eyed intensity exudes an invisible but
nearly palpable form of radiation that
bounces off the walls of the dim hotel room
as he muses on his recent success.
"I don't think I'm even aware of what's

'I wanted
the reader
to feel
like you
were joy
riding
with
some
kind of
lunatic.
but a
with a
sense of
direction.'

going on right
now because
I'm in the mid
dle of it, espe
cially being on a
tour like this. I
think in a cou
ple of months I
will clear my
living room and
put all the stuff
out on the floor
and get a bottle
of scotch and
look at it for a
day and say
'Look — can
you believe that
from the insane
books you write
this has hap
pened?' "
Fort he
books he's refer
ring to, "insane"
may be an un
derstatement.
Kevner entered
the mass market
in 1990 when
Harm on y
Books published
"My Cousin,
My Gastroen
terologist," his
eclectic collec
tion of jarringlv

hallucinatory stories and razor-edged prose
poetry that combine the rather incongruous
vocabularies of biotechnology, mass market
ing, micro circuitry, anthropology and fatuous
American television into mature literary sensi
bility.
Add Leyner's New Jersey street smarts
and dangerous concentrations of anabolic
steroids and you have a highly reactive com
pound indeed.
The absurd incongruities resonate with
the deafening chaos of modern life in an al
most painfully illuminating way; we laugh
in spite of ourselves. This quality of surreal
juxtaposition has everything to do with
Leyner's writing process, and to explain it,
Leyner borrows a French word from
Claude Levi Strauss' "The Naked Mind":
bricollajic.
"[Strauss] used it to describe the way
certain tribal people w ill use everything and
anything they have on hand to make the
utensils of their life. They use everything
from an animal: some of the animal they eat;
they use the rest of it to clothe themselves;
the bones they use to make tools. It's an en
ergetic making use of what's around.
"That's a perfect description of the way 1
work. I use everything I have lying around in
a piece, no matter how anomalous it may be."
Leyner uses this process even in the rare
instance when he sets out to accomplish a
particular writing task. For example, when
lie interviewed Keith Richards — one of his
idols — for Spin magazine, he threw all
sorts of literary fragments into the piece and
attempted to integrate them. Leyner laughs
at the results: "I have things in this Keith
Richards piece that are so far from having
anything to do with Keith Richards."
The linguistic synergies generated by
bringing together such wildly disparate situa
tions are perhaps the cornerstone of Leyner's
style, lending the work both its hyperkinetic
humor and its significance. He explains:
"I will take the language of intimacy and
put it into the mouth of an ad, for instance,
on television; or inversely take a very public
kind of discourse, the language of corporate
marketing, and put that in the mouth of a
dental hygienist who's cooing to someone
in an office.
"When we take language out of its every -
day context to which we become inured
somehow and put it in a very fresh and dif
ferent context it enables us to see it for the
first time. I think that's one of the things
that makes my books, hopefully, so funny
and also of more serious value to people."
As one examines this unconven
tional writer's relationship to
his unconventional work, a
hazy sort of paradox — one of
controlled chaos — emerges.
On the one hand, Leyner
seems to forge an organic connection be
tween his mind and the page — like a tribal
shaman channeling for a greater conscious
ness.
He eschews any kind of control, refusing
to impose upon himself any restrictions of
theme or structure that might dampen his
creative freedom. Therefore, he never starts
writing with an idea in mind, preferring in
stead to let the process of writing itself gen
crate the ideas.
On the other hand, this former ad writer
is capable ofextreme pragmatism, rewriting
individual sentences ad nauseam and en

thusiastically taking assignments such as the
Keith Richards interview and the Esquire
photo essay.
"I take it as a challenge and a paycheck,"
quips I.cyner. He compares such assign
ments to a period in his ad-writing days
when he'd order exactly whatever the per
son in front of him ordered in the compa
ny cafeteria — a Thoreau-like attempt to
wrest himself from the stifling grasp of his
daily habits.
How does one reconcile these two por
traits of a man and his life's work? C 'loser ex
animation reveals that the crux of the para
dox rests on the premise that there exists a
Mark Leyner separate from his writing
with an agenda and the literary tools to
achieve it.
With Leyner, this simply isn't true. He's
neither a sociologist writing fiction to illumi
nate his theories nor a historian writing fiction

t( > portray an era. He is simply a tic
tion writer, and his writing

process seems to defy
the laws of thermo-

dynamics, con

Th is
fusion of vo

cation and
identitv has never

been more evident
than in "Et Tu, Babe." Al

though similar to "My Cousin, My
Gastroenterologist" in its surreal texture
and manic energy, "Kt Tu, Babe" has some
of the large-scale coherence that "My
Cousin" entirely lacks.
I his shift resulted from a conscious deci
sion by Ixyner to provide "Kt Tu, Babe"
with a minimal narrative skeleton without
cramping his style. "1 wanted the reader to
feel like you were joy riding with some kind
of lunatic, but a lunatic with a sense of di
rection," he says.
The narrative framework Ixyner has
chosen, in some twisted, hyperbolic sense,
is himself.
"Kt lu. Babe" recounts in a blaring first
person the meteoric nse and nihilistic fall of
his persona, also named Mark Keyner, a nar
cissistic ultra macho steroid-inflated Über
mensch who commands the attention of the
entire world from his perch atop the com

mand structure of Team Ixryncr, an interna
tional cult/corporation that apparently has
sprung from the explosive success of his writ
ing.
Leyner the character trots about the
globe flanked by a cadre of personal assis
tants and a phalanx of bionic hormone en
hanccd nonagenarian women. He bestows
small kindnesses on his obsequious and
adoring public, eliminates enemies and
generally enjoys his fame, material success
and Zeus like sexual prowess.
The immediate source of this idea can be
traced back to the time shortly after "M\
Cousin, My Gastrocntcrologist" was pub
lished w hen Leyner experienced a modest
degree of success and notoriety.
"It was like being inoculated with a weak
form of the disease of celebrity, and I began

to feel a little of what that
could be like, and it en

gendered in me all <>t
my own fantasies and

delusions about it,
and it was right

at the time

when
I

didn't
kn o w

what to do
with this next
book. . I
took re
course in

what I was col
tcmplating so obsessively at the time."
Tongue-in-cheek self worshi
runs a constant risk of sinkin
into banality, but I.eyner
unflagging energy keeps "I
Tu, Babe" afloat.
Although less denscl
packed than "My ('ousin, My Clastroentero
ogist," the story's narrative exoskcleton i»ci
tlv shapes his style into longer stretches ot c<
herent thought, building more comedic tei
sion and letting the language resonate mor
fully.
l ittle ot his intensity is lost in the proves
and the reader is pulled into the text tar mor
forcefully than in his earlier work.
Devotees of his earlier, more poetic st\ I
will almost certainly be disappointed b\ tin
new accessibility, but I.eyner is opening, u

many new literary vistas with this book, and
there's a strong feeling that he's treading
new ground, not backsliding.
Beneath all the lunacy and hyperbole of
this book, however, there also lurks a nag
£ing feeling of honesty that is actually a bit
frightening, given the book's megalomani
acal premise. Beneath the swaggering in
souciance of Mark Leyner the character, the
reader repeatedly catches glimpses of the
fantasies and the fears of the real Mark
1 .eyner.
Whether he's nonchalantly discussing
the selection of his design for the new Mu
seuni of Modern Art or portraying his wife's
exasperation with his insensitivity, the eerie
ring of truth is unmistakable despite its fan
ciful context.
Actual episodes from his real life that
range from the banal, such as the removal
of mole above his left eyebrow, to the high
ly personal, such as his divorce from his
long time wife, Arleen Portada, pepper the
story.
()nce again veiled by a rather transparent
shroud of hyperbole, these elements lend an
almost chilling verisimilitude to the work.
I eyner acknowledges this strange blur
ring of fact and absurd fiction and points
out that its consistent with the book's ex
animation of the phenomenon of notori
ety.
"If one strips away the hyperbolic com
edv of the book, you w ill find a fairly accu
rate journal of the year and a half it took
me to write it. . . . If I am internalizing this
mechanism of celebrity making, then the
book is about making myself into one.
"It's about taking these kinds of details
my dog, my wife, my marriage, my moles
and elevating them so thex loom large in
the reader's imagination."
At this point it becomes clear that Leyn
er's obsession with fame runs far deeper
than some passing literary interest. Al
though Leyner claims he doesn't entirclv
understand the origins of this obsession,
one can turn up many important clues by
examining his life, going back to when he
w as <X years old.
I his is the time when lie first began to
think of himself as a writer. He remembers
seeing rock bands on television and thinking
how wonderful it would be to be an artist.
"The notion of performing in front of
thousands of people and being able some
how to move other people with a perfor
mance — that was the thing I wanted to do
less then out of any kind of egotism than
just a fascination with being able to do it."
Both because the tools of the trade
paper and ink — were readily available and
because his family placed a "profound pre
mium on verbal dexterity" as an instrument
of power within the home, the art form
I .evner picked to achieve his dream w as writ
ing. He wrote a column for his high school
newspaper and majored in English at Bran
deis.
To hear him tell it, Leyner was a rather
poor Lnglish student at college, but there
he developed Ins passions for other fields
that remain important to Ins work, includ
ing biology and painting both of which
lie still pursues today in his ravenously au
todidactic manner.
As lie moved on to a graduate writing
program at the University of Colorado,
Boulder, though, his passion for the writ
ten word — and more particularly his ob

session with an audience — once again sub
sumed his other interests.
Because the program provided him with
a small, sympathetic group of readers with
whom he could interact, it gave him the
opportunity to fine tune the emotional re
spouses of his audience to his work.
1 <> this day, Leyner feels lus relationship
to his audience is akin to that of a dramatist,
and he considers the reactions of his readers
with every sentence.
Reading "Lt lu, Babe," it's clear that
some part of Leyner still sees the throngs of
screaming teenage fans from his childhood
television as he taps at the keys of his word
pre icessor.
So what's the point of all this,
other than a good belly laugh?
What does Leyner want the
readers to take away from a
book like "Et Tu, Babe?" be
sides the book itself?
Leyner's almost instantly defensive
stance seems practiced; it's clear lie's been
asked this question many times. He delivers
some standard rhetoric on the importance of
laughter in these uncertain times, then ex
pounds on the thematic content of his work.
"First and foremost the book is the
book. The book is the story. The book is the
process. I'he book is the theme. I don't
want you be able to say this book is about

"It someone says, 'What's this book like?

ten word — and more particularly his ob

session with an audience — once again sub
sumed his other interests.
Because the program provided him with
a small, sympathetic group of readers with
whom he could interact, it gave him the
opportunity to fine tune the emotional re
spouses of his audience to his work.
1 <> this day, Leyner feels lus relationship
to his audience is akin to that of a dramatist,
and he considers the reactions of his readers
with every sentence.
Reading "Lt lu, Babe," it's clear that
some part of Leyner still sees the throngs of
screaming teenage fans from his childhood
television as he taps at the keys of his word
pre icessor.
So what's the point of all this,
other than a good belly laugh?
What does Leyner want the
readers to take away from a
book like "Et Tu, Babe?" be
sides the book itself?
Leyner's almost instantly defensive
stance seems practiced; it's clear lie's been
asked this question many times. He delivers
some standard rhetoric on the importance of
laughter in these uncertain times, then ex
pounds on the thematic content of his work.
"First and foremost the book is the
book. The book is the story. The book is the
process. I'he book is the theme. I don't
want you be able to say this book is about
anything.
"It someone says, 'What's this book like?
What's it about?' I want to have concocted
the kind of writing that necessitates saving
l I lere, I better just read some of it to you.' "
Once again, process as meaning. The
idea comes up again and again when study
ing his work. Leyner is also forthcoming,
though, with what he feels is the most im
portant subtext of "Lt Tu, Babe." To him,
it has to do with deconstructing the mvthos
of celebrities in our culture.
"lo the degree that we aggrandize
celebrities in this society, we correspond
ingly disparage our own achievements pro
portionally. . . . It's screwed up people to
some degree — you can't grow up as a kid
in this culture and really appreciate the
w hole fabric of good deeds that keep com
munities together when you've been
brought up with People magazine and In
side Edition and tabloids and television.
"The volume on the aggrandizement is
so high that it drowns out the more basic
and fundamental achievements in our lives,
and I think 'Lt Tu, Babe' makes the process
of notoriety-making so transparent that
hopefully people will look a bit at the w hole
process."
If this sounds like it was concocted after
the fact — to satisfy interviewers — then we
shouldn't be surprised. After all, Mark
Leyner is the reigning literary champion of
the artful segue — making Siamese twins
out of distant strangers.
Nobody seems to be complaining,
though. With requests for interviews and
talk show appearances pouring in, "Lt Tu,
Babe" is quickly becoming a self fulfilling
prophecy.
This isn't a man who's beginning to be
licve his ow 11 press — the press is starting to
believe him ■


My advice to the young people of today?
I'm tempted to say: Surround yourself with
flunkies and yes-men and have naked
slaves, perfumed with musk, fan you with
plastic fronds as you write. Because that's
what's worked for me.
This passage typifies the kind of
hyperbole that oozes from
ever)' page of Mark Leyner's
megalomaniacal fantasy, "Et
Tu, Babe."
The narcissistic novel
tracks the ascension of the main character
— Leyner's namesake — to a semi-divine
position as the head of a sprawling multi
national conglomerate founded entirely on
the success of his writing.
In reality, tilings may not have escalated
this far, but as "Et Tu, Babe" attracts more
and more attention both from critics and the
public at large, life is beginning to imitate art
for this 36-year-old New Jersey native.
Leyner made the cover of The New York
l imes Magazine in September, and Esquire
wants to run a photo essay of a day in his
life, complete with photos of him running
with his dog, Carmella, and text by, you
guessed it, Leyner.
Even in person, the soft-spoken Leyner
seems more a phenomenon than a person.
Dressed in blue jeans, a rough cotton shirt
and snake-skin boots, his thinning brown
hair slicked back, Leyner is bedecked with
human skulls: a silver one hangs from a
chain around his neck, and tiny ivorv ones
are strung around his wrist.
As he takes a drag from his cigarette, his
wide eyed intensity exudes an invisible but
nearly palpable form of radiation that
bounces off the walls of the dim hotel room
as he muses on his recent success.
"I don't think I'm even aware of what's

'I wanted
the reader
to feel
like you
were joy
riding
with
some
kind of
lunatic.
but a
with a
sense of
direction.'

going on right
now because
I'm in the mid
dle of it, espe
cially being on a
tour like this. I
think in a cou
ple of months I
will clear my
living room and
put all the stuff
out on the floor
and get a bottle
of scotch and
look at it for a
day and say
'Look — can
you believe that
from the insane
books you write
this has hap
pened?' "
Fort he
books he's refer
ring to, "insane"
may be an un
derstatement.
Kevner entered
the mass market
in 1990 when
Harm on y
Books published
"My Cousin,
My Gastroen
terologist," his
eclectic collec
tion of jarringlv

hallucinatory stories and razor-edged prose
poetry that combine the rather incongruous
vocabularies of biotechnology, mass market
ing, micro circuitry, anthropology and fatuous
American television into mature literary sensi
bility.
Add Leyner's New Jersey street smarts
and dangerous concentrations of anabolic
steroids and you have a highly reactive com
pound indeed.
The absurd incongruities resonate with
the deafening chaos of modern life in an al
most painfully illuminating way; we laugh
in spite of ourselves. This quality of surreal
juxtaposition has everything to do with
Leyner's writing process, and to explain it,
Leyner borrows a French word from
Claude Levi Strauss' "The Naked Mind":
bricollajic.
"[Strauss] used it to describe the way
certain tribal people w ill use everything and
anything they have on hand to make the
utensils of their life. They use everything
from an animal: some of the animal they eat;
they use the rest of it to clothe themselves;
the bones they use to make tools. It's an en
ergetic making use of what's around.
"That's a perfect description of the way 1
work. I use everything I have lying around in
a piece, no matter how anomalous it may be."
Leyner uses this process even in the rare
instance when he sets out to accomplish a
particular writing task. For example, when
lie interviewed Keith Richards — one of his
idols — for Spin magazine, he threw all
sorts of literary fragments into the piece and
attempted to integrate them. Leyner laughs
at the results: "I have things in this Keith
Richards piece that are so far from having
anything to do with Keith Richards."
The linguistic synergies generated by
bringing together such wildly disparate situa
tions are perhaps the cornerstone of Leyner's
style, lending the work both its hyperkinetic
humor and its significance. He explains:
"I will take the language of intimacy and
put it into the mouth of an ad, for instance,
on television; or inversely take a very public
kind of discourse, the language of corporate
marketing, and put that in the mouth of a
dental hygienist who's cooing to someone
in an office.
"When we take language out of its every -
day context to which we become inured
somehow and put it in a very fresh and dif
ferent context it enables us to see it for the
first time. I think that's one of the things
that makes my books, hopefully, so funny
and also of more serious value to people."
As one examines this unconven
tional writer's relationship to
his unconventional work, a
hazy sort of paradox — one of
controlled chaos — emerges.
On the one hand, Leyner
seems to forge an organic connection be
tween his mind and the page — like a tribal
shaman channeling for a greater conscious
ness.
He eschews any kind of control, refusing
to impose upon himself any restrictions of
theme or structure that might dampen his
creative freedom. Therefore, he never starts
writing with an idea in mind, preferring in
stead to let the process of writing itself gen
crate the ideas.
On the other hand, this former ad writer
is capable ofextreme pragmatism, rewriting
individual sentences ad nauseam and en

thusiastically taking assignments such as the
Keith Richards interview and the Esquire
photo essay.
"I take it as a challenge and a paycheck,"
quips I.cyner. He compares such assign
ments to a period in his ad-writing days
when he'd order exactly whatever the per
son in front of him ordered in the compa
ny cafeteria — a Thoreau-like attempt to
wrest himself from the stifling grasp of his
daily habits.
How does one reconcile these two por
traits of a man and his life's work? C 'loser ex
animation reveals that the crux of the para
dox rests on the premise that there exists a
Mark Leyner separate from his writing
with an agenda and the literary tools to
achieve it.
With Leyner, this simply isn't true. He's
neither a sociologist writing fiction to illumi
nate his theories nor a historian writing fiction

t( > portray an era. He is simply a tic
tion writer, and his writing

process seems to defy
the laws of thermo-

dynamics, con

Th is
fusion of vo

cation and
identitv has never

been more evident
than in "Et Tu, Babe." Al

though similar to "My Cousin, My
Gastroenterologist" in its surreal texture
and manic energy, "Kt Tu, Babe" has some
of the large-scale coherence that "My
Cousin" entirely lacks.
I his shift resulted from a conscious deci
sion by Ixyner to provide "Kt Tu, Babe"
with a minimal narrative skeleton without
cramping his style. "1 wanted the reader to
feel like you were joy riding with some kind
of lunatic, but a lunatic with a sense of di
rection," he says.
The narrative framework Ixyner has
chosen, in some twisted, hyperbolic sense,
is himself.
"Kt lu. Babe" recounts in a blaring first
person the meteoric nse and nihilistic fall of
his persona, also named Mark Keyner, a nar
cissistic ultra macho steroid-inflated Über
mensch who commands the attention of the
entire world from his perch atop the com

mand structure of Team Ixryncr, an interna
tional cult/corporation that apparently has
sprung from the explosive success of his writ
ing.
Leyner the character trots about the
globe flanked by a cadre of personal assis
tants and a phalanx of bionic hormone en
hanccd nonagenarian women. He bestows
small kindnesses on his obsequious and
adoring public, eliminates enemies and
generally enjoys his fame, material success
and Zeus like sexual prowess.
The immediate source of this idea can be
traced back to the time shortly after "M\
Cousin, My Gastrocntcrologist" was pub
lished w hen Leyner experienced a modest
degree of success and notoriety.
"It was like being inoculated with a weak
form of the disease of celebrity, and I began

to feel a little of what that
could be like, and it en

gendered in me all <>t
my own fantasies and

delusions about it,
and it was right

at the time

when
I

didn't
kn o w

what to do
with this next
book. . I
took re
course in

what I was col
tcmplating so obsessively at the time."
Tongue-in-cheek self worshi
runs a constant risk of sinkin
into banality, but I.eyner
unflagging energy keeps "I
Tu, Babe" afloat.
Although less denscl
packed than "My ('ousin, My Clastroentero
ogist," the story's narrative exoskcleton i»ci
tlv shapes his style into longer stretches ot c<
herent thought, building more comedic tei
sion and letting the language resonate mor
fully.
l ittle ot his intensity is lost in the proves
and the reader is pulled into the text tar mor
forcefully than in his earlier work.
Devotees of his earlier, more poetic st\ I
will almost certainly be disappointed b\ tin
new accessibility, but I.eyner is opening, u

many new literary vistas with this book, and
there's a strong feeling that he's treading
new ground, not backsliding.
Beneath all the lunacy and hyperbole of
this book, however, there also lurks a nag
£ing feeling of honesty that is actually a bit
frightening, given the book's megalomani
acal premise. Beneath the swaggering in
souciance of Mark Leyner the character, the
reader repeatedly catches glimpses of the
fantasies and the fears of the real Mark
1 .eyner.
Whether he's nonchalantly discussing
the selection of his design for the new Mu
seuni of Modern Art or portraying his wife's
exasperation with his insensitivity, the eerie
ring of truth is unmistakable despite its fan
ciful context.
Actual episodes from his real life that
range from the banal, such as the removal
of mole above his left eyebrow, to the high
ly personal, such as his divorce from his
long time wife, Arleen Portada, pepper the
story.
()nce again veiled by a rather transparent
shroud of hyperbole, these elements lend an
almost chilling verisimilitude to the work.
I eyner acknowledges this strange blur
ring of fact and absurd fiction and points
out that its consistent with the book's ex
animation of the phenomenon of notori
ety.
"If one strips away the hyperbolic com
edv of the book, you w ill find a fairly accu
rate journal of the year and a half it took
me to write it. . . . If I am internalizing this
mechanism of celebrity making, then the
book is about making myself into one.
"It's about taking these kinds of details
my dog, my wife, my marriage, my moles
and elevating them so thex loom large in
the reader's imagination."
At this point it becomes clear that Leyn
er's obsession with fame runs far deeper
than some passing literary interest. Al
though Leyner claims he doesn't entirclv
understand the origins of this obsession,
one can turn up many important clues by
examining his life, going back to when he
w as <X years old.
I his is the time when lie first began to
think of himself as a writer. He remembers
seeing rock bands on television and thinking
how wonderful it would be to be an artist.
"The notion of performing in front of
thousands of people and being able some
how to move other people with a perfor
mance — that was the thing I wanted to do
less then out of any kind of egotism than
just a fascination with being able to do it."
Both because the tools of the trade
paper and ink — were readily available and
because his family placed a "profound pre
mium on verbal dexterity" as an instrument
of power within the home, the art form
I .evner picked to achieve his dream w as writ
ing. He wrote a column for his high school
newspaper and majored in English at Bran
deis.
To hear him tell it, Leyner was a rather
poor Lnglish student at college, but there
he developed Ins passions for other fields
that remain important to Ins work, includ
ing biology and painting both of which
lie still pursues today in his ravenously au
todidactic manner.
As lie moved on to a graduate writing
program at the University of Colorado,
Boulder, though, his passion for the writ
ten word — and more particularly his ob

session with an audience — once again sub
sumed his other interests.
Because the program provided him with
a small, sympathetic group of readers with
whom he could interact, it gave him the
opportunity to fine tune the emotional re
spouses of his audience to his work.

"The notion of performing in front of
thousands of people and being able some
how to move other people with a perfor
mance — that was the thing I wanted to do
less then out of any kind of egotism than
just a fascination with being able to do it."
Both because the tools of the trade
paper and ink — were readily available and
because his family placed a "profound pre
mium on verbal dexterity" as an instrument
of power within the home, the art form
I .evner picked to achieve his dream w as writ
ing. He wrote a column for his high school
newspaper and majored in English at Bran
deis.
To hear him tell it, Leyner was a rather
poor Lnglish student at college, but there
he developed Ins passions for other fields
that remain important to Ins work, includ
ing biology and painting both of which
lie still pursues today in his ravenously au
todidactic manner.
As lie moved on to a graduate writing
program at the University of Colorado,
Boulder, though, his passion for the writ
ten word — and more particularly his ob

session with an audience — once again sub
sumed his other interests.
Because the program provided him with
a small, sympathetic group of readers with
whom he could interact, it gave him the
opportunity to fine tune the emotional re
spouses of his audience to his work.
1 <> this day, Leyner feels lus relationship
to his audience is akin to that of a dramatist,
and he considers the reactions of his readers
with every sentence.
Reading "Lt lu, Babe," it's clear that
some part of Leyner still sees the throngs of
screaming teenage fans from his childhood
television as he taps at the keys of his word
pre icessor.
So what's the point of all this,
other than a good belly laugh?
What does Leyner want the
readers to take away from a
book like "Et Tu, Babe?" be
sides the book itself?
Leyner's almost instantly defensive
stance seems practiced; it's clear lie's been
asked this question many times. He delivers
some standard rhetoric on the importance of
laughter in these uncertain times, then ex
pounds on the thematic content of his work.
"First and foremost the book is the
book. The book is the story. The book is the
process. I'he book is the theme. I don't
want you be able to say this book is about
anything.
"It someone says, 'What's this book like?
What's it about?' I want to have concocted
the kind of writing that necessitates saving
l I lere, I better just read some of it to you.' "
Once again, process as meaning. The
idea comes up again and again when study
ing his work. Leyner is also forthcoming,
though, with what he feels is the most im
portant subtext of "Lt Tu, Babe." To him,
it has to do with deconstructing the mvthos
of celebrities in our culture.
"lo the degree that we aggrandize
celebrities in this society, we correspond
ingly disparage our own achievements pro
portionally. . . . It's screwed up people to
some degree — you can't grow up as a kid
in this culture and really appreciate the
w hole fabric of good deeds that keep com
munities together when you've been
brought up with People magazine and In
side Edition and tabloids and television.
"The volume on the aggrandizement is
so high that it drowns out the more basic
and fundamental achievements in our lives,
and I think 'Lt Tu, Babe' makes the process
of notoriety-making so transparent that
hopefully people will look a bit at the w hole
process."
If this sounds like it was concocted after
the fact — to satisfy interviewers — then we
shouldn't be surprised. After all, Mark
Leyner is the reigning literary champion of
the artful segue — making Siamese twins
out of distant strangers.
Nobody seems to be complaining,
though. With requests for interviews and
talk show appearances pouring in, "Lt Tu,
Babe" is quickly becoming a self fulfilling
prophecy.
This isn't a man who's beginning to be
licve his ow 11 press — the press is starting to
believe him ■
