### Theodore Quinn 
Shampoo Planet
by Douglas Coupland
(Pockct Books, $20.00)
"Shampoo Planet," a darkly comic novel
by Douglas Coupland, sets out to find and
tag the "Lost Generation" of twentysome
things: the children of the children of the
'60s.
Although it may not exactly locate this
ever-elusive flock, it unearths some impor
tant clues to their whereabouts.
The story revolves around the travails of
20-year-old Tyler Johnson, a young student
in hotel and motel management studies
with aspirations of corporate glory, an ob
session with modernity and an extensive
collection of fine hair care products.
Tyler lives at home with his single moth
er Jasmine, a somewhat disillusioned flower
child raising her three children in a small
Washington town increasingly choked with
weeds.
They are an eclectic family to say the
least, with Tyler's sister Daisy quickly fol
lowing in her mother's flower-strewn foot
steps and his young brother Mark only old
enough to watch cartoons and chronicle his
family's lunacy in refrigerator magnet draw
ings. But they're a close-knit bunch and
they support each other through turbulent
relationships, fading dreams and bad hair
days.
As the reader follows Tyler through the
crises of his family members, his painful am
bivalence toward two wildly contrasting
love interests and his desperate attempts to
chase down the jet plane of success that will
carry him from his dying community, the
reader becomes acutely aware of a certain
schizophrenia within him.
He seems to swing erratically between
sincere compassion and smug self-interest,
between sensitivity and superficiality. If
Tyler is to be Coupland's archetype for
young America, it is perhaps his most im
portant task to reconcile these two Tyler
Johnsons and show the reader how they

peacefully can coexist both in this character
and in modern society.
Unfortunately, Coupland comes up a bit
short.
Although his portrait of Tyler is convinc
ing, Coupland spends the first half of the
book trying to decide whether to inhabit his
principal character and view the 1990s
through his eyes or simply stare at him un
comprehendingly.
Coupland doesn't truly embrace Tyler
until angst has completely overwhelmed his
smug self-confidence. But by that time

Tyler has been permanently changed and
views any vestiges of the Donald Trump
proselyte he once was with a healthy degree
of skepticism.
Although the author offers up financial
ruin and violent heartbreak as concrete in
tellectual reasons for this transformation,
the whole sequence reads like a cop-out, an
arbitrarily imposed excuse to pass his own
irony on to Tyler so Coupland can em
pathize with him fully.
The reader, though gratified by this
long-awaited connection with Tyler, sets

the book down with the sense of an impor
tant idea having been abandoned, an unre
solved chord in the book's coda.
Writing a work of fiction that attempts to
capture the crystalline spirit of modernity is
a losing proposition it seems; modernity by
definition is fickle, and the eternal now is a
vanishing point in time.
The best works to set themselves upon
the task typically abandon the fruitless pur
suit of now in favor of a broader scope.
Coupland does not give up the chase,
however, choosing instead to convey the
immediacy of his story by drowning the
reader in not-quite-up-to-datc buzzwords
from the twin spheres of corporate greed
and technology.
This jargon also peppers the ultra-hip pa
tois of Tyler's cartoonish twentysomething
friends. Ironically, the result seems a bit stale
— a throwback to the 1980s — if indeed it's
far enough into the 1990s to say so.
Docs all this add up to a superficial
novel? Hardly. Although Coupland's writ
ing seems thinnest precisely when he is try
ing to be most profound, there is much wis
dom to be found between the buzzwords
and the registered trademarks. Coupland
questions himself about modern life and
modern culture in the course of his story,
and if he doesn't come up with satisfactory
answers, it's not for lack of trying.
The answers he never finds arc the miss
ing connections that would unify this novel
and reconcile much of its schizophrenia, but
the remaining fragments are often near-per
fect pearls of insight waiting only to be
strung together.
Also, the book is funny. Although little
of the humor is free from a certain gray fore
boding, Coupland can make the reader
laugh out loud at times,'and the laughter is
not without its own sort of wisdom.
In any event, Coupland rarely lacks the
ability to make the reader feel — despite the
austerity of the modern world he presents
and in which his novel is published. This
seems to be an increasingly rare accomplish
ment in modern literature, and is reason
enough to read "Shampoo Planet." ■
