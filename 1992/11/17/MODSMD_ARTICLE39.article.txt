The Conservitive Crack-up
by R. Emmett Tyrrell (Simon &
Schuster, 523.00)
R. Emmett Tyrrell admits his
two most recent books haven't
made him a lot of friends.
"With 'The Conservative
Crack-Up,' I have put myself at
the center of criticism of conser
vatism and liberalism. That is tak
ing on quite a lot," said the author
of the 1984 book "The Liberal
Crack-Up" and the recent critique
of conservatism. "If there is any
body I haven't offended, I could
write a third book, I suppose."
The founder and editor of The
American Spectator — what he
describes as a "conservative intel
lectual review" — is rarely afraid to
speak his mind, and"The Conser
vative Crack-Up" is a no-holds
barrcd examination of the prob
lems plaguing the conservative
movement.
The problem with conserva
tives, according to Tyrrell, is their
"intrinsic disrelish for politics."

They simply don't care to be in
volved in campaigning, politicking
and the variety of other activities
associated with seeking govern
ment office.
"Conservatives are too much
given to the private, the familiar,
conventions unexamined and un
challenged. They arc only slowly
roused to public life," Tyrrell
writes. "When one analyzes con
servative and liberal leaders, one
notes a stark difference. Liberals
relish the public life and long for
public controversy; not many con
servatives do."
The thesis is an interesting one,
as Tyrrell downplays the media's
common explanations of the
downfall of conservatives, arguing
that the so-called split in the Re
publican part)' has been exaggerat
ed.
"Too much has always been
made of doctrinal differences sep
arating members of the conserva
tive movement. . . . Conservatives
have more binding them together
than dividing them," he writes.
Unlike Tyrrell's study of the
flaws of liberalism, this book in
cludes personal anecdotes that he

tries to use to illustrate specific
points. Unfortunately, they often
don't work.
The reader is left wondering
why Tyrrell spends such a large
portion of the book describing
trips to places like Italy and Eng
land, often going into elaborate
detail.
Docs the average person really
care about foreigners' influences
on Tyrrell's conservatism, such as

the English conservative Malcolm
Muggeridgc? The answer is often
"no."
The anecdotes about meetings
with Ronald Reagan and other
leading American conservatives
are enlightening and entertaining,
however, particularly because
Tyrrell brings his own unique per
spective to the meetings.
Tyrrell also wields his book as a
tool of revenge, taking venomous
jabs at past enemies like Garry
Wills and George Will. The attacks
lead one to believe Tyrrell doesn't
want to miss an opportunity to
continue his battles, and they de
tract from the continuity of his
message.
Two things salvage Tyrrell's
book and his random stories — his
wit and his perceptive analysis of
the conservative part)'.
The apparently irrelevant pas
sages at least contain nuggets of
humor, and the book manages to
preserve some of his natural irrev
erence.
Tyrrell's book — completed
before this month's election —
contains usually accurate and
often astounding foresight.

Arguing that the election is
"the incumbent's to lose," he pre
views what George Bush had to do
— and did — to lose.
Many may disagree with
Tyrrell's assertion that Reagan was
the "most successful president"
since Franklin D. Roosevelt, but
his view is shared by many of
today's conservatives.
Of course, Tyrrell moans about
many of the common complaints
of conservatives, including the lib
eral media and the lack of conserv
ative representation in govern
ment.
They don't hurt the book, but
the reader occasionally gets the
distinct feeling that he is reading a
history that has been told before.
While not perfect, Tyrrell's
analysis is worth reading, particu
larly for those who want to under
stand the conservative mindset
and what shake-ups might occur
within the Republican party dur
ing the next four years. Tyrrell is
certainly influential within the
conservative ranks, and the book
provides at least a glimpse into the
thoughts of a leading conservative
critic. ■

speak his mind, and"The Conser
vative Crack-Up" is a no-holds
barrcd examination of the prob
lems plaguing the conservative
movement.
The problem with conserva
tives, according to Tyrrell, is their
"intrinsic disrelish for politics."

They simply don't care to be in
volved in campaigning, politicking
and the variety of other activities
associated with seeking govern
ment office.
"Conservatives are too much
given to the private, the familiar,
conventions unexamined and un
challenged. They arc only slowly
roused to public life," Tyrrell
writes. "When one analyzes con
servative and liberal leaders, one
notes a stark difference. Liberals
relish the public life and long for
public controversy; not many con
servatives do."
The thesis is an interesting one,
as Tyrrell downplays the media's
common explanations of the
downfall of conservatives, arguing
that the so-called split in the Re
publican part)' has been exaggerat
ed.
"Too much has always been
made of doctrinal differences sep
arating members of the conserva
tive movement. . . . Conservatives
have more binding them together
than dividing them," he writes.
Unlike Tyrrell's study of the
flaws of liberalism, this book in
cludes personal anecdotes that he

tries to use to illustrate specific
points. Unfortunately, they often
don't work.
The reader is left wondering
why Tyrrell spends such a large
portion of the book describing
trips to places like Italy and Eng
land, often going into elaborate
detail.
Docs the average person really
care about foreigners' influences
on Tyrrell's conservatism, such as

the English conservative Malcolm
Muggeridgc? The answer is often
"no."
The anecdotes about meetings
with Ronald Reagan and other
leading American conservatives
are enlightening and entertaining,
however, particularly because
Tyrrell brings his own unique per
spective to the meetings.
Tyrrell also wields his book as a
tool of revenge, taking venomous
jabs at past enemies like Garry
Wills and George Will. The attacks
lead one to believe Tyrrell doesn't
want to miss an opportunity to
continue his battles, and they de
tract from the continuity of his
message.
Two things salvage Tyrrell's
book and his random stories — his
wit and his perceptive analysis of
the conservative part)'.
The apparently irrelevant pas
sages at least contain nuggets of
humor, and the book manages to
preserve some of his natural irrev
erence.
Tyrrell's book — completed
before this month's election —
contains usually accurate and
often astounding foresight.

Arguing that the election is
"the incumbent's to lose," he pre
views what George Bush had to do
— and did — to lose.
Many may disagree with
Tyrrell's assertion that Reagan was
the "most successful president"
since Franklin D. Roosevelt, but
his view is shared by many of
today's conservatives.
Of course, Tyrrell moans about
many of the common complaints
of conservatives, including the lib
eral media and the lack of conserv
ative representation in govern
ment.
They don't hurt the book, but
the reader occasionally gets the
distinct feeling that he is reading a
history that has been told before.
While not perfect, Tyrrell's
analysis is worth reading, particu
larly for those who want to under
stand the conservative mindset
and what shake-ups might occur
within the Republican party dur
ing the next four years. Tyrrell is
certainly influential within the
conservative ranks, and the book
provides at least a glimpse into the
thoughts of a leading conservative
critic. ■
