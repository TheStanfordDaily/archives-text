# 'Reflection of a culture's soul'
## Native American teaches his language at Stanford 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Almost everyone at Stanford
has heard the traditional Sioux
language Lakota, if only during
"Dances with Wolves."
But to Calvin Fast Wolf, Lakota
is far more than just an authentic
touch in a hit movie. It is the lan
guage of his grandparents â€” a lan
guage that he is dedicated to keep
ing alive.
"The language of any people is
a reflection of soul in a culture,
and that's why I do what I do,"
said Fast Wolf.
As part of his quest, Fast Wolf
spends his time translating texts
and teaching others the language.
This year, Fast Wolf brought his
passion for the language to Stan
ford, where he is currently teach
ing beginning to a Linguis
tics class of 15. In the next two
quarters he will teach intermediate
and conversational Lakota.
"The most important thing is
that (the students) will get a true
picture of Lakota through the lan
guage instead of reading all sorts
of scurrilous materials by anthro
pologists," said Fast Wolf.
He pointed out that, in the past,
Native American languages have
been taught by whites who hold
misconceptions about the lan
guages' meanings.
Fast Wolfs relationship with
the language stems back to

his childhood, which he spent on a
reservation in South Dakota lis
tening to and speaking Lakota
with his grandparents.
"My grandmother was a sur
vivor of the Wounded Knee (mas
sacre), and she remembers. I was
told she had nightmares for years
after," he recalled. "She told me
how she grabbed her little brother
and ran downstream with him five
or six miles, as near as she could
figure, and hid. She could still
hear the women being slaugh
tered."
Wounded Knee was an 1890
massacre of a small band of Native
Americans in which women and
children were killed. Fast Wolf
said his grandmother was one of
only a few survivors.
"After that, she never did speak
English, and she never allowed
English to be spoken in her
home," he said.
Because of his grandparents,
Fast Wolf learned a traditional
form of Lakota.
"They were still speaking the
very old Lakota of the Plains from
before they were interned on the
reservations. I would hear the old
stories, the old legends, every
thing in the old language.
"When I first went to school, I
knew only about a dozen words in
English," said Fast Wolf. "English
is a very funny language. It is
