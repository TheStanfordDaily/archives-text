Dinotopia: A Ijind Apart From Time
by James Gurncy (Turner Publishing,
529.95)
Imagine a society where dinosaurs not
only still exist, but cohabit in harmony with
humans, to the point of raising each other's
young.
That's the fanciful idea author and
artist James Gurncy attempts to pursue in
his illustrated book "Dinotopia: A Land
Apart From Time." But his clever concept
regrettably falls flat.
In "Dinotopia," Prof. Arthur Dcnison
and his son William are shipwrecked and
brought by dolphins to the island of Dino
topia, where dinosaurs and humans — all
castaways or descendants of castaways —
live and work together.
Presented as the stumbled-upon sketch
book of Prof. Denison, the book depicts the
ways of the near-Utopian society and the
Denisons' assimilation into it. Gurney's col
orful illustrations of the island's people,
places, events and wildlife comprise the bulk
of the book, complemented by Dcnison's
fictional text.
With dozens of difficult Latin dinosaur
names — all, Gurney claims, arc actual di
nosaurs — sprinkled throughout, it's critical
that the text flow smoothly. However, Gur
ncy's overly formal and wordy sentences
hamper the book's fluidity.
By making Denison a 19th-century sci
ence professor, Gurncy renders the prose
stilted and lifeless. Dcnison's articulation of

his amazement suffers from the restraints of
his occupation and era.
Even when the story is temporarily
passed to William, Gurncy is unabjc to
break out of the stodgy writing style.
It's unclear for what audience "Dino
topia" is written, since the writing is clearly
above most children's abilities, even when
read aloud by an adult. At 160 pages — al
beit brimming with large, colorful illustra
tions — the book taxes the attention span
regardless of age.
Gurney's fanciful drawings — depicting
dinosaurs playing with children, operating
the unusual machines of the society and
working in conjunction with their human
partners — could possibly have been the
saving grace of the book, since over half the
pages arc devoted to the artwork supposed
ly sketched by Denison.
At first glance, the large, colorful, fanci
ful pictures make the book attractive and
inviting. And to Gurney's crcdit, his depic
tions of the human/saur society provide
great clarification to the text.
But the sumptuous beauty and detail of a
handful of full- or two-page illustrations
merely accentuates the flat, sketchy nature
of most of the drawings, especially those di
agraming plant life or mechanical devices.
Of course, the book's pretense of being a
professor's sketchbook partially justifies
that choice; yet the breathtaking nature of
just a few of the pictures makes the reader
wish more time had been spent on the rest
of them.
Also, both the dinosaurs and the humans
lack the expressiveness that would allow the
reader to connect with them, especially be-

cause the text never develops any
characters of substance.
To a dinosaur aficionado,
"Dinotopia" might be an en
thralling read, simply because Gur
ncy has managed to take actual di
nosaurs and use their physical char
acteristics to develop traits and work
roles particularly suited to them.
The three-toed Ornithomimus, for
example, serves as a scribe of the di
nosaurs' footprint alphabet because
of the clarity of its tracks.
Indeed, the one strength of
"Dinotopia" is the detail with
which Gurney has enriched his fic
tional land. Not only is the
macrosocicty of humans and di
nosaurs depicted as being similar
to, yet spiritually different from the
Denisons' original culture, but sev
eral microsocieties — including a
Tibet-like mountain city and a
tree-dwelling tribe — are scattered
throughout.
When Gurney expands on
Dinotopian society, the results arc
frequently entrancing, such as
when Will and his friend Sylvia
compete in a dinosaur race and ring
catch at the Dinosaur Olympics.

But the reader is left wanting more.
When Denison ventures into the cavernous
underworld of Dinotopia, we hear nothing
about what he encounters. Bits and pieces
of detail are tossed out — there's even a
Dinotopian song, complete with score —
but rarely is anything fully fleshed out.
Bccausc of its imaginative and fantastic

premise, "Dinotopia" certainly isn't a waste
of time. The sketchbook format is a good
idea, allowing the reader to better relate to
the narrator's experience. Unfortunately,
Gurney fails to follow through on the
promise of a great journey to "a land apart
from time." Better to seek out his fine art
prints, which presumably achieve the high
level of quality glimpsed in "Dinotopia." ■

nosaurs and use their physical char
acteristics to develop traits and work
roles particularly suited to them.
The three-toed Ornithomimus, for
example, serves as a scribe of the di

Indeed, the one strength of
"Dinotopia" is the detail with

macrosocicty of humans and di

Tibet-like mountain city and a

When Gurney expands on
Dinotopian society, the results arc
frequently entrancing, such as
when Will and his friend Sylvia
compete in a dinosaur race and ring

But the reader is left wanting more.
When Denison ventures into the cavernous
underworld of Dinotopia, we hear nothing
about what he encounters. Bits and pieces
of detail are tossed out — there's even a
Dinotopian song, complete with score —
but rarely is anything fully fleshed out.
Bccausc of its imaginative and fantastic

premise, "Dinotopia" certainly isn't a waste
of time. The sketchbook format is a good
idea, allowing the reader to better relate to
the narrator's experience. Unfortunately,
Gurney fails to follow through on the
promise of a great journey to "a land apart

Dinotopia: A Ijind Apart From Time
by James Gurncy (Turner Publishing,
529.95)
Imagine a society where dinosaurs not
only still exist, but cohabit in harmony with
humans, to the point of raising each other's
young.
That's the fanciful idea author and
artist James Gurncy attempts to pursue in
his illustrated book "Dinotopia: A Land
Apart From Time." But his clever concept
regrettably falls flat.
In "Dinotopia," Prof. Arthur Dcnison
and his son William are shipwrecked and
brought by dolphins to the island of Dino
topia, where dinosaurs and humans — all
castaways or descendants of castaways —
live and work together.
Presented as the stumbled-upon sketch
book of Prof. Denison, the book depicts the
ways of the near-Utopian society and the
Denisons' assimilation into it. Gurney's col
orful illustrations of the island's people,
places, events and wildlife comprise the bulk
of the book, complemented by Dcnison's
fictional text.
With dozens of difficult Latin dinosaur
names — all, Gurney claims, arc actual di
nosaurs — sprinkled throughout, it's critical
that the text flow smoothly. However, Gur
ncy's overly formal and wordy sentences
hamper the book's fluidity.
By making Denison a 19th-century sci
ence professor, Gurncy renders the prose
stilted and lifeless. Dcnison's articulation of

his amazement suffers from the restraints of
his occupation and era.
Even when the story is temporarily
passed to William, Gurncy is unabjc to
break out of the stodgy writing style.
It's unclear for what audience "Dino
topia" is written, since the writing is clearly
above most children's abilities, even when
read aloud by an adult. At 160 pages — al
beit brimming with large, colorful illustra
tions — the book taxes the attention span
regardless of age.
Gurney's fanciful drawings — depicting
dinosaurs playing with children, operating
the unusual machines of the society and
working in conjunction with their human
partners — could possibly have been the
saving grace of the book, since over half the
pages arc devoted to the artwork supposed
ly sketched by Denison.
At first glance, the large, colorful, fanci
ful pictures make the book attractive and
inviting. And to Gurney's crcdit, his depic
tions of the human/saur society provide
great clarification to the text.
But the sumptuous beauty and detail of a
handful of full- or two-page illustrations
merely accentuates the flat, sketchy nature
of most of the drawings, especially those di
agraming plant life or mechanical devices.
Of course, the book's pretense of being a
professor's sketchbook partially justifies
that choice; yet the breathtaking nature of
just a few of the pictures makes the reader
wish more time had been spent on the rest
of them.
Also, both the dinosaurs and the humans
lack the expressiveness that would allow the
reader to connect with them, especially be-

cause the text never develops any
characters of substance.
To a dinosaur aficionado,
"Dinotopia" might be an en
thralling read, simply because Gur
ncy has managed to take actual di
nosaurs and use their physical char
acteristics to develop traits and work
roles particularly suited to them.
