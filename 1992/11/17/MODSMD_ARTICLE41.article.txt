The Total Triathlon Handbook
by Tony Svensson (Trimarket Co.,
S 16.95)
If the title, "The Total Triathlon
Handbook" isn't intimidating enough,
the work's subtide, "A Training Tool
and Information Source for the Serious
Triathlete and Duathlete," ends any
doubt as to its ultra-intense nature.
Right? Wrong, said author Tony
Svensson.
"In some sense, the term 'serious* is a
misnomer," he said. Svensson said he
wrote The Total Triathlon Handbook
for everyone interested in staying fit.
"You don't have to be a serious athlete
to get a lot out of it."
You do have to be a serious athlete,
however, to appreciate the handbook's
unique format. While the text of the
work flows on the even-numbered
pages, each of the odd-numbered pages
contains a week-long log on which the
reader can record his or her daily train
ing progress.
For Svensson, himself a serious triath
lete for almost a decade, this duality
makes the handbook particularly suc-

cessful. "I've been training pretty much
all of my life,' said the 39-year old au
thor, "and I've always felt that I needed
something like this. There was no log
[before the handbook] that combined
record-keeping with training and racing
information."
More importantly, the handbook is
compact. "When I was traveling, I
would have to bring a library with me to
have all of the information that I want
ed," Svensson said. Indeed, in the
book's preface, the author characterizes
his work as "a lightweight and 'pared
down to the bones' traveling compan
ion."
Despite its specialized structure, the
handbook eaters to the interests of even
the most casual athlete in a well-orga
nized and insightful manner.
Svensson separated the text of the
work into three neat sections. The first,
appropriately titled "Training Hand
book," contains conditioning tips and
strategies recommended and utilized by
Svensson in each of the three disciplines
of the event — swimming, cycling and
running.
In the handbook, the author discuss
es his personally devised three-phase
plan for competitors to follow on the
road to becoming triathletes. For phase

one, competitors follow a low-stress reg
imen for a training period that can last
anywhere from four weeks to a year.
More than anything else, phase-one
training is designed to familiarize the
athlete with the three events. According
to Svensson, this process yields different
results in different sports.
While swimmers "develop an even
pace and get a feel for the rhythm of the
freestyle stroke," the primary aim of the
phase one cyclist is to "get your body
used to the bicycles and to cycling," he
said. Running, the "least complicated"
and the "most difficult" of the three
sports, has a completely different aim:
"First, you must enjoy the experience,"
he added.
In phases two and three, Svensson di
rects his writing towards serious triath
letes. The workouts in this part of the
book arc intensified and specialized —
the author lays out specific time, dis
tance and repetition guidelines for each
of the three triathlon sports.
Svensson's own advice becomes more
technical in these sections as well. Jar
gon such as M VO2 Max Interval Train
ing" and "AT Interval Training" give
these sections the feel of a medical jour
nal.
Here, more than anywhere else, one

gets a sense of the intensity of serious
triathlcte training; accordingly, the non
serious competitor might find these parts
of the handbook intimidating.
In general, though, Svensson avoids
alienating any readers through the
overuse of such technical jargon. His
writing style, like the structure of the
book itself, is compact and highly-orga
nized. When writing of dietary intake,
for instance, he describes successful
sports diets and gives a simple caloric
breakdown of smart
carbohydrate/fat/protein intake in the
matter of a few lines.
Svensson also incorporates advice and
pointers from professional triathlctes
that are helpful to athletes at any level.
While the author takes an in-depth look
at three-time Hawaii Ironman champion
Dave Scott's daily regimen, his descrip
tions of Scott's pre race "conversation
with his body parts" would interest even
the most non-athletic reader.
"The Total Triathlcte Handbook" is
Svcnsson's first published work; if it
proves to be a success, the Palo Alto resi
dent plans on writing a new handbook
every year. And if non-triathlctes look
beyond the tide of the book, then Svens
son might well achieve the success that
he desires. ■
