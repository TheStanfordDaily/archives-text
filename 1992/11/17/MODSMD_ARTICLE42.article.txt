The Road to Hell
i by Matt Groening
(HarpcrPcrennial, $8.00)

Rabbits and fezzes and
Bongo, oh my — what

frightening things you can find

lying by the side of Matt Groen
ing's yellow brick "Road To
Hell."

Just make sure that if you
die laughing — which is quite
likely — you don't end up in Hell.

1 Compared to Groening's
classic tomes "Childhood Is Hell," "Work
Is Hell" and "Love Is Hell," this edition
feels a little less substantial; its predecessors
were filled mainly with densely packed car
toons. However, Groening excels at both
simplicity and detail in this compilation of
46 of his most recent cartoons.
Akbar and Jeff — Groening's running
commentary on the state of today's rela
tionships — dominates this installment with
their fez-adorned love-hate banter.
They fight, they bicker, they often can't
stand being around each other, they're
afraid of commitment and somehow
they still love each other. Really.

In one instance,
Akbar — or maybe
it's Jeff, only they can
tell each other apart —
asks Jcffif he still loves
him, saying he
y "desperately needs
* to be reassured."

Jeff doesn't respond.
"An affectionate word or two is all I'm
looking for. . . . I'm reaching out to you in
complete, naked vulnerability," Akbar says.
No response.
"My entire life is in your hands. . . . I'm
going to do something dramatic and self
destructive. I'm going to kill myself."
Still no response.
"Before I die, I'm going to shoot you
first," Akbar says.
"Are you crazy?" Jeff responds at last.
"Of course I still love you."
In almost all their appearances, they're
afraid to show their love without couching
it in insults. We see each throwing knives at
a picture of the other, saying, "Not many re
lationships could withstand this kind of
honesty."

"I want more
appreciation," Jeff later
_ says to a stoic Akbar.

j - —- - —
"I want more respect.
I want more lust. I

want more tender
ness. I want more

praise. I want more inti

macy. I want more ice cream."
So Akbar hands Jeff some ice

cream.
However, when they let down their de
fenses, their relationship can be touching
and sweet. But not too sweet, mind you.
After all, this is Matt Grocning. To wit:
"Would you still love me if I tested posi
tive?" Akbar asks.
"Maybe," Jeff responds. "Would you
still love me if I tested positive?"
"Maybe."
They stare at each other for seven panels,

and in the final panel, they touch index fin
gers.
Like Doonesbury creator Garry
Trudeau, a reader gets the impression that if
Groening weren't venting his political and
social frustrations through pen and ink,
he'd be out on the streets protesting.
Even though Groening's television cre
ation, "The Simpsons," has catapulted him
into mainstream success, he's maintained an
anti-establishment sense of humor. Al
though he's worked and reworked some of
his comic formulas a little too often, he
hasn't demonstrated that he's getting too
comfortable. He's still the L.A. Weekly
cynic taking digs at the powers-that-bc.
One-eared Bongo, Groening's young
starring rabbit, stands up in class to recite the
Pledge of Allegiance, and says,"I pledge im
pertinence to the flag-waving of the unin
dicted co-conspirators of America, and to
the Republicans for which I can't stand, one
abomination, underhanded fraud, indefen
sible, with liberty and justice forget it."
Later, bound

and gagged in his
i cell, he's told by
his captors, "The

Supreme Court is very

r j
disappointed you've
been informing
poor women that

abortion is legal."
Bongo bears a torch for

America's non-conformists, akin to Bloom
County's Opus the Penguin.
Teachers who arc angry that he's chal
lenged their authority or the orthodoxy of
traditional education techniques regularly
tic him up. Just as regularly, parents and

authority fig- >
ures intent on
turning him into
a Nice Little
throw him into
a windowless
room and eye
ball him through
a tiny door slit.
In one "j
episode, dis -

gruntled Bongo sits alone in the cell —
which is covered with smiley faces — and his
captors say, "You haven't told us how you
like your new therapeutic wallpaper."
He's the child of the '90s: cynical, not
easily duped and a lot more aware of the
world than the average Baby Boomer
decades ago.
An angry Bongo walks into a living room
filled with Christmas gifts, while his anxious
single-father Binky awaits his reaction. "I
suppose you think this will buy my affec
tion," Bongo says.
Like Calvin and Hobbes creator Bill Pat
terson, Groening effectively captures youth
and all its insecurities. The book ends, ap
propriately enough, with Bongo contem
plating death.
"If people started laughing during your
funeral, would you just

have to lie there and take
it?" he ponders. "How
soon would heaven start get
ting boring?"

The Road to Hell
i by Matt Groening
(HarpcrPcrennial, $8.00)

Rabbits and fezzes and
Bongo, oh my — what

frightening things you can find

lying by the side of Matt Groen
ing's yellow brick "Road To
Hell."

Just make sure that if you
die laughing — which is quite
likely — you don't end up in Hell.

1 Compared to Groening's
classic tomes "Childhood Is Hell," "Work
Is Hell" and "Love Is Hell," this edition
feels a little less substantial; its predecessors
were filled mainly with densely packed car
toons. However, Groening excels at both
simplicity and detail in this compilation of
46 of his most recent cartoons.
Akbar and Jeff — Groening's running
commentary on the state of today's rela
tionships — dominates this installment with
their fez-adorned love-hate banter.
They fight, they bicker, they often can't
stand being around each other, they're
afraid of commitment and somehow
they still love each other. Really.

In one instance,
Akbar — or maybe
it's Jeff, only they can
tell each other apart —
asks Jcffif he still loves
him, saying he
y "desperately needs
* to be reassured."

Jeff doesn't respond.
"An affectionate word or two is all I'm
looking for. . . . I'm reaching out to you in
complete, naked vulnerability," Akbar says.
No response.
"My entire life is in your hands. . . . I'm
going to do something dramatic and self
destructive. I'm going to kill myself."
Still no response.
"Before I die, I'm going to shoot you
first," Akbar says.
"Are you crazy?" Jeff responds at last.
"Of course I still love you."
In almost all their appearances, they're
afraid to show their love without couching
it in insults. We see each throwing knives at
a picture of the other, saying, "Not many re
lationships could withstand this kind of
honesty."

"I want more
appreciation," Jeff later
_ says to a stoic Akbar.

j - —- - —
"I want more respect.
I want more lust. I

want more tender
ness. I want more

praise. I want more inti

macy. I want more ice cream."
So Akbar hands Jeff some ice

cream.
However, when they let down their de
fenses, their relationship can be touching
and sweet. But not too sweet, mind you.
After all, this is Matt Grocning. To wit:
"Would you still love me if I tested posi
tive?" Akbar asks.
"Maybe," Jeff responds. "Would you
still love me if I tested positive?"
"Maybe."
They stare at each other for seven panels,

and in the final panel, they touch index fin
gers.
Like Doonesbury creator Garry
Trudeau, a reader gets the impression that if
Groening weren't venting his political and
social frustrations through pen and ink,
he'd be out on the streets protesting.
Even though Groening's television cre
ation, "The Simpsons," has catapulted him
