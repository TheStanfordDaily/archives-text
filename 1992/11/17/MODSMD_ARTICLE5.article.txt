# ASSU to determine fate of sound system
## 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate will decide
the fate of the proposed Memorial
Auditorium sound system tonight
when it votes on whether to loan
$90,000 to Sunday Flicks to subsi
dize the system's installation.
The senate will also vote on a
bill to terminate Friday Classic
Flicks, which began last year. The
program has lost about $13,000,
according to ASSU estimates, and
draws an audience of about 100
each week.
The bill for the sound system,
which requires a two-thirds ma
jority for approval, would allocate
the $90,000 from ASSU reserves,
which are currently estimated to
be between $400,000 and
$500,000.
The loan would be repaid over

the next five years, at a 10 percent
annual rate, through an elaborate
cost-recovery plan.
The yearly payments would be
$23,900, partially generated by a
$1.50 surcharge per quarterly
Flicks pass, a $.20 surcharge per
Flicks ticket, and a $10 per hour
usage surcharge to be collected
from University Events and Ser
vices for the next six years.
The University may not ap
prove the $10 surcharge and may
come up with a cost-recovery plan
of its own, according to graduate
senator Sanford Dickert, who co
authored the bill.
Dickert said a group of students
working on the project has met
with University officials about the
sound system proposal and will re
lease their portion of the cost re

covery plan today. Dickert said
there is a good possibility it will
not include the $10 surcharge.
The ticket surcharges will like
ly yield $9,000 per year and the
$10 usage surcharge will generate
an estimated $3,500 per year. The
remaining $11,400 a year would
essentially be taken from the
ASSU operating budget and used
to repay the loan.
To compensate for this loss
in its operating budget, the
ASSU would allocate $11,400 a
year from its reserves to be
added to the operating budget.
All loan payments would be
deposited into ASSU endowable
reserves.
If approved, the system would
be installed by Black Boxes, Inc.,
according to the proposal. The

Black Boxes proposal, which will
use Apogee Sound components,
was chosen over a plan from Pro-
Media.
Dickert said Black Boxes was
chosen over Pro Media based on
recommendations of sound tech
nicians and on the results of a
sound "shootout" on Oct. 26.
The system would include
three clusters of speakers and a
fourth Dolby Surround Sound
channel. However, to cut costs,
the system would not include a
decorative scrim for the front
speakers and sound treatment
materials as originally proposed
by Black Boxes.
The bill includes a clause
which states that the bill cannot
take effect unless the $10 sur
charge is imposed and Events and
Services and the University
agrees that maintenance costs
will not increase for five years.
The system would be owned by
Events and Services.
