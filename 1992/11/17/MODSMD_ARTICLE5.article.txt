### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate will decide
the fate of the proposed Memorial
Auditorium sound system tonight
when it votes on whether to loan
$90,000 to Sunday Flicks to subsi

The senate will also vote on a
bill to terminate Friday Classic
Flicks, which began last year. The
program has lost about $13,000,
according to ASSU estimates, and
draws an audience of about 100
each week.
The bill for the sound system,
which requires a two-thirds ma
jority for approval, would allocate
the $90,000 from ASSU reserves,
which are currently estimated to
be between $400,000 and
$500,000.
The loan would be repaid over

the next five years, at a 10 percent
annual rate, through an elaborate
cost-recovery plan.
The yearly payments would be
$23,900, partially generated by a
$1.50 surcharge per quarterly
Flicks pass, a $.20 surcharge per
Flicks ticket, and a $10 per hour
usage surcharge to be collected
from University Events and Ser
vices for the next six years.
The University may not ap
prove the $10 surcharge and may
come up with a cost-recovery plan
of its own, according to graduate
senator Sanford Dickert, who co
authored the bill.
Dickert said a group of students
working on the project has met
with University officials about the
sound system proposal and will re
lease their portion of the cost re
