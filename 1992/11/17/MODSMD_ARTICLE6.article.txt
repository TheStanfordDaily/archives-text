# University launches search for registrar
## New administrator will start next year 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
The University has begun a na
tionwide search for a permanent
registrar, and the Office of Stu
dent Affairs has placed advertise
ments for the position in education
publications across the country.
Acting Registrar Jack Farrell
said yesterday he will apply for the
position. He has held his current
position for the past two and a half
years.
The new registrar will likely
begin working next year, accord
ing to Mary Edmonds, vice provost
and dean of student affairs.
"We'd like to get [the new regis
trar] in as soon as possible," Ed
monds said. She anticipated that if
the search committee is still re
ceiving applications in January,

the new registrar will not start
until next September.
The registrar oversees the reg
istrar's office, which registers stu
dents, issues ID cards, posts
grades, schedules classes and pub
lishes the time schedule and
Courses and Degrees.
Because the office just began
publicizing the opening last week,
Edmonds said she has not yet se
lected the members of the search
committee.
She said she will have the com
mittee picked by January, adding
that there is "no big urgency" be
cause the selection process will not
begin until "well into January or
February."
The search committee will then
"whittle [the applicant pool] down
to a reasonable number,"
Edmonds said. "I'll make the ulti
mate decision," she said. The reg
istrar reports directly to her.
Edmonds, who joined the Uni
versity in March, has not made
any plans beyond a general out

line of the search process.
"The job's just opened up,"
said Bobbrie Brown, personnel
manager in the Office of Student
Affairs. "We're working on it."
Brown would not say how
many people have already applied
for the job.
The registrar post was vacated
in 1990, when Sally Mahoney left
to become acting vice president
for student resources.

Farrell, then the assistant reg
istrar, became the acting registrar
for an indefinite period. "I've been
living with ambiguity," he joked.
If Farrell is not selected to be
registrar, he said will likely revert
back to being the associate regis
trar.
Mahoney, who is now senior
associate provost while attending
classes at the Graduate School of
Business, said yesterday that she

has not seen the advertisements
but has "no plans" to apply for
the position again.
Mahoney had sought the per
manent position of vice president
for student resources but was
passed over in favor of Edmonds.
The position was renamed vice
provost of student affairs during
University President Gerhard
Casper's administrative shake-up
earlier this year.
