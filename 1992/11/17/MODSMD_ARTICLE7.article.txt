# Sand Hill link approval requested
## Stanford wants 'conceptual approval' from Palo Alto 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
The University has asked the City of Palo Alto
to make an "early decision" on Stanford's latest
proposal to extend Sand Hill Road, Director of
Community Affairs Andy Doty said yesterday.
Doty said the University is asking the city to
give "conceptual approval" to the $9 million pro
ject before Stanford begins spending money on
preliminary planning of the extension.
The proposal, the most recent in a long and
heretofore futile string of attempts to extend Sand
Hill Road, calls for a four-lane extension of the
road and a 140,000-square foot expansion of the
Stanford Shopping Center.
The University wants Palo Alto to contribute
$2.1 million to the cost of the project, claiming the
city will benefit from increased sales tax revenue
from new stores.
Sand Hill Road begins four miles southwest of

Stanford near Interstate 280 and meanders to an
end in the shopping center parking lot, a short dis
tance from El Camino Real The University hopes
to link the road to El Camino Real.

The project still faces stern
opposition from environmental
groups and traffic-wary citizens.

"What we're looking for from the city is a nod of
the head," Doty said. "They can still retain the
right to withdraw approval of the project."
Doty said the University needs the city's ap
proval as well as financial support to complete the
project. "Stanford alone can not bear the full coat
of the road extension," he said.
