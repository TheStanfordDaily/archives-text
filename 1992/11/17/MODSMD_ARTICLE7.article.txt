# Sand Hill link approval requested
## Stanford wants 'conceptual approval' from Palo Alto 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
The University has asked the City of Palo Alto
to make an "early decision" on Stanford's latest
proposal to extend Sand Hill Road, Director of
Community Affairs Andy Doty said yesterday.
Doty said the University is asking the city to
give "conceptual approval" to the $9 million pro
ject before Stanford begins spending money on
preliminary planning of the extension.
The proposal, the most recent in a long and
heretofore futile string of attempts to extend Sand
Hill Road, calls for a four-lane extension of the
road and a 140,000-square foot expansion of the
Stanford Shopping Center.
The University wants Palo Alto to contribute
$2.1 million to the cost of the project, claiming the
city will benefit from increased sales tax revenue
from new stores.
Sand Hill Road begins four miles southwest of

Stanford near Interstate 280 and meanders to an
end in the shopping center parking lot, a short dis
tance from El Camino Real The University hopes
to link the road to El Camino Real.

The project still faces stern
opposition from environmental
groups and traffic-wary citizens.

"What we're looking for from the city is a nod of
the head," Doty said. "They can still retain the
right to withdraw approval of the project."
Doty said the University needs the city's ap
proval as well as financial support to complete the
project. "Stanford alone can not bear the full coat
of the road extension," he said.

Palo Alto's Director of Plan
ning Ken Schreiber said any pre
liminary approval by the city will
be simply a tacit agreement to
help fund the project once all
studies of the extension's impacts
are complete.
The Palo Alto City Council and
Planning Commission have
scheduled a joint briefing session
on the extension for Dec. 7. The
council will be asked to give a pre
liminary green light to the pro
posal in late December or Jan
uary, Schreiber said.
However, the project still faces
stern opposition from environ
mental groups and traffic-wary
citizens.
Enid Pearson of the Palo Alto
organization Committee for
Green Foothills called the Univer
sity's request for early approval of
the proposal — before any envi
ronmental impact reports are
made — "an insult."
"Stanford is using its land to
make more money and become
the biggest land developer in
Santa Clara County," she said.
"As a university, it should be an
example to the rest of the world
on land use, but it isn't at all."
Pearson said she plans to lobby
the city council on the extension's
potentially harmful effect on San
Francisquito Creek and its impact
on traffic congestion on El
Camino Real and Santa Cruz
Avenue.
In addition, Pearson claims the
extension of the shopping center
will not bring increased revenue
to the city.

"There's a worldwide recession
going on," she said. "Why does
Stanford think the recession
won't affect them? They're kid
ding themselves if they think that
just by adding more square
footage, they will make more
money."
But Doty estimated that the
city would recover its portion of
the project's cost within three
years of its completion.
Palo Alto Mayor Gary Fazzino
said that any discussion of an
extension of Sand Hill Road
should be linked to a renegotia
tion of the city's lease of El
Camino Park from Stanford.
The park, located across from
the shopping center, includes
property occupied by Mac Arthur
Park restaurant and the Ameri
can Red Cross.
Fazzino contends that the city
cannot afford to pay the $700,000
annual rent on the park, but Doty
said that the city recovers all but
$60,000 of that cost by leasing
portions of the park to other
groups.
Because a portion of the pro
posed four-lane expansion of
Sand Hill will run through Menlo
Park, the project will require
approval from the Menlo Park
city council, too.
If Menlo Park does not approve
the expansion, the University will
simply leave that city's portion of
the road at its current two-lane
size, Doty said.
However, Doty believes the
city will be receptive to the expan
sion idea. "Our past studies have
shown that 83 percent of Menlo
Park residents approve of the
road's expansion," he said.

preliminary planning of the extension.
The proposal, the most recent in a long and
heretofore futile string of attempts to extend Sand
Hill Road, calls for a four-lane extension of the
road and a 140,000-square foot expansion of the
Stanford Shopping Center.
The University wants Palo Alto to contribute
$2.1 million to the cost of the project, claiming the
city will benefit from increased sales tax revenue
from new stores.
Sand Hill Road begins four miles southwest of

Stanford near Interstate 280 and meanders to an
end in the shopping center parking lot, a short dis
tance from El Camino Real The University hopes
to link the road to El Camino Real.

The project still faces stern
opposition from environmental
groups and traffic-wary citizens.

"What we're looking for from the city is a nod of
the head," Doty said. "They can still retain the
right to withdraw approval of the project."
Doty said the University needs the city's ap
proval as well as financial support to complete the
project. "Stanford alone can not bear the full coat
of the road extension," he said.

Palo Alto's Director of Plan
ning Ken Schreiber said any pre
liminary approval by the city will
be simply a tacit agreement to
help fund the project once all
studies of the extension's impacts
are complete.
The Palo Alto City Council and
Planning Commission have
scheduled a joint briefing session
on the extension for Dec. 7. The
council will be asked to give a pre
liminary green light to the pro
posal in late December or Jan
uary, Schreiber said.
However, the project still faces
stern opposition from environ
mental groups and traffic-wary
citizens.
Enid Pearson of the Palo Alto
organization Committee for
Green Foothills called the Univer
sity's request for early approval of
the proposal — before any envi
ronmental impact reports are
made — "an insult."
"Stanford is using its land to
make more money and become
the biggest land developer in
Santa Clara County," she said.
"As a university, it should be an
example to the rest of the world
on land use, but it isn't at all."
Pearson said she plans to lobby
the city council on the extension's
potentially harmful effect on San
Francisquito Creek and its impact
on traffic congestion on El
Camino Real and Santa Cruz
Avenue.
In addition, Pearson claims the
extension of the shopping center
will not bring increased revenue
to the city.

"There's a worldwide recession
going on," she said. "Why does
Stanford think the recession
won't affect them? They're kid
ding themselves if they think that
just by adding more square
footage, they will make more
money."
But Doty estimated that the
city would recover its portion of
the project's cost within three
years of its completion.
Palo Alto Mayor Gary Fazzino
said that any discussion of an
extension of Sand Hill Road
should be linked to a renegotia
tion of the city's lease of El
Camino Park from Stanford.
The park, located across from
the shopping center, includes
property occupied by Mac Arthur
Park restaurant and the Ameri
can Red Cross.
Fazzino contends that the city
cannot afford to pay the $700,000
annual rent on the park, but Doty
said that the city recovers all but
$60,000 of that cost by leasing
portions of the park to other
groups.
Because a portion of the pro
posed four-lane expansion of
Sand Hill will run through Menlo
Park, the project will require
approval from the Menlo Park
city council, too.
If Menlo Park does not approve
the expansion, the University will
simply leave that city's portion of
the road at its current two-lane
size, Doty said.
However, Doty believes the
city will be receptive to the expan
sion idea. "Our past studies have
shown that 83 percent of Menlo
Park residents approve of the
road's expansion," he said.
