Make enemies
out of total
strangers.
A forceful opinion piece can make
you enemies, friends & fans
A weak one will only be read by your mother.
Knight Fellow Eugene Kane,
a columnist for the Milwaukee Journal,
will speak to Daily staffers
about writing good columns
for audiences greater than one.
12:15 tomorrow. At The Daily. Don't miss it.
