THE THIRD THURSDAY OF NOVEMBER
"He said he didn't inhale"
If you want to be like president-elect Clinton, there's no point in
smoking if you're not going to inhale.
That will be one of the light hearted messages tomorrow as we celebrate
the 16th annual "Great American Smokeout", sponsored in part by the
American Cancer Society to encourage people to stop smoking. Smokers are
encouraged to give up the habit for the day in the hope that they will quit
permanently.
For the second year, the Health Improvement Program and Cowell
Student Health Center are coordinating an effort to help members of the
Stanford community give up smoking. At Stanford, it is estimated that about
15 percent of the faculty and 10 percent of the students smoke.
The American Cancer Society reports that about 25 percent of people
quit permanently after quitting for the one-day Smokeout. Because most
people attempt to quit smoking eight to ten times before they succeed, the
annual Smokeout serves as a regular reminder to try to stop smoking.
Some of the scheduled events and available features include:
■ A free smoking cessation program began on Thursday, November 12,
1992. For more information call the HIP at 725-4406.
■ Free "Quit Kits" are available at Cowell Student Health Center Room 233,
the Office of Student Activities in Tresidder Union and HIP at 1000
Welch Road. The kits include light hearted literature, and treats to serve
as substitutes for cigarettes, such as: cinnamon sticks, chewing gum,
rubber bands, paper clips, and stickers.
■ Free "Adopt-A-Smoker Kits" are for friends of smokers and include
"adoption papers" and tips on helping friends to quit.
■ Everyone who participates will be eligible to enter into a raffle. The grand
prize will be a "cold turkey" for an upcoming holiday dinner.
■ For more information, call Kristl Chang at 723-0821, Room 233 Cowell
Student Health Center.
