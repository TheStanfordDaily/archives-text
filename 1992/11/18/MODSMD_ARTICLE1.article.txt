## Discovery may help detection

Three Stanford researchers
have gained new insight into how
certain types of leukemia operate,
a step of understanding that may
someday help in detecting the dis
ease
In the Nov. 13 issue of the jour
nal "Cell," the team of Stanford
Medical Center investigators re
ported discovering "a gene that is
found in chromosome break
points in predominantly child
hood leukemia," said team mem
ber Douglas Tkachuk.
The finding is relevant to the
acute, or rapid-spreading,
leukemias that commonly affect
children and patients recovering
from treatments for lymphatic
cancers.
A chromosome breakpoint is
an area where a gene breaks, split
ting one chromosome, and attach
es to another chromosome. The
Stanford team found that just
such a break and re-fusion of a
gene — involving a gene called
HRX, or the human trithorax
gene — is the common denomina
tor in some types of acute
leukemias.
"This new fusion gene gives
cells a growth advantage" that in
turn helps the formation of
leukemia, said Tkachuk, a post
doctoral scholar in the Pathology
Department.
According to Sabine Kohler, a
resident in pathology at the Med
ical Center, it is too early to tell if
the break itself actually causes
leukemia. Kohler, along with
Tkachuk and pathology associate
Prof. Michael Cleary, researched
the HRX gene.
"For the time being, it's basical
ly helping to define the disease and
get more of an idea of why people
get leukemia," she said. "But
hopefully it is a causative mecha
nism" of leukemia, she added,
something further research could
