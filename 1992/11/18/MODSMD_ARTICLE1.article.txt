# Cancer insight
## Discovery may help detection 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Three Stanford researchers
have gained new insight into how
certain types of leukemia operate,
a step of understanding that may
someday help in detecting the dis
ease
In the Nov. 13 issue of the jour
nal "Cell," the team of Stanford
Medical Center investigators re
ported discovering "a gene that is
found in chromosome break
points in predominantly child
hood leukemia," said team mem
ber Douglas Tkachuk.
The finding is relevant to the
acute, or rapid-spreading,
leukemias that commonly affect
children and patients recovering
from treatments for lymphatic
cancers.
A chromosome breakpoint is
an area where a gene breaks, split
ting one chromosome, and attach
es to another chromosome. The
Stanford team found that just
such a break and re-fusion of a
gene — involving a gene called
HRX, or the human trithorax
gene — is the common denomina
tor in some types of acute
leukemias.
"This new fusion gene gives
cells a growth advantage" that in
turn helps the formation of
leukemia, said Tkachuk, a post
doctoral scholar in the Pathology
Department.
According to Sabine Kohler, a
resident in pathology at the Med
ical Center, it is too early to tell if
the break itself actually causes
leukemia. Kohler, along with
Tkachuk and pathology associate
Prof. Michael Cleary, researched
the HRX gene.
"For the time being, it's basical
ly helping to define the disease and
get more of an idea of why people
get leukemia," she said. "But
hopefully it is a causative mecha
nism" of leukemia, she added,
something further research could
demonstrate.
The discovery "will lead to an
understanding of the biology of
the disease," Tkachuk said. He
pointed out that it is not a cure
for leukemia, but "more of an
insight into the cause. That's less
sensationalistic, but in some ways
more important."
Tkachuk said that while the
gene break and reformation is not
likely to be the sole cause of a
leukemia, "it is an integral part of
the progression" of getting the
cancer.
He described the development
of a cancer as a "multiple hit pro
cess. . . . You probably need two
or three hits to get cancer." The
chromosomal split may be "an
important early step in the series
of long hits that lead to cancer,"
he said.
The discovery also helps in the
diagnosis of the disease, according
to Kohler.

For example, Tkachuk said,
new technologies allow doctors to
measure even small portions of
certain genes, and could be used
to try to detect the presence of the
HRX gene — and the danger of
leukemia — in patients recover
ing from lymphatic cancers who
can be susceptible to this type of
leukemia.
One interesting feature of the
discovery, Tkachuk said, is the
similarity between the HRX gene
and a gene called THX, the tritho
rax gene found in flies.
The fact that the gene is "con
served" within different species
indicates that it serves some
important biological role. It might
also lead to a deeper understand
ing of the human disease by look
ing at the role the similar gene
plays in flies.
In humans, he said, the HRX
gene is "a very big gene" that
helps build a protein used in
DNA.
Tkachuk said he will continue
to investigate the gene, hoping to
discover just which portions of
the HRX gene lead to leukemia.
