U.S. receives Vietnam POW relics
HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Three U.S. senators
yesterday were given fading photographs, flight
suits and other relics of American servicemen
missing from a war that ended two decades ago .
On what he termed "an extraordinary day,"
Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., along with Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., and Sen. Hank Brown, R-Colo.,
became the first American officials to tour the
Citadel, Hanoi's equivalent of the Pentagon.
Vietnamese officials also gave the members of
the Senate Select Committee on POW-MIA
Affairs military logs of downed U.S. aircraft, a
U.S. Army survival manual and a flight helmet
said to have belonged to Sen. John McCain, R-
Ariz., a Navy flier who was shot down over Hanoi
and taken prisoner in 1967.
The visit comes amid rising optimism that the
United States may lift a trade embargo and diplo
matic freeze it has maintained against Vietnam
since 1975, when the Communist regime in
Hanoi took over U.S.-backed South Vietnam.
