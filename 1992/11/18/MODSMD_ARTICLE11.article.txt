# United States searches for indicted terrorists

WASHINGTON (AP) - The United
States is mounting an international
search for Iranian-backed suspects secret
ly indicted for kidnapping and murdering
Americans, officials said yesterday.
The Justice Department has obtained
sealed indictments against at least four
alleged terrorists identified by U.S. intel
ligence as responsible for killing Ameri
can hostages in Lebanon and blowing up
at least one airliner, said two U.S. officials
who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The Justice Department, which
according to sources will use "Wanted"
advertisements and offer $2 million in
rewards to apprehend the suspects,
declined to comment on the indictments,
first reported yesterday by CNN.
One of the sealed indictments is
either against the suspected killer of the
ClA's Beirut station chief, William
Buckley, or the suspected killer of
Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, said
another source familiar with the indict
ments, who also requested anonymity.
Buckley died in captivity in Lebanon
in 1985 and Higgins was killed by his
Shiite Muslim captors in 1988 or 1989.
Kidnapped American Kilburn was
killed in 1986, but it was unclear
whether his alleged killer was among
those indicted.
"To bring these murderers to justice,
the U.S. government offers rewards of
up to $2 million," said one of the ads
which will be placed in U.S. and interna
tional newspapers. It shows pictures of
all three murdered Americans, and
urges anyone with information to con

tact the FBI or the U.S. embassy.
The rewards could reach up to $4 mil
lion under an arrangement of matching
funds from U.S. airlines for information
that prevents terrorism against carriers.
Also among the terrorists identified
by the United States in the last year are
those responsible for placing a bomb that
exploded aboard a TWA plane over
Greece in 1986, sucking four passengers
to their deaths, said the second source.
The ads also seek information about
that attack.
One stark ad shows a pair of baby
shoes under a caption that says: "$2 mil
lion won't bring baby Demetra back. But
it may bring her murderers to justice."
The infant and her mother were
among the four killed in the TWA
bombing.
In the last two years, the U.S. govern
ment has paid about $2 million for infor
mation about terrorists and has hidden
some of its informants to protect them
from retribution, said a State Department
official who asked not to be identified.
The reward program was instituted
in 1984. Until now, its publicity has
sought general information about ter
rorism.
The new ads are the first to seek
information on specific cases, reflecting
what U.S. officials believe are improved
prospects for apprehending suspects.
"There's a better chance now that
people will be willing to come forward
with information," said Anthony Quain
ton, assistant secretary of state for diplo
matic security.
