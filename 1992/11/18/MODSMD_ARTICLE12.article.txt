LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -
President-elect Clinton said yes
terday he wants to get President
Bush's "candid" read on world
affairs during his first post-victory
trip to Washington, a visit that
also will include a stop in an inner
city neighborhood.
"I'll be pretty much at his dis
eosal, but there are one or two
lings I want to raise," Clinton
said as he posed for pictures with
transition aides at the Arkansas
governor's mansion.

"There are one or two things. . .
hanging out there that need
addressing and I want to get his
candid assessment about some
world issues, some problems I'll be
facing at the beginning of my
term," Clinton said. He did not
specify which issues he wanted to
discuss with Bush during their
White House visit today.
Clinton spent much of yesterday
working on his transition. He filled
out his transition team by tapping
longtime friend and former South

Carolina Gov. Dick Riley to oversee
the hiring of the new administra
tion's top lieutenants.
As assistant director for person
nel, Riley will head the transition's
job-screening operation in Wash
ington. He will work with Clinton
and his yet-to-be-named Cabinet
to fill sub-Cabinet and agency
posts.
Transition director Warren
N Qyistopher offered Riley's selec
tion as evidence that Clinton was
looking "beyond Washington for

ideas and talent."
After Clinton's scheduled after
noon visit with Bush — likely to
start with a White House Rose
Garden picture-taking session —
Clinton was heading for an inner
city strip under redevelopment
near Howard University, the
country's preeminent, historically
black college.
r» And Clinton eschewecT the mili
taiy plane he's now eligible for in
favor of flying to the nation's capital
on the chartered jet used during his

campaign. He declined the chance to
stay at Blair House — the presi
dent's official guest house — and
opted instead for a nearby hotel.
Christopher predicted Clinton
and Bush would "have a substan
tive discussion of the major prob
lems facing America at the present
time."
"I think it will not be just a
social call, but. . . as has always
been true historically, it's a time
when the outgoing president com
municates important thoughts to

the incoming president," Christo
pher said.
Yesterday, Clinton called
together his top transition aides
for a progress update. Vice Presi
dent-elect Al Gore and Clinton's
wife, Hillary, participated as well.
For the second straight day,
Clinton was asked about his wife's
role,
"We just sort of sit down here
around the table and talk. She's
part of it," Clinton said matter-of
factly.
