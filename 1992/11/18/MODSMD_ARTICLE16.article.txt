## Playing by the rules 
### 
Athletics Dept. should
speak, but discipline
is for Judicial Affairs

WHEN FRESHMAN Brodie
Van Wagenen was booked
on charges of battery at
Santa Clara North County Jail,
Nov. 7 after assaulting a fellow stu
dent, he was booked not as a mem
ber of the Stanford baseball team,
but as an individual guilty of a
criminal act.
Likewise, if convicted of the
felony, Van Wagenen's position on
the team will neither increase nor
decrease the probability of him
spending as much as a year in
county jail. While the Department
of Athletics' concern over the inci
dent is understandable, it would
do well to leave official investiga
tion of Van Wagenen's conduct to
the University's Office of Judicial
Affairs and the proper county
authorities.
Just as the Athletics Depart
ment should not reward its stu
dent athletes with special privi
leges, it should be very cautious
about penalizing the personal con
duct of any athlete without first
establishing a formal set of guide
lines by which its players must
conform. Without such guidelines,
the Athletics Department would be
wrong to rescind Van Wagenen's
scholarship for his actions off the
field.
Associate Athletic Director
Cheryl Levick admits that the
department generally treads
extremely softly when dealing with
incidents like Van Wagenen's —
and with good reason.
Because the melee that led to
his arrest occurred on campus,
ultimately it is the responsibility of
the Office of Judicial Affairs to
investigate the matter and deter
mine his campus punishment if
any.
In fact, it is the office's duty to
explore any student's disciplining
for such a matter. Furthermore, it

must not be forgotten, that in this
particular case, Van Wagenen will
also be investigated by the coun
ty's law enforcement agency.
Still, there exists the question of
student athletes as privileged
members of the Stanford commu
nity. One would be hard pressed to
find another group of students
more regularly presented in the
media.
As a new member of the base
ball team, Van Wagenen will poten
tially have more media exposure
during his stay on the Farm than
the typical student. In fact, if he
proves to be a valuable asset to the
team, he may soon enjoy the ado
ration of hundreds of fans —
including cute little impression
able ones looking for role models.
Perhaps in the best of possible
worlds, this status would not
increase the "responsibility" of the
athlete to the University or the
Athletics Department. They'd be
no more responsible for their con
duct on and off campus than the
typical graduate or undergraduate
student. Unfortunately, this is far
from the case.
Therefore, even though the Ath
letics Department must be cau
tious about penalizing athletes
without first establishing a formal
reviewing process, it can not
ignore the conduct of its athletes
either. If it finds the conduct of a
player unacceptable, then it has a
moral responsibility to voice this
opposition.
For the department to ignore
this suggests one of two positions:
• Stanford athletes are not held
responsible for their personal con
duct, in which case, they are ele
vated to a special status within the
community; or
• The department's silence sig
nals it's approval.
While the Athletics Department
claims it has not yet received "offi
cial notification" of the charges, it
seems clear that a silent voice of
agreement is not an option. A
more realistic option might be to
release an opinion on the matter as
soon as possible.
