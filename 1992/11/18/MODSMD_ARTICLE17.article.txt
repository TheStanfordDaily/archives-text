Production of 'Mikado' doesn't discriminate

IRENE CHANG AND Selena Dong
recently expressed a concern that the
upcoming production of "The Mika
do" would be demeaning toward Asians
and women and might foster racist and
sexist attitudes.
We appreciate their concern, but we
disagree.
"The Mikado" does not caricature
Japan, but Victorian English aristocra
cy. Japan is simply a setting and an
artistic motif — one that was fairly
popular at the time. The song that
Chang and Dong quoted calls attention
to this. "On many a face and jar/ On
many a screen and fan" tells us that
the people we are seeing in the play are
the kinds of people we see on vases,

etc., as opposed to the people we see in
real life.
Gilbert and Sullivan knew they were
not accurately depicting the Japanese or
their costumes. This did not bother
them since they were not focusing on
Japan.
Indeed, the word "Japan" occurs very
rarely in the story. There are many
more references to Parliament, family
pride and false humaneness. In fact, the
level to which it criticized Victorian Eng
land was such that Gilbert was worried
about it offending his English audiences
too much.
Nothing in the play encourages the
modern stereotypes of the Japanese. In
fact, most of the modern stereotypes of

the Japanese didn't exist in the 1880's.
We believe the directors avoided
encouraging racism or stereotypes. Cos
tumes and makeup vaguely try to follow
ancient Japanese and Chinese acting
traditions rather than imitate Japanese
people. The effect is one that approxi
mates Gilbert and Sullivan's intentions
— a surface Japanese motif covering a
satire of England.
The only example of sexism cited by
Chang and Dong was a term of endear
ment: "To think that all my happiness
is wrapped up in that little parcel." To
claim that calling her a "little parcel" is
demeaning to her because parcels are
inanimate is like taking offense to being
called "honey" since honey is inanimate.

Every production is different. If you
want to judge the merits of this produc
tion, we ask that you see it. If you feel
that it is racist or sexist, I'm sure the
directors would be willing to hear your
comments.
For other plays which are actually
racist, we agree with Chang and Dong -
we must not ban plays but rather be
more aware of the social and cultural
roots of the writers and why they wrote
what they did, and learn how to better
understand the race the play demeans.
In this way, we can appreciate the art,
and still learn to appreciate each other.
