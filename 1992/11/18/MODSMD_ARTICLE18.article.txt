# Timing of conference on Sea Scrolls may reflect anti-Semitism
## 
### 
Anti-Semitism at Stanford? When I
was an undergraduate here in the early
'80s I had heard rumors, denied by the
administration, that Stanford had once
had anti-Jewish policies and quotas. I
never believed it. Yet this weekend I
read that there will be a conference on
the Dead Sea Scrolls Friday evening. On
Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are perhaps the
greatest archaelogical discovery of the
century. They are also specifically the
writings of an ancient sect of Judiasm.
They are of interest to all scholars of
Western civilization including Chris
tians, Muslims and, especially, Jews.
This includes religious Jews who will be
attending synagogue Friday night.
To schedule an event such as this on
the Jewish Sabbath is at best insulting
and at worst exclusionary anti-

Semitism. I suggest that Stanford
rethink this decision and I ask all regis
tered participants, Jewish and non-Jew
ish, to boycott this event.
