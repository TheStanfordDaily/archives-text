# Libertarians call Ayn Rand's thinking a very influential force

Jonathon Marek complained in his Nov.
3 letter that Stanford Libertarians, by
its recent promotion of Ayn Rand's
ideas, was "fraudulently" associating
Ayn Rand with the libertarian move
ment. This is silly in the extreme.
The single influence most frequently
cited by libertarians as the starting
point in their journey toward the politi
cal position of limited government is
Ayn Rand. This is true among libertari
ans throughout the country and it is
true among libertarians on the Stanford
campus.

It is true, like it or not. There is even
a book written about the beginnings of
the modern libertarian movement that
talks about this very subject. The title —
"It Usually Begins with Ayn Rand."
What makes Rand such an icon to lib
ertarians is her compelling defense of
voluntary society and limited govern
meht. As Rand wrote in her essay, "The
Nature of Government," "The precondi
tion of a civilized society is the barring
of physical force from relationships —
thus establishing the principle that if
men wish to deal with one another, they
may do so only by means of reason: by
discussion, persuasion and voluntary,
uncoerced agreement."
Libertarians call this the non-coer
cion principle, and it is the common
denominator in most of what is called
libertarian.
A survey by the Library of Congress
recently identified "Atlas Shrugged,"
Rand's last novel, as the second most
influential book of our time. We at the
Stanford Libertarians highly recom
mend it.
