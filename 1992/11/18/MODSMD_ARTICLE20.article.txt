# Women's sailing gets snubbed by Athletics Dept. at USC game
## 
### 
At the football game against USC last
weekend, I was pleased to applaud the
Stanford athletes whose teams had won
Pacific 10 or national titles in the 1991-
1992 school year. I am upset, however,
about the omission of the women's sail
ing team.
The team dominated its division, the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Yacht Rac
ing Association, taking first place, and
went on to place 14th at nationals. Even
though the women's sailing team is not
a high-visibility sport, it is a varsity
sport.
The least the Department of Athletics
could do is recognize the team members'
contributions by taking five minutes to
find out the team's record and spending
30 seconds to announce it.
