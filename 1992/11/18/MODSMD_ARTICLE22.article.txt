## Going back to the '60s 
### 
1 MISSED THE '60s. I wake up in the
morning and say, "Dammit, I could
have gone to Woodstock. I could have
protested the war or taken acid or blown
up a building. What is my generation
going to do to top that?"
Slowly, I am seeing the answer. The
'90s are not boldly going where no gener
ation has gone before; we're simply
bringing back the same old show with dif
ferent faces and different politically cor
rect causes: Picard replaces Kirk, U2
replaces the Beatles, Clinton replaces
Kennedy. Rewind to 1960.
In 1960 the youthful John Kennedy
rose from the Democratic ranks and
replaced the symbol of the World War II
era, Dwight Eisenhower. It was a new
start for the nation, a new frontier. Now,
fast forward to 1992, and substitute Clin
ton for Kennedy, Bush for Eisenhower
and the Cold War for WWII. The "New
Covenant" you're left with is the same
drama again.
Kennedy symbolized the new nation,
the vigor of youth which was sweeping
the land. He was flashy, charming and
had that cute Boston accent. He and
Jackie gave us Camelot, but little else.
And then it was gone.
His assassination was a watershed in
the lives of our parents â€” ask them.
Almost all of them can tell you where
they were when they heard the news,
because the bullets that shattered JFK's

head did the same to Camelot. The '60s
we think of now really began November
22, 1963.
And now we have Bill Clinton filling
the Kennedy mold: the young, dashing!?)
Democrat whose youthful exuberance
contrasts with the establishment's stag
nancy in the White House. Those who
elected him are optimistic about the
future, anxious to prove the political met
tle of the baby-boomer generation
through its first President.
American politics, led by Clinton, now
follows the lead of the nation's pop cul
ture in the race to reclaim the '60s. It is
as if the country is waiting for the trends
of the '60s to cycle back into fashion,
instead of creating a distinct cultural
identity for the '90s.
Which group consistently sells outsit
concerts and grosses more every year
than any other? The Grateful Dead. Tie
dyes are still phenomenally popular, clas
sic rock remains a radio staple. Elvis will
be king again, in the White House.
What aspects of our '90ish pop culture
will have the staying power of that of the
great '60s? What would we include in a
time capsule buried during this decade? A
Madonna, U2 or Nirvana CD? All are
very popular but I doubt any of them will
have the raw force of Dylan or the Beat
les. Will our children ask to borrow our
CD's or DAT's to listen to? I doubt it.
It's possible to blame this on the Baby

Boomer generation, which has now come
of age, and continues to exert an influ
ence on American culture. But it goes
further than that. Now, the kids of the
Baby Boomers are in college.
Many of them are desperately looking
for a cause, any cause, to rally for. They
yearn for the college experiences their par
ents had. Tired of listening to the endless
stories of Vietnam War protests and vague
descriptions of Janis Joplin at Woodstock,
they want to make their own mark. But
the '60s script is still the one they follow to
make a point or take a stand.
The Gulf War and Rodney King
episodes just didn't cut it. They made a
brief splash but didn't shape our genera
tion, didn't rock the establishment.
We can though, and we don't need to
run our parents' playbook to do it. We
have the energy, creativity and courage.
Now is the time for our generation to
make its mark, so we too can elect one of
our own to the Presidency in 25 years.
How about Glyn Milburn in 2016?
