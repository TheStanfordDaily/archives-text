## African Eve not dead yet Revisionist theory of human evolution battered but unbowed 
### Troy Parkins 
"Mommy, daddy, where did I come
from?" This question, which has embar
rassed many generations of parents, may
now be answered, more scientifically,
with a simple word: "Eve."
"Eve" is the name given to the first
woman ancestor of all human beings. The
"Eve theory" was proposed by the late
Allan Wilson of UC-Berkeley.
The theory uses genetic evidence to
argue that all existing human beings orig
inated from a single woman. Wilson
believed that the woman lived in Africa
about 200,000 years ago.
The genetic evidence included the
examination of mitochondrial genes. The
cylindrical-shaped mitochondrion, found
in every human cell, is where energy to
sustain the cell is produced.
Mitochondria have their own set of
genes, which differ from those genes
found in the cell nucleus. Mitochondria
genes are passed to offspring almost
exclusively by the mother. This simple
mode of inheritance makes mitochondria
genes very convenient for the estimation
of genetic changes over time.
This theory was met with much hoopla
and resulted in confusion and controver
sy, according to Professor of Genetics
Luigi Cavalli-Sforza.
Cavalli-Sforza has been researching
the Eve theory since 1987, the year Wil
son proposed his theory. "Wilson first
showed that there is an ancestor to whom
all present mitochondrial DNA mutants
found today go back to; that ancestor was
called Eve."
However, many people were confused
and "believed that there was a single
woman on Earth," Cavalli-Sforza said,
"That is absolutely not true."
What is true is that scientists can trace
all mitochondrial DNA back to one
woman. But during Eve's time there were
many other women around whose mito
chondria were lost and became extinct.
Cavalli-Sforza used surnames as an
example to show why mitochondrial
DNA, other than Eve's, became extinct.
Sometimes all surnames in an isolated
community will go extinct except for one
because all the other males will die out or
not reproduce. There is evidence of this in
small Chinese villages, he said.
According to Cavalli-Sforza, just as one
woman is the ancestor of mitochondrial
DNA, there is one man, an "Adam," who
is the ancestor for all Y-chromosomes in
males today.
Nobody contested that mitochondrial
DNA can be traced back to one woman.
But Wilson also used this mitochondrial
evidence to construct a "family tree,"

demonstrating that Eve originated in
Africa about 200,000 years ago.
Then the controversy began.
One of the skeptics is Robert Sokal,
professor of Ecology and Evolution at
State University of New York at Stony
Brook, and who is spending his sabbatical
at Stanford.
According to Sokal, the evidence which
has been published is not nearly as clear
as people thought.
"In making trees of descent, called phy
logenetic trees, there are so many possi
bilities for these trees in which to
branch," Sokal said, "To arrive at the best
estimates for what the tree is like, you
have to exhaustively enumerate all the
possible solutions, and that's not possi
ble."
Computers have the ability to con
struct thousands of family trees. Howev
er, Sokal said that most researchers will
not look at more than 100 trees, and while
looking at these will use "parsimonious
assumptions."
Researchers assume evolution is parsi
monious and will look for the shortest
trees possible. But these trees may not
include the correct one. Sokal described
an experiment where researchers from
the University of Washington and Har
vard studied about 500 trees and found
solutions that did not include African ori
gins.
"So the evidence on African origins is
pretty shaky at the moment," Sokal said.
He added that the origin could be Middle
Eastern, but it is unlikely to be Asian or
European.
Cavalli-Sforza agrees that constructing
phylogenetic trees gives no absolute
assurance of obtaining the correct tree,
but attacking the Eve theory using this
reasoning is "a weak approach."
Scientists are able to determine the age
of a population by measuring changes in
mitochondrial DNA. If the rate of change
is constant with time, then the oldest pop
ulations will have the most altered DNA.
"The maximum diversity of mitochon
drial types are in Africa. It should have
maximum diversity because the oldest
people live there," Cavalli-Sforza said in
support of the theory of African origin.
One reason the Eve theory faces much
resistance is that it directly challenges a
well-established theory of human evolu
tion which originated in the 19505. That
theory states that modern humans evolved
independently in three different places.
Supporters of this theory believe that
pre-Africans, pre-Asians and pre-Middle
Easterners all evolved into modern
human beings separately, with only slight
modifications that resulted in the differ
ent races.

"This theory seems improbable," Sokal
said. "(In order for it to work) you need
strong selection for exactly the same fea
tures. .. . Modern population geneticists
would find this very hard to believe."
A controversy exists over the time at
which Eve lived. Wilson cited 200,000
years ago, while others believe it may
have been between 400,000 to one million
years ago.
In the history of humans there have
been two known expansions, when early
humans spread throughout the conti
nents. One expansion was 400,000 years
ago, while the other happened 100,000
years ago.

Scientists who lean toward Wilson's
theory think that the modern human
arose 200,000 years ago and started to
spread 100,000 years ago. Alternative the
ories assert modern humans arose
400,000 to one million years ago and
spread during the first expansion.
Despite these uncertainties surround
ing Eve, Cavalli-Sforza said that —
metaphorically — she is still alive and
well.
"The criticisms of the theory that were
made are very weak. They have been
made with enormous fanfare — just to
counter the great fanfare about African
Eve," he said.

Presently, Cavalli-Sforza said he is
"planning a big project" to show "solid
data" to support the Eve theory, instead
of "limited data which we now have."
Sforza's project will consist of analyzing
numerous samples of DNA from ethnic
populations all over the world.

The Science Bug
"Mommy, daddy, where did I come
from?" This question, which has embar
rassed many generations of parents, may
now be answered, more scientifically,
with a simple word: "Eve."
"Eve" is the name given to the first
woman ancestor of all human beings. The
"Eve theory" was proposed by the late
Allan Wilson of UC-Berkeley.
The theory uses genetic evidence to
argue that all existing human beings orig
inated from a single woman. Wilson
believed that the woman lived in Africa
about 200,000 years ago.
The genetic evidence included the
examination of mitochondrial genes. The
cylindrical-shaped mitochondrion, found
in every human cell, is where energy to
sustain the cell is produced.
Mitochondria have their own set of
genes, which differ from those genes
found in the cell nucleus. Mitochondria
genes are passed to offspring almost
exclusively by the mother. This simple
mode of inheritance makes mitochondria
genes very convenient for the estimation
of genetic changes over time.
This theory was met with much hoopla
and resulted in confusion and controver
sy, according to Professor of Genetics
Luigi Cavalli-Sforza.
Cavalli-Sforza has been researching
the Eve theory since 1987, the year Wil
son proposed his theory. "Wilson first
showed that there is an ancestor to whom
all present mitochondrial DNA mutants
found today go back to; that ancestor was
called Eve."
However, many people were confused
and "believed that there was a single
woman on Earth," Cavalli-Sforza said,
"That is absolutely not true."
What is true is that scientists can trace
all mitochondrial DNA back to one
woman. But during Eve's time there were
many other women around whose mito
chondria were lost and became extinct.
Cavalli-Sforza used surnames as an
example to show why mitochondrial
DNA, other than Eve's, became extinct.
Sometimes all surnames in an isolated
community will go extinct except for one
because all the other males will die out or
not reproduce. There is evidence of this in
small Chinese villages, he said.
According to Cavalli-Sforza, just as one
woman is the ancestor of mitochondrial
DNA, there is one man, an "Adam," who
is the ancestor for all Y-chromosomes in
males today.
Nobody contested that mitochondrial
DNA can be traced back to one woman.
But Wilson also used this mitochondrial
evidence to construct a "family tree,"

demonstrating that Eve originated in
Africa about 200,000 years ago.
Then the controversy began.
One of the skeptics is Robert Sokal,
professor of Ecology and Evolution at
State University of New York at Stony
Brook, and who is spending his sabbatical
at Stanford.
According to Sokal, the evidence which
has been published is not nearly as clear
as people thought.
"In making trees of descent, called phy
logenetic trees, there are so many possi
bilities for these trees in which to
branch," Sokal said, "To arrive at the best
estimates for what the tree is like, you
have to exhaustively enumerate all the
possible solutions, and that's not possi
ble."
Computers have the ability to con
struct thousands of family trees. Howev
er, Sokal said that most researchers will
not look at more than 100 trees, and while
looking at these will use "parsimonious
assumptions."
Researchers assume evolution is parsi
monious and will look for the shortest
trees possible. But these trees may not
include the correct one. Sokal described
an experiment where researchers from
the University of Washington and Har
vard studied about 500 trees and found
solutions that did not include African ori
gins.
"So the evidence on African origins is
pretty shaky at the moment," Sokal said.
He added that the origin could be Middle
Eastern, but it is unlikely to be Asian or
European.
Cavalli-Sforza agrees that constructing
phylogenetic trees gives no absolute
assurance of obtaining the correct tree,
but attacking the Eve theory using this
reasoning is "a weak approach."
Scientists are able to determine the age
of a population by measuring changes in
mitochondrial DNA. If the rate of change
is constant with time, then the oldest pop
ulations will have the most altered DNA.
"The maximum diversity of mitochon
drial types are in Africa. It should have
maximum diversity because the oldest
people live there," Cavalli-Sforza said in
support of the theory of African origin.
One reason the Eve theory faces much
resistance is that it directly challenges a
well-established theory of human evolu
tion which originated in the 19505. That
theory states that modern humans evolved
independently in three different places.
Supporters of this theory believe that
pre-Africans, pre-Asians and pre-Middle
Easterners all evolved into modern
human beings separately, with only slight
modifications that resulted in the differ
ent races.

"This theory seems improbable," Sokal
said. "(In order for it to work) you need
strong selection for exactly the same fea
tures. .. . Modern population geneticists
would find this very hard to believe."
A controversy exists over the time at
which Eve lived. Wilson cited 200,000
years ago, while others believe it may
have been between 400,000 to one million
years ago.
In the history of humans there have
been two known expansions, when early
humans spread throughout the conti
nents. One expansion was 400,000 years
ago, while the other happened 100,000
years ago.

Scientists who lean toward Wilson's
theory think that the modern human
arose 200,000 years ago and started to
spread 100,000 years ago. Alternative the
ories assert modern humans arose
400,000 to one million years ago and
spread during the first expansion.
Despite these uncertainties surround
ing Eve, Cavalli-Sforza said that —
metaphorically — she is still alive and
well.
"The criticisms of the theory that were
made are very weak. They have been
made with enormous fanfare — just to
counter the great fanfare about African
Eve," he said.

though, I'm not sure why you still feel

One possibility is that the water you
drink while intoxicated — while
ethanol's inhibition of ADH is still going

Presently, Cavalli-Sforza said he is
"planning a big project" to show "solid
data" to support the Eve theory, instead
of "limited data which we now have."
Sforza's project will consist of analyzing
numerous samples of DNA from ethnic
populations all over the world.
Presently, scientists from Stanford,
UC-Berkeley and Harvard have collected
data from 15 populations consisting of 30
to 60 individuals, but Cavalli-Sforza said
he will need many more populations to

Presently, scientists from Stanford,
UC-Berkeley and Harvard have collected
