# Thirsting for an answer? You're in trouble

/"VI can never seem to drink enough on
VZk Friday nights, as when I wake up on
Saturday morning, I'm still thirsty. How
can this be?
— Marko Balabanovic
A : I'm going to go out on a limb here
xjLand assume that even though you are
affiliated with Stanford, your drink of
choice on Friday nights is not Clearly
Canadian™.
If I can safely guess that you drown
your self-pitying thoughts about the
celibate, monastic grind that fills your
week-daily life (i.e., the typical Stanford
existence) with alcohol, then I might be
able to offer some constructive advice.
The naive, inadequate answer to your
question is that if you spend your Friday
nights like the rest of us, you are hung
over on Saturday mornings, and thirst is
one of the symptoms of a hangover.
Being a member of the Stanford com
munity, however, you doubtless have a
penetrating and demanding intellect,
and this brief response will prove unsat
isfying.
To satisfy your inquiring mind,

Marko, I had to pull out my dusty phys
iology textbook and do a little reading on
the subject of human endocrinology. It
turns out that the association of alcohol
intake with thirst (and the symptoms of
hangovers in general) is the result of
alcohol's negative effect on the release
of a single hormone, the so-called antid
iuretic hormone (ADH).
ADH is a neuropeptide released by
the pituitary gland, a tiny but signifi
cant endocrine gland located on the
brain's underbelly. The pituitary is
quite a star of the mammalian endocrine
system, releasing at various times in its
professional career some nine different
hormones.
This breadth of expertise has
impressed some physiologists enough
that they call the pituitary the "master
gland." Since the pituitary itself is
under the control of a section of the
brain called the hypothalamus, howev
er, I prefer not to dignify it with such a
title.
Regardless of what you call it, the
pituitary unquestionably releases ADH,
in greater or lesser amounts, depending
on the water balance of the individual in
question.
Antidiuretic hormone earns its name

by preventing diuresis, which is what
you call urination after you finish your
first year of medical school. Its primary
physiological action is to increase the
permeability of the collecting ducts of
the kidney, thereby decreasing the
amount of water leaving the blood to
become urine.
Release of ADH is promoted by two
closely related factors: low blood volume
and high plasma osmolarity. ("Osmolar
ity," by the way, is just a high-falutin'
word for the summed concentrations of
everything the blood happens to be car
rying — sugars, salts, proteins, etc.
When body water levels go down, osmo
larity goes up.) This makes sense,
because when the water content of the
blood is too low, there's no point in los
ing still more water to the urine.
ADH secretion is downregulated,
however, by ingestion of ethanol, the
active ingredient in pina coladas. This
inhibitory effect of alcohol on ADH
results in a great deal of water leaving
the bloodstream for the bladder —
hence the old saying, "You don't buy
beer, you just rent it."
When you drink alcohol, then, ADH
levels go down, you urinate copiously,
and your net intake of fluids is no match
