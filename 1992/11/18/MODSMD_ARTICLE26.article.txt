# One cannot afford to become bored with AIDSâ€”there's trouble ahead

The American public has become
immune to AIDS. After so many years of
public service announcements and con
doms being stretched over bananas, the
public has turned its attention to other
crises.

Health Watch

Yet the World Health Organization
(WHO) estimates that 10-12 million peo
ple are already infected with HIV. By the
year 2000, WHO estimates 12-18 million
people worldwide will "have fallen ill and
require the care and support of their
communities" as a result of AIDS.
Stanford organizations like Cowell
continue to Tight to keep the issue at the
forefront of public discussion. Meantime,
the Medical Center keeps uncovering new
ways to assist doctors in treating HIV
patients.

Cowell raises awareness
According to Carol Patrovsky, coordi
nator of the Health Promotion Program
at Cowell Health Center, "People are eas
ily falling back into denial about AIDS as
an issue."
In order to maintain AIDS awareness
here on campus, Stanford will participate
in "World AIDS Day" on Dec. 1. The day
will include dispensing free condoms and
literature on AIDS and the HIV virus.
A larger scale event,: "Stanford AIDS
Awareness Week," is being planned for
the first week of March. Though plans
are still tentative, the week will likely fea
ture speakers, AIDS/HIV "flicks," cre
ative performances and a display of pan
els from Project Quilt.
Two classes are offered for those who
want to become more familiar with AIDS
and related topics. "The Impact of AIDS"
is an undergraduate class offered
through the Human Biology department
winter quarter. Open to non-science
majors, Prof. Siegel's course focuses on
the biological and psychosocial aspects of

AIDS.
Patrovsky will also lead a course later
this year that will discuss psychosocial
and protective sex issues relevant to
AIDS
In addition, students interested in
becoming outreach educators can do so
through Students AIDS Volunteer Edu
cators, a peer educator program that
sponsors informational programs for
dorms, fraternities and other organiza
tions.
Students with creative projects, perfor
mance ideas or suggestions are encour

aged to contact Patrovsky at 723-0821.
When AZT fails
Meanwhile, the Medical Center is
busily investigating the effectiveness of
the drug AZT on HIV patients.
According to Research Fellow
Michael Kozel, Ph.D, who presented his
findings last month, those patients with
a noticeable decline in CD4 cells (which
has been recognized as an indicator of
disease progression) also showed evi
dence of specific mutations in their HIV
virus. These mutations, Kozel believes,
suggest the virus has mutated itself in
order to escape suppression by the drug
AZT.
"Once the HIV virus has developed
resistance to the drug lAZTI," said Kozel,
"the drug is no longer effective."
AZT is given to those positive for the
HIV virus who have not yet developed
symptoms of the AIDS syndrome. It
works by suppressing the HIV virus and
inhibiting it from replicating. The new
discovery about is based on the retrospec
tive analysis of blood samples from 40

participants in a three year long study
carried out at Stanford on the AZT's effi
cacy.
Kozel hopes that early detection of
virus mutation will provide an early sig
nal to switch to alternative treatment
therapies.
Kozel's lab group is presently studying
what these alternatives might be.
HIV testing available
Confidential and free HIV testing by a
trained peer counselor or physician is
available to registered Stanford students
through Cowell.
For non-students, community AIDS
resources are plentiful. The San Mateo
County Public Health office (415) 573-
2385, the Santa Clara County Public
Health office (408) 299-6245 or the Palo
Alto Red Cross at 322-2143 are also good
sources of information.
