## Hard-working quarterback steps up to lead role Stenstrom has history of football success 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
The sun had set, but practice
continued in the twilight. All the
others had left except for the
offensive backfield. In the center
of the group, quarterback Steve
Stenstrom took a few final snaps
to the satisfaction of himself and
the coaches.
The play was simple, just a
fake handoff and an option-style
pitch left to Glyn Milburn. But
intricacies are involved in every
play, and Stenstrom wanted to
make his fake more realistic to
facilitate Milburn's run. It's this
kind of dedication and attention

to detail that makes Stenstrom
one of the best quarterbacks in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
Stenstrom began playing foot
ball in the fourth grade, and has
played quarterback his entire
life. From the outset, he was
driven by a fascination with the
game.
"I grew up loving football and
always wanted to play," he said.
"My parents encouraged me but
never pushed me to choose foot
ball. They just wanted me to
work hard at whatever I did."
Born in Dallas, he was a fan of
Roger Staubach until Joe Mon
tana and the San Francisco 49ers
defeated the Dallas Cowboys in
the 1981 NFC Championship
game. The impressionable young
Stenstrom thereafter adopted
Montana as his hero.
Even today, Stenstrom's room
is adorned with posters of Mon
tana, a sort of shrine dedicated to
greatness in quarterbacking. He
also had a chance to meet the liv
ing legend, calling the experience
"tremendous."
Like most college players,
Stenstrom harbors dreams of
playing in the NFL. But with two
years of college eligibility
remaining, professional football
is something he has not begun to
think about.
"It's been a dream since I was
a young child," he said. "But I'm
not planning on it. I like to take
things one week at a time, one
game at a time."
As a senior at El Toro High
School, Stenstrom completed 66
percent of his passes for 2,175
yards and 25 touchdowns, estab
lishing himself as one of the best
high school quarterbacks in the
nation. When he arrived at Stan
ford, however, he found himself
looking at a long quarterback
depth chart.
After being redshirted his
freshman season, Stenstrom
entered 1991 as the Cardinal's
third-stringer. But when John
Lynch made the switch to safety,

Stenstrom emerged as the back
up to Jason Palumbis.
When Stanford was losing
badly to Notre Dame last year,
Stenstrom stepped in and per
formed well in the fourth quar
ter of a lost cause. With the Car
dinal 1-3, former head coach
Denny Green decided it was time
for a change and named Sten
strom the starter the following
week against Cornell.
Stenstrom started the
remainder of the season and won
all seven of his regular-season
games to lead Stanford to an 8-3
record and an Aloha Bowl berth
against Georgia Tech. In 1991,
he completed more than 60 per
cent of his passes, including 15
touchdowns and just six inter
ceptions.
This year, Stenstrom sees his
role as having changed over the
previous year. "Last year I was
more constricted by the people
around me," he said. "I feel like
now I have more responsibility
on my shoulders to be produc
tive."
Stenstrom has suffered from
spotty pass protection and has
been sacked 49 times this season.
Despite the numerous beatings
and minor injuries, he has still
completed 183 of 309 passes,
including 11 touchdowns.
Although he is satisfied with
how the team has played so far
this year, Stenstrom realizes
that the biggest challenges lie in
Big Game and in an upcoming
bowl game. He senses the possi
bility of a great season.
"We have big things in store
for us," he said. "Like a chance to
finish in the top 10. We have to
understand that Big Game is
entirely based on emotion. Every
one feels a sense of urgency."
As darkness overtook the
field, Stenstrom and his team
mates called it a night. Bringing
everyone together, Stenstrom
ended practice with two pre
dictable but forceful words:
»"Beat Cal."

Steve Stenstrom hopes to lead the Cardinal offense to his second Big Game victory.
The sun had set, but practice
continued in the twilight. All the
others had left except for the
offensive backfield. In the center
of the group, quarterback Steve
Stenstrom took a few final snaps
to the satisfaction of himself and
the coaches.
The play was simple, just a
fake handoff and an option-style
pitch left to Glyn Milburn. But
intricacies are involved in every
play, and Stenstrom wanted to
make his fake more realistic to
facilitate Milburn's run. It's this
kind of dedication and attention

to detail that makes Stenstrom
one of the best quarterbacks in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
Stenstrom began playing foot
ball in the fourth grade, and has
played quarterback his entire
life. From the outset, he was
driven by a fascination with the
game.
"I grew up loving football and
always wanted to play," he said.
"My parents encouraged me but
never pushed me to choose foot
ball. They just wanted me to
work hard at whatever I did."
Born in Dallas, he was a fan of
Roger Staubach until Joe Mon
tana and the San Francisco 49ers
defeated the Dallas Cowboys in
the 1981 NFC Championship
game. The impressionable young
Stenstrom thereafter adopted
Montana as his hero.
Even today, Stenstrom's room
is adorned with posters of Mon
tana, a sort of shrine dedicated to
greatness in quarterbacking. He
also had a chance to meet the liv
ing legend, calling the experience
"tremendous."
Like most college players,
Stenstrom harbors dreams of
playing in the NFL. But with two
years of college eligibility
remaining, professional football
is something he has not begun to
think about.
"It's been a dream since I was
a young child," he said. "But I'm
not planning on it. I like to take
things one week at a time, one
game at a time."
As a senior at El Toro High
School, Stenstrom completed 66
percent of his passes for 2,175
yards and 25 touchdowns, estab
lishing himself as one of the best
high school quarterbacks in the
nation. When he arrived at Stan
ford, however, he found himself
looking at a long quarterback
depth chart.
After being redshirted his
freshman season, Stenstrom
entered 1991 as the Cardinal's
third-stringer. But when John
Lynch made the switch to safety,

Stenstrom emerged as the back
up to Jason Palumbis.
When Stanford was losing
badly to Notre Dame last year,
Stenstrom stepped in and per
formed well in the fourth quar
ter of a lost cause. With the Car
dinal 1-3, former head coach
Denny Green decided it was time
for a change and named Sten
strom the starter the following
week against Cornell.
Stenstrom started the
remainder of the season and won
all seven of his regular-season
games to lead Stanford to an 8-3
record and an Aloha Bowl berth
against Georgia Tech. In 1991,
he completed more than 60 per
cent of his passes, including 15
touchdowns and just six inter
ceptions.
This year, Stenstrom sees his
role as having changed over the
previous year. "Last year I was
more constricted by the people
around me," he said. "I feel like
now I have more responsibility
on my shoulders to be produc
tive."
Stenstrom has suffered from
spotty pass protection and has
been sacked 49 times this season.
Despite the numerous beatings
and minor injuries, he has still
completed 183 of 309 passes,
including 11 touchdowns.
Although he is satisfied with
how the team has played so far
this year, Stenstrom realizes
that the biggest challenges lie in
Big Game and in an upcoming
bowl game. He senses the possi
bility of a great season.
"We have big things in store
for us," he said. "Like a chance to
finish in the top 10. We have to
understand that Big Game is
entirely based on emotion. Every
one feels a sense of urgency."
As darkness overtook the
field, Stenstrom and his team
mates called it a night. Bringing
everyone together, Stenstrom
ended practice with two pre
dictable but forceful words:
»"Beat Cal."
