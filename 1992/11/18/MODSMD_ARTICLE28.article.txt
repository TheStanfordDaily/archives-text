# Cardinal sharpens axe to carve up Bears for holidays
## 
### 
Ah, 'tis the season. As the song goes,
"It's the most wonderful time of the
year." Thoughts turn to home,
Thanksgiving and cranberry sauce. But
before you start thinking turkey, one
small minor detail has to be taken care of:
procuring the blade to cut it. This can only
be accomplished by one task, a task which
encapsulates the Bay Area, dividing the
populace into two equally hostile groups.
That task is a victory in the Big Game.
Just as Bill Cosby told of the tradition of
passing the Huxtable knife from generation
to generation to carve the sacred bird every
November, so too do we at Stanford pass a
knife from from generation to generation,
or more specifically from class to class.
It's called The Axe. And on recent
Thanksgivings, Cardinal fans have had a
lot to be thankful for; if nothing else, the
Stanford football team has kept the tro
phy far out of reach from the hated Wee
nies of Berkeley.
The Axe has resided in its proper home
in Tresidder Union since 1987. By Satur
day, Cal fans will have caught a glimpse of
The Axe only four times in the 1,826 days

that have passed since that date — when
the Stanford Axe Committee has paraded
it around during the fourth quarter of
each of the successive Big Games that fol
lowed. This year's seniors, like the previ
ous two classes before them, have never
lost to Cal.
But if any year is cause for concern, it's
this one. For this year, unlike in recent
contests, Stanford is entering Big Game as
the clear favorite. Those who speak of
tossing out all the stats at Big Game time
have reason to be loud again this year —
and point to the possibility of a (gasp)
Blue-and-Gold victory.
In the past four years, the team with
the lesser record has prevailed. In the past
two years, Stanford has put a damper on
Cal's seasons while not affecting the Gold
en Bears' bowl destinations. This season,
though, where the Card will wind up in
post-season play depends on the Big Game
outcome.
Cal would like nothing better than to
boot Stanford out of a possible New Year's
Day national-television Fiesta Bowl
matchup in favor of a nice late-December

exhibition in Shreveport at the Poulan
Weed Eater. In 1980, a 2-8 Cal team pre
vented a 6-4 Stanford team from going to
the Peach Bowl. In 1982, the Bears kept
the Cardinal out of the Hall of Fame Bowl.
And in 1992 the 4-6 Bears will prevent
Stanford from. ..
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Sorry
folks, not gonna happen. Cal is not going
to do it. In this, the 100 th Anniversary
and the 95th playing of the Big Game, it
just wouldn't be prudent. Just look at the
matchups:
• Running backs: Cal has Russell
White, Stanford has Glyn Milburn.
Advantage: even.

• Quarterback: Comparing* Steve Sten
strom to Dave Barr is too easy. Let's com
pare Mark Butterfield to Barr. Same
result. Advantage: Stanford.
• Defense: The Stanford 'D' is ranked
ninth in the NCAA in total defense. Cal?
not even close. Advantage: Stanford.
• Mascot: Stanford has a tree. Cal has
loveable Oski. There's no excuse for our
mascot — you can't cheer on a tree.
Advantage: Cal.
• SAT scores: The U.S. News and World
Report rankings tell the story. If not, ask
Jason Kidd.
• Famous campus personalities: Stan
ford has Joel Stein. Cal has a Naked Guy
who does not wear clothes to class. Joel
talks about bodily fluids, but luckily keeps
his observations to the printed page,
whereas the Naked Guy flaunts his assets
for everyone to see. At least after Joel
leaves his seat after an English lecture,
you don't have to worry about sitting in
the seat after him.
• Coaches: Stanford has Bill Walsh. Cal
has Keith Gilbertson. Let's repeat that.
Stanford has Bill Walsh. Keith who? 'Nuff

said.
The Big Game is always exciting, espe
cially when it is played in Berkeley. This
year marks the 10th anniversary of The
Play, when the Stanford band failed to
prevent a Cal touchdown. But two years
ago, Cal fan behavior led to a Stanford
score. This time in Memorial Stadium,
both parties would best be served by leav
ing the field to the players.
The last time I was in Memorial Stadi
um, a certain public address announcer
told Cal rooters to "Please clear the field.
The game is not over," and they did not
listen until it was too late. I think they
have learned their lesson. Unfortunately
for the Cal football team, though, school
will once again be in session on Saturday
as the Cardinal teaches them the nuances
of the game. Hopefully, the Naked Guy
will not be in attendance.

David Schwartz let the impassioned fan in
him take over his column this week. He
might return to his opinionated journalistic
self next Wednesday, depending on who
wins.
