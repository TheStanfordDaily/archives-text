# Stanford golf misses mark in end of season tournament

### SooSang Park Staff writer 
Yesterday the young Stanford men's golf team
completed the fall segment of their season on a
down note, despite stretches of strong play. The
Cardinal netted a seventh-place finish at the
Olympic Invitational, hosted by University of San
Francisco.
Out of the 12-team field, a seasoned UCLA squad
took home the championship with a total score of
882. Pepperdine finished second with a score of 901,
and Stanford arch-rival California took third with
907.
"UCLA got so far ahead of the pack," said Cardi
nal coach Wally Goodwin. "They're so experienced
and so talented. Obviously at this stage we're not in
their league."
The Stanford players expressed some disappoint
ment with their overall team play. "We all felt we
could have done better," said senior Dave Rutkows
ki. "We had some goals going in that we didn't
achieve."
The team hoped to finish in the top half of the
field, and after two rounds the Cardinal found
themselves six shots out of fifth place and sought to
gain ground, but ultimately the team fell a bit short.
"It was not a good showing of the team's ability,"
said freshmen Peter Ligotti. "Our goal on the last
day was to shoot 300 or better."
Stanford shot 308 in the final round, as the
famous Olympic Club, a notoriously difficult par-72
course, posed quite a stiff challenge.
"The greens were tough. They were quick and
bumpy. It was hard to get a true roll on the ball,"
said Ligotti, who was competing in only his second
collegiate event.

"The course wasn't in great shape. It's a tough
course, and when the green's are bumpy, it makes it
that much tougher. You'd work your butt off to get
to the green, and then you felt like it was luck from
there," Rutkowski concurred.
'UCLA got so far ahead of the
pack. They're so experienced and
so talented. Obviously at this
stage we're not in their league.'

Despite the disappointing team finish, Stanford
did have some bright individual play. Sophomore
sensation Steve Burdick, playing no. 1, shot an
even-par 72 in the third round, and fellow sopho
more Darren Dragovich also shot par in the second
round.
"Hitting par for that course is great," said coach
Goodwin.
On the individual front, Justin Hicks of UCLA
took first place with a final score of 217. Steve
Holmes of UC-Irvine finished second with 219,
while Kevin Clayborn, also from UCI.A, came in
third with a score of 220.
Burdick continued the hot hitting he's displayed
throughout the fall by tying for sixth with a total
score of 223. Teammate Dragovich finished 12th,
scoring 230.
