# Senators OK sound system
## Friday Flicks to be flushed 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate overwhelmingly approved a
$92,500 loan to ASSU Flicks last night for the pur
chase and installation of a new sound system for
Memorial Auditorium, paving the way for a $1.50
surcharge on quarterly passes and a $.20 tab on
each ticket.
"[After the vote], I did a seven-foot jump that
would have made Carl Lewis proud," said Graduate
Senator Sanford Dickert, who has been negotiating
the deal for two months. He said the system will be
installed in the next two months.
The Senate also unanimously approved a bill to
discontinue the financially floundering Friday
Classic Flicks as of winter quarter.
Under the provisions of the sound system bill, the
ASSU will loan the money at 8 percent from its re
serves, which are estimated to be between $400,000
and $500,000. It will be paid back through the 15-
year Flicks surcharge and money from Stanford.
Yesterday the University agreed to give $14,800
to the project rather than charge $10 per hour for
use of the system, as originally proposed. Of the
$14,800, Events and Services will contribute
$9,800 and Public Affairs will contribute $5,000.
The University was against the idea of a user
surcharge because it is in competition with other
auditoriums in the area.
"They have to be competitive with the free mar
ket," said Graduate senator Brian Flachs, who
coauthored the bill. "[Sol the University has offered
to give us an up-front payment of
$14,800 as their show of good faith
in the deal."
The remaining amount will be
repaid through the surcharge on
Sunday Flicks' tickets and passes.
The ASSU estimates about
2,000 people attend Flicks every
week, meaning the surcharge will
generate about $9,000 a year. With
adjustments for inflation and lost
interest on the money loaned, the
ASSU estimates the surcharge will
pay for everything but $700, which
will be paid for with ASSU reserves.
The system will be installed by
Black Boxes, Inc., and will include
about 30 Apogee sound compo
nents dispersed in three clusters.
There will also be a fourth Sur
round Sound channel in the walls.
In order to save $5,000, the bill
did not include funding for a decora
tive scrim for the speakers.
Under the provisions of the bill,
the University will own the system
and the bill will not take effect
unless Events and Services agrees

not to increase maintenance costs
for five years due to the installa
tion of the system.
In other business, the ASSU
improved its financial status by
cancelling Friday Flicks, which
lost between $13,000 and $15,000
last year. The movies attracted
about 100 people on average and
were draining the ASSU reserves.
"If Friday nights are not the
best time to run a film series then
the Senate's made the right deci
sion," Friday Flicks manager John
Hall said. "But I think there's cer
tainly room for senators to talk to
students about what sort of ser
vices they want provided."
Hall will be reassigned to
another position following the can
cellation.
The Senate also approved the
Program Board budget and nomi
nations for University committees.
Graduate Senator Rob Corry
introduced a bill, to be voted on at
the next meeting, which would
repeal the Grey Conduct Code of
the Fundamental Standard. The
Grey Interpretation, as it is
known, is a content-based code
which prohibits speech directed at
certain groups.
