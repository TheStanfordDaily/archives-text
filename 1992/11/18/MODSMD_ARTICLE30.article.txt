# Stanford football gears up to maul Bears
## Cardinal players reflect on meaning of intense Big Game rivalry 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
Yesterday morning, many
students awoke to find their
paths marred by hideous blue
and yellow bear tracks. The
Bears, it seemed, had been
everywhere: on the front steps
of Roble, around the Law
School, even in the Quad.
The footprints serve as a
harsh reminder of the reality of
Big Game. No one is completely
safe from its effects, especially
not the players who are spend
ing this week preparing for this
Saturday's contest.
The rivalry between the Car
dinal and the University of Cali
fornia Golden Bears presents
players with the biggest
moments of their collegiate
careers. Although the rest of the
season is important at the time,
any sense of accomplishment or
satisfaction vanishes as Big
Game approaches.
"Whether we're ranked
110 th or first it's the biggest
game of the year," said senior
running back J.J. Lasley. "It's
the Big Game. That's why they
call it that."
With the Cardinal posting two
convincing victories over ranked
teams the last two weeks, com
placency could become danger
ous. In addition to the normal
preparations, Cardinal players
have taken it upon themselves to
ensure that this does not hap
pen.
"We're probably going to be
overdogs," said senior outside
linebacker Dave Garnett. "But
records and rankings don't mat
ter in Big Game. We just have to
impress upon ourselves the fact
that whoever wants this game
the most is going to win it."
The Bears' woes also con
tribute to the illusion of the mis
match between the two teams.
Although Berkeley has been
shellacked by mediocre Pacific
10 Conference foes Oregon and
Arizona State, Stanford players
are the first to pay their
respects.
"They've got so much talent,"
said quarterback Steve Sten
strom. "We've got our work cut
out for us."
"They've been struggling,"

added inside linebacker Tom
Williams. "But the game is so
unpredictable in nature that it
doesn't mean anything."
For the Cardinal seniors, the
fact that they have not lost The
Axe since they arrived, places an
additional level of importance
on this Big Game. They have
made it clear that they don't
intend to let their perfect record
be blemished.
"It's the clash of the titans,"
said outside linebacker Ron
George. "We're 4-0 and they're
0-4. Who's going to walk away
with The Axe?"
Stanford players have adopt
ed a variety of psychological and
philosophical approaches to this
year's Big Game. Williams sees
the matchup as a clear case of
good versus evil.
"They don't like us and we
hate them," he said. "That's all
there is to it."
Defensive end Estevan Avila
registers his eagerness in terms
of Pavlovian response. "I'm
salivating at the mouth," he
said. "This is definitely the
biggest game for all of us. I
can't wait."
Garnett, book collector and
pragmatist, prefers the method
ical approach. "If we can main
tain the same style of every
thing, we'll come out on top," he
said. "It's the little things that
matter the most, so we've got to
study up on the details of the
game."
However, Garnett could not
contain his excitement. "We've
got to play our balls off," he con
ceded.
In the end, George managed
to accurately gauge the impor
tance of the game. "We could
play Miami for the national
championship and it wouldn't
be as big as this game," he said.
In the meantime, enterpris
ing students look to match the
players' enthusiasm and
respond to the timeless bear
track prank. With visibility high
on their list, a marauding band
trekked north to paint the "S'
and the "U" in the South San
Francisco sign Cardinal red.
"It's just a work of art," one
tall, skinny freshman from Rin
conada said. "I feel like a real
student now."
