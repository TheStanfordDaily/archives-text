# It's a gas
## Roble evacuated after late-night leak 
### Jeff Brock Editorial staff 
A small oven gas leak sent
about 250 Roble residents into
the chilly night air yesterday for
about 40 minutes.
According to Palo Alto fire
fighter Tom Rice, the gas that had
permeated part of the dorm came
from a bad fitting or an open
valve in the kitchen.
"We had to break into the din
ing room to get into the kitchen,"
Rice said. "There was minimal
damage."
He noted that Pacific Gas and
Electric will come out to verify the
fire department's determination.
"I missed a meeting because of
this," resident assistant Colleen

Horan said, pleading, "Please
print this so I'll have an excuse."
She noticed the smell at 9:25
p.m., as she was about to go to her
meeting. Third floor residents
also noticed the smell and called
down to her.
"You could smell it coming
down the stairs," sophomore
Drew Bamford said. Horan then
called the dispatch.
A police officer arrived, and
joined in the 3earch for the source
of the smell. "We were sniffing
around in the lounge like fools,"
Horan said.
The officer decided the leak
warranted pulling the fire alarm,
she said.
"I didn't really want to make a
scene," she laughed.
