# Celebration, education surround 'Malcolm X'
## 
### Janar Stewart Staff writer 
If campus activity is any indication, the
debate concerning Malcolm X the man
won't end with the premiere of "Malcolm
X," the movie.
The release of the movie and the media
hype surrounding it has prompted several
campus groups to organize panels and dorm
discussions in an effort to educate the com
munity about Malcolm X the man.
Despite the cloud of controversy hovering
over "Malcolm X," Elena Becks, program ad
ministrator for the Committee on Black Per
forming Arts, said she believed the film pro
vides many African-Americans with an op
portunity to reclaim their history.
"People can get the wrong message from

anything," Becks said, adding that igno
rance causes greater problems than any
movie can create.
Becks said most people know Malcolm X
for his famous phrase "by any means neces
sary," and this phrase taken out of context
leads many to misunderstand his message.
"It's a message of power and sharing
power — a lot of people think it means vio
lence," she said. "Self-defense was a tool,
not a philosophy."
The CBPA, in conjunction with senior
Bacardi Jackson of the Black Community
Services Center, bought 100 tickets for
today's 8:10 showing of "Malcolm X" and
sold them to students as a part of their film
series program, "Flicks of Black Folk."
Also this week, History Prof. Clay Car
son will talk about issues raised bv the film

in Potter House at 7 p.m. Friday before
opening the floor to discussion.
On Monday, Visiting Drama Prof. Victor
Walker will hold a small panel discussion in
Donner, and on Dec. 2, a panel of Stanford
professors, visiting professors and students
will discuss the man and the movie in Kres
ge Auditorium.
Jackson said she believed that Malcolm
X's message holds special meaning for
blacks at Stanford. Maicolm X preached
that the black community must learn to
love itself before black people can success
fully work with other people, she said.
Stanford students "have a lot of respon
sibility in dealing with people all around the
world," Jackson said.
"I hope (the film) will clear up misunder
standing about Malcolm X," she added.

Malcolm X was born in 1925 in Omaha,
Neb. While serving a prison term, he was in
troduced to the Nation of Islam and became
a Muslim minister upon his release in 1952.
Adopting the name El-Hajj Malik El-
Shabazz, he quickly became very prominent
in the movement. After being suspended
from it in 1963 by Elijah Muhammad, the
movement's founder, Malcolm X formed a
rival organization of his own the Muslim
Mosque, Inc. He urged black power and
racial separatism.
After a pilgrimage to Mecca, he an
nounced his conversion to orthodox Islam,
moderated his view, urged racial unity, split
with the Nation of Islam and founded the
Organization for Afro-American Unity in
1964.
He was assassinated at a
1965 Harlem rally at age 39,
allegedly by Nation of Islam fol
lowers.
Carson, who viewed the movie
after reading a copy of the script,
said he worried about some

aspects of the film at first. But
Director Spike Lee, who based
the movie on Alex Haley's auto
biography, smoothed out some
of these trouble spots in the film
version, and it "turned out bet
ter than I expected," Carson
added.
However, a few problems with
Lee's portrayal of Malcolm X
remain. "I hope that people don't
go to films to get their historical
understandings," Carson said.
