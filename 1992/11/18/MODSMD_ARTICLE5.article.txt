# Crothers Memorial to house graduate students next fall
## 
### Michelle Johnson 
After four years as a home for both graduates and
undergraduates, Crothers Memorial Hall will once
again become an all-graduate residence next fall, ac
cording to Stanford Housing Center Director William
Georges.
The change could add as many as 50 additional
graduate housing spaces.
The spaces are being added in spite of the current
surplus of graduate housing; for the first time in sev
eral years, Stanford now has 50 open spaces in its
graduate housing units, said Graduate Housing Su
pervisor Carmelite Ivery. Most of those spaces are in
Manzanita Park and Escondido Village high-rise
apartments.
The surplus is surprising in light of a 10 percent
increase in the enrollment of graduate students,
which was permitted as part of the University's

deficit-reduction plan.
The decision to fill Crothers Memorial entirely
with graduates was made recently by officials in the
Stanford Housing Center, the Office of Residential
Education and the Office of Graduate Residences,
Georges said. By housing undergraduate and gradu
ate students separately, it will be easier to tailor pro
grams to their needs, he said.
Although Crothers Memorial "was traditionally a
graduate residence," in 1988 the University moved
undergraduates into vacant spaces created by the
opening of the all-graduate Rains Houses, Georges
said. More undergraduates were moved into Crothers
Memorial after the 1989 earthquake damaged sever
al undergraduate residences.
The change at the 215-bed Crothers Memorial was
made possible by the construction of two houses on
the Knoll, Georges said. The Knoll houses, which are
scheduled open next fall, will have space for 180 un

dergraduates, and will allow the University to guar
antee four years' on-campus housing to undergradu
ates. This year's freshman class is the first to receive
the guarantee.
According to Georges, this year's on-campus grad
uate housing glut is largely due to the fact that many
continuing graduate students sought off-campus
housing. Some continuing students had been con
cerned that they would not get housing due to the in
crease in first-year graduate students this year, he ex
plained. First-year graduates are guaranteed hous
ing, while continuing graduate students are not.
"I think some continuing students gave up looking
for housing on campus early," Georges said.
The surplus may also be attributable to the con
version of Manzanita Park to all-graduate housing,
Georges said. In addition, a decrease in the number of
families seeking housing increased the availability of
single-student spaces, Ivery said.

Students with families are guaranteed on-campus
housing for four years, Ivery said. After families are
assigned housing, the remaining spaces are given to
couples and single graduate students. Georges said
the University makes family housing a priority be
cause it has traditionally been harder for students
with families to find off-campus housing.
Currently, Stanford has about 5,900 housing
spaces for undergraduate students and 3,000 spaces
for graduate students, Georges said Ninety-three
percent of undergraduates live on-campus, compared
to 42 percent of graduate students, he said.
Georges said the difference is partly due to gradu
ate students' housing preferences. "Many of them
never apply for on-campus housing," he said.
In the original lottery for this year's housing, 75
percent of graduate students who applied for campus
housing received an assignment,
Ivery said. More spaces opened
later when some students refused
their assignments, she added.
In the fall, all 149 students
who came to walk-ins were
offered an assignment, but "not
all students chose to take an
assignment," Ivery said.
Thus, some spaces are still
available and could be assigned
during walk-ins for the winter
quarter, she said.
This spring, Stanford will
begin a 10-year, $100 million ren
ovation of campus housing units,
Georges said. Escondido Village is
slated to be first graduate area to
be upgraded.
"As apartments empty, they
will go in and redo them,"
Georges said.
The renovated apartments will
have remodeled kitchens as well
as new furniture, carpet and
drapes. No housing fee increase
will result from the remodeling,
Georges said.
