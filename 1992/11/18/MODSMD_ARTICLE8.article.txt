Not everyone gets the opportu
nity to protect dignitaries like
Mikhail Gorbachev, the Queen of
England and presidents of the
United States.
But Raoul Niemeyer has done
all three as captain of the Stanford
Police Department — it's those
kind of assignments that makes
being a policeman on a college
campus most exciting, he said.
But Niemeyer's job is not sim
ply celebrities and action, and in
many cases it's far from idyllic
work
"Unfortunately, every once in a
while, there are homicide cases on
campus," he sighed.
There was the 1982 murder of
Angela Arvidson, a Stanford stu
dent working part-time at a profes
sor's house. Angela's body, nearly
decapitated, was found at the
house by the professor's teenage
son. Niemeyer solved that case and
the murderer was convicted.
"People are lulled into a false
sense of security," Niemeyer said
about the Stanford campus.
"A large number of students
become victims of robbery because

they leave their dorm doors open,"
said Niemeyer, who oversees all
the department's investigations.
"Car break-ins and theft of
stereo equipment are common
crimes," he said, adding that bike
theft is much more widespread
than people assume.
Niemeyer's co-workers call him
by such terms of endearments as
"dinosaur" (because he has been
at Stanford for a long time),
"Nimo" and "A-Tree" (derived
from his A3 radio call sign).
Although police work can be
dangerous, the 54-year-old
Niemeyer has been lucky Only
once has he been assaulted by a
suspect.
It happened on his first job, as a
Santa Clara patrol officer. He was
pursuing a drunk driver who re
fused to pull over — turning the
pursuit into a mt\jor chase involv
ing 15 patrol cars.
After the car finally pulled over,
Niemeyer approached the driver
and was socked in the face.
In a less serious situation,
Niemeyer was knocked off his feet
by a 68-year-old woman who had

for so many years.
