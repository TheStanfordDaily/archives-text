Russ Calleros doesn't pass ordinary notes during
class.
He and his friends are passing around a petition
which aims to change Columbus Day to Indigenous
People's Day in the City of Palo Alto.
Calleros, a Latino junior who lives in Muwekma-
Tah-Ruk, announced that he was going to circulate
a petition on Oct. 9 at the Quincentennial Rally.
That weekend, he started making petition packets
and circulated them among his friends, Calleros said.
He plans to submit more than 1,000 signatures
within the next couple of weeks and hopes for a
response from city officials by mid-December,
Calleros said. So far he has distributed 24 packets
which each have space for 30 signatures, he added.
In addition, one person is circulating the petition
among alumni, Calleros said.
Berkeley is currently the only city in the United
States to celebrate Indigenous People's Day in place
of Columbus Day.
"I think [Berkeley's celebration] is extraordinary.
I think it would be extraordinary for the City of Palo
Alto to follow their lead," he said.
Calleros said he sees irony in the celebration of
Columbus Day. "There are only two holidays honor

ing men who aren't presidents — Martin Luther
King Day and Columbus Day.
"Here is one man, King, who tried to protect peo
ple from the threat of racism. Here's another,
Columbus. . . who essentially helped develop
racism," he said. "You ask yourself why they Eire
both honored."
Calleros plans to submit more
than 1,000 signatures within the
next couple of weeks.
Calleros approached the Stanford American Indi
an Organization with his plans for the petitions.
"He came to one of our meetings and presented the
petition to our community. We wholeheartedly sup
ported him. Members of our community have been
distributing it," said SAIO co-chair Isabelle Bour
relle.
The petition states in part: "The 500 th anniver
sary of Columbus' arrival should not make us think of
conquest, but of pain — a pain that exists in the many
drops of blood that stain the pages of history. This
stain reminds of a struggle that is still not over."
