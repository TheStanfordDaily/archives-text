# One hundred years down, Big Game ready to go
## Rally marks 100th anniversary of rivalry 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Stanford's official pre-Big
Game festivities will kick off today
with a rally commemorating a
century of Cardinal-Weenie rival
ry, Big Game Gaieties and the tra
ditional bonfire at Lake Lagunita.
This year's Big Game is the
100 th anniversary of the original
contest between Stanford and
UC-Berkeley, but only the 95th
Big Game actually played be
cause all football games were can
celed during World Wars I and 11.
Guests at this afternoon's
rally will include Heisman trophy
winner Jim Plunkett, 49ers star
Gene Washington, two members
of the Immortal 21, the Stanford
Band and many other famous
and infamous Stanford athletic

personalities.
Master of ceremonies will be
Bob Murphy, radio voice for
Stanford sports.
Athletes from past Big Games
will recount memorable mo
ments and photos from the first
Big Game in 1892 will be dis
played on a large screen.
Former yell leaders will also
teach current students the Axe
yell as a part of the rally.
Part of the program will seek
to teach students about past cus
toms surrounding the game.
"People don't know about tradi
tions like the decorations that the
Row houses once built to celebrate
Big Game weekend," said Karen
Bartholomew, a member of the
Stanford Historical Society. The
society is co-sponsoring the event
with the Department of Athletics.

"We're hoping to stimulate
more interest in the Big Game
and teach the newer generation
about traditions of the past and
bring back some of these old tra
ditions," she said.
The rally will held at 4:15 p.m.
at Burnham Pavilion and is open
to all students, faculty and alum
ni without charge.
Later tonight, "Achtung Wee
nie," this year's Gaieties, opens
at 7:30 in Memorial Auditorium.
After the show, the pre-game
hoopla will continue with the Big
Game Bonfire at Lake Lag.
It has burned every year since
1897, except between 1975 and
1985, when administrators
banned it for safety reasons.
"The bonfire," said Bar
ltholomew, "is one of the traditions
that has lasted through the years."
