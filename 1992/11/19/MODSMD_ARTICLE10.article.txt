ISI J\MABAD, Pakistan (AP) -
The government arrested former
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
and her top advisers at a huge
political rally yesterday after they
defied a ban on protests and
demanded the overthrow of the
government.
Bhutto had threatened that
100,000 marchers would storm
Parliament. But the march, sched
uled to begin 10 miles from the
capital in Rawalpindi, was disrupt
ed before it began.
Police barricaded the march
route, fired tear gas into the crowd
and beat protesters. In the capital,
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
imposed emergency measures and
troops patrolled in machine-gun
mounted trucks.
"My arrest won't make any dif

ference. The struggle will contin
ue," Bhutto said in a brief speech
to about 40,000 of her supporters
at a Rawalpindi park.
After the speech, she and party
leaders were surrounded by 200
police and taken away.
Bhutto agreed to board a plane
for Karachi after the government
promised to release all opposition
party supporters who were mem
bers of Parliament.
Bhutto, an articulate politician
with a well-tested ability to
attract crowds, says that Sharifs
Islamic government is corrupt
and repressive and rose to power
through rigged elections. She
wants President Ghulam Ishaq
Khan to establish an interim gov
ernment that would oversee new
elections.

But her demands are unlikely
to be met. Sharifs government has
a solid majority in Parliament, and
Ishaq Khan makes no secret of his
contempt for Bhutto.
Bhutto herself was dismissed
from office in August 1990 for
alleged corruption, nepotism and
abuse of power.
Ten people were seriously
injured in other protests yesterday
in Peshawar, and a dozen were
hurt in Lahore, including a police
man who was set on fire.
Bhutto's left-leaning Pakistan
People's Party called for more
demonstrations today.
Sharif s special adviser, Chaudry
Nisar All, said if Bhutto continues
to call for marches, the government
will take the same steps to stop
them as were used yesterday.
