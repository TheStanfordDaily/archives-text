## Reinstate F, integrity 
### 
Bringing back the F will
make Stanford's grading
policies more effective

COLLEGE STUDENTS every
where have long played the
game of academic roulette,
placing their money on the courses
most likely to pay the highest
returns.
In weighing the odds, students
must decide whether to drop a
class at the first sign of trouble, or
wait it out and take their chances
on the final; whether to choose the
pass/no-credit option or cast their
lot with high-risk, high-yield letter
grades, running all the time the
risk of an F: the academic equiva
lent of bankruptcy.
At Stanford, however, the odds
are skewed distinctly in the stu
dents' favor — at the expense of the
institution's academic integrity.
The University maintains what
essentially is a no-failure grade
policy. The F has been banished
from official University records,
including the sacred recorder of
academic deeds, the transcript.
The recent Faculty Senate deci
sion to examine the idea of reviv
ing the 'F' is a crucial step towards
restoring the health of Stanford's
grading system and, correspond
ingly, its credibility. Many students
herald the current policy as partial
relief from the stress of an intense
academic environment. But in
reality the no-failure position has
caused a significant amount of aca
demic distortion.
Because a student cannot receive
an F, a letter grade of D, which
appears prominently on a tran
script, represents true alphabetic
horror. Thus arises the ironic situa
tion of a student who writes an
impassioned plea at the end of a
final exam that if his or her final
grade is below a C, the professor
should issue a failing grade.
Furthermore, students with a
poor average going into the final

may take the exam just to see if
they have the potential to do well.
If the exam proves difficult and the
likelihood of a decent grade slim, a
student can simply fold the exam
into his or her pocket, walk out the
door and fail the course with no
ensuing repercussions.
Though the University attempts
to prevent such action by allowing
the dropping of classes up until the
final exam has begun, the system of
non-failure effectively undermines
this policy.
The vanishing F hides the fact
that a student has not been able to
handle the content of a certain class.
He or she had the opportunity to
drop the class or get help before
things got to such a critical level.
Should a student decide to ride out a
course to the bitter end, then the
grade received should remain.
An important qualification to this
is that students should have the
opportunity to retake a course in
which he or she is not satisfied with
the grade. Currently the University
allows this and goes so far as to
replace the old grade with the new
one. This is entirely consistent with
the belief that a grade reflects grasp
of a subject area, with one exception.
The transcript should indicate,
through an asterisk or other appro
priate symbol, that a course was
taken twice. Only the final grade
should appear — as this reflects the
students ultimate performance in
the class — but the asterisk would
indicate that twice the normal peri
od of time was needed to obtain
such a level of comprehension.
On the whole, Stanford's aca
demic policy provides much-need
ed flexibility and independence for
students. The liberal deadline for
dropping and adding a course
allows students to evaluate and
revise their academic programs
according to their changing per
sonal needs, whatever the circum
stances. Reinstating the 'F' with
the option to retake a failed course
and replace the grade received
would restore balance and credibil
ity to the current system.
