ASSU Program Board is not the 'Program Police'

IT IS OBVIOUS THAT the authors
of the editorial, "Fair ASSU Fund
ing," (Nov. 11) have absolutely no
concept of the Program Board funding
process.
While the Stanford student body can
not expect The Daily to know every
thing, they can expect the Editorial
Board to do research before penning asi
nine editorials.
The Program Board is an allocation
committee made up of student volun
teers whose job it is to review dozens of
funding requests for a multitude of pro
gramming-related activities each quar
ter.
Groups applying for funding are
interviewed and closely questioned
about each line item on their budgets.
The Program Board then discusses
and debates the presented requests for
funding and allocates money to stu
dent groups based on demonstrated
need.
If last week was "the first display of

oversight in recent memory" then it is
only because the Program Board has
been more concerned with allocating
money to student groups who need it
than with holding the hands of those
who put on the programs.
The editorial raises two issues: it
questions the decision of the Program
Board to release the hold on funds for
Stanford Students for Life; and it ques
tions the use of board allocations by
groups.
After the debate, the Program Board
spoke to students that were not affiliat
ed with either Stanford Students for
Life or the Pro-Choice Alliance.
All felt that it was an intellectual
debate with both sides represented by
parties who were articulate and forceful
in presenting their arguments.
After speaking extensively with
members of Stanford Students for Life
regarding the debate and its planning
the Board concluded that the program
that was presented during the interview

process was essentially the program that
occurred.
At no time was the issue of responsi
bility for the debate in question; the
Stanford Students for Life were, and
are, ultimately responsible for the pro
gram that occurred under their sponsor
ship, just as the Editorial Board is ulti
mately responsible for anything that is
printed in its name.
As for the ability of the Program
Board to "ensure that groups execute
their programs as stated in their fund
ing requests," we have two responses.
The Stanford Honor Code, requires
students adhere to a level of integrity
and honesty in their activities and
behavior regarding themselves, other
students and their activities at Stanford
University.
The Program Board has no reason to
believe that students will behave in any
manner that would violate the Honor
Code.
Second, money that is allocated to

student groups is allocated by specific
line item, and students are not allowed,
per ASSU procedure, to use that money
for any other purpose.
The statement made by the Editorial
Board that, "Groups are expected to do
their homework before hosting campus
wide events" is ironically appropriate in
application to The Daily coverage of this
event.
It seems that the Editorial Board
should heed their own advice. At no time
was any member of the Program Board
contacted by the Editorial Board regard
ing an explanation of the funding pro
cess.
The Program Board's job is to deter
mine whether a program that is funded
by us is solidly planned and falls within
the guidelines for allocations. It is not a
censorship board — we are not the Pro
gram Police.
