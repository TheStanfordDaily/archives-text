# Cro Mem should be a place for undergrads and grads

### 
The Stanford Housing Center's deci
sion to fill Crothers Memorial Hall pure
ly with graduate students is another
indication of the segregationist attitudes
that have tainted the Stanford experi
ence of many people like me; I'm a first
year grad student.
Reading that the Housing Center con
tends that "it will be easier to tailor pro
grams to lour) needs," by separating
graduates from undergraduates evokes
images of a correctional facility or men
tal institution.
The typical undergraduate that Hous
ing has in mind is probably someone

who cannot bear associating with people
over 22, who doesn't miss seeing chil
dren around more than once a year and
who regards the idea of having faculty
residents in his or her dorm as a waste
of University money and a threat to his
or her lifestyle.
And it would strain my imagination
to try and guess the Housing Center's
psychological profile of graduate stu
dents. Some of us wear our old
sorority/fraternity T-shirts because we
can't believe we've already graduated.
Some of us must live off-campus because
we need a covered parking spot for the
Porsche acquired on Wall Street. And
some of us do not care where we are
housed, because, as Medical Students,
we do not sleep.
But the one thing we seem to have in

common — except for those fortunate
few who were Stanford undergrads — is
that we do not know whether "Roble" is
a gym or a dorm, whether "Zapp House"
is a real place or a coded indication that
someone does not wish to divulge their
whereabouts or whether Food Service
ever serves lasagna.
Other schools have a graduate stu
dent resident in every undergraduate
living group, to reduce the stress of liv
ing with a narrowly defined age group.
Here, graduate students are held in such
low regard that undergraduate Resident
Assistants pretend to make sure we have
a life! Clearly, more apartheid housing is
not a way to ease this situation.
