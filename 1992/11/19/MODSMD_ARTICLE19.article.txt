## Lights, action, culture 
### 
Albuquerque became a
brightening mess of lights in our
rear view mirror as my friend and I
headed south along Route 25, praising
home, Stanford and all the land between.
Two thousand miles from the Con
necticut turnpike, my friend and I were
in the New Mexico desert just after the
sun fell behind the mountains, leaving
only our car and the scorched plains
beneath a vast red glow. Suddenly, we
passed a small, brightly lit cross planted
on top of a hill off the side of the road.
Against the blackness, 50 or so light
bulbs gave shape to the symbol of all that
makes me scared and ecstatic to be alive.
With nothing else to the left or right of
us, I wished there had been a small
church which we could have pulled off
the road and walked to in the dark: not a
looming edifice like my hometown episco
pal church, which for so many years had
been the cradle of all my beliefs and
prayers, but a small one-room church in
the middle of nowhere which would wel
come a stranger and all his strange con
fusion.
A place where I could sit down with
the congregation of myself, chant all my
newfound fears and doubts of the past
few years, and imagine the taste of bread
and wine which I have tasted less and
less. I could remember my seven years as
an acolyte in the Christ Church parish of
Greenwich, Conn. — a little boy sure of

heaven above the blue sky, tall grasses,
flowing waters, my stillborn brother and
the grandfather I never knew.
As a freshman at Stanford, I confront
ed the inevitable task to make 8 a.m. ser
vices in a parish full of priests, families
and friends not my own. Attendance soon
fell to zero times a month, and I tried to
console myself by thinking this was what
God wanted: to sever myself from my
past religious upbringing, and later come
to realize how rooted in the church my
spirituality really was.
My forced consolation, however,
turned to confusion, and I began to think
about what I was missing, how depen
dent my faith had become on the concept
of Sunday morning Eucharist.
And though I considered this to be a
time of confusion, I still felt anchored to
the principles I had grown up with,
regardless of how lazy or questioning I
had become. As far as I was concerned,
this was what college was all about, and
the element of struggle would be good for
me.
But when I fell for a Jewish girl, every
thing slipped and whirled around me. All
the emotions, all the questions — and
there was no way I could ever believe
again that God could only want homoge
neous relationships. It didn't make sense,
it ridiculed everything I thought religion
was or should be about.
This was the kind of thing a Christian

boy should stay away from, right? It
would just make things more difficult,
right?
But should ease and prudence always
be our guide? And when these days pro
vide a spiritual intensity commensurate
with all the hundreds of Sundays, I'll go
on trying to reconcile.
Perhaps all my doubts and confusions
since freshman year really are part of
some sort of "time of severance." Per
haps this wrangle with the notions of a
Second Coming, a paradise as an eternal
reflection of everything we love and cher
ish about life on earth, is nothing more
than a passing test of endurance. Per
haps none of us will never know.
But when the Dean of the Chapel of
Memorial Church describes its art as
"Christianity in your face," and when a
parking lot filled with the same cars
throughout separates my church from its
neighboring synagogue, we must remem
ber that blood flows from the heart and
not the culture.
