# Overzealous fan arrested for hanging sign
## 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
A 62-year-old Stanford fan
was arrested early yesterday
morning while hanging a "Beat
Cal" banner and effigies of the
UC-Berkeley football team in
front of Kepler's Books and Mag
azines in Menlo Park.
Peter Hall was trying to hang
the items in front of the Menlo
Center facing El Camino Real at
about 4 a.m. when Menlo Park
police confronted him.
Hall, a University of Michigan
alumnus who has "adopted Stan
ford," was with two other Stan
ford alumni of similar ages.
When police responded to a
complaint about suspicious activ

ity, Hall wouldn't tell police his
name and was arrested, accord
ing to Menlo Park Police Capt.
Dominick Peloso.
"Hall refused to identify him
self and was brought into the sta
tion," Peloso said. "We cited him
for obstructing an officer's inves
tigation, and he refused to sign the
citation so we had to book him."
Hall was taken to the San
Mateo County Jail in Redwood
City, according to Peloso, where
he was later released.
Despite the fact that Hall is
only charged with a misde
meanor, "like a traffic citation,
when you refuse to sign it, we will
take you to jail," Peloso said.
Hall, who is a stockbroker at
the Dean Witter office on the sec

ond floor of the Menlo Center, in
sisted that he had permission
from the building's owner to
hang the banner.
The Menlo Management com
pany, which runs the Menlo Cen
ter, did not return phone calls
from The Daily yesterday.
Hall said that he and his fellow
"old fart Stanford cohorts" had
hung the same banner last year
and had not had any problems.
Although Hall was charged
only with obstructing an officer
for refusing to give his name, he
may face charges of defacing
property, Peloso said.
The case will be forwarded to
the San Mateo County District
Attorney, who will determine
whether to proceed with the case.
