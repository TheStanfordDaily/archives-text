## Lowdown on Cal: No honey for Bears under new coach 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
If Cal backers thought first-year coach Keith
Gilbertson would pick up where the departed Bruce
Snyder left ofT, they have been bitterly disappointed.
The Bears had supposedly solidified their status as
one of the Pacific 10 Conference's preeminent pro
grams with postseason bowl appearances in the last
two seasons.
The 1991 season was an amazing one for Cal, as
they finished 10-2, ranked No. 6 in the final wire ser
vice polls. After losing only to Washington and Stan
ford in the regular season, they clobbered Clemson in
the New Year's Day Florida Citrus Bowl.
That top 10 season was built upon the Bears 8-4
finish in 1990, topped off by a victory over Wyoming
in the Copper Bowl.
Those lofty East Bay illusions of perpetual nation
al prominence came crashing down in the first 10
games of 1992. Cal lost only six starters from last
year's squad and they were a consensus pre-season
top 20 pick. But Gilbertson and his Bears were hum
bled, 41-14, by a lowly Purdue club in week two, and
have mustered only three wins since.
Most disappointing has been their performance in
the Pac-10. The Bears lie tied for eighth place at 2-5
(4-6 overall), and their lone victories have come over
conference doormats UCLA and Oregon State.
Only in the last two weeks, however, has Cal shown
to what depths a once-proud team can sink. Not only
did they lose to mediocre Oregon and Arizona State,
but the Bears were never really in either game.
Though the season's six losses have garnered the
headlines in Berkeley, they haven't quite overshad
owed a few remarkable individual campaigns.
Wide receiver Sean Dawkins and tailback Russell
White have again turned in season-long impressive per
formances as part of an otherwise unspectacular unit.
Dawkins is far and away the Pac-10's premier
receiver and a good bet to receive All-American acco
lades. He has pulled down 56 receptions, 12 of them
for touchdowns, and is only 74 yards from a 1,000-
yard season. All of this after the graduation of quar

terback Mike Pawlawski, last year's Pac-10 Co-Offen
sive Player of the Year.
Touted much of the season as a Heisman candi
date, White is on the verge of his third consecutive
1,000-yard season, a feat matched in Pac-10 history
only by USC's Charles White and Anthony Davis.
The Bears' image has certainly not been but
tressed by comparisons to their cross-bay rivals. And
as the Bay Area's "other" new head coach, Gilbertson
has suffered through more than his share of those
comparisons.
While Bill Walsh has led the Cardinal to a major
bowl bid against one of the NCAA's toughest sched
ules, Gilbertson's head coaching debut has been less
than a smashing success.
But Cal's head man feels being held up against the
Stanford standard isn't quite fair.
"I look at our team and see 32 of our top 44 players
coming back," Gilbertson says."I look at Stanford
and I see a veteran, senior-dominated team.
"(We have) a lot of young guys playing right now,
and I see a lot of good things for our future."
Berkeley boosters are hoping that future
arrives real soon, say, Saturday. A losing season is
a losing season, and the Bears are already guaran
teed one.
Still, as those who have spent the last few years on
the Farm can attest, finishing 5-6 with The Axe in
your grasp isn't so bad.
