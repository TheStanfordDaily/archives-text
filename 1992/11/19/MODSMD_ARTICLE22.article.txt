# Golden Bears' 13 unlucky thoughts for a Cardinal-colored Big Game
## 
### 
In keeping with "Impassioned Tome
Week" at The Daily sports office, here are
13 final thoughts to serve as a Stanford
fan's easy-to-read Big Game guide and to
spell trouble for those dirty, triskaideka
phobic Bears on Saturday:
TT7e have Bill Walsh and his three
VV Super Bowl rings at the helm. They
have former Washington offensive coor
dinator Keith Gilbertson . . . Makes you
contemplate just how dominant Wash
ington's defense must have been in 1990
and '91.
Ever wonder why Stanford maintained
dominance over its cross-Bay
(cough!) rivals (cough!) in recent years?
Coaching and discipline may have had
something to do with it: Dennis Green's
Vikings are now 7-3, three games up on
the field in the NFC Central and on their
way to the playoffs; Bruce Snyder's Ari
zona State Sun Devils are 5-5, 15-to-life
in nonconference action and on their way
into and out of the Maricopa County
"facility." Not coincidentally, Brian Treg

gs still has an apartment somewhere in
Palo Alto.
Victory in Big Game would be as sim
ple as 1-2-3 Cardinal senior classes in
a row that know what it's like to roast
Weenies to perfection. For the folks in
Berzerkeley, this "Bear" fact must make
recruiting only slightly easier than solic
iting George McGovern voters in Orange
County in 1972.
Everyone knows that perennial "pow
erhouse" Purdue walloped the Wee
nies (41-14, for those keeping score) ear
lier this season. But did you know that
Purdue also lost to Notre Dame and
Northwestern — is this beginning to
sound familiar?
George, Garnett, Glyn, Gordon,
Genius on the sidelines, Goliaths in
the offensive line, Green's legacy, Gar
gantuan GPA's. Cal's Axe hopes? Going,
Going, Gone.
Oh, my knee hurts! Must be that love
ly, fresh-cut California Memorial
Stadium Astro Turf. I won't say that an

all-weather surface is completely unnec
essary in a place where all the weather
consists of sun and about two weeks of
rain, but thoughts of solar flashlights
and/or selling refrigerators to Eskimos do
come to mind.

Time running out, Stanford down by
two with the ball at the Weenie 10-
yard-line and everything on the line.
While the above situation is highly
unlikely to occur Saturday, it is comfort
ing to know that freshman placekicking
phenom Eric Abrams is money in the

bank. There's no telling if Abrams can
repeat John Hopkins' five-field goal per
formance of two years ago, but it is fairly
certain that if the tables were turned,
Cal's Doug Jirien still wouldn't have
enough first names to put the ball
through the uprights.
Thirty-one to 10 Stanford, if you must
know what I think the score of the
95th Big Game will be.
His eyes are out, he's got the gout, he
knows not what it's all about. No,
I'm speaking not about the referee who
failed to abort the 1982 Big Game after
the first, second, third or fourth time that
it should have been whistled dead, but of
that dirty Golden Bear itself — Oski.
Endless conjecture over which bowl
games will accept or reject the Cardi
nal is nice, but three things are impor
tant to bring out of it: 1) Stanford will
almost assuredly ring in 1993 with a New
Year's Day contest if it wins Big Game; 2)
USC, the only other Pac-10 team except
Washington with a shot at Jan. 1, must

face arch-rival UCI.A and Notre Dame —
to whom they are trying to avoid a 10th
straight loss — in the next two weeks, so
it looks like Larry Smith just may find his
Freedom after all; and 3) California has
absolutely no shot at any bowl game in
1992.
Apologies given if the last statement
sounded complacent, but far be it for
me not to tell the truth, or for any of that
sentiment to rub off on our Cardinal
squad, who would face the Weenies in
Antarctica in July (think about it) if that's
what it took to protect the beloved Blade.
X After nearly four years of abated
• anticipation, Spike Lee's biographi
cal film was finally released yesterday.
Excuse me for being so bold, but WE
GOT IN. BEAT CAL!

Andy Eiser, one of the Daily's sitting
duck sports editors, wonders how the cop
in"The Industrial City" felt when he
looked up the hill the next day after let
ting a caravan pass at 1 a.m.
