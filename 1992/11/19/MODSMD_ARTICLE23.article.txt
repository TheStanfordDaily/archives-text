# Stanford faces Blue and Gold
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Amidst the frenzy of Big Game week, the
Stanford basketball team faces off this evening
against an opponent clad in Blue-and-Gold.
The Cardinal opens the exhibition season
tonight in Maples Pavilion against the Blue and
Gold Fleet, an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU)
team based in San Francisco and comprised of
former college players.
Tonight's exhibition is the first of two, which
will also include a game against the New Zealand
National Team on Monday night. This will be
the first chance coach Mike Montgomery will
have to put his team on the floor in a game situ
ation, but Montgomery views these upcoming
exhibitions as the display of a 'work-in-progress.'
"We're working through to December,"
Montgomery said, alluding to the regular-sea
son opener on Dec. 2 against the University of
Puget Sound.
Stanford's emphasis on outside shooting and
the transition game should be evident against the
Blue and Gold Fleet. "We lack a dominant physi
cal presence inside — an Adam Keefe, an Andrew
Vlahov, an Eric Reveno ... so we've made some
adjustments in what we're trying to do."
No adjustment was needed, though, in the
backcourt, where senior guards Marcus Lollie
and Peter Dukes anchor the Cardinal. The excit
ing Brent Williams returns at the small forward
spot, with Todd Manley and Bart Lammersen
rounding out the starting five.
The Blue and Gold Fleet features 11 players
who played at St. Mary's College. They are led
by 6-foot-10 center Eric Bamberger, who aver
aged 15.2 points per game last season for the
Gaels. Other prominent St. Mary's players on
the Fleet roster are David Carter, Dan Curry
and A 1 Lewis, all of whom helped the Gaels qual
ify for the NCAA Tournament in 1988-89.
Card Notes:
Admission to tonight's exhibition game at 7:30 p.m.
is free, and the game will finish well before the start
of tonight's Big Game Bonfire in Lake Lagunita at
10 p.m. . . .Sophomore guard David Harbour will
redshirt the 1992-93 season to undergo surgery on
his right thumb, which was injured in a summer
water-skiing accident. .. .Stanford was picked to
finish seventh in the conference in a poll of Pac-10
basketball media. Arizona was picked to finish first.
