# History of Big Game rivalry on 100th anniversary
## 
### Oscar Dominguez Staff writer 
On March 19, 1892, 11 men in red jerseys lined up
against 11 opponents in blue shirts and began what
would become one of the most celebrated rivalries in
college football.
The game, a 14-10 Cardinal victory over the Uni
versity of California, marked the beginning of Stan
ford's intercollegiate competition and proved to be an
indication of the rich football history the school would
enjoy. Despite the fact that the Golden Bears had 10
years of experience over their opponents, the original
gridiron Cardinal beat a bigger and heavier Cal team
before an unexpectedly large crowd of about 20,000.
Back then, the field was 110 yards long, touch
downs were worth four points and Stanford had no
official coach. The original Big Game was played in

San Francisco on the Haight Street Grounds and the
Cardinal captain was John B. Whittemore, who led his
team of starters the entire 100 minutes of the game.
Some of the rules have changed, and so have the
names, but the tradition of the Big Game lives on
today, over 100 years after its inception.
Since then, coaches like Walter Camp, "Pop" Warn
er, Chuck Taylor, Bill Walsh and Denny Green have
added their names to the history of Big Game. Stan
ford's first All-American, Jim Lawson, and subse
quent stars like Ernie Nevers, Jim Plunkett and John
Elway have arisen to lead the Cardinal into the battle
by the Bay. Other changes include the Stanford nick
name which went from Cardinals to Indians to Cardi
nal.
Tradition has played a major role in this classic
series and no other symbol symbolizes the rivalry
more than the fabled Axe. The Axe was originally pur

chased in 1899 by Stanford student Bill Erb, who
painted a red "S" on it and used it to decapitate an effi
gy of the Cal Bear at a bonfire before the last game of
a baseball series.
The Axe was stolen afler the game by a group of
Berkeley students and kept in a vault for 31 years. In
1930, the Immortal 21, a faithful group of Stanford
students reclaimed The Axe and three years later it
was agreed upon by both parties that the winner of the
Big Game would hold The Axe until the next meeting
of the two schools.
There have been ups and downs throughout the his
tory of the competition, including the first Cardinal loss
to Cal in 1899 (Stanford led the series 4-0-3 up to the
defeat) and the temporary disappearance of football
between 1906 and 1917, when rugby was played instead.
There was also a time between 1915 and 1919 when
the two schools did not compete because of a dispute
over the eligibility of freshmen. But the biggest and
most well-known disappointment in the series for the
Cardinal is undoubtedly "The Play."
Anyone who knows college football has heard about
or seen the play in the 1982 Big Game that cost Stan
ford The Axe that year. Trailing 20-19 with only sec
onds left on the clock, Cal received a kickoff on their
43-yard line, following a Mark Harmon field goal and
a 15-yard penalty against Stanford. With a win seem
ingly in the bag, the Stanford Band ran onto the field,
but afler a five-lateral, 57-yard return, Kevin Moen
rumbled into the end zone, running over trombonist
Gary Tyrell for the winning score.
There have been equally exciting Cardinal wins
including the 1990 Big Game when "The Play II" was
the result of a similarly miraculous chain of events.
Down 25-17, the Cardinal mounted a dramatic 87-
yard touchdown drive orchestrated by quarterback
Jason Palumbis. The Cardinal then had the option of
tying with a kick or winning with a successful two
point converson. Head coach Green went for the sec
ond alternative and the Palumbis pass was intercept
ed by Cal corner John Hardy.
With only 17 seconds left on the clock, the Cal fans
streamed onto the field and the Bears were penalized
15 yards for a delay of game. The Cardinal went for an
onside kick which was successfully recovered. After a
roughing the passer call against the Bears, Stanford
had the ball on the Cal 22. With time running out,
John Hopkins drove through the winning field goal,
leaving the final score 27-25 Stanford.
Overall, the series record favors the Cardinal, which
has a 46-37-12 edge over the Bears. The gnmes have
been close for the most part, with 43 Big Games having
been decided by one touchdown or less. Stanford has
kept posession of The Axe for the past five years.
The numbers, the history, the tradition and the
genuine rivalry all point to yet another classic Big
Game in 1992.
