# Greeks channel spirit into charity benefit
## 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
A group of fraternities and sororities, hoping to
channel students' upbeat Big Game spirit into
worthy causes, are sponsoring a charity benefit
party tonight.
A donation of either old clothing of a can of food
will be required to enter the party, to be held at
Sigma Chi after the Big Game Bonfire, according
to Sigma Chi social chair Jerry Lewis.
"Because of Big Game, there is a lot of opportu
nity to get out the campus . . . and potentially have
500 to 600 people come to the house and give to
charity," Lewis said.
The party is sponsored by Delta Tau Delta,
Kappa Sigma, Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha
Theta and Kappa Kappa Gamma, as well as Sigma
Chi, Lewis said.
The Greek organizations will also hold a closed
pre-party before the bonfire in the Delta Tau
Delta House to collect more clothing and canned
food.
"If we can motivate the Greek community, we
have a lot of power to do some good," Lewis said.
Clothing will be donated to the Salvation Army,
according to Lewis, and canned food will be dis
tributed to local food banks.
This is the first year any fraternities and soror
ities have sponsored a party related to Big Game
for charity, according to Lewis, and he said next
year he hopes an event could be organized to in
clude all campus Greek organizations.
