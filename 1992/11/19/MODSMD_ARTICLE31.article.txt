A lampful of new
tricks and stock
marriage themes

Aladdin

Sometimes a film comes along that is so
innovative that it rewrites the textbook on
how films of that kind should be made.
Walt Disney's "Aladdin" is not that film.
"Aladdin" is the story of a street urchin
named Aladdin who dreams of becoming a
prince. He meets the lovely princess Jas
mine, who dreams of being free to marry
for love, but is forced by law to marry a
prince. When Aladdin gets a hold of the
magic lamp, he uses it to become a prince,
but discovers that royalty alone can't win
Jasmine's heart.
Sounds good so far. Unfortunately, "Al
addin" is derivative of recent Disney releas
es, "Beauty and the Beast" and"The Little
Mermaid." The whole boy-meets-girl, boy
loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back formula has
gotten stale. Worst of all, the romance feels
forced, taking a back seat to the adventures

of Aladdin and the Genie.
The songs are as formulaic as the film. "A
Whole New World" is "Aladdin's version of
"Beauty and The Beast"; "Friend Like Me"
is a reworking of "Be Our Guest."
Disney has made virtually no attempt to
steep the music in a Middle Eastern tradi
tion. Except for the stereotypically offensive
song "Arabian Nights,all of the other
songs sound like they've been lifted from a
Broadway musical.
What saves "Aladdin" from being a
total write-off is Robin Williams' Genie.
Williams is irrepressible and shameless as
he imparts his nervous energy to the char
acter. His Genie is well-versed in pop cul
ture, impersonating everyone from
Robert DeNiro to Jack Nicholson to Arse
nio Hall.
"Aladdin'"s strength is in its animation.
Disney has opted for a curved, fluid carica
ture style, where one shape flows smoothly
and naturally into another. Though very
different from the linear style of "Beauty
and the Beast," it is just as effective.
Disney has also made impressive leaps
with its computer graphics. In one scene a
tiger's head rises up from the ground to be
come the Cave of Wonders, where Aladdin
procures his lamp. The flying carpet ride
through the collapsing cave, though remi
niscent of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom," is impressive nonetheless. The
cave, lava, explosions and falling rocks are
all computer-generated.
Ultimately, "Aladdin" is trapped by Dis
ney's increasingly formulaic approach to its
animated films. Disney studio chief Jeffrey
Katzenberg is intimately involved in each
film's production, and it shows. Perhaps if
he leaves the artists alone, future Disney
films will venture to the cutting edge in
stead of playing it safe.
But the most disturbing aspect of recent
Disney' films is their obsession with mar
riage. Doesn't anyone just shack up any
more like Snow White and the dwarfs did in
the past? Is 90 minutes really enough time
to decide you love someone? Has Dan
Quayle taken over Disney to ensure that
someone makes movies that he can under
stand?
Oh well. There's always "The Simpsons"
on Thursday night.

Johnny Stecchino

If you like slapstick and miss Jerry Lewis
movies then "Johnny Stecchino" is just the
film for you.
Written and directed by lead actor Rober
to Benigni, "Johnny Stecchino" is your typi
cal mistaken-identity farce. Johnny Stecchi
no (Benigni) — meaning "Johnny Tooth
pick" — is a petty mobster who rats on his
mafia brothers and then goes into hiding,
plotting a way to escape from Sicily to South
America.
Eighteen months later in Rome — when
Stecchino's wife Maria (Nicoletta Braschi)
stumbles upon Dante (also played by Benig
ni), an affable, banana-stealing bus driver
who is a dead ringer for Stecchino — it
seems that all of Johnny's problems are
solved.
Maria lures Dante down to Palermo, and
after a few minor changes — like giving him
the "nickname" Johnny and putting a tooth
pick in his mouth — she creates an unmis
takable twin for her husband. The escapades
that ensue, as Dante haplessly wanders from
one snafu into the next, make for a light
hearted, though sometimes overdone, com
edy.
The performances, particularly Benigni's,
are, by and large, solid, but the film is some
times silly and overacted, as in the scene
where Maria faints on the street after discov
ering Stecchino look-alike Dante.
Another difficulty in appreciating the
spotty humor, is the translation of the Italian
into English subtitles; a good deal of the
humor is based on understanding the cul
tural context, and can be lost in translation.
However, there are some brilliant comic
moments that add sparkle to the film. One

outstanding scene occurs at a state dinner,
after Dante makes a deal with a state official
not to reveal the official's mob involvement.
Well, that's what the official thinks the deal
was about; Dante thinks they just agreed not
to tell on each other for stealing bananas. By
the end of the dinner Dante has offered co
caine as diabetic medicine to the Pope, ex
posed the state official as a mobster and drug
user and felt up the state official's wife in
front of a crowd of hundreds.
Many of these scenes will remind you of
Abbott and Costello's "Who's on First" rou
tine. And Benigni, with his childlike face and
behavior, inspires memories of Lewis and
Charlie Chaplin. Benigni also scores points
for the film's surprising and original ending.
"Stecchino" is not a must-see film. In fact,
it's probably best just to wait for it on video.
But if you have a penchant for good slapstick
and like foreign films, then "Johnny Stecchi
no" is top banana.

Dracula

The stagy, surreal tone of "Bram Stoker's
Dracula" is set in its opening scene, in which
writhing soldiers impaled on pikes are
shown in silhouette against a red sunset. It's
an image as impressive as it is excessive, and
it's just the first of many similar effects in
Francis Ford Coppola's succulent adaptation
of the classic Victorian novel.
At first glance, Dracula (Gary Oldman) is
more reminiscent of an eccentric uncle than
nefarious bloodsucker — albeit one who
doesn't eat, doesn't have a reflection in a mir
ror and climbs sheer walls of rock, seeming
ly for kicks.

Maria (Nicoletta Braschi) professes her love for her husband's look alike, Dante (Rober
to Benigni), In "Johnny Stecchino."
Do you believe in destiny?" the Count asks
unsuspecting house guest Jonathan Harker
(Keanu Reeves), in a barely comprehensible
Transylvanian accent. Moments later, the
feckless Harker is chained to a wall in Dracu
la's castle, surrounded by bloodsucking sirens
and not minding it all that much.
Meanwhile, the vampire resurfaces in Lon
don as an absinthe-drinking hipster calling him
self "Prince Vlad." He wines and dines Harker's
virtuous fiancee, Mina (Winona Ryder), while
taking his own sustenance from the neck of
her rich-bitch friend Lucy (Sadie Frost).
Soon enough, Lucy is sprouting fangs and
making brazen overtures to every male in
sight. Nobody can figure out the bizarre holes
in her throat except the equally bizarre Prof.
Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), who
"knows more about obscure diseases than
anyone in the world." Summoned to Lucy's
deathbed, Van Helsing gleefully denounces
her as "the devil's concubine" and starts pass
ing out the garlic.
The film fails fast as it strays from Stoker's
novel, most noticeably in the addition of a
cheesy romantic attraction between Mina
and the Count. Stoker's Dracula stalked Mina
because she was an independent woman who
tried to "play her brains against him"; Coppo
la's protagonist is mourning a long-dead love,
whom Mina just happens to resemble.
Mina is portrayed as a willing victim, shift
ing the dramatic focus from Mina to Dracula
— an elusive, periphery character in the novel
— and undermining whatever suspense Cop
pola might have created. The problem is com
pounded by Ryder's performance, which re-

lies more on heavy breath
ing than serious acting.

Indeed, even Oldman's
definitive Dracula is sucked
into the debacle. "I love you
too much to condemn you,"
he whines to Mina. Given the
ferocity of Dracula s other in
carnations — which include
a wolf, a bat, a gorgon and a
herd of rats — this sensitive
male turn is less romantic
than ridiculous.
"We've all become God's
madmen," Van Helsing says,
and it's almost an understate
ment. Coppola's characters
inhabit a world of perpetual
fog and darkness where no
body is safe — or sane.
Clueless among them is
Reeves, who can't help look
ing like a nice English boy
with bad sideburns. His
most interesting line is
"Doctor! Please!"

Hopkins fares far better
as Van I lelsing, the comical
ly cranky scientist turned vampire slayer.
Richard E. Grant, Gary Elwes and Bill Camp
bell gamely costar as a trio of suitors indistin
guishable except by their facial hair.
As the bug-eating madman Rcnfield, rock
er Tom Waits provides comic relief rather
than ominous symbolism. Like the halfheart
ed AIDS metaphor implicit in Coppolas con
cept of" infected" blood, Renfield is milked in
passing and too soon forgotten.
Plotwise, screenwriter James V. Hart re
mains surprisingly faithful to Stoker, but in
dulges in far too many sappy pseudo-Victori

anisms like, "I have crossed oceans of time to
be with you."
The script's pervasive sense of terror and
overt eroticism renders such lines as "1 was
impotent with fear" and "You'll be complete
ly safe here" unintentionally hilarious.
If "Dracula" is thematically malnourished,
it's a visual feast, serving up every cinematic
technique on the menu. But Coppola's best
tricks are those he uses sparingly. It's cool to
see Dracula's shadow move independently of
his body — once. Likewise, a slow-motion
"wolf cam" quickly becomes conventional.
But the director docs add some nice flour

ishes to Stokers already-decadent tale — a
sunken garden, a morphine-addicted doctor,
flowers that wilt spontaneously. In a series of
montage shots, eyes become blood cells be
come peacock feathers become holes in a vic
tim's neck-
Tom Sanders' lush sets and Eiko Ishioka's
stylized costumes constitute a period film
fantasy of candelabra and chintz.
Ultimately, "Dracula" forsakes substance
for style, suspense for surprise and sensuality
for sex. For a truly terrifying experience, stay
home and read the book.

Aladdin

Sometimes a film comes along that is so
innovative that it rewrites the textbook on
how films of that kind should be made.
Walt Disney's "Aladdin" is not that film.
"Aladdin" is the story of a street urchin
named Aladdin who dreams of becoming a
prince. He meets the lovely princess Jas
mine, who dreams of being free to marry
for love, but is forced by law to marry a
prince. When Aladdin gets a hold of the
magic lamp, he uses it to become a prince,
but discovers that royalty alone can't win
Jasmine's heart.
Sounds good so far. Unfortunately, "Al
addin" is derivative of recent Disney releas
es, "Beauty and the Beast" and"The Little
Mermaid." The whole boy-meets-girl, boy
loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back formula has
gotten stale. Worst of all, the romance feels
forced, taking a back seat to the adventures

of Aladdin and the Genie.
The songs are as formulaic as the film. "A
Whole New World" is "Aladdin's version of
"Beauty and The Beast"; "Friend Like Me"
is a reworking of "Be Our Guest."
Disney has made virtually no attempt to
steep the music in a Middle Eastern tradi
tion. Except for the stereotypically offensive
song "Arabian Nights,all of the other
songs sound like they've been lifted from a
Broadway musical.
What saves "Aladdin" from being a
total write-off is Robin Williams' Genie.
Williams is irrepressible and shameless as
he imparts his nervous energy to the char
acter. His Genie is well-versed in pop cul
ture, impersonating everyone from
Robert DeNiro to Jack Nicholson to Arse
nio Hall.
"Aladdin'"s strength is in its animation.
Disney has opted for a curved, fluid carica
ture style, where one shape flows smoothly
and naturally into another. Though very
different from the linear style of "Beauty
and the Beast," it is just as effective.
Disney has also made impressive leaps
with its computer graphics. In one scene a
tiger's head rises up from the ground to be
come the Cave of Wonders, where Aladdin
procures his lamp. The flying carpet ride
through the collapsing cave, though remi
niscent of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom," is impressive nonetheless. The
cave, lava, explosions and falling rocks are
all computer-generated.
Ultimately, "Aladdin" is trapped by Dis
ney's increasingly formulaic approach to its
animated films. Disney studio chief Jeffrey
Katzenberg is intimately involved in each
film's production, and it shows. Perhaps if
he leaves the artists alone, future Disney
films will venture to the cutting edge in
stead of playing it safe.
But the most disturbing aspect of recent
Disney' films is their obsession with mar
riage. Doesn't anyone just shack up any
more like Snow White and the dwarfs did in
the past? Is 90 minutes really enough time
to decide you love someone? Has Dan
Quayle taken over Disney to ensure that
someone makes movies that he can under
stand?
Oh well. There's always "The Simpsons"

Johnny Stecchino

If you like slapstick and miss Jerry Lewis
movies then "Johnny Stecchino" is just the
film for you.
Written and directed by lead actor Rober
to Benigni, "Johnny Stecchino" is your typi
cal mistaken-identity farce. Johnny Stecchi
no (Benigni) — meaning "Johnny Tooth
pick" — is a petty mobster who rats on his
mafia brothers and then goes into hiding,
plotting a way to escape from Sicily to South
America.
Eighteen months later in Rome — when
Stecchino's wife Maria (Nicoletta Braschi)
stumbles upon Dante (also played by Benig
ni), an affable, banana-stealing bus driver
who is a dead ringer for Stecchino — it
seems that all of Johnny's problems are
solved.
Maria lures Dante down to Palermo, and
after a few minor changes — like giving him
the "nickname" Johnny and putting a tooth
pick in his mouth — she creates an unmis
takable twin for her husband. The escapades
that ensue, as Dante haplessly wanders from
one snafu into the next, make for a light
hearted, though sometimes overdone, com
edy.
The performances, particularly Benigni's,
are, by and large, solid, but the film is some
times silly and overacted, as in the scene
where Maria faints on the street after discov
ering Stecchino look-alike Dante.
Another difficulty in appreciating the
spotty humor, is the translation of the Italian
into English subtitles; a good deal of the
humor is based on understanding the cul
tural context, and can be lost in translation.
However, there are some brilliant comic
moments that add sparkle to the film. One

outstanding scene occurs at a state dinner,
after Dante makes a deal with a state official
not to reveal the official's mob involvement.
Well, that's what the official thinks the deal
was about; Dante thinks they just agreed not
to tell on each other for stealing bananas. By
the end of the dinner Dante has offered co
caine as diabetic medicine to the Pope, ex
posed the state official as a mobster and drug
user and felt up the state official's wife in
front of a crowd of hundreds.
Many of these scenes will remind you of
Abbott and Costello's "Who's on First" rou
tine. And Benigni, with his childlike face and
behavior, inspires memories of Lewis and
Charlie Chaplin. Benigni also scores points
for the film's surprising and original ending.
"Stecchino" is not a must-see film. In fact,
it's probably best just to wait for it on video.
But if you have a penchant for good slapstick
and like foreign films, then "Johnny Stecchi
no" is top banana.

Dracula

The stagy, surreal tone of "Bram Stoker's
Dracula" is set in its opening scene, in which
writhing soldiers impaled on pikes are
shown in silhouette against a red sunset. It's
an image as impressive as it is excessive, and
it's just the first of many similar effects in
Francis Ford Coppola's succulent adaptation
of the classic Victorian novel.
At first glance, Dracula (Gary Oldman) is
more reminiscent of an eccentric uncle than
nefarious bloodsucker — albeit one who
doesn't eat, doesn't have a reflection in a mir
ror and climbs sheer walls of rock, seeming
ly for kicks.

Maria (Nicoletta Braschi) professes her love for her husband's look alike, Dante (Rober
to Benigni), In "Johnny Stecchino."
Do you believe in destiny?" the Count asks
unsuspecting house guest Jonathan Harker
(Keanu Reeves), in a barely comprehensible
Transylvanian accent. Moments later, the
feckless Harker is chained to a wall in Dracu
la's castle, surrounded by bloodsucking sirens
and not minding it all that much.
Meanwhile, the vampire resurfaces in Lon
don as an absinthe-drinking hipster calling him
self "Prince Vlad." He wines and dines Harker's
virtuous fiancee, Mina (Winona Ryder), while
taking his own sustenance from the neck of
her rich-bitch friend Lucy (Sadie Frost).
Soon enough, Lucy is sprouting fangs and
making brazen overtures to every male in
sight. Nobody can figure out the bizarre holes
in her throat except the equally bizarre Prof.
Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), who
"knows more about obscure diseases than
anyone in the world." Summoned to Lucy's
deathbed, Van Helsing gleefully denounces
her as "the devil's concubine" and starts pass
ing out the garlic.
The film fails fast as it strays from Stoker's
novel, most noticeably in the addition of a
cheesy romantic attraction between Mina
and the Count. Stoker's Dracula stalked Mina
because she was an independent woman who
tried to "play her brains against him"; Coppo
la's protagonist is mourning a long-dead love,
whom Mina just happens to resemble.
Mina is portrayed as a willing victim, shift
ing the dramatic focus from Mina to Dracula
— an elusive, periphery character in the novel
— and undermining whatever suspense Cop
pola might have created. The problem is com
pounded by Ryder's performance, which re-

lies more on heavy breath
ing than serious acting.

Indeed, even Oldman's
definitive Dracula is sucked
into the debacle. "I love you
too much to condemn you,"
he whines to Mina. Given the
ferocity of Dracula s other in
carnations — which include
a wolf, a bat, a gorgon and a
herd of rats — this sensitive
male turn is less romantic
than ridiculous.

A lampful of new
tricks and stock
marriage themes

Aladdin

Sometimes a film comes along that is so
innovative that it rewrites the textbook on
how films of that kind should be made.
Walt Disney's "Aladdin" is not that film.
"Aladdin" is the story of a street urchin
named Aladdin who dreams of becoming a
prince. He meets the lovely princess Jas
mine, who dreams of being free to marry
for love, but is forced by law to marry a
prince. When Aladdin gets a hold of the
magic lamp, he uses it to become a prince,
but discovers that royalty alone can't win
Jasmine's heart.
Sounds good so far. Unfortunately, "Al
addin" is derivative of recent Disney releas
es, "Beauty and the Beast" and"The Little
Mermaid." The whole boy-meets-girl, boy
loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back formula has
gotten stale. Worst of all, the romance feels
forced, taking a back seat to the adventures

of Aladdin and the Genie.
The songs are as formulaic as the film. "A
Whole New World" is "Aladdin's version of
"Beauty and The Beast"; "Friend Like Me"
is a reworking of "Be Our Guest."
Disney has made virtually no attempt to
steep the music in a Middle Eastern tradi
tion. Except for the stereotypically offensive
song "Arabian Nights,all of the other
songs sound like they've been lifted from a
Broadway musical.
What saves "Aladdin" from being a
total write-off is Robin Williams' Genie.
Williams is irrepressible and shameless as
he imparts his nervous energy to the char
acter. His Genie is well-versed in pop cul
ture, impersonating everyone from
Robert DeNiro to Jack Nicholson to Arse
nio Hall.
"Aladdin'"s strength is in its animation.
Disney has opted for a curved, fluid carica
ture style, where one shape flows smoothly
and naturally into another. Though very
different from the linear style of "Beauty
and the Beast," it is just as effective.
Disney has also made impressive leaps
with its computer graphics. In one scene a
tiger's head rises up from the ground to be
come the Cave of Wonders, where Aladdin
procures his lamp. The flying carpet ride
through the collapsing cave, though remi
niscent of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom," is impressive nonetheless. The
cave, lava, explosions and falling rocks are
all computer-generated.
Ultimately, "Aladdin" is trapped by Dis
ney's increasingly formulaic approach to its
animated films. Disney studio chief Jeffrey
Katzenberg is intimately involved in each
film's production, and it shows. Perhaps if
he leaves the artists alone, future Disney
films will venture to the cutting edge in
stead of playing it safe.
But the most disturbing aspect of recent
Disney' films is their obsession with mar
riage. Doesn't anyone just shack up any
more like Snow White and the dwarfs did in
the past? Is 90 minutes really enough time
to decide you love someone? Has Dan
Quayle taken over Disney to ensure that
someone makes movies that he can under
stand?
Oh well. There's always "The Simpsons"
on Thursday night.

Toothpick crook,
slapstick laughs
in Maffioso flick

Johnny Stecchino

If you like slapstick and miss Jerry Lewis
movies then "Johnny Stecchino" is just the
film for you.
Written and directed by lead actor Rober
to Benigni, "Johnny Stecchino" is your typi
cal mistaken-identity farce. Johnny Stecchi
no (Benigni) — meaning "Johnny Tooth
pick" — is a petty mobster who rats on his
mafia brothers and then goes into hiding,
plotting a way to escape from Sicily to South
America.
Eighteen months later in Rome — when
Stecchino's wife Maria (Nicoletta Braschi)
stumbles upon Dante (also played by Benig
ni), an affable, banana-stealing bus driver
who is a dead ringer for Stecchino — it
seems that all of Johnny's problems are
solved.
Maria lures Dante down to Palermo, and
after a few minor changes — like giving him
the "nickname" Johnny and putting a tooth
pick in his mouth — she creates an unmis
takable twin for her husband. The escapades
that ensue, as Dante haplessly wanders from
one snafu into the next, make for a light
hearted, though sometimes overdone, com
edy.
The performances, particularly Benigni's,
are, by and large, solid, but the film is some
times silly and overacted, as in the scene
where Maria faints on the street after discov
ering Stecchino look-alike Dante.
Another difficulty in appreciating the
spotty humor, is the translation of the Italian
into English subtitles; a good deal of the
humor is based on understanding the cul
tural context, and can be lost in translation.
However, there are some brilliant comic
moments that add sparkle to the film. One

outstanding scene occurs at a state dinner,
after Dante makes a deal with a state official
not to reveal the official's mob involvement.
Well, that's what the official thinks the deal
was about; Dante thinks they just agreed not
to tell on each other for stealing bananas. By
the end of the dinner Dante has offered co
caine as diabetic medicine to the Pope, ex
posed the state official as a mobster and drug
user and felt up the state official's wife in
front of a crowd of hundreds.
Many of these scenes will remind you of
Abbott and Costello's "Who's on First" rou
tine. And Benigni, with his childlike face and
behavior, inspires memories of Lewis and
Charlie Chaplin. Benigni also scores points
for the film's surprising and original ending.
"Stecchino" is not a must-see film. In fact,
it's probably best just to wait for it on video.
But if you have a penchant for good slapstick
and like foreign films, then "Johnny Stecchi
no" is top banana.

much at stake in
biting bloodbath

Dracula

The stagy, surreal tone of "Bram Stoker's
Dracula" is set in its opening scene, in which
writhing soldiers impaled on pikes are
shown in silhouette against a red sunset. It's
an image as impressive as it is excessive, and
it's just the first of many similar effects in
Francis Ford Coppola's succulent adaptation
of the classic Victorian novel.
At first glance, Dracula (Gary Oldman) is
more reminiscent of an eccentric uncle than
nefarious bloodsucker — albeit one who
doesn't eat, doesn't have a reflection in a mir
ror and climbs sheer walls of rock, seeming
ly for kicks.
