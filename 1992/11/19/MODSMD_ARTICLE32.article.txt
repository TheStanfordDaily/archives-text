Heavenly music:
'Blind' takes you
to another world

The Sundays

"Blind," the Sundays' latest release, works
best when you close your eyes and let the
music seep into the subconscious.
The Sundays' mellow, alternative, guitar
oriented pop songs recall the music of the
Smiths without the moaning of Morrissey.

Instead, lead singer Harriet Wheeler's vocals
arc clcar and childlike. Her voice soars over
the subdued guitar work of guitarist David
Gavurin.
With "Blind," the Sundays move out of
the realm of pop into something less up
beat. Songs like "Goodbye" and "On Earth"
are reminiscent of the atmospheric music
of the Cocteau Twins. Like the Twins' Eliza
beth Frazer, Wheeler stretches the words
out in these songs to the point where they
are unintelligible. Her voice seemingly de
fies gravity as it hits notes that most people
can't reach.
Lyrically, the Sundays are not very strong,
mostly focusing on songs about life in Eng
land and love — or the lack thereof. Like the
Smiths, they also sing about confusion and
sadness.
"If you don't have a clue about life/
then I'm happy to say/ neither have 1 al
though/ I'm not going to shrug my shoul
ders and suck my/ thumb/ this time/
'cause there's something I deserve/ love,"
sings Wheeler on the song, "Love," off the
new album.
Another song, "Life & Soul," is a lullaby
that soothes and caresses. It's almost like a
Windham I lill song with the addition of vo
cals that lull you to sleep.
"Blind" bathes the listener in a heavenly
atmosphere. While it lacks the enthusiastic
catchiness of their earlier album, "Reading,
Writing and Arithmetic," it's good in an un
derstated way, thanks to the beautiful
singing of Wheeler. Her voice, ethereal in
quality, is undeniably angelic.

Bob Dylan

On "Good As I Been To You" we get Bob
Dylans "Unplugged." Dylan's first acoustic
album in 27 years is a low-budget, endearing
collection of covers of folk and blues stan
dards.
Ironically, the title is a lyric from a song
called "You're Gonna Quit Me," in which the
singer conveys his fear of being betrayed and
dumped by a lover whom he has treated very
well.
This fear is not altogether unfounded.
Though Dylan received a hero's welcome at a
recent tribute concert in New York, his unin
telligible renditions suffered compared to per
formances by other stars on the bill. And
while last year's release of "The Bootleg Series"
was widely heralded, the reception for most of
Dylan's recent material has been erratic.
So perhaps "Good As I Been To You" is a
concession to the relative success of his
"Bootleg Series," since this album is little
more than a bootleg itself.
The music is just Dylan singing, playing
guitar and harmonica as if he'd been secret
ly taped while jamming for his own plea
sure. And the CD packaging is bargain base
ment. It uses a mid-'Bos photo of Dylan for

the back cover; the booklet is just a folded
piece of paper without any liner notes.
Whereas bootlegs are expensive out of
necessity, one wonders why Columbia
charges full price for this latest album that
cost them virtually nothing to produce. But
price considerations and packaging aside,
the informal session gives us a warm, inti
mate look at how Dylan sounds in his 50s.
Dylan manages to come off pretty well as
an elder statesman of blues and folk. The
storytelling folk songs, the blues laments
and even the nursery rhyme song at the end
all have strong resonances with Dylan's own
compositions. The 13 songs show how
closely Dylan is connected to the folk tradi
tion, even after all these years as a rocker.
The absence of original material and the
"live in one take" recordings allow the listen
er to focus on Dylan's musicianship. The
playing has a slightly ragged edge, which
adds a human touch to his otherwise dex
trous finger-picking and harmonica-play
ing. It's as if he's playing live in the Coffee
House: a little nervous about getting it right,
but also relaxed and at ease with his material
and audience. It's easy to forget he could play
this well.
Compared to recent performances, his
passionate singing and relative clarity arc
impressive. But for those unacclimated to
the voice of the mature Dylan, his nasal
croak will probably be an unwelcome
sound.
While this album probably won't win
Dylan a new audience, it may help appease
some disenchanted fans.

all have strong resonances with Dylan's own
compositions. The 13 songs show how
closely Dylan is connected to the folk tradi
tion, even after all these years as a rocker.
The absence of original material and the
"live in one take" recordings allow the listen
er to focus on Dylan's musicianship. The
playing has a slightly ragged edge, which
adds a human touch to his otherwise dex
trous finger-picking and harmonica-play
ing. It's as if he's playing live in the Coffee
House: a little nervous about getting it right,
but also relaxed and at ease with his material
and audience. It's easy to forget he could play
this well.
Compared to recent performances, his
passionate singing and relative clarity arc
impressive. But for those unacclimated to
the voice of the mature Dylan, his nasal
croak will probably be an unwelcome
sound.
While this album probably won't win
Dylan a new audience, it may help appease
some disenchanted fans.

Heavenly music:
'Blind' takes you
to another world

The Sundays

"Blind," the Sundays' latest release, works
best when you close your eyes and let the
music seep into the subconscious.
The Sundays' mellow, alternative, guitar
oriented pop songs recall the music of the
Smiths without the moaning of Morrissey.

Instead, lead singer Harriet Wheeler's vocals
arc clcar and childlike. Her voice soars over
the subdued guitar work of guitarist David
Gavurin.
With "Blind," the Sundays move out of
the realm of pop into something less up
beat. Songs like "Goodbye" and "On Earth"
are reminiscent of the atmospheric music
of the Cocteau Twins. Like the Twins' Eliza
beth Frazer, Wheeler stretches the words
out in these songs to the point where they
are unintelligible. Her voice seemingly de
fies gravity as it hits notes that most people
can't reach.
Lyrically, the Sundays are not very strong,
mostly focusing on songs about life in Eng
land and love — or the lack thereof. Like the
Smiths, they also sing about confusion and
sadness.
"If you don't have a clue about life/
then I'm happy to say/ neither have 1 al
though/ I'm not going to shrug my shoul
ders and suck my/ thumb/ this time/
'cause there's something I deserve/ love,"
sings Wheeler on the song, "Love," off the
new album.
Another song, "Life & Soul," is a lullaby
that soothes and caresses. It's almost like a
Windham I lill song with the addition of vo
cals that lull you to sleep.
"Blind" bathes the listener in a heavenly
atmosphere. While it lacks the enthusiastic
catchiness of their earlier album, "Reading,
Writing and Arithmetic," it's good in an un
derstated way, thanks to the beautiful
singing of Wheeler. Her voice, ethereal in
quality, is undeniably angelic.

A friendly, folksy
Bob endears his
faithful listeners

Bob Dylan

On "Good As I Been To You" we get Bob
Dylans "Unplugged." Dylan's first acoustic
album in 27 years is a low-budget, endearing
collection of covers of folk and blues stan
dards.
Ironically, the title is a lyric from a song
called "You're Gonna Quit Me," in which the
singer conveys his fear of being betrayed and
dumped by a lover whom he has treated very
well.
This fear is not altogether unfounded.
Though Dylan received a hero's welcome at a
recent tribute concert in New York, his unin
telligible renditions suffered compared to per
formances by other stars on the bill. And
while last year's release of "The Bootleg Series"
was widely heralded, the reception for most of
Dylan's recent material has been erratic.
So perhaps "Good As I Been To You" is a
concession to the relative success of his
"Bootleg Series," since this album is little
more than a bootleg itself.
The music is just Dylan singing, playing
guitar and harmonica as if he'd been secret
ly taped while jamming for his own plea
sure. And the CD packaging is bargain base
ment. It uses a mid-'Bos photo of Dylan for

the back cover; the booklet is just a folded
piece of paper without any liner notes.
Whereas bootlegs are expensive out of
necessity, one wonders why Columbia
charges full price for this latest album that
cost them virtually nothing to produce. But
price considerations and packaging aside,
the informal session gives us a warm, inti
mate look at how Dylan sounds in his 50s.
Dylan manages to come off pretty well as
an elder statesman of blues and folk. The
storytelling folk songs, the blues laments
and even the nursery rhyme song at the end
all have strong resonances with Dylan's own
compositions. The 13 songs show how
closely Dylan is connected to the folk tradi
tion, even after all these years as a rocker.
The absence of original material and the
"live in one take" recordings allow the listen
