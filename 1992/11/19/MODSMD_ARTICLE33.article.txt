## 'Malcolm X' sparks controversy, criticism and praise 
### 
On Feb. 19, 1965, one of
black America's most influ
ential leaders was murdered
as he began to address a
Harlem audience. Born
Malcolm Little, he was known at various
times as Detroit Red, Satan and El-Hajj
Malik El-Shabazz. But he could never shake
his most famous moniker, Malcolm X,
which he earned as the national spokesman
for the black nationalist Nation of Islam.
Many mourned his passing; actor Ossie
Davis eulogized Malcolm as "our shining
black prince." But many people, both black
and white, also rejoiced at Malcolm's death.
The Nation of Islam, whose leader Malcolm
publicly castigated for adultery, uttered not a
word of remorse. The United States govern
ment, whom he never ceased to harangue, was
probably more than happy to see him dead.
Now, more than 27 years, seven
screenwriters, three directors, two produc
ers and $34 million later, his enemies'
worst nightmare has come true.
He's back. With a vengeance.
Malcolm hasn't just gone Hollywood;
he's become a fixture of pop culture.
Rappers from Chuck D to KRS-One to
Paris invoke his name regularly. His most
famous sound bite, "By any means neces
sary," has been quoted by politicians across
the ideological spectrum.
But the biggest move to thrust Malcolm
X into the mainstream came when Warner
Bros, hired Spike Lee to direct the film. Fully
aware of the wide support his undertaking
would require, Lee sold hats, shirts and
other apparel emblazoned with the letter
"X," in order to publicize the film.
The übiquitous silver "X," worn by
celebrities and ordinary people alike, has pro
moted his film with a simplicity and aware
ness possibly surpassed only by the "Batman"
logo. But Malcolm-mania didn't end there.

Now available are "X" potato chips and air
freshener. Can "X" condoms be far behind?
Stanford History Prof. Clay Carson,
who wrote "Malcolm X: the FBI
File" and is directing the Martin
Luther King Papers Project, said he
believes the "X" phenomenon has
deeper roots than the film.
"Malcolm was always a person who
challenged the civil rights movement, pri
marily because he felt it was a movement
that was not in the interest of all of black
people but just a segment of the black com
munity," he said.
Carson attributed the current popular
ity of Malcolm X to "the unfinished busi
ness of the '605."
"More than 25 years since Malcolm's

assassination, we've got civil rights reform,
and yet poverty is still endemic in the black
community," he said. "By the '80s, certainly
among young people, there was a recogni-

tion that something defi
nitely had gone wrong."
For disenfranchised
black youth, who perhaps
felt that the recently
iconized Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.'s nonvio
lent, integrationist philos
ophy did not speak to
them, Malcolm X symbol
ized a critique of the civil
rights movement, and of
King in particular.

But Carson said the newfound interest
in Malcolm X has more to do with the rela
tive dearth of information about him, rather
than a rejection of King's ideals. "For many
people, there's a feeling, 'Well, I already
know about Martin Luther King. Malcolm X
is someone who I'm curious about.' "
After reading an early version of the
script, Carson expressed concern about the
film's historical accuracy. "One thing [Lee]
has left out is Malcolm's relationship with
his brothers and sisters," he said. Malcolm's
brothers led him to the Nation of Islam.
His sister paid for his pilgrimage to Mecca.
"To exclude these people makes him seem
more like a person who drops out of the
sky rather than out of a real social context,"
Carson said.
Carson is even more concerned with
the film's omission of Malcolm's relation
ships with others in the struggle for black
freedom. "You would never know from the
film that during the last year of Malcolm's
life, particularly, he was intensely involved
in reaching out and making linkages with
other elements in the black struggle," he
said, suggesting that the film "could have
shown Malcolm ... meeting with Coretta
Scott King and the activists in the Southern
[civil rights] movement."
Despite his apprehensions, Carson said

he has no intention of denigrating Lee's
achievement. "I wouldn't want to be associ
ated with efforts to detract from Spike Lee's
achievement in even getting this film made.
He deserves applause for that."

The struggle to make "Malcolm
X" was fraught with numerous
artistic, financial and political
complications. In 1967, pro
ducer Marvin Worth acquired
the rights to "The Autobiography of Malcolm
X." He hired writer and playwright James
Baldwin, who turned in a 250 page script,
more than twice the length of a normal
screenplay. Documentary filmmaker Arnold
Perl was then brought in to reshape it.
Worth shelved the screenplay in favor
of a 1972 documentary, which won an
Academy Award Nomination. Subsequently,
a host of writers, actors and directors tried
to revive the project: novelist David Bradley,
playwrights Charles Fuller and David
Mamet, directors Norman Jewison and
Sidney Lumet, and actors Eddie Murphy
and Richard Pryor. None of them were ulti
mately successful.
Jewison and Fuller quit the project when
Spike Lee publicly insisted the film have a
black director. Worth, Warner Bros, (who
shared ownership of the rights) and Lee set
tled on a $28 million budget — even though
Lee insisted that the film would cost $33 mil
lion — and production began soon after.
Temple University English professor
David Bradley, who wrote three drafts of a
"Malcolm X" script for Warner Bros,
between 1984 and 1988, attributed the pro
ject's successful completion to Lee's pub
licly confrontational approach.
"I think Spike Lee has done a miraculous
thing in bringing this to the screen. He did a
masterful job of politicking. He used... con
troversy to get around the politics of
Hollywood, to get publicity that forced
Hollywood moguls to do things the way he
wanted them done," Bradley said. "1 respect
that a lot. . . There's probably not another
director who could have gotten this film made."
Warner Bros, "never wanted to make
the film," Bradley said. "If Spike hadn't
been able to appeal .to outside resources,
they wouldn't have made the film."
Bradley cited his frequent meetings
with the studio as evidence of their reluc
tance to make the film. "When we talked
about Malcolm as a hot item or a cultural
icon — nice, removed, abstract terminolo
gy — everybody could nod and say this was

going to be a hell of a story."
But the Malcolm X story "involves an
awful lot of rhetorical violence," he said.
"Malcolm was very inflammatory.
"As soon as you started creating scenes,
there were always problems," Bradley recalled.
"Malcolm was coming back to life and that
was a very scary thing. Well they didn't want
Malcolm back to life. They didn't like him
when he was alive."
Bradley said he believes Warner Bros,
hired Lee for ulterior motives. "Having Spike
Lee as a director gets everybody off the hook,"
he said. "If the black community comes down
on the movie, they come down on Spike. They
don't come down on Warner Bros. If the white
community comes down on the movie, they
come down on Spike... .1 think Spike knows
this and likes the idea. No one's talking about
Warner Bros.'s 'Malcolm X.' They're talking
about Spike Lee's 'Malcolm X."'
As the film opens across America,
the question remains: was the 27
year struggle to bring Malcolm's
life to the screen worth it?
Bradley believes that the
hype surrounding the film will generate an
interest in Malcolm X more valuable than the
film itself.
"If you think that having a Malcolm X
movie — and all the publicity attendant to that
— is more important than the quality of the
movie, I think you'll be happy. And I feel that
way, so I'm not worried about what the film
depicts," he said. "Malcolm will survive Spike."
Carson, however, is more optimistic than
Bradley about the film's usefulness, and sees
social value in both the publicity surrounding
the film and the film itself. "I think the film is
the beginning of an educational process, not
the end," he said.

"Those of us that are
concerned about social
change have to use this as a
stimulus for discussion. And
we have to address the ques
tion of what was left out,
what questions were not
addressed, were not
answered by the film. To
me, that isn't criticizing the
film, that's taking the film
seriously."
Carson said he hopes
people will learn something
valuable about Malcolm
from Lee's film. Malcolm
"was a person who had the
courage to seek answers no
matter what the cost to
himself. He had the physi
cal courage to change the
course of his life in order to
find that truth, but he also
had the intellectual courage
to recognize when he was
wrong. I think that that
kind of intellectual and
physical courage is really
needed today."
