# 'Malcolm' soundtrack funky and fiery
##

Behind every self-respecting flick is a
musical accompaniment that can also
stand alone. Director Spike Lee's most
recent "Joint" is no exception. And just as
"Malcolm X" is a tribute to one of this
nation's most rigorous social critics, the
"X" soundtrack is a tribute to the develop
ment of black music over Malcolm's four
decades — the '20s to the '60s.
The soundtrack begins with
"Revolution," the Arrested Development
produced track that precedes the film. A
blending of conventional hip-hop drum
rhythms, Afro-centric chants and a reg
gaesque musical accompaniment definitely
makes the tune an enjoyable listen.
But "Revolution," along with the sound
track's final selection, Aretha Franklin's
"Someday We'll All Be Free," brings closure
to the remaining 11 arrangements that are
firmly rooted in the blues and jazz traditions

of American black music.
Tunes like vocalist Joe Turner's "Roll
'Em Pete"take the listener on a nostalgic
trip back to the heyday of jazz, where dance
halls swayed with the melodic gymnastics
of big bands and shuddered under the
frenzied movements of agile lindy-hoppers
— the equivalent to hip-hop's wild contor
tionists.
Other tunes like the classic Ink Spot
number "My Prayer," Billie Floliday's "Big
Stuff" and Erskine Hawkins bluesy "Don't
Cry Baby," prove that the slow jam or love
ballad tradition didn't happen yesterday or
even back in the Motown days of the
soundtrack's producer, Quincy Jones.
Instead, it's at least as old as the black
American music experience itself.
While each of the 13 tracks stand as
light houses of artistic expression and musi
cal technique, five arrangements clearly out
shine the rest. Louis Jordan's witty "Beans
and Cornbread," for instance, is a vibrant
"call-and-response" tune — a throwback to

the field holler — augmented effectively by
a bouncing musical accompaniment.
The great Duke Ellington jumps in on
two numbers, Ella Fitzgerald's mildly disso
nant "Azure" and"The Nutcracker"-derived
"Arabesque Cookie." Using only an acoustic
guitar, the first tune is driven almost exclu
sively by the subtle nuances of Fitzgerald's
vocals, while the second arrangement illus
trates his precision as both an arranger and
composer. Both are incredible.
And last, but by no means least, John
Coltrane's "Alabama" —part abstract, part
focused — musically sums up the mood of
the black community in the early '60s with
powerful honesty.
The "Malcolm X" soundtrack, aside
from being an astounding recording musi
cally, also makes a thick slice of the black
American musical experience accessible to
the uninitiated and the curious. It's one of
the few soundtracks released this year that
is as relevant as the film it is intended to
complement.
