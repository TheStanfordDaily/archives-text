# Malcolm remains an 'X' factor in Spike Lee's long-awaited epic release
## 
### N'Gai Croal Staff writer 
"Malcolm X" is Spike Lee's "Last
Temptation of Christ." Like Martin
Scorsese, Lee has wanted to make this
film for years. Each director endured
budget problems, controversy and
intense media scrutiny to realize his
vision. And though both films are good,
neither is the magnum opus its director
hoped it would be because of each
director's intense reverence for his
respective subject. Instead, both films
serve to whet your appetite for the
directors' next project.
Lee approaches the film, which is
based primarily on "The Autobiography
of Malcolm X," by dividing Malcolm's
life into four distinct periods, each of
which is directed and filmed in a differ
ent way.
The film opens during Malcolm's
days as a hustler and pusher in Boston

and Harlem, where he was nicknamed
"Red" for his bright, red hair. The
Harlem sequences are loose and inven
tive, replete with Lee's trademark sense
of humor. Lee diffuses the lighting in
these scenes to soften Malcolm's crimi
nality.
Next is Malcolm's life in prison,
where he was called "Satan" for his hos
tility to religion, and where he convert
ed to Islam. These sequences are harsh,
bathed in an ominous blue light that
disappears only when Malcolm converts
to Islam.
Malcolm's departure from prison to
become the official spokesman for the
Nation of Islam marks the third period
of his life. This phase is shot in an epic
style, with slow tracking shots, and all
encompassing wide shots which capture
Malcolm's growing influence by show
ing the increasingly large crowds he
spoke to.
The fourth and final period con
tains Malcolm's split with the Nation,
his pilgrimage to Mecca where he
changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-
Shabazz, and his assassination. At the
end, the lighting is again slightly dif
fused to reflect Malcolm's new aware
ness. The direction becomes less stately
and more frenetic as the assassination
approaches.
Spike Lee wisely chooses not to
draw out Malcolm's actual assassina
tion. Instead, he slowly builds up to it
by showing how Malcolm's life was
spinning out of his control. Lee cross
cuts among scenes of Malcolm sitting in
a hotel room, the assassins preparing to
kill him, the FBI listening to his conver
sations, harassing phone calls to his wife
and family and a youth dance in the
hotel ballroom, all to the music of J.R.
Walker and The All—Stars' "Shotgun."
The actual assassination is brief.
Instead of a dramatic, slow-motion shot
of his death, Lee cuts right to the
crowd's chaos, highlighting the impact
of the loss of Malcolm upon the black
community.
But the audience doesn't feel the
true impact of the assassination until
Lee shows documentary footage of
Malcolm X, over which actor Ossie

Davis is heard performing the eulogy he
gave at Malcolm's funeral. At that point
in the film's most powerful sequence —
which emphasizes the finality of
Malcolm's death — the audience is torn
away from the fiction of the film and
shown the real Malcolm.
One of the biggest controversies sur
rounding "Malcolm X" was Lee's insis
tence that only a black person should
direct the film. Few mainstream white
directors would have sought to link
Malcolm X and events in the '60s to pre
sent day social injustices as he did. The
opening credits contain footage of the
Rodney King beating, and the film ends
with Nelson Mandela reciting a Malcolm
X speech to schoolchildren in Soweto.
With these two sequences, Lee mas
terfully exhumes Malcolm X's legacy
from the coffin of history and brings it
back to life.
Denzel Washington gives a techni
cally brilliant performance as Malcolm
X. He reproduces Malcolm's walk, his
tics, his mannerisms, and invests
Malcolm's speeches with a power and
fury similar to that which Malcolm pos
sessed.
"Malcolm X'"s weakness is Lee's
uncustomarily conservative stylistic
approach. Instead of turning the epic
film genre on its ear with the inimitable
style of a Spike Lee Joint, he allows the
genre to subsume him by focusing on
what Malcolm did instead of trying to
figure out who Malcolm was.
By simply showing us Malcolm's
life instead of interpreting Malcolm's
psychology, Lee and Arnold Perl's
script undermines Denzel
Washington's performance by giving
him very little to work with.
Ultimately, the story simply transfers
the autobiography to celluloid.
"Malcolm X" is a film for people
who generally don't like Spike Lee's
films. Accessible, reverent and
restrained, it's Lee's personal homage to
Malcolm X. Any fears that his detractors
had about his ability to make a film of
this scope can now be permanently laid
to rest.
But the old Spike Lee was better.
And that's the truth, Ruth.
