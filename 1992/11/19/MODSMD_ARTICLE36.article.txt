# Gaieties goes global, Casper-centric
## 
### Sabrina Wong 
It's that time of year again: the chill of the
mid-60-degree weather, the vibrancy of
leaves on certain trees changing colors and
the aroma of roasted Weenies at the biggest
outdoor barbecue in the Bay Area.
There's no mistaking it — Big Game is just
around the corner. And Big Game Week just
wouldn't be complete without that festive
song-and-dance pep-rally called Big Game
Gaieties.
A Stanford tradition bigger than Bob
Whitfield, sharper than The Axe arrd funnier
than your last self-induced bike accident,
Gaieties is the annual Ram's Head musical
production that satirizes Stanford life and
capitalizes on the nefarious character of our
rivals across the Bay.

'Casper is so excited about
this. He read the script and
instantly liked it He thought
it was the funniest thing.'
— Stephanie Allen

But Big Game Gaieties 1992 promises to
be much more than the traditional Stanford
triumph over an evil Cal student. Opting
against the plotless style of Gaieties past, the
head-writers, seniors Hilary Ryan and Jeff
Springer, said they created a "conspiracy/spy
thriller, comedy/drama, action-adventure
western romance."
Inspired by the end of the Gold War, the
breakup of the Soviet Union and the student
body's vote to "prefer not to have a COP,"
Springer said this fall's Gaieties will set up
"parallels between Stanford life and geo-po
litical world events."
"Don't worry, though," he said, "the plot
isn't too complicated. We figured a lot of the
people were going to be drunk anyways so we
made it pretty graspable."
Gaieties 1992 should "appeal to all kinds of
people — a universal Gaieties," Ryan added.
According to director, senior Stephanie
Allen, the main characters represent a cross
section of the Stanford population. Sopho
more Jonathan Green plays "Virgil," an
everyday guy with really bad luck — nudge,

nudge, wink, wink. Angela Newell, also a
sophomore, plays "Alex," a tough New Yorker
who enjoys sports and sarcasm. Freshman
Ryan Higman plays "Ethan," a sensitive, but
not-too-wimpy, guy who works at the Bridge.
And senior Geniveve Ruskus plays Catherine,
a really smart fuzzy with a penchant for liter
ary references.
"The best thing about this year's show is
the incredibly talented cast," Allen said.
"There are only four people who've been in it
before so it's a really new cast."
One new cast member whose presence is es
pecially conspicuous is Stanford's newly inau
gurated president, Gerhard Casper. While
none of the Gaieties staff would divulge infor
mation about Casper's role in the play, they all
said the production is very "Caspcr-centric."
"Casper is so excited about this. He read
the script and instantly liked it. 1 le thought it
was the funniest thing," Allen said. Also ap
pearing in Gaieties is Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions James Montoya, who is slated for
a singing performance.
In addition to Casper and Montoya,
"There will be other surprise cameos by
major University figures," Ryan said. Former
University President Donald Kennedy, how

ever, will not he among them. Not wanting to
detract from Casper's role, he politely de
clined a part.
Ryan and Springer, both third-year Gai
eties writers, have come up with a few of their
own innovations. This year will be the first
time Gaieties will solicit audience participa
tion, Springer said. In addition to being able
to vote during intermission — to determine
what percentage of the Gaities audience
thinks Branner sucks — there is another par
ticipation-oriented element that the Gaieties
staff is keeping a secret.
Naturally, Gaieties will offer the usual
spoofs of yell leaders, athletes, freshmen,
Greeks, resume-packers and, of course, Cal
students. However, the Gaieties staff agreed
that the production will "be a lot less raunchy
than past Gaieties."
While there won't be any exotic-erotics in
baseball mitts (as in last year's Gaieties),
"make no mistake — it's no kiddie show,"
Ryan said.
There arc "a few offensive moments, but
it's more good fun," which makes it even bet
ter, Allen said.
Mostly, said Springer, it's just "a whole lot
of sinking and dancing."

While searching for Casper in Encina Land, freshman Ryan Higman also finds romance
with sophomore Emily Gellady in this year's Big Game Gaieties.
