## The
						Jonez bring funky fusion to White Plaza 
### June Mølgaard Staff writer 
If anything characterizes The Jonez,
it's fusion.
Add rap, rock and reggae, a pinch of
jazz, funk and ska, and you have this
very unusual foursome that sounds like
an amalgamation of the Clash, old Judas
Priest, Fishbone and English Beat.
The Jonez, who are the lead attrac
tion of the Big Game Show in White
Plaza tomorrow night, are members of
the Black Rock Coalition and deliver a
show with intense frenetic energy, good
humor and lyrics with a purpose.
Weaving in and out of the speed
metal beat, the funked-up riff and the
groove of the Island sound with an ease
that is truly unusual, they deliver what
their name suggests.
'The Jonez' is taken from the old
Harlem drug term, 'jonesing' (needing a
fix), and can connote any intense crav
ing or desire.
For The Jonez, this desire seems to
extend itself beyond their music into the
political realm with lyrics that speak of
racism, apathy and violence.
Their message is pervasive and time
ly without taking over the music, which
is at all times a pot boiled thick and hot
with fun and energy.
The Jonez, after coming together five
years ago, quickly grew to be one of the
hottest bands in Denver and are now
touring after the release of their new 15-
track album, "Bad de Funk Mo'. "
They have opened for such bands as
2 Live Crew, the Red Hot Chili Peppers
and Primus. They also recently per
formed at The Gathering of the Tribes
tour.
If you are eager to catch a dextrous
and eclectic band, to hear some scratch
ing and R & B, and to feed your body
some heat and rhythm, The Jonez is the
gig to catch.
They play after the end of Big Game
Gaieties and will be preceded by a Kappa
Alpha Psi step show and, of course, a
fashion show by Marith£ & Francois
Girbaud.
