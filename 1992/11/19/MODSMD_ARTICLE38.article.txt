# Steamy (tunneling) adventures
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
Steam tunneling is a Stanford ritual right up there with
tongue jousting at Full Moon on the Quad and finding
the perfect lunch meat to wear to the Exotic Erotic.
The folklore surrounding the illegal act has swelled to
colossal proportions, piquing the interest of those stu
dents looking to dare University authority figures to
punish them. At last check, one could be expelled, jailed,
castrated or have their left breast cut off for being caught
invading the bowels of the Farm.
Unfortunately, the most highly trafficked tunnel,
starting from an easily liftable, square metal grate near
the back of Mem Chu, is not the Indiana Jones, thrill-a
minute experience one would imagine.
After making several security checks to make sure no
couple looking for that late-night study nirvana spies
the removal of the grate, the hearty steam-tunneler pops
the grate and shimmies down a metal ladder to the dirt
floor of the unlit tunnel.
Now several feet below ground level, the unexpected
guest is greeted by 110-degree dry heat, and the en
chanting surroundings of a three-foot tall, four-foot
wide arching brick tunnel built, no doubt, before struc
tural stability was a priority among architects.
The quaint brickwork and musty air lends to that im
minent feeling of doom, or claustrophobia, one gets while

imagining being squashed like a worthless cockroach dur
ing an earthquake, to be sealed up in a brick coffin as the
rats come to gnaw on your putrid, festering corpse.
After crawling about 25 yards on elbows and knees in
the soft dirt, leaves and junk food wrappers from the
70s, choking on the dust kicked up by others in your
party, the relentless pioneer reaches the end of the hot
ter part of the tunnel.
Due to construction waged by the University to repair
the flailing Geo building that was damaged by the earth
quake, thermal plastic strips have been installed in order to
trap the heat in certain less-travelled sections of the tunnels.
But it's not all bad.
After experiencing the initial discomfort of the tun
nel entrance and weathering the sweaty inconveniences
of the first sector, the thrill-seeker begins to adapt to the
environment. By then, brave steam tunnelers will have
overcome the fear that every large pipe running along
the floor and overhead will burn their flesh off and leave
them to live forever as hermits among the gnomes of the
steam tunnel underworld.
Soon you can almost stand up, as the tunnel changes
into a work area, arriving at the unguarded Geo build
ing where you feel gloriously wicked. At your disposal is
the scaffolding that anchors the injured building, giving
access to the caved-in first floor, just a short climb away.
Always the rebel, you'll rifle through the clipboard
left by the working crew, noticing an occasional "Hi!"
scribbled by previous uninvited visitors.
After realizing that you're hanging out under a con
demned building, and being scared off by the "Caution—
contains asbestos fibers" sign, you move on, finally meet
ing up with some really hot pipes to your right. Coming
up soon is a ladder connecting metal doors from the out
side world to the eerie, unhygienic world below.
Those who exit the tunnels through the subterranean
doorway, climbing up the metal rung ladder to lift off the
square metal grate to the side of a bike path in the outer
Quad, will leave transformed by their unlawful night
time activities, no longer afraid of Life Below Stanford.
From that moment on, steam grates on campus will
no longer be just smelly nuisances in White Plaza. You
will scrutinize the depth of each tunnel and wonder
whether it will be patrolled at night by police looking to
fill their Biking Under the Influence quotas, or sighted by
single men playing frisbee golf to vent their frustration.
On a whim, you will drop down into the ventilation
ducts beneath Meyer to run like a mutant hamster in the
huge, Habit Trail-esque circular pipes.
And maybe you'll even want to test the ever-so-enticing
electronically alarmed doors in the basement of Green.
