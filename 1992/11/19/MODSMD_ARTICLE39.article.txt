## Escape from Big Game 
### 
It's been two weeks since parents' weekend and
it's time to finally put all of those liquor bottles back
on your shelf. Why not fight off the urge to study
with an evening of loud music?
The Warfield is a fun place to be on its own —
there's plenty of open space to walk around, and the
bathrooms are spacious and clean. But what will
likely make the Warfield more interesting on Nov.
20 is The Jesus and Mary Chain, which will make
you want to jump up and down and generally
throw yourself around more than usual.
And why not start off the evening with Curve?
After all, this is the Rollercoaster U.S. Tour, so you'll
have to expect some ups and downs.
And if you think of the $18.50 cover as 76
games of Street Fighter 11, you really need to go.
Badly.
