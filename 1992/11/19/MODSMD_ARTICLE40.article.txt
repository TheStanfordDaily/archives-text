# Coffee & Sugar
## 
### 
Calvin and Hobbes' favorite cereal doesn't go
snap, crackle, pop. In fact, Sugarbombs actually prob
ably sound morelike a bluesy Neil Young or maybe the
Grateful Dead. And they go great with coffee.
Sugarbombs — a local bluesy, jazzy rock band
named after the favorite cereal of a comic strip char
acter — will perform a two-hour set at the Coffee
House Saturday night. The five-member group
plays mostly original pieces and cites Roy Orbison,
Grateful Dead and Neil Young as their greatest mu
sical influences.
The free concert, sponsored by IJ's Blues Cafe in
Mountain View, will last from 9to 11 p.m.
