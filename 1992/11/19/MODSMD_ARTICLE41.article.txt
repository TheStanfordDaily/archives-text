# The 						last word on...

### 
My name is Kiinbcrly, and I'm a recover
ing cheerleader.
It's been two years since I hung up my
pom poms. I'm not proud of my past, but I
can't seem to escape it. I still get up and cheer
at the mention of first downs. I sometimes
ride the bus, just for the hell of it. I often feel
an urge to limber up before a midterm. I get

misty whenever the L.SJUMB plays "Tequila"
or a Nike commercial comes on.
But cheerleading isn't all fun and foot
ball games. We "spirit officers," as adminis
trators are fond of calling us, have to deal
with embarassingly "cute" nicknames, itchy
polyester uniforms and grueling weekend
practices. We get bruises where we've been

accidentally kicked, dropped or stepped on.
Sure, I was ridiculed and objectified. But
no more so than J.J. And as long as
there are football players. Axe committees
and lascivious alumni, there will be cheer
leaders.
Grab a homer hankie and deal with it.
