For poor, aban
doned folks dur
ing the holidays:
Here are some things
to do that are un
doubtably more excit
ing than sleeping.
• See the Beastie
Boys on Nov. 25, at the
San Francisco Civic
Center. When asked
about hearing prob
lems later in the week
end, explain that you
listened to your lec
ture tapes a bit too
loudly.

• Memorize the phone numbers of
everyone in the new 1992-1993 Stanford Di
rectory. Or simply master the heavy book for
use as a hand-to-hand combat weapon.
Think about how painful 768 simultaneous
papercuts would be.
• Gather together with other friends
who are around for the weekend and lash
yourselves together to form a motley imita
tion of the Gates of Hell. Take pictures and
give them to your parents for Christmas.
Hint: Leer a lot.
• Head to the Haight, where shops sell
ing various drug paraphanelia mix with
those selling unusual leather goods and
"toys." Expect used clothing and people who
are living proof that those drugs in the '60s
had long term side effects.
• Explore the Steam Tunnels. No, don't
really. It's dangerous and illegal, darn it. You
shouldn't even think about it. Forget you
even read this. Study instead, or write a letter
to your mother.

Cure for Thanksgiving blue

You're stuck here for Thanksgiving
weekend and want to sing the blues. Why not
wait until Nov. 28 and let the Michael Os
born Band back you up? John Lee Hooker's
touring band will be performing a blues con
cert with a local blues band for a five-hour
concert to start at 8:00 p.m. at Jl's Blues Cafe
in Mountain View.
The $5 cover charge will benefit the
Community Services Agency. Bring toys or
canned food, and help people out. It's the
perfect way to ease your conscience and
enjoy yourself at the same time.
