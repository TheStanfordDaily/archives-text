# Cowell, Row houses lose summer storage
## 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Although June is still seven
months away, the Housing Office
has already dropped a summer
bombshell on students living in
Row and Cowell Cluster houses.
Beginning in June 1993, the
University will cancel storage for
students living in those dormito
ries. The move follows a budget
cutting decision last year to cancel
storage in all other dormitories.
Next year, the only houses on
campus that will provide storage
service to their residents are Chi
Theta Chi and Sigma Chi, which are
both independently owned, accord
ing to Assoc. Director of Residential
Education Elizabeth Hiyama.
In a letter given to all Row resi
dents, Housing officials said that
after three years of budget-cut
ting, "staff resources simply are
no longer available to devote to
student storage and all its related
problems."
Row and Cowell Cluster resi
dents responded angrily to the
University's decision. The move
will cause "inconvenience and an
unnecessary burden for students
to worry about at the end of the
year," said sophomore David
Boyer, who lives in Whitman.
The University, he said, should
make "cutbacks in other student

services but still keep storage for
convenience's sake."
The problems listed by the let
ter include the University's liabil
ity for items students store, which
"drains stafT time that is needed
elsewhere"; houses' problems
with meeting fire code specifica
tions; and the need to handle some
students' requests for access to
storage during the summer.
In addition, the letter said the
University needs the storage
space for use during summer con
ferences.
"Due to the pressing need to en
hance income, there is a big push
on to increase significantly the
number of conferences we host
each summer, starting immedi
ately," the letter said.
Since all of Wilbur Hall will be
closed next summer for renova
tion, Director of Housing and
Food Service Keith Guy said the
University will likely have to use
the Row and Cowell Cluster to
house conference guests.
Hiyama said the University
had hoped that it would not have
to stop storage beyond the dorms
but "as we looked into it more and
more," the Housing Office real
ized it had no choice.
Meeting fire code specifications
was another factor in the decision,
Hiyama said. In the past, there have
been problems with storing com
bustible materials and creating the
required amount of walking space.
Another big factor in the Uni
versity's decision was the issue of
responsibility and liability, Guy
said.
Guy said that while it is made
clear to students that they use on
campus storage "at their own
risk," if anything is missing it is

still "a iragor problem for both the
student and the University."
The letter given to Row residents
stated that "student responsibility
in locking dead-bolts ... for the
summer has been very uneven."
The security problem is com
pounded by the forced reduction in
staff due to budget cuts, which has
resulted in a lack of time that can
be spent monitoring storage and
opening it for students in emer
gency situations.
But junior Dave Toy said the
University could solve the liability
problem by having students sign a
strict disclaimer when they wish to

use storage. He added that he
"can't believe that there is that
much worthwhile conference
space in Slavianskii Dom," where
he lives.
Toy said "it seems like Res Ed
falls back on the fire code viola
tions for a lot of the measures they
want to push through."
While Guy said that bicycle
storage will still be available,
albeit on "a first-come, first
serve" basis, it will be up to each
student "to make a choice about
what to do with their belongings
â€” to either take them home or
rent a space."
