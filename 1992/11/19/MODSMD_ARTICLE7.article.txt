# Making the transition
## Some faculty may get places in Clinton administration 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Not long after Bill Clinton secured the presiden
cy earlier this month, another race began: the
scramble for jobs in Clinton's new administration.
While such sordid wrangling may seem undigni
fied in the cloistered world of academia, many say
several Stanford faculty members will soon join in
the subtle positioning for top posts.
By the time Clinton finishes assembling his ad
ministration in late January or early February, ob
servers say, the number of Stanford affiliates will
likely surpass the three that served during the Bush
administration — and could approach the dozen
who were involved in the Reagan administration.
The reasons are twofold, observers say: Warren
Christopher, a Stanford trustee who was the
board's president from 1985-1988, is the director of
the transition team; and Stanford faculty members,
many of whom worked in Clinton's campaign, tend
to gravitate toward liberal administrations.
"The candidate who gets elected feels he owes a
lot to people who supported the campaign from the
very first," said Hoover Institution senior fellow
Richard Burress, a White House aide during the
Nixon and Ford administrations. "These people are
going to have a strong claim on jobs."
And in a process that depends as much upon con
nections as competence, many say Christopher —
who has had a long affiliation with Stanford dating
back to law school in the 1940s — could play an im
portant role in bringing Stanford faculty members
to the transition team's attention.
"A lot of the people he knows are associated with
Stanford. Because he knows them, he knows their
capabilities," said Martin Anderson, a Hoover se
nior fellow and President Reagan's top domestic
policy adviser during the 1980s.
But former University President Donald
Kennedy downplayed Christopher's presence on
the transition team, saying he won't have much in
fluence on the team's actual selections.
"I don't think Chris is going to be involved so
much as a picker than as an organizer," said
Kennedy, who was head of the Food and Drug Ad
ministration during the Carter presidency. "I don't
have any reason to believe he is much likelier to call
on Stanford people than others."
Kennedy still expects the number of Stanford fac
ulty members in the presidential administration to
increase, however. He said a number of faculty mem
bers have an advantage because they specialize in
"the policy areas that have especially concerned this
campaign," such as health care and the environment.
While most people interviewed for this article
were reluctant to name specific candidates, they
said three disciplines have traditionally sent the
most faculty members to government and should
continue to do so. The disciplines include:
• Economics. During the Bush administration,
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin served as chair of
the Council of Economic Advisers and Economics
Prof. John Taylor served as a member of that council.
Clinton has named Harvard professor Robert
Reich to direct domestic policy during the transi
tion, and Reich's academic ties could lead him to
choose Stanford colleagues, Anderson said.
In addition, a number of Stanford economists —
including Nobel Prize-winner Kenneth Arrow —
supported Clinton during the campaign. The tran
sition team, Anderson said, will first consider "the
people who said, 'Look, we like this guy Clinton and
we politically support him.' "
• Arms control. Stanford's Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control has sent faculty
members to both Republican and
Democratic administrations.
Political Science Prof. Con
doleezza Rice served as special
assistant to President Bush for
Soviet affairs, while William Perry
— the center's co-director —
served as an undersecretary of
defense during the Carter admin
istration.
• Law. Both Bill and Hillary
Clinton were educated at Yale's
law school and are likely to pluck
talent from the faculty of the top
U.S. law schools, the New York
Times has reported.
A number of Stanford law pro
fessors have served in presidential
administrations — including Bar
bara Babcock, who headed the
civil division of the Justice Depart
ment during the Carter adminis
tration, and William Baxter, who
headed Justice's antitrust division
during the Reagan administra
tion.

There is "no one model" for fac
ulty members to follow in hunting
an administration job, said Taylor,
who served on President Bush's
Council of Economic Advisers.
"Some people will express
interest very openly; others will
try not to be quite so aggressive;
others will just wait until someone
comes," he said.
But Anderson, who headed the
domestic policy portion of Rea
gan's transition in 1980, said fac
ulty members who expect to rely
on their "reputation or written
works" are a "long shot." Instead,
they have to be involved in the
transition — "it helps to be the
one doing the picking" — or need
to use their contacts with those
directing the transition to make
themselves known.
One candidate who could bene
fit from that, he said, is Kennedy.
The former president worked
closely with Christopher, and
could be "high on the list" for a
Cabinet post — perhaps Secretary
of Education, Anderson said.
Burress, too, said Kennedy has
a chance at snaring an administra

tion job: "He's — what do you say
— between engagements."
But Kennedy dismissed the
possibility, calling it "so unlikely
it's not even worth talking
about." He added, however, that
he wouldn't "mind saying that I'd
be delighted to help in the transi
tion, and I've had some very pre
liminary conversations about
that."
Perhaps the most obvious
Stanford candidate for a top post
is Christopher himself. He has
been consistently mentioned as a
possible Secretary of State or
Attorney General.
While Christopher said when
accepting the directorship of the
transition that he assumed he was
taking himself out of the running
for a permanent post, Anderson
said that will not rule him out at
all.
"If President-elect Clinton
thinks he would make a good
Attorney General or Secretary of
State, [Clinton] would say, 'Fine,
I'm glad you feel that way, but let
me tell what I want you to do,' "
Anderson said.

"A lot of the people he knows are associated with
Stanford. Because he knows them, he knows their
capabilities," said Martin Anderson, a Hoover se
nior fellow and President Reagan's top domestic
policy adviser during the 1980s.
But former University President Donald
Kennedy downplayed Christopher's presence on
the transition team, saying he won't have much in
fluence on the team's actual selections.
"I don't think Chris is going to be involved so
much as a picker than as an organizer," said
Kennedy, who was head of the Food and Drug Ad
ministration during the Carter presidency. "I don't
have any reason to believe he is much likelier to call
on Stanford people than others."
Kennedy still expects the number of Stanford fac
ulty members in the presidential administration to
increase, however. He said a number of faculty mem
bers have an advantage because they specialize in
"the policy areas that have especially concerned this
campaign," such as health care and the environment.
While most people interviewed for this article
were reluctant to name specific candidates, they
said three disciplines have traditionally sent the
most faculty members to government and should
continue to do so. The disciplines include:
• Economics. During the Bush administration,
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin served as chair of
the Council of Economic Advisers and Economics
Prof. John Taylor served as a member of that council.
Clinton has named Harvard professor Robert
Reich to direct domestic policy during the transi
tion, and Reich's academic ties could lead him to
choose Stanford colleagues, Anderson said.
In addition, a number of Stanford economists —
including Nobel Prize-winner Kenneth Arrow —
supported Clinton during the campaign. The tran
sition team, Anderson said, will first consider "the
people who said, 'Look, we like this guy Clinton and
we politically support him.' "
• Arms control. Stanford's Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control has sent faculty
members to both Republican and
Democratic administrations.
Political Science Prof. Con
doleezza Rice served as special
assistant to President Bush for
Soviet affairs, while William Perry
— the center's co-director —
served as an undersecretary of
defense during the Carter admin
istration.
• Law. Both Bill and Hillary
Clinton were educated at Yale's
law school and are likely to pluck
talent from the faculty of the top
U.S. law schools, the New York
Times has reported.
A number of Stanford law pro
fessors have served in presidential
administrations — including Bar
bara Babcock, who headed the
civil division of the Justice Depart
ment during the Carter adminis
tration, and William Baxter, who
headed Justice's antitrust division
during the Reagan administra
tion.

There is "no one model" for fac
ulty members to follow in hunting
an administration job, said Taylor,
who served on President Bush's
Council of Economic Advisers.
"Some people will express
interest very openly; others will
try not to be quite so aggressive;
others will just wait until someone
comes," he said.
But Anderson, who headed the
domestic policy portion of Rea
gan's transition in 1980, said fac
ulty members who expect to rely
on their "reputation or written
works" are a "long shot." Instead,
they have to be involved in the
transition — "it helps to be the
one doing the picking" — or need
to use their contacts with those
directing the transition to make
themselves known.
One candidate who could bene
fit from that, he said, is Kennedy.
The former president worked
closely with Christopher, and
could be "high on the list" for a
Cabinet post — perhaps Secretary
of Education, Anderson said.
Burress, too, said Kennedy has
a chance at snaring an administra

tion job: "He's — what do you say
— between engagements."
But Kennedy dismissed the
possibility, calling it "so unlikely
it's not even worth talking
about." He added, however, that
he wouldn't "mind saying that I'd
be delighted to help in the transi
tion, and I've had some very pre
liminary conversations about
that."
Perhaps the most obvious
Stanford candidate for a top post
is Christopher himself. He has
been consistently mentioned as a
possible Secretary of State or
Attorney General.
While Christopher said when
accepting the directorship of the
transition that he assumed he was
taking himself out of the running
for a permanent post, Anderson
said that will not rule him out at
all.
"If President-elect Clinton
thinks he would make a good
Attorney General or Secretary of
State, [Clinton] would say, 'Fine,
I'm glad you feel that way, but let
me tell what I want you to do,' "
Anderson said.
Not long after Bill Clinton secured the presiden
cy earlier this month, another race began: the
scramble for jobs in Clinton's new administration.
While such sordid wrangling may seem undigni
fied in the cloistered world of academia, many say
several Stanford faculty members will soon join in
the subtle positioning for top posts.
By the time Clinton finishes assembling his ad
ministration in late January or early February, ob
servers say, the number of Stanford affiliates will
likely surpass the three that served during the Bush
administration — and could approach the dozen
who were involved in the Reagan administration.
The reasons are twofold, observers say: Warren
Christopher, a Stanford trustee who was the
board's president from 1985-1988, is the director of
the transition team; and Stanford faculty members,
many of whom worked in Clinton's campaign, tend
to gravitate toward liberal administrations.
"The candidate who gets elected feels he owes a
lot to people who supported the campaign from the
very first," said Hoover Institution senior fellow
Richard Burress, a White House aide during the
Nixon and Ford administrations. "These people are
going to have a strong claim on jobs."
And in a process that depends as much upon con
nections as competence, many say Christopher —
who has had a long affiliation with Stanford dating
back to law school in the 1940s — could play an im
portant role in bringing Stanford faculty members
to the transition team's attention.
