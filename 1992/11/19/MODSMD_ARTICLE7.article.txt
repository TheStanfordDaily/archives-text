# Making the transition
## Some faculty may get places in Clinton administration 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Not long after Bill Clinton secured the presiden
cy earlier this month, another race began: the
scramble for jobs in Clinton's new administration.
While such sordid wrangling may seem undigni
fied in the cloistered world of academia, many say
several Stanford faculty members will soon join in
the subtle positioning for top posts.
By the time Clinton finishes assembling his ad
ministration in late January or early February, ob
servers say, the number of Stanford affiliates will
likely surpass the three that served during the Bush
administration — and could approach the dozen
who were involved in the Reagan administration.
The reasons are twofold, observers say: Warren
Christopher, a Stanford trustee who was the
board's president from 1985-1988, is the director of
the transition team; and Stanford faculty members,
many of whom worked in Clinton's campaign, tend
to gravitate toward liberal administrations.
"The candidate who gets elected feels he owes a
lot to people who supported the campaign from the
very first," said Hoover Institution senior fellow
Richard Burress, a White House aide during the
Nixon and Ford administrations. "These people are
going to have a strong claim on jobs."
And in a process that depends as much upon con
nections as competence, many say Christopher —
who has had a long affiliation with Stanford dating
back to law school in the 1940s — could play an im
portant role in bringing Stanford faculty members
to the transition team's attention.
"A lot of the people he knows are associated with
Stanford. Because he knows them, he knows their
capabilities," said Martin Anderson, a Hoover se
nior fellow and President Reagan's top domestic
policy adviser during the 1980s.
But former University President Donald
Kennedy downplayed Christopher's presence on
the transition team, saying he won't have much in
fluence on the team's actual selections.
"I don't think Chris is going to be involved so
much as a picker than as an organizer," said
Kennedy, who was head of the Food and Drug Ad
ministration during the Carter presidency. "I don't
have any reason to believe he is much likelier to call
on Stanford people than others."
Kennedy still expects the number of Stanford fac
ulty members in the presidential administration to
increase, however. He said a number of faculty mem
bers have an advantage because they specialize in
"the policy areas that have especially concerned this
campaign," such as health care and the environment.
While most people interviewed for this article
were reluctant to name specific candidates, they
said three disciplines have traditionally sent the
most faculty members to government and should
continue to do so. The disciplines include:
• Economics. During the Bush administration,
Economics Prof. Michael Boskin served as chair of
the Council of Economic Advisers and Economics
Prof. John Taylor served as a member of that council.
Clinton has named Harvard professor Robert
Reich to direct domestic policy during the transi
tion, and Reich's academic ties could lead him to
choose Stanford colleagues, Anderson said.
In addition, a number of Stanford economists —
including Nobel Prize-winner Kenneth Arrow —
supported Clinton during the campaign. The tran
sition team, Anderson said, will first consider "the
people who said, 'Look, we like this guy Clinton and
we politically support him.' "
• Arms control. Stanford's Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control has sent faculty
