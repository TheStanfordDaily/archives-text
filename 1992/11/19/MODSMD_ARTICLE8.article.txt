## Former councilwoman forgoes politics for law school 
### Bill Ackerman 
Kim Mueller, a first-year student at the Law
School, knows when to follow her instincts. It is
the key to her optimism.
As a former Sacramento city councilwoman,
Mueller, 35, was a figure on the political scene
of California's capital city, but last spring she decid
ed to leave the political fast track for law school.
For someone who once contemplated a run for
the California State Assembly and was thought by
some to be a potential mayoral candidate, her ex
planation is quite modest.
"There are advantages to following your in
stincts," she says."I reflect on what motivates me
and simply trust my gut."
Ironically, Mueller's move came at a time when
California saw the significant advancement of fe
male politicians, as exemplified by the senatorial
victories of Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.
"Kim showed promise," says Sacramento Mayor
Anne Rudin. "Some expected her to go to the state
legislature or to another higher political office."
Mueller comfortably responds, satisfied with
her personal motivations.
"That's the way people perceive me," she says.
"I had opportunities for higher office, but regard
less of trends people do what's right for them. I'm
sure this trend will continue and whether or not
I'm the beneficiary remains to be seen."
Such personal resolve carried Mueller through
political battles with city administrators, real es
tate developers and government bureaucracy.
Executing her 1987 platform theme, "Work for
Your Neighlx)rhoods," she used a five-year term to
promote neighborhood needs, including civil rights,
city planning and preservation of the environment.

"Kim was especially attentive to disadvantaged
and minority concerns," says Mayor Rudin. "A
brilliant woman, she had a good mind when it
came to issues and ferreting out issues."

"She was attuned to the neigh
bors," adds Sacramento Bee re
porter liana Deßare. "When it
came to quality of life versus
downtown growth, she always
sided with quality of life."
But government service was not
always the most enlightening expe
rience, according to Mueller. Often
she found bright individuals frus
trated bv unresponsive systems.

"It was like an occupational hazard to care," she
says. "Particularly when it involved getting the bu
reaucracy to work for individual neighborhoods.
"There is so much dead weight," she adds. "Out
side needs and politicians' priorities are often the
same, yet somehow the system works against you."
Overcoming blizzards of manipulative politics
and personal adjustments to political compromis
es often proved disillusioning to Mueller and
prompted her move to law school, a decision that
astonished some of her political supporters.
"I was surprised when she left," said Kay Knep
prath. president of the Sacramento Old City Associa
tion. "When Mayor Rudin decided not to seek re-elec
tion, I had some hope that Kim would run for mayor."
But Mueller easily explains her move.
"I'm not here to retreat," she says, "Only to get
new tools."
She said she feels the law school will provide
the needed theoretical compliment to 10 years of


Mueller
practical learning and perhaps
prepare her for a career in the pri
vate sector.
Her perspective is also wel
comed by the law school, where
only about 10 percent of the stu
dents are older than 30.

"Kim lends an aspect of reali
ty to the class," says Law Prof.
Kim Taylor, who teaches crimi
nal law. "She has dealt with the
creation of statutes and legisla
tive intent and has personal
experience with the kinds of
debates that go on."
Adam Culbreath, a fellow stu
dent, has also felt Mueller's
impact.
"She brings a human face to

politics," Culbreath says. "If that's
the kind of politics that exists,
than she's given it a good name."
While her political future is
unclear, Mueller is optimistic that
she will stay involved one way or
another, even if she does pursue a
private career.
"This is an exciting time to be
involved in the public sector," she
says."The challenge is to make the
bureaucracy more responsive."

private career.
"This is an exciting time to be
involved in the public sector," she
says."The challenge is to make the
bureaucracy more responsive."
