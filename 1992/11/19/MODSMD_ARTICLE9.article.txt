French farmers protest U.S.
PARIS (AP) â€” French farmers burned an
American flag and clashed with riot police yester
day near the U.S. Embassy in a protest against
U.S. pressure to cut crop subsidies. About 20 offi
cers were injured.
France's Socialist government, facing a power
ful farm lobby and elections next spring, contin
ued to hang tough against European and U.S. calls
to cut price supports.
An agreement in trade talks that opened in
Washington yesterday may lead to a global accord
that could stimulate hundreds of billions of dollars
in new trade annually.
The Bush administration has threatened $300
million in punitive tariffs on European farm prod
ucts, mainly French white wine, unless the Euro
peans agree by Dec. 5 to cut subsidies to farmers
for growing soybeans and other oilseeds.
A statement from the office of President Fran

cois Mitterrand shed no new light on whether
France would use its veto power to block any
agreement made in Washington, but hinted it
might not.
