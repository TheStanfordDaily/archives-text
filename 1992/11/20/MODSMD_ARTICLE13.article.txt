Savimbi accepts election results
LUANDA, Angola (AP) — Rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi has accepted the results of Angola's first
democratic elections, raising hopes that a new
civil war can be averted, the U.N. representative
here said yesterday.
His earlier refusal to concede election defeat by
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and his ruling
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola —
MPLA — had threatened to plunge Angola back
into a civil war that killed 350,000 before peace
accords were signed in May 1991.
No decision in U.S.-EC talks
WASHINGTON (AP) — Negotiators from the
United States and Europe reported good progress
but no final breakthrough yesterday in their effort
to avert a global trade war that would triple the
price Americans pay for European white wine.

U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills stated
that both sides were "quite close together" in all
the areas under dispute and she said there would
be further talks soon.
Failure of the Washington talks to produce a
breakthrough means that the threat of a trade war
between the United States and its biggest trading
partner, the 12-nation EC, remains a possibility.
Superman fastest selling comic
NEW YORK (AP) - A speeding bullet? Hah!
The comic book detailing the death of Superman is
selling faster than any comic ever, forcing a second
press run to keep up with demand, its publisher
said yesterday.
The book — with an initial press run of about 3
million — arrived in stores Wednesday. Calls from
sold-out retailers prompted the decision for a second
run of books, said Bristow. New copies will be cranked
out over the weekend and in stores by Nov. 23.
