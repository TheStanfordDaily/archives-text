SACRAMENTO (AP) - Cali
fornia faces a $7.5 billion deficit
over the next 19 months, the third
consecutive year of crippling bud
get shortages for the recession
weakened state, the Legislature's
nonpartisan fiscal adviser said yes
terday.
"We believe actually that this is
a conservative estimate," said leg
islative analyst Elizabeth Hill. She
said the projected deficit through
June 1994 could rise to $9.3 billion
because officials overestimated the
savings gleaned from earlier cuts
in health care for the poor and
other programs.
With unemployment up to 9.8
percent — the highest of the
nation's industrialized states —
and increased demands for welfare
and health care, the flow of tax

money into state coffers has been
limited, she said.
Hill's estimates include more
than a half-billion dollars lost to
the state by the voters' decision on
Nov. 3 to repeal the snack tax, plus
the expiration of a temporary half
cent increase in the statewide sales
tax. Hill said the state has 120,000
fewer jobs than projected earlier,
and that more than 800,000 jobs
have been lost in California since
May 1990.
"We don't see any sign that it
(the economy) is improving," she
added.
The bleak economic picture was
disclosed just 10 weeks after Cali
fornia adopted its 1992-93 budget,
a $57 billion spending plan that
cut deeply into state programs.
The budget was approved after

a two-month political impasse
between Republican Gov. Pete
Wilson and the Democrat-con
trolled Legislature during which
California issued $3.6 billion
worth of lOUs to pay some of its
bills. It was the first time since the
Great Depression that the state
was forced to use lOUs.
But Hill said that budget made
fiscal projections that have since
been superseded by the deteriorat
ing economy.
"The budget passed in Septem
ber. .. assumed that the economy
would be coming out the recession
by the end of calendar 1992," Hill
said. "We're practically at the end of
calendar year 1992, and we're not
out of the recession," she added.
"We don't think it will be ending in
the (1992-93) budget year."
