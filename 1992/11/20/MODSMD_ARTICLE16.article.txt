Whether hero or villain,
Columbus' contribution
historically significant

FOR A DEAD MAN, Christo
pher Columbus sure has been
getting a lot of press lately.
After enjoying centuries of praise
and fame as a great explorer, his
hero status has rightly been called
into question by many social critics.
One such critic, Stanford stu
dent Russ Calleros, has taken
action by circulating a petition ask
ing that Columbus Day be renamed
Indigenous People's Day; when
completed, the petitions will be pre
sented to the Palo Alto City Coun
cil. If approved by the Council, Palo
Alto would join Berkeley as the only
American cities to make this
change.
But regardless of whether
Columbus was a hero or demon, his
arrival on this continent was a sig
nificant, indeed a defining moment
in American history that deserves
commemoration, if not celebration.
And a name change will do nothing
to change the root of the problem
Calleros' is attempting to address.
A more appropriate solution
would be to choose a different day
to name "Indigenous People's Day"
and retain Columbus Day, but
rethink the way it is commemorat
ed, using the occasion to reflect
upon both the heroism and the
injustice on which this country was
built.
The United States, throughout
its based its expansionist
policies on a philosophy of Manifest
Destiny; our forefathers rational
ized away their violence toward
Native Americans with the idea
that it was God's intention for
Americans to conquer and control
the land from the Atlantic to the
Pacific.
It was a convenient theory to be
sure, a brilliant distortion that
allowed the United States govern
ment to justify breaking nearly
every treaty it ever made with Indi

an nations.
For those of us living in the Unit
ed States today — who believe in
what the country stands for — this
embarrassing history creates inter
nal conflicts that are difficult to
resolve.
The United States is currently
one of the world's only integrated,
multi-racial societies. And this
diversity is one of the characteris
tics that defines us against other
homogeneous countries.
As Calleros and like-minded crit
ics point out, celebrating Colum
bus' achievements implies an
acceptance of, or worse, a satisfac
tion with, the brutalities begun
under his reign.
However, a commemorative holi
day need not be celebratory, and in
the case of Columbus Day, a move
toward a more reflective view of the
day has already begun.
The controversy surrounding
Columbus Day led to a massive
downscaling of quincentennial
events this Fall. And ironically, the
controversy over the holiday has
brought more attention to the
unfair treatment of Native Ameri
cans than has any other modern
event. Indeed, the history of Native
Americans, barring America's
three-hour love affair with a Kevin
Costner film, has not received the
attention that other civil rights
movements have.
Hence, Native-American act
ivists have appropriately seized on
Columbus Day as a cause for
protest and awareness-raising. But
rather than take a distinctly Euro
centric holiday and adopt it as their
awn j*rwitvWould be more appropri
ate to create a separate holiday —
on a date that has particular signif
icance to the Native American com
munity.
Since most Americans haven't a
clue as to which events or individu
als hold significance for Native
Americans — or whether the indi
vidual nations have any collective
heroes — this resolution would also
serve bring Native Americans more
securely into the American con
sciousness.
