Anti-Columbus Day movement based on faulty logic

A STORY IN WEDNESDAY'S
Daily reports on a petition, dis
tributed by junior Russ Calleros,
aimed at changing Columbus Day into
Indigenous People's Day in the city of
Palo Alto. The petition states that the
significance of Columbus' arrival in
America is a "pain that exists in the
many drops of blood that stain the
pages of history."
Calleros' petition, like other protests
against Columbus' Day, is based on a
crucial, but unstated, premise: that
each person must define their identity
by the racial group to which they have
been born.
America 500 years ago was thinly

populated by hunter-gatherer tribes,
with a very low life expectancy and high
infant mortality. The people lived with
constant tribal wars, under strict tribal
hierarchy and with all individual choic
es suppressed and subordinated to the
tribe.
In contrast, people of all races in
America today are living much longer
and more comfortable lives because of
the benefits of technology. They are
enjoying political freedom, and have the
opportunity to make choices and live
their lives by their own judgement and
values. Thus, all people in America
today — whether they are white, Native
American or any other race — are bene

ficiaries of Columbus' arrival.
And yet, according to Calleros and
his supporters, a Native American
today, simply because of his race, must
identify with his ancestors of several
centuries ago, accept their values and
mourn the events that destroyed their
society, no matter how much he, as an
individual, has benefitted from these
events.
Ultimately, differing reactions to
Columbus Day are based on different
basic philosophies of life. Most cultures
in history held the individual to be an
insignificant fragment of the tribe, who
had no right to choices or values that
interfered with those of his tribe, reli

gion or race.
• Western culture, in contrast, devel
oped the ethics — given their full for
mation in the 20th century by Ayn
Rand — that holds the individual as an
end in himself, with the right and
responsibility to make his own value
choices, form his own identity, live his
own life and achieve his own happi
ness.
It is this ethics that made possible all
the achievements of Western culture.
By this ethics, Columbus Day is a great
occasion for celebration.
