# Band leaders ask fans to refrain from hurling fruit at 1992 Big Game
## 
### 
Each year, Cal and Stanford face off
in the most exciting game of the season
to see which team is worthy of The Axe
Each year, fans from either side of the
Bay gather to support their team. Each
year, a hail of frozen fruit from both
ends of the stadium damages equip
ment and injures people. And each
year, drunken fans jump the wall with
hopes of tackling the Tree or unmask
ing Oski.
This year will hopefully prove dif
ferent. Security has been increased
and officers will not hesitate to act in
order to keep the chaos to a minimum
Violation of Memorial Stadium poli
cies will result in ejection from the
stadium, at the very least. It is sad
that such strict policies must be put
into effect, but hopefully, stadium
personnel will not have to resort to
them.

As representatives of the Stanford
Band and the Cal Band, we would like
to remind fans on both sides that Big
Game is, in fact, just a game. It is
played for the enjoyment of the players
and the fans, and the atmosphere
should reflect that.
A healthy rivalry adds to the spirit of
the game, but unwarranted behavior
detracts from the positive experience
the game should provide. No one is sug
gesting that a display of pride in one's
school is offensive or detrimental to the
game. But please show your support or
disapproval vocally and visually rather
than ballistically.
One hundred years of Big Game has
provided Cal and Stanford fans with
incredible football and lasting memo
ries of their alma matters. In 1992 and
in the future, let's work together to
ensure that the memories continue to
be positive.
