# Pro-Life group declares that life commences at conception, so do rights

Stanford's Pro-Choice Alliance con
tinues to deny the humanity of the pre
born child, as evidenced by Maryling
Yu's letter to The Daily on Wednesday,
Nov. 11.
Specifically, Yu reported that first
trimester abortions look like "one to
three tablespoonfuls of red, cotton
like, unrecognizable tissue per fetus."
Stanford Students for Life now
asks this group to consider what the
tissue looks like in the womb before
the abortion.
"Physicians, biologists, and other
scientists agree that conception
marks the beginning of the life of a
human being — a being that is alive
and is a member of the human
species.
There is overwhelming agreement
on this point in countless medical, bio
logical and scientific writings" (Con-

gressional Report, 1981).
After conception, the egg develops
rapidly into distinct tissue. Near the
end of the third week the child's heart
begins beating.
At three and one-half weeks, the
child "has the beginnings of eyes,
spinal cord, nervous system, thyroid
gland, lungs, stomach, liver, kidney
and intestines" (Life,l96s). Fur
ther, brain waves have been detected
by an Electroencephalogram (EEG)
40 days after conception (JAMA,
1964).
At six and one-half weeks, the baby
"weighs approximately one-thirtieth of
an ounce [andl has all the internal
organs of the adult in various stages of
development" (Life,l96s). Thus, by the
time the baby amounts to less than one
tablespoon, the tissue is distinctly
human.
When discussing abortion, informa
tion on fetal development must be con
sidered in order to make intellectually
honest decisions.
