# Gym delayed 'til December

### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
Construction on a $16.6 million athletic facility
housing the offices and facilities of both Encina Gym
and the Department of Athletics is scheduled to begin
in December — a month after the project was original
ly slated for completion.
The new Stanford Athletics Center will be built on
the lacrosse field between Maples Pavilion and the
Tennis Stadium.
Arrangements have been made with the lacrosse
and rugby teams to relocate their playing field else
where on campus. According to Manager of Special
Projects Ben Asaro, one option under consideration is
leveling Encina Gym and turning the area into a field.
The new center is funded mostly by gifts and dona
tions, including a $1.4 million gift from Nike chairman
and founder Philip H. Knight, an alumnus of the Grad
uate School of Business.
In addition, the $2 million slated for earthquake re
pairs on Encina Gym — which has to be evacuated by
1995 — will also be used toward the new construction,
said Ted Leland, director of athletics.
Planners delayed the project, which had been
scheduled for completion this month, to add an addi
tional floor. A complete basement was built under the
two stories to better consolidate all of the athletic func

tions into one structure, said Asaro.
The revised Stanford Athletics Center will be com
pleted and operating by the beginning of school next
year, he said.
"It's time we got our athletic and our recreational
facilities up into the 20th-century," Leland said.
The center will house offices for all athletic teams, a
full-size basketball practice court, a 120-seat auditori
um and a hall of fame room representing all teams.
According to Asaro, one of the main goals of the ex
pansion into another floor is to "pull" the athletic
coaches closer to the administrative offices.
A dining room capable of holding up to 290 people
and a kitchen area will also be included in the center.
The basement will hold large locker and shower
areas for women and men as well as a large fitness
room with weights, stationary bikes and Stairmas
ters. The room will accommodate all weight training
needs, including varsity weight training, Asaro said.
This move will eliminate the need to keep some
weight training equipment in Roble Gym and will re
place Encina Gym.
After the University built the Ford Center two
years ago, this project was next "on the athletic wish
list" in trying to respond to student needs, he said.
The addition will create an athletic quad, which will
be surrounded by the tennis courts, deGuerre and
Maples Pavilion, he said.
