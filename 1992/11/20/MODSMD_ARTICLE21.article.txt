## Last chance for nookie 
### 
MID-TERMS ARE OVER. During
the three weeks before finals,
pedantic pursuits momentarily
give way to carnal cravings.
As Stanford students groggily emerge
from their self-imposed social hibernations,
they are beginning to notice members of
the opposite sex, and they like what they
see. Obviously, standards have plummeted.
So this is it. The last chance of the
quarter to slip in a little nookie. "But
how," you men ask, stomachs sinking,
"can I get this nookie?"
You cowering slugs. The women at this
school crave originality; they want style,
panache and swashbuckling adventure in
a date — and it's about time we men deliv
er the goods.
After years of trial and error and error
and error, I have come up with some inno
vative dating ideas that are guaranteed to
set your prospects' loins aflame (or at least
defrost them a little) without wasting too
much money.
Avoid the pedestrian — let her know
you're an original, a veritable gateway to a
world of mystery. While on your date,
carry a large, unidentifiable mass in a
burlap sack over your shoulder, and refuse
to let her know what it is. Now there's
intrigue for you!
Better yet, go to an East Palo Alto pawn
shop and pick up a cheap handgun. Carry
it with you at all times, making sure it
bulges conspicuously in your heavy over

coat. If she fails to take notice, "acciden
tally" drop it in front of her, and take your
own sweet time picking it up. She'll think
she's on a mission with James Bond.
The most important part of any date is
dinner, and this must be approached with
both elan and savoir fair. You can take
your date to an expensive restaurant and
enjoy the ambiance without paying the
price: Bring your own food. If PB and J
isn't good enough for her, then maybe
she's not good enough for you.
Make sure to go down swinging when
the maitre d' tries to throw you out; fights
are really impressive, and there's always a
chance that she'll nurse your mangled
body back to health.
If you can't afford PB and J, there's
always an alternative. Take your date to 7-
11 and treat her to an extravagant five-fin
ger discount meal. There are many
delectable frozen entrees that will fit neat
ly into the pockets of your bulky overcoat
(the beef and bean chimichanga is strong
ly recommended)
If you're not one for breaking the law,
you have your pick of any of the free condi
ments available at the numerous fast food
establishments surrounding our campus.
Combine them all into a hearty paste that
will delight even the most discriminating
palate (the Taco Bell hot sauce adds a
spicy touch of the exotic — she'll think
you're a real gourmand). Spread your con
coction on the free food service crackers

and enjoy!
If you want to show your date how
deeply you feel about her, choosing the
right gift is crucial. Any shmuck can buy
flowers, so give her a gifl from the heart —
puppies! They're cute as can be, and you
can get them for a song and a dance at the
local pound. Wrap the little rascal in news
paper and watch her melt.
Finally, you're standing with the
woman of your most Freudian dreams
outside her dorm, wanting nothing more
than to floss her teeth with your tongue.
Drenched in cold sweat, your undergar
ments cling to your trembling body.
The mood is right. The time is now.
You have to leave her with something to
remember you by. Rip out a dump of your
hair and place it tenderly in the palm of
her hand. Gaze through her eyes and into
the very depths of her soul, and then turn
and run like a wild gazelle. If she hasn't
fallen for you by now, you will undoubted
ly haunt her dreams forever.

puppies! They're cute as can be, and you
can get them for a song and a dance at the
local pound. Wrap the little rascal in news
paper and watch her melt.
Finally, you're standing with the
woman of your most Freudian dreams
outside her dorm, wanting nothing more
than to floss her teeth with your tongue.
Drenched in cold sweat, your undergar
ments cling to your trembling body.
The mood is right. The time is now.
You have to leave her with something to
remember you by. Rip out a dump of your
hair and place it tenderly in the palm of
her hand. Gaze through her eyes and into
the very depths of her soul, and then turn
and run like a wild gazelle. If she hasn't
fallen for you by now, you will undoubted
ly haunt her dreams forever.

Pete Huyck co-wrote this with Stanford
alumnus Alex Gregory back when The
Daily thought as much of their writing as
Jennifer Connelly thinks of Joel Stein's.
