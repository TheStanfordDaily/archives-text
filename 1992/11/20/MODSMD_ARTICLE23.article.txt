## Magical Milburn looks for more Big Game records 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
Two years ago, Glyn Milburn strode onto the
Memorial Stadium carpet and had nothing short of
the game of his life. In that, his first Big Game, Mil
burn and the word "explosive" were inextricably
enjoined. A conference-record 379 all-purpose yards
later, the national spotlight had found a new target.
The experts saw a bright, flashy tailback with
limitless potential. He could burst through the hole
and into the secondary with amazing quickness. He
had soft hands — a great receiver out of the back
field. When he returned kicks, "dangerous" was too
mild an adjective. He was a touchdown waiting to
happen.

1 feel badly that we haven't been
able to get him the ball in the
open field as much as we'd like
to. He's had an excellent year.'
- Bill Walsh

Still a sophomore, Milburn was already being
penciled in as a sure Ail-American, possibly a future
Heisman trophy winner. Lofty expectations these
were, and rarely had they been heaped upon a col
lege football player of such physical stature. At 5-
foot-9, 175 pounds, speed and great moves weren't
just offensive assets, they were tools of survival.
Tomorrow, Milburn returns to the scene of his
first Big Game, as the Cardinal looks to preserve
their five-year stranglehold on The Axe. For his Bay
Area finale, the locale is a fitting one.
"Going back to the place where I had one of my
best games, if not my best game, is really an appro
priate way to end," Milburn said. "And I'd love to be
able to duplicate what I did two years ago."
Perhaps unfairly, many have long been waiting
for him to do just that — duplicate what he did in
the 1990 Big Game. Milburn himself is included in
that bunch.
While he says the expectations placed upon him
after that performance have affected him "both pos
itively and negatively," he doesn't shy away from
admitting he felt added pressure.
"People, I think, expected me to have that type of
game in every game I played from then on. That
caused me to put a lot of pressure on myself. And
when I didn't perform up to that level, I tried to do
something extraordinary to make up for it.
"I just wasn't going out and enjoying myself. I
wasn't playing the way I had been playing before I
had gotten all the attention."
The two years since Milburn's record-breaking
Big Game performance, though laden with success
es, have been tumultuous ones.

He entered 1991 as a Heisman candidate. But a
knee injury slowed him in the early season. Then, as
Denny Green's power-oriented running game devel
oped, Milburn was forced to play second fiddle to
backfield mate Tommy Vardell. The fact that his tal
ents were by then widely known didn't help either.
Defenses have a way of trying to shut down a team's

most explosive weapon, and, make no mistake about
it, Milburn was still that man.
As Bill Walsh took the reigns of this season's
Stanford team, he promised to do whatever he could
to feature and exploit Milburn's talents.
"I expect to use Glyn as we used (Stanford's all
time leading rusher) Darrin Nelson in 1977 and

'78," Walsh said before the season began. "We plan
on taking advantage of all of his abilities."
And to a certain extent the Cardinal has been able
to do just that. Milburn has had a season worthy of
All-Pac-10 honors. This year only two college players
have bettered his per-game average of 176 all-pur
pose yards; just three boast numbers higher than his
16.8 yards per punt return. He has rushed for over
800 yards, and with 12 touchdowns this season he
has already doubled his entire career total.
Walsh recognizes Milburn's success this season,
but he speaks almost remorsefully about what could
have been.
"I feel badly that we haven't been able to get him
the ball in the open field as much as we'd like to,"
Walsh said. "He's had an excellent year, no question
about it. But I was hopeful it would be a phenome
nal year.
"It really has no connection with him, from the
standpoint of his effort level. We just haven't been
able to set up a platform from which he can embark
on a great year."
If Walsh's high hopes for Milburn had gone
unanswered in the first 10 games, all that changed
with last Saturday's game against Washington
State. Milburn scored three touchdowns, two on
electrifying runs from 31 and 21 yards, and rushed
for 89 yards. The usually mild-mannered Milburn
even let his excitement flow into a few post-TD
showboat acts.
Looking back at Milburn's career, you see Heis
man predictions that were left unfulfilled. First
team Ail-American honors, still a possibility, are also
unlikely. It's clear now that maybe the expectations
— there's that word again — were set too high.
But make no doubt about it, Milburn has had an
absolutely stellar Cardinal career. He will leave
Stanford ranked second in career all-purpose
yardage, and third in career rushing. And as much
as anyone on the Farm in the last three years, he
has played a fundamental part in lifting Stanford's
program to national prominence.

about it. But I was hopeful it would be a phenome
nal year.
"It really has no connection with him, from the
standpoint of his effort level. We just haven't been
able to set up a platform from which he can embark
on a great year."
If Walsh's high hopes for Milburn had gone
unanswered in the first 10 games, all that changed
with last Saturday's game against Washington
State. Milburn scored three touchdowns, two on
electrifying runs from 31 and 21 yards, and rushed
for 89 yards. The usually mild-mannered Milburn
even let his excitement flow into a few post-TD
showboat acts.
Looking back at Milburn's career, you see Heis
man predictions that were left unfulfilled. First
team Ail-American honors, still a possibility, are also
unlikely. It's clear now that maybe the expectations
— there's that word again — were set too high.
But make no doubt about it, Milburn has had an
absolutely stellar Cardinal career. He will leave
Stanford ranked second in career all-purpose
yardage, and third in career rushing. And as much
as anyone on the Farm in the last three years, he
has played a fundamental part in lifting Stanford's
program to national prominence.

Senior Glyn Milburn looks to repeat his 379-yard Big Game effort of two years ago in his final Big Game
performance.
Two years ago, Glyn Milburn strode onto the
Memorial Stadium carpet and had nothing short of
the game of his life. In that, his first Big Game, Mil
burn and the word "explosive" were inextricably
enjoined. A conference-record 379 all-purpose yards
later, the national spotlight had found a new target.
The experts saw a bright, flashy tailback with
limitless potential. He could burst through the hole
and into the secondary with amazing quickness. He
had soft hands — a great receiver out of the back
field. When he returned kicks, "dangerous" was too
mild an adjective. He was a touchdown waiting to
happen.

1 feel badly that we haven't been
able to get him the ball in the
open field as much as we'd like
to. He's had an excellent year.'
- Bill Walsh

Still a sophomore, Milburn was already being
penciled in as a sure Ail-American, possibly a future
Heisman trophy winner. Lofty expectations these
were, and rarely had they been heaped upon a col
lege football player of such physical stature. At 5-
foot-9, 175 pounds, speed and great moves weren't
just offensive assets, they were tools of survival.
Tomorrow, Milburn returns to the scene of his
first Big Game, as the Cardinal looks to preserve
their five-year stranglehold on The Axe. For his Bay
Area finale, the locale is a fitting one.
"Going back to the place where I had one of my
best games, if not my best game, is really an appro
priate way to end," Milburn said. "And I'd love to be
able to duplicate what I did two years ago."
Perhaps unfairly, many have long been waiting
for him to do just that — duplicate what he did in
the 1990 Big Game. Milburn himself is included in
that bunch.
While he says the expectations placed upon him
after that performance have affected him "both pos
itively and negatively," he doesn't shy away from
admitting he felt added pressure.
"People, I think, expected me to have that type of
game in every game I played from then on. That
caused me to put a lot of pressure on myself. And
when I didn't perform up to that level, I tried to do
something extraordinary to make up for it.
"I just wasn't going out and enjoying myself. I
wasn't playing the way I had been playing before I
had gotten all the attention."
The two years since Milburn's record-breaking
Big Game performance, though laden with success
es, have been tumultuous ones.

He entered 1991 as a Heisman candidate. But a
knee injury slowed him in the early season. Then, as
Denny Green's power-oriented running game devel
oped, Milburn was forced to play second fiddle to
backfield mate Tommy Vardell. The fact that his tal
ents were by then widely known didn't help either.
Defenses have a way of trying to shut down a team's

most explosive weapon, and, make no mistake about
it, Milburn was still that man.
As Bill Walsh took the reigns of this season's
Stanford team, he promised to do whatever he could
to feature and exploit Milburn's talents.
"I expect to use Glyn as we used (Stanford's all
time leading rusher) Darrin Nelson in 1977 and

'78," Walsh said before the season began. "We plan
on taking advantage of all of his abilities."
And to a certain extent the Cardinal has been able
to do just that. Milburn has had a season worthy of
All-Pac-10 honors. This year only two college players
have bettered his per-game average of 176 all-pur
pose yards; just three boast numbers higher than his
16.8 yards per punt return. He has rushed for over
800 yards, and with 12 touchdowns this season he
has already doubled his entire career total.
Walsh recognizes Milburn's success this season,
but he speaks almost remorsefully about what could
have been.
"I feel badly that we haven't been able to get him
the ball in the open field as much as we'd like to,"
Walsh said. "He's had an excellent year, no question
about it. But I was hopeful it would be a phenome
nal year.
