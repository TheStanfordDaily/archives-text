# Cardinal football out to skin Golden Bears
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
It's only been a year since both Stanford and Cal
ifornia were up-and-coming Pacific 10 conference
powerhouses. Only a year since they played out the
94th installment of their Axe-centric rivalry in
front of a live national audience. The 1991 Big
Game had serious postseason bowl implications,
and the Bay Area was immersed in successful col
lege football.
Fifty-two weeks later, the story almost holds
true — well, actually half true. Exactly one-half
true.
The Cardinal is again headed to a bowl game,
likely a New Year's Day bowl, with a Big Game win.
They are 8-3 and could finish second in the Pac-10
for the second-straight year.
California, on the other hand, bears no resem
blance to the team that took the field one year ago.
Cal is 4-6, tied for eighth place in the conference.
Not surprisingly, they will spend the holiday season
in hibernation.
However, none of this is particularly relevant to
the outcome of the 95th Big Game. Big Games have

a penchant for bringing out the best in underdogs.
They tend to produce unexpected, heart-stopping
finishes. Not many feel this Saturday's contest will
deviate from the rule.
"There's a lot of history in each one of these
games," said Cardinal coach Bill Walsh. "When you
take the field, the place is full and enthusiastic . . .
you know you're in the Big Game."
And, Walsh hopes, "When it's over you'd like to
have some camaradarie with the opposing school."
Unfortunately., the players haven't always seen it
that way.
"It may be a friendly, competitive rivalry
between the alumni," said defensive lineman Este
van Avila. "But there's really no love lost between
the players. We really like beating these guys."
In other words, nobody is ever short on reasons
to get fired up for Big Game.
"They're our Bay Area rivals," Avila continued.
"We compete in the same papers and they like to
talk about us a lot. They always try to personify us
as rich kids who drive around in nice cars and eat
caviar.
"So we'd like to go in there and show them we can
play football just as well as they can, if not better."

Show them again, that is. The Cardinal hasn't
fallen to the Bears since 1986, which means no one
in the Stanford camp has tasted defeat in the Big
Game.
And while that streak will be on everyone's
minds as they enter Memorial Stadium, it's defi
nitely not the Cardinal's lone motivating factor.
"I've heard that people are saying Cal has noth
ing to lose in this game," Avila said. "But the truth
is we can't afford to give up a lost • ither."
Not if a New Year's Day appearance is still in
their plans. An 8-4 finish would pretty much put
Stanford out of the Jan. 1 running, and point them
toward the Hancock Bowl.
A third straight win (and an 1 lth-straight
November victory), however, would give the Cardi
nal an excellent shot at finishing the season in the
Fiesta Bowl.
Big Game notes: This will be an historic game
of sorts, as it marks the 100 th anniversary of the
first Big Game. The Cardinal leads the cross-bay
series 46-37-11. The game will also be the 10th
