# No.2 Stanford squad aims to sink No.1 Cal in Big Splash
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
With athletic contests, con
cerns over rankings and records
often overshadow the simple
pride of victory itself.
But although tomorrow's
annual Big Splash at Berkeley
features the nation's top two
water polo teams in No. 2 Stan
ford and No. 1 California, the
struggle will take place solely
for pride.
The Cardinal has already lost
twice to the Golden Bears this
season, so a win will neither vault
Stanford to the top of the polls
nor give it the No. 1 seed in the
NCAA championship tourna
ment.
Conversely, undefeated
defending national champion
California is favored heavily, so
a Cardinal loss will not lower
the team in the eyes of poll
sters. Thus, the focus on tomor
row's encounter will be on the
long and glorious tradition of
water polo at Stanford and Cal
ifornia.
Since the early 19205, the
Cardinal has competed against
the Bears in water polo. But
national championship tour

neys only began in 1969 and,
since that time, the Bay Area
rivals have dominated the
sport.
Along with producing more
Olympians than any other
schools, Stanford and Califor
nia have combined to capture
15 national titles out of 23 total
opportunities.
The Cardinal took home six
of those trophies, while the
Bears received the other nine.
Considering the fact that Stan
ford's water polo program only
became autonomous from the
swimming program and hired
its own coach in 1974, the aver
age of one national title every
three years is even more
impressive.
Five of those Stanford cham
pionship seasons occurred after
the arrival of current head
coach Dante Dettamanti in
1977.
Despite all his accomplish
ments — five titles in 13 NCAA
final four appearances — Det
tamanti's squad has not beaten
Cal in the last three years.
According to the Cardinal
coach, much of Stanford's prob
lem in recent seasons stems
from the Bears' more successful

recruiting. He noted that year
after year, California signs
players whom Stanford did not
admit based on academic or
other considerations.
Of course, recruiting con
cerns won't worry Dettamanti
during tomorrow's possible pre
view of the NCAA finals. The
Stanford coach has four other
factors to attend to.
First, the Cardinal will be on
constant alert to prevent scor
ing opportunities from passing
by.
In its last contest against
Cal, Stanford capitalized on
only two out of six six-on-five
power play advantages, and
couldn't convert on two penalty
shots.
If the Cardinal had managed
to score when given such
chances, it would have won 13-
11 instead of losing 11-7.
Second, Stanford will test
different defenses against the
Bears' trademark fast-break
counterattack.
"But we want to save some
thing for the NCAAs, so we're
not going to do things that are
too different," Dettamanti said.

Stanford Water Polo looks to dethrone the top-ranked Weenie squad for national bragging rights. Play
ing without Wolf Wigo, the Cardinal hopes to win its first Big Splash since 1990.
Third, the Cardinal will focus
on the play of the centerforward
position. Defensively, it must
prevent Cal's 6-foot-6, 220-
pound, German Olympic tpam
member Dirk Zeien and junior
Troy Barnheart from powering
in points from only two meters
in front from the goal.
Zeien and Barnheart account
ed for four of the Bears 11 total
points in the last meeting.
Offensively, Dettamanti said,
though outside shooting has

improved, Stanford needs
greater production from its own
centerforwards.
Finally, the Cardinal will
have to triumph without the ser
vices of scoring leader Wolf
Wigo. The sophomore will miss
Big Splash after straining his
back in a scrinimage lsst w^ek.
Since the emergence of Stan
ford water polo as an entity of its
own in 1974, the Cardinal has
amassed a record of 34-36-3
against California. The last time
the Cardinal prevailed in a Big
Splash was in 1990 at deGuerre
Pool. This year's match will begin
at 10:30 a.m. Saturday morning.

a Cardinal loss will not lower
the team in the eyes of poll
sters. Thus, the focus on tomor
row's encounter will be on the
long and glorious tradition of
water polo at Stanford and Cal
ifornia.
Since the early 19205, the
Cardinal has competed against
the Bears in water polo. But
national championship tour

neys only began in 1969 and,
since that time, the Bay Area
rivals have dominated the
sport.
Along with producing more
Olympians than any other
schools, Stanford and Califor
nia have combined to capture
15 national titles out of 23 total
opportunities.
The Cardinal took home six
of those trophies, while the
Bears received the other nine.
Considering the fact that Stan
ford's water polo program only
became autonomous from the
swimming program and hired
its own coach in 1974, the aver
age of one national title every
three years is even more
impressive.
Five of those Stanford cham
pionship seasons occurred after
the arrival of current head
coach Dante Dettamanti in
1977.
Despite all his accomplish
ments — five titles in 13 NCAA
final four appearances — Det
tamanti's squad has not beaten
Cal in the last three years.
According to the Cardinal
coach, much of Stanford's prob
lem in recent seasons stems
from the Bears' more successful

recruiting. He noted that year
after year, California signs
players whom Stanford did not
admit based on academic or
other considerations.
Of course, recruiting con
cerns won't worry Dettamanti
during tomorrow's possible pre
view of the NCAA finals. The
Stanford coach has four other
factors to attend to.
First, the Cardinal will be on
constant alert to prevent scor
ing opportunities from passing
by.
In its last contest against
Cal, Stanford capitalized on
only two out of six six-on-five
power play advantages, and
couldn't convert on two penalty
shots.
If the Cardinal had managed
to score when given such
chances, it would have won 13-
11 instead of losing 11-7.
Second, Stanford will test
different defenses against the
Bears' trademark fast-break
counterattack.
"But we want to save some
thing for the NCAAs, so we're
not going to do things that are
too different," Dettamanti said.

Stanford Water Polo looks to dethrone the top-ranked Weenie squad for national bragging rights. Play
ing without Wolf Wigo, the Cardinal hopes to win its first Big Splash since 1990.
Third, the Cardinal will focus
on the play of the centerforward
position. Defensively, it must
prevent Cal's 6-foot-6, 220-
pound, German Olympic tpam
member Dirk Zeien and junior
Troy Barnheart from powering
in points from only two meters
in front from the goal.
Zeien and Barnheart account
ed for four of the Bears 11 total
points in the last meeting.
Offensively, Dettamanti said,
though outside shooting has

improved, Stanford needs
greater production from its own
centerforwards.
Finally, the Cardinal will
have to triumph without the ser
vices of scoring leader Wolf
Wigo. The sophomore will miss
Big Splash after straining his
back in a scrinimage lsst w^ek.
Since the emergence of Stan
ford water polo as an entity of its
own in 1974, the Cardinal has
amassed a record of 34-36-3
against California. The last time
the Cardinal prevailed in a Big
Splash was in 1990 at deGuerre
Pool. This year's match will begin
at 10:30 a.m. Saturday morning.
