# Cardinal squeaks out Blue and Gold victory
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Stanford then proceeded to go on an 11-4
run to take a 27-26 lead with 7 minutes, 22
seconds left to play in the opening half. The
positive aspect of this three minute run for
Stanford was that it was accomplished with
the Cardinal's leading scorer, Williams,
resting on the bench.
The teams traded baskets for most of the
second half, once the fleet team came back
from a 45-39 halftime deficit. Especially
impressive was the play of the Fleet guards.
A 1 Lewis (St. Mary's *89) was 8-for-16 from
the field, including three 3-pointers and fin
ished with a game-high 24 points. Kevin
Weeks (USF '92) added 14 points for the
Blue and Gold.
"We've got a lot of work to do, but it was
a real good game for us because of the style
of play — they played a lot of man-to-man
(defense), preventing us from running
things and making us think out there," said

Stanford coach Mike Montgomery.
But what gave the Cardinal the most
trouble were the Fleet's big men, Curry and
Eric Bamberger, who finished with 16 and
12 points respectively. Both out-muscled
their lighter counterparts, Manley, Lam
mersen and freshman Darren Allaway.
"They were able to go inside any time
they wanted to," Montgomery said. "We
were out-physicalled and had a hard time
matching up."
In the final minute of regulation, Stan
ford trailed by two points, 84-82. After
Dan Curry missed a shot on the Fleet end
of the floor and no foul was called, Lollie
quickly pushed the ball up the floor and
found shooting guard Peter Dukes. Dukes
attempted a game-winning three pointer
with one second left on the clock, and was
fouled. He made the First two of his free
throws, but missed the third, forcing

In a fast-paced contest with little defense
on either side, the Stanford basketball team
defeated the AAU Blue and Gold Fleet 93-92
in overtime before a sparse crowd at Maples
Pavilion.
Stanford was led by forward Brent
Williams, who had 21 points, and the stabil
ity of Marcus Lollie, who finished with 18
points and five assists. Guard Peter Dukes
added 13 points.
The frontcourt for Stanford, however,
was erratic; at times, both Todd Manley and
Bart Lammersen showed confidence in the
post, while at other points their inexperi
ence was very evident.
The Fleet opened up an early lead in the
first half, holding a six-point margin over
the Cardinal at the 10-minute mark. But

overtime.
In overtime, the scoring was again back
and-forth. With five seconds left in the extra
period, Williams made a five-foot bank from
the right side to give Stanford a one-point
lead.
The Fleet had a chance to win on its final
possession, but forward Erik Newman trav
elled, turning the ball over to Stanford with
two ticks left. The Cardinal then ran out the
clock to preserve the victory.
"Stanford played a real gutty game," said
Fleet coach Shawn Cox. "They showed a lot
of determination and never gave up."
Montgomery used all 11 of the players at
his disposal during the exhibition, as
injuries continue to plague the Cardinal.

overtime.
In overtime, the scoring was again back
and-forth. With five seconds left in the extra
period, Williams made a five-foot bank from
the right side to give Stanford a one-point
lead.
The Fleet had a chance to win on its final
possession, but forward Erik Newman trav
elled, turning the ball over to Stanford with
two ticks left. The Cardinal then ran out the
clock to preserve the victory.
"Stanford played a real gutty game," said
Fleet coach Shawn Cox. "They showed a lot
of determination and never gave up."
Montgomery used all 11 of the players at
his disposal during the exhibition, as
injuries continue to plague the Cardinal.
Forward Jason Weaver (tendonitis in the
knee), forward Andy Poppink (lower back
pains) and guard Bobby Patton (swollen
calf) watched from the sidelines.
Stanford then proceeded to go on an 11-4
run to take a 27-26 lead with 7 minutes, 22
seconds left to play in the opening half. The
positive aspect of this three minute run for
Stanford was that it was accomplished with
the Cardinal's leading scorer, Williams,
resting on the bench.
The teams traded baskets for most of the
second half, once the fleet team came back
from a 45-39 halftime deficit. Especially
impressive was the play of the Fleet guards.
A 1 Lewis (St. Mary's *89) was 8-for-16 from
the field, including three 3-pointers and fin
ished with a game-high 24 points. Kevin
Weeks (USF '92) added 14 points for the
Blue and Gold.
"We've got a lot of work to do, but it was
a real good game for us because of the style
of play — they played a lot of man-to-man
(defense), preventing us from running
things and making us think out there," said

Stanford coach Mike Montgomery.
But what gave the Cardinal the most
trouble were the Fleet's big men, Curry and
Eric Bamberger, who finished with 16 and
12 points respectively. Both out-muscled
their lighter counterparts, Manley, Lam
mersen and freshman Darren Allaway.
"They were able to go inside any time
they wanted to," Montgomery said. "We
were out-physicalled and had a hard time
matching up."
In the final minute of regulation, Stan
ford trailed by two points, 84-82. After
Dan Curry missed a shot on the Fleet end
of the floor and no foul was called, Lollie
quickly pushed the ball up the floor and
found shooting guard Peter Dukes. Dukes
attempted a game-winning three pointer
with one second left on the clock, and was
fouled. He made the First two of his free
throws, but missed the third, forcing

In a fast-paced contest with little defense
on either side, the Stanford basketball team
defeated the AAU Blue and Gold Fleet 93-92
in overtime before a sparse crowd at Maples
Pavilion.
Stanford was led by forward Brent
Williams, who had 21 points, and the stabil
ity of Marcus Lollie, who finished with 18
points and five assists. Guard Peter Dukes
added 13 points.
The frontcourt for Stanford, however,
was erratic; at times, both Todd Manley and
Bart Lammersen showed confidence in the
post, while at other points their inexperi
ence was very evident.
The Fleet opened up an early lead in the
first half, holding a six-point margin over
the Cardinal at the 10-minute mark. But
