# Gerhard Casper joins in Greek football frenzy
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
It's finally over. Like that 18th
installment of "I Claudius," this
painfully esoteric practice we call
"da Greeks" is about to be as dead
and buried as Zachary Taylor —
ready to be resurrected as the
curious whim of a college student.
And who better to commemo
rate the burial than the very man
who slapped the coffin shut on
our man Don Kennedy? Yes,
that's right kiddies, the meister
of diezeister, the iibermensch of
the Farm, Gerhard Casper has
agreed to put on a laurel leaf in
place of the Prussian cap he nor
mally dons.
But Casper, as all who know
and love him are aware, is a
thinking man. A U of Chicago
man, if you will. A law scholar,
dammit. Football is about as
familiar with his ilk as are light
sauces and flaky pastry.
So, in an effort of goodwill
unheard of since that 1948 U.N

Resolution, Cap let Provost Ger
ald Lieberman — a New York Jew
— to pick all the games besides
Stanford. Vat a guy.
And thus the time passes to
say goodbye to a tradition. Not a
tradition of excellence per se, but
a tradition of filling this space
with mindless drivel.
So I pass on the reins to you,
my complacent reader. You must
learn from what we taught you.
You now have the power to go
home and pick your own games.
Use this knowledge in your own
lives.
To be honest, I think we've all
outgrown this whole Greek thing.
They conjure up images of, well,
of tired metaphors built around
half-accurate, oftentimes mistak
enly Roman, mythology. And
nobody needs to deal with that on
a Friday.
Yeah, I'm sad to leave you. But
I'm sadder about leaving that
weekly $20 check.
Goodbye fame and fortune.
Hello Buck Montana.
