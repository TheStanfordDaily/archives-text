# Indirect-cost rule changes unlikely to help Stanford
## Threaten system of grad student funding 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
The federal government is ex
pected to end the practice of paying
a portion of graduate students' tu
ition through indirect costs when
it announces new nationwide regu
lations, perhaps by the end of the
month. This shift could potentially
cost the University up to $12 mil
lion per year and jeopardize the
status of up to 25 percent of the
graduate students at Stanford.
The new regulations, given to
The Daily by sources in both the
University and the government,
appear to have incorporated sever
al recommendations offered by
Stanford, including implementing
pre-determined, multi-year cost
reimbursement rates and simpli
fying accounting procedures.
However, the changes most
likely to impact Stanford are the
ending of tuition remission, the in
clusion of student service expens
es in administrative cost pools and
a new 24 percent administrative
cost threshold that effectively caps
reimbursement.
Chief Financial Officer Peter
Van Etten said it was "hard to com
ment" specifically on the "rumors
heard by the University," but pre
dicted that the costs Stanford
would be eligible to claim could drop
between 2 and 4 percent and cost up
to $5 million — independent of the
issue of tuition remission.
When the federal government
unilaterally set Stanford's rate at
60.3 percent last month, boosting
it from 55.5 percent, Van Etten
said that the University's actual
costs under the existing rules jus
tified a rate of about 64 percent.
"If the changes which we've
heard rumored go through, I don't
see any way" for the justifiable
costs to increase much above the
current 60.3 percent. Van Etten
said. "But it i3 hard to see without
the final language."
Changes to the federal indirect
cost regulations — known as Circu
lar A-21 — came under discussion
by the Office of Management and
Budget soon after the indirect-cost
controversy began two years ago.
After a series of embarrassing
revelations about inappropriate
expenses charged as indirect costs
by Stanford, the federal govern
ment discovered problems at uni

versities nationwide, spurring the
design of a set of new regulations.
In the meantime, the govern
ment set the University's cost re
imbursement rate at 55.5 percent,
costing Stanford roughly $25 mil
lion per year.
Indirect costs are the expenses
associated with research that can
not be attributed to any individual
project, such as utilities and li
braries, and they represent more
than 20 percent of the Universi
ty's operating budget.

Van Etten and others familiar
with the process of revising the
regulations have predicted that
new rules will be announced by
Nov. 30, and the government will
allow public comment for either a
month or 45 days before seeking
the signature of the president.
The House Subcommittee on
Oversight and Investigations has
also tentatively scheduled a hear
ing for Dec. 3 to hear the proposed
regulations, and only government
officials are expected to be allowed
to testify.
But Tom Bruce, a spokesman

for the Office of Management and
Budget, said the revisions are still
being refined, saying it is "hard to
say" when they will be announced.
"I haven't seen a timetable,"
Bruce said, adding he did not know
whether the implementation of
new regulations might not occur
until the new administration
takes over the White House.
Regardless of when the changes
to Circular A-21 are announced, the
proposed new regulations are likely
to have a great impact on Stanford's
indirect-cost reimbursement.
Specifically, they will impact:
• Tuition remission. The govern
ment's practice of partial reim
bursement to the University for
the tuition of graduate students
involved in federally sponsored re
search has been under review for
more than a year.
Stanford officials warned last
year that ending the procedure
could cost as much as $12 million
per year or force Stanford to trim
its number of graduate students
by 25 percent.
But yesterday Van Etten said
those predictions — including his
own — were an "extreme reac
tion."
"I hope that it is not as cata
strophic as we once feared, and I
hope in the next couple of weeks to
know how bad the impact would
be," he said.
If Stanford were not reim
bursed for the tuition of graduate
students involved in research
through indirect costs, the Uni
versity would likely be left with
two options — either to charge the
tuition as a direct cost of a grant or
pay the tuition itself.
Either choice could force re
searchers to rely more heavily on
"cheaper" postdoctoral students
as research assistants rather than
doctoral students.
Assuming tuition remission is
ended, Van Etten said the Univer
sity would ask the government to
phase the new procedures in over a
period of four or*five years — "the
life of a graduate student."
Given that Stanford is one of
only a handful of universities to
use tuition remission, the ending
of the practice was not surprising.
• Multi-year rates. As the Univer
sity requested earlier this fall, the
