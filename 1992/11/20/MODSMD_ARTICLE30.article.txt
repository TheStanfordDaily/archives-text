# Cardinal looks to shut out Weenies
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
Stanford fans will probably not
have to wait until Saturday to see
n largely superior Cardinal team
. . 'an overmatched California
squad. Tonight, the No. 2
women's volleyball team will trav
el to Berkeley to face the rival
Golden Bears in this year's second
Big Match.
Stanford (22-2, 15-2 in Pacific
10 Conference) occupies the sec
ond-place spot in the conference
behind No. 1 UCLA, and wraps up
its 1992 Pac-10 schedule in Berke
ley tonight.
California (11-15, 6-11 in Pac
-10) dropped two straight matches
last week in Washington State,
and is looking to redeem itself
with a win over Stanford tonight.
The Bears are led into the match
by junior middle blocker Cara
Dane, who leads the team with
327 kills, 100 blocks, and a .221
hitting average. Outside hitter
Shaney Fink is hitting .215 with
44 blocks and 292 digs, and is sec
ond on the team in kills with 319.
Stanford brings an aggressive,
fast-paced offense to Berkeley
tonight, led by seniors Bev Oden
and Jennifer Jackson, along with
freshman hitter Cary Wendell.
Oden hit a combined 28 kills
against two opponents in Wash
ington State last weekend, includ
ing 17 kills and a .342 hitting per
centage against Washington. Jack
son recorded 13 kills, seven digs,
and a .524 hitting average in that
match.
Wendell was named Pac-10
Player of the Week along with
UCLA's Natalie Williams for her
play in last weekend's matches.
Wendell is the second Stanford
player to hold that honor this year
and the first freshman to be
named Player of the Week since
Oden and Williams shared the
honor in 1989.

Stanford defeated the Golden
Bears in the teams' last meeting
on Oct. 13, 15-13, 15-12, 15-3.
Jackson led the Stanford charge
with 13 kills and 11 digs in that
match, while Oden, Wendell and
Paaso had 12 kills each. Senior tri
captain Carrie Feldman added 48
assists and a .833 hitting percent
age in that match with five kills
and five digs.
For California, Fink and Dane
led the way with 11 kills each on
the match. The match marked
California's 19th-straight loss to
the Cardinal, and Stanford leads
the overall series 30-3. California,
however, has not been swept by
Stanford in Harmon Gym since
1988.
Next week, the Cardinal hosts
its final home match of the year
against San Jose State. Graduat
ing seniors Oden, Paaso, Jackson,
Feldman and tri-captain Laurie
Sawin will be honored in their last
regular-season appearance in
Maples Pavilion.
Stanford then travels to Stock
ton, Calif, for the Banker's Classic
Tournament, Nov. 27-28. The
Cardinal will face No. 13 UC-
Santa Barbara in the first round,
followed by the winner of the No.
4 Pacific-No. 18 Texas Tech
match.
NCAA Tournament seedings
will be announced the following
day, where it is expected that,
should the Cardinal hold on to its
No. 2 national ranking, it will be
moved out of the West Region and
made a No. 1 seed in another
region.
If the seedings were announced
today, Stanford would travel to
the Mideast Region as the No. 1
seed ahead of No. 6 Illinois. The
Cardinal will almost definitely
host a first-round match at Maples
Pavilion Dec. 4 or Dec. 5, and has
high hopes of reaching the Final
Four, which will be in Albu
querque, N.M., Dec. 17-19.
