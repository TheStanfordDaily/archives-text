### Brian Border Staff writer 
When the women's basketball team final
ly opens their season against the Belgium
National Team tonight at Maples Pavilion,

going a strenuous conditioning regime for
the last month and spending the past two
weeks in grueling practices, the Cardinal
squad is eager to compete in against a real
opponent.
Having lost only two players from last
year's championship team (Ann Adkins grad
uated and junior Kelly Dougherty transferred
to Vanderbilt), the Stanford squad figures to
enter this season with a considerable head
start over other teams in their quest to win
back to back national titles.
The Cardinal gained a further comparative
advantage, travelling to France this summer
to play in the eight-team 1992 Eurostars
Tournament. The team squared off against

Tonight's matchup with Belgium will give
the Stanford squad another taste of the excit

"This game will be real entertaining to
watch because European teams like Belgium
tend to play at a very up-tempo pace," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
VanDerveer emphasized that this season
opening competition will provide her with a
good opportunity to view her players in a

game situation.
"In order to determine which groups of
players perform the best together, I am plan
ning to play a lot of people and at the same
time experiment with many different person
nel combinations," she said.
VanDerveer said she is particularly inter
ested in seeing the performances of standout
freshman Bobby Kelsey and sophomore Kate
Paye, who is expected to start in place of
senior Molly Goodenbour. The senior
returned home this weekend for family rea
sons. She said she has also been impressed
with the improvement of other non-starting
players who have added depth and balance to
the team.
Considering how much time the Cardinal
has spent in their preseason training, Van-
Derveer said she expects her Stanford squad
to put out a strong effort tonight, no matter
what the final score turned out to be.
"Our players have been working very hard,
and we are an experienced team playing with
a lot of confidence," she said.
