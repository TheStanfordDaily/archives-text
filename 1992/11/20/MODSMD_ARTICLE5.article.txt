# 'Tis the season to make mischief
## Big Game pranks have become as traditional as white picket fences 
### June Fang Staff writer 
It's that time of year again when the
traditional autumn colors make their
annual appearance in the Bay Area.
But forget about yellow, rust or
brown. Real autumn colors — cardinal
and white, blue and gold — signal the
onslaught of Big Game pranks.
Many say the pranks are a seasonal
manifestation of festering animosity.
"It's an offshoot of the rivalry," said se
nior John Chang.
Aah, tradition.
Some pranks and jokes have become
part of the Stanford lexicon as tradition
al "Beat Cal" displays. As early as the
turn of the century, Stanford students
were known to have happily axed stuffed
bears donning the UC-Berkeley colors.
The extensive use of school colors is a
typical characteristic of most Big Game
pranks, as evidenced by the blue and
gold paw prints scattered across the
Post Office and White Plaza this year.
Some students are critical of UC-
Berkeley's apparent dearth of imagina
tion when it comes to pranks, though.
"Their prank was surprisingly lame.

Cal sucks on the field and they also suck
when it comes to pranks," said fresh
man Emily Jones.
Both schools vie for first in painting
the "Welcome to South San Francisco -
the Industrial City" sign the appropri
ate school colors, with Stanford concen
trating on painting the "S" and "U" red
as UC-Berkeley attempts to retaliate by
repainting the "C", "A" and "L" a royal
blue.

'All the Weenies seem to
know how to do is paint
on things.'

"We were able to get to the South San
Francisco sign first — and there is no
way they can beat that," said Jones,
once again critiquing UC-Berkeley
prank strategy.
In 1975, several merry pranksters
succeeded in painting the normally yel
low "C" on Berkeley's Tightwad Hill a
bright red, much to the dismay of the

Weenies. Past UC-Berkeley pranks have
included spray painting various parts of
campus from the billboards outside of
the stadium to inside the Rodin Sculp
ture Garden.
"That episode with the Rodin Sculp
ture Garden was heinous," said Jones,
referring to an incident where big mus
taches were painted on the statues.
Despite such spirited attempts,
sophomore Ken Johnson feels that UC-
Berkeley lacks artistic flair.
"Stanford seems to be more creative.
All the Weenies seem to know how to do
is paint on things," he commented.
But the color wars are not limited to
land.
During the pre-drought era, students
of both campuses would see a miracu
lous change in fountain water from its
normally clear state to either blood red
in Berkeley or a Tidy Bowl blue here.
Vats of "Mr. Bubble" have also creat
ed the appropriate mayhem by frothing
up the Claw in White Plaza till it resem
bled a large washing machine. Fortu
nately, Lake Lag is usually bone dry at
this time.
Unforgettable
Despite the appeal of the more
standard and traditional pranks,
the most memorable are the unusu
al. An unforgettable prank often
stands out for the amount of gener
al havoc and mayhem it wreaked.
Four years ago, a group from
the third floor of Branner
equipped a remote control car with
smoke shield devices. They placed
it on the field during Big Game and

waited for the optimal moment.
When the UC-Berkeley band
started marching, the Brannerites
drove the car around the field trail
ing smoke and successfully
screened the coughing band from
the crowd, creating the illusion of
a giant ''Weenie Roast."
A hoard of red and white mice
were also released in a Berkeley
library several years ago.
In a stunt UC-Berkeley stu
dents will remember for a long
time, the brothers of the Zeta Psi
fraternity unfurled a 65-foot ban
ner from the top of Berkeley's
Campinelle Tower reading "Indi
ans" in 1975. One member stole

into the carillon room of the
Campinelle and played the "Mick
ey Mouse Club" theme song for 20
minutes on their set of bells, much
to the curiosity and dismay of the
crowds that had gathered below.
While most of the pranks are
done in school spirit and the desire
to outdo the competition, others
have had ulterior motives.
Will Ervin, after being expelled
from Stanford, made an unsuc
cessful attempt to steal back The
Axe from the Berkeley campus.
His rationale: by returning The
Axe to its proper home, perhaps he
too would be allowed back on cam
pus.

It's that time of year again when the
traditional autumn colors make their
annual appearance in the Bay Area.
But forget about yellow, rust or
brown. Real autumn colors — cardinal
and white, blue and gold — signal the
onslaught of Big Game pranks.
Many say the pranks are a seasonal
manifestation of festering animosity.
"It's an offshoot of the rivalry," said se
nior John Chang.
Aah, tradition.
Some pranks and jokes have become
part of the Stanford lexicon as tradition
al "Beat Cal" displays. As early as the
turn of the century, Stanford students
were known to have happily axed stuffed
bears donning the UC-Berkeley colors.
The extensive use of school colors is a
typical characteristic of most Big Game
pranks, as evidenced by the blue and
gold paw prints scattered across the
Post Office and White Plaza this year.
Some students are critical of UC-
Berkeley's apparent dearth of imagina
tion when it comes to pranks, though.
"Their prank was surprisingly lame.

Cal sucks on the field and they also suck
when it comes to pranks," said fresh
man Emily Jones.
Both schools vie for first in painting
the "Welcome to South San Francisco -
the Industrial City" sign the appropri
ate school colors, with Stanford concen
trating on painting the "S" and "U" red
as UC-Berkeley attempts to retaliate by
repainting the "C", "A" and "L" a royal
blue.

'All the Weenies seem to
know how to do is paint
on things.'
— Ken Johnson

"We were able to get to the South San
Francisco sign first — and there is no
way they can beat that," said Jones,
once again critiquing UC-Berkeley
prank strategy.
In 1975, several merry pranksters
succeeded in painting the normally yel
low "C" on Berkeley's Tightwad Hill a
bright red, much to the dismay of the

Weenies. Past UC-Berkeley pranks have
included spray painting various parts of
campus from the billboards outside of
the stadium to inside the Rodin Sculp
ture Garden.
"That episode with the Rodin Sculp
ture Garden was heinous," said Jones,
referring to an incident where big mus
taches were painted on the statues.
Despite such spirited attempts,
sophomore Ken Johnson feels that UC-
Berkeley lacks artistic flair.
"Stanford seems to be more creative.
All the Weenies seem to know how to do
is paint on things," he commented.
But the color wars are not limited to
land.
During the pre-drought era, students
of both campuses would see a miracu
lous change in fountain water from its
normally clear state to either blood red
in Berkeley or a Tidy Bowl blue here.
Vats of "Mr. Bubble" have also creat
ed the appropriate mayhem by frothing
up the Claw in White Plaza till it resem
bled a large washing machine. Fortu
nately, Lake Lag is usually bone dry at
this time.
Unforgettable
Despite the appeal of the more
standard and traditional pranks,
the most memorable are the unusu
al. An unforgettable prank often
stands out for the amount of gener
al havoc and mayhem it wreaked.
Four years ago, a group from
the third floor of Branner
equipped a remote control car with
smoke shield devices. They placed
it on the field during Big Game and

waited for the optimal moment.
When the UC-Berkeley band
started marching, the Brannerites
drove the car around the field trail
ing smoke and successfully
screened the coughing band from
the crowd, creating the illusion of
a giant ''Weenie Roast."
A hoard of red and white mice
were also released in a Berkeley
library several years ago.
In a stunt UC-Berkeley stu
dents will remember for a long
time, the brothers of the Zeta Psi
fraternity unfurled a 65-foot ban
ner from the top of Berkeley's
Campinelle Tower reading "Indi
ans" in 1975. One member stole

into the carillon room of the
Campinelle and played the "Mick
ey Mouse Club" theme song for 20
minutes on their set of bells, much
to the curiosity and dismay of the
crowds that had gathered below.
While most of the pranks are
done in school spirit and the desire
to outdo the competition, others
have had ulterior motives.
Will Ervin, after being expelled
from Stanford, made an unsuc
cessful attempt to steal back The
Axe from the Berkeley campus.

Axe to its proper home, perhaps he
too would be allowed back on cam
pus.
