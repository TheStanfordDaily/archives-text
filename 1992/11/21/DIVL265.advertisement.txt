The Best Test Takers
Have Learned to Think
Like Test Makers.
There comes a time
in the career of all /
potential college or :
graduate students -'yjpjPw
when a standard
ized test score .
stands between ;
them and admis- it JK
sion to the school LPv
of their choice. yrv DI
And that can be i-l fp
a problem. W II
Because standard- rj «S
ized tests don't
really measure jff'f/sf -
your ability as a VFj£;\*'yj
student; they
measure your opto
ability to take
standardized tests.
Which means even <i|
the best student won't
necessarily score up to :
his or her true ability.
Tke way le achleve , *>H
your highest score on standard
ized tests is to learn something
they don't teach in school —
how to think like the people who
develop standardized tests. At
KAPLAN, that's precisely what
we teach. With over 50 years
experience and 150 test
researchers, we carefully disscct
every test we teach, including die
GMAT, the CiRE, the LSAT and
the MCAT. And we offer courses
to prepare students for them.
