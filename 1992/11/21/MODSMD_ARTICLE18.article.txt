# California/Stanford Match-ups
## 
### 
At the beginning of the season,
Glyn Milburn was a Heisman Tro
phy candidate, and Jerrott Willard
was a little known sophomore who
had taken a back seat to teammate
and fellow inside linebacker Mick
Barsala in the pre-season hype.
But Barsala has faltered, and
Willard has emerged as one of the
best linebackers in the nation.
With an unbelievable 124 tackles,
Willard leads the Pac-10 in total
tackles made. But Willard's excel
lant speed will be needed to take
down the quick and elusive Mil
burn, who looks to end his Pac-10
career on a high note.

Russell White began the season as
a candidate for Ail-American and
Heisman Trophy honors, and has
shown that he is one of the pre
mier running backs in the nation.
The Cal senior currently ranks
first in the Pac-10 and 13th in the
NCAA in rushing, and looks to
return to his 1990 Big Game form
in which he gained 177 yards and
274 all-purpose yards in a losing
cause. On the other side of the
ball, Tom Williams and the stingy
Cardinal defense, ranked ninth
overall in the nation, hopes to
limit White to less than the 89
yards he gained last year.

With tailback White, wide receiver
Sean Dawkins completes perhaps
the best one-two offensive punch
in college football. Dawkins ranks
first in the Pac-10 and 11th in the
nation in receiving yards, averag
ing just over 92 yards a game. The
junior receiver is only 74 yards
away from becoming only the fifth
player in Pac-10 history to attain
1,000 yards in receptions. Stand
ing in Dawkins way, both figura
tively and literally, will be Darrien
Gordon, who many call the finest
cornerback in the Pac-10. Gordon
is an integral part of the fourth
best pass defense in the nation.

Very quietly, Bear quarterback
Dave Barr is having a very good
season. The sophomore is com
pleting 59 percent of his passes,
and has thrown for 2,073 yards
and 16 touchdowns, second and
first in the conference, respec
tively. However, this week Barr
will have to contend with one of
the fiercest pass rushes in the
country, no small part of which is
Estevan Avila. The fifth-year
senior is putting together an out
standing season, which has
included eight quarterback
sacks, and a safety scored on his
last play in Stanford Stadium.

Perhaps the only thing which has
kept Steve Stenstrom's good sea
son from being an outstanding
season has been his penchant to
get sacked. Whether it has been
the junior quarterback's reluc
tance to get rid of the ball, or the
shoddy-at-best protection of his
offensive line, Stenstrom has
been sacked this season more
than 40 times, as compared to 18
sacks last season. Scott Roseman,
who leads Cal defenders with six
quarterback sacks, will head a
Bear pass rush made that much
more hungry when fueled by the
fierce competition of Big Game.

Martinez may be big in guts, but
Lasley is big all over. While Mar
tinez spends most of his day try
ing to get his all-too-silly, all-too-
Berkeley "cause" publicized in
places like Newsweek magazine,
Lasley is out on the field, proving
his manliness in somewhat more
subtle ways. Although it may be
better than stalking University
chancellors, Martinez's activism
is as tired and retro as the Black
Crowes. Plus, we don't have to
stare at Lasley's butt while we sit
in class unless we chose to do so.
Helmet over flimsy bandana says
it all: Lasley over Martinez.
