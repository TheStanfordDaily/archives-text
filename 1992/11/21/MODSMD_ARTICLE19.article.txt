# Wetnight's role expands, becomes 'money' receiver
## 
### Rich Stolz 
In the past two games, the
Stanford offense seems to have
developed a special kind of confi
dence, one that will take the Car
dinal to a bowl game. A critical
piece of this offense throughout
the season, and especially since
the revitalization of the offense, is
starting tight end Ryan Wetnight.
Wetnight stands 6-foot-3,
weighing 220 pounds. His position
requires a specialized athleticism:
tough enough to handle the pass
rush, but nimble enough to run
with the receivers.
Head coach Bill Walsh has
always highly utilized the tight
end. With the San Francisco
49ers, he developed ex-Santa
Clara University Bronco Brent
Jones into almost as dangerous a
threat as his two famous wide
receivers, John Taylor and Jerry
Rice.
Wetnight describes his position
as unique because his duties lie
somewhere in between those of a
wide receiver and a lineman. He
has to be able to defend the quar
terback as well as run pass routes
that will get him into the open
field.
"In many respects, the tight
end position requires more
responsibility than some of the
other positions on the field," said
Wetnight.
In fact, under the Bill Walsh
offensive scheme, many duties
have been placed on the shoulders
of No. 86. Each play requires the

tight end to perform in a different
manner, whether running routes
against man-on-man or zone
defenses or staying on the line to
protect the quarterback. Oflen it
is his responsibility to pick up
blitzing outside defenders and
block for the run.
Wetnight attributes his success
to receiving coach Mike Wilson
and blocking and lineman coach
Scott Schuhmann.
"I've learned a lot under Coach
Walsh and [Coach 1 Wilson, espe
cially how to slide away from
defenders and run routes into the
open," said Wetnight.
But today all eyes, especially
Wetnight's, are on Big Game.
"The excitement and the hype
make it great. I'm really looking
forward to it." For the quiet Wet
night, this is an unusually aggres
sive statement.
In fact, this will be only the sec
ond Big Game for the senior tight
end, as his first two years were
spent at Fresno City College. Wet
night said his first game against
Cal remains a highlight in his
Stanford career.
"I caught a touchdown in the
Big Game last year. I'll always
remember that," said Wetnight.
And well he should. The catch was
a spectacular reception in the cor
ner of the end zone. According to
Wetnight, that experience almost
equals the thrill of beating Notre
Dame in Indiana and USC this
season.
"IMy senior year has been] a
good season, but with its ups and

downs," said Wetnight. "If we can
beat Cal, then it'll be a very suc
cessful year. We'll be 9-3 and
going to a bowl." But when evalu
ating his own performance this
year, Wetnight isn't quite as
enthusiastic.
"I've had an average season,"
said Wetnight. "I haven't played
as large a role in the offense as I
would have liked, but I'm happy
with the season and the success
our team has had."
Receiving coach Mike Wilson
explained Wetnight's disappoint
ment.
"He had anticipated more balls
this season, but we needed him for
pass protection," said Wilson.
"Also, with the quarterback being
sacked loften] we couldn't get the
ball to him as much as we wanted
to."
But what he has contributed to
the Cardinal offense is an added
receiving threat.
"Not all tight ends are mobile
enough to get away from defend
ers. Having one that can is an
advantage," said Wetnight.
He has made several big catch
es this year. One such play
occurred against Texas A&M over
the middle of the field during the
opening drive. It netted the Cardi
nal 24 hard-earned yards.
This season Wetnight has
started in all 11 games. He has 24
receptions and has averaged a
gain of 11.9 yards per reception
and 25.9 yards per game.
Blocking and lineman coach
Scott Schuhmann said Wetnieht's

contribution has been invaluable.
"He's been blocking over-sided
a little," said Schuhmann. "He's
had to match up against very good
defenders on the line. But we've

been running to the right with
him there."

ever, describes Wetnight as "real
ly quiet and shy."
"He's shy and reserved, but he's
got a lot of friends on the team and
in the student body," said Schuh
mann. "He's the kind of guy who
only talks when he has something
to say. But on the field he plays big.
He's a Jeckyl and Hyde type."
"I really like the contact. I like
the game too, and especially the
camaraderie," said Wetnight.
The athletic Wetnight was a
quarterback and a basketball
player in high school. It was while
at junior college that his size
moved him to the tight end posi
tion, and it was then that Schuh

"We were looking for a knowl
edgeable guy who could run and
receive at that position," said
Schuhmann. Wetnight was a junior
college Ail-American at Fresno City
College, catching 67 passes in one
year — quite a lot for a tight end.
As far as the future goes, Wet
night is looking at the possibility of
business school. And the pros? If
he has an opportunity, Wetnight
said he will try out for a team.
However, he is not really thinking
about it now.
For now, there is Big Game,
school and the camaraderie of the
team. Wetnight will be there Sat
urday in his dual role as
blocker/receiver, as he has all sea
son, doing whatever he can to con
tribute to a Cardinal victory.

Rice.
Wetnight describes his position
as unique because his duties lie
somewhere in between those of a
wide receiver and a lineman. He
has to be able to defend the quar
terback as well as run pass routes
that will get him into the open
field.
"In many respects, the tight
end position requires more
responsibility than some of the
other positions on the field," said
Wetnight.
In fact, under the Bill Walsh
offensive scheme, many duties
have been placed on the shoulders
of No. 86. Each play requires the

tight end to perform in a different
manner, whether running routes
against man-on-man or zone
defenses or staying on the line to
protect the quarterback. Oflen it
is his responsibility to pick up
blitzing outside defenders and
block for the run.
Wetnight attributes his success
to receiving coach Mike Wilson
and blocking and lineman coach
Scott Schuhmann.
"I've learned a lot under Coach
Walsh and [Coach 1 Wilson, espe
cially how to slide away from
defenders and run routes into the
open," said Wetnight.
But today all eyes, especially
Wetnight's, are on Big Game.
"The excitement and the hype
make it great. I'm really looking
forward to it." For the quiet Wet
night, this is an unusually aggres
sive statement.
In fact, this will be only the sec
ond Big Game for the senior tight
end, as his first two years were
spent at Fresno City College. Wet
night said his first game against
Cal remains a highlight in his
Stanford career.
"I caught a touchdown in the
Big Game last year. I'll always
remember that," said Wetnight.
And well he should. The catch was
a spectacular reception in the cor
ner of the end zone. According to
Wetnight, that experience almost
equals the thrill of beating Notre
Dame in Indiana and USC this
season.
"IMy senior year has been] a
good season, but with its ups and

downs," said Wetnight. "If we can
beat Cal, then it'll be a very suc
cessful year. We'll be 9-3 and
going to a bowl." But when evalu
ating his own performance this
year, Wetnight isn't quite as
enthusiastic.
"I've had an average season,"
said Wetnight. "I haven't played
as large a role in the offense as I
would have liked, but I'm happy
with the season and the success
our team has had."
Receiving coach Mike Wilson
explained Wetnight's disappoint
ment.
"He had anticipated more balls
this season, but we needed him for
pass protection," said Wilson.
"Also, with the quarterback being
sacked loften] we couldn't get the
ball to him as much as we wanted
to."
But what he has contributed to
the Cardinal offense is an added
receiving threat.
"Not all tight ends are mobile
enough to get away from defend
ers. Having one that can is an
advantage," said Wetnight.
He has made several big catch
es this year. One such play
occurred against Texas A&M over
the middle of the field during the
opening drive. It netted the Cardi
nal 24 hard-earned yards.
This season Wetnight has
started in all 11 games. He has 24
receptions and has averaged a
gain of 11.9 yards per reception
and 25.9 yards per game.
Blocking and lineman coach
Scott Schuhmann said Wetnieht's

contribution has been invaluable.
"He's been blocking over-sided
a little," said Schuhmann. "He's
had to match up against very good
defenders on the line. But we've

been running to the right with
him there."

opposing defenses that he is a force to be reckoned with.
ever, describes Wetnight as "real
ly quiet and shy."
"He's shy and reserved, but he's
got a lot of friends on the team and
in the student body," said Schuh
mann. "He's the kind of guy who
only talks when he has something
to say. But on the field he plays big.
He's a Jeckyl and Hyde type."
"I really like the contact. I like
the game too, and especially the
camaraderie," said Wetnight.
The athletic Wetnight was a
quarterback and a basketball
player in high school. It was while
at junior college that his size
moved him to the tight end posi
tion, and it was then that Schuh
mann recruited him.
"We were looking for a knowl
edgeable guy who could run and
receive at that position," said
Schuhmann. Wetnight was a junior
college Ail-American at Fresno City
College, catching 67 passes in one
year — quite a lot for a tight end.
As far as the future goes, Wet
night is looking at the possibility of
business school. And the pros? If
he has an opportunity, Wetnight
said he will try out for a team.
However, he is not really thinking
about it now.
For now, there is Big Game,
school and the camaraderie of the
team. Wetnight will be there Sat
urday in his dual role as
blocker/receiver, as he has all sea
son, doing whatever he can to con
tribute to a Cardinal victory.
In the past two games, the
Stanford offense seems to have
developed a special kind of confi
dence, one that will take the Car
dinal to a bowl game. A critical
piece of this offense throughout
the season, and especially since
the revitalization of the offense, is
starting tight end Ryan Wetnight.
Wetnight stands 6-foot-3,
weighing 220 pounds. His position
requires a specialized athleticism:
tough enough to handle the pass
rush, but nimble enough to run
with the receivers.
Head coach Bill Walsh has
always highly utilized the tight
end. With the San Francisco
49ers, he developed ex-Santa
Clara University Bronco Brent
Jones into almost as dangerous a
threat as his two famous wide
receivers, John Taylor and Jerry
Rice.
