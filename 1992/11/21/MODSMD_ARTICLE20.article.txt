# Inside linebacker Williams solidifies defense
## 
### Greg Collins Staff writer 
"He's the best at what he does
and what he does isn't very pret
ty." Although usually applied to
the Marvel Comics superhero
Wolverine, this statement can also
be used to describe No. 36, inside
linebacker Tom Williams.
Williams, a fifth-year senior,
grew up collecting comic books.
With a childhood filled with
adventures from the likes of the
X-Men, X-Factor and the West
Coast Avengers, Williams has
crafted his body and mind into
that of a hero.
At 6 feet and 235 pounds,
Williams creates a striking pic
ture. His thick neck and arms
spring forth from a chest dense
with layers of muscle. Along with
this impressive physique is a mind
capable of reading opposing
offenses as well as the great works
of Plato and Herodotus. A spring
1992 graduate, Williams is now
working on his honors thesis, a
Martin Luther King Jr. project,
and hopes someday to attend law
school.
At the end of his last year at
Stanford, Williams looks back
with mixed emotions.
"It's been a great season, but
there are some things I wish had
done better," Williams said. "The
preparation for the Arizona game
was there, but I don't feel like we
played well enough to win.
"We also didn't play very hard
against Washington and it was
apparent after looking at the film.
They weren't that much better
than we were, but we just didn't
execute."

Another troublesome memory
for Williams is the injury to his
scapula early in the season which
kept him out of three games,
including the victory over Notre
Dame.
"I thought about the injury
while I was out and I felt really
bad," Williams said. "Everything

happens for a reason. God makes
things happen for a reason, and I
think I learned to put things in per
spective after the injury. At that
point, I think football was so much
a part of my life that it was almost
too consuming. Football is a lot of
fun, but it's still just a game."
Williams maintains a rather

intellectual philosophy on foot
ball.
"Football is a state of mind,"
Williams said. "Ninety percent of
football is in the heart. You have
to really want to physically and
mentally take apart the guy play
ing across from you. People might
say it's barbaric and animalistic,

but I think it kind of breaks life
down to its basis."
Going into his last Big Game,
Williams has some personal goals.
"I just got a letter from a
friend," Williams said. "He said
'This is your last game against
Cal. Go out and play the best game
of your life, play the hardest that
you've ever played, because you've
got nothing else to lose.'
"He's absolutely right. My goal
is to go out and play as hard as I
can. If I can do that, I think good
things will happen."
As a freshman on the 1988
Stanford squad, Williams was on
hand to watch Tuan Van block
the "automatic" Cal field goal to
preserve a 19-19 tie."I think that
kind of propelled us, got the team
going in the right direction," said
Williams.
Last year's Big Game also holds
a special place in Williams' heart.
"I felt it was my best collegiate
game, where I had 11 tackles,"
Williams said. "Basketball players
talk about being in the zone where
every shot they take will go in. I
felt like I was in the zone, I felt
like I couldn't be blocked and I
could make every play. That's a
great feeling."
Looking to next year, Williams
is not ruling out playing profes
sional football.
"I think I am in an ideal situa
tion," Williams said. "With Bill
Walsh as coach, coming off a suc
cessful year with a successful
defense with a lot of television
exposure, I'd just like to give it a
shot. I'm never going to have this
opportunity in my life to play
something that is fun and earn a
living at it."

execute."

Another troublesome memory
for Williams is the injury to his
scapula early in the season which
kept him out of three games,
including the victory over Notre
Dame.
"I thought about the injury
while I was out and I felt really
bad," Williams said. "Everything

happens for a reason. God makes
things happen for a reason, and I
think I learned to put things in per
spective after the injury. At that
point, I think football was so much
a part of my life that it was almost
too consuming. Football is a lot of
fun, but it's still just a game."
Williams maintains a rather

intellectual philosophy on foot
ball.
"Football is a state of mind,"
Williams said. "Ninety percent of
football is in the heart. You have
to really want to physically and
mentally take apart the guy play
ing across from you. People might
say it's barbaric and animalistic,

but I think it kind of breaks life
down to its basis."
Going into his last Big Game,
Williams has some personal goals.
"I just got a letter from a
friend," Williams said. "He said
'This is your last game against
Cal. Go out and play the best game
of your life, play the hardest that
you've ever played, because you've
got nothing else to lose.'
"He's absolutely right. My goal
is to go out and play as hard as I
can. If I can do that, I think good
things will happen."
As a freshman on the 1988
Stanford squad, Williams was on
hand to watch Tuan Van block
the "automatic" Cal field goal to
preserve a 19-19 tie."I think that
kind of propelled us, got the team
going in the right direction," said
Williams.
Last year's Big Game also holds
a special place in Williams' heart.
"I felt it was my best collegiate
game, where I had 11 tackles,"
Williams said. "Basketball players
talk about being in the zone where
every shot they take will go in. I
felt like I was in the zone, I felt
like I couldn't be blocked and I
could make every play. That's a
great feeling."
Looking to next year, Williams
is not ruling out playing profes
sional football.
"I think I am in an ideal situa
tion," Williams said. "With Bill
Walsh as coach, coming off a suc
cessful year with a successful
defense with a lot of television
exposure, I'd just like to give it a
shot. I'm never going to have this
opportunity in my life to play
something that is fun and earn a
living at it."

Senior inside linebacker Tom Williams has shown himself by action and example to be a leader, not only
on the ninth-ranked Cardinal defense, but also in the classroom.
