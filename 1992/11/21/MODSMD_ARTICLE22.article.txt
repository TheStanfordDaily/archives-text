# Walsh fulfills expectations
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
As Cardinal linebacker Ron George put
it, the Big Game has a tendency to block all
vision. But Stanford's 1992 season was its
best in two decades — and worth at least
one more look.
A run-down of the top stories of the sea
son:
• The legend returns.
Bill Walsh's arrival on The Farm was the
biggest story in college football this season,
bar none. He would have made news
regardless of how the Cardinal fared. But
Walsh has done nothing less than lead the
Cardinal to the verge of a New Year's Day
bowl appearance and its first nine-win reg
ular season since 1951. All of this was
accomplished despite the fact that Stanford
was playing what was arguably the nation's
toughest schedule.
• Cardinal upsets Notre Dame
again.
After spotting the Irish an early 16-0
lead, the Cardinal played a nearly flawless
second half of football and scored an
impressive 33-16 upset.
The win was Stanford's second straight
shocker in South Bend — no team had won
consecutive games at Notre Dame in six
decades. The Cardinal also knocked off the
Fighting Irish in 1990, when they were
ranked No. 1.
• Stanford jumps into top 10.
The Cardinal moved to No. 8 in the Asso
ciated Press poll, as they followed up their
Notre Dame upset with a road victory over
then-No. 18 UCLA. It was Stanford's first
top 10 appearance since 1971.
Led by a Glyn Milburn punt return for a
touchdown and a smothering defensive per
formance, the Cardinal beat the Bruins 19-
7. Stanford's win gave them a 2-0 Pac-10
record and spawned Rose Bowl hopes on
the Farm.
• Offensive line struggles; Sten
strom pays price.
After losing first team All-American left
tackle Bob Whitfield to the NFL's Atlanta
Falcons, the offensive line had season-long
troubles protecting the passer.
Opposing defenses have sacked Stanford
quarterbacks 49 times, and Stenstrom has
been knocked out of five of the season's 11
games. His scariest moment came in a 21-6
loss to Arizona, when Stenstrom lay

motionless for close to five minutes after
suffering a concussion on a crushing sack.
The line's troubles were partially allevi
ated late in the season when veteran Chris
Dalman moved to left tackle to shore up the
crucial (and formerly unstable) spot on
Stenstrom's blind side. For today's match
up, however, he has been shifted back to
the guard position as a result of Brian Cas
sidy's season-ending injury.
• Defense dominates, spends year
rated among top 10.
A veteran defense with eight senior
starters carried the Cardinal to its second
straight winning season. The team led the
Pac-10 in pass efficiency defense virtually
all season, and was among the nation's top
overall defenses throughout the year.
Ron George led a rejuvenated pass rush
with 14 sacks. John Lynch played a bruis
ing free safety, leading the team in tackles
and snatching four interceptions. The Car
dinal "D" also forced 30 turnovers in its
first 11 games.
• George and Lynch garner All-
America honors.
Outside linebacker George and free safe
ty Lynch were named to the Football News'
All-America team Nov. 18.
George was one of 10 seini-finalists for
the Butkus Award, given to the nation's top
linebacker and was named to FN's first
team. Lynch was a second team selection.
• Cardinal lands Kickoff Classic
invite in wake of Walsh's signing.
The arrival of Walsh brought immediate
results as the Orange County Sports Asso
ciation tabbed Stanford to play in its
nationally-televised season opener.
The Cardinal was pitted against nation
al-title contender Texas A&M. Stanford
dominated the first half, but could build
only a 7-0 lead. The second half saw the
Aggies score 10 points on two broken offen
sive plays, and they went on to win 10-7.
Texas A&M has not lost a game this season,
and is ranked No. 4 in the nation.
• Rookie Abrams takes over kicking
job.
Freshman Eric Abrams, consensus 1991
high school kicker-of- the-year and Parade
Magazine's National Player of the Year,
grabbed the Cardinal's starting placekick
ing job in the year's second game and tallied
16 field goals in 19 attempts over the sea
son.
Abrams is among 20 finalists for the

Lou Groza award, given to the nation's top
kicker.
• Huskies dash Cardinal's Rose
Bowl hopes with Seattle shellacking.
Stanford came into its game with league
leading Washington still in control of its
Rose Bowl destiny, and left a humbled 41-7
loser.

Stanford actually took a 7-0 lead in the
first quarter, but the Huskies quickly
turned the game into a rout. Washington
knocked Stenstrom out of the game in the
second quarter and never let the Stanford
offense get on track. The Huskies' offense,
on the other hand, racked up 467 total
yards, 275 on the ground.

The Stanford defensive line is quite an intimidating specter for many an opposing
quarterback. The Cardinal's success this season has been largely because of the
effectiveness of the defense.
