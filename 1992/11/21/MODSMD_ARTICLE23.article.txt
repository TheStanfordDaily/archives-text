Year Winner Score Notes About Game and Finish
1972 Cal 24-21 Vinoe Ferragamo hit Steve Sweeney with an 8-yard TD pass as time ran
out for Cal's third win of the season. The PAT was never attempted due
to crowd celebration.
1974 Stan 22-20 Mike Langford nailed a 50-yard field goal as time ran out to ruin
Cal's bid for an 8-2-1 season, negating a late Steve Bartkowski to
Steve Rivera TD pass which put Cal up 20-19.
1976 Stan 27-24 Cal led 24-19 and was running out the clock when Markey Crane
fumbled a pitchout that Stanford recovered at the Cal 2 to set up a
TD in Jack Christiansen's final victory.
1980 Cal 28-23 Stanford had a lst-and-goal at the Cal 4 with less than 2 minutes to go,
but the John Elway-led team couldn't convert and Cal had its third win
of the season, ruining a Peach Bowl bid for the Cardinal.
1982 Cal 25-20 After Mark Harmon hit a 35-yard field goal with 4 seconds left to
give Stanford a 20-19 lead, Cal pulled off a miracle 5-lateral kickoff
return for a TD: from Kevin Moen to Richard Rodgers, to Dwight
Garner to Rodgers, to Mariet Ford to Moen through the Stanford
band.
1984 Cal 17-11 Cal posted perhaps the biggest upset in Big Game history to give
Joe Kapp a victory in his final game. John Paye had Stanford in Cal
territory in the final minute, but couldn't score.
1988 Tie 19-19 Robbie Keen had 4 field goals, but his sth attempt from only 20
yards away was blocked by Tuan Van Le as time expired to preserve
the tie. David Ortega's interception at the Stanford 29 with 3:39
left set up the potential winning drive.
1990 Stan 27-25 Stanford scored 9 points in the final 12 seconds to win on a John
Hopkins 39-yard field goal at the gun. Stanford converted a 4th
and-6 and 3rd-and-10 to move 87 yards in the final 1:54 but John
Hardy picked off a 2-pt conversion. Then, an on-side kick at 0:12
and roughing-the-passer penalty set up the winning field goal.
