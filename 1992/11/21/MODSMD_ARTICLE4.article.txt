# Forget records, consider determination
## Year after year, Big Game comes down to whichever team wants to win more 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
On the 100 th anniversary of
the first Big Game, both the Stan
ford Cardinal and the University
of California Golden Bears have a
lot at stake.
For the Cardinal, this game
could mean the difference
between playing on New Year's
Day and playing in a much less
prestigious bowl. If Stanford wins,
it has the inside track on confer
ence rival USC for a spot in the
Fiesta Bowl. A victory would
mean a 9-3 record and a ranking
near the top 10 nationally.
With victorie the last three
years, even fifth-\ oar seniors have
not had the displeasure of seeing
the trophy on the other side of the
Bay. "It's the clash of the titans,
4-0 vs. 0-4," said outside lineback
er Ron George. "Who's going to
come away with The Axe?"
Despite the recent Cardinal
success, Stanford can only boast a
46-37-11 record in this storied
series. The tightness of the rivalry
over the years is a testament to
the fact that team records don't
seem to matter much in the con
text of Big Game. Although the
Cardinal enters the game 8-3
overall, 5-2 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, it's only a two-point
favorite over the 4-6, 2-5 Bears.
Already guaranteed of a losing
record, the bowl scene is even fur
ther from the minds of Cal play
ers. The last two weeks, the Bears
have been crushed by both Ore
gon, 37-17, and Arizona State, 28-
12. For this reason, Cal has the
singular purpose of getting back
The Axe.
How did The Axe become such
a powerful symbol of the rivalry
between the two schools? In 1899,
yell leader Billy Erb purchased a
broadaxe with a fifteen-inch blade
which he used to decapitate the
effigy of a Cal Bear during a bon
fire the night before a crucial
baseball game. After the game the
next day, The Axe was stolen by
Cal supporters and remained in
Berkeley for the next 31 years.
In 1930, The Immortal 21
pulled off the second theft of The

Axe and returned it to Stanford.
Since that year, although it was
agreed that The Axe would go to
the winner of Big Game, The Axe
has been stolen by the two sides a
total of five more times; history
shows you don't necessarily have
to win the game to get The Axe.
Stanford players don't want to
place the burden on their fans.
And if the Cardinal plays like it
has the last two weeks, they
should be able to do the job.
With only 12 points allowed the
last two games, the Cardinal
defense is playing its best football
of the season. With eight tackles
and a sack, George and the rest of
the defense held Washington
State quarterback Drew Bledsoe
to his lowest totals of the season
and a mere field goal. Entering
today's game, Stanford ranks

ninth in the nation in total
defense and fourth in pass
defense.
In addition, the offense seemed
to put everything together for the
first time since the Notre Dame
game en route to a 40-3 victory
over WSU last Saturday. Quarter
back Steve Stenstrom threw for
198 yards and two touchdowns,
and Glyn Milburn picked up thrve
scores in one of his best games of
the year. Senior Ellery Roberts
chipped in with 100 yards rushing
on just 16 carries.
Hopefully, the game won't
come down to the wire as it did the
last time the Cardinal visited
Memorial Stadium. In one of the
most incredible finishes in colle
giate football history, former kick
er John Hopkins nailed his fifth
field goal in the final seconds to

win, 27-25.
If the Cardinal needs another
five-field-goal effort, freshman
Eric Abrams is the right man for
the job. Abrams is 16 for 19 on the
season and has connected on all 26
of his extra point attempts to pro
vide the most stable kicking game
Stanford has had in several years.
On the other side of the
pigskin, Cal features a couple of
offensive stars who can single
handedly dominate a football
game. Senior tailback Russell
White needs just 14 yards to reach
1,000 for the season.
Wide receiver Sean Dawkins
has risen to the top of his field.
Already this year, he has caught
56 passes for 926 yards to lead the
Golden Bears. In his career,
Dawkins has scored 29 touch
downs despite starting in just 25

collegiate games.
The Bear defense gives away
very little, despite a lack of recog
nition. Coming into today's con
test, Cal ranks 14th nationally in
total defense, allowing just 292
yards per game.
With both sides boasting strong
defenses, the game will most likely
come down to the intangibles —
like perseverance and determina
tion. "They don't like us and we
hate them," said inside linebacker
Tom Williams. "It's that simple."
As has occurred in other years,
the game could hinge on the quan
tity and quality of fan support.
One question which must be
answered is "Did Stanford Food
Service provide the same small,
dense oranges for sack lunches as
they did two years ago?"
Please clear the field.

Junior quarterback Steve Stenstrom narrowly avoids a sack. Stenstrom and the rest of the Cardinal offense have been moving the ball very
well lately.
