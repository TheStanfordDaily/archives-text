# Loss for Card may kill New Year's hopes
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
For the first time since 1977-78 — when
Bill Walsh was in his initial term as coach of
the Cardinal — the Stanford football team
is assured of back-to-back winning seasons,
and with that success comes a worthy
reward: back-to-back bowl game appear
ances.
Regardless of the result of the Big Game,
Stanford is a lock to go to a Bowl Game;
however, exactly what type of bowl game
depends almost entirely on the outcome of
today's contest.
With a win over California, Stanford
would have a record of 9-3 overall and 6-2 in
the Pacific 10 Conference, with the team's
lone defeats coming at the hands of three
nationally-ranked teams: Texas A&M,
Washington and Arizona. A win would

almost certainly put Stanford into a New
Year's Day bowl.
The most ideal situation for Stanford
involves the Fiesta Bowl, which is played in
Tempe, Ariz. The Fiesta Bowl is part of the
bowl alliance, and bowl officials have con
firmed that if they take a team from the
Pac-10, it will be the No. 14 Cardinal,
assuming a victory today. Stanford would
likely square off in a match-up against No.
8 Syracuse, the Big East runner-up. The
Fiesta pays out an estimated $3 million per
team, and is a prestigious nationally-tele
vised game.
But there are two possible hangups to a
Stanford Fiesta Bowl appearance. The first
is that the Fiesta Bowl is contemplating
inviting No. 11 Colorado instead of Stan
ford. The second is that, should Alabama
lose either this week to Auburn or on Dec. 5
in the Southeastern Conference champi

onship game, the Fiesta Bowl could play
host to a national championship game
between Miami and Florida State.
Should either of those scenarios unfold,
Stanford would not be without Jan. 1 bowl
options. The Blockbuster Bowl, played at
Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami, Fla., would
be very eager to set up a "coaching legends"
match-up between Walsh and Joe Paterno
of Penn State. The Blockbuster Bowl and
No. 23 Penn State reached an agreement
before the season ensuring the Nittany
Lions' participation. The Blockbuster pays
out $1,525 million per team and is also on
national television.
If Stanford loses today, the Cardinal
might be slated for a less prestigious bowl.
The Blockbuster would still likely give
strong consideration to an 8-4 Stanford
team. But should the Blockbuster pass on
the Cardinal, Stanford would end its season

during the 1992 calendar year. The most
attractive of the remaining options would
be a date at the John Hancock Bowl in El
Paso, Texas on New Year's Eve. The payout
there is $1 million per team and the game is
nationally televised.
A less-pleasing alternative would be a
return to Anaheim on Dec. 29 for the Free
dom Bowl. The Freedom Bowl's payout is
considerably less, and it is not nationally
televised.
Essentially, a win over Cal places Stan
ford in the driver's seat in terms of post
season play; a loss places the Cardinal's
bowl hopes at the mercy of bowl selection
officials.
"We definitely think we'll go to a bowl;
it's a question of which one," Stanford
Associate Athletic Director Tom Beckett
said. "We just feel that our prospects are
excellent."
