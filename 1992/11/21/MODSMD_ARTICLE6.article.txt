# Early losses set tone for Cal's miserable season
## 
### Amy Howard Editorial staff 
Everyone knows a frustrated
bear can be a dangerous animal.
There are different ways to
look at the California football
team entering Memorial Stadium
for the 95th Big Game. They can
be seen as a struggling 4-6, 2-5
squad coming off two consecutive
losses to Oregon and Arizona
State. With health and morale
problems, the Golden Bears don't
seem too ferocious.
On the other hand, frustration
can be a big motivator. There is no
doubt that Cal has some
formidable talent, most specifical
ly in the form of junior wide
receiver Sean Dawkins and senior
tailback Russell White. Today's
game is a final opportunity for the
team to pull together and prove
that it is worthy of more respect
than its record implies.
To explain the Bears' prob
lems, you must begin with the
players on the sidelines. The
defense has been decimated by
injuries this season. Troubles
began with the loss of senior
defensive back Chris Cannon, and
they have been compounded by
injuries to junior back Jody Gra
ham and defensive end Brad Bow
ers. Junior outside linebacker Jim
Joiner is still suffering from a
knee injury, and star inside
linebacker Jerrott Willard is
recovering from a concussion
inflicted last week.
According to coach Keith
Gilbertson, "We've changed our
team because of injuries so much,
it's really hurt us. . . .We were a
good team early, but then health
became an issue."
Along with the health problem

came a morale problem. Following
a 42-0 pounding of Oregon State,
the Bears went on a five-game los
ing skid broken only by a 48-12 win
over UCLA. As their position in the
Pacific 10 Conference standings
slipped, so did their ability to focus
for a full game. More often than
not, their concentration would
unravel during the fourth quarter.
"I think it's important that if
the ball bounces funny, you still
go out and keep playing," Gilbert
son said. "Our biggest weakness
has been our inability emotionally
to handle some of the funny
bounces. We haven't been a very
good fourth quarter team."
Gilbertson acknowledges that
the team is also undergoing many
transitions under his new coach
ing staff. Gilbertson is in his first
season at Cal, and has felt the
pressures that come with being an
"outsider, knowing very few play
ers at all," he said.
Although Stanford coach Bill
Walsh is also finishing his first
season on The Farm after a 14-
year hiatus, he had the advantage
of returning to a familiar program
which was run by his disciple,
Denny Green. This is not the case
with Cal.
"Our defensive guys have
played four different defenses in
four different years," Gilbertson
noted. "I think long-range stabili
ty may be a factor [in our perfor
mance this year]."
Setting injuries, frustration
and the transition factor aside,
the Golden Bears do have some
raw talent capable of exploding
today. And if their frustration
sparks such an explosion, the Car
dinal could be in trouble.
White has managed to accumu
late 986 rushing yards in 187

attempts this season, and should
break the 1,000-yard barrier for
the third straight year today. The
first team All-American's 3,284
career rushing yards and 4,859
career all-purpose yards are both
California school records. His
109.6 rushing yards per game this
season is currently the 13th high
est in the nation.
Another major offensive
weapon for the Bears is Dawkins
at wide receiver. The recently
named second team All-American
has snagged 56 catches for 926
yards and 12 touchdowns this sea
son. He is first in the Pac-10 in
both receiving (5.6 catches per
game) and receiving yards per

game (92.6). Coming into today's
game, he is just 74 yards shy of the
1,000-yard mark for the year; if he
reaches it, he will be only the fifth
player in Pac-10 history to do so.
Nobody has more respect for
Dawkins' ability than Walsh.
"Dawkins is conceivably the best
player in the Pac-10," Walsh said.
"He'd certainly get my vote right
now."
On the defensive side, inside
linebacker Willard leads the Bears
with 124 tackles, 74 of which were
unassisted. The 6-foot-2 225 pound
sophomore is followed by senior
defensive end Scott Roseman, who
has racked up 59 tackles and six
quarterback sacks this year.

If the past is any indication,
however, the outcome of today's
Big Game will depend on the fac
tors that affect the teams' psy
ches. If Cal cannot rise above the
frustration that has mired the
team down in past weeks, The Axe
probably won't be making a cross-
Bay journey this year. But if the
Bears can sustain an attack for all
four quarters, they could partially
salvage a disappointing season
and plant seeds of hope for next
year.
"It's going to be heated as hell
on the Astro Turf," Gilbertson
said. "We have one more chance to
go out and show that we're a good
football team."
