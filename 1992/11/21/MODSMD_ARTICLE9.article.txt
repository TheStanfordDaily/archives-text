# Big Game history filled with wacky endings
## 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
There's something about Big Games in
Berkeley that brings out the bizarre. Maybe
it's a residual contact high or dizziness
caused by staring at too many tie-dyed
shirts. Or maybe there's something funny
in the water.
But, for whatever reason, the football
games are definitely affected. In the illustri
ous 100-year history of Big Game, victories
have been secured on the game's final play
four times — and all of the epics have hap
pened at Cal's Memorial Stadium.
1972: Cal 24, Stanford 21
In 1972, the Golden Bears proved how
dirty they could be when they beat Stanford
24-21 in a mud bath.
The game started badly for Cal as Stan
ford linebacker Gordy Riegel picked off a pass
from the Bears' quarterback Vince Ferrag
amo and ran it back 71 yards for a touchdown
to put the Cardinal up 14-3 at half time.
But Ferragamo, whose greatest achieve
ment in pro football would be losing to the
aged Steel Curtain in the 1980 Pittsburgh
Steelers-L.A. Rams Super Bowl, would
have the last laugh. Although the freshman
quarterback had been intercepted four
times, Cal coach Mike White decided
against replacing him with Steve Bartkows
ki, a future Atlanta Falcons signal caller.
With the score 21-18 in favor of Stan
ford, Ferragamo led the Bears on a last
minute drive. Cal rumbled all the way to
the Cardinal 6-yard line before stumbling
on three straight plays. On fourth down,
White eschewed the field goal and went for
a touchdown and the win.
The rookie coach put in wide receiver
Steve Sweeney at tight end and Ferragamo
looked for him in the corner of the end zone.
Stanford defensive back Jim Ferguson fell
when he banged into Sweeney coming off
the line, so the receiver was wide open.
Sweeney still had to churn through the
muck and dive for the sailing pigskin. But
he came up with the ball, a mud mask wor

thy of Liz Taylor and the first Big Game vic
tory snared on the last play of the game.
1974: Stanford 22, Cal 20
Two years later, Bartkowski battled Car
dinal backup Guy Benjamin for The Axe. A
fumble recovery for a touchdown and a 61-
yard bomb to future Dallas Cowboy speed
ster Tony Hill gave Stanford a 19-10 lead.
But with 33 seconds left in the game,
Bartkowski hit Steve Rivera for a TD and the
extra point gave Cal a 20-19 lead. After the
kickoff, the Cardinal had 19 seconds to move
from its own 19 to within scoring range.
Benjamin connected on two passes to set
up a 50-yard field goal try. Cardinal place
kicker Mike Langford split the uprights as
time expired to give Stanford the win.
1982: Cal 25, Stanford 20
Unquestionably the most famous of last
second heroics belong to the Bears, who
pulled off "The Play" a.k.a. "We-had-
Elway-and-we-still-lost-Big-Game" in
1982.
Elway, known for his last-second, game
winning drives, put the Cardinal in position
to win with a late drive that set up a Stan
ford field goal try. Cardinal fans spilled
from the stands and mobbed the team when
Stanford took a 20-19 lead with four sec
onds left.
After a 15-yard penalty was levied for
the celebration, the Cardinal kicked off at
the 25-yard line. Upon receiving the ball,
the Bears pulled out a trick play worthy of a
neighborhood sand lot game.
With a little luck and a lot of improvisa
tion, Cal made five laterals and raced down
field towards the Stanford Band, which had
gathered in the endzone in preparation for
the victorious post-game show.
Bear Kevin Moen, who started the play,
took the last lateral. He avoided any would
be tacklers in the tuba section as he crossed
the goal line and crashed into Gary Tyrell,
who will be forever known as the "trom
bone dude who bit it."
"The Play" became one of the best

1990: Stanford 27, Cal 25
But Stanford got revenge for
"The Play" eight years later. After
Cal's Russell White and Stan
ford's Glyn Milburn shared domi
nation for most of the seesaw con
test, it came down to the last 12
seconds. Down 25-18 in the wan
ing moments of the game, Stan
ford quarterback Jason Palumbis
hit Ed McCaffrey on a touchdown
pass. In Big Game tradition, Car
dinal coach Denny Green chose to
go for a win with a two-point con
version.
But Palumbis' pass was inter
cepted and Bear fans poured onto

the field, proving that Stanford
fans aren't the only ones stupid
enough to celebrate a win prema
turely. And like 1982, the ensuing
15-yard penalty proved costly.
Cardinal kicker John Hopkins
squibbed an onside kick from the
50-yard line and Stanford's Kevin
Scott recovered it at Cal's 37.
With nine seconds left,
Palumbis tried to find McCaffrey
again but the pass fell incomplete.
However, the Bears were flagged
for roughing the quarterback and
the penalty gave the Cardinal 15
more yards.
With Cal fans sitting in
stunned silence and Stanford fans
going berserk, Hopkins calmly
drilled a 39-yard field goal to keep
The Axe at Stanford for another
year.
Will the Cardinal keep the Axe
in 1992? Stanford hasn't relin
quished the glorified hatchet in
five years but, as these Big Games
have proven, anything can hap
pen. Especially in Berkeley.

games are definitely affected. In the illustri
ous 100-year history of Big Game, victories
have been secured on the game's final play
four times — and all of the epics have hap
pened at Cal's Memorial Stadium.
1972: Cal 24, Stanford 21
In 1972, the Golden Bears proved how
dirty they could be when they beat Stanford
24-21 in a mud bath.
The game started badly for Cal as Stan
ford linebacker Gordy Riegel picked off a pass
from the Bears' quarterback Vince Ferrag
amo and ran it back 71 yards for a touchdown
to put the Cardinal up 14-3 at half time.
But Ferragamo, whose greatest achieve
ment in pro football would be losing to the
aged Steel Curtain in the 1980 Pittsburgh
Steelers-L.A. Rams Super Bowl, would
have the last laugh. Although the freshman
quarterback had been intercepted four
times, Cal coach Mike White decided
against replacing him with Steve Bartkows
ki, a future Atlanta Falcons signal caller.
With the score 21-18 in favor of Stan
ford, Ferragamo led the Bears on a last
minute drive. Cal rumbled all the way to
the Cardinal 6-yard line before stumbling
on three straight plays. On fourth down,
White eschewed the field goal and went for
a touchdown and the win.
The rookie coach put in wide receiver
Steve Sweeney at tight end and Ferragamo
looked for him in the corner of the end zone.
Stanford defensive back Jim Ferguson fell
when he banged into Sweeney coming off
the line, so the receiver was wide open.
Sweeney still had to churn through the
muck and dive for the sailing pigskin. But
he came up with the ball, a mud mask wor

thy of Liz Taylor and the first Big Game vic
tory snared on the last play of the game.
1974: Stanford 22, Cal 20
Two years later, Bartkowski battled Car
dinal backup Guy Benjamin for The Axe. A
fumble recovery for a touchdown and a 61-
yard bomb to future Dallas Cowboy speed
ster Tony Hill gave Stanford a 19-10 lead.
But with 33 seconds left in the game,
Bartkowski hit Steve Rivera for a TD and the
extra point gave Cal a 20-19 lead. After the
kickoff, the Cardinal had 19 seconds to move
from its own 19 to within scoring range.
Benjamin connected on two passes to set
up a 50-yard field goal try. Cardinal place
kicker Mike Langford split the uprights as
time expired to give Stanford the win.
1982: Cal 25, Stanford 20
Unquestionably the most famous of last
second heroics belong to the Bears, who
pulled off "The Play" a.k.a. "We-had-
Elway-and-we-still-lost-Big-Game" in
1982.
Elway, known for his last-second, game
winning drives, put the Cardinal in position
to win with a late drive that set up a Stan
ford field goal try. Cardinal fans spilled
from the stands and mobbed the team when
Stanford took a 20-19 lead with four sec
onds left.
After a 15-yard penalty was levied for
the celebration, the Cardinal kicked off at
the 25-yard line. Upon receiving the ball,
the Bears pulled out a trick play worthy of a
neighborhood sand lot game.
With a little luck and a lot of improvisa
tion, Cal made five laterals and raced down
field towards the Stanford Band, which had
gathered in the endzone in preparation for
the victorious post-game show.
Bear Kevin Moen, who started the play,
took the last lateral. He avoided any would
be tacklers in the tuba section as he crossed
the goal line and crashed into Gary Tyrell,
who will be forever known as the "trom
bone dude who bit it."

1990: Stanford 27, Cal 25
But Stanford got revenge for
"The Play" eight years later. After
Cal's Russell White and Stan
ford's Glyn Milburn shared domi
nation for most of the seesaw con
test, it came down to the last 12
seconds. Down 25-18 in the wan
ing moments of the game, Stan
ford quarterback Jason Palumbis
hit Ed McCaffrey on a touchdown
pass. In Big Game tradition, Car
dinal coach Denny Green chose to
go for a win with a two-point con
version.
But Palumbis' pass was inter
cepted and Bear fans poured onto

the field, proving that Stanford
fans aren't the only ones stupid
enough to celebrate a win prema
turely. And like 1982, the ensuing
15-yard penalty proved costly.
Cardinal kicker John Hopkins
squibbed an onside kick from the
50-yard line and Stanford's Kevin
Scott recovered it at Cal's 37.
With nine seconds left,
Palumbis tried to find McCaffrey
again but the pass fell incomplete.
However, the Bears were flagged
for roughing the quarterback and
the penalty gave the Cardinal 15
more yards.
With Cal fans sitting in
stunned silence and Stanford fans
going berserk, Hopkins calmly
drilled a 39-yard field goal to keep
The Axe at Stanford for another
year.
Will the Cardinal keep the Axe
in 1992? Stanford hasn't relin
quished the glorified hatchet in
five years but, as these Big Games
have proven, anything can hap
pen. Especially in Berkeley.
There's something about Big Games in
Berkeley that brings out the bizarre. Maybe
it's a residual contact high or dizziness
caused by staring at too many tie-dyed
shirts. Or maybe there's something funny
in the water.
