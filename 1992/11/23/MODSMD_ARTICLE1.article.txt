# Gave'em The Axe: Cardinal roughs up Bears, 41-21
## Stanford dominates Big Game, shares Pac-10 title 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal put an exclamation point on its best
regular season in two decades Saturday, routing Cal
ifornia 41-21 in the 100 th anniversary of the Big
Game.
Led by a 117-yard, two-touchdown performance
from Ellery Roberts and Steve Stenstrom's 200 yards
and three touchdowns through the air, a balanced
Stanford offense saved its best game for last. The 41-
point showing was its most prolific of the season.
It was more than enough as the Cardinal defense
was its typical suffocating self, holding the Golden
Bears to nine points until a wild final three minutes
narrowed the score.
Not only did Stanford ensure that The Axe will re
main on the Farm for a sixth consecutive year, it also
captured the Pacific 10 Conference co-championship
and all but secured a New Year's Day bowl bid.
With Saturday's commanding victory, Stanford
finished 9-3 overall and 6-2 in Pac-10 play. Washing
ton State's upset ofWashington dumped the Huskies
to 6-2 in conference and left Washington and Stan
ford as co-champions.
Coach Bill Walsh didn't try to mask his elation
with winning the title. "A co-championship means
you can make your own trophy and put anything you
want on it," Walsh said.
The Huskies, by virtue of their head-to-head win
over the Cardinal, will represent the Pac-10 in the
Rose Bowl. But Stanford will also be playing Jan. 1.
The Bowl Coalition won't announce final pairings
until Dec. 6, but all sources indicate that the Cardinal
will receive a bid to either the Fiesta (which is ru
mored to be leaning toward a Colorado-Syracuse
match-up) or Blockbuster Bowl.
Stanford remained No. 14 in the latest Associated

Press poll and clinched its first nine-win season since
1971. The Cardinal isn't waiting for bowl results to
congratulate itself on a remarkable season.
"We've beaten Berkeley, Southern Cal, UCLA and
Notre Dame in one year, and that is just fantastic,"
Walsh said.
"After taking those two big losses early in the year,
we've come back and played terrific football in the
last three games. My guess is that this Stanford team
is stronger than it was a year ago."

can make your own trophy and

The 95th installment of the cross-bay clash didn't
give a capacity crowd of more than 75,000 the drama
ofßigGames past. Instead, it left them with no doubt
as to who is the Bay Area's dominant squad.
Yet much like in last week's win over Washington
State, the Cardinal didn't establish control of the
game immediately.
The Golden Bears staked an early 3-0 advantage
with an impressive 13-play drive off the opening kick,
and Cal's blitzing defense held Stanford to just 20
yards on its first four possessions.
"It wasn't easy in the first quarter," Walsh said.
"We started out really frustrated in this game. We
were being outplayed in the early stages."
But the Bears made sure they wouldn't stay in the
game long. Two turnovers — a Russell White fumble

and a muffed punt — killed any momentum
Cal might have developed.
Stenstrom capitalized on the second
turnover, calling an audible on the very next
play and hitting a wide-open Justin Armour
for a 46-yard touchdown.
"That's the fourth game in a row I've
thought we had things going," said a morose
Cal head coach Keith Gilbertson.
"It's the same old deal. We fumble a kick,
and pretty soon it's the second quarter and
instead of 3-3 or 7-7 the score is 21-3 or 21-
7."
That Stenstrom-to-Armour hook-up was
the first in a series of 34 unanswered points,
as the defense shut down Cal and its All-
Am ericart wide Scan Dawkins until
wejl after the hud .decided.
Cornerback Darrien Gordon drew the task
rtf'fcovering Dawkins man-to-man, and did a
great job keeping him in check until the

fourth quarter. Not many teams have tried
to single-cover Dawkins, but the Cardinal's
defensive plan all year has been to combine
man-to-man coverage on the corners with a
heavy rush.
And, said defensive coordinator Fred von-
Appen, "We weren't going to deviate from
the mean just because of one player."
Stenstrom, Roberts and Armour (92
yards, two touchdowns) keyed Stanford's
ball control offense that helped keep Cal's
defense on the field for 22 of the second
half s 30 minutes. Tailback Glyn Milburn, on
the other hand, was silenced by the Bears
when he lined up from scrimmage.
Still, Milburn produced the play that
broke Cal's back. His 76-yard punt return
for a touchdown gave the Cardinal a 34-3
third-quarter lead. It also gave him school
records for punt return touchdowns (3) and
punt return yardage (573) in a single sea
son.
The 1992 Big Game fulfilled its obligation

to wackiness with a final three minutes that
included two successful Cal onside kicks and
a fumbled punt by Stanford's Ozzie Grenar
do. The Bears scored on two meaningless
Dave Barr touchdown passes after the Cardi
nal's first-stringers were long on their way to
their ceremonial Axe-kissing.
The game ultimately ended ugly, when a
bench-clearing slugfest erupted after Gor
don's helmet was ripped off as he was tackled
returning a final-play interception. Gilbert
son called the incident the "lowest of the
lows" in his coaching career.
"It's just sad that a game of this magni
tude, with such great teams and great talent,
gave way in the end to rather base actions,"
said linebacker Ron George.
But the violence wasn't enough to mar the
Cardinal's sixth consecutive post-Big Game
celebration. "We graduated never having lost
to Cal," George said. "I guarantee that a lot
of people will hear about that the rest of my
life."
The Cardinal put an exclamation point on its best

their ceremonial Axe-kissing.
The game ultimately ended ugly, when a
bench-clearing slugfest erupted after Gor
don's helmet was ripped off as he was tackled
returning a final-play interception. Gilbert
son called the incident the "lowest of the
lows" in his coaching career.
"It's just sad that a game of this magni
tude, with such great teams and great talent,
gave way in the end to rather base actions,"
said linebacker Ron George.
But the violence wasn't enough to mar the
Cardinal's sixth consecutive post-Big Game
celebration. "We graduated never having lost
to Cal," George said. "I guarantee that a lot
of people will hear about that the rest of my
life."
The Cardinal put an exclamation point on its best
regular season in two decades Saturday, routing Cal
ifornia 41-21 in the 100 th anniversary of the Big
Game.
Led by a 117-yard, two-touchdown performance
from Ellery Roberts and Steve Stenstrom's 200 yards
and three touchdowns through the air, a balanced
Stanford offense saved its best game for last. The 41-
point showing was its most prolific of the season.
It was more than enough as the Cardinal defense
was its typical suffocating self, holding the Golden
Bears to nine points until a wild final three minutes
narrowed the score.
Not only did Stanford ensure that The Axe will re
main on the Farm for a sixth consecutive year, it also
captured the Pacific 10 Conference co-championship
and all but secured a New Year's Day bowl bid.
With Saturday's commanding victory, Stanford
finished 9-3 overall and 6-2 in Pac-10 play. Washing
ton State's upset ofWashington dumped the Huskies
to 6-2 in conference and left Washington and Stan
ford as co-champions.
Coach Bill Walsh didn't try to mask his elation
with winning the title. "A co-championship means
you can make your own trophy and put anything you
want on it," Walsh said.
The Huskies, by virtue of their head-to-head win
over the Cardinal, will represent the Pac-10 in the
Rose Bowl. But Stanford will also be playing Jan. 1.
The Bowl Coalition won't announce final pairings
until Dec. 6, but all sources indicate that the Cardinal
will receive a bid to either the Fiesta (which is ru
mored to be leaning toward a Colorado-Syracuse
match-up) or Blockbuster Bowl.
Stanford remained No. 14 in the latest Associated

Press poll and clinched its first nine-win season since
1971. The Cardinal isn't waiting for bowl results to
congratulate itself on a remarkable season.
"We've beaten Berkeley, Southern Cal, UCLA and
Notre Dame in one year, and that is just fantastic,"
Walsh said.
"After taking those two big losses early in the year,
we've come back and played terrific football in the
last three games. My guess is that this Stanford team
is stronger than it was a year ago."

The 95th installment of the cross-bay clash didn't
give a capacity crowd of more than 75,000 the drama
ofßigGames past. Instead, it left them with no doubt
as to who is the Bay Area's dominant squad.
Yet much like in last week's win over Washington
State, the Cardinal didn't establish control of the
game immediately.
The Golden Bears staked an early 3-0 advantage
with an impressive 13-play drive off the opening kick,
and Cal's blitzing defense held Stanford to just 20
yards on its first four possessions.
"It wasn't easy in the first quarter," Walsh said.
"We started out really frustrated in this game. We
were being outplayed in the early stages."
But the Bears made sure they wouldn't stay in the
game long. Two turnovers — a Russell White fumble

and a muffed punt — killed any momentum
Cal might have developed.
Stenstrom capitalized on the second
turnover, calling an audible on the very next
play and hitting a wide-open Justin Armour
for a 46-yard touchdown.
"That's the fourth game in a row I've
thought we had things going," said a morose
Cal head coach Keith Gilbertson.
"It's the same old deal. We fumble a kick,
and pretty soon it's the second quarter and
instead of 3-3 or 7-7 the score is 21-3 or 21-
7."
That Stenstrom-to-Armour hook-up was
the first in a series of 34 unanswered points,
as the defense shut down Cal and its All-
Am ericart wide Scan Dawkins until
wejl after the hud .decided.
Cornerback Darrien Gordon drew the task
rtf'fcovering Dawkins man-to-man, and did a
great job keeping him in check until the

fourth quarter. Not many teams have tried
to single-cover Dawkins, but the Cardinal's
defensive plan all year has been to combine
man-to-man coverage on the corners with a
heavy rush.
And, said defensive coordinator Fred von-
Appen, "We weren't going to deviate from
the mean just because of one player."
Stenstrom, Roberts and Armour (92
yards, two touchdowns) keyed Stanford's
ball control offense that helped keep Cal's
defense on the field for 22 of the second
half s 30 minutes. Tailback Glyn Milburn, on
the other hand, was silenced by the Bears
when he lined up from scrimmage.
Still, Milburn produced the play that
broke Cal's back. His 76-yard punt return
for a touchdown gave the Cardinal a 34-3
third-quarter lead. It also gave him school
records for punt return touchdowns (3) and
punt return yardage (573) in a single sea
son.
The 1992 Big Game fulfilled its obligation

to wackiness with a final three minutes that
included two successful Cal onside kicks and
a fumbled punt by Stanford's Ozzie Grenar

Dave Barr touchdown passes after the Cardi
nal's first-stringers were long on their way to
their ceremonial Axe-kissing.
