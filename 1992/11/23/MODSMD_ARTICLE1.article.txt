# Gave'em The Axe: Cardinal roughs up Bears, 41-21
## Stanford dominates Big Game, shares Pac-10 title 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal put an exclamation point on its best
regular season in two decades Saturday, routing Cal
ifornia 41-21 in the 100 th anniversary of the Big
Game.
Led by a 117-yard, two-touchdown performance
from Ellery Roberts and Steve Stenstrom's 200 yards
and three touchdowns through the air, a balanced
Stanford offense saved its best game for last. The 41-
point showing was its most prolific of the season.
It was more than enough as the Cardinal defense
was its typical suffocating self, holding the Golden
Bears to nine points until a wild final three minutes
narrowed the score.
Not only did Stanford ensure that The Axe will re
main on the Farm for a sixth consecutive year, it also
captured the Pacific 10 Conference co-championship
and all but secured a New Year's Day bowl bid.
With Saturday's commanding victory, Stanford
finished 9-3 overall and 6-2 in Pac-10 play. Washing
ton State's upset ofWashington dumped the Huskies
to 6-2 in conference and left Washington and Stan
ford as co-champions.
Coach Bill Walsh didn't try to mask his elation
with winning the title. "A co-championship means
you can make your own trophy and put anything you
want on it," Walsh said.
The Huskies, by virtue of their head-to-head win
over the Cardinal, will represent the Pac-10 in the
Rose Bowl. But Stanford will also be playing Jan. 1.
The Bowl Coalition won't announce final pairings
until Dec. 6, but all sources indicate that the Cardinal
will receive a bid to either the Fiesta (which is ru
mored to be leaning toward a Colorado-Syracuse
match-up) or Blockbuster Bowl.
Stanford remained No. 14 in the latest Associated

Press poll and clinched its first nine-win season since
1971. The Cardinal isn't waiting for bowl results to
congratulate itself on a remarkable season.
"We've beaten Berkeley, Southern Cal, UCLA and
Notre Dame in one year, and that is just fantastic,"
Walsh said.
"After taking those two big losses early in the year,
we've come back and played terrific football in the
last three games. My guess is that this Stanford team
is stronger than it was a year ago."

'A co-championship means you
can make your own trophy and
put anything you want on it.'

The 95th installment of the cross-bay clash didn't
give a capacity crowd of more than 75,000 the drama
ofßigGames past. Instead, it left them with no doubt
as to who is the Bay Area's dominant squad.
Yet much like in last week's win over Washington
State, the Cardinal didn't establish control of the
game immediately.
The Golden Bears staked an early 3-0 advantage
with an impressive 13-play drive off the opening kick,
and Cal's blitzing defense held Stanford to just 20
yards on its first four possessions.
"It wasn't easy in the first quarter," Walsh said.
"We started out really frustrated in this game. We
were being outplayed in the early stages."
But the Bears made sure they wouldn't stay in the
game long. Two turnovers — a Russell White fumble
