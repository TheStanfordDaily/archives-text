Cease-fire collapses after attack
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — The
10-day old cease-fire between warring Serbian and
Bosnian forces virtually collapsed yesterday as
Sartyevo was heavily bombarded with artillery.
In addition to the Sarajevo shelling, Bosnian
authorities accused Serb forces of deploying Scud
missiles in positions that threaten two northern
towns. A Serb military spokesman denied the alle
gation.
U.N. peacekeeping troops from Britain moved
yesterday to protect U.N. relief warehouses in
Travnik, a town 45 miles northwest of Sarsyevo
that is clogged with refugees fleeing approaching
Serb forces.
Some European money devalued
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) — The European
Community yesterday devalued the Spanish and
Portuguese currencies in an effort to calm persis
tent market turmoil that has raised doubts about
EC plans to adopt a single currency.
The changes are the third realignment of Euro
pean currencies in two months. They were
announced after an 11-hour meeting of the EC's
Monetary Committee, a panel of top central bank

and treasury officials.
The 6 percent devaluations of the Spanish pese
ta and Portuguese escudo take effect today, when
EC economic and finance ministers are expected to
discuss the market further.
Devaluation makes a country's exports cheaper
and tends to boost its economy, but imports become
more expensive and can fuel inflation. The values of
the two currencies against the dollar will not
change.
U.N. unlikely to ease sanctions
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -The Security Coun
cil is unlikely to ease economic sanctions imposed
on Iraq afler the Persian Gulf War despite fresh
requests by top Iraqi officials, U.N. representatives
said yesterday.
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and
Foreign Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahaf were
scheduled to appear before the council today to
request an easing of the embargo, which Baghdad
blames for many civilian deaths.
But U.N. officials said Baghdad remains evasive
in providing information about its nuclear weapons
program. Cease-fire terms require Iraq to cooperate
in dismantling the program before sanctions can be
lifted.
