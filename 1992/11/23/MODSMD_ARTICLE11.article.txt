# Storm hits South, killing 19
## States in storm's path placed under tornado watch 
### 
(AP) — A wall of thunder
storms pushing across the South
spun tornadoes from Texas to
Ohio, killing at least 19 people,
smashing houses and blowing
trucks off highways.
Several states in the path of
the storm were under tornado
watches last night.
Tornadoes killed 15 people and
injured about 150 in Mississippi
late Saturday and one person was
killed early yesterday in Ten
nessee.
At least two people were killed
and scores of others were injured
in Georgia, and in northern Ken
tucky, one person was killed and
nine injured yesterday afternoon.
A tornado touched down in the
western Ohio village of Arcanum
last night. There was no immedi
ate word of serious injury.
Thunderstorms and tornadoes
wrecked homes and businesses in
Alabama, Indiana and Georgia,
where a steeple was ripped from a
church during yesterday's ser

vice. Thousands in Indianapolis
were without power.
Texas and Louisiana were hit
by tornadoes Saturday, which
caused heavy damages and
numerous injuries, but no deaths.
Among the hardest hit areas
was Brandon, Miss., where 10
people died.
"It's unbelievable. We're lucky
we didn't lose more lives than we
did," said W.L. Whittington,
mayor of Brandon.
A tornado smashed through a
mobile home park and then
skipped across Brandon to an
upscale neighborhood, where it
killed a father and son, along with
two of the boy's Cub Scout friends
who were spending the night
there. t
At the mobile home park,
where six people died, rescue
workers used doors from smashed
houses as makeshift stretchers,
said Charlie Wilkinson, civil
defense director for Rankin Coun
ty.

Gov. Kirk Fordice toured the
Rankin County area, which lies
about 15 miles east of Jackson.
The storm hit about midnight,
leveling houses, uprooting trees
and downing hundreds of power
and telephone poles.
At least 86 people were injured
in Brandon, Wilkinson said. Sixty
homes and dozens of mobile
homes were damaged.
"It just whished through here
like slicing hot butter," Constable
Martin Mann said. "We've got
two-story homes not bigger than
a bag of firewood. They're wiped
out."
Mississippi Power & Light Co.
spokesman Edd Jussely said
power may not be restored to
some homes in the area for two
days.
U.S. Rep. G.V. "Sonny" Mont
gomery, D-Miss., whose district
includes Rankin County, said he
will ask President Bush to declare
the area eligible for federal disas
ter relief.
