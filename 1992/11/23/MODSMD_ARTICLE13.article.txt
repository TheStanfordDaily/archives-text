						violent Big Game 
### 
Security and students
both need to improve
behavior in the future

At what price, rivalry?
The violent sideshow at this
year's Big Game was less an
amusement than a display of
mindless mob mentality.
During the game, two UC-Berke
ley students tackled the Tree, the
Band tackled a Berkeley fan, Berke
ley players ripped off Cardinal cor
nerback Darrien Gordon's helmet
and pummeled him after the final
play, fans catapulted frozen apples
at the bandleaders, and students
flooded the field for a confronta
tional face-off while everyone else
watched in amusement.
Afterward, many fans left the
stadium with disgust, rather than
pride, despite the Cardinal's dis
play of athletic prowess. Instead of
staying in Berkeley for the evening
as they have in years past, many
Stanford students went home
because of the tension and ill will
displayed at the game.
Over the past few years, vio
lence at Big Game has grown expo
nentially. What should be a friend
ly rivalry between two prestigious
schools has sunk to the level of a
bar-room brawl.
When throngs of Stanford and
Berkeley students faced off on the
football field after the game, it
looked for several tense minutes as
if the confrontation would lead to a
riot, the almost-natural conclusion
to the increasingly unfriendly
rivalry.
The near-riot should lead both
schools to take a step back and
reconsider a well-intentioned tra
dition that has clearly gotten out
of hand.
In many ways, the mob mental
ity shown by the Stanford and
Berkeley fans at Saturday's game,
although much less extreme, was
reminiscent of what the country
witnessed only seven months ago.
The campus watched in horror

and disgust as the image of an
angry Los Angeles mob attacking
an innocent truckdriver after the
Rodney King verdict was played
over and over on national televi
sion. But the rioters mindset
wasn't so different from the
overzealous Stanford fans who
cheered as frozen apples and
oranges were catapulted from the
stands toward the security guards
and a Berkeley bandleader.
The only difference, it seems, is
that L.A. actually had something
to be angry about. All Stanford
and Berkeley students have is a
rivalry based on nothing but the
dictates of tradition.
The week before Big Game, the
rivalry had already begun to mani
fest itself in ways less playful and
clever than destructive and angry.
Putting laundry detergent in the
Claw is a clever prank, meant to
bolster the fun of the rivalry;
defacing the Rodin Sculpture Gar
den is unoriginal, motivated more
by anger than school spirit.
While it's truly pathetic that
students from two of the most
prestigious schools in the country
must be restrained by police lines
and fences during a sporting
event, Berkeley and Stanford
have no choice but to increase
safety enforcement at future Big
Games.
Berkeley should build a fence —
similar to the one in Stanford Sta
dium — to separate the fans from
the field in Berkeley's Memorial
Stadium. And, for the security
guards' safety as well as crowd
control reasons, there should be
more police officers at the games
wearing riot gear to more effective
ly prevent people from flooding the
field and better control them if
they do.
At Big Games the line between
pranks and violence is getting
increasingly difficult to draw, and
it shouldn't take a serious injury
to convince fans that violence
toward each other is not an appro
priate conduit for school spirit.
It's all fun and games until
someone loses a flag boy.
