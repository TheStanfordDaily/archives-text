Brannerites spoil fun with lots of energy, cheering

TO UNDERSTAND BRANNER'S
actions at the Friday evening Gai
eties, one must only imagine a
mass of immature freshmen . . . high
school freshmen. The actions displayed
by Branner residents clearly show why
they are viewed as the dregs of our cam
pus.
Although I am the first to recognize
that the freshmen class brings a needed
energy to the Stanford atmosphere,
most of us manage to exhibit our enthu
siasm while respecting those around us.
Branner's actions were neither indica
tive of Stanford pride nor respectful to
their fellow students.

Every year, the Big Game Gaieties
production staff works very hard to pro
duce an original work for the enjoyment
of the Stanford students. Part of the
skit that Brannerites disrupted is
designed to poke fun at people or
groups, and a reaction is an expected
and desired part of the production.
Branner, however, went too far.
They lacked the common sense to
realize when their reaction became
excessive. Perhaps an interruption of a
minute or two would have been accept
able and even amusing, but their 10
minute tirade was both indicative of
their image and disrespectful to the

Gaieties cast.
Furthermore, Branner continued to
bellow in their insecure pack despite
efforts of the producers to quiet them.
Finally, the production was forced to
change to another scene without allow
ing the present one to finish. This was
not only unfair to the people who had
worked long hours on preparing and
rehearsing for their parts, but also to
the audience who had come to watch a
show and not the immature antics of
the Branner wad.
Branner acted as if they were the
only people in the auditorium while
the rest of us wished they were the

only people not in the auditorium. Can
such a group which projects such a
lack of individualism and class hope to
have a sense of pride for themselves or
their school? If 86 percent of Stanford
students believed Branner sucked
before their childish actions, what per
centage would think them worth keep
ing now?
I would doubt Branner has the decen
cy to apologize to the Gaieties cast and
the Stanford community. But if there
exists some class in this dismal herd,
then let us see it.
