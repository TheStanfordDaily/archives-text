# Thanksgiving, like Columbus Dag, could use a re-examination

### 
Some 500 years ago Columbus and
several boats full of disoriented, leather
reeking Spaniards arrived at a small,
tropical island. They quickly met with
indigenous people and asked them what
resources were available. Enthused by
the response they received, they led
more Europeans to this "newly discov
ered" land.
These Spaniards subjugated the
indigenous people and instituted slave
labor-intensive production techniques.
Since the region gained independence,
the descendants of the Spaniards, fueled
by their European values, have bickered
amongst themselves and killed each
other while exploiting both Indians and
the poor.
Some 372 years ago, several boats full
of ill-prepared, religious refugees landed
on the windy shores of the continent.
They, too, met indigenous people, who
assisted them in surviving their first

winter in the region. Of course, these
British colonists, happy to be alive, sup
posedly celebrated the first Thanksgiv
ing along with the Indians. Afterwards,
they too led more Europeans to this
"newly discovered" land.
These visitors also subjugated the
indigenous people and instituted slave
labor-intensive production techniques.
The descendants of the British, fueled
by their European values, proceeded to
push their way to the Pacific Ocean,
killing Indians and Mexicans along the
way, while exploiting the Indians and
other disenfranchised minorities.
Years after colonial rule ended, the
newly independent society glorified
Columbus' daring journey. Eventually,
though, modern society developed a
more accurate understanding of the
ramifications of his travels. In fact, cur
rent proposals to rename the holiday
marking his arrival have received
widespread support because we may cur
rently be celebrating the arrival of geno
cide.
Unfortunately, though, society still
glamorizes the Pilgrims' "Thanksgiving"
despite the similarity between the after
math of their arrival and that of Colum

bus'. By some strange twist of fate
Columbus has been singled out as a vil
lain. Meanwhile, on Thursday, we will
gather around a native bird of the Amer
icas and give thanks for the safe arrival
of a group that went on to behave much
the same way Columbus and his follow
ers did.
