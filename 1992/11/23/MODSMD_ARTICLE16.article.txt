# Kudos to Stanford Savoyards on a quite 'yummy' performance
## 
### 
This is a brief letter to commend the
Stanford Savoyards on their truly
extraordinary performance of Gilbert
and Sullivan's "The Mikado." I know
whereof I speak because I have seen this
marvelous theatrical piece more than a
dozen times — in London, New York,
Washington, Toronto and initially in
Ithaca as an undergraduate at Cornell,
where Dorothy Sarnoff — later to be a
star with Gertrude Lawrence in the
original company of "The King and I" —

played the role of Katisha.
On opening night the singing, acting
music direction, staging and costuming
were truly professional. The entire cast
deserves great credit, but particular
kudos go to Ben Evans, whose Ko-Ko
was in the finest tradition of the never
to-be-forgotten Martyn Green of Lon
don's D'Oyle Carte Company.
This gem deserved to sell out its per
formances last week. It was truly
yummy!
