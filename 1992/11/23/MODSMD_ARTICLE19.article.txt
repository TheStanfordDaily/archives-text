## Let's give football a break 
### 
WITH AS MUCH SUCCESS and
as many national titles as Stan
ford's female athletes have
enjoyed, you'd think they'd get a better
shake. They swim as many laps, shoot
as many layups and score as many goals
as their male counterparts, yet they
receive less than half as many scholar
ships.
The Department of Athletics would
love to help them out, but looking at
Stanford's budget woes makes it crystal
clear why red is both our school color and
our school mascot. We simply don't have
the resources.
Or do we? A closer look at the break
down shows that the football team alone
gets more scholarships (95) than all of
the women's sports combined (70). Why
should a fourth-string tight end who
never sets foot on the field get a full ride
while All-Americans in other sports
receive nothing? It's clearly unfair, and
many frustrated people have pointed to
reducing football scholarships as the
answer to this problem of inequity. But
before we think we've discovered the
solution, let's try to better understand
the big picture.
Suppose we added exactly one scholar
ship to every other varsity sport —
there's 30 of them — by making cuts
from the football program. Football
would lose less than one-third of its allot
ment and would still have more than

four times as many scholarships as any
other sport.
Football is easily one of the most spe
cialized Division I sports with at least 24
different positions, not including special
teams. The number of scholarships they
get allows for a depth of about three or
four men per spot.
Of course, you can't just cut the third
and fourth-stringers. Stanford recruiters
look for potential starters — nobody
recruits a kid believing his future is in the
role of third backup at nose guard. A
cross-section of talent would be cut,
including about seven or eight players
who would eventually be listed first on
the depth chart.
Which eight are you willing to lose?
Stenstrom, Wetnight, Lynch, Bryant,
Cook, George, Garnett and Lasley per
haps? Does anyone honestly think that
we'd have anything even close to a win
ning record without these guys?
With widespread cuts, the entire team
would take a monstrous turn for the
worse. In the fanatically competitive
world of college football, we'd become an
instant Oregon State.
This emphasis on winning isn't an
acceptable excuse for inequity. But the
impact of winning is. With a solid pro
gram, Stanford can earn literally millions
more annually from television networks,
ticket sales, bowl game revenues, alumni
gifts and the like, than they would with a

consistent basement-dweller. A success
ful football team is a bonanza for an ath
letics department.
If the football team loses this money
the entire Athletics Department would be
hit hard, and wind up losing much more
money per sport than they tried to save.
Women's sports could be much worse off
in the long run. Creatively cutting away
at football's seemingly gargantuan bud
get would only serve to haunt us.
Gender equity is a noble concept, but
to enforce it without thinking about the
potential ramifications is simple and
shortsighted.
Disregarding football, women and
men receive an almost identical number
of scholarships at Stanford. Women, with
fewer athletes, actually get a much high
er percentage of scholarships per partici
pant. If we look critically, the situation
isn't nearly as unequal as it might first
appear.
Football's our cash cow. We can either
kill it for one night of burgers or we can
milk it for years to come.
