# Security problems abound as rivalry hits new heights
## 
### Ed Donovan Staff writer 
Saturday's 95th Big Game proved to be a not-so
friendly rivalry, as UC-Berkeley fans maimed The
Tree and attacked Stanford's "Flag Boy," while
players scuffled and students from both schools
hurled insults, fruit and paint.
The antics began at halftime, as apples, oranges
and other paraphernalia rained down on the Stan
ford Band from the Cal student section. As the Tree
danced and other band member "bodyguards"
Fielded the fruit with lacrosse sticks, two Berkeley
students charged the field and tackled the band
mascot, knocking him to the ground and ripping his
costume.
Greg Siegel, who plays The Tree, tried to retali
ate but could not get his outfit off.
" I had so much padding on that I was sort of glad
I got hit," he said. "I was definitely expecting it."
One of the attackers escaped, but band members
caught the other and subjected him to a merciless
beating until police and security guards pulled him
away.
"I tried to get in there but there were too many
people," Siegel said. "I just threw a lemon at him."
Both Berkeley students were eventually arrest
ed, charged with criminal "trespassing with intent

to interfere with lawful busi
ness," cited, released and referred
to the student conduct board,
according to the San Jose Mer
cury News.

1 wanted to hit him,
actually, but he was
about five-foot-four so
there was no point. If
I had beat the hell out
of him I would have
been arrested.'
— Seye Ewedemi

Later, Siegel was contacted
about the possibility of pressing
battery charges against the stu
dents, but he said has not made a
decision.
"If I was a Cal student I prob
ably would have done the same
thing," he said. "But I might
press charges to scare the crap
out of them."
In an unrelated incident late
in the game, yell leader Seye
Ewedemi, also known as "Flag
Boy," was ambushed as he
paraded the big red "S" flag close
to the Bears' student section. A
Cal student grabbed the flag and
threw it to another who began to
run away. Ewedemi vaulted into
the stands and caught his
attacker.
"I wanted to hit him, actually,
but he was about five-foot-four
so there was no point," Ewedemi
said. "If I had beat the hell out of
him I would have been arrest
ed."
No one was arrested in the
incident.
Ewedemi, who stands 6-3 and
weighs 220 pounds, bemoaned
the lack of security at the stadi
um and the size of his attacker.
"It's always these little guys who
want the whole world to see," he
said.
"Some of (the pranksl are

good natured, but when they
destroy property, it's uncalled
for. That guy should either be
arrested or they should let me go
at him for about a half an hour,"
he said.
On the last play of the game,
the players joined in the vio
lence. Stanford cornerback
Darrien Gordon intercepted a
pass and lost his helmet when
tackled by tight end Steve
Stafford.
An unidentified Cal player
apparently gave Gordon a late
hit, prompting Stanford inside
linebacker Tom Williams to
retaliate with a punch, and both
benches emptied in confronta
tion.
"I hate to say it, but I got car
ried away out there," Williams
said.
As the conflict dissipated,
Stanford fans trickled onto the
field to savor the victory. But
moments later, the much larger
Cal student section flooded the
field and approached the Stan
ford crowd.
Students from both schools
hurled obscenities, fruit and
paint at each other. After some
shoving and a few punches, secu
rity personnel drove the two
groups apart.

'If I was a Cal student
I probably would
have done the same
thing.'
— Greg Siegel

Radio commentators relating
the post-game action on the field
described the scene as a "30-yard
demilitarized zone," but no
arrests were made.
Still hungry for action, some
Stanford students began chant
ing "Goalposts, goalposts!"
Police quickly surrounded the
goalposts, and a real charge was
never mounted.

the lack of security at the stadi

want the whole world to see," he
said.

good natured, but when they
destroy property, it's uncalled

arrested or they should let me go

Kurt Criter and the Stanford football team wade through a sea of Cal opponents as tempers flare after the last play of Stanford's 41-21 Big
Game victory.
Saturday's 95th Big Game proved to be a not-so
friendly rivalry, as UC-Berkeley fans maimed The
Tree and attacked Stanford's "Flag Boy," while
players scuffled and students from both schools
hurled insults, fruit and paint.
The antics began at halftime, as apples, oranges
and other paraphernalia rained down on the Stan
ford Band from the Cal student section. As the Tree
danced and other band member "bodyguards"
Fielded the fruit with lacrosse sticks, two Berkeley
students charged the field and tackled the band
mascot, knocking him to the ground and ripping his
costume.
Greg Siegel, who plays The Tree, tried to retali
ate but could not get his outfit off.
" I had so much padding on that I was sort of glad
I got hit," he said. "I was definitely expecting it."
One of the attackers escaped, but band members
caught the other and subjected him to a merciless
beating until police and security guards pulled him
away.
"I tried to get in there but there were too many
people," Siegel said. "I just threw a lemon at him."
Both Berkeley students were eventually arrest
ed, charged with criminal "trespassing with intent

Later, Siegel was contacted
about the possibility of pressing
battery charges against the stu
dents, but he said has not made a
decision.
"If I was a Cal student I prob
ably would have done the same
thing," he said. "But I might
press charges to scare the crap
out of them."
In an unrelated incident late
in the game, yell leader Seye
Ewedemi, also known as "Flag
Boy," was ambushed as he
paraded the big red "S" flag close
to the Bears' student section. A
Cal student grabbed the flag and
threw it to another who began to
run away. Ewedemi vaulted into
the stands and caught his
attacker.
"I wanted to hit him, actually,
but he was about five-foot-four
so there was no point," Ewedemi
said. "If I had beat the hell out of
him I would have been arrest
ed."
