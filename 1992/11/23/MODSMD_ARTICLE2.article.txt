Tree and attacked Stanford's "Flag Boy," while

The antics began at halftime, as apples, oranges
and other paraphernalia rained down on the Stan

danced and other band member "bodyguards"
Fielded the fruit with lacrosse sticks, two Berkeley
students charged the field and tackled the band
mascot, knocking him to the ground and ripping his

One of the attackers escaped, but band members
caught the other and subjected him to a merciless
beating until police and security guards pulled him
away.

people," Siegel said. "I just threw a lemon at him."
Both Berkeley students were eventually arrest
ed, charged with criminal "trespassing with intent
