## Hoops waffles Belgian squad 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Belgium's National Women's Basketball Team
learned Friday night why Stanford is the best college
squad in the country.
The defending national champion Cardinal com
bined smothering defense with excellent first-half
shooting in routing their European opponent 95-55
at Maples Pavilion.
From the opening tipofT, Stanford's intensity ran
high, and the Cardinal proceeded to build an insur
mountable lead within the first few minutes of the
contest.
The team's tenacious defensive style overwhelmed
its opponent. It often forced Belgium to keep the ball
on the perimeter and take low-percentage outside
shots. When Belgium did attempt to penetrate the
Stanford defense, the result was usually a Stanford
steal or a turnover.
On the other end of the court, sophomore forward
Rachel Hemmer took charge on offense. She scored
11 of her 17 points by the 10-minute mark to help the
Cardinal gain a 20-point advantage over their oppo
nents.
What makes this convincing victory even more
impressive is the fact that the Cardinal accomplished
it without the help of senior point guard Molly Good
enbour. Goodenbour was forced to return home due
to an illness in her family.
However, sophomore Kate Paye, Goodenbour's
replacement, made the most of her opportunity in a
starting role. Paye gathered 10 assists and showed
head coach Tara VanDerveer that she is quite capa
ble of contributing to Stanford's offensive game.
"She is a smart player who doesn't make a lot of
mistakes," VanDerveer said. "I'm very pleased with
her improvement."
VanDerveer was also impressed by the perfor
mance of redshirt freshman Bobby Kelsey, who has
not played in a game for two years due to an injury.
"Bobby looked great, considering it was her first
game in two years. She'll add so much to our team,
VanDerveer said.
Kelsey converted her first shot of the game, a
three-pointer, en route to a 9-point, 6-rebound effort.
Stanford opened the second half with a 32 point
lead, and continued its domination of the Belgian
squad. The half was characterized by a slower tempo
in which the Cardinal focused on getting the ball to
their center.
Senior All-American Val Whiting muscled her way
to a game-high 22 points, while sophomore Anita
Kaplan added 15 of her own.
Though Stanford played well enough to crush this
preseason opponent, it will need to step up its play if
it is to get by 12th-ranked Texas Tech in its home
season opener on Dec. 1.
According to VanDerveer, "We didn't move the
ball as well as we needed to on offense, and we
have to work on our individual defense ... In addi
tion, I think we need to improve our free-throw
shooting."
