# New, improved Cardinal
## 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
This is more than just part two
of last year.
With 1992'8 national champi
on starting five intact and only
two players not returning, the
word on Stanford has been how
much has stayed the same. How
ever, for the nearly 2,000 fans in
attendance, Friday's blowout of
the Belgian Nationals reflected

not stasis, but significant and
promising change.
Coach Tara VanDerveer was
particularly pleased with the
much-anticipated beginning of
redshirt freshman Bobby Kelsey's
Stanford career. Entering the
game early in the first half, the 5-
foot-11 forward received a warm
welcome from the Maples Pavil
ion faithful, and then responded
with 9 points and 6 rebounds in
her 23 minutes of playing time.
Noting this was the "first time
she's played in a game in two
years," VanDerveer welcomed
Kelsey's performance as "a good
confidence builder." Though wear
ing a protective brace, Kelsey
showed no ill effects of the knee
injury that kept her on the side
lines last year.
Cardinal fans also got a preview

of the increased role center Anita
Kaplan is likely to play this season.
Blocking two shots, Kaplan helped
key the Cardinal's intimidating
interior defense that held Belgium
to only eight points in the paint.
She and VanDerveer both
attributed much of the sopho
more's improvement to the experi
ence of playing against bigger and
stronger opponents on the Cardi
nal's two-week trip to France this
summer. Kaplan's 15 points and 8
rebounds Friday more than dou
bled her average output last sea
son (6.4 ppg/3.7 rpg).

After the game, VanDerveer
said she felt "a lot of confidence in
playing a lot of players." And with
preseason All-American Molly
Goodenbour unavailable, that feel
ing translated into increased play
ing time for guards Kate Paye and
Angela Taylor.
Starting in place of Goodenbour
at point guard, sophomore Paye
made the most of her team-high
32 minutes, dishing out 10 assists
while only turning the ball over
twice. Taylor, a senior and team
captain, scored five points, two of
which came on a crafly steal and

length-of-the-court drive that trig
gered a thunderous crowd
response.
Friday's fans also saw the two
newest Cardinal-players in action
when freshmen walk-on guards
Amanda Renteria and Amy
Wustefeld came in for the game's
last two minutes. In what could
have been a glimpse at the future,
Wustefeld racked up her first
assist on a snap-entry pass to
Kaplan and then brought her
teammates on the bench to their
feet by nailing a three-pointer
from the top of the key.
