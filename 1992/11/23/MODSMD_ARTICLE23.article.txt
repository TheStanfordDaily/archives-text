# Bears take Big Splash, Cardinal remains No.2 as regular season ends
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
When Stanford's second-ranked water
polo team left for Big Splash to face No.l
California at the Bears' home pool, it had
three goals in mind, according to coach
Dante Dettamanti; Stanford failed to
accomplish any of these in an 8-5 loss last
Saturday.
First, the Cardinal hoped to capitalize
on high percentage scoring opportunities.
Second, the team needed to fill the offen
sive void left by sophomore All-American
and team scoring leader Wolf Wigo, who is
out with a back injury.
Finally, the defense had to gear
towards preventing Cal's centerforwards
from their usual feasting at the expense of
Stanford's goalkeepers. The Cardinal had
been unable to meet any of these objec
tives in their previous two losses to Cal
this year.
Cal (23-0) earned its 41st consecutive
victory overall, ending the Cardinal's reg
ular season with a 20-5 record.
The Golden Bears are now 10 games
behind the all-time consecutive wins
record, held by Stanford.
Despite solid performances in the first
and final two quarters, Stanford's second
period effort and the dominance of Cal's 6-
foot-6, 220 pound, German Olympic team
member Dirk Zeien ended the Cardinal's
hopes of victory.
Indeed, the Cardinal outscored the
Bears in the first quarter 3-2, and broke
even with Cal in the second half with two
scores each.
In addition, Stanford's defense limited
the Bears to a mere eight goals for the con
test, the lowest point production by Cal
this season and its second lowest in three
years.
However, by the second quarter, the
Bears had mounted a 5-0 run.
Zeien keyed Cal's spurt, accounting for
50 percent of the Golden Bears' entire
offensive output, accumulating four total
goals.
He scored once from two meters, twice
on six-on-five power play advantages and
once with two seconds remaining in the
first half.
That buzzer-beater occurred when
Stanford lost possession on poor transi
tion passing during a fast-break counter
attack. Zeien got the ball in a one-on-two
situation against junior goalie Larry

Bercutt and a defender.
The defender failed to steal the outlet
pass to Zeien, thereby giving Zeien a clear
look at the Cardinal goal cage.
Although Stanford's overall defensive
effort proved quite effective, Cal took
advantage of small lapses such as these.
On the offensive end, Stanford encoun
tered great difficulties, demonstrated by
its five goal showing.
The Cardinal scored only twice on
counterattacks, while its other points
resulted from three of six successful six
on-five situations.
As before, if Stanford had converted on
more high-percentage scoring opportuni
ties, it may very well have prevailed with
a Big Splash victory.
Senior John Matarangas provided the
only bright spot for the Cardinal's
offense, scoring three of its five total goals
in the defeat. Classmate Chip Blanken
horn and junior Chris Wallin each con
tributed one.
"We missed Wolf [Wigo]," said Stan
ford head coach Dante Dettamanti.
"That's going to be true any time you
don't have a player who averages two
I goals | a game."
Unfortunately, according to Dettaman
ti, the Cardinal will also have to compete
in next weekend's NCAA Championship
Tournament in Long Beach without the
services of Wigo.
Wigo, the Cardinal's main scoring
threat, injured his back two weeks ago
during a scrimmage, and has aggravated it
by trying to return to full practice too
soon.
"We can still beat Cal," Dettamanti
said, referring to a possible NCAA title
game between second-seeded Stanford
and the top-seeded Bears.
"We can't play a perfect game, but we
almost have to. to beat Cal."
