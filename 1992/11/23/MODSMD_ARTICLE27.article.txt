contrast to Big Game at
Memorial Stadium on Saturday,
the No. 2 Stanford women's vol
leyball team only took about an

And there was no post-game riot
after this one.

Cardinal sweeps Bears
15-7, 15-13, 15-6

The Cardinal handily won the
match, blowing out the Golden
Bears 15-7, 15-13, 15-6 for the vic
tory.
Stanford (23-2, 16-2 in Pacific
10 Conference) rattled off points in
quick succession against the Bears
(11-16,6-12 in Pac-10), largely due
to the play of seniors Kristi Paaso
and tri-captain Bev Oden, as well
as freshman Cary Wendell.
Oden registered a .382 hitting
percentage with 16 kills, nine digs
and four blocks for the match to
lead the Stanford attack.
Paaso hit .244 with 13 kills,
nine digs and three blocks for the
Cardinal, while Wendell added 11
kills and a whopping 17 digs.
For California, Elaina Penido
led the charge with 15 kills, nine
digs, and a .440 hitting average.
Cara Dane added 11 kills and 17
digs for the Bears, but could only
muster a .148 hitting percentage.
California hit .183 as a team,
and only six players registered kills
for the team.
Stanford, on the other hand, hit
a modest .245 for the match, but
poured in 70 team digs on the night.
The win marks Stanford's 20th
consecutive victory over the Gold

en Bears, and the Cardinal leads
the overall series with California,
31-3.
