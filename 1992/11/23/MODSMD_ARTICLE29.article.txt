# Men to take on New Zealanders
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
With one more practice game
to go before the Cardinal tips it up
for real, it seems only appropriate
for Stanford to emphasize that it
truly is a world-renowned univer
sity.
And what better way is there to
do so than by playing some hoops
with a bunch of New Zealanders?
That is precisely the event that
will take place tonight, as the
Stanford basketball team hosts
the New Zealand National Team
in its second exhibition game in
Maples Pavilion at 7:30 p.m.
The Cardinal is 1-0 in the exhi
bition season, after beating the
AAU Blue and Gold Fleet 93-92 in
overtime last Thursday night.
The unit that Stanford puts on
the floor tonight will be depleted,
once again, as the injury bug con
tinues to pester the squad.
Forward Jason Weaver (ten
dinitis in the knee), forward Andy
Poppink (lower back pains) and
guard Bobby Patton (strained
calf) will not suit up, and will join
center Jim Morgan (herniated
disk) for a good view of the game
from the bench.
Meanwhile, the New Zealan
ders are in the midst of a nine
game United States swing before
returning home. Tonight will con
clude the northern California por
tion of the Nationals' tour, and
they most likely will be happy to
leave. In recent days, they have
lost to Santa Clara (90-69), Pacif
ic (83-57) and St. Mary's (89-69).
After the matchup with Stan
ford, the New Zealanders will take
a brief detour to Nevada to take
on Nevada-Reno before heading
to southern California to finish up
their trip with games against Cal
State-Northridge and USC.
The exhibition will again pro
vide the young Cardinal front line
the chance to gain much-needed
experience in the blocks. Todd
Manley, Bart Lammersen and

Darren Allaway should be able to
feel more comfortable in the post
against the Nationals, who do not
have the height and muscle of the
Blue and Gold Fleet big men.
"The post (men) just need time
to learn," said coach Mike Mont
gomery. "We had three guys with
very little playing experience play
all 40 minutes last week. They are
going to make mistakes, so this is
the time when we can try to cor
rect them."
The Nationals' big gun is 6-
foot-8 forward Neil Stephens.
Stephens has averaged 23.3
points per game in the New
Zealanders' three northern Cali
fornia contests, including a 27-
point performance against Pacific.
Also, 6-foot-8 forward Peter
Pokai, who scored 17 points
against Santa Clara, should prove
to be a big part of the offense.
The Cardinal might be able to
exploit the Nationals in the back
court, since the Nationals rely on
pounding the ball inside to
Stephens in a half-court attack.
Marcus Lollie's quickness in lead
ing the transition game should
allow for some easy Cardinal bas
kets. Also, the fresh legs of
reserves Kenny Hicks and Dion
Cross could wear out the stamina
of the Nationals' guards.
Card Notes:
Admission to tonight's exhibition
is free . . . Coach Mike Mont
gomery has announced the sign
ing of two new fecruits during the
early November signing period:
Rich Jackson, a 6-foot-6 guard
from Provo, Utah, a McDonald's
All American who averaged 22.1
points in his senior year of high
school in 1991, and is currently
serving a two-year Mormon mis
sion is Auckland, New Zealand;
and Bevin Knight, a 5-foot-10
point guard from Seton Hall Prep
in East Orange, N.J. who has been
named the MVP of the New Jer
sey state high school basketball
tournament each of the past two
seasons.
