# Senior citizens' luncheon 10-year tradition
## Alpha Phi Alpha emphasizes need for continuing service in East Palo Alto

As William Martin and eight of his Alpha Phi
Alpha fraternity brothers served lunch to a group of
senior citizens in East Palo Alto on Friday, he eager
ly explained what it takes to make a difference in the
community.
"You've got to be there consistently," said the
African-American fraternity's vice president.
"These brothers of mine are committed to be there
always."
Martin said that the luncheon, which the frater
nity has held every quarter for the last 10 years, is
one example of what East Palo Alto needs from
Stanford students — a long-term commitment.
The mostly African-American group of 32 seniors
ate Martin's special recipe Ctyun chicken, along with
corn, string beans, cornbread and carrot cake.
Money raised from the fraternity's step shows paid
for the food, which the brothers spent all night cook
ing, Martin said.
After the seniors finished eating, the a cappella
group Talisman performed four songs, including the
unofficial South African anthem.
One woman got up to dance during two of the
songs. Some seniors clapped along at their seats and
swung to the rhythm, while others talked among
themselves. Many of them were eager for the singers
to return.
East Palo Alto doesn't need "one-time people,"
Martin said, noting his fraternity's regular service
programs. In addition to mentoring young people at
the youth development center and working with
kids at the East Palo Alto library, the fraternity
counsels a group of fourth grade boys once a month.
After 10 years of providing lunch for the seniors,
"a couple of people recognize us, they do remember
us, they know who we are," Martin said. "That's
why you have to keep coming back."
"Every year it's very good," said one woman who
has attended for the past six years.

East Palo Alto has changed "a lot" since she
moved there in 1962, she said, noting, "We see a lot
of changes we don't like but there's nothing we can
do." What the city needs most, she said, is
"money. . .to get the drugs out."
The main problems affecting the community,
Martin said, are "the lack of black males that are
doing something" and the lack of emphasis on edu
cation.
Martin said he joined the fraternity because of
"the need for strong male black role models" and "to
focus energies with other black males with the same
ideas."

'You've got to be there
consistently .... [East Palo Alto
doesn't need] one-time people.'

Junior Ron Berry called for greater involvement
by East Palo Alto's affluent neighbor. "We have Palo
Alto, a supposedly intellectual community. . .if
they're so smart why doesn't Palo Alto Ido some
thing about the conditions in East Palo Alto,]" he
said. "It's a shame and an indication of trickle-down
economics."
When junior Robert Ernest first came to Stan
ford, he was surprised by the sharp line dividing the
two cities. "There is no blending," he said.
Despite East Palo Alto's problems, Ernest said its
citizens still have hope. "You gotta have hope," he
said.
As an Alpha Phi Alpha brother, sophomore Chris
Donald says he is "learning how to sacrifice . . . time."
He and his brothers "are not asking for anything in
return" but "are giving (the seniors I a lot," he said.
"If I can make them smile, that's what's important."
