The ASSU has discovered that
last year's books didn't balance,
and this year they may show some
red ink as well.
For the 1991-92 fiscal year,
ASSU Financial Manager Chris
tine Vargas said she has deter

mined that the ASSU overproject
ed its income from business pro
jects and other sources, possibly by
as much as $40,000.
She said that during an ongoing
audit of the 1991-92 fiscal year, the
ASSU discovered it came $8,000
short of meeting its projected oper
ating income. Although the audit is
not complete, Vargas estimated

that the shortfall would most likely
be between $35,000 and $40,000.
Vargas informed the ASSU Sen
ate of the possible shortfall at its
meeting last week, warning that
with expenses continuing at their
current rate, the ASSU will en
counter more financial woes.
"At this point we will be at a loss
I for 1992-931," Vargas said.

Vargas said the situation is not
serious, especially given the ASSU's
large reserves, but she added that
the association has often made
large profits in the past and has not
had to deal with budget shortfalls.
Vargas said the University's de
crease in funding has also hurt the
ASSU's financial situation. The
University cut their ASSU subsidv

to $89,495 last year â€” a 42.1 per
cent decrease from the year before.
"I don't think we can make any
more major capital improvements
for students, like the Memorial Au
ditorium sound system," said un
dergraduate senator Cecilia Tom.
"We just have to be careful be
cause in the past we've been mak
ing money," Vargas said.
