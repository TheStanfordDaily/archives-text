# Men's section approved
## Self-defense for Women now complies with Title IX

In order to comply with new
federal anti discrimination law,
the "Issues in Self-Defense for
Women" course will offer a special
section for men beginning next
quarter.
Once taught through SWOPSI,
the traditionally women-only
class is now being offered by the
Feminist Studies Program. But
when Title IX anti-discrimination
regulation — which requires that
all classes l>e equally accessible to
males and females — threatened
its acceptance into the program,
organizers decided to create the
men's section.
Alyson Yarns, class of '87, who
is helping to plan the new section,
said the instructors wanted to
open the course to men without
sacrificing its original format.
The course focuses on physical
defense techniques geared for a
woman's body and promotes dis
cussion of readings about sexual
assault in an all-female environ

The new men's section will use
the same reader — containing ar
ticles, personal accounts and poet
ry having to do with violence to
ward women — as the women's
classes, but it will not have a phys
ical component.
The issue of creating a men's
section first arose when the Stan
ford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues program fell victim
to budget cuts. Students rallied to
save the popular Issues in Self-De
fense course by having it offered
through the Feminist Studies
Program.
But Title IX regulations be
came a "stumbling block" in the
transition to Feminist Studies,
Yarus said.
Since SWOPSI was viewed as
peripheral to the academic cur
riculum, the course organizers
had previously been able to estab
lish a "women preferred" state
ment in its description and main
tain its format, she said.

year, said the course's instructors
