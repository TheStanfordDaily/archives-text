# Men's section approved
## Self-defense for Women now complies with Title IX 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
In order to comply with new
federal anti discrimination law,
the "Issues in Self-Defense for
Women" course will offer a special
section for men beginning next
quarter.
Once taught through SWOPSI,
the traditionally women-only
class is now being offered by the
Feminist Studies Program. But
when Title IX anti-discrimination
regulation — which requires that
all classes l>e equally accessible to
males and females — threatened
its acceptance into the program,
organizers decided to create the
men's section.
Alyson Yarns, class of '87, who
is helping to plan the new section,
said the instructors wanted to
open the course to men without
sacrificing its original format.
The course focuses on physical
defense techniques geared for a
woman's body and promotes dis
cussion of readings about sexual
assault in an all-female environ
ment.

The new men's section will use
the same reader — containing ar
ticles, personal accounts and poet
ry having to do with violence to
ward women — as the women's
classes, but it will not have a phys
ical component.
The issue of creating a men's
section first arose when the Stan
ford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues program fell victim
to budget cuts. Students rallied to
save the popular Issues in Self-De
fense course by having it offered
through the Feminist Studies
Program.
But Title IX regulations be
came a "stumbling block" in the
transition to Feminist Studies,
Yarus said.
Since SWOPSI was viewed as
peripheral to the academic cur
riculum, the course organizers
had previously been able to estab
lish a "women preferred" state
ment in its description and main
tain its format, she said.
Yarus, who taught the class last
year, said the course's instructors
agreed it "would absolutely not
work" with mixed-sex classes, and
sought out alternatives.
Last year's Coordinator of Stu
dent Sexual Assault Prevention
Education, Susan Epstein, first
suggested the idea of a men's class
"as sort of a joke," Yarus said.
"But then we got serious about
it, and actually created this spe
cial section," she said. "We were
really excited about it."
Members of the Women
Defending Ourselves Collective,
which oversees the self-defense
courses, said they are still in the

planning stages because no class
of this kind has ever been offered
at Stanford.
Suzanne Rehmus, a 1989 grad
uate who is also organizing the
men's section, said the men's dis
cussions will focus on viewing vio
lence against women from a
female perspective.
"Although I don't want to gen
eralize about the reactions of all
men, I think there is a possibility,
because of the nature of the read
ings, that they can be interpreted
as male-bashing," Rehmus said.
However, Rehmus and Yarus
both emphasized that the intent
of the class is not to alienate or
incriminate men.
"This is not a class we want
[men] to take so we can beat them

over the head," Yarus said. "We
like men. We don't think they're
all evil."
Junior Matt Mizel, who said he
is planning on taking the class,
said, "Rape is usually portrayed
as a women's issue, but it's really
everyone's issue."
"What it comes down to is that
men rape, [and] it's men that
need to stop raping."
First-year graduate student
Steven Lacy, who is also a mem
ber of the discussion group, said
his philosophy is that "women
can't really oppress men. Even if
it is male-bashing, oppression has
to occur from a position of power.
"After all that women have
gone through, mon should be able
to take it," Lacy said.

Lacy added that he wants to
look into teaching the course.
"I'm really interested in the read
ings, and I'd love to learn and
teach at the same time," he said.
Yarus said either she or
Rehmus will teach the class, along
with a male instructor.
"We debated over what gender
the teachers would be," Yarus
said. "We thought it would be
problematic to have one woman in
a room of all men, representing
the voice of all women.
"But then to have one man
represent the voice of all women
would be even more problematic,"
she said.
The men's section will need an
enrollment of at least five students
to continue through the quarter.

Yarus said either she or
Rehmus will teach the class, along
with a male instructor.
"We debated over what gender
the teachers would be," Yarus
said. "We thought it would be
problematic to have one woman in
a room of all men, representing
the voice of all women.
"But then to have one man
represent the voice of all women
would be even more problematic,"
she said.
The men's section will need an
enrollment of at least five students
to continue through the quarter.
In order to comply with new
federal anti discrimination law,
the "Issues in Self-Defense for
Women" course will offer a special
section for men beginning next
quarter.
Once taught through SWOPSI,
the traditionally women-only
class is now being offered by the
Feminist Studies Program. But
when Title IX anti-discrimination
regulation — which requires that
all classes l>e equally accessible to
males and females — threatened
its acceptance into the program,
organizers decided to create the
men's section.
Alyson Yarns, class of '87, who
is helping to plan the new section,
said the instructors wanted to
open the course to men without
sacrificing its original format.
The course focuses on physical
defense techniques geared for a
woman's body and promotes dis
cussion of readings about sexual
assault in an all-female environ
ment.

The new men's section will use
the same reader — containing ar
ticles, personal accounts and poet
ry having to do with violence to
ward women — as the women's
classes, but it will not have a phys
ical component.
The issue of creating a men's
section first arose when the Stan
ford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues program fell victim
to budget cuts. Students rallied to
save the popular Issues in Self-De
fense course by having it offered
through the Feminist Studies
Program.
But Title IX regulations be
came a "stumbling block" in the
transition to Feminist Studies,
Yarus said.
Since SWOPSI was viewed as
peripheral to the academic cur
riculum, the course organizers
had previously been able to estab
lish a "women preferred" state
ment in its description and main
tain its format, she said.
Yarus, who taught the class last
year, said the course's instructors
agreed it "would absolutely not
work" with mixed-sex classes, and
sought out alternatives.
Last year's Coordinator of Stu
dent Sexual Assault Prevention
Education, Susan Epstein, first
suggested the idea of a men's class
"as sort of a joke," Yarus said.
"But then we got serious about
it, and actually created this spe
cial section," she said. "We were
really excited about it."
Members of the Women
Defending Ourselves Collective,
which oversees the self-defense
courses, said they are still in the

planning stages because no class
of this kind has ever been offered
at Stanford.
Suzanne Rehmus, a 1989 grad
uate who is also organizing the
men's section, said the men's dis
cussions will focus on viewing vio
lence against women from a
female perspective.
"Although I don't want to gen
eralize about the reactions of all
men, I think there is a possibility,
because of the nature of the read
ings, that they can be interpreted
as male-bashing," Rehmus said.
However, Rehmus and Yarus
both emphasized that the intent
of the class is not to alienate or
incriminate men.
"This is not a class we want
[men] to take so we can beat them

over the head," Yarus said. "We
like men. We don't think they're
all evil."
Junior Matt Mizel, who said he
is planning on taking the class,
said, "Rape is usually portrayed
as a women's issue, but it's really
everyone's issue."
"What it comes down to is that
men rape, [and] it's men that
need to stop raping."
First-year graduate student
Steven Lacy, who is also a mem
ber of the discussion group, said
his philosophy is that "women
can't really oppress men. Even if
it is male-bashing, oppression has
to occur from a position of power.
"After all that women have
gone through, mon should be able
to take it," Lacy said.

Lacy added that he wants to
look into teaching the course.
"I'm really interested in the read
ings, and I'd love to learn and
teach at the same time," he said.
Yarus said either she or
Rehmus will teach the class, along
with a male instructor.
"We debated over what gender
the teachers would be," Yarus
said. "We thought it would be
problematic to have one woman in
a room of all men, representing
the voice of all women.
"But then to have one man
represent the voice of all women
would be even more problematic,"
she said.
