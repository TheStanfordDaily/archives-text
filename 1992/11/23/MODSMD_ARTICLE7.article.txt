# Gunther Nagel's historical legacy
## 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Medical School Prof. Emeritus Gunther Nagel
wanted to leave students with a sense of Stanford
history.
The noted surgeon and author, who was one of
the University's oldest alumni, died last Tuesday
at the age of 98, but he has left behind a written
history that will be distributed annually to all in
coming freshmen.
"His dying wish was to make sure the book is
published," said Lee H. de Broff 111, who served as
editor of Nagel's "Stanford Sketches." "He has been
trying to get it published for two decades now."
De Broff, who finished a master's in biology last
year, has been working with Nagel since June,
combining Nagel's published and unpublished ar
ticles about Stanford history with old photos.
"Four days before he died, we finished going
over the copy of the book," de Broff said. "It is a re
ally excellent book."
Every freshman will receive the book after
shaking hands with University President Gerhard
Casper during their traditional visit to Hoover
House at the beginning of autumn quarter.
De Broff said he first met Nagel while research-

ing Ray Lyman Wilbur, who served as University
president from 1916 to 1941.
Nagel, de BrofTsaid, was one of the best people
to talk to about the project; after all, he knew
Wilbur personally.
Nagel first came to Stanford in
1913, joining the football team and
majoring in zoology. Upon gradua
tion, he entered the Stanford Med
ical School in San Francisco.
After receiving his medical
degree, Nagel went on to the Mayo
Clinic to receive further training
before returning to become a clini
cal professor of surgery at Stan
ford in the late 19205.
Since retiring in 1959, Nagel
wrote about a variety of historical
subjects, including "A Stanford
Heritage," about the founding

physicians of the Medical School;
and "Iron Will: The Life and Let
ters of Jane Stanford."
"The most important thing he
did was to single out Jane Stan
ford as being responsible for the
continuation of Stanford," de
BrofT said. "The Board of Trustees
demanded she close the Universi
ty. She said, 'Over my dead body,'
or words to that effect."
Devoting the last few months of
his life to putting together "Stan
ford Sketches," Nagel kept in
mind a statement by Mark Twain.
"Mark Twain said that a classic
is something that everybody has
but nobody has read," de Broff
said. "We made sure to edit this
book so that it is something every
one will want to read."
