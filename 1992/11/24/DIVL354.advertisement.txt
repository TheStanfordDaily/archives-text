Solutions from your Apple Campus Reseller
The holiday gift you can really use.
Tell your folks a new Macintosh will help
you succeed today as well as tomorrow.
It shows you're thinking ahead.
An Apple' Macintosh*computer is the one holiday gift that will help
you work better and faster from one new year to the next. Because
Macintosh is so easy to use. And thousands of software applications are
available to help you with any course you'll ever take. There's even
software that allows you to exchange information with computers
running MS-DOS or Windows. In fact, Macintosh is the most compatible
computer you can buy. And the advantages of Macintosh don't end
when school does — the majority of Fortune 1000 companies now use
Macintosh computers! So ask your Apple Campus Reseller to help you
choose which Macintosh to put at the top of your holiday gift list.
Macintosh. It's more than a present, it's a future.
