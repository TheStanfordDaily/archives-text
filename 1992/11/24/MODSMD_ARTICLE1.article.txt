# Beyond issues of 'black and white'
## Zapata RF works to get Chicano voice recognized

Coda cabeza es un mundo —
"Every mind is a world."
While Casa Zapata resident
fellow Tony Burciaga says his
interactions with Stanford stu
dents underscore the truth of
his favorite dicho, this expres
sion seems equally applicable
to the writer, poet and muralist
himself.
Through his creative works,
Burciaga has endeavored to
open up his experience as a Chi
cano — to help establish a cul
tural identity for his people.
"We Chicanos are the invisi
ble minority," says Burciaga.
"We're still trying to get a voice
to be recognized and dealt
with."
Recognition has always been
a central theme in the Chicano
movement. But building a cul
tural identity — which is so cru
cial to recognition — has been
difficult. Especially since Chi
canos have been glossed over
countless times by the rest of
America, Burciaga says.
"This country is so blind.
Most Americans can only think
in terms of black and white," he
says."The riots in Los Angeles
involved as many or maybe
even more Latinos than African
Americans. We suffered.
"Not that many people
know, for instance, that during
the depression more than
700,000 Mexicans and Mexi
can-American citizens were de
ported under the guise of repa
triation," he continues. "It's up
to us to educate through poet
ry, murals, Chicano studies
classes and multiculturalism."
Burciaga has taken up that

challenge, most recently with his
award-winning poetry anthology,
"Undocumented Love/Amor
indocumentado." In the work,
which incorporates pieces span
ning from 1974 to the present,
Burciaga focuses on the daily
struggles and realities of Chicano
life in an unaccepting and unac
knowledging nation.
"My writings are based upon life
itself, and in the trappings of the
bicultural-bilingual," he said. "Basi
cally they are about the struggles,
joys and ironies of the sometimes

absurd and poignant life of the Mex
ican-American in this country."
In recognition of this effort,
Burciaga received an American
Book Award, which are often given
to distinctive artists.
And Burciaga's work seems espe
cially deserving of the award, which
states, "Majority rule must give way
to pluralism — there is no one liter
ary standard. Everyone knows that
Columbus did not 'discover' Ameri
ca. We are still discovering America.
And we will continue to do so."
"The emphasis of these awards
is on contributions to literature
that [is] often ignored or not given
visibility," according to Burciaga.
In his book, Burciaga expresses
the experiences of his people

through a fluid and personal style,
accented by his brand of ironic
humor. He cites the Chicano move
ment as a creative catalyst: "[lt]
gave me a sense of liberation about
being able to write in Spanish,
English and a mixture of the two."
Operating without traditional
barriers and rules, Burciaga's
artistic gifts open outward to a
wider audience. He appeals to
readers across social and economic
strata and avoids falling into the
usual trap of writing simply for a
few academic elite. Mindful of his
roots, he stays down-to-earth — an
important step towards cultural
unity. Burciaga emphasizes, "My
best audience listens and hears my
poetry. It is not in academia."

Burciaga's experimentation has
led him beyond the written word to
other arts. "Art expresses our expe
riences through our language, our
colors and our way of seeing and
doing things," he says. "Culture
carries our symbols, our icons, and
so it's almost as if art documents
culture in the best way possible."
Burciaga stresses, "My culture
has been the most direct influence
to my artwork. At my age, I've
been able to experience some phe
nomenal things like the birth of a
culture, the birth of new words,
new sounds and new music.
"I've witnessed how the Mexican
culture transculturated into this
Anglo-American culture and vice
versa. That we don't necessarily

assimilate into Anglo-American cul
ture but that it's a two-way street. It
also assimilates to us — even to the
point that tacos and salsa sell more
than hamburgers and ketchup."
Burciaga's experiences have
given him the strength of corazon,
which is evident in his artistry. But
Burciaga does not stop at the canvas
or the word processor. His passions
overflow into his daily interactions
with the students of Casa Zapata.
Charlie Montoya, a resident
assistant in Zapata in 1985 and
1987, says emphatically, "It is
impossible to deny the contribu
tions that Tony makes to modern
Chicano culture and especially the
contributions he makes to the stu
dents in Zapata."

Burciaga's enthusiasm for his
students is evident as he explains
the living truth of his favorite
expression. "Here at Stanford we
can become so aware of the truth
in that dicho: If you talk to every
person, every student, they have
their own little stories from their
communities.
"Here at Zapata I hear their sto
ries: they are so beautiful, so won
derful. Regardless if that person is
Vietnamese, Mexican-American,
African-American, the whole
works: that is what multicultural
ism is all about, not only a certain
culture, but the struggle of races
and people and how they survive
and excel in this country. Coda

being able to write in Spanish,
English and a mixture of the two."
Operating without traditional
barriers and rules, Burciaga's
artistic gifts open outward to a
wider audience. He appeals to
readers across social and economic
strata and avoids falling into the
usual trap of writing simply for a
few academic elite. Mindful of his
roots, he stays down-to-earth — an
important step towards cultural
unity. Burciaga emphasizes, "My
best audience listens and hears my
poetry. It is not in academia."

Burciaga's experimentation has
led him beyond the written word to
other arts. "Art expresses our expe
riences through our language, our
colors and our way of seeing and
doing things," he says. "Culture
carries our symbols, our icons, and
so it's almost as if art documents
culture in the best way possible."
Burciaga stresses, "My culture
has been the most direct influence
to my artwork. At my age, I've
been able to experience some phe
nomenal things like the birth of a
culture, the birth of new words,
new sounds and new music.
"I've witnessed how the Mexican
culture transculturated into this
Anglo-American culture and vice
versa. That we don't necessarily

assimilate into Anglo-American cul
ture but that it's a two-way street. It
also assimilates to us — even to the
point that tacos and salsa sell more
than hamburgers and ketchup."
Burciaga's experiences have
given him the strength of corazon,
which is evident in his artistry. But
Burciaga does not stop at the canvas
or the word processor. His passions
overflow into his daily interactions
with the students of Casa Zapata.
Charlie Montoya, a resident
assistant in Zapata in 1985 and
1987, says emphatically, "It is
impossible to deny the contribu
tions that Tony makes to modern
Chicano culture and especially the
contributions he makes to the stu
dents in Zapata."

Burciaga's enthusiasm for his
students is evident as he explains
the living truth of his favorite
expression. "Here at Stanford we
can become so aware of the truth
in that dicho: If you talk to every
person, every student, they have
their own little stories from their
communities.
"Here at Zapata I hear their sto
ries: they are so beautiful, so won
derful. Regardless if that person is
Vietnamese, Mexican-American,
African-American, the whole
works: that is what multicultural
ism is all about, not only a certain
culture, but the struggle of races
and people and how they survive
and excel in this country. Coda
cabeza es un rnundo!"
Coda cabeza es un mundo —
"Every mind is a world."
While Casa Zapata resident
fellow Tony Burciaga says his
interactions with Stanford stu
dents underscore the truth of
his favorite dicho, this expres
sion seems equally applicable
to the writer, poet and muralist
himself.
Through his creative works,
Burciaga has endeavored to
open up his experience as a Chi
cano — to help establish a cul
tural identity for his people.
"We Chicanos are the invisi
ble minority," says Burciaga.
"We're still trying to get a voice
to be recognized and dealt
with."
Recognition has always been
a central theme in the Chicano
movement. But building a cul
tural identity — which is so cru
cial to recognition — has been
difficult. Especially since Chi
canos have been glossed over
countless times by the rest of
America, Burciaga says.
"This country is so blind.
Most Americans can only think
in terms of black and white," he
says."The riots in Los Angeles
involved as many or maybe
even more Latinos than African
Americans. We suffered.
"Not that many people
know, for instance, that during
the depression more than
700,000 Mexicans and Mexi
can-American citizens were de
ported under the guise of repa
triation," he continues. "It's up
to us to educate through poet
ry, murals, Chicano studies
classes and multiculturalism."
Burciaga has taken up that

challenge, most recently with his
award-winning poetry anthology,
"Undocumented Love/Amor
indocumentado." In the work,
which incorporates pieces span
ning from 1974 to the present,
Burciaga focuses on the daily
struggles and realities of Chicano
life in an unaccepting and unac
knowledging nation.
"My writings are based upon life
itself, and in the trappings of the
bicultural-bilingual," he said. "Basi
cally they are about the struggles,
joys and ironies of the sometimes

absurd and poignant life of the Mex
ican-American in this country."
In recognition of this effort,
Burciaga received an American
Book Award, which are often given
to distinctive artists.
And Burciaga's work seems espe
cially deserving of the award, which
states, "Majority rule must give way
to pluralism — there is no one liter
ary standard. Everyone knows that
Columbus did not 'discover' Ameri
ca. We are still discovering America.
And we will continue to do so."
"The emphasis of these awards
is on contributions to literature
that [is] often ignored or not given
visibility," according to Burciaga.
In his book, Burciaga expresses
the experiences of his people

through a fluid and personal style,
accented by his brand of ironic
humor. He cites the Chicano move
ment as a creative catalyst: "[lt]
