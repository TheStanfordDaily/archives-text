## Doctor helps end another patient's life 
### 
SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) - Dr. Jack
Kevorkian attended the suicide of a cancer patient
yesterday, bringing his total of documented
assisted suicides to six.
Catherine A. Andreyev, 46, of Coraopolis, Pa.,
turned on a device that allowed her to inhale car
bon monoxide gas through a mask, police said.
"I consider this a well-tested, well-controlled,
well-thought out medical procedure," Kevorkian
said.
"The aim of suicide is to end a life," he said.
"The aim of this is to terminate unbearable suf
fering. I've made progress because for one more
human being, suffering is ended."
Kevorkian was charged with murder after the
first three deaths, but each time the cases were
dismissed because Michigan has no law against
assisted suicide. A prosecutor said he wouldn't file
charges in the latest case.
His Michigan medical license has been sus
pended, but he remains licensed in California.
Andreyev had suffered from cancer for six years,
said Kevorkian's attorney Michael Schwartz.
Schwartz said Andreyev's condition was one
"where she had no hope of a normal life, where
her every day was wracked by pain, where she
could not sleep because of her condition."
She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1986,
when her cancerous right breast was removed,
Schwartz said.
Andreyev had approached Kevorkian through
letters and received counseling over the tele
phone, Schwartz said.
Kevorkian had met with Andreyev's oncologist
about her condition and had seen her medical
reports, Schwartz said.
Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thomp
son, who charged Kevorkian in previous cases,
said he wouldn't file charges in the latest case.
"I've tried three times, and I feel any further
efforts would be useless and counterproductive,"
Thompson said. "The ball is in the court of the
House of Representatives. It's time for them to do
their job, which is to make public policy."
Efforts to ban assisted suicide have stalled in
Michigan's House.
