# Fascists kill Turks in small German town
## In newest violence wave, Turkish homes burned; small town shocked by hatred and three deaths 
### 
MOELLN, Germany (AP) — Bahide
Arslan was the matriarch of a sprawling
Turkish family woven so tightly into the
fabric of the tidy west German town of
Moelln that even the Germans sometimes
called her "Mama."
But yesterday, rightist hatred cut the
heart out of the Arslan family — and took
a piece of this town with it.
In the early morning, thugs torched the
yellow, three-story stone house the pros
perous Arslans had peacefully and happily
occupied for nearly three decades. Mrs.
Arslan, 51, died as she lay atop a grandson,
protecting him from the smoke and flames.
Another child, granddaughter Yeliz
Arslan, 10, died in the blaze, along with
14-year-old Ayse Yilmaz, a visiting rela
tive from Turkey.
Moments later, fire broke out nearby at
another large home which was housing
Turkish families. Three people were hurt
but all survived, including a man who first
threw a mattress to the ground before
dropping his child from three stories up.
An anonymous person called police and
said two houses were burning, signing off
with a "Heil Hitler."
The wave of rightist violence spreading
across Germany has finally crashed down
on this town of 18,000 people, about 25
miles east of Hamburg, leaving people
stunned, ashamed and angry.
Chief federal prosecutor Alexander von
Stahl quickly took over the murder inves
tigation.
More than 1.6 million Turks comprise
Germany's largest foreign group, a tight
subculture whose strength of numbers
and sense of community have allowed
them to better withstand the almost daily
assaults by radical thugs on foreigners.
The Arslans came here as guest workers
and built a prosperous life. They ran a
small restaurant on the main street of
Moelln and worked at a variety of local jobs.
Wolfgang Stapelfeldt, 41, has employed
many of the Arslans at his clothing recy
cling business outside town, including
Mrs. Arslan.
"She was a wise woman, very com

manding. Everybody called her Mama,"
said a tearful Stapelfeldt.
"Mama Arslan is dead?" Said a Viet
namese woman at his shop, her look of
shock melting into tears.
"It shames me as a German," Stapelfeldt
said. "I am ashamed of what the world
thinks of us. This is a small group of bad
people, they are young and lifeless," he said
of rightist radicals.
Others could scarcely believe that three
people could be so wantonly slain.
"I lived here for 18 years and there
have been no problems," said Richie
Demircan, 29, a Turk who works in the
Arslan restaurant located in the charm
ing, historic center of this clean, pic
turesque city.
"My God, My God! What do I do now?"
cried Farouk Arslan, 29, Mrs. Arslan's son
and Yeliz's father.
Several hundred people, some holding
lighted candles, marched through down
town Moelln to protest the attack. Some
young Turks gathered on street corners
and plotted revenge.
Aly Kaya, 22, one of Mrs. Arslan's sons
in-law, moved out of the family home with
his wife just one month ago. Yesterday he
stood in front of a police barricade and
stared at the husk of a home.
"They took three of ours," he said.
"Now we will take three of theirs."
Moments later he streaked up the street
where a group of other Turks had confront
ed a German youngster. Kaya slugged the
youth in the face and the German ran away.
"He is with the rightist scene here,"
Kaya said. "I know he knows something."
Salvatore Callavaro, an Italian immi
grant, and his German wife, Gaby, walked
to the end of the cobblestone street to the
barricade and handed a bunch of flowers
to a police officer. The officer placed the
bouquet in the charred hole where the
front window of the house once was.
Callavaro was asked if he knew the
Arslans.
"They were here for 25 years. Everyone
knew the Arslans," he said.
He started to cry.

said two houses were burning, signing off
with a "Heil Hitler."
The wave of rightist violence spreading
across Germany has finally crashed down
on this town of 18,000 people, about 25
miles east of Hamburg, leaving people
stunned, ashamed and angry.
Chief federal prosecutor Alexander von
Stahl quickly took over the murder inves
tigation.
More than 1.6 million Turks comprise
Germany's largest foreign group, a tight
subculture whose strength of numbers
and sense of community have allowed
them to better withstand the almost daily
assaults by radical thugs on foreigners.
The Arslans came here as guest workers
and built a prosperous life. They ran a
small restaurant on the main street of
Moelln and worked at a variety of local jobs.
Wolfgang Stapelfeldt, 41, has employed
many of the Arslans at his clothing recy
cling business outside town, including
Mrs. Arslan.
"She was a wise woman, very com

manding. Everybody called her Mama,"
said a tearful Stapelfeldt.
"Mama Arslan is dead?" Said a Viet
namese woman at his shop, her look of
shock melting into tears.
"It shames me as a German," Stapelfeldt
said. "I am ashamed of what the world
thinks of us. This is a small group of bad
people, they are young and lifeless," he said
of rightist radicals.
Others could scarcely believe that three
people could be so wantonly slain.
"I lived here for 18 years and there
have been no problems," said Richie
Demircan, 29, a Turk who works in the
Arslan restaurant located in the charm
ing, historic center of this clean, pic
turesque city.
"My God, My God! What do I do now?"
cried Farouk Arslan, 29, Mrs. Arslan's son
and Yeliz's father.
Several hundred people, some holding
lighted candles, marched through down
town Moelln to protest the attack. Some
young Turks gathered on street corners
and plotted revenge.
Aly Kaya, 22, one of Mrs. Arslan's sons
in-law, moved out of the family home with
his wife just one month ago. Yesterday he
stood in front of a police barricade and
stared at the husk of a home.
"They took three of ours," he said.
"Now we will take three of theirs."
Moments later he streaked up the street
where a group of other Turks had confront
ed a German youngster. Kaya slugged the
youth in the face and the German ran away.
"He is with the rightist scene here,"
Kaya said. "I know he knows something."
Salvatore Callavaro, an Italian immi
grant, and his German wife, Gaby, walked
to the end of the cobblestone street to the
barricade and handed a bunch of flowers
to a police officer. The officer placed the
bouquet in the charred hole where the
front window of the house once was.
Callavaro was asked if he knew the
Arslans.
"They were here for 25 years. Everyone
knew the Arslans," he said.
He started to cry.
