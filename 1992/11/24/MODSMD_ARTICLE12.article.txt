# French farmers protest against U.S.-EC treaty

### 
PARIS (AP) — Farmers burned hay
and gave away white wine yesterday to
underline their demand that France scut
tle the U.S.-European Community accord
that cuts exports of subsidized European
crops.
Huge nationwide demonstrations are
planned for tomorrow, when the National
Assembly debates last week's accord,
designed to avert a trans-Atlantic trade war.
About 300 farmers surrounded a Coca-
Cola plant at Grigny, a town south of Paris,
in a symbolic protest against the United
States. In Paris, vandals covered the home
of former Agriculture Minister Louis Mer
maz with graffiti.
In Orleans, south of Paris, farmers
burned tires in front of a McDonald's
restaurant and passed out free white wine
to mock the U.S. threat to impose $300 mil
lion in penalty duties on European prod
ucts, mostly white wine.
The penalties would start next month
and would hurt France the most.
French Agriculture Minister Jean-
Pierre Soisson said that following assem
bly debate, France will likely call for an
extraordinary summit of EC leaders to dis
cuss the trade negotiations.
The U.S.-EC agreement would resolve
the final disputes between Washington
and the 12-nation European Community
and pave the way for a long-delayed global
trade agreement under the General Agree

ment on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
EC foreign ministers must each
approve the accord.
French farmers, who account for 6 per
cent of the work force but form a powerful
and vocal lobby with broad public support,
claim the accord goes too far beyond cut
backs in EC farm subsidies agreed to in
May.
The Socialist government, which faces
national elections in March, has thus far
avoided alienating the farmers.
The National Federation of Farm
Unions, France's largest farming group,
urged farmers across Europe to converge
on Strasbourg in eastern France, the seat
of the European Parliament, on Dec. 1 to
show solidarity.
In northern and western France yester
day, farmers marched, blocked roads with
tractors, burned tires and hay, and dumped
rice in front of government buildings.
Farmers in Grigny burned tires in front
of the Coca-Cola plant and denounced
"American hegemony."
No violence was reported at the plant,
but production was halted for three hours
at the factory, which turns out 20 million
cases of large bottles of Coke a year.
Coca-Cola "is the biggest symbol of an
America that wants to extend its hegemo
ny more and more," said Herve Morizet of
the National Center for Young Farmers,
one of the protesters at the plant.
