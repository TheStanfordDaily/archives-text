No improper hostage deal
WASHINGTON (AP) - The 1980 Reagan-
Bush campaign probably did not strike a hostage
deal with Iran but was on "the outer limits of pro
priety" in its dealings on the issue, congressional
investigators concluded yesterday.
The investigators said there was insufficient
credible evidence to suggest that the campaign
negotiated a delay in the release of 52 American
hostages in order to ensure Ronald Reagan's elec
tion, as some have alleged.
"The great weight of the evidence is that there
was no such deal," concluded the report, issued by
the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on
the Near East after a seven-month investigation.
But the panel also found that the Republican
campaign team, headed by William Casey, was
intensely interested in the hostage issue and came
dangerously close to improper interference in U.S.
foreign policy while monitoring the situation.
Senator accused of harrassment
WASHINGTON (AP) — Women's groups urged
the Senate yesterday to investigate allegations by
10 women that they were targets of unwelcome sex
ual advances from Sen. Bob Packwood. Several
activists on women's issues said the Oregon senator
should resign, but an aide said he would not.
Two Oregon members of Congress, both
Democrats, said the Senate Ethics Committee
should review the allegations.
"Obviously they ought to look at this. Other
wise it is a farce to have such a committee," said
Harriett Woods, head of the National Women's
Political Caucus.
