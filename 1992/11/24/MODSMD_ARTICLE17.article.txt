## Bring back storage 
### 
American self storage of
Palo Alto is looking to do a
whopping business this com
ing summer. American and its
overpriced colleagues are the ben
eficiaries of the University's
recent decision to cut summer
storage for students. Meanwhile,
students — you guessed it — are
getting hurt.
As if last year's decision to dis
continue summer storage in most
dorms on campus wasn't enough,
the University has reaffirmed its
insensitivity to student's storage
needs by cancelling summer stor
age in Row and Cowell Cluster res
idences.
Last year, an appropriate cry of
student discontent was enough to
get the administration to provide
storage for one more summer.
This year, however, it looks as if
students will be sent packing for
the summer.
Considering the needs of Stan
ford's geographically diverse stu
dent body, summer storage is one
student service that simply

shouldn't be cut. Few Stanford
students can simply pack their
stuff in the back of the station
wagon and drive home at the end
of the school year.
The ones who can't will be
forced to somehow get their
belongings to a storage company
and pay the going rate of $35-$4O
per month for a small storage unit.
The ordeal of students left with
out storage might not seem so
tragic if University explanations
for cutting summer storage
weren't so inadequate. Many of
the problems with storage cited by
the University have been worked
around in the past, and others
seem eminently solvable.
The most plausible reason for
cutting storage — economic con
straints — could be overcome by
charging students a nominal fee
for summer storage use. It is one
they would gladly pay rather than
hike to a storage facility.
Not all student services deserve
to survive budget cuts, but this one,
due to its feasibility and utility, does.
