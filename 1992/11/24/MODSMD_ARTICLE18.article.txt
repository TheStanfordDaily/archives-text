# Applaud the Greeks
## 
### 
The big game bonfire
and the 100 th Anniversaiy
Rally held in Burnham Pavil
ion weren't the only pre-game
options offered last Thursday
evening.
For the first time ever, a group of
fraternities and sororities har
nessed the energy surrounding the
Stanford/UC-Berkeley rivalry, and
put it to good use — a campus-wide
party benefiting the Salvation
Army and several local food banks.
"The response was fantastic,"
exclaimed Sigma Chi social chair
Jerry Lewis yesterday. He esti
mates over 700 to 800 people —
mostly outside the Greek commu
nity — participated donating cloth
ing, food and money.
For these organizations to orga
nize an event during the one time

of the year when the campus unites
under one goal — suggests a strong
commitment to community and
public service among Stanford's
Greeks that is often overlooked.
By nature, exclusive organiza
tions such as fraternities and soror
ities are often more painstakingly
scrutinized by the University com
munity then most other student
organizations. Consequently, these
organizations' mistakes are far
more visible than their triumphs.
Nonetheless, it is important to
allow them the opportunity to
prove their worth.
As Lewis noted, "If we can moti
vate the Greek community, we have
a lot of power to do some good." And
it seems clear that the six sororities
and fraternities responsible for the
benefit party have done just that.
