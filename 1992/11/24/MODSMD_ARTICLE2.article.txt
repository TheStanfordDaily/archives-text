# Students on a la carte system unsatisfied
## 
### Jake Dorman Staff writer 
Despite University efforts to smooth out
problems in the Food Service points system,
many students are complaining that they have
hundreds of extra points while others say they
have to sneak food to get enough to eat.
"Everybody ends up hiding things under the
pasta," said sophomore Mike Oristian. "It's the
only way you can afford it."
"It's easier to steal the food then pay for it,"
said freshman Audrey Leung.
Students in Stern, Kimball, Manzanita II
and Sterling Quad are required to purchase an a
la carte, or "points", food service plan, in which
they pay for each item individually.
Housing and Food Service increased "point
prices" of food items after students were left
with large surpluses of unused points at the end
of fall quarter last year. They also added an
"extra light" meal plan to the regular and light
board plans.
But now, Stern residents say that many stu
dents — and perhaps as many as 50 percent of all
men on the "regular" plan — have too few points.
"There's a lot of frustration," said junior Gina

Johnson. "A lot of people have had to reduce their
intake. People are not as full as they want to be."
But Craig Mitchell, Food Service's A la Carte
Manager, said most students are actually above
the recommended point totals. As of Nov. 15, stu
dents on the regular meal plan still had an aver
age of403.92 points, around 40 points more than
the suggested allocation for that date, he said.

"Nobody's in vast danger of running out of
points," Mitchell said. "They can control their
eating habits and they won't have a problem.
"The vast majority of people are fine or have
more than enough [points]. No one's out of
points," he said.
Mitchell estimated that fewer than 10 per
cent of all students in the A la Carte plan are
under the recommended point level.

In contrast to the Stern residents, many
Kimball residents say they generally have far
more points than they need because Kimball
does not serve breakfast or any meals on the
weekend, and they often choose to eat off-cam
pus or at Tresidder Union rather than eat at
Stern or Wilbur Halls.
"Some are running out, others have so many
points over (the recommended allotment] that
it's ridiculous," said senior Kellen Glass, a resi
dent assistant in Kimball.
In response to student concerns, Food Ser
vice has provided meal planners and notified
students who have far too many or too few
points. They have also introduced "value" en
trees offering more filling food for fewer points,
Mitchell said.
"What I want to do is charge fair prices relat
ed to the actual price of the product," said
Mitchell. "We're trying to price things at a fair
level comparable to the outside level."
However, some students contend that food
service prices are exorbitantly expensive.
"Essentially to survive on the point system,
you have to get a lot of one item," Oristian said.
