## Who's an ugly feminist? 
### 
ONE OF MY ALL-TIME favorite
cartoons is a scribbly picture of a
boy in shorts and droopy socks talk
ing with a girl in a baggy dress and match
ing bow in her hair. The boy says, "You're
only a feminist because you're UGLY."
The girl, walking away, replies, "Actually
I'm a feminist because you're a BOY."
It's a pretty strange notion to suggest
that women who demand legal, social and
personal rights only do so because they
can't get what they want with their sex
appeal. Or is it? Last year a friend's room
mate had a sign posted next to his door
that read, "Life is tough. It's even tougher
if you're stupid. And it's really tough if
you're a fucking feminazi at Stanford."
No doubt about it, fear of feminism
sparks some pretty bizarre comparisons.
What makes feminism so dangerous that
it is continually turned into a dirty word?
I was almost surprised when I first
saw pictures of feminist authors like Glo
ria Steinem or Naomi Wolf — I just
wasn't expecting them to be beautiful
women. Feminists are stereotyped as
ugly, not because they are unattractive,
but because in our current societal struc
ture, physical beauty is seen as a
woman's key to achieving her goals.
Witness Cindy Crawford, Revlon
supermodel and Pepsi accessory. She was
recently quoted in the Chronicle as say
ing, "Beauty has given me the opportuni
ty not to be bitter, so I can be a better per

son." Please feel free to barf.
Being labeled as ugly is supposed to
make one powerless. So associating fem
inism with ugliness, or militancy, or rad
icalism, is a clear attempt to diffuse the
power that women have gained by con
fronting this system of values.
But we've given up all those old
appearance-dependent prejudices by
now, right? As if American women lipo
suctioned 200,000 pounds of fat from
their bodies last year, at a cost of $3,000
per pound, solely for the good of their
health.
But there are plenty of women who
aren't achieving success by their looks —
hurray for all the new women senators.
So it's now perfectly acceptable that a
woman's achievements be the product of
her own brains and guts, that her influ
ence on even the highest office in the land
be viewed in a positive way?
Hillary Clinton did not become one of
America's top hundred lawyers by flash
ing her pearly whites. But radio pro
grams during the presidential election
never stopped wondering about the con
nection between her professional success
and her husband's governorship. And the
spiteful whispers of "liberated" that
echoed her chocolate chip cookie com
ments were enough to make her disap
pear from the last four months of the
presidential campaign.
And now that the flights from Little

Rock to D.C. can be confirmed, a political
witticism about the first lady-elect
appeared in The Daily. "Life in the New
White House," read the cartoon's head
line. "Snookums," says a voice from
inside the White House, "we need to
dream up a pet cause to keep you occu
pied . . . you know . . . like Nancy's drug
issue, or Barbara's literacy drive."
Another replies, "But Hillary . . .
I love this cartoon for pointing out
Hillary's strong, multi-talented personal
ity. But the cartoon also puts its finger on
a pulse of real uneasiness about women
becoming strong enough to threaten the
limitations most deeply and subtly
embedded in the patriarchal structure of
our society.
As women continue to demand equal
treatment and challenge traditional
stereotypes, ugly associations — like
signs that warn "Beware of the Dog" —
will continue to be used as intimidation
tactics by those fearful of change. But it's
OK. We bite.
