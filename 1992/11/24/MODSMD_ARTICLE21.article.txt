Faux pas suggests indifference to Mexican culture

NOW THAT CASA ZAPATA HAS
become the new watering hole for
herds of late night snackers,
many who may have never considered
going to the theme house will be exposed
to a taste of Latino culture.
Currently, one can see the Day of the
Dead altar, a tribute to the death of our
ancestors. Last Tuesday, while I was vis
iting Zapata, someone pulled up a chair
to the altar behind me. Presumably the
person was inspecting some of the dis
played objects. I didn't find this unusual.
The living tradition within this Mexi
can holiday invites those who have lost
loved ones to add personal momentos to
the altar— much like a community
grave. By the same token, observers are
encouraged to pick up objects that catch
the eye: a poem on the side of a tequila
bottle, cute skeleton candies or flowers.
Without this active participation, the
altar would be symbolic but impersonal.
That night, I heard the rattle of a mara
ca, coming from one of the groups of

whites behind me — it was a cult-like
frantic beat.
Shake, shake, shake — a chorus of
laughter. Someone was leading his table
in "one of those ethnic activities." But
he was entertaining his friends at our
expense, and by doing so, committing
one of the worst faux pas in any cul
ture: disrespecting the dead.
I could not bear to turn around. I re
experienced the same feelings of denial I
felt when I was molested by a "friend" a
few years ago — a reaction that can
only be precipitated from the intrusive
"touch" of another's hands. I tried rea
soning the scenario out in non-threat
ening, "logical" terms.
Unable to decide what was the best
reaction to have, I remained inactive.
Then, my brave Chicana sister reacted.
"I'd appreciate it if you would stop
doing that," she said. "This altar hap
pens to be an important part of my cul
ture."
He consented. As she returned to the

table, one of them said .. Mexican," to
which my friend, responded,"That's right
I'm Mexican and proud of my culture."
Another countered, "Yeah, I'm sure you
are." Then followed bursts of support,
exchanged comments, hushed voices.
My other friend awkwardly returned
us to our original subject. But I was still
enveloped by silence — trying to decide
on a voice to assume. Make a scene, get
violent or sit in apathy?
It was that same defeated feeling I
experienced after the L.A. riots I
observed and participated in earlier this
year — the realization that violence was
not a solution to racism.
Some nights the Zapata dining hall
reminds me of L.A. communities of eth
nic groups and whites, some mixed,
some exclusively of one race, populate
the tables. I celebrate this diversity and
welcome anyone to my table. But if you
are content to remain culturally insensi
tive and assert your Euro-centric arro
gance, you had better leave my table

alone. One of us who does not share my
post-riot views might make you the first
victim of the sequel to the riots.
Every white person has a responsibil
ity to renounce the standard U.S. Amer
ican white role: complacency in the
struggle for racial equality. Many fail to
identify with the cause because it "con
cerns only people of color." This mental
ity stems from and perpetuates igno
rance, the root of racism.
Based on their defensive stand, it
seemed obvious that the group felt their
actions were not offensive. They tried to
justify their behavior to my friend.
Since white America is responsible
for our position in American society, its
voice can contribute to our cause in a
way that few people of color can. How
ever until they commit, colors will be
found on murals and not seated around
tables. I think red will continue to be a
popular color for our muralists.
