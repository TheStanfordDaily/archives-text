# Brannerites defend their behavior during Gaieties
## 
### 
From the moment we arrived on cam
pus, we were bombarded with precon
ceived notions of how "Branner" fresh
men should act.
As residents of Branner Hall, we are
frankly fed up with all the unjustified
animosity directed towards us.
The recent Big Game Gaieties
"Branner sucks" incident exemplifies
the attitude that greets the residents of
our dorm at every function on campus
we attend, from large functions like
Flicks to one-on-one conversations at
various parties.
It would probably begin to bother us
if Branner actually did suck, but in real
ity most, if not all, residents of Branner

would rather live here than anywhere
else.
Even when we find ourselves feeling
sorry for the freshmen living in much
less exciting settings, in Wilbur for
example, we refrain from expressing this
by screaming, "Wilbur sucks, bites,
swallows, licks dripping sores, etc."
We find ourselves only cheering out
of pride and retaliation to jokes (realize
we say jokes, we do think it is funny)
like that in Gaieties. Basically we're say
ing that anybody that was especially
offended by our display of pride at Gai
eties should lighten up and not take
things so seriously.
God knows we don't take the Stan
ford community's constant mockery of
Branner seriously. The writers and
director of Gaieties knew from past
experience that a Branner joke would

meet with a long and obnoxious
response from the Brannerites. Does
anyone really believe the writer's intent
was anything but getting a rise out of
Branner by devoting an entire scene and
page in the program to the theme of
"Branner Sucks?"
If the Stanford community is truly
upset at Branner's displays of unity and
retaliation, then they should stop
attacking us. Flicks, football games and
Gaieties might not be as fun with the
absence of the friendly clash between
Brannerites and non-Brannerites; but if
that is what Stanford wants, we're more
than happy to oblige.
