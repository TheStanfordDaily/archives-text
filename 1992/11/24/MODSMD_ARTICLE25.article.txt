## Senior Stolz nabs second in NCAA run 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Cardinal cross country phenomenon Gary Stolz
placed second at the NCAA Championship meet in
Bloomington, Ind. yesterday in the highest finish
ever for a Stanford runner.
Stolz demolished the 10-kilometer course in a
time of 30 minutes, 56 seconds, thereby gaining All-
America status. Only Bob Kennedy of Indiana fin
ished ahead of Stolz, in a course-record time of
30:17. Kennedy, who represented the United States
in the Olympics in Barcelona, was running on his
home course in front of the Indiana crowd.
Stolz was "the star of the day," according to head
coach Vin Lananna. "He ran a great race."
"The race went exactly like my best hopes," Stolz
continued. As is typical for Stolz, he started out
slowly and was near 50th place after the first kilo
meter. He then started moving forward, passing
runners who perhaps had the speed, but not the
strength.
At about the 7K mark, Stolz shot by Joe Kapko
ry, who was fading. Kapkory, from Washington
State, beat Stolz convincingly at both the Pacific-10
Conference Championships and the District 8 qual
ifying meet, but in Indiana he ran out of fuel, fin
ishing in 12th place.
"Kapkory had tried to keep up with Kennedy,"
Stolz said. "By the 7K mark he was dying hard."
Continuing to surge forward, Stolz found himself
in a pack of about four front runners at the 9K
marker. Kennedy was too far ahead to be seen. "I
just made a move and didn't look back," Stolz said.
"Nobody passed me."
This season Stolz has made a habit of starting
slowly, then making a move that no one could
counter. At both the Stanford Invitational and the
Pac-10 Championships Stolz ran near 15th place
after the first mile, only to place second at the Stan
ford Invite and third at Pac-10's. In the Champi
onship race yesterday, Stolz soundly defeated Kap
kory and Martin Keino of Arizona, who both beat
him at Pac-10's.
"It's where you are after the last mile, not at the
first mile, that wins the race," Stolz said in describ
ing the strategy that produced the Cardinal's first
cross country All-American since 1986.
Stolz said he will have to rethink his decision not
to run competitively after his collegiate career is
over. "Right now I'm just really tired."
Stanford's Louise Watson, who qualified by
virtue of winning the District 8 qualifying meet,
placed a disappointing 52nd in the field of over 180
runners.
"It was muddy, and she got stuck in a pack and
was just not able to move up," Lananna said. Over
all, though "she had a great season."
In team results, the heavily favored Arkansas
men won the team title, followed by Wisconsin. Two
teams from the Big East, Providence and Villanova,
placed second and third, while the Michigan Wolver
ines rounded out the men's top five. The highest
Pac-10 finisher was Oregon, which finished in
eighth place.
Villanova took the women's team title, followed

by Arkansas and Georgetown. Cornell and Provi
dence finished fourth and fifth, respectively. The
women from Washington were the highest finishers
from the Pac-10 in 12th place, followed by Arizona
at No. 14.
Stolz, Stanford's newest Ail-American, is a
senior, but has one year of cross country eligibility
left. Watson, Stanford's only female qualifier, is a
junior. Both said they plan to return next year.
