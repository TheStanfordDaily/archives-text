# Sawin fires up Cardinal

### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
When you watch the Stanford
women's volleyball team play its
final home match of the regular
season tonight, listen carefully
over the roar of the crowd after
Stanford points. You might hear
Laurie Sawin screaming louder
than them all.
Sawin, one of the team's three
senior captains this year, may not
lay down the dominating spikes
of a Bev Oden, but she has been
one of the team's most consistent
back-row players this year. More
importantly, she has provided
this Cardinal team with the emo
tional drive it has needed to get
the job done.
"I'm in charge of getting them
mentally ready," Sawin said.
"When we're down, I try to pick
up the pace and get the winning
spirit going."
Known affectionately by her
teammates and friends as "Tex,"
after the state she moved from
just before high school, Sawin got
her start in volleyball at Corona
Del Mar High School in Newport
Beach, Calif., but at first no one
would even tell her where team
practices were.
"I played soccer my first year,
but I tried to get on the volleyball
team," she said. "I remember the
other players being so mean Lo
me — I was crying after my first
tryout."
But after a summer of tuning
up her game on the Southern
California beaches and playing on
men's teams, Sawin made it as
the only sophomore on the varsi
ty team. Like some of the other
Stanford players, Sawin's high
school team had the dubious
honor of losing to future-team
mate Oden's championship
bound Irvine squad.
And like the other Stanford
players, Sawin was highly recruit
ed coming out of high school. UC-
Santa Barbara, UCLA, Duke and
California were all interested in
Sawin, but in the end there was
only one place she wanted to go.
"I always wanted to come to
Stanford," Sawin said. "Initially I
thought, 'Oh, UCLA! UCLA!' but
I decided that I could get a lot
more out of coming here."
Since then, Sawin has become
the full-time spark plug for the
team, constantly picking up spir
its and motivating her teammates
to play the best volleyball they
can.
"Carrie (Feldman) is the engi
neer and Bev is definitely the
engine," Sawin said. "I guess I'm
like the caboose."

If that's true, there are times
this year you'd swear the train
was being pushed from behind.
Sawin has provided the team
with solid back-row digging all
year, forming a tandem with
front-row hitter Anne Wicks that
has delivered a one-two punch to
Stanford's opponents all year.
Sawin emphasizes the impor
tance of emotion in Stanford's
play this year, especially in the
quest for an elusive national
championship. Her role on the
team, as she sees it, is to keep
that emotion high and maintain a
winning attitude for her team
mates.
"Everyone expects me to be the
fireball," Sawin said. "I think
when I come in the team expects
me to be fired up, and when they
see that it helps them get fired up
too."
Last year's team was able to
bowl opponents over through
sheer individual strength, with
Amy Cooper, Kristin Klein and

Oden. But this year, says Sawin,
the team must rely on coordina
tion and team awareness to over
come opposing teams.
"Last year we had the big
names and all, but this year's
team is unique," Sawin said.
"We're much more balanced now
— everyone knows their role on
the team and we're mentally and
emotionally in sync."
This year, the Cardinal has
had to endure the disappoint
ment of losing twice to confer
ence rival UCLA, the No. 1 team
in the nation and the team that
put an end to Stanford's champi
onship hopes last year. But con
trary to popular belief, Sawin
thinks the Bruins are far from
unbeatable.
"Never say never," Sawin said.
"We can beat them, but we'll
have to beat them mentally,
because in terms of talent on
paper, there's no comparison. If
we believe in it, we can make it
happen."
