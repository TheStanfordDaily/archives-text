# Stanford basketball gives rough welcome to New Zealanders
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
After exchanging gifts in a gesture of
goodwill before the game, the Stanford
basketball team handed the New Zealand
Nationals a going-away present that the
foreigners were not as happy to receive —
a 76-60 exhibition game loss.
Behind the three-point shooting of
Peter Dukes and a solid offensive night
from Brent Williams, the Cardinal was

able to overcome the older and stronger
New Zealanders in a very quiet Maples
Pavilion.
Dukes managed to free himself to sink
5-of-13 three-pointers, finishing with 23
points. Williams was 8-for-13 from the
field and ended the evening with 17
points.
The win allowed Stanford to complete
its exhibition season unbeaten, having
previously defeated the AAU Blue and
Gold Fleet last week. The 2-0 practice

record, however, does not deceive coach
Mike Montgomery, who emphasizes that
the team still needs a lot of practice
before it will be ready for its first regular
season game Dec. 2 against Puget Sound.
"We just have to continue to work on
the little things—(defensive) help and
recover, (offensive) point of attack,"
Montgomery said. "We also need to get
some people back healthy, because we
haven't been able to practice with a full
lineup."

Though injuries have plagued the Car
dinal during the November preseason,
the situation is starting to take a turn for
the better. Jason Weaver should be ready
to resume practice Friday, and Andy Pop
pink has indicated he will be ready for the
season opener.
The Cardinal could have used
Weaver's 238-pound frame against the
Nationals, as Neil Stephens (254
pounds) and Peter Pokai (243 pounds)
used their tremendous size advantage to

muscle Todd Manley, Darren Allaway
and Bart Lammersen inside. Stephens
had 17 points and eight rebounds, and
Pokai added 14 points and 15 rebounds.
The New Zealanders' domination of the
offensive glass did not please Mont
gomery.
"We were getting crushed on the
boards," Montgomery said. "They had 17
offensive rebounds, and that prevents us
from getting out on the break and getting
our transition game going."
