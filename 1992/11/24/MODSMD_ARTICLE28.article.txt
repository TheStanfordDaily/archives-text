# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
The mark of a strong team is depth â€” the
ability to expect good play from more than
just the squad's superstars. This week's
Athletes of the Week demonstrate the cal
iber of their respective Cardinal teams,
excelling outside the limelight to lead Stan
ford to victory.
Ellery Roberts, a transfer fullback from
Miami, finished up the regular season with
a bang, rushing for 117 yards and scoring

two touchdowns in the Cardinal's 41-21 Big
Game rout of the California Golden Bears.
Roberts was following up a 100-yard, one
touchdown effort in Stanford's 40-3 victory
over the Washington State Cougars.
His season-long effort was instrumental
as Stanford garnered a co-championship
with Washington in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, and marked its first nine-win season
since 1971.
After rushing for 84 yards in nine games
in 1990, Roberts sat out the 1991 season
with a neck injury. So far this season,
Roberts has far surpassed his previous Stan
ford achievements, rushing for 627 yards
and six touchdowns, good for second on the
squad behind Pac-10 special teams' Player of
the Week Glyn Milburn.
Roberts is now petitioning for another
year of NCAA eligibility, which would most
likely designate him as the Cardinal's main
offensive weapon for the '93 season, high
lighting his running abilities after the grad
uation of Milburn.

Sophomore Kate Paye capitalized on her
starting role in Friday's basketball victory
over the Belgian National Team to rack up
10 assists for the Cardinal.
Paye stepped up during Molly Gooden
bour's absence to play a team-high 32 min
utes of the contest, with only two
turnovers, to bolster the preseason No.l
ranked Stanford squad's potent scoring

attack.
Paye walked on as a freshman last sea
son, turning in key postseason perfor
mances during the Cardinal's successful bid
for the national championship.
Though not a starter, Paye continues to
add depth to the Stanford roster, helping
the Cardinal net its first preseason slot at
the top of the rankings.
