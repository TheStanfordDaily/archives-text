# Winning attitude

It's not every year that we on
the Farm can spend the holi
days anticipating a Stanford
New Year's Day bowl appearance.
Actually, it's not even every
decade.
In fact, the last time Stanford
had a stake in Jan. 1, Indian
headdresses were still the Farm's
standard Saturday garb, Elvis
was alive and, well, fat, and most
of us were a sheath from nonexis
tence.
The point is that 9-3 seasons
are the Cardinal exception, not
the rule. An extended Bill Walsh
stay could very well change that
premise. But that doesn't mean
we should take 1992's success for
granted.
So whether you're a gridiron
guru, a sun-tanning fan or just
damn proud of your school, this
year's version of Cardinal football
earned a heap of praise.
First and foremost is this
year's senior class. Probably
never in its history has the Farm
unleashed such a talented group
into the NFL draft pool.
Ron George has already earned
first team All-America honors
and John Lynch has been named
to the second team. Glyn Milburn
is a sure-fire early draft pick.
Dave Garnett, Darrien Gordon
and possibly Estevan Avila and

Seyon Albert could join those
three (two if Lynch opts for a
pitching career) in the NFL. On
the offensive side, Ryan Wetnight
and Chris Dalman are not unlike
ly to be selected in the draft's
later rounds, either.

But professional prospects
aside, this collection of seniors
has seen Stanford football's abso
lute transformation all the way
through. They arrived at Stan
ford on the heels of a miserable 3-
6-2 season, and began their
careers under new coach Denny
Green at 3-8.
Green's decision to do some
"housecleaning" and build a
nucleus with these young players
made possible the Cardinal suc
cesses of today. The class that
graduates this spring suffered
another losing season (5-6) in
