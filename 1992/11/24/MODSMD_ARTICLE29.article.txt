# Winning attitude
## 
### 
It's not every year that we on
the Farm can spend the holi
days anticipating a Stanford
New Year's Day bowl appearance.
Actually, it's not even every
decade.
In fact, the last time Stanford
had a stake in Jan. 1, Indian
headdresses were still the Farm's
standard Saturday garb, Elvis
was alive and, well, fat, and most
of us were a sheath from nonexis
tence.
The point is that 9-3 seasons
are the Cardinal exception, not
the rule. An extended Bill Walsh
stay could very well change that
premise. But that doesn't mean
we should take 1992's success for
granted.
So whether you're a gridiron
guru, a sun-tanning fan or just
damn proud of your school, this
year's version of Cardinal football
earned a heap of praise.
First and foremost is this
year's senior class. Probably
never in its history has the Farm
unleashed such a talented group
into the NFL draft pool.
Ron George has already earned
first team All-America honors
and John Lynch has been named
to the second team. Glyn Milburn
is a sure-fire early draft pick.
Dave Garnett, Darrien Gordon
and possibly Estevan Avila and

Seyon Albert could join those
three (two if Lynch opts for a
pitching career) in the NFL. On
the offensive side, Ryan Wetnight
and Chris Dalman are not unlike
ly to be selected in the draft's
later rounds, either.

But professional prospects
aside, this collection of seniors
has seen Stanford football's abso
lute transformation all the way
through. They arrived at Stan
ford on the heels of a miserable 3-
6-2 season, and began their
careers under new coach Denny
Green at 3-8.
Green's decision to do some
"housecleaning" and build a
nucleus with these young players
made possible the Cardinal suc
cesses of today. The class that
graduates this spring suffered
another losing season (5-6) in

1990, but even then it was evi
dent something had changed.
Talk to George, Garnett & Co.,
and you'll hear them speak glow
ingly of that something — the
"winning attitude" Green
instilled in the Stanford program.
This year's seniors made that
winning attitude not Green's, but
their own. And, as George said
Saturday, they've done all they
can to make sure that attitude
becomes a legacy — not some
thing that vacillates with gradua
tions or coaching changes.
Not included in this bunch is
Ellery Roberts, a senior
who, Walsh says, will like
ly be allowed to return for anoth
er season.
Roberts transferred to Stan
ford from Miami after his fresh
man season, and NCAA regula
tions forced him to sit out the
next year (1989). He also missed
the 1991 season with a neck
injury. He has thus used up only
three years of eligibility.
But the NCAA allows players
to remain eligible in their sixth
year of college only under special
circumstances. Roberts, still
awaiting a ruling on his 1993 fate,
was forced by his injury to leave
school altogether for a period last
year. Walsh feels that that will be
judged a circumstance special
enough for Roberts' reinstate
ment.
If he does come back, Roberts
will likely be the Cardinal's fea
tured runner in 1993. His final
two performances of *92 were
nothing short of dominating.
Roberts totaled 217 yards and
three touchdowns rushing in
games against Washington State
and California.

No matter what attitude
they carried with them,
the seniors could not have
finished off the turn-around of
Cardinal football without the
masterful coaching of Bill Walsh.
Walsh navigated his way
through arguably the nation's
toughest schedule and arrived at
a Pac-10 co-championship, Stan
ford's first title since 1971. As he
has giddily pointed out, any team
who knocks off Notre Dame,
USC, UCLA and Cal has had a
"phenomenal season."
Further, if the the easiest way
to judge a man is by looking at
those he surrounds himself with,
Walsh is off to a dashing start.
Fred vonAppen and Terry Shea —
defensive and offensive coordina
tors, respectively — have main
tained the continuity of a fine 1991
team and exploited the talents of
this year's club. Walsh's specialty
coaches include a group of young
ex-NFL veterans who quickly
developed a strong player rapport.
Nothing typified Walsh's lead
ership more than the Cardinal's
ability to bounce back from a
humbling defeat at Washington
(which removed it from the Rose
Bowl picture), and play three of
its finest games of the year.
In short, Walsh took a team
that lost two top-10 NFL draft
picks in Tommy Vardell and Bob
Whitfield and took it to New
(Year's Day) heights.

Kevin Jeffery's postseason logic:
if Oklahoma beats Nebraska on
Friday, Colorado goes to the
Orange Bowl and it's Fiesta time
on the Farm. But if Nebraska
wins, Colorado possibly forces
Stanford the way of the Block
buster. In other words, the Soon
ers could score the Cardinal an
extra $1.5 million and a date in
one of the Big Five bowls.
Guess who he's rooting for.
