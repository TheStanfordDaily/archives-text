# Stanford takes on Hawaii
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Remenants of Barcelona still
linger in Stanford's deGuerre Pool
as the world-class Stanford
women's swimming team opens its
regular season today in a dual
meet against Hawaii.
Led by Olympians Lea Loveless,
Jenny Thompson and Allison Hig
son, the Cardinal boasts one of the
strongest teams in the NCAA,
rivalled only by Florida and Texas.
This summer in Barcelona,
Thompson struck gold in the 400-
meter IM and the 400 freestyle
relay after earning a silver in the
100 free. Fellow Olympian Love
less matched that with a gold
medal in the 400 medley relay and
a bronze in the 100 backstroke.
Summer Sanders, Stanford's
top representative at the 1992
Games, garnered two gold medals
in the 400 medley relay and 200
butterfly, a silver in the 200 IM
and a bronze in the 400 IM. How
ever, Sanders passed up her last
two years of NCAA eligibility and
will be competing for the Stanford
swimming club.
In addition to Olympic glory,
present Cardinal swimmers hold
American records in nine of the 19
NCAA events and are collectively
ranked No. 1 in the nation. With
that track record, Stanford expects
to have no trouble at all with the
unranked Hawaii Rainbows.
"Hawaii's not really a strong
team for us to compete against,"

said head coach Richard Quick.
"In this meet we'll probably
have each of them swim one of
their stronger events in addition to
an off-event," Quick said of his
plans for the Cardinal lineup.
"Basically I'll be looking for tech
nique during the races — good
starts, good turns and good head
to-head races if one develops. We
don't have excellent speed now,
but I think we can make that up
with the endurance we've been
working on."
Loveless, top-ranked in the 100

back, looks for a low-key start to
the season. "This meet is only the
beginning of the season, so I'll be
looking to swim strong races that
are well-split," she said. "And as
the season progresses I'll improve
my times.
"But the Hawaii meet is impor
tant to us because it's the first
time we'll be competing against
them. We kind of want to develop a
good relationship with them, so we
can maybe negotiate to train in
Hawaii during the more intense
winter period. It probably won't

happen this year, but maybe next
year."
Stanford diving is also top
ranked. However, today they will
be without the services of junior
Eileen Richetelli, the NCAA Diver
of the Year.
Last year Richetelli captured
the NCAA title in the three-meter
and platform events, but this year
she was out for six weeks with a
third-degree sprain on her left
ankle. Richetelli started training
again yesterday and will be r?ady
to compete later in the season.
