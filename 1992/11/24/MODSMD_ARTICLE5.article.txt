# Nationwide search for library director begins
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Stanford's library system began search
ing for a new director this month, reaping
one of the first dividends from University
President Gerhard Casper's major stream
lining of the school's top administration.
In an effort to bolster Stanford's belea
guered library system — which has been
jolted by budget cuts that will slice about a
quarter of its funds by next fall — the re
structuring reinstated the position of li
brary director, which was eliminated in
1990. The director is responsible for Stan
ford's overall book collection.
But the planned use of other savings
from the restructuring to bolster the li
braries remains uncertain.
Casper said in a press conference Sept. 1
— his first day as president — that he won
dered whether "we might not have gone too
far" in cutting the libraries' budget, and
promised when announcing the restruc
turing two weeks later to divert any addi

tional savings to the libraries.
In a recent interview, he said there is "a
strong possibility" that the restructuring
will eventually free up additional money
for the libraries — but it will be a few
months before officials will be able to de
termine the amount.
Initially, some officials' estimates of the
restructuring's savings were as high as $1
million. But now, many say the restructuring
may not provide any additional savings be
yond the funding of the library directorship.
"I am unaware of any additional savings
from the restructuring and would be sur
prised if there were any," said Frederick
Biedenweg, the libraries' assistant vice
provost.
The administrative restructuring was
announced in mid-September and was
Casper's first major action as president.
The shake-up eliminated several vice pres
ident positions and reshuffled others.
Biedenweg said Casper and Provost
Gerald Lieberman have so far
promised only enough funds to
cover the director's salary —
which will be at least $101,000 per
year — and the benefits, travel
budget and other expenses associ
ated with the position.
The library director will report
to Robert Street, vice provost and
dean of libraries and information
resources.
Further money for libraries
"will not materialize immediate
ly," Casper said, because the
restructuring is not complete.
Many of the positions that will be
eliminated or reshuffled are still
operating under the old format.
Vice President for Public Affairs
Bob Freelen, for example, will not
retire until Feb. 1. His position will
then be eliminated, and many of
the offices he had supervised will
transfer to Casper's top assistant,
Jean Fetter.
Regardless of how much the
restructuring eventually saves, it

has already accomplished its main
goal, according to Budget Director
Tim Warner.
While the early estimates of its
savings "were not terribly accu
rate," the restructuring has estab
lished "a more effective way to
meet the needs" of Stanford's var
ious offices, he said.
During the two years that Stan
ford has been without a library
director, many humanities profes
sors have said that too much atten
tion has been paid to developing
library technology, and too little to
developing a quality book collection.
When Casper announced the
reinstatement of the position, many
humanities professors were
pleased. "It sounds to me absolutely
wonderful," English Prof. Ron Reb
holz said at the time. "That is, after
all, the humanists' laboratory."
A nationwide search for the
new library director is already
underway. Advertisements have
appeared in the Chronicle of High
er Education and several other
publications this month, Bieden
weg said. The new director is
scheduled to begin work in
September 1993.
