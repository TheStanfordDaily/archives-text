# Nationwide search for library director begins
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Stanford's library system began search
ing for a new director this month, reaping
one of the first dividends from University
President Gerhard Casper's major stream
lining of the school's top administration.
In an effort to bolster Stanford's belea
guered library system — which has been
jolted by budget cuts that will slice about a
quarter of its funds by next fall — the re
structuring reinstated the position of li
brary director, which was eliminated in
1990. The director is responsible for Stan
ford's overall book collection.
But the planned use of other savings
from the restructuring to bolster the li
braries remains uncertain.
Casper said in a press conference Sept. 1
— his first day as president — that he won
dered whether "we might not have gone too
far" in cutting the libraries' budget, and
promised when announcing the restruc
turing two weeks later to divert any addi

tional savings to the libraries.
In a recent interview, he said there is "a
strong possibility" that the restructuring
will eventually free up additional money
for the libraries — but it will be a few
months before officials will be able to de
termine the amount.
Initially, some officials' estimates of the
restructuring's savings were as high as $1
million. But now, many say the restructuring
may not provide any additional savings be
yond the funding of the library directorship.
"I am unaware of any additional savings
from the restructuring and would be sur
prised if there were any," said Frederick
Biedenweg, the libraries' assistant vice
provost.
The administrative restructuring was
announced in mid-September and was
Casper's first major action as president.
The shake-up eliminated several vice pres
ident positions and reshuffled others.
