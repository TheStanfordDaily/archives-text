# Top Harvard law scholar to join Stanford faculty
## 
### Carly Berwick 
Kathleen Sullivan, the widely respected
Harvard constitutional and criminal law
scholar, has accepted a tenured position at
Stanford Law School beginning next fall.
"Prof. Sullivan is among the most re
spected constitutional law scholars in the
country and a phenomenal teacher," said
Law School Dean Paul Brest in an internal
memo last week. "We are very pleased she
has accepted our offer."
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther, himself a na
tionally renowned constitutional law ex
pert, said, "She is a splendid human being
and outstanding teacher, as she demon
strated here last spring."
Sullivan first came to Stanford in March
1989 to lead a faculty workshop. She said that
after that experience, she had the "epiphany
that if I ever had the chance I'd come back."
She returned last spring to teach while

on a leave of absence from Harvard. This
second visit "converted" her, she said. "I
fell in love with my students, my colleagues
and the place."
Gunther said Sullivan had received the
highest teaching ratings that he could recall
in the past 30 years. She is not simply an
outstanding scholar, but possibly the most
outstanding scholar in her field, he said.
Her trademark is her lucidity and clarity
in writing and teaching, he added. "She com
municates what she is trying to say more ef
fectively than anyone in the business."
University President Gerhard Casper,
also a constitutional law specialist, echoed
Gunther's sentiments.
"I am utterly delighted," he said. "I only
wish I could spend more time in the Law
School and have lots of interesting discus
sions with her."
Sullivan will arrive on campus
this summer, leaving Harvard Law
School after nine years of teaching
and three years as a student.
One advantage of Stanford's

Law School is its small size, Sulli
van said.
"Stanford is a more closely knit
community, without the factional
divisions that often tear Harvard
apart," she said.
Although some Harvard stu
dents have speculated that her
departure was caused by a hostile
environment toward women, she

said her decision was "not about
fleeing troubles at Harvard."
Instead, Sullivan said, it was
based on the attractions of Stan
ford, which include a faculty with
"the giants of constitutional law"
and a "paradisaical" environ
ment.
Sullivan holds bachelor's
degrees from both Cornell Univer

sity and Oxford University, where
she was a Marshall Scholar. She
graduated from Harvard Law
School in 1981.
Her appointment brings the
number of women faculty at Stan
ford Law School to nine, out of a
total of 45. Harvard Law has six
women on its faculty, excluding
Sullivan.
