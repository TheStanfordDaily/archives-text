# Top Harvard law scholar to join Stanford faculty

Kathleen Sullivan, the widely respected
Harvard constitutional and criminal law
scholar, has accepted a tenured position at
Stanford Law School beginning next fall.
"Prof. Sullivan is among the most re
spected constitutional law scholars in the
country and a phenomenal teacher," said
Law School Dean Paul Brest in an internal
memo last week. "We are very pleased she
has accepted our offer."
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther, himself a na
tionally renowned constitutional law ex
pert, said, "She is a splendid human being
and outstanding teacher, as she demon
strated here last spring."
Sullivan first came to Stanford in March
1989 to lead a faculty workshop. She said that
after that experience, she had the "epiphany
that if I ever had the chance I'd come back."
She returned last spring to teach while

on a leave of absence from Harvard. This
second visit "converted" her, she said. "I
fell in love with my students, my colleagues
and the place."
Gunther said Sullivan had received the
highest teaching ratings that he could recall
in the past 30 years. She is not simply an
outstanding scholar, but possibly the most
outstanding scholar in her field, he said.
Her trademark is her lucidity and clarity
in writing and teaching, he added. "She com
municates what she is trying to say more ef
fectively than anyone in the business."
University President Gerhard Casper,
also a constitutional law specialist, echoed
Gunther's sentiments.
"I am utterly delighted," he said. "I only
wish I could spend more time in the Law
School and have lots of interesting discus
sions with her."
