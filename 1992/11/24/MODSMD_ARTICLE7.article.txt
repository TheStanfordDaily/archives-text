# CIV 'guinea pigs'
## 'Myth' takes non-linear approach 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
Stanford's newest and
smallest CIV track, "Myth and
Modernity," is taking an exper
imental approach to the study
of literature.
"They told us straight out
that we were going to be guinea
pigs," said freshman Conroy
Sullivan. The course, in its first
year, is one of nine Cultures,
Ideas and Values tracks new
students could choose from be
fore coming to campus this fall.
Sponsored by the German
Studies Department, Myth and
Modernity currently has 57 stu
dents and three sections.
The track is unique because it
bases readings on conceptual

connections centered around a
theme, said German Studies
Prof. Ted Andersson. Tradition
ally, CIV tracks have taken a
chronological approach, he said.
"I think the structure's
cool," Sullivan said. "I like the
fact that [the course] is not lin
ear in time and that it's grouped
around themes," he said. "But I
think that perhaps we should
write more papers."
Students in the track are re
quired to write two papers and
take a final exam.
Freshman Dave Conti also
said he enjoys Myth and Moder
nity. The students are now
studying the legend of Don
Juan from different sources, he
said.
"I like the fact that we're seeing
the opera Don Giovanni and read
ing about Don Juan's life," he said.
"We read Moliere's play and
Byron's book" on the life of the
famous lover, Conti said.
German Studies Teaching Fel
low Lutz Koepnick said the inno
vative structure has been "very
fruitful."
"I like [Myth and Modernity) a
lot more than I think a lot of other
students like their CIVs," said

freshman Tarlan Hedayati.
According to Andersson, plan
ners of the new track divided the
course into three quarter-long seg
ments: literature, logos (Greek for
logic) and language.
Professors subdivided each quar
terly topic into themes to give stu
dents a more specific focus, Anders
son said.
Myth and Modernity consists of
one hour-long lecture and two
two-hour sections per week.
Myth and Modernity was one of
four new CIV tracks proposed last
year. The other recommended
courses are not being taught this
year because "we were the only ones
that were ready," said Andersson.
