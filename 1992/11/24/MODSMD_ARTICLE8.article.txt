## Profs, actor try to define movie's portrayal of 'X'

How can you distinguish Malcolm X from
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Political
Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice and Hoover Fellow
Thomas Sowell?
"Neo-conservatism with an attitude," said
Tommy Lott, a professor of philosophy at San Jose
State who spoke at a panel discussion of Spike Lee's
latest film, "Malcolm X," in Donner lounge last night.
As one of four panelists moderated by Visiting
Drama Prof. Victor Walker, Lott compared the well
known conservatives with the outspoken African-
American leader as a way to answer his own ques
tion: What made Malcolm X so radical in the '60s yet
so acceptable today?
According to Lott, Malcolm X exhibited many of
the same values that characterize conservatives
today. He was a capitalist who believed blacks
should pull themselves up by their own bootstraps
and who strictly followed the family values he es
poused, Lott said.
Yet Malcolm, who Lott described as one of the
smaller figures in a long tradition of African-Amer
ican nationalists, gained national attention for his
critique of American racism in the '60s.
Lott attributed Malcolm X's fame more to the in
accuracy with which the mass media portrayed
black nationalism than his "separate-but-equal"

message, an ideology that had been
expressed by black activists since
the 19th century.
"Where were the women?"
asked Assoc. Dean of the Law
School Sally Dixon.
Dixon said Lee focused on nega
tive images in the women he chose
to portray — playing up weaker
women in Malcolm's life and casting
a negative light even on those char
acters that were strong in real life.

Although Malcolm expressed
misogynist views most of his life,
in 1964, he said a nation's progress
can never be separated from the
progress of its women.
After Malcolm died, his wife
obtained a Ph.D. with honors at
Amherst College and all six of their
daughters — whom she raised
alone after Malcolm's death —
obtained bachelor's degrees.
"It would have been nice to see
more of these strong, talented
women on the screen," she said.
Pat Turner, professor of African
and Afro-American Studies at UC-
Davis, agreed with Dixon's analysis

of the portrayal of women in the
movie, saying there were patterns to
what Lee omitted from the film.
As an example, Turner pointed
out that Malcolm's father was
depicted as a "near-saint" although
most evidence points to the con
trary.
Turner suggested that Lee tried
to make the movie "by any means
necessary," selling himself as a
"bad-boy director" to stir up con
troversy and tempering Malcolm
X's character in order to reach a
broader audience.
But Roger Smith, who played
Rudy in "Malcolm X," sees Lee's

exploitation of the media as a
means to push for positive change
in other areas. Lee requested that
magazines asking for interviews
send black reporters, which led
many magazines that previously
had no black writers on payroll to
hire one, according to Smith.
Smith also pointed out a contin
uing bias in the media when it
comes to black issues. After the
"Malcolm X" was released, a Los
Angeles news station devoted one
minute to positive reaction to the
movie and three minutes inter
viewing police on the possibility of
violent reaction to the film, he said.
