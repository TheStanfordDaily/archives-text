## Profs, actor try to define movie's portrayal of 'X'

How can you distinguish Malcolm X from
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Political
Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice and Hoover Fellow
Thomas Sowell?
"Neo-conservatism with an attitude," said
Tommy Lott, a professor of philosophy at San Jose
State who spoke at a panel discussion of Spike Lee's
latest film, "Malcolm X," in Donner lounge last night.
As one of four panelists moderated by Visiting
Drama Prof. Victor Walker, Lott compared the well
known conservatives with the outspoken African-
American leader as a way to answer his own ques
tion: What made Malcolm X so radical in the '60s yet
so acceptable today?
According to Lott, Malcolm X exhibited many of
the same values that characterize conservatives
today. He was a capitalist who believed blacks
should pull themselves up by their own bootstraps
and who strictly followed the family values he es
poused, Lott said.
Yet Malcolm, who Lott described as one of the
smaller figures in a long tradition of African-Amer
ican nationalists, gained national attention for his
critique of American racism in the '60s.
Lott attributed Malcolm X's fame more to the in
accuracy with which the mass media portrayed
black nationalism than his "separate-but-equal"
