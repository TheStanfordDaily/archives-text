# Putting theory into practice
## Business School students plan low-cost East Palo Alto housing project 
### Lubna Qureishi 
Taking their business sense out of the
classroom and onto the streets, five Stanford
Business School students spent last spring
quarter planning affordable housing for East
Palo Alto. But this was no classroom exercise
— their plan now actually stands a chance of
being implemented.
The students — Steve Sachs, Lara Wash
ington and Jon Zeitlin, along with Artie Har
ris and Eric Weaver, who graduated in June
— originally devised an affordable housing
plan with the intention of entering it in a
Bank of America competition.
But they "wanted to make it a real project
that would actually help instead of just win a
competition," said Washington, who thought
it was "ridiculous" to design a housing plan
without the intention of implementing it.
So with the help of William Lazier, a lec
turer in business administration, they devised
a feasible plan that won them an honorable
mention prize of $1,000 from the Saturn Cor
poration in a competition for outstanding
teamwork in local community service.
After receiving the award, the students
teamed up with the Mid-Peninsula Housing
Coalition — a nonprofit organization that
plans and manages subsidized housing units
— and used their winnings to find and devel
op a site for their plan's multi-family units.
After finding the site, they decided they

wanted it to include a central community cen
ter that would house a day care center, a
meeting place and a computer center. "We
wanted to make it different from the others
(community centers)," Washington said.
The students did feasibility studies of
financing, marketing and planning, won loan
approvals from Wells Fargo Bank, applied for
government tax-credit subsidies and put
together proposals for Mid-Peninsula.
Eventually, the students proposed the
"Beech Street Affordable Housing Project" —
an $8 million, 62-unit family housing complex.
Rents in the two-stoiy complex would have
ranged from $399 for a one-bedroom apart
ment to $785 for a three-bedroom apartment.
Beech Street seemed to be sailing smooth
ly and even won support from the East Palo
Alto City Council. But the plan encountered a
major stumbling block when Mid-Peninsula
performed an environmental study that
showed pesticide residues on part of the pro
posed site. The toxins posed a high risk to the
financing sources of the project.
"IThe project] will be put on hold until the
city of East Palo Alto gives directions on what
they want to see on the site," Matthew
Schwartz, a Mid-Peninsula manager said.
Although the project will probably be
scaled down, Schwartz thinks the chances are
better than 50-50 that something will be done
in the next five years, although he is not sure
if Mid-Peninsula will be its developer.

"There's probably not going to be a com
puter center in the development because it
will be scaled down," said Sachs. The stu
dents will try, however, to get companies to
donate computer equipment.
And the students say the entire project has
been an educational experience — one they
couldn't receive in a lecture hall.
"We weren't in a classroom talking about
past theories," Sachs said. "We saw how public
policy works, mobilized the community, and
tried to convince people opposed to the plan."
And Schwartz said the project did face
opposition in East Palo Alto. "It was difficult
to allay the fears and tough stereotypes of a
low-income area," he said. "Suspicions of the
team were heightened because of perceived
racial differences."
Although the team had two black mem
bers, the East Palo Alto community members
viewed the team as "the white establishment"
moving in.
"In East Palo Alto, the issues were not
only economic but also racial and ethnic,"
Schwartz said.
Both Washington and Zeitlin feel they
learned practical applications for their busi
ness skills through the project.
"We can use business skills to promote
social changes, not just for the private sec
tor," Washington said. "The finance and
negotiation skills are not just for the corpo
rate world."
