# From honors thesis to paperback
## Grad publishes book on assassination of Malcolm X 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
When "Inside Edition" came to Stan
ford to interview Mike Friedly, the show
expected the author of "Malcolm X: The
Assassination" to be a distinguished grey
haired professor.
Instead they found the real Mike Fried
ly, a 22-year-old with a boyish grin who
turned his honors thesis into a book about
one of the hottest intellectual topics of the
times — the life of Malcolm X.
Friedly said the interviewer was a little
"stunned" by his youth and called him
"Mikey" throughout the production.
Describing what he calls the "three
strikes" against his book, Friedly said,
"I'm not black and I'm not old enough for
people to listen to what I say and I'm on
the West Coast, which is away from New
York and all the Malcolm X research."
But Friedly, who graduated in June
with two bachelor's degrees, one in history
and the other in political science, didn't set
out to write a book. Instead, he said, he was
just planning to work with History Prof.
Clay Carson to write an honors thesis.
Friedly said he first became interested
in Malcolm X's life during his junior year,
when he assisted Carson in the research
for the professor's book "Malcolm X: The
FBI Files." Working with Carson added
depth to his major focus in African-Amer
ican history, Friedly said.
"Clay and I started talking about doing
(a thesis] on Malcolm because there hasn't
been much research done on his life,"
Friedly said. "Malcolm hasn't been very
well-received in academic circles."
For his thesis, he wanted to focus on
one of the areas of Malcolm X's life that
hadn't already been investigated, Friedly
added.
Malcolm X, born in 1925, is best known
as a black nationalist and critic of American
society. While serving a prison term, he was
introduced to the Nation of Islam and be
came a minister upon his release in 1952.

Mike Friedly, who graduated in June, had his honors thesis on Malcom X
turned into a book. Recently released, the book details Malcom's ties to the
Nation of Islam and the disintegration of that relationship.
