# From honors thesis to paperback
## Grad publishes book on assassination of Malcolm X 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
When "Inside Edition" came to Stan
ford to interview Mike Friedly, the show
expected the author of "Malcolm X: The
Assassination" to be a distinguished grey
haired professor.
Instead they found the real Mike Fried
ly, a 22-year-old with a boyish grin who
turned his honors thesis into a book about
one of the hottest intellectual topics of the
times — the life of Malcolm X.
Friedly said the interviewer was a little
"stunned" by his youth and called him
"Mikey" throughout the production.
Describing what he calls the "three
strikes" against his book, Friedly said,
"I'm not black and I'm not old enough for
people to listen to what I say and I'm on
the West Coast, which is away from New
York and all the Malcolm X research."
But Friedly, who graduated in June
with two bachelor's degrees, one in history
and the other in political science, didn't set
out to write a book. Instead, he said, he was
just planning to work with History Prof.
Clay Carson to write an honors thesis.
Friedly said he first became interested
in Malcolm X's life during his junior year,
when he assisted Carson in the research
for the professor's book "Malcolm X: The
FBI Files." Working with Carson added
depth to his major focus in African-Amer
ican history, Friedly said.
"Clay and I started talking about doing
(a thesis] on Malcolm because there hasn't
been much research done on his life,"
Friedly said. "Malcolm hasn't been very
well-received in academic circles."
For his thesis, he wanted to focus on
one of the areas of Malcolm X's life that
hadn't already been investigated, Friedly
added.
Malcolm X, born in 1925, is best known
as a black nationalist and critic of American
society. While serving a prison term, he was
introduced to the Nation of Islam and be
came a minister upon his release in 1952.

Mike Friedly, who graduated in June, had his honors thesis on Malcom X
turned into a book. Recently released, the book details Malcom's ties to the
Nation of Islam and the disintegration of that relationship.
Adopting the name El-Hajj
Malik El-Shabazz, he quickly
became prominent in the move
ment. But he was suspended by
Elijah Muhammad, the move
ment's founder, and in 1963 he
formed a rival organization of his
own. He urged black power and
racial separation.
After a pilgrimage to Mecca, he
announced his conversion to
orthodox Islam, moderated his
views, urged racial unity and
founded the Organization for
Afro-American Unity in 1964.
He was assassinated at a 1965

rally in Harlem at age 39, alleged
ly by Nation of Islam followers.
Although the title of the book
is "Malcolm X: The Assassina
tion," Friedly points out that it
actually examines the man's rela
tionship to the Nation of Islam
and the disintegration of that
relationship.
"I don't think this is the most
aptly titled book, but I had to veto
every other title [the publishers]
gave me because they were all so
horrible," he said.
But in contrast to other
authors' efforts to get their books
published, Friedly had a relatively
easy time with his publishers,
Carroll & Graf, Inc.
"This was kind of a fluke. fThe
publishing contract] just kind of

fell in my lap," said Friedly,
adding that he didn't even know
the book had been submitted to
the publishing company.
"Clay never asked me if he
could give [the thesis] to his pub
lisher, but I've since forgiven him
for that," Friedly said. "Ordinari
ly it's not easy to get published."
And Friedly, who is currently
working in Stanford's Office of
Government Relations, is already
under contract for a second book
— a look at Martin Luther King,
Jr. and the civil rights legend's
relationship with the FBI.
The publishing of the first book
was especially timely since Spike
Lee's film "Malcolm X" has spurred
increased interest and argument
about this historical figure. But

Friedly said he was not thrilled with
the content of the movie.
"The movie was good overall. It
wasn't great. It wasn't an epic,"
Friedly said. "Spike Lee was try
ing to replicate 'The Autobiogra
phy of Malcolm X,' but that's
something you just can't do."
Despite his successes, Friedly
still acts like any other student
who's just finished a big paper.
"It's good to see the final product,
that all my work amounted to
something," he said. "The worst
part was the long hours.
"The research needed to be
done. I was glad to see I could
have a small part in it and that I
can make a positive contribution
to the dialogue about Malcolm X,"
he added modestly.

For his thesis, he wanted to focus on
one of the areas of Malcolm X's life that
hadn't already been investigated, Friedly
added.
Malcolm X, born in 1925, is best known
as a black nationalist and critic of American
society. While serving a prison term, he was
introduced to the Nation of Islam and be
came a minister upon his release in 1952.

Mike Friedly, who graduated in June, had his honors thesis on Malcom X
turned into a book. Recently released, the book details Malcom's ties to the
Nation of Islam and the disintegration of that relationship.
Adopting the name El-Hajj
Malik El-Shabazz, he quickly
became prominent in the move
ment. But he was suspended by
Elijah Muhammad, the move
ment's founder, and in 1963 he
formed a rival organization of his
own. He urged black power and
racial separation.
After a pilgrimage to Mecca, he
announced his conversion to
orthodox Islam, moderated his
views, urged racial unity and
founded the Organization for
Afro-American Unity in 1964.
He was assassinated at a 1965

rally in Harlem at age 39, alleged
ly by Nation of Islam followers.
Although the title of the book
is "Malcolm X: The Assassina
tion," Friedly points out that it
actually examines the man's rela
tionship to the Nation of Islam
and the disintegration of that
relationship.
"I don't think this is the most
aptly titled book, but I had to veto
every other title [the publishers]
gave me because they were all so
horrible," he said.
But in contrast to other
authors' efforts to get their books
published, Friedly had a relatively
easy time with his publishers,
Carroll & Graf, Inc.
"This was kind of a fluke. fThe
publishing contract] just kind of

fell in my lap," said Friedly,
adding that he didn't even know
the book had been submitted to
the publishing company.
"Clay never asked me if he
could give [the thesis] to his pub
lisher, but I've since forgiven him
for that," Friedly said. "Ordinari
ly it's not easy to get published."
And Friedly, who is currently
working in Stanford's Office of
Government Relations, is already
under contract for a second book
— a look at Martin Luther King,
Jr. and the civil rights legend's
relationship with the FBI.
The publishing of the first book
was especially timely since Spike
Lee's film "Malcolm X" has spurred
increased interest and argument
about this historical figure. But

Friedly said he was not thrilled with
the content of the movie.
"The movie was good overall. It
wasn't great. It wasn't an epic,"
Friedly said. "Spike Lee was try
ing to replicate 'The Autobiogra
phy of Malcolm X,' but that's
something you just can't do."
Despite his successes, Friedly
still acts like any other student
who's just finished a big paper.
"It's good to see the final product,
that all my work amounted to
something," he said. "The worst
part was the long hours.
"The research needed to be
done. I was glad to see I could
have a small part in it and that I
can make a positive contribution
to the dialogue about Malcolm X,"
he added modestly.
When "Inside Edition" came to Stan
ford to interview Mike Friedly, the show
expected the author of "Malcolm X: The
Assassination" to be a distinguished grey
haired professor.
Instead they found the real Mike Fried
ly, a 22-year-old with a boyish grin who
turned his honors thesis into a book about
one of the hottest intellectual topics of the
times — the life of Malcolm X.
Friedly said the interviewer was a little
"stunned" by his youth and called him
"Mikey" throughout the production.
Describing what he calls the "three
strikes" against his book, Friedly said,
"I'm not black and I'm not old enough for
people to listen to what I say and I'm on
the West Coast, which is away from New
York and all the Malcolm X research."
But Friedly, who graduated in June
with two bachelor's degrees, one in history
and the other in political science, didn't set
out to write a book. Instead, he said, he was
just planning to work with History Prof.
Clay Carson to write an honors thesis.
Friedly said he first became interested
in Malcolm X's life during his junior year,
when he assisted Carson in the research
for the professor's book "Malcolm X: The
FBI Files." Working with Carson added
depth to his major focus in African-Amer
ican history, Friedly said.
"Clay and I started talking about doing
(a thesis] on Malcolm because there hasn't
been much research done on his life,"
Friedly said. "Malcolm hasn't been very
well-received in academic circles."
For his thesis, he wanted to focus on
one of the areas of Malcolm X's life that
hadn't already been investigated, Friedly
