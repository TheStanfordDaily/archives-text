# Licensing genes and a sex game
## Office helps researchers patent and market inventions

At first glance, there seem to be
little common ground shared by
gene-splicing technology, a device
that prevents books from falling
off library shelves during an
earthquake and the sexual educa
tion game "Sexploration."
But all three of these things are
among the hundreds of inventions
developed by Stanford students,
faculty and staff over the past 22
years that have become there

sponsibility of Stanford's Office of
Technology Licensing.
The office guides inventions by
Stanford-afTiliated people through
the patent and licensing process
and distributes any income result
ing from commercial use, accord
ing to Kathy Ku, director of the Li
censing Office.
According to the office's year
end fiscal report, more than $25
million was generated through
royalties and licensing fees in fis
cal 1992, a sharp increase from

last year's $14 million.
The most profitable technology
is the licensing of gene-splicing
techniques pioneered at Stanford
and UC-San Francisco in the mid
-19705. Income from this and other
biotechnologies amounted to
$14.7 million in 1992, according to
the report.
The office also handles such di
verse applications as the "Seismo
guard," which keeps books from
