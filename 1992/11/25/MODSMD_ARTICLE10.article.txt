# Licensing genes and a sex game
## Office helps researchers patent and market inventions 
### John Borland 
At first glance, there seem to be
little common ground shared by
gene-splicing technology, a device
that prevents books from falling
off library shelves during an
earthquake and the sexual educa
tion game "Sexploration."
But all three of these things are
among the hundreds of inventions
developed by Stanford students,
faculty and staff over the past 22
years that have become there

sponsibility of Stanford's Office of
Technology Licensing.
The office guides inventions by
Stanford-afTiliated people through
the patent and licensing process
and distributes any income result
ing from commercial use, accord
ing to Kathy Ku, director of the Li
censing Office.
According to the office's year
end fiscal report, more than $25
million was generated through
royalties and licensing fees in fis
cal 1992, a sharp increase from

last year's $14 million.
The most profitable technology
is the licensing of gene-splicing
techniques pioneered at Stanford
and UC-San Francisco in the mid
-19705. Income from this and other
biotechnologies amounted to
$14.7 million in 1992, according to
the report.
The office also handles such di
verse applications as the "Seismo
guard," which keeps books from
falling off library shelves during a
temblor, and "Sexploration," a
board game designed to encourage
informed decisions about sex and
personal values.
University policy allows the
rights to an invention to stay with
the inventor unless otherwise stat
ed in a research contract, accord
ing to Ku. However, the rights to
most externally funded research
are assigned to Stanford, she said.
Income from final commercial
development is returned to the
office in the form of licensing fees
and royalties, Ku said. After a 15
percent deduction to cover costs,
this remainder is then distributed
in shares of one-third to the inven
tor, the inventor's department and
the school in which the depart
ment is located.
None of the money from royal
ties or licensing is fed directly into

the University's general fund, Ku
said.
The University of California
system, among other schools in
the country, is considering the
establishment of a for-profit com
pany that will help to actively
develop its research for commer
cial application.
Ku said Stanford has no such
plans.
Licensing of university research
has received some attention in
regard to its potential for conflict of
interest, said Ku. "We've never had
any problem," she said. "But we
always worry that there might be
one."
The University and the licensing
office maintain strict standards reg
ulating the relationships between
researchers and private sector com
panies, particularly start-up enter
prises, Ku said. These regulations
attempt to forestall the possibility of
faculty dedicating more time to per
sonal financial interests than to
teaching and research activities, she
said.
