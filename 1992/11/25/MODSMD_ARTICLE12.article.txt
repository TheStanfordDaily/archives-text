# Senior aids Jimmy Carter in supervising Guyana elections
## 
### Solveig Pederson 
Just weeks after helping former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter hold together the
country of Guyana, senior Kai Kaiser was
driving down El Camino on his way to
Price Club to buy a few kegs for Haus
Mitt's Oktoberfest celebration.
"That was the ultimate culture shock,"
said Kaiser, who was part of a Carter Cen
ter mission to oversee and observe the
South American country's first democrat
ic election in 28 years.
Kaiser's team worked mainly in the
interior of Guyana, in the villages of the
Amerindians. Local officials ran the actu

al Oct. 5 election, but one of Kaiser's jobs
was to see that everything went smoothly.
For example, the local Guyanese elec
tion organizers needed official forms to
write down the names of the voters, and
often they would come to Kaiser and ask,
"We're out of forms, what do we do now?"
The entire election process at that
polling place would stop and everyone
would sit and watch Kaiser actually draw
lines on a piece of paper to make an offi
cial form for them.
"It was just hilarious," recalled Kaiser.
Kaiser also found the voter registra
tion process in the country quite different
from America's. In the stilt-house villages

where he was working, residents had to be
identified by the captain of the village and
they had to swear to their identity in
order to be placed on the voter list.
"For many hours on end I heard this
pledge over and over again: 'I hereby
swear. .There was a little red Bible
going around," said Kaiser.
On election day, the team did a quick
count of the ballots after the polls closed.
These unofficial results were radioed to
Jimmy Carter in the capital, Georgetown,
so he would have advance knowledge of
the election's outcome.
"This quick count was actually kept
secret; it was for the use of Jimmy Carter;
he actually used the results when he nego
tiated the power transition," stated
Kaiser.
Racial and political tensions undercut
the election between the Afro-Guyanese
incumbent Desmond Hoyte — whose
party has held an essential dictatorship
for the last 28 years — and Cheddi Jagan,
an Indian who ironically was kicked out of
the government 28 years ago by the
British for being a Marxist.
Kaiser said that without the negotia
tions and presence of Carter, the country
would have "blown up."
"There were riots on the day of the
election, Oct. 5, and for several days fol
lowing," said Kaiser.
Kaiser first became interested in moni
toring the elections while doing research
in Guyana during the summer, when he
found out that a Carter Center team
would be coming down to supervise and
organize the elections. Carter had origi
nally visited in October 1990 and begun
the process of reintroducing democracy to
the country, and decided a team would
follow through by being present at the
elections.
"I faxed the Carter Center a request to

be part of the mission and wrote a little bit
about what I thought the political situa
tion was in Guyana," said Kaiser.
The Carter Center, based in Atlanta,
was founded as a consortium of non-prof
it organizations working to alleviate con
flict, reduce suffering and promote better
understanding among people. Past efforts
have included such activities as building
houses as part of the Habitat for Human
ity project.
After flying back to New York at the
end of the summer, Kaiser drove back to
Stanford with a friend. "I found out by
phone from a gas station in Indiana that I
had been selected as a member of the
team," he said.
Because he's program director for
Haus Mitt, Kaiser drove on to Stanford
and stayed for a week before classes start
ed to help plan programs. But on the sec
ond day of classes, Kaiser was back on a
plane to Georgetown.
"Being able to leave the country and
return again so quickly gave my research
an interesting perspective," reflected
Kaiser.
For the few days before the election,
team members were briefed by the heads
of the mission, Carter and Prime Minister
of Belize George Price, about what to look
for while observing the elections and how
to do the quick count, among other topics.
Kaiser got a chance to talk to Jimmy
Carter a few times, who also dined with
the team.
"It's weird sitting next to the guy,
though," he said.
Kaiser is now busy catching up on the
work he missed, since he returned in the
middle of midterms. But, the inconve
nience seems to have been worth it.
"It was just amazing to be there, to
actually see it happen. It was a real learn
ing experience."
