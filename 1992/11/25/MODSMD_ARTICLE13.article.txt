Snow storm batters Rockies, Plains
(AP) — A powerful snow storm blew out of the
Rockies and pummeled the Southern Plains yes
terday, closing hundreds of miles of highways,
while Southern tornado victims working in heavy
rain faced a grim Thanksgiving.
In Amarillo, Texas, 200 vehicles were involved
in an early-morning pileup on snow-covered Inter
state 40, with no reports of deaths, police said.
Since Saturday, violent weather accounted for
the deaths of 25 people in the South and Midwest.
In the Oklahoma Panhandle, the National
Weather Service warned motorists of the "life
threatening situation if your car or truck becomes
stranded" because of the combination of drifting
snow and sub-zero wind chill readings.
"It's kind of hard to tell just how much snow we
have had, the wind is blowing so hard," said Sheriff
Arnold Peoples of Texas County, Okla. "I would ven
ture to say we've had five to six inches. We have lots
of vehicles off in ditches. We're working the high
ways, trying to get everybody up and into town."
Near-blizzard conditions were expected to
spread eastward as the storm moved out of the
Panhandle, forecasters said.
In the South, state and federal damage assess
ment teams fanned out through the region to help

determine whether federal assistance will be
available.
Another storm system pounded the region. Tor
nado-force winds early yesterday destroyed at least
one trailer home in Baldwin County on Alabama's
Gulf Coast and downed power lines and trees.
No ii\juries were reported in either Alabama or
Georgia.
Corsicans bomb for independence
AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) — Corsican
separatists bombed a courthouse in this southern
French city and set off explosives that leveled a
vacation colony in Corsica, police said yesterday.
The National Front for the Liberation of Corsi
ca (FLNC) claimed responsibility for five overnight
attacks, and police suspected Corsican separatists
were behind two others. No one was injured.
The blasts follow the arrests of about a dozen Cor
sican nationalists over the past few weeks by special
anti-terrorist police sent to the Mediterranean island
to curb a widening bombing campaign.
The FLNC and other Corsican nationalists
almost never kill people, but they regularly bomb
public buildings and tourist complexes on the
island and in southern France in a campaign to win
independence.
