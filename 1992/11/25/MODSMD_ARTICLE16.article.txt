# U.N. upholds Iraqi embargo
## Officials say the country hasn't met cease-fire terms 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The United Nations Security
Council yesterday unanimously
rejected Baghdad's claim that it
has met the terms of the Gulf War
cease-fire and kept an economic
embargo clamped on Iraq.
"The conditions do not exist to
modify the sanctions," Council
President Andre Erdos told
reporters after closed consulta
tions yesterday afternoon.
No vote was taken in the consul
tations, which followed two days of
speeches by Iraq's top diplomat,
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz,
council members and U.N. officials.
Erdos, the U.N. ambassador
from Hungary, said the 15 council
members "didn't feel (Aziz) indi
cated whether Iraq wants to go
ahead and how it would cooperate
with the council."
A written statement issued later
by Erdos said he concluded that
"there was no agreement that the
necessary conditions existed for a
modification" of the sanctions.

During the debates, Aziz insist
ed Iraq had complied with all cru
cial U.N. demands and demanded
the lifting of the embargo, which
prohibits all Iraqi trade with the
world except for food, medicine and
emergency humanitarian supplies.
But Aziz told reporters after
yesterday's debate, "We know
there was a prejudgement by a
number of influential members of
the council not to ease the sanc
tions, not to focus on the real
progress that has taken place."
Aziz did not name countries,
but he was obviously referring to
the United States, Britain and
France.
In speeches both Monday and
yesterday, Aziz accused Western
ambassadors on the council of
hypocrisy, described U.N. weapons
inspectors as provocateurs and
insisted that Iraq was fully cooper
ative and innocent of any wrong
doing.
In an unusually harsh state
ment read by Hungarian Ambas

sador Andre Erdos, the Security
Council said it "'regrets the base
less threats, allegations and
attacks launched by the deputy
prime minister of Iraq."
Aziz said he hoped the new
administration of President-elect
Clinton would re-evaluate the U.S.
position on sanctions "in an objec
tive manner, not in a manner
influenced by personal or tempo
rary considerations," as Aziz felt
President Bush treated the issue.
Council members agreed Mon
day that Iraq has not complied
with the cease-fire that ended the
1991 gulf war, including full dis
closure of its arms programs.
Iraq says it has no incentive to
cooperate if the embargo remains
indefinitely.
President Bush and Prime Min
ister John Major of Britain have
said they would oppose lifting the
embargo as long as Saddam Hus
sein remains in power because
they consider him a destabilizing
force in the region.
