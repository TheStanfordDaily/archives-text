Law students work with
administration for a
resolution to conflict

EARLIER THIS YEAR, first
year law students discovered
that the law school planned
to significantly cut back on its loan
forgiveness program. Their dismay
was heightened by the fact that
Stanford had not announced this
decision while students were
deciding which law school to
attend. Under the loan forgiveness
program, graduates who work in
low-paying, public interest legal
jobs get a portion of their student
debt paid by the school.
After two months of activism by
law students at the law school, this
program has been restored. The
actions of the law students serve as
a good example of how students can
affect university policy.
Stanford Law School has a lot
going for it. It arguably has the
finest law faculty in the country. In
admissions selectivity, it is second
only to Yale. And for the past sever
al years, Stanford has established
itself as a leader in curriculum
development and administrative
support for public interest law
activities. So it was all the more
ironic that the loan forgiveness pro
gram was chosen to be cutback in
this time of fiscal woes.
In one sense, the administra
tion's actions were understandable:
The initial grant from Cummins
Engine Foundation that launched
the program was running out at the
same time the law school was told to
reduce its budget because of the uni
versity-wide indirect cost scandal.
On the other hand, the decision
may have been made because those
most interested in the program —
students — have little institutional
force. It is easier to cut back loan
forgiveness than, say, faculty
salaries because students are only
here for three years.
The students followed a policy of
"rational engagement" with the

administration, buttressing their
concerns with the facts of the pro
gram. After an initial meeting of
about 50 students, they developed
task forces to collect information
from various offices in the law
school and other law school's pro
grams, and interviewed alumni of
the program. A petition letter sent
to the student body was signed by
nearly half the student body and
turned into the Dean. Eventually
more than 100 students attended a
"town meeting" with Dean Paul
Brest to discuss their concerns and
debate the reasons offered for the
cutbacks.
The net result of these activities
was the administration's decision
to keep the original loan forgive
ness program for the class of 1995.
Students hope to garner a commit
ment by the administration to
maintain the program for future
years as well, so that their efforts
last longer than their stay in school.
The well-organized students and
receptive law school have both
proven that in a time of budget cut
ting, there needn't always be ill will
when a student service is threat
ened or cut. Satisfactory solutions
can, in fact, often be reached.
But if students do not make their
preferences clear and back up their
proposals with facts, their voices
will not be heard or taken seriously.
Students must also realize that cut
ting has to come somewhere, and
they would be wise to reserve their
loudest cries for the most impor
tant reasons — like saving the loan
forgiveness program.
The University, meanwhile,
should take the lead of the law school,
and carefully consider student's
needs before cutting a program.
This approach might lead them to
avoid making suspect decisions such
as cutting summer storage.
In a past editorial, we criticized
the lemming-like race to law school
of many college graduates. So we
have all the more reason to com
mend those law students who have
demonstrated that students can
make a difference when they set
their minds to it.
