Columbus Day, Thanksgiving and Groundhog's Day all offend

lAM WRITING IN response to
Eduardo Diaz's excellent letter which
pointed out that like Columbus Day,
Thanksgiving celebrates the beginning
of a brutal regime of European coloniza
tion and genocide.
While the pilgrims themselves sought
only religious freedom, we cannot ignore
the fact that destruction resulted from
their actions. To celebrate their adven
ture is to celebrate its devastating conse
quences for non-Europeans.
In a similar vein, I would like to point
out another holiday whose practice
should be discontinued: Christmas.
Jesus Christ was certainly an admirable
figure, but over the centuries since his
death, the Christian religion has caused
much suffering during the inquisition

and medieval crusades.
The parallel with Thanksgiving is
clear: We cannot celebrate an event —
whether the voyage of religious asylm
seekers or the birth of the Son of God —
which, however indirectly, led to terrible
consequences decades or centuries later.
Celebrating the historical event obvious
ly implies approval of any and all future
occurrences remotely linked to that
event. Just as celebrating Thanksgiving
must be a celebration of the destruction
of Native American culture, so must
Christ mas be a celebration of the Span
ish Inquisition.
We should also eliminate holidays
which celebrate destruction of foreign
societies, such as Veteran's Day. Viet
nam and Korean War veterans served in

American attempts to impose our own
societal paradigm upon Asia, much like
the European colonization and cultural
imperialism in the Americas.
Other holidays celebrate histories and
traditions which we now know to be
wrong; these should also be eliminated.
George Washington's birthday celebrates
the life of a slave owner who reveled in
telling the story of his days as a youthful
hooligan who chopped down a cherry
tree and showed no remorse, proudly
proclaiming "I did it" when questioned.
Former president and Revolutionary
War hero or not, a slave owner who
served the interests of the logging indus
try deserves no special place on our cal
endar.
Groundhog's Day celebrates human

exploitation of a small mammal for our
own selfish ends. Does the groundhog
exist only to be forced to entertain and
inform humans in a degrading annual
ritual? A celebration of Groundhog's Day
is celebration of human oppression of
other life forms and a denial of the digni
ty of our friend the groundhog.
I hope this letter has opened the eyes
of those who, for the sake of a few days
of festivities, help perpetuate false histo
ries of some examples of mankind at its
darkest. I invite all of Stanford to deny
such dishonest celebrations by joining
me on Nov. 26 in a day of bad food,
remorse and misery.
