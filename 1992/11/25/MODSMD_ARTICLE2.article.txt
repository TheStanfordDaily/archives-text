# Excerpts from "Malcolm X: The Assassination"
## 
### 
"He spent an entire year trying to outrun the
guns of his former allies, but he could not es
cape them any longer. The five Muslims who
killed Malcolm X had been primed for their
duty by continual verbal assaults on their
target over the past year."

"Elyah Muhammed, Minister Louis X,
and other members of the Muslim lead
ership were responsible for Malcolm X's
death regardless of where they were on
the day of February 21, 1965. They set
the stage for the final killing. Then they

watched the drama unfold from the comfort
and safety of Chicago."
"Although Malcolm X desired to be a part of
the mainstream civil rights movement . . .
there is no evidence to believe that he would
have become a colleague of such people as
King, James Farmer, Whitney Young, and Roy
Wilkins. By nature, Malcolm X was an out
sider to the movement, a nationalist among in
tegrationists. His brash style and uncompro
mising attitude would never have allowed him
to agree fully with the integrationists."
