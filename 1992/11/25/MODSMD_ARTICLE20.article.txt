# Gaieties writers tell audience, Branner to 'lighten the hell up'
## 
### 
Over 100 people put thousands of
hours of work into "Achtung Weenie"
and it's becoming frightfully clear
that the thing people will remember
most about the show is the Branner
brouhaha during Friday night's per
formance.
We hope to clear up what now
appears to be a widespread misconcep
tion on the Stanford campus: Con
trary to popular belief, "Achtung Wee
nie" is a comedy. Comedies contain
jokes. And many lines of dialogue in
"Achtung Weenie" were intended to
be jokes.
The script of "Achtung Weenie"
calls for an actor portraying Ted Kop
pel to announce in Act 2 that a Night
line poll "shows that 86 percent of
Stanford students think that Branner

sucks. . .and 14 percent are undecid
ed." The joke was clear enough in the
Thursday night and Friday afternoon
shows, but Branner's refusal to calm
down Friday night forced the actor to
abandon his part before he could
reveal the punchline.
"Branner sucks" was intended to be a
joke. It appeared in a show that featured
Larry Bud Melman checking ID's at
Green, President Casper wearing a utili
ty belt, and Dean James Montoya doing
a song-and-dance number about "baking
some weenie pie."
It is unfortunate that certain groups
have decided to take one line of comedic
dialogue so seriously. The Branner reac
tion we witnessed during Friday night's
performance of "Achtung Weenie" was
the kind of gratuitous dorm spirit that
spawned the whole "Branner sucks" tra
dition in the first place. It is equally
uncalled for, however, that Branner
freshmen are being harassed purely as a
result of their chance assignment into a
particular dorm.
It's time to stop the madness. Light-

en the hell up.
