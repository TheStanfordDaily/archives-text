# Mandatory age for retirement controls high University costs
## 
### 
The Daily's condemnation of the
University's mandatory retirement age
fails to take one critical factor into con
sideration, the tenure system, and fails
to adequately consider the economic
costs of eliminating mandatory retire
ment.
Tenure and the lifting of the age cap
have given faculty members a level of enti
tlement that is not enjoyed by any other
class of employees in American society.
They can't be fired and they can't be

compelled to retire. Moreover, in a for
mal sense, faculty members are paid for
teaching classes even though other
activities — research, University admin
istration, student advising — take up
more time.
The temptation to stay on and simply
teach will inevitably mean there will be,
on average, fewer fully productive mem
bers of the faculty than there would oth
erwise have been. There will also be
fewer members of the faculty period,
because senior faculty cost about twice
as much as junior faculty.
As The Daily suggests, faculty mem
bers could be enticed to retire by offer
ing generous early retirement packages.
This only means that resources will be
transferred from the University to facul
ty members.
As a faculty member, I suppose that I
should not complain about this, but as a
scholar and teacher I do not believe that
this transfer is the best way to use the
University's limited resources.
