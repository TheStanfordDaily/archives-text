## Torn's romantic tips 
### 
I'VE RECOGNIZED ONE OF the first
signs that the freshmen are becoming
true Stanford students — they are
already complaining about the dating
scene here. Unable to wait for the Valen
tine's day edition of The Daily and unwill
ing to refer them to the "Guide to the
Good Life at Stanford" I've been forced to
address the issue here in my column.
My first conclusion, from three years
here, is that the people who constantly
complain about dating are the ones who
are too lame or too lazy to actually try it.
Contrary to popular myth, people do date
here, they have a good time and date again.
The first, and usually most deflating,
question I ask a chronic dating whiner is
"Well, have you called anyone to ask
them out?" The sheepish responses sig
nal some sort of belated, bewildered reve
lation that this is a necessary prerequi
site to dating. Now, maybe I have an
especially clear train of thought, but that
leap of logic seems relatively clear to me.
The most common response to this
demoralizing ego slam is the ever-popu
lar, "but there's no place to go around
here." Again, this trite cop-out does not
excuse a lack of effort and original
thought.
A date can be as mundane as Flicks,
renting a movie or taking in a women's
basketball game, or as creative as a picnic
in the Rodin Sculpture Garden or an opera
in the city. The point is to spend time with

someone, right? If you look for excuses not
to do something, you'll find them.
The apathy I've seen in many of my
guy friends made me arrive at the
inevitable conclusion that the women
were just going to have to take the initia
tive. When I brought up this alternative
in the dorm the men all seemed to think
it would be a great idea but the women
were definitely divided in their opinion.
In the small sample of women which I
queried, there was a strong contingent
that felt this was a bad idea.
The women who didn't feel it was
appropriate for them to ask a guy out said
that they didn't want to appear overly
aggressive and that they could simply
make it abundantly clear that they want
ed him to ask them out by flirting with
him. Working within this rigid frame
work, though, they seriously limit their
options if the flirting doesn't work.
From the male point of view I would
counter this working premise with two
simple statements of fact. First, the flirt
ing thing is often just not obvious to us.
Short of a grandstand play its entirely
possible that men simply don't recognize
the signals that are being sent. Don't
assume that the other party is getting all
of your hints.
Second, I have never met a guy who
thinks a woman is too aggressive if she
asks a guy out. In high school the Sadie
Hawkins dance was always an exciting

event for guys because of the suspense
involved. It's a welcome relief from the
traditional duty of asking the woman out.
Remember, just because it has been
the traditional male role doesn't make it
any easier for us to do. We actually like it
when the pressure's off. Also, just as
women are often flattered if they are
asked out, men feel even more so because
it happens so rarely.
We all knew that it was perpetuating
sex roles: the man did the calling, he
would pay for the date, etc. But while
everyone could identify with these defini
tions and most agreed that they were
archaic, it seemed that most people, men
and women, were not ready to break
them.
This isn't going to change unless peo
ple take some initiative. Ask someone you
like out on a date, even if it is just to
Flicks. Take a risk instead of remaining
bitter and watching "When Harry Met
Sally" to convince yourself all is not lost.
Stanford is not a dating wasteland — go
out and disprove the myth.
