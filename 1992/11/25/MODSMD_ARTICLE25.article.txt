## The
						KGB on campus 
### Ryan Golds berry 
On a visit to Stanford, Dr.
Noyzhes Bozis, an emigrant from
the former Soviet Union, appeared
deeply concerned when Applied
Physics Prof. Theodore Geballe
informed him about the KGB's
influence in Stanford University's
Physics Department. Then he
began to laugh.
To the international scientific
community, KGB stands for Kapit
ulnik, Geballe and Beasley — three
members of the world renowned
high temperature superconductivi
ty research team at the Applied
Physics Department at Stanford.
While the Soviet KGB was
known for maintaining secrecy,
Stanford's KGB believes that trad
ing information within the interna
tional physics community is an
invaluable part of advancing their
research.
The KGB has been working as a
team since 1985. Each member of
the team attacks the subject with a
different focus. Generally, Geballe,
a chemist, focuses on material
properties, while Malcolm Beasley
studies potential electrical and
electronic applications. Aharon
Kapitulnik, the last member to join
the group, said he concentrates on
"understanding fundamental prop
erties." Despite these different
approaches, Geballe says "there is
a big overlap" in their research.
Kapitulnik described a super
conductor as "a piece of material
that does not have any resistance
for conducting electricity."
Geballe said that society could
potentially stand to gain "motors,
generators and transmission lines
that are friendly to the ecology and
more efficient."
He also explained that supercon
ductors are used to make highly
sensitive instruments to test mate
rials. "We throw a lot of things
away because we don't know how
safe they are on one hand." On the
other hand, "There are things like
airplanes that we don't throw away
soon enough," he said.
Beasley, however, is concerned
about the unrealistic expectations
about superconductors created by
the media. "Whether these materi
als will revolutionize technology
won't be known for some time."

Beasely used magnetic reso
nance imaging technology as an
example how long the development
process can take. MRI scans allow
doctors to make images of the
brains of patients without the need
of a scalpel.
"These discoveries about mag
netic resonance were made when I
was an undergraduate. I did my
senior thesis winding the first
superconducting magnet in my
institution. Thirty years later, I've
had a MRI scan."
Widespread use of superconduc
tors will not occur for a while
because "we don't have materials
that are superconducting at room
temperature, only at temperatures
such as -150 degrees Celsius," said
Kapitulnik, who added that practi
cal room-temperature supercon
ductors would need to operate at
temperatures up to 350 degrees
Celsius.
The pace of research in high
temperature superconductors has
been greatly aided by improve
ments in international communi
cation. Kapitulnik, for example,
said he is "collaborating with some
one in France and we'll probably be

able to finish in just a week.
"In the past, it would have
taken a week for the mail to just
send things in each direction. Now,
the faxes are going back and forth
constantly and there's e-mail."
When asked if language is a bar
rier to this communication,
Geballe simply said, "English
works everywhere. English — well,
Pidgin English — is the universal
language."
He then added, "We all want to
pool our knowledge and learn as
much as we can. We all stand to
gain as we get more knowledge."
Electronics companies such as
TRW, Hewlett-Packard and West
inghouse have been making an
effort to stay abreast of the work
being done by the KGB. According
to Kapitulnik, "They try to associ
ate themselves with research
groups in order to know what is
going on."
Geballe summarized the focus
of the KGB's continued research:
"We want to see if we can increase
understanding on one hand and
that will lend itself to making use
ful devices for humanity on the
other."
