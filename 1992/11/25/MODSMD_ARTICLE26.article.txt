# Doctor pins down problems
## Training facility introduces acupuncture to athletes 
### Aaron Thode Editorial staff 
Dr. Jeffrey Saal sticks pins into
football players and gets away
with it. That is because Saal, a
physiatrist and new training
physician at the sports medicine
center, knows exactly where to
stick them.
For almost 15 years Saal has
been a practitioner of acupunc
ture, a 5,000 year-old Chinese
technique that involves sticking
pins into strategic locations
around the human body to relieve
pain and reduce inflammation.
Since the beginning of the
year, he has treated over a dozen
athletes with the ancient art,
among them football players
Steve Stenstrom and Mike Cook.
"I've been treating neck, mus
cle and lower back injuries," he
said. The technique also limbers
up and relaxes muscles, so "some
times I treat someone just 20
minutes before they go play a
football game."
"Acupuncture is being done
more and more in the United
States, but is still an uncommon
procedure," said Head Athletic
Trainer Standley Scott. The
training facility has just started
using the technique because Saal
is the first trainer certified in
acupuncture.
But everyone is being very cau
tious. "We embrace everything
and we try to check everything
out, but we also try to approach
everything with caution," Asst.
Head Athletic Trainer Jim
Liukkonen said.
As a medical student at Tulane
University in 1971, Saal "appren
ticed" himself to Dr. Howard Lee.
He learned that the Chinese
divide the human body into 12
"meridians," or energy pathways.
These pathways deliver energy to
all parts of the body. To treat an
injury, one uses needles to redi
rect the energy flow into the
injured part.
Saal said he became so con
fused over the concept of energy
that "I had to stop for a while,
because it became too bizarre for
me."
Then he realized that meridi
ans correspond roughly to the
nervous system. By imagining

meridians to be a type of electrical
circuit, he began to understand
the logic of the system.
"I try to conceptualize it as a
circuit diagram. Acupuncture
points are relays that redirect
'current' into certain areas."
To treat a back injury, for
example, one could use four pins.
One is inserted directly into the
sore spot, and the other three are
inserted at points along the
meridian that lead to the painful
spot: behind the knee and in the
spine.

'The beauty of acu
puncture is that you
are not adding any
thing to the system.
There are no side
effects.'
— Dr. Jeflery Saal

Stacey Misakian, a student
trainer for one and a half years,
has watched the process with fas
cination. She said she has seen
"anywhere from six to ten" nee
dles inserted into the backs,
shoulders and hands of football
players and cross-country run
ners.
In 1977 Saal attended the New
England School of Chinese
Medicine and Acupuncture while
also earning his physiatry degree.
"A physiatrist is a physician who
specializes in physical medicine
and rehabilitation," he explained.
A year later he received his certi
fication to administer acupunc
ture.
In 1980 he helped found Sports
Orthopedic and Rehabilitation,
one of the few medical practices
wherein orthopedic surgeons and
physiatrists work together. He
said he uses acupuncture there as
well.
"I found the parallel training
most valuable," he said. He has
come to realize that Eastern and
Western medicine "describe the
same thing from different per
spectives."

But, Saal said, the Eastern
methods are superior to the
West's in some ways. "The beauty
of acupuncture is that you are not
adding anything to the system.
There are no side effects.
"Western medicine solves
problems by adding or subtract
ing things." One adds a drug or
removes an organ.
Eastern medicine uses what is
there and 'tunes it up,' he said.
The Chinese even tried to treat
diseases with acupuncture, but
"Western medicine is better at
that," he said.
"But as far as treating regional
pain goes, acupuncture is as good
as or better than Western
medicine," he said.
But he and the head trainers at
the sports medicine facility
emphasize that acupuncture will
never be used in lieu of more con
ventional techniques like ultra
sound, fibroscopy and ice.
"I never use acupuncture as a
stand alone treatment," Saal said.
"It doesn't cure anything by itself
— it's just one tool in my tool
box."
Exactly why acupuncture
works remains somewhat of a
mystery to Western medicine.
Saal said that it stimulates the
release of high amounts of endor
phins, the body's natural pain
killers. "That's an established
fact," he said.
"I believe it works on multiple
levels," said Dr. Michael Frederic
son, another recent addition to
the training staff.
As a faculty member at the
Physical Medicine and Rehabilita
tion Clinic at the Medical Center,
Fredericson has been interested
in acupuncture "for a number of
years." He has been observing
Saal, and plans to receive his own
acupuncture certification from
UCLA in March.
"We may be reprogramming
the nerve impulses that transmit
pain. I also think biochemistry
must be involved, because the
inflammation around the injured
area is reduced," he said.
Misakian, whose mother and
brother have received acupunc
ture treatments, takes a practical
view of the technique.
"If some method works, more
power to it," she said.
