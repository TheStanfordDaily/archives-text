# How to stop TV from flickering? Stop interfering, suggests Bug

/"V When you see a computer monitor
Won television, why does it always
flicker like some under-fluided lighter?
— Burned and Max Headroom
A: I first observed the phenomenon
that perplexes you on an old "Lav
erne and Shirley" episode. The title char
acters were watching television, and from
my perspective their set seemed plagued
by a flickering horizontal bar that
scrolled down the screen two or three
times per second. I assumed that it was
merely the consequence of the old televi
sion they used in the scene.
It turns out, however, that any TV pic
ture of a television or computer monitor
will do the same thing.
Television screens and computer mon
itors work according to the same basic
principle. A beam of electrons is fired
through an evacuated glass box (called a
cathode ray tube, or CRD at a phospho
rescent screen, which glows when the
beam strikes it. To generate a picture, the

beam is swept in horizontal lines across
the screen, from top to bottom, until the
entire screen has been "painted."
This sweeping strategy is responsible
for the minuscule horizontal lines you can
see on a TV screen if you look more close
ly than would make your mother comfort
able.
It takes some reasonably constant
amount of time (about one twenty-fourth
of a second) to print out a whole screen.
The picture doesn't change much from
frame to frame, so you basically have a
periodic phenomenon. If you're watching
a TV picture of a computer monitor, you
have two interacting periodic phenomena
— television and computer monitor.
The concise but (for the moment)
incomprehensible answer to your ques
tion is that the period of the TV's oscilla
tion is different from that of the monitor.
To understand why this results in a visi
ble flickering of the picture of the moni
tor, we're going to have to digress for a
few paragraphs and discuss some qualita
tive aspects of oscillations, using sound as
a model.
Sound is a periodic compression of air.

A simple sound, like the dull tone of a
pitch pipe, or the equally dull tone of
many CIV lecturers, can be thought of as
a (Warning: Pre-calculus alert) sine wave.
At the crests of the waves, the air is most
compressed, and at the troughs, it is most
rarefied.
Like all sinusoidal functions, a simple
sound wave has a period (the amount of
time it takes to repeat, crest to crest) and
an inversely proportional frequency (the
number of times per second that the wave
repeats). The higher the frequency — i.e.,

the shorter the period — the higher the
pitch of the sound.
Now, to the meat of the matter: When
two simple sounds with different frequen
cies are played, you hear not two but three
pitches: the low frequency, fl, the high
frequency, f2, and a "beat" frequency
equal to the difference between f2 and fl.
The beat frequency is the result of espe
cially high crests (and troughs) that occur
when both of the main frequencies are
cresting (or troughing) at the same time;
this happens with a frequency P2-fl.
"Um.. .Chris. . .what does this have to
do with televisions?"
Patience, gentle readers. Remember
our observation that the scanning of the
CRT beam over a TV screen is a periodic
phenomenon. It's obviously not a pure,
monotone sine wave — although some
times Arsenio Hall makes me wonder —
but it has some of the same mathematical
properties.
When you take a CRT record of anoth
er CRT, it's the electronic equivalent of
playing two dissonant pitch pipes at the
same time. The flickering that you see in
such situations is the beat frequency

resulting from the difference between the
two screens' sweep frequencies.
To illustrate: Suppose you videotape
your personal computer and watch the
tape. If your Sony 21 inch fills in the
screen 25 times each second, while the
Mac Classic redraws its screen only 20
times in the same interval, you would see
the TV picture of the Mac's screen flicker
five times per second.
If you'd taped the Sony itself, the
sweep time of observed and observing
monitors would be the same, and the
flickering would not occur.
So now, this weekend, while you're
expressing your gratitude for the success
of American material culture by vegging
out in front of a television, your under
standing of what you see will be expanded
by some small factor.
Just one more little thing to be thank
ful for.

playing two dissonant pitch pipes at the

such situations is the beat frequency

To illustrate: Suppose you videotape
your personal computer and watch the

screen 25 times each second, while the
Mac Classic redraws its screen only 20
times in the same interval, you would see
the TV picture of the Mac's screen flicker

If you'd taped the Sony itself, the

/"V When you see a computer monitor
Won television, why does it always
flicker like some under-fluided lighter?
— Burned and Max Headroom
A: I first observed the phenomenon
that perplexes you on an old "Lav
erne and Shirley" episode. The title char
acters were watching television, and from
my perspective their set seemed plagued
by a flickering horizontal bar that
scrolled down the screen two or three
times per second. I assumed that it was
merely the consequence of the old televi
sion they used in the scene.
It turns out, however, that any TV pic
ture of a television or computer monitor
will do the same thing.
Television screens and computer mon
itors work according to the same basic
principle. A beam of electrons is fired
through an evacuated glass box (called a
cathode ray tube, or CRD at a phospho
rescent screen, which glows when the
beam strikes it. To generate a picture, the

beam is swept in horizontal lines across
the screen, from top to bottom, until the
entire screen has been "painted."
This sweeping strategy is responsible
for the minuscule horizontal lines you can
see on a TV screen if you look more close
ly than would make your mother comfort
able.
It takes some reasonably constant
amount of time (about one twenty-fourth
of a second) to print out a whole screen.
The picture doesn't change much from
frame to frame, so you basically have a
periodic phenomenon. If you're watching
a TV picture of a computer monitor, you
have two interacting periodic phenomena
— television and computer monitor.
The concise but (for the moment)
incomprehensible answer to your ques
tion is that the period of the TV's oscilla
tion is different from that of the monitor.
To understand why this results in a visi
ble flickering of the picture of the moni
tor, we're going to have to digress for a
few paragraphs and discuss some qualita
tive aspects of oscillations, using sound as
a model.
Sound is a periodic compression of air.

A simple sound, like the dull tone of a
pitch pipe, or the equally dull tone of
many CIV lecturers, can be thought of as
a (Warning: Pre-calculus alert) sine wave.
At the crests of the waves, the air is most
compressed, and at the troughs, it is most
rarefied.
Like all sinusoidal functions, a simple
sound wave has a period (the amount of
time it takes to repeat, crest to crest) and
an inversely proportional frequency (the
number of times per second that the wave
repeats). The higher the frequency — i.e.,

the shorter the period — the higher the
pitch of the sound.
Now, to the meat of the matter: When
two simple sounds with different frequen
cies are played, you hear not two but three
pitches: the low frequency, fl, the high
frequency, f2, and a "beat" frequency
equal to the difference between f2 and fl.
The beat frequency is the result of espe
cially high crests (and troughs) that occur
when both of the main frequencies are
cresting (or troughing) at the same time;
this happens with a frequency P2-fl.
"Um.. .Chris. . .what does this have to
do with televisions?"
Patience, gentle readers. Remember
our observation that the scanning of the
CRT beam over a TV screen is a periodic
phenomenon. It's obviously not a pure,
monotone sine wave — although some
times Arsenio Hall makes me wonder —
but it has some of the same mathematical
properties.
When you take a CRT record of anoth
er CRT, it's the electronic equivalent of
playing two dissonant pitch pipes at the
same time. The flickering that you see in
such situations is the beat frequency

resulting from the difference between the
