## Foudy ready to take soccer game to new horizons 
### Gretchen Atwood Senior staff writer 
Although Julie Foudy's final colle
giate season ended last week, her inter
national soccer career continues.
As a starter on the U.S. National
Team, Foudy can take advantage of the
few post-college opportunities open to
women soccer players.
Having already notched a world title,
the Stanford senior plans to postpone
medical school until after the next
World Championships in 1995.
"The feeling I got in that World Cup
is what makes me definitely want to
play in another one," said Foudy, who
helped the U.S. squad to the title in
front of 65,000 screaming fans in China
last November. "It was such an intangi
ble thing for so long. To finally be there
and win was just amazing."
However, the team had a difficult
time just getting to that point. The con
cept of a well-funded women's program
faced stiff opposition from the U.S. soc
cer establishment.
"The men's side said they didn't
want competition from the women,"
she said. "That was why it was so hard
to get the World Cup in the first place.
We couldn't call it the World Cup
because it would take away from the
men."
According to Foudy, salaries were
also a bone of contention since the U.S.
Soccer Federation didn't start pumping
money into the women's program until
1991.
"They wanted to be on contract,"
Foudy said of her older teammates who
are now getting paid. "Two years before
the World Cup we were traveling six
months out of the year. Many people
were trying to hold down jobs and some
of them got fired, so salaries were a big
issue."
Another issue is whether women's
soccer is going to be added to the
Olympics in 1996.
"The argument was that we had to
have a world championships before we

become an Olympic sport," she said.
"Many of the players who built the
U.S. team are 26 or 27 and are retiring
now. It would have been great if we
could have gone from the World Cup to
the Olympics in 1992."
In fact, many people assume that
women's soccer has been in the
Olympics for years.
"Last year a lot of people asked me if
I was going to Barcelona," she said.
"It's frustrating because you look at all
the sports represented and almost all of
them that have a female equivalent are
in there, except for soccer."
But in recent years, the women's
game has grown. Japan and Sweden
now boast fledgling leagues in which
several national team players have
shown interest.
Because of corporation sponsorship,
the Japanese league offers foreign play
ers a base salary of $30-35,000 plus
room and board. And national team
players can often negotiate a higher
salary, said Foudy, who would like to
explore that option.
But, despite concerns about the
Olympics and a possible professional
career, Foudy said she is still looking
back at her recently-ended college
career.
"I wanted my last game here to be
something I could look back on and
think I gave everything and I feel good
about it. But looking back on that game,
I don't think that at all," said Foudy of
the 2-0 loss to Santa Clara that knocked
the Cardinal out of the NCAA tourna
ment.
"Some days you get out there and
you can run for hours without getting
tired. I don't know if I didn't taper well
or I wasn't feeling well, but I just didn't
have it ... A bad way to end four
years."
But Foudy considers that game her
only regret in a Stanford career which
has seen the Cardinal program go
from obscurity to a top-5 national
power.
And, from the time Stanford tied No.

1 North Carolina in Foudy's freshman
year to the present, she has played a
huge role in the Cardinal's success.
"Her physical abilities are at a very
high standard and when she plays, she
makes everyone play better," said assis
tant coach lan Sawyers. "She's very
much a team player."
She's also a team leader. "Off the
field, she's such a wacko," Sawyers
added. "She's one of the players that
really bonds the whole team togeth
er.
Foudy has indisputably left a mark
on the squad's character. A chat with
any player will almost invariably lead
to an anecdote about Foudy's antics —
whether it's about her mocking goalie
Chris Massell during practice, playing
practical jokes on teammates during
roadtrips, or tagging them with not
so-flattering nicknames, like Andrea
Johnson's "Picker," so called for her
innocuous habit of picking at a scab
early freshman year.
While head coach Berhane Ande
berhan just shakes his head good
naturedly or rolls his eyes at Foudy's
silliness, she recalls her shenanigans
with pride.
"When it comes down to it, it's not
how many games you win, it's how
stupid you can be," philosophized the
senior, who said her single biggest con
tribution to the Cardinal program was,
"Them having to put up with my obnox
iousness for four years."
Unfortunately for the coaches and
players, they may have to put up with
her for longer than that. Foudy plans to
stop by spring practice and watch some
games next fall.
"They're not getting rid of me yet.
I'm going to stand on the line when
they run and say, 'You didn't touch
this line!"' said Foudy, grinning at the
prospect of tormenting her team
mates.
"I'll sit there with my beach chair,
drinking a Coke and yelling, 'You're not
pushing it hard enough!' I'll be their
worst nightmare."

months out of the year. Many people
were trying to hold down jobs and some
of them got fired, so salaries were a big
issue."
Another issue is whether women's
soccer is going to be added to the
Olympics in 1996.
"The argument was that we had to
have a world championships before we

become an Olympic sport," she said.
"Many of the players who built the
U.S. team are 26 or 27 and are retiring
now. It would have been great if we
could have gone from the World Cup to
the Olympics in 1992."
In fact, many people assume that
women's soccer has been in the
Olympics for years.
"Last year a lot of people asked me if
I was going to Barcelona," she said.
"It's frustrating because you look at all
the sports represented and almost all of
them that have a female equivalent are
in there, except for soccer."
But in recent years, the women's
game has grown. Japan and Sweden
now boast fledgling leagues in which
several national team players have
shown interest.
Because of corporation sponsorship,
the Japanese league offers foreign play
ers a base salary of $30-35,000 plus
room and board. And national team
players can often negotiate a higher
salary, said Foudy, who would like to
explore that option.
But, despite concerns about the
Olympics and a possible professional
career, Foudy said she is still looking
back at her recently-ended college
career.
"I wanted my last game here to be
something I could look back on and
think I gave everything and I feel good
about it. But looking back on that game,
I don't think that at all," said Foudy of
the 2-0 loss to Santa Clara that knocked
the Cardinal out of the NCAA tourna
ment.
"Some days you get out there and
you can run for hours without getting
tired. I don't know if I didn't taper well
or I wasn't feeling well, but I just didn't
have it ... A bad way to end four
years."
But Foudy considers that game her
only regret in a Stanford career which
has seen the Cardinal program go
from obscurity to a top-5 national
power.
And, from the time Stanford tied No.

1 North Carolina in Foudy's freshman
year to the present, she has played a
huge role in the Cardinal's success.
"Her physical abilities are at a very
high standard and when she plays, she
makes everyone play better," said assis
tant coach lan Sawyers. "She's very
much a team player."
She's also a team leader. "Off the
field, she's such a wacko," Sawyers
added. "She's one of the players that
really bonds the whole team togeth
er.
Foudy has indisputably left a mark
on the squad's character. A chat with
any player will almost invariably lead
to an anecdote about Foudy's antics —
whether it's about her mocking goalie
Chris Massell during practice, playing
practical jokes on teammates during
roadtrips, or tagging them with not
so-flattering nicknames, like Andrea
Johnson's "Picker," so called for her
innocuous habit of picking at a scab
early freshman year.
While head coach Berhane Ande
berhan just shakes his head good
naturedly or rolls his eyes at Foudy's
silliness, she recalls her shenanigans
with pride.
"When it comes down to it, it's not
how many games you win, it's how
stupid you can be," philosophized the
senior, who said her single biggest con
tribution to the Cardinal program was,
"Them having to put up with my obnox
iousness for four years."
Unfortunately for the coaches and
players, they may have to put up with
her for longer than that. Foudy plans to
stop by spring practice and watch some
games next fall.
"They're not getting rid of me yet.
I'm going to stand on the line when
they run and say, 'You didn't touch
this line!"' said Foudy, grinning at the
prospect of tormenting her team
mates.
"I'll sit there with my beach chair,
drinking a Coke and yelling, 'You're not
pushing it hard enough!' I'll be their
worst nightmare."

Julie Foudy has every reason to smile as her Stanford career has drawn to a close and
a future of international soccer awaits.
Although Julie Foudy's final colle
giate season ended last week, her inter
national soccer career continues.
As a starter on the U.S. National
Team, Foudy can take advantage of the
few post-college opportunities open to
women soccer players.
Having already notched a world title,
the Stanford senior plans to postpone
medical school until after the next
World Championships in 1995.
"The feeling I got in that World Cup
is what makes me definitely want to
play in another one," said Foudy, who
helped the U.S. squad to the title in
front of 65,000 screaming fans in China
last November. "It was such an intangi
ble thing for so long. To finally be there
and win was just amazing."
However, the team had a difficult
time just getting to that point. The con
cept of a well-funded women's program
faced stiff opposition from the U.S. soc
cer establishment.
"The men's side said they didn't
want competition from the women,"
she said. "That was why it was so hard
to get the World Cup in the first place.
We couldn't call it the World Cup
because it would take away from the
men."
According to Foudy, salaries were
also a bone of contention since the U.S.
Soccer Federation didn't start pumping
money into the women's program until
1991.
"They wanted to be on contract,"
Foudy said of her older teammates who
are now getting paid. "Two years before
the World Cup we were traveling six
months out of the year. Many people
were trying to hold down jobs and some
of them got fired, so salaries were a big
issue."
Another issue is whether women's
soccer is going to be added to the
