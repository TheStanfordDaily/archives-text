# Flag saved by heroic yell leader; hoopsters make contact
## 
### 
As we prepare for Turkey Day, it
seems only appropriate that we
take one last look back to Satur
day's triumph over Cal, and a look for
ward to what is to come in basketball, the
sport of winter. Bearing this in mind, I
feel that there are two pertinent tales to
tell: that of a flag and that of a contact
lens.
Flag Boy takes on multiple Bears,
triumphs
It was not so much the activity on the
field that provided the most excitement
in Big Game, but rather the activity off of
it. The overall tone of the day was that
there was a great deal of class displayed
on the field by the Stanford football
team, and a severe lack thereof by the Cal
student section, who should have
remained in their seats.
By far, the highlight of Saturday after
noon's spectacle in Memorial Stadium
was the encounter between Seye Ewede
mi, a.k.a. Flag Boy, and some less-than
scholarly Cal students. First of all, if any
one was going to mess with Flag Boy, you
knew it would be Cal students. Only a
Weenie would be dumb enough to do so. I
mean, just look at the man. He is huge.

He is bigger than many of the guys on the
Stanford football team. Flag Boy, in
short, is a yell-leading tour de force.
As evidence, while the rest of the yell
leaders were mostly inept in generating
cheers from the Stanford student section,
when Flag Boy took the mike with an Axe
chant of "Five more years," the student
section responded — loudly. After all, if
you were in the first five rows, would you
tell Flag Boy, "That's a lame cheer," or
"That's OK, Seye, but I'll sit this one
out"? I don't think so.
Anyway, two Bear fans committed a
Cardinal sin, especially as far as Flag Boy
is concerned. They took the flag. And
what would Flag Boy be without the
landmark from which his nickname
emanates?
The first Berkeley student grabbed the
flag and handed it to another, who appar
ently began poking Stanford alums with
the pole. Flag Boy vaulted into the stands
and took out the first joker, and then
grabbed the flag from the other and
handed it to another yell leader. The Cal
students, in their wisdom, then tossed
Flag Boy from the stands, prompting him
to go from angry to mad. He jumped back
up into the stands, and judging from my

viewing angle, finished off about a half
dozen Cal students at one time, and was
ready for more.
But then the police stepped in to save
the impostors from a certain death. For
as Flag Boy himself stated, "That guy
should either be arrested or they should
let me go at him for half an hour." The
Cal students got off easy, as they were
forced into the first option.
Flag Boy proved himself to be a true
patriot on Saturday, for he guarded the
Stanford banner with his life, fighting to
keep the precious rag from enemy hands
clad in blue. He is truly a school hero.
Hereafter, no longer should he simply be
referred to as Flag Boy — he is Flag Man,
defender of the Stanford Red. Don't let
anyone tell you otherwise.
Hoops team has sharp eyes
Watching exhibition basketball is
tough, because there are a lot of mis
takes, and the kinks in the team's play
still need to be worked out. But if any
thing could serve as an indicator of the
Cardinal's potential this year, it is an
event that occurred at Monday night's
game, for a key ingredient to any team —

teamwork — was tellingly displayed.
Neil Stephens, a 6-foot-8, 254-pound
forward for the New Zealand National
Team, had been using aggressive play
inside all night, throwing his elbows
every which way on both offense and

defense. A noticeably thinner Todd Man
ley drew the task of defending Stephens.
Midway through the first half, Manley
and Stephens were battling in the post,
and Stephens threw an elbow that landed
squarely on Manley's nose. Blood poured
down Manley's face, and Manley's con
tact lens was knocked out from the blow.
As Manley went to the bench to clean
his face, play on the court was stopped to
hunt for the lost optical. Peter Dukes,

Kenny Hicks and Brent Williams atten
tively searched the key for the contact.
Hicks, who was stationed at the left side
of the top of the key, spotted the lens and
pointed diagonally to Dukes, who was
positioned in the right block. Dukes then
saw the lens, scooped it up and ran over
to the bench to the applause of the 321
people in attendance.
Overall, the search process took less
than one minute to complete. With full
vision, Manley went on to score 10 points.
As coach Mike Montgomery said, "This
team has to recognize that the whole is
bigger than the parts." If the players can
concentrate hard enough to find a tiny,
clear contact on the dark Maples Pavilion
floor in record time, just think of the pos
sibilities for the season if they can exe
cute together! Clearly, the Cardinal has
its sights set on things larger than a con
tact lens, namely the NCAA Tourna
ment.
So, it is with a clear vision of school
spirit that we have a lot to be thankful for
tomorrow.
