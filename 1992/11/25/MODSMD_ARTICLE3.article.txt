# Boycott '94 Big Game?
## Band, Axe Committee members call for action after fruit-throwing, attacks 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Furious over the violence at this year's
Big Game, members of the Stanford Band
and Axe Committee are threatening to boy
cott the 1994 event unless UC-Berkeley
takes action.
"It was hooliganism, basically," Band
Manager Jesse Johannesen said of Satur
day's fruit-throwing and attacks on the
Stanford Tree and a yell leader. "We might
as well have been at a British soccer match."
Along with Axe Committee members,
Johannesen plans to draft letters to Stan
ford and Berkeley's athletic directors as
well as the Pacific 10 Conference office ask
ing them to take measures to ensure a more
peaceful game next time.
"Something's got to change over there,"
Johannesen said. The band could refuse to
attend the next Big Game at Berkeley or
balk at doing a field show, he added.
But Berkeley Athletic Director Bob
Bockrath, while calling Cal student misbe
havior "deplorable," added that the respon
sibility "doesn't rest solely on our campus."
"While we were bad . . . there were also
students from the Stanford section throw
ing fruit," he said.
He has asked his staff to critique the
event and suggest changes for the future,
Bockrath said, possibly including a joint
campaign through Berkeley and Stanford's
Interfraternity Councils.
Axe Committee Chairman Steve Zika
was also upset by Saturday's violence. "It's
gotten completely out of control," he said.
"We're basically very, very disturbed by
this. It gets worse every year."

While security forces assured him before
the game that conditions would be better
than in prior years, Zika said they were not.
"I think we need a change in attitude,"
he said. "I'm going to write letters to the
proper authorities [and] I think
the people who were assaulted
should press charges."
Greg Siegel, who plays Stan
ford's mascot, was tackled by two
Berkeley students who knocked
him to the ground and ripped his
tree costume. The students were
arrested, but Siegel said he has
not yet decided whether to press
charges.
"1 don't want to do anything
unless it addresses the lack of
security at Cal," said Siegel, who
was not hurt in the incident. "My
concern is not with the two guys
who ran onto the field" but with
the bigger issue of whether "in
two years it will be safer for
everyone."
Although no one on the Axe
Committee was injured, Zika
said, some were "scared for their
own health." Tradition may force
the Axe to be present, he said, but
the same is not true of committee
members.
"If there are no signs of
change, there will probably be
people from the Axe Committee
who on a personal level would
decide not to go" in 1994, Zika
said.
According to Johannesen, it is
important that students band
together to condemn the violence.
"I'm sure that little Stanford
Band threats won't amount to
much in the grand scheme of
things," he said, adding that pres
sure from others as well might
make a difference.
A boycott of Big Game would
be "unfortunate," Berkeley Exec
utive Assoc. Athletic Director Bob
Driscoll said. "I would hate to see
that happen."
He attributed some of the vio
lence to the game's uneven score.
"When one school is in control of
the outcome, people look for
other ways to let out their ener
gy," Driscoll said. "We were very
fortunate it didn't turn into
something worse than it was."
More security and an appeal to
students at both schools could help,
he said. But no matter how much
security there is, "when you have
80,000 people in the stands" and
fans "are drinking on both sides,"
Driscoll said it leaves Berkeley in
an impossible situation.
Stanford's approach of fencing
off the perimeter isn't feasible
because Berkeley's stadium rests
on an earthquake fault line, he
added. The escape route leads
onto the field.
More security personnel might
not help, according to Johan
nesen, since police officers at Sat
urday's game seemed afraid to
restrain people. "They were
there, but they didn't do any
thing," he said.
Since he was not at Berkeley
two years ago, Bockrath said he
was surprised by some of the Big
Game incidents. "I didn't know
about the fruit business until two
days before the game," he said.
"Those kinds of things are almost
traditions and not easily
changed."

about the fruit business until two
days before the game," he said.
"Those kinds of things are almost
traditions and not easily
changed."
Furious over the violence at this year's
Big Game, members of the Stanford Band
and Axe Committee are threatening to boy
cott the 1994 event unless UC-Berkeley
takes action.
"It was hooliganism, basically," Band
Manager Jesse Johannesen said of Satur
day's fruit-throwing and attacks on the
Stanford Tree and a yell leader. "We might
as well have been at a British soccer match."
Along with Axe Committee members,
Johannesen plans to draft letters to Stan
ford and Berkeley's athletic directors as
well as the Pacific 10 Conference office ask
ing them to take measures to ensure a more
peaceful game next time.
"Something's got to change over there,"
Johannesen said. The band could refuse to
attend the next Big Game at Berkeley or
balk at doing a field show, he added.
But Berkeley Athletic Director Bob
Bockrath, while calling Cal student misbe
havior "deplorable," added that the respon
sibility "doesn't rest solely on our campus."
"While we were bad . . . there were also
students from the Stanford section throw
ing fruit," he said.
He has asked his staff to critique the
event and suggest changes for the future,
Bockrath said, possibly including a joint
campaign through Berkeley and Stanford's
Interfraternity Councils.
Axe Committee Chairman Steve Zika
was also upset by Saturday's violence. "It's
gotten completely out of control," he said.
"We're basically very, very disturbed by
this. It gets worse every year."

While security forces assured him before
the game that conditions would be better
than in prior years, Zika said they were not.
"I think we need a change in attitude,"
he said. "I'm going to write letters to the
proper authorities [and] I think
the people who were assaulted
should press charges."
Greg Siegel, who plays Stan
ford's mascot, was tackled by two
Berkeley students who knocked
him to the ground and ripped his
tree costume. The students were
arrested, but Siegel said he has
not yet decided whether to press
charges.
"1 don't want to do anything
unless it addresses the lack of
security at Cal," said Siegel, who
was not hurt in the incident. "My
concern is not with the two guys
who ran onto the field" but with
the bigger issue of whether "in
two years it will be safer for
everyone."
Although no one on the Axe
Committee was injured, Zika
said, some were "scared for their
own health." Tradition may force
the Axe to be present, he said, but
the same is not true of committee
members.
"If there are no signs of
change, there will probably be
people from the Axe Committee
who on a personal level would
decide not to go" in 1994, Zika
said.
According to Johannesen, it is
important that students band
together to condemn the violence.
"I'm sure that little Stanford
Band threats won't amount to
much in the grand scheme of
things," he said, adding that pres
sure from others as well might
make a difference.
A boycott of Big Game would
be "unfortunate," Berkeley Exec
utive Assoc. Athletic Director Bob
Driscoll said. "I would hate to see
that happen."
He attributed some of the vio
lence to the game's uneven score.
"When one school is in control of
the outcome, people look for
other ways to let out their ener
gy," Driscoll said. "We were very
fortunate it didn't turn into
something worse than it was."
More security and an appeal to
students at both schools could help,
he said. But no matter how much
security there is, "when you have
80,000 people in the stands" and
fans "are drinking on both sides,"
Driscoll said it leaves Berkeley in
an impossible situation.
Stanford's approach of fencing
off the perimeter isn't feasible
because Berkeley's stadium rests
on an earthquake fault line, he
added. The escape route leads
onto the field.
More security personnel might
not help, according to Johan
nesen, since police officers at Sat
urday's game seemed afraid to
restrain people. "They were
there, but they didn't do any
thing," he said.
Since he was not at Berkeley
two years ago, Bockrath said he
was surprised by some of the Big
Game incidents. "I didn't know
about the fruit business until two
days before the game," he said.
"Those kinds of things are almost
traditions and not easily
changed."
