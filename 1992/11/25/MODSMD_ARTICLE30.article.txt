### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Yesterday, the Stanford
women's swimming team wal
loped the Hawaii Rainbows in a
141-49 blowout at deGuerre Pool.
The Cardinal placed first in all
11 events, with the best individu
al performance of the meet going
to senior backstroker Lea Love
less.
Loveless became Stanford's
first qualifier for the NCAA
Championships by swimming the
backstroke leg of the 400-yard
medley relay in 54.98 seconds.
Loveless, an Olympic bronze
medalist in the 100 back, quali
fied under the NCAA standards
by 30 seconds, but was well off the
52.79-second American record
pace she set last year.
"My time surprised me
because we had a very rigorous
workout this morning, and I was
really tired," Loveless said. "Even
though the time was faster than I
expected, I'll definitely take it. It's
a good beginning."
In a rare performance, Love
less later opted to swim the 50-
yard freestyle as an off-event and
won in a convincing 24.50. She
also anchored a Stanford 400 free
relay team that came from behind
to tie a second Stanford team in a
Cardinal sweep of the meet's last
event.
The rest of the squad also did

exceptionally well, considering
that they practiced from 6 to 8
a.m. before returning to the pool
at 11 for the meet.
Olympian Jenny Thompson
clocked a 2:03.22 in the 200 indi
vidual medley, out-distancing the
rest of the field by a good seven
seconds. She also led off the victo
rious Stanford 400 free relay
team.

for us because it
helped us build the
competitive edge

practice.'

Other notable performers
included the one-two finishes of
freshmen Lisa Jacobs and Jane
Skillman in the 200 free. Both
swimmers were competing in
their first meet for Stanford after
sitting out the beginning of the
season with shoulder problems.
"The freshmen, Lisa and Jane,
did excellent today, and we're
really proud of them," Thompson
said. "I think, as a team, we per
formed better than expected at

this point in the season, consider
ing we haven't had that many
speed workouts."
Some of the team's veterans
also turned in solid swims, includ
ing senior Katherine Comanor,
Stanford's most improved swim
mer from last year. Comanor fin
ished the 200 back in 2:05.87.
Sophomore Julie Kole started
off the individual events with a
10:18.08 showing in the 1000
free. In the second half of the
meet, former Olympian Janel Jor
genson registered a 2:01.94 in the
200 butterfly, and was followed
by a 1:09.37 performance by Mary
Edwards in the 100 free.
To round out the events, Mary
Ellen Blanchard won the 500 free
in 5:01.45, while teammate Lori
Heisick swam the last individual
race of the day, the 200 breast
stroke, in a time of 2:19.81.
"We're swimming real solid
right now even though everyone's
swimming tired," said senior co
captain and backstroker Anne
Mahoney. "This meet was good
for us because it helped us build
the competitive edge that you
don't get in practice.
"The times are going to be a lit
