# Spikers roll in seniors' finale
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
It might have been the last regular season home
match for the Stanford women's volleyball team,
but from the looks of its play against San Jose
State last night, this team is just getting started.
Following a pre-game ceremony in which
seniors Kristi Paaso, Jennifer Jackson and tri-cap
tains Carrie Feldman, Laurie Sawin and Bev Oden
were honored in their final regular season home
match, Stanford (24-2, 16-2 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference) crushed the visiting Spartans in straight
games, 15-1, 15-3, 15-10.
Head coach Don Shaw said he was pleased with
the play of his squad throughout the match.
"We came in and played with a high level of
intensity regardless of what San Jose State was
doing," Shaw said. "We played hard and really
didn't give up any easy points."
San Jose State (14-17, 9-9 in the Big West Con
ference) was led by freshman outside hitter Crista
Koch, who hit .095 with seven kills and three digs.
Middle blockers Jennifer Gross and Cristin Ross
man added five kills each, with Gross picking up
six digs and two blocks.
Stanford held the Spartans to an abysmal .048
hitting percentage as a team, a figure mostly
attributable to a total of 21 hitting errors by San
Jose State on the match.
The Cardinal, on the other hand, hit .374 as a
team, and got solid production from its front line
throughout the night. Sophomore hitter Anne
Wicks led the team with nine kills, two blocks, and
a .500 hitting average. Oden added six kills, three
digs, and two blocks with a .556 team-leading hit
ting average. From the outside hitting positions,
Paaso and freshman Cary Wendell each contribut
ed eight kills, with Paaso hitting .438 with four

digs and Wendell hitting .462 to go along with five
digs.
In addition to dominating play from the start
ing six, the Cardinal also got key performances
from its bench in the third game. Shaw rotated all
of Stanford's players in at one time or another in
that final game, as freshman Marnie Triefenbach
came away with six kills, a block and an ace, while
freshman Wendy Hromadka hit .500 with five kills.
Next weekend, Stanford will wrap up the regu
lar season as it travels to Stockton for the
Banker's Classic Tournament.
The Cardinal will meet No. 13 UC-Santa Bar
bara in the first round on Friday night. If Stanford
wins, it will meet the winner of the No. 4 Pacific-
No. 18 Texas Tech match in the championship
match Saturday night.
"We'll have one practice this week, then we hit
these guys," Shaw said of the upcoming matches
in Stockton. "It'll be a tough tournament — UCSB
has been moving up the polls all year. It'll help us
to play them well — they should all be real good
matches."
Both matches are crucial to Stanford in terms
of NCAA seedings, which are announced this Sun
day. If Stanford maintains its current No. 2 rank
ing behind top-ranked UCLA, by NCAA rules
Stanford must be moved out of the West region
and seeded No. 1 in another region with the lowest
nationally-ranked top seed. Based on the current
polls, that would place Stanford in the Mideast
region as the top seed ahead of No. 6 Illinois.
Regardless of its regional placement, Stanford is
almost sure to host an NCAA first-round match at
Maples Pavilion on Dec. 4 or 5.
"We're not really thinking about who we'll play
or where we'll be," Shaw said. "We've come a long
ways as a team, so when the time comes we'll play
as best we can. We either do it or we don't."
