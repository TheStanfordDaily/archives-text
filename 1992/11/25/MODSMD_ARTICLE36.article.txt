# Water polo gets one last chance to shake Bear tracks
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
There comes a time when specula
tion ends and action takes over. For
Stanford's No. 2 water polo team,
that time will be this weekend at the
NCAA Championship Tournament.
As the second seed in the eight
team, single elimination tourney, the
Cardinal (20-5) will vie for its sev
enth national title at the Belmont
Plaza Olympic Pool in Long Beach.
Since the 1980's, Stanford has
appeared nine times in the NCAA's,
taking home four championships, its
last in 1986. The Cardinal placed sec
ond to California in its last outing in
1990.
"Our goal is another shot at Cal,"
said Stanford head coach Dante Det
tamanti, referring to the predicted
final between the red and the blue
and gold.
Top-ranked Cal will attempt to
ride its 41-game winning streak to a
third consecutive and 11th overall
crown. Standing in the way of both
Bay Area powers are USC, UC-Irvine,
Pepperdine, UC-San Diego, Princeton
and Navy, which are the third
through eighth seeds, respectively.
Stanford will begin its champ
ionship drive with NCAA Tourna
ment newcomer Princeton at 1:30
p.m. Friday. The 21-4 Tigers secured
an invitation by virtue of capturing
the Eastern Collegiate Champ
ionships.
Dettamanti is not particularly con
cerned by the Ivy League club. First
of all, no East Coast team has ever
defeated a West Coast squad in the
23-year history of the NCAA's. Also,

while Princeton received the seventh
seed, the Tigers' true national rank
ing is lower than seventh.
As is usually the case, California
schools dominated the country's top
10 this season. However, only six
schools from one state may be invited
to the NCAA Tournament in one
year, a rule that prevented the Cardi
nal from appearing in the 1991 tour
ney.

'Our goal is another shot
at Cal.'
— Dante Dettamanti

Dettamanti foresees a much
tighter Saturday semifinal match-up
with projected opponent USC at 6:30
p.m. Admittedly, Stanford possesses
a great psychological edge over the
Trojans, who have lost all four prior
confrontations with the Cardinal this
season. In addition, in their last
encounter at deGuerre Pool, Stan
ford pounced on Southern Cal 7-2
through three quarters before the
Cardinal, according to Dettamanti,
"sat on our lead" in the final stretch
to triumph by a deceptively low mar
gin of 7-6.
It is likely that Stanford will meet
Cal in the finals at 8 p.m. Sunday
evening. As before, the Cardinal must
work on two key objectives. First, it
will need to capitalize on high-per
centage scoring opportunities such as
six-on-five power play advantages.
Second, Stanford's defense must pre
vent the Bears' centerforwards from

their usual offensive production,
especially Cal's German Olympic
team member Dirk Zeien. The Cardi
nal were unable to meet these goals in
all three of their losses to the Bears
this year.
While Dettamanti said he feels his
team can reach the finals and play an
almost perfect game to ruin the
Bears' first undefeated season, Stan
ford will most likely have to perform
without the talents of Ail-American
and team scoring leader Wolf Wigo.
The sophomore injured his back dur
ing practice two weeks ago, and has
aggravated his condition by trying to
return to full scrimmage too soon.
Stanford lost to Cal at Berkeley by
a mere three point differential during
last Saturday's Big Splash without
the services of Wigo. Ail-American or
no AU-American, the Cardinal figures
to make a serious bid for another
national title this weekend.
