Two UC-Berkeley football players
locked arms and charged a Stanford
yell leader after Big Game Saturday,
slamming her to the astroturf and
causing minor injuries, witnesses
said.
The victim suffered "severe
headaches" and "body aches" over the
weekend, forcing her to visit Cowell
Student Health Center and postpone
two exams, according to yell leader
coach Lori White.
After a Stanford graduate student
described the incident as intentional
and gave her the players' jersey num
bers, White said she wrote a letter to
UC-Berkeley's chancellor and Stan
ford's athletic director calling for an
investigation.
