## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Two UC-Berkeley football players
locked arms and charged a Stanford
yell leader after Big Game Saturday,
slamming her to the astroturf and
causing minor injuries, witnesses
said.
The victim suffered "severe
headaches" and "body aches" over the
weekend, forcing her to visit Cowell
Student Health Center and postpone
two exams, according to yell leader
coach Lori White.
After a Stanford graduate student
described the incident as intentional
and gave her the players' jersey num
bers, White said she wrote a letter to
UC-Berkeley's chancellor and Stan
ford's athletic director calling for an
investigation.
White, a graduate student and
Berkeley alumna, said she is angry
that "two student athletes affiliat
ed with the University ... who
outweigh the cheerleader by a
good 150 pounds" would purpose
ly hurt someone.
She said the injured yell leader,
who prefers that her name not be
used, would like to see the players
disciplined through Berkeley's
internal conduct system.
But White added that she has
heard about a videotape which the
owner claims shows the incident
was accidental. She has not seen
the tape, however.
James Rodriguez, the graduate
student who witnessed the inci
dent, said the players "locked
arms at the shoulders" and ran
toward the yell leader at top speed.
"It looked like they were trying
to knock her down and hurt her,"
he said.
The yell leader's back was turned
when they hit her, said White.
The victim was out of town yes
terday and could not be reached
for comment.
