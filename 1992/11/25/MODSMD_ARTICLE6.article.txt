Search committees for a new
multicultural educator and direc
tor for the Black Community Ser
vices Center are finding their tasks
more time consuming than they
originally thought, and now plan to
fill the positions sometime winter
quarter.
English Prof. John Baugh, chair
of the committee selecting the new

assistant dean of students who will
serve as director of the BCSC, said
he hopes people will "understand
that it's more important to find the
right person than to push things to
be done by January 1."
The committee has narrowed
its list of candidates down to 15
from the original 80 applicants, he
said, and hopes to bring those fi
nalists to campus for a lengthy in
terview process.
The search began when former

Dean Keith Archuleta resigned
after being arrested June 2 for se
cretly videotaping women during
photography sessions in his apart
ment.
Archuleta was sentenced to four
years of probation and 200 hours of
community service, after pleading
no contest to two misdemeanor ac
counts of electronic eavesdrop
ping.
The assistant director of the
BCSC, Barbara Smith, has been

serving as the acting director dur
ing the search.
The search committee for a new
multicultural educator has pared
down their original pool of 140 ap
plicants to six finalists, according to
Dean of Students Michael Jackson,
who is chairing the committee.
The position of multicultural
educator has been vacant since
Greg Ricks resigned May 12 to take
a job as vice president for educa
tion and training at City Year, a

non-profit "urban peace corps" in
Boston.
The committee plans to brings
its finalists to Stanford early win
ter quarter, Jackson said. The can
didates will meet with faculty, staff
and students and be interviewed
by the search committee during
their visit to campus, he said.
The finalists are from all areas
of the country and have work his
tories in university settings, Jack
son said.

"We had a wonderful pool.
We're all really excited about the
candidates we have our eyes on,"
said Assoc. Director of Residential
Education Ann Porteus, another
member of the multicultural edu
cator search committee.
The two committees will have
their finalists come to campus for
interviews during different inter
vals so the Stanford community
can focus on one decision at a time,
Baugh said.
