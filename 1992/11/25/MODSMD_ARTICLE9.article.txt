# Run a stop sign — pay a $115 fine
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Students caught violating the law on their bicycles
will pay the price this year.
But the money will not be going to the Stanford's
police department or even the University — it will
fill the coffers of Santa Clara County.
"Rate increases are sent down by the state legisla
ture to be enforced by the judges at the county level,"
said Steven Bordelon, clerk at the Santa Clara Coun
ty Municipal Court.
Some students under the impression that the money
collected goes to the University have complained about

the high fines. "I just don't understand why it's neces
sary for Stanford to charge this amount of money for
something so simple," freshman Bill Ryan said.
Fie received a $115 ticket for failing to stop his bi
cycle at a stop sign. "That's almost as much as they
ought to charge for a speeding ticket," he said.
After slowing down but failing to stop at a stop
sign near Roble last month, senior Karen Beck re
ceived a ticket for $ 120. "It was a trap," she said. "It
was 10 in the morning. There were no cars, no bikes,
no people, no nothing.
"I was surprised to get a ticket for $120," said
Beck, whose ticket included a
charge for having an unregistered
bike. "I was expecting like $25. It
was just kind of frustrating."
Other increases include an $80
fine for riding a bicycle without a
light, Bordelon said.
"Stanford receives no money
from enforcing parking and traffic
violations," said Sgt. Hilary Carp
of the Stanford police department,
noting that all money collected
goes to the county.
The department receives its
direction from the sherifTs office,
so all rate schedules are set by the
county. "Judges at the county level
tell us how much we need to charge
in order to meet our share of the
total county income," Carp said.
"But the new fines do include
charges of more than $100 for
bicycle violations, as well as larger
parking tickets."
Carp added that Stanford "has
no control over the prices of bails
for infractions."
The new laws have had little
impact on the number of tickets
issued, he said, noting, "they
haven't caused any more compli
ance."
