Students caught violating the law on their bicycles
will pay the price this year.
But the money will not be going to the Stanford's

"Rate increases are sent down by the state legisla
ture to be enforced by the judges at the county level,"
said Steven Bordelon, clerk at the Santa Clara Coun
ty Municipal Court.
Some students under the impression that the money
collected goes to the University have complained about

the high fines. "I just don't understand why it's neces

Fie received a $115 ticket for failing to stop his bi
cycle at a stop sign. "That's almost as much as they
ought to charge for a speeding ticket," he said.
After slowing down but failing to stop at a stop
sign near Roble last month, senior Karen Beck re
ceived a ticket for $ 120. "It was a trap," she said. "It
was 10 in the morning. There were no cars, no bikes,
no people, no nothing.
"I was surprised to get a ticket for $120," said
