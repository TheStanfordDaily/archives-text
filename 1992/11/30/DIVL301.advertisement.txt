For example,
when you take off
during Winter and
Spring Break, Chase
Student Travel will
take off with you. In
fact, you'll get 5% off
the lowest prices you
find on airfares, train tickets, car rentals and
even hotels.
And when you're back at school spend
ing time on the phone, you don't have to
spend a lot of money. Just sign up for
ChasePhone SM at no extra charge, and you
can use your Chase card to make long dis
tance calls at MCl®'s low rates.
Best of all, these and many other bene
fits come to you with no annual fee for the
first year.
So look in your mailbox around
Thanksgiving for an application.
Or, pick one up on cam

other card says so
much.
