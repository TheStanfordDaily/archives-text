Rights and Responsibilities
AMITAI ETZIONI
SPEAKER
Tuesday, December 1,1992
7:30 p.m.
Lone Mountain, Room 100
(The USF Lone Mountain Campus entrance is located on Turk Blvd.)
Have we become a nation of single-issue partisans, with little regard for
the spectrum of issues that will determine our future?
Are the important issues of our day settled in court,
where litigants demand their rights, rather than through
communal dialogue and compromise?
In our efforts to achieve our individual goals, have we abandoned the
responsibility of steering our society tou>ard commonly determined goals?
If your answer is "yes" mark your calendar for December Ist and
plan to hear Amital Etzioni, University Professor at the George
Washington University, founder of the Communitarian social
movement, editor of the Communitarian quarterly The Responsive
Community, lecture on the communitarian agenda.
Please join us in this unique opportunity to hear one of the foremost
scholars on communitarianism speak on this issue. For more
information, please call the Davies Forum office at (415) 666-6147.
