STANFORD BASKETBALL
1992-1993

Dear Students:
Basketball season is here!!! We're off and running into the the
1992-93 season with a young team that needs the home court
advantage of their fellow students and classmates. We want to
create an atmosphere in Maples that gives us the intimidation of the
"sixth man". It would be great to send a warning to teams coming
to Stanford that this is our home and we're going to not let anyone
else win one here.
We spent the entire off season getting better and stronger as a team.
We also worked hard to help you help us by getting sponsors to pay
for your basketball tickets. I feel that we've accomplished both of
these. The team is ready, and you will be admitted free of charge to
every home basketball game this season courtesy of our sponsors.
The entire team encourages you to come out and become our home
court advantage, the "sixth man " on the Stanford Basketball team.
It all starts Wednesday, come out. Let's have some fun, this is your
team and we need your help.
112!

Dear Students:
Repeat!!! That's our theme for the coming season. We want to
repeat as NCAA Champions, and also repeat the enthusiasm and
excitement that you created last season. Home court advantage is
so important in college basketball. Student support gives a team
that extra advantage and we feel that our's is one of the best in the
country.
This season, with help from our sponsors, you will be admitted to
all home women's games free of charge. Come out, hoot and
holler, stomp your feet and let's make Maples the most intimidat
ing place for any team to visit.
We open the regular season tomorrow night against a very good
Texas Tech team. We want to sell it out and set the standard for all
home games.
Sincerely,
Tara Vanderveer
