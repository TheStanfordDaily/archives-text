# Diversity and dating difficult to reconcile
## Interracial couples often encounter troubles amidst multicultural atmosphere 
### Kimberly Chrisman Senior staff writer 
Call it Farm Fever.
In this multicultural microcosm called Stanford,
interracial dating is as politically correct — and al
most as prevalent — as recycling.
And although Stanford relationships hardly con
form to the popular stereotype of "jungle" love — in
terracial dating out of curiosity rather than commit
ment — a combination of students' newfound free
dom from parental pressures, a liberal atmosphere
and a diverse student body create a uniquely favor
able environment for interracial dating.

But despite its cosmopolitan reputation, Stanford
students in interracial relationships say they face many
of the same prejudices here as in the outside world.
"There are so many interracial couples at Stan
ford, but I'm not sure the level of understanding is
proportional to that," said one student who has dated
interracially.
Outside the agenda
According to Dr. Karen Huang, a Counseling and
Psychological Services counselor who leads dorm
workshops on interracial dating, the pressure to liter
ally embrace multiculturalism is one of the most

heated issues among Stanford students.
"People feel that it's politically incor
rect to say whether they have a prefer
ence [to date a person of a particular
race], even if they do," she said. "A rela
tionship is such a personal, intimate
thing, why should you have to worry
about other people's judgment?"
Unfortunately, many students do
worry, and for increasingly good reason.
Although interracial couples are as übiq
uitous as sunbathers at Stanford, some
say they are discouraged by what they
perceive as superficial support and feel
excluded from the multicultural agenda.
"In such a small community as Stan
ford, same-race couples are going to have
the same friends and the same interests,"
while interracial couples must adapt to
entirely unfamiliar social circles, said
"Mary" an African-American student.
Although active in the African-Ameri
can community, Mary felt "uncomfort
able" inviting "Joe," her Caucasian
boyfriend, to events within the communi
ty-
She felt equally uncomfortable in his
all-white circle of friends, many of whom
Joe admits "didn't really approve of
interracial dating."
In addition, Mary felt that Joe didn't
share her concerns and experiences as a
person of color.
"I didn't understand," Joe said. "I still
don't."
After more than a year of coping with
these problems — in addition to the com
mon conflicts faced by student couples —
the two parted ways last spring.
Lack of both mutual understanding
and similar backgrounds are among stu
dents' most-cited reasons for not dating
beyond their own race. These factors,
compounded by parental pressures, can
take the romance out of any relationship.
But interracial couples continue to stroll
the campus arm-in-arm, and some say
their numbers are growing.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson
attributes the plenitude of interracial
couples to the diversity of the student
body. Eighty percent of Stanford stu
dents come from ethnically homogeneous
communities. At Stanford, for the first
time, these students have the freedom
and opportunity to date interracially.
Freshman dorms are particularly
notorious breeders of interracial couples,
a phenomenon Huang ascribes to two fac
tors.
"One is the freedom available to fresh
men, but the other big thing is what kind
of relationship they're looking for," she
said. "Most freshmen are not looking for
a serious relationship. Race isn't as
important when you're going out to din
ner or ice skating as it is when you're get
ting married."
Dating the family
But even casual relationships can
come under fire from ultra-traditional
parents, who may consider an arranged
marriage or disownment preferable to an
interracial match.
"In Chinese culture, if you marry
someone, you marry their family too,"
said one Asian-American student,
explaining why many Asian parents
object to interracial dating.

"It's really hard to judge how much of
it is prejudice and how much is practical
ity," said another.
But many students of all races dismiss
the typical parental argument that inter
racial dating dilutes or weakens one's cul
ture. "Just because you marry within
your race doesn't mean you're going to
preserve the culture," one said.

'Most freshmen are not
looking for a serious
relationship. Race isn't as
important when you're
going out to dinner or ice
skating as it is when
you're getting married.'

However, several admit to being influ
enced by their parents' beliefs, reinforced
throughout their upbringing.
"Part of you wants to please your par
ents and part of you really thinks it's best
to marry someone of the same race," one
said. "It might be racist, but who isn't
racist to some degree? When I dated
interracially, I felt like I was betraying
my parents, whether their disapproval
was rational or not."
Others keep their relationships secret,
arguing that "It's not worth it" to fight
with parents over something so ephemer
al as a college romance.
"My biggest fear is bringing it up,
causing a problem and then having the
relationship bust up anyway," said one
student.
Huang said she has counseled several
interracial couples whose parents wanted
them to break up.
"The couples either say, 'Screw you,'
or they break up or they remain in this
constant state of stress, which may or
may not go away eventually," she said.
"They (the situations) all happen a lot."
She added that parental disapproval
initially tends to make couples — interra
cial and otherwise — closer.
"It can turn a very casual relationship
into something more serious," she said.
Peer pressure or persecution?
If parental pressure tends to strength
en relationships, peer pressure can
destroy them. But leaders of ethnic stu
dent organizations say interracial dating
is as accepted within campus groups as it
is by the general population.
"There are people who are against it in
every community, but I think overall it's
accepted," said MEChA Co-Chair Eva
Silva.
While few interracial couples come to
group meetings, many community mem
bers bring friends of other races to social
functions sponsored by the groups.
"Going into the city (for a social event)
has a different purpose than going to a
meeting for information about the Asian
community," said Asian American Stu
dent Association Vice-Chair Eleanor Lo.
But students most active in the
groups, like those who self-select into

ethnic theme dorms, are usually less like
ly to date interracially, community lead
ers say.
"The more politically active a person
is, the more problems they're going to
have with it," said one student active in
the Chicano-Latino community.
But some blame the couples them
selves for allowing themselves to be pres
sured or criticized by their peers.
"If you're uncomfortable in the rela
tionship, other people will pick up on that
and that's when they're going to say
something," said one student.
In many cases, much of the criticism
comes indirectly, through whispered epi
thets and disdainful looks.
"In minority cultures, the reaction is
much harsher, and people are more likely
to talk about you behind your back," said
an African-American woman. "You never
know what's going on in people's minds."
Another student active in the Asian-
American community broke up with her
Caucasian boyfriend in part because of
this sort of indirect peer pressure. "I felt
like I was having to explain myself too
much," she said, despite the fact that her
boyfriend did not participate in commu
nity events with her.
In many cases, discrimination against
interracial couples is more overt, espe
cially by members of the opposite sex.
One Asian-American woman said she
felt "definite hostility" from African-
American women when she started dat
ing an African-American man. "His ex
girlfriend's sorority knew all about me
and was basically out to get me," she said.
Badmouthing and blacklisting
Huang said students who date outside
their race often "go on a black list, and
then when you want to date within the
race, nobody trusts you."
"Betty," an Asian-American student,
is currently dating an African-American
man. She has dated Caucasian men in the
past, and fears that, although she would
like to date Asian men, she may never
have the chance.

'In minority cultures, the
reaction is much harsher,
and people are more
likely to talk about you
behind your back. You
never know what's going
on in people's minds.'

Asian men have voiced their disap
proval by Calling Betty " 'whitewashed,'
'cherry blossom' and every other deroga
tory name," she said.
"I know I've already been labeled as
only dating white men, even though my
current boyfriend is black," she added.
But Betty has noticed marked differ
ences between her current and past rela
tionships. "For the first time, I'm dating
someone who's more oppressed than I
am," she said. "It's been interesting."
In her previous relationships, Betty
felt discouraged by her boyfriends' lack of

understanding about racial issues.
"It's often hard enough to explain the
female experience, and adding ethnicity
to that can get really frustrating," she
said. "My current boyfriend and I don't
talk about race as much, just because he
understands."
However, Betty's parents, who disap
proved of her Caucasian boyfriends, are
even more disappointed now that she is
dating an African-American.
"Now they would totally love to see me
dating a white guy," she laughed.
Indeed, students of every ethnicity
identified certain interracial combina
tions that were more acceptable than oth
ers.
"When you're talking about interra
cial dating, there are hierarchies," said
Huang. "With African Americans, for
example, people of color are first, then
whites. With Asians, it's the opposite."
According to Huang, these distinctions
are based on everything from political
factors to physical differences, depending
on the community.
"For the African-American communi
ty, the last person they would want to
date is someone from the oppressor class,

and to this university is

happening to this
society in the next 20
or 30 years.'

because of the history of oppression," she
said.
An Indian student attributed the
prevalence of Indian-Jewish couples to
similar socio-economic backgrounds,
while a Chicano student cited skin color
as a equalizing element in interracial
relationships.
According to the 1989 University
Committee on Minority Issues report,
Asian-American and Chicano-Latino stu
dents have the most interracial relation
ships. Although Caucasians report the
most positive attitude toward interracial
dating, they have the fewest interracial
relationships, compared to other ethnic
groups.
Choice or chance?
For some students, dating someone
outside their race is a conscious choice.
For others, interracial relationships are
twists of fate.
"Julie" is an Indian-American woman
who has been casually dating a Caucasian
man for two years — without telling her
parents. She said she may never date an
Indian man because she does not con
form to what she perceives as the inher
ently sexist cultural ideal of the "submis
sive Indian woman."
A human biology major, Julie is look
ing forward to medical school and a stint
in the Peace Corps — something she
could not accomplish in a traditional
Indian marriage.
"There are so many Indian women

who have M.D.s but don't even practice
because of their husbands," she said.
In addition, Julie said her relation
ships would be much more serious if she
dated within her race.
"Indian men tend to look for wives,
because it's either that or an arranged
marriage," she said. "The concept of dat
ing someone who you're not planning to
marry is really alien to them."
While Julie's decision was premeditat
ed, "George" and "Angie" met by chance
last fall, when their unguaranteed hous
ing status inspired both of them to draw
into Casa Zapata, the Chicano-Latino
theme house.
Angie, who is Caucasian, was immedi
ately attracted to George, a Chicano, but
felt reluctant to approach him.
"I wasn't sure he would want to go out
with me because I didn't know how he
felt about interracial dating," she said.
Although George was primarily inter
ested in dating Chicanas, he agreed to go
out with Angie. The two have been dating
ever since.
"On our first date, he told me he'd
never marry a woman who wasn't Chi
cana and he couldn't believe he was
going out with a woman who wasn't Chi
cana," Angie said. "It upset me to a
degree, but at the same time, I had to
accept that.
"Of course, now he's changed his
mind," she added.
But the road to interracial romance
hasn't been without obstacles. George, a
child of "traditional Mexican Catholic
parents," felt pressured by his mother
and sister to date Chicanas.
"Moms always tend to be the moral
force of any Mexican family," he said.
"She has doubts about our relationship,
but I think any parent would."
However, George observed that inter
racial relationships are "not that big of a
deal in the Chicano-Latino community
as in the African-American community,
for example. A lot of people in Zapata
last year did have interracial relation
ships, including three people on the
staff."
Alt hough he has felt both parental and
peer pressure, "it's been so minimal that
it hasn't changed my perspective," he
said.
According to Angie, race is "not an
issue that we've dealt with and forgotten.
There are certain issues in our relation
ship that will always be issues."
For George, "it's never been a ques
tion of race but of culture, and we do have
poignant cultural differences," he said.
"The differences aren't going to create
roadblocks to our relationship, but
they're there."
In addition to cultural differences,
George and Angie have different religious
and educational backgrounds and very
different majors — civil engineering and
English, respectively. They credit Resi
dential Education with uniting their
divergent paths.
"If it weren't for theme dorms, I don't
know how we would have met," Angie
said.
With or without theme dorms,
parental approval and social sanctions,
George predicts that "what's happening
to us and to this university is what's
going to be happening to this society in
the next 20 or 30 years.
