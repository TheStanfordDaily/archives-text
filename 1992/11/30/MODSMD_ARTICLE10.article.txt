Rebels release American worker
FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) — An Ameri
can relief worker was freed unharmed by rebels
after being held for more than a month, Red Cross
officials said yesterday.
Mike O'Neill, who was working with the Sierra
Leone Red Cross to help refugees, was in a group
of people kidnapped during a rebel attack Oct. 24
on the diamond mining center of Koidu.
O'Neill, 38, of West Seneca, N.Y., was taken to the
U.S. Embassy in Freetown yesterday, Red Cross offi
cials said. Embassy officials did not comment, but
said O'Neill plans to hold a news conference today.
The Sierra Leone army, which took power in a
coup earlier this year, said in a statement that
O'Neill escaped from his captors. But according to
Red Cross officials, O'Neill and his Sierra
Leonean driver, Ali Bangura, were released by
rebel leader Foday Sankoh.
Israel denounces attacks in Germany
JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli government
yesterday denounced outbreaks of German
racism and anti-Semitism and demanded that
they be met with "the full force of the law."

In a statement following the weekly Cabinet
meeting, the government said it "strongly con
demns the neo-Nazi, racist and anti-Semitic phe
nomena in Germany, and views them with con
cern and gravity."
By discussing the issue and publishing the
strongly worded statement, the government
reflected public outrage over events in Germany,
heightened over the weekend by an Isnel televi
sion broadcast of anti-Semitic tirades by German
right-wing extremists.
The German TV report, aired here Friday night
and repeated Saturday, drew parallels between
Hitler's Germany and the current situation.
