# Venezuela president to remain
## Perez won't resign after attempted coup, despite rebel demands 
### 
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) —
President Carlos Andres Perez
defied demands for his resigna
tion yesterday in the aftermath of
a coup attempt, but conceded he
has failed to convince Venezue
lans that his policies aim to better
their lives.
Perez spoke two days after
rebel troops tried to bomb him out
of the presidential palace. The
coup attempt, which Perez blamed
on "military mafia" and "social
rejects," claimed 169 lives.
Police fired tear gas and rub
ber bullets to disperse protesters
outside a prison where at least 62
people were slain in a rebellion
that broke out during the coup
attempt, the second in 10 months.
The protesters were demanding
to know whether their incarcerat
ed relatives had died.
The Peruvian government was
considering a request for political
asylum by 93 rebel Venezuelan air
force officials, including one of the

coup leaders, who flew a C-130 Her
cules cargo plane to Iquitos, Peru,
after the coup failed. Venezuela has
demanded their extradition and the
return of the plane.
The capital remained jittery
yesterday. Perez announced that
curfews and other restrictions
imposed during the coup would be
gradually lifted by week's end,
and the military said it would be
detonating dud bombs dropped by
the rebels.
Perez has been severely criti
cized for his strict economic aus
terity measures and for failing to
improve the lot of most citizens.
Recent polls show his popularity
rating is 9 percent.
About one-fourth of Venezue
lans live in extreme poverty
despite one of the highest rates of
economic growth in the hemi
sphere. The country, the No. 3
producer in OPEC, also has suf
fered from low oil prices.
At least 1,100 suspected rebels

have been captured since Friday
when dissident air force, navy and
police factions launched the
uprising in Caracas and Maracay,
claiming to represent the poor.
In a nationally televised speech,
Perez said the coup leaders
belonged to a "military mafia" and
were joined by "social rejects"
involved in leftist guerrilla groups
in the 19605. He said he had the
firm support of the military.
Claiming the attempt was
aimed at ending 34 years of
democracy, he said his departure
from power before his five-year
term ends in early 1994 "is not an
issue, it never has been and it will
not be."
But he acknowledged that his
government has failed to convince
Venezuelans it was on an "order
ly, sincere and courageous path to
confront our errors."
He said his government has
been trying to straighten out
decades of mismanagement.
