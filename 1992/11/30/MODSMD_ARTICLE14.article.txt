## Require a sr. thesis 
### 
Stanford degrees signify
students' ability to learn
a little bit about a lot

FOUR YEARS AND 90 thou
sand dollars later, each senior
is thrust upon the world like
a bird forced out of its nest.
There is no more advising nor
financial aid, no more resident
assistants nor any of the other
helping hands Stanford extends.
"Prove thyself," is the quote of the
day each Commencement.
However, it is the motto "Jack of
all trades, master of none" that
deserves a place on the diplomas of
many Stanford graduates.
After fashioning 10 non-related
courses into a major and scraping
through the easiest courses in each
DR many students feel qualified
only as world class dilettantes:
capable of cocktailing, but unpre
pared to make a substantive, origi
nal contribution to their chosen
fields.
And as they purchase their
power suits, apply to graduate
school and suffer anxiety attacks
in the Career Planning and Place
ment Center, many seniors look
back on their Stanford career and
have to search hard for some sem
blance of focus and direction.
Most liberal arts degrees at
Stanford demonstrate that stu
dents have satisfactorily sampled
from the smorgasbord of classes
offered under such broad titles as
"Political Science," "Communica
tion," or "English." And a B.S. can
simply mean they had exceptional
memories and adapted well to rote
learning.
These factors insure that most
students will walk across the stage
in June with a weighty piece of
paper and a light sense of accom
plishment.
Requiring all students to com
plete a senior thesis or project —
as some Ivy League schools
already do — might help correct

this problem.
With the exception of a few
majors, honors theses are written
by only a fraction of students in
each department. In many cases a
good number apply but are turned
away, allowing departments to
concentrate on and honor only the
top students. But it would be just
as easy to honor top scholars
through separate departmental
prizes or by labeling their work
"honors," as is already done.
If students knew they had to
produce an original piece of work
before they graduated, it would
force them to approach their stud
ies in search of a focus. As they
sample classes within their depart
ments it is inevitable that they will
find something that spurs them to
go further. In stepping beyond the
midterm and final in this one area,
they will leave Stanford with a
concrete example of their dedica
tion and a lasting contribution to
the academic dialogue.
Theses or projects can go on to
become great things. Recent gradu
ate Michael Friedly saw his honors
work on Malcolm X published as a
book. Others have taken their the
ses and expanded on them in mas
ters and doctorate programs, creat
ing solid foundations for their future
contributions to academia. Such
individuals are likely to abound if
students are pushed to inquire
"Why?" rather than spew back the
accepted canon twice a quarter.
If structured properly, this the
sis or project could become a spe
cial addition to a student's career
rather than the bane of his exis
tence. A paper of moderate length
— 45 to 60 pages — or a feasible
project is the aim, not the monster
150-page thesis-from-hell or
search for the cure to cancer.
Not surprisingly, this push for
excellence would predictably pro
duce more self-challenging, deter
mined students. And as is evi
denced by the few who are award
ed high prizes and honors like Phi
Beta Kappa membership or
Rhodes scholarships, focus and
drive have their benefits.
