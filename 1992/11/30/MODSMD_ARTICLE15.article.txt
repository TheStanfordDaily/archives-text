Graduate students still face housing problems

IN THE NOVEMBER 18TH Daily,
Housing Center Director Bill
Georges obscured the magnitude of
the problems with graduate student
housing. While the addition of graduate
spaces to the graduate housing pool is
good news, it hardly solves all of the
housing problem. In particular, the pres
ence of unoccupied units don't mean
there is a glut of graduate student hous
ing.
The additional Crothers Memorial
and Escondido Village high rise spaces
won't solve the graduate housing short
age. Since the opening of Rains in 1988-
89, the proportion of the graduate stu
dent population housed on campus has
dropped every year. In 1988-89, 45.5
percent of the graduate population lived
on campus. Since 50 graduate student
spaces are unused at this time, the per
centage of the graduate student popula
tion currently housed is 40.2 percent.
With an additional 50 spaces next

year, and assuming 100 percent occu
pancy, the proportion of graduate stu
dents being housed will drop to 40 per
cent next year, because of increased
graduate student enrollment.
Three ill-conceived housing policies
have led to under-utilized graduate res
idences in the EV highrises and Man
zanita Trailers, despite a shortage of
graduate student housing.
1. First-year students are given
automatic housing priority. Georges
does not reveal how many students who
refused assigned housing were first
year students unwilling to live in the
accommodations offered. Two randomly
assigned graduate students should not
be placed in a one-bedroom, cinder
block highrise. Most 25-year-olds
expect more privacy than they enjoyed
as freshmen.
2. Georges asserts that some contin
uing students "Gave up looking for
housing on-campus early," and for good

reason. Waiting for a walk-on housing
assignment means enduring consider
able hassle and risk. Students are
kicked out of campus housing for two
weeks at the end of the summer —
forcing them to find a temporary place
to store their things and live while
waiting for a space in a trailer to open
up.
As part of their budget-reduction
plan, the Housing Center dropped one
round of the summer wait-list alloca
tion. This forced students to look for
housing off campus, rather than risk
finding themselves out in the cold with
no affordable options once the school
year started.
There is a pressing need for a re
examination of the current housing
allocation policy, which grants first pri
ority to new graduate students. The
current consequence of this policy is
that underfunded doctoral students are
forced off campus so that some of the

University's schools can increase rev
enues by bringing "full-paying" mas
ters students to Stanford.
Co-term students, who hardly need
time to get "adjusted" to Stanford life,
live in Rains, while other graduate stu
dents seek affordable housing in Red
wood City and Mountain View. Accord
ing to figures provided by the Housing
Office, 98 more continuing graduate
students were denied housing in last
spring's lottery than the year before.
At a budget retreat for the Universi
ty Cabinet last year, the administration
acknowledged that the housing alloca
tion policy needed review. To date noth
ing has been done. Thanks to the
administration's inattention, this prob
lem will remain until at least the '94-
'95 academic year.
