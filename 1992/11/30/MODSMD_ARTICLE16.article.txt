# How Housing Center can help graduate students
## 
### 
There are some simple steps that the
Housing Center can take to ensure there
will continue to be a surplus of housing
for single graduate students in future
years, even if the number of new gradu
ate students continues to increase faster
than the number of on-campus graduate
housing spaces. Here are two sugges
tions.
1. This year, the number of wait-list
housing assignment rounds held during
the summer was reduced from two to
one. The Housing Center should contin
ue this process and eliminate the
remaining mid-August wait-list round.
Better yet, eliminate the initial
assignment round in May as well, and
assign all single graduate student hous

ing in the walk-in round. This will also
help relieve the budget deficit by saving
the cost of administering these clearly
superfluous housing assignment rounds.
2. The walk-in assignment round is
now held at the end of September, only
one month after unassigned students
are required to move out of campus
housing. If walk-ins are held at the end
of October instead, unassigned students
will have more time to consider whether
they want to live on- or off-campus, and
won't have to choose to live on-campus
too hastily.
Both of these measures will help
insure that fewer single graduate stu
dents choose to live on campus merely
because they are too stingy to pay off
campus rents or are too lazy to find off
campus housing and commute a few
miles a day. It will also guarantee that a
larger percentage of those who choose to
live on campus do so because of the won-
