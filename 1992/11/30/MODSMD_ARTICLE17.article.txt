# Bringing back the 'F' is only one grading issue
## 
### 
The headline on the Nov. 13 Daily's
lead story, "The Return of the 'F'?,"
may divert attention from the core issue
in the coming discussion of Stanford's
grading system.
There are many operational details of
the University's grading system that can
be debated. What grades should we
have? What should be the latest date for
dropping a course?
But the core issue underneath all this
is a basic one: wheather Stanford should
have a "historical transcript" that
records, honestly and completely, what

really happened during a student's stay
at the University; or wheather we
should have, as at present, only a
record-of-accomplishment transcript,
which records all those activities suc
cessfully completed and nothing else.
The opinions of both students and
faculty on all aspects of the grading sys
tem will, I believe, be welcomed and lis
tened to by Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement and the Fac
ulty Senate.
But let's be particularly clear on the
most basic issue: are the needs of the
students, of the University and of soci
ety as a whole best met by a historical
transcript or by a transcript of accom
plishment?
Deciding on this basic issue will make
it easier to settle many of the more sec
ondary issues.
