## Studying racial differences 
### 
Tk y EVER BET ON THE WHITE
IXI guy." Leslie Nielsen's gam-
Jl bling advice earns a chuckle
from the audience. Movies like "White
Men Can't Jump" wink at us for 90 min
utes. We laugh.
It's a subject people are willing to joke
about, but are afraid to examine serious
ly. Discussion of racial differences is
taboo today, and the idea that some eth
nicities may have a genetic advantage in
athletics is one that earns a lot of criti
cism. Just ask Jimmy the Greek.
The uneasiness is understandable.
There is a historically accurate fear that
bigots will take the opportunity to try to
compare mental differences between the
races as well. But today we must have faith
in our ability to reject racist pseudo-science,
and forge forward with legitimate research
in fields that have racial significance.
Genetic physical differences obviously
exist between the races. Skin color aside,
the facial structures of whites, blacks and
Asians are distinct and easy to identify.
The possibility that some traits linked
to athleticism may be likewise inherited
shouldn't be that big of a leap, but the
hypothesis draws so much fire that many
U.S. scientists shy away from the subject;
foreign laboratories produce all of the
leading research in this field.
What they find isn't shocking. In a
"Runner's World" report, individuals of
West African heritage (like many Ameri

can blacks) were found to generally have
less body fat, narrower hips, thicker
thighs, longer legs and lighter calves than
whites. All are attributes favorable for
jumping and sprinting.
Blacks also generally have much
denser bones than whites, which may go
a long way towards explaining why no
black swimmer has ever qualified for the
U.S. Olympic swimming team.
Dedication, discipline, skill and sup
port are much more important than
physique when determining success. But
at the world-class level, where athletes
are separated by hundredths of seconds
and fractions of inches, the impact of
physique is genuine.
The Japanese combine a passion for
sports with a culture that is one of the
world's most dedicated and hard-working
— but as a race they're one of the world's
shortest. It comes as no surprise then
that people of Japanese ancestry experi
ence relative success in sports that
reward small stature, such as distance
running, ice skating and gymnastics.
We don't expect to hear, "Jordan's
shot blocked by Morimoto, recovered by
Yamaguchi. .. . Pass to Tanaka. .. . Back
to Yamaguchi, and OH! What a slam over
Scottie Pippin!" Not impossible, but not
too likely either.
If we conclude that racial differences
are a secondary issue when evaluating
athletic success, that's great. But to come

to that conclusion, we must first
acknowledge that differences do exist.
It's not a racist argument, designed to
detract from the accomplishments of ath
letes from different ethnicities.
I don't think of Carl Lewis as the lucky
beneficiary of "super" genes — I simply
consider him the greatest Olympian who
ever lived. He's worked harder over a
longer period of time than any competi
tor in any other sport I can think of.
At the same time, I have to smile when
former Stanford track coach Brooks
Johnson says, "I'm going to find a white
Carl Lewis. They're all over the place."
Good luck.
We can't be afraid to examine this
issue because of racial sensitivity. Geneti
cist Claude Bouchard was once asked
what could possibly be gained by research
on racial differences. He replied, "Well, I
have always worked with the hypothesis
that ignorance fosters prejudice. And
that knowledge is the greatest safeguard
against prejudice."
Leslie may be more eloquent, but
Claude speaks more truth.
