# MS therapy from Stanford research?

An experiment conducted by re
searchers at the Stanford School of
Medicine may hold the key to a fu
ture treatment for multiple sclero
sis and other autoimmune diseases.
In tests on laboratory mice, a
team of researchers headed by Im
munology and Rheumatology
Prof. C. Garrison Fathman has
been able to stop the progress of
experimental allergic en
cephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse
disease that is very similar to mul
tiple sclerosis in humans.
This similarity, Fathman said,
gives "absolute hope" that a simi
lar procedure may not only treat
multiple sclerosis, but eventually
lead to therapies for other autoim
mune diseases including types of
diabetes and arthritis. The experi
menters' results were reported in
Friday's Science magazine.
According to Fathman, multi
ple sclerosis, or MS, is an autoim
mune disease in which a person's
immune system — which normal
ly fights disease — turns against
the body and causes damage. In
the case of MS, the damage comes
from the destruction of myelin,
one of four proteins that coats
nerve cells.
The disease affects about
300,000 Americans, Fathman said,
and can cause clumsiness, double
vision, bowel and bladder dysfunc
tions and muscle spasms, and in
later stages may confine patients to
wheelchairs or make swallowing
difficult.

"It is life-threatening, and it
certainly changes the lifestyle,"
Fathman said of MS.
EAE, the disease Fathman's
group halted in mice, is like MS in
that it also attacks and destroys
myelin.
The doctors were able to treat
EAE with an injection of peptides
— conglomerates of amino acids
— derived from a protein called
myelin basic protein. The shots
stopped the destruction of the
myelin in mice.
Interestingly, it is not only
what is injected, but the way it is
injected, that makes the treat
ment effective. According to Fath
man, the peptides actually cause
EAE when they are injected in an
immunogenic fashion — that is,
when they are accompanied by a
substance such as mineral oil that
inflames the immune system. In
this case, a type of white blood
cells called T cells respond to the
injection by prompting EAE.
"That T cell is sort of the or
chestra leader of the chain of
events that leads to demyeliza
tion," said Fathman. "When you
get a shot . .. the T cell starts all of
the immune response."
But when the same injection is
given non-immunogenically —
without agents added to inflame
the system — it works against
EAE instead of causing it, for rea
sons unknown to the researchers.
This type of injection stopped the
progress of the disease in mice al
ready infected with EAE and did
