## Water polo title hopes come to splashing halt Cal takes third straight NCAA crown with 12-11, triple-overtime victory 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Stanford's water polo team fell one
point shy of a seventh national title in the
finals of the NCAA Championship Tour
nament in Long Beach last night. The Car
dinal entered the tourney hoping for
another shot at top-seeded California, a
team which hadn't lost this year. Unfortu
nately, the Bears didn't lose Sunday
either.
Seventh seed and NCAA newcomer
Princeton provided the first obstacle in
Stanford's march to the finals. The Cardi
nal, however, was not about to allow the
Ivy League power to become the first East
Coast team to beat a West Coast team in
the 24-year history of the NCAAs. The
Tigers in Stanford's path amounted to lit
tle more than roadkill as the Cardinal ran
over their opponents 18-5 in quarterfinal
action Friday.

This wasn't textbook water
polo. It was emotion and
guts.'
— Cal head coach Steve Heaston

For almost every Princeton score, the
Cardinal responded with multiple goals of
its own. The Tigers' early 1-0 advantage
awoke Stanford, which retaliated with two
strikes by senior Chris Smith and junior
Antonio Busquets. A penalty shot by
senior John Matarangas gave the Cardinal
a 3-1 lead to end the first quarter. Stan
ford continued its dominance into the sec
ond period, outscoring Princeton 5-3 for
an 8-4 halftime lead.
All the second half glories also belonged
to the Cardinal, as it pulled away with a
10-1 performance. Stanford opened the
third quarter with five unanswered points.
Matarangas scored twice, including a
penalty shot, junior Chris Wallin and
freshman Josh Leachman capitalized on
two six-on-five power play situations, and
senior captain Chip Blankenhorn added
one goal of his own.
Princeton temporarily disrupted the
onslaught via a last-minute score with 27
ticks left in the third, but the Cardinal had
the last five laughs. Smith, sophomores
Dan Hancock and Bill Maguy, junior Brian
Clemens and freshman Jeremy Laster
each tacked on one point to Stanford's 13-
5 third quarter lead to give the Cardinal its
18-5 victory.
Ten Stanford players scored in all,
paced by Busquets' four and Matarangas'
three goals.
The reserves used the previous day pro
vided the rest that the starters needed for
the Cardinal's back-to-back semifinal con
frontation with third-seeded USC on Sat
urday. Behind the scoring of Blankenhorn,
Wallin, and Matarangas, who each scored
two goals, the Cardinal held off the Tro-

Jans to enter intermission with a 7-4
advantage. Wallin eventually spearheaded
Stanford to a 11-7 win by scoring his
game-high third point in the third quarter.
The Cardinal survived its semifinal chal
lenge knowing all along that No. 1 Califor
nia had already reached the final, having
defeated fourth-ranked UC-Irvine 8-5 in
its semifinal encounter.
So the stage was then set for Sunday
evening. Stanford would vie for its seventh
national title in 17 years, while the Bears
would try for their third straight and 11th
overall crown in a rematch of the 1990
final. After three grueling overtimes,
threepeat it was. Cal captured the 1992
NCAA championship and completed its
first-ever perfect season at 31-0 by slip
ping past the Cardinal, 12-11.
"Both teams spilled their guts out,"
said Stanford head coach Dante Detta
manti. California head coach Steve Heast
on concurred.
"This wasn't textbook water polo," he
said. "It was emotion and guts."
Dettamanti has often said that the sign
of a great team is the ability to come from
behind. That's exactly what the Cardinal
did.
For most of the first half and part of the
third quarter, the Bears dominated Stan
ford, which had to compete without the
services of injured sophomore All-Ameri
can and team scoring leader Wolf Wigo for
the entire tournament. At one point in the
third period, the Cardinal found them
selves trailing by as much as 9-3.
"That was our wake-up call," Detta
manti said. "We had to change our tactics.
We started pressing and stealing the ball.
The strategy worked."
Indeed, Stanford scored three quick
goals in the third to enter the final period
down 9-6. Another Cardinal resurrection
would occur with 2:38 remaining in the
game and Stanford trailing 11-8. Busquets
cashed in on a penalty shot, and sopho
more Frank Schneider followed 16 seconds
later with a goal of his own. Then, with 26
ticks left in regulation, Blankenhorn
scored the tying point off a deflected shot
to send the championship into overtime at
11-11.
Neither team scored in the two extra
quarters, although~severkf attempts hit
the crossbars of both goal cages.
But the Cardinal comeback simply was
not enough. With 1:18 remaining in the
third and deciding overtime, Cal's German
Olympic team member Dirk Zeien cata
pulted a shot past Stanford's junior goalie
Larry Bercutt for the championship.
Blankenhorn, who made the all-tourna
ment first team along with Bercutt, led the
Cardinal with three goals, while Busquets,
Matarangas, and Schneider each con
tributed two of their own. Smith and
Wallin also added one goal each. Zeien's
five points paced the Bears to their 13th
straight victory over Stanford in the last
three years.
"I feel like we played well enough to
win," Dettamanti said. "I'm proud of these
guys."

So close
yet...
Despite the efforts of senior
Chris Smith (above) and coach
Dante Dettamanti (left), the
Stanford Cardinal water polo
team fell short in a bid for its
first NCAA Championship since
1986. After demolishing Prince
ton 18-5 in the quarterfinals and
besting third-seeded USC 11-7
in the semis, the second
ranked Cardinal was topped by
No. 1 California for the fourth
time this season in a heart
breaking final rematch last *
night.
