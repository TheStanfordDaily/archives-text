### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
While most Stanford students spent last weekend
eating turkey leftovers and preparing for a fast
approaching finals week, the No. 2 Stanford
women's volleyball team was busy tuning up its
game in preparation for the 1992 NCAA Division I
Women's Volleyball Tournament. And they can't
wait for these Finals.
Stanford (26-2, 16-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
finished off the regular season last weekend by win
ning the Banker's Classic Championship in Stock
ton. On Friday, the Cardinal took all of 50 minutes
to polish off No. 13 UC-Santa Barbara in straight
games, 15-3, 15-7, 15-5. The following night, Stan
ford clinched the tournament title with a three
game win over No. 4 Pacific, 15-9, 17-15, 15-6.
Senior tri-captain Bev Oden was also named the
tournament's Outstanding Player.
Stanford had little problem with Santa Barbara
in the first round, as they held the Gauchos to a dis
mal .052 team hitting percentage on the night,
including a - .026 average in the first game. Oden led
the Cardinal in the match, hitting .478 with 14 kills,
six digs, and seven blocks. Freshman hitter Cary
Wendell posted solid numbers in nearly every cate
gory, tallying eight kills, 13 digs, two blocks, three
aces, and a .316 hitting average.
Senior Kristi Paaso added six kills and seven digs,
while sophomore Anne Wicks blazed to a .500 hit
ting percentage with five kills and three blocks.
Senior tri-captain Carrie Feldman also racked up 26
assists in directing the team to victory.
Santa Barbara was led by hitter Ana Elisa Franca,
who hit .208 with nine kills and nine digs in the
match. Hitters Heather Collins and Kristie Ryan each
added six kills for the Gauchos in the losing effort.
Friday's win over UCSB advanced Stanford to the
championship match against Pacific. After a slow
start, Stanford rolled over the Tigers in three
straight games, putting together .340 and .400 team
hitting averages in the second and third games to
close out the match.
Wendell and Oden again paced the Cardinal
attack. Wendell hit .406 with 14 kills and seven digs,
while Oden posted a .242 average with 13 kills,ll
digs, and three blocks on the match. Feldman had a
superb game from the setter position, pouring in 41
assists.
Wicks, Paaso, and freshman Wendy Hromadka

each contributed six kills to the Cardinal effort, with
Hromadka adding six digs and a .357 hitting average.
For the Tigers, outside hitter Vikki Simonis led
the team in kills with 12, but could only muster a
.050 hitting percentage. Hitter Katy Eldridge hit
.333 with 11 kills, while hitter Lisa Barbieri added
10 kills and a .208 average. On the match, the Car
dinal outhit Pacific as a team, .283 to .204.

Sunday, the much-awaited NCAA Women's Vol
leyball Tournament seedings were announced, and
Stanford garnered the No. 2 spot behind top-ranked
UCLA. Because of an NCAA rule prohibiting the
Nos. 1 and 2 teams from playing in the same region,
Stanford was moved out of the West Regional and
made the No. 1 seed in the Mideast Regional. Illinois
(30-3), seeded second in the Mideast, will host the
Regional Dec. 10-13 if it can survive Ohio State (21-
8) in the first round. Otherwise, Nebraska (21-5)
will host the Regional, if it can top Colorado (22-8) in
the first round.
As expected, Stanford will host its first-round
match this weekend. The Cardinal will face Big East
champion Pittsburgh (18-13) at Maples Pavilion on
Friday, Dec. 4 at 7:30 p.m. Tickets for the match go on
sale today at the Stanford Athletic Department ticket
office, and seating is on a general admission basis.
The winner of Friday's match will travel to the
Mideast Regional to face the winner of Thursday's
Penn State-Notre Dame match on Dec. 10. The
Mideast Regional champion will advance to the
Final Four in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which will
be held Dec. 17-18.
Because of the tournament structure this year,
Stanford cannot meet No. 1 UCLA until the Final
Four, where the Cardinal would have a chance to
avenge its two regular season losses to the Bruins in
the NCAA Tournament Final on Dec. 18.
And that's a Final Stanford hopes to ace.
