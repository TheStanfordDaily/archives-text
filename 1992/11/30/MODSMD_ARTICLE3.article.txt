# After controversial termination, Reges reflects on case, future
## 
### Jeff Brock Editorial staff 
Ayear and a half after creating a firestorm
of debate and controversy over his views on
drug use and personal freedom, former se
nior lecturer Stuart Reges is enjoying his
time outside the limelight — and basking in
the year's severance pay he received for not
suing the University over his termination.
The ex-computer science teacher, who
has been living in Washington, D.C. since
January, is using the money to pursue per
sonal interests such as writing and working
for the Libertarian Party. But he acknowl
edges with regret that his career in educa
tion may be finished.
"It does seem fairly clear that I'm not
going to be able to get a job teaching in this
country," he said last week. "I find it amaz
ingly ironic. There's supposed to be this
great crisis in education. I have a math de
gree, a computer science graduate degree,
I'm supposed to be a good teacher."

Reges was a popular instructor whose ac
colades included a 1985 Lloyd W. Dinkel
spiel Award for Outstanding Service to Un
dergraduate Education. He was fired in
May 1991 for carrying illegal drugs on cam
pus, allowing underage students to buy al
coholic beverages at an off-campus dinner
he funded, and refusing to promise not to
carry illegal drugs in his backpack on cam
pus in the future.
Although no University official ever saw
the drugs in the infamous backpack, Reges
had admitted in two November 1990 letters
to The Daily and a March 1990 letter to na
tional drug czar Bob Martinez that he car
ried illegal drugs on campus to protest U.S.
drug policy. His claim was never physically
verified.
The taunting letter to Martinez protest
ed the government's "coercion" of universi
ties through the 1989 Drug-Free Schools
and Communities Act — which stipulates
that universities must implement drug and
alcohol policies to receive federal funds —

and Stanford's hypocrisy in complying with
a policy with which it did not agree.
He also told Martinez that an undergrad
uate had come to him for advice on whether
he should experiment with the drug MDA,
and that Reges had suggested he try it.
Martinez' threatening response to then-
University President Donald Kennedy
prompted Reges' placement on administra
tive leave, followed by a three-week Univer
sity investigation into Reges' claims.
Reges lapped up the national media cir
cus, calling it "one of the best parts [of the
episode]" in an interview last week. The most
unusual element about his case, he said, was
that so much attention was paid to it.
Many other cases are buried, he said, not
ing that a University of Virginia student
who sold two hits of LSD outside his frater
nity house was sentenced to 13 months in
prison without parole because the house lay
within 1,000 feet of a school.
"The government wanted coverage," he
said. "They purposely gave information to

the press. If somebody was passing around
my letters, it wasn't me."
Reges said there is only thing he would
consider doing differently: "If I had known
Martinez was willing to take me up on my
advice, I would not have claimed to carry
drugs. I would have pursued [the issue of
free] speech completely. This way the Uni
versity had an excuse to fire me."
After his termination in May, he consid
ered pursuing a lawsuit against the Univer
sity to regain his position. But last Novem
ber "we settled our differences," he said.
"They paid me an extra year's severance pay
in agreement not to sue."
Reges said he and the University signed a
confidentiality agreement, and neither he
nor Dean of the School of Engineering
James Gibbons — who fired Reges — would
comment on the exact amount.
The money, combined with cash from the
sale of his house in Virginia, allowed him to

move to Washington, D.C. and
devote time to writing. Currently
he is writing for Liberty maga
zine, hoping to get some articles
published in the monthly maga
zine Reason and working on a
couple of book ideas. "When the
money starts running out I'll find
something else to do," he said.
Although he hasn't done much
searching for jobs, he indicated an
interest in teaching in Australia, a
country which he acknowledged
does not having a very strong
teaching system.
Reges hasn't mitigated his views
on the positive benefits of drugs.
"My drug experiences have been
some of the most important in my
spiritual and intellectual develop
ment," he told The Daily in April

1991. He says now, "I still feel I am
a much better person for experi
menting with drugs. But I haven't
been using drugs anytime recently."
The move to Washington has
proven a successful one for Reges.
"I actually like it a lot more than
San Francisco," said Reges, who
returned briefly last year to
attend Commencement. "I was
really surprised. 1 always thought
of the crime," he said.
He is taken with the atmo
sphere and flavor of Washington
life. "San Francisco is very
diverse, but D.C. is very cos
mopolitan, which is different.
There are a lot of very cultured
people in the district," he said.
"It's very bohemian. San Francis
co is more debauched. In San
Francisco, everything goes."
Reges, who is gay, said he
hasn't taken much of an activist
role in the capitol's gay communi
ty. "Washington is kind of an odd

place. The gay community doesn't
do a lot here. They are very non-
Libertarian. They're into hate
crimes legislation."
He said he had been working to
place an initiative on the city bal
lot to get rid of some "really
absurd" laws regulating sexual
behavior, such as sodomy, but a
recent shift on the city council
means the law will probably be
struck down anyway next year.
Reges flirted with the political
system this year, working at the
national headquarters of the Lib
ertarian Party. "It's very difficult
to Fight the two-party system,"
said Reges, who believes in limit
ing government intrusion into pri
vate lives or the economy. "The
two throw up all sorts of barriers."
Although his job was "relative
ly boring" work ("I was stuffing
envelopes and posting mail"),
Reges said his experience with the
party was enjoyable. Although he

has been asked to serve as the
group's national director, he said
he wants to be involved with the
party only as a member.
He anticipates that Bill Clinton
will "spend money on (drug] treat
ment, less on enforcement." Reges
said he intends to write another
letter to the person Clinton choos
es to replace Martinez, but he
doesn't know yet what he'll write.
Government intrusion into
what Reges considers personal
affairs continues, he said. He
mentioned recent cases such as a
Ventura rancher who was shot in
a marijuana raid in which no
drugs were found and a 19-year
old Virginia resident who was sen
tenced to 19 years in prison with
out parole for serving as a middle
man in high-level LSD purchases.
"Many murderers don't spent
19 years in prison," Reges said.
"They don't have mandatory sen
tences like drug criminals."
