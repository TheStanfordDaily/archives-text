# World AIDS Day to raise awareness
## Service, residence workshops bring issue home to Stanford 
### June Melgaard Staff writer 
Today, 12 million people worldwide are infected
with the HIV virus, and 2 million have AIDS, accord
ing to a recent report by the World Health Organiza
tion. By the the year 2000,40 million will be infected,
and more than 12 million will have the disease.
In response to this growing international crisis,
Stanford's AIDS awareness groups have joined to
gether to organize World AIDS Day events around
campus today and tomorrow, focusing attention on
the disease and its victims.
Growing exasperated at the lack of communica
tion between campus AIDS groups, second-year
Business School student Terry Rouman coordinated
the AIDS Awareness Coalition two weeks ago.
"I thought there should be a day where people
should wear ribbons, and more importantly, I would

like everyone on campus to know about AIDS on
World AIDS Day," said Rouman about his motiva
tion.
The schedule of events opens with a non-sectarian
commemorative service at Memorial Church today at
noon. The service is intended to provide a positive
outlook for a future with greater understanding
about the disease.
In the evening, educational workshops — such as
AIDS 101 and Rubber Ware parties — will be taken to
residences around campus. Their purpose is to edu
cate students about the nature of HFV, prevention
and testing, and will be led by HIV peer counselors,
Rouman said.
Tomorrow, events will begin at 7:30 a.m. in room 53
of the Graduate School of Business, which will receive
the nation-wide transmission of the teleconference
