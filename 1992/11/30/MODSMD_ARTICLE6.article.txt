# World AIDS Day to raise awareness
## Service, residence workshops bring issue home to Stanford 
### June Melgaard Staff writer 
Today, 12 million people worldwide are infected
with the HIV virus, and 2 million have AIDS, accord
ing to a recent report by the World Health Organiza
tion. By the the year 2000,40 million will be infected,
and more than 12 million will have the disease.
In response to this growing international crisis,
Stanford's AIDS awareness groups have joined to
gether to organize World AIDS Day events around
campus today and tomorrow, focusing attention on
the disease and its victims.
Growing exasperated at the lack of communica
tion between campus AIDS groups, second-year
Business School student Terry Rouman coordinated
the AIDS Awareness Coalition two weeks ago.
"I thought there should be a day where people
should wear ribbons, and more importantly, I would

like everyone on campus to know about AIDS on
World AIDS Day," said Rouman about his motiva
tion.
The schedule of events opens with a non-sectarian
commemorative service at Memorial Church today at
noon. The service is intended to provide a positive
outlook for a future with greater understanding
about the disease.
In the evening, educational workshops — such as
AIDS 101 and Rubber Ware parties — will be taken to
residences around campus. Their purpose is to edu
cate students about the nature of HFV, prevention
and testing, and will be led by HIV peer counselors,
Rouman said.
Tomorrow, events will begin at 7:30 a.m. in room 53
of the Graduate School of Business, which will receive
the nation-wide transmission of the teleconference
"Business Responds to AIDS,"
organized by the national Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta.
The teleconference will involve
corporate executives commenting
on the way business has reacted
to AIDS, and how it can partici
pate in the battle against the dis
ease, said Business School stu
dent LaVonne Chandler Senanou.
The conference will be shown
again at 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.
At 9 a.m., 11 a.m. and 5 p.m.
the "Los Altos Story" — which
tells the story of how AIDS affects
a member of a local Rotary Club
— will be shown in the same loca
tion. Discussions will follow each
showing.
At 10 a.m. a tree-planting cere
mony will take place outside the
Stanford Museum of Art, led by
Director Tom Seligman. The
planting is part of an agreement
first implemented last year to
plant a tree every year until a
cure for AIDS is found, according
to Rouman.
At 12:15 p.m., members of the
Stanford Performance Workshop
will dance in White Plaza to raise
awareness about AIDS.
Staff members can attend a
brown bag lunch in CERAS room
34, where "Common Threads:
Stories from the Quilt" will be
shown. Participants are encour
aged to forego lunch and make a
corresponding monetary contri
bution to the Aris Project, which

is the AIDS center for Santa
Clara County, Rouman said.
Throughout the two days,
tables distributing red ribbons
will be erected around campus.
Volunteers will provide condoms,
information about AIDS, testing
and volunteer opportunities. A
$2 contribution is requested for
Ellipse Peninsula AIDS, the San
Mateo County AIDS center, as
well as a donation of used blue
jeans — particularly Levis 501s
— which will be sold to raise
funds.
According to Rouman, the
campus coalition objected to a
larger single event because such
gatherings are not inclusive
enough.
"Big events tend to attract all
the undergraduates, but tend to
exclude graduate students," he
said.
Around the nation, World
AIDS Day will be commemorated
in a variety of ways. In San Fran
cisco, as well as in other major
cities, the skyline will be dimmed
between 7:45 and 8:00 p.m., and
art will be shrouded in museums.
In certain instances, AIDS
exhibits will take the place of art
exhibits for the day, Rouman
said.
The AIDS Awareness Coalition
has already begun to think about
events for AIDS Awareness Week
in early March. According to
Rouman they are considering a
permanent memorial on campus
and are hoping to attract a part of
the now-gargantuan AIDS memo
rial quilt. The coalition is open to
suggestions, he said.

"Business Responds to AIDS,"
organized by the national Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta.
The teleconference will involve
corporate executives commenting
on the way business has reacted
to AIDS, and how it can partici
pate in the battle against the dis
ease, said Business School stu
dent LaVonne Chandler Senanou.
The conference will be shown
again at 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.
At 9 a.m., 11 a.m. and 5 p.m.
the "Los Altos Story" — which
tells the story of how AIDS affects
a member of a local Rotary Club
— will be shown in the same loca
tion. Discussions will follow each
showing.
At 10 a.m. a tree-planting cere
mony will take place outside the
Stanford Museum of Art, led by
Director Tom Seligman. The
planting is part of an agreement
first implemented last year to
plant a tree every year until a
cure for AIDS is found, according
to Rouman.
At 12:15 p.m., members of the
Stanford Performance Workshop
will dance in White Plaza to raise
awareness about AIDS.
Staff members can attend a
brown bag lunch in CERAS room
34, where "Common Threads:
Stories from the Quilt" will be
shown. Participants are encour
aged to forego lunch and make a
corresponding monetary contri
bution to the Aris Project, which

is the AIDS center for Santa
Clara County, Rouman said.
Throughout the two days,
tables distributing red ribbons
will be erected around campus.
Volunteers will provide condoms,
information about AIDS, testing
and volunteer opportunities. A
$2 contribution is requested for
Ellipse Peninsula AIDS, the San
Mateo County AIDS center, as
well as a donation of used blue
jeans — particularly Levis 501s
— which will be sold to raise
funds.
According to Rouman, the
campus coalition objected to a
larger single event because such
gatherings are not inclusive
enough.
"Big events tend to attract all
the undergraduates, but tend to
exclude graduate students," he
said.
Around the nation, World
AIDS Day will be commemorated
in a variety of ways. In San Fran
cisco, as well as in other major
cities, the skyline will be dimmed
between 7:45 and 8:00 p.m., and
art will be shrouded in museums.
In certain instances, AIDS
exhibits will take the place of art
exhibits for the day, Rouman
said.
The AIDS Awareness Coalition
has already begun to think about
events for AIDS Awareness Week
in early March. According to
Rouman they are considering a
permanent memorial on campus
and are hoping to attract a part of
the now-gargantuan AIDS memo
rial quilt. The coalition is open to
suggestions, he said.
