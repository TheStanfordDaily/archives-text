Stanford students, faculty and
staff will spread the holiday spirit
to the Peninsula's needy with the
1992 Stanford Holiday Sharing
Drive, which starts today.
For the next 12 days, the Uni
versity community will collect food,
toys, household items and clothing
under the direction of the Stanford
Volunteer Network, which is coor
dinating the effort with five local
public service agencies, according
to senior Main Dupar, the net
work's special projects co-director.
"This drive is of immense impor
tance to the community agencies,"
Dupar said. "I was astonished how
many people they support — over
10,000 families in this area."
The agencies include the Urban

Ministry of Palo Alto, St. Francis of
Assisi Church of the St. Vincent de
Paul Society, San Mateo Communi
ty Services Agency, Mid Peninsula
Support for Battered Women and
the Ecumenical Hunger Project.
One concern voiced by Dupar is
that people may assume that since
the whole campus is giving, they
do not need to.
"(Stanford students] are some
times ignorant of the immense
need of these services," she said.
To collect the donated items,
community service representa
tives will place donation boxes in
dorms, in the Bechtel Internation
al Center and in some academic
departments. They will bring the
donations together on Dec. 11.
In association with the holiday
drive, the Black Student Union is

sponsoring a "Kwanzaa in the Com
munity" food drive to coincide with
Kwanzaa, a nationally celebrated
African-American harvest holiday.
Dorms were given a grocery list and
asked to set aside about $25 of their
funds for these groceries, according
to senior Tracy Clay, the BSU's
community service chair.
This is the first year the BSU
has sponsored this food drive, said
Clay, who came up with the idea
after working with the homeless
in East Palo Alto.
"I recognized the great need in
the area," she said.
Volunteers will drop the food
off this Friday and Clay hopes for
a good turnout. "People were very
receptive to the idea — they really
want to help their community,"
she said.
