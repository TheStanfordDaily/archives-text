# A 						colorful couple
## Dynamic duo of deans discusses dating diversely, mixed marriage 
### Kimberly Chrisman Senior staff writer 
Despite — or perhaps because
of — their high visibility in vari
ous campus communities, many
students don't even know that
Dean of Students Michael Jack
son and Assoc. Dean of Memorial
Church Diana Akiyama are mar
ried.
But, notwithstanding their
busy schedules, Stanford's most
prominent interracial couple has
been happily married for a year
and a half, during which time
they've shared many of the prob
lems faced by students in inter
racial relationships.
Like many student couples,
Jackson, who is African-Ameri
can, and Akiyama, who is
Japanese-American, met at
Stanford when Akiyama joined
the staff four years ago. Both had
been previously married, Akiya
ma to a Caucasian and Jackson
to an African-American.
Although Jackson's family was
supportive of their relationship,
Akiyama's grandmother was ini
tially disappointed that she mar
ried a African-American man.
"It's not like she was trying to
exercise any kind of control,"
Akiyama said. "She just didn't
understand. That was difficult
for me, not because I agreed with
her but because she couldn't get
beyond her very old-fashioned
way of thinking."
Both Jackson and Akiyama
said they felt that their previous
interracial relationships helped
to prepare their families for the
marriage. In addition, the couple
gets along well with both families
when they're together, according
to Jackson.

'What tends to come
up more and more is
that an individual is
very insecure about
their racial identity. If
you haven't worked
that through, it's
very difficult to
challenge that.'
— Diana Akiyama

"We don't live a 'Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner' kind of life,"
he said.
Although Jackson said he has
never felt "oppressed" during
his marriage, he said they have
experienced racism on other
occasions.
"If people are going to behave
in a racist fashion to you, they're
going to do it regardless of the
relationship you're in," Akiyama
said. "Which isn't to say that
race isn't an issue. There are dif
ferences between the Japanese-
American community and the
black community."
She cited language barriers
and cultural conflicts as two
major differences.
"When there's definitely a
clash of cultures, we talk about
it," she said. "We have to talk
about it."
While students in interracial
relationships face similar cultur
al barriers, Jackson said they
may also be fearful of being per
ceived as rejecting their own

community.
"Communities are perme
able," he said. "That is, one can
go in and out of one's home com
munity. Folks should under
stand that one doesn't give up
one's membership in anything."
For example, Jackson said he
and Akiyama are "in and out of
the black community, the Asian
community and a lot of other
communities on campus."
Indeed, Akiyama often coun
sels students who are involved in

interracial relationships or who
are children of interracial rela
tionships.
"Because I'm older, relatively
speaking, I bring a certain
amount of experience and reflec
tion upon the kinds of issues or
concerns they might have," she
said. "They don't expect me to
have all the answers, but they
think I will probably understand
their fears and confusion."
In high school, Akiyama was
"really adamantly" against inter

racial dating. However, she now
sees such prejudice as "a smoke
screen for not dealing with one's
own issues of maturity."
"What tends to come up more
and more is that an individual is
very insecure about their racial
identity," she said. "If you
haven't worked that through, it's
very difficult to challenge that."
From her previous marriage,
Akiyama learned that "race is an
issue. A very intrinsic part of
who I am is being Japanese-

American. I need to be with a
man who, without necessarily
being one himself, understands
the complexities of being a per
son of color in this country."
Jackson said he encourages
students to "follow their hearts,"
despite external pressures.
"If you believe in equality and
the oneness of humankind, then
letting all these other kinds of
things hang you up is not very
positive and has nothing to do
with love," he said.


Dean of Students Michael Jackson and Assoc. Dean of Memorial Church Diana Akiyama take time from their duties at Stanford to share
a tender moment and discuss the unique experiences of their interracial marriage.
