The rate at which individuals and organizations learn may become the only
sustainable competitive advantage, especially in knowledge-intensive industries.
Ray Stata, Chairman, Analog Devices, Inc.
In order to do more with less and to solve problems never faced by predecessors,
organizations must learn by deign rather than by chancc. How can our
organizations shift from a mode of learning characterized by unconscious
adaptation to one of conscious anticipation? For many, learning is synonymous
with behavior change. In this course, we will examine the practical importance of
an alternate view, that learning is synonymous with a change in the meaning of
experience. From this new vantage point, we will review tested strategics that help
managers and their organizations construct new and more powerful meanings for
business practice through becoming more -aware of thcirwwn learn mg processes.
