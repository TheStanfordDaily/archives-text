## ASSU will vote on whether to repeal approval of speech code provision 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate will vote
tonight whether to repeal its ap
proval of the Grey Interpretation
of the Fundamental Standard
which it passed in 1989.
The Grey Interpretation pro
hibits the use of harsh and insult
ing language that aims to stigma
tize based on ethnicity, gender,
sexual orientation, physical hand
icap or religion. It applies when
the language is directed at a per
son or small group of people.
Supporters of the bill to repeal
the prohibition argue that censor
ship has no place in a university
environment. "Discrimination
should be allowed to fail on its own
lack of merit in an open market
place of ideas," the bill states.
If the bill passes, it will have no
direct effect on the Grey Interpre
tation except to rescind the sen
ate's approval and urge the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
to repeal it. The SCLC can only be
convened by University President
Gerhard Casper.
"We think this bill is an impor
tant step along the way" to getting
the Grey Interpretation repealed,
said graduate senator Rob Corry,
who introduced the bill at the sen
ate's last meeting.
Corry said he is optimistic that
the bill will pass. Five senators
have agreed to add their names to
the bill to show their support, he
said.
The bill has been slightly
streamlined since it was intro
duced so that it only discusses the
Grey Interpretation, Corry said.
"Originally, the proposal indi
cated our disapproval of all speech
codes, but we decided that was un
necessary and concentrated on the
Grey Interpretation," he added.
Corry said he feels that Casper
will respond if the bill is passed,
even though the president told the
Stanford Review last week that he
supports the Grey Interpretation.
"I don't think his support of the

Grey Interpretation runs very
strong," he said. "I think he was
just being diplomatic, which is
fine."
Corry added that he thinks that
if Casper had been at Stanford
longer and "knew the whole histo
ry" of the interpretation, he would
not have supported it so strongly.
Several speech codes have been
overturned by the Supreme Court
recently, bringing the issue back
into the limelight.
The Supreme Court unani
mously struck down a St. Paul,
Minn., city ordinance June 22, yet
acknowledged that the govern
ment has the right to regulate
speech, such as derogatory "fight
ing words," as long as it regulates
all of them. The court also ruled
against a University of Wisconsin
speech code in 1991.
Law Prof. Thomas Grey, who
authored the policy, told the Daily
this summer that the policy
would most likely remain legal
even if Stanford was a public
institution, but because Stanford
is private it faces even fewer con
stitutional constraints.
When the senate initially
approved the interpretation,
though, it went on record endors
ing the U.S. Constitution and the
idea of free speech.
A speech code at Stanford was
proposed after an incident in Uja
maa in 1988 when two freshmen

defaced a poster of Beethoven,
giving it stereotypical black fea
tures. A poster with the word
"Niggers" scrawled across it was
later found in the house.
The SCLC issued an opinion in
March 1989 which stated that
individuals and groups on campus
should be free from forms of
expression that degrade on the
basis of "personal or cultural dif
ferences." The opinion was cited
by many University community
members as being too vague and
too restrictive.
The council responded in April
1989 with the Grey Interpretation,
which was enacted in 1990. The
code has not been invoked during
the policy's two-year history.
In last year's ASSU election,
students voted 31 percent to 18
percent to rescind the Grey Inter
pretation.
"It's pretty important to
defend free speech at Stanford
whether you agree with the
speech or not," Corry said.
"The people that support the
Grey Interpretation mean well,"
he added. "We just have different
ways of thinking about what's
best for Stanford."

all of them. The court also ruled
against a University of Wisconsin
speech code in 1991.
Law Prof. Thomas Grey, who
authored the policy, told the Daily
this summer that the policy
would most likely remain legal
even if Stanford was a public
institution, but because Stanford
is private it faces even fewer con
stitutional constraints.
When the senate initially
approved the interpretation,
though, it went on record endors
ing the U.S. Constitution and the
idea of free speech.
A speech code at Stanford was
proposed after an incident in Uja
maa in 1988 when two freshmen

defaced a poster of Beethoven,
giving it stereotypical black fea
tures. A poster with the word
"Niggers" scrawled across it was
later found in the house.
The SCLC issued an opinion in
March 1989 which stated that
individuals and groups on campus
should be free from forms of
expression that degrade on the
basis of "personal or cultural dif
ferences." The opinion was cited
by many University community
members as being too vague and
too restrictive.
The council responded in April
1989 with the Grey Interpretation,
which was enacted in 1990. The
code has not been invoked during
the policy's two-year history.
In last year's ASSU election,
students voted 31 percent to 18
percent to rescind the Grey Inter
pretation.
"It's pretty important to
defend free speech at Stanford
whether you agree with the
speech or not," Corry said.
"The people that support the
Grey Interpretation mean well,"
he added. "We just have different
ways of thinking about what's
best for Stanford."
