## U.N. considers use of force in Somalia 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali yesterday recom
mended limited use of military
force to deliver humanitarian
supplies to starving Somalia.
He did not rule out an Ameri
can offer to commit 30,000
troops, but indicated a preference
for a U.N.-led force.
"I am more than ever con
vinced of the need for interna
tional military personnel to be
deployed in Somalia," Boutros-
Ghali said. "The Security Council
now has no alternative but to
decide to adopt more forceful
measures to secure the humani
tarian operations in Somalia."
Since Somali dictator
Mohammed Siad Barre was oust
ed in January 1991, more than
300,000 Somalis have died from
the combined effects of famine
and warfare, and 2 million more
are on the brink of starvation,
according to U.N. estimates.
But gun battles between Soma
lia's warring clans and marauding
gunmen have made it dangerous,
and at times impossible, to deliver
the hundreds of thousands of
tons of food and supplies donated
to the African nation.
The country's warlords say they
want nothing more than to end
Somalia's suffering, but without
the looted supplies, the loyalty of
their militiamen would evaporate.
In a nine-page report to the
Security Council, Boutros-Ghali
outlined five options for U.N.
action to protect the delivery of

aid, ranging from widescale mili
tary operations to complete with
drawal from Somalia.
If U.S. troops are used, Wash
ington has insisted that they
operate under U.S. command as
part of a multinational force,
sponsored by the United Nations,
on the order of the U.S.-led coali
tion that drove Iraq from Kuwait.
In Washington, a Pentagon
source said a three-ship, 1,800-
member U.S. Marine Corps contin
gent slated for duty in the Persian
Gulf is prepared to set up an
airstrip landing zone in Mogadishu
suitable for U.S. troops.
The ships could be ready to
move into the city by Thursday,
the source said on condition of
anonymity. He emphasized that no
decision has been made and that
the U.S. forces would only move if
the U.N. will allow them to report
to a U.S. commander on the scene.
A final decision rests with the
Security Council, which is expect
ed to authorize some form of mil
itary action this week.
The Security Council has
never been asked to authorize
full-scale military intervention
for humanitarian reasons. The
council approved use of force in
Bosnia to safeguard relief con
voys, but did not call for a unified
command under a member state
or under a U.N. flag.
Widescale use of force would
have to be justified on grounds
that the situation in the country
jeopardizes regional peace and
security.
