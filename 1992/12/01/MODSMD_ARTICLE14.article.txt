STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)
â€” Nazi swastikas confronted
chants of "Smash racism now!"
as right-wingers and anti-racists
challenged each other and scuf
fled with police in Stockholm
and the southern university
town of Lund yesterday.
Police used dogs, horses and
metal barricades to keep the
groups apart, arresting about 50
people.
Officers said a firecracker
rocket was fired at them from a
group of 300 anti-racist youths
carrying bats, bottles and rocks.
Even though Sweden is
viewed as tolerant, it has not
escaped the resurgence of racist
and anti-Semitic attacks plaguing
Europe this year, particularly in
Germany. For example, two Jew
ish cemeteries were desecrated in
the Stockholm area last week.
Right-wingers, some with
Nazi flags, shouted and chanted
as they proceeded toward the
statue of King Karl XII overlook
ing Stockholm's waterfront.
National television showed
men giving Nazi salutes, yelling
"Jew, scram!" and pushing a
Jewish woman, who cried out,
"You criminals!"
About 1,000 officers holding
fiberglass riot shields guarded
the statue of the 18th-century
warrior king. He is regarded by
neo-Nazis and rightists as a
symbol of Swedish glory and
national pride.

"This is very obviously a
small clique of rightists and
extremists," Prime Minister
Carl Bildt said on television. He
said most of the people on the
street were peace-loving, except
for "some troublemakers."

In Lund, 250 members of the
Nov. 30 Association, named for
the anniversary of Karl Xll's
death, marched with torches to
the university for a brief speech
and ceremony. Some chanted,
"Sieg Heil!," the German Nazi

salute.
Twenty riot officers donned
gas masks and raised their
shields in a narrow street in
Lund to hold back a crowd of
1,200 shouting anti-racists, who
were blocking the march route.
