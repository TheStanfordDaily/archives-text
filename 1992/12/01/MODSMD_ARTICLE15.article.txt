# Tsongas has a third outbreak of cancer
## 
### 
BOSTON (AP) â€” Former Democratic pres
idential candidate Paul Tsongas, who has
twice battled cancer, confirmed yesterday that
a new growth in his abdomen is cancerous.
"That's the bad news," Tsongas, 51, said at
a news conference. "The good news is that it's
contained."
The former U.S. senator from Mas
sachusetts said he will undergo chemotherapy
and radiation treatment as early as Thursday,
and that those measures should effectively
remove the cancer, which he identified as
large-cell lymphoma.
"Now, is this the last one they'll ever
find?" he asked. "Who knows?"
Large-cell lymphoma is more aggressive
than its small-cell counterpart, but is consid
ered more effectively treatable with chemother
apy and radiation.
Tsongas ended his Senate career in 1984
after he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins
lymphoma. His condition worsened despite
conventional treatment, and he underwent an
experimental operation in July 1986 in which
some bone marrow was removed and treated
to kill the cancer cells.
In 1987, doctors also removed a lymph

node that was found to have lymphoma from
Tsongas' armpit.
He said it was unclear if the latest growth is
a recurrence of the earlier episodes.
Tsongas said his medical condition would
not affect his own political plans, and added
that he has designs on no elected office but the
presidency.
"Do I think this precludes me from run
ning for president? Hell, no," Tsongas said.
Tsongas said he was relieved to learn that
this current cancer, discovered near his pan
creas, was not pancreatic cancer, which can be
quickly fatal.
Tsongas angrily blasted news reporters for
implying he had tried to cover up his 1987 ill
ness, and for harassing his wife and 11-year
old daughter "about whether her daddy had
cancer" as speculation raged about his diagno
sis during the last week.
Doctors at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
where Tsongas was diagnosed, declined to com
ment on his condition. The institute's spokeswom
an, Gina Vild, said a medical history was being pre
pared at Tsongas' request and would be released.
"I have come to the painful conclusion that
there's no way around full medical disclosure,"

Tsongas said. "I'm sorry to come to this conclu
sion, because I think it's going to set an unfor
tunate precedent for a lot of other people."
He recommended that President-elect Bill
Clinton set up a commission to establish stan
dards for full medical disclosure for all presi
dential candidates.
Had Tsongas won the presidency, and then
been forced to undergo radiation and treat
ments that have side effects like nausea, "I'd
just deal with it like you deal with everything
else," he said.
"I might throw up, but we had a president
who did that in Japan on full camera. I would
do it in private," he added.
He said he called the news conference so
others who have cancer could "take a look at
me" and be reassured.
A treatment regimen has not been set, but
Tsongas said he expects to be receiving daily
doses of radiation in January and February.
Tsongas said the treatment would limit his
travel, but he would continue his work with
the Concord Coalition, a public interest group
which he and Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H.,
have created to focus attention on the nation's
economic problems.
