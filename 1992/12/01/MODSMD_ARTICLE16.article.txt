# Venezuela heals after bloody coup attempt

### 
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) —
Caracas sprung back to its feet
yesterday after a bloody coup
attempt, but residents jumpy
about the future lined up at banks
to stockpile cash.
Hundreds of Caracas residents
were evacuated from several
blocks near the presidential palace
at midday as firefighters worked
to deactivate a bomb, one of many
dropped on the area during a
failed coup attempt on Friday.
At least 232 people were killed
in the attempt to oust President
Carlos Andres Perez and in a
related prison riot.
Outside Reten de Catia prison,
relatives waited for news of
inmates after hundreds of
National Guardsmen stormed the
prison and ended a three-day
standoff with inmates there.
The turmoil tapped into the
public discontent over corruption
and a declining standard of living
in Venezuela, where a bubble of
prosperity provided by oil produc
tion popped in the early 1980s.
Many Venezuelans charge that
the country's two main parties,
which have ruled in one of Latin
America's most stable democra
cies since 1958, have shown no
willingness to battle widespread
corruption.
Attorney General Ramon Esco
bar yesterday asked Perez to
reopen a probe into alleged gov
ernment corruption.
Economic analysts said
Venezuela's continuing instabili
ty could jeopardize Perez's plan to
shrink the government and pur
sue free-market reforms. The
country is the United States' No.
2 foreign oil supplier and has the
world's biggest known oil reserves
outside the Persian Gulf.
Long lines formed outside
banks yesterday as they opened
for the first time since Thursday,

when the coup attempt began.
"With the fear, people are tak
ing out more money than usual,"
said David Carrera, assistant man
ager at a branch of Banco Latino.
The nation's stock exchange
fell roughly 5 percent yesterday,
continuing a slide that has shaved
about one-third off the market
index since the coup attempt in
February.

Government advertisements
urged Venezuelans to vote Sun
day in state and local elections,
but people on the streets
expressed little enthusiasm for
democracy.
"This is a democracy under a
dictatorship," said Francisco
Lucero, 53, one of hundreds of
people who waited outside the
stormed prison in west Caracas.

Venezuela also grudgingly
accepted Peru's decision to grant
asylum to 93 air force insurgents
who fled there.
But Foreign Minister Fernan
do Ochoa Antich told reporters he
couldn't understand how a coun
try could admit people who
"indiscriminately bombarded a
city like Caracas, killing all those
civilians who died Fridav."
