Big quake likely to hit soon
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Recent earthquakes may have
quadrupled the odds of more big jolts soon in Southern Califor
nia, creating nearly a 50-50 chance within five years of "the Big
One," said a report issued yesterday.
"The risk to this region is significant," said Richard Andrews,
director of the state's Office of Emergency Services. "I urge the
public to take earthquake preparedness steps now."
He said the risk of another quake measuring 7 or more on the
Richter scale "has been increased significantly" as a result of the
7.5 Landers and 6.6 Big Bear earthquakes on June 28.
If the region's next quake measures 7.5 or more and occurs
closer to population centers, it "has the potential to be catas
trophic," Andrews said.
