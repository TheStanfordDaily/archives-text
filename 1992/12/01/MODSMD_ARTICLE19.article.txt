## The new challenge
### 
Stanford students should
take more responsibility
in the fight against AIDS

Aids is to our age what
the Vietnam War was to the
baby boomer generation.
The worldwide AIDS epidemic
has affected the most intimate
aspects of our lives: love, sex,
health, relationships and family.
The programs presented on cam
pus today — World AIDS Day —
offer us an important chance to
renew our commitment to fighting
back.
Compared with the rest of the
nation and world, the Stanford
community is relatively well-edu
cated about the risks of AIDS.
However, this level of knowledge
and responsibility is relative, not
absolute.
AIDS is still seen by many as a
disease of others — others being
gay and bisexual men, I.V drug
users, hemophiliacs or simply peo
ple older than ourselves. Conse
quently, while most are aware of
safer sex practices, many are will
ing to take risks within Stanford's
supposedly insulated community.
Perhaps this is understandable.
No one has a greater and falser
sense of immortality than young
adults. Although there are mem
bers of the Stanford community
with HIV and AIDS, most Stanford
students probably believe they do
not know any. But appearances are
deceiving. A person may be HlV
positive for a decade or more before
showing symptoms of infection.
In this new decade, we are just
as likely to run into people our own
age who suffer from AIDS as peo
ple from other generations. And
recent AIDS statistics reflect this.
According to the House Select
Committee on Children, Youth and
Families, 40,000 American adoles
cents are newly infected with HIV
every year. Another reveals that
14.3 percent of gay and bisexual

male San Francisco residents
under 24 are HIV-positive.
Furthermore, countries like
India, which in the early 1980s
showed few signs of infection with
HIV now face an explosion in AIDS
because of the near-total absence of
education.
How is it that new infections
continue, even as we know how to
prevent the transmission of HIV?
Such statistics teach that in order
to combat AIDS, commitment to
the battle must replace dependence
on science alone.
We need to be aware of AIDS and
HIV not just out of self-interest,
but because we are members of a
national and international commu
nity. Having a college education
puts most of us in a position of
privilege relative to many. We have
a duty to transmit information
about AIDS to others and to make
our voices heard in public policy
decisions.
In January, the nation will inau
gurate a president who has spoken
publicly about AIDS and the need
for a national strategy to combat it.
While such a policy must be sure to
include aspects related to preven
tion, treatment and curing, it must
also address two essential points:
• Explicit methods of educating
people, particularly youth, about
avoiding HIV must be initiated;
and
• An increased support of inter
national campaigns against the dis
ease must be implemented.
Since AIDS first made its deadly
entrance into our lives, it has
brought out both the worst and the
best in individuals and society.
We've seen unspeakable intoler
ance, bureaucratic delays, suicidal
denial and the near destruction of
entire communities. But we've also
seen the unprecedented mobiliza
tion of concerned individuals, dra
matic medical progress and moving
examples of bravery, charity and
personal sacrifice.
When the history of our genera
tion is written, let's hope it records
that we looked into the abyss and
didn't blink.
