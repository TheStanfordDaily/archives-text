# Casper plans to address ASSU Senate meeting
## 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
University President Ger
hard Casper will address the
ASSU Senate at its meeting
tonight and answer ques
tions on students' concerns
and worries.
Casper has agreed to meet
with the senate once per
quarter, as former president
Donald Kennedy did, said
ASSU University Relations
Chair Derek Miyahara.
The ASSU has submitted
to Casper a list of 10 questions
from students covering issues
ranging from University
housing to tuition increases.
Miyahara, who arranged
the meeting, said he gave
Casper copies of the ques
tions so the president would
have a chance to familiarize
himself with issues he may
have only heard about since
his arrival at Stanford.
Senior Michelle Mello,
whose question concerns fu
ture tuition increases, said
she hopes Casper will clarify
his stance on financial aid and
discuss tuition increases for
upcoming years.
"We're not sure what his
response will be," said Mello, who
works on the ASSU Financial Aid
Advocacy committee. "There's
some uncertainty on his stance on
need-blind admissions and finan
cial aid. This is the only forum we
have had so far."
Graduate senator Bob Loden
kamper, who will ask three ques
tions at the meeting, said he thinks
there are a lot of student issues of
which Casper should be aware.
"Some of these, Casper's in a
position to do something about,"
he said.
Lodenkamper's questions con
cern Casper's opinion on the Grey
interpretation of Stanford's
speech code, the emphasis on
teaching and research, and the
size of the University's staff.
"The general feeling is that the
administration has gotten a bit
top heavy and that this may no
longer be the sensible way to run
the school," he said.
Undergraduate senator Jaasi
Munanka will ask about Casper's

'Realistically, he'll
probably say some
thing very political
like, "Multiculturalism
is very important."'
— Jaasi Munanka

feelings on multiculturalism and
the University's commitment to
diversity and affirmative action.
"I think it'd be great if he said
multiculturalism, diversity and
affirmative action are a vital and
necessary component to the Uni
versity," he said. "But realistical
ly, he'll probably say . . . some
thing very political like, 'Multi
culturalism is very important.' "
Munanka said student leaders
of different minority groups will
meet with Casper over the next
couple of months. Although those
meetings will give the groups a
clearer idea of where Casper
stands, tonight's discussion is a
good place to start, he added.
If time remains after the 10
submitted questions have been
answered, Casper will then take
questions from the senate floor,
Miyahara said.
