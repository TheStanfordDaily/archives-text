### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
University President Ger
hard Casper will address the
ASSU Senate at its meeting
tonight and answer ques
tions on students' concerns
and worries.
Casper has agreed to meet
with the senate once per
quarter, as former president
Donald Kennedy did, said
ASSU University Relations
Chair Derek Miyahara.
The ASSU has submitted
to Casper a list of 10 questions
from students covering issues
ranging from University
housing to tuition increases.
Miyahara, who arranged
the meeting, said he gave
Casper copies of the ques
tions so the president would
have a chance to familiarize
himself with issues he may
have only heard about since
his arrival at Stanford.
Senior Michelle Mello,
whose question concerns fu
ture tuition increases, said
she hopes Casper will clarify
