## Non-Western feminism 
### 
EIGHTY MILLION GIRLS IN cen
tral Africa, Yemen, Oman, Egypt,
Ethiopia and the Muslim popula
tions of Malaysia and Indonesia have
undergone a procedure called female "cir
cumcision," I found out last week from a
Mercury News article. But the procedure
doesn't really resemble circumcision at
all.
It may consist of a nick in, or removal of
the clitoris, amputation of all external gen
italia and the sewing shut of the vulva, or
the locking shut of the vagina with a ring
to prevent copulation. While the operation
varies, all these procedures physically
impose restrictions on a woman's sexual
functioning and her ability to bear chil
dren.
That realization made me furious. How
dare anyone restrict a woman's freedoms
so blatantly and irrevocably? I simply
couldn't believe that for dozens of genera
tions these women have offered their
daughters up to the same kind of torture as
they experienced without some kind of
mass revolt.
My second reaction was fear— of the
pain involved, of living in a culture where
such huge limitations seem acceptable. A
girl receives the operation some time
between infancy and betrothal. Generally,
her doctor is an untrained older woman
working without anesthetic.
The girl may be aware that she is not
eligible to be married unless she is operat-

Ed on. But does she know that in a study in
Sudan 25 percent of circumcised girls expe
rienced hemorrhage, shock and infection
after the operation? And that 34 percent
have had lifelong problems with urinary
and pelvic infections, as well as pain during
sex, that her tissues may be too mangled
for a baby to emerge?
And even if she knows, does she have a
choice?
A second source presented two reasons
why the procedure is performed. Removing
the ability to experience sexual pleasure, or
to have sex at all, is regarded as a deterrent
for premarital sex and marital infidelity.
And removal of the clitoris, believed to be a
male vestige, may be viewed as a rite of
passage from androgyny to womanhood.
The first explanation reconfirmed my
feminist ire. But the second is a difference
in perception that made me question the
basis of my initial response. How can I
argue against a culture I haven't tried to
understand? Is it relevant that I, an out
sider, may find the practice cruel?
As hard as it is for me to admit, the
answer is no. To treat the issue as a matter
for feminist outrage would be to assume
that one society, namely mine, has a privi
leged position from which to judge the
practices of another.
I believe that women have a right to
make their own choices. But this is an idea
imbedded in my own cultural experience.
While I find the practice of female genital

alteration disturbing, I can't extrapolate
that it is a practice that African and Asian
women want to abolish, or that they would
need my help in doing so.
It's easy for groups like the World
Health Organization to recommend that
governments outlaw the practice. It's easy
to take charge and impose decisions as if
we are some kind of omnipotent Big Sister.
I could even say that I would accept
whatever choice a woman made, as long as
the choice was her own, or suggest that
women deserve access to education and
medical information so as to make an
informed choice.
Nevertheless, my influence would also
necessitate changes in a whole system of
beliefs — about marriage, medicine, reli
gion, education and women's roles in these
other cultures. And I'd still be passing a
judgment.
Who am I to define anyone else's rights?
The women of the world are more different
than similar. It wasn't difficult to practice
cultural sensitivity until it forced me to
temper the feminist views I value most.

This is the last time that Andrea Parkes
won't pass judgment here until the first
Tuesday of Winter Quarter.
