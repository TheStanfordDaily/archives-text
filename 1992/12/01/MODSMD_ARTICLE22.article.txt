Students address Germany's poor media image

FROM WILLIAM RANDOLPH
Hearst's "yellow journalism" of
the late 19th century, to the recent
media coverage of the Gulf war, history
has shown us that the media's role is
not always one of reporting the facts but
rather sometimes one of presenting a
well-orchestrated, naively one-sided rep
resentation.
The latest misrepresentation by the
media is the uprising of anti-foreigner,
neo-facist sentiment in Germany. This
volatile topic provides the press with
ample action-packed footage but unfor
tunately leaves the world with the false
assumption that it is the only newswor
thy event in the country.
As students at the Stanford Center
in Berlin, we regret to inform you
that Germany — Berlin in particular
— is not swimming with U-bahn

roaming gangs of rock-throwing, fire
starting, epithet-hurling Skinheads
with sworn allegiance to Hitler and
Axl Rose.
The Neo-Nazi, anti-foreigner prob
lem certainly exists, and it is scary as
hell. But in all honesty, the only time
that most of the students here talk
about it is in a class, forum discussion
or after watching the same news reports
broadcast in the States. It has not taken
over our lives, nor has it scared us
enough to influence our daily actions.
Speaking for ourselves, we can hon
estly say that we have never felt physi
cally threatened in any way during our
time in Berlin. Granted, we are both
6'B', 280 lbs. and bear a striking resem
blance to the Aryan God Arnold
Schwarzenegger — NOT!
But as one Filipino-American Stan

ford student here put it,"The most
dangerous thing I've experienced in
Berlin is wet leaves on concrete."
Another students says, "I've seen as
many Neo-Nazis in Berlin as I have in
San Francisco — none."
On the other hand, it would not be
fair to say that all of us share this flip
pant, nonchalant attitude. One student,
an Asian-American woman, does not go
out at night because she "is sick and
tired of the racist comments that are
directed toward [herl by passing pedes
trians."
She can "tell from their tone that
they are derogatory and perhaps even
sexual," even though she can't com
pletely understand them due to the lan
guage barrier. And another woman says
that Berlin at night "is like walking
from Wilbur to Roble without a SURE

escort."
While the Neo-Nazis and anti-foreign
er sentiment is a problem, and a few stu
dents have been directly affected, it
should not keep people from experienc
ing this wonderful place. Nor should it
give the rest of the world grounds for
writing off the entire country.
Personally, we'd feel safer riding the
U-bahn at 3 a.m., naked with DM 1000
bills taped to our bodies, singing Turk
ish folks songs in round, than we would
driving fully clothed through East Palo
Alto at night.
Maybe that's a bit of an exaggera
tion, but it would certainly make
streaking the Quad look like peanuts.
