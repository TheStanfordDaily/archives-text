# Ticketing bikers doesn't stop bike theft problem
## 
### 
The recent publicity concerning the
exorbitant fines charged by the Stanford
Police department for bicyclists running
stop signs has made me wonder if the
Stanford Police might need to revise its
priorities.
I think the Stanford community
would be much better served if the
police would concentrate their energies
instead on the much more serious and
costly problem of bicycle theft.
A flyer in my building says that 588
bicycles were stolen at Stanford last
year. Even a conservative estimate puts
the value of that stolen property at over
$100,000. This problem ought to be sig
nificant enough for the Stanford Police
to be concerned.
Yet I have heard of many more cases
of bike theft and traffic citations than of
stolen bikes being recovered or thieves

being caught. Furthermore, when I
called to report the theft of my bike
freshman year, the operator laughed in
my ear when I asked her the chance of
its recovery.
I realize that the traffic citations are
intended to reduce the number of bicycle
accidents and that the fees are set by the
county, but I think the Stanford Police
department could utilize its skills in a
more productive fashion.
I have seen Stanford's finest hiding
cleverly in the bushes along Santa Tere
sa Street, waiting to ambush bicyclists
who ride through the stop sign at
Samuel Morris Way. What if these same
officers were to hide cleverly in the
bushes and ambush bicycle thieves?
That way they could get the same
commando adrenaline rush while pre
venting bicycle theft. They would be
doing a much greater service to the resi
dents of the Stanford community as
well.
The way things are going now, there
will soon be no more bikes left at Stan

ford, and the police will have to give out
jaywalking citations.
