# Cal graduate outraged by behavior at Big Game
## 
### 
What a horrified, capacity crowd at
Memorial Stadium witnessed on Nov. 21
was a disgusting display of infantile
behavior.
The problem is that the infancy of
UC-Berkeley fans is 16 years past. They
are adults, and are expected to behave as
such.
These students have the right to vote
and may bear arms in defense of their
country, so why can't they enjoy what
has, year after year, been an afternoon
of good football. It's only a game.
Graciousness and sportsmanlike con
duct would have been a support to the
Cal team. But their behavior was only

an embarrassment, one that the team's
coaches and the rest of the country will
remember for years.
There is no good reason for Cal fans
to bear hostility toward the fans of the
team from our neighbors in the South
Bay. Demographically, they're very simi
lar to Cal's student body. Today I am
entirely ashamed of them and entirely
embarrassed to be associated with Cal.
Every year my husband asks me if I
want to get Cal football season tickets.
Next year I'll answer with a simple,
resounding no.
