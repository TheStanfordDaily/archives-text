## Ed Donovan Daily staff writer voices frustration with editing process 
### 
AS A DAILY STAFF WRITER, I
know that decisions have to be
made concerning the length and
content of the articles it prints each
issue. Occasionally, something I write
must be cut because something is either
inappropriate, not interesting or too
lengthy. However, in the case of an arti
cle which ran under my name last Mon
day, I feel the editing process was mis
handled.
The sports editors have always treated
me and my articles with respect. When I
bring my article in, they make sure to
edit it in my presence so I'm aware of my
mistakes and so I know what my article
will look like in print. In addition, they
view their job with the proper perspec
tive. With an understanding of The
Daily's mission and readership, they
appreciate the proper blend of color and
straight reporting that makes an inter
esting story.
Because of the magnitude of Big
Game, my story in last Monday's Daily

was to begin on the front page and end in
the sports section. In short, it was to be
my biggest assignment so far. I worked
hard both at the reporting and writing of
my story in appreciation of its impor
tance both to Daily readers and to
myself.
The article discussed the atmosphere
of the rivalry and its manifestation in the
events surrounding the actual contest.
Speaking subjectively, it was a good read.
The account was factual and reflected
research and observation of the sur
roundings. Both in content and style, the
article managed to convey humor in
depicting the lighter moments of the
game and the seriousness of the violence.
The article reflected the complexity and
spirit of what Big Game represents. Most
importantly, I believe people would have
enjoyed reading it.
Because the article was to run on the
front page, the news department had the
final word on the article. Apparently,
they wanted the article to concentrate

solely on the security problems. They
wanted more of a news article or at least
what they perceive a news article to be.
In response, the news department tried
independently to get the information
necessary for the story they desired.
Apparently, they couldn't get enough
information to do their own story,
because they decided to pillage my article
for key quotes and statements and incor
porate them into a new article that ran
under my name. The article isn't mine.
Rather, credit should go to the ability of
the news department to steal my quotes
and observations and transmute them
into something worthless. Even worse,
this was all done without my knowledge.
The article conveys nothing of the
spirit that was present at the game that
day. Rather, it gives the impression that
I sat in my room and listened to high
lights on National Public Radio to get my
story. This isn't what happened, and I
am frankly embarrassed that the story
ran in my name. Although I had no con

trol over the article or the fact that my
name appears, I wish to apologize to The
Daily's readership, on behalf of The
Daily in general, for such a dry presenta
tion of a fascinating cultural event.
Big Game is not merely news. Both
the game itself and everything that sur
rounds it are filled with the spirit of
rivalry and the excitement of college foot
ball. There are cultural currents and pas
sions behind every newsworthy item, and
these deserve to be presented as much as
the events themselves. The news pages
are generally lacking in this regard, and I
think a poll of The Daily's readership
would reveal clearly that these pages are
some of the least read.
Lighten up, this isn't The New York
Times. In fact, it's worse, because if you
took a closer look at the Times, it
becomes clear that their news reporting
reflects even more respect for the spirit
that pervades events than the Daily does.
On this note, I believe more people would
have finished my original article than

finished the one that was printed.
In addition, the news department
needs to to treat writers with more
respect. Perhaps in their perception of
themselves as on the journalistic fast
track, they have forgotten about the per
sonal investment writers have in their
stories. Or maybe they just feel that
sports as a department doesn't hold the
same merit as news. But the sports
department is as viable as any at The
Daily, and the writing is as good as any
in the paper.
Finally, the failure to even consult me
about the changes until it was too late
reflects a disregard for both me and my
story. I believe the news department
needs to take better stock of its responsi
bilities. You owe me more respect, and
you owe Daily readers better and more
interesting journalism.
