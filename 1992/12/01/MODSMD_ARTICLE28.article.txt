## No.1 Cardinal hoops squares off against Texas Tech 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
The women's basketball season is upon us once
again, and fans from around the country will be look
ing for Stanford to continue the success it has achieved
over the past few seasons. During the last three years,
the Cardinal has won two national championships and
reached the semifinals every season.
This year, the defending national champion and
No. 1-ranked Cardinal is hoping to top last season's
amazing 30-3 performance which included a Pacific 10
Conference title and a 78-62 rout of Western Ken
tucky in the NCAA finals.
According to coach Tar a VanDerveer, this seeming
ly difficult task is well within reach despite the losses
of Kelly Dougherty (who transfered to Vanderbilt) and
graduated senior Ann Adkins.
"We are much improved compared to last year,"
VanDerveer said. "Although both players made major
contributions to the team last year, we still return a lot
of talent."
The squad's starting five from last season remains
intact, figuring to receive a large part of its offensive
production from senior point guard Molly Goodenbour
and senior center Val Whiting. Last season Gooden
bour was selected as the NCAA Women's Final Four
MVP while Whiting was voted an All-American.
However, Stanford will not rely only on the perfor
mances of these two seniors. The team has an advan
tage over other squads, with several players who are
quite capable of leading the Cardinal to victory.
"The best part about this team is balance and
depth," VanDerveer said. "We have great individual
players in Val and Molly, but we are equally talented at
every position."
Returning forwards Chris MacMurdo and Rachel
Hemmer add much to the scoring power of the team,
along with guards Christy Hedgpeth and Kate Paye.
Stanford looks to receive substantial contributions
from sophomore center Anita Kaplan, defensive spe
cialist Angela Taylor and redshirt freshman Bobby
Kelsey.
The Cardinal squad enters the non-conference pre
season with a great deal of confidence after good early
season practices as well as the team's outstanding per
formance in the 1992 Eurostars tournament held in
France near the end of the summer.
Stanford defeated some of the top professional
teams in Europe (including a team from Kiev that had
beaten the Cardinal by 27 points just a few days earli
er) to win the tournament championship. More impor
tantly, this valuable experience in Europe helped the
team upgrade its play.
"It helped us to find out what we need to improve
on," according to VanDerveer. "We need to play more
aggressively and at a quicker pace."

The Cardinal also demonstrated their superiority
in a more recent game at home against the Belgium
National Team. Stanford trounced their opponent
from the opening tip and put the Belgians away 95-55.
The top-ranked Cardinal opens its regular season
tonight at Maples Pavilion against an experienced
squad from Texas Tech. Although Stanford ended
Texas Tech's season last year in the NCAA Regional
Semifinals, they cannot afford to take this game lightly.
"It is important to start out intense against Texas
Tech like we did against Belgium," Kaplan said.

The Red Raiders are a multi-dimensional team led
by All-American Sheryl Swoopes. VanDerveer has
stressed that her players need to focus on good defense
if they are to prevail.
"Swoopes is capable of taking over the game," said
the eighth-year coach. "We need to concentrate on our
individual defense."
VanDerveer admitted that playing against such a
talented team is a tough way to start the season, but
the road to the NCAA Championship will not get any
easier for Stanford as their season progresses.

The Cardinal is scheduled to face teams from Ten
nessee and Texas, both ranked in the top-10. The com
petition within the Pac-10 will also be difficult as Stan
ford plays against skillful teams from No. 10 USC,
UCLA and Arizona State.
Although winning the National Championship will
not be an easy task for the Cardinal, the talented
squad has the potential to dominate all of their oppo
nents and have a memorable season.
"I think this will be a special team," VanDerveer
said. "It has a lot of enthusiasm and heart."

formance in the 1992 Eurostars tournament held in
France near the end of the summer.
Stanford defeated some of the top professional
teams in Europe (including a team from Kiev that had
beaten the Cardinal by 27 points just a few days earli
er) to win the tournament championship. More impor
tantly, this valuable experience in Europe helped the
team upgrade its play.
"It helped us to find out what we need to improve
on," according to VanDerveer. "We need to play more
aggressively and at a quicker pace."

The Cardinal also demonstrated their superiority
in a more recent game at home against the Belgium
National Team. Stanford trounced their opponent
from the opening tip and put the Belgians away 95-55.
The top-ranked Cardinal opens its regular season
tonight at Maples Pavilion against an experienced
squad from Texas Tech. Although Stanford ended
Texas Tech's season last year in the NCAA Regional
Semifinals, they cannot afford to take this game lightly.
"It is important to start out intense against Texas
Tech like we did against Belgium," Kaplan said.

The Red Raiders are a multi-dimensional team led
by All-American Sheryl Swoopes. VanDerveer has
stressed that her players need to focus on good defense
if they are to prevail.
"Swoopes is capable of taking over the game," said
the eighth-year coach. "We need to concentrate on our
individual defense."
VanDerveer admitted that playing against such a
talented team is a tough way to start the season, but
the road to the NCAA Championship will not get any
easier for Stanford as their season progresses.

The Cardinal is scheduled to face teams from Ten
nessee and Texas, both ranked in the top-10. The com
petition within the Pac-10 will also be difficult as Stan
ford plays against skillful teams from No. 10 USC,
UCLA and Arizona State.
Although winning the National Championship will
not be an easy task for the Cardinal, the talented
squad has the potential to dominate all of their oppo
nents and have a memorable season.
"I think this will be a special team," VanDerveer
said. "It has a lot of enthusiasm and heart."
