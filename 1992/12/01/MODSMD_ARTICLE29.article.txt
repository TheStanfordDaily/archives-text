# Frosh standouts lead Stanford swim squad

With the graduation of veterans like Jeff
Rouse, John deGroot and Alex Kostich, Cardi
nal swimming supporters may wonder how
the Stanford men's swim team could improve
upon last year's record-setting squad.
After all, phrases like "the best collegiate
team in history" aren't tossed casually around
the pool decks and locker rooms of the NCAA.
However, Cardinal head coach Skip Kenney
has six new reasons to be optimistic about the
future of Cardinal dominance — the members
of his freshman class.
This weekend, the Cardinal freshmen will
race in their first "big" meet of the season at
the Texas Invitational in Austin. Bryan Addle
man, the group's most versatile swimmer,
cites the Texas meet as a critical one: "We've
never had to really perform well mid-season.
That's one big adjustment to swimming in the
program here."
But the Cardinal freshmen will be far from
unprepared for Texas' challenge.
"Most of us were standouts on our club
teams in high school, and we didn't have any
one to race in workout," Addleman said.
"Here, there's such an incredible array of tal
ent — there's always someone out there push
ing you. It's a lot more intense. . . Actually, it's

the fastest training in the world."
Standing out in this field of promising
young swimmers are '92 Olympian Joe Hude
pohl and Pan American champion Eric Diehl,
two athletes that Kenney expects to have atyp
ical first seasons.
"Joe and Eric have a lot more experience at
the top level than most frosh," Kenney said.
"They've both been national finalists for years
and come from 'big time' programs.
"Joe is a funny swimmer. He only has two
gears — he goes real slow or he goes faster
than anyone else in the pool."
Kenney also maintains the belief that
Hudepohl will emerge over the next four years
as "one of the all-time great athletes that
comes through Stanford."
Although Hudepohl is perhaps the more
recognizable of the two, due to his perfor
mance in Barcelona, Kenney expects equally
great things from Diehl.
"Eric took off a year after high school to
train for Olympic Trials, but got sick," Kenney
said. "If the circumstances had been different,
I think he would've been on that team for sure.
"Eric was the No. 1 recruit in his class and
Joe was the No. 1 recruit in the world," Ken
ney added. "That says something about their
capabilities."
In addition to Hudepohl, Diehl and Addle

man, the Cardinal also boasts Mike Covert, an
endurance swimmer recovering from a dislo
cated patella. Kenney feels that once Covert
gets back in shape, "He'll do some amazing
training. We'll be counting on him in the dis
tance events — events that we were naked in
before."
Kenney also looks toward Covert's class
mates Scott Gagner and Alan Young to step
into the spotlight.
"Scott's a real rookie with a great future,"
Kenney said. "He needs to get a lot stronger,
but he has a tremendous work ethic and isn't
afraid of anything we throw at him."
Kenney cites Young as "big on talent, short
on experience. It's a matter of him making the
adjustment. If he can stick it out, he will defi
nitely help us.
"Sometimes when these kids come into this
program, you forget that they're just 18-year
old freshmen needing to make the same
adjustments as everyone else."
As for now, Kenney depends on the fresh
man class to bring out the enthusiasm in the
team.
"They're just a happy group — always
laughing, always upbeat," Kenney said. "It
may sound corny, but the 'Wow, isn't this cool'
attitude that they bring to the team really
turns on the other guys."
