# Petitions can't save vendors
## 
### Alexa Lee Staff writer 
After several fruitless efforts to
extend their stay on campus, the
White Plaza vendors are coming to
terms with the reality that Dec. 18
will be their last day at Stanford.
"I feel psyched that I at least
gave it a try, but I know that I
have to concentrate on other
things," said Gary Freed of Purely
Akademic T-shirts.
Freed's efforts culminated in a
petition signed by more 800 peo
ple that was sent to University of
ficials and the ASSU.
But the widespread support
failed to sway Assoc. Director of
Tresidder Union Paul Szczesiul,
and the University's original deci
sion remains unchanged.
"The Dec. 18 deadline still
stands," said Szczesiul.

fice was no longer able to monitor
the vendors' business licenses,
and he was notified that the ven
dors pose a potential tax liability
threat because they conduct com
mercial activity on land that is
designated as tax-free.
"The petitions really just
underscored how much people like
to have them out there," said
Szczesiul. "It was never our inten
tion to throw them out on a whim.
There are practical reasons behind
everything."
Bobbi Braden, director of Tresid
der Union, said, "As far as I know,
nothing has changed. We received
the petitions, but the tax concerns
and staff shortages are still there."
In mid-October, Stanford
declared that the vendors had to
leave White Plaza by Nov. 1, but
they were granted an extension
until the end of fall quarter to
give them more time to take
advantage of the lucrative Christ
mas season before relocating.
The petition requested that
the University "refrain from
enacting the policy to eliminate
vendors from using White Plaza
to sell their arts and crafts."
"Vending in White Plaza is a
tradition that goes back a quarter
century. These vendors make
White Plaza what it is today, and
add to the vitality of the entire
Stanford Campus. I hope they
remain here," the petition said.
Ultimately, the petition did not
change the University's decision,
said Freed. "The decision was
firm. Szczesiul had the stack on
his desk, and I told him about
some other ideas," said Freed.
"But he seemed like he really did
not want to deal with it, that the
original problems were still there."
Freed suggested that one day
each month, vendors would come
in and sign a form provided by the
State Board of Equalization that
would free the University of any

liability for uncollected sales taxes.
Szczesiul stated that he was
"not sure if this would really pro
tect the University."
He said he plans to check with
the State Board of Equalization
later this week.
"This still only addresses the
sales tax issue though," he added.
Freed also suggested that "the
vendors enforce and monitor the
use of business licenses between
themselves so that all comply so
that everyone could stay."
According to Freed, Szczesiul
raised fair objections to all of the
alternatives, but Szczesiul could
not comment on how or if the
ASSU might become involved.
With no hope of reconsideration
by the administration, ASSU inter
vention is the only other source of
hope for the vendors, said Freed.
"But it is hard to be hopeful now."
At Foothill College, the Stu
dent Council manages the ven
dors by taking in a percentage of
the vendors' sales and putting it
toward non-profit organizations.
The vendors delivered a copy of
the petition to ASSU Senate
Chair Ron Brown last Friday.
But due to a packed agenda
this quarter, the ASSU has not
been able to look at the situation
yet, said undergraduate senator
Anoop Prakash.
"Attention to this matter will
depend on the overall agenda and
how important the issue is per
ceived to be," said Prakash.
Meanwhile, Freed admitted, "I
feel like this whole White Plaza
soap opera is coming to an end.
"The message is sort of like
when you're going out with your
girlfriend, you think things are
OK, but she says that she can't go
out with you anymore. . . . She
doesn't have time," Freed said.
"You can beg and stuff, but ulti
mately you have to deal."
Freed and the others say they
plan to deal with the change in
fortune by making adjustments in
their lives.
"There is always Berkeley, I
guess," said Freed.

"But it is hard to be hopeful now."
At Foothill College, the Stu

dors by taking in a percentage of
the vendors' sales and putting it
toward non-profit organizations.
The vendors delivered a copy of
the petition to ASSU Senate
Chair Ron Brown last Friday.
But due to a packed agenda
this quarter, the ASSU has not
been able to look at the situation
yet, said undergraduate senator
Anoop Prakash.
"Attention to this matter will
depend on the overall agenda and
how important the issue is per
ceived to be," said Prakash.
Meanwhile, Freed admitted, "I
feel like this whole White Plaza
soap opera is coming to an end.
"The message is sort of like
when you're going out with your
girlfriend, you think things are
OK, but she says that she can't go
out with you anymore. . . . She
doesn't have time," Freed said.
"You can beg and stuff, but ulti
mately you have to deal."
Freed and the others say they
plan to deal with the change in
fortune by making adjustments in
their lives.
"There is always Berkeley, I
guess," said Freed.
After several fruitless efforts to
extend their stay on campus, the
White Plaza vendors are coming to
terms with the reality that Dec. 18
will be their last day at Stanford.
"I feel psyched that I at least
gave it a try, but I know that I
have to concentrate on other
things," said Gary Freed of Purely
Akademic T-shirts.
Freed's efforts culminated in a
petition signed by more 800 peo
ple that was sent to University of
ficials and the ASSU.
But the widespread support
failed to sway Assoc. Director of
Tresidder Union Paul Szczesiul,
and the University's original deci
sion remains unchanged.
"The Dec. 18 deadline still
stands," said Szczesiul.
Due to staff cuts, Szczesiul'sof

fice was no longer able to monitor
the vendors' business licenses,
and he was notified that the ven
dors pose a potential tax liability
threat because they conduct com
mercial activity on land that is
designated as tax-free.
"The petitions really just
underscored how much people like
to have them out there," said
Szczesiul. "It was never our inten
tion to throw them out on a whim.
There are practical reasons behind
everything."
Bobbi Braden, director of Tresid
der Union, said, "As far as I know,
nothing has changed. We received
the petitions, but the tax concerns
and staff shortages are still there."
In mid-October, Stanford
declared that the vendors had to
leave White Plaza by Nov. 1, but
they were granted an extension
until the end of fall quarter to
give them more time to take
advantage of the lucrative Christ
mas season before relocating.
The petition requested that
the University "refrain from
enacting the policy to eliminate
vendors from using White Plaza
to sell their arts and crafts."
"Vending in White Plaza is a
tradition that goes back a quarter
century. These vendors make
White Plaza what it is today, and
add to the vitality of the entire
Stanford Campus. I hope they
remain here," the petition said.
Ultimately, the petition did not
change the University's decision,
said Freed. "The decision was
firm. Szczesiul had the stack on
his desk, and I told him about
some other ideas," said Freed.
"But he seemed like he really did
not want to deal with it, that the
original problems were still there."
Freed suggested that one day
each month, vendors would come
in and sign a form provided by the
State Board of Equalization that
would free the University of any

liability for uncollected sales taxes.
Szczesiul stated that he was
"not sure if this would really pro
tect the University."
He said he plans to check with
the State Board of Equalization
later this week.
"This still only addresses the
sales tax issue though," he added.
Freed also suggested that "the
vendors enforce and monitor the
use of business licenses between
themselves so that all comply so
that everyone could stay."
According to Freed, Szczesiul
raised fair objections to all of the
alternatives, but Szczesiul could
not comment on how or if the
ASSU might become involved.
With no hope of reconsideration
by the administration, ASSU inter
vention is the only other source of
hope for the vendors, said Freed.
