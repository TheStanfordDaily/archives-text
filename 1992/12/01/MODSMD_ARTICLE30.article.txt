# Athletes of the Week

### 
While the rest of campus was getting
ready for a relaxing Thanksgiving Break, the
Athletes of the Week put thoughts of
turkeys aside to concentrate on turning in
outstanding performances.
Senior Gary Stolz snatched second place
in the NCAA cross country championships,
surprising the field, while senior volleyball
tri-captain Bev Oden garnered the Out
standing Player honors at the Banker's

Classic.
Stolz went into the NCAA meet in Bloom
ington, Ind. hoping to finish in the top 20,
coming out with more than he bargained for
with a huge second-place effort.
Gaining All-America status, Stolz
crushed his Pacific 10 Conference nemesis,
Joe Kapkory of Washington State, to finish
in 30 minutes, 56 seconds, behind Olympian
Bob Kennedy of Indiana.
After finishing second in the tough field
of the Stanford Invitational, third at Pac
10's and second in District 8 competition,
Stolz translated his West Coast success in
the Midwest, making his mark on the
national scene. Even more promising is
Stolz's remaining year of eligibility.

Oden has keyed up her play as the volley
ball squad nears the NCAA tournament,
leading Stanford to a win in the Banker's
Classic tourney last weekend in Stockton.
Registering .478 and .242 hitting percent
ages in Stanford's matches against UC-
Santa Barbara and Pacific, along with 27
kills for the tourney, Oden, as usual, stood
out as the Cardinal's most lethal offensive
weapon.
Coming from an family of exceptional vol
leyball players, Oden was named Volleyball
Monthly's high school Player of the Year as
a senior at Irvine High School in southern
California.
At Stanford, Oden continues to dominate,

already racking up three consecutive All
American seasons. If Oden makes the All-
America first team this year, she will be the
first women's volleyball player in history to
earn the honor four years in a row.
Oden was named the 1990 NCAA Player
of the Year, and will lead the Cardinal at
home in its upcoming NCAA tournament
opener on Friday against Pittsburgh.
