# Sports fan final exam
## 
### 
So you call yourself a sports
fan? We'll see. A jock-ular
test of your mettle is what
follows:
1. Nike's latest ad campaign
reports that Deion Sanders
(a.k.a. Sander Claus) has
ousted Kris Kringle in an
arctic coup d'6tat. Deion's
first move was to:
a) fit his elfin cadre with dia
mond studs and black ban
danas
b) teach Rudolph the "high
step"
c) put an unsuspecting Mrs.
Claus in her place with a cel
ebratory bucket of ice water
2. Flagboy was unable to pum
mel the banner thief from
Cal's student section because:
a) Berkeley's lone competent
security guard restrained him
b) the Weenie fended him off
with a stash of kryptonite
c) "His pelvis was twitchin' like
he had a caterpillar in his
Calvins"
3. Cincinnati Reds owner
Marge Schott, having admit
ted making reference to
"money-grubbing Jews" and
"million-dollar niggers," is
presently being sued (sur
prise!) by a former employee.
Baseball's executive council
has responded by:
a) ordering her to relocate the
Reds somewhere in eastern
Germany
b) finally permitting her to
become a Review columnist
c) sentencing her to 15 years as
Jimmy the Greek's mistress,
without possibility of parole
4. You realize that you are
irreversibly spiraling toward
a bald, portly existence. Do
you:
a) curse that recurring vision of
Telly Sevalis in an oversized
Dodgers uniform as you spike
your Slimfast shakes with
Rogaine
b) remain in a state of denial (i.e.
continue to mislead the Stan
ford community by running a
two-year-old picture with
your weekly sports column)
c) let nature run its course and
wait for someone to offer you
nano-millions for a heavy
weight title bout
5. In an effort to recoup rev
enue lost to free student tick
ets, the Athletic Department
has decided to produce a
scries of instructional videos.
The first volume will include:
a) "When you're a squirt but

still want to play football" —
by Eric Abrams
b) "Post play for pre-meds" with
Val Whiting
c) "Water ski with me" — by
David Harbor
6. The expansion Colorado
Rockies have the potential
to become:
a) the first team to lose 130

games in one season
b) the first team to have a week
end series snou/ed out
c) the first team to offer ticket
discounts with proof of het
erosexual ity
7. The baseball gods let the
Blue Jays win their first
World Series because:
a) they weren't too keen on suf
fering through a six-month
long Tomahawk Chop
b) it was the only way to save
Canada from Balkanization
c) the backwards playing of "O
Canada" that accompanied
the upside-down flag revealed
no trace of satanic lyrics
8. Washington quarterback
Billy Joe Hobcrt's $50,000
loan was finally investigated
and found in violation of
NCAA guidelines:
a) when he started complaining
about the pay cut he'd be
forced to take after graduation
b) when he told his coach he got
the NSX for a trade-in on his
Justy
c) after the State Department
heard he was directing Clin
ton's Seattle headquarters
9. The San Francisco Giants
could enhance the atmo
sphere at home games only by:
a) forcing all would-be drunken
brawlers to settle their dif
ferences fat belly to fat belly,
sumo style
b) making those chili dogs a crime
c) flashing subliminal, spirit
lifting messages on the
scoreboard . . "Hey, you
could be in Anchorage"

Kevin Jeffery will lie vacationing
at Oxford for six months in a last
ditch effort to learn rugby. When
he returns, he'd love to scrum
with each and every one of you.
