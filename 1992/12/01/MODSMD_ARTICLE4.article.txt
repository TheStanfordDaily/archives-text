# CPPC advises caution with databanks
## Job-seekers benefit from resume-storing systems, but should be wary

While more and more corporations are rely
ing on independent resume databanks in their
recruiting, job-seeking college students should
approach this latest hiring practice with both ex
pectation and caution, according to the director
of the Career Planning and Placement Center.
"Students should definitely throw in their
hats into the job market by using the resume
databank but realize at the same time that it's
just another way to expose oneself to the mar
ket," said CPPC Director Ruth Schneider.
Job seekers are now able to store their re
sumes in electronic databanks operated by in
dependent companies, and employers contact
the databanks for suitable applicants whenever
there is an open position in their corporations.
Schneider said that the databank most fre

quently used by Stanford students is KiNexus,
while alumni tend to rely on University
Pro Net.
Although some students who use the ser
vices of such companies do reap benefits, both
job-seekers and employers have yet to perfect
how they interact with each other through
electronic databanks. The databanks need to
represent "a viable group of potential employ
ees who need to feel like employers are paying
attention to them," Schneider said.
Another consideration is that resume data
banks generally do not attract a variety of job
seekers, but instead are geared towards those with
engineering or business degrees, Schneider said.
"Ideally, everyone should use databanks, but
people realize that the money lies with engineer
ing firms or firms looking for MBAs," she said.
Students and graduates who are listed with

companies like Pro Net and KiNexus report
varying degrees of success in their job search,
according to Schneider.
Pro Net, for instance, is "still in its infancy"
when dealing with liberal arts majors, she said.
Similarly, KiNexus has not enjoyed "a super
track record," Schneider said. "I haven't seen
anyone stand up and rave about it or jump for
joy," she said.
Jennifer Thomas, regional account manag
er at KiNexus National Data Center in Chica
go, said "standing out among the mass num
bers" of applicants may be a concern of stu
dents who submit their resumes to databanks.
At the same time, electronic databanks give
students access to "predominantly every in
dustry" in the country and provide corpora-
