# Fetishes for Asian females rooted in stereotypes, mystique

When the Rev. Diana Akiyama was in
grade school, a boy once turned turned to
her and said, "When I grow up I want to
marry someone like you."
When she asked him why, he replied,
"Because Japanese women make good
wives. They're obedient."
"I remember thinking, 'I wonder
where he got that idea? That's really
spooky,' " recalled Akiyama, an associate
dean of Memorial Church.
Years later, "spooky ideas" are still
floating around campus, say many Asian-
American women, frustrating them with
demeaning stereotypes in a scenario
where sexism meets racism at an ugly in
tersection.
"I do notice a larger percentage of
Asian women with white men on campus
rather than the other way around," said
Rick Yuen, director of the Asian American
Activities Center. "I'm not sure why
that's so, but one of the factors might be a
preference for Asian women on the part of

some white men."
On an ethnically diverse campus such
as Stanford, in which Asians make up
about a quarter of the student body, dat
ing between Caucasians and Asians is
hardly an anomaly. What stands out,
however, is the preponderance of Asian
woman-Caucasian male couples on cam
pus.
"In some cases, a fetish for Asian
women might come into play. It's definite
ly a phenomenon," said Alice Yang-Mur
ray, who teaches a class on the history of
Asian-American families.
Used in both jokes and in serious accu
sations, commonly used terms like "Asian
fetish," "Eggs," "Asiaphiles" and "Yellow

Fever" have sprung out of a phenomenon
with blurred parameters: Is the fetish
simply a preference for a certain look, or is
it linked to deeper stereotypes of Asian
women?
Though the issue is far from clear-cut,
many students contend that a fetish for
Asian women, at some level, does exist at
Stanford.
"There's no question about it. It defi
nitely happens at Stanford," said senior
Dana Won. "I've talked to white guys who
specifically go out with Asian women just
because they're Asian women."
"I see it on campus and it gives me the
creeps," said junior Carol Shi. "Just the
way they talk to you . . . you can tell
they're going for the mysterious, sweeter,
subservient stuff."
The perception of subserviency appeals
to "Paul," a white sophomore who says he
finds Asian women more "amenable."
"If you look at the word 'subserviency'
in the literal sense, I have to say that I find
Asian women to be more so," said Paul
