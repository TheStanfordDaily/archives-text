# Fetishes for Asian females rooted in stereotypes, mystique
## 
### Carrie Chang Editorial staff 
When the Rev. Diana Akiyama was in
grade school, a boy once turned turned to
her and said, "When I grow up I want to
marry someone like you."
When she asked him why, he replied,
"Because Japanese women make good
wives. They're obedient."
"I remember thinking, 'I wonder
where he got that idea? That's really
spooky,' " recalled Akiyama, an associate
dean of Memorial Church.
Years later, "spooky ideas" are still
floating around campus, say many Asian-
American women, frustrating them with
demeaning stereotypes in a scenario
where sexism meets racism at an ugly in
tersection.
"I do notice a larger percentage of
Asian women with white men on campus
rather than the other way around," said
Rick Yuen, director of the Asian American
Activities Center. "I'm not sure why
that's so, but one of the factors might be a
preference for Asian women on the part of

some white men."
On an ethnically diverse campus such
as Stanford, in which Asians make up
about a quarter of the student body, dat
ing between Caucasians and Asians is
hardly an anomaly. What stands out,
however, is the preponderance of Asian
woman-Caucasian male couples on cam
pus.
"In some cases, a fetish for Asian
women might come into play. It's definite
ly a phenomenon," said Alice Yang-Mur
ray, who teaches a class on the history of
Asian-American families.
Used in both jokes and in serious accu
sations, commonly used terms like "Asian
fetish," "Eggs," "Asiaphiles" and "Yellow

Fever" have sprung out of a phenomenon
with blurred parameters: Is the fetish
simply a preference for a certain look, or is
it linked to deeper stereotypes of Asian
women?
Though the issue is far from clear-cut,
many students contend that a fetish for
Asian women, at some level, does exist at
Stanford.
"There's no question about it. It defi
nitely happens at Stanford," said senior
Dana Won. "I've talked to white guys who
specifically go out with Asian women just
because they're Asian women."
"I see it on campus and it gives me the
creeps," said junior Carol Shi. "Just the
way they talk to you . . . you can tell
they're going for the mysterious, sweeter,
subservient stuff."
The perception of subserviency appeals
to "Paul," a white sophomore who says he
finds Asian women more "amenable."
"If you look at the word 'subserviency'
in the literal sense, I have to say that I find
Asian women to be more so," said Paul

who only dates Asian-American
women. "They tend to be quieter
and they don't contradict me as
much, so it all works out for the
better."
I can smell it
Wary of "Asiaphiles" on cam
pus, some women say the have
begun to pay attention to the way
various Caucasian males "oper
ate."
"Sometimes when I speak to
someone I think, 'Does this guy
have a fetish?' I've clued in on
things like this. I can smell it,"
said Won. "People who say
there's no such thing as an Asian
fetish will totally disagree with
me and say that I'm being a bitch.
It's hard to exactly describe in
words what it is, but you can tell."
Some cite superficial interest
in Asian culture as a tip-off.
"It comes more in subtlety in
treatment. Like he says 'Oh, I like
people like you.' Or he does dim
sum every weekend and knows
phrases like 'Ni how ma?'('How
are you?' in Mandarin)" said
junior Patty Tsai.

'I know a guy who
said he'd put Okada
and EAST on his
draw card just so
he could hit on
Asian women.'

In some cases, Asiaphiles go to
great lengths of cultured immer
sion with ulterior motives, even
choosing to draw into dorms with
many Asians.
"I know a guy who said he'd
put Okada and EAST on his draw
card just so he could hit on Asian
women," said "Jeannie," a sopho
more. "He also manages to take
Asian language courses every
quarter for the same reason."
"Brian," a senior, claims to
have "had a preference for Asian
women" but stopped short of
claiming any sort of fetish for sub
serviency. But that's not to say
that there aren't those who have
them. "I've actually heard of guys
who will go to a party at Stanford
and locate all the Asian women in
the room regardless of the way
they look," he said.
Sometimes, however, a fetish
can translate into blatant sexual
harassment.
After being pursued and even
tually threatened by a white
senior three years ago, Asian-
American graduate student
Tiffany Liu finally reported the
case to a resident dean.
"I'm not exaggerating. I

I've noticed a lot of
white guys who also
have "Yellow Fever." I
know four or five like
this. Sometimes we
joke around and say,
"Oh, you have it
too?"'

walked in the [dean's office], and
there were seven or eight other
Asian women sitting there with
different harassment stories,"
said Liu. "He had followed Asian
women, gone through their
underwear drawers and spied on
them as they were undressing. He
had been doing this kind of thing
since freshman year."
Some men prefer blondes
Many white men contend that
such extreme fetishes are rare,
adding that their own intentions,
which do not involve damaging
stereotypes, are often misunder
stood and twisted by politically
correct attitudes on campus.
"This whole thing is so
overblown," said "Evan," a white
senior. "I like dark hair and dark
features, the way some men like
blondes. At Stanford, which is so
edgy and politically biased, it's
like looked upon as 'Omigod!
Asian fetish!' It's really over-ana
lyzed."
Some argue that most attempts
to explain a fetish for Asian
women are flawed, emphasizing
that attraction cannot be held up
to analysis or interpretation.
"I don't really know why, but
when I'm walking on campus, I'll
just naturally look at Asian
women," said junior Joe Gerber.
"It's like 'Why do I like the color
green?' or 'Why do I like choco
late?' It's fully an aesthetic thing
I suppose."
"It's attraction, it's not an
obsession, and I don't think it's
frowned upon," said "Kevin," a
white sophomore who added that
a preference for dating Asian
women wasn't that uncommon.
"I've noticed a lot of white guys
who also have 'Yellow Fever.' I
know four or five like this. Some
times we joke around and say,
"Oh, you have it too?" he said.
"Chris," a graduate student,
emphasized that rather than
being attracted to negative stereo
types of Asian women, he was
drawn to "good values of Asian
families as a result of being isolat
ed from the corrupting values of
American culture."
"I think there are men out
there who fit the description of an
Asian fetish maniac, but I would
hardly put myself in the same cat
egory," he said.
Yet many, such as senior Har

rison Hsiesh, however, still ques
tion the underlying motives of
these preferences and attitudes.
"I think sometimes there's a
preference for Asian woman
because of certain stereotypes
that are ingrained in their think
ing," he said.
Geisha girls
Akiyama traces such stereo
types back to the way American
troops treated women in the Viet
nam war, as well as the prostitu
tion of Asian women during the
war as a historical factor which
fostered negative images.
"I think a lot of those men
came back with very fixed ideas
about the desirability of Asian
women because of their ability to
so fully exploit women in Vietnam
during that time," she said.
Perceptions of Asian women
are also influenced by the media,
with images ranging from geisha
girls to the exotic dragon lady and
the frail, pathetic Madame But
terfly.
"It's a double-bind," said Tsai.
"Because if she (identifies) with

these images, she neglects her
true identity, and if she defies it,
she's a militant bitch."
"It really really pisses me off
there's this stereotype that Asian
women are frail and extremely
feminine and oh . . . it's binding. I
just feel a lot of pressure to be
that way," said senior Brenda Ky,
adding that she has dated white
men who have marvelled at how
"cute" and "exotic" she was.
It's the "Asian mystique," the
two-dimensional assessment of
"exotic" characteristics that leaves
many women feeling as if their
person is being drowned in a sea of
misperceptions that have spilled
onto campus.
"I was in Green (Library) when
this guy comes up to me and
starts saying things like 'Hey, I
bet you make great won ton soup
and How are you?' in Chinese
even though I'm Korean," said
"Amy," a junior. "When I told
him to go screw himself, he looked
kind of surprised, as if he didn't
expect me to use that kind of lan
guage. I wish people like that
would just get a clue."

me and say that I'm being a bitch.
It's hard to exactly describe in
words what it is, but you can tell."
Some cite superficial interest
in Asian culture as a tip-off.
"It comes more in subtlety in
treatment. Like he says 'Oh, I like
people like you.' Or he does dim

phrases like 'Ni how ma?'('How
are you?' in Mandarin)" said
junior Patty Tsai.

'I know a guy who
said he'd put Okada
and EAST on his
draw card just so
he could hit on
Asian women.'

In some cases, Asiaphiles go to
great lengths of cultured immer
sion with ulterior motives, even
choosing to draw into dorms with
many Asians.
"I know a guy who said he'd
put Okada and EAST on his draw
card just so he could hit on Asian
women," said "Jeannie," a sopho
more. "He also manages to take
Asian language courses every
quarter for the same reason."
"Brian," a senior, claims to
have "had a preference for Asian
women" but stopped short of
claiming any sort of fetish for sub
serviency. But that's not to say
that there aren't those who have
them. "I've actually heard of guys
who will go to a party at Stanford
and locate all the Asian women in
the room regardless of the way
they look," he said.
Sometimes, however, a fetish
can translate into blatant sexual
harassment.
After being pursued and even
tually threatened by a white
senior three years ago, Asian-
American graduate student
Tiffany Liu finally reported the
case to a resident dean.
"I'm not exaggerating. I

I've noticed a lot of
white guys who also
have "Yellow Fever." I
know four or five like
this. Sometimes we
joke around and say,
"Oh, you have it
too?"'

walked in the [dean's office], and
there were seven or eight other
Asian women sitting there with
different harassment stories,"
said Liu. "He had followed Asian
women, gone through their
underwear drawers and spied on
them as they were undressing. He
had been doing this kind of thing
since freshman year."
Some men prefer blondes
Many white men contend that
such extreme fetishes are rare,
adding that their own intentions,
which do not involve damaging
stereotypes, are often misunder
stood and twisted by politically
correct attitudes on campus.
"This whole thing is so
overblown," said "Evan," a white
senior. "I like dark hair and dark
features, the way some men like
blondes. At Stanford, which is so
edgy and politically biased, it's
like looked upon as 'Omigod!
Asian fetish!' It's really over-ana
lyzed."
Some argue that most attempts
to explain a fetish for Asian
women are flawed, emphasizing
that attraction cannot be held up
to analysis or interpretation.
"I don't really know why, but
when I'm walking on campus, I'll
just naturally look at Asian
women," said junior Joe Gerber.
"It's like 'Why do I like the color
green?' or 'Why do I like choco
late?' It's fully an aesthetic thing
I suppose."
"It's attraction, it's not an
obsession, and I don't think it's
frowned upon," said "Kevin," a
white sophomore who added that
a preference for dating Asian
women wasn't that uncommon.
"I've noticed a lot of white guys
who also have 'Yellow Fever.' I
know four or five like this. Some
times we joke around and say,
"Oh, you have it too?" he said.
"Chris," a graduate student,
emphasized that rather than
being attracted to negative stereo
types of Asian women, he was
drawn to "good values of Asian
families as a result of being isolat
ed from the corrupting values of
American culture."
"I think there are men out
there who fit the description of an
Asian fetish maniac, but I would
hardly put myself in the same cat
egory," he said.
Yet many, such as senior Har

rison Hsiesh, however, still ques
tion the underlying motives of
these preferences and attitudes.
"I think sometimes there's a
preference for Asian woman
because of certain stereotypes
that are ingrained in their think
ing," he said.
Geisha girls
Akiyama traces such stereo
types back to the way American
troops treated women in the Viet
nam war, as well as the prostitu
tion of Asian women during the
war as a historical factor which
fostered negative images.
"I think a lot of those men
came back with very fixed ideas
about the desirability of Asian
women because of their ability to
so fully exploit women in Vietnam
during that time," she said.
Perceptions of Asian women
are also influenced by the media,
with images ranging from geisha
girls to the exotic dragon lady and
the frail, pathetic Madame But
terfly.
"It's a double-bind," said Tsai.
"Because if she (identifies) with

these images, she neglects her
true identity, and if she defies it,
she's a militant bitch."
"It really really pisses me off
there's this stereotype that Asian
women are frail and extremely
feminine and oh . . . it's binding. I
just feel a lot of pressure to be
that way," said senior Brenda Ky,
adding that she has dated white
men who have marvelled at how
"cute" and "exotic" she was.
It's the "Asian mystique," the
two-dimensional assessment of
"exotic" characteristics that leaves
many women feeling as if their
person is being drowned in a sea of
misperceptions that have spilled
onto campus.
"I was in Green (Library) when
this guy comes up to me and
starts saying things like 'Hey, I
bet you make great won ton soup
and How are you?' in Chinese
even though I'm Korean," said
"Amy," a junior. "When I told
him to go screw himself, he looked
kind of surprised, as if he didn't
expect me to use that kind of lan
guage. I wish people like that
would just get a clue."

When the Rev. Diana Akiyama was in
grade school, a boy once turned turned to
her and said, "When I grow up I want to
marry someone like you."
When she asked him why, he replied,
"Because Japanese women make good
wives. They're obedient."
"I remember thinking, 'I wonder
where he got that idea? That's really
spooky,' " recalled Akiyama, an associate
dean of Memorial Church.
Years later, "spooky ideas" are still
floating around campus, say many Asian-
American women, frustrating them with
demeaning stereotypes in a scenario
where sexism meets racism at an ugly in
tersection.
"I do notice a larger percentage of
Asian women with white men on campus
rather than the other way around," said
Rick Yuen, director of the Asian American
Activities Center. "I'm not sure why
that's so, but one of the factors might be a
preference for Asian women on the part of

some white men."
On an ethnically diverse campus such
as Stanford, in which Asians make up
about a quarter of the student body, dat
ing between Caucasians and Asians is
hardly an anomaly. What stands out,
however, is the preponderance of Asian
woman-Caucasian male couples on cam
pus.
"In some cases, a fetish for Asian
women might come into play. It's definite
ly a phenomenon," said Alice Yang-Mur
ray, who teaches a class on the history of
Asian-American families.
Used in both jokes and in serious accu
sations, commonly used terms like "Asian
fetish," "Eggs," "Asiaphiles" and "Yellow

Fever" have sprung out of a phenomenon
with blurred parameters: Is the fetish
simply a preference for a certain look, or is
it linked to deeper stereotypes of Asian
women?
Though the issue is far from clear-cut,
many students contend that a fetish for
Asian women, at some level, does exist at
Stanford.
"There's no question about it. It defi
nitely happens at Stanford," said senior
Dana Won. "I've talked to white guys who
specifically go out with Asian women just
because they're Asian women."
"I see it on campus and it gives me the
creeps," said junior Carol Shi. "Just the
way they talk to you . . . you can tell
they're going for the mysterious, sweeter,
subservient stuff."
The perception of subserviency appeals
to "Paul," a white sophomore who says he
finds Asian women more "amenable."
"If you look at the word 'subserviency'
in the literal sense, I have to say that I find
Asian women to be more so," said Paul

who only dates Asian-American
women. "They tend to be quieter
and they don't contradict me as
much, so it all works out for the
better."
I can smell it
Wary of "Asiaphiles" on cam
pus, some women say the have
begun to pay attention to the way
various Caucasian males "oper
ate."
"Sometimes when I speak to
someone I think, 'Does this guy
have a fetish?' I've clued in on
things like this. I can smell it,"
said Won. "People who say
there's no such thing as an Asian
fetish will totally disagree with
me and say that I'm being a bitch.

late?' It's fully an aesthetic thing
I suppose."
"It's attraction, it's not an
obsession, and I don't think it's
frowned upon," said "Kevin," a
white sophomore who added that
a preference for dating Asian
women wasn't that uncommon.
"I've noticed a lot of white guys
who also have 'Yellow Fever.' I
know four or five like this. Some
times we joke around and say,
"Oh, you have it too?" he said.
"Chris," a graduate student,
emphasized that rather than
being attracted to negative stereo
types of Asian women, he was
drawn to "good values of Asian
families as a result of being isolat
ed from the corrupting values of
American culture."
"I think there are men out
there who fit the description of an
Asian fetish maniac, but I would
hardly put myself in the same cat
egory," he said.
Yet many, such as senior Har

rison Hsiesh, however, still ques
tion the underlying motives of
these preferences and attitudes.
"I think sometimes there's a
preference for Asian woman
because of certain stereotypes
that are ingrained in their think
ing," he said.
Geisha girls
Akiyama traces such stereo
types back to the way American
troops treated women in the Viet
nam war, as well as the prostitu
tion of Asian women during the
war as a historical factor which
fostered negative images.
"I think a lot of those men
came back with very fixed ideas
about the desirability of Asian
women because of their ability to
so fully exploit women in Vietnam
during that time," she said.
Perceptions of Asian women
are also influenced by the media,
with images ranging from geisha
girls to the exotic dragon lady and
the frail, pathetic Madame But
terfly.
"It's a double-bind," said Tsai.
"Because if she (identifies) with

these images, she neglects her
true identity, and if she defies it,
she's a militant bitch."
"It really really pisses me off
there's this stereotype that Asian
women are frail and extremely
feminine and oh . . . it's binding. I
just feel a lot of pressure to be
that way," said senior Brenda Ky,
adding that she has dated white
men who have marvelled at how
"cute" and "exotic" she was.
It's the "Asian mystique," the
two-dimensional assessment of
"exotic" characteristics that leaves
many women feeling as if their
person is being drowned in a sea of
misperceptions that have spilled
onto campus.
"I was in Green (Library) when
this guy comes up to me and
starts saying things like 'Hey, I
bet you make great won ton soup
and How are you?' in Chinese
even though I'm Korean," said
"Amy," a junior. "When I told
him to go screw himself, he looked
kind of surprised, as if he didn't
expect me to use that kind of lan
guage. I wish people like that
would just get a clue."

When the Rev. Diana Akiyama was in
grade school, a boy once turned turned to
her and said, "When I grow up I want to
marry someone like you."
When she asked him why, he replied,
"Because Japanese women make good
wives. They're obedient."
"I remember thinking, 'I wonder
where he got that idea? That's really
spooky,' " recalled Akiyama, an associate
dean of Memorial Church.
Years later, "spooky ideas" are still
floating around campus, say many Asian-
American women, frustrating them with
demeaning stereotypes in a scenario
where sexism meets racism at an ugly in
tersection.
"I do notice a larger percentage of
Asian women with white men on campus
rather than the other way around," said
Rick Yuen, director of the Asian American
Activities Center. "I'm not sure why
that's so, but one of the factors might be a
preference for Asian women on the part of

some white men."
On an ethnically diverse campus such
as Stanford, in which Asians make up
about a quarter of the student body, dat
ing between Caucasians and Asians is
hardly an anomaly. What stands out,
however, is the preponderance of Asian
woman-Caucasian male couples on cam
pus.
"In some cases, a fetish for Asian
women might come into play. It's definite
ly a phenomenon," said Alice Yang-Mur
ray, who teaches a class on the history of
Asian-American families.
Used in both jokes and in serious accu
sations, commonly used terms like "Asian
fetish," "Eggs," "Asiaphiles" and "Yellow

Fever" have sprung out of a phenomenon
with blurred parameters: Is the fetish
simply a preference for a certain look, or is
it linked to deeper stereotypes of Asian
women?
Though the issue is far from clear-cut,
many students contend that a fetish for
Asian women, at some level, does exist at
Stanford.
"There's no question about it. It defi
nitely happens at Stanford," said senior
Dana Won. "I've talked to white guys who
specifically go out with Asian women just
because they're Asian women."
"I see it on campus and it gives me the
creeps," said junior Carol Shi. "Just the
way they talk to you . . . you can tell
they're going for the mysterious, sweeter,
subservient stuff."
The perception of subserviency appeals
to "Paul," a white sophomore who says he
finds Asian women more "amenable."
"If you look at the word 'subserviency'
in the literal sense, I have to say that I find
Asian women to be more so," said Paul

who only dates Asian-American
women. "They tend to be quieter
and they don't contradict me as
much, so it all works out for the
better."
I can smell it
Wary of "Asiaphiles" on cam
pus, some women say the have
begun to pay attention to the way
various Caucasian males "oper
ate."
"Sometimes when I speak to
someone I think, 'Does this guy
have a fetish?' I've clued in on
things like this. I can smell it,"
said Won. "People who say
there's no such thing as an Asian
fetish will totally disagree with
me and say that I'm being a bitch.
It's hard to exactly describe in
words what it is, but you can tell."
Some cite superficial interest
in Asian culture as a tip-off.
"It comes more in subtlety in
treatment. Like he says 'Oh, I like
people like you.' Or he does dim
sum every weekend and knows
phrases like 'Ni how ma?'('How
are you?' in Mandarin)" said
junior Patty Tsai.

'I know a guy who
said he'd put Okada
and EAST on his
draw card just so
he could hit on
Asian women.'

In some cases, Asiaphiles go to
great lengths of cultured immer
sion with ulterior motives, even
choosing to draw into dorms with
many Asians.
"I know a guy who said he'd
put Okada and EAST on his draw
card just so he could hit on Asian
women," said "Jeannie," a sopho
more. "He also manages to take
Asian language courses every
quarter for the same reason."
"Brian," a senior, claims to
have "had a preference for Asian
women" but stopped short of
claiming any sort of fetish for sub
serviency. But that's not to say
that there aren't those who have
them. "I've actually heard of guys
who will go to a party at Stanford
and locate all the Asian women in
the room regardless of the way
they look," he said.
Sometimes, however, a fetish
can translate into blatant sexual
harassment.
After being pursued and even
tually threatened by a white
senior three years ago, Asian-
American graduate student
Tiffany Liu finally reported the
case to a resident dean.
"I'm not exaggerating. I

I've noticed a lot of
white guys who also
have "Yellow Fever." I
know four or five like
this. Sometimes we
joke around and say,
"Oh, you have it
too?"'

walked in the [dean's office], and
there were seven or eight other
Asian women sitting there with
different harassment stories,"
said Liu. "He had followed Asian
women, gone through their
underwear drawers and spied on
them as they were undressing. He
had been doing this kind of thing
since freshman year."
Some men prefer blondes
Many white men contend that
such extreme fetishes are rare,
adding that their own intentions,
which do not involve damaging
stereotypes, are often misunder
stood and twisted by politically
correct attitudes on campus.
"This whole thing is so
overblown," said "Evan," a white
senior. "I like dark hair and dark
features, the way some men like
blondes. At Stanford, which is so
edgy and politically biased, it's
like looked upon as 'Omigod!
Asian fetish!' It's really over-ana
lyzed."
Some argue that most attempts
to explain a fetish for Asian
women are flawed, emphasizing
that attraction cannot be held up
to analysis or interpretation.
"I don't really know why, but
when I'm walking on campus, I'll
just naturally look at Asian
women," said junior Joe Gerber.
"It's like 'Why do I like the color
green?' or 'Why do I like choco
late?' It's fully an aesthetic thing
I suppose."
"It's attraction, it's not an
obsession, and I don't think it's
frowned upon," said "Kevin," a
white sophomore who added that
a preference for dating Asian
women wasn't that uncommon.
"I've noticed a lot of white guys
