# Asian males say they're getting dealt a bad hand in media portrayal, the dating game

Ever heard of an Asian male fetish?
44 1 don't know anything breathing on
the planet who has that," said junior
Mike Duh.
While the stereotype of exotic sub
serviency haunts some Asian women,
Asian men are often seen as "geeky" and
"socially clueless." This unflattering
image, coupled with the preponderance of
Asian female-Caucasian male relation
ships on campus, has left many Asian
men caught in a Catch-22 rejection; be
sides being excluded from interracial rela
tionships, some of Stanford's Asian men
feel slighted by Asian women as well.
"Asian men ... they're pissed off,"
said Rick Yuen, director of the Asian

American Activities Center. "I think it
could be that they might want to date
white women and are being rejected,
but also that they are feeling betrayed
by Asian women."
Many Asian males argue that common
stereotypes of being overly studious and
shy coupled with their generally smaller
build compared to males of other races
have placed them in this double-bind of
rejection. But they say the most damag
ing component could be the way Asian
men are inevitably portrayed as emascu
lated characters in the media, cast as ei
ther evil eunuches or unequivocal nerds.
The Long Duck Dong factor
"I can tell you why this is happening
in three words," said Duh. "Long
Duck Dong (the socially clueless
Asian character in Sixteen Can
dles who ran around asking
'What's a-happenin' hot stuff?')."
While actresses like Joan Chen
and Tamilyn Tomita are usually
cast in alluring roles, Asian men
are more often portrayed as comic
freaks or asexual wimps.
"How often do you see studly
Asian men in movies?" asked
Duh. "All you see are dorks with
heavy Asian accents."
"If you look at the media,
there are hardly any positive rep
resentations of Asian guys in
interracial relationships," said
Dr. Karen Huang, a psychologist
with Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services.
And while flattering images of
Asian men are scarce, famous and
successful Asian women in the
media are more prevalent; more
often than not they have Cau
casian spouses.
"Look at Connie Chung and
Amy Tan, they're all married to
Caucasian men," said Huang.
If images in the media haunt
Asian men, stereotypes on cam
pus persist as well, painting a pic
ture of men who, as one Asian-
American woman said, "do prob
lem sets, play volleyball and listen
to Erasure all day."
"There's a lack of individual
ism in that perception," said
senior Kenneth Tan, issues chair
of Asian American Students Asso
ciation. "No one wants to go out
with a cardboard figure who plays
volleyball and wears baseball caps
all day."
The prevalent image of clones
with baseball caps and calculators
cuts a figure far from dashing.
"You don't say, 'God that man
is so sexy â€” he finishes his prob
lem sets on time,' " said junior
Chris Yeh.
"When I go to Chinatown and
see old Chinese bachelors sitting
in the park by themselves, I get
really depressed," said Tan.
Some say such subtle images
turn off all women, leaving Asian
men with the short end of the
stick. . .
"Short end of the stick?" asked
Duh. "That brings up another
stereotype."
Fear of rejection
Surrounded by negative
images which they feel diminish
their appeal to women, many
Asian men are reluctant to ask
out women of other races for fear
of rejection.
"We feel there's a 90 percent
chance we'd get dissed," said Tan.
"I'm not scared to ask a white
women out but there's always in
the back of my mind, 'Why would
they be attracted to me?' " said
sophomore Eric Tung.

"If you actually think like that,
you go in with an attitude of self
fulfilling prophecy," said gradu
ate student Pat Lin. But he added
that it might be true that many
women are preconditioned to see
Asian men as unromantic figures.
But senior Isolde Birdthistle,
who is Irish and is going out with
Lin, argues that not all women
are swayed by the negative stereo
types. "There are a lot of white
women who really consider Asian
men attractive. I don't think I'm
a rare exception," she said.
Boundary of two cultures
For some Asian men, the num
ber of many Asian women going
out with white men can be a sen
sitive issue, triggering hostility
and even bitterness. In their eyes,
dating outside the "ethnic pool"
signals a betrayal of their race.
"A lot Asian women are snow
blind twinkies who view having a
white boyfriend as a status sym
bol," complained "Kevin," an
Asian-American senior.
"The skewed ratio of interra
cial relationships on this campus
could mean that white women
aren't going out with Asian guys,
but what bothers me more is that
some Asian women are turning
their backs on their culture," said
Tan.
But junior Nancy Chiou dis
missed that idea as "ridiculous."
"Just because I'm going out
with someone who's white
doesn't mean I'm betraying half
my culture," she said.
Some women disagree that
Asian women prefer white men,
pointing out that other factors
come into play to explain the
interracial dating scene on cam
pus.
"A lot of Asian men tend to act
slower so Asian women don't real
ize they're interested until it's too
late," said senior Angela Chen,
adding that the socialization pro
cess of Asian men in this country
might leaving them feeling more
insecure.
"We are more insecure," said
Tan. "As an Asian living in Amer
ica, I find myself on the boundary
of two cultures. One culture
teaches me to be quiet and
reflect, while the other culture
says the ideal male is verbally
aggressive," he said, adding that
Asian ideals are often out of sync
with white, mainstream ideals of
masculinity.
Whatever reasons given, many
disgruntled students often find
themselves lost within a myriad
of racial explanations that
attempt to explicate but usually
never fully address the self
esteem questions inherent in the
dating predicament.
"We want to be able to look at
ourselves and say we're okay peo
ple, we're strong. There's differ
ent signals that tell us that," said
Yuen. "For Asian men, the signal
is, we're not okay because this
happens."
