# Experts gather to discuss future of Russia's defense
## 
### Michael Slemmer Howard Libit Staff writers 
Stanford scholars have assem
bled analysts from all over the
world for a conference today and
tomorrow on how to convert Russ
ian defense-related industries to
private, civilian companies.
U.S. and European experts and
representatives from Russian gov
ernment agencies will speak at a
Palo Alto hotel on economic and
political ramifications of the con
version process. The conference
will then make recommendations
to the governments of the United
States and Russia.
"It is a crucial part of Russian
economic reform to demilitarize
its economy," said Political Sci
ence Prof. David Holloway, co-di
rector of the Stanford Center for
International Security and Arms
Control, which is hosting the con
ference. "It is highly militarized,
and one of the great problems is
how to convert it."
In addition, executives from
both Russian and U.S. corpora
tions working on the transition will

present case studies on their work.
The Stanford center has al
ready been researching the prob
lem for several years, Holloway
said, and today's conference fol
lows several previous meetings be
tween Stanford scholars and
Russian government officials.
Holloway said he hopes that the
meeting will produce three mtyor
accomplishments:
• "Get a good sense of where the
whole process in Russia is to help
our research,"
• "Encourage contacts" between
the U.S. and Russian industry, and
• "Offer help and advice to the
conversion process."
David Bernstein, co-director of
the project and a research associ
ate at the Stanford Institute for
International Studies, said in a
statement that advisers at the
center discovered "a need for edu
cation in the most rudimentary
concepts of Western business."
Stanford's influence will even
tually expand into other former
Soviet republics, "certainly into
the Ukraine," Holloway said. "But
the biggest problem is definitely
Russia."
Advice will not be limited to
Russia, however. Holloway said
the United States also needs to be
concerned with converting its
own economy, although Ameri
ca's problems are "not on the
same scale as Russia."
The process is particularly

important to states such as Cali
fornia, he added.
Participants in the conference
will include Vasily Vesilov, assistant
to the first deputy minister of
defense in Russia; John Lloyd of the
Financial Times; Douglas Lavin,
deputy assistant secretary for
export enforcement; and Elizabeth
Wallace of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.

funded by the Carnegie Corpora
tion of New York, is not open to
