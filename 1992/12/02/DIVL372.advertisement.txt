Clive Barker
THE THIEF OF ALWAYS: A FABLE
(HarperCollins)
TONIGHT, December 2, 7:30 pm
Come meet Clive Barker, novelist (Imagica,
Weoveworld) and artist who also writes, directs
and produces for the stage and screen
("Hellraiser", "Nightbreed"). He'll be here to
read from his new book, THE THIEF OF ALWAYS:
A FABLE. "In a tale that manages to be both
cute and horrifying Barker puts the dark side
back into childhood fantasy, recalling the
violent undercurrents of the Grimm Brothers'
tales and other classics... a tale for all ages."
