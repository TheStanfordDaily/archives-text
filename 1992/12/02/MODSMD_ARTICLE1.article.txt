# Mixed views on identity
## Inter-racial students seek acceptance, individuality 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Most high school students find the "race and
ethnicity box" on their college applications one of
the easiest sections to complete.
But for students with a mixed ethnic heritages,
those little boxes represent a lifelong struggle to
find a label that fits their unique backgrounds.
"I guess the first thing I noticed when I was ap
plying was that I didn't really know how to identi
fy myself racially or ethnically," said Sonya Craw
ford, a half-Korean and half-Caucasian senior.

"It was always optional so a lot of times, I
wouldn't fill it out or I'd put other, but it felt real
ly weird doing that," she said.
The decision of how to identify oneself for the
admissions process is just one aspect of a larger
dilemma for mixed students.
After coming to the Farm, many mixed stu
dents must decide how they view their own ethnic
identity and whether they feel they belong to any
of Stanford's ethnic communities.
Yet often the decision of what label to adopt is
not just a question of personal perceptions. For ex
ample, calling oneself a student of color opens the
door to affirmative action programs, sometimes
making the difference between admission or rejec
tion from college and jobs. But that determination
can also stir up the resentment of many non-mixed
students of color.
What is a 'minority?'
"The issue of affirmative action is very sensitive
for people who are mixed, because [a student] can
be one eighth of a minority and still be considered
a minority," said Roberta Chavez, a junior whose
father is Mexican-American and mother is Cau
casian.
"IBeingl half, at least it's a little easier to say I
am a minority," she said. "But I've had people tell
me that either I got into Stanford because I'm a mi
nority or that I don't deserve to be counted as a mi
nority because I am part white, that there are other
full minority students who could have gotten in."
The question focuses on which part of a per
son's heritage is dominant. Students who are part
Caucasian must decide whether to focus on their
"white half or on their "other half."
"Should I apply as a minority or not? When I
usually apply for things I say I'm not sure if I'm a
minority or not, but I'll just tell you that I'm this
and this, so if you want to consider me a minority,
go ahead," explained Crawford, who has received
minority scholarships in the past.
But some mixed students will identify them
selves as white to avoid the implications of affir
mative action and the idea that they didn't really
deserve what they earned.
Senior Jeff Mar, who is part Chinese, part Mex
ican and part Caucasian, said he identified himself
as Caucasian on his application. "It sounds weird,
but one of the reasons I didn't [identify myself by
one of my ethnicities] was I didn't want to be ad
mitted just because of that," he said. "I just want
ed to be admitted for my paper and what I had."
But some mixed students have no qualms about
the application process and identifying themselves
by the "minority" part of their mixed ethnicity.
"By the time of the college admission process, I
though of myself as Mexican, so that's what I put
on my admission forms," said half-Mexican-Amer
ican and half-Caucasian sophomore Stet Jacoby.
Just 'a typical kid'
While mixed students have the ability to choose

Senior Jeff Mar said his mixed Chinese, Mexi
can and Caucasian heritage makes it hard for
him to identify with any specific ethnic group on
campus.
which ethnicity to adopt, many of them say that
decision is strongly affected by their physical ap
pearance.
"Basically I look pretty white. Some people
would go 'are you Chinese or Mexican,' but they
don't say it too much which is why it's hard for me
to identify with [those ethnicities] sometimes,"
Mar said. "I feel like I'm just a typical kid."
Senior Jennifer Williams has a Caucasian
mother and an African-American father, but she
said her appearance automatically identifies her
with being black.
"A person just looking at me is not going to see
me as having a white mother. They're going to see
me as a black woman. So it's not like I have a choice
of where I want to place myself in the community
here," she said.
"I've been very active in the black community
here, just because if I went and sat on a bus next to
a random white person, that random white person's
