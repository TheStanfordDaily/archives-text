# Mixed views on identity
## Inter-racial students seek acceptance, individuality 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Most high school students find the "race and
ethnicity box" on their college applications one of
the easiest sections to complete.
But for students with a mixed ethnic heritages,
those little boxes represent a lifelong struggle to
find a label that fits their unique backgrounds.
"I guess the first thing I noticed when I was ap
plying was that I didn't really know how to identi
fy myself racially or ethnically," said Sonya Craw
ford, a half-Korean and half-Caucasian senior.

"It was always optional so a lot of times, I
wouldn't fill it out or I'd put other, but it felt real
ly weird doing that," she said.
The decision of how to identify oneself for the
admissions process is just one aspect of a larger
dilemma for mixed students.
After coming to the Farm, many mixed stu
dents must decide how they view their own ethnic
identity and whether they feel they belong to any
of Stanford's ethnic communities.
Yet often the decision of what label to adopt is
not just a question of personal perceptions. For ex
ample, calling oneself a student of color opens the
door to affirmative action programs, sometimes
making the difference between admission or rejec
tion from college and jobs. But that determination
can also stir up the resentment of many non-mixed
students of color.
What is a 'minority?'
"The issue of affirmative action is very sensitive
for people who are mixed, because [a student] can
be one eighth of a minority and still be considered
a minority," said Roberta Chavez, a junior whose
father is Mexican-American and mother is Cau
casian.
"IBeingl half, at least it's a little easier to say I
am a minority," she said. "But I've had people tell
me that either I got into Stanford because I'm a mi
nority or that I don't deserve to be counted as a mi
nority because I am part white, that there are other
full minority students who could have gotten in."
The question focuses on which part of a per
son's heritage is dominant. Students who are part
Caucasian must decide whether to focus on their
"white half or on their "other half."
"Should I apply as a minority or not? When I
usually apply for things I say I'm not sure if I'm a
minority or not, but I'll just tell you that I'm this
and this, so if you want to consider me a minority,
go ahead," explained Crawford, who has received
minority scholarships in the past.
But some mixed students will identify them
selves as white to avoid the implications of affir
mative action and the idea that they didn't really
deserve what they earned.
Senior Jeff Mar, who is part Chinese, part Mex
ican and part Caucasian, said he identified himself
as Caucasian on his application. "It sounds weird,
but one of the reasons I didn't [identify myself by
one of my ethnicities] was I didn't want to be ad
mitted just because of that," he said. "I just want
ed to be admitted for my paper and what I had."
But some mixed students have no qualms about
the application process and identifying themselves
by the "minority" part of their mixed ethnicity.
"By the time of the college admission process, I
though of myself as Mexican, so that's what I put
on my admission forms," said half-Mexican-Amer
ican and half-Caucasian sophomore Stet Jacoby.
Just 'a typical kid'
While mixed students have the ability to choose

Senior Jeff Mar said his mixed Chinese, Mexi
can and Caucasian heritage makes it hard for
him to identify with any specific ethnic group on
campus.
which ethnicity to adopt, many of them say that
decision is strongly affected by their physical ap
pearance.
"Basically I look pretty white. Some people
would go 'are you Chinese or Mexican,' but they
don't say it too much which is why it's hard for me
to identify with [those ethnicities] sometimes,"
Mar said. "I feel like I'm just a typical kid."
Senior Jennifer Williams has a Caucasian
mother and an African-American father, but she
said her appearance automatically identifies her
with being black.
"A person just looking at me is not going to see
me as having a white mother. They're going to see
me as a black woman. So it's not like I have a choice
of where I want to place myself in the community
here," she said.
"I've been very active in the black community
here, just because if I went and sat on a bus next to
a random white person, that random white person's


not going to look at me and say
she's mixed," Williams said.
"If that random person turns
out to be a racist, he's going to say
she's a nigger. I guess in that way
I'm part of the struggle," she said.
Crawford also said her appear
ance makes her mixed background
obvious to people she meets, but
that she is still identified by her
Asian heritage.

how you look whether
or not you fit in the
Asian community.'

"You have to identify yourself
by your Asian side. If I said both,
they'd just listen to the [Asian eth
nicity]. Maybe it's because they. ..
can see it," she said. "In terms of
people looking at me and saying
you're this or that, people
wouldn't call me American or
Korean. People pretty much know
I'm quite a mix."
Appearance may also affect a
mixed student's reception in hip or
her ethnic community. Students
who don't look like other members
of the group may attract stares,
jokes or other unwanted attention.
"I think it depends on how you
look whether or not you fit in the
Asian community," said Ana Sten
zel, a junior who is half Japanese
and half Caucasian. "I always pass
for Asian. People are always assum
ing I'm full-blooded Asian. Whereas
I hear from some other people that
they've gotten comments."
Assoc. Dean of Memorial
Church Diana Akiyama said peer
pressure may stem from physical
differences between members of
ethnic communities. "Sometimes

the pressure within the group has
to do with resentment because peo
ple who are mixed do look different
and people don't know what that
physical differentness means."
£Habla espanol?
For some ethnicities, language
also serves as means of inclusion or
exclusion in Stanford's ethnic com
munities. Speaking Spanish, Chi
nese or even Lakota (a Native
American language) may be the key
to opening the door to acceptance.
Chavez didn't grow up speaking
Spanish. But she said that speak
ing the language is very important
for acceptance in Stanford's Chi
cano/Latino community.
"I've had people several times
(throughout my life) say 'You can't
speak Spanish. You're not a real
member of the community,' and
that is even more complicated by
the fact that I am half white," she
said.
However, Eva Silva, the co
chair of MEChA, a Chicano/Latino
student group, said that the bias
against non-Spanish speaking
members may stem from their fear
of not being accepted.
"I think a lot of people who don't
speak Spanish don't feel they will be
accepted. But I think that's just a
misconception," Silva said. "Every
body has had a different experience
growing up and not every one has
grown up speaking Spanish."
Some part-Asian students feel
that the same bias exists in their
own community. Peter Liang, a
junior who is half Chinese and half
Caucasian, said that speaking Chi
nese helps him integrate as part of
the Chinese community.
"I think speaking the language
helps me a lot when I want to relate
with the Chinese-American groups
or the Asian-American groups. I can
say I'm majoring in Chinese and
that will open up doors," he said.
' Growing up ethnic
According to mixed students

and campus ethnic group leaders,
an individual's cultural back
ground is another factor that deter
mines how well mixed students will
fit into their ethnic communities.
Some students may want to
learn about a part of their heritage
they never were exposed to before
coming to Stanford, but often do
not feel comfortable in campus
ethnic communities.
Chavez grew up in Los Angeles
with a family she said encouraged
her to be proud of both her her
itages. "I have a very different
experience from someone whose
parents were born in Mexico and
they are first generation," she said.
"I don't consider myself an out
sider, but I know there are certain
individuals that don't see me as
part of the community," said
Chavez.

1 think that mixed
students can
encourage cultural
understanding through
their own experiences.'
—Roberta Chavez

Eleanor Lo, the vice-chair of the
Asian American Student Associa
tion, said she feels that students'
familiarity with their "chosen"
cultures may affect their ability to
fit into an ethnic group. She added
that she sees "a little barrier" stu
dents have to overcome to become
part of the Asian community.
"One thing that really ties peo
ple together in the Asian commu
nity is they are Asian. If a person
hasn't had much exposure to his
Asian heritage, I think the barrier
becomes a little bigger," she said.
Some students feel that the
communities are not interested in
having members of mixed heritage

— especially if the mixed student
doesn't look like other community
members.
"Because I'm mixed and also
because I don't look one or the
other, the Asian-Americans do not
see me as being Asian-American.
So they didn't really come after me
or anything. The same thing hap
pens with the Mexican-Americans.
They don't see me as really Mexi
can," said Mar.
"Even if I was half, I still
wouldn't know, unless they made
an effort to let you know that they
want people who are half, that
they want you to come learn about
your culture anyway," he said.
Embraced by the community
But Chavez said she is identi
fied more often with her Mexican-
American heritage at Stanford
than she is at home in Los Angeles.
"In the high school I went to,
whites were basically the minority.
It was extremely diverse and so
there was a tendency to not focus
on ethnicities," she said.
"I wasn't Mexican. I wasn't half
Mexican. I was Roberta and people
treated me based on who I was,"
Chavez said. "So when I'm here, I
become aware when I get invited to
minority functions... or when I'm
in a section and I'm the only per
son of color. I am very aware of my
ethnicity."
Some mixed students said they
feel it has been much easier to get
involved in their culture at Stan
ford compared to the communities
in which they were raised.
Jacoby said that he calls himself
Mexican-American at Stanford but
cannot at home in Texas.
"It's a fairly open place here. In
San Antonio, if I went back to my
grandparents' ranch and said I
consider myself Mexican. . . they'd
ridicule me," he said.
Sophomore Jim Ruel, who is half
Chippewa and half Caucasian, said
he has become far more involved
with the Native American commu

nity since coming to Stanford.
He said he was raised in an all
white neighborhood and had little
contact with Native Americans.
"Externally my environment had
been more focused on my Euro
pean side," he said.
"I knew I was part Native
American and that side was just
kind of out there. I didn't really
know how it fit in the history

I went back to my

and said I consider
myself Mexican...

books or what I was reading. It
never fit in except as a little blurb
in front of the American history
class," Ruel said. "And when I
came here, the community just
embraced me."
Academics for identity
Ruel, like many other mixed stu
dents, has used his classes as a
resource to learn about his heritage.
He took the "American Indian Ways
of Knowing" class from the Anthro
pology department and wrote a
research paper on his own tribe.
"I was going back and looking
up some old records and stuff and I
found some of my own relatives'
names in there," he said.
But Asst. Dean of Students Jim
Larimore, who is half Comanche
and half Japanese-American, said
that most classes are not geared
toward helping Native Americans
learn about their culture.
"The courses up until this point

in time have been primarily geared
toward non-native students," he
said. "There has been less focus on
tribal history or tradition and
more on general surveys of the
tribes."
Jacoby, an anthropology mjyor,
also utilized his classes to learn
more about his heritage and to
begin learning Spanish.
The classes have helped him
define his Mexican identity. "In
my Mexican (heritage), I consider
myself part Native American too. I
think a lot has been lost with that
connection of the mestizo (mixed
Spanish and Native American) cul
ture," he said.
Mixed students who have roots
in two communities often look at
their heritage as a chance to pro
mote cultural understanding.
"There is a chance for students
who are mixed to be a bridge
between communities," Chavez
said. "In that sense, I think that
mixed students can encourage cul
tural understanding through their
own experiences."
Williams said her mixed her
itage has helped her recognize and
fight stereotypes. "Ignorance is
disturbing to me because I know
that all black people don't play bas
ketball and all white people don't
wash their hair everyday," she
said. "It helps me to see the gener
alities people make out of igno
rance.
"It just bothers me when people
say 'oh my gosh, racism is so bad
here' and then go on to make some
generality about white people,"
Williams said.
Being mixed puts many stu
dents in a position where they have
to look at both sides of an issues
and make their own judgments.
Ruel said he often feels torn by
issues and feels the need to look
carefully at the information pro
vided. "Sometimes groups try to
make some of the issues black and
white," he siad, "but when you're
mixed everything is gray."
