Using 90 percent less water
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - State Water
Project officials expect to deliver only one-tenth of
normal supplies to farms and cities in 1993 as Cal
ifornia's drought stretches into a seventh year.
Farmers said the shortfall would mean leaving
acres unplanted, while city officials said they would
have to continue strict conservation efforts.
Project officials said yesterday they expect to
deliver only 385,000 acre-feet of water next year.
An acre-foot, enough water to cover an acre of land
to a depth of one foot, can supply a family of five for
about a year.
The delivery could increase if heavy rains come or
decrease if more water is needed to protect fish and
wildlife, officials said. Last year, delivery projections
began at 20 percent of normal but rose to 45 percent.
If the drought continues through a seventh
year, it would be the state's longest dry spell in at
least four centuries, according to state hydrologists
who have studied tree-ring records dating to 1560.
World remembers AIDS victims
ATLANTA (AP) â€” To defeat AIDS, the United
States must enlist people and businesses but reject
bureaucratic solutions such as President-elect Bill
Clinton's plan for an AIDS czar, said the secretary
of Health and Human Services yesterday.
Dr. Louis Sullivan marked World AIDS Day by
launching a new program to help companies keep
employees infected with HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS, working as long as possible.
Elsewhere, vandals painted an AIDS message on

the state Capitol in Denver, museums removed
paintings to remember stricken artists and flags flew
at half-staff along Fifth Avenue in New York City.
Thirty-five cable TV companies planned to go
off the air for a minute last night to emphasize the
loss caused by AIDS deaths in the industry.
Sullivan said such efforts increase AIDS aware
ness in ways a national AIDS official couldn't.
"The AIDS czar in this country is the secretary
of Health and Human Services," Sullivan said.
"The one way to inhibit the innovation and flexibil
ity needed to fight AIDS is a larger bureaucracy."
He called on Congress and Clinton to adopt laws
prohibiting companies from revoking AIDS
patients' insurance, which the U.S. Supreme Court
has said is legal.
Clinton urged the world to work together in fight
ing AIDS. "For too long, America and the world
have faced this epidemic divided and frightened," he
said. "Today we must all pledge to work together on
the research and prevention programs that will
make the AIDS epidemic a part of our past."
Sullivan and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention launched a program to help corpo
rate America establish workplace AIDS policies,
train supervisors to deal with infected employees,
educate employees and their families and encour
age community service.
About 1 million Americans are infected with
HIV. The mtyority are ages 25-44, the group that
makes up most of the nation's workforce. There are
242,146 AIDS patients in the nation.
About 50 people gathered at the United Nations
in New York to protest the World Health Organiza
tion's theme for the day, "community commitment."
