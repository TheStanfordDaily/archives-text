# Economy, employment look up
## Economists express cautious hope, fear another downturn 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - New
reports yesterday showed the gov
ernment's chief economic fore
casting gauge, construction
spending and manufacturing all
up strongly. But economists,
fooled by previous signs of recov
ery, aren't ready to celebrate yet.
The Commerce Department's
Index of Leading Economic Indi
cators rose 0.4 percent in Octo
ber, the biggest gain in five
months. The department also said
construction spending in October
advanced robustly for the second
consecutive month, reaching the
highest level in two years. And a
widely followed private report
showed American manufacturing
surging in November.
"You can feel the corners being
turned all over the place. Every
thing seems to be coming togeth
er," said economist David Seiders
of the National Association of
Home Builders.
But economist Laurence H.
Meyer, a St. Louis-based consul
tant, said, "We want to be a little
bit cautious. We've had periods
where the data has been as good
as October's before. . . and it did
not mature into a recovery."
Since the economy lapsed into
recession in July 1990, analysts

have been burned twice by prema
turely predicting a return to bet
ter times, once in mid-1991 and
again early this year. But each
time a dip or a stall in activity pre
vented the economy from attain
ing a self-sustaining recovery.
Economist Sung Won Sohn of
Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis
said this upturn looks better than
other short-lived periods of
improvement because it is finally
evident in employment.
Of the index's 11 forward-look
ing indicators, the most positive
was a 13.7 percent drop in aver
age weekly unemployment benefit
claims, the steepest since Decem
ber 1982.
"This came in spite of the fact
that big corporations are
announcing a lot more layoffs,"
Sohn said. "I think we are getting
the improvement in small busi
nesses. Three-quarters of our jobs
come from small businesses."
Meanwhile, George Stephan
opoulos, a spokesman for Presi
dent-elect Clinton, said no deci
sion has been made about
whether the improving economic
outlook would cause Clinton to
scale back a planned short-term
economic stimulus package.
"We're encouraged by the news

we've seen over the last several
weeks and we hope it continues,"
Stephanopoulos said. "But. . . we
just can't tell yet whether or not
we're going to have a real, long,
sustained recovery with job
growth and income growth."
Economists said the improving
tone of reports means there is lit
tle immediate prospect that the
Federal Reserve will cut short
term interest rates unless the
economy unexpectedly sours.
Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan underscored that
view by saying in a letter released
yesterday that monetary policy
makers "will have to give serious
consideration" to lowering mone
tary supply targets.
Greenspan described the
change, if it were to occur, as
"largely of a technical nature."
But Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-
Texas and the chairman of the
House Banking Committee,
protested, saying Greenspan
"apparently intends to keep a
tight rein on the money supply."
"In a nutshell, basically
[Greenspanl is saying, 'We've
been doing the right thing and
will continue with the long-term
trend of lowering inflation,' "
Sohn said.
