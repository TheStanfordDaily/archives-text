Opening dorms late
hampers all but the
most local students

LAY ANY PLANS OF begin
ning winter quarter on the
right foot to rest, because
life at Stanford just got a little
harder for undergraduates living
in any residence but Cro Mem,
Theta Chi, Sigma Chi, Mirrielees
or Hammarskjold — Stanford
Housing and Food Services won't
be opening campus residences
until the official starting date of
winter quarter, Monday, Jan. 4.
Traditionally, the first day of
any quarter is a hectic time. The
need to purchase books, check last
quarter's grades and pick up loan
checks insures that a student's
return to the Farm is packed full
of anxiety, long lines and empty
bank accounts.
About the only thing most
undergraduates haven't had to
worry about is settling back into a
dorm environment in the midst of
all this confusion. The "Sunday
just-before-the-madness" was
generally reserved for the chore of
moving back into the dorms. It
was especially useful for Stan
ford's non-Californians who
would have to journey from
points all across the country —
and in some instances across the
world — in order to get here in
time to take care of business.
But budget cuts have managed
to stamp this practice right out
of existence, replacing it with a
solution completely insensitive
to students living every place but
the Golden State. While most
students won't have too much
problem rescheduling flights
into any of the metropolitan air
ports within striking distance
from Stanford, this won't make
completing the many chores
that face students at the begin
ning of each quarter any easier.
In fact, it will only make them

more difficult.
According to Housing and Food
Services, opening the dorms
before the start of the quarter
requires the department to pay its
office, facility, maintenance and
custodial staff overtime wages.
And while Housing and Food
Services should be applauded for
its attempt to save the University
money, they should not forget
who they are supposed to be serv
ing. Simply put, subjecting the
majority of the undergraduate
student body to this inconve
nience in the name of saving
money seems insulting.
How can the department claim
it is acting for the good of the stu
dents that it supposedly serves by
canceling a service held in such
high regard?
After all, at the start of every
quarter, every student living in
University-supplied housing pays
not only a tuition but also a fee
for "house rent," a charge that
assumedly encompasses not only
a living space, but the up-keep
and convenient access to that
space.
One way for the University to
insure that it can continue to pro
vide convenient housing, if they
are really so strapped for funds,
would be to charge a slightly high
er fee for housing. A sensible,
small increase in rent for the sake
of keeping the dorms open before
the first day of the quarter would
be justified.
Another option might be to
charge students an additional fee
on an individual basis for return
ing to campus early, as several
residences do at the very begin
ning of the school year. Undoubt
edly such a fee should be less than
a one-night stay in a hotel — not
to mention more comfortable.
With the stress of cross-coun
try travel coupled with the chaot
ic environment of the first day of
the quarter, many students are
very thankful for the relief that
the Sunday before school starts
has brought in the past. Little
things mean a lot.
