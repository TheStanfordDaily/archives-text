## The 						danger of revising history 
### 
I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING to identify
a trend that has become increasingly
prevalent on the Stanford campus. It
is not one specific issue but a new way to
look at many different issues which
seems to be the residue of the politically
correct movement. I call it cultural revi
sionism.
As this is a term which is definitely
vague, I should try to define it. To me, it
is the name for a new way to look at
things in the '90s, a time when we have
re-evaluated our heroes and history and
learned that both had faults. Historical
revisionism has been a recognized school
in scholarly circles, characterized by the
tendency to deflate long-held conceptions
(or misconceptions) about people and
events.
But it is no longer simply the exclusive
domain of scholars. It has become an
accepted tool of specific groups to further
an agenda at the expense of the revi
sionee. It has become an element of
1990's culture (not to be confused with
the re-hashed 1960's culture of two
weeks ago) to shatter idols and attempt
to right every historical wrong. Some
times it is done thoughtfully and we
emerge with a more complete, accurate
picture. But many times in the eagerness
to balance the scale, the truth again
becomes distorted.
The Columbus Day debate is a timely
example of cultural revisionism. Many

groups, especially Native Americans, are
offended by the celebration of Columbus
Day because to them he is the symbol of
the destruction which the arrival of the
Europeans brought to America. Every
school child learned of the the brave
explorer whose innovations changed the
course of history with the discovery of
the New World. He was a hero.
But in the last few decades, as many
new areas of historical research have
become mainstream, the effect that the
white man's arrival had on the Native
American population has become better
known. Any truly informed student
would probably agree that the America's
treatment of Native Americans is one of
the darkest parts of our history. But in
the rush to condemn the tragedies of the
past, the pendulum sometimes swings
too far the other way and history is
rewritten again, overcompensating for
previous omissions.
Columbus is a symbol, and the move
ment to change Columbus Day to Indige
nous People's Day is an attempt to topple
the image and replace it with another.
But is it necessary to replace one with the
other? Doesn't our culture accept that
two parts of an event or a person can be
recognized? Can't two exist at once? Cul
tural revisionists seem to insist that
Columbus be branded a criminal before
the Native Americans can obtain their
rightful recognition.

I refuse to believe that to recognize a
person's faults necessitates that their
accomplishments be nullified. The story
of Christopher Columbus is historically
significant for our country; that is unde
niable. But to make such a statement is
not to say that he was a saint or that the
negative aspects of his arrival in the New
World should be ignored. America's dis
covery and its Native American popula
tion are both worthy of celebration.
I use Columbus Day as an example of
a worrisome trend. Others have advocat
ed a similar revision of Thanksgiving.
Many have tried to purge the English lan
guage of any inclusive terms which have
a male root, such as mankind, freshman,
woman, etc.
As traditionally underrepresented or
misrepresented groups find their voice, I
urge restraint. Point out the negatives
that exist but don't remove the histori
cally significant, positive parts of a tale in
the effort to recognize the untold parts of
the story. Both have a place in our histo
ry-
