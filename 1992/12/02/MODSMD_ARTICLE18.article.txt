Facts prove Americans weren't backward before 1492

EYAL MOSES, IN HIS letter to the
editor of Nov. 20, writes that the
"Anti-Columbus Day movement is
based on faulty logic." His letter is based
on faulty facts.
Moses writes that "America 500 years
ago was thinly populated by hunter
gatherer tribes." What simple hunter
gatherers built Old Oraibi, the oldest vil
lage in America, that is over 1,000 years
old and still in use today?
What hunter-gatherers built the vast
empires of the Incas and Aztecs who had
complex systems of government including
taxes, a national road system, agricultur
al scientists, urban and civil engineers
and a postal system that could send mes

sages to all ends of the empire at speeds
of 250 miles a day? The evidence is clear
that Native American culture extended
far beyond simple hunter-gatherers.
Moses also writes that today Native
Americans are "living much longer and
more comfortable lives" and that "They
are enjoying political freedom, and have
the opportunity to make choices and live
their lives by their own judgement and
values." This flies in the face of the
facts. Native Americans today die sooner
than any other ethnic groups, have the
highest infant mortality rate and live in
the most abject poverty.
What individual choices did Native
Americans have when children were

forcibly and permanently separated from
their parents? What choices did Native
Americans have when from the late 1880s
through the 1950s they were forced from
their homes into military-style boarding
schools where they were beaten for speak
ing their native language, were forced to
cut heir hair and were told that their cul
ture was to be despised?
Besides his faulty facts, Moses does
not see how subjective his opinions are.
He implies that there is something
wrong with hunter-gatherer people.
There is not. He implies that there is
something wrong with people who work
through life together, instead of forging
individual paths. There is not.

He implies that there is something
wrong with Native Americans who
mourn the death of their ancestors and
their culture. There is not. *
It is time to end the ignorance so
blindingly displayed by Moses. Colum
bus initiated 500 years of suffering and
500 years of ignorance. Moses and the
majority of the editorial board who
wrote the "Keep Columbus Day" editori
al are victims of this ignorance. Cele
brating Columbus Day is like celebrating
Hilter Day.
