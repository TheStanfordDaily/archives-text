# Participants in the violence of Big Game should be ashamed
## 
### 
I am responding to The Daily editori
al of Nov. 23 regarding the near riot at
this year's Big Game.
The Stanford community would be
well-advised to heed the remarks made
in The Daily's editorial of Nov. 23 con
cerning Big Game. It appears that the
"trash talk" and dirty play was a carry
over from last year's game at Stanford
Stadium where many of the UC-Berke
ley players (including the team's quar
terback) simply lost their composure.
This year, the students and fans on both
sides lost it as well.
Those who remember what Denny
Green did for Stanford in terms of
"attitude" can rest assured that coach
Gilbertson will be making similar
changes in the UC-Berkeley football
program. As for the spectators, it is the
responsibility of the students, faculty
and administration of each university
to police themselves.

If spectators and participants at Big
Game insist on behaving like hooli
gans, next year's contest should be
cancelled and the Rose Bowl (if either
team happens to be so fortunate) for
gotten. People who conduct themselves
in the manner reported by observers at
this year's game do not deserve the
privilege of having their school repre
sent the Pacific 10 Conference at
Pasadena.
