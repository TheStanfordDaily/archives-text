# Attending to grad issues
## Casper creates assoc. dean for grads; tells Senate of UCMI re-examination 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
In his first address to the ASSU
Senate, University President Ger
hard Casper announced that his
office will appoint a dean to deal
with graduate students' mounting
problems and will reconsider
1989's University Committee on
Minority Issues report.
Casper answered pre-submit
ted questions from the senate for
over an hour, touching on issues
from the indirect cost rate to stu
dent storage.
After responding to two queries
about the housing and the cost of
living for graduate students, Casper
said he thought graduate issues had
fallen victim to budget cuts.
"I think there's no question
that it wasn't thought through,"
he said. "The budget-cutting exer
cise at Stanford went too far in the

decentralization of graduate stu
dent policies."
Casper said this will be re
versed through the efforts of the
new associate dean of graduate
policies, who will be appointed by
the dean of research in January.
However, Casper said he has
been unable to fully understand
all of the problems.
"I myself . . . will try to get a
better feel for the range of worries
you have," he said. "I do not yet
understand what the exact prob
lems are in various parts of the
University with respect to gradu
ate students."
Casper also discussed multicul
turalism, its role in a university
and 1989's report of the UCMI. He
said he has scheduled a cabinet
meeting to discuss the report in
the near future.
