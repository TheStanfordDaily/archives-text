# Attending to grad issues
## Casper creates assoc. dean for grads; tells Senate of UCMI re-examination 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
In his first address to the ASSU
Senate, University President Ger
hard Casper announced that his
office will appoint a dean to deal
with graduate students' mounting
problems and will reconsider
1989's University Committee on
Minority Issues report.
Casper answered pre-submit
ted questions from the senate for
over an hour, touching on issues
from the indirect cost rate to stu
dent storage.
After responding to two queries
about the housing and the cost of
living for graduate students, Casper
said he thought graduate issues had
fallen victim to budget cuts.
"I think there's no question
that it wasn't thought through,"
he said. "The budget-cutting exer
cise at Stanford went too far in the

decentralization of graduate stu
dent policies."
Casper said this will be re
versed through the efforts of the
new associate dean of graduate
policies, who will be appointed by
the dean of research in January.
However, Casper said he has
been unable to fully understand
all of the problems.
"I myself . . . will try to get a
better feel for the range of worries
you have," he said. "I do not yet
understand what the exact prob
lems are in various parts of the
University with respect to gradu
ate students."
Casper also discussed multicul
turalism, its role in a university
and 1989's report of the UCMI. He
said he has scheduled a cabinet
meeting to discuss the report in
the near future.
The report consists of more
than 200 pages documenting the
situation of people of color on cam
pus and includes wide-ranging rec
ommendations of how it can be
improved.
"We are now going to take a
fresh look at the report and the
various recommendations," he
said, but added, "I cannot say we

will implement all of the recom
mendations."
He invited students to discuss
the essence of multiculturalism in
order to better define it.
"I think we should have free,...
very basic discussions on what
multiculturalism is," he said. "I
hope very much that Stanford Uni
versity ... would help the United
States as a whole and other univer
sities to develop a clearer concept of
multiculturalism."
Undergraduate senator Jaasi
Munanka, who asked Casper the

question about multiculturalism
and the UCMI report, said he was
very satisfied with the president's
response.
"I really liked what he said
because he showed his open-mind
edness and it showed his commit
ment to multiculturalism and
diversity," he said. "The big thing
is his statement that the Universi
ty is going to reconsider the UCMI
report and hopefully implement
some of the recommendations."
In response to a question about
the Grey Interpretation of the Fun

damental Standard, Casper flooded
the senator with legal history and
later affirmed his support of the
measure.
"I mighlt. have written the Grey
Interpretat ion differently but it is a
very small and subtle point," he
said. "I don't see the point to take
the initiativo to overturn (the mea
sure], For the time, I am satisfied
that there is a lot of protection of
free speech at Stanford."
Several senators said they were
satisfied with Casper's responses
and impress*ekl by his research.
