# Accurate grade record need not include what student 'failed' to learn
## 
### 
Reinstating F grades, the subject of
your Nov. 19 editorial, would under
mine some of the most cherished pur
poses of our educational system. A
grading system should offer incentives
for excellence, not punishments for fail
ure.
An F on a transcript is as close as we
can come in academia to eternal damna

tion. The transcript is a record which
follows a student everywhere and lasts
forever. Why need it contain a list of
what the student has failed to learn?
We want students to explore new
areas of knowledge, to test their abilities
in new domains and to develop a love of
learning. Learning under the threat of
punishment, particularly eternal pun
ishment, is no way to promote joy in
learning.
There are many legitimate reasons
why a student may fail to master a new
set of skills within a predetermined time
limit. The student who tries but fails
should not be punished for trying. The
student who does not even try has not
learned the material either. Neither stu
dent has mastered the material, but the
F grade punishes only the student who
tried.
The absence of credit — a NC grade
— is a perfectly honest and credible way
of indicating the lack of mastery. There
are thousands of academic courses that
could not be mastered. No one has time
to learn them all. A transcript should be
a record of what one has mastered, even
imperfectly. The absence of a course on
the transcript clearly indicates that no

mastery claim is being made.
Making a permanent public record of
failed attempts at mastery discourages
exploration, instills fear of learning and
defeats the very purposes for which
Stanford was founded.
