# Correct punishment for failure includes wearing F's, branding
## 
### 
Reinstating the F on student tran
scripts certainly doesn't go far enough in
separating the chaff from the seed. Why
not force the "cheesy" students to wear
a scarlet F on their graduation gowns, or
better yet, brand their foreheads with
the word "flunkee." After all, grades are
beyond subjectivity or circumstance.
Shouldn't Stanford be more concerned
with exposing the failures of the tens of
students who abuse the system rather
than promoting the success of the rest?
