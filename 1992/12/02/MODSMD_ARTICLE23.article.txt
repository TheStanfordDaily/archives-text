## Stanford squeaks by Texas Tech, 75-67 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team proved last night that
playing with two All-Americans
surpasses playing with just one.
With outstanding performances
from 1992 All-American Val Whit
ing and 1993 preseason All-Ameri
can Molly Goodenbour, the top
ranked Cardinal triumphed over
Sheryl Swoopes and her No. 14
Texas Tech squad, 75-67.
Stanford dominated the first
half of play, relying on flawless
long-range shooting by Gooden
bour and a solid defensive effort.
Goodenbour bombed four
three-pointers and accumulated
16 first half points. The senior
point guard's offensive production
gave her team a comfortable lead,
causing headaches for Texas Tech
coach Marsha Sharp.
"I've had nightmares all spring
about Molly Goodenbour (after our
loss to Stanford in last year's play
offs)," Sharp said. "We just wish
she would miss some of her shots."
The Cardinal squad caused the
Red Raiders to attempt many off
balance shots, holding them to a
mere 17 points during the game's
first 20 minutes. Particularly
impressive was the defensive play
of sophomore Rachel Hemmer,
who shut down the Texas Tech
All-American in the half Swoopes
committed five turnovers, and had
the ball stolen several times.
Stanford's tenacious full-court
press near the end of the half flus
tered its opponent's offense even
more and enabled the Cardinal to
build a 22-point halftime lead.
However, the Red Raiders
refused to concede defeat, opening
the second half with a revitalized
offense. Stanford's margin dwin
dled to seven as its opponent's
shooting heated up.
"Texas Tech had momentum
the whole second half, and we
couldn't get things going," Whit
ing said.

Indeed, while Swoopes was
busy racking up 28 second-half
points on 11-for-11 shooting, the
Cardinal found itself moving the
ball sluggishly.
According to Stanford coach
Tara VanDerveer, "We were
standing around on offense while
Texas Tech was doing a good job
moving on their offense."
Despite the valiant effort by
Texas Tech, Whiting's inspired
second-half play single-handedly
crushed the Red Raiders' come
back attempt. The 6-foot-3 senior
center exploded for 24 points of

her own, controlling the post area
even when she was double and
triple-teamed.
Although the Cardinal success
fully defended their No. 1-rank
ing, VanDerveer feels her team
needs to step up its play in future
games in order to have a success
ful season.
"Even with the experience our
team has, they still need to
improve on some things," she
explained. "I was not happy with
the way we played offensively, and
our defense let Texas Tech roll all
over us in the second half."
