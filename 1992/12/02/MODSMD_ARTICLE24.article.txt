# Cardinal shaken by Red Raiders' wake-up call
## 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
Unlike the Belgian Nationals, the top college
teams in America don't pack it in after one half
Ail-American Sheryl Swoopes and the Texas
Tech Red Raiders set off the first in what could be
a long series of temblors along the fault-line that
threatens Stanford's road to repeat as national
champions.
Coach Tara VanDerveer wasn't surprised.
"We're going to bring out the best in any team we
play," she said.
Last night's quake rattled Maples Pavilion for
about 20 minutes, the length of the second half, as
five different Cardinal players took their turn
guarding Swoopes, but none could halt the dam
age.
Referring to Tech's 50-point second-half bar
rage in which Swoopes made every shot she
attempted, VanDerveer said bluntly, "They rolled
over us.
"I realize how far behind we are. It definitely
was a first game," she added.
It was, nevertheless, a win, because the Cardi
nal did just enough right to survive. But as the
team heads to Hawaii this weekend for the
Wahine Classic, where in order to win they will
likely have to play either No. 2 Tennessee or No. 8
Stephen F. Austin, there's plenty to work on.
Like, for instance, getting the ball to Ail-Amer
ican center Val Whiting.
Foul trouble severely limited the playing time

of Tech's two true centers, yet Whiting stayed
conspicuously absent from the Cardinal offense in
the first half, scoring only three points.
That changed after halftime, as Whiting over
powered Swoopes and the baseline of Tech's 2-3
zone, when the Cardinal center got the ball. But
VanDerveer didn't hide her displeasure with the
time it took to get the senior involved. "We finally
figured out who to pass the ball to late in the
game," she quipped. "I don't know what took us so
long."
In fact, much of the Cardinal offense struggled
last night. The team combined for only 41 percent
shooting from the floor, a far cry from the 48 per
cent average posted by last year's squad. As a
result, plays setting up perimeter jumpers on
swing passes found only limited success.
Of course, bad shooting nights do happen, and
the great teams come up with something to make
up for the inevitable dry spell. But Stanford found
few alternatives against the Raiders.
Even in the first half, when they were building
a 22-point lead, the Cardinal players frequently
struggled to keep their poise whenever they got
the ball inside the teeth of Tech's zone. Van-
Derveer didn't mince her words: "People with the
ball were rushed; people without the ball were
standing still."
She summed up the game by saying, "It was a
heavyweight bout. It wasn't pretty." As the Cardi
nal faces the rest of its challengers this season, the
knockout punch that was missing tonight will be
needed.
