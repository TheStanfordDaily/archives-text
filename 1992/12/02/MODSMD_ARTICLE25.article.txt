# Schott's racist remarks should land her in dog house
## 
### 
Marge schott must go.
Schott, the owner of the National
League's Cincinnati Reds, has
made comments both recently and in the
past in reference to minorities that, if
being judged by an umpire, would most
certainly be ruled foul.
In this "year of change," the trend
seems to be out with the old and in with
the new. Schott, both physically and
mentally, is certainly old, so it is time for
Major League Baseball to ring in the
new. . .owner of the Reds, that is.
Last week, a wrongful-termination
court suit filed by a former Reds employ
ee was dismissed, but comments made in
the depositions from the case cannot be.
They revealed something elseâ€”Schott's
bigotry.
The witnesses on the stand stated that
Schott referred to former player Dave
Parker as "that dumb nigger," and gen
eralized about "sneaky goddam Jews."
Those comments in and of themselves
would be mere ugly unsubstantiated
anecdotes if not for Schott's own testimo
ny.
In a deposition taken last December,
Schott admitted using the word "nigger."
When asked if she had referred to Martin

Luther King, Jr. Day as "Nigger Day,"
she replied, "It's possible."
From her answer to that question, it is
not hard to conclude that saying the word
"possible" in public was only a squeamish
substitute for saying the word "yes" in
private.
If Schott had not said it, her answer
would have been a definitive "no." End of
story.
But "it's possible" is a weak way of
saying "I know I did it, but maybe if I try
to skirt the issue people will forget about
it and leave me alone."
Sorry Marge, but the skirt fits and
you're wearing it.
The stuff that has been coming out of
your mouth is worse than the presents
that your dog Schottzie leaves behind on

the turf at Riverfront Stadium. But
cleaning up your mess is not as easy as a
quick fling of the pooper-scooper.
Schott went on to say in her deposition
that she kept a swastika armband in her
home and couldn't understand why a for
mer employee, who is Jewish, was offend
ed by the symbol.
When asked whether she had told that
employee that "Hitler might have had
the right idea," she responded "I don't
really know."
Schott, who is German, thus went
from speaking in the realm of possibility
with her words to displaying her lack of
historical knowledge. She played dumb,
in other words. "Well," she figured, "if I
can teach my St. Bernard to do it, I might
as well join in. .
What's worse, rather than admit her
mistakes, she keeps stepping up to the
plate, only to slap one that much further
out-of-play. At least Schottzie knows
when to bark and when not to.
Sharon Jones, a former Oakland A's
employee, said that she heard Schott say
on a conference call that she'd rather
have a "trained monkey" work for her
than "another nigger."
A 1 Campanis was fired as the execu

tive vice president of the Los Angeles
Dodgers in April of 1987 after saying on
ABC's "Nightline" that blacks lacked
the "necessities" to be major league
managers. Schott's comments are far
more offensive, and need to be dealt
with swiftly and accordingly by baseball
officials.
The problem with this comparison is
that in the Campanis situation, Campa
nis was an employee, answering to some
one else. Schott, on the other hand, is the
employer, and answers to no one.
In an interview Sunday with The New
York Times, Schott acknowledged using
racist terms, but said she meant them
"only kiddingly." To her, they were "joke
terms."
But what she went on to say was no
laughing matter. In the same interview,
she said that she used the term "Jap"
when speaking to National League presi
dent Bill White earlier in the week, only
to be reprimanded by White. She said, "I
didn't mean to insult the Japanese. I
have the greatest respect for the way
they've come back in the world."
She also referred to the suffering of
her relatives during World War II in Ger
many, stating, "Hitler was good in the

beginning, but he went too far."
In her final proverbial trip to the
bullpen, she defended her dreadful lack of
minorities in front-office positions by
noting that she employs a lot of blacks, as
shown by the number of black players the
Reds have on the field.
It is clear that Schott is a prejudiced
person. As a figure under public scrutiny,
she cannot remain one of the elite crew of
28 owners in the National Pastime, while
continuing to harbor such views. Base
ball owners questionably forced the resig
nation of commissioner Fay Vincent ear
lier this year "in the best interests of
baseball." The decision here is a lot more
clear-cut.
It takes an old dog a long time to learn
new tricks. Schott, even when instructed
properly, has yet to learn, and at this
stage in her life it is doubtful she will.
The Reds' owner has been thrown
enough bones. In this case, "in the best
interests of baseball," the best solution is
a harsh one: Get rid of the dog. Marge,
yer out.

David Schwartz wants a loan for the hol
idays so that he can buy the Reds. His col
umn appears here weekly.
