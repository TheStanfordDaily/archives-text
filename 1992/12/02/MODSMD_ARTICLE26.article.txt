# Cardinal opens against Loggers
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Positive news abounds as the
Stanford basketball team pre
pares to embark on its regular
season opener against Puget
Sound tonight at Maples Pavil
ion, and coach Mike Montgomery
certainly has to be pleased.
The first bit of good news
about the Cardinal is that Mont
gomery will have more players to
work with against the Loggers
this evening than he did during
either of the two exhibition
games. Forward Andy Poppink's
back pains have subsided, and
guard Bobby Patton's bruised
calf is near complete recovery.
Both players will be suited up on
the floor tonight.
The other bit of good news con
cerns the future. Montgomery
has signed two top high school
prospects during the early
November signing period to let
ters of intent. Both recruits are
guards, and they enable Mont
gomery to fill what will be a sore
ly needed void in the Cardinal
squad, given the upcoming depar
tures of senior backcourt mem
bers Marcus Lollie, Peter Dukes
and Kenny Hicks.
Montgomery was able to get
the perfect combination: a point
guard to replace Lollie and a
shooting guard to take over for

Dukes and Hicks. The playmak
ing chores for next year's team
could very well fall into the hands
of 5-foot-10 signee Brevin Knight
of East Orange, N.J.
Last year, as a junior at Seton
Hall Prep in East Orange, Knight
averaged 15 points, four rebounds
and eight assists per game. Knight
has been named the Most Valuable
Player of the New Jersey state
high school basketball tournament
each of the last two seasons.
"With the graduation of three
senior guards, it was imperative
that we were able to sign a quali
ty point guard," Montgomery
said. "We've done that with
Brevin Knight, who just may be
the quickest player we've ever

recruited. He's a human press
breaker who will make his sur
rounding players better with his
speed and quickness."
Recruit Rich Jackson, a 6-foot -
6, 195-pound guard, will see time
shooting from the off-guard spot
next year. Jackson, who graduat
ed from Timpview High School in
Provo, Utah in 1991, averaged
22.1 points, 8.6 rebounds and 8.4
assists in his senior year, while
leading his team to a 22-1 record
and a second-place finish in the
Utah state tournament.
"He has the ability to play
three positions on the perimeter,"
Montgomery said. "He is a player
who will provide immediate help
to our program."
