# 'Fire, walk with me'—but remember to sweat

is it physically possible
vythat people are able to walk
ontlaming coals without getting
burnt or registering pain?
— Baffled
A:Firewalks are generally
used to convince a naive
observer that the walker is, by
mysticism or "mind over mat
ter," immune to the effects of
extremely high temperatures.
They usually occur at the culmi
nation of weekend-long, $1,000-
per-seat "seminars" on building
self-confidence and contacting
the Natural Powers of the You
Within You.
Prior to this spectacle, the
guru who has offered the seminar
will have spoken vividly and at
length about strategies for tap
ping your inner wells of self
reliance and strategies for using
100 percent of your brain cells.
In direct contradiction to this
latter advice, you, the consumer,
will have bought a set of "inspira
tional" cassettes or eight-tracks

for half the price of the seminar.
The guru will have promised
you that if you can merely actual
ize your full potential self-confi
dence, then like thousands of oth
ers you, too, will be able to:
• win friends and influence
people.
• earn your dream job.
• stop wetting the bed.
• give/get orgasms to/from
your lover/self without thinking
of your mother/father more than
half the time.
• all of the above.
As a final demonstration of the
irrefutable truth of the drivel he
has been spouting, the charlatan
will open up a big ol' can of self
actualized whoop-ass and walk
barefoot across a bed of red-hot
embers. Miraculously, he is
unhurt! At his invitation, you
make another contribution and
try it yourself — and it works! In
a wave of emotion you purchase a
crystal pendant, the guru's hard
bound biography and a collection
of "Hang in there!" kitten
posters.
The success of firewalkers,
however, lies not in their self-

confidence, but rather in a few
elementary properties of water
vaporization.
In order to safely walk over
hot coals, a firewalker must make
certain that some moisture is pre
sent on his feet — either by
meandering across some dewy
grass before strolling the cinders,
or, assuming some threshold
level of sanity, he could depend
upon the natural trepidation
associated with contemplating
such an act to coat his soles with
sweat.
Ironically, then, it is safer to
be nervous before a firewalk than

to have full confidence that you
will escape unscathed. If you're
too blas6, you will fail to sweat,
and profound burns will likely
result.
Water on the feet protects in
two ways. First, the vaporization
of said moisture would absorb a
good deal of the heat from the
coals. Assuming that one walks
briskly enough, this would leave
less heat to be conducted to the
flesh.
The other protective action,
known as "film boiling," also
involves vaporization. We have
all observed this effect in the
mundane environs of a kitchen:
After heating an empty skillet,
you can test whether it is hot
enough for your purposes by
sprinkling a few drops of water
over the hot surface. If the drops
spread out and sizzle off after a
few seconds, the pan isn't ready
yet. If, on the other hand, the
drops skitter madly over the
cooking surface, apparently
unboiling, your pan is sufficiently
hot for such common kitchen
applications as scrambling eggs
or cooking flapjacks.
