# Endorsement of Grey won't be rescinded
## 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last
night soundly rejected a bill
that would have repealed its
approval of the "fighting
words" Grey Interpretation
of the Fundamental Stan
dard.
The Grey Interpretation
prohibits the use of harsh
and insulting language that
aims to stigmatize based on
ethnicity, gender, sexual ori
entation, physical handicap
or religion. It applies when
the language is directed at a
person or a small group of people.
The senate debated the bill for
over an hour in what was some
times a heated discussion over the
right to free speech, finally defeat

ing it by a vote of 15-5.
Had the senate approved the
bill, it would not have repealed
the Grey Interpretation but
would have only recommended
that it be reconsidered. Only the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council, which approved the mea
sure in 1989, can revoke it.
"I'm disappointed. I think free

speech still flourishes here
though," said graduate senator
Rob Corry, one of the bill's six
authors.
He added, "I'm optimistic
about Stanford. I think there's
still an opportunity for a repeal
through the SCLC."
The debate on the bill coinci-
came after University

President Gerhard Casper's
address to the senate, in which he
said he saw no need to overturn
the Grey Interpretation.
"I think President Casper's
comments a t the beginning hurt
the bill. It was bad luck and
unfortunate, but we appreciate
his input either way," said
Corry.
