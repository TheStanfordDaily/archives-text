One would guess that a hotter
surface would boil off a water
droplet more quickly than a cool
er one, but such is not the case.
At or above a critical tempera
ture called the Leidenfrost point,
the bottom surface of a drop
vaporizes before the drop can
spread thin. The gas pressure
from the vaporization results in a
cushion of steam which prevents
the rest of the drop from contact
ing the hot surface. Floating on
this nearly frictionless film of
vapor, a single drop can survive
on a hot skillet for up to a minute.
This so-called "Leidenfrost
effect" also contributes to the
long-term profitability of self
help charlatans. A thin layer of

dew — or better yet, sweat, which
can be constantly replenished by
the pores in response to the heat
of the embers — will form a thin
cushion of vapor between the per
former's feet and the coals.
While the cushion separates
the guru from the hottest sur
faces, the vaporizing water will
actually carry heat out from
under his feet, keeping the tem
perature at the soles down to a
warm but comfortable level.
