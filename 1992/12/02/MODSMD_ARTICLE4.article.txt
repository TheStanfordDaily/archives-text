# Soviet scholars speculate
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
If the former Soviet Union's struggle to develop a
free-market economy is to be successful, a precarious
transition is to be expected, experts agreed yesterday
in the opening of a two-day Stanford conference.
"If we don't find chaos and confusion and unem
ployment in the short-term, then privatization is not
going forward," said Arthur Alexander, president of
the Washington, D.C.-based Japan Economic Institute.
Nearly 200 Russian, American, Chinese and Euro
pean analysts from government agencies and busi
nesses met with scholars to discuss ways of convert
ing Russian defense-related industries to private,
civilian industries.
Former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado was among those
attending the conference, which was hosted by the Cen
ter for International Security and Arms Control.
Hart said he attended because he has been acting
as a consultant for European and American compa
nies attempting to begin operations in the former So
viet Union.
"You learn a great deal and catch up on what's
been going on," Hart said of the conference, adding
that many of the center's members are friends and

former members of his staff.
Much of yesterday's discussion focused on the po
litical and economic context within the former Soviet
Union that will color the decisions made about de
fense conversion.
While many Western experts urged a rapid push
toward privatization, their Russian counterparts ex
plained some of the difficulties they had encountered.
"We always have to figure out what's more prima
ry: the chicken or the egg?" said Alexander Kras
noselski, assistant to Russia's acting prime minister,
Yegor Gaidar. "How can you have privatization if you
don't even have a financial infrastructure?"
He said the public "is not even remotely aware" of
the workings of some of the most basic free-market fi
nancial institutions, such as the stock market. But
the public must become involved if reform is to suc
ceed, Krasnoselski added.
Efforts at economic reform in Russia have also
met resistance from members of the privileged class
of business managers, who fear they will lose their
positions, Alexander said.
But simply attempting to remove them is not the
answer, he said. "Ways have to be found for paying
them off, so to speak, giving them
chances in the new system. These
are very talented people, and we
have many of them in the room
right here."
Clifford Gaddy, a Brookings
Institution economist, cautioned
that evaluating the progress of
reform is extremely difficult
because of the unreliable statis

tics currently available.
He said that according to Rus
sian government statistics, the
number of unemployed now
stands at 372,000 industrial pro
duction is down 17 percent;
exports are down 34 percent; and
imports are down 19 percent.
"I basically don't believe in any
of these statistics," Gaddy said.
Now, the International Monetary
Fund is exerting so much pres
sure to provide statistics that an
ethic of "any figure will do" is tak
ing hold, he said.
