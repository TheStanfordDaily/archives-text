# Frosh they're not
## Transfers bring experience, enthusiasm to Stanford 
### Joanne Martin 
Finding your way around cam
pus, working out a strange new
registration system, looking for a
friendly face in a sea of unknown
people: for most undergraduates
this is a one-time experience —
unless you are a transfer student.
This year, 126 students from 90
colleges in 29 different states, plus
17 students from 11 foreign coun
tries, are going through the disori
entation of being on a new campus
without being labeled "fresh
men."
Gretchen Cole, a sophomore,
wasn't even sure she would be
coming to Stanford until the mid
dle of August. Placed on the wait
ing list at Stanford, Cole was con
vinced she would be attending
Santa Clara University in the fall.
"I had all my classes picked out
and then, in the middle of August,
Stanford called and said there was

room for me."
For Cole, this was a late but
very welcome call.
"All transfer students enhance
university life in some way," said
Joan Lipman, an assistant director
in undergraduate admissions.

students, however.
Olivia Ouyang, a transfer from
the Foreign Affairs College in Bei
jing, China, has been at Stanford
for more than a month and said
she is still trying to overcome cul
ture shock, homesickness and
feelings of isolation.

Although overjoyed to be at
Stanford — taking the first step in
her American academic career —
she said she is having a hard time
adjusting to American culture.
"What is most important [in
friendship) is communication and
cultural background. At the mo
ment there is not much in com
mon [between me and other stu
dents.]"
This cultural gap will close
more the longer she is here,
Ouyang said, but at the moment
"it is hard to be away from home."
Although she is living in the
Asian-American theme house,
Okada, Ouyang said she feels iso
lated from her fellow housemates,
whom, she said, are more accus
tomed to American society.
When she received her accep
tance telegram from Stanford, she
was troubled by the thought of
