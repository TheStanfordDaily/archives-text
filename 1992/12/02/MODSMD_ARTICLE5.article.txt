# Frosh they're not
## Transfers bring experience, enthusiasm to Stanford 
### Joanne Martin 
Finding your way around cam
pus, working out a strange new
registration system, looking for a
friendly face in a sea of unknown
people: for most undergraduates
this is a one-time experience —
unless you are a transfer student.
This year, 126 students from 90
colleges in 29 different states, plus
17 students from 11 foreign coun
tries, are going through the disori
entation of being on a new campus
without being labeled "fresh
men."
Gretchen Cole, a sophomore,
wasn't even sure she would be
coming to Stanford until the mid
dle of August. Placed on the wait
ing list at Stanford, Cole was con
vinced she would be attending
Santa Clara University in the fall.
"I had all my classes picked out
and then, in the middle of August,
Stanford called and said there was

room for me."
For Cole, this was a late but
very welcome call.
"All transfer students enhance
university life in some way," said
Joan Lipman, an assistant director
in undergraduate admissions.
"These students are rarely here for
four years, and therefore they want
to use the university's resources to
the full in their limited time."
"1 always saw Stanford as a
challenging university," Cole said.
"But I didn't realize everything it
had to offer. 1 want to try every
thing," she added with unrelent
ing optimism.
It's not all roses for transfer
students, however.
Olivia Ouyang, a transfer from
the Foreign Affairs College in Bei
jing, China, has been at Stanford
for more than a month and said
she is still trying to overcome cul
ture shock, homesickness and
feelings of isolation.

Although overjoyed to be at
Stanford — taking the first step in
her American academic career —
she said she is having a hard time
adjusting to American culture.
"What is most important [in
friendship) is communication and
cultural background. At the mo
ment there is not much in com
mon [between me and other stu
dents.]"
This cultural gap will close
more the longer she is here,
Ouyang said, but at the moment
"it is hard to be away from home."
Although she is living in the
Asian-American theme house,
Okada, Ouyang said she feels iso
lated from her fellow housemates,
whom, she said, are more accus
tomed to American society.
When she received her accep
tance telegram from Stanford, she
was troubled by the thought of
breaking her previous commit
ment to Brandeis. "I had already
been accepted [therel and I had
given them my word I would
attend their school. But by accept
ing Stanford's offer I would be
breaking that promise," she said.
"This was very difficult for me —
as my promise is part of my
integrity."
While Ouyang's decision to
transfer to Stanford caused her
much anguish, the decision for
other transfer students was rela
tively painless.
Sophomore Heath Hawker felt
no guilt about leaving the Mas
sachusets Institute of Technology
behind. "I wanted a school with
better athletics, without losing
the academics," said Hawker,
who is now playing varsity golf.
Stanford is "very laid back —
which is the opposite of MIT," he
said. "As yet there are no disad
vantages to Stanford. . . . I'm

even happy with my dorm," said
Hawker, who is living in Loro.
Cole, the mother of an 11-year
old son, wanted to continue her
education after a 16-year break.
Getting a degree in communica
tion from Stanford was not her
original goal when she began tak
ing a computer class at Canada
College two years ago.
Only wishing to upgrade her
employment skills, Cole had not
thought about a bachelor's degree
since her high school graduation
which, she said, "was in the hip
pie days when a degree was just
seen as a piece of paper."
According to Lipman, nontra
ditional students such as Cole
make up about 20 percent of
incoming transfer students.
In order to minimize feelings
of isolation, transfer students are
often placed in dorms with other
transfers, Lipman said.
Eva Neuberg, a soph more liv
ing in Cardenal, said she thinks
such clustering is a good idea. "If
I were the only transfer student
[in my dorm] I think I would feel
strange," she said.

Gretchen Cole, a sophomore,
wasn't even sure she would be
coming to Stanford until the mid
dle of August. Placed on the wait
ing list at Stanford, Cole was con
vinced she would be attending
Santa Clara University in the fall.
"I had all my classes picked out
and then, in the middle of August,
Stanford called and said there was

room for me."
For Cole, this was a late but
very welcome call.
"All transfer students enhance
university life in some way," said
Joan Lipman, an assistant director
in undergraduate admissions.
"These students are rarely here for
four years, and therefore they want
to use the university's resources to
the full in their limited time."
"1 always saw Stanford as a
challenging university," Cole said.
"But I didn't realize everything it
had to offer. 1 want to try every
thing," she added with unrelent
ing optimism.
It's not all roses for transfer
students, however.
Olivia Ouyang, a transfer from
the Foreign Affairs College in Bei
jing, China, has been at Stanford
for more than a month and said
she is still trying to overcome cul
ture shock, homesickness and
feelings of isolation.

Although overjoyed to be at
Stanford — taking the first step in
her American academic career —
she said she is having a hard time
adjusting to American culture.
"What is most important [in
friendship) is communication and
cultural background. At the mo
ment there is not much in com
mon [between me and other stu
dents.]"
This cultural gap will close
more the longer she is here,
Ouyang said, but at the moment
"it is hard to be away from home."
Although she is living in the
Asian-American theme house,
Okada, Ouyang said she feels iso
lated from her fellow housemates,
whom, she said, are more accus
tomed to American society.
When she received her accep
tance telegram from Stanford, she
was troubled by the thought of
breaking her previous commit
ment to Brandeis. "I had already
been accepted [therel and I had
given them my word I would
attend their school. But by accept
ing Stanford's offer I would be
breaking that promise," she said.
"This was very difficult for me —
as my promise is part of my
integrity."
While Ouyang's decision to
transfer to Stanford caused her
much anguish, the decision for
other transfer students was rela
tively painless.
Sophomore Heath Hawker felt
no guilt about leaving the Mas
sachusets Institute of Technology
behind. "I wanted a school with
better athletics, without losing
the academics," said Hawker,
who is now playing varsity golf.
Stanford is "very laid back —
which is the opposite of MIT," he
said. "As yet there are no disad
vantages to Stanford. . . . I'm

even happy with my dorm," said
Hawker, who is living in Loro.
Cole, the mother of an 11-year
old son, wanted to continue her
education after a 16-year break.
Getting a degree in communica
tion from Stanford was not her
original goal when she began tak
ing a computer class at Canada
College two years ago.
Only wishing to upgrade her
employment skills, Cole had not
thought about a bachelor's degree
since her high school graduation
which, she said, "was in the hip
pie days when a degree was just
seen as a piece of paper."
According to Lipman, nontra
ditional students such as Cole
make up about 20 percent of
incoming transfer students.
In order to minimize feelings
of isolation, transfer students are
often placed in dorms with other
transfers, Lipman said.
Eva Neuberg, a soph more liv
ing in Cardenal, said she thinks
such clustering is a good idea. "If
I were the only transfer student
[in my dorm] I think I would feel
strange," she said.
