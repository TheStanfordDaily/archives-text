### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Archivists from the Hoover In
stitution who are reviewing 25
million pages of Soviet communist
party documents detailed their
progress and outlined their plans
for further investigation in a panel
discussion last night.
Researchers have already un
earthed previously unknown in
formation about Lee Harvey Os
wald, the 1979 Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan and Kruschev-
Kennedy correspondence during
the Cuban missile crisis of 1962,
according to Hoover Senior Fellow
John Dunlop, a member of the re
view board.
Perhaps the most significant
and unexpected discoveries were
evidence in the archives of the
1939 Soviet-Nazi pact and Joseph
Stalin's orders to kill 15,000 Pol
ish soldiers after the division of
Poland, said History Prof. Ter
ence Emmons.
Last March, the Russian Feder

ation granted Hoover permission
to review with Russian scholars
documents written by Communist
officials from the Bolshevik revo
lution of 1917 to the 1991 coup at
tempt. Hoover deputy director
Charles Palm called the Russian
archives the "largest body of un
tapped knowledge in the world on
the history of the 20th century."
The team of researchers will se
lect approximately 25 million
pages from the archives to micro
film. The five-year project will cost
about $3 million.
While many scholars have ex
pressed skepticism over whether
Hoover will gain access to any im
portant records, Emmons, one of
the six members of the team re
viewing the documents, said it is
"difficult to convey the sense of ex
citement I have."
Hoover's review efforts will
focus primarily on documents
from the Soviet Union's central
institutions of political power,
