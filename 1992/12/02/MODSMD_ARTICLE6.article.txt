# Hoover director Palm recounts scholarly coup
## Archivists report progress to date 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Archivists from the Hoover In
stitution who are reviewing 25
million pages of Soviet communist
party documents detailed their
progress and outlined their plans
for further investigation in a panel
discussion last night.
Researchers have already un
earthed previously unknown in
formation about Lee Harvey Os
wald, the 1979 Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan and Kruschev-
Kennedy correspondence during
the Cuban missile crisis of 1962,
according to Hoover Senior Fellow
John Dunlop, a member of the re
view board.
Perhaps the most significant
and unexpected discoveries were
evidence in the archives of the
1939 Soviet-Nazi pact and Joseph
Stalin's orders to kill 15,000 Pol
ish soldiers after the division of
Poland, said History Prof. Ter
ence Emmons.
Last March, the Russian Feder

ation granted Hoover permission
to review with Russian scholars
documents written by Communist
officials from the Bolshevik revo
lution of 1917 to the 1991 coup at
tempt. Hoover deputy director
Charles Palm called the Russian
archives the "largest body of un
tapped knowledge in the world on
the history of the 20th century."
The team of researchers will se
lect approximately 25 million
pages from the archives to micro
film. The five-year project will cost
about $3 million.
While many scholars have ex
pressed skepticism over whether
Hoover will gain access to any im
portant records, Emmons, one of
the six members of the team re
viewing the documents, said it is
"difficult to convey the sense of ex
citement I have."
Hoover's review efforts will
focus primarily on documents
from the Soviet Union's central
institutions of political power,

Hoover Deputy Director Charles Palm, Prof. Terence Emmons and Hoover Senior Fellow John Dunlop
discuss the Institution's acquisition of the archives of the former Soviet Union's Communist Party.
Emmons said, including the Party
Congress, the Central Committee
Secretariat and the Politburo.
But the team will face logistical
problems stemming from the scat
tered location of the archives and
the "black market" some Russian
officials have established for the
sale of documents, he added.
Dunlop conceded that classified
KGB and defense ministry records
may not be available to the
archivists. In addition, he said
some documents, including the

files of dissident Nobel laureates
Andrei Sakharov and Alexander
Solzhenitsyn, have been destroyed
in the last two years.
Speaking before a near-capacity
Annenberg Auditorium audience,
Palm detailed how the Institution
landed a scholarly coup he termed
"the largest archival project ever
undertaken by a research institu
tion."
Palm said Hoover's relationship
with Russian archivists began in
April of 1991, when he invited cur
rent director of Russian archives
Rudolph Pikhoia to visit Stanford.
At the time, Pikhoia was a "lit
tle-known" archivist but had close
ties to Russian President Boris

Yeltsin. Pikhoia and Hoover soon
agreed to launch two research pro
jects together.
After the coup attempt, which
Pikhoia helped thwart by keeping
communication lines open
between Yeltsin and the BBC,
Yeltsin seized Communist Party
headquarters and sealed Commu
nist archives to prevent potential
destruction of historical records.
After visiting Pikhoia in
Moscow in September and Novem
ber 1991, Palm invited the
archivist to address the Hoover
Board of Overseers in February.
"I said to him, 'Let's do some
thing important,' " Palm said. "He
said he had the same idea." The

next day, Palm completed the
archive deal alter two board mem
bers promised $1 million to launch
the project.
In exchange for the rights to copy
the document;?, Hoover will give
Russia microfil ms of its 25 million
page collection of Soviet records.
But just as Hoover reaped the
windfall of the upheaval of glas
nost, its current project could col
lapse should Russia's ever-tenuous
democratic regi me be overthrown.
"The fate of our project is linked
to the success of Yeltsin and his
entourage," Emmons said. Palm
added, "It is possible political condi
tions will become so bad that we
could be in jeopardy."
