# United by diversity
## But 'half' groups have difficulty finding common political identity 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
For Roberta Chavez, there is a bond
that unites people of mixed ethnicities —
a tie that goes beyond her own Mexican
and Caucasian heritage.
"I could probably relate to someone
who is half black and half white, half
black and half Vietnamese, or half Mexi
can and half Chinese," said Chavez, a
junior. "The majority of my friends and
people I know come from homogeneous
backgrounds, but when I do meet stu
dents who are mixed, I feel an immediate
bond."
Chavez said she wishes there was an
organization for people of mixed back
grounds and that she has thought of
starting one herself.
Sophomore Jim Ruel, who is half
Native American and half Caucasian,
said, "Being half is a major issue of
understanding and identity. I think more
than anything people like to look at your
heart. But if you're struggling with your
identity, it's hard to have a really strong
voice."
But while Stanford has a plethora of
ethnically based student groups, there
isn't an organization that Chavez and
Ruel feel they belong to.

A few years ago, a group called Spec
trum served to create a community for
students of any mixed heritage, but the
group died out for lack of interest and
membership.
Currently, only one campus organiza
tion caters to students of mixed blood,
but that group, the Half Asian Peoples
Association, limits itself to students who
are part Asian in heritage.
Chavez said the reason that Spectrum
disbanded was that it focused more on
social events than a political agenda.
"Those individuals could still get togeth
er outside of the club and have lunch, go
bowling or whatever. So without having
a particular reason to get together, it just
fell apart," she said.
Junior Ana Stenzel, a HAPA leader
who is half Japanese and half Caucasian,
said participation in her group may also
be suffering from its lack of political
activism.
"The Asian community or the Black
Student Union or BROC, they really
have a goal. They have a goal to be a cul
ture group and have their culture and
spread awareness," she said.
"But we don't have a culture. We
don't have a certain culture night thing
to do because we are all half Japanese or
half Chinese or whatever. It's not like a

total shared identity."
Junior Peter Liang, who has a Chi
nese father and a Caucasian mother, is
another leader of the group. "It's sort of
a social group, a chance for people of any
part-Asian background to get together
and share experiences," he said.
"Lots of people talk about their back
grounds and find out what other people's
backgrounds are like. Being half Asian is
not really a culture, per se," Liang said.
"It's sort of just a common bond that
allows us to come together and share our
experiences."
But Stenzel also pointed out that just
the existence of the group brings an
awareness about mixed ethnicities to the
campus.
"We come together because of our
shared experiences, our shared bi-racial
ness, to be the epitome of a melting pot.
We are two different races. We have par
ents who come from different countries
across the world. It makes us unique,"
Stenzel said.
But not everyone is interested in a
group for mixed students.
Senior Sonya Crawford, whose her
itage is half Korean and half Caucasian,
said her experiences growing up in Korea
differentiate her from other half-Asian
students.

"In general, all our experiences have
been so different. No mixed person I know
has grown up in another country. Most of
them are half Chinese and none of them
have grown up in China," she said.
"I notice students who are mixed and

it will be like a common thing. We'll joke
about it sometimes, about things that
our parents do," Crawford said.
"But I haven't really felt the need to
be in a group that's oriented toward half
this or that."
