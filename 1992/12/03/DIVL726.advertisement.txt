The Center for Teaching and Learning
announces that Winter quarter it will
offer its popular course
CTLIB2, LEARNING AND ACTION:
ACHIEVING RESULTS THROUGH CREATING
A LEARNING ORGANIZATION
TAUGHT BY JAMES D. MILOJKOVIC, Ph.D.
Vice President, Creative Directions, Inc.
This course is designed to help managers, would-be managers, and their
organizations construct new and more powerful business practices through
becoming more aware of their own learning processes. By challenging habits and
personal and organizational myths that disable learning, the capacity to learn can
be enhanced radically. In turn, the nature of organizational learning and action
can be transformed from reactive to proactive to high performance. Topics
include: language, structure, and change; learning styles and the intelligence trap;
paradox, intuition, and breakthrough; leverage of systems thinking , expertise and
personal mastery; mental models and belief systems; emotion, attachment and
successful failure; shared vision and strategic intent; team and organizational
learning.
