# Rain, rain, come again:
## Campus usage of water still limited 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
Despite yesterday's much
needed rain, University offi
cials are refusing to waver in
their water watch.
In an attempt to keep the
campus green despite Califor
nia's seventh year of drought,
planners are replacing much of
Stanford's water-guzzling
landscaping with drought-re
sistant turf and plants and are
switching irrigation lines to ac
commodate non-potable water.
"These are hard times," said
Julie Hardin, energy manage
ment coordinator. "It's Decem
ber, but we're trying to manage
our water like it's July. Every
drop counts."
November brought almost
no rainfall to California, and
very little rain is predicted for
the coming months.
In one of the latest changes,
the front of the Main Quad was
re-landscaped, and wood chips
replaced water-intensive grass
on the surrounding slopes.
In new facilities like Kimball
and Manzanita Halls, new land
scaping is being kept to a mini
mum and only drought-tolerant
plants and turf are being used.
"We want people to know
that even though they may see

new turf and new plants, we're
still practicing water manage
ment. They don't have to
worry, it's non-potable water,"
Hardin said.
Non-potable water is water
that has not been treated to
make it drinkable.
Work is also continuing to
switch all parts of campus to
non-potable irrigation, Hardin
said. Presently, almost all cam
pus irrigation is done with non
potable water from Felt Lake.
Several areas use well water, in
cluding the athletic fields next
to the stadium.
The irrigation system at Old
Pavilion is now being changed
to use water from Felt Lake.
Stanford's Water Department
plans to eventually have all irri
gation lines on that system.
Hardin said areas that still
use potable water, like Escondi
do Village and Governor's Cor
ner, are currently not being ir
rigated at all.
With the drought continuing,
Hardin said it is important that
people continue to be conscious
of water usage. There is some
concern that people may think
the rainfall from last spring
ended the drought, she said.
"We want to remind [stu-
