# Rain, rain, come again:
## Campus usage of water still limited 
### Luis Orona Staff writer 
Despite yesterday's much
needed rain, University offi
cials are refusing to waver in
their water watch.
In an attempt to keep the
campus green despite Califor
nia's seventh year of drought,
planners are replacing much of
Stanford's water-guzzling
landscaping with drought-re
sistant turf and plants and are
switching irrigation lines to ac
commodate non-potable water.
"These are hard times," said
Julie Hardin, energy manage
ment coordinator. "It's Decem
ber, but we're trying to manage
our water like it's July. Every
drop counts."
November brought almost
no rainfall to California, and
very little rain is predicted for
the coming months.
In one of the latest changes,
the front of the Main Quad was
re-landscaped, and wood chips
replaced water-intensive grass
on the surrounding slopes.
In new facilities like Kimball
and Manzanita Halls, new land
scaping is being kept to a mini
mum and only drought-tolerant
plants and turf are being used.
"We want people to know
that even though they may see

new turf and new plants, we're
still practicing water manage
ment. They don't have to
worry, it's non-potable water,"
Hardin said.
Non-potable water is water
that has not been treated to
make it drinkable.
Work is also continuing to
switch all parts of campus to
non-potable irrigation, Hardin
said. Presently, almost all cam
pus irrigation is done with non
potable water from Felt Lake.
Several areas use well water, in
cluding the athletic fields next
to the stadium.
The irrigation system at Old
Pavilion is now being changed
to use water from Felt Lake.
Stanford's Water Department
plans to eventually have all irri
gation lines on that system.
Hardin said areas that still
use potable water, like Escondi
do Village and Governor's Cor
ner, are currently not being ir
rigated at all.
With the drought continuing,
Hardin said it is important that
people continue to be conscious
of water usage. There is some
concern that people may think
the rainfall from last spring
ended the drought, she said.
"We want to remind [stu-
dents] to continue watching out
for water wastes. We want every
body to continue reporting leaks
and any other problems they
might see," Hardin said.
Though campus officials hope
to keep the campus green, there
are no plans to turn on the foun
tains that have been shut down
for four years.
While having a pretty campus
is nice, Hardin said, it is more
important to avoid costly penal
ties due to unwise water use.
This means following regulations
set bv the San Francisco and

Santa Clara Valley Water Dis
tricts, both of which prohibit
using potable water for ornamen
tal fountains.
Students have suggested
using non-potable water to run
the fountains, but Hardin says
the University has no such
plans.
Hardin said non-potable water
would severely stain the foun
tains and that running the foun
tains — even with non-potable
water — gives people the wrong
idea.
"They can give people the
impression that water is available
even for ornamental purposes."
Strict water management
began about two years ago, when
San Francisco Water District's

Hetch Hetchy system — Stan
ford's domestic water supplier —
slapped the campus with a
$300,000 fine for unwise water
use, according to Hardin.
Strict management since then
has enabled the University to
"work off' its penalty by reducing
water usage.
The Water District allots Stan
ford a certain amount of water
per month. If the University uses
more than it should, it is hit with
stiff fines.
It is important to continue
reducing water usage, Hardin
said, because saved water goes
into a "water bank account" to
which the campus can resort in
dry months and still avoid penal
ties.
