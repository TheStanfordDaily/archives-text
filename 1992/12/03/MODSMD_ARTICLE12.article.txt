Mexicans oppose U.S. trade ban
MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico has ordered U.S.-owned com
panies here to ignore a U.S. law banning trade with Cuba.
Deputy Foreign Secretary Javier Barrios Valero told a Mexi
can-European seminar on Tuesday that the government will
impose "the most severe sanctions" on companies in Mexico that
obey the so-called Torricelli law. His remarks were quoted by
Mexico City dailies yesterday.
The new U.S. law orders foreign subsidiaries of U.S. compa
nies to observe the 30-year-old U.S. trade embargo of Cuba. It
bans ships that stop in Cuba from visiting the United States.
Many U.S. allies see the measure as a violation of their
sovereignty, leading the U.N. General Assembly to condemn the
embargo.
Brazil indicts president
BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — The Senate voted 63-7 yesterday to
indict suspended President Fernando Collor de Mello, who is
charged with corruption, paving the way for a trial that could lead
to his permanent ouster.
Brazil's Chamber of Deputies impeached Collor on Sept. 29
and suspended him from office for six months after a probe
showed he took more than $6.5 million from an illegal slush fund
run by Paulo Cesar Farias, his 1989 campaign treasurer.
The Senate will rule on Dec. 22 on whether to remove Collor
from office permanently for the constitutional crime of "lack of
decorum" stemming from his alleged links to the kickback scandal.
AIDS vaccine tests OK'ed
BETHESDA, Md. (AP) — A committee of the National Insti
tutes of Health endorsed widespread human testing of AIDS vac
cines yesterday, but denounced the congressional action that
ordered the tests.
The Advisory Committee to the Director of NIH unanimously
approved a plan that calls for testing of vaccines among people
infected with AIDS. Clinical trials are still being formulated.
Congress ordered the trials in October by including in the
Defense Department's appropriation $20 million for the testing.
Members of the committee denounced Congress' action, saying
drug testing should be based on science, not politics.
