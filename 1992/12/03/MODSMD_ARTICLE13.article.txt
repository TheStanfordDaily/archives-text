# Packwood accused of more harassment
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - An
Oregon group said yesterday that
five more women have reported
"direct, personal experiences" of
sexual misconduct by Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore.
The Oregon Coalition Against
Domestic and Sexual Violence, in
a complaint to the Senate Ethics
Committee, said the women have
come forward since Nov. 22 —
when initial allegations of sexual
misconduct were made in The
Washington Post.
The newspaper reported that 10
female staff members and lobbyists
— five of whom were named in the
article — accused Packwood of sex
ual harassment, including unwant
ed touching and other advances.

Holly Pruett, who filed yester
day's complaint, said in an inter
view from Portland, Ore., that
she had spoken with four of the
five additional women.
Two said they had been
grabbed by Packwood. A third
said the senator had repeatedly
insisted she kiss him but there
had been no contact.
A fourth woman contended the
senator had made persistent, ver
bal advances and attempted to
kiss her, but otherwise there had
been no physical contact.
The fifth woman spoke to a co
worker, Pruett said, and did not
provide details of her problems
with Packwood.
Two of the five worked on

Packwood's campaigns, Pruett
said, and two held professional
positions she would not identify.
The fifth told the co-worker she
worked in the media but did not
provide details on her job.
Pruett said all the women had
called the group's hotline.
The four women Pruett talked
to all said they were not among
those cited in the Post story. She
said she has the names of the five
women, adding that all asked that
their identities not be revealed.
Acting on a complaint by anoth
er women's group, the ethics com
mittee on Tuesday said it had
begun a preliminary inquiry into
Packwood's conduct. Yesterday,
the senator's lawyers met with the

panel's staff for the first time.
Their five women said their
experiences with Packwood
ranged over time from the 1960s
to the 1980s.
In her statement, Pruett said
the "individuals are consulting
with family, friends and legal
counsel to determine their next
steps. We expect that some, if not
all, of them will be filing formal
complaints with the committee."
Packwood, just elected to his fifth
term, has not admitted any specific
improper behavior but has apolo
gized if he embarrassed anyone.
He also suggested that his behav
ior could be related to alcohol and
has entered a treatment facility for
people with drinking problems.
