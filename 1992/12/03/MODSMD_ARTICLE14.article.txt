# U.S. may send 20,000 troops to Somalia
## But congressman declares military proposal is poor use of resources, too costly 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The first high
level opposition in Congress to sending a large
U.S. force into Somalia emerged yesterday as
top military officers readied a final plan for
sending thousands of combat troops into the
devastated East African nation.
An administration source said military
advisers were today going to give President
Bush their final plans for the mercy mission to
the starving country.
The plan calls for initially landing 1,800
Marines from three ships off shore to secure
the port and airfield in Mogadishu, Somalia's
capital, said the source, who declined to be
identified by name. They would be bolstered
later by additional troops flown in from Camp
Pendleton, Calif.

Pentagon sources have said 12,000 to
20,000 U.S. troops might be involved.
Earlier yesterday, the chairman of the
House defense appropriations subcommittee
said the United States should not put large
numbers of troops into Somalia, because
America "can only afford so much" and no
one can predict how long they would stay.
"I don't think we have the resources," Rep.
John Murtha, D-Pa., told a group of defense
writers.
Military intervention in Somalia is not in
America's long-term interest and will place too
much pressure on the strapped defense bud
get, argued Murtha, whose subcommittee con
trols the purse strings for the nation's defense.
Murtha is the first senior member of Congress

to speak out against plans for the operation.
Also yesterday, U.N. diplomats said U.S.
military commanders will have to give up the
free rein they had in the Persian Gulf War and
accept some U.N. oversight of troops in Soma
lia, including when to withdraw.
But a U.S. draft resolution given to the
Security Council leaves the door open for a
U.S. general to command the proposed Amer
ican force in the famine-wracked nation.
The draft resolution is part of a compro
mise Washington is forging to win the support
of China, which has threatened to veto a free
wheeling U.S.-led operation.
The president of the 15-member Security
Council, Ambassador Chinmaya Gharekhan
of India, said a vote will be taken today.
