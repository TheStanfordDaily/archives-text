## Editorial Storage and vendors 
### 
While the ASSU debates
the speech code, student
issues are being ignored

Students don't want
First Amendment psycho
babble from senators in the
ASSU. They want action. They
want storage. They want the
White Plaza vendors to stay.
These are the kinds of things
that the ASSU can and should be
working to provide for students,
rather than resting on their lau
rels or duking out philosophical
issues with law professors.
Eight hundred students recent
ly signed a petition asking the Uni
versity not to follow through with
plans to kick the vendors out of
White Plaza. For a student body
that gets outcheered by 300 drunk
fans from Arizona, that's a pretty
impressive show of support.
The vendors — the only life in
an otherwise dead plaza — may
have one chance for salvation, and
that resides with the ASSU. If the
ASSU were to manage the vendors
on campus, as the student govern
ment at Foothill College does, they
might be given the opportunity to
sell their Guatemalan garb and
incense to many future genera
tions of Stanford students.
However, the ASSU has not
moved on this issue at all. It has
never been the subject of debate in
the ASSU meetings, and only one
senator has expressed any interest
in saving the vendors.
This senator has said that
attention to the matter will depend
on the "overall agenda" of the
ASSU. The ASSU's agenda, how
ever, would hardly be taxed if dis
cussion of the White Plaza vendors
was added to their bi-weekly meet
ing schedule.
The absence of any discussion
can only be blamed on one of two
things: the ignorance or the
incompetence of the senators.
Unfortunately, the vendors

aren't the only group on campus
being neglected by the ASSU. Stu
dent concerns as well — such as
the cancellation of summer stor
age — could be effectively
addressed by our student govern
ment.
The ASSU could capitalize on
the insensitivity of the University
by making summer storage a new
business project. In contrast with
the anemic demand for Friday
Flicks, the ASSU can be assured
that students will need somewhere
to put their belongings over the
summer.
No matter how the ASSU might
actually do it — by taking over the
University's current storage oper
ations and charging students a
small storage fee or by contracting
with off-campus storage facilities
and providing transportation at a
lower rate — they could do stu
dents a great service by providing
reasonably priced summer storage.
They might even make some
money to pay for future projects
such as Memorial Auditorium's
new sound system.
However, summer storage, as
well as the vendors of White
Plaza, has not been touched by
our student leaders. Instead,
there has been much talk —
among the senators who actually
attend the meetings — about
repealing support of the Grey
interpretation.
Certainly the issue of free
speech is an important one, but, as
opposed to their powerful position
in the other matters, the ASSU
has no actual authority to repeal
the Grey interpretation. They can
only send a message to the Student
Conduct Legislative Council, and
whether their message represents
the views of the student body is
questionable at best.
The ASSU would do better to
focus on the more immediate,
although somewhat less glam
orous, issues before taking on the
Constitution. As our mothers have
told us all at one point or another,
you've got to crawl before you can
walk.
