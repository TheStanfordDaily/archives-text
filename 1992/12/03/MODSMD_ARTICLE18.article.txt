Rattlesnake beer is great

I'M BACK FROM THE Buffalo Chip
Saloon — the finest of Carefree, Ari
zona's three bars. There I drank Rat
tlesnake beer and watched my brother
and uncle run seven pairs of locals off the
pool table while a band played bad rendi
tions of Johnny Cash as fake cowboys
stumbled with their girls to the two-step
(five- or six-step really, but I didn't say
anything).
All is quiet on my grandparents' patio.
One thousand million stars try to light up
the desert floor, and wandering packs of
coyotes howl at the moon or the new hous
es that have blossomed in Etter's and
Pop's vast back-yard desert since my par
ents decided to leave Arizona 10 years ago.
The mountains, the cacti, the dry riverbeds
— God's country is going quickly.
My family and I have flown up for
Thanksgiving with Etter and Pop, and to
celebrate Pop's and my mom's birthdays.
Yesterday I was up at dawn with my
mom, dad and brother for a hike in the
back-yard desert. I hadn't ventured into
it since the days of Cocopah elementary
school. Ah, the days of Cocopah!
I still don't know how it happened that
in sixth grade I managed to put a kid into
a coma when playing touch football. I
spent five days of school suspension
watching "Gilligan's Island" reruns and
visiting my great-grandmother at
Phoenix Mountain Nursing Home. I
brought her vanilla milk shakes, let her

win all the card games she taught me and
entertained her by playing pool with a cue
twice my height in the home's dining hall.
I got suspended a second time for kick
ing an older girl who was bullying a friend
of mine. But nothing could take away the
afternoons of kiss tag with the Longneck
er sisters and wheelie contests with Josh
Dunham up and down East North Lane.
My two brothers threw pool parties
and fooled around with Josh's older sis
ter while Josh and I raised the front tires
of our BMXs toward the sun and tried to
ride our wheelies to the Klute's mailbox,
or the Ganal's, or the strange family
without a name whose son we had seen
one day masturbating into his pool with
an electric guitar strapped to his back.
In those years, the sun was white with
heat and salvation came once a day dur
ing air-conditioned naps in bedrooms
dark with the curtains drawn. My par
ents missed the East coast, my brothers
went to high school parties broken up by
police helicopters, my sister danced ballet
around the pool deck and I thought a long
enough wheelie or game of kiss tag would
bring snow for Christmas. I stopped try
ing in the winter of sixth grade when my
parents told us we were moving back to
Connecticut.
It was a 115 degree day 10 Junes ago
when we headed off in a brown Subur
ban. Since then, we have been back sev
eral times — together and on our own —

to visit my grandparents, old friends, old
watering holes, etc.
And tonight, we celebrated Pop's 80th
— we listen to my mom's toast to him, his
friends' jokes, my brother's songs. To the
left of us the horizon glowed orange with
the setting sun, and behind us, somewhere
in the Scottsdale valley, our old neighbor
hood hummed with all of my family's
memories of 6715 East North Lane.
I guess it's the magic of retrospect that
lets us shake and cleanse the past, and
laugh at what was once nothing to laugh
at. It wasn't funny when my brother acci
dentally threw a match at Josh's stomach
sticky with suntan oil, and it wasn't
funny when my dad had to punch out
wicked Mr. Schaeffer for taunting me
and my siblings from the front seat of his
station wagon.
But now, these and other memories
bring us to hysterical fits of laughter, and
I can only wonder how seriously to take
the down side of things knowing that
what is now so serious may soon be comic.

parents told us we were moving back to
Connecticut.
It was a 115 degree day 10 Junes ago
when we headed off in a brown Subur
ban. Since then, we have been back sev
eral times — together and on our own —

to visit my grandparents, old friends, old
watering holes, etc.
And tonight, we celebrated Pop's 80th
— we listen to my mom's toast to him, his
friends' jokes, my brother's songs. To the
left of us the horizon glowed orange with
the setting sun, and behind us, somewhere
in the Scottsdale valley, our old neighbor
hood hummed with all of my family's
memories of 6715 East North Lane.
I guess it's the magic of retrospect that
lets us shake and cleanse the past, and
laugh at what was once nothing to laugh
at. It wasn't funny when my brother acci
dentally threw a match at Josh's stomach
sticky with suntan oil, and it wasn't
funny when my dad had to punch out
wicked Mr. Schaeffer for taunting me
and my siblings from the front seat of his
station wagon.
But now, these and other memories
bring us to hysterical fits of laughter, and
I can only wonder how seriously to take
the down side of things knowing that
what is now so serious may soon be comic.
