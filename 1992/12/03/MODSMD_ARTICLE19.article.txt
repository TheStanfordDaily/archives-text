Student experiences overt racism at Faculty Club

SINCE FRESHMAN YEAR I HAVE
worked at the Stanford Faculty
Club serving and hostessing, and it
is a job I have generally enjoyed.
I work with many interesting people
and I enjoy the faculty-student interac
tion. For the most part, the members
of the Club have been friendly and
polite.
However, while working in late
October, I was verbally attacked by a
Stanford professor. Because of a delay
in service for which I was mistakenly
blamed, he viciously insulted me to
my face with remarks such as, "You're
a fool!" and "Go back to China!"
When I remarked that I was Ameri
can-born and that his comment was
racist, he retorted that he did not care
where I was from and, "Oh yes, I am
so known for being politically incor
rect!"
I cannot express the extent to which I
was upset. His words were cruel and his
tone was hateful. Extremely shocked by
his comments, I felt totally degraded

and humiliated.
My initial reaction was revenge. I
wanted to expose him, to let the entire
campus know what kind of a person he
was, and to embarrass him. But I did
not know the best way to handle the
situation. As a sophomore, I experi
enced a similar incident, and failed to
act. I have always regretted this passive
response. This time I needed to take
action. I made inquiries and deliberated
my response, seeking the advice of sev
eral friends, professors and administra
tors.
I finally decided to write the professor
a letter reminding him of the incident
and informing him of the deep hurt I
felt. I also sent several copies of the let
ter to different administrators on cam
pus, including the Provost, the Dean of
the professor's school and the Faculty
Club Board of Directors.
I received a letter of apology from the
professor himself. Throughout the
entire process, I learned that the admin
istration and the Faculty Club board

also viewed the matter seriously, and I
commend them on their prompt
response.
Nevertheless, this story — which
seems to have a happy ending — should
be seen as more than simply Professor X
insults Student Y, apologizes, and case
closed. I share my experiences with you
not because I want to evoke sympathy or
anger, but because I want to raise
awareness.
Anyone who has ever been the victim
of blatant discrimination realizes that
the feelings of utter powerlessness and
loss of dignity are not easy to forget. I
have spent a great deal of time and emo
tion this quarter in resolving the issue,
and will never forget it.
Throughout my years at Stanford, I
have heard words such as "multicultur
alism" and "political correctness" used
again and again, and I know the resent
ment and backlash these terms have
incited. This incident, however, has
nothing to do with political correctness
or multiculturalism. It has to do with

common decency and respect to another
human being.
It is time to look beyond the surface
and really think about the root of the
problem. Let us not allow images of
Bennetton advertisements and the
debate over political correctness to
cloud our judgment. We are living
today in a world in which people
believe in the existence of a racial hier
archy.
Why does a professor at Stanford
University resort to racial slurs? What is
racism, and what causes people to
believe in a genetic superiority among
humans? These are the questions with
which we should really be concerned.
This quarter has emphasized to me
the sad fact that ignorance is not neces
sarily eradicated by education, intelli
gence or success.
No one, not even a Stanford profes
sor, is exempt from irrational thought
and behavior.
