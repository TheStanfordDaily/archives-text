## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Following the ASSU Senate's
re-affirmation of the Grey Inter
pretation of the Fundamental
Standard, Law Prof. Thomas
Grey asserted on KZSU's "Talk
back" program last night that the
policy was meant to facilitate, not
inhibit, free speech.
By clarifying and keeping nar
row the definitions of harassment
language, speech will not be sub
ject to the "vaguest" interpreta
tions under the University's Fun
damental Standard, said Grey, the
author of the interpretation.
Law Prof. William Cohen and

ASSU graduate senator Rob
Corry, who oppose the Grey Inter
pretation, and former ASSU sena
tor Jason Snyder, who supports it,
also participated in the program,
hosted by senior Adriana Duffy.
The senate voted at its meeting
Tuesday night not to repeal its ap
proval of the Grey Interpretation,
which was passed in 1989 and pro
hibits the use of harsh and insult
ing language based on ethnicity,
gender, sexual orientation, physi
cal disability or religion. The code
applies when the language is di
rected at a person or small group
of people.
