Following the ASSU Senate's
re-affirmation of the Grey Inter
pretation of the Fundamental
Standard, Law Prof. Thomas
Grey asserted on KZSU's "Talk
back" program last night that the
policy was meant to facilitate, not
inhibit, free speech.
By clarifying and keeping nar
row the definitions of harassment
language, speech will not be sub
ject to the "vaguest" interpreta
tions under the University's Fun
damental Standard, said Grey, the
author of the interpretation.
Law Prof. William Cohen and

ASSU graduate senator Rob
Corry, who oppose the Grey Inter
pretation, and former ASSU sena
tor Jason Snyder, who supports it,
also participated in the program,
hosted by senior Adriana Duffy.
The senate voted at its meeting
Tuesday night not to repeal its ap
proval of the Grey Interpretation,
which was passed in 1989 and pro
hibits the use of harsh and insult
ing language based on ethnicity,
gender, sexual orientation, physi
cal disability or religion. The code
applies when the language is di
rected at a person or small group
of people.
"The basics are real simple,"
Grey said, responding to a caller
who expressed confusion about the
forms of speech prohibited by the
code. "You can't call anyone a racial
epithet to their face, over the phone
or on an answering machine."
It is important to make the dis
tinction between offensive views
that are aimed at the general pub
lic, which are not restricted under
the Grey Interpretation, and epi
thets that are aimed at a single
person "to provoke a fight or the
equivalent," Grey said.
As an example, Grey said that
posters with racist language are not
prohibited by the interpretation,
while harassing someone in a face
to-face confrontation is prohibited.
However, Cohen said while he
agrees with the premise of Grey's
policy, he believes that students
remain uncertain about the defi
nitions of harassment under the
Grey Interpretation, and there
fore feel that their free speech
and thought are constrained by
its existence.
Evaluating whether students
are censoring their speech because
of the Grey Interpretation is prob
lematic because people "cannot
evaluate what isn't said," Cohen
added.

Corry, who wrote the ASSU
bill to repeal approval of the Grey
Interpretation, said he believes
"all free speech has innate value,"
and that a "principled, absolutist
stand about the Constitution"
must protect even "unpopular"
free speech.
"Here at Stanford, we are
engaged in the pursuit of ideas
and creating minds," he said,
pointing out that restrictions on
the First Amendment can infringe
this pursuit.
Grey disagreed, asking, "What's
educational about the kind of con
duct prohibited |in the interpreta
tion!? I don't see how it expands
... ideas."
According to Snyder, the cli
mate was "scary for students"
before the Grey Interpretation
was approved, because definitions
of discriminatory speech under
the Fundamental Standard had
been left to the interpretation of
administrators.
The arbitrariness of these
judgements caused students to
restrict their speech even more
than necessary under the Grey
Interpretation, he added.
Grey acknowledged that the
interpretation "could be criti
cized," but said he felt it was "rel
atively clear and objective."
Cohen said while the Grey
Interpretation was "well-writ
ten," many students think it cov
ers "the whole range of speech."
