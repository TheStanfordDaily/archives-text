# Malcolm X's beliefs are not easily pigeon-holed
## 
### 
I'm sure it must have come as a bit of
a shock to neo-conservatives all over
campus after San Jose State professor
Tommy Lott said that Malcolm X dis
played "Neo-conservatism with an atti
tude," in the The Daily article "Many
Malcolms" (Nov. 24).
When Malcolm was interviewed by
the "Young Socialist," a newspaper of
the junior Trotsky ists of the Socialist
Workers Party (Jan. 19, 1965), a month
before his death, he stated that "Capital
ism used to be like an eagle, but now it's
more like a vulture. It used to be strong
enough to go and suck anybody's blood
whether they were strong or not.

"But now, it has become more coward
ly, like the vulture, and it can only suck
the blood of the helpless. As the nations
in the free world free themselves, then
capitalism has less victims, less to suck,
and it becomes weaker and weaker. It's
only a matter of time, in my opinion,
before it will collapse completely."
For those wishing to explore the real
Malcolm X further, might I suggest his
speeches which have been collected in
various formats and which exist in
libraries all over the country including
our very own Green Library. In addi
tion, I personally recommended Prof.
Clay Carson's excellent piece in the Sun
day, Nov. 22 San Francisco
Examiner/Chronicle.
