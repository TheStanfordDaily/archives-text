# Nothing wrong with an outsider judging culture
## 
### 
The first time I read Andrea Parkes'
column in the Dec. 1 Daily, I thought it
must be a parody of multiculturalism.
On further reading I believe that she is
serious but morally obtuse.
There are universal values to which
we as human beings subscribe. It is
morally wrong to inflict pain on another
human being. If there are degrees in
such a matter, it is especially repugnant
to inflict pain on a defenseless child.
Clitoridectomy is not genital "alter
ation," as she describes it but genital
'mutilation,' a far uglier if more truthful
term. On what grounds does one justify
such a practice?

Cultural relativism is a slippery slope.
Her piece reflects multiculturalism run
rampant. All cultures are equally valid
according to this reasoning. If one fol
lows Parkes' line of argument, one could
never condemn the Nazis and the Holo
caust.
After all, the Nazi culture sanctioned
gassing the Jews. Can one criticize the
Aztecs and their human sacrifices? Can
Parkes refrain from "defining the
rights" of the Native Americans who
were slaughtered by Cortes?
"How can [she] argue against a cul
ture |that she hasn'tl tried to under
stand? Is it relevant that [she], an out
sider, may find the practice cruel?" You
bet it is!
