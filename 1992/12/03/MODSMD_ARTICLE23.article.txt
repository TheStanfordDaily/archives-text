## Hoops cuts down Loggers in season premiere, 92-42 Defense sparkles in opener 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
You might not be surprised to hear that Stanford
scored 92 points against the University of Puget Sound
last night — such scores are common in the world of
collegiate basketball. What may surprise you is the 42-
point total amassed by Puget Sound — a respectable
score only in the world of collegiate football.
Fans of Stanford's men's basketball team proba
bly didn't expect a dominating offensive show
against the Loggers last night, and they really didn't
get one. The name of the game for the Cardinal last
night was defense. Defense with a capital D.
Stanford's 13 team steals kept Puget Sound
scrambling and grabbing for the ball all night, not to
mention all the unrecorded slap-aways, broken plays
and missed passes forced by the Cardinal defense.
Every trip down the floor for Puget Sound seemed to
result in a tipped ball or bobbled pass, while each
Stanford player took his turn in the face of a Logger.
Kenny Hicks set the defensive tone early for the
Cardinal, when he batted a perimeter pass away
from Logger guard Todd Doolittle and dove into —
and over — the courtside press table for the loose
ball. Hicks was all right, and returned to the game to
register two steals and a number of tipped passes.
Stanford's strong defensive presence might be a
gleam of hope to many pessimists this year. True,
Stanford's inability to go inside like it did when Adam
Keefe was on the Farm meant head coach Mike Mont
gomery would toe without one of his key weapons
against a talented conference team. But Montgomery
might find a new weapon in a speedy, aggressive team
defense that pesters visiting shooters and disrupts the
opposing team's offensive flow. If you have any
doubts about the effectiveness of that kind of weapon,
just ask the Loggers, who came up 50 points short.
Stanford will likely get another boost in upcom
ing games by the return of Andy Poppink to the line
up. Bad lower back pains forced Poppink to sit out
the Cardinal's first two exhibition games, but last
night he returned to the court to register seven
points and four rebounds on the night.
Add to that 11 points by sophomore center Bart
Lammersen, and strong performances off the bench
by freshmen Dion Cross, who tallied eight points,
and Darren Allaway, who added five, and you might
just have reason to worry about this team.

The Cardinal opened the post-Keefe era
with a 92-42 thumping of NAIA also-ran
Puget Sound Wednesday, giving a young
front line a chance to wet its feet versus less
than inspiring competition.
Veterans Marcus Lollie, Peter Dukes
and Brent Williams gave the 2,500 Maples
Pavilion die-hards a taste of the free-swing
ing perimeter game that should mark the
1992-93 Cardinal campaign. But more
important for coach Mike Montgomery was
the opportunity to give his post players
much-needed experience in a low-pressure
situation.
Because of injuries to would-be starters
Jim Morgan and Jason Weaver, Mont
gomery was forced to insert raw sopho
mores Todd Manley and Bart Lammersen
in the starting lineup. And it's not as if
experienced hands are waiting should the 6-
foot-9, separated-at-birth forwards fail.
Backing them up is true freshman Darren
Allaway, who played 18 minutes against the
Loggers.
"I've said all along that these guys are
being thrown into a situation before they
were supposed to be ready," Montgomery
said. "For the young kids that haven't
played before — Manley, Lammersen, All
away — this was a legitimate learning expe
rience.
"If they only get a chance to play against
superior competition they're not going to be
able to learn enough about what they can
do. But when we get into a situation when
we have better players, we can relax and
perform our best."
Both Manley and Lammersen turned in
solid, but not flashy, performances. Lam
mersen hit all five of his free throw
attempts and poured in 11 points. Manley
grabbed a game-high 11 rebounds and
added four points.
Keefe's departure has thrown the scor
ing burden onto Williams and senior guards
Lollie and Dukes. All three of them
responded Wednesday, shooting a com
bined 17-for-24 from the field and totalling
41 points.

Williams looked more confident than
ever offensively, burning a plodding Logger
defense with baseline drives and pull-up
jumpers. He led all scorers with 15 points as
he hit seven of his 10 shots.
Lollie added 14 points and spent the
night harassing Puget Sound ball handlers.
He grabbed three of Stanford's 13 steals to
go along with his three assists. Backcourt
mate Dukes, who last year set a school
record with 79 three-pointers, was a perfect
4-for-4 from behind the stripe, good for his
12 points.
Montgomery was able to play his entire
bench in the cakewalk, including true
freshman guard Dion Cross, who hustled
his way to eight points in his collegiate
debut.
Andy Poppink, who missed both of the
Cardinal's exhibition games with a bad
lower back, came off the pine to clear four
boards and score seven points in his new
role on the low block.
The Cardinal will try to extend its per
fect record tonight, this time against NCAA
Division I competition. Stanford travels to
the South Bay to face San Jose State
tonight at 7:45 p.m.

cowers in fear below. The Cardinal drubbed the Loggers, 92-42, in

superior competition they're not going to be
able to learn enough about what they can
do. But when we get into a situation when
we have better players, we can relax and
perform our best."
Both Manley and Lammersen turned in
solid, but not flashy, performances. Lam
mersen hit all five of his free throw
attempts and poured in 11 points. Manley
grabbed a game-high 11 rebounds and
added four points.
Keefe's departure has thrown the scor
ing burden onto Williams and senior guards
Lollie and Dukes. All three of them
responded Wednesday, shooting a com
bined 17-for-24 from the field and totalling
41 points.

Williams looked more confident than
ever offensively, burning a plodding Logger
defense with baseline drives and pull-up
jumpers. He led all scorers with 15 points as
he hit seven of his 10 shots.
Lollie added 14 points and spent the
night harassing Puget Sound ball handlers.
He grabbed three of Stanford's 13 steals to
go along with his three assists. Backcourt
mate Dukes, who last year set a school
record with 79 three-pointers, was a perfect
4-for-4 from behind the stripe, good for his
12 points.
Montgomery was able to play his entire
bench in the cakewalk, including true
freshman guard Dion Cross, who hustled
his way to eight points in his collegiate
debut.
Andy Poppink, who missed both of the
Cardinal's exhibition games with a bad
lower back, came off the pine to clear four
boards and score seven points in his new
role on the low block.
The Cardinal will try to extend its per
fect record tonight, this time against NCAA
Division I competition. Stanford travels to
the South Bay to face San Jose State
tonight at 7:45 p.m.


Brent Williams drives to the hoop as Puget Sound's Casey Irgens
cowers in fear below. The Cardinal drubbed the Loggers, 92-42, in
its 1992-93 season opener.
You might not be surprised to hear that Stanford
scored 92 points against the University of Puget Sound
last night — such scores are common in the world of
collegiate basketball. What may surprise you is the 42-
point total amassed by Puget Sound — a respectable
score only in the world of collegiate football.
Fans of Stanford's men's basketball team proba
bly didn't expect a dominating offensive show
against the Loggers last night, and they really didn't
get one. The name of the game for the Cardinal last
night was defense. Defense with a capital D.
Stanford's 13 team steals kept Puget Sound
scrambling and grabbing for the ball all night, not to
mention all the unrecorded slap-aways, broken plays
and missed passes forced by the Cardinal defense.
Every trip down the floor for Puget Sound seemed to
result in a tipped ball or bobbled pass, while each
Stanford player took his turn in the face of a Logger.
Kenny Hicks set the defensive tone early for the
Cardinal, when he batted a perimeter pass away
from Logger guard Todd Doolittle and dove into —
and over — the courtside press table for the loose
ball. Hicks was all right, and returned to the game to
register two steals and a number of tipped passes.
Stanford's strong defensive presence might be a
gleam of hope to many pessimists this year. True,
Stanford's inability to go inside like it did when Adam
Keefe was on the Farm meant head coach Mike Mont
gomery would toe without one of his key weapons
against a talented conference team. But Montgomery
might find a new weapon in a speedy, aggressive team
defense that pesters visiting shooters and disrupts the
opposing team's offensive flow. If you have any
doubts about the effectiveness of that kind of weapon,
just ask the Loggers, who came up 50 points short.
Stanford will likely get another boost in upcom
ing games by the return of Andy Poppink to the line
up. Bad lower back pains forced Poppink to sit out
the Cardinal's first two exhibition games, but last
night he returned to the court to register seven
points and four rebounds on the night.
Add to that 11 points by sophomore center Bart
Lammersen, and strong performances off the bench
by freshmen Dion Cross, who tallied eight points,
and Darren Allaway, who added five, and you might
just have reason to worry about this team.

The Cardinal opened the post-Keefe era
with a 92-42 thumping of NAIA also-ran
Puget Sound Wednesday, giving a young
front line a chance to wet its feet versus less
than inspiring competition.
Veterans Marcus Lollie, Peter Dukes
and Brent Williams gave the 2,500 Maples
Pavilion die-hards a taste of the free-swing
ing perimeter game that should mark the
1992-93 Cardinal campaign. But more
important for coach Mike Montgomery was
the opportunity to give his post players
much-needed experience in a low-pressure
situation.
Because of injuries to would-be starters
Jim Morgan and Jason Weaver, Mont
gomery was forced to insert raw sopho
mores Todd Manley and Bart Lammersen
in the starting lineup. And it's not as if
experienced hands are waiting should the 6-
foot-9, separated-at-birth forwards fail.
Backing them up is true freshman Darren
Allaway, who played 18 minutes against the
Loggers.
"I've said all along that these guys are
being thrown into a situation before they
were supposed to be ready," Montgomery
said. "For the young kids that haven't
played before — Manley, Lammersen, All
away — this was a legitimate learning expe
rience.
"If they only get a chance to play against
superior competition they're not going to be
able to learn enough about what they can
do. But when we get into a situation when
we have better players, we can relax and
