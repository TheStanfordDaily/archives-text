# Baring Brooks Johnson's bitter legacy
## 
### 
You probably know at least one person
who hates Brooks Johnson.
I do.
Everyone hears those horror stories about
psychotic college coaches who believe in
humiliation, public criticism and tirades as
the best ways to motivate their athletes. Until
this year, the Stanford cross country and track
teams sported one of the masters of the trade.
But ding, dong, the witch is dead, and the
Cardinal's former festering plague has gone to
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. It's just too bad it
had to happen so late.
Running at Stanford was hell.
When I stepped on the Stanford campus,
unbeknownst to me, I suddenly transformed
from one of the better runners in L.A. to a
"bourgeoisie brat."
Brooks Johnson had decided that I was
some spoiled, cushy weakling unable to work
hard and too lazy to finish an "easy distance"
day of 10 miles.
It was news to me.
Actually all 11 of my teammates were bour
geoisie brats. Miles didn't matter. Times
didn't matter. I don't recall wearing Gucci
sweats and thick, gold chains to practice.
But he was the coach; he had the power to
use his personal nickname for me, "Shithead,"
in front of 40 people I didn't know at team
meetings. The power to skip me when he went
around asking everyone their goals at the
beginning of each new segment of the season.
The power to make me forget that running
was the one thing that kept me from dropping
CIV and selling myself into prostitution.

My freshman year, when I should've been
painting my toenails with white-out while dis
cussing the length of my CIV lecturer's nose
hairs at four in the morning, I was busy sleep
ing. A tragedy.
Sleeping at 4 a.m. just so I would have
every little ounce of energy the next day to
prove Brooks wrong. Running cross country
and track at Stanford wasn't the idyllic dream
I had imagined after my high school experi
ence, but I always had this pipe dream that
it'd all turn around in a day or two.
I wasn't a "jogger." I don't like terrycloth
sweatbands and Zips shoes. When he said to
run 10 miles a day all summer, I ran 10 miles
a day all summer. When we did six mile
repeats, I did six mile repeats. Like everybody
else, I was a star in my hometown, but I didn't
come to Stanford to have rose petals thrown at
my feet and the key to the Phi Delt house
included in some euphoric scholarship pack
age with a tall, Steven Segal-esque masseuse
written in the fine print.
But I did expect to be treated like a human
being. Being "thumped" on the head for my

bad attitude didn't vault me to the top of the
Pac-10; watching others try not to cry as
Johnson told them — in front of God and
everybody — that they needed to lose 20
pounds, didn't make me break the sound bar
rier.
Soon all that mattered was letting Brooks
know he could go to hell and that I'd lick his
blood-red track clean before I'd ever let him
see me cry.
I watched as nine out of the 12 women who
came to training camp quit, during the year or
over the summer. I began to understand why
Stanford never had any upperclassmen on its
track teams. And the whole time I wondered if
the athletic director liked our pre-pubescent
team too much to notice.
We all had heard about the one women a
year or two back who went to the AD to com
plain, only to have her name slipped to John
son. At the next team meeting she was intro
duced as a "conniving bitch" and was kicked
off the team. So much for going through the
right channels.
On the track, all I did was choke. I never
told my parents, but my brother, who ran
under Johnson when he was at Stanford, suf
fered through watching me once. He under
stood. But as I looked at his pathetically under
standing glance and watched him try to hide
his embarrassment and cheer for me as I shuf
fled around the track, I figured it was time to
quit. Time to realize that I was the only one
who could rescue myself from that man.

I still hate that man. I wish I
could have him in front of me so I
could pay him back for chewing
up all the good runners who've
come through his program, spit
ting them out to finish in last
place like me.
Finally, this year, I see a
change. This year's coach, Vin
Lananna, has ushered in a new
era for Stanford running. A posi
tive attitude. . . what a concept.
And it works.
In Lananna's first season here
since Johnson's departure, Stan
ford turned in two fourth-place
finishes in Pac-10's, whereas the
year before they were having
trouble fielding a team.
And Gary Stolz, who was think
ing of quitting before, took second
in the NCAA Championships. Is
he a bourgeoisie brat? If he'd have
quit, would he be one?
I imagine it helped to have the

support of his coach, with Lanan
na's new goals for Stanford and
commitment to rebuilding the
Cardinal's limping program as he
did at Dartmouth. Coaches and
players don't have to be best
friends, but a bitter, antagonistic
coach/enemy doesn't foster a
championship mentality.
I, for one, am glad to see the
change. At least I can look at the
girl down the hall who runs cross
country without pity. It still goes
on in other sports, but in at least
one program it is straightened out.
I just wish someone, some
where had taken the time to stop
what was going on before that
man got a hold of me. I hope the
AD at SLO keeps an eye out.
As for me, I spit on Johnson's
grave. Gladly.

Tish Williams hates to break it to
Marshall Faulk, but she's got the
edge on him. As a matter of fact,
she received the Heisman in a pri
vate ceremony last weekend at
home. Her lifetime total now far
surpasses Notre Dame's.
