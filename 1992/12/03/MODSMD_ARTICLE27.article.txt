# Paaso walks softly, carries big swing

On Friday, seating at Maples Pavil
ion will be scarce as fans of Stanford
women's volleyball pour in to watch
their Cardinal open up play in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament. But
there's one fan that might be particular
ly upset with her seating Friday night.
Kristi Paaso, a senior starting hitter
for the Cardinal and, according to head
coach Don Shaw, "one of the most con
sistent, solid players out there," might
watch Friday's match from the bench,
due to acute tendonitis of the knee. And
this is one player who hates sitting out.
"It's not my idea of fun," Paaso
admits. "Obviously I want to be out on
the court where I can contribute, but I'll
just have to see how things go this week."
Followers of Stanford volleyball have
little problem telling you how valuable
Paaso is. She is third on the team in kills
with 240, and third in kill average with
2.8 per game. She has 228 digs on the
year, second behind Cary Wendell, and
only three-time Ail-American Bev Oden
has gotten more attempts this year. She
is averaging 8.4 kills in each match, due
to both an imposing swing and an abili
ty to go down the line or cross-court
with ease.
She played every match as a fresh
man in 1989 and all but three last year,
and rebounded from a back injury in
1990 to play in Stanford's last nine

matches. And all this from someone her
teammates call "quiet."
"I hope I can bring consistency and
dependability in my passing and hit
ting," Paaso said. "But I also want to
supply intensity — I really want to push
myself, to be bloodthirsty, and make
sure the other team knows there's no
way they can win."
Paaso has been supplying intensity to
the volleyball court ever since junior high
school in her nearby hometown of Los
Altos. From there she went on to Los
Altos High School, where she started as a
middle blocker for coach Burt Fuller and
was named the Peninsula Times-Tri
bune high school Athlete of the Year.
As a freshman player at Stanford,
Paaso found herself competing with
players like Oden, Kristin Klein and
Amy Cooper for starting spots.
"I knew it would be competitive com
ing in," Paaso said. "And of course, I'm
naturally paranoid, so I was always wor
ried that I wouldn't play, or Don [Shawl
would pull me if I messed up."
But Paaso earned valuable playing
time her freshman year, contributing to
the team immediately, finishing the sea
son fifth on the team in digs while
recording double figures in kills five
times.
It looked like Paaso would improve
on that performance during her sopho
more season, but after starting the first
three matches for the Cardinal, she suf
fered a herniated disk and missed Stan

ford's next 19 matches. Paaso recalls
that returning from the injury meant
more competition for playing time.
"It was real hard after getting hurt,"
Paaso said. "There wasn't a lot of room
on the team when I was a junior, and it
got more competitive for starting spots.
I just tried to be where the opportunities
were."
Paaso finally got that opportunity
this year, and has started every match
for the Cardinal in 1992. But that
doesn't keep Paaso from constantly ana
lyzing and improving her game, and
putting in the hard work her teammates
and fans recognize her for.
"My timing and hitting ability have
improved, but there are always games
I'm not happy with," Paaso said. "I
want to be more consistent in passing —
a lot of what we do relies on it. Getting
kills, well, that's the gravy."
For her part, Paaso has contributed
to a virtually untouchable Stanford
team that is ranked second in the nation
and is on its way to a 12th consecutive
appearance in the NCAA Tournament.
Paaso played on the squad that last year
finished the regular season undefeated
in conference play, but lost in the NCAA
Tournament to a UCLA Bruin team
Stanford had defeated twice during the
regular season. Paaso sees a much dif
ferent Cardinal team this year, and
hopes that history might repeat itself,

Kristi Paaso has watched her Cardinal teammates dominate the women's volleyball
scene during her four years at Stanford. She will be making her final home appearance
Friday when the Cardinal takes on Pittsburgh in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
only this time in Stanford's
favor.
"This year I think we're work
ing very hard and have a lot more
determination," Paaso said. "A
lot of the difference comes from
attitude and momentum, since we
know that they both have a lot to
do with whether we win or not."
Stanford will have to hope so.
In what might shape up as one of
the high dramas this year in colle
giate sports, Stanford and UCLA
are seeded in separate regions,
and, should they survive the rest
of the NCAA field, will meet each
other in the Finals playing for the
1992 NCAA Women's Volleyball
Championship. And that's just
fine with Paaso.
"We can definitely beat them,
but we can't just overpower
them," Paaso said. "We have to
match power with intelligent
play, pass well, and just play a
smart match. You'd think at
Stanford we could definitely out
think UCLA.
"Someone's going to win it all,
and we really want to be the team
this vear."
