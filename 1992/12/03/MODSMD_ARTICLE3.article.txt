# Prof, apologizes for racist remarks
## Faculty Club, School of Engineering work to improve racial atmosphere 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
A School of Engineering professor who made
racist remarks to a student employee of the Fac
ulty Club has apologized to her, and University
and Faculty Club officials have begun taking ac
tion to insure further incidents do not occur.
No formal action has been taken against the
professor, who has admitted to making insulting
comments to Chinese-American senior Mary
Wu, who works as a waitress at the Faculty Club.
Wu said the incident took place in October
while she was working at the Faculty Club. "A
professor became angry with me because he
thought I had forgotten to given him his order,

but I was not his waitress," she said.
"He called me over and was really upset at
me. Later I went back to clear up the misun
derstanding and offer my apologies," said Wu,
who declined to identify the professor.
"He blew up," she said, adding that he made
remarks including " 'Go back to China,' 'Get
out of my face' and 'You make me sick.'"
When Wu told the professor his remarks were
racist, she said he responded by saying, "Oh yes,
I am so known for being politically correct."
"What he said about being politically correct
really killed me," Wu said. "He was excusing
his behavior by saying he was against being po
litically correct. That is not an excuse for hurt
ing people."

The Faculty Club's board of directors is re
sponding to the incident by writing a letter to
all its members, explaining the University's
harassment policy and the restaurant's desire
to maintain an open and accepting environ
ment for members, their guests and the em
ployees, said board president Marian Adams.
According to Adams, the board will specifi
cally send a letter to the faculty member in
volved. "The Faculty Club board takes this
very seriously and hopes this action will not be
repeated," Adams said. "We have taken action
to insure that it won't."
Wu also said the Faculty Club responded
well to the incident. "I think Mari
an Adams has been kind and shown
sincere concern. I think she has
acted quickly and professionally."
But Wu said the dynamics of
the Faculty Club may have helped
cause the incident.
"Because there are a lot of Chi
nese workers from the mainland
who don't speak English, I am the
one who has had these incidents,"
she said. "I am one of the only
Asian-Americans working there,
and I think the people have
assumed I was from the mainland
and therefore my English wasn't
good enough to understand what
they were saying."
Lynn Enoch, a junior working
as a waitress at the Faculty Club,
said she agreed the language bar
rier was a part of the cause. "The
customers think [the Chinese
workers] can't speak English and
reply," Enoch said.
But she added that she has not
experienced "blatant" racism
despite her African-American and
Vietnamese heritage.
"It's usually just a subtle
thing," she said. "You know
someone's giving you a hard time
(because of race), but they've
never called me nigger."
Another Faculty Club employee,
Mexican-American senior Eric
Schiedler, said he has never experi
enced any racism "personally" but
he attributed that to the fact that
he looks white and doesn't have an
accent when he speaks English.
A quick response
Wu said she also admired the way

the administration handled the
incident. "I do believe they have
handled it very kindly, very pro
fessionally and very promptly, M
she said. "There has been an ade
quate and commendable response
by the administration."
Dean of Engineering James
Gibbons said that once he heard
about the incident he immediate
ly wrote Wu a letter apologizing
on behalf of the School of Engi
neering.
"I also wrote a letter to the pro
fessor. . . attached Mary's letter to
it, and strongly suggested he write
a letter of apology," Gibbons said.
The professor, who is currently
on sabbatical and out of the coun
try, has written a letter of apology to
Wu, according to Gibbons, who also
received a separate letter from him.
"What he said in a separate letter
to me was not different in any sig
nificant way from her description of
the event," Gibbons said. "He does
admit this is unacceptable.
"He attributed it to a bad temper
on the occasion," Gibbons added.
Wu wrote a letter to The Daily
explaining the incident that
appears on today's opinions page.
In addition, she said she plans to
meet with the professor next
quarter because she wants him to
know "how much his action has
affected my life." She added that
she spent the entire quarter
thinking about the incident and
ways to respond to it.
Wu added that she is trying to
handle the whole incident rational
ly. "I think it is so important that
people realize that I am not an
over-reactionist, militant feminist
making a mountain out of a mole
hill. I thought about this," she said.
Provost Gerald Lieberman has
also written a letter of apology to

Wu. One of his assistants said the
provost would not answer ques
tions about the incident because he
was "allowing the Dean (of Engi
neering) free reign in the matter."
Both the Black Student Union
and the Asian American Student
Association wrote letters to admin
istrators after learning about the
incident, group leaders said.
"We talked to Mary. We all
knew the situation and felt what
happened was wrong and our ini
tial step was to write a letter to
express our disapproval of what
had happened," said AASA chair
Anne Wong, adding that the group
received a response from Gibbons.
BSU co-chair Allyson Dickson
said the group felt a need to initi
ate a dialogue between students
and administrators to encourage
response to the incident.
Gibbons said he hopes to work
with Wu and other students of
color next quarter to create a
forum for discussing racial and
sexual relations within the School
of Engineering.
"We are trying to divide the
issue into two pieces," he said.
"The first one is how to resolve
the personal issue between her
and the professor. The second is
how to bring the issue to the
attention of the faculty so they
could learn from it.
"It's not a single individual
who acts up," Gibbons continued.
"It's an institutional issue, but
it's also not a lot of faculty who do
it. I don't think it's sufficient for
the resolution to be only between
Mary and the professor."
Wu said she sees the forum as a
good means of education. "I think
a forum is a step in trying to
improve race relations and
increase awareness," she said.

tions about the incident because he
was "allowing the Dean (of Engi
neering) free reign in the matter."
Both the Black Student Union
and the Asian American Student
Association wrote letters to admin
istrators after learning about the
incident, group leaders said.
"We talked to Mary. We all
knew the situation and felt what
happened was wrong and our ini
tial step was to write a letter to
express our disapproval of what
had happened," said AASA chair
Anne Wong, adding that the group
received a response from Gibbons.
BSU co-chair Allyson Dickson
said the group felt a need to initi
ate a dialogue between students
and administrators to encourage
response to the incident.
Gibbons said he hopes to work
with Wu and other students of
color next quarter to create a
forum for discussing racial and
sexual relations within the School
of Engineering.
"We are trying to divide the
issue into two pieces," he said.
"The first one is how to resolve
the personal issue between her
and the professor. The second is
how to bring the issue to the
attention of the faculty so they
could learn from it.
"It's not a single individual
who acts up," Gibbons continued.
"It's an institutional issue, but
it's also not a lot of faculty who do
it. I don't think it's sufficient for
the resolution to be only between
Mary and the professor."
Wu said she sees the forum as a
good means of education. "I think
a forum is a step in trying to
improve race relations and
increase awareness," she said.
A School of Engineering professor who made
racist remarks to a student employee of the Fac
ulty Club has apologized to her, and University
and Faculty Club officials have begun taking ac
tion to insure further incidents do not occur.
No formal action has been taken against the
professor, who has admitted to making insulting
comments to Chinese-American senior Mary
Wu, who works as a waitress at the Faculty Club.
Wu said the incident took place in October
while she was working at the Faculty Club. "A
professor became angry with me because he
thought I had forgotten to given him his order,

but I was not his waitress," she said.
"He called me over and was really upset at
me. Later I went back to clear up the misun
derstanding and offer my apologies," said Wu,
who declined to identify the professor.
"He blew up," she said, adding that he made
remarks including " 'Go back to China,' 'Get
out of my face' and 'You make me sick.'"
When Wu told the professor his remarks were
racist, she said he responded by saying, "Oh yes,
I am so known for being politically correct."
"What he said about being politically correct
really killed me," Wu said. "He was excusing
his behavior by saying he was against being po
litically correct. That is not an excuse for hurt
ing people."

The Faculty Club's board of directors is re
sponding to the incident by writing a letter to
all its members, explaining the University's
harassment policy and the restaurant's desire
to maintain an open and accepting environ
ment for members, their guests and the em
ployees, said board president Marian Adams.
According to Adams, the board will specifi
cally send a letter to the faculty member in
volved. "The Faculty Club board takes this
very seriously and hopes this action will not be
repeated," Adams said. "We have taken action
to insure that it won't."
Wu also said the Faculty Club responded
well to the incident. "I think Mari
an Adams has been kind and shown
sincere concern. I think she has
acted quickly and professionally."
But Wu said the dynamics of
the Faculty Club may have helped
cause the incident.
"Because there are a lot of Chi
nese workers from the mainland
who don't speak English, I am the
one who has had these incidents,"
she said. "I am one of the only
Asian-Americans working there,
and I think the people have
assumed I was from the mainland
and therefore my English wasn't
good enough to understand what
they were saying."
Lynn Enoch, a junior working
as a waitress at the Faculty Club,
said she agreed the language bar
rier was a part of the cause. "The
customers think [the Chinese
workers] can't speak English and
reply," Enoch said.
But she added that she has not
experienced "blatant" racism
despite her African-American and
Vietnamese heritage.
"It's usually just a subtle
thing," she said. "You know
someone's giving you a hard time
(because of race), but they've
never called me nigger."
Another Faculty Club employee,
Mexican-American senior Eric
Schiedler, said he has never experi
enced any racism "personally" but
he attributed that to the fact that
he looks white and doesn't have an
accent when he speaks English.
A quick response
Wu said she also admired the way

the administration handled the
incident. "I do believe they have
handled it very kindly, very pro
fessionally and very promptly, M
she said. "There has been an ade
quate and commendable response
by the administration."
Dean of Engineering James
Gibbons said that once he heard
about the incident he immediate
ly wrote Wu a letter apologizing
on behalf of the School of Engi
neering.
"I also wrote a letter to the pro
fessor. . . attached Mary's letter to
it, and strongly suggested he write
a letter of apology," Gibbons said.
The professor, who is currently
on sabbatical and out of the coun
try, has written a letter of apology to
Wu, according to Gibbons, who also
received a separate letter from him.
"What he said in a separate letter
to me was not different in any sig
nificant way from her description of
the event," Gibbons said. "He does
admit this is unacceptable.
"He attributed it to a bad temper
on the occasion," Gibbons added.
Wu wrote a letter to The Daily
explaining the incident that
appears on today's opinions page.
In addition, she said she plans to
meet with the professor next
quarter because she wants him to
know "how much his action has
affected my life." She added that
she spent the entire quarter
thinking about the incident and
ways to respond to it.
Wu added that she is trying to
handle the whole incident rational
ly. "I think it is so important that
people realize that I am not an
over-reactionist, militant feminist
making a mountain out of a mole
hill. I thought about this," she said.
Provost Gerald Lieberman has
also written a letter of apology to

Wu. One of his assistants said the
provost would not answer ques
tions about the incident because he
was "allowing the Dean (of Engi
neering) free reign in the matter."
