## Faculty Club, School of Engineering work to improve racial atmosphere 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
A School of Engineering professor who made
racist remarks to a student employee of the Fac
ulty Club has apologized to her, and University
and Faculty Club officials have begun taking ac
tion to insure further incidents do not occur.
No formal action has been taken against the
professor, who has admitted to making insulting
comments to Chinese-American senior Mary
Wu, who works as a waitress at the Faculty Club.
Wu said the incident took place in October
while she was working at the Faculty Club. "A
professor became angry with me because he
thought I had forgotten to given him his order,

but I was not his waitress," she said.
"He called me over and was really upset at
me. Later I went back to clear up the misun
derstanding and offer my apologies," said Wu,
who declined to identify the professor.
"He blew up," she said, adding that he made
remarks including " 'Go back to China,' 'Get
out of my face' and 'You make me sick.'"
When Wu told the professor his remarks were
racist, she said he responded by saying, "Oh yes,
I am so known for being politically correct."
"What he said about being politically correct
really killed me," Wu said. "He was excusing
his behavior by saying he was against being po
litically correct. That is not an excuse for hurt
ing people."

The Faculty Club's board of directors is re
sponding to the incident by writing a letter to
all its members, explaining the University's
harassment policy and the restaurant's desire
to maintain an open and accepting environ
ment for members, their guests and the em
ployees, said board president Marian Adams.
According to Adams, the board will specifi
cally send a letter to the faculty member in
volved. "The Faculty Club board takes this
very seriously and hopes this action will not be
repeated," Adams said. "We have taken action
to insure that it won't."
