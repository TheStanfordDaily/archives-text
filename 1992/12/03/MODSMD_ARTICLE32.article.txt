# INTERMISSION
## Beyond 'Cod Nuggets' and 'Carrot Coins'... THE
						STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY 
### 
Co-ops are not
known for clean
liness â€” or tradi
tional fare. But tofu
and one or two eight
legged friends are a
small price to pay for a
savings of at least $700
on your board bill.
They're also yummy. Especial
ly compared to another quarter
of food service walnut loaf and
broccoli frittata.
Resident expert Amy Rees is
one of the best student cooks on
campus. A senior, she caters for
Vice President of Student Affairs
Bob Freelen, planning and cook
ing for occasions as important as
Casper's inauguration ceremony.
After dining at Stanford's eight
co-ops, Rees offers her nonparti
san opinion of their food. She is
joined by three randomly selected
culinary non-experts who know
only that red wine does not go
with Gerber's strained asparagus.
Together, this group has ranked
the co-ops according to cleanli
ness and ambience of eating
areas, variety of menu and taste.
