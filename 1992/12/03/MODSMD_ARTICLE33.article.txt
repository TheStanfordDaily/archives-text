Holiday mischief
in Big Apple: Not
lacking violence

Home Alone 2

Jimmy Stewart never stuck his flaming head
in a toilet bowl full of kerosene.
The Grinch was never hit repeatedly with
bricks.
And no one — ever — shot Bing Crosby in
the crotch with a staple gun.
In fact, no great Christmas movie has ever
been predicated on extreme violence. Well,
maybe "Silent Night, Deadly Night" — but
that doesn't count.
But when director Chris Columbus and
producer John Hughes decided to clone
"Home Alone," they made little Kevin McCal
lister's second Christmas alone into a slapstick
"A Clockwork Orange"-meets-St. Nick. And
they made a big mistake.
Sure, "Home Alone" was the most success
ful comedy ever, in dollars. And Columbus and
Hughes probably have a big money-maker on
their hands with the sequel. But between shots
of cute little Macaulay Culkin inflicting horri
ble injuries on an Oscar-winning actor, the
movie loses a few things: charm, wit, grace,
laughter, humanity, Christmas spirit and soul.
Plotwise, the second "Home Alone" mir
rors the first. The first 20 minutes of the film
are, in fact, almost identical to the original film.
But instead of getting stuck at home by himself
on Christmas, in a radical plot leap, Kevin gets
stuck in New York by himself on Christmas.
Surprisingly enough, the two robbers that
tried to burglarize Kevin's house last Dec. 25
are also in New York, after escaping from
prison. They plan to rob again on Christmas
Eve. But if that's not evil enough, they plan to
rob a toy store. And the toy store plans to give
all of its Christmas Eve earnings — which the
robbers want to swipe — to a children's hospi
tal. Really.
Kevin eventually beats the robbers, reclaims
the stolen money, befriends homeless people
and meets back up with his family.
But a tree and a mother don't make a touch
ing film. The movie's graphic gore is disgust
ing, not entertaining and much too violent for
young kids. If a "horror" movie did half of

what this "comedy" does, it would be rated R.
Indeed, the movie has no genuinely sweet
moments. All it has is an annoying little kid
and too many slapstick injuries.
If you liked the first "Home Alone," you'll
dig this one too —it's the same movie recycled.
But if you want a real Christmas movie, rent
"White Christmas," "How the Grinch Stole
Christmas" or "It's a Wonderful Life."
Happy Holidays.

Houston stalked
by obsessive fan
in her first movie

The Bodyguard

"The Bodyguard" teeters between stretch
ing the boundaries of today's filmmaking and
easily becoming the year's corniest film.
For the first time in a major feature film, a
black actress —Grammy Award-winning
singer Whitney Houston, who plays Rachel
Marron — fills a leading role rather than play
ing the white male hero's bumbling sidekick,
a mammy or a whore.
In Hollywood, where black directors Spike
Lee, Bill Duke and John Singleton share al
most sole responsibility for the film resumes
of hundreds of talented black actors, a box-of
fice success for"The Bodyguard" might open
up roles traditionally reserved for whites. No
political agendas necessary, anyone can apply.
Houston makes her film debut as Marron,
a famous entertainer whose life has been

threatened, seemingly by some lunatic fan.
Enter stage right our beloved hero, Kevin
Costner, to save the day as Marron's new
bodyguard, Frank Farmer.
Farmer, a type-A control freak and"the
best bodyguard in the business," proceeds to
transform Marron's chaotic lifestyle into one
more conducive to protecting her from po
tential harm. During the thankless process of
restructuring Marron's life, Farmer finds
himself attracted to her, and Marron, sensing

this, makes her move.
To expect a movie of this nature to be any
thing more than cheesy is to cheat oneself of
its entertainment value — car chases, one
liners, fight scenes — i.e. cheap thrills.
Yet writer and producer Lawrence Kasdan
("The Big Chill," "Empire Strikes Back")
manages to throw in some classic one-liners
and a few nice touches when character devel
opment and an unlikely plot fail.
Even though Costner — who poorly mim
ics Harrison Ford's performance in "Pre
sumed Innocent" right down to the haircut
— adds little other than good looks to "The
Bodyguard," Houston doesn't accomplish
much more.
Although she shines in her scene at the Os
cars — Houston nervously clutches a call-for
help transmitter, her attention wavering from
the TelePrompTer as she simultaneously
scopes the audience for her potential killer —
her emotions in other vital scenes lack depth
fitting to the tragic situations.
Remember, though, long before setting
foot in the theater, one must cast aside the
tantalizing temptation to analyze, for"The
Bodyguard" was merely meant to be enjoyed.

Soft porn or art?
Cultures meet in
steamy sex flick

The Lover

Southeast Asia is very wet, Tony Leung has
a nice butt and Jane March has a beautiful face.
If any of these attractions motivate you to see
"The Lover," go ahead — you'll be shown
plenty of all three.
Otherwise, and especially if you've read
Marguerite Duras' fine novella, you may find
this adaptation a badly acted piece of soft porn
masquerading as an art movie. And besides,
the porn isn't even that exciting.
The plot is pretty simple. Girl meets man
