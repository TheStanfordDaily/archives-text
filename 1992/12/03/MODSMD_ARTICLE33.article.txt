Holiday mischief
in Big Apple: Not
lacking violence

Home Alone 2

Jimmy Stewart never stuck his flaming head
in a toilet bowl full of kerosene.
The Grinch was never hit repeatedly with
bricks.
And no one — ever — shot Bing Crosby in
the crotch with a staple gun.
In fact, no great Christmas movie has ever
been predicated on extreme violence. Well,
maybe "Silent Night, Deadly Night" — but
that doesn't count.
But when director Chris Columbus and
producer John Hughes decided to clone
"Home Alone," they made little Kevin McCal
lister's second Christmas alone into a slapstick
"A Clockwork Orange"-meets-St. Nick. And
they made a big mistake.
Sure, "Home Alone" was the most success
ful comedy ever, in dollars. And Columbus and
Hughes probably have a big money-maker on
their hands with the sequel. But between shots
of cute little Macaulay Culkin inflicting horri
ble injuries on an Oscar-winning actor, the
movie loses a few things: charm, wit, grace,
laughter, humanity, Christmas spirit and soul.
Plotwise, the second "Home Alone" mir
rors the first. The first 20 minutes of the film
are, in fact, almost identical to the original film.
But instead of getting stuck at home by himself
on Christmas, in a radical plot leap, Kevin gets
stuck in New York by himself on Christmas.
Surprisingly enough, the two robbers that
tried to burglarize Kevin's house last Dec. 25
are also in New York, after escaping from
prison. They plan to rob again on Christmas
Eve. But if that's not evil enough, they plan to
rob a toy store. And the toy store plans to give
all of its Christmas Eve earnings — which the
robbers want to swipe — to a children's hospi
tal. Really.
Kevin eventually beats the robbers, reclaims
the stolen money, befriends homeless people
and meets back up with his family.
But a tree and a mother don't make a touch
ing film. The movie's graphic gore is disgust
ing, not entertaining and much too violent for
young kids. If a "horror" movie did half of

what this "comedy" does, it would be rated R.
Indeed, the movie has no genuinely sweet
moments. All it has is an annoying little kid
and too many slapstick injuries.
If you liked the first "Home Alone," you'll
dig this one too —it's the same movie recycled.
But if you want a real Christmas movie, rent
"White Christmas," "How the Grinch Stole
Christmas" or "It's a Wonderful Life."
Happy Holidays.

Houston stalked
by obsessive fan
in her first movie

The Bodyguard

"The Bodyguard" teeters between stretch
ing the boundaries of today's filmmaking and
easily becoming the year's corniest film.
For the first time in a major feature film, a
black actress —Grammy Award-winning
singer Whitney Houston, who plays Rachel
Marron — fills a leading role rather than play
ing the white male hero's bumbling sidekick,
a mammy or a whore.
In Hollywood, where black directors Spike
Lee, Bill Duke and John Singleton share al
most sole responsibility for the film resumes
of hundreds of talented black actors, a box-of
fice success for"The Bodyguard" might open
up roles traditionally reserved for whites. No
political agendas necessary, anyone can apply.
Houston makes her film debut as Marron,
a famous entertainer whose life has been

threatened, seemingly by some lunatic fan.
Enter stage right our beloved hero, Kevin
Costner, to save the day as Marron's new
bodyguard, Frank Farmer.
Farmer, a type-A control freak and"the
best bodyguard in the business," proceeds to
transform Marron's chaotic lifestyle into one
more conducive to protecting her from po
tential harm. During the thankless process of
restructuring Marron's life, Farmer finds
himself attracted to her, and Marron, sensing

this, makes her move.
To expect a movie of this nature to be any
thing more than cheesy is to cheat oneself of
its entertainment value — car chases, one
liners, fight scenes — i.e. cheap thrills.
Yet writer and producer Lawrence Kasdan
("The Big Chill," "Empire Strikes Back")
manages to throw in some classic one-liners
and a few nice touches when character devel
opment and an unlikely plot fail.
Even though Costner — who poorly mim
ics Harrison Ford's performance in "Pre
sumed Innocent" right down to the haircut
— adds little other than good looks to "The
Bodyguard," Houston doesn't accomplish
much more.
Although she shines in her scene at the Os
cars — Houston nervously clutches a call-for
help transmitter, her attention wavering from
the TelePrompTer as she simultaneously
scopes the audience for her potential killer —
her emotions in other vital scenes lack depth
fitting to the tragic situations.
Remember, though, long before setting
foot in the theater, one must cast aside the
tantalizing temptation to analyze, for"The
Bodyguard" was merely meant to be enjoyed.

Soft porn or art?
Cultures meet in

The Lover

Southeast Asia is very wet, Tony Leung has
a nice butt and Jane March has a beautiful face.
If any of these attractions motivate you to see
"The Lover," go ahead — you'll be shown
plenty of all three.
Otherwise, and especially if you've read
Marguerite Duras' fine novella, you may find
this adaptation a badly acted piece of soft porn
masquerading as an art movie. And besides,
the porn isn't even that exciting.
The plot is pretty simple. Girl meets man

In her screen debut in"The Bodyguard," Whitney Houston plays an actress/singer who
is being stalked by a crazed fan.
— she's young, poor and French, he's older,
rich and Chinese. It's Vietnam in 1929 and
such differences should be enough to make
social chit-chat taboo, let alone sexual inter
course.
They screw anyway. When they're not

of positions) he takes her to some swanky
restaurants, and they stroll through Saigon. At
the end of the movie, the girl is left wondering
if she did it just for the money and the sex, or
if she really loved him.
The book's plot is simple too. But the rea
son Duras won the Prix Goncourt while this
film won't win anything but Best Soft Focus
Cinematography (Naked Flesh Closeup Cate
gory), is that her spare, misty prose gives us the
freedom to imagine what is deliberatr left
undetailed. Onscreen, the characters pear
two-dimensional and undeveloped.
That's something any adaptation would
have problems with, but director Jean-Jacques
Annaud didn't help himselfby casting two un
knowns who look great but deliver dialogue
like unknowns. Never have so many lines
sounded as if they were learned from a script.
The film's husky-voiced narrator, Jeanne
Moreau, adds some of the emotional subtlety
the action sadly lacks. She's also French —
which is what the movie should have been. It's
a French novel, set in a French colony, with a
French main character. The director is French,
as are most of the other actors. Every artistic

reason points to "The Lover" being filmed in
French. But financial reasons won out; English
speakers see more movies. The incongruity
shows. One can only assume that the movie
did well in France because it was subtitled.
Fortunately music transcends language
barriers, and the soundtrack is haunting. The
camerawork, although stunningly beautiful,
becomes a little hollow after awhile if An
naud's magic spell isn't working on you.
This movie is tedious and badly acted. If
you just want something pretty to wash over
your eyes and ears, you might like it Other
wise, depending on which appeals to you: a)
go to Vietnam b) rent a porno or c) read
Duras's novel. Preferably the latter.

Adolescent love:
Rebellious fun in
Australian movie

Flirting

Rural Australia, 1965. An ominous brick
building guards the edge of a lake. Inside,
Danny Embling (Noah Taylor) is lying in a
corner of a dorm room. He and his class
mates have just been spanked by the head
master. His classmates compare the red lines
on their buttocks with flashlights. Then they

notice Danny; they crowd around, pull his
pants down and take a picture. Danny pulls
his pants back up.
Welcome to boarding school.
On the other side of the lake, an equally
guarded red brick fortress houses the girls'
boarding school that Ugandan Thandiwe

Adjewa (Thandic New
ton) attends. Thandiwe is
the only colored girl in the
school and the only one
schooled in England.
Thandiwe is isolated, but
she has a mind of her own
and doesn't care what
anyone thinks.
With two stubborn in
tellectual teenagers, a lake
to separate them, and each
confined to a boarding
school, the film is ripe for a
teen romance to blossom.
What director John
Duigan adds is a solid sense
of humor.
"Flirting," an Australian
film, is the second in
Duigan's planned trilogy
of films. The first film in
the series, "The Year My
Voice Broke," as the title

suggests, covered Danny's pre-teen years.
"Flirting" is funny. Thandiwe and Danny
get involved in near slapstick situations,
stirred by a caricatured headmaster on one
end of the lake, and the revered ringleader
Nicola (Nicole Kidman) on the other.
Danny's narration also adds to the scenes.
His imagination comes to the screen innova
tively with the inclusion of occasional old film
footage, in the style of HBO's "Dream On."
As Danny and Thandiwe try to get to
know each other, the resistance coming from
both their teachers and peers reveals the ba
nality of this "big brother" environment.
Like prisons, the schools punish their de
viant behavior.
Their response is to try to escape, which
draws them together and makes them in
creasingly aware of life outside of the bounds
of school.
As the film turns some stereotypes into
caricatures, and others into characters, the
difference between them is used as a sound
ing board for our perceptions of society. The
film exploits the comic nature of social ritu
al and human behavior.
At times subtle, at other times blatant,
"Flirting" is an entertaining mix of intellec
tual allusions — with ironic underpinnings
— and teen-age ritual.

Holiday mischief
in Big Apple: Not
lacking violence

Home Alone 2

Jimmy Stewart never stuck his flaming head
in a toilet bowl full of kerosene.
The Grinch was never hit repeatedly with
bricks.
And no one — ever — shot Bing Crosby in
the crotch with a staple gun.
In fact, no great Christmas movie has ever
been predicated on extreme violence. Well,
maybe "Silent Night, Deadly Night" — but
that doesn't count.
But when director Chris Columbus and
producer John Hughes decided to clone
"Home Alone," they made little Kevin McCal
lister's second Christmas alone into a slapstick
"A Clockwork Orange"-meets-St. Nick. And
they made a big mistake.
Sure, "Home Alone" was the most success
ful comedy ever, in dollars. And Columbus and
Hughes probably have a big money-maker on
their hands with the sequel. But between shots
of cute little Macaulay Culkin inflicting horri
ble injuries on an Oscar-winning actor, the
movie loses a few things: charm, wit, grace,
laughter, humanity, Christmas spirit and soul.
Plotwise, the second "Home Alone" mir
rors the first. The first 20 minutes of the film
are, in fact, almost identical to the original film.
But instead of getting stuck at home by himself
on Christmas, in a radical plot leap, Kevin gets
stuck in New York by himself on Christmas.
Surprisingly enough, the two robbers that
tried to burglarize Kevin's house last Dec. 25
are also in New York, after escaping from
prison. They plan to rob again on Christmas
Eve. But if that's not evil enough, they plan to
rob a toy store. And the toy store plans to give
all of its Christmas Eve earnings — which the
robbers want to swipe — to a children's hospi
tal. Really.
Kevin eventually beats the robbers, reclaims
the stolen money, befriends homeless people
and meets back up with his family.
But a tree and a mother don't make a touch
ing film. The movie's graphic gore is disgust
ing, not entertaining and much too violent for
young kids. If a "horror" movie did half of

what this "comedy" does, it would be rated R.
Indeed, the movie has no genuinely sweet
moments. All it has is an annoying little kid
and too many slapstick injuries.
If you liked the first "Home Alone," you'll
dig this one too —it's the same movie recycled.
But if you want a real Christmas movie, rent
"White Christmas," "How the Grinch Stole
Christmas" or "It's a Wonderful Life."
Happy Holidays.

Houston stalked
by obsessive fan
in her first movie

The Bodyguard

"The Bodyguard" teeters between stretch
ing the boundaries of today's filmmaking and
easily becoming the year's corniest film.
For the first time in a major feature film, a
black actress —Grammy Award-winning
singer Whitney Houston, who plays Rachel
Marron — fills a leading role rather than play
ing the white male hero's bumbling sidekick,
a mammy or a whore.
In Hollywood, where black directors Spike
Lee, Bill Duke and John Singleton share al
most sole responsibility for the film resumes
of hundreds of talented black actors, a box-of
fice success for"The Bodyguard" might open
up roles traditionally reserved for whites. No
political agendas necessary, anyone can apply.
Houston makes her film debut as Marron,
a famous entertainer whose life has been

threatened, seemingly by some lunatic fan.
Enter stage right our beloved hero, Kevin
Costner, to save the day as Marron's new
bodyguard, Frank Farmer.
Farmer, a type-A control freak and"the
best bodyguard in the business," proceeds to
transform Marron's chaotic lifestyle into one
more conducive to protecting her from po
tential harm. During the thankless process of
restructuring Marron's life, Farmer finds
himself attracted to her, and Marron, sensing

this, makes her move.
To expect a movie of this nature to be any
thing more than cheesy is to cheat oneself of
its entertainment value — car chases, one
liners, fight scenes — i.e. cheap thrills.
Yet writer and producer Lawrence Kasdan
("The Big Chill," "Empire Strikes Back")
manages to throw in some classic one-liners
and a few nice touches when character devel
opment and an unlikely plot fail.
Even though Costner — who poorly mim
ics Harrison Ford's performance in "Pre
sumed Innocent" right down to the haircut
— adds little other than good looks to "The
Bodyguard," Houston doesn't accomplish
much more.
Although she shines in her scene at the Os
cars — Houston nervously clutches a call-for
help transmitter, her attention wavering from
the TelePrompTer as she simultaneously
scopes the audience for her potential killer —
her emotions in other vital scenes lack depth
fitting to the tragic situations.
Remember, though, long before setting
foot in the theater, one must cast aside the
tantalizing temptation to analyze, for"The
Bodyguard" was merely meant to be enjoyed.

The Lover

Southeast Asia is very wet, Tony Leung has

If any of these attractions motivate you to see
"The Lover," go ahead — you'll be shown

Otherwise, and especially if you've read

this adaptation a badly acted piece of soft porn

In her screen debut in"The Bodyguard," Whitney Houston plays an actress/singer who
is being stalked by a crazed fan.
— she's young, poor and French, he's older,
rich and Chinese. It's Vietnam in 1929 and
such differences should be enough to make
social chit-chat taboo, let alone sexual inter

They screw anyway. When they're not

of positions) he takes her to some swanky
restaurants, and they stroll through Saigon. At
the end of the movie, the girl is left wondering
if she did it just for the money and the sex, or
if she really loved him.
The book's plot is simple too. But the rea
son Duras won the Prix Goncourt while this
film won't win anything but Best Soft Focus
Cinematography (Naked Flesh Closeup Cate
gory), is that her spare, misty prose gives us the
freedom to imagine what is deliberatr left
undetailed. Onscreen, the characters pear
two-dimensional and undeveloped.
That's something any adaptation would
have problems with, but director Jean-Jacques
Annaud didn't help himselfby casting two un
knowns who look great but deliver dialogue
like unknowns. Never have so many lines
sounded as if they were learned from a script.
The film's husky-voiced narrator, Jeanne
Moreau, adds some of the emotional subtlety
the action sadly lacks. She's also French —
which is what the movie should have been. It's
a French novel, set in a French colony, with a
French main character. The director is French,

reason points to "The Lover" being filmed in
French. But financial reasons won out; English
speakers see more movies. The incongruity
shows. One can only assume that the movie
did well in France because it was subtitled.
Fortunately music transcends language
barriers, and the soundtrack is haunting. The
camerawork, although stunningly beautiful,
becomes a little hollow after awhile if An
naud's magic spell isn't working on you.
This movie is tedious and badly acted. If
you just want something pretty to wash over
your eyes and ears, you might like it Other
wise, depending on which appeals to you: a)
go to Vietnam b) rent a porno or c) read
Duras's novel. Preferably the latter.

Adolescent love:
Rebellious fun in
Australian movie

Flirting

Rural Australia, 1965. An ominous brick
building guards the edge of a lake. Inside,
Danny Embling (Noah Taylor) is lying in a
corner of a dorm room. He and his class
mates have just been spanked by the head
master. His classmates compare the red lines
on their buttocks with flashlights. Then they

notice Danny; they crowd around, pull his
pants down and take a picture. Danny pulls
his pants back up.
Welcome to boarding school.
On the other side of the lake, an equally
guarded red brick fortress houses the girls'
boarding school that Ugandan Thandiwe

Adjewa (Thandic New
ton) attends. Thandiwe is
the only colored girl in the
school and the only one
schooled in England.
Thandiwe is isolated, but
she has a mind of her own
and doesn't care what
anyone thinks.
With two stubborn in
tellectual teenagers, a lake
to separate them, and each
confined to a boarding
school, the film is ripe for a
teen romance to blossom.
What director John
Duigan adds is a solid sense
of humor.
"Flirting," an Australian
film, is the second in
Duigan's planned trilogy
of films. The first film in
the series, "The Year My
Voice Broke," as the title

suggests, covered Danny's pre-teen years.
"Flirting" is funny. Thandiwe and Danny
get involved in near slapstick situations,
stirred by a caricatured headmaster on one
end of the lake, and the revered ringleader

Danny Embling (Noah Taylor) is lying in a
corner of a dorm room. He and his class
mates have just been spanked by the head
master. His classmates compare the red lines
on their buttocks with flashlights. Then they

notice Danny; they crowd around, pull his
pants down and take a picture. Danny pulls
his pants back up.
Welcome to boarding school.
On the other side of the lake, an equally
guarded red brick fortress houses the girls'
boarding school that Ugandan Thandiwe

Adjewa (Thandic New
ton) attends. Thandiwe is
the only colored girl in the
school and the only one
schooled in England.
Thandiwe is isolated, but
she has a mind of her own
and doesn't care what
anyone thinks.
With two stubborn in
tellectual teenagers, a lake
to separate them, and each
confined to a boarding
school, the film is ripe for a
teen romance to blossom.
What director John
Duigan adds is a solid sense
of humor.
"Flirting," an Australian
film, is the second in
Duigan's planned trilogy
of films. The first film in
the series, "The Year My
Voice Broke," as the title

suggests, covered Danny's pre-teen years.
"Flirting" is funny. Thandiwe and Danny
get involved in near slapstick situations,
stirred by a caricatured headmaster on one
end of the lake, and the revered ringleader
Nicola (Nicole Kidman) on the other.
Danny's narration also adds to the scenes.
His imagination comes to the screen innova
tively with the inclusion of occasional old film
footage, in the style of HBO's "Dream On."
As Danny and Thandiwe try to get to
know each other, the resistance coming from
both their teachers and peers reveals the ba
nality of this "big brother" environment.
Like prisons, the schools punish their de
viant behavior.
Their response is to try to escape, which
draws them together and makes them in
creasingly aware of life outside of the bounds
of school.
As the film turns some stereotypes into
caricatures, and others into characters, the
difference between them is used as a sound
ing board for our perceptions of society. The
film exploits the comic nature of social ritu
al and human behavior.
At times subtle, at other times blatant,
"Flirting" is an entertaining mix of intellec
tual allusions — with ironic underpinnings
— and teen-age ritual.

Holiday mischief
in Big Apple: Not
lacking violence

Home Alone 2

Jimmy Stewart never stuck his flaming head
in a toilet bowl full of kerosene.
The Grinch was never hit repeatedly with
bricks.
And no one — ever — shot Bing Crosby in
the crotch with a staple gun.
In fact, no great Christmas movie has ever
been predicated on extreme violence. Well,
maybe "Silent Night, Deadly Night" — but
that doesn't count.
But when director Chris Columbus and
producer John Hughes decided to clone
"Home Alone," they made little Kevin McCal
lister's second Christmas alone into a slapstick
"A Clockwork Orange"-meets-St. Nick. And
they made a big mistake.
Sure, "Home Alone" was the most success
ful comedy ever, in dollars. And Columbus and
Hughes probably have a big money-maker on
their hands with the sequel. But between shots
of cute little Macaulay Culkin inflicting horri
ble injuries on an Oscar-winning actor, the
movie loses a few things: charm, wit, grace,
laughter, humanity, Christmas spirit and soul.
Plotwise, the second "Home Alone" mir
rors the first. The first 20 minutes of the film
are, in fact, almost identical to the original film.
But instead of getting stuck at home by himself
on Christmas, in a radical plot leap, Kevin gets
stuck in New York by himself on Christmas.
Surprisingly enough, the two robbers that
tried to burglarize Kevin's house last Dec. 25
are also in New York, after escaping from
prison. They plan to rob again on Christmas
Eve. But if that's not evil enough, they plan to
rob a toy store. And the toy store plans to give
all of its Christmas Eve earnings — which the
robbers want to swipe — to a children's hospi
tal. Really.
Kevin eventually beats the robbers, reclaims
the stolen money, befriends homeless people
and meets back up with his family.
But a tree and a mother don't make a touch
ing film. The movie's graphic gore is disgust
ing, not entertaining and much too violent for
young kids. If a "horror" movie did half of

what this "comedy" does, it would be rated R.
Indeed, the movie has no genuinely sweet
moments. All it has is an annoying little kid
and too many slapstick injuries.
If you liked the first "Home Alone," you'll
dig this one too —it's the same movie recycled.
But if you want a real Christmas movie, rent
"White Christmas," "How the Grinch Stole
Christmas" or "It's a Wonderful Life."
Happy Holidays.

Houston stalked
by obsessive fan
in her first movie

The Bodyguard

"The Bodyguard" teeters between stretch
ing the boundaries of today's filmmaking and
easily becoming the year's corniest film.
For the first time in a major feature film, a
black actress —Grammy Award-winning
singer Whitney Houston, who plays Rachel
Marron — fills a leading role rather than play
ing the white male hero's bumbling sidekick,
a mammy or a whore.
In Hollywood, where black directors Spike
Lee, Bill Duke and John Singleton share al
most sole responsibility for the film resumes
of hundreds of talented black actors, a box-of
fice success for"The Bodyguard" might open
up roles traditionally reserved for whites. No
political agendas necessary, anyone can apply.
Houston makes her film debut as Marron,
a famous entertainer whose life has been

threatened, seemingly by some lunatic fan.
Enter stage right our beloved hero, Kevin
Costner, to save the day as Marron's new
bodyguard, Frank Farmer.
Farmer, a type-A control freak and"the
best bodyguard in the business," proceeds to
transform Marron's chaotic lifestyle into one
more conducive to protecting her from po
tential harm. During the thankless process of
restructuring Marron's life, Farmer finds
himself attracted to her, and Marron, sensing

this, makes her move.
To expect a movie of this nature to be any
thing more than cheesy is to cheat oneself of
its entertainment value — car chases, one
liners, fight scenes — i.e. cheap thrills.
Yet writer and producer Lawrence Kasdan
("The Big Chill," "Empire Strikes Back")
manages to throw in some classic one-liners
and a few nice touches when character devel
opment and an unlikely plot fail.
Even though Costner — who poorly mim
ics Harrison Ford's performance in "Pre
sumed Innocent" right down to the haircut
— adds little other than good looks to "The
Bodyguard," Houston doesn't accomplish
much more.
Although she shines in her scene at the Os
cars — Houston nervously clutches a call-for
help transmitter, her attention wavering from
the TelePrompTer as she simultaneously
scopes the audience for her potential killer —
her emotions in other vital scenes lack depth
fitting to the tragic situations.
Remember, though, long before setting
foot in the theater, one must cast aside the
tantalizing temptation to analyze, for"The
Bodyguard" was merely meant to be enjoyed.

Soft porn or art?
Cultures meet in
steamy sex flick

The Lover

Southeast Asia is very wet, Tony Leung has
a nice butt and Jane March has a beautiful face.
If any of these attractions motivate you to see
"The Lover," go ahead — you'll be shown
plenty of all three.
Otherwise, and especially if you've read
Marguerite Duras' fine novella, you may find
this adaptation a badly acted piece of soft porn
masquerading as an art movie. And besides,
the porn isn't even that exciting.
The plot is pretty simple. Girl meets man

In her screen debut in"The Bodyguard," Whitney Houston plays an actress/singer who
is being stalked by a crazed fan.
— she's young, poor and French, he's older,
rich and Chinese. It's Vietnam in 1929 and
such differences should be enough to make
social chit-chat taboo, let alone sexual inter
course.
They screw anyway. When they're not
screwing (in a disappointingly limited range
of positions) he takes her to some swanky
restaurants, and they stroll through Saigon. At
the end of the movie, the girl is left wondering
if she did it just for the money and the sex, or
if she really loved him.
The book's plot is simple too. But the rea
son Duras won the Prix Goncourt while this
film won't win anything but Best Soft Focus
Cinematography (Naked Flesh Closeup Cate
gory), is that her spare, misty prose gives us the
freedom to imagine what is deliberatr left
undetailed. Onscreen, the characters pear
two-dimensional and undeveloped.
That's something any adaptation would
have problems with, but director Jean-Jacques
Annaud didn't help himselfby casting two un
knowns who look great but deliver dialogue
like unknowns. Never have so many lines
sounded as if they were learned from a script.
The film's husky-voiced narrator, Jeanne
Moreau, adds some of the emotional subtlety
the action sadly lacks. She's also French —
which is what the movie should have been. It's
a French novel, set in a French colony, with a
French main character. The director is French,
as are most of the other actors. Every artistic

reason points to "The Lover" being filmed in
French. But financial reasons won out; English
speakers see more movies. The incongruity
shows. One can only assume that the movie
did well in France because it was subtitled.
Fortunately music transcends language
barriers, and the soundtrack is haunting. The
camerawork, although stunningly beautiful,
becomes a little hollow after awhile if An
naud's magic spell isn't working on you.
This movie is tedious and badly acted. If
you just want something pretty to wash over
your eyes and ears, you might like it Other
wise, depending on which appeals to you: a)
go to Vietnam b) rent a porno or c) read
Duras's novel. Preferably the latter.
