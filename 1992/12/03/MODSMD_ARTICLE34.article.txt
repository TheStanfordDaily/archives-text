Grunge legend's
re-release rocks —
too loud and fast

Mother Love Bone

In the world of grunge. Mother Love Bone
has become something of a legend. But like
most legends, the reality of the music is
sometimes less than the legend itself. Moth
er I.ove Bone is a really good band, but not all
their songs reach the caliber of the Seattle
elite.
After lead singer Andrew Wood's heroin
overdose a couple of years ago, Mother Love
Bone disbanded, prompting bassist Jeff

Ament and guitarist Stone Gossard to move
on to form the highly successful Pearl Jam.
Wood's death rattled the Seattle rock
community and inspired members of Pearl
Jam and Soundgarden to record a tribute
album, "Temple of the Dog." The album's
most frequently played song, "Hunger
Strike," brought exposure to the defunct
band.
The renewed interest in Mother Love
Bone and the success of the Seattle scene has
resulted in the re-release of MLB's "Shine"
EP and "Apple" album on one eponymously
titled CD. Also included is a two-song bonus
CD of "Lady Godiva Blues" and an alternate
version of "Capricorn Sister," which appears
on the full-length CD.
It's a lot of music for your buck, but it
doesn't always achieve the originality or
catchiness of MLB successor Pearl Jam or
other grunge kings: Nirvana, Soundgarden,

Alice in Chains, etc.
Filmmaker Cameron Crowe was correct
in choosing "Chloe Dancer/ Crown of
Thorns" as the best song to represent MLB in
his movie "Singles." On the movie sound
track, it stands out among some fantastic
songs from the aforementioned bands.
On the Mother Love Bone album, this
track and the shorter version, "Crown of
Thorns," are the only songs that really grab
you on the first listen. The beautiful
acoustic-guitar progression and electric-gui
tar textures are a perfect backdrop for
Wood's simple piano and unique vocal style.
In general, the slow songs like "Crown of
Thorns," "Stargazer," "Man of Golden
Words" and "Gentle Groove" are the
stronger cuts.
Most of the album is comprised of hard-
rocking songs though. While the
energy of these tracks implies that
MLB must have been impressive in
concert, a few of them sound like
second rate "Appetite for Destruc
tion"-era Guns and Roses. They're
replete with cock-rock posturing
lyrics and derivative guitar riffs.
But there are also several tracks

— like the opener, "This is
Shangrila" — that build solid
grooves around swirling guitars
and tight ensemble-playing remi
niscent of Pearl Jam.
With this much music there can
afford to be a couple of duds. Fans
of grunge will benefit from adding
Mother Love Bone to their collec
tion. But it's hard to deny that the
surviving band members have
moved on to bigger and somewhat
better things.
