Kairos

1 pot vegetable Idchadi and sambar
1 pot mushy rice
baked pears for dessert
fresh juice from machine
Cook of the night: Sri Kantha Sola, senior.
Eating Areas: Clean, well lit, with nice
long tables and interesting walls. Three
Egyptian murals fit in well with the theme
of the house, but the point of the ill-fitting
football mural is a topic of heated dispute.
Variety: Entree variety is notably lack
ing. But a slight compensation is the excel
lent beverage choice and plentiful supply
of fresh fruit. Kairos is one of the few
houses on the Row with fresh fruit juice
(not "fruit drink") available at every meal.
Taste: Nothing special. For a veg
etable dish, the bland kichadi and sambar
fit the fears of carnivores. Dessert made
up for it, though.
Phallic Bread: Seems to be an
unheard of phenomenon among the
house members, but it does exist. With
bread night once a week, it is only a mat
ter of time before the right cook decides
to resurface last year's quasi-tradition.
Serves 30, plus 4 EAs.
Non-expert: "It's a pity that the food did
not reflect the charm of the house itself."
Expert: "I do think it's admirable that
they are willing to experiment with Indian
food, because it can be kind of tricky."

Enchanted
Broccoli Forest

1 jar of home-cured olives picked from
Stanford olive trees
1 pot rice with mint leaves and tofu

1 tray baked spaghetti squash and egg
plant
1 pot tofu rice
1 large pot spicy tomato soup with egg
plant and zucchini
oatmeal cookies
4 varieties of juice drink
Head Cook: anonymous
Eating areas: This is what college is
supposed to be like. Beat-up oak chairs,
pool table, dart-board, random signs
("Veggie Territory: flesh free"), and upbeat
hashing music give the place an anti-estab
lishment feel. Visitors may sense a hurried
and somewhat unwelcoming mood. Expert
Amy Rees said, "Someone gave me the dirti
est look when I didn't compost."
EBF is one of the few co-ops that boasts
of a common set of silverware, cups and
dishes. Napkins are notably missing, though.
Variety: All-vegan or vegetarian, which
is only natural for a house named after a
vegetarian cookbook. Random variety-type
jobs abound, such as granola-maker, beer
brewer and "tofu-tempter." Fruit is readily
available, including persimmons.
Taste: A wide variety of complement
ing flavors contrast to the other random
clashes found within some co-ops.
There's plenty of tofu in each dish, and
occasionally some hot peppers too.
Antidisestablishmentarianism: This is
EBF, and hammer and sickles can be
found next to pictures of the earth. Pot
lids called "pot heads" and "make your
own" pool tournament rules are testa
ments to the theme of this house.
Serves 51, plus 1 EA.
Non-expert: "Hey, it's weird, but whatev
er works."
Expert: "The soup was good, but it was a
little dangerous to leave the peppers in
there whole. I still feel a little guilty about
the compost thing."

Chi Theta Chi

2 pots tomato-potato-basil soup
1 bowl of freshly chopped basil
1 large freshly tossed salad
1 steaming tin of the most awesome
cornbread in the world
4 varieties of salad dressings
1 pan sweet-potato/carrot pancakes
1 bowl of sliced kiwis

2 types of juices in pitchers
Head Cook: Robin Jones, sophomore.
Eating areas: Clean and well-lit,
although a bit noisy at times, which
makes conversation difficult. Bring
a sweater to dinner during the
winter months, because it can get
cold. Another option is to dine in
the library by candlelight, in
front of a roaring fire.
Variety: Ethnic nights are
enhanced by a plentiful supply of
fresh produce of all types, including
soy beans, prunes and home-grown
herbs such as catnip and dill. Meat is
served on a regular basis, and there
is always a vegetarian alternative. Chi
Theta Chi is also one of the few hous
es that cooks fish.
The great variety of bev
erages includes bottled milk, l ' j
fresh juices, Alhambra water jv
and soft drinks from a
machine.
Taste: Ranges from flavorful to bland.
The cooks think their meals out well-ahead
of time with great imagination. If the
entree isn't too tasty, there are plenty of
side dishes.
Cuteness: Most students take
part in nightly post-dinner coffee
making from fresh-ground
gourmet coffee beans, and weekend kiwi
picking excursions. Safety goggles can be
found strapped near the kitchen entrance,
and above the doorjamb are some random
figurines attacking Humpty-Dumpty. One
anonymous student says, "You guys are
just the cutest house."
Serves 29, plus 7 EAs.
Non-expert: "If I ever were to eat
in a Greek house, it would be Chi
Theta Chi."
Expert: "The romantic library thing really
won my heart, but I'm a little worried
about what they do with the catnip. They
could have used some of those home
grown herbs in the soup to jazz it up a bit.'

Columbae

1 batch of tortillas
1 pot of pinto and black beans
1 pot of Spanish and white rice
1 bowl of homemade guacamole

Head Cook for the night: Eric Johnson,
graduate.
Eating areas: Although the dining room
is well-lit, the gregarious folks of Columbae
prefer eating as a large, indistinguishable
clump on their porch, or, when the weather
starts getting rough, in the darker, more
comfortable lounging areas throughout the
house. The murals are almost as random as
the cutlery, which are kept in one large
drawer in admirable diversity.
Variety: If you are a vegan or vegetarian,
Columbae is the place for you. Head cook
Eric Johnson stood up and announced, "For
people who will be here for Thanksgiving, 1
thought we could get a turkey and cook it,
you know. Well, you wouldn't have to eat it."
The nightly liquid concoction ranges from
daiquiris to Kool-Aid.
Taste: Sophomore Abe Newman states
that he hasn't had one meal at Columbae
that he didn't like. The Spanish rice and
homemade guacamole were good, but not










fresh tomatoes
blended margaritas
