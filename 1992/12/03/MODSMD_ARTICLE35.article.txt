efforts: The more
'shrooms the better.

Kairos

1 pot vegetable Idchadi and sambar
1 pot mushy rice
baked pears for dessert
fresh juice from machine
Cook of the night: Sri Kantha Sola, senior.
Eating Areas: Clean, well lit, with nice
long tables and interesting walls. Three
Egyptian murals fit in well with the theme
of the house, but the point of the ill-fitting
football mural is a topic of heated dispute.
Variety: Entree variety is notably lack
ing. But a slight compensation is the excel
lent beverage choice and plentiful supply
of fresh fruit. Kairos is one of the few
houses on the Row with fresh fruit juice
(not "fruit drink") available at every meal.
Taste: Nothing special. For a veg
etable dish, the bland kichadi and sambar
fit the fears of carnivores. Dessert made
up for it, though.
Phallic Bread: Seems to be an
unheard of phenomenon among the
house members, but it does exist. With
bread night once a week, it is only a mat
ter of time before the right cook decides
to resurface last year's quasi-tradition.
Serves 30, plus 4 EAs.
Non-expert: "It's a pity that the food did
not reflect the charm of the house itself."
Expert: "I do think it's admirable that
they are willing to experiment with Indian
food, because it can be kind of tricky."

Enchanted
Broccoli Forest

1 jar of home-cured olives picked from
Stanford olive trees
1 pot rice with mint leaves and tofu

1 tray baked spaghetti squash and egg
plant
1 pot tofu rice
1 large pot spicy tomato soup with egg
plant and zucchini
oatmeal cookies
4 varieties of juice drink
Head Cook: anonymous
Eating areas: This is what college is
supposed to be like. Beat-up oak chairs,
pool table, dart-board, random signs
("Veggie Territory: flesh free"), and upbeat
hashing music give the place an anti-estab
lishment feel. Visitors may sense a hurried
and somewhat unwelcoming mood. Expert
Amy Rees said, "Someone gave me the dirti
est look when I didn't compost."
EBF is one of the few co-ops that boasts
of a common set of silverware, cups and
dishes. Napkins are notably missing, though.
Variety: All-vegan or vegetarian, which
is only natural for a house named after a
vegetarian cookbook. Random variety-type
jobs abound, such as granola-maker, beer
brewer and "tofu-tempter." Fruit is readily
available, including persimmons.
Taste: A wide variety of complement
ing flavors contrast to the other random
clashes found within some co-ops.
There's plenty of tofu in each dish, and
occasionally some hot peppers too.
Antidisestablishmentarianism: This is
EBF, and hammer and sickles can be
found next to pictures of the earth. Pot
lids called "pot heads" and "make your
own" pool tournament rules are testa
ments to the theme of this house.
Serves 51, plus 1 EA.
Non-expert: "Hey, it's weird, but whatev
er works."
Expert: "The soup was good, but it was a
little dangerous to leave the peppers in
there whole. I still feel a little guilty about
the compost thing."

Chi Theta Chi

2 pots tomato-potato-basil soup
1 bowl of freshly chopped basil
1 large freshly tossed salad
1 steaming tin of the most awesome
cornbread in the world
4 varieties of salad dressings
1 pan sweet-potato/carrot pancakes
1 bowl of sliced kiwis

2 types of juices in pitchers
Head Cook: Robin Jones, sophomore.
Eating areas: Clean and well-lit,
although a bit noisy at times, which
makes conversation difficult. Bring
a sweater to dinner during the
winter months, because it can get
cold. Another option is to dine in
the library by candlelight, in
front of a roaring fire.
Variety: Ethnic nights are
enhanced by a plentiful supply of
fresh produce of all types, including
soy beans, prunes and home-grown
herbs such as catnip and dill. Meat is
served on a regular basis, and there
is always a vegetarian alternative. Chi
Theta Chi is also one of the few hous
es that cooks fish.
The great variety of bev
erages includes bottled milk, l ' j
fresh juices, Alhambra water jv
and soft drinks from a
machine.
Taste: Ranges from flavorful to bland.
The cooks think their meals out well-ahead
of time with great imagination. If the
entree isn't too tasty, there are plenty of
side dishes.
Cuteness: Most students take
part in nightly post-dinner coffee
making from fresh-ground
gourmet coffee beans, and weekend kiwi
picking excursions. Safety goggles can be
found strapped near the kitchen entrance,
and above the doorjamb are some random
figurines attacking Humpty-Dumpty. One
anonymous student says, "You guys are
just the cutest house."
Serves 29, plus 7 EAs.
Non-expert: "If I ever were to eat
in a Greek house, it would be Chi
Theta Chi."
Expert: "The romantic library thing really
won my heart, but I'm a little worried
about what they do with the catnip. They
could have used some of those home
grown herbs in the soup to jazz it up a bit.'

Columbae

1 batch of tortillas
1 pot of pinto and black beans
1 pot of Spanish and white rice
1 bowl of homemade guacamole

Head Cook for the night: Eric Johnson,
graduate.
Eating areas: Although the dining room
is well-lit, the gregarious folks of Columbae
prefer eating as a large, indistinguishable
clump on their porch, or, when the weather
starts getting rough, in the darker, more
comfortable lounging areas throughout the
house. The murals are almost as random as
the cutlery, which are kept in one large
drawer in admirable diversity.
Variety: If you are a vegan or vegetarian,
Columbae is the place for you. Head cook
Eric Johnson stood up and announced, "For
people who will be here for Thanksgiving, 1
thought we could get a turkey and cook it,
you know. Well, you wouldn't have to eat it."
The nightly liquid concoction ranges from
daiquiris to Kool-Aid.
Taste: Sophomore Abe Newman states
that he hasn't had one meal at Columbae
that he didn't like. The Spanish rice and
homemade guacamole were good, but not










fresh tomatoes
blended margaritas
great. The food was definitely better than
Kairos, but it lacked flare.
The mural table: "It's, um, interesting,"
says one of the non-experts. In fact, the ran
dom assortment of vivid colors has a practi
cal purpose: camouflaging crumbs.
Serves 45, plus 20 EAs.
Non-expert: "Living proof that even gra
nola-houses can produce great food."
Expert: "The murals were colorful and
bright, but I can't remember what they
showed. I was pretty into the yummy home
made guacamole."

Terra

1 large tin of corn and beans with toma
toes
5 quarts of black beans, plain
5 quarts of black beans with spices and
other stuff
1 tray of heated tortillas
1 tray of sweet potatoes
1 excellent fruit salad
1 beat-up bowl of dark purple punch of
sorts
"Clown" (traditional Terra term for cook):
Jessie Levine, sophomore.
Eating areas: Terra's dining room has a
"no-bones about it" motif. Random punch
in a bowl and creative serving utensils could
be a turnoff if you are picky. Regardless, the
eating areas are open, friendly and fairly
clean. Clashing murals, long wooden tables,
glow in the dark Elvira cups and polka-dot
plates add an interesting touch to the
already relaxed atmosphere.
Variety: From soy milk to fresh fruit to
red meat, Terra has it all. There is always at
least one vegetarian or vegan entree, and
meat is served regularly as well.
Taste: "The very first meal 1 ate at Terra
was the first entree I've eaten at Stanford,"
says senior Amanda Hashfield. "The food
at Terra is definitely not raunchy Food
Service slop," says expert Amy Rees.
Terra's bread: Terra is known for its
bread throughout the entire universe and
Stanford, and senior Dan Cory is known
throughout Terra as the Breadmeister.
Although there is a bread-dough kneader on
the Hobart machine, Cory chooses to use his
hands. When asked why his bread tastes so
good, he replies, "The force from everyone
in the kitchen just flows through my hands."
Serves 54, plus 25 EAs.
Non-expert: "Good show, Bozo!"
Expert: "The very energetic crowd made the
dinner taste even better, and I'm still in awe of

the Breadmeister. I sure wish we could
have come back at midnight for
some nibbles."

Synergy

1 bowl of tasty homemade corn chips
1 big platter of enchiladas
1 large pot of Spanish rice
1 large bowl of fresh fruit salad in
coconut milk
water
Head Cook for the night: Senior, John
Abroneit.

Eating areas: Perhaps the only down
fall of Synergy's food is the cleanliness of
the eating areas, or lack thereof. Shirts
work for napkins, and glassware is
sketchy. There is a kitchen table to eat on
as a last resort, but most prefer the com
fortable couches in the living room.
Variety: Although the food is all vege
tarian and vegan, nightly entree variety is
high. Synergy is stocked with organically
grown fresh fruit bought in bulk from
local businesses. Although water is the
only drink, you can pay 35 cents for soda.
The food is amazingly healthy.
Taste: Simply put by sophomore Dee
Bourbon, "1 have died and gone to veggie
heaven." Adequate usage of spices livens
up the dishes, and although the food is
sometimes hot enough to cause internal
meltdown, it sure beats the boring cous
cous with tomato paste that Food Service
hails as a vegetarian alternative. Bourbon
dreams of some day replacing Food
Service with Synergy Service.
Naked hashing: Perhaps the most fun
one could ever have in the kitchen is dur
ing Synergy's naked ("clothing optional"
if you prefer) hash. Bagel baking and
donut making in the flesh.
Serves 30, plus 10 EAs.
Non-expert: "The puppy was cute. It
tasted like.... chicken."
Expert: "Though I'm not willing to
embrace veggie alternatives for the rest of
my life, the cheese enchiladas were tasty .
.. the rice was pretty crunchy."

Hammarskjold

1 massive pot of garbanzo bean and
chickpea curry
1 spicy steaming pot of "Pat's fire-tofu"
1 wimpy pot of "Pat's fire-tofu"
1 pot of perfectly done white rice
1 bowl of twisty noodles in pesto sauce
1 small container of homemade pesto
sauce
1 bowl o' lemonade with ladle
Head cook for the night: senior, Mark
Burns.
Eating areas: More like a high school
cafeteria than a college dining hall.
Fluorescent lights cast a gnarly yellowish
tinge on white plastic tables and make the
vinyl chairs glow like Tang. Not a very
comfortable or relaxed place to eat.
However, Hammarskjtild's kitchen is one
of the cleanest on the row.
Variety: You want it, HammarskjOld's
got it. As one student puts it, "We have so
much variety that nothing is really dis
tinctive." Vegetarian entrees are always
present, and a meat dish is served every
other night.
Hammarsjktild has the most exten
sive spice collection in Stanford's co-op
community, and they make use of it,
sometimes to the extreme. Pasta with
pesto sauce does not mesh with fire tofu,
and polishing off each fiery dinner with
an ice cream dessert has got to do some
thing to your taste-buds.
Taste: "Damn near always possibly
great," says grad student Rushton Harley.
He's right, too. The food is so delicious
that one student living in Roble chooses
to EA at HammarsjkOld and pays for both
meal plans.
Spice tea at midnight: Pseudo-tradi
tion or caffeine addiction? Homemade
spice tea with real ginger and cinnamon is
quite a kick.
Serves 23, plus 25 EAs.
Non-expert: "Hammarskjold cuisine:
definitely one the best parts of multicul
turalism."

Expert: "I'm
very impressed by the way they
take tofu out of its bland milky state and
fire it up, and the spice tea gets an A for
comfortability and homemade creativity."

Kosher Co-op

1 tray of sweet and sour chicken
1 bowl of tabouli salad
1 pot of pureed squash
corn on the cob
chocolate cake
soda and lemonade
Head Cook: Shira Wohlberg, graduate, and
others.
Eating areas: The Kosher co-op eats
in Elliot Program Center nightly at 6 p.m.,
offering a clean and completely kosher
kitchen. Members of the co-op are very
friendly, and the atmosphere is homey.
Variety: From meat to vegetarian, the
Kosher co-op has it all — and it's always
kosher. Variety depends largely on the
number of members currently in the co
op. Fresh fruit is available.
Taste: Want a home-cooked meal? The
Kosher co-op's size creates an environment
that is far from institutional. Some excep
tional cooks can be found in the co-op.
Information: The Kosher co-op's size
varies from six to 14 people, and therefore
is relatively unheard of among Stanford
students. Food Service does allow kosher
students to forego their meal plan if they
must eat at the co-op for religious rea
sons. For more information on the co-op,
please call Shira Wohlberg at 497-7958.
Serves 6 to 14, according to season.
Non-expert: "Too bad one has to be Jewish
to get out of Food Service to eat here."
Expert: "It is a huge advantage to have so
few people there, because it provides a
good escape from the dorm rush, and
they can cater to your finicky taste."
