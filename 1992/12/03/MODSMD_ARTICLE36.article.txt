# Stress relief
## Before you lose your head 
### Alex Wiesen Staff writer 
"Back off man."
Do you say this often? When you eat, do
you leave bite marks in your fork? Do you
accidentally open your Kryptonite
10ck... without your key? These could all
be signs that you are stricken with a surpris
ing yet common burden of being one of the
many stressed students at Stanford.
With Dead Week approaching, you'll fi
nally have to face up to the inevitable
avalanche of work that will appear like dirty
laundry tumbling from your closet. After all,
friends are nice things to have—especially if
they Hve a car — so don't turn off everyone
you know by being irritable. If you're a clos
et stresser, rejoice in the fact that unsightly
habits like nail-biting or hair-tugging are
not the only ways to relieve stress.

Suggestion one: Hot and wet
Its 3 a.m. and you need to stay awake

Most students would get some coffee

at this point, but when caffeine

isn't the answer, why not head for

some hot, delicious herbal tea?

Of particular interest

might be Sun Rider tea,

which is some-

times used by
hospital

graveyard
shift phar
macists
who need
to stay
awake
without

getting jit-

tery. It can you
from acciden-

tally reading the

same sentence five
times in a row.

Suggestion two: Sweaty
and hard

Sometimes pure physi
cal exertion is the cure for
stress relief. "I hit people"

confesses one student.
"I like the gym, with its sweaty crowds
and people who'll make sure you lift lots of
weight," confides a stressed sophomore.
Perhaps it's just primeval how we feel
better after doing some down-to-earth hard
work.
Suggestion three: Quiet and personal
Campus organizations such as the
Bridge and Cowell Student Health Center
offer psychological support for students on
the verge of a nervous breakdown. In addi
tion, roving bands of Bridge folk can be
found in the dorms giving free massage
workshops.

Suggestion four: Loud and fast
Nine Inch Nails, Pantera — music
soothes the savage beast. "I like to listen to
angry music and storm around," explains
one freshman.
But respect thy neighbor. Not everyone
wants their ears to bleed. "You know, this
one guy in my dorm always plays his stereo
really loud. It really stresses me out," anoth
er student confides.
Very few students listen to yodels, to the
great dismay of the Bookstore music de
partment.

Suggestion five: Pushing the right buttons
Whether it's at the Tresiddcr recreation cen
ter or in the quiet of the dorm computer clus
ter, video games provide stressed students with
another outlet for their angst. "Not only does
Street Fighter II make me forget about my

work, but I get to really beat up other peo-

ple, and that makes me feel better," says

one student. No longer a mere

forum for displaying the incredi-

bly useful ability of hand-eye

coordination, video games

are just another way to

kick back and relax

Suggestion six:

Other methods

Raiding the re
frigerator, mak
ing crank calls
and watching
"Star Trek," are
other de
stressers.
One sophomore

admits, "When I

get stressed, I bitch

about men," though she

later explains that she enjoys

playing the piano to actually
relax. And an employee at Ye Olde
Safer Sex Shoppe said that sales
usually triple during Dead Week.
So the next time you can
focus your gaze to a single point
and shatter a mirror, try a few of
these methods to make your
self human again. Or else.
