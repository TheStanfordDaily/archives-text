## 
### Elisabeth Witchel Staff writer 
If you thought Big Game capped off
your sports season, then make way for
Theatresports, featuring the Stanford Im
provisors.
The Stanford Improvisors will present
three performances this week. At Thurs
day's show, the SIMPS will battle an im
prov group from Bay Area Theatresports
for the most laughs — and for the tradi
tional baseball bat/rubber chicken trophy
which has gone back and forth between
the two groups since the SIMPS formed a
year and a half ago.
But according to SIMPS member, se
nior Jonathan Green, "The SIMPS do not
emphasize competition... .The audience
should root for both teams, and the
judges are the bad guys."
Friday and Saturday will feature SI M PS
against SIMPS. Splitting up into teams,
members will be asked to improvise vari
ous situations, "often with physical and
verbal restrictions" said senior Adam
Tobin.
There will be an emcee to lay down the
rules, but the show will hardly be pre
dictable. "One can't be sure because it's
improvised," Tobin said. "We try to in
volve the audience as much as possible."
Preparing for this weekend's perfor
mances, the SIMPS have been"in train
ing," doing extensive improvisational
games, scrimmages and "raising the ener
gy level of the group," said coordinator
and senior drama lecturer Patricia Ryan.
The SIMPS were founded in response
to student interest in Ryan's advanced im
prov class. Students wanted to go a step
further, Ryan said. Since then the group
has gone on to several improv tourna
ments including the International The
atresports Festival in San Francisco earli
er this fall.
The SIMPS also performed at Casper's
inauguration celebration, and taught im
provisation workshops in Murray, Faisan
and Kimball dorms. Many members also
performed in the recent production of
"The Canterbury Tales."

The SIMPS' performances will be held Dec.
3 through 5 at 8 p.m. in the Little Theater.
