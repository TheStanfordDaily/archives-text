# 'Exposure' examines beauty myth

### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
A woman walks across the stage
carrying two large boxes with dif
ficulty. They slip in her arms and
make her stumble. She puts them
on the floor and attempts to bal
ance herself on them, but ends up
falling.
According to the performer,
sophomore Caroline Laskow, the
act shows "visually, how it feels to
have an eating disorder."
Laskow's piece is one of 16 per
formances making up "Total Ex
posure," an original show present
ed by 12 members of the Women's
Performance Collective in the
Nitery Theater today through Sat
urday, at noon and 8 p.m.
The performances are all "con
nected in that all the pieces are re
lated to (women's) body image,"
said graduate student Sonja
Kuftinec, who organized the col
lective last spring.
Describing it as "more of a col
lage," Kuftinec said the perfor
mances include readings, music

and choreographed dances,
which center around women's
awareness and acceptance of their
bodies.
"Total Exposure" evolved out
of last spring's "Acting Out," an-

other Collective performance
that dealt with rape and sexual as
sault. After discussions of the
show repeatedly brought up the
issue of women's body images, the
members decided that a follow
up show would be a logical step,
Kuftinec said.

This quarter's show, however,
will be different. "It'll be much
more celebratory," Laskow said,
adding that the show will be a cel
ebration of women's bodies.
Laskow, who saw "Acting Out"
last spring, said she was "struck
by it"and motivated to get in
volved in this year's show.
The ideas for the show's per
formances stemmed from discus
sions members of the Collective
had over the past six months.
Most of the performers planned
their own pieces based on their
individual interests.
Because each of the pieces was
individually designed, the show
was complicated to put together
as a whole, with a working script
completed only four weeks ago.
"Hopefully, it won't be too chop
py," Laskow said. "We're really
trying to show the connection be
tween women's health and sexu
ality and their body images."
For instance, Laskow said her
piece with the boxes shows that

hooker who was abused as a child.
women's fixation on their physical
images is a real obstacle. "It im
pedes the most normal activities,"
she said. "You're constantly fixated
on eating."
Other original pieces include
choreographed dances. Senior
Karen Weitzman said her perfor
mance will center on the restric

tions of ballet. "It's about discover
ing parts of my body that ballet has
blinded me to," she said, and about
breaking out of ballet's "specific
vocabulary of movement."
Weitzman's other performance
is more traditional: three vignettes
about the relationship that cou
ples have with food, an act that in
cludes one of the two men in
volved in the show.
"It's about stereotypes," Weitz
man said, explaining that women
are expected to stay thin on salads

and water while men "buff up" on
fries, burgers and health shakes.
A discussion of body image and
body ideals led by various profes
sors will follow the performance.
Dr. Regina Casper, an expert on
eating disorders, will lead the dis
cussion today.

Performances are at noon Wednes
day through Friday, Dec. 2-4, and
at Bp.m., Thursday through Satur
