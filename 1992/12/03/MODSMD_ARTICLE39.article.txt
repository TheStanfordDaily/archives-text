# Rough and tumble at Tresidder
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
There aren't many places at Stanford where
you can parade your Sex Pistols tattoo.
Your oh-so-delicious Bridge counselor
might tell you it's okay to be yourself. But on
campus, attitudinal diversity equals a purple,
yellow and orange plaid flannel Gap shirt.
Sid and Nancy never wore plaid.
But everything's fair game at the Tresidder
game room. No blood, no foul.
The game room, the black sheep of the
Tresidder family, the Coffee House's illegiti
mate punk brother, is just the un-PC place
where you can wear clothes torn in places your
history advisor wouldn't approve of, leave your
discussions of Vichy France behind and fully
regress to your former place on the food chain.
So if you've lost the will to be merciful — as
the ditz down the hall (the one with Debbie
Gibson lyrics transcribed on her door) passes
your room one more time to whine at you
about going to house meeting — head on over
to Tresidder. Homicide goes against the Fun
damental Standard.
People don't ask you what your major is at
the game room. People don't say "womyn" at
the Game Room. People don't "get psyched
up" as they kick the crap out of someone ir.
Streetfighter 11.
The game room is as close as you can get to
the real world at Stanford, if you plan on

working in L.A. malls for the rest of your piti
ful life.
Walking in, the beige kitchen tile floor, high
ceilings and white walls with fecal-reddish
brown carpet decor lend to that rebellious feel
ing. The game room doesn't give half a care what
you think of the decor. Shut up and play pool. If
you're just passing by, leaving the warmth of
your steaming cafe latte at the Coffee House on
the way to the bathrooms, get the hell out.
Tresidder's little piece of Hades features
three pool tables, complete with the coolest
beer lamps outside the Taxi house. For a min
imal fee, you can disregard the no-smoking
sign (the only visible authority of those fascist
Palo Alto bastards) and create the perfect am
bience to practice your sharking abilities.
But those who haven't gotten used to the
rebel scene can ease into it with a bout of
Chuck E. Checse-esque air hockey. You can't
do those seductive behind-the-back, one leg
draped on the edge of the table shots playing
air hockey, but you can still vent those testos
terone surpluses.
You can also get a quick finger amputation
from a mastodon opponent whose girlfriend
just broke up with him. Better stick to pinball.
At any of the five pinball machines, all of
which seem cooler than any of Ricky Schroed
er's on "Silver Spoons," you can seem cool,
blocking your low-thousands score from the
leather-jacketed throng until you get up to par.
The Batman machine, complete with the

Batmobile bonus
and that feeble
Kim Basinger
chick (You can
say chick in the
game room.)
may seem weak
until you've seen
an angry cheer
leader "tilt" our
winged hero up
side-down after
letting the ball go
right between the
flippers. "Keep
those legs, shut
dear," Mom al
ways said.

There are also your typical dejected skater
dude pinball games: the pirate-thcmed Black
Rose (complete with a gratuitous d-cupped
damsel in distress) and Dr. Dude — that token
hippy machine; getting to be a Super Dude on
Dr. Dude may not be your idea of rebellious
glee, but it's better than watching a hissing pro
life discussion in your spare time.
And then God made video games.
Lined up in two glimmering rows, the game
room supplies the typical Stanford student
with an escape from our idyllic pseudo-reality.
You may wonder why the mangy guy next
door doesn't get the hint after you subtly offer
him your Snuggle dryer sheets. He's been too

timate denial of societal constraints.
Leave him alone. Kickboxing, muscle
bound, freakshow video game players arc peo
ple too. At least ?fter midnight.
I guess you could go there just to hang out,
stand in line for new, improved Streetfighter
or scam on the coolest of the cool. Go ahead,
line up with the rest of the frustrated students,
and give that right hand a change of scenery.
Take out those primitive tendencies on the
Simpsons machine.
But don't fake it This isn't the place for posers.
Non-conformity Ls serious business. All of you
who have been wearing out the front of the
Centipede machine, go home. It's out of order.
