# Grad students may sue over lead exposure
## 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
A graduate-student couple living in Escondido Vil
lage is expected to file a lawsuit against Stanford
today claiming that the University has not done
enough to remove allegedly dangerous lead-based
paint from the housing complex.
A press conference is scheduled for this morning to
announce the details of the suit and display for the
media some of the areas that the suit alleges to be con
taminated with high levels of lead.
Law School student Sarah Dennison-Leonard and
her husband Charles are expected to file the lawsuit
because they say tests show their daughter has been
exposed to dangerous levels of lead.
They will also claim they have been unable to con
vince the University to remove lead-based paint from
items such as swingsets and the sand in the area
around their Escondido Village apartment.
The Oakland-based Environmental Law Foundation
is working with the Dennison-Leonards on the lawsuit.
"We had testing done, and (our daughter] has been
exposed to lead," said Charles Dennison-Leonard.
"The lawsuit has not actually been filed, but we have
signed the final draft."
Lawyers for the Dennison-Leonards declined to
discuss the lawsuit until this morning's press confer
ence, and Senior University Counsel Lee Thompson,
the Stanford lawyer who is handling the case, also re
fused to comment.
"We have been speaking with representatives of
the Environmental Law Foundation, but I will not
discuss the contents of confidential negotiations,"
Thompson said. "I do not know of any lawsuit."
Dennison-Leonard said he and his wife are "not try
ing to make money" out of their planned lawsuit but
are "looking to get a change out of the University."
"Our objection is that they are doing as little as
they can, and they don't want to take action," he said.
Although no other Escondido Village residents are
expected to be part of the lawsuit when it is initially
filed tomorrow, it is likely to be designed in such a way
that other concerned parents could join in and make it
a class-action lawsuit.
But Stanford health and safety officials contend
that they have been conducting testing since they be
came aware of the alleged problems more than a year
ago and have fixed any problems.
"We have been doing almost continuous testing
since September 1991," said Janet Gleason, health
and safety coordinator at Housing and Food Service.
"We have discovered no interior (lead-based) paint
except for the base of the radiator, and, based upon
the voluntary blood tests we feel that it is safe."
L<ast March University officials announced they
had found paint that contained "borderline" levels of
lead in Escondido Village, and they began free blood
tests for children of graduate students under the age
of 7.
The tests of almost 50 children revealed that all
had levels of lead in their blood below 5 milligrams per
deciliter. The national Centers for Disease Control
considers levels above 10 milligrams per deciliter to be
of concern, according to Gleason.
Studies have shown that when children are regu
larly exposed to lead through things such as eating
paint chips, they can suffer problems with neurobe
havioral development.
