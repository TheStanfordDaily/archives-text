Have a passion for sacred vocal Renaissance
tunes?
Gotta get more a cappella in your diet?
Do you just love people with British accents?
No problem. The Lively Arts at Stanford will
take care of everything as they bring the Tallis Schol
ars to Memorial Church on Saturday Dec. 5, at 8 p.m.
This 10 person troupe of singers has toured the
world spreading their sacred sound and now
they re coming to our own back yard, lust for you.
Since their inception in 1978, The Tallis Scholars
have been unearthing and performing the works of
both famous and lesser-known Renaissance masters.
Included in their repertoire are the composi
tions of Tallis, Lassus, DesprÂ£s and Senfl. No, it's not
your ordinary Mendicants dorm pit-stop. But
we've all heard "Brown Eyed Girl" just once too
often, right?
Tickets are $20 ($l7 for students) and are avail
able at the Tresidder Ticket Office.
