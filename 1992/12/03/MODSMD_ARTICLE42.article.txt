OK, fine. It wui big in the '80s.
But paisley ties arc gone and sushi's still
around. That must mean something.
Not for the squeamish, though certainly a
pretty arrangement, sushi holds its own as a
popular choice for dates, 21 st birthdays and the
like. Just check out Miyake on a Friday night.
A few things must be understood about

the stuff before one delves into the uncooked
and the kelp-bound. First, sushi is not food.
It's an activity. It's something for when the
craving hits, and afterwards you feel like
you've done something. It's about fulfillment.
Second, there's something primal about
its rawness that keeps certain people coming
back — usually the ones that likes hickies.Fi

nally, sushi has health value. Aside from
being dietetic, the green stuff is wonderful for
clearing the sinuses.
No, it's not for everyone. But those who
don't approve shouldn't make faces. Live and
let live. But never trust a Japanese restaurant
that's located anywhere near a bait store.
