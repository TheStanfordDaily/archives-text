# Be-Boppin' Your Way
## 
### 
Everyone knows that girls dig guys who
like jazz, right? To top it off, "Reminiscing in
Bebop" is great first date material. And you
don't even need a car to get there.
The Stanford University Jazz Ensemble,
directed by Fred Barry, will be bopping forth
its fall concert tonight at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. The concert will feature Jazz En
semble vocalist Elina Mady and the local jazz
group, Night Music â€” The Acoustic Band.
Tickets cost $7 and are available at the door.
