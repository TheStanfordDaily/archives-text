# A
						Date with Shakespeare
## 
### 
Now through Dec. 13 the San Francisco
Opera will be performing a fantastical light
hearted version of Billy Shakespeare's "A
Midsummer Night's Dream." Ticket prices
range from $32 to $ 100, but before you bleed
your wallet dry, check to see if your dorm has
bargain tickets available.
