# Repaying a lifetime of love
## 
### 
I look forward to the holidays, the
same way Susan Dey looks forward
to calls from David Cassidy. Each
year, as I try to suppress fantasies of
buying a giant statue of Jesus, sticking
it in the dorm lounge and decorating it
with tinsel and colored lights (and, yes,
candy canes threaded through the
wrists and ankles) I sit down and write
the same two New Year's Day resolu
tions: Less paisley, more television.
And every year I stick to the former
and fail at the latter.

Ever since that infamous day when I first abandoned
television to spend my nights with other socially awkward
pre-attractive men, arrogantly determining which
women in the room are worth objectifying, I have failed,
my friends. And not for a lack of ethical obligation or
moral determinism. No, I know damn well that I owe tele
vision. I owe it big.
Television was a third parent to me. I ran to it early on
weekends, knowing it would be waiting â€” not groggy,
not angry, and more capable of instant puppet shows
than either of the folks who claimed to have worked so
hard to create that one little cell that divided cancerously
to create one large head and five strong limbs. Because I
loved television. Even bad television.
I loved television because it grew up with me. When I
wanted to learn how to count to 12 to cheesy disco-pin
ball music, television was there. When I wanted to replace
my mother with a stay-at-home, give-the-kids-back-the
regular-phone-and-tell-Mike-to-pull-the-pay-phone-
out-of-the-wall Florence Henderson Mom, television
was there. And when I later wanted to leave her, steal her
Wesson oil and convince my parents to buy Cinemax for
"educational reasons," television was right there, just sev
eral dangerous inches away.
Instead of turning over and going to sleep as mother na
ture intended, I am able to stay up and bond with my baby,
using those key minutes to enjoy the phenomenon of
young, attractive women sharing their personal, pompino
fantasies with should-be-defunct televangelist hose mon
key Jessica Hahn. Let's just say it's saved more than one
short-term relationship.
But somehow I've betrayed such a close and good
friend. And I can no longer look at the blank TV screen in

my dorm room without feeling I
owe just a little bit
That's why 1 go home for
break. Because there's nothing better
than getting in a room with family
and friends 1 haven't seen in years
and watching television with them.
More than history, more than
politics, more than Esperanto, televi
sion bonds this country at its very
core. Good, upstanding business
people arrive at work each day ready
to discuss whether it's physically pos-

sible for that Tom Arnold guy to have missionary-style sex
with his wife. Each night, from Watts, to a little town called
Hope, Ark-, people are watching Bob Saget make the same
dumb joke about dumb, fat guys performing dangerous
stunts with forklifts just to get on TV. If television had been
invented in the early nineteenth century, the Civil War
would never have happened.
But television betrayed me. Not that I regret any of the
hours we spent together. Although it may not have given
me the marketable skills a hobby like insider trading might
have delivered, the lessons about human relations were in
valuable. Three's Company has saved me from more than
one potentially embarrassing misunderstanding between
two womenfriends. Like I have two womcnfriends.
Television has betrayed me because it has failed to live
up to its potential.
So now I want to run it, not like Brandon Tartikoff or
Ted Turner, but as the brand new Oberprogramdircctor,
the Andy Travis of the TV airwaves.
I want television to love me back. I want it to succumb
to my every whim, even if that means a little clock on the
corner of late night Showtime movies to countdown to
the next scene involving frontal nudity.
I'm afraid of growing up so alone and detached from
the lawyer I share a bed with that we relate through Jay
Leno. So, in some pathetic, postmodern, Derrida kind of
way, I need to get inside that box. Freud would love it.

Joel Stein will have his own TV show, conveniently located
on superstation SCBN ("The Imagination Station"), early
next quarter. His column, however, will continue to ap
pear here weekly, uninterrupted, so you can keep your
reading skills up to a sixth grade level.
