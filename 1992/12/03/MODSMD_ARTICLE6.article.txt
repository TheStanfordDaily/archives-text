# After elections, political party action subsides
## 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Campaign buttons and banners,
streamers and signs have been put
away, leaving the political scene at
Stanford feeling like the aftermath of
an exhausting dance party.
"Yes, I have my life back!" were the
first words that came to Stanford De
mocrat Nancy Luxon, who served as
the co-chair of the group's presidential
election drive.
But the excitement of winning
many key races has not kept the Stan
ford Democrats still.
Although members took a much
needed respite after the election, Luxon
said there are now "many new, imagina
tive ideas coming forth."
"We want to maintain a high visibility

and high profile now," said Luxon. "Our
goal is to bring 1 political] awareness to
the campus. Our focus will be on act ion ."
As the first step, plans are presently
being made to create an independent
newspaper that will eventually compete
with the conservative Stanford Review.
"We want to create a liberal newspa
per with a lot of editorials about issues
affecting our community and campus.
It's odd that there isn't anything like
that considering we're on a liberal cam
pus," said Luxon, who plans to lead the
newspaper effort as its editor.
David Sacks, The Review's editor, said
he is looking forward to the competition.
"We welcome the exchange of
ideas," Sacks said. "Our editorial policy
has always been to encourage debate as
much as possible."
The new newspaper will be com

pletely independent of the Stanford
Democrats, as members do not want it
to be influenced in any way by the
group's political leanings.
If administrative affairs, such as
finding an initial underwriter and of
fice, are resolved, students and faculty
can expect issues to come out on a
weekly basis starting at the end of .Jan
uary 1993, Luxon said.
The Democrats also intend to invite
Hillary Clinton, wife of President-elect
Bill Clinton, to campus sometime next
year to celebrate the Democratic victory
and discuss future policies of the party.
Meanwhile, the Stanford Republicans
are experiencing a slowdown in activity,
although they intend to begin working
again soon to increase membership.
"There's an electoral lull I for Repub
licans), if you will," said sophomore

John Griggs, who is co-president of the
group. "We're taking a break right now,
especially with exams coming up."
Griggs said the club will continue to
act as a voice for Republican ideals. But
until the '94 mid-term elections, boost
ing the group's membership will be
their main goal.
"We know there are a lot of closet
Republicans out there. We want to mo
bilize them," said Griggs. "We
strengthened our core leadership roles
and our members are willing to work."
The Stanford Libertarians will con
tinue to promote their party's philoso
phy, though the national party has had
limited electoral success so far.
"We would like to invite Milton
Friedman as a guest speaker in the
near future," said Steve Mims, presi
dent of the club.
