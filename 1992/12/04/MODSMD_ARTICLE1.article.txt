## Duo accused of plot against prof. to appear in court today 
### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
Both a bail hearing and a preliminary hearing will
be held this morning for two brothers accused of
plotting to kill Assoc. Psychiatry Prof. Saul Wasser
man and his wife.
Austin and Scott Feld have both pleaded not
guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit burglary
and murder. They have been held in Santa Clara
County Jail since being arrested by Palo Alto police
in the parking lot of the Middlefield Road Safeway on
Nov. 19.
According to court documents, police became sus
picious that the two were shoplifters when they were
seen removing items from under their coats and
placing them in the trunk of their car.
But upon searching the vehicle, police discovered
ski masks, flexible handcuffs, knives, tape, gloves,
nylons and hand-drawn maps of the interior of the
Wassermans' home, located less than a mile from
the parking lot.
After arresting the duo — who hold dual U.S. and
Israeli citizenship but live in Israel — police contact
ed the Wassermans. They told police that the men
may have been sent by their 22-year-old daughter,
Rachel, who is currently studying at a religious
school in Jerusalem.
Rachel Wasserman, a graduate of Palo Alto High
School who has been under psychiatric care since en
tering Columbia University in 1989, has accused her
parents of sexually abusing her
and has threatened to kill them
several times, according to police
interviews with Dr. Wasserman.
Austin Feld told police that he
met Rachel Wasserman a few
months ago when she came to vol
unteer at the Macabee Institute of
Emergency Response, an organi
zation for troubled youth that he
runs in Israel. He said he then
became "emotionally supportive"
of her, according to police docu
ments.
He said that when Rachel
Wasserman learned he was plan
ning to visit his brother, Mitchell,

in the United States, she gave
Austin a key to her parents' home
in addition to several pictures and
the maps of the house. The maps
indicated the location of a shot
gun and the precise layout of the
house. She instructed him to go
inside the house, look at the
rooms and see "what type of ener
gy" he felt, according to police
documents.
Santa Clara County District
Attorney Stan Voyles, who is han
dling the case, said he will request
that the two not be released on
bail.
"I can't imagine they will grant
bail," he said. "It would have to be
enormous."
Judge Timothy Hanifin will
hear the case today.
