# U.N. orders armed humanitarian rescue
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The Security Council
launched the world's biggest armed humanitarian
rescue last night, ordering a U.S.-led force to silence
the guns of Somali bandits and help feed hundreds of
thousands of starving people.
The 15-member council, outraged by the plunder
ing of relief aid destined for refugee camps full of
walking skeletons, voted unanimously in favor of the
huge operation.
After planning with his generals and working the
phones to drum up troop donations from abroad,
President Bush was poised to unleash the largest U.S.
military operation since the Gulf War.
Given the order, 1,800 troops aboard a three-ship
strike force floating in the Indian Ocean could land on
Somali beaches within hours, and the full force of
28,000 could arrive within weeks.
France will add as many as 2,000 troops. Italy

offered an unspecified amount of help.
For all the boldness of the move, it came more than
a year after severe food shortages and civil unrest
were first reported in Somalia. And the Security
Council mandate was vague: to use "all necessary
means" to create "a secure environment" for relief
operations.
The resolution did not say if that might mean cre
ating some kind of U.N.-controlled civil government
in chaotic Somalia, and it said nothing about how long
the operation would last.
Clan battles have raged in Somalia since the col
lapse of President Mohamed Siad Barre's rule in Jan
uary 1991, worsening a famine that has killed 300,000
people.
Well-armed militias have stolen at least half of the
food and medicine shipped to Somalia and paralyzed a
U.N. peacekeeping force in place since September.

With hundreds of people dying daily, the United
States and its allies were anxious to act.
U.S. officials took pains to portray the intervention
as a humanitarian effort. "We are not looking to go in
with guns blazing," said Pentagon spokesman Pete
Williams.
The White House said President Bush hopes the
relief operation can be secured by the time he leaves
office on Jan. 20. Aides to President-elect Clinton
were dubious, saying they expected Clinton to inherit
Bush's Somalia policy.
After negotiations with leery Third World countries
and China, the United States agreed to more U.N.
oversight than was the case with the multi-national
force that drove Iraqi troops from Kuwait last year.
But the resolution explicitly empowers the U.S.
commander to make the tactical decisions about safe
guarding the relief shipments.
