# Companies propose universal health insurance

### 
NEW YORK (AP) - The insurance
industry took a big step toward shap
ing health-care reform yesterday by
proposing a sweeping plan for univer
sal coverage that would be financed
partly by taxing Americans with gener
ous benefits.
The Health Insurance Association
of America, which represents 270 com
mercial insurers, said the draft propos
al approved by its board will "jump
start health-care reform."
A cornerstone of the plan is to cut

costs and provide a package of "essen
tial" benefits to all Americans â€”
including the 35 million currently
uninsured. Those are goals champi
oned by President-elect Clinton, who
vowed to unveil his own health-care
reform plan during his first 100 days
in office.
Clinton spokesman George
Stephanopoulos said it was a break
through for the insurance industry
trade group to "come around and say
that we need a national health-care

system.
But the association's proposal
reflects insurance-industry thinking
long before Clinton's victory, as it
became clearer that the nation's health
care system was out of control. The pro
posal should give insurers a more influ
ential voice in the reform process.
Under the proposal, private insur
ers would agree to provide coverage to
every American. People would be cov
ered either through their employers or
"their own means." The essential-ben

efits package would pay for catastroph
ic illness as well as primary and pre
ventive care.
For employed Americans who con
tinue to receive generous benefits, any
thing beyond the value of the essential
benefits package would be taxed as
income.
Those revenues would help the gov
ernment foot the bill to cover the poor.
Private insurers and health providers
would care for people below the pover
ty line.
