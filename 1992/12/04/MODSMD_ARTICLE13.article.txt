## A
						dead Dead Week 
### 
Students deserve a
real time for study
at quarter's end

DEAD WEEK IS ALIVE and
well, thank you very much.
It's chewing up students
and spitting them out. It needs to
be killed.
Unlike the two-week long read
ing periods of our prestigious
counterparts (Harvard and Yale),
Stanford's Dead Week is a time

when professors present
new material, and read
ing and writing assign
ments are increased '
rather than decreased.
The week before
finals is dead in name
only, and something
should be done about it.
Professors understand
ably want to spend as
much time as possible pre-

senting new course materi
al — 10 weeks is hardly enough
time to read and discuss Plato's
"Republic" and not nearly enough
for an entire CIV syllabus.
However, the constraints of the
quarter system must not be used as
an excuse for a heavy work load dur
ing Dead Week. A real Dead Week is
needed at Stanford to give students
a week to "burn the midnight oil" —
to catch up on the work they
haven't gotten to, as well as to study
for their upcoming finals.
Currently, students are given no
such period to collect themselves.
Classes go until Friday, and a com
mon due date for papers is the last
day of the quarter. This situation
leaves many students without a
realistic chance to finish all of
their course work. "I never catch
up, the quarter just ends" goes the
popular campus saying.
A real Dead Week — one in
which no new material was
allowed to be presented — would
allow students time to thoroughly
learn and absorb class material,

rather than cramming it all in dur
ing one all-nighter and forgetting
it the next week.
Unfortunately, professors do
have a good excuse for not follow
ing Dead Week policy — it is nei
ther clear nor enforced. Professors
have about as much care and
knowledge of Dead Week policy as
bookstore employees have for prop
er accounting procedures. This
attitude is only encouraged by the
fact that no one enforces the policy
or makes it a matter of debate.
Casper, as a new presence on
campus, is in a unique position to

formulate a new, explicit
Dead Week policy and to

make it stick. Using his
office as a bully pulpit,
Casper should urge the

faculty senate to for
mulate a new policy
and provide a plan for
enforcement.

This policy should
forbid professors
from assigning new

readings or present
ing new material material in lec
ture. The only writing assign
ments due during Dead Week
should be long term research
papers that students have been
working on for the majority of the
quarter. Shorter papers should be
due before Dead Week arrives.
Casper should back a new policy
not only because it is right, but
because it would assure students
of his commitment to their needs,
and to his previously stated goal of
improving the shallowness found
in some of Stanford's academic
policies.
Because our jam-packed quar
ters are only 10 weeks long, per
haps it would be wise to give stu
dents only Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday off, giving students a
five day "Dead Week." It's not a
week, but it's better than what we
have now.

This is the first in a series of periodic
"Memos to Casper," giving advice to
our new president on a variety of cam
pus issues.
