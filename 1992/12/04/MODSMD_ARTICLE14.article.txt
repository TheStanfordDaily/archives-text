Strong reaction to interracial dating, 'Asian fetish'

Gays and bisexuals have
interracial problems, too
I am disappointed and amazed by The
Daily's overt omission of lesbian, gay
and bisexual issues from its interracial
relationship coverage. The paper's fail
ure to include these issues shows that
the news editors are oblivious of the
similar interracial issues that many les
bian, gay and bisexual individuals face.
I would like to point out that interra
cial relationships among non-heterosex
ual individuals are as complicated as
those among heterosexuals, and an ade
quate examination of interracial rela
tionships cannot treat the two commu
nity's issues as separate matters.
Gay Asian men are subjected to the
same "subservient," "innocent" and
"exotic" stereotypes as Asian women. I
know many gay whites who date only
Asians (often referred to as "rice
queens" or "eggs").
Some claim to be attracted to Asians
because of their dark-hair, smooth
physique and youthful looks. Others
prefer Asians because they are suppos
edly "submissive and mysterious." I
even know some white men who treat
Asians as sexual objects because of their
perception of Asians as "amenable."
Many gay Asians also experience the
same insecurities about their perceived
"unattractiveness" as their heterosexual
counterparts, given their negative media
portrayal. Issues such as "self-esteem,"
"internalized Asian phobia" or "idealiza
tion of white men" are definitely visible
problems.
The lack of coverage on lesbian, gay
and bisexual concerns reflects the gener
al neglect in our society to include non
heterosexualities as legitimate forms of
relationships.
Perhaps The Daily should expand the

definition and redefine the meaning of
interracial relationships to include rele
vant lesbian, gay and bisexual concerns.

Asian males get a raw
deal in \fetish 9 article
As an Asian male, I am aware of the
prevalence of negative stereotypes
regarding Asian males in the media as
well as at Stanford. This in itself dis
turbs me, but what I find even more dis
turbing is the one-dimensional lack of
confidence reflected in the responses by
Asian males in your Dec. 1 article.
The responses expressed the "typical
Asian male's" fear of rejection from both
Caucasian and Asian women as well as
his insecurity stemming from living in
the boundary of two cultures.
We Asian males do not all subscribe
to those fears and insecurities. In fact,
many of us are confident individuals
who are not afraid to ask out a woman,
regardless of her race. Many of us do not
feel excluded from interracial relation
ships, nor do we feel slighted by Asian
women.
We do not feel we are overly studious
and shy, nor do we believe that we are
subject to someone's belief that we pos
sess smaller builds than males of other
races. As any male who regularly fre
quents Encina Gym will tell you, Asian
males are well represented there.
I do not find it important to find out
why there appears to be more Asian
female-Caucasian male couples than the
reverse. In addition, I do not find it
appropriate or constructive that Asian
males who are frustrated by the nega
tive stereotypes bitterly place blame on
Asian females for "betraying their cul
ture." I personally believe Asian females
should date whomever they please.

Until more favorable images of the
Asian male become more prevalent in
the media, Asian males are left to deal
with the problem of negative stereo
types. The solution? To fight and dispel
the negative images and the false stereo
types surrounding them. Prevalent atti
tudes are changed one person at a time.
Thus, Asian men must, and can, change
these attitudes by showing they do not
conform to the studious, shy, wimpy
stereotypes that plague all Asian males.

To men with an 'Asian
fetishget a sheep
I'm extremely happy that Monday's
article by Carrie Chang brought the
"Asian fetish" phenomenon out into the
open.
"Paul," a person interviewed for the
article, stated, "[Asian-American women 1
tend to be quieter and they don't contra
dict me as much, so it all works out for
the better." This attraction to inert sub
servience makes me furious. If that's
what you really want, blow-up dolls are
cheap and maintenance isn't expensive.
And I hear sheep don't put up much of a
fuss either. At the risk of being labeled
politically correct, I think this vile enjoy
ment of holding women down in a posi
tion of acquiescence sucks.
The article about Asian male stereo
types also really bothered me. Kenneth
Tan exemplifies the tone of the article by
trying to speak for the Asian-American
male population as a whole. "We this,"
"we that "... I really don't identify with
much he said. The community of Asian-
Americans is not a homogeneous bunch of
nerdy calculator-toting computerphiles.
Instead of whining about a problem
that exists within our community, why
don't we instead attempt to solve it by

showing the greater community that this
stereotype isn't always accurate.

White males stereotyped
as wanting 'China dolls'
It was with both interest and dismay
that I read your article on fetishes for
Asian females. As a white male who is
currently dating an Asian female on
campus, I have encountered much hostil
ity and suspicion from those who ques
tion my motives in the relationship and
paint me as full of racial stereotypes.
Your article, unfortunately, does little
else than to promote the view that white
males who pursue and date Asian
females are sexists in search of a sub
servient "China doll." I have no doubt
that some who are attracted to and date
Asian females do so because of demean
ing stereotypes of Asian women as exotic
and docile. However, to paint all
"Asiaphiles" with the same brush is to
unfairly make white males guilty by
association.
When people find out that my girl
friend is Asian, many (Asian women in
particular) react with disdain and anger.
Their thoughts are all too clear â€” anoth
er white guy chasing afler a "twinkie"
Asian woman so he can fulfil his racial
fantasies. Such a reaction to white-Asian
interracial couples is itself born out of
stereotypes, and it both belittles the Asian
female's intelligence and strong spirit and
insults the white male's integrity.
I suggest that all attractions that cross
racial'lines be given "innocent until
proven guilty" treatment. Not all white
males dating Asians are struck with "yel
low fever" or are looking for the equiva
lent of a mail order bride.
