## Unable to stimulate G-Spot 
### 
LAST WEEK, I WAS tickled pink by
the news that a group of women on
campus were looking for help with
The G-Spot. Gathering together a few
useful implements, I sprinted to the room
of one of the women soliciting aid and
offered my assistance.
She seemed both exhilarated by my
frantic enthusiasm and confused by the
cucumbers in my hands, and she asked
me what I planned to submit. I looked
sheepishly down at my crotch, and she
asked if I had ever written for a feminist
magazine before. It was at that moment
that I realized my egregious mistake.
But it was too late. There was no turn
ing back. I couldn't let her know what I
had planned on doing with the boomerang
in my backpack. I had to stay cool. I had to
roll with the punches. I had to lie.
I told her that I had been writing fem
inist poetry for years, and I had finally
decided to publish some of my work. I
went home and spent the next 48 hours
examining feminism and trying to shape
my feelings into poetry.
I thought about the misunderstand
ings that occur so frequently between the
sexes, the unfair treatment women have
been subjected to for so many years and
all the negative stereotypes that persist
to this day. I thought about how little I,
as a man, could truly comprehend what it
meant to be a woman. I thought about
how much I love boobs.

I synthesized all these cogitations into
two emotionally charged poems, and
brought them to The G-Spot (the "gender
spot," that is). As with almost every
example of true genius, however, my
poems were rejected and I was branded
an outcast from this new feminist com
munity, simply because my works did not
fit within their narrow definition of "fem
inist poetry." Fools.
So finally, and with much trepidation,
I have decided to run the poems in my
column, because they are that important
to me (and because The G-Spot didn't
want them).

in the heat of
the noon-day sun
• i stand.
a chisel in one hand
and a hammer
in the other.
she's silhouetted in the doorway
under-sexed, over-weight
and middle-aged.
her tongue runs over her teeth
as she smiles slyly.
she wants me.
her hand goes to her blouse
and her breasts
begin to heave,
i drop my tools on the grass

and saunter slowly
toward the house.
she offers a glass of cool water
and lfts her skirt, oh no, not again. ..
a penis.
"Vagina"
I wish that I had a vagina
It would be good to put things in
I'd have a place to hide my money
I'd never lose my keys again.
I woldn't need to use a lunch box
My vagina would work just as well
And if I'm eating a tuna sandwich
Then they would both have the same
smell.
But I have heard that vaginas are slip
pery
And fall prey to a monthly attack
I think that I have changed my mind
Can I please have my penis back?

poetry will not.
