## Cardinal slayed by Spartans in San Jose basketball fiasco 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
An easy ride down the 280 it
was not.
After pasting the NAIA Puget
Sound Loggers by 50 points just
one night earlier, the Cardinal did
not rise to the challenge against
Division I San Jose State. Stan

ford did everything it could to
lose, and did, falling 56-52 to the
Spartans.
A crowd of 1,931 partisans,
including one so loyal that he
painted his facial hair in school
colors, had plenty to cheer about
in the Event Center as San Jose
State went halfway towards
matching its last year's win total,

posting its first victory of the
year.
The Cardinal had trouble at
both ends of the floor as the Spar
tan defense stifled the Cardinal
perimeter game, while the Stan
ford defense failed to rebound the
ball after missed Spartan shots,
allowing San Jose several second
chance shot opportunities.
To say that coach Mike Mont
gomery was not pleased would be
an understatement.
"What did we do well?" Mont
gomery asked rhetorically. "Well,
nothing."
San Jose State opened the slug
gish contest with a 15-4 run over
the first eight minutes before the
Cardinal started to see the num
bers change on its side of the
scoreboard. The Spartan defense
was especially effective in neutral
izing Stanford's outside shooting
threats, as Peter Dukes freed
himself to take only four shots at
the basket during the first half,
sinking only one, while backcourt
mate Marcus Lollie took only
three looks at the basket, all with
out success.
Only with the entrance of Stan
ford's less experienced bench play
ers did the Cardinal offense begin
to show signs of life. With a youth
ful lineup of Bobby Patton, Andy
Poppink, Nick Ravn, Bart Lam
mersen and Dukes, the Cardinal
managed to rally from a 21-11
deficit at the 6:18 mark with a 13-
6 spurt to trail at halftime 27-24.
Guard Patton nailed three of four
shots, including two of three
threes to bring the long shot back
into function, and would-be
bomber Ravn lit up a three-point
er of his own from 19 feet.
"We were really having trouble
scoring," Montgomery said.
"Brent (Williams) never went
where he was supposed to go,
because he got physicalled. Bobby
and Nick came in and were able to
execute as well as they could. If
the veterans can't do the job,
we're going to have to let the
bench do it."
On defense, Stanford's post
players were having plenty of prob
lems inside, and as a result, got into
foul trouble early. Both Lam
mersen and freshman Darren Ail
away fouled out, and center Todd
Manley was pushed and shoved to
the point that he was thrown for an

unwanted painful encounter with
the playing floor.
Stanford did manage to rattle
the Spartan offense somewhat dur
ing the second half by switching to
a 2-3 zone defense from a man-to
man. Yet guard Les Shepherd, a
junior walk-on who only a year ago
was the San Jose State intramural
league's "Most Valuable Player,"
managed to pace the Spartans from
the outside with 13 points.
Spartan center Daryl Scott led
all scorers with 14 points, and was
extremely pleased to taste victory

again after the long fast that was
last season.
"Stanford is just up the road,
it's the ritzy, educated school —
it's nice to beat them," Scott said.
It was Stanford, however, that
beat itself. The Cardinal shot a
dismal 36.5 percent from the field
and committed 14 turnovers.
Yet despite Stanford's lacklus
ter performance, San Jose State
almost allowed the Cardinal to
put the game in the victory col
umn. The Cardinal trailed 52-41
with 1:17 left in the game when

Marcus Lollie took the game into
his own hands, scoring 11 points
— including three three-pointers
— in the final minute.
The Spartans did what they
could to lose, converting only
four-of-ten free throws down the
stretch. But Stanford ran out of
time to complete the impressive
comeback attempt.
If the Cardinal puts on a simi
lar display on Saturday in Char
lottesville against Virginia of the
Atlantic Coast Conference, it
could be a long flight home.
