# Little room for praise in loss

When head coach Mike Mont
gomery uses the word "con
fused" to describe his team's
play, you know the Cardinal
didn't have a good night.
The Stanford team that pro
duced 92 points less than 24
hours before was nowhere to be
found on the floor of the Event
Center in San Jose last night.
Instead, a scrappy, athletic
Spartan team that went 2-24 just
last year humbled the Cardinal
with aggressive defense and
clutch free-throw shooting down
the stretch. And this was sup
posed to be one of those early sea
son "tune-up" games.
"If you don't execute, you
can't win," Montgomery said fol
lowing the game. "I have to give
San Jose all the credit — they
played better than we did and
deserved to win."
Stanford had trouble from the
start establishing an offensive
presence against the feisty Spar
tan defense. By the end of the
first half, Stanford's starting five
could only muster a combined
nine points.
To make things worse, inside
men Bart Lammersen and Todd
Manley were outmuscled and
pushed around by San Jose State's
Mike Brotherton and Daiyl Scott,
who combined for 21 points
against Stanford's post men.
"We didn't get the relief we
wanted at the low post, that
was pretty obvious," Mont
gomery said. "There was con
cern with the post's ability to
get open, and a lot of it has to
do with a lack of strength."

Fortunately for Montgomery,
the Cardinal bench kept the
game close throughout. Sopho
more guard Bobby Patton pro
vided a gleam of hope in Stan
ford's otherwise bleak perfor
mance, taking charge of the
offense and opening up from the
perimeter to spread out the Spar
tan defense.
He converted three of six field
goals and two of five from three
point range, along with a pair of
free throws, two assists and a
steal. He finished as Stanford's
third-highest scorer with 10
points.
"Bobby played well — we were
really having problems getting a
shot and Bobby just went in and
was patient," Montgomery said.
"He waited for his shot and took
it."
Stanford's bench as a whole
produced 21 of Stanford's 52
points in the game.
The other bright moment for
Stanford came with just under a
minute remaining. Point guard
Marcus Lollie, held scoreless all
game, exploded with three con
secutive threes and two foul
shots to keep Stanford alive late
in the game, cutting the Spar
tans' lead to 55-52 before for
ward Jason Allen sunk the front
end of a pair of free throws to ice
the game. Lollie finished with
those 11 points, all scored in the
final 48 seconds of play.
Unfortunately for Mont
gomery and the Cardinal, it was
too little, too late. "We really
didn't get a good performance
anywhere," Montgomery said.
"We just didn't do the things
you need to do to win a basket
ball game."
