# Trimming art
## Loss of funds from operating budget cuts meat in art depts. 
### Brian Brennan 
As many had feared, the process of trimming the
fat from Stanford's art departments has gotten to
the meat as well.
"It's a very complicated process," began Albert
Cohen, chairman of the Music Department, which is
suffering from the loss of a quarter million dollars
from its operating budget, sending the Percussion
Ensemble, Baroque Orchestra, and Early Renais
sance Wind Band to the great Stanford in the sky.
"We're trying to maintain the services and con
certs — we're trying that this year, but it may not
work," he added as he sat back in his chair with a
look of frustration.
Uncertainty is a common theme throughout the
art departments this year. Though sentiment re
mains upbeat among department coordinators,
there is a pervasive uneasiness that can be felt in the
air, from the stage to the practice room to the dance
floor.
About 200 students lost the chance to dance this
quarter with the elimination of 20 percent of the
dance division, said Susan Cashion, the division
chairwoman.
But she fears impending cuts even more. "The
master's program, in cooperation with the School of
Education, is in danger of being eliminated," said
Cashion worriedly. "This is our life's blood in terms
of academics."
"We'll feel it more next year," said Drama Chair
man Michael Ramsaur with grim assurance, ex
plaining that the departments have three years to
implement their budget reductions.
Although cuts in the Music Department are
geared towards graduate students, undergraduates
will suffer as well. For example, when in a state of
confusion after lecture, they will have no graduate
students to turn to for enlightenment.
"The cuts were fairly severe, especially in the
graduate area, but that spills into the undergradu
ate area. TA's are cut as well," explained Cohen.
In contrast to the Music Department, Ramsaur
said that the graduate drama program has been
largely spared. The department "holds the graduate
program in highest regard. It is our highest priority
for that program not to be dimin
ished," he said.
Cohen is glad that despite the
lost funding, the major programs
have been able to survive thus far.
"Large programs, like the sym
phony, are still around," Cohen

said. The preservation of concerts
has been a high priority in the
budget process, he said, explain
ing that "it is imperative to have a
forum for performance after hav
ing studied."
The dance division has been
able to keep introductory courses
"to serve the greatest number of
students," despite losing one-fifth
of its budget, said Cashion. "The
personnel is the most important

part of the program. We were able
to keep core faculty," she said,
trying to view the situation in a
positive light.
Cashion is concerned that the
dance division may suffer the
most of all the suffering arts.
"We think we contribute greatly
to Stanford's well-being," she
said. "Dance is always singled
out as the most frivolous of the
arts. Why is dance always the

one? We have a complete pro
gram."
For the moment, though, the
dance division takes comfort in
the fact that dance has survived
at Stanford.
"We had heard that when they
started checking about cuts that
the dance division was thought
about to be eliminated," said
Cashion. "We are very thankful
that we are here and that Ted

Leland, the athletic director, has
championed and supported us."
And the good news: though all
art students will have to deal with
fewer programs, the need to
establish new student fees and
increase existing has been
avoided for now.
But that doesn't mean that
budding artists will be safe from
fees forever. While the depart
ment heads agree that students

should not be charged additional
ly to experience the arts, each also
admits t hat as the budget process
unfolds, all options must be con
sidered to meet the budget
demands.
Despite the bitterness of the
topic, Cohen managed to retain
an upbeat tone. "We'll make it. I
have no doubt there, but it's a
process that doesn't always make
for happiness," he said.
