# Trimming art
## Loss of funds from operating budget cuts meat in art depts.

As many had feared, the process of trimming the
fat from Stanford's art departments has gotten to
the meat as well.
"It's a very complicated process," began Albert
Cohen, chairman of the Music Department, which is
suffering from the loss of a quarter million dollars
from its operating budget, sending the Percussion
Ensemble, Baroque Orchestra, and Early Renais
sance Wind Band to the great Stanford in the sky.
"We're trying to maintain the services and con
certs â€” we're trying that this year, but it may not
work," he added as he sat back in his chair with a
look of frustration.
Uncertainty is a common theme throughout the
art departments this year. Though sentiment re

there is a pervasive uneasiness that can be felt in the

quarter with the elimination of 20 percent of the
dance division, said Susan Cashion, the division

But she fears impending cuts even more. "The
master's program, in cooperation with the School of
Education, is in danger of being eliminated," said
Cashion worriedly. "This is our life's blood in terms
of academics."
"We'll feel it more next year," said Drama Chair
man Michael Ramsaur with grim assurance, ex
plaining that the departments have three years to
implement their budget reductions.
Although cuts in the Music Department are
geared towards graduate students, undergraduates
will suffer as well. For example, when in a state of
confusion after lecture, they will have no graduate
students to turn to for enlightenment.
"The cuts were fairly severe, especially in the
graduate area, but that spills into the undergradu
ate area. TA's are cut as well," explained Cohen.
In contrast to the Music Department, Ramsaur
said that the graduate drama program has been
largely spared. The department "holds the graduate
program in highest regard. It is our highest priority
