# Stanford takes on Panthers
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team has amassed an impressive 26-
2 overall record this year and a No. 2
national ranking, defeating top-25
teams nine times along the way.
They average 16.91 kills a game,
good for third in the nation, and 20
of their 26 wins came by 3-0 mar
gins.
But you might as well throw all
that out the window. As far as the
Cardinal is concerned, they're 0-0,
and their season is just beginning.
The road to the Final Four
begins 7:30 p.m. tonight at Maples
Pavilion, when Stanford hosts the
University of Pittsburgh in the first
round of the NCAA Women's Vol
leyball Tournament. The Panthers
(18-13, 5-2 in the Big East Confer
ence) earned an automatic bid to the
Tournament as the Big East cham
pions, defeating Providence in the
final match of the Big East Tourna
ment to take the title.
Pittsburgh brings a tenacious,
ball-control attack to tonight's
match, relying on solid passing and
good team execution to overcome its
opponents. The Panthers' top play
er is junior outside hitter Ann Marie
Lucanie, who leads the team in most
categories including kills (513), digs
(396) and hitting percentage (.318).
Lucanie was named the Big East's
Most Valuable Player, and garnered
MVP honors in the Big East tourna
ment for the third straight year.
Lucanie is joined on the Pan
ther offense by sophomore middle
hitter Melanie Gustafson, setter
Annemarie Mernagh and fresh
man hitters Alyssia Yanik, Sarah
Mikla and Sara Mitchell.
"They're a good ball-control team
that really doesn't make a lot of mis
takes," Stanford head coach Don
Shaw said of Pittsburgh. "We're
expecting a good match from them."
Stanford (26-2, 16-2 in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference) makes its 12th
straight NCAA appearance tonight,
in pursuit of its first-ever national
championship title. The Cardinal
will be led into the match by three
time Ail-American Bev Oden, who
leads the team in kills (378), kills per

game (4.2), aces (24), total blocks
(112) and blocks per game (1.2).
Joining Oden at the hitting posi
tions are freshman Gary Wendell,
senior Jennifer Jackson and sopho
more Anne Wicks. Wendell, a candi
date for Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year honors, leads the team in digs
with 257, is third in kills (276) and is
second behind Oden in kill average
(3.1). Wicks has posted 156 kills in
her second season at Stanford, and
ranks behind Oden in total blocks
with 65. Jackson has 224 kills on the
year, managing 2.6 a game, as well
as 195 digs.
Also comprising the Stanford
offense are Oden's fellow tri-cap
tains, senior hitter Laurie Sawin
and senior setter Carrie Feldman.
Sawin, who switches into the back
row for Wicks, registered 165 digs
this season, averaging 1.9 a game.
Feldman is one of the nation's top
setters, tallying 977 assists this
year. She averages 11.45 assists per
game, good for fourth in the Pac-10,
and has added 70 kills with an
impressive .444 hitting average.
The Cardinal's final starter,
senior Kristi Paaso, is plagued by
acute tendonitis of the knee and is
questionable for tonight's match.
This would be a substantial loss for
the Cardinal, as Paaso has poured in
623 kills and 228 digs this year, sec

ond behind Oden in both categories.
Paaso worked out with the team
in practice yesterday, but Shaw is
unsure whether or not she'll see
playing time tonight. "Hopefully, we
won't be in the position where we
have to play her," Shaw said. "We'll
have to see how things go."
The winner of tonight's match
will travel to the Mideast Regional
in Champaign-Urbana, 111. to face
the winner of the Penn State-Notre
Dame match in the regional quar
terfinals, barring a loss by Illinois in
the first round. Stanford travels out
of the West Region this year due to
an NCAA rule requiring that the
No. 1 and No. 2 teams from the
same region be placed in separate
regionals.
Although moving out of the
region means Stanford won't hit
top-ranked UCLA until the national
championship match, the move is a
mixed blessing. The Mideast boasts
the Nos. 6, 7,9,15,20, and 22 teams
in the nation, a tough road for the
Cardinal to hoe.
"I'm happy with where we are
now — the first round of the Tour
nament," Shaw said. "Obviously
I'm glad they split up the No. 1 and
2 teams, but our Regional is by far
the toughest in the nation this year.
If we do win it all, we definitely will
have earned it."

mixed blessing. The Mideast boasts
the Nos. 6, 7,9,15,20, and 22 teams
in the nation, a tough road for the
Cardinal to hoe.
"I'm happy with where we are
now — the first round of the Tour
nament," Shaw said. "Obviously
I'm glad they split up the No. 1 and
2 teams, but our Regional is by far
the toughest in the nation this year.
If we do win it all, we definitely will
have earned it."

The Stanford Cardinal takes on Pittsburgh tonight in Maples in the
first round of NCAA competition.
The Stanford women's volleyball
team has amassed an impressive 26-
2 overall record this year and a No. 2
national ranking, defeating top-25
teams nine times along the way.
They average 16.91 kills a game,
good for third in the nation, and 20
of their 26 wins came by 3-0 mar
gins.
But you might as well throw all
that out the window. As far as the
Cardinal is concerned, they're 0-0,
and their season is just beginning.
The road to the Final Four
begins 7:30 p.m. tonight at Maples
Pavilion, when Stanford hosts the
University of Pittsburgh in the first
round of the NCAA Women's Vol
leyball Tournament. The Panthers
(18-13, 5-2 in the Big East Confer
ence) earned an automatic bid to the
Tournament as the Big East cham
pions, defeating Providence in the
final match of the Big East Tourna
ment to take the title.
Pittsburgh brings a tenacious,
ball-control attack to tonight's
match, relying on solid passing and
good team execution to overcome its
opponents. The Panthers' top play
er is junior outside hitter Ann Marie
Lucanie, who leads the team in most
categories including kills (513), digs
(396) and hitting percentage (.318).
Lucanie was named the Big East's
Most Valuable Player, and garnered
MVP honors in the Big East tourna
ment for the third straight year.
Lucanie is joined on the Pan
ther offense by sophomore middle
hitter Melanie Gustafson, setter
Annemarie Mernagh and fresh
man hitters Alyssia Yanik, Sarah
Mikla and Sara Mitchell.
"They're a good ball-control team
that really doesn't make a lot of mis
takes," Stanford head coach Don
Shaw said of Pittsburgh. "We're
expecting a good match from them."
Stanford (26-2, 16-2 in the Pacif
ic 10 Conference) makes its 12th
straight NCAA appearance tonight,
in pursuit of its first-ever national
championship title. The Cardinal
will be led into the match by three
time Ail-American Bev Oden, who
leads the team in kills (378), kills per

game (4.2), aces (24), total blocks
(112) and blocks per game (1.2).
Joining Oden at the hitting posi
tions are freshman Gary Wendell,
senior Jennifer Jackson and sopho
more Anne Wicks. Wendell, a candi
date for Pac-10 Freshman of the
Year honors, leads the team in digs
with 257, is third in kills (276) and is
second behind Oden in kill average
(3.1). Wicks has posted 156 kills in
her second season at Stanford, and
ranks behind Oden in total blocks
with 65. Jackson has 224 kills on the
year, managing 2.6 a game, as well
as 195 digs.
Also comprising the Stanford
offense are Oden's fellow tri-cap
tains, senior hitter Laurie Sawin
and senior setter Carrie Feldman.
Sawin, who switches into the back
row for Wicks, registered 165 digs
this season, averaging 1.9 a game.
Feldman is one of the nation's top
setters, tallying 977 assists this
year. She averages 11.45 assists per
game, good for fourth in the Pac-10,
and has added 70 kills with an
impressive .444 hitting average.
The Cardinal's final starter,
senior Kristi Paaso, is plagued by
acute tendonitis of the knee and is
questionable for tonight's match.
This would be a substantial loss for
the Cardinal, as Paaso has poured in
623 kills and 228 digs this year, sec

ond behind Oden in both categories.
Paaso worked out with the team
in practice yesterday, but Shaw is
unsure whether or not she'll see
playing time tonight. "Hopefully, we
won't be in the position where we
have to play her," Shaw said. "We'll
have to see how things go."
The winner of tonight's match
will travel to the Mideast Regional
in Champaign-Urbana, 111. to face
the winner of the Penn State-Notre
Dame match in the regional quar
terfinals, barring a loss by Illinois in
the first round. Stanford travels out
of the West Region this year due to
an NCAA rule requiring that the
No. 1 and No. 2 teams from the
same region be placed in separate
regionals.
Although moving out of the
region means Stanford won't hit
top-ranked UCLA until the national
championship match, the move is a
mixed blessing. The Mideast boasts
the Nos. 6, 7,9,15,20, and 22 teams
in the nation, a tough road for the
Cardinal to hoe.

nament," Shaw said. "Obviously
