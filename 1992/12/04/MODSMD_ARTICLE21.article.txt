# Hoops out to shine in Hawaii

When most people travel to Hawaii, they find
plenty of time for relaxing on the beach during the
day and hitting the clubs at night.
Not so for the Stanford women's basketball
squad, who will spend all weekend at the University
of Hawaii participating in the highly competitive
Wahine Classic.
The competition, billed as one of the strongest
women's basketball tournaments of the '92-'93 sea
son, pits the Cardinal against three of the nation's
top teams on all three days. As a result of Stanford's
rigorous game schedule, there won't be much time
to get a tan.
"We all know that it's pretty much a serious
trip," said guard Kate Paye. "There's not going to be
a whole lot of time for fun, but playing basketball is
fun in itself."
Stanford opens the tournament today against
Illinois State, a team similar in style to the Texas
Tech squad the Cardinal barely beat three days ago.
The Redbirds play a zone defense, and according to
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer, her team must
improve the way it attacks such a defense.
"We need to work on our outside shooting
against the zone," she explained.
On Saturday, the top-ranked Cardinal faces
either Hawaii or Portland. Stanford has never lost
to either of these teams in its previous meetings

against them.
If the team conquers their opponents both Friday
and Saturday, it could set up a championship show
down on Sunday with No. 2-ranked Tennessee.
The Lady Volunteers are seeking revenge after
they were upset by Stanford last year at Maples
Pavilion. The Cardinal squad shocked the nation's
No. 1 team in a 96-95 overtime thriller during the
regular season.
Stanford is led by preseason Ail-American senior
Molly Goodenbour and 1992 senior All-American
Val Whiting. Both played major roles in Tuesday's
victory over Texas Tech and will be looked upon to
provide much of the team's offensive production in
Hawaii. Whiting broke out for 27 points against the
Red Raiders, 24 in the second half, while Gooden
bour gathered 23 points of her own.
Although the 1-0 Cardinal defeated Texas Tech
by an eight-point margin, they squandered a 24-
point second-half lead and barely held on as the
Stanford defense and offense was shut down during
the game's last 15 minutes.
Stanford's unimpressive performance dismayed
VanDerveer and her players, and they admitted
there is still a lot of work to be done. According to
Paye, it will take a greater effort from the Cardinal
team if they expect to win the Wahine Classic.
"We all know that we didn't play well against
Texas Tech and that we made some mistakes," she
said. "We have been playing better in practice than
we played against Texas Tech."
