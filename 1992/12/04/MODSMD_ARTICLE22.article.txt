# Cardinal to wrangle in Texas
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
This weekend, the top-ranked Stanford women's
swimming team travels to Texas to challenge some of
the nation's best squads in the University of Texas Invi
tational.
Three of the nation's top five teams, No. 1 Stanford,
No. 2 Texas and No. 5 Arizona, will be on hand, along
with representatives from Texas A&M, Rice, Nebraska,
LSU, Arkansas and Houston.
"Many of the teams, especially Arizona and Texas,
will go into the meet trying to shave seconds off of their
times," said Stanford head coach Richard Quick. "We'll
be swimming in a very fast pool, so everyone, including
us, will be looking to post some NCAA qualifying times.
"I can't say if we're going to win or not because they
aren't scoring the meet. All I can say is that this team is
very skilled throughout the line-up and that we should
do very well."
Leading the talented field of swimmers in Austin,
Texas, will be Olympians Jenny Thompson and Ixja
Loveless of Stanford and Whitney Hedgepeth of Texas.
The two Cardinal swimmers amassed five Olympic
medals in the 1992 Barcelona Games.
"Going into this weekend's meet we're not con
cerned about how we place," Thompson said. "We're
going to use this invitational to concentrate on our
races.
"Richard is having us swim a lot of events during the

three-day stretch to see how we react to stress. This pre
pares us for swimming on minimal rest because some of
our events are scheduled very tightly."
On the average, each Cardinal swimmer will be com
peting in five to six events, which includes their
strongest races coupled with a relay and some ofT
events.
"This meet is a gotxl chance for us to get race-tough,"
Quick said. "We're not prepared to swim that fast, but
we're looking forward to a lot of competitions and races."
"Everyone's just going to see how fast they can
swim," Thompson said. "We're definitely trying to
equal some of our best times this season and most of us
are thinking about swimming |NCAA| qualifying
times."
This meet will also be a g<x)d indicator of the NCAA
title. Top-ranked Stanford's closest competitor is the
Texas Ixmghorns squad who senously challenge the
Cardinal last year for the national championship.
Stanford's only other rival for the NCAA crown is
No. 3 Florida. The two squads will not meet until the
NCAA finals, but after finishing third to Texas and
Stanford for the last few years, Florida is ready to chal
lenge for the title.
After the Invitational, the Cardinal will begin a
month of intense winter training in preparation for
their first scored meet of the season against Arizona on
Jan. 15. That dual-meet will also open the Pacific 10
Conference competition, a division that Stanford domi
nated last year with a perfect 10-0 record.
