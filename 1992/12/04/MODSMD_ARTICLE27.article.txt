# Cardinal heads to Texas
## Stanford swimmers go head to head with nation's best 
### Kay Hong 
This weekend, the Stanford
men's swim team will compete
against some of the top swimming
programs in the nation at the
Texas Invitational.
Hosted by the University of
Texas at Austin, the meet will
include squads from Arizona
State, University of Arizona,
Indiana and Kansas.
Although both Arizona teams
pose a potential threat to the
Stanford squad, the former NCAA
champion Texas Longhorns have
been singled out by the Cardinal
as the team to beat.
"We can definitely match up
with them in every event," said
sophomore breaststroke special
ist Kurt Grote.
"I think we're a better team
overall, but they've been swim
ming pretty fast in their dual
meets this season."
The two teams from Arizona

have reportedly rested their ath
letes and are expected to shave
down for the meet in an effort to
qualify for the NCAA champi
onships in the spring.
In order to participate in the
NCAA meet, each athlete must
qualify under a certain cut time
at some point during the season.
However, the Cardinal swim
mers usually try to qualify later
on in the season and as a result,
head coach Skip Kenney has rest
ed his athletes very little in prepa
ration for the Texas meet.
"We haven't done as much
hard swimming as we usually do
for the past couple of days, but
Skip has kept our yardage up,"
Grote said.
"We're training well — we're
really focused as a team— but
we're also doing a lot of training
right now and everyone's pretty
tired. We'll try to swim well
against Texas under those cir
cumstances.

"A lot of people on our team
are not swimming as fast as they
were last year during the early
season. But our good swims in the
past have always depended on our
togetherness as a team. When we
face tougher teams, the competi
tion brings out the best in us," he
added.
The dual meets the Cardinal
has competed in this season
(against Fresno State, California
and the University of Hawaii),
have been relatively easy — a fac
tor that may be reflected in the
team's early-season times. But
this weekend, the level of compe
tition will be raised considerably.
"The team is really fired up,"
Grote said.
"We're trying to treat it as sort
of an unshaved NCAA meet.
We're basically going into the
meet focusing on Texas, but we'll
have to swim very well against all
of the competition there to beat
them."
