## 
### Oscar Dominguez Staff writer 
The Cardinal fencing team
wraps up fall quarter competition
this Saturday by hosting UC-Santa
Cruz. Men's head coach Zoran
Tulum and women's head coach
Sherry Posthumus are confident
about the competition.
"We feel very good about it,"
Posthumus said. "We beat them
last year by the skin of our teeth
with a weak team. We have a very
good chance this year."
The meet will be held at 1 pm at
Roble Gym, and admission to the
event is free, as Stanford prepares
to switch into high gear for its busy
winter schedule.
So far this season, Stanford has
only competed in one meet as a
team, overpowering California over
Big Game weekend.
Despite competing without their
team leaders, the men's and
women's varsity fencing teams
defeated a strong California squad
handily on Nov. 20. The meet

marked the beginning of the '92-'93
season for the Cardinal fencers.
Both the men and women could
not enter their strongest teams
because of tryouts for the U.S.
Fencing Association's junior nation
al team in Kansas. However, even
with team standouts such as seniors
Keith Early and Lana Kang in
Kansas, the men won by a com
bined score of 15-12 and the women
by an even larger margin of 14-2.
The Bears are a club team, and
are not subject to NCAA rules. Con
sequently, their squads are unpre
dictable because anyone can com
pete, including graduate students,
who are often more experienced.
