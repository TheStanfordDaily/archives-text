This Saturday, Stanford hosts the annual sev
ens rugby tournament, a final preseason tune-up
before the opening of league play.
This decades-old Cardinal tradition presents
men's and women's rugby "in its most explosive

form," said coach Frank Boivert.
Over 45 seven-person teams will take part in
14-minute games beginning at 8:30 a.m. Saturday
at Maloney Field and concluding at 1 p.m. with
the collegiate final.
