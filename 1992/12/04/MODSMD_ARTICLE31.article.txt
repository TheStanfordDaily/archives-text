After defeating UC-Davis 21-16
and San Francisco State 20-18
last Tuesday, Stanford's wrestling
team (2-0) will head into the Las
Vegas Invitational today and
tomorrow.
Although the 32-man, single
elimination tournament is not the
NCAA championships, it should
provide a similar kind of challenge
to its participants because it
comes so early in the season.
All the West Coast, Midwest
and some East Coast squads will

attend. Among them lowa, lowa
State, Oklahoma, and Oklahoma
State will compete — teams which
traditionally place in the nation's
top four.
"It's like having the NCAA's
right now," said Cardinal head
coach Chris Horpel.
With last season and prior
years as well, the Stanford squad
has not performed as well in the
Las Vegas tournament as they did
in the NCAA Championship tour
nament. So, with a squad com
prised mostly of freshmen, the
Cardinal views its weekend
matches as a learning experience

and, hopefully, a chance to build
confidence.
"I don't expect much," Horpel
said. "We're never ready for it."
According to the Stanford
coach, most teams will not arrive
at Las Vegas with adequate condi
tioning. As with many schools, the
Cardinal wrestlers improve their
conditioning through regular sea
son matches and conference
championships, finally reaching
their prime at the NCAA meet.
"We can't maintain that level
of conditioning all year," Horpel
said. "We would burn out by
NCAA's."
