# Grad couple sues University, high lead levels cited

### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
A Stanford graduate couple
and an Oakland environmental
law group have sued the Universi
ty, claiming it has knowingly al
lowed levels of lead which "pose a
health threat to all members of
the Stanford University commu
nity" to remain in Escondido Vil
lage.
At a press conference yester
day, Law School student Sarah
Dennison-Leonard, her husband
Charles and members of the Envi
ronmental Law Foundation
(ELF) announced a five-part
class-action suit against Stanford,
seeking unspecified damages.
The suit claims that Stanford is
"negligently conducting activi
ties. . . that led to and are still
leading to risk of lead exposure in
the Escondido Village Complex
Area."
The suit also claims the Uni
versity's "ownership and opera
tion of Escondido Village create a
risk to human health of Escondido
Village residents," especially chil
dren. The couple has a 2-year-old
daughter, Carlie.
Senior University Counsel Lee
Thompson, at a second press con
ference later yesterday, said he
could not comment on the suit
because it had not vet been offi

cially served to the University,
which should happen some time
today. But, he said, "in general,
Stanford has, we believe, acted
responsibly and reasonably. We
are not aware of any unreason
able health risks to the residents,
including the children, in Escon
dido Village."
Both Charles Dennison-
Leonard and his lawyers said they
hope to accomplish two things
through the lawsuit: to get the
University to remove existing lead
hazards in Escondido and to have
the University make regular blood
tests available to insure the health
risk remains low.
Thompson said blood testing
is, in fact, ongoing, and a Univer
sity press release said such tests
are currently being offered at
Cowell Student Health Center.
Carlie was not one of the chil
dren examined under a free blood
testing program that the Univer
sity first offered in March after
conducting studies of Escondido
paint samples.
Of the 50 children that were
tested by the University in March,
none were found to have lead poi
soning.
Carlie — who was indepen
dently tested using samples of her
hair — showed lead "above the
