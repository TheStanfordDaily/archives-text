# Grad couple sues University, high lead levels cited
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
A Stanford graduate couple
and an Oakland environmental
law group have sued the Universi
ty, claiming it has knowingly al
lowed levels of lead which "pose a
health threat to all members of
the Stanford University commu
nity" to remain in Escondido Vil
lage.
At a press conference yester
day, Law School student Sarah
Dennison-Leonard, her husband
Charles and members of the Envi
ronmental Law Foundation
(ELF) announced a five-part
class-action suit against Stanford,
seeking unspecified damages.
The suit claims that Stanford is
"negligently conducting activi
ties. . . that led to and are still
leading to risk of lead exposure in
the Escondido Village Complex
Area."
The suit also claims the Uni
versity's "ownership and opera
tion of Escondido Village create a
risk to human health of Escondido
Village residents," especially chil
dren. The couple has a 2-year-old
daughter, Carlie.
Senior University Counsel Lee
Thompson, at a second press con
ference later yesterday, said he
could not comment on the suit
because it had not vet been offi

cially served to the University,
which should happen some time
today. But, he said, "in general,
Stanford has, we believe, acted
responsibly and reasonably. We
are not aware of any unreason
able health risks to the residents,
including the children, in Escon
dido Village."
Both Charles Dennison-
Leonard and his lawyers said they
hope to accomplish two things
through the lawsuit: to get the
University to remove existing lead
hazards in Escondido and to have
the University make regular blood
tests available to insure the health
risk remains low.
Thompson said blood testing
is, in fact, ongoing, and a Univer
sity press release said such tests
are currently being offered at
Cowell Student Health Center.
Carlie was not one of the chil
dren examined under a free blood
testing program that the Univer
sity first offered in March after
conducting studies of Escondido
paint samples.
Of the 50 children that were
tested by the University in March,
none were found to have lead poi
soning.
Carlie — who was indepen
dently tested using samples of her
hair — showed lead "above the

level that shows no exposure,"
according to ELF president James
Wheaton. But the amount of lead
the test showed was still too small
an amount to cause health danger
according Julie Duncan, staff sci
entist for the ELF. Nevertheless,
the couple decided to go ahead
with the suit based on unaccept
ably high levels of lead found on
swingsets and other eqiupment
near their apartment.
The suit contains five separate
claims, among them a charge that
Stanford is violating California's
Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking
Water and Toxics Enforcement
Act. The act requires businesses
which know of the presence of
substances on their property that
cause cancer or reproductive harm
to warn individuals of such harm.
Damages under Prop. 65 can
run as high as $2,500 per violation
of the act per day.
Other charges accuse the Uni
versity of "negligence" for expos
ing residents to higher-than-per
mitted lead levels and of making
dwellings less liveable, violating
the common law "Warranty of
Habitability" between landlords
and residents.
The suit was filed after tests
conducted both by Stanford and
ELF revealed elevated levels of
lead in the paint in some areas of
Escondido Village.
Figures released by ELF show
that levels in a paint sample taken
from an Escondido swingset range

from as low as .03 percent lead by
weight to as high as 4.8 percent.
Government-regulated safety cut
off levels are either .06 or .5 per
cent by weight, depending on
which government agency's stan
dards are used.
Thompson said Stanford had
performed lead tests beginning
late last year. In March of this
year, Stanford sent Escondido res
idents a letter saying "borderline
or low levels of lead" above gov
ernment-mandated levels had
been found in paint on some inte
rior and exterior surfaces.
The swingsets showed the
highest levels in testing. Accord
ing to Duncan, the problem with
the presence of the leaded paint is
that elevated levels of lead can
cause problems in children,
including lowered IQ and loss of
short-term memory.
Carlie shows none of these
signs of lead poisoning.
Charles Dennison-Leonard said
he was concerned not only by the
presence of lead but by what he
perceived to be the reluctance of
the University to act on the prob
lem.
Wheaton agreed, saying, "Stan
ford doesn't seem to want to do
anything until someone pushes
them hard enough."
But Thompson disagreed, and
said Stanford is currently accept
ing bids from companies to strip
the leaded paint off the about 14
swingsets in Escondido, as well as
remove about 36 benches that
have leaded paint on them.
"To the extent where we felt lead
has been found in the paint... we've
taken steps to deal with it,"he said.

has been found in the paint... we've
taken steps to deal with it,"he said.
A Stanford graduate couple
and an Oakland environmental
law group have sued the Universi
ty, claiming it has knowingly al
lowed levels of lead which "pose a
health threat to all members of
the Stanford University commu
nity" to remain in Escondido Vil
lage.
At a press conference yester
day, Law School student Sarah
Dennison-Leonard, her husband
Charles and members of the Envi
ronmental Law Foundation
(ELF) announced a five-part
class-action suit against Stanford,
seeking unspecified damages.
The suit claims that Stanford is
"negligently conducting activi
ties. . . that led to and are still
leading to risk of lead exposure in
the Escondido Village Complex
Area."
The suit also claims the Uni
versity's "ownership and opera
tion of Escondido Village create a
risk to human health of Escondido
Village residents," especially chil
dren. The couple has a 2-year-old
daughter, Carlie.
Senior University Counsel Lee
Thompson, at a second press con
ference later yesterday, said he
could not comment on the suit
because it had not vet been offi

cially served to the University,
which should happen some time
today. But, he said, "in general,
Stanford has, we believe, acted
responsibly and reasonably. We
are not aware of any unreason
able health risks to the residents,
including the children, in Escon
dido Village."
Both Charles Dennison-
Leonard and his lawyers said they
hope to accomplish two things
through the lawsuit: to get the
University to remove existing lead
hazards in Escondido and to have
the University make regular blood
tests available to insure the health
risk remains low.
Thompson said blood testing
is, in fact, ongoing, and a Univer
sity press release said such tests
are currently being offered at
Cowell Student Health Center.
Carlie was not one of the chil
dren examined under a free blood
testing program that the Univer
sity first offered in March after
conducting studies of Escondido
paint samples.
Of the 50 children that were
tested by the University in March,
none were found to have lead poi
soning.
Carlie — who was indepen
dently tested using samples of her
hair — showed lead "above the

level that shows no exposure,"
according to ELF president James
Wheaton. But the amount of lead
the test showed was still too small
an amount to cause health danger
according Julie Duncan, staff sci
entist for the ELF. Nevertheless,
the couple decided to go ahead
with the suit based on unaccept
ably high levels of lead found on
swingsets and other eqiupment
near their apartment.
The suit contains five separate
claims, among them a charge that
Stanford is violating California's
Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking
Water and Toxics Enforcement
Act. The act requires businesses
which know of the presence of
substances on their property that
cause cancer or reproductive harm
to warn individuals of such harm.
Damages under Prop. 65 can
run as high as $2,500 per violation
of the act per day.
Other charges accuse the Uni
versity of "negligence" for expos
ing residents to higher-than-per
mitted lead levels and of making
dwellings less liveable, violating
the common law "Warranty of
Habitability" between landlords
and residents.
The suit was filed after tests
conducted both by Stanford and
ELF revealed elevated levels of
lead in the paint in some areas of
Escondido Village.
Figures released by ELF show
that levels in a paint sample taken
from an Escondido swingset range

from as low as .03 percent lead by
weight to as high as 4.8 percent.
Government-regulated safety cut
off levels are either .06 or .5 per
cent by weight, depending on
which government agency's stan
dards are used.
Thompson said Stanford had
performed lead tests beginning
late last year. In March of this
year, Stanford sent Escondido res
idents a letter saying "borderline
or low levels of lead" above gov
ernment-mandated levels had
been found in paint on some inte
rior and exterior surfaces.
The swingsets showed the
highest levels in testing. Accord
ing to Duncan, the problem with
the presence of the leaded paint is
that elevated levels of lead can
cause problems in children,
including lowered IQ and loss of
short-term memory.
Carlie shows none of these
signs of lead poisoning.
Charles Dennison-Leonard said
he was concerned not only by the
presence of lead but by what he
perceived to be the reluctance of
the University to act on the prob
lem.
Wheaton agreed, saying, "Stan
ford doesn't seem to want to do
anything until someone pushes
them hard enough."
But Thompson disagreed, and
said Stanford is currently accept
ing bids from companies to strip
the leaded paint off the about 14
swingsets in Escondido, as well as
remove about 36 benches that
have leaded paint on them.
