# Committee will assess fiscal damage to libraries

After three years of crippling bud
get cuts to Stanford's libraries, the
Faculty Senate committee that super
vises the libraries will focus this year
on assessing the damage.
Following the Committee on Li
braries' annual report to the senate, a
40-minute discussion ensued in which
senators, troubled by cutbacks that
have slashed nearly a quarter of the li
braries' budget, urged the committee
to examine the effects of the cuts.
Many said they are worried that
the cuts will damage the quality of
Stanford's book collection, lead to
shortened library hours and do ir
reparable harm to Meyer Library.
History Prof. Keith Baker, the
committee's chair, told the senators
that the committee will address those
concerns this year by "monitoring the
effect of those cuts" and insuring they
are not going too far.
Robert Street, vice provost for li
braries and information resources,
said that library hours have not been
cut much this year. He added that as
soon as construction in Meyer is fin
ished, an experiment to turn its first
floor into a 24-hour study hall will
begin.
As an undergraduate library,
though, English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said Meyer has "virtually disap
peared." He urged the committee to
pay particular attention to the cuts'
effects on Meyer.
But Director of Academic Informa
tion Services Karen Nagy said it will

be difficult to assess whether the cuts
are driving students away from
Meyer, since the trend of more under
graduates using Green Library in
stead of Meyer began before budget
cuts.
French and Italian Prof. Hans
Gumbrecht questioned the entire idea
of having a separate undergraduate li
brary, wondering whether it sent the
wrong signal. "It's like undergradu

ates have dirty hands," he said. "We
don't want them to touch the books
we touch."
But Art Prof. Albert Elsen argued
that Meyer should be the centerpiece
of an effort to create a "greater sense
of intellectual identity" among under
graduates. The "heart" of that identi
ty, Elsen said, should be "the library,
not the football stadium or the book
store."
The senate also examined the cuts'
effect on library hours, discussing
whether shortening them had been
detrimental to undergraduates. "I'm
worried that we really shut down our
libraries in terms of having them
available" for undergraduates, said
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare.
"What's that saying about our values
and priorities?"
He suggested that libraries remain
open very late for studying, and cut
costs by not allowing checkout of

books during the night. "That's very
useful to people," Zare said.
The budget cuts' effect on the qual
ity of Stanford's book collection was
also discussed yesterday vln particu
lar, the library committee's report
said they are concerned with the
Hoover Institution's decision to stop
collecting in the Latin Americas and
the "uncertainty" regarding its com
mitment to its Middle East collec-

tions.
The library system plans to allocate
$20,000 to augment the Latin Ameri
can collection, but does not have any
additional funds for Middle East ma
terials, according to the report.
History Prof. David Kennedy called
the additional money for the Latin
American collection "very good
news," but added that he is disap
pointed by the lack of funds for the
Middle East collection.
He said the decision did not reflect
the addition of two new faculty mem
bers — one already appointed and the
other to be appointed shortly — who
specialize in Middle Eastern studies.
"When you interrupt the process of
collections, it is enormously expensive
to restart it at a later date," Kennedy
said. "I hope that something can be
done to continue collecting in that
area."
English Prof. David Riggs, the li-

brary committee's chair last year, said
Hoover is continuing to collect Middle
East materials this year — but the col
lection faces a far more uncertain fate
next year, when it must look for out
side funding.
In other senate business, Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper reported
that the new "associate dean of gradu
ate policy" — who will be responsible
for coordinating graduate student is
sues — will be appointed by the new
dean of research.
A replacement for current Dean of
Research Robert Byer, who an
nounced his resignation in October, is
expected to be found by January.
Casper said the new dean will be asked
to "move swiftly" to pick the associate
dean.
Casper had announced the cre
ation of the new position at an ASSU
Senate meeting Tuesday night.
"There are general issues about the
treatment of graduate students at
Stanford that need a person who will
be responsible for that," Casper told
the Faculty Senate yesterday, ex
plaining the move.
He apologized to the senators for
announcing the new post at an ASSU
meeting rather than to the Faculty
Senate first. Casper quipped that he
had no choice: the ASSU senators put
him through "an examination of
'President 101' with 15 grueling ques
tions."
Graduate senator Derek Miyahara,
an ASSU representative to the Facul
ty Senate, then told Casper to wide
laughter that he wanted him to know,
on behalf of the ASSU, that "he had
gotten an A+ in 'President 101.' "
