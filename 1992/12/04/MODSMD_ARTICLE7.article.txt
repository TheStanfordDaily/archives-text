# Techie double standards
## Gender bias, obstacles remain in engineering 
### Elisa Nino-Murcia Staff writer 
" Why?" is quickly becoming a
question senior Gwen Byard is
sick of hearing.
Upon finding out that she is
mooring in electrical engineering,
people "always seem really sur
prised," said Byard. "I get a lot of
'why's.' That's a little disconcert
ing."
Similar surprise exists even
among engineering students
themselves. Sophomore Steve Hy
chong said the first thing that
crosses his mind when he sees a fe
male in one of his physics or math
classes is "Wow, a woman!" But
this surprise is warranted, accord
ing to recent statistics.
A 1992 study conducted by the
American Association of Engi
neering Societies shows that, na
tionally, women comprise less
than 20% of undergraduate engi
neering majors. At Stanford, fe
males represent about 25% of the
making Stanford one of the
most balanced engineering de
partments in the nation. In some

departments, such as industrial
and mechanical engineering,
women comprise 30 to 34 percent
of the students.
Nevertheless, the number of
women in engineering is not in
creasing as quickly as it statistical
ly should be compared to the num
ber of females entering college,
raising questions about what's
stopping talented women from
pursuing engineering.
For many women, the obstacles
to becoming an engineer are man
ifold: a lack of role models, gender
bias in the Scholastic Aptitude
Test, and studies attempting to
prove female mental inferiority
are only a few of the factors that
observers say lead to few female
engineering majors in universi
ties.
"There's a stereotype that only
men can be engineers," said Dr.
Noe Lozano, associate dean of stu
dent affairs, affirmative action
and minority programs for Stan
ford's Engineering School. "And
that only guys can be cold and ob-

jective. There's a little bit of that
cultural baggage that we haven't let
goof."
Taking apart Barbie dolls
Some say the tendency to view
engineering as masculine in nature
might be rooted in early childhood,
when girls are traditionally encour
aged to play with such toys as Bar
bie dolls while boys hone their con
struction skills with Legos.
"Parents do not have to teach
their female children auto mechan
ics in order to encourage their pur
suit of math and science," said
Lazano. "There's nothing wrong
with young girls taking apart their
Barbie dolls.
"By taking apart their 'femi
nine' toys, these girls seem to be
showing just as much of an interest
in engineering as a boy taking apart
his bike," said Lazano. "It's just a
concept of manipulating, rotating,
watching and wanting to know how
things are put together, how you
take them apart and how you make
them work," said Lozano. "You can
get that out of any ordinary thing a
girl might be exposed to. [What is
important is] sustaining that kind
of interest."
Differences in gender perception
can start as early as birth. Sherri
Matteo, deputy director of The
Institute of Women and Gender,
described a study done at Stanford
Hospital in which parents were
asked to describe their newborns.
"The parents who had girls
claimed they were whiter, softer, and
more passive compared to the new
born boys even though there was no
objective difference," said Matteo.
Matteo added however, that a
causal link between such early gen
der differences and the disparity of
women in technical fields would be
tenuous. "I think it really begins to
start early on in the classroom.
Boys are encourage to ask more
questions while girls are usually
looked to for one-word answers,"
she said. "This leads to different
types of thinking. As grows older
the situation pretty much stays the
same. It's reinforced by a lack of
role models."
Dr. Anne Kiremidjian, professor
of civil engineering and co-director
of the Blume Earthquake Engi
neering Center, agreed.
"I'd like to see more women fac-

ulty. Our female stu
dents are grateful to
see four women in
the [civil engineer
ing! department.
More role models are
needed," she said.
Unlike many
women deterred
from technical fields,
Kiremidjian said,
"When I was a child,
I was led to believe
[that girls] are no
different than boys.
"I was led to
believe I could do
anything my brother
could. If my brother
was hammering, I
was expected to
hammer too." re
called Kiremidjian,
who is one of twelve
women professors
(out of a faculty of
200) in the School of
Engineering.
"It really makes a
big difference when
you see a woman pro
fessor up on stage,"
said senior Jane Lin,
a computer science
major who says she
seeks out female aca
demic advisers. "You
can find male profes
sors who are sympa
thetic, but that
doesn't make them
encouraging."

Still, Lozano insisted that "there
are many men faculty members
whose aim, their sort of cause, is to
change that," Lozano said. "That's
one of the untapped pools of energy
— professors who are male who are
very supportive [of women]... But
Lozano added that, on behalf of
many male faculty members,
"there's a view that if you are seen
as the problem, because you're
male, then how are you supposed to
get involved?"
Skewed Expectations
Another problem arises out of
"an expectations issue," said
Lozano. "If [women] don't do
exceedingly well, like A's and B
plusses, and they get lower grades,
then they tend not to stay in engi
neering," he said, adding that
sometimes professorial expecta
tions for women might be higher.
"The ones that stay in engineer
ing tend to be the stronger ones,
not the ones in the middle. The bot-

torn [grade] group and the middle
group tend to drop out. Less men
drop out for this reason."
A female engineering student,
who preferred to remain anony
mous, was urged by her freshmen
advisor to switch majors. "I got a B
in math one quarter, and a B+ the
next quarter," she explained. "And
he said to me 'You seem to be get
ting B's... maybe you should con
sider doing something else' " out of
the technical area.
If some advisors have unfairly
high expectations, others have
insultingly low ones.
"My freshmen advisor was very
skeptical about how well I could
do," said a senior engineering
major, who preferred to remain
anonymous. "He made me repeat a
math class I clearly did not need to
repeat. He told me 'Don't try to do
so much. Take 14 units. Women try
to overwork themselves too
much,' " she added. "The fact that
he didn't believe I could do it was
frustrating. I ended up depending
more on myself."

The Old Boys Techie Club
Self-reliance seems to be a
theme for many female engineers
who sense a lack of support not
only from professors, but from
peers as well.
"I think guys tend to more
buddy-buddy when it comes to
techie stuff," said Lin. "Where
there's a group of them and it's just
me they sometimes act like I'm not
there. It used to bother me, but
now I just ignore it."
Lin added that "techie" classes
bring out an overly-zealous compet
itive streak in certain male stu
dents. "There's the whole attitude
of wanting to show-off and put
down women, if not purposefully,
as a result."
Such put-downs are often
ingrained in a perception of women
as being less competent scientists
who can't compete with men.
"Based on experience, I have not
met that many female scientists
who are extremely bright. A lot of
guys I talk to have the same view as
I do," explained Hychong.
In addition, females being the
center of attention in graduate
admissions is quickly becoming a
point of resentment for male stu
dents. Affirmative Action "quotas"
for engineering schools and busi
nesses seem unfair to Hychong.
"The standards for females
seem lower than the ones for males
because not enough women are
interested," said Hychong. "I get
kinda mad, because here I am, try
ing to work harder to get into the
same school."
Lozano said that he has dealt
with formal complaints about "pro
fessors passing out examinations to
women first, so that they could
have 'a leg up' in the process since
there are so few of them." On the
other hand, he is also aware of
informal complaints "in the halls"
about women using their feminini
ty to get a leg up.
No halo effect for women
As well as often being perceived as
less competent by their male peers,
some women feel professors under
estimated their ability.
"There's a halo effect that
males are good at math and sci
ence," Lozano explained. "When
they're in the classroom, they're
already getting the benefit of the
doubt. So [women] have to dis
prove the halo theory. Women are
the opposite. They don't have that
halo effect."
