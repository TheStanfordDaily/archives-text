# Techie double standards
## Gender bias, obstacles remain in engineering

" Why?" is quickly becoming a
question senior Gwen Byard is
sick of hearing.
Upon finding out that she is
mooring in electrical engineering,
people "always seem really sur
prised," said Byard. "I get a lot of
'why's.' That's a little disconcert
ing."
Similar surprise exists even
among engineering students
themselves. Sophomore Steve Hy
chong said the first thing that
crosses his mind when he sees a fe
male in one of his physics or math
classes is "Wow, a woman!" But
this surprise is warranted, accord
ing to recent statistics.
A 1992 study conducted by the
American Association of Engi
neering Societies shows that, na
tionally, women comprise less
than 20% of undergraduate engi
neering majors. At Stanford, fe
males represent about 25% of the
making Stanford one of the
most balanced engineering de
partments in the nation. In some

departments, such as industrial
and mechanical engineering,
women comprise 30 to 34 percent
of the students.
Nevertheless, the number of
women in engineering is not in
creasing as quickly as it statistical
ly should be compared to the num
ber of females entering college,
raising questions about what's
stopping talented women from
pursuing engineering.
For many women, the obstacles
to becoming an engineer are man
ifold: a lack of role models, gender
bias in the Scholastic Aptitude
Test, and studies attempting to
prove female mental inferiority
are only a few of the factors that
observers say lead to few female
engineering majors in universi
ties.
"There's a stereotype that only
men can be engineers," said Dr.
Noe Lozano, associate dean of stu
dent affairs, affirmative action
and minority programs for Stan
ford's Engineering School. "And
that only guys can be cold and ob-
