Tanker crash spills oil
LA CORUNA, Spain (AP) — A Greek tanker
crashed onto rocks outside a fog-shrouded har
bor entrance yesterday, breaking apart in heavy
seas and spilling millions of gallons of crude oil
that threatened the area's rich fishing grounds.
Hundreds fled their homes after an explosion
tore the stern loose from the 53,964-ton Aegean
Sea and set off an inferno a few yards offshore
five hours after the ship ran aground. All 29
crew members were rescued, officials said.
A burning oil slick ran alongside the
tanker. Authorities said an oil slick 1.2 miles
wide stretched 12 miles northeastward up the
Galician coast. Environmentalists expressed
fears for fishing, the most important industry
in the region.
Lledo said ship captain Constantine
Stavrides was held for questioning.
The tanker was carrying nearly 23.8 million
gallons of crude oil. The environmental organi
zation Greenpeace compared the threat from
the Aegean Sea to the Exxon Valdez spill.
Egypt fights terrorism
CAIRO, Egypt (AP) — A military court yes
terday sentenced eight Muslim militants to
death and four to life imprisonment in the first
test of a new anti-terrorist law.
The law was enacted in the summer to
counter a rise in extremist violence, which has
killed at least 77 people and wounded more than
120 this year.
