77ie Stanford Department of Mathematics announces the 1993
Karel de Leeuw Memorial Lecture
ROGER PENROSE
(OXFORD UNIVERSITY)
"Magic Dodecahedra and the Mystery of Quantum Entanglement"
Roger Penrose is the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at Oxford. He is equally famous for his
work on cosmology, his discovery of "Penrose tiles", and his recent book, The Emperor's New Mind.
His early work inspired the first contributions of Stephen Hawking, and they became close
collaborators. More recently, he pioneered an important new subject, "twistor theory". He has been
the recipient of many awards, including the prestigious Wolf Prize in physics, which he shared with
Stephen Hawking. His lecture is intended for a general audience.
