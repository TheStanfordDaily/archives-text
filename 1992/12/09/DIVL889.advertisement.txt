TRILOGY
DEVELOPMENT GROUP
WHO IS TRILOGY?
Three years ago five Stanford
students got together and started
Trilogy Development Group. Now
headquartered in Austin, TX, Trilogy
is one of the hottest and fastest
growing software companies in the
country. We have over 60 employees and
will be doubling in size over 1993.
The Wall Street Journal recently featured
Trilogy's software as "changing the way business
is done." Forbes columnist, Esther Dyson, writes
"(Trilogy has) a virtually unassailable market position..
Company's biggest challenge is... keeping humble."
"Your
Frend"
Since we're from Stanford, we know
where to find the best people and
we'll do just about anything to get
them, including paying you for
turning in" your friends! Send us a
cover letter with your friend's resume,
explaining why we should care about
your friend. If we end up hiring your
friend based on your initial introduction,
Trilogy will give you a $1000 reward!
No, you can't turn yourself in. We know you think you're
great. We only want to talk to you if other people think you're
great too. Start bribing. ■
JOB DESCRIPTIONS
Development
If your friend wants no part in adding 10
boring features to Excel 5.0, Trilogy's
Development team may be the place for
your friend. Trilogy developers work with
'bleeding" edge technology to solve pro
blems no one else has figured out. This
eclectic group of college drop-outs to

trickiest brain teasers, Trilogy's Consulting
team would like to put your friend's logic to
the test. Using the latest in client-server and
object-oriented technologies (NOT Cobol!),

ware systems that save Fortune 500 compa

together a more innovative and aggres
sive recruiting campaign than this, then
Trilogy's Sales and Marketing team wants
to meet your friend. Our sales team closes
multi-million dollar deals that are signed
off by the CEO. Our marketing team
evangelizes the product and market, con
