The Cardinal will finish off the
inaugural season of the Bill Walsh
era just when it had hoped to â€”
New Year's Day. In a battle between
legendary coaches, Stanford will
face Joe Paterno and his Penn State
club in the Jan. 1 Blockbuster Bowl
at Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium.
It will be the first New Year's
Day appearance for the Cardinal
since the 1972 Rose Bowl, and Stan
ford will have a chance to post its
first 10-win season in over 50 years.
The Blockbuster match-up had
been projected for weeks, and
Walsh, for one, couldn't be happi

" It's a big game against a top uni
versity with a great coach," Walsh
said. "This is an ideal bowl for Stan
ford. Virtually everyone playing in
the Blockbuster Bowl will graduate
and become a productive person.
"College football presidents and
administrators can look at this
game and see that you don't have
to take shortcuts to build a win
ning team. You can have a compet
itive intercollgiate program with
out being a mercenary program."
The Cardinal, who finished the
year 9-3, moved up one spot to No.

up ranked No. 21 with a 7-4 record,
but three of their losses were by a
field goal or less. They fell 17-14 to
top-ranked Miami in October and
lost 17-16 at Notre Dame on a last
second two-point conversion.
