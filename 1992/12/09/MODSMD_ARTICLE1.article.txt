# Cardinal gets spot in bowl
## 
### Kevin Jeffery Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal will finish off the
inaugural season of the Bill Walsh
era just when it had hoped to —
New Year's Day. In a battle between
legendary coaches, Stanford will
face Joe Paterno and his Penn State
club in the Jan. 1 Blockbuster Bowl
at Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium.
It will be the first New Year's
Day appearance for the Cardinal
since the 1972 Rose Bowl, and Stan
ford will have a chance to post its
first 10-win season in over 50 years.
The Blockbuster match-up had
been projected for weeks, and
Walsh, for one, couldn't be happi
er about facing the Nittany Lions.
" It's a big game against a top uni
versity with a great coach," Walsh
said. "This is an ideal bowl for Stan
ford. Virtually everyone playing in
the Blockbuster Bowl will graduate
and become a productive person.
"College football presidents and
administrators can look at this
game and see that you don't have
to take shortcuts to build a win
ning team. You can have a compet
itive intercollgiate program with
out being a mercenary program."
The Cardinal, who finished the
year 9-3, moved up one spot to No.
13 in the final regular season Asso
ciated Press poll. Penn State wound
up ranked No. 21 with a 7-4 record,
but three of their losses were by a
field goal or less. They fell 17-14 to
top-ranked Miami in October and
lost 17-16 at Notre Dame on a last
second two-point conversion.
The Nittanv Lions, in their last
season as an independent before joining the
Big 10, found themselves locked out of the
bowl picture when the Bowl Coalition
was formed in the off-season. As a result,
Penn State signed a deal to go the Block
buster before the season had even begun.
Paterno was pleased when Stanford was
named his New Year's Day foe on Sunday.
"We hoped it would be Stanford. They're a
great team and a fine institution."
Stanford, however, almost found itself in
more lucrative surroundings, that is,
among the Bowl Coaltion's elite echelon.
Saturday, on the final day of regular season
play across the countiy, Florida nearly top
pled No. 2 Alabama in the Southeastern
Conference Championship Game.
A Florida win (coalition sources indicat
ed) would have sent the Cardinal to the
Orange Bowl to face Nebraska. Included in
that Orange package was not only a prime
time New Year's Day appearance, but also a
per team payoff of $4.2 million.
Instead, Stanford will play at 10:30 a.m.
PST (broadcast on CBS) and will receive
$1.5 million with its Blockbuster bid.
Still, a New Year's Day bid has been the
Cardinal's mission since the season's late-
August beginnings, and it can take pride in
a mission accomplished. It marks the first
time since 1977-78 — Walsh's first stint on
the Farm — that Stanford has made con
secutive bowl appearances. And this sea
son's Blockbuster bid is a substantial
improvement over the 1991 Aloha Bowl
appearance.
Perhaps most impressive about Stan
ford's 1992 campaign is that it was accom
plished against one of the nation's most
brutal schedules. Seven of the Cardinal's

opponents — Texas A&M, Notre Dame,
Washington, USC, Arizona, Washington
State and Oregon — will compete in post
season bowl games. The Pacific 10 Confer
ence will send more teams (six) to bowl
games than any other.
But schedule strength is one thing Walsh
feels the new Bowl Coalition hardly takes into
account, and that fact drew a bit of his ire
after Sunday's announcements were made.
"Rankings didn't used to mean as much
as they do now," Walsh said. "Before, you
played in the Rose, Gator or Bluebonnet
Bowl and that was an event in itself.
"Now, everyone is caught up in the rank
ings. Teams schedule subpar opponents to
move up. The way schedules are made is
very distressing to me. If we'd have pulled
Texas A&M from our schedule, played
someone else and beaten them 66-0, we'd be
in the top 10."
Walsh's remarks were most likely aimed
at Colorado, with whom the Cardinal was
reportedly in the running for a coveted Fies
ta Bowl berth. The Buffaloes failed to beat a
team that finished the year in the nation's
top 25, but wound up 9-1-1 and ranked No.
10. They will play No. 6 Syracuse in Tempe
on Jan. 1.
Nittany Lion Notes: Penn State has
been led offensively by star running back
Richie Anderson, who was forced to shoul
der an extra burden when the Lions lost
starting quarterback John Sacca midway
through the season. Anderson gained 900
yards on the ground this season and scored
19 touchdowns, which put him among the
nation's scoring leaders.

Cardinal's mission since the season's late-
August beginnings, and it can take pride in
a mission accomplished. It marks the first
time since 1977-78 — Walsh's first stint on
the Farm — that Stanford has made con
secutive bowl appearances. And this sea
son's Blockbuster bid is a substantial
improvement over the 1991 Aloha Bowl
appearance.
Perhaps most impressive about Stan
ford's 1992 campaign is that it was accom
plished against one of the nation's most
brutal schedules. Seven of the Cardinal's

opponents — Texas A&M, Notre Dame,
Washington, USC, Arizona, Washington
State and Oregon — will compete in post
season bowl games. The Pacific 10 Confer
ence will send more teams (six) to bowl
games than any other.
But schedule strength is one thing Walsh
feels the new Bowl Coalition hardly takes into
account, and that fact drew a bit of his ire
after Sunday's announcements were made.
"Rankings didn't used to mean as much
as they do now," Walsh said. "Before, you
played in the Rose, Gator or Bluebonnet
Bowl and that was an event in itself.
"Now, everyone is caught up in the rank
ings. Teams schedule subpar opponents to
move up. The way schedules are made is
very distressing to me. If we'd have pulled
Texas A&M from our schedule, played
someone else and beaten them 66-0, we'd be
in the top 10."
Walsh's remarks were most likely aimed
at Colorado, with whom the Cardinal was
reportedly in the running for a coveted Fies
ta Bowl berth. The Buffaloes failed to beat a
team that finished the year in the nation's
top 25, but wound up 9-1-1 and ranked No.
10. They will play No. 6 Syracuse in Tempe
on Jan. 1.
Nittany Lion Notes: Penn State has
been led offensively by star running back
Richie Anderson, who was forced to shoul
der an extra burden when the Lions lost
starting quarterback John Sacca midway
through the season. Anderson gained 900
yards on the ground this season and scored
19 touchdowns, which put him among the
nation's scoring leaders.

All-American Glyn Milburn and the Stanford Cardinal will head to Miami over Winter Break looking to slay Penn State's
Nittany Lions in the Blockbuster Bowl Jan. 1.
linebacker Ron George was
named a first team Ail-American
and free safety John Lynch a sec
ond team selection, both by Foot

ball News.
George and Lynch were also
both named first team All-Pac-10,
along with tailback Glyn Milburn.
Cornerback Darrien Gordon and
offensive lineman Chirs Dalman
were second team choices, and
Milburn was named as the second
team kick returner.
The Cardinal will finish off the
inaugural season of the Bill Walsh
era just when it had hoped to —
New Year's Day. In a battle between
legendary coaches, Stanford will
face Joe Paterno and his Penn State
club in the Jan. 1 Blockbuster Bowl
at Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium.
It will be the first New Year's
Day appearance for the Cardinal
since the 1972 Rose Bowl, and Stan
ford will have a chance to post its
first 10-win season in over 50 years.
The Blockbuster match-up had
been projected for weeks, and
Walsh, for one, couldn't be happi
er about facing the Nittany Lions.
" It's a big game against a top uni
versity with a great coach," Walsh
said. "This is an ideal bowl for Stan
ford. Virtually everyone playing in
the Blockbuster Bowl will graduate
and become a productive person.
"College football presidents and
administrators can look at this
game and see that you don't have
to take shortcuts to build a win
ning team. You can have a compet
itive intercollgiate program with
out being a mercenary program."
The Cardinal, who finished the
year 9-3, moved up one spot to No.
13 in the final regular season Asso
ciated Press poll. Penn State wound
up ranked No. 21 with a 7-4 record,
but three of their losses were by a
field goal or less. They fell 17-14 to
top-ranked Miami in October and
lost 17-16 at Notre Dame on a last
second two-point conversion.
The Nittanv Lions, in their last
season as an independent before joining the
Big 10, found themselves locked out of the
bowl picture when the Bowl Coalition
was formed in the off-season. As a result,
Penn State signed a deal to go the Block
buster before the season had even begun.
Paterno was pleased when Stanford was
named his New Year's Day foe on Sunday.
"We hoped it would be Stanford. They're a
great team and a fine institution."
Stanford, however, almost found itself in
more lucrative surroundings, that is,
among the Bowl Coaltion's elite echelon.
Saturday, on the final day of regular season
play across the countiy, Florida nearly top
pled No. 2 Alabama in the Southeastern
Conference Championship Game.
A Florida win (coalition sources indicat
ed) would have sent the Cardinal to the
Orange Bowl to face Nebraska. Included in
that Orange package was not only a prime
time New Year's Day appearance, but also a
per team payoff of $4.2 million.
Instead, Stanford will play at 10:30 a.m.
PST (broadcast on CBS) and will receive
$1.5 million with its Blockbuster bid.
