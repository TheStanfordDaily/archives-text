## Clinton balances Somalia, economy 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
President-elect Clinton said
yesterday his presidency will
inevitably be distracted by
world problems such as Soma
lia and Bosnia, even as he tries
to keep his focus on rebuilding
the U.S. economy.
"I believe our administration
will be forced to spend a lot of
time on foreign policy whether
we want to or not," he said.
"On balance, it is a wonderful
thing that the Cold War is over,"
Clinton said. But with the end of
the U.S.-Soviet domination of
international affairs, he said,
"there is more chaos in the
world than there used to be."
"Some of it is very good and
positive and leads to bubbling
up of market economies and
personal freedoms. But some of
it is very troubling," he said.
Clinton's remarks came as
American troops were prepar
ing to enter Somalia and make
way for food deliveries to the
starving, in a nation where
government has collapsed and
feuding warlords have foiled
private relief efforts.
Clinton, visiting Democratic
members of Congress yester
day on his second post-election
trip to the Capitol, reiterated
his support for President
Bush's decision to launch the
operation and said he expected
to face similar situations.
The president-elect spoke at
a news conference with con
gressional leaders following
several hours of meetings in
the Capitol. He later visited the

Supreme Court and met with
his transition team.
At the Capitol, Clinton said
he wanted to make clear he did
not want international affairs
to dominate his domestic prior
ities, but to ignore them would
only hurt the United States in
the long run."I might have to
spend all my time on foreign
policy. And I don't want that to
happen," he said.
"The dividing line between
foreign and domestic policy is
increasingly blurred," he said.
Clinton signaled his deter
mination to push for a long
term economic stimulus plan,
saying "we are nowhere near to
knowing" whether the nation
is out of the recession for good.
"I based my whole campaign
on my absolute conviction that
the fundamental economic prob
lems of this countiy are long
term problems that have been
20 years in the making," he said.
Clinton's two-day Washing
ton visit, which he was wrapping
up last night, was focused almost
entirely on the domestic side. He
spent time on Capitol Hill
cementing relationships with
the lawmakers who will help
determine the success of his ini
tiatives including the economy,
health care and education.
Without exception, Democrat
ic members of Congress predict
ed Clinton would find a fertile
environment for his proposals.
"I can predict that we will
have an enormously successful
legislative season," said House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley.
