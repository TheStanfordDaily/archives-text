MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP)
— Mobbed by media rather than
militiamen, U.S. Marines began
landing by moonlight early today
to begin an armed mission of
mercy to feed Somalia's starving
millions. Not a shot was fired as
the troops moved swiftly to seize
Mogadishu's airport.
Amphibious vehicles came out of
the Indian Ocean and rolled up
onto the tarmac. As helicopters bat
tered the sky, a few vehicles sped
across the airport's single airstrip
and pulled up near the main termi
nal. Troops poured out and raced
into position near the main gate.
Four hours earlier, a recon
naissance team of 20 Navy frog
men and Marines had come out of
the sea at Mogadishu.
The special forces team —
faces smeared with black and
green camouflage cream, and
armed with automatic rifles, anti
tank missiles and machine guns
— was surrounded by journalists.
The Marines planned to take
control of the airport and harbor
area in order to seize vital gate
ways for international aid and get
food, medicine and other supplies
moving to those Somalis who
need it most.
More than 300,000 Somalis
already have died in one of histo
ry's most savage famines and the
United Nations says 2 million
more are at risk of starvation.
Although they expected no
major confrontations with
Mogadishu's thousands of armed
young militiamen, the Americans
were taking no chances. Com
manders made it clear they would
shoot first if threatened.

But the troops didn't know
whether they ultimately would be
fighting or feeding Somalis. And
they didn't know how long they
would stay. The Bush administra
tion has spoken of ending the
operation by Jan. 20, but many
expect it to extend months into
President Clinton's term.
Scores of clansmen departed
the airport with their heavy
weapons well before the U.S.
arrival. They were leaving behind
a cash cow they had milked for
months through exorbitant
demands for landing and cargo
handling fees.
Both the port and airport have
been closed sporadically by clan
fighting and other violence since
the United Nations began its mas
sive relief effort in March.
Once the ports are firmly
under control, the way will be
paved for an airlift of up to 27,000
more U.S. troops to seize other
key installations and protect
truck convoys of food.
They will be part of a U.S.-led
coalition operating under U.N.
auspices that will include troops
from France, Canada, Italy, Bel
gium and Egypt.
Mogadishu's two major war
lords, Gen. Mohamed Farrah
Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed,
had both pledged to have their
militiamen cooperate with the
U.S. troops. However, both con
ceded that they are not in full con
trol of the city.
Aidid and Ali Mahdi signed a
U.N.-brokered cease-fire in early
March that ended more than four
months of heavy fighting and left
the shattered capital divided.

The cease-fire ended the artillery
and mortar shellings of each other's
positions, but barely dampened the
noise of small-arms fire.
Looters have stolen up to half
of the more than 220,000 metric
tons of food and other supplies
sent to Somalia so far this year.
On Oct. 12, the United Nations
announced an accelerated plan to

deliver 100,000 metric tons of aid
to save an estimated 250,000 peo
ple who might die without it
before the end of the year.
But that plan has been largely
stymied by increased looting and
new outbreaks of fighting between
rival clans in the interior of south
ern Somalia and the closing of
Mogadishu's port and airport.
