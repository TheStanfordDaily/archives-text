# India fights to halt religious violence
## 
### 
NEW DELHI, India (AP) â€” The government
cracked down on Hindu radicals yesterday in an
effort to halt religious violence triggered by the
destruction of a Muslim mosque. A second day of riot
ing pushed the death toll past 400.
In a rare step, the government of Prime Minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao authorized security forces to shoot
rioters on sight in Bombay and Bhopal. There were no
immediate reports of large-scale shooting by police.
The moves aimed at Hindu radicals threatened to
provoke a backlash in this Hindu-dominated nation
that could worsen violence fed by Muslim anger over
the destruction of the mosque.
Hindu fundamentalists reacted angrily to Rao's
decision to rebuild the 16th-century Babri mosque,
which was razed Sunday in the town of Ayodhya by
thousands of Hindus. The zealots say the mosque
was built on the birthplace of their god Rama.
Federal troops moved in yesterday to clear Hindu
extremists and holy men from the ruins of the mosque.
Hindu passions also were fanned by the arrest of
the top leaders of a Hindu nationalist party yesterday
and by news reports of Muslims wrecking and burning
dozens of Hindu temples in Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Indian news agencies said violence had abated only
slightly since Monday, and reported more than 400
deaths in the two days of rioting. Soldiers patrolled
the streets of a dozen towns, assisting civilian police.
An estimated 10 million people spent a second day
indoors under curfew.

protest over the demolition of the Babri mosque in India Sunday.
