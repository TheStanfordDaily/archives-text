Avalanche kills 40
LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — An avalanche of rain-soaked mud
buried a gold mining camp in the Andean foothills yesterday,
killing at least 40 people. Hundreds of people may be missing, said
a mining official.
The landslide, caused by torrential rains, covered the remote
camp of Llipi, about 80 miles north of La Paz, where about 1,000
miners, their families and other workers live, said Gdmundo Polo,
an official for the Federation of Gold Cooperatives.
It could be the worst mining accident in recent history in
Bolivia. The nearest town to the camp is Tipuani, a gold mining
center where thousands of Indian miners work.
The Ministry of Mining and the Federation were coordinating
rescue operations, said Polo.
Serbs offer safe passage
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — Bosnian Serbs
offered safe passage yesterday to all seeking to leave Sarajevo,
where the Serbian offensive has pushed through key neighbor
hoods and halted desperately needed food shipments.
Battles around the airport diminished hope that aid flights
would resume soon.
The Serb offer was eyed with suspicion in Sarajevo as a possi
ble propaganda ploy and attempt to blame the Muslim-led Bosni
an government for the thousands that may die this coming win
ter from cold and hunger.
"All Serbs, Croats, Yugoslavs, Jews and all other citizens . ..
wishing to do so (should) prepare themselves to leave Sarajevo,
threatened by cold and winter," read a statement released by the
commissioner for refugees of the self-proclaimed Serbian Repub
lic in Bosnia.
