## Season's Greetings 
### 
Here are the highs and
lows of the past year
at Stanford set to rhyme

<rri WAS ™ E FIRST YEAR
of Casper and all through
JL the Farm
The jury was still out. Was he cool?
Could he charm?
The school welcomed him warmly
in Stanford's own way
Our thoughts were auspicious (at
least for a day).
"Welcome to Stanford!" we Stan
fordites sang
We've heard merry news of your
great sturm und drang.
Balance our budget! Get the Feds
off our backs!
Save us! But cheaply! Do this and
do that!
We know you're quite busy admin
istering and such
But a review of the year? Would it
be too much
To send you our holiday thoughts
in verse?
(Hey, it's Dead Week — a poem
can't make it worse).
Our school won five titles in
NCAAs
And aided by Walsh we slammed
Cal at Big Game
And what to our wondering eyes
did appear
But Olympic contenders and pro
sports careers!
On Summer! On Thompson! On
Pablo! On Lynch!
On Tommy! On Lea! We're glad
you got in.
Yet despite Stanford's prowess in
these things athletic
The department's uptight about
peripatetic
Band members. Their jesting half
time shows
Are censored and scowled at. iPor
que? Who knows?

You've now met our student gov
ernment this year
We sort of have one, though it's
not really clear
Who's in charge nowadays, quite a
large irony
That it's "I Prefer Not to Have a
COP"
"It's no big surprise," Stanford
historians note.
"Two years ago Bart Simpson got
votes."
Residentially speaking, things are
approaching Nirvana
That is, if you're lucky to have digs
in Lantana.
In contrast, Manzanita, like the
famed Bates' Motel
Still condemns lottery losers to
drab pre-fab hell.
The drought hasn't ended, the
foothills were grilled
(But strangely, just after Lake Lag
was refilled.)
Oh yeah. Academics. Some stu
dents won Rhodes
And published their theses. We all
studied loads.
A professor of math — who when
jogging got bothered
Sicked his dog Pookie on two kids
and their father.
But we proved once and for all that
we're no social duds.
One of our classmates (willingly!)
appeared on "Studs."
Here at The Daily we can't
promise you much
But to nip at your heels and keep
you in touch
With the state of the campus. And
— except in one forum —
We'll try to maintain a fine sense
of decorum.
Huyck's column's that one excep
tion. (We won't be so callous
To joke of Archuleta and things
"über alles")
Anyway, Mr. President, we're glad
that you're here
Relax, eat much fowl. We'll see you
next year.
