Athlete mistreatment not limited to women's cross country

TISH WILLIAMS HAS EXPOSED
a problem in the Department of
Athletics that has either not been
brought to the department's attention or
has been conveniently swept under the
rug: coaches.
I find it appalling that the Athletics
Department can have such a host of
great coaches alongside ones who are
responsible for sucking the confidence
and self-esteem out of student athletes.
As the former captain of the women's
gymnastics team, I have unfortunately
experienced the wrath of "psychotic col
lege coaches" and have suffered both
physically and mentally for it.
My coaches decided to kick me and
three other women off the nine-member
team because we were considered "over
weight." We were not allowed to practice
until the weight was lost.

The ultimatum made me sick, but
more than anything, it scared me. I saw
my teammates starving and purging. I
saw my teammates too weak to finish a
practice. I saw my teammates cry every
night in frustration.
I saw my teammates believe that they
were fat.
"Weight" was all-consuming. Every
thing I did was controlled by the
thoughts of weight. I would try to study
and all I could think about was that I
should be exercising to burn my fat.
I didn't want to be around people
because I was uncomfortable with
myself and my body.
I became so obsessed with these
thoughts that it got to the point where I
would do everything possible not to
leave my room. I didn't want anyone to
see me ... I was fat. I let my coaches

control my mind and my body. I hate
them for this.
The weight issue is only one example
of the many problems that are occurring.
It would take pages to explain other inci
dences of coaches inflicting personal
mental injury on team members.
Condescending and hurtful remarks
are hardly beneficial to the technique of
a gymnast.
I hold my ex-coaches responsible for
ruining what were supposed to be the
best years of my life. I came to Stanford
with visions of greatness. I was going to
be competing for one of the most presti
gious universities in the nation.
No other college can boast of such
academic prominence and athletic domi
nance and I was going to be part of it.
How could such a notable institution let
this human degradation continue?

I went to the Athletics Department
for help. I told them what I thought was
needed to remedy the situation and for
tunately, a year later, they are taking
small steps toward change.
However, these changes are of no
help to those of us who have already suf
fered â€” the damage is already done.
Problematic coaches are not isolated
within women's track and gymnastics.
Instead of the coaches weeding out the
athletes, maybe the Athletics Department
should weed out some of the coaches.
The women's gymnastics team may
now be doing better in the rankings, but
are the rankings so important that we
must sacrifice the well being of the indi
viduals on the team? This is for the Ath
letics Department to decide.
