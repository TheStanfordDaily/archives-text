# Incident at Faculty Club should not be forgotten
## 
### 
On Oct. 23, an incident occurred at
the Faculty Club that is representative
of the underlying racism that still exists
on campus and elsewhere.
A professor eating at the club chose to
express his misguided anger towards a
server, Mary Wu, by telling her to "go
back to China."
The ongoing debate on hate speech
and free speech has been manifested in
several recent Daily articles on the Grey
Interpretation.
What many proponents of so-called
"free speech" do not realize is that hate
speech only harms and injures; it does
not promote discussion. Hate speech
inhibits free speech.
In a university setting where free
speech is critical to academic discourse,
professors should serve as role models
for informed thinking and discussion. If

professors can yell such racial epithets
in public, what kind of ideologies taint
their teaching in terms of their treat
ment of students and the material being
taught?
Such ignorance is even more disturb
ing in light of the fact that professors
assign grades, write recommendations,
choose graduate students, and generally
hold much power over the careers of stu
dents.
Do other faculty members hold racist
beliefs?
If the answer is yes, discussion and
action should not end with the resolu
tion of this one incident.
Without "witch-hunting," we need to
examine the people and institutions of
the university. What can individual stu
dents, faculty, and departments and
schools do to combat ignorance?
We need to talk to each other. The
issue is not over.
