# Column raises question of editorial discretion

### 
Pete Huyck's Dec. 4 column raises an
interesting issue: editorial discretion.
The guarantees of free speech in this
nation in no way compel publishers to
publish material they see as unfit.
Indeed, if we are to take Huyck at this
word, some Stanford publications do not
feel obliged to publish whatever dreck
comes their way.
He suggests that the G Spot turned
down his self-described "poetry." Why
couldn't The Daily follow that mar
velous example of taste? Does The Daily
not subscribe to standards?
Do the editors feel so concerned about
maintaining their rich endowment of
column inches that they must stuff their
pages with verbiage no matter how limp
in substance?
Or do they feel obliged to publish
whatever arrives upon their desks,

including articles such as Huyck's,
pieces designed not to encourage
thought or communication but merely to
offend?
He offers your unfortunate readers
disturbing and insulting images of
women's bodies without even a pretense
of justification.
Perhaps you forget that your paper
serves for some as a representation of
what Stanford students have to offer. If,
by Stanford standards, Huyck exempli
fies writing and thinking sufficiently
exceptional to merit regular space in the
daily newspaper, one can only conclude
that it would be hard to go wrong
underestimating Stanford's undergrad
uates.
Or to put it more directly, it's hard to
imagine that there isn't someone more
talented and a little farther along in his
or her adolescence who could take over
Huyck's column.
