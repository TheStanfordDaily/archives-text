## Clinton should establish contingency plan 
### 
WHEN John Hinck
ely shot Ronald
Reagan in 1981,
there was no emergency
book and much confu
sion about the implica
tions of the 25th Amend
ment. As Secretary of
the Treasury Don Regan
put it,"I kept wondering
sit what point some alert

staff would remember that a doomsday
book, in which guidelines and contingen
cies had been outlined, was locked up in a
safe in somebody's office ... no such
guide was ever produced."
A president who thought long and
hard about the possibility was Dwight D.
Eisenhower. His heart attack in 1955,
intestinal obstruction in 1956 and stroke
in 1957 prompted him to urge Congress
to enact legislation that would allow for a
temporary transfer of power. It was his
prodding that led to the ratification of the
25th Amendment in 1967.
Under Section 3, the president is
authorized to transfer power temporarily
to the vice president. If a president is
unable to declare his own "inability" — if
he is in a coma, for example — the vice
president and majority of the Cabinet
may initiate the transfer under Section 4.
With the mechanism now in place, the
serious question is why hasn't it been
explored during President-elect Bill Clin

ton's transition? After all, 13 of the 17
United States presidents in this century
have had significant illness while in office:
coronary heart disease (10), strokes
(three), surgery (six), violent attacks
(seven with two deaths), cancer (three),
kidney disease (two), diabetes, Addison's
disease, hyperthyroidism, phlebitis and
many others.
Clinton seems healthy and unlikely to
suffer from heart disease or cancer, but
he is not exempt from the powerful habit
of denial. In any case, illness is unpre
dictable, and he has never fully disclosed
all of his ftjedical records. Moreover, as
Clinton continues to maintain contact
with the electorate, the Secret Service
can never fully protect him from a deter
mined assassin.
Even with the huge agenda occupying
the transition, Clinton and his vice presi
dent A 1 Gore should take a few hours to
sit down with the president's physician,
the White House counsel and the chief of
staff to engage in contingency planning.
Both men should understand that
invoking Section 3 is essential under cer
tain conditions: whenever surgery requires
anesthesia; during a serious illness such as
a heart attack, stroke or massive infection;
during use of psychoactive drugs in signifi
cant amounts, such as narcotics, tranquil
izers or amphetamines and when the pres
ident or his physician perceives that ill
ness, injury or emotional problems are

interfering with the president's judgement
or capacity to govern.
It would be Gore's responsibility to
initiate the invocation of the amendment,
under Section 4, whenever the President
is comatose or under general anesthesia
in the absence of a transfer of power
under Section 3; and when the president
is judged to be disabled but cannot or will
not step aside voluntarily.
The goal of the 25th Amendment was
to maintain cognitive competence in the
White House during temporary presiden
tial disability and to protect the sick pres
ident from the responsibilities of office.
Paul Tsongas now says he mishandled
the issue of his health, and asked Clinton
to create a commission to determine
what medical information candidates
should disclose. If Tsongas had been
elected and the recurrence of his cancer
had been found after inauguration, the
importance of preparing for the transfer
of authority would have been brought
home powerfully.
