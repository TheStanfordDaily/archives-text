lAM WRITING IN RESPONSE TO A
letter written to the Stanford Daily
on Nov. 24. The letter, submitted by
Sergio Reyes, concerns an incident that
occured in Stern Hall Late Night Food
Service when a Stanford student picked
up a maraca and shook it. I was one of
the students who was sitting at the table
with the perpetrator.
I did not notice his actions until a girl
from another table said, in a very hostile
voice, that she as a Mexican-American was
offended by my friend's actions because it
showed insensitivity to her culture. Need
less to say, we all felt uncomfortable
because one man's innocent actions had
offended another student, but the actual
actions of our "all white" group bare little
resemblance to Reyes' descriptions.

The group sitting at the table was not
homogeneous in color, nor race, nor reli
gion, as was said irresponsibly by a man
who admits that he didn't even turn
around to look at us. The shaking of the
maracas did not meet with "a chorus of
laughter," as Reyes suggested, for few of
the people at the table even noticed what
was going on before the woman stood up
and drew attention to the scene.
After she spoke her feelings, someone
at the table asked me what was happen
ing. I replied that she was Mexican-
American. However, the letter conve
niently quotes me as saying "... Mexi
can. . . While this is a quote which is
technically correct, it gives the impres
sion that I had made a derogatory
remark.

The woman then burst out again say
ing that she was Mexican-American and
proud of her culture, to which another
friend replied "I'm sure you are." This
comment was not made sarcastically as
it would seem, but in an effort to solve
an unintentional and uncomfortable sit
uation. None of the comments received
"bursts of support, for none of us felt
proud of the confrontation. The interac
tion ended this way with our group feel
ing confused and quiet.
This incident was not the result of
indifference on our part. The cause of
the scene was perhaps ignorance which
is attributable to one person, a man who
is very sensitive and kind, not our entire
group or an entire race. Had he known
this set-up was a memorial for the dead,

or that his actions would offend anyone,
I am sure that he would not have acted
as he did.
I thought that the incident would be
forgotten and that is easy for me to say
as I did not feel invaded. I understand
how the event would be a bit more trou
bling to the one offended, but it is truly
going too far to say that our insensitivity
was in any way comparable to the L.A.
riots. To go to such extremes is a gross
overreaction on Reyes' part and is par
ticularly offensive to my friends and me.
I believe that both his letter and the
woman's immediate response to the inci
dent could have been used to educate
rather than to offend and agitate. Per
haps these overreactions are attributable
to paranoia rather than to rational anger

over the racism that exists in America
today.
Both reactions only helped to further
the gap between cultures and undermine
good will on the part of those who are
trying to break the stereotypical, white
image. I consider myself to be extremely
sensitive to the plight of others who face
situations that I can not even imagine.
But in exchange for my efforts, I hope
that those around me will use equal con
sideration when interacting with me. I
hope that if ever a situation such as this
one arises again, the other party will
decide to try to rid society of ignorance
rather than merely being frustrated,
angry and ineffective so that I may learn.
