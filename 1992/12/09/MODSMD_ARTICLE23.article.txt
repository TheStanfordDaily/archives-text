# Students step forward to support and applaud Wu
## 
### 
We write to express our deep concern
about the Stanford professor's abusive
outburst towards Mary Wu at the Facul
ty Club. We question the validity of the
professor's excuse that "a bad temper on
the occasion" caused his racist remarks.
Such remarks represent deep-seated
racist attitudes which are not limited to
this particular faculty member and are
tolerated by a surprisingly large popula
tion even at Stanford. For example, we
question if there were any witnesses to
this incident, such as other faculty din
ers, and if so, why no one intervened on
Wu's behalf.
Racially motivated actions such as the
professor's must not go unchallenged. In
order to confront racism in this commu
nity that values free and open debate, we
ask that the professor's identity be made
known to facilitate public discourse. Our
concern is that through his professorial
duties such as teaching, advising and
supervising graduate research assis
tants, this professor can influence the
lives of many students. Students would
be better served by being able to make
informed decisions when choosing to
work with him.
We understand how difficult it must
have been for Wu to make this incident
public. Her task has been aided by the
constructive initial responses of several
Stanford administrators, the Faculty
Club Board of Directors, the Black Stu
dents Union and the Asian American

Students Association. This letter repre
sents our support for her struggle for
dignity and in effect the dignity of all
students of color. Wu has stood up for us
and now we are stepping up to support
her.
