# 'G-Spotâ€™ staffer defends poems as literary work
## 
### 
I was surprised to see Peter Huyck's
poetry in Friday's Daily, but not for the
reason that most people would expect.
As a member of the "G-Spot" editori
al board, I saw the two poems before,
and was one of the few members who
supported their publication. I feel the
poems were misinterpreted and misun
derstood for a number of reasons.
The other "G-Spot" board members
felt the poetry did not reflect an honest
view of feminism and would work to
undermine the legitimacy of the rest of
the publication. I have also heard other
women complain that Huyck portrays
women as "over-weight" and "under
sexed."
Obviously, these women didn't read
"In the Heat of the Noon-Day Sun" in
its entirety, because the last line reveals
that the woman is actually a man. The
poem begins with a typical objectifica
tion of women, saying "she's silhouetted
in the doorway . . . she smiles slyly, she
wants me."
However, the last line reveals that the
"woman" has a penis, thus reversing the

meaning and objectifying the "man."
This double-entendre illustrates the fact
that anyone can be objectified, regard
less of sex, which I see as an important
part of my feminism.
With a society largely dependent upon
images, caused by the dominant influ
ence of television and the media, Huyck
acknowledges that while women have
been the primary victims of societal
stereotyping, so have men.
In the second poem, "Vagina," Huyck
highlights a male view of female geni
talia. Friends of mine felt the poem was
reckless, offensive and demeaning,
because the vagina was portrayed not as
an aspect of femininity, but rather as an
object to be used.
However, when Huyck comments
that a vagina would be a good place to
put his "money," "keys" and "tuna
sandwich," he is representing a view
that is obviously naive and careless, but
not his own.
The poem is a literary work, and cre
ates a character and a view that is all
too-real in modern society. Huyck
intends to shock and bring the reader to
grips with this inadequate view of
femaleness.
In his poems, he is not judging femi
nism or females, but representing a com
mon view that he sees in our society. By
making this view so blatant, he shows
that he acknowledges the ridiculousness
of the view, as reflected by the humor
ous tone. Anyone who takes Huyck's
poems literally or seriously misses the
point.
