# Stanford should not let coaches degrade athletes

In a cathartically spiteful editorial,
Tish Williams recently vented her anger
at former track coach Brooks Johnson.
Williams "spitlsl on Johnson's grave"
because Johnson's inhuman training
regimen and abusive and demeaning
treatment of team members caused nine
of Williams' 12 fellow runners to quit.
Johnson transformed running, once the
joy of Williams' life, into living hell.
I never met Johnson, but I hate him
too. My high school (Wayland High
School in Massachusetts) has a great
track tradition and has turned out many
outstanding runners including Alberto
Salazar. Salazar won the New York
Marathon and once owned the fastest
marathon time in history. But then
there was Jon Mann. Mann shattered all
of Salazar's high school records. Today
the Wall of Fame in my high school
fieldhouse records the achievements of
Mann, not Salazar. Mann was the man.
until he came to Stanford and met
Johnson. I have heard that Johnson ran
him into the ground and Mann faded
into oblivion.
Mann's story is a sad one. But the
destruction of a potentially amazing run
ning talent pales in comparison with the
damage done to the psyches of dozens of
Stanford runners over the years. Run
ning is supposed to be fun. I run to leave
my troubles behind. Running gives me
safe harbor from the stress of Stanford
life. Of course teams should strive to

win, but good coaches understand that
people respond best to positive reinforce
ment, not interminable invective. It is a
shame that Stanford permitted Johnson
to whip runners until they could no
longer stand to do the thing which once
brought them the most joy in life.
