I was inspired by Pete Huyck's poet
ry. I searched for alternative uses for a
penis, but it doesn't seem to be worth
very much. Here's my poem for Pete:
"Penis"
I wish that I had a penis
It would be good to put things on
Like my ribbons, my Rolex, my
scrunchies â€”
Little things that I'll miss if they're
gone.
On my penis I could keep some necessi
ties
Like a donut in case I miss dinner
I could always use it as a bookmark,
Only then it would get slightly thinner.
I have heard that penes get hard without
warning
And fall prey to a lonely desire.
I like my brain where it is in my head
A vagina is all I require.
