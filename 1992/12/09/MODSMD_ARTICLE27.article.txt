# Stanford students garner high-profile scholarships
## 'I didn't think I had a shot at the Rhodes': Winner says he's academic, not athletic 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
When Stanford senior Erez
Kalir was named a Rhodes schol
ar Sunday, no one was more sur
prised by the news than Kalir
himself.
Rhodes scholarships — award
ed to 32 students in the United
States each year — are stereotyp
ically associated with athletes and
aspiring politicians, like presi
dent-elect and former Rhodes
scholar Bill Clinton. Kalir freely
admits that he is neither.
"It was very unexpected," he
said. "I didn't think I had a shot
at the Rhodes."
Included in the criteria for the
scholarship, which pays for two
years of study at Oxford Universi
ty, are outstanding scholastic,
athletic, and leadership abilities.
Kalir's selection reflects

Rhodes' current effort to give
scholarships to more "serious"
students, individuals who intend
to spend more time in Oxford
classrooms and libraries than
local pubs.
"The Rhodes committee told
me that during the '70s and '80s,
universities sent students to
Oxford who slacked off and didn't
get a degree," Kalir said. Clinton,
for example, spent a year at
Oxford and did not earn a diplo
ma.
Kalir, for one, fits the "new"
Rhodes mold. Though Kalir pro
fesses that he "keeps fit," his
most impressive credentials are in
the academic and public service
spheres.
A graduate of The College
Preparatory School in Oakland,
Kalir is a double major in English
and biology. He has maintained a
straight-A average at Stanford and

is currently completing work on an
honors thesis about Holocaust
survivor and poet Paul Celan.
In addition, Kalir has taught
forensics and poetry for the last
three years as a volunteer at


Erez Kalir
James Logan High School and is
co-captain of the Stanford debate
team.
"I see myself as an interdisci
plinary thinker," he said. "I think
my strength is that I can find con
nections and bridges between
humanities and science.
"Each field has given me insight
into the other," he explained. "For
example, a gene is a unit of biologi
cal memory that remembers a bio
logical past, in much the same way
that a word remembers the history
of language."
Kalir would like to pursue both
academic fields at Oxford, but
said it is "hard to find a program
that allows for an interdisci
plinary focus."

After his time at Oxford, Kalir
plans to become a university pro
fessor, but says that he hopes to
do more than just teach.
"I want to help lead the changes
that must be made in American
education, to help forge ties
between higher education and the
surrounding community," he said.
"Stanford has a strong public ser
vice program, but it is an absolute
travesty that five miles from a uni
versity like this, there is a place
like East Palo Alto."
Kalir attributes much of his
success to the wealth of opportu
nities Stanford offers. "I can't
think of an undergraduate school
that offers such an incredible
array of resources," he said.
In particular, Kalir points to
the two quarters he spent last
year at Stanford in Oxford as his
best experience as a student.
"I learned more there than any

other time," he said. He said that
the fruitfulness of his stay at Oxford
led him to apply for the Rhodes.
In addition, Kalir conducted
research for his thesis in Berlin,
Auschwitz and Jerusalem, and
received a grant from Stanford's
humanities center in his sophomore
year to teach poetry at James Logan.
Kalir said his teaching is relat
ed to his future aspirations in
that he must be equally sensitive
to his students' social realities
and their academic ability.
Kalir said he will spend the
rest of the year completing his
thesis but conceded that he will
be "hard-pressed to finish the
biology degree."
Similarly, he is self-effacing in
discussing the Rhodes honor. "I
feel very fortunate to get [the
scholarship!," he said. "There are
many more people who deserve it
than receive it."

travesty that five miles from a uni
versity like this, there is a place
like East Palo Alto."
Kalir attributes much of his
success to the wealth of opportu
nities Stanford offers. "I can't
think of an undergraduate school
that offers such an incredible
array of resources," he said.
In particular, Kalir points to
the two quarters he spent last
year at Stanford in Oxford as his
best experience as a student.
"I learned more there than any

other time," he said. He said that
the fruitfulness of his stay at Oxford
led him to apply for the Rhodes.
In addition, Kalir conducted
research for his thesis in Berlin,
Auschwitz and Jerusalem, and
received a grant from Stanford's
humanities center in his sophomore
year to teach poetry at James Logan.
Kalir said his teaching is relat
ed to his future aspirations in
that he must be equally sensitive
to his students' social realities
and their academic ability.
Kalir said he will spend the
rest of the year completing his
thesis but conceded that he will
be "hard-pressed to finish the
biology degree."
Similarly, he is self-effacing in
discussing the Rhodes honor. "I
feel very fortunate to get [the
scholarship!," he said. "There are
many more people who deserve it
than receive it."
