# Stanford students garner high-profile scholarships
## 'I didn't think I had a shot at the Rhodes': Winner says he's academic, not athletic 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
When Stanford senior Erez
Kalir was named a Rhodes schol
ar Sunday, no one was more sur
prised by the news than Kalir
himself.
Rhodes scholarships — award
ed to 32 students in the United
States each year — are stereotyp
ically associated with athletes and
aspiring politicians, like presi
dent-elect and former Rhodes
scholar Bill Clinton. Kalir freely
admits that he is neither.
"It was very unexpected," he
said. "I didn't think I had a shot
at the Rhodes."
Included in the criteria for the
scholarship, which pays for two
years of study at Oxford Universi
ty, are outstanding scholastic,
athletic, and leadership abilities.
Kalir's selection reflects

Rhodes' current effort to give
scholarships to more "serious"
students, individuals who intend
to spend more time in Oxford
classrooms and libraries than
local pubs.
"The Rhodes committee told
me that during the '70s and '80s,
universities sent students to
Oxford who slacked off and didn't
get a degree," Kalir said. Clinton,
for example, spent a year at
Oxford and did not earn a diplo
ma.
Kalir, for one, fits the "new"
Rhodes mold. Though Kalir pro
fesses that he "keeps fit," his
most impressive credentials are in
the academic and public service
spheres.
A graduate of The College
Preparatory School in Oakland,
Kalir is a double major in English
and biology. He has maintained a
straight-A average at Stanford and

is currently completing work on an
honors thesis about Holocaust
survivor and poet Paul Celan.
In addition, Kalir has taught
forensics and poetry for the last
three years as a volunteer at
