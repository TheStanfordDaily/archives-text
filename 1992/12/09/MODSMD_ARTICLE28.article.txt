# Three Stanford women walk away with Marshalls

### Julie Tsai 
When it comes to prestigious scholarships to
British universities, Stanford's female students
have a leg up on the males this year, as three have
been awarded Marshall scholarships.
Seniors Michelle Mello and Allison Moore and co
term student Kathryn Clark were three of the 23
female and 13 male recipients announced Monday.
"I think it's great. The administration always has
problems in getting women to apply," Mello said.
"Women are as serious scholars as men. This is a
very encouraging thing."
Successful applicants, who must be U.S. citizens
under age 25 with a minimum A-minus average, can
attend any British university on scholarship.
The Marshall scholarship pays fees and tuition
for the scholars, who are guaranteed two years of
schooling with an optional third year upon review,
allowing the scholar to get either a master's degree
or a doctoral degree — called a D. Phil. — in
Britain's research-oriented grad programs.
Historically, this is the first year in the institu
tion's 39 years that there is a greater number of
women awardees than men. Clark speculated that
more women felt confident enough to apply for the

fellowship this year. "I don't think that this is any
sort of affirmative action on the part of the commit
tee," she added.
Mello, however, suspects there were other consid
erations. "This wasn't anything concrete, but I got
the feeling that gender was a consideration," she
said. "The environment over there is very heavily
male. The college I was at (while studying at Oxford)
was 80 percent men.
"This would do the British some good," she con
tinued. "Women just weren't taken as seriously [as
menl over there — by the tutors and the students."
Clark is finishing a studio art for December
graduation after having completed a biology mqjor
with honors in June. She will study for a M. Sc. in
environment and development in the Department of
Geography at Cambridge University.
Mello was active with the Debate Team and the
Financial Aids Advocacy Office. She is majoring in
political science and an individually designed major,
applied ethics. She will study for an M. Phil, in
British social policy.
Moore is interning at the Office of Management
and Budget in Washington, D.C. this quarter. Her
plans include research on how free trade and compe
tition affect women in the job market.
