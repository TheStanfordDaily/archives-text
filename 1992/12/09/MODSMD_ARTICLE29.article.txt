The authors of a report evalu
ating the quality of women's lives
at Stanford say they hope their
findings will encourage the Uni
versity community to address
issues and inequalities involving
female students.
The 23-page report, released
Friday, makes several recommen
dations, including that the Uni
versity establish a Committee on
the Status of Women and create a
full-time position for an assistant
dean to serve as a director of the
Women's Center. The report was
the end product of a study by the
Women's Needs Assessment
Study Group, a committee
formed by former Dean of Stu
dents Jim Lyons in the fall of
1989.
The study group — consisting
of 18 staff members and students
— first "brainstormed" about
issues that affected women stu
dents at Stanford, then examined
similar studies from other univer
sities to decide on a format and
what issues to address, said group
member Frances Morales.
The group compiled common
experiences and problems faced
by women students gathered from
"focus groups" — discussions
conducted in residences and grad

uate schools — said Morales, an
assistant dean and director of El
Centro Chicano.
Group chair Diana Akiyama
said members decided to make
qualitative findings based on
informal discussions rather than
a quantitative report based on
statistics and surveys.
A quantitative survey would
have limited the responses elicit
ed and the issues addressed, said
Akiyama, associate dean of
Memorial Church.
"In smaller focus groups, we
could find out what issues were
on women's minds, and expand
the discussion beyond 'yes, no or
maybe,' " she said.
Assoc. Dir. of Residential Edu
cation Diana Conklin, who also
participated in the study, said the
report addresses "how it feels to
be a woman at Stanford. It wasn't
a lab study."
The report has two major sec
tions — one for undergraduate
women and one for graduate
women — with subsections such
as "General Attitudes about
Stanford" and "Classroom and
Laboratory Environment" in
each.
Responses from more than 120
women were synthesized into
descriptions of the general feel
ings they had about life as women
at Stanford and the problems

they have encountered as females.
Although the focus groups rep
resented a diverse cross-section of
Stanford women, Akiyama said
the participants shared many
common experiences and com
plaints.
The "greatest problems" exist
ed in the "area of sexual harass
ment," she said. "There need to
be more places in the University
women can go for advocacy on
their behalf."
She also asserted the impor
tance of improving the classroom
environment through "the active
responsibility of faculty and deans
to make it possible for female stu
dents to have an equal opportuni
ty to achieve academically."
Morales said more easily
resolved issues that are brought
up in the report — such as safety
— could be addressed immediate
ly by the University.

"You don't need a whole huge
study — it's clear that women
don't feel safe on campus," she
said, adding that more lights and
public telephones need to be
installed.
The report made 12 recommen
dations based on its findings,
divided into two categories: "How
should Stanford University
respond to the needs of women
students?" and "How should the
offices of Student Affairs respond
the the needs of women students?"
Akiyama said she has recom
mended in a letter to the Dean of
Students' office that a follow-up
committee consisting of some mem
bers of the study group be formed
to address the recommendations.
"I would like to see everyone
who works on this campus incor
porate the findings and recom
mendations in their own capaci
ty," Conklin said.
