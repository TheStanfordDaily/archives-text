# Trustees OK benefits for same-sex partners
## Opposite-sex employee partners denied privileges 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
After two days of meetings, the Board of
Trustees decided yesterday to extend bene
fits to employees' same-sex domestic part
ners. But the board did not extend these
benefits to opposite-sex partners.
According to Barbara Butterfield, vice
president for faculty and staff services, the
trustees' decision stemmed from the principle
of nondiscrimination and the fact that same
sex domestic partners of employees do not
have any means of access to these benefits.
Same-sex couples "do not have the ability
to marry, while heterosexual couples do,"
said John Freidenrich, the president of the
board.
Finally, after "some really searching dis

cussion," Butterfield said the board decided
to extend benefits to same-sex partners be
cause that is the more pressing issue.
She said the trustees agreed that gay and
lesbian employees should be as reasonably
and equitably treated as other employees
and made "a conscious decision" not to ig
nore sexual orientation.
"They took the higher ground," she said,
worrying "less about politics or public rela
tions" and more about the principles of the
issue.
The University will absorb the costs of
the extended benefits for the first year, But
terfield said. Afterward, the cost will be
shared by the University and the employees.
"There won't be huge changes (in the
costs of) benefits," she said.
Using the numbers from a Fac
ulty Senate committee report, she
estimated that between 40 and 60
employees will register their
domestic partners, which the com
mittee projected would cost the
University between $30,000 and
$60,000 of its $24 million annuasl
medical benefits budget to cover.
If the board had decided to
extend the benefits to opposite
sex couples also, the committee
report estimated it would cost
$70,000 to $140,000 per year.
Although the cost was a factor,
Freidenrich said "it wasn't neces
sarily the main issue" in deter
mining if benefits should be

extended to opposite-sex partners.
Trustees did discuss extending
benefits to opposite-sex partners,
but ultimately decided not to act
upon it.
The trustees accepted the Fac
ulty Senate Domestic Parity Bill's
definition of domestic partners,
which is "two individuals who live
together in a long-term relation
ship of indefinite duration, with
an exclusive mutual commitment
similar to that of marriage, in
which the partners agree to be
financially responsible for each
other's well-being."
They did not, however, go into
more specifics. Freidenrich
explained that the "technical lan
guage" and actual preparation of
the policy will be left to the Uni
versity administration.
Same-sex domestic partners
will be eligible for the benefits,

such as health insurance, library
privileges, survivors' benefits and
the right to audit classes, begin
ning Feb. 1. There will be an
enrollment period in January for
employees to register their
domestic partners for benefits.
The Faculty Senate first dis
cussed the issue in the spring of
1991 and asked a subcommittee
of the University Committee on
Faculty-Staff Benefits to study
the issue. The committee released
a report in June 1992.
At its Oct. 29 meeting, the Facul
ty Senate approved the subcommit
tee's recommendations to extend
benefits to domestic partners.
Though a majority of the Fac
ulty Senate voted to include oppo
site-sex couples in the bill passed
at that meeting, two of the main
advocates of the domestic part
ners bill were satisfied that the

board approved benefits for same
sex couples only.
Law Prof. William Simon, who
introduced the domestic partners
bill to the Faculty Senate, said he
is "delighted they did what was
clearly the right thing,"
Asst. Gynecology and Obstet
rics Prof. Katherine O'Hanlan,
who authored the original bill
introduced into the Senate in
April 1991, agreed that extending
benefits to opposite-sex partners
is "not as compelling" as for same
sex ones. "It's not a civil rights
issue for heterosexual couples,"
she said.
But Economics Prof. John
Shoven, a member of the Faculty
Senate, disagreed with the board,
saying he believes that extending
benefits to only same-sex domes
tic partners is discrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation.

"There won't be huge changes (in the
costs of) benefits," she said.
Using the numbers from a Fac
ulty Senate committee report, she
estimated that between 40 and 60
employees will register their
domestic partners, which the com
mittee projected would cost the
University between $30,000 and
$60,000 of its $24 million annuasl
medical benefits budget to cover.
If the board had decided to
extend the benefits to opposite
sex couples also, the committee
report estimated it would cost
$70,000 to $140,000 per year.
Although the cost was a factor,
Freidenrich said "it wasn't neces
sarily the main issue" in deter
mining if benefits should be

extended to opposite-sex partners.
Trustees did discuss extending
benefits to opposite-sex partners,
but ultimately decided not to act
upon it.
The trustees accepted the Fac
ulty Senate Domestic Parity Bill's
definition of domestic partners,
which is "two individuals who live
together in a long-term relation
ship of indefinite duration, with
an exclusive mutual commitment
similar to that of marriage, in
which the partners agree to be
financially responsible for each
other's well-being."
They did not, however, go into
more specifics. Freidenrich
explained that the "technical lan
guage" and actual preparation of
the policy will be left to the Uni
versity administration.
Same-sex domestic partners
will be eligible for the benefits,

such as health insurance, library
privileges, survivors' benefits and
the right to audit classes, begin
ning Feb. 1. There will be an
enrollment period in January for
employees to register their
domestic partners for benefits.
The Faculty Senate first dis
cussed the issue in the spring of
1991 and asked a subcommittee
of the University Committee on
Faculty-Staff Benefits to study
the issue. The committee released
a report in June 1992.
At its Oct. 29 meeting, the Facul
ty Senate approved the subcommit
tee's recommendations to extend
benefits to domestic partners.
Though a majority of the Fac
ulty Senate voted to include oppo
site-sex couples in the bill passed
at that meeting, two of the main
advocates of the domestic part
ners bill were satisfied that the

board approved benefits for same
sex couples only.
Law Prof. William Simon, who
introduced the domestic partners
bill to the Faculty Senate, said he
is "delighted they did what was
clearly the right thing,"
Asst. Gynecology and Obstet
rics Prof. Katherine O'Hanlan,
who authored the original bill
introduced into the Senate in
April 1991, agreed that extending
benefits to opposite-sex partners
is "not as compelling" as for same
sex ones. "It's not a civil rights
issue for heterosexual couples,"
she said.
But Economics Prof. John
Shoven, a member of the Faculty
Senate, disagreed with the board,
saying he believes that extending
benefits to only same-sex domes
tic partners is discrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation.
