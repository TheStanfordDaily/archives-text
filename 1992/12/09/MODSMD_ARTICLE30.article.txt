# Neverending story
## Stanford, Palo Alto discuss Sand Hill extension, residents voice opposition 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Stanford's never-ending strug
gle to extend Sand Hill Road to El
Camino Real faced more opposi
tion Monday night during a rare
joint "study session" by Palo
Alto's City Council and Planning
Commission.
In the first public hearing on the
University's latest proposal which
would extend Sand Hill, widen it to
four lanes, and expand the Stan
ford Shopping Center, more than
20 residents of Palo Alto and Menlo
Park voiced their opinions, with
most opposing the plan for environ
mental and traffic reasons.
Council members and planning
commissioners also expressed reser
vations about the proposal — par
ticularly the University's request
that Palo Alto pay $2.1 million of
the projected total cost of $9.1 mil
lion.
"If the value is so great to
Stanford, then Stanford will do
it," said Planning Commissioner
Bill Glazier. "It may not make
much sense for us to subsidize it
if it is going to happen anyway."
At the end of the four-and-a
half hour meeting, several council
members indicated they would
seek to place the issue on an
upcoming agenda so that the city
council could give a formal indica
tion to the University of its pre

liminary approval or disapproval.
Because the city council chose
to discuss the Sand Hill proposal
in a study session rather than an
actual meeting, they were not
allowed to pass any resolutions
regarding the project.
Members of the city staff indi
cated they would go ahead pro
cessing the University's applica
tion for the project unless it was
put on a city council agenda.
But the apparent decision by
some city council members to dis
cuss the issue at a future meeting
means the Palo Alto city staff will
delay beginning the environment
impact reports necessary for for
mal approval of the project.
Even if the process were to con
tinue unimpeded — an unlikely
prospect given past history — the
issue would not come up for final
approval before the city council
until about August 1994.
In addition to widening and
extending Sand Hill, the Univer
sity's latest proposal calls for clos
ing Arboretum Road and connect
ing the two halves of the Shop
ping Center, adding 140,000
square feet of new stores.
Stanford officials claim that
the expense of the project is too
great for the University to bear
alone, and say that the added sales
tax revenue from an expanded
shopping center would allow Palo
Alto to contribute to the project.
Palo Alto and Menlo Park resi
dents will benefit from the exten
sions of Sand Hill because it
would relieve rush hour and holi
day traffic problems, according to
University officials.
Sand Hill begins near Interstate
280 and currently winds to an end
in the shopping center parking lot
a short distance from El Camino,
leaving motorists confused and the
parking lot congested.
The Sand Hill extension would
also support the Stanford West
housing complex — a proposed
72-acre development of up to 400
condominiums and 750 apart
ments near the shopping center.
A Palo Alto city staff report sug
gests that the University overpro
jected increased revenues that
could be expected from the shop
ping center expansion, but also
said that the city should contribute
some unspecified lesser amount of
money than Stanford is seeking.
Council Member Joseph Huber
said that, given the current reces
sion and other shifts in shopping
trends, it was possible that tax
revenues might not increase sub
stantially and wondered if the
University might be willing to

guarantee Palo Alto a minimum
boost in sales tax revenue.
Bill Phillips, the executive direc
tor of real estate for the Stanford
Management Company, acknowl
edged that the issue of cost will
"come up in negotiations," but
pointed out that while the project
is a risk to Palo Alto, there is a "sig
nificant risk to Stanford."
Members of the council also
appeared to want to link the issue
of approval of the Sand Hill
extension project to other out
standing issues between the city
and the University.
Issues mentioned during the
meeting included the city's lease
with Stanford for El Camino
Park, open-space designations of
the Coyote Hill area, and cost
sharing for traffic management
at Stanford Stadium.
Residents of Palo Alto and
Menlo Park said they feared that
extending Sand Hill would actual
ly increase traffic in both east
Menlo Park and north Palo Alto.
Andy Doty, Stanford's director
of community relations, said after
the meeting that he believed most
of the residents' concerns would
be addressed in the environmen
tal impact reports.
But he added that the dif
ficulties will involve the Universi
ty's request for funds from Palo
Alto and the attempt by the city
council to link the Sand Hill project
to separate ongoing negotiations.
