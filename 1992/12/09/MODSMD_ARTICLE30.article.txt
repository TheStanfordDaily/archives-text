# Neverending story
## Stanford, Palo Alto discuss Sand Hill extension, residents voice opposition

Stanford's never-ending strug
gle to extend Sand Hill Road to El
Camino Real faced more opposi
tion Monday night during a rare
joint "study session" by Palo
Alto's City Council and Planning
Commission.
In the first public hearing on the
University's latest proposal which
would extend Sand Hill, widen it to
four lanes, and expand the Stan
ford Shopping Center, more than
20 residents of Palo Alto and Menlo
Park voiced their opinions, with
most opposing the plan for environ
mental and traffic reasons.
Council members and planning
commissioners also expressed reser
vations about the proposal — par
ticularly the University's request
that Palo Alto pay $2.1 million of
the projected total cost of $9.1 mil
lion.
"If the value is so great to
Stanford, then Stanford will do
it," said Planning Commissioner
Bill Glazier. "It may not make
much sense for us to subsidize it
if it is going to happen anyway."
At the end of the four-and-a
half hour meeting, several council
members indicated they would
seek to place the issue on an
upcoming agenda so that the city
council could give a formal indica
tion to the University of its pre

liminary approval or disapproval.
Because the city council chose
to discuss the Sand Hill proposal
in a study session rather than an
actual meeting, they were not
allowed to pass any resolutions
regarding the project.
Members of the city staff indi
cated they would go ahead pro
cessing the University's applica
tion for the project unless it was
put on a city council agenda.
But the apparent decision by
some city council members to dis
cuss the issue at a future meeting
means the Palo Alto city staff will
delay beginning the environment
impact reports necessary for for
mal approval of the project.
Even if the process were to con
tinue unimpeded — an unlikely
prospect given past history — the
issue would not come up for final
approval before the city council
until about August 1994.
In addition to widening and
extending Sand Hill, the Univer
sity's latest proposal calls for clos
ing Arboretum Road and connect
ing the two halves of the Shop
ping Center, adding 140,000
square feet of new stores.
Stanford officials claim that
the expense of the project is too
great for the University to bear
alone, and say that the added sales
tax revenue from an expanded
