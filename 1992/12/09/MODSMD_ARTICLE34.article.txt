# Grad students unhappy, but strike unlikely
## 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Despite dissatisfaction with
issues such as housing and fund
ing, many Stanford graduate stu
dents say a lack of organization
and low self-awareness should
keep them from following in the
footsteps of UC-Berkeley's strik
ing students.
Almost three weeks ago, grad
uate students at UC-Berkeley
began a strike, demanding that
the university treat them as regu
lar employees and recognize their
union. None of California's
schools has recognized graduate
student unions.
Since the strike has led to a
lack of teaching assistants, UC-
Berkeley students yesterday were
given the chance to take their
classes on a pass-no credit basis.
Several Stanford graduate stu
dents, however, believe a strike
here is unlikely at this point.
"The idea of a union or a strike
is not foreign to Stanford stu

dents," said David Bradfute, a
fifth-year doctoral student in biol
ogy-
There are a "multitude of prob
lems surrounding grad students,
including financing, housing and
the lack of a central vision for
grad students," he said. "Howev
er, I don't think Stanford stu
dents will strike."
Claiming that the administra
tion has been slow to recognize
these problems, Bradfute alluded
to recent funding changes and the
disbanding of the Graduate Stu
dent Association as indications of
graduate student woes.
"I think the dismantling of the
GSA made the problems worse,
but the budget cuts made them
terrible," he said. "It's almost
like the administration is saying
'We're going to make these bud
get cuts. If it hurts — tough.' "
Judith Goldstein, an associate
professor of political science and
the former Chair of the Commit
tee of Graduate Student Affairs,
said she believes the UC Berkeley

strike is a "non-issue at Stanford.
I haven't heard anything about it
here yet."
Mark Gonnerman, a sixth-year
graduate student in religious
studies, said he concurred with
Bradfute.
"It's unlikely that we will
strike," he said. "I haven't heard
many conversations about it.
We're aware, but we don't have
any plans of action."
He contrasted the UC-Berke
ley situation to the Stanford situ
ation on the basis of organization.
"Cal students are much more
organized than we are — which is
why they're striking," he said.
"The foundation is not here
right now," he said. "Cal students
are at a very different stage in
their self-awareness as a con
stituency than we are."
Self-awareness is a primary
issue at Stanford, he said. "We, as
grad students, are very self-con
scious. We are all very focused on
our immediate concerns. We need
greater awareness in an effort to

gain a larger scope."
Bradfute rejected the idea of
unionization. "God, a union
would be a disaster," he said. "It
would cause a strike, close every
thing down and disrupt under
graduate education. No, a union
is not good. Of course, treating
graduate students poorly is not
good either.
"The administration deserves
a strike," Bradfute continued.
"However, I don't want it. I would
hope that reasonable, thinking
people could solve these problems,
but I haven't seen it."
Several graduate students,
including Gonnerman and Brad
fute, will meet with University
President Gerhard Casper next
week to discuss graduate student
needs and problems.
"This is one of those opportu
nities that happens seldomly,"
said Gonnerman. "I have great
hope for the Casper administra
tion. Perhaps it will take a look at
what it means to be a grad stu
dent."
