# Greener than thou:
## Recycling residences reap rewards in contest 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
Roth, ZAP and Terra have won a nine-week
recycling contest sponsored by the Stanford
Recycling Center and Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford.
One winner was chosen in each of three cat
egories based on food-service style — Universi
ty-operated, self-operated, and co-operative.
The runners-up were Adams, which is a U-op;
Delta Kappa Epsilon, a Self-op; and Theta Chi,
a co-op.
The contest was based on the volume of
recycled materials per resident, cleanliness
around recycling areas and the placement of
materials in their proper barrels, said Heidi
Clark, public education manager for the Recy
cling Center. The two-month contest wrapped
up on Friday.
Each residence received a score from one to
100: ZAP with finished with 89.49, Terra with
86.89, and Roth with 46.09.
Recycling collection crews judged the con
test, Clark said. They tallied the amount of
recycled materials once a week and evaluated
the appearance of the area once every three
weeks. Clark said the crews were qualified to

judge the contest because they sort the mate
rial and are familiar with it.
The winners and runners-up in each cate
gory will receive a native California seedling
donated by the Peninsula Sanitary Service.
Roth, ZAP and Terra will also win study
breaks courtesy of Hobbie's Restaurant,
Marie Callender's, Suzanne's Muffins and
Country Sun Foods.
In the beginning of the year, environmental
representatives from all University residences
received information on recycling and contam
inants, Clark said. Score updates were dis
tributed in late October and in mid-November.
In both the co-op and U-op categories, the
winners were not ahead during the first six
weeks. Clark attributed the victories of Roth
and Terra to the cleanliness and correct place
ment criteria and to a change in residents'
attitudes toward recycling.
Clark said this year's contest differs from
last year's in that it now measures a resi
dence's recycling efforts in a more well-round
ed fashion.
"There has been criticism in the past that it
was only based on volume, so we looked for
other ways to judge, like whether things were
put in their place," she said.

Improved education and access to collection
areas have helped the University increase its
recycling by about 30 percent each year since
the contest began in 1988, Clark said.
"Steadily, recycling has been increasing at
Stanford, so that's encouraging," Clark said.
"However, there is certainly room for
improvement."
Clark said she hopes to bring recycling
information closer to students by "concentrat
ing on specific education and providing things
like 1 trash] slides in the houses."
Adrienne Mocello, recycling coordinator for
Terra House, said she thinks it is easier to
recycle in a co-op than in a U-op house because
in a co-op, the residents cook their own food
and are in more control of their kitchens.
However, she said she still has to remind peo
ple of the importance of recycling.
"I'm really happy we won because it's a
struggle sometimes," she said. "We've done a
good job educating people."
In co-ops such as Terra, residents do every
thing themselves — cooking, cleaning and
hashing. In self-ops such as ZAP, residents
hash and do some cleaning, but hire a chef to
cook for them. U-ops like Roth have Universi
ty Food Service and cleaning.
