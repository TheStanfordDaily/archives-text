## Who shall receive the water? Why California's new water law is a zero—sum game 
### Markely Bavinger Staff writer 
Driving through the parched lands of this
state, one cannot help but be reminded that one
force that salvages lush agricultural fields from
their intended fate as brown hillsides is the mass
import of water.
On Oct. 30, President Bush signed the
Omnibus Reclamation Bill which overhauls the
Central Valley Project (CVP), a federally run
water delivery system which oversees one-fifth of
California's water supply. According to several
Stanford professors, this law will have a major
impact on the state's future landscape.
One of the law's stated purposes is to "achieve
a reasonable balance among competing demand
for use of Central Valley Project water, including
the requirements of fish and wildlife, agricultur
al, municipal and industrial and power contrac- r
tors." There has been contention, however, that I
the bill has relegated agricultural concerns to v
the bottom tier.
The most controversial aspect of the law has
been the title which allocates 800,000 acre-feet of
water (approximately 10 percent of the water con
trolled by the CVP) to be set aside for fish and
wildlife uses. This water will be taken almost
exclusively from the agricultural sector, a loss the
bill detractor's projected will cost farms $262 mil
lion in lost gross income and 570,000 acres of ;
once arable land. /
The law will also shorten the maximum dura- v,
tion of a federal water service contract from 40
to 25 years. Such limitations remove the guaran
tee farmers once had of continued low prices over
a long time period. In addition the law will
require an environmental impact statement
before contract renewal — an additional expense
for farmers.
The law will also allow the sale of water from
farms to municipal and industrial systems. ,
Because urban areas are willing and able to pay j
more for water, this will result in more water y,
being taken from agricultural uses.
David Freyberg, a professor of hydrology in
Stanford's Civil Engineering department,
explains that cities have the resources to pay
more than farmers, and they are anxious to avoid
the cost of building new facilities. \
"If water were sold on a free market, a lot of '
water would move to the cities," said Freyberg.
Agriculture will suffer the greatest loss for

multiple reasons. Most prominent among these
reasons is that farms already use 80-85 percent of
the state's water while contributing only $16 bil
lion of the state's $752 billion estimated econom
ic product for 1992.
Even though Freyberg speculated that this bill
will cause an overall drop in the amount of irri
gated land in California, he does not believe that
the West will ever completely abandon agricultur
al endeavors.
Freyberg suggested that land which has been
less productive will be left untilled in the coming
years. This loss of acreage is expected to have
spin-off effects in other areas of the economy,
harming those businesses that process and man
age agricultural production.
Other aspects of California agriculture will
change with the times. There is expected to be a
move towards improved irrigation techniques
and less water intensive crops such as nuts and
\ fruits instead of water-intensive crops such as
' rice and cotton.
Barton Thompson, a Stanford Law School
assistant professor specializing in water law,
agrees with Freyberg that land uses will change.
These changes will not come easily, he added.
"These farmers may have spent years in a par
ticular market," says Thompson "and they do not
want to let it go."
Over time farmers have developed connections
and technologies suited to a particular market,
\ Thompson said. Switching to new crops may
/ not only require new investment, but will also
invalidate their accumulated knowledge.
Neither Freyberg nor Thompson believes that
the agricultural sector will see an increase in
water availability for their crops. The reasoning
behind this prediction stems from social and
political forces.
' Freyberg does not believe that urban popula
tions will be discouraged from growing because
of water supply needs of farms. "Water has
\ always been treated as a utility," said Freyberg.
) "As a society, we have never been willing to use
water as a population control."
Politicians are not likely to intervene on behalf
of farmers either. Instead, at least for the short
term, farmers will have to adjust to decreases in
water availability. "Inertia is very important in
water politics, and the inertia right now is for
v environmentalists," said Thompson. "At least
) for the next four years, I don't believe we'll see a
retreat on this bill."

the bill has relegated agricultural concerns to v
the bottom tier.
The most controversial aspect of the law has
been the title which allocates 800,000 acre-feet of
water (approximately 10 percent of the water con
trolled by the CVP) to be set aside for fish and
wildlife uses. This water will be taken almost
exclusively from the agricultural sector, a loss the
bill detractor's projected will cost farms $262 mil
lion in lost gross income and 570,000 acres of ;
once arable land. /
The law will also shorten the maximum dura- v,
tion of a federal water service contract from 40
to 25 years. Such limitations remove the guaran
tee farmers once had of continued low prices over
a long time period. In addition the law will
require an environmental impact statement
before contract renewal — an additional expense
for farmers.
The law will also allow the sale of water from
farms to municipal and industrial systems. ,
Because urban areas are willing and able to pay j
more for water, this will result in more water y,
being taken from agricultural uses.
David Freyberg, a professor of hydrology in
Stanford's Civil Engineering department,
explains that cities have the resources to pay
more than farmers, and they are anxious to avoid
the cost of building new facilities. \
"If water were sold on a free market, a lot of '
water would move to the cities," said Freyberg.
Agriculture will suffer the greatest loss for

multiple reasons. Most prominent among these
reasons is that farms already use 80-85 percent of
the state's water while contributing only $16 bil
lion of the state's $752 billion estimated econom
ic product for 1992.
Even though Freyberg speculated that this bill
will cause an overall drop in the amount of irri
gated land in California, he does not believe that
the West will ever completely abandon agricultur
al endeavors.
Freyberg suggested that land which has been
less productive will be left untilled in the coming
years. This loss of acreage is expected to have
spin-off effects in other areas of the economy,
harming those businesses that process and man
age agricultural production.
Other aspects of California agriculture will
change with the times. There is expected to be a
move towards improved irrigation techniques
and less water intensive crops such as nuts and
\ fruits instead of water-intensive crops such as
' rice and cotton.
Barton Thompson, a Stanford Law School
assistant professor specializing in water law,
agrees with Freyberg that land uses will change.
These changes will not come easily, he added.
"These farmers may have spent years in a par
ticular market," says Thompson "and they do not
want to let it go."
Over time farmers have developed connections
and technologies suited to a particular market,
\ Thompson said. Switching to new crops may
/ not only require new investment, but will also
invalidate their accumulated knowledge.
Neither Freyberg nor Thompson believes that
the agricultural sector will see an increase in
water availability for their crops. The reasoning
behind this prediction stems from social and
political forces.
' Freyberg does not believe that urban popula
tions will be discouraged from growing because
of water supply needs of farms. "Water has
\ always been treated as a utility," said Freyberg.
) "As a society, we have never been willing to use
water as a population control."
Politicians are not likely to intervene on behalf
of farmers either. Instead, at least for the short
term, farmers will have to adjust to decreases in
water availability. "Inertia is very important in
water politics, and the inertia right now is for
v environmentalists," said Thompson. "At least
) for the next four years, I don't believe we'll see a
retreat on this bill."
