— Frustrated, but Curious
A .Given the way you
• phrase your question, I
can definitely think of why partic
ular things might be sticky —
especially if you have noticed a
decrease in your visual acuity, or
unusual growths of hair on your
palms.
But certainly you didn't pose
your question out of a desire to
nave me publicly conjecture about
your nastier private recreations.
Rather, I assume, you were moti
vated by a desire to learn a bit
about the physical chemistry of
stickiness, or "adhesion."
Adhesion is the result of molec
ular forces that act across the sur
face of contact between two sub
stances, and cause the contacting
surfaces to resist separation.
The physical basis of adhesion
forces is, in many cases, anyone's
guess. About the only thing that
stickiness researchers agree
about is that no single explana
tion is sufficient to account for all
adhesion phenomena.
One (less than accurate) model
that many lay people find intu
itively acceptable is the mechani
cal theory of adhesion. Here, one
imagines a mechanical interlock
ing of components.
For example, carpenters often
roughen wood with sandpaper
before gluing it; one might
assume that this introduction of
irregularities to the surfaces to be
joined provide a way for the glue
to enter and "lock" with the
wood.
Despite the ease with which
one can grasp such a concept,
mechanical models aren't really
capable of adequately explaining
most adhesion. To really under
stand what makes things stick,
you have to delve down to the
molecular level.

The motion of molecules across
an interface, called "diffusion,"
can sometimes be responsible for
adhesiveness. Diffusion makes
the largest contribution to adhe
sion when the interface separates
two very similar (or identical)
substances.
When the two surfaces come in
contact, the long polymeric
molecules that make up the adhe
sive diffuse across the area of con
tact, blurring the interface and
making separation more difficult.
The self-stickiness of chewing
gum is a familiar example of dif
fusion-controlled adhesion.
Electrical forces can also play a
part in stickiness. When two pure
metal surfaces come in contact,
one may want to give up a few
electrons to the other.
This transfer of negative
charge results in a net positive
charge at the electron-donating

surface, and a surplus of negative
charge at the accepting surface.
Since positive and negative
charges attract, the two surfaces
will stick.
Electrostatic forces play a big
role in adhesion between metals,
but when it comes to the organic
polymer molecules that make up
the adhesives in tape, glue and
Post-Its™, other intermolecular
forces take control.
The most significant of these
are the so-called Van der Waal's
forces, once thought to be a conse
quence of the electrostatic attrac
tion that resulted from synchro
nizing the movements of elec
trons in neighboring molecules,

but now believed to be a quan
tum-mechanical phenomenon.
Individually, van der Waal's
forces are extremely weak, but
they are easy to come by and fair-
ly nonspecific. >
Added up over a long molecule,
their effects can dominate those
of other factors.
In epoxy glues, chemical bonds
actually form between the adhe
sive and its substrate (usually
paper or wood). Adhesion that
depends on chemical bond forma
tion is more or less irreversible:
Once the bonds are formed, any /
amount of stress applied at the v
interface is no more likely to rup
ture the adhesive bond than it is
to break bonds in the original
material.
Intermolecular forces —
whether van der Waal's or bond
ing in nature — will result in
adhesion only if the molecules of
the adhesive can contact the sub
strate's surface in a special way
known technically (I'm serious.)
as "wetting."
Wetting occurs when the so
called "cohesive" forces between
molecules of a would-be glue are
weaker than the adhesive forces
between these molecules and the
substrate.
If the cohesive forces are too
strong, then the glue will just sit
on the surface like a bead of
water on a newly waxed car. /
When the adhesive forces are v

strong enough, however, the /
glue will wet the surface and v
spread out to form a thin, tacky
layer. Due to the strong inter
molecular forces, the glue
molecules will then penetrate the
interfacial surface to maximize
the energetic benefits reaped
from such interactions.
Wetting, spreading and pene
tration — and you thought this
stuff would be boring.
