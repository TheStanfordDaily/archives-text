# Sunny future for solar cells?

Some predict practical solar power may arrive by end of century

At present Sun Power finds its immediate rev
enues through special, contract applications and
small-scale applications of solar energy.
Satellites and solar-energy race cars have used
Sun Power's solar cells. The consumer market has
also found applications for Swanson's cells in solar
powered calculators and air conditioners, where
they are used as high energy transistors that vary
motor speeds.
The long-range goal of Sun Power is eventually to
sell solar power plants that run entirely on photo
voltaic cells, Swanson said.
Swanson thinks these plants would be especially
useful during times of large demand, called distribu
tion peaks, which are most severe during the sum
mer, when the demand for air-conditioning is high.
Another long term goal of Swanson's company is
the widespread use of photovoltaic cells in electric
vehicles. Swanson believes that electric cars with
solar cells will become more common in California in
the next 10 years.
By 1998 new California air quality regulations
will require two percent of all-vehicles sold in the
state must produce zero-emissions.
Sun Power, however, has only sold one prototype
of their solar power plant — a 20 kilowatt plant cost
ing $250,000 — to a consortium of utilities called
Photovoltaics for Utility Scale Applications.
The reason for this lack of interest, Swanson said,
is cost. The solar power generated by Sun Power's
plant costs $ 10 per watt compared to only $2 per watt
for fossil fuel-generated electricity. Swanson is con
fident, however, that if enough companies buy his
power plants, his production costs will drop to $2 per
watt by the end of this decade, which would make
solar power a "commercially viable" alternative.
Swanson also thinks that Sunpower's single-crys
tal cells will be able to compete against the cheaper
thin-film cells. Thin-film cells cannot use concentra
tors, and thus large areas will have to be covered by
the cells to produce significant amounts of power.
This infrastructure is expensive to maintain, he
said.
The other problem with solar power right now, in
addition to its cost, is that it is intermittent. Like
wind power, "you don't get to decide about solar

Richard Swanson wants to see 1,000 points of
light — focusing on the ground.
A former Stanford electrical engineering profes
sor, Richard Swanson is now vice president in
charge of technology at Sun Power — the company
he helped found — which is committed to finding
commercial applications for solar energy.
The company manufactures and sells a solar cell
(also called a photovoltaic cell) that Swanson devel
oped while at Stanford. The cell set an energy-effi
ciency record of 28.2 percent in 1987.
The first practical silicon solar cells were built by
Bell Labs in the 19505. When photons from sunlight
hits doped silicon, they knock free some of the elec
trons that were in the bonds holding the silicon
together. These electrons are then channeled out of
the cell in one direction and flow as electric current,
i After the energy of the current has been harnessed,
\ the electrons are put back into the silicon to fill up
J the "holes" left behind.

At present, solar cells can be manufactured by
two methods. Currently, most commercial cells are
thin-film cells, which are manufactured by using
vapor deposition to condense a thin layer of doped
silicon over a substrate.
Although inexpensive, these cells have at most a 6
percent efficiency, although some experimental cells
developed by Arco Solar have reached 11 percent.
Sun Power manufactures cells with a 22 percent
efficiency.
Swanson gave two reasons why Sun Power's cells
are so efficient, compared to thin-film cells.
First, they use high quality silicon crystals, with
few impurities and an almost perfect structure. This
high quality crystal, however, makes the cells much
more expensive than thin-films.
Instead of using large sheets of silicon, Sun Power
plans to decrease the bulk cost of their cells by using
more economical concentrator lenses to focus a large
, amount of sunlight on a small piece of silicon, mul
\ tiplying the sunlight's intensity by 500.
) Cells which use these types of lenses are called
concentrator cells, and can reach efficiencies of 28.2
percent. However, "The advantages of concentrators
are not apparent until you reach large-scale power
generation," Swanson said.
A concentrated solar cell made with gallium
arsenide has also been developed by Varian Associ
ates Inc. While this cell has a 29 percent efficiency,
Swanson said it is probably too expensive to ever be
used commercially.
Another reason for the high efficiency of Sun-
Power's cells is in the way the current is channeled
in and out of the cell. While most solar cells have one
wire lead on the top of the cell and the other on the
bottom, Sun Power's cell has both leads on the bot
l torn of the cell.
\ This way, Sun Power has increased the amount of
) available sunlight that reaches the silicon. While
this seemed like an obvious solution, the critical
semiconductor processing technology needed to do
this wasn't developed until 1987.

'Solar power creates no
environmental pollutants,
and only small amounts of
toxins are created in the
manufacturing process.'

energy," Swanson said. Power companies are still
learning how best to harness and store the energy
produced from such an unpredictable energy source.
If these problems are solved, Swanson said the
environmental costs of solar power would be very
low compared to other energy sources, such as coal.
Solar power creates no environmental pollutants,
and only small amounts of toxins are created in the
manufacturing process — mostly from the process
ing of silicon.
Swanson has not given up his search for a higher
efficiency solar cell. So while he tries to convince
power companies to buy his solar plants, he plans to
continue to research how to increase the efficiency
of the solar cell.
If his predictions are correct, solar power and
Swanson's cell just might be the environmentally
safe, inexpensive energy source of the next century.

Although modern solar cells cost just one—twentieth of what they were in 1950, a power plant using
either thin—film or single—crystal cells would still be five times as expensive as an equivalently sized
fossil fuel plant. Richard Swanson of Sun Power predicts his company's single—crystal cells will
become competitive by the end of the decade.
