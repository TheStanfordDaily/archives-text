## 57 hours of postseason bowl mania and nothing on 
### 
When I complete my finals, I'm
going bowling.
No, I don't mean that kind of
bowling. While temptation lies right
there at my local lanes — the urge to
break into the computerized scoring sys
tem and play Matthew Broderick-like
War Games, the compulsion to create a
new Calvin Klein fragrance from the
;scent of the spray that keeps those neo-
Beatnik rental shoes "clean," not to men
tion the allure of throwing peanut shells
into the dangling posterior cavity of a guy
named Floyd — Earl Anthony can con
sider himself safe for now.
In fact, when I arrive home for the 15-
day weekend (anything under three weeks
can't be considered a "vacation," can it?),
the only heavy lifting I intend to do will be
that of my remote control. It's time for the

most exciting of the major athletic sea
sons, namely college football, to come to
another fast and furious conclusion. That
means but one thing — that eyes will be
growing out of the backs of the heads of
those who will truly become "couch pota
toes" (can't you put an "e" there when you
pluralize it?) after witnessing the 18-game
bowl orgy before them (neatly arranged in

television air time order):
Bowling Green vs. Nevada (Las
Vegas Bowl): Bowling Green was a pow
erhouse about 70 years ago, while Neva
da is celebrating its first year in Division
IA by dropping the "Reno" from its title.
The biggest little game in the world?
BYU vs. Kansas (Aloha): Last year, it
was Dennis (Minnesota Vikings) Green
vs. Bobby (San Diego Chargers) Ross. Are
the New England Patriots and Seattle
Seahawks watching?
Utah vs. Washington State (Cop
per): Cougar quarterback Drew Bledsoe
should showcase his potential to be the
first pick in the '93 draft, while the Bowl
Coalition will be reconsidering the rules
that allowed five Western Athletic Con
ference schools, including the 6-5 Utes,
into the postseason party.

USC vs. Fresno State (Freedom):
Some teams get what they deserve. 'Nuff
said.
Hawaii vs. Illinois (Holiday): I take
back what I said about the WAC.
Wake Forest vs. Oregon (Indepen
dence): Does it seem slightly counter
intuitive for Oregonians to be rooting
against a forest? Take the spotted owls
and the points.
Baylor vs. Arizona (Hancock): Let's
play Wheel of Fortune. Bear quarterback
J.J. Joe can't buy a vowel. Wildcat signal
caller George Maalauluu can't buy a con
sonant. Oh Vanna!
Florida vs. N.C. State (Gator):
Shane Matthews vs. the ghost of Thurl
Bailey and the 1983 NCAA basketball
title. And the Wolfpack is still ranked
ahead of Stanford?

Air Force vs. Mississippi (Liberty):
The Falcons, by virtue of being the "best"
service academy, win the BYU lame
scheduling award for keeping their bowl
streak alive, while Ole Miss must be
aglow with gratification about this, their
reward for a hard-earned victory over
Mississippi State (see Peach Bowl).
Boston College vs. Tennessee (Hall
of Fame): The Eagles can toot their own
Flutie, while the Vols will prove that
their talent is now slim Pickens in the
Hangover Special, yet another distasteful
early-morning cable drama.
Georgia vs. Ohio State (Citrus): It's
Heisman hopeful Garrison Hearst vs.
sensational student Robert Smith. Mr.
Smith, it's time to go back to school.

Texas A$M vs. Notre Dame
(Cotton): Aggie coach R.C.
Slocum, who has been ranting and
raving all season about his squad
deserving a shot at the national
title, will believe every word of
Lou Holtz, that pregame hype
meister himself. Then the transi
tive property will go into effect: if
Stanford beat Notre Dame by 17
points, and Notre Dame beats
A$M by 40, the Cardinal wins the
rematch by 57. Amen.
Penn State vs. Stanford
(Blockbuster): Paterno vs. Walsh
in the "Genius Bowl," right?
Wrong. I think the uniforms
would have a hard time fitting on
the two sextagenarians. So the
outcome of one of the two bowl
games to prostitute itself com
pletely to the title sponsor (the
John Hancock Insurance Bowl is
the other) will be decided on the
merits of which team lost to BYU

and which beat Notre Dame.
Close only counts in horseshoes
and hand grenades, and the Nit
tany Lions simply don't have
what it takes.
Syracuse vs. Colorado (Fiesta):
Quarterbacks Marvin Graves and
Kordell Stewart, two of the top
five gunslingers in the game, will
shoot it out to see which of their
teams is more grossly overrated.
Washington vs. Michigan
(Rose): A Rose by any other name
would be better than this stinker.
Watch as Wolverine coach Gary
Moeller discovers how badly he
misses Desmond Howard. Cau
tion: must only be viewed by
those who still believe that Bo (2-
8) Schembechler was one of the
greatest postseason coaches in
history.
Nebraska vs. Florida State
(Orange): This game, which com
petes head-to-head with the
"brawl for it all" (see Sugar
Bowl), is a must-see, as it will
destroy two myths at once: 1)
That the Big 8 Champion is truly
the "home" team in the Sunshine

State, and 2) That the Big 8
Champion deserves to be called
champion of anything.
Miami vs. Alabama (Sugar):
The greatest team in college foot
ball will turn back the Tide.
That's right, the Hurricanes are
back-to-back, baby, and all that
will be left for 'Bama Bear Bryant
wannabe Gene Stallings is an ail
too familiar Linda Ronstadt tune:
Blue By You. Horace Copeland,
Lamar Thomas and gang will take
Heisman winner (you heard it
here first) Gino Torretta and ele
vate his draft status to new
heights, while Mr. Stallings will
reconsider the Phoenix Cardinals
head coaching job he left just a
few years ago.
North Carolina vs. Missis
sippi State (Peach): Why Jan. 2?
Also, it's Dean Smith: school vs.
Jackie Sherrill. Isn't this why
they invented probation?

Andy Eiser, one of The Daily's
catatonic sports editors, wishes to
be known affectionately as "Spud"
come Jan. 2.
