## Residences to reopen earlier than planned 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Residences will open for winter quarter
on Sunday, Jan. 3 — a day earlier than Uni
versity officials had originally planned — so
that returning students will have time to
sign up for classes.
Housing and Food Service had hoped to
save money by forcing students to wait until
Monday, Jan. 4, to move back in.
But director Keith Guy said the plan has
been waived for next quarter because de
partments have scheduled class sign-ups as
early as 8 a.m. Monday.
It "wouldn't be fair" to those who arrive
later in the day, said Guy. Returning stu
dents will now be able to enter their resi
dences after 1 p.m. Sunday.
The original plan was part of Housing and
Food Service's effort to cut its budget by saving

overtime salaries paid to employees staffing
residence offices on weekends, Guy said.
Only Wilbur Hall's residence office will
be open Jan. 3 for students changing hous
ing or entering it for the first time. The of
fice will be open from 1 to 5 p.m. for those
students who need to sign in and get keys.
"We're minimizing the expenses by just
having the one undergraduate location
open," Guy said. He did not know exactly
how much the budget-cutting measure was
supposed to save.
At the beginning of fall quarter, Guy said,
the residences' late opening didn't cause a
problem because students still had two days
to settle in until classes began. This time,
however, the office "didn't have time to work
with the faculty" to avoid difficulties.
"We thought that the problem of class
sign-ups would not be as great as
it turned out to be," he said.
Although some students have
complained about the inconve
nience of having only one day to
settle in, Row Director Diana
Conklin said those concerns were
not factors in the decision to open
early.
It was based on the "pretty
strong feeling that faculty had
not been informed of the change,"
Conklin said. "We didn't have to
look for further reasons."
For graduate students, the
decision will have little impact.

Christine Griffith, director of
graduate residences, said that
since graduate housing is always
open, only new students or those
transferring to different housing
will be affected.
For those students, she said
Escondido Village's residence office
will probably be open Sunday from
1 to 5 p.m. "We will be following
the same system as undergraduate
housing," Griffith said.
Guy and Conklin both said the
do not know what will happen
after this quarter.
"Assuming the change remains
in effect, this would be the notifica
tion" to departments to schedule
sign-ups later, Conklin said. "The
need to save money . . . hasn't
changed."
