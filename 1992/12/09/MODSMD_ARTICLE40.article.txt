# Women fall to Vols, lose top poll billing
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
The Cardinal plummeted from
its position atop the national rank
ings as the Tennessee Volunteers
stunned Stanford in overtime, 74-
73, in the championship game of
the Hawaii Wahine Classic. The
previously undefeated Cardinal (3-
1) is sure to fall to the No. 2 or No.
3 spot, while Tennessee (3-0)
expects to receive the top ranking
after its weekend performance.
Against the speedy and aggres
sive Lady Volunteer squad, Stan
ford found itself out-rebounded
and out-muscled through the
entire game.
"Tennessee is extremely ath
letic," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "They are a
big, quick and extremely physical
team."
Down by eight points at half
time, the Cardinal needed a little
luck just to send the game into
overtime.
A Rachel Hemmer basket with
50 seconds remaining cut the
deficit to three, and Stanford
began to foul its opponent in
hopes of stopping the clock and
regaining possession of the ball.
After Tennessee missed the front
end of two consecutive one-and
one free throw situations, the
Cardinal called a timeout with
four seconds left to set up one last
play.
Stanford senior Molly Gooden
bour received the inbound pass
and fired a 23-foot three-point
shot which rolled around the rim,
popped out, and then fell back
through the hoop, tying the game
as the buzzer sounded.
The Cardinal's inspirational
come-from-behind effort pleased
its eighth-year coach.
"We had an excellent come
back tonight," VanDerveer said.
TMolly hit an amazing basket. It
;was a big-time shot."
In the overtime period, the two
«quads locked horns and took
turns controlling the lead. The
JCardinal continually fed the ball

to Ail-American center Val Whit
ing, who responded with eight of
Stanford's nine overtime points.
Tennessee's Nikki McCray took
over on the other side of the
court, scoring six of her team's 10
extra-period points.
But the Cardinal's dream for
victory came to a halt in the last
few seconds of overtime when a 6-
foot jumper by Whiting fell short
of its mark.
The Cardinal will have the
opportunity to avenge this loss
when Stanford plays the Volun
teers on Dec. 21 in Knoxville,
Tenn.
Earlier in the weekend, Stan
ford rolled past teams from Illi
nois State and Hawaii to propel
itself into the tournament's
championship game.
On Friday the Cardinal handi
ly defeated Illinois State 72-56
despite a lackluster performance
by the Stanford squad.
"We did not play very well,"
VanDerveer said. "We were very
rushed. We got in horrible foul
trouble."
VanDerveer also expressed dis
appointment in the fact that the
Redbirds outrebounded her Car
dinal squad 46-34.
However, Stanford's quest for
victory remained unharmed
thanks in part to the 15-point, 10-
rebound performance of Whiting,
who was selected as an all-tourna
ment team member along with
Goodenbour. Whiting tallied five
blocks and five steals in the game.
"The thing I like about what
Val's done is she's not making a
lot of mistakes," said Van-
Derveer. "She's a smart player
that's making good decisions."
Fellow starters Chris MacMur
do, Christy Hedgpeth and Anita
Kaplan all scored in double fig
ures for the Cardinal.
Saturday, the Stanford squad
gave a more exhilarating effort,
ousting Hawaii 85-56 on its home
court.

shots, the Cardinal sprung out to
a 29-9 first half lead and never
looked back. Stanford's size
advantage over the Rainbows
enabled its front court players to
take control of the game.
"We had great contributions
from our post players," Van-
Derveer said. "Hawaii didn't have
the size to match up with us."
Center Anita Kaplan played
especially well, according to Van-
Derveer, racking up 20 points
while coming off the bench.
"In practice, Anita scores on us
a lot. We keep telling her that
she's got a great shot and that she
needs to go at it," said Hemmer,
who contributed 19 points of her
own to the Stanford cause.
According to VanDerveer,
Stanford's performance this
weekend indicates that her squad
has much to work on in the
upcoming weeks.

"We have to play a lot better
defense and do a better job on the
boards," she said. "We have to have
more intense practices and have
people concentrating on doing the
right thing."
Although VanDerveer called
the Cardinal's overall perfor
mance this weekend "very disap
pointing," she nevertheless
appeared confident when dis
cussing her outlook for the rest of
the season.
"We won't be ranked No. 1
(after losing to Tennessee), but
we're still the defending national
champs."
Stanford plays their next game
Sunday, Dec. 13, at home versus
Santa Barbara at 1:30 p.m. The Car
dinal also has a busy vacation sched
ule, as it will be hosting the Cardinal
Classic Dec. 18-19. This tournament
features competitive squads from
Florida, Harvard and Utah. Stan
ford rounds out this busy period
with away matches against Ten
nessee (televised Dec. 22 at 1 p.m.),
Cal State-Long Beach (Dec. 30) and
University of San Diego (Jan. 2).
