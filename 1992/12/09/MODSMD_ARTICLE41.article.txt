# Spikers crush Pitt
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team is facing some good
news and some bad news.
The good news is that Stanford
roared into its 12th straight
NCAA Tournament by rolling
over Pittsburgh last weekend in
the first round, thrashing the
Panthers 15-3, 15-2, 15-4. Stan
ford took all of 57 minutes to dis
pose of the largely outmatched
Pitt squad, as Cardinal hitters
laid down spike after spike on the
Panther side of the net.
The bad news? The Panthers
were the only unranked team in
Stanford's region. In fact, the rest
of Stanford's schedule in the
Mideast Regional will most likely
be comprised of top 10 teams.
Welcome to the jungle.
On the bright side, Stanford

(27-2) had little to worry about
last Friday, as the Cardinal put on
an offensive exhibition against the
Big East champion Pittsburgh
and put many points away in
three hits or less. The Cardinal
took the first two games in just
under 40 minutes, allowing a com
bined five points while posting a
.526 team hitting percentage in
game one and a .583 mark in game
two.
Head coach Don Shaw made
numerous substitutions in game
three to spread the time out, but
the Cardinal still managed to hold
Pitt to four total points in game
three and to take the match.
Pittsburgh found itself over
whelmed by the Stanford attack
immediately, unable to return
many of the well-hit balls from
the hands of Stanford's front line.
On offense, the Panthers had trouble digging and
passing balls all night, and finished with a team
hitting percentage of .000 even, or an average of
zero kills per attempt.
Ann Marie Lucanie, the Panthers' starting
junior hitter and two-time Big East Most Valu
able Player, could offer her teammates little help.
"It's not going to take one player to win the
match, and we just weren't clicking as a team,"
Lucanie said following the game. "We really have
to work well together for things to start working,
and tonight they weren't."
Lucanie finished as the Panthers' high scorer,
registering five kills, five digs, and a .000 hitting
percentage on the match.
The Cardinal, on the other hand, could do no
wrong. Senior tri-captain Bev Oden led all scorers
with 11 kills, seven digs, two blocks. Freshman
Cary Wendell had seven kills and eight digs on the
night, while freshman hitter Marnie Triefenbach,
substituting for the injured Kristi Paaso, came up
with seven kills, four digs and four blocks, though
Shaw told her only minutes before the game that
she would be starting her first Stanford match ever.
"I guess I was shocked when he asked me,"
Triefenbach said. "But I was glad I was given the
chance to play, and I guess I was more fired up
than nervous."
Among the Stanford seniors playing in their final
home match was three-time All-American Oden,
who doesn't have time to feel sentimental.

"I've had a great time playing here four years, but I
hope we're not going to be done for a while," Oden said.
"Every year we've been disappointed (in NCAA's! and
now we have a chance to turn it around."
For Stanford to accomplish that, however,
they'll have to get by what many consider the
toughest region this year â€” namely, the Mideast
Regional in Illinois. If the higher ranked teams
win all their matches, Stanford must first get by
No. 9 Penn State before it looks at N0.6 Illinois,
the host team playing on its home court, No. 3
Long Beach State and, finally, the national cham
pionship game against undefeated No. 1 UCLA, a
squad many are calling the best collegiate
women's volleyball team ever.
Shaw admits that the road ahead for his team
is a rough one, and that the convincing win over
Pittsburgh doesn't keep him from worrying about
the schedule.
"Nothing's going to put me at ease," Shaw
said. "I have my game face on every day."
Oden commented that the team is not looking
past the next game, but they all know who stands
in the way of the Cardinal's first-ever NCAA
women's volleyball championship.
"UCLA has been in the back of our minds all
year," Oden said. "We know that we eventually
have to play them, and we know we can go all the
way, that's for sure."
But are they really the greatest team in all of col
legiate volleyball history? Are they really unbeatable?
Oden quietly shook her head. "They're not
unbeatable."
