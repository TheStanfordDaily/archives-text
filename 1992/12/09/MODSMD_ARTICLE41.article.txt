# Spikers crush Pitt
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team is facing some good
news and some bad news.
The good news is that Stanford
roared into its 12th straight
NCAA Tournament by rolling
over Pittsburgh last weekend in
the first round, thrashing the
Panthers 15-3, 15-2, 15-4. Stan
ford took all of 57 minutes to dis
pose of the largely outmatched
Pitt squad, as Cardinal hitters
laid down spike after spike on the
Panther side of the net.
The bad news? The Panthers
were the only unranked team in
Stanford's region. In fact, the rest
of Stanford's schedule in the
Mideast Regional will most likely
be comprised of top 10 teams.
Welcome to the jungle.
On the bright side, Stanford

(27-2) had little to worry about
last Friday, as the Cardinal put on
an offensive exhibition against the
Big East champion Pittsburgh
and put many points away in
three hits or less. The Cardinal
took the first two games in just
under 40 minutes, allowing a com
bined five points while posting a
.526 team hitting percentage in
game one and a .583 mark in game
two.
Head coach Don Shaw made
numerous substitutions in game
three to spread the time out, but
the Cardinal still managed to hold
Pitt to four total points in game
three and to take the match.
Pittsburgh found itself over
whelmed by the Stanford attack
immediately, unable to return
many of the well-hit balls from
the hands of Stanford's front line.
