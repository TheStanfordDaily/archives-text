# Cavs rout men's hoops
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball
team spent less than 24 hours in
Charlottesville, Va., but that was
more than enough for most of
them.
The young Cardinal came
away tired and humbled from last
Saturday's matchup with Vir
ginia, as the Cavaliers shut down
Stanford's outside threats en
route to a 72-48 shellacking
before a near-capacity house at
University Hall. About the only
positive thing the Stanford play
ers could take away from the loss
was that they racked up some fre
quent flier miles on the coast-to
coast journey.
After suffering a disappointing
loss to San Jose State Thursday
night, the Cardinal (1-2) was
faced with the tough task of flying
all day Friday to play again on
Saturday for the team's third
game in four days.
"I put us in a bad situation by
scheduling this game — it was
tough," said coach Mike Mont

gomery. "But during Dead Week
and finals we're not really allowed
to play, so we'll use the next two
weeks to get healthy and get our
confidence back."
Stanford led 19-15 with 11:41
left in the first half before fatigue
set in. Well-rested Virginia (2-0)
then used a 17-2 run to take a 32-
21 lead into halftime. The Cava
liers extended their margin at the
beginning of the second half with
a 10-0 run to put the game away.
Stanford's big guns — guard
Peter Dukes and forward Brent
Williams — were a combined 2-
for-12 from the floor. As a team,
the Cardinal shot a lowly 33 per
cent from the field and, converted
only 9 of 18 free throws. Addi
tionally, Stanford was outre
bounded 53-28, and in perhaps
the most telling statistic of all,
forward Bart — yes,
Bart Lammersen — led the team
in assists with four.
Marcus Lollie led the Cardinal
with 12 points, which resulted
from an excellent 4-for-6 three
point shooting performance.
"We need to continue to work
on our offensive timing and
(defensive) rebounding," Mont
gomery said. "When we don't
rebound well, it does two things:
First, it lets the other team get
high percentage second shots;
and second, it takes us out of the
fast break and does not give
Brent a chance to be in the open
court where he does best."
Stanford should be well-rested
and breathing easier for Saturday
night's easier home contest with
Sacramento State. But after Sat
urday, the Cardinal's schedule is
less-than-inviting. Stanford will
host Howard University on Dec.
19 before traveling to Hawaii for
the Maui Invitational. Stanford
will open its Hawaiian holiday
against the LSU Tigers. Should
Stanford win, the Cardinal will
most likely matchup with defend
ing NCAA Champion Duke. If
Stanford should lose, the present
would probably be DePaul.
"We will clearly be challenged
in the tournament," Montgomery
said. "It will help to prepare us
for the Pac-10 and the types of
environments that we'll have to
play in."
Stanford will then return
home to play in its own Fry's
Invitational, facing American
University on Dec. 28 and either
Ohio or St. Mary's the following
evening. The Cardinal rounds out
its winter break schedule at home
against Santa Clara on Jan. 2.
