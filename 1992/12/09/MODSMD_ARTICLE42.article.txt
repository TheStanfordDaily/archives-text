# Cavs rout men's hoops
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
The Stanford men's basketball
team spent less than 24 hours in
Charlottesville, Va., but that was
more than enough for most of
them.
The young Cardinal came
away tired and humbled from last
Saturday's matchup with Vir
ginia, as the Cavaliers shut down
Stanford's outside threats en
route to a 72-48 shellacking
before a near-capacity house at
University Hall. About the only
positive thing the Stanford play
ers could take away from the loss
was that they racked up some fre
quent flier miles on the coast-to
coast journey.
After suffering a disappointing
loss to San Jose State Thursday
night, the Cardinal (1-2) was
faced with the tough task of flying
all day Friday to play again on
Saturday for the team's third
game in four days.
"I put us in a bad situation by
scheduling this game — it was
tough," said coach Mike Mont

gomery. "But during Dead Week
and finals we're not really allowed
to play, so we'll use the next two
weeks to get healthy and get our
confidence back."
Stanford led 19-15 with 11:41
left in the first half before fatigue
set in. Well-rested Virginia (2-0)
then used a 17-2 run to take a 32-
21 lead into halftime. The Cava
liers extended their margin at the
beginning of the second half with
a 10-0 run to put the game away.
Stanford's big guns — guard
Peter Dukes and forward Brent
Williams — were a combined 2-
for-12 from the floor. As a team,
the Cardinal shot a lowly 33 per
cent from the field and, converted
only 9 of 18 free throws. Addi
tionally, Stanford was outre
bounded 53-28, and in perhaps
the most telling statistic of all,
forward Bart — yes,
Bart Lammersen — led the team
in assists with four.
Marcus Lollie led the Cardinal
with 12 points, which resulted
from an excellent 4-for-6 three
