## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
With traditional powerhouses
like lowa State present at the Las
Vegas Invitational, Stanford's
young wrestling team (2-0) did not
expect tremendous success last
weekend.
Indeed, with the exception of
126-pound senior Dave Nowick,
no Cardinal grappler competed in
more than three rounds of the
single-elimination tournament.
"That's what I basically expect
ed," said Stanford head coach
Chris Horpel. However, he added,
his squad did meet the two objec
tives he had outlined.
The Cardinal, he said, gained
both experience and confidence
by wrestling the NCAA Champi
onship-caliber opposition.
"In a combat sport like wrest
ling, you tend to think your oppo
nent is superhuman," Horpel
said, especially in reference to
national contenders such as the
Cyclones. "But when you wrestle
them, you find out different."
Nowick came closest to placing
in the top eight of his weight divi
sion, finishing the tournament in
12th place.
After losing his opening round
19-4 to second-seeded Tony
Purler of Oklahoma State, Now
ick qualified for the consolation
bracket as Purler advanced to the

quarterfinals.
The senior won his next two
matches, defeating Farzin Daneshia of
Cal State-Fullerton 6-4 and seventh
seeded Justin Martin of Wyoming in
an overtime decision. Cal State-Bak
ersfield's Shane Rosselle then halted
Nowick's advance with a 16-6 victory.
Those who competed in three
rounds include 118-pound senior
Phil Nowick, 150-pound freshman
Tod Surmon and 158-pound sopho
more Sahlan Martin. Each won one
match and dropped two. At least
one of their losses occurred in the
consolation bracket, thus eliminat
ing them from the competition.
Freshman Jimmy Aguirre, at
134 pounds, lost his opening
round and his consolation round,
while 142-pound junior Lance
Johnson, 167-pound freshman
Nathan Lovelle and 190-pound
freshman Roger Liu all went
down in their first matches and
failed to qualify for consolation
brackets. The Cardinal posted no
entries at 177 and 275 pounds.
Stanford's next meet will be
the Cal State-Fullerton Open on
Dec. 20.
