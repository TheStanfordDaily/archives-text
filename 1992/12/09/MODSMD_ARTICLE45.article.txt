# Bev Oden winds down remarkable Stanford career
## Volleyball tri-captain hopes to end Cardinal's NCAA title drought

This woman redefines the
word "kill."
What Bev Oden does to the vol
leyball cannot accurately be called
a "kill." The volleyball isn't that
lucky. It's more like "corporal
punishment."
What she's done for Stanford
women's volleyball, however, can
accurately be called "incredible."
Oden, a senior and one of Stan
ford's three captains, has been
the anchor of the Cardinal offense
since her freshman year, and she
has the All-American titles to
prove it. Three All-American
titles, to be exact. And this year
she'll add number four.
At the end of the 1992 regular
season, Oden led the Cardinal in
five categories, with 378 kills, 4.2
kills per game, 24 aces, 112 total
blocks, and 1.2 blocks per game.
She stands third on the Cardinal
all-time kills list with 1,685, just
67 shy of sister Kim Oden's 1,751,
and ranks in the all-time top five in
both total blocks and block solos.
Oden is also one of the most
imposing and intimidating play
ers in women's collegiate volley
ball today. She can propel her 6-
foot-2 frame into the air to tower
over the top of the net, where she
can drive balls almost directly
down into opponents' feet or stop
an opposing player's spike dead in
its tracks.
Oden got her start in volleyball
in seventh grade, when her volley
ball sisters Kim and Elaina influ
enced Oden to try the sport her
self. As the sister of two accom
plished players, Bev was expected
to pick up the sport immediately,
but as she recalls, the first few
years were difficult.
"I was terrible in club, but
everyone expected me to be good,"
Oden said. "That made it hard to
be bad."
Since then, Oden has had the
toughest time not excelling in vol
leyball. Her Irvine High School
team won the CIF state finals two
years in a row, and five of her cur
rent Stanford teammates have
had the dubious honor of losing to

Bev's squad.
Oden was recruited by several
colleges, but most wanted to go to
UCLA. However, in an ironic
twist of fate, the Bruins didn't
recruit the Irvine star.
"I was so mad," Oden said. "I
decided to visit other places and
write off UCLA."
The Bruins probably wish they
could have that decision back, but
Oden decided on Stanford over
Pepperdine. Initially, Oden was
worried about people comparing
her to her sister, former Stanford
star Kim Oden.
"All through my freshman
year, people would call me Kim,"
Oden said. "It got so frustrating
after a while!"
Oden, however, spent the next
four years teaching Stanford vol

leyball fans her name, as she
quickly became one of Stanford's
top hitters. Now, in her senior
year, she holds a number of team
records and stands among the
very finest in women's volleyball
talent ever to grace Stanford Uni
versity.
But to Oden, the title of
"National Champion" is the one
she'd most like to add to her col
lection.
"We want to win â€” bad," Oden
said. "None of us have been to the
Final Four, and we know that this
year we have a great chance to do
that."
Stanford must overcome a
number of obstacles on the way to
a national championship, includ
ing a potential showdown with
No. 1 UCLA in the championship

match. UCLA has eliminated
Stanford from the NCAA Tourna
ment in each of the past two
years, and handed the Cardinal
its only two losses this year. But
Oden looks forward to revenge
against the Bruins.
"We want to beat them more
than anyone," Oden said. "We
know how close we came when they
came up here, so we know it's pos
sible. The pressure's all on them,
and I like to be the underdog."
Like many of the Bruins' oppo
nents, Oden has little trouble get
ting motivated for the defending
national champions.
"It helps that we can't stand
them," she said. "I'm glad I didn't
end up going there, because
