# Swimmers make presence felt at Texas Invitational

At the Texas Invitational in Austin last week
end, the Cardinal men's swim team performed well
against some of the top programs in the nation.
The Cardinal was led by standout performances
from junior Derek Weatherford and freshman Joe
Hudepohl, who were dubbed as "the stars of the
meet" by Stanford assistant coach Ted Knapp.
Hudepohl grabbed the first of two Cardinal vic
tories, winning the 200-yard freestyle with a
remarkable unshaved time of 1 minute, 35.35 sec
onds. The freshman from Cinncinati later stroked
to a fourth-place finish in the 100 free (44.71), a
fifth-place finish in the 1650 free (15:49.89) and a
second-place finish anchoring the 800 free relay
(Erik Maurer, Eric Diehl, Weatherford, Hude
pohl).
Weatherford also raced to a first-place finish in
his specialty, the 100 backstroke, and added sec
ond-place finishes in the 400 individual medley
(3:52.09) and the 200 back (1:44.21). All three
swims were excellent early-season races for Weath
erford, who also helped his team to second-place
finishes in the 200 medley relay (Weatherford,
Tyler Mayfield, Bill Schell, Maurer) and the afore
mentioned 800 freestyle relay.
Other notable performances came from fresh
man Mike Covert (third, 1650 free, 15:44.41),
sophomore Hay Carey (third, 200 butterfly,
1:49.57) and junior Tyler Mayfield, who beat out
teammate Kurt Grote for third place in the 200
breaststroke (2:03.50).
The top-notch finishes by Cardinal swimmers
were even more remarkable considering that
swimmers competing from Arizona and Arizona
State had rested and shaved down for the meet.
"In the end, it was a good thing that Arizona
shaved," said assistant coach Ted Knapp. "They
won a lot of races, but they also made the meet
more challenging. Our guys met that challenge.

"We didn't really do anything special going into
the meet, and given the intensity of the training
that we've been doing, the team swam fabulously,"
Knapp said.
Knapp was especially pleased with Hudepohl,
Covert, Bryan Addleman and Scott Gagner, all
members of the freshman class.
"I'm really impressed with the freshman class
in general," Knapp said. "Their performances have
been top-notch."

The freshman class may have benefited the
most from the meet at Texas. Unlike most colle
giate dual meets, which are completed in a single
afternoon, the Texas meet took three days.
"Texas was a good experience for the whole
team, but especially the freshmen," said Ray Carey.
"We all need to get used to long meets like that
because that's what NCAA's and Pac-10's are like."
"Long meets are tough early on in the season,"
said Kurt Grote, who finished fourth in the 200

breaststroke. "They're a lot easier to go into rest
ed. But Texas was our first real team effort this
year, and we kept each other up and excited."
If the team's performance at Austin is any indi
cation of how the Cardinal will fare in the regular
meet season, the team has reason to be optimistic.
"It was exciting at Texas to show that this
year's team is as tight as last year's," said Grote.
"It's a good indication that we'll be as good or
maybe even better than we've been in the past."
