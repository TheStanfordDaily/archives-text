# Women qualify for individual NCAA berths
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Last weekend, the top-ranked
Stanford women's swimming team
dominated No. 2 Texas and No. 5 Ari
zona at the Texas Invitational in
Austin.
Top performers for the Cardinal
included Jenny Thompson, Janel
Jorgensen and Lea Loveless, who all
posted NCAA qualifying marks dur
ing the meet.
Thompson bested the field in the
100-yard freestyle (49.51 seconds),
the 100 butterfly (54.42) and placed
second in the 200 free (1:47.91). Fel
low Olympian Loveless qualified with
a first place finish in the 100 back
stroke (54.90) and a second place fin
ish in the 200 back (1:56.72). Senior
co-captain Janel Jorgensen also qual
ified with a third place showing in the
200 fly (2:01.31).

Other Cardinal standouts includ
ed senior Lori Heisick, who placed
first in the 200 breaststroke (2:16.47)
and third in the 100 breast (1:03.87).
To round out the top Stanford finish
ers, Kendra Thayer placed second in
the 400 individual medley (4:20.02),
while a Cardinal relay team finished
first in the 800 free.
Although the NCAA did not score
this invitational, the Stanford
women came away feeling very confi
dent about their individual and team
performances.
"Our team is looking really good
right now," said sophomore Mary
Ellen Blanchard. "Texas and Arizona
started swimming a month before us
because they're on the semester sys
tem, and we still beat them.
"Besides that, three teams came
into the meet shaved and tapered,
but we still won over them too. This
is definitely a good sign for the rest of

the season."
In addition, Texas rested before
the meet and it showed in the
Longhorns' performance in the pool.
Their top swimmer, Olympic hopeful
Whitney Hedgepeth, edged three
Cardinal swimmers to place first in
the 200 fly, 200 back, and 200 free
events.
"We have been gearing up for this
meet," Jorgensen said. "Mentally we
were ready to race. Physically we
might not have been as ready as Ari
zona or Texas, but we made up for
that by being race-tough."
"Arizona was shaved and tapered,
Texas was well-rested, and we were
dead tired," said assistant coach Ross
Gerry. "But because of that we swam
tougher and tougher, and in the end
we were just mowing them down.
"There were a lot of come-from
behind victories for us because we
didn't have the zip or the speed they

have. But all things considered, I
think we came out on top as a team."
Gerry used the analogy of a spring
to explain the Cardinal's perfor
mance in the invitational. Right now,
he said, Stanford is working hard to
push the spring down in preparation
for the big explosion of energy at the
NCAA Championships.
Meanwhile, teams like Texas and
Arizona are pushing the spring down
a little and then they release it
halfway through the season for regu
lar meets. However, he said, they will
never build up enough energy for the
big drops in time at the end of the sea
son.
"Swimmers like Whitney Hedge
peth are posting incredible times this
early in the season," Gerry said. "But
their drops in time at the end of the
season will not be as dynamic as ours,
because we keep putting the pressure
on throughout the season."
