# Intramurals complete smooth, successful fall season
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
• Last Thursday was the end of the fall
quarter intramurals season, and accord
ing to IM student director Nick Blosser,
"It went smoothly and was successful."
More than 1,500 students participated
in the three league sports offered, as well
as the many individual tournaments
including golf, three-on-three basketball
and cross country. The league sports
offered were volleyball, inner tube water
polo and the ever-popular touch football.
Volleyball had four divisions — coed,
all women's, B division All-University
and A division All-University. The final
champions were Entropy in coed, Bok

Choy in women's, Grab Sac in B division
and Big Johnson in A division.
"I was surprised by the large number
of teams and the consistently high level
of play," said volleyball commissioner
Kris Gowen.
In inner tube water polo, the only divi
sion was coed, which featured 16 teams of
seven players each. Roble took the title,
beating Toyon in the finals.
"Toyon was the surprise of the tour
nament," said commissioner Kyle Utsu
mi. "They notched two upsets over
Schranker and Waterlags to reach the
finals."
Touch football offered three divisions
(there was no women's league) and had
over 100 teams competing. The coed title

was grabbed by the Sig Eps while Biz 2
took the A league title.
The very popular B division
with over 75 teams and ended with a
number of hotly contested playoff games.
"We had several playoff games go into
three, four and even eight overtimes,"
said football commissioner Kevin Jeffery.
Rains I was the eventual champion,
defeating Sigma Alpha Epsilon in the
title game. The Rains team is made up of
graduate students who have been com
peting for the title for the past three
years. Most of the team earn their Mas
ter's or Ph.D.'s this spring, so the mem
bers of Rains ended their Stanford intra
mural football careers on a winning note.
Last year's champions, a team from

the graduate school of economics called
the Invisible Hand, lost in the round of
eight in the playoffs to the Sigma Nu
team, which was then defeated soundly
by the SAE's in the semifinals.
The intramurals staff has a new head
this year. Howie Dallmar, who had been
the head of the IM program for more
than 20 years, passed away last Christ
mas. He has been replaced by the
women's fencing coach, Sherry Posthu
mus, who coached the Olympic women's
fencing team last summer in Barcelona.
Posthumus' era began with the institu
tion of a new forfeit policy, which forces
league teams to pay $10 for every forfeit
ed game.
"The policy has resulted in a dramatic

reduction in the number of forfeits," said
Greg Gottlieb, self-proclaimed forfeit
czar, when describing the policy's inau
gural season. "The revenue this policy
has generated will be put into the IM
Improvement Fund."
The intramurals staff is preparing for
a busy winter season which features the
new sport of pyramid ball as well as soc
cer, basketball and a myriad of individual
sports.
Registration for the winter leagues
will be held on the Thursday following
winter break and is open to all Stanford
students, faculty and staff. Many paid
referee positions are open for both bas
ketball and soccer. Interested parties
should contact the IM office.
