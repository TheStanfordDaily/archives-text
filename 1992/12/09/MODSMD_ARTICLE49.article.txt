# Schwartz feeds ego, repeats Greeks title
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
Junior David Schwartz finally
proved his worth. Not to the
Stanford community, but to him
self.
Unable to participate in con
tact sports himself due to an over
protective mother, Schwartz has
dedicated the remainder of his life
to watching games and memoriz
ing statistics. To him, it's like sex.
Only with halftime.
"How a player looks has no
effect on my picking," explained
Schwartz on his uncanny ability
to pick the winners of college and
professional football games.
"Looks really don't matter in
terms of football players.
"Basically, I used the power of
the Schwartz."
Schwartz, a member of the
University Singers, will be known
for the next 12 months as the
Greek champion — a title which,
unfortunately, conjures images of
a sweaty, overweight man emerg
ing from a public bath.
"I haven't told my parents
about it," Schwartz admitted.

"The only person I told was
[juniorl Jay Borenstein. His sup
port helped."
Schwartz-, along with the rest
of of the Greeks, defeated football
writers Ed Donovan and the con
sistently inaccurate Kevin Jef
fery. Jeffery will be leaving the
country next month.
"It's another title I can add to
my name," said the ego-driven
Schwartz. "It's something to put
on the resume." •
