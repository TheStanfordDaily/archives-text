# New federal indirect-cost regulations to be announced today

Etten declined to speculate what the end
ing of tuition remission or other changes
might cost the University, but said that
Stanford is already studying the effects of
the expected revisions and will likely have
estimates prepared by next week.
The federal government began work
ing on new indirect-cost regulations soon
after the controversy began two years ago,
when Stanford and a number of other
schools were revealed to have inadver
tently included inappropriate expenses as
indirect costs.
Indirect costs are the expenses associ
ated with research that cannot be attrib
uted to any individual project, such as
utilities and libraries, and they represent
more than 20 percent of Stanford's oper
ating budget.
The University's cost reimbursement
rate was unilaterally reduced roughly $25
million per year to 55.5 percent in April
1991.
The government bumped up the rate to
60.3 percent in October, but Van Etten es
timated last month that expected revi
sions to the federal regulations were un
likely to justify Stanford's rate going
much higher.

The ending of tuition remission —
which is expected to be phased in over a
three-year period — would force the Uni
versity to either charge the tuition of
graduate students as a direct cost of a re
search grant or pay the tuition itself.
Either option could encourage re
searchers to rely more heavily on "cheap

sistants rather than doctoral students.

accounting practices for all schools.
"They are certainly trying to find ways
to achieve uniform accounting," said
Dean of Research Robert Byer. "They will
harm research and education in attempt
ing to achieve some myth of accounting
uniformity."
Other expected revisions to the indi
rect-cost regulations are the standardiza
tion and simplification of cost-accounting

standards and the setting of pre-deter
mined multi-year cost rates.
One thing that will not change is the
continued designation of the Office of
Naval Research as the agency responsible
for overseeing Stanford. The Department
of Health and Human Resources and the
navy currently have oversight over uni
versities, and many had expected the gov
ernment to consolidate control for indi
rect costs under HHS.
New cost rates are expected to be divid
ed into only two parts — administrative
and facilities — rather than the seven ex
isting cost pools.
The administrative cost pool will likely
continue to have a 26 percent cap first im
posed by the White House more than a
year ago in the wake of the indirect-cost
controversy.
The administrative cap cost the Uni
versity about 6 percentage points and
more than $8 million in indirect costs, and
the expected 24 percent threshold could
cost Stanford even more.
The revisions are also likely to add the
expenses associated with student services
into the administrative cost pool, and this
will further decrease Stanford's cost rate
by about 1.5 percent.

controversy.
The administrative cap cost the Uni
versity about 6 percentage points and
more than $8 million in indirect costs, and
the expected 24 percent threshold could
cost Stanford even more.
The revisions are also likely to add the
expenses associated with student services
into the administrative cost pool, and this
will further decrease Stanford's cost rate
by about 1.5 percent.
Etten declined to speculate what the end
ing of tuition remission or other changes
might cost the University, but said that
Stanford is already studying the effects of
the expected revisions and will likely have
estimates prepared by next week.
The federal government began work
ing on new indirect-cost regulations soon
after the controversy began two years ago,
when Stanford and a number of other
schools were revealed to have inadver
tently included inappropriate expenses as
indirect costs.
Indirect costs are the expenses associ
ated with research that cannot be attrib
uted to any individual project, such as
utilities and libraries, and they represent
more than 20 percent of Stanford's oper
ating budget.
The University's cost reimbursement
rate was unilaterally reduced roughly $25
million per year to 55.5 percent in April
1991.
The government bumped up the rate to
60.3 percent in October, but Van Etten es
timated last month that expected revi
sions to the federal regulations were un
likely to justify Stanford's rate going
much higher.
Stanford had proposed an indirect-cost

New nationwide indirect-cost regula

the federal government today, and the ex

ford officials scrambling to calculate their
impact.
Although no one at the University re
ports to have seen the final version, the
most recent drafts indicate no substantial
changes from the revisions first reported
by The Daily more than two weeks ago.
The changes to the federal indirect
cost regulations — formally known as the
Office of Management and Budget Circu
lar A-21 — are scheduled to be published
in today's Federal Register.
The expected revision most likely to af
fect the University is the ending of tuition
remission — the practice of paying a por
tion of graduate students' tuition through
indirect costs.
Officials last year estimated that the
change could cost the University up to $12
million and possibly jeopardize the status

students.

'[Government officials] will harm research and

— Robert Byer

The ending of tuition remission —
which is expected to be phased in over a
three-year period — would force the Uni
versity to either charge the tuition of
graduate students as a direct cost of a re
search grant or pay the tuition itself.
Either option could encourage re
searchers to rely more heavily on "cheap
er" postdoctoral students as research as
sistants rather than doctoral students.
Stanford is one of only a handful of

accounting practices for all schools.
"They are certainly trying to find ways
to achieve uniform accounting," said
Dean of Research Robert Byer. "They will
harm research and education in attempt
ing to achieve some myth of accounting
uniformity."
Other expected revisions to the indi
rect-cost regulations are the standardiza
tion and simplification of cost-accounting

standards and the setting of pre-deter
mined multi-year cost rates.
One thing that will not change is the
continued designation of the Office of
Naval Research as the agency responsible
for overseeing Stanford. The Department
of Health and Human Resources and the
navy currently have oversight over uni
versities, and many had expected the gov
ernment to consolidate control for indi
rect costs under HHS.
New cost rates are expected to be divid
ed into only two parts — administrative
and facilities — rather than the seven ex
isting cost pools.
The administrative cost pool will likely
continue to have a 26 percent cap first im
posed by the White House more than a
year ago in the wake of the indirect-cost
controversy.
The administrative cap cost the Uni
versity about 6 percentage points and
more than $8 million in indirect costs, and
the expected 24 percent threshold could
cost Stanford even more.
The revisions are also likely to add the
expenses associated with student services
into the administrative cost pool, and this
will further decrease Stanford's cost rate
by about 1.5 percent.
