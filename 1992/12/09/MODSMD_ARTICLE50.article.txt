## Mexican official praises Free Trade Agreements 
### John Borland Staff writer 
Mexico's head negotiator for the North American
Free Trade Agreements painted an unshakingly posi
tive picture of the proposed liberalization of trade in a
speech at the Graduate School of Business on Friday.
"We have to face a challenge from Europe on one
side and Asia on the other," Hermenio Blanco Mendoza
told the capacity audience of students and professors in
Bishop Auditorium. "I believe the agreements will
allow the U.S. and Mexico to face that challenge."
Though refraining from mentioning President
elect Bill Clinton by name, Blanco focused for some
time on issues Clinton has expressed some public
worry over.
The opening to free trade, he said, would result in
a net creation of jobs not only in Mexico but in
Canada and the United States as well. "We've been
trying to communicate this message to the unions,
to the AFL-CIO, but the message has not been well
received," he said.
He acknowledged that there would be some real
adjustment costs, but said that the number of people
in the United States forced to change jobs as a result
of the opened borders would be small compared to
the overall number that change jobs every year.
Blanco stressed that ecological issues were not
being left out of the agreements. "For Mexico, envi
ronment is very important," he said. "Poverty is the
number one enemy of the environment."
The common perception that U.S. industries will

move production across the border to take advantage
of lax environmental regulations will be proved wrong,
he said, quoting a study claiming that Mexico's com
parative advantage is found in "clean" industries such
as agriculture and labor-intensive activities.
Blanco described the radical changes that Mexico's
economy has undergone in the last five years. "Three
words describe what we have been looking for,"he
said. "Stability, competitiveness, and social justice."
The explosion of exports bound northward is
proof of his nation's viability in the international
economy, he said. According to his figures, Mexico is
now the largest exporter of TVs and refrigerators to
the United States.
The United States and Mexico have already
begun the process of integration, according to Blan
co. U.S. exports to Mexico have tripled since 1986,
he said, and these exports are currently supporting
600,000 American jobs. "As Mexico grows, the U.S.
grows," he said.
The trade official described the mechanisms by
which the reduction of tariffs, non-tariff barriers and
other obstructions to trade and investment would
proceed. Blanco told of transition periods of three to
six years in most sectors, allowing firms in the affect
ed areas time to adjust to increased competition.
Perhaps the most important feature of the agree
ments, said Blanco, is the establishment of a system to
resolve disputes arising over the course of liberalization.
"To make us competitive, we have to bring cer
tainty to investment decisions," he said. "In NAFTA
uncertainty will, if not eliminated, be lessened."
