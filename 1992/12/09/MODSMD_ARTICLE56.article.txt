A Few Good Men

"A Few Assertive Men (and Women)"
would be a more appropriate title for Rob
Reiner's new film, "A Few Good Men." The
pre-eminence of loud speech is the only un
ambiguous thing about the movie, from the
title onwards.
"A Few Good Men" is based on the wide
ly acclaimed Broadway play of that name,
about a military trial. Two marines stand ac
cused of having murdered a fellow marine in
the process of an unofficial disciplinary ac
tion.
Though the film has all the ingredients
for a success, there seems to be something

missing.
Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) is "the right
man" chosen to head the investigation. Be
cause Kaffee has an impressive record in
plea-bargaining, top officials are confident
he will strike a deal that avoids embarrassing
the armed forces and Colonel Nathaniel Jes
sup (Jack Nicholson), the commanding offi
cer at Guantanamo Bay, where the incident
occurs.
The film's themes — split loyalties and
the pressure of expectations — are down
played as Reiner focuses on the investigation
and the trial. The details of the trial are in
teresting and make the film a successful
courtroom drama, but legal niceties alone
leave something wanting.
By neglecting the relationships in the
film, Reiner leaves the viewer disengaged.
Although Reiner toys with sexual tension be
tween Kaffee and JoAnne Galloway (Demi
Moore), a member of his team, interactions
in the film are solely functional. By the same
token, the antagonism between Jessep and
Kaffee is never developed to its full potential.
The film's story also evolves predictably.
Kaffee is the glib Harvard grad who doesn't
care about much of anything. And Galloway,
who gets passed over as chief investigator of
the case, is the determined, righteous, but
less qualified woman who will prod him
onto the right track. The film continually
makes allusions to feminist themes without
developing them.
Although Jack Nicholson's performance
as the arrogant, manipulative colonel is
completely captivating, the two lead protag
onists aren't up to par. Demi Moore's perfor
mance isn't entirely convincing, and Tom
Cruise's disposition for the heroic role re
peats itself. However, Kiefer Sutherland, as
an officer at Guantanamo, and Kevin Bacon,
as the prosecutor in the trial, are impressive
in their roles.
Comedy is frequently introduced, but is
usually too deliberate. This is unusual for
Reiner, who has directed "Spinal Tap," "The
Princess Bride" and "When Harry Met
Sally." "A Few Good Men" is a very clear de

parture from those productions.

Murphy delivers
same old stuff in
political comedy

The Distinguished mm
Gentleman

Never go to an Eddie Murphy movie ex
pecting much more than a few hearty chuck
les. That way, you'll be both surprised and
impressed when one of them aspires to any
thing grander than a lackluster showcasing
of America's favorite grin, geeky laugh and
crass wit.
Though Murphy's latest release, a semi
satirical look at the crooked dealers and
dealings of Capitol Hill, hopes to "surprise"
as well as elicit boisterous audience response,
"The Distinguished Gentleman" is a film
whose aspirations lead it on a journey to
nowhere.
When con artist Thomas Jefferson John
son (Murphy) discovers that America's most
lucrative scams are to be found in the halls
of Congress, he launches a campaign in a
Florida Congressional district whose in
cumbent, Jeff Johnson (James Garner), has
recently died. By dropping the "Thomas"
and the "-erson" from his name, he's elected
to office based solely on name recognition.
On the Hill, senior congressman Dick
Dodge (Lane Smith) ensures that the shake
down artist is placed on the most influential

committees and is given generous "contri
butions" from PACs and lobbyists. Every
thing runs smoothly until Johnson's guilty
conscience is agitated by a minister turned
senator (Charles S. Dutton) and his politi
cally active niece (Victoria Rowell).
"The Distinguished Gentleman" suc
ceeds for many of the same reasons as Mur
phy's past successes — sturdy direction,
sound casting and a screenplay that gives its
star plenty of room to shine.
While Jonathan Lynn's ("My Cousin
Vinny") direction is unobtrusive, he does
succeed in bringing some of his own artistry
to the film. His occasional reliance on long
takes and inventive pans spice up an other
wise Murphy-dependent approach to the
story.
And the comic relief in Marty Kaplan's
screenplay is like silly putty in the hands of
veteran funny man Murphy. Although the
humor, as in most Murphy films, maintains
a dirty juvenile edge, it is a tad more sophis
ticated than the summer smash
"Boomerang" — although not as funny.
Ironically, the script is also the film's
greatest weakness. Kaplan's story is inter
spersed with sequences showing the decay
of the American political system, but the
viewer never gets a sense of the seriousness
of the subject matter. Instead the scenes look
suspiciously like any other Murphy gag.
Although "The Distinguished Gentle
man" isn't a complete waste of money and
time, it's not the best backdrop for biting po
litical satire either. You'd be better off catch
ing reruns of Lynn's very own British show,
"Yes Minister," on public television, and sav
ing Murphy for a lazy, early afternoon.

son (Murphy) discovers that America's most
lucrative scams are to be found in the halls
of Congress, he launches a campaign in a
Florida Congressional district whose in
cumbent, Jeff Johnson (James Garner), has
recently died. By dropping the "Thomas"
and the "-erson" from his name, he's elected
to office based solely on name recognition.
On the Hill, senior congressman Dick
Dodge (Lane Smith) ensures that the shake
down artist is placed on the most influential

committees and is given generous "contri
butions" from PACs and lobbyists. Every
thing runs smoothly until Johnson's guilty
conscience is agitated by a minister turned
senator (Charles S. Dutton) and his politi
cally active niece (Victoria Rowell).
"The Distinguished Gentleman" suc
ceeds for many of the same reasons as Mur
phy's past successes — sturdy direction,
sound casting and a screenplay that gives its
star plenty of room to shine.
While Jonathan Lynn's ("My Cousin
Vinny") direction is unobtrusive, he does
succeed in bringing some of his own artistry
to the film. His occasional reliance on long
takes and inventive pans spice up an other
wise Murphy-dependent approach to the
story.
And the comic relief in Marty Kaplan's
screenplay is like silly putty in the hands of
veteran funny man Murphy. Although the
humor, as in most Murphy films, maintains
a dirty juvenile edge, it is a tad more sophis
ticated than the summer smash
"Boomerang" — although not as funny.
Ironically, the script is also the film's
greatest weakness. Kaplan's story is inter
spersed with sequences showing the decay
of the American political system, but the
viewer never gets a sense of the seriousness
of the subject matter. Instead the scenes look
suspiciously like any other Murphy gag.
Although "The Distinguished Gentle
man" isn't a complete waste of money and
time, it's not the best backdrop for biting po
litical satire either. You'd be better off catch
ing reruns of Lynn's very own British show,
"Yes Minister," on public television, and sav
ing Murphy for a lazy, early afternoon.

A Few Good Men

"A Few Assertive Men (and Women)"
would be a more appropriate title for Rob
Reiner's new film, "A Few Good Men." The
pre-eminence of loud speech is the only un
ambiguous thing about the movie, from the
title onwards.
"A Few Good Men" is based on the wide
ly acclaimed Broadway play of that name,
about a military trial. Two marines stand ac
cused of having murdered a fellow marine in
the process of an unofficial disciplinary ac
tion.
Though the film has all the ingredients
for a success, there seems to be something

missing.
Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) is "the right
man" chosen to head the investigation. Be
cause Kaffee has an impressive record in
plea-bargaining, top officials are confident
he will strike a deal that avoids embarrassing
the armed forces and Colonel Nathaniel Jes
sup (Jack Nicholson), the commanding offi
cer at Guantanamo Bay, where the incident
occurs.
The film's themes — split loyalties and
the pressure of expectations — are down
played as Reiner focuses on the investigation
and the trial. The details of the trial are in
teresting and make the film a successful
courtroom drama, but legal niceties alone
leave something wanting.
By neglecting the relationships in the
film, Reiner leaves the viewer disengaged.
Although Reiner toys with sexual tension be
tween Kaffee and JoAnne Galloway (Demi
Moore), a member of his team, interactions
in the film are solely functional. By the same
token, the antagonism between Jessep and
Kaffee is never developed to its full potential.
The film's story also evolves predictably.
Kaffee is the glib Harvard grad who doesn't
care about much of anything. And Galloway,
who gets passed over as chief investigator of
the case, is the determined, righteous, but
less qualified woman who will prod him
onto the right track. The film continually
makes allusions to feminist themes without
developing them.
Although Jack Nicholson's performance
as the arrogant, manipulative colonel is
completely captivating, the two lead protag
onists aren't up to par. Demi Moore's perfor
mance isn't entirely convincing, and Tom
Cruise's disposition for the heroic role re
peats itself. However, Kiefer Sutherland, as
an officer at Guantanamo, and Kevin Bacon,
as the prosecutor in the trial, are impressive
in their roles.
Comedy is frequently introduced, but is
usually too deliberate. This is unusual for
Reiner, who has directed "Spinal Tap," "The
Princess Bride" and "When Harry Met
Sally." "A Few Good Men" is a very clear de

parture from those productions.

Murphy delivers
same old stuff in
political comedy

The Distinguished mm
Gentleman

Never go to an Eddie Murphy movie ex
pecting much more than a few hearty chuck
les. That way, you'll be both surprised and
impressed when one of them aspires to any
thing grander than a lackluster showcasing
of America's favorite grin, geeky laugh and
crass wit.
Though Murphy's latest release, a semi
satirical look at the crooked dealers and
dealings of Capitol Hill, hopes to "surprise"
as well as elicit boisterous audience response,
"The Distinguished Gentleman" is a film
whose aspirations lead it on a journey to
nowhere.
