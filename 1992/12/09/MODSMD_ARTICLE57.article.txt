Christmas is perhaps the most paradoxi
cal occasion in human existence. Tis the sea
son of giving, the season of joy, the season of
curling up under a warm blanket in front of
the television with a mug of hot cider and
watching "It's A Wonderful Life."
But Christmas is also the time of sifting
through humongous disorganized sale racks,
playing goofy mind games with people to figure
out what they want, and rushing for that covet
ed parking space. Where's the joy? Where's the
giving spirit? Where's Jimmy Stewart?
This year, when it comes to shopping for
gifts, make it easy on yourself. Set your wan
dering eyes upon these goodies:

Gotta Go
Christmas is the time for electronic gizmos.
The best new techno toy for this season is the
$15 Gotta Go.
Gotta Go is a device that hooks up to your
phone and imitates the call-waiting clicking
noise. When you find yourself stuck in an un
desirable conversation with that weirdo from
your freshman dorm, you can press a button
and say, "Oops, gotta go."
If you have real call-waiting, Gotta Go will
even allow you to hold down the phone's
switch hook to make it seem like you're
putting the person on hold, then you can let
it go and ditch the conversation.
Gotta Go is sold through mail-order cata
logs and may also be available in some de
partment stores. But if you can't find it,
Macy's has a wide assortment of other bat
tery-powered gadgets. Slippers with lights on
the toes are the highlight of this year's selec
tion and cost $29.90 for adult sizes.
If you're looking for something a little more
practical for someone who has a nasty habit of
forgetting to rewind video tapes, you can pur
chase special video tape rewinders. They cost
around $15 at Target. But really now, what is
the blasted rewind button for then?
Investing in literature
In search of something for someone who
likes to read, yet also likes things that could be

worth a lot some day? Then try the really nifty
literary classics that have been turned into
comic books.
The Classics Illustrated series includes ti
des like "Moby Dick," "Hamlet" and "Cyrano
de Bergerac." They are available at Lee's
Comics on El Camino and cost around $4.
Rumor has it, though, that the publisher
of Classics Illustrated is going out of business.
Translation: They could actually be worth
something in the future.
A helpful hint before you go comic shop
ping: Check your Stanford directory for any
coupons. Comic stores like us, so take advan
tage of it.
Nooses of death
The most cliche article of clothing to give
is the tie. Countless fathers everywhere fall
victim to nooses of death every year.
So why break tradition?
The tie seems to represent that evil, stuffy,
business side of life. So poke fun at it
Reach that state of infinite resignation and
take a step into the absurd; by rejecting that
part of life, you can actually embrace it.
Ties are where some of today's most pro
gressive fashion statements are made. Aside
from the traditional fish ties, there are chick
en ties, cow ties, pig ties, "naked lady" ties,
Elvis ties and Marilyn Monroe ties.
Costs range from the relatively cheap
(polyester) to the rather expensive (handwo
ven silk). The key to tie-buying lies in making
that perfect statement. Ties can say anything
from"I hate hanging around this bozo's
neck" to "Hey, baby, I'd like to rest on your
chest." Remember to consider which kind of
Dad you have.
Busts
Busts are great. Really. The ideal decora
tion for any house, dorm room or office, they
represent an alluring air of high society and
intellectual appreciation of famous people.
They can also be pretty funny.
The best selection of busts in the peninsu
la happens to just be down the street from
Stanford at Greenworld Nursery, located at
the corner of El Camino and Page Mill.
The likes of Dante, Christ, and typically
busty figures such as Beethoven grace
Greenworld's shelves. But the action reaches
a climax with Elvis busts: both the young,
clean-cut Elvis and the overweight, strung
out one.
If you can't find what you truly want, you
can order from a catalog of over 2,000 other
plaster works of art, including pillars, stat
uettes and fountains. Special orders take any
where from two days to two weeks to arrive.
Pieces range in color from white, black,
gold, and that eerie southwesternish pink
stuff and are priced from $10 for a small stat
uette to $125 for a fountain.
Come and play
If you're looking for something more
along the lines of clothing, there are a few
items you can never go wrong with.
Ah, Sesame Street.
Although Kermit isn't employed by CNN
and won't do flash reports from Somalia, you
can still wear those youthful fantasies.
Sesame Street clothing is available at your
local Sesame Street Store and ranges from $12
to $14 for regular T-shirts and a few bucks

more for long-sleeve tees and sweat shirts.
Designs include single characters, group
portraits and duos of all the classic Sesame
Street characters: Oscar, Grover, Bert and
Ernie, Big Bird and others.
Chia rams
Foliage makes another great gift. Plants can
replenish the oxygen supply in your room and
at the same time shade your napping room
mate. They can be found in shades of green
that can even match the Mirrielees carpet, or
in colors that rival your J. Crew boxers.
Plants range in size from smaller pocket-size
plants to larger potted trees that can turn your
room into a Tarzan-esque jungle. A six-foot
palm tree can go for about $20, with smaller
house plants costing you some spare change.
And to find the perfect green gift for the
person with a black thumb, search out the
Chia. Chia pets are available in a wide variety
of animal types — from the cute puppy to the
fearsome ram. And they're easy to take care of.
After the Chia pet gets old and withered,

the leftover greenery can be shaved. And with
a little Bleu Cheese dressing, it can top off a
great salad.
Goldfish, cars and stinky cheese
Still stuck?
Goldfish always make great pals.
Children's books are also really good gifts.
Authors like Chris Van Allsburgh are sure
bets, and check out "The Stinky Cheese Man
and Other Fairly Stupid Tales" by John Shus
ka.
Everyone can always use a new car. Many
dealerships are having great end-of-the-year
close-out sales, with BMWs starting at only
$25,000.
The key to good holiday shopping is to not
get stressed out. Have fun. Wear jingle bells.
Schmooze with clerks. Pass out smiles. Think
creatively. Go that extra mile to get that
cheesy, yet cosmically wonderful gift. And
don't be afraid to ask people questions about
stuff — it really helps. And it just might get
you a date.

The seemingly generic necktie can also
be the ultimate form of self-expression.

To appease your Birkenstock-wearing earth-muffin friends, buy them a plant. If they're
a little on the wild side, buy them a Chia pet.
