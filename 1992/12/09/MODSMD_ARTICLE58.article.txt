# For the sports nut who has it all
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Everyone knows at least one sports nut
who reads the sports section from cover to
cover, perhaps more than once; who can
not only rattle off players' current statistics,
but also their jersey numbers; whose idea of
a perfect evening is to be plopped in front of
the television with a remote control and an
ESPN college basketball triple-header.
And if you've given that certain some
one enough golf club covers and Sports Il
lustrated subscriptions, ideas for presents
may seem hard to come by — unless you
venture over to the Stanford Shopping
Center. For amid Macy's and Laura Ashley
is the answer to every sports fan's wish list:
Sports Central, which calls itself "the ulti
mate sports bookstore."
It's true. Entire sections are devoted to
football, baseball, basketball, hockey, ten
nis and more. In addition to books, the
store carries sports posters, postcards,
magazines, newspapers, videos, pins and,
yes, neckties of your favorite teams.

Life-size cardboard cutouts are among
the many gift Ideas for sports fiends at
Sports Central, a sports bookstore lo
cated at the Stanford Shopping Center.
Some gift suggestions:
•A very statesmanlike sports
necktie: Available in polyester
($19.95) or silk ($34.95), these ties
will spice up any suit. Some ties
sport local favorites like the San
Francisco 49ers, the San Jose
Sharks and the Los Angeles
Raiders; others feature Harley
Davidson motorcycles, golf clubs
and billiards. And, of course, what
would a tie rack be without a tie for
Da Bears?
•Glow-in-the-dark sports logo

boxer shorts ($14.95): With a vari
ety of sports to choose from, the
main incentive for purchasing
these is to be able to make those
plays late at night.
•The USA Today Sports Atlas
($12.95): Sure, most people have an
atlas, but the USA Today atlas has
that all-important information for
every sports diehard — the loca
tions of every major stadium and
recreational area in the United
States, organized by region. A must
for the car.
•Life-size cutouts of favorite
sports figures ($29.95): Your
friends always talk about how great
they are; here's your chance to see

how they really measure up.
•Metabol II ($26.95 for a 2.2-
pound tub): This chocolate-fla
vored metabolic optimizer drink
mix is the healthy way to larger mus
cles for that special someone who's
still trying to buff up after two years
of pumping iron at Encina Gym.
•And, of course, a whole lot of
books.

Central along with Phileas Fogg's
Books, also in the Stanford mall. An
avid runner, he was inspired to cre
ate Sports Central by Sportspages,
an all-sports bookstore in England,
where he was running the London

Marathon in 1989.
The store, which opened in July,
is one of only three all-sports book
stores in the United States, and one
of four of its kind in the world.
Sports Central is linked up to a
Books-In-Print mainframe com
puter, which has data on more than
one million titles and is updated
weekly, allowing the store access to
all books in the United States. The
store is also linked to Videos-In-
Print, a 75,000-title database.
And if you can't find the title you
want on the shelf, the bookstore will
find it for you and ship it anywhere in
the world — free gift wrap included.
The store also sponsors exhibits

and Thursday-night lectures orga
nized by a community advisory
board of men and women athle es,
broadcasters, writers, coaches and
administrators, including six p o
ple with Stanford affiliation. Recont
lecturers have included sports
writer Glenn Dickey of the San
Francisco Chronicle, Stanford
football announcer Bob Murphy
and Stanford women's basket' ill
coach Tara VanDerveer.
On Thursday, Dec. 10, Sports
Central will host a holiday book
signing with Cardinal head footl all
coach Bill Walsh, who will autograph
"Building a Champion," his new
book on his years with the 49ers.

would a tie rack be without a tie for
Da Bears?
•Glow-in-the-dark sports logo

boxer shorts ($14.95): With a vari
ety of sports to choose from, the
main incentive for purchasing
these is to be able to make those
plays late at night.
•The USA Today Sports Atlas
($12.95): Sure, most people have an
atlas, but the USA Today atlas has
that all-important information for
every sports diehard — the loca
tions of every major stadium and
recreational area in the United
States, organized by region. A must
for the car.

sports figures ($29.95): Your
friends always talk about how great
they are; here's your chance to see

how they really measure up.
•Metabol II ($26.95 for a 2.2-
pound tub): This chocolate-fla
vored metabolic optimizer drink
mix is the healthy way to larger mus
cles for that special someone who's
still trying to buff up after two years
of pumping iron at Encina Gym.
•And, of course, a whole lot of
books.
Stanford Business School alum
nus Fred Hornbruch owns Sports
Central along with Phileas Fogg's
Books, also in the Stanford mall. An
avid runner, he was inspired to cre
ate Sports Central by Sportspages,
an all-sports bookstore in England,
where he was running the London

Marathon in 1989.
The store, which opened in July,
is one of only three all-sports book
stores in the United States, and one
of four of its kind in the world.
Sports Central is linked up to a
Books-In-Print mainframe com
puter, which has data on more than
one million titles and is updated
weekly, allowing the store access to
all books in the United States. The
store is also linked to Videos-In-
Print, a 75,000-title database.
And if you can't find the title you
want on the shelf, the bookstore will
find it for you and ship it anywhere in
the world — free gift wrap included.
The store also sponsors exhibits

and Thursday-night lectures orga
nized by a community advisory
board of men and women athle es,
broadcasters, writers, coaches and
administrators, including six p o
ple with Stanford affiliation. Recont
lecturers have included sports
writer Glenn Dickey of the San
Francisco Chronicle, Stanford
football announcer Bob Murphy
and Stanford women's basket' ill
coach Tara VanDerveer.
On Thursday, Dec. 10, Sports
Central will host a holiday book
signing with Cardinal head footl all
coach Bill Walsh, who will autograph
"Building a Champion," his new
book on his years with the 49ers.
