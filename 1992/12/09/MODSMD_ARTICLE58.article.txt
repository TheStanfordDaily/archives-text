# For the sports nut who has it all
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Everyone knows at least one sports nut
who reads the sports section from cover to
cover, perhaps more than once; who can
not only rattle off players' current statistics,
but also their jersey numbers; whose idea of
a perfect evening is to be plopped in front of
the television with a remote control and an
ESPN college basketball triple-header.
And if you've given that certain some
one enough golf club covers and Sports Il
lustrated subscriptions, ideas for presents
may seem hard to come by â€” unless you
venture over to the Stanford Shopping
Center. For amid Macy's and Laura Ashley
is the answer to every sports fan's wish list:
Sports Central, which calls itself "the ulti
mate sports bookstore."
It's true. Entire sections are devoted to
football, baseball, basketball, hockey, ten
nis and more. In addition to books, the
store carries sports posters, postcards,
magazines, newspapers, videos, pins and,
yes, neckties of your favorite teams.
