# INTERMISSION'S NOTES on
## SURVIVING CIV FINALS 
### KIMBERLY CHRISMAN JOEL STEIN ILLUSTRATIONS BY DAN KIM 
These Notes were prepared for you, the humble
freshman, by a team of experts (whose ClV
grade/pages-read ratio, rest assured, is very
impressive) because you were too busy giving
each other "Platonic" backrubs to learn what
Platonic means.
They are intended as a supplementary aid to serious
students freeing themselves from interminable and dis
tracting reading.
These Notes are not, however, incontrovertible. It is
important to remember that there are many interpreta
tions of any great work of literature. (However, there is
only one for the African creation myth, "Bumba Vomits

st. Augustine's Confessions
Summary
Originally subtitled "I was a Teenage
Manichee," Augustine's autobiographical tell-all
novel and Deep Thoughts treasury recounts the
saint-to-be's corrupt youth and subsequent reli
gious conversion after stealing some fruit and
obsessing over his mother. Over and over and over
again. There's more guilt in this one than in the
entire Jewish religion.
Commentary
Augustine speaks for all CIV students when he
says:"I was obliged to memorize the wanderings of
a hero named Aeneas, while in the meantime I
failed to remember my own erratic ways. I learned
to lament the death of Dido, who killed herself for
love, while all the time, in the midst of these
things, I was dying." Shows how much things have
changed since the fourth century.
Bonus Points
Write your very own "confession." Invent story
about remote-control bomb in CIV lecturer's
office. Hope for sainthood.

unquestioning acceptance of any random interpretation,
but of a very specific, feminist/socialist/rainforist one.
These Notes are a valuable educational tool, and, if
properly used, can be snuck into the test inside your bra.
We here at Intermission Notes, however, are in no way
recommending that you wear a bra.
Properly used, these notes can save your bony little
ass while giving you time for more valuable pursuits —
that is, to the heightening of perception and awareness,
and the attainment of maturity by continuing to — in
Socrates' famous words from "Bill and Ted's Excellent
Adventure" — "Party on, dude."

Virgil's The Aeneid
Summary
See "The Odyssey."
List of Characters
Despite that marathon "brief glossary" at the
end of the book, the only ones you'll need to know
are Dido, Aeneas and Virgil, who at one point
takes a trip through Hell with his pal Dante and

Homer s The Odyssey
Summary
See "The Aeneid "
Commentary
Every section leader has a different brilliant
take on what "The Odyssey" is all about. Is it a
nautical map of the Ancient World? A lotus
induced hallucination? An early feminist mani
festo, actually written by a blue-haired woman
named Marge? The beauty of Homer's epic poem
is that it can mean whatever your section leader
wants it to. Borrow a new-found friend's notes for
this one.
Bonus Points
Differentiate Charybdis from Scylla using
Police lyrics.
