# The 						Epic of Gilgamesh
## 
### 
Summary
This 5,000-year-old tale of the history and
hubris of the real-life king of Uruk ... tablets shat
tered by baffled scholars ... obscure references to
"stone things" ... amateurish cuneiform ... major
chunks missing ever since
A Mesopotamian Mel Gibson, Gilgamesh is
"two-thirds divine, one-third human," and "a whole
lotta man." Tireless sidekick Enkidu is raised by wild
beasts but gets emasculated big time by the harlot.
Only the harlot lives. Best not read into it.
Commentary
"Harlot" means "whore." Gilgamesh means
"man of below-average intelligence stuck on an
uncharted desert isle." Enkidu means nothing.
Despite what your section leader tells you,
"Gilgamesh" has absolutely no modern relevance.
But the imaginative ClVster can come up with plen
ty of homoerotic overtones, phallic symbols and
postmodern feminist paradigms in a finals-week
pinch. Boldly attach metaphorical meaning to
such vague plot elements as the "plant of rejuvena
tion," the "Bull of Heaven" and those ever-intrigu
ing "stone things." Your guess is as good as anyone's,
unless, of course, your section leader happens to be
Mesopotamian.
Bonus Points
"Constantinople," not "Istanbul."
