# Dante Alighieri's The Inferno
## 
### 
Summary
Dante narrates a slide show of his spring break
trip through the Netherworld. The word "bolgia" is
thrown about with a reckless abandon not seen
again until the advent of Penthouse Forum letters.
Innovative torture methods are appealingly gory,
but don't bother to memorize them, you'll only be
asked about Beatrice — a symbol of Divine Love,
kind of like the hometown honey who's about to
break up with you. Note: the City of Dis is not the
place of punishment for people who blow off dates.
Commentary
Always refer to Dante by first name. He was that
kind of guy.

have you committed? Score one point for each sin. Be

gets Dante to plug his falling-in-the-NYT-
Bestsellers-list tome through a gratuitous cameo as
