# The 						Bible
## 
### 
Summary
God creates world over which he presumably —
as the almighty being — has complete control.
Things happen that piss him off. He becomes an
angry, vengeful God. Then he knocks up a virgin,
feels guilty and gets benevolent again. Reminiscent
of several early-'Bos Anthony Michael Hall movies.
Commentary
Anything your section leader says about The
Bible can be disputed on "theological" grounds.
Originally written in Hebrew, The Bible contains a
questionable number of men over 200 years old who
get to "know" nubile virgins. Not to be confused
with "Paradise Lost" or any Ayn Rand novel.
List of Characters
God. Large, powerful — nay, omnipotent — being
of unspecified race or gender. Usually played by
George Burns.
Adam. First man to sin. First man, period. Hence,
very popular with the ladies.
Eve. Caused more damage to the feminist movement
than Camille Paglia.
Satan. Also called Lucifer, Beelzebub, the Prince of
Darkness, the Evil One, Mephistopheles, the Host of
Hell, the Devil and "Mister-Know-it-all." Bad guy
here.
Moses. Great leader and spiritualist. Lousy naviga
tor. Looked strikingly similar to Charlton Heston.
Noah. First Hebrew to try LSD. Had paranoid hallu
cinations involving a giant "water thing," leading to
a strange affinity for zoo animals.
Review Questions and Essay Topics
1. Is there a God? What can S/He do that your
section leader can't? Explain in a well-developed
essay.
2. The Bible tells us that the world was created
in six days. How is this possible? Explain in a well
developed essay.
Bonus Points
Use words "usurers," "concubines" and "damn
Jew bankers" in one sentence.
