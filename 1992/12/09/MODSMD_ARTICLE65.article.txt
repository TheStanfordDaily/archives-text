# Sappho

### 
Summary
Emily Dickinson had nothing on this lesbian
minimalist poet. Sappho's sixth-century papyrus
scrolls rival die Madonna book in poor binding and
homoerotic content. Not much is known about her
personal history, which means it probably won't be
on the test.
Easy-to-memorize verses include such perennial
bits o' wisdom as, "If you are squeamish, don't prod
the beach rubble." That's the whole poem, folks.
Commentary
None of the poems make sense.
