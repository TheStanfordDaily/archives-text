# The
						Lais of Marie de France
## 
### 
Summary
Boy meets girl. Boy kills girl's husband. Boy
turns into wild animal. They have sex.
Commentary
They threw this into the curriculum for a reason.
That reason happened to involve a hostile takeover of
the president's office. But, for you, that reason starts
with an "P and ends with an "eminism." Put away the
Marxist arguments against the oppression of the serfs
and leave your penis at the door.
List of Characters
Most characters have unpronounceable medieval
names, but Marie identifies them by tides and distin
guishing features and you should do the same:
A woman who was worthy and attractive in
appearance.
A young man who was well known amongst his
peers for his "jousting" ability.
A well-hung Asian dude.
Bonus Points
Write in French. Address etymology of "Lais."
