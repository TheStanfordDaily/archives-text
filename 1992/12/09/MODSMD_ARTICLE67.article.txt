# Bonfire of the Brooklynites
## 
### Tammic Edwards Staff writer 
"Some will go home and see that
the fire is not on my stage but in their
mirror," says Assoc. Drama Prof.
Anna Deavere Smith about her
widely acclaimed one-woman show,
"Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights,
Brooklyn and Other Identities."
In "Fires," which will play to two
sold-out audiences in Little Theater
this week, Smith explores racial
identities, impersonating 29 differ
ent members of the Crown Heights
community in Brooklyn, New York.
The 90-minute show is the 10th
work in Smith's series of plays
begun nine years ago titled "On the
Road: A Search for American Char
acter." The purpose of these shows,
all but one of which have been one
woman productions, is to look at
how differences — in this case, race
and ethnicity — fuel the fire be
tween groups in America.
"Fires" focuses on the 1991 sum
mer incident in which Gavin Cato, a
7-year-old African-American
youth, was fatally hit by a car from
the motorcade of Lubavitcher leader
Rebbe Menechem Schneerson.
The Cato death was a spark that
exploded a powder keg of histori
cally unfriendly relations in Crown
Heights between the African-
Americans and the Lubavitchers, an
ultra-orthodox Hasidic sect.
Angry African-Americans
pointed to the child's death as an ex
ample of the Jews' discriminatory
attitude toward African-Ameri
cans, charging that a private Lubav
itcher ambulance attended the car's
driver while Cato perished waiting
for a city ambulance. In retaliation,
a gang of African-American youths
attacked and killed Lubavitcher
Yankel Rosenbaum later that night.
To research her show, Smith in
terviewed various community
members and figures involved in

the Cato incident, recording the
conversations and later using their
quotes as dialogue for her show. In
the show, she repeats the stories of
29 of the interviewees, word for
word, gesture for gesture, as they
were told to her.
The result of this toil is a power
ful, emotional trip into the Ameri
can psyche. Reminiscent, in its sub
tlety, of Tom Wolfe's literary best
seller "Bonfire of the Vanities,"
Smith's "Fires" relies on the
painstakingingly recreated words
and actions of its characters to con-

'Fires' conveys the
complexities of the
frustration and ha
tred that accompa
ny ethnic division.

vey the complexities of the frustra
tion and hatred that accompany eth
nic division and misunderstanding.
The characters in her show in
clude a youth present at the scene,
Rosenbaum's brother, Rev. Al
Sharpton, community activist
Sonny Carson, various rap artists
and a Jewish grandmother.
But audiences will no doubt be
inspired and awe-struck by Smith
herself. A graduate of Beaver Col
lege and San Francisco's American
Conservatory Theater, Smith has
made one-woman shows her signa
ture, learning early in her career
that conventional theater boxed her
in.
"The one type of character I was
usually given to play was most likely
a different stereotype of the black
woman. I was looking for my own
social voice," she said. "Doing my
own one-woman pieces quickly al

lowed me to find that voice."
The Crown Heights incident
grabbed Smith's attention as a
unique situation with all the hidden
complexities she wanted to portray.
"These are two very visible commu
nities. There's no compromising, no
small talk about getting along. The
truth comes out because there are
no attempts to mask it in niceties."
For the most part Smith found
her subjects open, even anxious, to
speak to her. "Many people felt as if
their story wasn't being told," she
said. They saw this as a way to get
their voices heard."
Smith decided that despite the
extensive media coverage, there
were "still places that only a story
teller could go and stories that only
a storyteller could get out."
Smith sees the raw, undiluted
views and attitudes that come
through the dialogue as a strength
of the play. "I would love to see a
world without hatred. In order to
work for these things, we have to
understand the real nature of the
problems."
"Fires" began as a two week show
in New York but was extended
throughout most of the summer.
Smith has also taken it on tour to
Harvard, Princeton and Brown.
"In all these privileged places
where I've taken the show, I've
found that all students aren't as priv
ileged as you think," she said. "And
I'm not talking about the marginal
ized or minority students either.
Students are able to identify with
what they see on stage in themselves.
"As the power positions shift in
this country, people aren't so sure of
anything anymore," she said. "And
that makes them fearful — starts
their fire."
Smith said she sees the impor
tance of race and ethnicity even in
her acting classes at Stanford. In a
previous class she taught dealing
with ethnicity and gender, students

often digressed from acting and em
barked on revealing discussions
about race and gender. "The results
were more poignant than any dra
matic scene I could have given them
on the subject," she said.
Smith's hugely successful show
has served to catapult her career.
She has appeared on the "Arsenio
Hall Show" and recently wrapped
up work on two feature films,
"Dave" with Kevin Kline and
Sigourney Weaver, and an untitled
Jonathan Demme/Tom Hanks col
laboration.
Her current efforts are being di
rected toward a piece chronicling the
history of the Alvin Ailey Dance
Company, commissioned by director
Judith Jamieson, who brought her
entire dance troupe to see "Fires."
Smith is also working on a show

about the Los Angeles riots, which
also includes new feedback from
the Crown Heights communities
about the acquittal of the young
man charged with Rosenbaum's
death.
Smith said she hasn't had time to
look beyond these projects. For
now, she hopes her work opens
doors for others in American the
ater. "1 hope this show changes the
way theaters define their con
stituencies [and] makes them more
inclusive of different voices."

"Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights,
Brooklyn and Other Voices" will play
at Little Theater at Bp. m. Dec. 9-10.
The show is free, but tickets have been
sold out. For more information, call

ileged as you think," she said. "And

"As the power positions shift in
this country, people aren't so sure of
anything anymore," she said. "And
that makes them fearful — starts
their fire."
Smith said she sees the impor
tance of race and ethnicity even in
her acting classes at Stanford. In a
previous class she taught dealing
with ethnicity and gender, students

often digressed from acting and em
barked on revealing discussions
about race and gender. "The results
were more poignant than any dra
matic scene I could have given them
on the subject," she said.
Smith's hugely successful show
has served to catapult her career.
She has appeared on the "Arsenio
Hall Show" and recently wrapped
up work on two feature films,
"Dave" with Kevin Kline and
Sigourney Weaver, and an untitled
Jonathan Demme/Tom Hanks col
laboration.
Her current efforts are being di
rected toward a piece chronicling the
history of the Alvin Ailey Dance
Company, commissioned by director
Judith Jamieson, who brought her
entire dance troupe to see "Fires."
Smith is also working on a show

about the Los Angeles riots, which
also includes new feedback from
the Crown Heights communities
about the acquittal of the young
man charged with Rosenbaum's
death.
Smith said she hasn't had time to
look beyond these projects. For
now, she hopes her work opens
doors for others in American the
ater. "1 hope this show changes the
way theaters define their con
stituencies [and] makes them more
inclusive of different voices."

"Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights,
Brooklyn and Other Voices" will play
at Little Theater at Bp. m. Dec. 9-10.
The show is free, but tickets have been
sold out. For more information, call

Assoc. Drama Prof. Anna Deavere Smith's one-woman show, "Fires
in the Mirror," explores racial tensions in Brooklyn's Crown Heights.
"Some will go home and see that
the fire is not on my stage but in their
mirror," says Assoc. Drama Prof.
Anna Deavere Smith about her
widely acclaimed one-woman show,
"Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights,
Brooklyn and Other Identities."
In "Fires," which will play to two
sold-out audiences in Little Theater
this week, Smith explores racial
identities, impersonating 29 differ
ent members of the Crown Heights
community in Brooklyn, New York.
The 90-minute show is the 10th
work in Smith's series of plays
begun nine years ago titled "On the
Road: A Search for American Char
acter." The purpose of these shows,
all but one of which have been one
woman productions, is to look at
how differences — in this case, race
and ethnicity — fuel the fire be
tween groups in America.
"Fires" focuses on the 1991 sum
mer incident in which Gavin Cato, a
7-year-old African-American
youth, was fatally hit by a car from
the motorcade of Lubavitcher leader
Rebbe Menechem Schneerson.
The Cato death was a spark that
exploded a powder keg of histori
cally unfriendly relations in Crown
Heights between the African-
Americans and the Lubavitchers, an
ultra-orthodox Hasidic sect.
Angry African-Americans
pointed to the child's death as an ex
ample of the Jews' discriminatory
attitude toward African-Ameri
cans, charging that a private Lubav
itcher ambulance attended the car's
driver while Cato perished waiting
for a city ambulance. In retaliation,
a gang of African-American youths
attacked and killed Lubavitcher
Yankel Rosenbaum later that night.
To research her show, Smith in
terviewed various community
members and figures involved in

the Cato incident, recording the
conversations and later using their
quotes as dialogue for her show. In
the show, she repeats the stories of
29 of the interviewees, word for
word, gesture for gesture, as they
were told to her.
The result of this toil is a power
ful, emotional trip into the Ameri
can psyche. Reminiscent, in its sub
tlety, of Tom Wolfe's literary best
seller "Bonfire of the Vanities,"
Smith's "Fires" relies on the
painstakingingly recreated words
and actions of its characters to con-

'Fires' conveys the
complexities of the
frustration and ha
tred that accompa
ny ethnic division.

vey the complexities of the frustra
tion and hatred that accompany eth
nic division and misunderstanding.
The characters in her show in
clude a youth present at the scene,
Rosenbaum's brother, Rev. Al
Sharpton, community activist
Sonny Carson, various rap artists
and a Jewish grandmother.
But audiences will no doubt be
inspired and awe-struck by Smith
herself. A graduate of Beaver Col
lege and San Francisco's American
Conservatory Theater, Smith has
made one-woman shows her signa
ture, learning early in her career
that conventional theater boxed her
in.
"The one type of character I was
usually given to play was most likely
a different stereotype of the black
woman. I was looking for my own
social voice," she said. "Doing my
own one-woman pieces quickly al

lowed me to find that voice."
The Crown Heights incident
grabbed Smith's attention as a
unique situation with all the hidden
complexities she wanted to portray.
"These are two very visible commu
nities. There's no compromising, no
small talk about getting along. The
truth comes out because there are
no attempts to mask it in niceties."
For the most part Smith found
her subjects open, even anxious, to
speak to her. "Many people felt as if
their story wasn't being told," she
said. They saw this as a way to get
their voices heard."
Smith decided that despite the
extensive media coverage, there
were "still places that only a story
teller could go and stories that only
a storyteller could get out."
Smith sees the raw, undiluted
views and attitudes that come
through the dialogue as a strength
of the play. "I would love to see a
world without hatred. In order to
work for these things, we have to
understand the real nature of the
problems."
"Fires" began as a two week show
in New York but was extended
throughout most of the summer.
Smith has also taken it on tour to
Harvard, Princeton and Brown.
"In all these privileged places
where I've taken the show, I've
found that all students aren't as priv
ileged as you think," she said. "And
I'm not talking about the marginal
