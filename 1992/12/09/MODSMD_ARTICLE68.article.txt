A portrait of a junkie who fixes furniture.
An investigation of seal-shooting off the coast
of Marin. The story of a 90-year-old peace ac
tivist. While other students have been turning
pages in preparation for finals, the 12 first
year students of Stanford's Documentary Film
Program have been editing reels in prepara
tion for their final screening.
Next week they will present the three
minute black-and-white documentaries that
are the products of weeks of intensive labor.
The two-year graduate program is for stu
dents with some previous filmmaking experi
ence and "a passionate interest in documen
tary film," explained instructors Kris Samuel
son and Jan Krawitz. The students learn every
aspect of film production from scripting and
directing to editing and sound mixing.
Stanford's program, a division of the
Communication Department, is currently

the only graduate film school that
focuses exclusively on documentary
film, and has achieved a worldwide
reputation for excellence. Two years
ago in New Delhi, film student Kim
Johnson met a camera person
whose work she admired and asked
him how he had mastered his trade.
"He told me that he always listened
to his guru. When I told him that I
didn't have a guru, he told me to go
to Stanford," Johnson recalled.
The search for a subject
The film students have culled
their ideas from sources as diverse as
the newspaper, an ad in the yellow
pages, a chance meeting and a life
time interest. When Justin Schein
saw an ad for Barbizon Beauty
School in the phone book, he asked
himself, "Who are the people that
go there and why?" After visiting the
school, he met Fawn, who became
the subject of his film, "In Her Own
Image."
Almost every student cited an in
terest in real-life stories as one reason
for their preference for documentary
over feature film. Bonni Cohen looks
for what she calls "jewels of unex
plored lifestyles and people." She
found one in the female auto me
chanic whose "aggressive, confident,

quippy and cynical" style is the subject of her
film, "Marilyn Brown."
Although Brown readily agreed to the film
ing, not all prospective subjects have been as
willing. When Susan Faulkner tried to contact
Val, a 90-year-old peace activist who pedals
through San Jose on his bike, Faulkner said
that "he didn't understand why I wanted to
make a film about him and kept suggesting
other [people] who would be better."
Val finally called back and agreed to the
documentary, which Faulkner titled "Peace
of Mind." The film is about a man "who
didn't come into his own until he was 80 and
considers his life to that point a total failure,"
said Faulkner.
The hectic adventure
The students were divided into crews of
three for the actual shooting of film. The pro
gram emphasizes group effort, Samuelson
explains, because "film is a collaborative
process and those skills must be developed."
Susanna Ortiz, whose film features a carousel

on the Santa Cruz boardwalk, said she be
lieves "each member of the crew brings dif
ferent strengths."
The students used cameras that require
hand-winding every 30 seconds. In addition,
students had to hand-measure the distance be
tween the camera and the subject for every shot.
Students say that the technical challenge
of the equipment takes away a large degree of
spontaneity and requires great patience.
Johnson, who shot her film "Gende Adven
ture" on a hot air balloon, explained the dif
ficulty of trying to capture the right footage
before the balloon filled.
Once airborne, new challenges arose. "It is
incredibly hot and loud up there. We sat on
the bottom of the basket sweating and trying
to change rolls of film," she said. "It should
have been called 'The Hectic Adventure.'"
The final cut
The process of adding sound to film images
requires an even greater degree of precision.
For the project, up to four separate sound

tracks with music, dialogue and background
noises must be mixed into one cohesive track.
Samuelson indicates that sound-editing is the
most difficult step of the final process.
For Sean Anderson, sound and music are
not only technical concerns, but also the sub
ject of his film. "Into the Groove" takes place
in a used record store in Redwood City, with
a soundtrack "mostly from 1930s to 19505,
with jazz, poetry, even some Edward R. Mur
row documentary-style," he said.
The documentary students and their teach
ers have been living (and sometimes sleeping)
in the sub-basement of the Communication
Department, working around the clock dur
ing the last stages of the editing prot ss.
Samuelson and Krawitz said they have s -en
every frame of film shot and viewed every "cut,"
or version, of the documentaries.
Samuelson and Krawitz, who are both
professional documentary makers, act as
mentors in the learning process. Both in
structors create a rigorous structure for the

program; Krawitz said that since
there is so much to learn in two
years the students "don't have time
to breathe." Samuelson admits they
"run the lives of first-year students
like army sergeants."
The discipline on the part of both
students and teachers has produced
outstanding results. The recent
Film Arts Festival in San Franci co
featured works by 14 Stanft rd
graduates.
Rallying the couch potato
Even though not all docum n
tary films deal with political or o
cial issues, students from the 112 o
gram all expressed an interest in
using film to explore what Schein
calls "untapped reality."
The fact that documentary film
often plays only in urban "art film"
theaters creates the problem that
film student Richard Berge de
scribes as "preaching to the choir."
His biggest challenge as a filmmak
er, he says, is finding "a way to rally
the couch potato and get people n
terested in something they ordinar
ily wouldn't be interested in."
The screening of the films will be
on Dec. 15 at 7:30 p.m. The location
has not yet been determined. For
