# Satin sheets and study breaks
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
Pull out the satin sheets. Dead Week's come to
town.
Your parents think it's a time to refamiliarize
yourself with the 200 pages of reading you diligently
completed each week for all of your classes. Your
profs think it's a time to throw in the most excruci
atingly hard-to-grasp concept of the course. Your
dorm thinks it's a time to run around and secretly
give each other those hideous little stuffed reindeer

toys that are uglier than my butt.

Strike three, you're
out Dead Week is a time
for love.
It's the stress, the pres
sure, the feeling that you
might as well do something
constructive even if you can't
read 600 pages by your exam
the next day. Dead Week and
finals are the only times all
quarter when Stanford
transforms from its socially
impotent self into a den of
iniquity.
All those fickle dormmates

who are adamantly against inter-dorm relationships
are suddenly mutated into lust-seeking love bunnies
looking to procrastinate.
Dig out those early-'Bos disco tunes and pop them
in your stereo just in case.... It's time for romance.
Like beer-goggling, excessive studying during Dead
Week and finals provides an inhibition-free time when
you can invade the personal space of your next-door
neighbor for an intimate futon excursion.
You don't have time to think about the implica
tions. You won't remember this after winter break.
All that matters is your little Modern Thought and
Literature hormone-slave. For two short weeks, sweats
don't matter. That extra padding belying your ex
tremely successful high school badminton career
doesn't matter. Bathing doesn't matter.
It's a given that all men go unshaven in a feeble at
tempt to grow the one attractive goatee on the plan
et. Now is the one time when people understand this
and don't laugh at the bald patches that keep you just
one gag away from looking like the next hip-hop phe
nom.
Everyone's vision is blurry from optional problem

Dead Week and finals
are the only times all
quarter when Stanford
transforms from its so
cially impotent self into
a den of iniquity.

sets and minute-print course readers anyway. Stan
dards plunge in a two-week quest to scam with some
one — anyone—so you can tell the people back home
you're "dating."
It doesn't matter where the romance may occur: on
the second floor of Tresidder, in your dorm study
room, the kitchenette... .It's Dead Week. There's no
time to waste dreaming up exotic locales.
Even the sentimental whiners stop complaining for
a fortnight. Suddenly the Coffee House is an OK place
for a date. And a $35 dinner-for-two at Gordon Bier
sch isn't mandatory when you have 200 extra food ser
vice points to unload. There's no pressure here.

Creativity falls to the way
side when you're thinking more
of a two-hour study break than a
trip into the city to hear bad live
music. Finals mode equals a
strict conservation of time. You
barely have enough time to lick
your partner's ear, as you jet out
the door, let alone thumb
through pages of fabulous $$$$-
rated sidewalk cafes in the Guide
to the Good Life.
In fact, you can skip any
type of semi-social activity,
choosing to study with your

vested love interest instead. Practicing your own, per
sonally tailored version of the Primal Scream between
chapters, you can use romance to keep up your study
ing stamina.
And late at night, after your brain is melted, there is
no point in further studying the implications of Marx
in the Third World. You would feel lazy, however,
going to bed before two or three in the morning, los
ing optimal awake-hours. Sleeping is for wimps.
That cute, yet slightly dazed guy down the hall
with the flannel boxers on can be just the one to keep
you company until bedtime. Studying Human
Anatomy a few extra hours -r- after your work for the
day is done — relieves stress and brings you back into
the realm of humanity after a long, lonely quarter at
Stanford.
You're a well-rounded person who can handle the
pressure of finals anyway, so don't worry about the
time commitment.
So, for all of you whose most intense love experi
ence this quarter was hugging that cute guy standing
next to you after each touchdown during Big Game,
it's time-to get to work.
