The last word 0n...

We're getting way too old for parents.
Parents are for burping, bathing and failing
to keep accurate tabs on their liquor cabinet.
Parents don't think the whole thing out.
They think babies, prc-adolescents — teenagers
if you're lucky. They don't plan any further. After
all, they only have about seven minutes.
And then you come to an age, and you
look inside. And you say, "Father."

Berkeley break
10,000 Maniacs at the Berkeley Community
Theatre? No, this isn't post-Big-Game frenzy; it's a
performance of that crazy band's new release, "Our
Time In Eden," on Saturday, Dec. 12, at 8 p.m.
The album features a variety of intense, emo
tional tracks infused with a sense of biblical im
agery, which isn't to say that 10,000 Maniacs are a
replacement for church or Sunday school in the
slightest. They're not. Don't kid yourself.
But if you take advantage of the fact that Dec.
12 is the last day to drop classes, you may find that
spending the evening with 10,000 Maniacs is a lot
more appealing than calling your parents and fer
vently apologizing for not living up to their expec
tations.
"Our Time In Eden" seems a great allegory for
the bliss that shatters into pure angst when you real
ize you signed up for a class that you haven't attend
ed all quarter.

"Yes son."
"I want to make you stop pestering me
about the car registration."
"Mother. I want to ... cook for myselfl"
You reach an age when your parents stop
being omnipotent and turn into people.
Only they don't realize it.
So when you go home, the only thing to
do is grin and bear it. Fighting, though fruit-

Soft screw?
Appreciation for the finer things in life can easi
ly fall to the wayside during Dead Week, leaving you
to degenerate into some primitive, single-celled
sleep-deprived study bug. But before you let this
happen, check out Claes Oldenburg's "Soft Screw in
Waterfall" and the rest of the Anderson Print Col
lection at the Stanford Art Gallery.
The exhibit, which runs through Dec. 13, fea
tures prints, multiples and monotypes from 1968-
1990 by modern artists including David Hockney,
Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg.
The gallery is open Tuesdays through Fridays 10
a.m. through 5 p.m. and weekends 1 -5 p.m.

ful and entertaining during your high school
years, is no longer worth it. Just nod your
head, say "thank you" and completely ignore
them. Otherwise, your younger sister will
take the bank roll in the will.
It's only two weeks. Take it on the chin.
After all, when the Social Security checks start
to dwindle down, you'll get the last laugh.

... parents

goin's on

There are sev
eral good
reasons to
go to church.
You might want to re
pent for the sins of a
non-studious Dead
Week, for example —
but by far the best rea
son to visit the renovat
ed Memorial Church is
the triumvirate of holi
day music concerts that
will be performed from
Dec. 11-13.
Take part in Han-

del's Messiah at the an
nual Handel Messiah sing-along, Sunday,
Dec. 13 at 7:30 p.m. Instrumentalists are in
vited to play along; there will be no soloists;
and singers can try any part they would like.
Singers are asked to bring a score; orchestral
parts will be provided. Tickets are $5 for stu
dents, $10 for everyone else.
Singing and the Christmas season go to
gether like bollards and leg injuries. At 8 p.m.
on Friday and Saturday, the Memorial Church
Choir will perform a (free!) service of lessons
and carols. Take your secret snowflake (or
whatever term is au courant), and partake in
warm, fuzzy feelings. Don't miss Alessandro
Scarlatti's Magnificat from the "Vespers of
Saint Cecilia."
Listen to a variety of European Christ
mas songs from Germany, Italy and Holland,
as well as Baroque organ works at 2:30 p.m.
on Sunday, Dec. 13, performed by organist
Robert Bates and tenor Gregory Wait. It's
free, and early enough in the day for anyone
who might be frightened to go out after dark.
Music from Columbus' time
On Dec. 9 at 8 p.m., the Stanford Early
Music Singers will perform Franco-Flemish,
Italian and Spanish music composed around
the time of Columbus' initial voyage to
North America.
Directed by William Mahrt, the pro
gram features music by familiar composers
as well as rarely heard Spanish composers
like Rivaflecha and Encina — no relation to
the gym. The free public concert is spon
sored by the Department of Music, and will
take place in Memorial Church.
