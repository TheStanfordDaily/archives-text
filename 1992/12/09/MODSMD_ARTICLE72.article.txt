# A
						little piece of Christmas hell
## 
### 
I used to love this whole Christ
mas thing. I'd wake my parents
up at 6 a.m., rifle through the
stocking and pull out the"For col
lege" savings bonds Santa so pre
sciently knew I, as a 12-year-old, so
badly wanted.
From Dec. 16 until New Year's
Eve, I was stuck in front of the tele
vision. And each and every one of
those Christmas specials shaped
my morality more than any two-bit
elementary school teacher spewing
platitudes like "stop eating that
dead bird" ever would.
I learned a respect for people and
animals with body parts that occa
sionally light up. I gained an un
healthy empathy for crystallized
rain shaped like an overweight
white man. And worst of all, I had
this almost Catholic guilt about not
having considered a college major
when this little self-actualizing elf
kid kept telling everyone he wanted
to be a dentist.
My father thought this was all
very odd. Mostly because my fami
ly is Jewish.
Conceptually, we should have
been no more excited about
Christ's birth than Olivia Newton
John's. In fact, less so. Jesus never
wore rollerskates. Except in An
drew Lloyd Webber productions.
So we called our Christmas tree
a (C)han(n)uk(k)a(h) bush and
came up with a complex rational
ization for the existence of this
Santa guy. I think it had something
to do with stock options and mall
sales, but I'm not sure.
But now I hate Christmas. I hate
the mistletoe. The holly. The poin
settias. In fact, I'm confused by this
entire holy host of greenery which
somehow hibernates for the rest of
the year.
I used to hate it because it made
everyone fake. It made junior high
girls make noise when they walked.
More noise than usual.
It made Dan Fielding be nice to
small, unattractive children at the
end of the show. It made my moth
er buy gifts for public servants she
claimed to have never met. It made
my father stop drinking.
After a while I got over the bit
terness of my immature cultural
jealousy, and I moved on to a more
mature bitterness. It happened
about the time I learned about phi
losophy, etymologies and the way
to use the little magnifying glass on
the OED.
I hate Jesus Christ.
I hate his long scraggly hair. I hate
the way he washed everybody's feet,
except for those advanced lepers,
and that wasn't his fault. I hate that
he can't drink water from his hands.
Once I thought Christians were
harmless, if misguided, people.
They sang funny songs, ate cheap

wafers and intermittently plun
dered large parts of the Middle
East. No harm, no foul.
But now I realize there is some
thing much more insidious at stake.
God-believers, no matter how
benevolent and cheek-turning they
might seem, believe in their so
called souls that people who dis
agree with them will burn in eternal
pain, or at least have long conversa
tions with Maury Povich (circle
seven, bolgia sue). This is no more
benevolent than the whole Gerald
Ford pardon thing.
Every day during the yuletide,
I'm bombarded with Christian
symbols. City streets are decorated
with giant pipe cleaners. Bald, gay,
Jewish mayors of New York pretend
to light a Christmas tree so big only
Ronald Reagan would let someone
chop it down. Neil Diamond puts
out a Christmas album â€” and peo
ple buy it.
It's only worse when they try to
cover it up with those pathetic
"Seasons Greetings" messages. It's
one thing to subject someone to
your metaphysics. It's another to be
wordy about it.
So, hey, Palo Alto, I don't want
your one-hour free parking. I don't
want giant sales on power tools. I
don't want to sit on Santa's lap. Un
less it would score me points with
those useless, distractingly buxom
"elves." Like a bowl full of jelly.
I don't want people to offer me
egg nog and then apologize. I don't
want them to offer me other flavors
of nog either.
Let's face it, Christ was just a guy
everyone liked because he died
when he was young. And even 16-
year-old girls eventually take down
their James Dean posters.
I'm sorry my parents had to put
up those stockings. And I'm sorry
white trash has to spend their entire
year putting money into savings ac
counts with bad interest rates, just so
they can pretend to be a part of the
American Dream for one day a year.
Candy canes are the opiate of the
masses. Thank God for Kwanzaa.

Joel Stein reminds you to harass little
kids who come from houses without
chimneys. His column will continue to
appear here weekly because the media
is run by liberal Jews.
