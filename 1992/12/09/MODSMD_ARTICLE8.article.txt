# Losing Z's to get A's? Sacrificing sleep just isn't smart
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
It's way past your bedtime.
In the midst of a busy Dead-
Week schedule of papers, procras
tination and primal screams, sleep
is often leil by the wayside. As fi
nals draw inexorably closer, many
busy Stanford students prefer to
spend late night hours chasing A's
instead of catching Z's, assuming
that they can always catch up on
their snoozing over winter break.
But those who think this way
may be asleep at the wheel, doc
tors warn. Students need just as
much sleep as everyone else, they
say; and you probably need more
sleep than you think.
"All individuals need a certain
amount of sleep each day to not
get a sleep debt," said Psychiatry
Prof. William Dement. A sleep
debt is much like a running tab of
tiredness that marks how long
you've gone without sleep. As soon
as you wake up in the morning,
Dement said, your sleep debt
starts accruing, and the only way
to get rid of that debt is by sleeping
it off.
Students who neglect their
sleep build up too great a debt, and
risk all the consequences that
come with too little sleep.
"It can make you forgetful, it

can make you irritable," said De
ment, who heads the Medical Cen
ter's Sleep Disorders Clinic and
will teach the undergraduate
"Sleep and Dreams" class winter
quarter. Other effects can include
nausea, loss of appetite, a general
achy feeling and a decrease in abil
ity to operate motor vehicles.
"There's a point at which sleep
debt gets so large it can seriously
affect your mental functions," De
ment said.
While there is no magic level of
sleep debt that can safely be in
curred, Dement said many people
seem to start having problems
when they accrue a 20-hour debt:
In other words, 20 hours after you
woke up from your last full rest.
And the effects of sleep debt don't
register until they hit this thresh
old point; then they all come at
once in a straw-that-broke-the
camel's-back manner.

"I literally woke up to the image
of myself in a mirror, soaking wet,
with a towel wrapped around my
head," said Hope. Somehow, she
