# Losing Z's to get A's? Sacrificing sleep just isn't smart
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
It's way past your bedtime.
In the midst of a busy Dead-
Week schedule of papers, procras
tination and primal screams, sleep
is often leil by the wayside. As fi
nals draw inexorably closer, many
busy Stanford students prefer to
spend late night hours chasing A's
instead of catching Z's, assuming
that they can always catch up on
their snoozing over winter break.
But those who think this way
may be asleep at the wheel, doc
tors warn. Students need just as
much sleep as everyone else, they
say; and you probably need more
sleep than you think.
"All individuals need a certain
amount of sleep each day to not
get a sleep debt," said Psychiatry
Prof. William Dement. A sleep
debt is much like a running tab of
tiredness that marks how long
you've gone without sleep. As soon
as you wake up in the morning,
Dement said, your sleep debt
starts accruing, and the only way
to get rid of that debt is by sleeping
it off.
Students who neglect their
sleep build up too great a debt, and
risk all the consequences that
come with too little sleep.
"It can make you forgetful, it

can make you irritable," said De
ment, who heads the Medical Cen
ter's Sleep Disorders Clinic and
will teach the undergraduate
"Sleep and Dreams" class winter
quarter. Other effects can include
nausea, loss of appetite, a general
achy feeling and a decrease in abil
ity to operate motor vehicles.
"There's a point at which sleep
debt gets so large it can seriously
affect your mental functions," De
ment said.
While there is no magic level of
sleep debt that can safely be in
curred, Dement said many people
seem to start having problems
when they accrue a 20-hour debt:
In other words, 20 hours after you
woke up from your last full rest.
And the effects of sleep debt don't
register until they hit this thresh
old point; then they all come at
once in a straw-that-broke-the
camel's-back manner.
Senior Miranda Hope knows
the bizarre dangers of sleep loss.
As a high-school student, she
spent two days with little sleep,
until tired and stressed, she final
ly dozed off.
"I literally woke up to the image
of myself in a mirror, soaking wet,
with a towel wrapped around my
head," said Hope. Somehow, she

had managed to take a shower —
including shampooing and condi
tioning her hair — without ever
fully waking up.
Dement said the amount of
sleep needed each day varies
somewhat from individual to indi
vidual, but a good rule of thumb is
that Stanford undergraduates
aren't getting enough sleep. And
while there is not a specific num
ber of hours of sleep needed per
night. Dement said eight hours —
a number that haunts Stanford
undergrads — is about average.
The average Stanford student
gets "probably less than eight
hours of sleep" nightly, said John
Dorman, staff physician at Cowell
Student Health Center.
While he admitted "not every
body needs eight hours," many
people do, and Dorman said he
has observed that people need less
sleep as they grow older — mean
ing younger college students "are
probably getting less sleep at a
time when they need more."

Indeed, in working with the
Sleep Disorders clinic, Dement
said "our first study was lonj a
group of Stanford undergradu
ates, and they all looked like they
had narcolepsy."
And for those of you who think
you can get by on four hours a
night, chances are you're wrong.
Such cases, Dement said, are
very, very rare.
But for those who still haven't
studied for tomorrow morning's
final at 11 p.m. tonight, Dement
offered some advice more applica
ble to Stanford student life: If
your final will call for you to exer
cise your mind, it's probably bet
ter for you to be fully rested for
the test. If, however, the test will
require recall of arcane facts
you've yet to absorb, it may be
better to study a few hours more
and sleep a few hours less.
And if you think those caffeine
pills will help you, they're only a
temporary fix. Dement said any
systemic excitement — like joy,
pain or coffee — will hold off the
symptoms of sleepiness, but only
for a short time. And while the
caffeine is working its way out of
your system, your sleep debt is

still growing.
The caffeine fix didn't work for
sophomore April Minor, who had
packed all her clothes in a suit
case, preparing for a trip home
over Christmas break.
"I had the plan to stay up all
night, and I took some Vivarin,"
she said. "I was studying in my
suitcase, and I fell asleep in my
suitcase, and I dreamt that I was
sleeping in Jell-O."
Beyond weird dreams, sleep
loss can actually be unsafe.
Dement said too great a sleep debt
can cause people to become dan
gerous behind the wheel of a car,
and Dorman said the high num
ber of bike accidents seen on cam
pus might be partly due to stu
dent sleepiness.
Dement's advice to students
contemplating all-nighters? Hold
off.
"It's better to respect sleep
more, to get rid of the attitude
that 'I can do all-nighters,'
because sooner or later a calamity
will happen," he said.
"Liz," a freshman who says her
sleeping habits are "irregular,"
has had a few experiences which
suggest that she could use a few

hours more sleep per night.
"One time, I hadn't slept in
days . . . and the world kept
changing colors," she said.
A more nightmarish event hap
pened in one of her math classes
here, after a sleepless night: "I
kept falling asleep, and every time
I would wake up the boards would
move," she said. "I went to sleep
in linear algebra and I woke up in
multivariable calculus."
Indeed, falling asleep in class is
more than an idle threat when
students haven't gotten enough
sleep. Dement says one danger of
getting too little sleep before a
final is sleeping through your
alarm the next morning and miss
ing the test, or even falling asleep
while taking the exam.
In fact, Dement said a student
of his had recently asked him to
intervene with another professor,
because the pupil had fallen
asleep in an exam, and ended up
flunking the class. Dement
refused.
But a simple lack of nap time is
not the only sleep-related problem
facing Stanford students. Accord
ing to Dement, the most powerful
force regulating periods of alert

ness and drowsiness throughout
the day is the body's biological
clock. This clock has two built-in
periods of alertness — one in the
morning, and another, stronger,
period in the late afternoon,
Dement said.
What may happen to many
Stanford students who consis
tently stay up late — say, for
example, until 2 a.m. every night
for a couple weeks — is a shift in
their biological clocks.
"Most students are what we
call phase delayed," Dement said.
"The clock is running late."
For example, if a standard bio
logical clock for someone going to
sleep at midnight would kick in
with its first alert period at 9 a.m.,
the shifted clock for someone
going to sleep at 2 a.m. would give
their morning jolt at 11 a.m. —
not much help for those getting
up for a 10 a.m. class.
"Their clock is probably
delayed, so their mornings will be
even more difficult," he said.
This phase delay can be espe
cially harsh on students planning
to go to the Eastern United States
over winter break, where a three
hour time difference will exacer

bate the body clock's lateness. In
other words, students who found
themselves staying up until 2 a.m.
in Palo Alto won't get sleepy until
5 a.m. in Bloomington, Indiana.
Dement suggested that those
students travelling to the East
Coast could seize the opportunity
to readjust their body clocks to a
more standard schedule while at
home. That way, when the stu
dents come back next quarter, he
said they will start getting sleepy
in the evenings, which is good for
students' health, if not their
grades and their social lives.
In the meantime, those stu
dents with finals coming on
should remember that you need
more sleep than you're getting —
a lot more.
If that doesn't satisfy you, you
can always look to Dement's most
lenient statement on all-nighters:
If you're fully rested, with no sleep
debt, and you simply want to cram
in facts that you am regurgitate
for the test and forget immediate
ly afterwards, an all-nighter might
work, for some people.
But that's not really what you
want from a Stanford education,
is it?

final at 11 p.m. tonight, Dement
offered some advice more applica
ble to Stanford student life: If
your final will call for you to exer
cise your mind, it's probably bet
ter for you to be fully rested for
the test. If, however, the test will
require recall of arcane facts
you've yet to absorb, it may be
better to study a few hours more
and sleep a few hours less.
And if you think those caffeine
pills will help you, they're only a
temporary fix. Dement said any
systemic excitement — like joy,
pain or coffee — will hold off the
symptoms of sleepiness, but only
for a short time. And while the
caffeine is working its way out of
your system, your sleep debt is

still growing.
The caffeine fix didn't work for
sophomore April Minor, who had
packed all her clothes in a suit
case, preparing for a trip home
over Christmas break.
"I had the plan to stay up all
night, and I took some Vivarin,"
she said. "I was studying in my
suitcase, and I fell asleep in my
suitcase, and I dreamt that I was
sleeping in Jell-O."
Beyond weird dreams, sleep
loss can actually be unsafe.
Dement said too great a sleep debt
can cause people to become dan
gerous behind the wheel of a car,
and Dorman said the high num
ber of bike accidents seen on cam
pus might be partly due to stu
dent sleepiness.
Dement's advice to students
contemplating all-nighters? Hold
off.
"It's better to respect sleep
more, to get rid of the attitude
that 'I can do all-nighters,'
because sooner or later a calamity
will happen," he said.
"Liz," a freshman who says her
sleeping habits are "irregular,"
has had a few experiences which
suggest that she could use a few

hours more sleep per night.
"One time, I hadn't slept in
days . . . and the world kept
changing colors," she said.
A more nightmarish event hap
pened in one of her math classes
here, after a sleepless night: "I
kept falling asleep, and every time
I would wake up the boards would
move," she said. "I went to sleep
in linear algebra and I woke up in
multivariable calculus."
Indeed, falling asleep in class is
more than an idle threat when
students haven't gotten enough
sleep. Dement says one danger of
getting too little sleep before a
final is sleeping through your
alarm the next morning and miss
ing the test, or even falling asleep
while taking the exam.
In fact, Dement said a student
of his had recently asked him to
intervene with another professor,
because the pupil had fallen
asleep in an exam, and ended up
flunking the class. Dement
refused.
But a simple lack of nap time is
not the only sleep-related problem
facing Stanford students. Accord
ing to Dement, the most powerful
force regulating periods of alert

ness and drowsiness throughout
the day is the body's biological
clock. This clock has two built-in
periods of alertness — one in the
morning, and another, stronger,
period in the late afternoon,
Dement said.
What may happen to many
Stanford students who consis
tently stay up late — say, for
example, until 2 a.m. every night
for a couple weeks — is a shift in
their biological clocks.
"Most students are what we
call phase delayed," Dement said.
"The clock is running late."
For example, if a standard bio
logical clock for someone going to
sleep at midnight would kick in
with its first alert period at 9 a.m.,
the shifted clock for someone
going to sleep at 2 a.m. would give
their morning jolt at 11 a.m. —
not much help for those getting
up for a 10 a.m. class.
"Their clock is probably
delayed, so their mornings will be
even more difficult," he said.
This phase delay can be espe
cially harsh on students planning
to go to the Eastern United States
over winter break, where a three
hour time difference will exacer

bate the body clock's lateness. In
other words, students who found
themselves staying up until 2 a.m.
in Palo Alto won't get sleepy until
5 a.m. in Bloomington, Indiana.
Dement suggested that those
students travelling to the East
Coast could seize the opportunity
to readjust their body clocks to a
more standard schedule while at
home. That way, when the stu
dents come back next quarter, he
said they will start getting sleepy
in the evenings, which is good for
students' health, if not their
grades and their social lives.
In the meantime, those stu
dents with finals coming on
should remember that you need
more sleep than you're getting —
a lot more.
If that doesn't satisfy you, you
can always look to Dement's most
lenient statement on all-nighters:
If you're fully rested, with no sleep
debt, and you simply want to cram
in facts that you am regurgitate
for the test and forget immediate
ly afterwards, an all-nighter might
work, for some people.
But that's not really what you
want from a Stanford education,
is it?
It's way past your bedtime.
In the midst of a busy Dead-
Week schedule of papers, procras
tination and primal screams, sleep
is often leil by the wayside. As fi
nals draw inexorably closer, many
busy Stanford students prefer to
spend late night hours chasing A's
instead of catching Z's, assuming
that they can always catch up on
their snoozing over winter break.
But those who think this way
may be asleep at the wheel, doc
tors warn. Students need just as
much sleep as everyone else, they
say; and you probably need more
sleep than you think.
"All individuals need a certain
amount of sleep each day to not
get a sleep debt," said Psychiatry
Prof. William Dement. A sleep
debt is much like a running tab of
tiredness that marks how long
you've gone without sleep. As soon
as you wake up in the morning,
Dement said, your sleep debt
starts accruing, and the only way
to get rid of that debt is by sleeping
it off.
Students who neglect their
sleep build up too great a debt, and
risk all the consequences that
come with too little sleep.
"It can make you forgetful, it

can make you irritable," said De
ment, who heads the Medical Cen
ter's Sleep Disorders Clinic and
will teach the undergraduate
"Sleep and Dreams" class winter
quarter. Other effects can include
nausea, loss of appetite, a general
achy feeling and a decrease in abil
ity to operate motor vehicles.
"There's a point at which sleep
debt gets so large it can seriously
affect your mental functions," De
ment said.
While there is no magic level of
sleep debt that can safely be in
curred, Dement said many people
seem to start having problems
when they accrue a 20-hour debt:
In other words, 20 hours after you
woke up from your last full rest.
And the effects of sleep debt don't
register until they hit this thresh
old point; then they all come at
once in a straw-that-broke-the
camel's-back manner.
Senior Miranda Hope knows
the bizarre dangers of sleep loss.
As a high-school student, she
spent two days with little sleep,
until tired and stressed, she final
ly dozed off.
"I literally woke up to the image
of myself in a mirror, soaking wet,
with a towel wrapped around my
head," said Hope. Somehow, she

had managed to take a shower —
including shampooing and condi
tioning her hair — without ever
fully waking up.
Dement said the amount of
sleep needed each day varies
somewhat from individual to indi
vidual, but a good rule of thumb is
that Stanford undergraduates
aren't getting enough sleep. And
while there is not a specific num
ber of hours of sleep needed per
night. Dement said eight hours —
a number that haunts Stanford
undergrads — is about average.
The average Stanford student
gets "probably less than eight
hours of sleep" nightly, said John
Dorman, staff physician at Cowell
Student Health Center.
While he admitted "not every
body needs eight hours," many
people do, and Dorman said he
has observed that people need less
sleep as they grow older — mean
ing younger college students "are
probably getting less sleep at a
time when they need more."

Indeed, in working with the
Sleep Disorders clinic, Dement
said "our first study was lonj a
group of Stanford undergradu
ates, and they all looked like they
had narcolepsy."
And for those of you who think
you can get by on four hours a
night, chances are you're wrong.
Such cases, Dement said, are
very, very rare.
But for those who still haven't
studied for tomorrow morning's
final at 11 p.m. tonight, Dement
offered some advice more applica

delayed, so their mornings will be
even more difficult," he said.
This phase delay can be espe
cially harsh on students planning
to go to the Eastern United States
over winter break, where a three
hour time difference will exacer

bate the body clock's lateness. In
other words, students who found
themselves staying up until 2 a.m.
in Palo Alto won't get sleepy until
5 a.m. in Bloomington, Indiana.
Dement suggested that those
students travelling to the East
Coast could seize the opportunity
to readjust their body clocks to a
more standard schedule while at
home. That way, when the stu
dents come back next quarter, he
said they will start getting sleepy
in the evenings, which is good for
students' health, if not their
grades and their social lives.
In the meantime, those stu
dents with finals coming on
should remember that you need
more sleep than you're getting —
a lot more.
If that doesn't satisfy you, you
can always look to Dement's most
lenient statement on all-nighters:
If you're fully rested, with no sleep
debt, and you simply want to cram
in facts that you am regurgitate
for the test and forget immediate
ly afterwards, an all-nighter might
work, for some people.
But that's not really what you
want from a Stanford education,
is it?
It's way past your bedtime.
In the midst of a busy Dead-
Week schedule of papers, procras
tination and primal screams, sleep
is often leil by the wayside. As fi
nals draw inexorably closer, many
busy Stanford students prefer to
spend late night hours chasing A's
instead of catching Z's, assuming
that they can always catch up on
their snoozing over winter break.
But those who think this way
may be asleep at the wheel, doc
tors warn. Students need just as
much sleep as everyone else, they
say; and you probably need more
sleep than you think.
"All individuals need a certain
amount of sleep each day to not
get a sleep debt," said Psychiatry
Prof. William Dement. A sleep
debt is much like a running tab of
tiredness that marks how long
you've gone without sleep. As soon
as you wake up in the morning,
Dement said, your sleep debt
starts accruing, and the only way
to get rid of that debt is by sleeping
it off.
Students who neglect their
sleep build up too great a debt, and
risk all the consequences that
come with too little sleep.
"It can make you forgetful, it

can make you irritable," said De
ment, who heads the Medical Cen
ter's Sleep Disorders Clinic and
will teach the undergraduate
"Sleep and Dreams" class winter
quarter. Other effects can include
nausea, loss of appetite, a general
achy feeling and a decrease in abil
ity to operate motor vehicles.
"There's a point at which sleep
debt gets so large it can seriously
affect your mental functions," De
ment said.
While there is no magic level of
sleep debt that can safely be in
curred, Dement said many people
seem to start having problems
when they accrue a 20-hour debt:
In other words, 20 hours after you
woke up from your last full rest.
And the effects of sleep debt don't
register until they hit this thresh
old point; then they all come at
once in a straw-that-broke-the
camel's-back manner.
Senior Miranda Hope knows
the bizarre dangers of sleep loss.
As a high-school student, she
spent two days with little sleep,
until tired and stressed, she final
ly dozed off.
"I literally woke up to the image
of myself in a mirror, soaking wet,
with a towel wrapped around my
head," said Hope. Somehow, she

had managed to take a shower —
including shampooing and condi
tioning her hair — without ever
fully waking up.
Dement said the amount of
sleep needed each day varies
somewhat from individual to indi
vidual, but a good rule of thumb is
that Stanford undergraduates
aren't getting enough sleep. And
while there is not a specific num
ber of hours of sleep needed per
night. Dement said eight hours —
a number that haunts Stanford
undergrads — is about average.
The average Stanford student
gets "probably less than eight
hours of sleep" nightly, said John
Dorman, staff physician at Cowell
Student Health Center.
While he admitted "not every
body needs eight hours," many
people do, and Dorman said he
has observed that people need less
sleep as they grow older — mean
ing younger college students "are
probably getting less sleep at a
time when they need more."

Indeed, in working with the
Sleep Disorders clinic, Dement
said "our first study was lonj a
group of Stanford undergradu
ates, and they all looked like they
had narcolepsy."
And for those of you who think
you can get by on four hours a
night, chances are you're wrong.
Such cases, Dement said, are
very, very rare.
But for those who still haven't
studied for tomorrow morning's
final at 11 p.m. tonight, Dement
offered some advice more applica
ble to Stanford student life: If
your final will call for you to exer
cise your mind, it's probably bet
ter for you to be fully rested for
the test. If, however, the test will
require recall of arcane facts
you've yet to absorb, it may be
better to study a few hours more
and sleep a few hours less.
And if you think those caffeine
pills will help you, they're only a
temporary fix. Dement said any
systemic excitement — like joy,
pain or coffee — will hold off the
symptoms of sleepiness, but only
for a short time. And while the
caffeine is working its way out of
your system, your sleep debt is

still growing.
The caffeine fix didn't work for
sophomore April Minor, who had
packed all her clothes in a suit
case, preparing for a trip home
over Christmas break.
"I had the plan to stay up all
night, and I took some Vivarin,"
she said. "I was studying in my
suitcase, and I fell asleep in my
suitcase, and I dreamt that I was
sleeping in Jell-O."
Beyond weird dreams, sleep
loss can actually be unsafe.
Dement said too great a sleep debt
can cause people to become dan
gerous behind the wheel of a car,
and Dorman said the high num
ber of bike accidents seen on cam
pus might be partly due to stu
dent sleepiness.
Dement's advice to students
contemplating all-nighters? Hold
off.
"It's better to respect sleep
more, to get rid of the attitude
that 'I can do all-nighters,'
because sooner or later a calamity
will happen," he said.
"Liz," a freshman who says her
sleeping habits are "irregular,"
has had a few experiences which
suggest that she could use a few

hours more sleep per night.
"One time, I hadn't slept in
days . . . and the world kept
changing colors," she said.
A more nightmarish event hap
pened in one of her math classes
here, after a sleepless night: "I
kept falling asleep, and every time
I would wake up the boards would
move," she said. "I went to sleep
in linear algebra and I woke up in
multivariable calculus."
Indeed, falling asleep in class is
more than an idle threat when
students haven't gotten enough
sleep. Dement says one danger of
getting too little sleep before a
final is sleeping through your
alarm the next morning and miss
ing the test, or even falling asleep
while taking the exam.
In fact, Dement said a student
of his had recently asked him to
intervene with another professor,
because the pupil had fallen
asleep in an exam, and ended up
flunking the class. Dement
refused.
But a simple lack of nap time is
not the only sleep-related problem
facing Stanford students. Accord
ing to Dement, the most powerful
force regulating periods of alert

ness and drowsiness throughout
the day is the body's biological
clock. This clock has two built-in
periods of alertness — one in the
morning, and another, stronger,
period in the late afternoon,
Dement said.
What may happen to many
Stanford students who consis
tently stay up late — say, for
example, until 2 a.m. every night
for a couple weeks — is a shift in
their biological clocks.
"Most students are what we
call phase delayed," Dement said.
"The clock is running late."
For example, if a standard bio
logical clock for someone going to
sleep at midnight would kick in
with its first alert period at 9 a.m.,
the shifted clock for someone
going to sleep at 2 a.m. would give
their morning jolt at 11 a.m. —
not much help for those getting
up for a 10 a.m. class.
"Their clock is probably
delayed, so their mornings will be
even more difficult," he said.
This phase delay can be espe
cially harsh on students planning
to go to the Eastern United States
over winter break, where a three
hour time difference will exacer

bate the body clock's lateness. In
other words, students who found
themselves staying up until 2 a.m.
in Palo Alto won't get sleepy until
5 a.m. in Bloomington, Indiana.
Dement suggested that those
students travelling to the East
Coast could seize the opportunity
to readjust their body clocks to a
more standard schedule while at
home. That way, when the stu
dents come back next quarter, he
said they will start getting sleepy
in the evenings, which is good for
students' health, if not their
grades and their social lives.
In the meantime, those stu
dents with finals coming on
should remember that you need
more sleep than you're getting —
a lot more.
If that doesn't satisfy you, you
can always look to Dement's most
lenient statement on all-nighters:
If you're fully rested, with no sleep
debt, and you simply want to cram
in facts that you am regurgitate
for the test and forget immediate

But that's not really what you
want from a Stanford education,
is it?
