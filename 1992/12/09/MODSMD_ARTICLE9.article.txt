# 'I can't wait to start working': Eshoo anxious to start term
## 
### David Bianco Senior staff writer 
WASHINGTON — For her first public
appearance as a Congresswoman-elect,
Anna Eshoo could have chosen to speak
before a civic or environmental group in
her district. She could have spoken to
Stanford's Board of Trustees or at a pres
tigious alumni function.
But instead she chose dinner and a
chat with approximately 20 Stanford-in-
Washington undergraduates Sunday
night.
Eshoo, D-Stanford, is the first Demo
crat to represent Stanford in Congress in
55 years. She spoke to students at Stan
ford in Washington's Bass Center about
her hope for change, her priorities as a
member of Congress, and her opinions
about the role Stanford can play in
national life.
"I can't wait to start working," said
the Congresswoman-elect, who had just
spent a week in orientation meetings on
Capitol Hill. "I really want to get into
substance."
Eshoo was invited to the program by
junior Amy Marx, a public policy and eco
nomics mqjor who worked on Eshoo's pri
mary campaign. Marx, who recalled walk
ing precincts with Eshoo in May, said
coming to Stanford in Washington was a
natural for the Congresswoman-elect.
"She's always been really eager to
meet students," Marx said. "She was so
excited to come over and meet the stu
dents and learn about the program."
Eshoo spent two hours answering

questions from students and hearing
about their experiences as interns in
agencies and non-profit organizations in
the nation's capitol.
Eshoo said she felt privileged to repre
sent Congress in what she calls "the
Stanford University district." She
described hearing other members of
Congress say that they represent the

14th District in Michigan or Florida, and
then have to explain where that is.
When she says she's from the Califor
nia 14th — the "Stanford University dis
trict — everyone in the entire Congress
knows what this district is, where it is, and
who it is," she said. "Right now, it's me.
"I look forward to working and weav
ing a partnership with Stanford Univer

sity and sharing its academics and schol
arly minds with other members," she
said. "I think that the opportunities are
endless."
Stanford, which before 1992 had never
been represented by a woman on Capitol
Hill, will soon be represented by three —
Eshoo as well as Senator-elect Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., and Stanford alumna
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
Eshoo stressed the importance of hav
ing both men's and women's voices in
government. Women "view things differ
ently," she said.
As an example, she described hearing
a man at a Rotary Club event she attend
ed shout at her, "You think you're better
because you're a woman?"
"Of course I'm not better," Eshoo
recalled replying. "But I am different."
She said this year was unique in that
women's concerns were regularly raised
in races around the country.
"This whole year of campaigning, dis
trict by district around the country we all
heard — the men as well as the women —
the issues women have carried for
decades."
Eshoo, who turns 50 this week, served
on the San Mateo County Board of Super
visors for 10 years before being elected to
Congress. In response to a student ques
tion about her election experiences she
said, "Running for Congress is not for the
faint of heart. It is certainly the most dif
ficult thing I have done in my life."
One issue Eshoo repeatedly raised in
her campaign against fellow San Mateo
Country Supervisor Tom Huening was

the environment. She told students she
expected Vice President-elect Gore to
show "great leadership on key issues to
our district," including technology and
the environment.
"He will redefine how environmental
ism is shaped and how sound environ
mental policies and sound economic poli
cies do not have to be in conflict with each
other," she said.
One student asked Eshoo about her
prospects for committee assignments.
She described her efforts to place herself
on choice committees, which will proba
bly be announced today.
Eshoo said committees she hoped to be
appointed to include the Ways and Means
Committee, which writes tax laws that
are important to Silicon Valley, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee, and the Sci
ence and Technology Committee, on
which outgoing Congressman and Law
Prof. Tom Campbell, R-Stanford, cur
rently serves.
She spoke highly of Campbell, saying
that his staff has been helpful during the
transition and that she looks forward to
meeting with him soon. The two ran
against each other for the 14th Congres
sional District seat in 1988, and Camp
bell won in a close race.
Eshoo also said she was looking for
ward to next quarter, when former Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy will be
the resident fellow and faculty membeT
at Stanford in Washington. She indicated
she was definitely interested in making
regular visits to the program a part of her
service in Washington.

her district. She could have spoken to
Stanford's Board of Trustees or at a pres
tigious alumni function.
But instead she chose dinner and a
chat with approximately 20 Stanford-in-
Washington undergraduates Sunday
night.
Eshoo, D-Stanford, is the first Demo
crat to represent Stanford in Congress in
55 years. She spoke to students at Stan
ford in Washington's Bass Center about
her hope for change, her priorities as a
member of Congress, and her opinions
about the role Stanford can play in
national life.
"I can't wait to start working," said
the Congresswoman-elect, who had just
spent a week in orientation meetings on
Capitol Hill. "I really want to get into
substance."
Eshoo was invited to the program by
junior Amy Marx, a public policy and eco
nomics mqjor who worked on Eshoo's pri
mary campaign. Marx, who recalled walk
ing precincts with Eshoo in May, said
coming to Stanford in Washington was a
natural for the Congresswoman-elect.
"She's always been really eager to
meet students," Marx said. "She was so
excited to come over and meet the stu
dents and learn about the program."
Eshoo spent two hours answering

questions from students and hearing
about their experiences as interns in
agencies and non-profit organizations in
the nation's capitol.
Eshoo said she felt privileged to repre
sent Congress in what she calls "the
Stanford University district." She
described hearing other members of
Congress say that they represent the

14th District in Michigan or Florida, and
then have to explain where that is.
When she says she's from the Califor
nia 14th — the "Stanford University dis
trict — everyone in the entire Congress
knows what this district is, where it is, and
who it is," she said. "Right now, it's me.
"I look forward to working and weav
ing a partnership with Stanford Univer

sity and sharing its academics and schol
arly minds with other members," she
said. "I think that the opportunities are
endless."
Stanford, which before 1992 had never
been represented by a woman on Capitol
Hill, will soon be represented by three —
Eshoo as well as Senator-elect Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif., and Stanford alumna
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
Eshoo stressed the importance of hav
ing both men's and women's voices in
government. Women "view things differ
ently," she said.
As an example, she described hearing
a man at a Rotary Club event she attend
ed shout at her, "You think you're better
because you're a woman?"
"Of course I'm not better," Eshoo
recalled replying. "But I am different."
She said this year was unique in that
women's concerns were regularly raised
in races around the country.
"This whole year of campaigning, dis
trict by district around the country we all
heard — the men as well as the women —
the issues women have carried for
decades."
Eshoo, who turns 50 this week, served
on the San Mateo County Board of Super
visors for 10 years before being elected to
Congress. In response to a student ques
tion about her election experiences she
said, "Running for Congress is not for the
faint of heart. It is certainly the most dif
ficult thing I have done in my life."
One issue Eshoo repeatedly raised in
her campaign against fellow San Mateo
Country Supervisor Tom Huening was

the environment. She told students she
expected Vice President-elect Gore to
show "great leadership on key issues to
our district," including technology and
the environment.
"He will redefine how environmental
ism is shaped and how sound environ
mental policies and sound economic poli
cies do not have to be in conflict with each
other," she said.
One student asked Eshoo about her
prospects for committee assignments.
She described her efforts to place herself
on choice committees, which will proba
bly be announced today.
Eshoo said committees she hoped to be
appointed to include the Ways and Means
Committee, which writes tax laws that
are important to Silicon Valley, the Edu
cation and Labor Committee, and the Sci
ence and Technology Committee, on
which outgoing Congressman and Law
Prof. Tom Campbell, R-Stanford, cur
rently serves.
She spoke highly of Campbell, saying
that his staff has been helpful during the
transition and that she looks forward to
meeting with him soon. The two ran
against each other for the 14th Congres
sional District seat in 1988, and Camp
bell won in a close race.
Eshoo also said she was looking for
ward to next quarter, when former Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy will be
the resident fellow and faculty membeT
at Stanford in Washington. She indicated
she was definitely interested in making
regular visits to the program a part of her
service in Washington.
