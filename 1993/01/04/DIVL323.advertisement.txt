Will your company grow as fast as you do?
Almost every company's recruiting ad promises you rapid growth. But before
making any decisions, ask them how fast they're growing. After all, you're going to have
trouble moving up if your company isn't.
Over the last five years, while economic conditions have stalled many organiza
tions, Andersen Consulting grew on the average of
20% per year.
Compare that figure to any other firm you're con
sidering. It could be the difference between getting
ahead. And banging your head.
