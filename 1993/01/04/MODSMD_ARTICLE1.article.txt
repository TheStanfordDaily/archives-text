FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -
The Stanford Cardinal football
team concluded a remarkable 1992
season on New Year's Day 1993
with a resounding 24-3 Block
buster Bowl triumph over the Penn
State Nittany Lions in Joe Robbie
Stadium.
The Cardinal, employing a
strong defensive effort and a bal
anced offensive attack, raised its
record to 10-3, earning double fig
ures in victories for the first time
since 1940. By virtue of its out
standing performance and key
losses by teams previously ranked
ahead of it, Stanford vaulted from
No. 13 to No. 9 in both final major
national polls, marking the
squad's highest finish since the
Rose Bowl-winning team of 1971
finished eighth.
"It's just a great win for us,"
said Cardinal head coach Bill
Walsh. "To get 10 wins in a sea
son, I think you have to go back to
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, so
we're really pleased."
The Stanford defense held Penn
State to just 107 yards rushing and
13-of-40 passing on the day, as well
as recording two interceptions.
One of the keys to the Cardinal de
fensive surge was the play of game
MVP Darrien Gordon, the corner
back assigned the responsibility of
going one-on-one with Nittany
Lion wideout O.J. McDuffie, a
probable first-round NFL pick.

Ryan Wetnight and Justin Armour celebrate Wetnight's first touchdown catch of the season in the first quarter of the
Blockbuster Bowl Friday.
Gordon was credited with an
incredible six pass breakups, and
he intimidated McDuffie into
dropping several other would-be
catches. The senior also recorded
seven tackles, the third-highest
total among Stanford defenders.
But more importantly for Gor
don, the Cardinal's second con
secutive bowl appearance and
first bowl victory since 1978 was a
chance for long-awaited recogni
tion for himself, his team and his
conference.

'Today we came out
and showed that the
Pacific 10 Conference
can play with anybody.
We sent a message to
the rest of the nation.'
— Darrien Gordon

"I don't think I got the recogni
tion I deserved all season, or that
the team did," Gordon said. "But
today we came out and showed
that the Pacific 10 Conference
can play with anybody. We sent a
message to the rest of the
nation."
Senior free safety John Lynch
— who may be playing many
more games in Joe Robbie Stadi
um if he chooses to pitch for base
ball's Florida Marlins rather than
play in the NFL — was even more
outspoken in his support of a fel
low member of the Cardinal
defensive secondary.
"I think it's a shame that Dar
rien didn't get more recognition
[before the game]," Lynch said.
"He shut out some of the best
receivers in the country in the
Pac-10 with [California's] Sean
Dawkins and [USC's] Curtis Con

way, and again he comes out and
does it today. He's a great player
and a great NFL prospect."
Nittany Lion head coach Joe
Paterno, a legend in his own
right, effectively summarized his
respect for the play of Gordon
and the Cardinal defense after
the game.
"You can't beat someone if
your offense is constantly being
stopped and having to give the
ball away," Paterno said.
While the Cardinal defense was
denying Penn State any access to
the end zone, Stanford's offense,
under the leadership of junior
quarterback Steve Stenstrom,
used 210 passing yards and 155
rushing yards to punish and even
tually wear down the Nittany
Lion defenders.
Stanford started the scoring by
taking the opening kickoff and
marching for an eight-play, 71-
yard drive. The march was capped
off by a Stenstrom-to-Ryan Wet
night two-yard touchdown pass.
The initial drive also featured
four running plays and four pass
ing plays, including three recep
tions by Wetnight, a senior tight
end.
Penn State closed the gap to 7-
3 after the ensuing kickoff, driv
ing 66 yards in 10 plays and get
ting a 33-yard field goal from V.J.
Muscillo, but that would be the
only time the Nittany Lions
would muster a threat to counter
a Cardinal score.
Stanford made it 14-3 at the
half when senior fullback J.J.
Lasley got into the end zone
untouched with 2:48 remaining
in the second quarter. The scor
ing play, which was the culmina
tion of a seven-play, 65-yard Car
dinal drive, came on an over-the
shoulder handoff from five yards
out that was unexpected both for
everyone watching and for every
one involved.
"I put the wrong arm up, but
the extra time it took for me to
turn around and get the ball actu
ally bought me the time to get to

the outside," Lasley said.
From that point on, everything
was to break the right way for the
Cardinal. After a field goal by
freshman placekicker Eric
Abrams put Stanford up 17-3
midway through the third quar
ter, the defense held and gave the
offense a chance to put the game

'You can't beat some
one if your offense is
constantly being
stopped and having
to give the ball away.'
— Joe Paterno

away.
And put it away the Cardinal
did. On second down from the
Penn State 40, Stenstrom threw a
screen pass to departing senior
tailback Glyn Milburn, who raced
down the right sideline for a
touchdown and an insurmount
able 24-7 lead.
"We actually just put that play
in this week," Milburn said. "The
receivers ran into the middle and
when the defensive backs bought
it, I was in the open."
The ever-modest Milburn,
however, played down the game
icing effect of his final touchdown
in a Cardinal uniform, as the
NFL-bound superstar preferred
to consider the significance of his
team's victory.
"Just to have a small part in
the win by scoring a touchdown is
great, but I would have been
happy just with the win, and to
have 10 wins on the year," Mil
burn said.
In all, the Cardinal's first win
of 1993 was vindication for a
nucleus of seniors recruited by
former head coach Dennis Green,
and should only help Stanford in
its quest to become a perennial
national powerhouse under

Walsh. One of the departing
seniors, defensive lineman Este
van Avila, pondered the legacy of
the last four years and the ulti

mate implications of this moment
in the program's history.
"I think we're legit. I think we
proved it today," Avila said. "I'm

tired of hearing about Stanford
not being a legit football school. It
took a long road to prove it, but I
think we proved it today."
