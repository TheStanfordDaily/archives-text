FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -
The Stanford Cardinal football
team concluded a remarkable 1992
season on New Year's Day 1993
with a resounding 24-3 Block
buster Bowl triumph over the Penn
State Nittany Lions in Joe Robbie
Stadium.
The Cardinal, employing a
strong defensive effort and a bal
anced offensive attack, raised its
record to 10-3, earning double fig
ures in victories for the first time
since 1940. By virtue of its out
standing performance and key
losses by teams previously ranked
ahead of it, Stanford vaulted from
No. 13 to No. 9 in both final major
national polls, marking the
squad's highest finish since the
Rose Bowl-winning team of 1971
finished eighth.
"It's just a great win for us,"
said Cardinal head coach Bill
Walsh. "To get 10 wins in a sea
son, I think you have to go back to
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, so
we're really pleased."
The Stanford defense held Penn
State to just 107 yards rushing and
13-of-40 passing on the day, as well
as recording two interceptions.
One of the keys to the Cardinal de
fensive surge was the play of game
MVP Darrien Gordon, the corner
back assigned the responsibility of
going one-on-one with Nittany
Lion wideout O.J. McDuffie, a
probable first-round NFL pick.
