Somalis attack U.N. leader
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) â€” The U.N. secre
tary-general took refuge with U.S. Marines yester
day when hundreds of Somalis who blame him for
their country's collapse pelted U.N. headquarters
with rocks and garbage, and tore down the U.N. flag.
Boutros Boutros-Ghali later departed for peace
talks in Ethiopia, promising "reconstruction, rec
onciliation and rehabilitation" for Somalia.
About 200 Somalis led a demonstration to the
walled U.N. headquarters, where Boutros-Ghali
was supposed to meet with U.N. workers and hold
a news conference.
The crowd quickly swelled to about 1,000, and
protesters chanting "Down, down, Boutros-
Ghali!" began throwing stones, tin cans, grape
fruit rinds and anything else.
The demonstrators were supporters of one of
Somalia's two main warlords, Gen. Mohamed Far

rah Aidid. Aidid has accused the United Nations of
siding with his rival, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, and of
supporting former Somali President Mohammed
Siad Barre.
Cabinet hearings approach
WASHINGTON (AP) - President-elect Clin
ton's choices for his Cabinet will face scrutiny by
Republicans as confirmation hearings commence
after the 103 rd Congress convenes tomorrow.
The new Cabinet members can't be confirmed
until after Clinton is inaugurated Jan. 20. But
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell is moving
to expedite the process.
"I don't know if there will be any controversy
over any of the nominees," Mitchell said in a tele
phone interview from Maine last week. "I hope
we're going to be able to confirm them soon after
the inaugural."
