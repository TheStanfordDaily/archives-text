# U.S., Russia sign agreement
## Third arms control treaty crowns Bush's presidency

MOSCOW (AP) â€” President
Bush and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin yesterday signed a
historic nuclear missile-reduction
treaty that crowned Bush's four
year presidency. Yeltsin proposed
an early summit with Bush's suc
cessor, Bill Clinton.
"It means a future far more free
from fear," Bush said of the far
reaching START II accord that,
after Senate ratification, will
reduce U.S! and Russian stockpiles
of long-range nuclear missiles to
about one-third of current levels.
Yeltsin said he wrote Clinton
two days ago proposing they meet
at a neutral site to ensure "there
should be no lull in our relations

with the new administration,
because any lull in the bilateral
relations between the superpow
ers would give cause for concern."
Clinton told reporters yester
day that he also wanted to meet
with Yeltsin but indicated such a
summit would take a back seat to
pushing his domestic legislative
agenda through Congress.
The signing ceremony and a
two-hour fireside summit meet
ing effectively ended Bush's four
year turn on the world stage.
Before returning to Washing
ton, Bush flew to Paris for talks
with French President Francois
Mitterrand, hoping to improve
prospects for adoption of a new

U.N. Security Council resolution
to keep Serbian planes out of the
skies over embattled Bosnia-
Herzegovina.
In 17 days Bush will leave the
White House, his place in history
assured by the third major arms
control treaty of his presidency.
The second Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty will eliminate
all land-based long-range missiles
with multiple warheads by 2003
or even earlier and impose a cap of
3,000 to 3,500 warheads each on
U.S. and Russian arsenals.
"It vindicates our insistence
that we must do more than simply
freeze the arms race in place,"
Bush said.
