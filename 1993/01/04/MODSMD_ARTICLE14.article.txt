## Editorial Civil justice is served

They done good, when
the University Board of
Trustees extended employee
benefits to the same-sex partners
of faculty and staff members last
month, they sent a strong, consis
tent message to the community,
affirming that civil rights are
upheld and honored — at least in
this Ivory Tower.
Only a handful of universities
nationwide extend benefits to
domestic partners for students or
employees, and even fewer provide
benefits to both, as Stanford now
does.
In addition, the constant
stream of anti-gay rhetoric from
think tanks like the Hoover Insti
tution — witness Hoover Fellow
Thomas Sowell's piece for Forbes
magazine defending the military
ban on gays — proves that dis
crimination is alive and well, even
among the educated.
But, particularly in light of the
recent Colorado law preventing
anti-discrimination laws that pro
tect gays, the Trustees' decision

marked another small victory in
the Civil Rights war.
Although some faculty mem
bers consider the Trustees'
decision — which extended ben
efits to same-sex couples but
denied them to unmarried oppo
site-sex couples — discrimina
tory on the basis of sexual ori
entation, their decision was
consistent.
The Trustees vote did not hinge
on whether or not the institution
of marriage — fundamentally an
economic pact between two people
who agree to take financial
responsibility for each other —
should be upheld by the Universi
ty. Rather, they were arguing that
discriminatory laws preventing
gay couples from marrying were
unjust.
The Trustees cannot change
these laws, but they rightfully
decided to compensate for them by
extending employee benefits to
those same-sex couples who would
choose marriage if given the legal
option.
