# Giving them the Axe

For two groups of
Stanford students, winter
break meant the continua
tion of a season-long pursuit of
excellence.
The women's volleyball and
men's football teams both
achieved a level of accomplish
ment that the campus has come to
expect, proving once again that
academics and athletics are not
dichotomous.
Stanford was able to best both
the UCLA volleyball and Penn
State football teams, both slated
as teams to beat at the start of the
season.
The women's team put an end to
UCLA's 44 game-long winning
spree. After losing to them twice
this season, Stanford's victory over
the No. 1 ranked-team displayed a

determination and a confidence
that have long personified every
aspect of Stanford University.
The men's football team — fin
ishing its season ninth in the
nation and ranked highest among
the Pac 10 — has achieved a nation
al recognition and pre-eminence in
both academics and athletics com
parable only to Duke University.
Over the last four years, Coach
es Denny Green and Bill Walsh
have brought national recognition
to our school. And, for the first
time in most undergraduates' life
times, Stanford had a 10-win sea
son and found itself among the
toplO in the nation.
The achievements of both
teams suggest that it's time for
Stanford to find a rival more chal
lenging than UC-Berkeley.
