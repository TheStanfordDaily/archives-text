EBF resident straightens out co-op's crooked perception

I HAVE BEEN PLEASANTLY sur
prised that The Daily has recently
taken an interest in describing co-op
life to the rest of campus. My home, the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), in
particular, has been the proud subject
of both an exclusive article in October
and a mini-review in a recent Intermis
sion feature on Co-Op cooking.
What does not come as a surprise,
however, is that, being the views of out
siders, they fail to accurately convey
what life here is like.
Daily writers seem to come to EBF
with a set of pre-conceived ideas about
what a place called the Enchanted Broc
coli Forest should be like and seek out
facts supporting these conclusions.
They then dutifully report to the rest of
campus that EBF lives up to its reputa
tion, thus ignoring facts and helping to
perpetuate untrue stereotypes in the

minds of the student body. I would like
to set the record straight on a couple of
issues.
EBF is not a house of hippies. While
residents often subscribe to countercul
tural lifestyles and worldviews, very few
of them resemble the hippies of the
19605. The Beastie Boys or Gwar are
just as popular as the Grateful Dead or
Phish.
EBF is not a vegetarian house.
Approximately 15 out of 51 residents
are vegetarians. We are, however, more
considerate of our vegetarians than the
University Food Service staff is of
theirs. Along these lines, there was no
tofu in anything the Daily culinary
"experts" ate on their visit. I would also
like to point out that it's ludicrous to
make some sort of ranking of co-op food
based on a single visit to each house.
Meat and free-range eggs were minor

house issues. Serious debates revolve
around major expenditures, for example
the recent proposal to buy a new televi
sion and VCR. In fact, the focus of the
meat debate was not morality but
money. Vegetarians needed to be reas
sured that an excessive amount of their
bills would not go to food they wouldn't
eat.
Tie-dying is not a "common house
activity." The only tie-dying I've seen
this year was at the hands of a mem
ber of a fraternity, placed in the
house through the vicissitudes of the
Draw.
What then does typify EBF? In my
mind, a couple of things, tolerance and
diversity being foremost among them.
Most residents do not feel compelled to
live their lives according to conventions
of the larger society. Having often been
victims of stereotyping and intolerance

themselves, they tend to give others the
space in which to do their own thing.
The generalization I am making is
that EBF residents tend to be individu
alistic and hard to generalize.
They do, however, have some gener
alizations of their own. They tend to
view the average Stanford student as
sadly limited by an inability to see the
world from new and unusual perspec
tives, perspectives that have not been
handed to them by their parents or
society.
The oversimplified Daily articles,
then, live up to our stereotypes as well
and serve only to rigidify the pre-con
ceived notions of both camps. This is a
shame considering the articles' poten
tial to break these barriers down.
