# Grad clarifies positions on strike possibility and graduate student issues
## 
### 
In the Dec. 9 article, "Grad students
unhappy, but strike unlikely," the state
ments attributed to me do not reflect my
position.
I do not bemoan "the disbanding of
the Graduate Student Association," but
rather the Dean of Graduate Studies
Office. For The Daily's edification, one is
an extant student club known for throw
ing multi-keg bacchanals — the other is
an extinct administrative unit that over
saw graduate programs and financial
aid.
In the article, I accuse the entire
administration of making budget cuts
that harm graduate students while
using the guiding principle, "If it hurts
— tough."

In fact, only the Dean's Office in the
School of Humanities and Sciences was
hostile towards graduate students when
revamping its financial aid system. How
ever, the repositioning and budget cut
ting processes certainly have ignored
and exacerbated the plight of graduate
students at Stanford.
Contrary to the dismal tone of the
article, I believe there is cause for guard
ed optimism. President Casper has
begun to discuss graduate student prob
lems publicly, and the appointment of
Charles Kruger to the new Dean of
Research and Graduate Policy position
is certainly a positive sign.
However, there are still large prob
lems facing graduate students. Addition
al budget cuts harming graduate stu
dents will be phased in next year, but
policy-makers haven't begun to review
the existing problems.
Graduate housing doesn't meet
demands, the allocation system is a mess
and no one is willing to discuss the pos

sibility of building more. In some disci
plines there is a large gap between
stipend level and living expenses, but
Stanford obscures the issue in offer let
ters that would make a used-car sales
man blush.
A strike is neither desirable nor like
ly, but graduate student issues need
attention now!
