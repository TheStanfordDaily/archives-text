# Museum director pleads for help in curtailment of sculpture vandalism
## 
### 
Our campus is known to be one of the
most beautiful in the United States, and
one of its significant assets is its collec
tion of outdoor art.
The collection includes the unique

Rodin Sculpture Garden and other
Rodins on campus, and sculptures by
artists such as Henry Moore, Alexander
Calder, Joan Miro and Joseph Albers.
Unfortunately, the outdoor nature of
the art provides an opportunity for van
dalism, as has happened on several
occasions in the last year and a half.
Vandalism not only causes deterioration
of the works, but significant restoration
costs.
My purpose in writing this letter is to
ask the Stanford community for their
help in protecting this valuable resource.
If anyone sees vandalism taking place,
please report the incident immediately
to the Stanford Police, along with any
information that would help the police
in tracking down vandals.
I hope in this way we can protect this
valuable University resource. I thank
you for your help.
Thomas K. Soligman
Director, Stanford University Museum
of Art
