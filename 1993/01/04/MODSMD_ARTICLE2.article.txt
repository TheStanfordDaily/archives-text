# Women's volleyball team earns first NCAA crown
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
For 11 consecutive years, the Stanford women's
volleyball team had played in the NCAA Tourna
ment, only to fall short of the title. For six of those,
head coach Don Shaw had seen his team advance
through the rounds, then suffer the heartbreaking,
dream-ending loss.
This year, however, the wait was over.
After a whirlwind tour through one of the tough
est brackets in the NCAA Tournament, the Cardinal
defeated the No. 1 UCLA Bruins in the NCAA Final
at Albuquerque, N.M., 15-8, 15-9, 6-15, 15-10, to
capture its first-ever national championship. The
win marks the first time Stanford has beaten UCLA
in the tournament, and avenges two regular-season
losses to the Bruins this year. Stanford's record in
creased to 31-2 with the win, the best mark ever
posted by a Stanford women's volleyball team.
"It's a very sweet win," said Shaw after the match.
"We knew that if we just kept banging on the door,
sooner or later either a hole would be formed or some
one would open it. I guess we made our own hole."
Take one look at Stanford's season and you '11 know
why Shaw used those words. The Cardinal lost twice
to the defending national champs this year, and had to
play in the difficult Mideast Regional at the Universi
ty of Illinois. Stanford took apart Penn State in the
first game of the Regional, 15-13, 15-6, 15-13, then
downed Illinois in a marathon match on the Illinois

Bedlam reigns as coach Don Shaw and the Stanford women's volleyball team rejoice after snapping
UCLA's 43-match winning streak and earning their first NCAA championship.
home court, 17-15, 15-6, 15-17,
15-10.
"We had to battle through that
entire regional," Shaw said. "Top
to bottom, the Mideast was proba
bly the toughest Regional in the
Tournament."
The win advanced the Cardinal
to the Final Four at The Pit at
University of New Mexico in
Albuquerque. But the 19-degree
temperatures and 5,000-foot alti
tude didn't seem to affect the Car
dinal's championship drive, as
they marched into the semifinal
match against No. 3 Long Beach
State.
Stanford rallied behind the
swings of Cary Wendell and Bev
Oden to defeat the Beach, 15-10,
15-12, 6-15, 15-9. Wendell and
Oden had 21 kills each to lead the
Cardinal to victory, a season-high
for Wendell, who also posted four
blocks, 14 digs, and a .415 hitting
average. Senior Jennifer Jackson
added 12 kills and four blocks,
while sophomore Anne Wicks tal
lied eight kills and a .267 average.
Long Beach's Danielle Scott,
the national hitting average lead
er, was silenced for most of the
match, mustering only five kills
and a -.050 hitting average
through game two. She finished
with 24 kills and a .241 average.
In the other semifinal, UCLA
took care of Florida in three
games, 15-12, 15-12, 15-10. Pacif
ic 10 Conference and NCAA Play
er of the Year Natalie Williams led
the Bruins with 31 kills and a .532
hitting percentage in that match,
followed by senior outside hitter
Elaine Youngs with 26 kills and a
.444 average.
That win set up the No.l-vs.-
N0.2 matchup between UCLA
and Stanford in the final match.
The Bruins entered the Final No.
1 in the country, riding a 43-
match winning streak which
included three wins over the Car
dinal.
They boasted the nation's lead
ing team offense in kills, kill aver
age, and hitting percentage, los
ing few games along the way, let
alone matches. Many in the media
were calling the Bruins the great
est collegiate women's volleyball
team ever, and even CBS's com
mentators were calling UCLA
"invincible."
But Stanford came out aggres
sively in the first game and led
early, 3-0. UCLA rallied to tie it at
7-7 before Stanford went on an 8-
1 run to wrap up the game, 15-8.

The Cardinal outhit the Bruins
.306 to .204 in the game as Oden
and Wendell combined for eight
kills.

In the second game, UCLA
jumped out to an early 4-0 lead,
but Stanford turned on the heat
behind the blocking of Wicks.

"That's what we have her in
there for," Shaw said. "She's real
strong, and that's something she
can give us out there."
Behind 5-1, the Cardinal
answered with an incredible 10-
point run to make it 11-5. After
UCLA cut the lead to 12-9, Stan
ford shut the door with three
straight points to take the second
game 15-9. The Bruins could only
muster a .122 hitting average
against the stifling Cardinal
defense, while Stanford outkilled
UCLA 20-13 on the game.
UCLA rallied in game three,
running off nine straight points
to close the game 15-6. The Bru-

ins' hitting got back on track, reg
istering a blistering .423 hitting
percentage while allowing the
Cardinal only a .031 average.
Williams, who could only manage
a .107 average through game two,
exploded for five kills and a .571
average in game three.
The Cardinal stayed neck-and
neck with UCLA in game four. At
5-5, Stanford ran off three points
and later led 8-6. The Cardinal
then rang up another two points
and forced a UCLA timeout at 10-
6. After the break, Stanford
scored two more to make it 12-6
before UCLA responded to cut it
to 12-8.
But the Cardinal would not be
denied their destiny. Kills by
Oden and Wendell made it 13-8.
Then, Youngs hit directly into the
right antenna to bring about
championship point for Stanford.
After three sideouts and another
UCLA point, All-Pac-10 freshman
Wendy Hromadka laid down the
championship point to send the
Cardinal bench into a frenzied
pile at mid-court.
"I don't think I can explain
how I feel right now," said Oden
following the victory. "It was our
dream at the beginning of the

year that we would get this far,
and it just feels good, but I don't
think it's really hit me yet."
Shaw was confident that his
team could handle the Bruins,
even after the Cardinal's two loss
es to them this year.
"Aside from all the hype, it just
came down to the fact that the
team who executed better would
win," said Shaw. "We knew we
had to come out and play with a
lot of intensity because they're a
great team, and we had to fight
through the Mideast [Regional],
so we came ready to battle here
for as long as it took."
UCLA head coach Andy Bana
chowski gave credit to Stanford
for playing a well-executed match
against his Bruins.
"I think they played an out
standing match," Banachowski
said. "Stanford put together their
best performance of the year
tonight, and they deserved to
win."
Banachowski denied that the
Bruins felt pressured to complete
the undefeated season or live up
to the media hype about the
"greatest team ever."
"I don't think we were over
confident — we respected Stan
ford and they played us tough
earlier this year," Banachowski
said. "But it doesn't change my
opinion — this is the greatest
team I've ever had, and it's just
too bad we couldn't go out with a
win."
Shaw, however, felt that all the
pressure was on the Bruins.
"There was a lot of pressure on
them, and it helped for us to be a
little relaxed coming in. Like I've
said before, it's the only match of
the year where we're the under
dogs, and that helps."
Shaw described the victory as
the completion of a year-long mis

sion. "Everything we did this year
was done with UCLA in the back
of our minds," Shaw said, "We
took care of business in the here
and now, but we knew that in
order to win the national champi
onship, you're going to have to
beat UCLA."
Senior setter and second-team
All-American Carrie Feldman

ness in the here and
now, but we knew

described the feeling of winning
the team's first national champi
onship after trying for each of her
four years at Stanford.
"We didn't panic tonight,"
Feldman said, "We just played at
a steady level, and they didn't
take care of their chances. We're
really excited, especially the
seniors. It's a great way to go
out."
But perhaps the quote that
most appropriately sums up the
feeling for Stanford was that of
Jennifer Jackson on the way out
of The Pit into the cold Albu
querque night. She simply yelled,
for everyone to hear, "National
Champions!"
And that's one they heard from
every backstreet in Albuquerque.
