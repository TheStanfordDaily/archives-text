## Everybody's so beautiful 
### 
Beauty is a startlingly
abstract concept. Anyone can easily
point out out where beauty exists,
but no one can definitively put a finger on
what it is. How can we describe the intan
gible element that unites a misty night
time skyline, an explosive wildflower or a
candy-apple-red vintage automobile so
shiny that pinpoint reflections of the sun
glide along the fenders in a sparkling
waltz?
I think we all have our own ideas about
the beauty of the human form as well. I
can recognize what I find physically
attractive in a woman, and I have a simi
lar grasp of the qualities I think make a
guy good-looking. It's a completely nor
mal outlook that all of us share.
Although everyone realizes these pri
vate images, public expression of them
leaves us much more divided. Magazine
swimsuit issues are annually interpreted
as efforts to oppress through objectifica
tion. In the workplace and elsewhere, an
innocent comment may wind up as the
key piece of evidence in a sexual harass
ment hearing.
No one has the right to abuse a posi
tion of power with seedy manipulations,
but forthright compliments shouldn't be
misconstrued as proof of evil intentions. I
don't have an ulterior motive behind
every nice thing I say, and I don't expect
others to either.
If my boss thinks I look good one day, I

know that she's not trying to belittle me.
She's being nice! When uninvited smiles
and compliments are perceived as nega
tive efforts of repression, it's clear that
our once healthy sense of cynicism has
taken a big step too far.
To some, the mere existence of general
American standards of beauty is what's
repressive, and that's unfortunate. Per
haps there is a feeling that the "ideal
woman" has a slim waist and an ample
chest; the "ideal man" must be tall and
brawny. We don't expect everyone to
match these features any more than we
expect every flower to be identical. But we
should feel comfortable enough to
acknowledge what we find attractive.
I often go to baseball games with a girl
who insists on sitting where she has the
best view of the batters' behinds. Now I'm
fully aware that she thinks Ryne Sand
berg has a nicer butt than I do, but I'm
also mature enough to realize that she's
not part of a conspiracy to make me feel
defective. If Ryno's got the best butt in
baseball, great — it's a flattering but
harmless title.
It would, of course, be irresponsible to
ignore the fact that all people are not as
comfortable with themselves as perhaps
they should be. People with self-confi
dence problems can easily find themselves
facing potential life-threatening situa
tions, like anorexia or steroid addiction.
But the images themselves are inciden

tal; the problem is one of self-confidence.
We'd be much more productive trying to
alleviate the pressures to conform to pic
tures of perfection, than in quelling oth
ers' appreciation of beauty. The attempt
to blame someone else, anyone else, for
the problem is tempting but wrong.
Beauty is something to be celebrated,
not battled. I know that Fabio isn't a
weapon in a female plot against men —
that would be silly. He's just a romance
novel cover model come to life.
Sports Illustrated swimsuit models
aren't oppressing women any more than
the Chippendale dancers are oppressing
men. They're both just examples of good
looking people getting paid to be, well,
good-looking. Hopefully we can be mature
enough not to begrudge them a living
when nobody's getting hurt.
A world where we couldn't appreciate
human beauty would be drab, dingy and
boring — kind of like "The Wizard of Oz"
without Technicolor. Don't let the overre
actions of a few keep you from watching
the better movie.
