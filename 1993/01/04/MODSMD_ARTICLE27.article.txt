# Women's hoops takes five of six over break
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
While most other students sat around
and relaxed, the Stanford women's basket
ball busily racked up five victories in six
games during the two-week vacation.
Stanford began its conquest against UC-
Santa Barbara, a squad that qualified for
the NCAA tournament and won the Big
West Conference title last year. However,
the Gauchos proved to be no match for the
mighty Cardinal.
Stanford jumped to a 38-17 lead in the
first half and never looked back from there.
Led by senior Chris MacMurdo's career
high 23 points, the Cardinal crushed its
West Coast foe by a score of 85-52.
On Dec. 18 and 19, Stanford hosted the
four-team Cardinal Classic, earning wins
against Harvard and Florida to capture the
tournament championship. Against the
Crimson, Stanford breezed to an 85-63 vic
tory as five players reached double figures
in scoring.
In the championship final, the Gators
put up a tough fight. Stanford managed
only a five-point halftime lead, but it
ensured a 76-66 win thanks to All-Ameri
can Val Whiting's 23-point, 14-rebound
effort.
Two days later, the Cardinal travelled to
Tennessee, hoping to avenge its 74-73 over
time loss to the Volunteers earlier in the
season. That defeat had knocked the Cardi
nal out of its position atop the national
rankings and had enabled Tennessee to
take over the No. 1 spot.
The first half was characterized by
aggressive play by both teams, and Stan
ford found itself trailing by a mere three
points at the break, 41-38. However, Ten
nessee blew the Cardinal off the court at
the start of the second period.
The Volunteers' defensive pressure

forced several Stanford turnovers, and to
make matters worse, guards Molly Gooden
bour and Kate Paye each picked up their
fourth foul early in the half. Tennessee
simply out-hustled and outplayed the Car
dinal, and suddenly built a 19-point lead at
the 10-minute mark.
"When you play a team like Tennessee,
everyone needs to be able to score," red
shirt freshman Bobbie Kelsey explained. "I
think we played timid, and they exploited
that. They gained all of the momentum
and had the home court crowd behind
them."
Though most squads would have rolled
over and died at that point, the Cardinal
mounted a valiant effort in the game's final
minutes. Led by Goodenbour, who convert
ed an amazing nine three-point baskets in
the game, Stanford managed to close the
score to 80-77 at the buzzer.
The loss dropped the Cardinal to the No.
3 position in the national rankings (behind
Tennessee and Vanderbilt), but did not pre
vent Stanford from dominating its next two
opponents.
Last Wednesday, the Cardinal faced
Long Beach State on the road and crushed
the 49'ers by a score of 98-61. Sophomore
Anita Kaplan had a game-high 24 points,
and Whiting added 20 points of her own to
lead Stanford. The Cardinal then defeated
the University of San Diego on Saturday,
71-49.
Now that classes are resuming, the 8-2
Cardinal will face an even more hectic
schedule, beginning tomorrow night with a
tough home game against Texas at Maples
Pavilion. According to Kelsey, Stanford
needs to improve its play in order to be suc
cessful in its upcoming games.
"We could have played much better even
though we beat teams by a lot of points,"
she said. "We need to play better to win
against other teams."
