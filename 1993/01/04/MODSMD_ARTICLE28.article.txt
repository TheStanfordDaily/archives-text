They may have spent their break splitting their eight
games, but at least they got to go to Hawaii and stare at
Duke coach Mike Kzyzewski's daughters by the pool.
The Stanford men's basketball team (6-5), still sad
dled with iryuries and struggling to find a starting line
up, headed off to the Maui Invitational after winning
home games against Sacramento State (68-33) and
Howard (71-46) at home.
Outmanned by the likes of Duke, BYU, Memphis
State, and Oklahoma, the Cardinal went 0-3 in the
tournament, losing to LSU, DePaul and Chaminade,
the Division II team hosting the tournament.
The Cardinal played a respectable first half in the
first round, tying the Tigers 31-31 at the half, but los
ing decisively, 72-63. Senior Brent Williams led the
team with 17 points, with senior Peter Dukes con
tributing 13.
DePaul scored a more decisive victory over the Car
dinal the next day, beating Stanford 76-67. Williams
scored 22 points on the game while senior Marcus Lol
lie contributed 15 points.
But for the Cardinal, the real disaster came at the
hands of Chaminade, which won in double overtime,
71-63. After tying at 52 in regulation, and scoring only
five points each in the first overtime, it was all Chami
nade, as they outscored the Cardinal 14-6.
As expected, Duke went on to win the invitational,
remaining undefeated and ranked No. 1.
Stanford then returned to Palo Alto to participate in
its own Fry's Invitational, where it beat American Uni
versity 57-56 on a buzzer-beating bank shot from junior
Jim Morgan.
The game marked 6-foot-ll Morgan's return after
suffering a herniated disk in his back early in the sea
son. In limited time, Morgan scored 12 points, making
him high scorer on the game.
But the team, still in transition, had trouble in the
final game, losing to Ohio 81-76.
The Cardinal will be entering conference play this
week on a winning note, after trouncing Santa Clara in
a decisive, if not impressive, 66-35 win last Saturday.
Santa Clara's anemic play gave the Cardinal much
needed confidence, and allowed Montgomery to explore
the team's depth, playing much of the bench.
