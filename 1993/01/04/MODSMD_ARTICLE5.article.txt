# In violation?
## University faces possible charges from state EPA 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
The California Environmental Protection Agency
informed the University last week that it found 28
possible violations of state regulations in Stanford's
hazardous waste management program.
Most of the violations found by the agency's De
partment of Toxic Substances Control were discov
ered during a spring 1992 seven-day inspection made
of the Environmental Safety Facility, the Universi
ty's central waste collection and storage site. The
other violations were found in research laboratories.
Calling the violations "very serious," CEPA
spokesman Allan Hirsch said yesterday that the
agency found open containers of hazardous waste,
waste stored in badly rusted containers and in unla
beled containers and incompatible waste stored in a
way that could have caused an explosion.
Larry Gibbs, Stanford's director of Environmen
tal Health and Safety, said the University is looking
over the report and will have a response ready by the
end of January.
Hirsch said the violations are typical of what is
found in inspections of other hazardous waste man
agement programs.
"What makes Stanford stand out is the number of
containers," he said.
While other sites usually have five to 10 containers
which are in violation of regulations, the number of
problematic containers found at Stanford numbered
in the hundreds.
According to Hirsch, at least 102 containers of
hazardous waste were left open, 15 were "badly rust
ed and ready to deteriorate," and another 300 were
unlabeled.
Another issue raised by the inspection is that of re
peat violations. Hirsch said the agency found several
violations similar to the ones
found in a 1988-89 inspection.
That inspection resulted in the
CEPA imposing a $186,000 fine,
which has not been settled yet.
The University "had told us
before this last inspection that
they had corrected the (previous)
violations," Hirsch said. "This is
very, very serious."
Hirsch said the CEPA is deliber
ating over two courses of enforce
ment action: The agency will either
issue a fine along with an order lay
ing out the steps the University
must take to correct the violations,
or it will sue the University and
have the matter decided in court.
"Violations of this sort are nor
mally associated with a fairly large
fine, though they are negotiable,"
Hirsch said.
The agency and the University
have yet not substantially dis
cussed the fines or the violations.
Gibbs, who came to Stanford
from Yale in October to replace

former director Tom Mc√üride, said
he has looked over the report but
has not had a chance to check out
the violations or look at all of the
back documentation.
The CEPA report is not the
final word, he said. The response is
allowed so the University can
"determine if there were circum
stances that may result in the mit
igation of the violations."
One such possible circumstance
that Gibbs cited is the definition of
"deteriorated." He said there is
some technical question over what
amount of rust on a container would
determine that it is "deteriorated."
He said another reason for the
high number of violations is the
stringent regulations the state
places on universities permitted to
store hazardous waste. Most Cali
fornia universities only have per
mits to generate waste.
Because Stanford has a permit
to store waste, it has "higher obli
gations and is much more strin
gently controlled," Gibbs said.
But, he added, the University
has made a number of changes in
an effort to comply with these
regulations.

One change that has been made
is in cleaning out laboratories.
Gibbs said that several of the vio
lations found during the spring
inspection were the result of a lab
clean-out in the chemistry depart
ment that occurred the day before
the unannounced inspection.
Because the lab was set to be
renovated the next day, workers
hastily stored the chemicals and
many were not labeled properly,
resulting in several of the viola
tions found in the inspection.
Changes have already been
made, though, to ensure that all
labeling will be completed before a
lab is cleaned out, Gibbs said.
Concerning the repeat viola
tions, Gibbs said that may be the
result of the agency's tendency to
look at the University as "one enti
ty." The same violation may occur
in one lab in one inspection and in
another lab in the next inspection,
and the agency would consider the
second one a repeat violation,
Gibbs said.
If the allegations of repeat vio
lations are valid, though, Gibbs
said "that is something that does
concern me greatly."
