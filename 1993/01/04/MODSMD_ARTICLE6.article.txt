# Building trust
## New dean of research to aid in adjustment to regulations 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Reestablishing trust between Stanford and the fed
eral government will be the first goal of Charles
Kruger, who began as the University's new dean of re
search Friday.
"It's not good for us and it's not good for them if we
do not have that trust," said Kruger, who succeeds
Robert Byer in the post.
Byer announced his retirement from the cabinet
level position in September after five years, the last two
of which wore consumed by the bitter fallout from the
indirect-cost controversy.
But Kruger, whose official title is "vice provost and
dean of research and graduate policy," said it is likely
that the University's negotiations with the govern
ment over research funding will become much less
fractious during the next few years.
"People in government and people here at Stanford
are looking forward to normal relations," said Kruger,
a 30-year member of Stanford's mechanical engineer
ing faculty and, most recently, the school's senior as
sociate dean for academic affairs.
However, he begins his new job just as the govern
ment is sharply limiting the amount it is willing to pay
Stanford to do research.
In a blow that could cost the University up to $12
million a year, the government's new indirect-cost reg
ulations propose ending the practice of "tuition remis
sion," or paying a portion of graduate students' tuition
through indirect costs.
But Kruger said the University can cope with the
changes. It will have ample time to make "adjust
ments," he said, during a five-year transition period set
up by the government to phase in the new regulations.
Along with research, Kruger will oversee graduate
policy â€” an added responsibility intended to allay the
concerns of graduate students who
fear they lack a central advocate
within the administration.
The dean of graduate studies
had played that role until two years
ago, when the position was elimi
nated in a budget-cutting move.
Since then, many graduate stu
dents have complained that no one
in the administration was examin
ing broad graduate issues such as
tuition, housing, and recruitment
of women and minority students.
Responding to those concerns,

University President Gerhard
Casper announced last month the
creation of an "associate dean for
graduate policy" position that will
report to Kruger.
And Provost Gerald Lieberman,
in announcing Kruger's appoint
ment last month, said Kruger will
be responsible for developing grad
uate policies that need to be han
dled on a University-wide basis.
Kruger said he plans to appoint
an associate dean very soon. "It's
an important and necessary posi
tion for the University and for grad
uate students," he said.
Byer, too, approved of the new
organization, which is similar to the
pre-1985 structure when Lieber

man held a position called "dean of
research and graduate studies."
"It's important for graduate stu
dents to know that there is a place
they can go if there are issues they
can't resolve at the school level,"
Byer said.
However, most graduate stud
ies decisions and administration
will remain with the individual
schools, in accordance with the
University's shift to a more decen
tralized form of management
begun several years ago.
"There are many good aspects of
decentralization, such as putting
responsibility at the school level,"
Kruger said. "But it'd be nice to
make these things work more

smoothly."
A specialist in high-temperature
gas dynamics, Kruger conducts
research on partially ionized plas
mas and diamond synthesis, and
teaches courses on physical gas
dynamics and fluid mechanics. He is
the author of more than 100 papers
and co-author of two textbooks.
Kruger currently serves as chair
of the Provost's Committee on Bud
get Implementation, which is
supervising the budget-cutting pro
cess. Last year, he chaired the Cab
inet Committee on Budget and
Strategic Planning, which decided
the cuts.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare
said Kruger's research background

and his deep involvement with the
budget-cutting process will be key
assets in his new position.
"He is a wise, thoughtful person
who I believe has great integrity
and enjoys great support among the
faculty," Zare said.
Evidence of the faculty's trust in
Kruger can be seen in his election
to chair of the Faculty Senate in
1990-91.
Byer was also pleased with
Kruger's selection. "I've known
Charles for quite a while, and he's
a very level-headed, reasonable per
son who cares a lot about Stanford
University," Byer said. "I don't
think there could have been a bet
ter choice for dean of research."
