## New dean of research to aid in adjustment to regulations

Reestablishing trust between Stanford and the fed

Kruger, who began as the University's new dean of re

Robert Byer in the post.
Byer announced his retirement from the cabinet
level position in September after five years, the last two
of which wore consumed by the bitter fallout from the
indirect-cost controversy.
But Kruger, whose official title is "vice provost and
dean of research and graduate policy," said it is likely
that the University's negotiations with the govern
ment over research funding will become much less
fractious during the next few years.
"People in government and people here at Stanford
are looking forward to normal relations," said Kruger,
a 30-year member of Stanford's mechanical engineer
ing faculty and, most recently, the school's senior as
sociate dean for academic affairs.
However, he begins his new job just as the govern
ment is sharply limiting the amount it is willing to pay
Stanford to do research.
In a blow that could cost the University up to $12
million a year, the government's new indirect-cost reg

through indirect costs.
But Kruger said the University can cope with the
changes. It will have ample time to make "adjust

up by the government to phase in the new regulations.
Along with research, Kruger will oversee graduate
policy â€” an added responsibility intended to allay the
