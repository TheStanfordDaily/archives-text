### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
School of Education Dean Marshall Smith
has been appointed to President-elect Bill
Clinton's transition team to brief officials in
the new administration on educational poli
cy.
Smith, who left for Washington, D.C. yes
terday, will be spending the next three to four
weeks assisting Secretary of Education nom
inee Richard Riley.
In December, Smith was named as one of
five "task force team leaders" in the Depart
ment of Education transit ion staff. His group
assessed current federal K-12 education pro
grams and prepared a report for the incom
ing secretary.
"What we produced was a few pages to tell
the secretary what he should know when he
walks in on Jan. 20," said Smith, a former
Department of Education official. "It's basi
cally a road map for |Riley)."
The report outlined the issues, policies
and problems in primary and secondary edu
cation which will confront the new secretary.
Now, he said, one of his main duties will be
to "help Riley to do some of the tasks" out
lined in his group's report, including working
with Congress and preparing budgets.
The new secretary has the Herculean task
of constructing two budgets in the first
month on the job, Smith said. He plans to ad

vise Riley on the $10 billion part of the bud
get that deals with K-12 education.
In addition, Smith will assist Riley in se
lecting sub-cabinet officials, setting an over
all message and implementing Clinton's
campaign promises.
"Riley is a lovely man. He's smart,
thoughtful and respectable," Smith said.
"But it's important to help him get familiar
with the department."
Smith said certain policy areas such as K
-12 education, vocational education and col
lege loans will be given immediate attention.
"We're expected to get programs off the
ground in these areas quickly," he said. "But
to have these programs rolling and to deal
with the budget — it's a big task."
But Smith remains optimistic that signif
icant educational reforms will be enacted
during the next four years.
"The stars are all in the right place to
make changes happen. We've got a Democra
tic president and a Democratic congress," he
said.
Smith's 11-member team was comprised
of prominent educators, political leaders and
educational scholars. They spent two weeks
in December meeting with the Bush admin
istration's education staff, Congressional
leaders and educational experts.
"It was a terrific group," Smith said. "We
fanned out and talked to people all over."
He said the group also spent a good deal of

time reading speeches made by Clinton and
Vice President-elect A 1 Gore in order to de
velop policies to meet campaign promises.
Smith is no stranger to federal education
policy-making or to Clinton. In 1990 and
1991, he worked with then-Gov. Clinton in
the National Governors' Association Confer
ence on Education. He advised the former
Arkansas governor on curriculum stan
dards. During the campaign, Clinton es
poused the idea of national curriculum stan
dards.
Smith "played an important role with the
Governors' Conference," explained School of
Education Prof. Kenji Hakuta, who was also
a member of the transition team. "He's one
of four or five key players outside of lawmak
ers who really knows Washington and he's
had a long-standing role in recent reforms."
Smith is currently an adviser to the Na
tional Education Goals Panel and a member
of the National Council of Educational Stan
dards and Testing, two groups formed at the
Governors' Conference.
Smith, who is currently taking a sabbati
cal year at the University's Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences,
downplayed talk of accepting a position with
in the department.
"You cross those bridges when you come
to them," he said. "But the bottom line is that
I intend to stay here."
A Democrat, Smith was chief of staff and

executive assistant to former Secretary of
Education Shirley Hufstedler in the Carter
administration.
Prior to that, he was an assistant commis
sioner for policy studies in the Office of Edu
cation, where he developed legislative pro
posals, regulations and programs for federal
involvement in education.
In addition to Smith and Hakuta, two
other people with significant Stanford con
nections have been involved in the transi
tion:
• Trustee Warren Christopher, a corpo
rate attorney from Los Angeles, co-directed
the entire transition process and w&<? nomi
nated by Clinton in late December to be sec
retary of state.
Christopher graduated from Stanford
Law School in 1949. He was president of the
Board of Trustees from 1985 to 1988 and is
still a member of the board.
• Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
Deputy Director Sidney Drell worked on the
Department of Energy transition team last
month. He studied and prepared a report on
national laboratories for incoming Secretary
of Energy Hazel O'Leary.
Drell said he was selected because of his
familiarity with both basic research and nu
clear programs at nat ional laboratories.
"It was a lot of hard work, a pressure cook
er process with a lot of confusion in it," Drell
said.
