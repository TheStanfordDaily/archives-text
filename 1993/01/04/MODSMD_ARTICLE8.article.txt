## Paul Kirkpatrick remembered as popular figure on campus 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Physics Prof. Emeritus Paul Kirkpatrick, co
inventor of the X-ray reflection microscope, died in
his sleep Dec. 26. He was 98.
Kirkpatrick was a pioneer in the use of X-rays for
scientific purposes and the earliest practitioner of
holograms.
The X-ray technique he and his graduate student
Albert Baez developed in 1948 is still used today in
both astronomy and medicine.
Having retired in 1958 after almost 30 years of
teaching, Kirkpatrick lived on campus and remained
a popular figure. He could often be seen pedaling
around campus on his bicycle, which he continued to
ride until two years ago.
Kirkpatrick was born July 21,1894, to a family of
homesteaders near Wessington, S.D., and he was
educated in a one-room schoolhouse.
His parents then moved to Southern California,
where he attended high school and went on to grad
uate from Occidental College.
Kirkpatrick spent two years teaching physics at a
Presbyterian mission college in Hangchow, China,
returning to the United States during World War I
to serve in the army.

After his military service, he received his doctor
ate from UC-Berkeley, specializing in X-ray
research.
Kirkpatrick's first position was at the University
of Hawaii, where he headed a one-man physics
department. Â»
He taught in Hawaii for six years, left to do more
research at Cornell, and then was offered a position
at Stanford in 1931.
Kirkpatrick was a vegetarian and avoided tobacco
and alcohol since his early days.
"I have never felt the need to conform, whether in
the cut of my clothes, the accoutrements of my bicy
cle, fads of speech, the momentary aversions and
enthusiasms for current songs, women, car models
or recreation," he said in an interview 10 years ago.
"This independence, or obstinacy, is traceable from
childhood through college and World War I experi
ence, and possibly clear up to date, through I have
mellowed somewhat since passing the age of 50."
Kirkpatrick is survived by his wife of almost 70
years, Mary Rose; daughters Pauline Abbe and Nan
Morrell; nine grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchil
dren.
Funeral services were private, but a memorial
service will be scheduled for sometime later this
month.
