Salomon Brothers
Quantitative Research Analyst
Salomon Brothers is an international investment banking firm that makes markets
in securities and provides a broad range of underwriting, financial advisory and
research services to governments, corporations, and institutional investors.
The BOND PORTFOLIO and EQUITY PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS GROUPS work with Sales,
Trading and Investment Banking to help Salomon Brothers' clients quantify and implement investment,
capital raising, hedging, and asset allocation strategies. This work includes the development of new
theoretical models for securities valuation, statistical analysis of data, and the development of
customized client presentations.
Quantitative Analysts typically act as generalists for up to two years, after which they move forward in
their careers by concentrating in one or more of the following areas:
• Modeling financial products such as mortgage backed securities and options;
• Portfolio Structuring and/or Asset Allocation;
• Sales, Trading, or Investment Banking Support;
• Analysis of Stock and Bond Market Returns and Yields; and
• Analytical Systems Development.
While prior background in finance and economics is helpful, we believe that, given appropriate training
and guidance, an analyst with exceptionally strong quantitative skills can come to a deep understanding
of the financial markets.
Training for quantitative analysts includes:
• An introduction to securities analytics;
• A period of internship in different quantitative groups;
• Immediate hands-on training with professionals working on various projects;
• Licensing with the securities industry regulators; and
• Additional technical training as needed to handle newly assigned tasks.
Qualified candidates will have a B.S. in a quantitative field such as Computer Science, Engineering,
Finance, Mathematics, Operations Research, or Statistics. Good analytical and computer skills (C/Unix
preferable) are required. Because so much of the analyst's work involves direct interaction with the
Firm's clients, strong interpersonal, writing and speaking skills are required. Knowledge of the financial
markets is viewed positively.
