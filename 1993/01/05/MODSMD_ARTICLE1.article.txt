### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Almost three months after
Columbus Day, junior Russ
Calleros is still fighting to change
the meaning of that celebration.
Last night Calleros presented a
petition with 367 signatures to
the Palo Alto City Council re
questing that the body adopt a
resolution or a city ordinance re
naming the holiday Indigenous
People's Day"in respect to Native
Americans."
He read the petition, which em
phasizes the importance of Native
American heritage and history,
aloud during his presentation.
Because the petition was not on
the agenda, there was no discus
sion of the idea by City Council
members. The issue must be
placed on a future meeting agenda
by a member before any discus
sion can take place.
Calleros said he plans to lobby
individual council members in an
attempt to ensure that the issue is
placed on the agenda and dis
cussed in depth.
"It would be a bummer if it
didn't get on the agenda," said
Calleros. "I expect at least that
much."
Calleros, a Latino who lives in
Muwekmah-Tah-Ruk, began his
petition drive on Oct. 9 at the
Quincentennial Rally and has
continued collecting signatures
ever since.
Although he did not reach his
original goal of 1,000 signatures,
Calleros said he would continue
collecting signatures if more were
necessary to convince the City
Council to consider his petition.
If Palo Alto adopts a resolution
altering Columbus Day, it will be
the second city in the United
States to honor Native Americans
with a holiday. Berkeley has cele

brated Indigenous People's Day
since 1991.
Calleros told the City Council
that the change "would help
establish respect for Native
Americans in the present and in
the future." He said altering the
celebration would be especially
important following last Octo
ber's celebration of the 500 th
anniversary of Columbus' voyage.
"The 500 th anniversary of
Columbus' arrival should not
make us think of conquest, but of
pain — a pain that exists in the
many drops of blood that stain
the pages of history," Calleros
read.
