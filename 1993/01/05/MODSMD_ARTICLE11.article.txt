Clinton economic team to meet
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — President
elect Clinton, trying to lock in a plan for deficit
reduction and economic revival, studied brief
ing books yesterday and summoned his eco
nomic advisers to their first joint meeting.
The newly minted economic team will meet
with Clinton Thursday to review options they
presented before Christmas and to discuss the
state of the economy, spokesman George
Stephanopoulos said.
He said the latest estimates of the Congres
sional Budget Office, showing the deficit wors
ening to $293 billion for fiscal 1994, "make our
attempts to address the deficit more urgent
and more necessary at the same time, and
that's what we intend to do."
New findings support Big Bang
PHOENIX (AP) — A new X-ray satellite has
detected evidence in seldom-studied galaxies of
the invisible matter that astronomers think
could make up most of the mass in the uni
verse.
The research provides fresh support for the
theory that the universe, which astronomers
believe has been expanding rapidly since a Big
Bang some 10 billion years ago, eventually will
become stationary.
Four astronomers announced at a news con
ference yesterday that X-ray studies by a satel
lite called ROSAT found a huge cloud of gas —
with more mass than 500 billion suns — that
has been heated to some 18 million degrees
amid a trio of obscure galaxies known as the
NGC23OO group.
Bush wins 'Medal of Mediocrity'
CASCADE, Colo. (AP) — President Bush
was awarded the Millard Fillmore Society's
tongue-in-cheek "Medal of Mediocrity" yes
terday, beating out runners-up Woody Allen,
Vice President Dan Quayle and the Postal
Service.
The group said Bush clinched its 1992
award when his popularity plummeted from a
record high after the Persian Gulf War and he
lost the Nov. 3 presidential election to Bill Clin
ton. t
"Fresh from the flutter of a million yellow
ribbons and a 90 percent approval rate, Presi
dent Bush belly-flopped like a wounded swan
into the lake of American despair," said Phil
Arkow, vice president of the nationwide group.
