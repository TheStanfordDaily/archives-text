ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -
Students protesting the presence of
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali clashed with security
forces yesterday, and the government
said one person was killed and up to
100 were injured.
Witnesses said four people died from
bullets fired by both sides.
The demonstration by students at
Addis Ababa University over planned
U.N. involvement in the breakaway
province of Eritrea was the third aimed
at Boutros-Ghali on his trip to Eastern
Europe and East Africa.
He was jeered and spat upon in Sara
jevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina on Thursday
and had to take refuge in Mogadishu on

Sunday when protesters in the Somali
capital pelted the U.N. office with rocks
and garbage.
Yesterday, Boutros-Ghali was at a
U.N.-sponsored conference on reconcil
iation of Somalia's many armed fac
tions when an anti-U.N. rally turned
violent about four miles away.
A crowd estimated by government
officials at 2,000 to 3,000 people was
protesting U.N. plans to send
observers to a referendum on indepen
dence for Eritrea, Ethiopia's northern
most province.
Students tried to march from the
campus and fought with security forces
at the school's main gate before shots
were fired, according to witnesses and

authorities. It was unclear which side
started the violence.
Eritrean guerrillas fought a 30-year
war of secession, which ended in victo
ry in 1991 when the national govern
ment fell to a loose coalition of rebel
groups. Independence for the province
remains a highly charged issue else
where in Ethiopia, with some objecting
to what they call the dismemberment of
the state.
Kinfe Gebre-Mehdin, vice minister
at the Interior Ministry, said one civil
ian was killed and gunfire wounded
three security officers and 13 students.
Up to 100 people were injured by
stones, clubs or stabbings, he said.
The national police commissioner,

Hassan Shifa, said the security officers
were shot by demonstrators armed
with pistols.
One person was dead on arrival at
Menelik Hospital and 12 people were
treated for injuries, said a hospital official
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
At least 30 people were treated for
injuries at the Yekatit 12 hospital, some
with bullet wounds but most suffering
injuries from rocks or clubs, said the
hospital's chief of staff, Bekele Lemma.
Several of the injured were security
personnel, he said.
Reporters saw at least seven people
with gunshot wounds at the hospital,
as well as a dozen badly injured and
many with lesser wounds.
