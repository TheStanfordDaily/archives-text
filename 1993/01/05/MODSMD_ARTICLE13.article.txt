MOSCOW (AP) — Georgian leader
Eduard Shevardnadze asked the U.N.
Security Council yesterday to send peace
keepers to Abkhazia following an outbreak
of fighting that left at least 19 people dead.
The Georgian government sent troops
to the rebellious province along the Black
Sea in mid-August and now controls about
one-half of the resort area, including the
capital Sukhumi.
An Abkhazian artillery and rocket
attack yesterday in Sukhumi killed five
people and wounded several, the Georgian
military command said. At least 12 people
were killed in other fighting around the
province since Sunday, reports said.
The military command said the attack
was "the worst since the war started," with
shells and Grad rockets hitting a hospital, a
government building and a residential area
on the outskirts of town. About 10 houses
were destroyed.
Abkhazian reports also note artillery
duels in the area of Sukhumi and armed
clashes in other districts of Abkhazia.
The head of the Georgian administration
for Abkhazia, Tamaz Nodarishvili, warned
of retaliation. In a statement broadcast by
Georgian radio, he said Georgians would
shell the Abkhazian stronghold of Gudauta,

"where the clique of (Abkhazian leader)
Vladislav Ardzinba is holed up."
But Shevardnadze, also speaking on the
radio, said he had not given such orders
because "we must live with Abkhazians in
the future."
Shevardnadze sent a letter yesterday to
the Security Council, asking it to dispatch
peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
Nodarishvili, the Georgian administra
tor, said 10 people died in the Abkhazian
shelling of Sukhumi since Saturday.
Ardzinba, in a statement carried by
ITAR-Tass, said nine civilians, mostly
women and children, were killed and 12
were wounded Sunday when Georgian
fighter jets bombed several Abkhazian vil
lages in the Ochamchira area.
The central government in Tbilisi says it
sent troops into Abkhazia to crush guerril
las backing the ousted Georgian president,
Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
But leaders of the Abkhazian minority
saw it as a move to derail their indepen
dence campaign and fought back. Muslim
volunteers from the Russian northern
Caucasus have fought alongside the Abk
hazians. Hundreds have been killed and
thousands made homeless.
