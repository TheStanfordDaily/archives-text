# Protesters call for Packwood to resign
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
More than two dozen sign
carrying, chanting demon
strators asked yesterday that
the Senate refuse to seat
Sen. Bob Fackwood and
vowed to keep up the pressure
if he's sworn in, as expected,
as a member of the 103 rd
Congress.
The Oregon Republican has
admitted making unwanted
sexual advances to his Senate
employees and others, but has
resisted calls for his resigna
tion.
The National Organization
for Women organized the
demonstration outside the
Russell Senate Office Building.
NOW leaders asked the Senate
to agree to petitions, previously
filed by Oregon residents, ask
ing that Packwood not be seat
ed today.
The petitions contend that
Packwood defrauded voters and
submitted derogatory informa
tion about his accusers that

delayed publication of a news
story about his conduct until
after the November election.
Packwood was narrowly elected
to his fifth term.
NOW President Patricia Ire
land told the rally that "it
would be unrealistic" to expect
the Senate to refuse to seat
Packwood. But she promised to
build public pressure to force
his resignation.
Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine,
asked the Senate counsel to
review the Oregon petitions
but no decision was expected
yesterday, a Mitchell aide
said.
Packwood spokeswoman
Bobbi Munson said the senator
"plans to be sworn in. I don't
see any obstacles to that."
There was no comment
from Packwood.
The Senate Ethics Commit
tee has begun a preliminary
inquiry into Packwood's con
duct.
