Waste storage violations
intolerable at a university
boasting a global view

FOR SEVERAL YEARS now,
University officials and fac
ulty members have been
forging global ties and proclaim
ing Stanford a "World University"
with the potential to solve prob
lems like global warming.
But it seems the Stanford
administration, much like the
Bush Administration, has been so
busy solving the rest of the
world's problems it lost sight of
what was happening in its own
backyard.
According to the California
Environmental Protection Agen
cy, Stanford has fouled its own
nest.
During the last days of 1992,
CEPA informed the University
that 28 possible violations of state
regulations were found during a
seven-day inspection of Stanford's
Environmental Safety Facility last
spring.
The violations, which a CEPA
official called "very serious"
include neglecting 15 containers of
hazardous waste that were "badly
rusted and ready to deteriorate,"
leaving 102 containers of haz
ardous waste open and failing to
label 300 others.
If the CEPA report is accurate,
the violations are very serious
indeed.
And the University response so
far has been pathetic.
Although an official University
response will not be released until
later this month, officials have
addressed these violations by
challenging CEPA on semantics
— saying there is some question
as to just how rusty a container
can be before it is considered
"deteriorated" and by saying — in
essence — that the University
was just having a bad day when
the inspectors made their unan
nounced visit.

According to Larry Gibbs, Stan
ford's director of Environmental
Health and Safety, who took over
in October — several months after
the inspection was conducted —
many of the violations can be
explained by the fact that the sur
prise visit happened to fall on the
day after employees had hurriedly
cleaned out a lab that was about to
be renovated.
In their haste, employees failed
to properly store and label some
chemicals.
These unplanned, mismanaged
situations, however, are precisely
the reason CEPA inspectors con
duct surprise visits.
No one doubts that Stanford
could have had fewer violations
had officials been warned in
advance of the visit.
Apparently, measures have
since been taken to ensure all
chemicals are properly labeled
before a lab is cleared out, and to
Gibbs' credit, he has also men
tioned the need to insure that all
employees in all areas of the Uni
versity are kept up-to-date and
informed on regulations.
However, these steps are intu
itive, not innovative; it's going to
take a lot more than keeping waste
management personnel well
versed on waste management pro
cedure for the University to regain
the trust of the community.
It's both ironic and sad that an
institution that stands on the
forefront of environmental tech
nology can not take responsibility
for the hazardous waste it pro
duces.
And it's clear that in addition
to solving the rest of the world's
problems, the University's scien
tific community must look
inward.
As one of the most prestigious
universities and research centers
in the world — one that prides
itself on its innovative environ
mental programs and research —
Stanford should be setting the
standards for environmentally
responsible research practices, not
violating them.
