## Peace and quiet spoiled 
### 
SOLITUDE. THAT'S ALL I really
wanted for Christmas. Sure, I was
happy with the fact that earrings and
panda bear slippers were easily exchange
able for a pair of duck boots for my muddy,
quarter-long visit to the Zuni reservation
in New Mexico.
But I was really looking forward to
silence too. I had made a wonderful deal to
drive someone else's car to Zuni for her;
someone whose car was at Stanford but
whose in-laws were in Albuquerque. It
was going to be me, the road and the wide
open sky. I was ready for a Brad Winters
experience.
But now I'm not sure if I'm ever going to
make it to New Mexico. Nope, the car didn't
explode — but my mother did, as soon I
walked in the door after driving from Stan
ford to L.A. Having arrived a few days ear
lier, my sister had already been coerced into
revealing details about my journey which I
had avoided relating, namely that I had no
plans to take a passenger.
Quickly my illusions about 12 golden
hours of self-sufficiency slipped into
squabbles about safety. On Christmas
morning the first thing my mother said
was that, late the night before, she just
happened to call Southwest Airlines to
check out the times of one-way flights
from Gallup to Los Angeles for herself,
while calling our relatives in Ireland.
It seems like every person that has come
through our front door in the past two

weeks has also had a similar agenda. Our
neighbor assured my mother that there
was absolutely no way I could make it to
New Mexico alone in the winter — if I were
as incompetent a driver as his ex-wife.
My Sunday School teacher from ninth
grade called several times hinting at his
availability for a nice little drive through
the Southwest — he really just wanted to
ride the train back, he said. My aunt sug
gested renting a cellular phone. My
friend's uncle wanted me to take a short
wave radio class. My high school principal
joked that he had a few extra rifles he kept
handy for just such occasions. Too bad the
Subaru Justy didn't have a gun rack
option.
All this overzealous concern seemed a
bit misplaced — no one asked if I could
change a tire, cared that the car had four
wheel "Hrive, or found out how quickly
Interstate 40 gets plowed when it snows.
No one said the word "rape" either. But
the thought echoed every time someone
zeroed in on the same question with raised
eyebrows and sidelong glances: "You're
going alone?"
It didn't matter that I was a self
defense instructor, that I had traveling
experience. In their minds I was a young,
blonde woman who looked even younger
than she was, potentially stranded by her
self on a dark desert highway.
Because it's taken me a long time to
find some confidence in my abilities, it's

difficult to accept the people who have
been my biggest supporters in the world
suddenly telling me that it's great to do
what I want to do — just as long as I do it
within well-lit, well-populated limits.
I can't be angry with them though,
because they have my best interests in
mind — if safety is my best interest. Their
worries are certainly justified. But per
haps the overprotectiveness of these peo
ple is based on the same societal concept of
women that tells attackers that women
make easy victims — the concept that
women are vulnerable, helpless and
unable to think and act wisely in unex
pected situations.
I'm not going to find peace in a world
where little red lights of danger in the
back of my mind can eventually suffuse
even the most beautiful view and quietest
drive. So I'm left to wonder whether
there's any freedom to be gained from
going it alone anyway — and to imagine a
world where solitude and security aren't
antithetical ideals for a woman to want.

Even though Andrea Parkes will be at the
Zuni reservation in New Mexico this quar
ter, her column will continue to appear
here Tuesdays.
