Track club members step forward to defend ex-coach

WE READ WITH AMUSEMENT
and fondness Tish Williams' rec
ollection of the horrible Brooks
Johnson years at Stanford. To para
phrase Williams, it was news to us.
No, not the nicknames, the head
thumping, the bourgeoisie references.
The news to us was that Williams
would have us believe that her singular
opinion of the man is shared by the
majority of the free world.
We do not mean to imply that every
one loves Johnson, but it only seems
fair that another, less myopic, view of
his era be seen.
Williams would have you believe
Johnson was unsuccessful in his 13
years at Stanford. The "Plague's hellish
program" only produced four consecu
tive NCAA women's Cross Country top
three team finishes, numerous NCAA
individual distance running titles and
Stanford's first and only PAC-10 Cross

Country Men's team title.
By the way, Brook's team was sec
ond only to UCLA in number of 1988
track Olympians.
"Irrelevant. Who cares?!"
That's what Brooks would say. To
him athletic success, and failure as
well, is a means to a much larger end.
His goal — for all of his athletes — is
their development as people.
To Brooks, it's PattiSue Plumer,
attorney, Dr. Kim Schnurpfeil, surgeon
and Ceci St. Geme, mother of two. Nev
ermind that these ladies were all NCAA
Champs under him.
A combined 51 years of Brooks expe
rience has shown us that he clearly
cares about his team first as people,
then as students, and finally as ath
letes. Brooks often said, "I'm not your
Mamma, I'm not you Daddy, I'm not
your friend. I'm your coach."
Most people can recall a high school

teacher or coach who was a disciplinari
an that had a tremendous positive
influence on their lives, as Brooks has
had on ours.
Williams states, "Brooks Johnson
had decided that I was some spoiled,
cushy weakling unable to work hard
and too lazy to finish an 'easy distance'
day of 10 miles." Who can say if Brooks
believed that, but if the track spike fits,
wear it baby. It appears that being "one
of the better (high school] runners in
L.A." wasn't worth much in the com
petitive world of collegiate distance
running, was it?
We are amused by the egocentricity
of Williams regarding her inability to
see the majority of Stanford undergrad
uates and alumni (such as ourselves) as
bourgeoisie. Wake up! It doesn't get
much more bourgeois than here.
Correct us please, but upon last
check the Phi Delt parking lot was still

full of BMWs, Mercedes, and VW Cabri
olets (Phi Delt dates). Williams may
consider the term offensive, but Brooks
used it to convey socioeconomic class,
with all of its implications.
After being told 23 hours a day that
one is God's gift to academia and part
of the finest set of human beings ever
to come out of high school, being called
"shithead" may be just what one needs.
Brooks attitude was a refreshing and
educational alternative to the coddling
and insular environs of The Farm.
Finally, it is with great regret that
we inform Willliams that "shithead"
was not solely reserved for her. In fact,
it really wasn't a nickname at all, but
just a part of Brooks Johnson, a man
we respect greatly.
