## Cardinal takes on Longhorns in women's top 20 showdown National champion volleyballers to be honored at half tonight 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
The defending national champion
women's basketball squad rarely gets to
play an easy opponent. Things will be no
different for the Cardinal when it
squares off tonight against the 17th
ranked Texas Longhorns, a team that
has one of the strongest traditions in
women's basketball.
This game marks the end of a suc
cessful non-conference campaign for
Stanford in which the Cardinal com
piled an impressive 8-2 record, losing
both times to second-ranked Tennessee
by a combined margin of four points.
Although these defeats dropped Stan
ford from No. 1 to No. 4 spot in the
national polls, its current ranking does
not worry the players.
"It's hard to be No. 1," said redshirt
freshman Bobbie Kelsey. "I think we do
better when we're not No. 1 because
there's a lot of pressure when |a team is
ranked at the top|."
Of greater concern to the Cardinal is
that it has not been playing up to its full
potential in its eight victories.
"I hope better days are ahead for our
team," Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "1 think we need to be
improving quicker."
Kelsey agreed with VanDerveer's
assessment of the team's performance
during its preseason games. "We should
have played much better, but we'll take
the wins," she said.
Facing a top squad like Texas affords
the Cardinal the opportunity to polish its
style before Pacific 10 Conference play
begins Thursday against Oregon State.
"[A game like this] really gets you

ready for the Pac-10," VanDerveer said.
"I hope [tonight's game) gives us momen
tum going into the Pac-10 season."
Stanford must focus on shutting
down Texas' All-American candidates
Vicki Hall, a forward, and center Cinietra
Henderson. Stanford's own All-Ameri
can center, Val Whiting, should prove to
be a good matchup for Henderson. On
the year, Whiting has averaged 16.7
points and 8.9 rebounds per game, while
Henderson has tallied 17.8 points and
7.6 rebounds.
The Cardinal will also look for major
contributions from senior point guard
Molly Goodenbour, who leads the team
in three-pointers and assists, and from
forwards Chris MacMurdo and Anita
Kaplan. Sophomore reserve Kate Paye
also has been impressing VanDerveer
during the last few games.
"Kate |has| played good defense and
played real heads-up basketball," the
eighth-year coach said.
VanDerveer described the Longhorn
squad as "big, quick and physical" and
emphasized that Stanford needs to work
on its overall approach to the game if it is
to be successful tonight.
"We need to improve our concentra
tion and our intensity," she said. "I'm
concerned with our team effort."
Kelsey feels that in addition to
improving the team's attitude, the Cardi
nal must continue to dominate its oppo
nents in the transition game.
"I think we mainly have to concen
trate on rebounding and running .. .
And," she quickly added, "we have to do
that both halves."
Cardinal Notes
Stanford forward Rachel Hemmer, who sus
tained an eye injury in a Dec. 19 game against

Florida, will return to action tonight after
missing the Cardinal's last three games . ..
Texas head coach Jody Conradt became the
first women's college coach to reach 600 victo
ries when the Longhorns defeated Creighton
86-69 earlier this season. She will be honored
for this historic achievement just before
tonight's game .. . The national champion
women's volleyball squad will be recognized
for their outstanding season in a halftime cer
emony tonight . . . The first 1,500 students
will once again be admitted free to tonight's
game as they have been for all men's and
women's basketball games this year.

Angela Taylor looks on as Val Whiting amazes the crowd — and two UC-Santa Barbara
defenders — with a drive to the hoop in a game last month. The fourth-ranked Cardinal
women meet No. 17 Texas tonight at Maples Pavilion at 7:30 p.m.
The defending national champion
women's basketball squad rarely gets to
play an easy opponent. Things will be no
different for the Cardinal when it
squares off tonight against the 17th
ranked Texas Longhorns, a team that
has one of the strongest traditions in
women's basketball.
This game marks the end of a suc
cessful non-conference campaign for
Stanford in which the Cardinal com
piled an impressive 8-2 record, losing
both times to second-ranked Tennessee
by a combined margin of four points.
Although these defeats dropped Stan
ford from No. 1 to No. 4 spot in the
national polls, its current ranking does
not worry the players.
"It's hard to be No. 1," said redshirt
freshman Bobbie Kelsey. "I think we do
better when we're not No. 1 because
there's a lot of pressure when |a team is
ranked at the top|."
Of greater concern to the Cardinal is
that it has not been playing up to its full
potential in its eight victories.
"I hope better days are ahead for our
team," Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "1 think we need to be
improving quicker."
Kelsey agreed with VanDerveer's
assessment of the team's performance
during its preseason games. "We should
have played much better, but we'll take
the wins," she said.
Facing a top squad like Texas affords
the Cardinal the opportunity to polish its
style before Pacific 10 Conference play
begins Thursday against Oregon State.
"[A game like this] really gets you

ready for the Pac-10," VanDerveer said.
"I hope [tonight's game) gives us momen
tum going into the Pac-10 season."
Stanford must focus on shutting
down Texas' All-American candidates
Vicki Hall, a forward, and center Cinietra
Henderson. Stanford's own All-Ameri
can center, Val Whiting, should prove to
be a good matchup for Henderson. On
the year, Whiting has averaged 16.7
points and 8.9 rebounds per game, while
Henderson has tallied 17.8 points and
7.6 rebounds.
The Cardinal will also look for major
contributions from senior point guard
Molly Goodenbour, who leads the team
in three-pointers and assists, and from
forwards Chris MacMurdo and Anita
Kaplan. Sophomore reserve Kate Paye
also has been impressing VanDerveer
during the last few games.
"Kate |has| played good defense and
played real heads-up basketball," the
eighth-year coach said.
VanDerveer described the Longhorn
squad as "big, quick and physical" and
emphasized that Stanford needs to work
on its overall approach to the game if it is
to be successful tonight.
"We need to improve our concentra
tion and our intensity," she said. "I'm
concerned with our team effort."
Kelsey feels that in addition to
improving the team's attitude, the Cardi
nal must continue to dominate its oppo
nents in the transition game.
"I think we mainly have to concen
trate on rebounding and running .. .
And," she quickly added, "we have to do
that both halves."
Cardinal Notes
Stanford forward Rachel Hemmer, who sus
tained an eye injury in a Dec. 19 game against

Florida, will return to action tonight after
missing the Cardinal's last three games . ..
Texas head coach Jody Conradt became the
first women's college coach to reach 600 victo
ries when the Longhorns defeated Creighton
86-69 earlier this season. She will be honored
for this historic achievement just before
tonight's game .. . The national champion
women's volleyball squad will be recognized
for their outstanding season in a halftime cer
emony tonight . . . The first 1,500 students
will once again be admitted free to tonight's

women's basketball games this year.
