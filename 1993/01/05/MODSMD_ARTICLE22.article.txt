# Blockbusting out all over: one man's Florida adventure
## 
### 
The Clueless Cabbie Caper, The Sev
enty Seat Safety Show and The
Press Pigout (or How I Spent My
Winter Vacation):
I have covered hundreds of sporting
events thus far in my journalistic career
— everything from football to fencing,
from running to rough water swimming.
I was there when my high school foot
ball team broke through after 25 years
and won its first CIF championship
game. I was covering Stanford's men's
golf team last season when it won its first
conference title in 15 years. And I was
responsible for following the meteoric
rise to national prominence of the Cardi
nal women's gymnastics team as it
advanced to its first-ever NCAA Champi
onship meet in 1992.
While I have reaped unique memories
through the years from every one of my
experiences as a member of the working
press, it was my first assignment of 1993
— last Friday's Blockbuster Bowl — that
provided enough drama and excitement
to get me through any number of lawn
bowling matches and grass-growing con
tests that it may be my fate to cover in
the months and years to come.
Here's a blow-by-blow, day-by-day
account of what it's like to be part of the
spectacle of a New Year's Day college
football bowl game:
Monday, Dec. 28
After spending a disproportionate

amount of Dead Week and finals week
making travel arrangements (only time
will tell how my grades and future
employment reflect this practice), and
getting less than 10 days at home in
Southern California, it's time to hit the
highway and drive back to the Bay Area
to catch my flight.
For my entire stint at home, weather
throughout the state had held out beauti
fully. So naturally, as Murphy's Law
(when applied to notoriously pleasant
California weather) would dictate, it
started raining and even snowing along
some parts of the interstate the night
before my departure. This would be no
problem under any other circumstances,
but I have a plane to catch. I allow nine
hours, or about three more than I would
normally need, and make the 10 p.m.
deadline to be on campus with half an
hour to spare. So far, I'm not feeling very
glamorous.
The highlight of the day actually
comes on the flight to Fort Lauderdale, a

nonstop red-eye from San Francisco.
When I slated my itinerary for this trip, I
hadn't just made any plans. After all. The
Daily was footing the bill. I had booked a
spot on the Athletics Department Second
Charter, a Delta Boeing 767 that con
tained important alumni boosters,
department staff, the Stanford yell lead
ers and"the one, the only, the truly
incomparable Leland Stanford Junior
(pause) University Marching Band."
The band is relegated to the back of
the plane, where I also happen to be
located. The atmosphere is more one of
anticipation than of uninhibited ram
bunctiousness; that is, until the plane is
taxiing and the safety demonstration
begins on the video screens before us.
First, the flight attendant points out
the cards located in the seat backs in
front of us — and all of a sudden I'm in
the middle of a flock of cards held aloft
for the entire cabin to see. Next comes
the location of the exits, which each band
member successfully points out for his or
her neighbor. Then there is the oxygen
mask explanation — this one's tough to
manage, but everybody inflates a "sea
sickness bag" as a reasonable substitute.
Finally, the video instructor is fasten
ing a seat belt in her hands. While I
expect band members to follow suit with
the belts in their laps, the musicians have
other ideas. They fasten their seat belts
in their hands above their heads. I'll have
to try that sometime.

There are Rosens, Rosen
baums, Rosenbergs, Rosen
blatts, Rosenstadts and
Rosensteins. I think for a fleet
ing moment that I am Fletch.

Tuesday, Dec. 29
I can't sleep on planes, so when I
arrive at the Fort Lauderdale Marina
Marriott (the team's hotel, not the
band's) at 9 a.m., I contemplate waking
my friends and family at home at 6 a.m.
their time, but I think better of it and fall
asleep for the better part of the day. Just
another day in paradise.
Wednesday, Dec. 30
I begin to explore the hotel and the
surroundings in the greater Fort Laud
erdale area. There is a joint press confer
ence scheduled at the Convention Center
across the street at 2:15 p.m. for Stan
ford coach Bill Walsh and Penn State
head man Joe Paterno. A couple of Bay
Area fourth estate colleagues and I
arrive at 2 p.m.— only to find Walsh
being whisked into the back of a car and
that Paterno will not be showing up.
There are no outstanding bomb threats
to speak of, so my compatriots lapse into

a natural state of anger at their inexpli
cably denied access. This will be known
henceforth to the rest of the world as
"cynicism."
Thursday, Dec. 31
This is an official "dark day" as far as
the availability of players and coaches
goes, so naturally I am able chat off the
record with several Stanford athletes,
members of the coaching staff and even
Walsh himself. Call it taking care of busi
ness, by hook or crook.
Later in the afternoon, I take a taxi to
a friend's condominium so that I can cel
ebrate New Year's Eve "live" for the first
time in my life. However, while Fort
Lauderdale and New York happen to
share the same time zone, they do not
share cab drivers' union members.
My driver speaks English, and in this
way he has it all over his Big Apple coun
terparts. But he doesn't have the first
clue as to where my destination is locat
ed. It was rush hour, the meter was run
ning, and I was steamed. Somehow, we
made it in just under an hour; I paid him
my respects with a gratuity that wouldn't
tip a chemistry balance and was on my
merry way. You win some, you lose some.
Friday, Jan. 1
Happy New Year. Again, I am close to
calling California and wishing everyone
