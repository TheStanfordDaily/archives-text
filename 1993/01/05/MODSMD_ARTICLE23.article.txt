# Athletes of the Week

If the best athletes are in fact the ones
that can be counted on to come through in
the clutch, then Blockbuster Bowl MVP Dar
rien Gordon and National Champion Bev
Oden — the Daily's first Athletes of the
Week for 1993 — proved they represent the
very best Stanford has to offer.
Gordon, a senior cornerback from
Shawnee, Okla., has come full circle in his

four years in a Cardinal uniform. Recruited
as a wide receiver out of high school, he was
converted into a defensive back during his
sophomore season, and has guarded wide
receivers ever since.
His steady improvement climaxed in his
team's last four games, when he helped shut
down USC's Curtis Conway, Washington
State's Drew Bledsoe, California's Sean
Dawkins and Penn State's O.J. McDuffie.
In the Blockbuster Bowl — his collegiate
finale — Gordon broke up an incredible six
passes, caused several other McDuffie drops
and made seven total tackles in a 24-3 Stan
ford rout. He will look to go pro in April's
NFL draft.

Heading into the 1992 season, Oden, a
senior hitter, had racked up every honor a
collegiate volleyball player could receive
except one — neither she nor the Cardinal
program had ever been part of an NCAA
Championship.
That honor no longer eludes Oden or
her teammates after last month's trip to
Albuquerque, N.M., for the Final Four.
There, Stanford did the unthinkable. Hav
ing lost to UCLA twice in conference play,
the second-ranked Cardinal once again
found itself across the net from the No. 1
Bruins, who were riding a 43-match win
ning streak and whom many observers had
dubbed "the greatest team in collegiate vol
leyball history."

Stanford proved all doubters wrong,
though, as Oden paved the way to an
improbable 15-8, 15-9,6-15, 15-10 upset and
the Cardinal's first national championship.
Oden, whose team will be honored at half
time of tonight's women's basketball game,
was named a first Team All-American for
an unprecedented fourth time by Volleyball
Monthly magazine yesterday.
