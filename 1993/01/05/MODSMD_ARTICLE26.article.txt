PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -
Washington State University
quarterback Drew Bledsoe
announced today that he will opt
for the NFL draft rather than
return to the Cougars next sea
son.
Bledsoe, 20, was projected by
NFL draft guru Mel Kiper to be
the No. 1 pick.
The quarterback had one
year of eligibility remaining.
Bledsoe, who led the
Cougars to a 31-28 victory over
Utah in the Copper Bowl with a
school-record 476 yards passing
last week, has been counseled
by WSU coach Mike Price, and
friends and family around his
hometown of Walla Walla.
The quarterback told a news
conference that he carefully
weighed all his options but
decided the advantages were
greater in making himself eligi
ble for the NFL draft.
New England has the first
pick in the April draft, while

the Seattle Seahawks are sec
ond.
Bledsoe said he thought hard
about staying at WSU and try
ing for new records, but decided
he wanted the challenge of
playing at the next level.
He also said he had confi
dence that backup quarterback
Mike Pattison could help con
tinue last season's winning
ways for the Cougars, who were
9-3.
Bledsoe, 6-foot-5 and 225
pounds, completed 241 passes
in 432 attempts for 3,246 yards
this season â€” all school
records.
He passed for 20 touchdowns
with 15 interceptions.
For his three seasons Bled
soe totaled 7,373 yards.
If he returned to the school
he would be well within reach
of the Pacific-10 Conference
career passing record of 9,393
yards by Oregon State's Erik
Wilhelm.
