# Shuttle users upset over cancellation
## Elimination of parking garage-to-Med Center service angers employees 
### Julie Makinen Editorial staff 
Concerned about their personal security,
employees of Stanford Medical Center who
park in a distant lot are upset that the Univer
sity is discontinuing a shuttle service between
the lot and the center.
More than 160 employees who use the Stock
Farm parking area, located across Welch Road
from the Medical School office building, have
cited the "dark, unsafe conditions one encoun
ters walking late at night and even in the early
hours of dusk" in a petition urging the contin
uance of the shuttle, which operates about 12
hours a day.
"The issue is safety," said Bonnie Ryan-
Lindberg, an administrative assistant in
Surgery who uses the shuttle. "I absolutely

would not feel comfortable walking . . .
There's too many goofy people out there."
According to Mike Stultz, director of securi
ty services for the Medical Center, the shuttle
service was initiated several years ago when
two construction projects — the new patient
parking deck and the Family Practice Program
project on Blake Wilbur Road — took over sev
eral parking areas close to the center, forcing
employees to use the more remote lot.
But with next week's partial opening of
Parking Structure 111, a new parking facility
very close to the Medical Center, approximate
ly 400 employee spaces will be reinstated, and
the shuttle will be eliminated.
"The shuttle is not a regular service," said
Stultz, adding that the shuttle costs about $8,200
a month to operate. The cost was figured in to the
budgets of the two construction projects, but now

that they are nearly complete there is no money
for the shuttle, explained Stultz.
Approximately 70 percent of the 400 new
spaces will be designated "C" spaces, and the
remainder will be "A" spaces, said Stultz. "C"
permits cost $56 annually and are pro-rated
every month. They now cost $42 and the price
will be lowered to $37 on Jan. 24.
But most of the people who park in the Stock
Farm lot have "Z" permits — which cost $5 —
or no permit at all. If they wish to park closer to
the center, they will have to purchase "C" per
mits, said Stultz.
That doesn't sit well with Theresa
Dendinger, a licensed vocational nurse who
works at the Medical Center. "1 had a 'C stick
er," said Dendinger. "But there's usually no
