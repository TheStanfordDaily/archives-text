## University answers new cost rules as deadline approaches 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Proposed revisions to the feder
al indirect-cost regulations are
likely to have a dramatic effect on
Stanford, according to comments
the University has filed with the
government.
If implemented in their current
form, the changes would cost Stan
ford millions of dollars per year and
jeopardize the status of many grad
uate students involved in research.
The proposed new regulations
were published by the Office of
Management and Budget last
month, and universities and other
interested parties have until Fri
day to file comments.
But the government appears
eager to enact the revisions before
President-elect Bill Clinton takes
office Jan. 20 — making it unlike
ly that significant changes will
occur within the 12-day period.
Most of the proposed changes
were published in The Daily in No
vember and were widely known
before they were officially released
by the government, but two signif
icant surprises could cost Stan
ford more than $11 million.
The revision that will have the
biggest effect on the University
and a handful of other schools is
the ending of tuition remission —
the system of government reim
bursement for some of the tuition
of graduate students involved in
federally sponsored research
through indirect costs.
The change would require the
tuition of graduate students to be
charged as the direct cost of a grant
— making post-doctoral students
cheaper to use in research labora
tories than Ph.D. candidates.
Theendingof tuition remission
is supposed to be phased-in over
five years, but it is unclear what
that means for grants secured be
tween now and Oct. 1, 1997.
Although Chief Financial Offi
cer Peter Van Etten said the Uni
versity has not yet finished calcu
lating the impact of the ending of
tuition remission, officials last
year estimated that the change
could cost up to $ 12 million annu
ally and jeopardize the status of 25
percent of graduate students.
Stanford's former Dean of Re
search, Robert Byer, warned last
month that ending tuition remis
sion will "harm research in uni
versities."
"Tuition remission saves the
government money, and it helps
us train graduate students for the
future," Byer said. "Ending it

forces harder choices as to what
we can or cannot be engaged in."
But the ending of tuition remis
sion is not the only revision expect
ed to cost the University money.
In its 12-page official comment,
Stanford also objected to the 26
percent administrative cap, argu
ing that it is "arbitrary and fails to
recognize real cost differences be
tween universities."
"Stanford, like many other in
stitutions, is deeply concerned that
the establishment of caps denies
the fact that there are real and nec
essary costs that support the re
search process that must be paid,"
the comment said. "The cap does
nothing to reduce administrative
requirements and lends itself to
political manipulation for purpos
es of meeting budget targets."
The 26 percent cap — which
was first imposed almost 18 months
ago — has cost the University
between $6 million and $8 million.
The revisions would include
student services as part of the
capped administrative expense
pool, roughly costing Stanford
another $1 million per year.
The government has also set a
threshold of 24 percent, allowing
universities to be reimbursed that
amount with minimal paperwork.
The University fears that the
expense of doing the accounting to
justify the 2 percent increase would
cost more than the difference.
In an unexpected proposal, the
new regulations dictate that
administrative and clerical per
sonnel salaries also be added to
this administrative cost pool.

Under the current system, much
of these expenses are charged to the
direct cost of grants. The changes
would allocate more costs to the
capped administrative pool.
"Because of the 26 percent of
the recovery of administrative
expenses, many universities would
simply be unable to recover these
otherwise allowable costs if the
proposed language is adopted," the
comment said. "Our initial esti
mate of the impact on Stanford
indicates the change would have
resulted in direct charges of over
$11 million in fiscal 1992.
"This proposed change may
have the unintended effect of
imposing on scientists the perfor
mance of necessary administrative
tasks previously performed by
administrative and clerical staff —
an unrealistic outcome that would
severely impact the conduct of
research," the comment concluded.
Van Etten said the University is

also concerned about a potential
"broadening in the way in which
indirect costs are defined that might
force us to include gift funds."

Such a change would drive
Stanford's indirect-cost rate down
even further, he said, although
the University has not yet pre
dicted by how much.
The sum total of these changes
— plus a number of other rela
tively minor alterations — makes
it unlikely that the University's
justified indirect-cost rate would
be "substantially higher" than it
is now, according to Van Etten.
Stanford is currently operating
under a rate of 60.3 percent that
was unilaterally increased by the
government in October from 55.5
percent.
At the time the government
bumped up the University's rate,
Van Etten said the University's
justified cost rate was about 64
percent.
But he acknowledges that the
proposed revisions make it unlike
ly the rate will go much above
what it is now.
