# Stanford not only school to oppose new regulations

### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Stanford is not the only
one objecting to the revisions
to the federal indirect-cost
regulations.
Other universities that
rely on tuition remission are
also sending their comments
to the government, arguing
that the practice should not
be changed.
"MIT is extremely disap
pointed that tuition remis
sion will no longer be permit
ted to be charged as an insti
tution-wide employee bene
fit," wrote Jack Culliton,
MlT's vice president for fi
nancial operations, in a let
ter to the government. "This
change will eliminate sup
port for about 700 MIT grad
uate students per year."
Tuition remission is the
practice of government reim
bursement for some of the
tuition of graduate students
involved in federally spon
sored research.
The change would force
schools to charge the tuition as a
direct cost of a grant and encour
age researchers to shift away
from graduate students to cheap
er post-doctoral students.
Stanford officials have not dis
closed a prediction of the impact
of ending the practice, but in the
past they have warned that it
could cost as much as $12 million
and jeopardize the status of up to
25 percent of the graduate stu
dents.

In an interview yesterday, Cul
lition estimated that MIT would
have to spend "close to $10 mil
lion per year" to continue to sup
port the same number of graduate
students.
Hall Daily, Caltech's director
of government relations and com
munity affairs, said his school had
not yet calculated the full impact
of ending tuition remission, but
said that, at the very least, the
government would in effect lose
the $1 million annually that it
was saving under the system.
"This will certainly destabilize
the ability to manage our current
graduate student population (of
about 1,050)," Daily said. "We

have serious concerns about that."
The problem, however, is that
the change affects too few univer
sities for complaints to make a dif
ference.
Only Stanford, MIT, Caltech
and Columbia continue to use the
practice, and their objections are
likely to be ignored as the govern
ment imposes a uniform account
ing system on all schools.
Unlike Stanford, MIT and Cal
tech are below the 26 percent
administrative cap and would not
be financially affected.
But both universities still
object to the cap, agreeing with
Stanford's argument that it is
arbitrary and fails to account for

real differences in costs.
"Not all universities operate in
the same environment and the
costs of research are not the same
around the country," Culliton
wrote. "The establishment of
thresholds or caps in certain cate
gories of indirect costs denies the
reality of the fact that there are
real costs that must be paid.
"When our ability to recover
these costs is encumbered by
rules which are based on an arbi
trary number, as opposed to good
accounting practice and audits,
our ability to conduct research in
a cost effective manner is
adversely affected," Culliton con
cluded.
