# Stanford not only school to oppose new regulations

### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Stanford is not the only
one objecting to the revisions
to the federal indirect-cost
regulations.
Other universities that
rely on tuition remission are
also sending their comments
to the government, arguing
that the practice should not
be changed.
"MIT is extremely disap
pointed that tuition remis
sion will no longer be permit
ted to be charged as an insti
tution-wide employee bene
fit," wrote Jack Culliton,
MlT's vice president for fi
nancial operations, in a let
ter to the government. "This
change will eliminate sup
port for about 700 MIT grad
uate students per year."
Tuition remission is the
practice of government reim
bursement for some of the
tuition of graduate students
involved in federally spon
sored research.
