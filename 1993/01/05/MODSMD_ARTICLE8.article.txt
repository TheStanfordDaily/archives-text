# Peer harassment widens scope of gender discrimination
## Sexism in casual interactions between students is often not recognized, formally defined 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
"Have you ever had to walk by a group
of males that are just sitting somewhere?"
asked Women's Center Coordinator Re
becca Bliss. "You just kind of want to
shrink away."
For first-year graduate student Bliss, an
all-male gathering alerts her that gratu
itous comments about her appearance may
follow. And these sentiments are shared by
many female students, who consider it part
of their daily lives to encounter sexist com
ments and jokes from male peers.
Until recently such incidents have been
brushed aside and not defined in terms of
sexism.
But with the increased awareness of
sexual assault and sexual harassment, the
term "peer harassment" has entered the
vocabulary of gender-based discrimina
tion. And the next frontier, it seems, is ex
amining those casual interactions in
which harassment can play a more subtle
role.
Peer harassment — which can include
sexist jokes, derogatory remarks and ap
pearance-based comments — typically oc
curs between students in social situations
and differs from "sexual harassment,"
which is usually inflicted from a position of
authority in an office or classroom environ
ment, according to Assoc. Dean of Memori
al Church Diana Akiyama.
Women often do recognize what makes
them feel uncomfortable, but they do not
have the terms with which they can define
these feelings, said Akiyama, who defined
peer harassment as "the manifestations
amongst peers of sexism and assumptions
of inferiority."
"Do women have the power to confront
something?" Akiyama asked. "The materi

al is out there, but there is no language to
start a dialogue."
'Compliments' and sexuality
One of the most readily identifiable
forms of peer harassment, according to
Bliss, is comments directed at a woman's
appearance, particularly those that single
out a particular body part.
But while such comments are more eas
ily recognized, they aren't easy to confront.
Bliss recalled an incident in which a
woman found a message addressed to her on
her dorm room door that read, "Nice ass!"
"She told her (male) neighbors, and they
said, 'Hey, that's great, that's a compli
ment!' " she said.
The woman, however, did not view the
comment as complimentary. But the dis
tinction between compliments and offen
sive remarks is ambiguous because the in
terpretations of the source and receiver
oflen differ.
"Sharon," a junior, said an intended
compliment becomes a sexist remark when
men "pick out or objectify a single body
part," therefore "segmenting a woman."
"When something is being perceived as
an object or an object on a person it changes
from being a compliment," Sharon said.
"Mike," a senior, said while men do
"compliment in a sexual manner a lot of
the time," sincere compliments are often
misconstrued.
"I usually try to say something like, T
really like t hat sweater' or 1 like your hair,
your eyes,' instead of, 'I think you look hot
today because you're exposing your body,'
to make sure it doesn't get interpreted that
way," Mike said
Perceptions of women's sexuality also
play into the issue, Bliss pointed out. "Soci
ety accepts that if a woman walks some
where with a halter top or a tifjht shirt, she's

going to get judged, whereas men can lounge
around without their shirts and that's fine."
"Laura," a sophomore, said society
treats men's bodies "more matter-of-fact
ly" than women's bodies. "Women are sup
posed to be sexual, but we're not allowed to
express that ourselves. We have to let oth
ers perceive it," she said.
"Jeff," a junior, said offensive com
ments are usually not intended to oppress,
but agreed that they are rooted in societal
influences that encourage men to be ag
gressive and women to be passive.
"Men might think of (making com
ments) as a way of flirting," Jeff said. "It
comes out of a pattern in which women are
supposed to be objects designs! for beauty
for men to look at, and men feel like they
can comment."
Just joking?
Bevond the usually fleeting interactions

in which derogatory comments directed at a
woman's appearance are often made, peer
harassment also infiltrates into conversa
tions in the form of gender-based jokes.
Again, the problems seem to stem from
differing interpretations. Many women
pointed out that gender-based jokes viewed
by men as funny or innocuous are irritat
ing at best and offensive at worst.
Laura said she isn't phased by "occa
sional jokes from guy friends when (they 1
don't mean it." However, she said her
freshman year became a story of one
"blonde joke" too many.
"At the beginning, it was really cute, but
by the end of the year I was so sick of them
1 would take the head off of anyone who
even mentioned dumb blonde.' " she said.
Akiyama said that while no one likes
to "throw a wet blanket" over friendly
