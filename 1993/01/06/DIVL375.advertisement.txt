NEW COURSE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF
GERMAN STUDIES
GERMAN 165
CRITIQUE OF ENLIGHTENMENT
TTH 6:30-7:45 â€” 251 L
Though German culture is frequently thought of as
obsessed with punctuality and technical efficiency, these
characteristics have often been matched hy a profound
skepticism concerning the possibility of meaningful
progress and the ultimate beneficence of social
enlightenment. This course will review in detail the
writings of several of the most important German critics
of progress, including Kant, Herder, Schiller, Marx,
Nietzsche, Freud, Auerbach, Gehlen and Marcuse.
