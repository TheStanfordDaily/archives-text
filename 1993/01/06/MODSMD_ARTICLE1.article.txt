# Going beyond the physical
## Students face social stigmas 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
When coterminal student
Mark Breimhorst visited a fresh
man dorm with the Disability
Speakers Bureau last quarter, one
student asked him to demonstrate
how he writes.
Breimhorst, who does not have
hands, told the student he would
demonstrate after the program,
hoping to direct the discussion
away from the physical aspects and
towards social issues of disability.
At the end of the program —
which addressed issues of identity
and discrimination for disabled stu
dents — Breimhorst asked mem
bers of the audience to stay if they
were interested in seeing him write.
The student who had initially
asked the question approached him
and said, "No, it's OK. I realized it's
not really important anymore."
"That was really cool,"
Breimhorst said, explaining that
the student had begun the process
of looking beyond the physical as
pects of disability and addressing
the social struggles.
For Breimhorst and many of
the other 150 self-identified dis
abled students at Stanford, the
challenges of facing social stigmas
far outweigh those of coping with
the physical world. Many disabled
students say those mispercep
tions are caused by other peoples'
assumptions about disability,
which are usually fixated on phys
ical limitations.

years. Anyone who's been without hands
for that long would be just as adept as I
am," he said. "You don't overcome your
disability. You overcome people's atti
tudes, prejudice and the stigma."
And while the recently enacted Ameri
cans with Disabilities Act sparked campus
debate about the accessibility of Universi
ty residences and brought issues of equali
ty to the forefront, many disabled stu
dents say the current changes have only
addressed the physical aspects of disabili
ty. They contend there are complex social
barriers related to disability that are as
daunting as physical ones, and more diffi
cult to resolve.
4 My life is not tragic'
One of the most common misguided
assumptions that non-disabled people
make about people with disabilities is that
their life is a void because of what they
cannot do.
Many disabled people find themselves
in a no-win situation: They are often per
ceived as either useless and incapable of
managing their own lives, or amazing
because they lead an active life despite
their disabilities.
Adriana recalled when she acquired her
disability — she was injured in a gymnas
tics accident — there seemed to be an
assumption that she would "sit at home
and feel sorry" for herself.
"When I had my accident, a friend of
the family . .. talked to my mom and sug
gested, 'Have her do ceramics,' " Duffy
said. "I was like, 'I don't want to do ceram
ics. I think I'll go back to school and just do
what I've been doing.' "
Duffy said sometimes when she tells
people how she acquired her disability,
they respond, "Oh, that's tragic." While
these people are "so well-intentioned,"
Duffy said "it kind of hurts" because they
indirectly imply that her life is tragic.
"I think I'm fine. Disability is so much
of the person that I am," she said, explain
ing that when she acquired her disability
she became a part of an entire culture and
community to which she would not have
otherwise been exposed.
Fearing disability
Because of the perceptions of disability
as tragic and debilitating, disabled com
munity members feel that others' fear of
becoming disabled is projected onto them.
Although comparisons are often made
between people with disabilities and eth
nic groups, labeling both as stigmatized
minorities, one unique characteristic of
the disabled community is that anyone
can become part of it.
"I don't think many people fear becom
ing Asian or black because it's not going to
happen," said Disability Resource Center
program coordinator-John Asheim, who has
a visual disability. "But people fear that it's
so easy to become 'useless and invalid.' "
Paul Longmore, a visiting assistant
professor in the History Department, said
the fear people have of "suddenly becom
ing the person that they were always
taught to despise" often translates to
avoidance.
"They say, 'That could be me. That
could happen to me, so what do I do? I'm
going to stay away from them. Out of
sight, out of mind.... I don't want them
near because they terrify me,' " said Long
more, whose disability is a result of polio.
However, second-year law student

Teddy Chen said although fear factors
into perceptions of disability, the fear is
not necessarily of becoming disabled, but
of people who look and act differently.
Lack of interaction with disabled people
compounds the fear, said Chen, who is
deaf. "People I've met have come up to me
and said, 'You're the first disabled person
I've ever known.' "
Members of the disabled community
say misguided perceptions often lead to
either gratuitous and insulting offers of
help, or being completely disregarded.
Asheim said people often make
assumptions about his visual disability
without asking him. "I do not need some
one to lead me around, but they offer me
their arm immediately," he said. "I feel
like taking their arm and dancing
around."
On the other hand, first-year law stu
dent Jo Brooks said because many people
are ill at ease around wheelchair users,
they often ignore her when she does need

assistance.
"When I'm struggling to open the door,
I have had people actually go around me
and reach for another door beside me," she
said.
When people ignore either her or her
wheelchair, Brooks said she feels they are
implying that she is sub-human.
"They deny my existence because they
are uncomfortable," she fcaid. "But ndbody
likes to be ignored." • --** • -*• -*•
Asheim acknowledged that such situa
tions are difficult because every disabled
person is an individual and will react dif
ferently to offers of assistance.
However, he said, the key is allowing
the disabled person the dignity of having
control of the situation.
Brooks said, "If they would just ask:
'Do you want me to open the door for you?'
At least they've given me the respect of
allowing me to make the choice."
She added that one issue that is rarely
addressed but important to wheelchair
users is the recognition of the wheelchair
as "personal body space."

People often touch, bump or push
wheelchairs without asking, Brooks said.
"You wouldn't do that to someone's
body."
A sense of ownership
Mistreatment of disabled people, Long
more argues, stems from a societal percep
tion that people with disabilities are public
property.
Media events such as telethons have
perpetuated the myth that non-disabled
people have some sort of ownership over
disabled people because disabled people
are dependent, he said.
For example, when disabled people are
in a restaurant with a companion, waiters
will often ask the companion, 'What does
he want?' as if the disabled person was not
capable of making that decision, he said.
It is also not an uncommon experience
for a disabled person to be asked extreme
ly private or insulting questions by com
plete strangers.
Breimhorst said since he is immersed in
the disability community at Stanford,
such questions are often a rude awakening
for him.
"Sometimes I'm so used to being
around people who see disability in much
the same way that I see it — not limiting,
incapable nor dependent — that I'll even
forget sometimes that I don't have fin
gers," he said. "I'll be thinking, 'How the
hell did you do that so fast?' and then I
realize, 'Oh, you have fingers. You can
move with 10 different digits.' "
However, Breimhorst said when he is
treated in a degrading way, it is "a totally
different reality."
Breimhorst recalled being asked by a
total stranger about his bathroom habits:
"He wanted to know how I wipe my butt. I
don't know how guys with hands wipe
their butts. I don't really care that much."
While he acknowledged that the person
might have been just curious or trying to
be humorous, he felt the question was
unnecessary and "an intrusion of privacy."
Breimhorst said he usually answers
such questions "just so people can get it
out of their heads."
Body image and self-esteem
While many people find themselves
being pressured by society to measure up to
near-impossible standards of beauty, peo
ple with disabilities must face the deeper
implications of "deformity" as an anti-ideal.
Longmore said society judges people on
a scale that places athletes, models and
actors at one end, and people with disabil
ities at the opposite.
Because people with disabilities are
constantly being bombarded with mes
sages that not only their disabilities make
them ugly, but also that disabilities "are
ruinous of personhood and spoil a person's
identity," Longmore said w an awful lot of
people with disabilities fed a deep sense of
shame."
And often disabled people are the ones
who believe the negative images and
stereotypes the most strongly. Their own
sense of fear and even hatred of disability
— or rather, the perceived negative impli
cations of disability — can run deeper than
in non-disabled people.
Breimhorst said that while disability
has formed many positive aspects of his
character — such as patience, sensitivity
and creativity — he "is not isolated from
society" and holds "certain values that the
people looking at [him] do."
"I think I'm beautiful and I think I'm

ugly at the same time," he said.
Breimhorst recalled when he was 10,
the fear and loathing of disability that soci
ety had ingrained in him manifested itself
when he wanted to hurt a disabled peer.
"He was so ugly and so disgusting," he
said. "I've lived my whole life as a disabled
person. I know where that anger comes
from.
"Obviously a lot of it we internalize. ...
it's very disturbing," Breimhorst contin
ued. "I was uncomfortable with the way I
looked, and therefore I thought I was
strange. I wanted to lash out at someone
who I thought was strange. It was all
against myself."
Dating and social implications
Disability has a major impact on
almost every aspect of students' social
lives, from the actual situations in which
they meet people to forming romantic
relationships.
Duffy said acquiring her disability com
pletely changed the logistics of her social
life — "going out to parties, that kind of
stuff."
She said while her closest friends all
remained the same, she made friends
within the disabled community she proba
bly wouldn't have otherwise.
Senior Carolee Reiling, who has a
learning disability, said that because her
disability is invisible, there is always the
question of disclosure when she meets
people.
"When I'm at a fraternity party people
have no clue," she said on a KZSU "Talk
back" show last quarter. "But if I were
dating someone I'd tell them up-front. ...
If they couldn't deal with it I'd rather
know just know right away and get rid of
them."
Breimhorst said the de-sexualization of
disabled people is so common that it "has
become a kind of running joke among a lot
of disabled men."
He said he feels his disability somehow
becomes an obstacle in many potential
relationships. "My hands, for some rea
son, send a signal to a lot of women that no
matter how attracted they are to me, that
we are going to be friends," he said.
"All of the male role models or sex gods
all have hands. No matter how hard I try
I'm not going to have hands — I've long
since given up," Breimhorst said on the
"Talkback" show. "So I have to be com
fortable with the body I have, which is not
the body women fantasize about."
The self-esteem issue is also an obstacle
in dating. Breimhorst said he could not
fully accept the concept that someone
could be attracted to him until recently,
simply because he "did not feel worthy" of
being attractive or loved.
The question of whether to date anoth
er disabled person is also an but
opinions vary among community mem
bers: 'A AfiAjLAW I
Breimhorst said he once thought he
could only date a disabled person because
a non-disabled person would not under
stand his experience.
Asheim, on the other hand, once held
the opposite perspective. At one point in
his life, he decided he would not date a dis
abled person because he did not want to
further associate himself with the stigma.
But now, both say they have since
revised their thinking, explaining they are
less concerned if their dates are disabled
and more interested in how receptive a
person is to trying to understand their dis
ability experience.

their arm immediately," he said. "I feel
like taking their arm and dancing
around."
On the other hand, first-year law stu
dent Jo Brooks said because many people
are ill at ease around wheelchair users,
they often ignore her when she does need

assistance.
"When I'm struggling to open the door,
I have had people actually go around me
and reach for another door beside me," she
said.
When people ignore either her or her
wheelchair, Brooks said she feels they are
implying that she is sub-human.
"They deny my existence because they
are uncomfortable," she fcaid. "But ndbody
likes to be ignored." • --** • -*• -*•
Asheim acknowledged that such situa
tions are difficult because every disabled
person is an individual and will react dif
ferently to offers of assistance.
However, he said, the key is allowing
the disabled person the dignity of having
control of the situation.
Brooks said, "If they would just ask:
'Do you want me to open the door for you?'
At least they've given me the respect of
allowing me to make the choice."
She added that one issue that is rarely
addressed but important to wheelchair
users is the recognition of the wheelchair
as "personal body space."

People often touch, bump or push
wheelchairs without asking, Brooks said.
"You wouldn't do that to someone's
body."
A sense of ownership
Mistreatment of disabled people, Long
more argues, stems from a societal percep
tion that people with disabilities are public
property.
Media events such as telethons have
perpetuated the myth that non-disabled
people have some sort of ownership over
disabled people because disabled people
are dependent, he said.
For example, when disabled people are
in a restaurant with a companion, waiters
will often ask the companion, 'What does
he want?' as if the disabled person was not
capable of making that decision, he said.
It is also not an uncommon experience
for a disabled person to be asked extreme
ly private or insulting questions by com
plete strangers.
Breimhorst said since he is immersed in
the disability community at Stanford,
such questions are often a rude awakening
for him.
"Sometimes I'm so used to being
around people who see disability in much
the same way that I see it — not limiting,
incapable nor dependent — that I'll even
forget sometimes that I don't have fin
gers," he said. "I'll be thinking, 'How the
hell did you do that so fast?' and then I
realize, 'Oh, you have fingers. You can
move with 10 different digits.' "
However, Breimhorst said when he is
treated in a degrading way, it is "a totally
different reality."
Breimhorst recalled being asked by a
total stranger about his bathroom habits:
"He wanted to know how I wipe my butt. I
don't know how guys with hands wipe
their butts. I don't really care that much."
While he acknowledged that the person
might have been just curious or trying to
be humorous, he felt the question was
unnecessary and "an intrusion of privacy."
Breimhorst said he usually answers
such questions "just so people can get it
out of their heads."
Body image and self-esteem
While many people find themselves
being pressured by society to measure up to
near-impossible standards of beauty, peo
ple with disabilities must face the deeper
implications of "deformity" as an anti-ideal.
Longmore said society judges people on
a scale that places athletes, models and
actors at one end, and people with disabil
ities at the opposite.
Because people with disabilities are
constantly being bombarded with mes
sages that not only their disabilities make
them ugly, but also that disabilities "are
ruinous of personhood and spoil a person's
identity," Longmore said w an awful lot of
people with disabilities fed a deep sense of
shame."
And often disabled people are the ones
who believe the negative images and
stereotypes the most strongly. Their own
sense of fear and even hatred of disability
— or rather, the perceived negative impli
cations of disability — can run deeper than
in non-disabled people.
Breimhorst said that while disability
has formed many positive aspects of his
character — such as patience, sensitivity
and creativity — he "is not isolated from
society" and holds "certain values that the
people looking at [him] do."
"I think I'm beautiful and I think I'm

ugly at the same time," he said.
Breimhorst recalled when he was 10,
the fear and loathing of disability that soci
ety had ingrained in him manifested itself
when he wanted to hurt a disabled peer.
"He was so ugly and so disgusting," he
said. "I've lived my whole life as a disabled
person. I know where that anger comes
from.
"Obviously a lot of it we internalize. ...
it's very disturbing," Breimhorst contin
ued. "I was uncomfortable with the way I
looked, and therefore I thought I was
strange. I wanted to lash out at someone
who I thought was strange. It was all
against myself."
Dating and social implications
Disability has a major impact on
almost every aspect of students' social
lives, from the actual situations in which
they meet people to forming romantic
relationships.
Duffy said acquiring her disability com
pletely changed the logistics of her social
life — "going out to parties, that kind of
stuff."
She said while her closest friends all
remained the same, she made friends
within the disabled community she proba
bly wouldn't have otherwise.
Senior Carolee Reiling, who has a
learning disability, said that because her
disability is invisible, there is always the
question of disclosure when she meets
people.
"When I'm at a fraternity party people
have no clue," she said on a KZSU "Talk
back" show last quarter. "But if I were
dating someone I'd tell them up-front. ...
If they couldn't deal with it I'd rather
know just know right away and get rid of
them."
Breimhorst said the de-sexualization of
disabled people is so common that it "has
become a kind of running joke among a lot
of disabled men."
He said he feels his disability somehow
becomes an obstacle in many potential
relationships. "My hands, for some rea
son, send a signal to a lot of women that no
matter how attracted they are to me, that
we are going to be friends," he said.
"All of the male role models or sex gods
all have hands. No matter how hard I try
I'm not going to have hands — I've long
since given up," Breimhorst said on the
"Talkback" show. "So I have to be com
fortable with the body I have, which is not
the body women fantasize about."
The self-esteem issue is also an obstacle
in dating. Breimhorst said he could not
fully accept the concept that someone
could be attracted to him until recently,
simply because he "did not feel worthy" of
being attractive or loved.
The question of whether to date anoth
er disabled person is also an but
opinions vary among community mem
bers: 'A AfiAjLAW I
Breimhorst said he once thought he
could only date a disabled person because
a non-disabled person would not under
stand his experience.
Asheim, on the other hand, once held
the opposite perspective. At one point in
his life, he decided he would not date a dis
abled person because he did not want to
further associate himself with the stigma.
But now, both say they have since
revised their thinking, explaining they are
less concerned if their dates are disabled
and more interested in how receptive a
person is to trying to understand their dis
ability experience.


Victor Cheng — Daily
Disability Resource Center program coordinator John Asheim says people often
make assumptions about his visual disability. "I do not need someone to lead me
around, but they offer me their arm immediately," he says."I feel like taking their
arm and dancing around."
When coterminal student
Mark Breimhorst visited a fresh
man dorm with the Disability
Speakers Bureau last quarter, one
student asked him to demonstrate
how he writes.
Breimhorst, who does not have
hands, told the student he would
demonstrate after the program,
hoping to direct the discussion
away from the physical aspects and
towards social issues of disability.
At the end of the program —
which addressed issues of identity
and discrimination for disabled stu
dents — Breimhorst asked mem
bers of the audience to stay if they
were interested in seeing him write.
The student who had initially
asked the question approached him
and said, "No, it's OK. I realized it's
not really important anymore."
"That was really cool,"
Breimhorst said, explaining that
the student had begun the process
of looking beyond the physical as
pects of disability and addressing
the social struggles.
For Breimhorst and many of
the other 150 self-identified dis
abled students at Stanford, the
challenges of facing social stigmas
far outweigh those of coping with
the physical world. Many disabled
students say those mispercep
tions are caused by other peoples'
assumptions about disability,
which are usually fixated on phys
ical limitations.

for that long would be just as adept as I
am," he said. "You don't overcome your
disability. You overcome people's atti

And while the recently enacted Ameri
cans with Disabilities Act sparked campus
debate about the accessibility of Universi
ty residences and brought issues of equali
ty to the forefront, many disabled stu
dents say the current changes have only
addressed the physical aspects of disabili
ty. They contend there are complex social
barriers related to disability that are as
daunting as physical ones, and more diffi
cult to resolve.
4 My life is not tragic'
One of the most common misguided
assumptions that non-disabled people
make about people with disabilities is that
their life is a void because of what they
cannot do.
Many disabled people find themselves
in a no-win situation: They are often per
ceived as either useless and incapable of
managing their own lives, or amazing
because they lead an active life despite
their disabilities.
Adriana recalled when she acquired her
disability — she was injured in a gymnas
tics accident — there seemed to be an
assumption that she would "sit at home
and feel sorry" for herself.
"When I had my accident, a friend of
the family . .. talked to my mom and sug
gested, 'Have her do ceramics,' " Duffy
said. "I was like, 'I don't want to do ceram
ics. I think I'll go back to school and just do
what I've been doing.' "
Duffy said sometimes when she tells
people how she acquired her disability,
they respond, "Oh, that's tragic." While
these people are "so well-intentioned,"
Duffy said "it kind of hurts" because they
indirectly imply that her life is tragic.
"I think I'm fine. Disability is so much
of the person that I am," she said, explain
ing that when she acquired her disability
she became a part of an entire culture and
community to which she would not have
otherwise been exposed.
Fearing disability
Because of the perceptions of disability
as tragic and debilitating, disabled com
munity members feel that others' fear of
becoming disabled is projected onto them.
Although comparisons are often made
between people with disabilities and eth
nic groups, labeling both as stigmatized
minorities, one unique characteristic of
the disabled community is that anyone
can become part of it.
"I don't think many people fear becom
ing Asian or black because it's not going to
happen," said Disability Resource Center
program coordinator-John Asheim, who has
a visual disability. "But people fear that it's
so easy to become 'useless and invalid.' "
Paul Longmore, a visiting assistant
professor in the History Department, said
the fear people have of "suddenly becom
ing the person that they were always
taught to despise" often translates to
avoidance.
"They say, 'That could be me. That
could happen to me, so what do I do? I'm
going to stay away from them. Out of
sight, out of mind.... I don't want them
near because they terrify me,' " said Long
more, whose disability is a result of polio.
However, second-year law student

Teddy Chen said although fear factors
into perceptions of disability, the fear is
not necessarily of becoming disabled, but
of people who look and act differently.
Lack of interaction with disabled people
compounds the fear, said Chen, who is
deaf. "People I've met have come up to me
and said, 'You're the first disabled person
I've ever known.' "
Members of the disabled community
say misguided perceptions often lead to
either gratuitous and insulting offers of
help, or being completely disregarded.
Asheim said people often make
assumptions about his visual disability
without asking him. "I do not need some
one to lead me around, but they offer me
their arm immediately," he said. "I feel
like taking their arm and dancing
around."
On the other hand, first-year law stu
dent Jo Brooks said because many people
are ill at ease around wheelchair users,
they often ignore her when she does need

assistance.
"When I'm struggling to open the door,
I have had people actually go around me
and reach for another door beside me," she
said.

wheelchair, Brooks said she feels they are
implying that she is sub-human.

She said while her closest friends all
remained the same, she made friends
within the disabled community she proba

Senior Carolee Reiling, who has a
learning disability, said that because her
disability is invisible, there is always the
question of disclosure when she meets
people.
"When I'm at a fraternity party people
have no clue," she said on a KZSU "Talk
back" show last quarter. "But if I were
dating someone I'd tell them up-front. ...
If they couldn't deal with it I'd rather
know just know right away and get rid of
them."
Breimhorst said the de-sexualization of
disabled people is so common that it "has
become a kind of running joke among a lot
of disabled men."
He said he feels his disability somehow
becomes an obstacle in many potential
relationships. "My hands, for some rea
son, send a signal to a lot of women that no
matter how attracted they are to me, that
we are going to be friends," he said.
"All of the male role models or sex gods
all have hands. No matter how hard I try
I'm not going to have hands — I've long
since given up," Breimhorst said on the
"Talkback" show. "So I have to be com
fortable with the body I have, which is not
the body women fantasize about."
The self-esteem issue is also an obstacle
in dating. Breimhorst said he could not
fully accept the concept that someone
could be attracted to him until recently,
simply because he "did not feel worthy" of
being attractive or loved.

Breimhorst said he once thought he
could only date a disabled person because
a non-disabled person would not under
stand his experience.
Asheim, on the other hand, once held
the opposite perspective. At one point in
his life, he decided he would not date a dis
abled person because he did not want to
further associate himself with the stigma.
But now, both say they have since
revised their thinking, explaining they are
less concerned if their dates are disabled
and more interested in how receptive a
person is to trying to understand their dis

When coterminal student
Mark Breimhorst visited a fresh
man dorm with the Disability
Speakers Bureau last quarter, one
student asked him to demonstrate
how he writes.
Breimhorst, who does not have
hands, told the student he would
demonstrate after the program,
hoping to direct the discussion
away from the physical aspects and
towards social issues of disability.
At the end of the program —
which addressed issues of identity
and discrimination for disabled stu
dents — Breimhorst asked mem
bers of the audience to stay if they
were interested in seeing him write.
The student who had initially
asked the question approached him
and said, "No, it's OK. I realized it's
not really important anymore."
"That was really cool,"
Breimhorst said, explaining that
the student had begun the process
of looking beyond the physical as
pects of disability and addressing
the social struggles.
For Breimhorst and many of
the other 150 self-identified dis
abled students at Stanford, the
challenges of facing social stigmas
far outweigh those of coping with
the physical world. Many disabled
students say those mispercep
tions are caused by other peoples'
assumptions about disability,
which are usually fixated on phys
ical limitations.

debate about the accessibility of Universi

barriers related to disability that are as
daunting as physical ones, and more diffi
cult to resolve.
4 My life is not tragic'
One of the most common misguided
assumptions that non-disabled people
make about people with disabilities is that
their life is a void because of what they
cannot do.
Many disabled people find themselves
in a no-win situation: They are often per
ceived as either useless and incapable of
managing their own lives, or amazing
because they lead an active life despite
their disabilities.
Adriana recalled when she acquired her
disability — she was injured in a gymnas
tics accident — there seemed to be an
assumption that she would "sit at home
and feel sorry" for herself.
"When I had my accident, a friend of
the family . .. talked to my mom and sug
gested, 'Have her do ceramics,' " Duffy
said. "I was like, 'I don't want to do ceram
ics. I think I'll go back to school and just do
what I've been doing.' "
Duffy said sometimes when she tells
people how she acquired her disability,
they respond, "Oh, that's tragic." While
these people are "so well-intentioned,"
Duffy said "it kind of hurts" because they
indirectly imply that her life is tragic.
"I think I'm fine. Disability is so much
of the person that I am," she said, explain
ing that when she acquired her disability
she became a part of an entire culture and
community to which she would not have
otherwise been exposed.
Fearing disability
Because of the perceptions of disability
as tragic and debilitating, disabled com
munity members feel that others' fear of
becoming disabled is projected onto them.
Although comparisons are often made
between people with disabilities and eth
nic groups, labeling both as stigmatized
minorities, one unique characteristic of
the disabled community is that anyone
can become part of it.
"I don't think many people fear becom
ing Asian or black because it's not going to
happen," said Disability Resource Center
program coordinator-John Asheim, who has
a visual disability. "But people fear that it's
so easy to become 'useless and invalid.' "
Paul Longmore, a visiting assistant
professor in the History Department, said
the fear people have of "suddenly becom
ing the person that they were always
taught to despise" often translates to
avoidance.
"They say, 'That could be me. That
could happen to me, so what do I do? I'm
going to stay away from them. Out of
sight, out of mind.... I don't want them
near because they terrify me,' " said Long
more, whose disability is a result of polio.
However, second-year law student

Teddy Chen said although fear factors
into perceptions of disability, the fear is
not necessarily of becoming disabled, but
of people who look and act differently.
Lack of interaction with disabled people
compounds the fear, said Chen, who is
deaf. "People I've met have come up to me
and said, 'You're the first disabled person
I've ever known.' "
Members of the disabled community
say misguided perceptions often lead to
either gratuitous and insulting offers of
help, or being completely disregarded.
Asheim said people often make
assumptions about his visual disability
without asking him. "I do not need some
one to lead me around, but they offer me
their arm immediately," he said. "I feel
like taking their arm and dancing
around."
On the other hand, first-year law stu
dent Jo Brooks said because many people
are ill at ease around wheelchair users,
they often ignore her when she does need

assistance.
"When I'm struggling to open the door,
I have had people actually go around me
and reach for another door beside me," she
said.
When people ignore either her or her
wheelchair, Brooks said she feels they are
implying that she is sub-human.
"They deny my existence because they
are uncomfortable," she fcaid. "But ndbody
likes to be ignored." • --** • -*• -*•
Asheim acknowledged that such situa
tions are difficult because every disabled
person is an individual and will react dif
ferently to offers of assistance.
However, he said, the key is allowing
the disabled person the dignity of having
control of the situation.
Brooks said, "If they would just ask:
'Do you want me to open the door for you?'
At least they've given me the respect of
allowing me to make the choice."
She added that one issue that is rarely
addressed but important to wheelchair
users is the recognition of the wheelchair
as "personal body space."

People often touch, bump or push
wheelchairs without asking, Brooks said.
"You wouldn't do that to someone's
body."
A sense of ownership
Mistreatment of disabled people, Long
more argues, stems from a societal percep
tion that people with disabilities are public
property.
Media events such as telethons have
perpetuated the myth that non-disabled
people have some sort of ownership over
disabled people because disabled people
are dependent, he said.
For example, when disabled people are
in a restaurant with a companion, waiters
will often ask the companion, 'What does
he want?' as if the disabled person was not
capable of making that decision, he said.
It is also not an uncommon experience
for a disabled person to be asked extreme
ly private or insulting questions by com
plete strangers.
Breimhorst said since he is immersed in
the disability community at Stanford,
such questions are often a rude awakening
for him.
"Sometimes I'm so used to being
around people who see disability in much
the same way that I see it — not limiting,
incapable nor dependent — that I'll even
forget sometimes that I don't have fin
gers," he said. "I'll be thinking, 'How the
hell did you do that so fast?' and then I
realize, 'Oh, you have fingers. You can
move with 10 different digits.' "
However, Breimhorst said when he is
treated in a degrading way, it is "a totally
different reality."
Breimhorst recalled being asked by a
total stranger about his bathroom habits:
"He wanted to know how I wipe my butt. I
don't know how guys with hands wipe
their butts. I don't really care that much."
While he acknowledged that the person
might have been just curious or trying to
be humorous, he felt the question was
unnecessary and "an intrusion of privacy."
Breimhorst said he usually answers
such questions "just so people can get it
out of their heads."
Body image and self-esteem
While many people find themselves
being pressured by society to measure up to
near-impossible standards of beauty, peo
ple with disabilities must face the deeper
implications of "deformity" as an anti-ideal.
Longmore said society judges people on
a scale that places athletes, models and
actors at one end, and people with disabil
ities at the opposite.
Because people with disabilities are
constantly being bombarded with mes
sages that not only their disabilities make
them ugly, but also that disabilities "are
ruinous of personhood and spoil a person's
identity," Longmore said w an awful lot of
people with disabilities fed a deep sense of
shame."
And often disabled people are the ones
who believe the negative images and
stereotypes the most strongly. Their own
sense of fear and even hatred of disability
— or rather, the perceived negative impli
cations of disability — can run deeper than
in non-disabled people.
Breimhorst said that while disability
has formed many positive aspects of his
character — such as patience, sensitivity
and creativity — he "is not isolated from
society" and holds "certain values that the
people looking at [him] do."
"I think I'm beautiful and I think I'm

ugly at the same time," he said.
Breimhorst recalled when he was 10,
the fear and loathing of disability that soci
ety had ingrained in him manifested itself
when he wanted to hurt a disabled peer.
"He was so ugly and so disgusting," he
said. "I've lived my whole life as a disabled
person. I know where that anger comes
from.
"Obviously a lot of it we internalize. ...
it's very disturbing," Breimhorst contin
ued. "I was uncomfortable with the way I
looked, and therefore I thought I was
strange. I wanted to lash out at someone
who I thought was strange. It was all
against myself."
Dating and social implications
Disability has a major impact on
almost every aspect of students' social
lives, from the actual situations in which
they meet people to forming romantic
relationships.
Duffy said acquiring her disability com
pletely changed the logistics of her social
life — "going out to parties, that kind of
stuff."
She said while her closest friends all
remained the same, she made friends
within the disabled community she proba
bly wouldn't have otherwise.
