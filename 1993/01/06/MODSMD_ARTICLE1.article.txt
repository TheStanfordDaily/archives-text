Mark Breimhorst visited a fresh
man dorm with the Disability
Speakers Bureau last quarter, one
student asked him to demonstrate
how he writes.
Breimhorst, who does not have

demonstrate after the program,
hoping to direct the discussion
away from the physical aspects and
towards social issues of disability.
At the end of the program —
which addressed issues of identity
and discrimination for disabled stu

not really important anymore."
"That was really cool,"
Breimhorst said, explaining that
the student had begun the process
of looking beyond the physical as
pects of disability and addressing
the social struggles.

the other 150 self-identified dis

challenges of facing social stigmas
far outweigh those of coping with

students say those mispercep

which are usually fixated on phys
