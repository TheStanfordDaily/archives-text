HUD officials found guilty
WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal jury yester
day found a one-time top aide to former Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierce
and two other men guilty of offering gratuities to
HUD officials.
But the ju rors acquitted Lance Wilson, who was
Pierce's executive assistant in the early 1980s;
Texas developer Leonard E. Briscoe; and Maurice
David Steier, an Omaha, Neb., lawyer, of more seri
ous bribery, mail fraud and conspiracy charges.
The jury delivered the verdicts after eight days
of deliberation following 12 weeks of courtroom
testimony and arguments in the first trial to come
out of the HUD influence-peddling scandal during
the Reagan administration.
All three defendants said they would appeal.
Russia reinstates price controls
MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's new prime minis
ter has reimposed price controls on many basic
foodstuffs, news agencies reported yesterday. The
move apparently reverses one of the cornerstones
of his predecessor's free-market reforms.
The action was taken to "curtail inflation and
unjustified price increases on major products,
goods and services," according to the decree
signed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
According to ITAR-Tass, the government
decree that took effect Jan. 1 expanded controls
on producers of basic foodstuffs, first introduced
by the Gaidar government.
The government will "regulate" prices of

bread, macaroni, tea, salt, sugar, milk, meat, but
ter, sausage, baby food and vodka, it said.
Oil spill near Shetland Islands
ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) — Howling winds
and crashing seas slammed a tanker onto the
rocky coast of the Shetland Islands yesterday and
frustrated efforts to contain oil spilling into
waters teeming with sea and bird life.
The spill threatened to become one of the worst
ever. The nearly 25 million gallons of oil on the
tanker was more than double the amount of crude
that the Exxon Valdez disaster dumped into
Alaskan waters.
The Department of Transport said it expected
all of the oil on board to be spilled. But officials
said the light crude oil would help minimize the
environmental damage.
Primitive dinosaur discovered
WASHINGTON (AP) — Scientists said yester
day they had moved a step closer to identifying
the common ancestor of all dinosaurs with the
discovery of a dog-sized meat-eater in the barren
foothills of the Andes.
"This may be as close as we ever come to that
common ancestor," said University of Chicago pale
ontologist Paul Sereno.
He said the two-legged carnivore, measuring
only 40 inches from its nose to the tip of its tail, is
structurally the most primitive dinosaur ever dis
covered, and dates back to the beginnings of the
dinosaur age 225 million years ago.
