### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Pentagon has informed Congress
of the proposed sale of $4.5 billion
in Ml-A2 tanks and other mili
tary equipment to Kuwait, it was
announced yesterday.
If approved by Congress as
expected, the move will boost
weapons-related industries in
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Indiana
and California.
The move to purchase 256
Abrams tanks — a top-of-the line
U.S. weapon — is part of a 10-

year plan to rebuild Kuwait's
shattered defenses in the wake of
the Persian Gulf War.
The tanks would make up the
bulk of Kuwait's armored force,
said a Pentagon official who asked
not to be identified.
The proposed sale, which was
announced at the Pentagon, is not
expected to be opposed in Congress.
Lawmakers have 30 days to vote
down the sale.
"The sale will contribute to the
foreign policy and national security

of the United States by helping to
improve the security of a friendly
country which is an important force
for stability and political and eco
nomic progress in the Middle East,"
the Pentagon statement said.
The announcement said the sale
will require "the assignment of a
significant number of U.S. govern
ment personnel and contractor
representatives" to Kuwait.
The Pentagon official said it
would probably take up to two
years for the tanks to be delivered.
