# EPA says secondhand smoke kills
## Report may mean increased regulation of smoking 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” The Environmental Protec
tion Agency will release a long-delayed report that
says secondhand cigarette smoke is a human carcino
gen which causes lung cancer and kills about 3,000
nonsmokers a year, agency officials said yesterday.
The report, to be released tomorrow, also con
cludes that secondhand smoke increases the risk of
pneumonia and bronchitis in children.
Release of the report, could trigger an avalanche
of federal, state and local regulations limiting smok
ing in public places, health advocates said.
"Having the EPA's imprimatur on this is extremely
important," said Dr. Alfred Munzer, a spokesman for
the Coalition on Smoking or Health, which includes
the American Lung Association, the American Heart
Association and the American Cancer Society.

"We believe this will motivate state governments,
local governments to enact further regulations lim
iting smoking in public places."
The report also could prod the Occupational Safe
ty and Health Administration to regulate smoking
in the workplace, health advocates said. Douglas
Fuller, an OSHA spokesman, said the agency would
weigh the EPA report carefully in its deliberations.
Munzer called on President Bush to use the
report to justify an order to restrict smoking in fed
eral buildings. "This is far less controversial than
the pardons he has issued and would do a tremen
dous amount for the public health," Munzer said.
The report concludes that secondhand smoke is a
proven human carcinogen, putting it in the same class
as asbestos, benzene and radon, EPA officials said.
