## A 						famous farewell 
### 
Students desire, and
should get, a big name
speaker at graduation

FOR FOUR YEARS, Stanford
seniors have sat in lectures
listening to some of the most
educated and brilliant minds speak
on the issues confronting our society.
By the time they put on their black

robes and funny hats
there's only one thing
they're willing to sit still
and listen to for more
than 10 minutes: fame.
For too long, the com-

mencement speaker has
been used for political
purposes or to make a
point to the outside com
munity. But, to sweeten

the final memory of this
institution, graduation
speakers should make a perma
nent impression upon the audi
ence not only through their words,
but through the accomplishments
associated with their names.
One of the senior class presi
dents' most important responsibil
ities is to advise University Presi
dent Casper on the selection of a
commencement speaker. This
years presidents, Rosa Villagomez,
Tina Hua, Brad Budney and Jason
Dicks, have done an admirable job
in collecting student input, even
providing a mail-in suggestion bal
lot on the calendars mailed to the
senior class.
For his part, Casper has
promised to be receptive to their
suggestions and make an effort to
chose someone who is more in
tune with the senior's desires.
Casper, however, has also stat
ed his desire to find a speaker
who has some connection to Stan
ford — preferably an alumni or
professor.
Finding a Stanford connection,
although a noble goal, is less
important than finding a voice
important to our generation —
someone seniors can immediately

recognize as having an influence
upon them.
The common architecture of
Stanford should not be the basis
for choosing a speaker who will, in
effect, send us into adulthood.
The following list of 20 potential
graduation speakers is meant to
illustrate the type of speaker who
would both interest the 1993 grad
uates and provide the closure they
expect. They are people who have
affected our generation and cap
tured our interest:

Arthur Ashe
Candice Bergen
• Boutros Boutros-
Ghali
• Johnny Carson
• Jimmy Carter
• Hillary Clinton
• Walter Cronkite
* • Matt Groening
• Vaclav Havel

• Ken Kesey
• Milan Kundera
• Spike Lee
• David Letterman
• Annie Liebovitz
• Madonna
• Thurgood Marshall
• Rigoberta Menchu
• Sandra Day O'Connor
• Hunter S. Thompson
• Jann Wenner

As people who have directly
affected the twentysomething gen
eration, they all have acted as
major commentators or innovators
of the changes we have experi
enced.
This year's graduation will
mark the A end of the first year of
Casper's era at* Stanford. Along
side his efforts to address the
needs of undergraduates in educa
tion, it will be important for him to
address and understand the
desires of this community.
Casper, like the undergraduate
community must see the gradua
tion ceremony for what it is: a pep
rally for adulthood — not a time to
recreate the atmosphere of a class
lecture for the sake of the parents
in the audience.
