## It's all ball bearings

HI, MY NAME IS TOM, AND I suf
fer from Chronic Movie Quote
Syndrome. The disease hasn't
really attracted that much media atten
tion, and the federal government has
only recently begun funding research for
a cure, but it's a very real malady — I
assure you.
It all started innocently enough, a few
random lines with friends on the football
team, you know, locker room talk. But late
ly I've found strange quotes cropping into
my conversations, letters, even papers.
So, you're probably asking yourself,
how do I figure out if I have a problem?
There are a few warning signs that you
should be on the lookout for:
• Do you find yourself quqting lines
with friends and shifting effortlessly from
movie to movie without fe beat?*
• Do you find yourself quoting movie
lines more often than uttering original
thoughts?
• Do your friends often ask "What
movie is that from" even when you do
have an original thought?
If you exhibit any or all of these warn
ing signs, I urge you to seek help.
Those of you who have CMQS will tend
to spend much of your time with friends
who have similar movie repertories to
yours. You will start slowly, recognize a
line that someone else uses, answer back
in kind, and form an immediate bond. In
the short term you simply have a common

topic to discuss and a common vocabu
lary, but later the self-destructive down
ward spiral begins.
Soon you will recognize that most of
what you say means nothing to anyone
who hasn't seen "Fletch," "Spinal Tap"
or "Princess Bride." You'll enter conver
sations with people you barely know by
asking if they happen to have six fingers
on their right hand, ask to borrow some
one's towel because your car just hit a
water buffalo and point to every volume
knob on an equalizer and announce that
it "goes to eleven."
People find it amusing at first and
chuckle a bit. If it continues, they laugh a
bit more uneasily and stare at their feet.
Finally, they'll wander off, whispering
among themselves, wondering what your
tiome life is like araf Where y6ur parents
went wrong.
Taken to an extreme it's possible that
you will recognize not only spoken dia
logue, but background music and some
times even intonation. If it gets to this
point, some sort of group therapy might
be in order. You'll say to yourself how
much worse can this get, and the answer
is none. None more worse.
For a long time, I denied I had a prob
lem. My friends would introduce me to
people saying, "This is Tom. He memo
rizes movies." I took special care to make
the distinction clear that I didn't memo
rize movies, I remembered them. As you

well know, there is a fine line between
remembering and memorizing.
I did take a sort of perverse pride,
though, in being able to clear out a TV
room full of people by quoting every line
of a movie. One by one they would leave,
express their disgust and advise me to
get a life. Eventually, there I was —
alone, laughing, talking to a movie
screen. Content.
Now, it really wasn't really that bad. I
never ruined a marriage, relationship or
anything like that, but my freshman
roommate and I did manage to chase a
good number of people out of our room by
speaking our movie language. Of course,
often times that was exactly the point. We
are proof that you really haven't seen
"Fletch" unless you've seen it with some
one who can quote every single line. Yes,
it's demented and sad, but social.
So take heart, there is treatment avail
able, and with your tax-deductible dona
tion we are that much closer to a cure. I
consider myself a completely new man,
refreshed and eager to use my own mind.
I can't wait.
