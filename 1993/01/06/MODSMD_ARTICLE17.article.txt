Former track member berates Brooks Johnson

IN MY YEARS AT STANFORD, I
never thought I would get to see the
article written by Tish Williams Dec.
3. Too bad her "Baring Brooks John
son's Bitter Legacy" could not have
been published several years ago.
Maybe then the Department of Ath
letics would have taken more direct
action to a problem that surfaced and
resurfaced with each incoming class of
Johnson's recruits.
Maybe then the numerous elite run
ners, who entrusted their talent to this
powerful, influential, yet destructive
coach, would have been able to realize
their goals.
Maybe then, when I read Williams'
article, I wouldn't have seen the para
graph which refers to the "conniving
bitch" who complained to the Athletics
Department.
I have a feeling I know who that
"bitch" is. My sophomore year on the
cross country team, I became progres
sively more disgusted and frustrated
with the negative, abusive atmosphere
that pervaded both practices and meets,
as well as our rapidly declining perfor
mances.
Our team included five high school
All-Americans and two of us who had
competed in the Junior World Champi
onships — so we weren't exactly pedes
trian. However, with a season or more
of Johnson's tutelage under our belts,
we were consistently acting as "chasers"
in the few meets we were allowed to
compete in. (At one point, Johnson
refused to take the women's team to
our District meet because we would
"embarrass him.")
His unrelenting tirades derogating
and disparaging our competitive ability
and our characters affected me and my
teammates more than just at the track.
It was decided that something had to be
done to stop this insufferable prostitu
tion of our talent.

I made an appointment to speak with
the Athletic Director, who at the time
was Andy Geiger. Geiger's secretary
instead scheduled a meeting between
me and Cheryl Levick, Associate Athlet
ic Director, who was new to the posi
tion.
At our first meeting, Levick seemed
genuinely concerned and shocked at the
the description of verbal and mental
abuse my teammates and I experienced.
At the end of an emotional meeting,
Levick assured me she would discuss
this with Geiger to see what recourse
we had.
Our next meeting was less promising.
The matter had been related to Geiger
who advised Levick that my teammates
and I should "work it out rationally"
with Johnson ourselves.
Could the Athletics Department not
understand that a "rational discus
sion" was impossible with a man who
once ordered a bus driver to "close the
door and drive away" as one of my
teammates ran after the bus crying,
simply because she was a few minutes
late?
A rational discussion with a coach
who bodily pulled me off the track in
the middle of a race because he said I
embarrassed him? A rational discussion
with a coach who would call me a "con
niving bitch" because I tried to defend
myself and my teammates from more of
his vicious verbal attacks?
I find it hard to comprehend that the
Athletics Department, who was invest
ing some $80,000 per runner, would not
follow up with some sort of corrective
action. I do not believe that the Univer
sity would allow a teacher to treat his
students in this manner, so why should
a coach be given the freedom to emo
tionally and spiritually injure his ath
letes?
I was not the first woman or man
who launched a complaint against John

son. But with such a disastrous out
come, I would probably be the last.
Why was there no action taken on
our behalf? According to conversations I
had with several women who ran for
Johnson in the early '80s, what my
teammates and I were going through
was not new.
Similar stories of Johnson's unwar
ranted, execrable verbal assaults on his
athletes abounded. Why had the Athlet
ics Department condoned Johnson's
coaching methods all these years, disre
garding or dismissing complaints as out
of their control? If the Athletics Depart
ment cannot claim jurisdiction over its
coaching staff, who does?
Unfortunately — or perhaps fortu
nately — my tenure on the team after
my meetings with the Athletics Depart
ment was short. When Johnson learned
of what I had done, he launched a per
sonal attack on me.
He ignored my presence at practice,
rarely spoke to me unless it was an
insult, and would not look me in the
eye. I had become a non-person. Soon
after that, I was a non-member; I was
terminated, kicked off, dismissed from
the team.
In any other venue, the actions John
son exhibited would not be tolerated.
But for some reason, a coach is granted
free license to emotionally assault and
mentally batter with no retribution.
Just look at Bobby Knight or Earl
Bruce.
I find it reproachable that an institu
tion that prides itself on its progressive
attitudes and "political correctness"
would in any department or field allow
these incidents of abuse to continue
unchecked for more than a decade.
So, to Williams, I encourage her not
to hate Johnson. The energy it con
sumes is incredible. I have come to
accept that my college running career
was a nonsuccess and only hope that I

will eventually experience again the
competitive drive and mental tenacity
which once were the ensigns of my run
ning.
I do not feel hatred for Johnson,
but rather compassion for one who
was unable to evince basic human sen
sitivity.
To the Athletics Department, it must
be a disgrace to knowingly have perpet
uated the legacy of a coach who, for
undefinable reasons, sacrificed the tal
ent of countless athletes.
I know I am not alone in my disen
chantment with the Stanford track pro
gram and the impotent Athletics
Department. It far outweighs any sense
of esteem I had when I signed that let
ter of intent to represent the Stanford
Cardinal. Let this stand as a letter of
discontent, to have had to bear that
"bitter legacy."
