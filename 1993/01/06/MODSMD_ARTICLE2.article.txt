# The 						doctor is out
## Cowell chief clinician quits 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
After 15 years at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, Dr. Harvey
Weinstein has resigned as the cen
ter's director to do research and
open a private practice.
Until a national search fills the
position, the directors of Cowell's
primary care and Counseling and
Psychological Services will over
see the health center.
"I've basically decided on pur
suing other interests," said Wein
stein, who left his post Dec. 31. He
served as a staff psychiatrist and
CAPS director before taking Cow
ell's helm in 1989.

Besides practicing in Palo Alto,
Weinstein said he plans to work
with Dr. Iris Litt and Stanford's
Institute for Research on Women
and Gender.
"It's been a very rare privilege
and honor to work with Stanford
students," he said, "and it is an ex
perience I'll never forget."
CAPS director Dr. Alejandro
Martinez, who will take over the
top position along with Dr. Harry
Knaster, said a specific date for
finding a replacement has not yet
been set.
"We want to do it as soon as
possible," he added. "A national
search of this scope will take sev
eral months."

He had high praise for Wein
stein, calling him a "strong, good
clinician" and a "good thinker."
Cowell's former director "showed
a real commitmentl . . . that in
cluded mental well-being, physi
cal well-being and health promo
tion."
Weinstein mentioned the open
ing of the pharmacy, anonymous
HIV testing and an alcohol pre
vention program that is "unique
in the country" as a few of the ac
complishments of which he is
proud.
But the new director will also
face problems, including those
caused by Stanford's budget cri
sis. "Diminishing resources and
continuing needs" are the student
health center's No. 1 challenge,
Martinez said.
Already forced to curtail Cow
ell's hours, Weinstein said that
although the current cuts have
not caused mtyor difficulties it
would be difficult to slice any
more from the budget.
The center has also been
plagued by tension between staff

and administrators over the deci
sion to end a 45-year affiliation
with the Palo Alto Medical Foun
dation.
Cowell has instead been trying
to develop a relationship with the
School of Medicine's Faculty
Practice Program for about the
past 16 months, Weinstein said.
Conflict with staff members is
"related to the resolution of [that]
relationship."
Doctors, nurses and support
staff who had worked for the Palo
Alto group and chose to stay at
Cowell had to re-apply for their
positions, and many lost seniori
ty, vacation time and sick leave.

Mary Edmonds, vice provost
for student affairs, will make the
final decision on the new director.
According to Martinez, the transi
tion period will be an opportunity
to examine different models of
organization at health centers
around the country.
"We want to look at different
ways . . . just to see if we still have
the best structure," he said. After
a job description has been writ
ten, the national search will
begin.
"In my opinion, it needs to be
someone who can maintain good
morale among the staff, who has
vision," Martinez said.
