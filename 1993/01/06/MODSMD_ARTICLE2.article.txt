### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
After 15 years at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, Dr. Harvey
Weinstein has resigned as the cen
ter's director to do research and
open a private practice.
Until a national search fills the
position, the directors of Cowell's
primary care and Counseling and
Psychological Services will over
see the health center.
"I've basically decided on pur
suing other interests," said Wein
stein, who left his post Dec. 31. He
served as a staff psychiatrist and
CAPS director before taking Cow
ell's helm in 1989.

Besides practicing in Palo Alto,
Weinstein said he plans to work
with Dr. Iris Litt and Stanford's
Institute for Research on Women
and Gender.
"It's been a very rare privilege
and honor to work with Stanford
students," he said, "and it is an ex
perience I'll never forget."
CAPS director Dr. Alejandro
Martinez, who will take over the
top position along with Dr. Harry
Knaster, said a specific date for
finding a replacement has not yet
been set.
"We want to do it as soon as
possible," he added. "A national
search of this scope will take sev
eral months."

He had high praise for Wein
stein, calling him a "strong, good
clinician" and a "good thinker."
Cowell's former director "showed
a real commitmentl . . . that in
cluded mental well-being, physi
cal well-being and health promo
tion."
Weinstein mentioned the open
ing of the pharmacy, anonymous
HIV testing and an alcohol pre
vention program that is "unique
in the country" as a few of the ac
complishments of which he is
proud.
But the new director will also
face problems, including those
