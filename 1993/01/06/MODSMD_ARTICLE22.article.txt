## Stanford raises play to topple Longhorns in second-half spree 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer has
expressed concern with the way her defend
ing national champion squad has failed to
perform up to its full potential. However,
after the Cardinal's solid second-half effort
last night against Texas, VanDerveer may be
able to stop worrying for a while.
Stanford delighted its eighth-year coach
as it exploded against the No. 17
Longhorns in the second period of play and
turned its three-point halftime lead into an
87-64 rout.
"I was pleased in the second half with
how our team played up-tempo," she said.
"In the first half we played kind of a half
court game, and we played to a stalemate.
The difference was getting into the transi
tion game in the second half."
The Cardinal jumped to an early 12-6
lead three minutes into the first period and
seemed to be in full control. The team
received an especially inspired perfor
mance by redshirt freshman Bobbie
Kelsey, a surprise starter for Stanford.
Kelsey nailed a three-point basket, made a
steal and pulled down two of her nine
rebounds in the game's opening moments .
"Bobbie hit a big three and [that got our
team going]," VanDerveer said. "I think
[she] brings a lot of excitement, and she's
so happy to be out there that it relaxes our
other players".
The Longhorns quickly stormed back,
tying the game at 12 apiece, never allowing
the Cardinal to build a commanding lead
during the first 20 minutes.
More importantly, the determined play
by the Texas squad prevented the Maples
Pavilion crowd of 5,052 from becoming an
overwhelming factor in the opening half.
After a pair of Molly Goodenbour fast
break layups stretched Stanford's lead to
20-14 and triggered an eruption from the
crowd, the Longhorns once again respond
ed to the challenge. A Nekeshia Henderson
three-pointer at the six-minute mark cut
the Cardinal margin to only one.
The second half proved to be a different
story, however, as the entire Stanford

squad switched into high gear and left its
hapless opponent in its dust. The Cardinal
utilized its potent fast-break offense to cre
ate an insurmountable 15-point lead just
five minutes into the period.
Texas head coach Jody Conradt bluntly
described her team's sudden destruction at
the hands of Stanford.
"It was a very competitive game in the

first half, and then we sort of lost it," she
explained. "It was a very physical game,
and I think we sort of wore out."
Indeed, the Cardinal ran the Longhorns
ragged with its explosive second half, led by
Goodenbour's fast-breaking. The senior
point guard dished out seven of her 12
assists in this period as she fired up the
entire Stanford squad.
"I think when we're running that it's
definitely to our advantage," Goodenbour
said. "I think that was the difference that
let us open it up in the second half. I'm able
to do things to get our team going."
When Goodenbour wasn't running up
and down the court, she was usually feed
ing senior teammates Val Whiting and
Chris MacMurdo. Whiting's inside post
moves earned her a game-high 23 points
while MacMurdo responded with 18 points
of her own.
After dominating its Texas opponent in
the second period of play, Conradt was full
of praise for the gritty Cardinal squad.
"I admire what Tara's done here," she
said. "It's a model program."
