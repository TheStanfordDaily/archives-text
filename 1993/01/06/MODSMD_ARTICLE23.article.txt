# Off the bench

### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
No one likes to be benched.
But rather than sulk about it,
Chris MacMurdo sublimated
any frustration she might have
felt last night, playing a critical
part in Stanford's victory over
Texas.
If Coach Tara VanDerveer
wanted to send the senior and
quad-captain a message, Mac-
Murdo sent one of her own right
back, scoring 18 points on torrid
8-for-12 shooting for the game.
MacMurdo had started all 10
games this season and was also a
starter on last year's national
championship team.
After the game she said, "I
didn't like sitting on the bench.
No competitor does. I just have
to go with what the coach
decides."
The 6-0 forward had started
at power forward instead of
small forward in the Cardinal's
last two games, replacing the
injured Rachel Hemmer.
Talking about her play in the
post, MacMurdo said without
boast, "I think I've been doing
an adequate job." In fact, for the
two-game span she averaged
double figures in both points
and rebounds.
But tonight, Hemmer was
back at power forward, and
Bobby Kelsey took MacMurdo's
spot on the wing.
VanDerveer credited Kelsey
with "hitting a big 'three' early,"
but she soon switched back to
MacMurdo. While the redshirt
freshman didn't score again and
played only three minutes in the
second half, MacMurdo's
resilient play kept her in the
game for almost the entire sec
ond period.
MacMurdo was on the receiv
ing end of a long bounce-pass
from Molly Goodenbour on a
fast break that elicited a roar
from the crowd, and a reverse
layup along the baseline by the
forward prompted a similar
response.
Sophomore Kate Paye also
joined the starting lineup last
night, replacing Christy Hedg
peth, who like MacMurdo had
started all of this year's games
and on last year's team.
After the game, VanDerveer
suggested she wanted to shake

things up a bit with the lineup
changes. "Some teams respond
to different things. Some people
have been taking their playing
time for granted," she said.
Evidently, the players got the
message. The old starting lineup
was on the floor for the start of
the second half, when the Cardi
nal pulled away from the
Longhorns. As MacMurdo said,
"As long as we win, that's what
counts."

Cardinal Notes
Senior Val Whiting became Stan
ford's second all-time career scorer
last night, bumping her total up to
1,670 for her career. She moved past
Trisha Stevens (1,649) and now
trails only Jeanne Ruark Hoff
(2,038), who played from 1978-83.
MacMurdo said the players on the
team don't pay much attention to
statistics. "We just do what we need
to win, and that usually means going
to Val."
