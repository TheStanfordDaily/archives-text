# Off the bench

### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
No one likes to be benched.
But rather than sulk about it,
Chris MacMurdo sublimated
any frustration she might have
felt last night, playing a critical
part in Stanford's victory over
Texas.
If Coach Tara VanDerveer
wanted to send the senior and
quad-captain a message, Mac-
Murdo sent one of her own right
back, scoring 18 points on torrid
8-for-12 shooting for the game.
MacMurdo had started all 10
games this season and was also a
starter on last year's national
championship team.
After the game she said, "I
didn't like sitting on the bench.
No competitor does. I just have
to go with what the coach
decides."
The 6-0 forward had started
at power forward instead of
small forward in the Cardinal's
last two games, replacing the
injured Rachel Hemmer.
Talking about her play in the
post, MacMurdo said without
boast, "I think I've been doing
an adequate job." In fact, for the
two-game span she averaged
double figures in both points
and rebounds.
But tonight, Hemmer was
back at power forward, and
Bobby Kelsey took MacMurdo's
spot on the wing.
VanDerveer credited Kelsey
with "hitting a big 'three' early,"
but she soon switched back to
MacMurdo. While the redshirt
freshman didn't score again and
played only three minutes in the
second half, MacMurdo's
resilient play kept her in the
game for almost the entire sec
ond period.
MacMurdo was on the receiv
ing end of a long bounce-pass
from Molly Goodenbour on a
fast break that elicited a roar
from the crowd, and a reverse
layup along the baseline by the
forward prompted a similar
response.
