# Giving well-deserved praise to Stanford's new guru
## 
### 
How lucky we are. You see, by
virtue of being associated with
Stanford, we can all claim mem
bership to that en vogue exclusive club
known as the "Friends of Bill" — Walsh,
that is.
Considering what he achieved this sea
son, how can you not like the guy? His
accomplishments as coach of the Cardi
nal were nothing short of spectacular:
• Stanford finished the season 10-3.
Stanford has not had a 10-victory season
since, in Walsh's words, "the time of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt." That's a lot
of Presidents in between. In fact, the
President-elect was not even born yet.
• The Cardinal is ranked No. 9 in the
nation in final national wire service polls,
the highest Stanford finish since 1971.
• Stanford both appeared in, and won,
a New Year's Day bowl game, also for the
first time since 1971.

• In his first year on the Farm, Walsh
guided the Cardinal to a Pacific 10 Con
ference Co-Championship, posting con
vincing wins over USC, UCLA and Cal en
route.
• The Cardinal handed Notre Dame its
only loss of the season, a 17-point shel
lacking in South Bend.
Not bad for the first year on the job.
Whatever sum the University is pay

ing, Walsh is worth every cent. In terms
of sheer revenue, he has paid for his con
tract three times over. Stanford Stadium
saw some sizeable home crowds and
increased ticket sales, Stanford appeared
on television several times this season, a
new national radio contract was signed
and Walsh's presence even earned Stan
ford some bonus bucks by way of the Dis
neyland Pigskin Classic in Anaheim.
Looking back on the season, one must
keep in mind that this is essentially the
same team as Denny Green's Aloha Bowl
squad of a year ago, and Walsh was
always quick to remind people of that.
Especially after the Blockbuster Bowl
win, Walsh immediately thanked his pre
decessor for assembling such a talented
team. That is the Walsh style: always gra
cious, always respectful and full of class.
Walsh's presence brought instant
high-profile visibility to the football pro

gram. The end results this year can be
deemed a breakthrough for Stanford
football — those academically qualified
players that in the past would have seri
ously considered Notre Dame or Michi
gan now have added Stanford to their
lists. Success breeds success, and now
Walsh will have the players to continue to
make a name for Stanford football. It is
hard not to gawk at the endless possibili
ties of what he'll be able to do with a team
full of his own recruits.
Walloping traditional powerhouse
Penn State by a 24-3 margin Jan. 1 didn't
hurt matters either. The win served as a
convincing stamp on the college football
world that indeed the Cardinal is for real.
Walsh has also brought back to the
Farm what had been sorely lacking as of
late — namely school spirit among the
mainstream student body. People are gen
uinely taking pride in the team, an occur

rence that, until recently, used to happen
only for Big Game week. All of those facul
ty members that complained last spring
about so much funding pouring into the
football program have now either become
ardent fans, or have been hushed into
silence upon fear of being permanently
outcast from the community.
When "the Genius" took over Stan
ford's coaching duties, he proclaimed, "this
is my bliss." I wonder what he'll say in the
near future after winning the Rose Bowl.

David Schwartz is a junior with four
years of high school managerial experi
ence. Fortunately for him, though, a
return to the sidelines next to the
Gatorade jar will not be necessary
because Walsh has the pick of some of the
finest managers in the country. So, his
column will continue to appear here
Wednesdays.
