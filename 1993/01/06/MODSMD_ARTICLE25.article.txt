# Pac-10 basketball race weak with new faces, lineups
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
After a month and a half of prepara
tion through countless invitationals,
tournaments, classics and shootouts, it is
finally time for Pacific 10 Conference
basketball coaches to stop waxing philo
sophical about Seattle Pacific and get
down to business.
The Pac-10 league season has arrived,
but this year's race looks to be much
more competitive than in recent years, as
the conference boasts more youth than
experience in 1992-93.
With the departure of UCLA's Don
Mac Lean and Tracy Murray, USC's
Harold Miner and Stanford's Adam
Keefe, the conference has less nationally
known marquee players this year, and
will look to new faces to carry the task of
bringing respect to the league.
Aside from All-America candidate
Chris Mills of Arizona, the biggest head
lines for the Pac-10 have come for new
comer Jason Kidd across the Bay at Cali
fornia. Only the coming months will
determine whether the preseason hype
has been deserved. Also, look for center
Scott Haskin of Oregon State and guard
Tyus Edney of UCLA to make prominent
contributions this season.
Perennial leaders Arizona and UCLA
should lead the Pac, but which teams will
round out the conference's usual allot
ment of four teams to the NCAA Tourna
ment is less than certain.
With that in mind, here is a preview of
the teams of the Pac-10, with their pre
dicted order of finish, excluding Stanford:

1. Arizona: The Wildcats lost three
starters from last year in guard Matt
Othick, center Sean Rooks and forward
Wayne Womack, but the two players
Coach Lute Olson has returning to his
starting five, Mills and Khalid Reeves,
are big-time. Mills, a 6-foot-6 forward
who averaged 16.8 points and 7.9
rebounds, has NBA skills and should
benefit from Arizona's more wide open
style with the departure of last year's
slow, post-up front line. Reeves, a 6-1
junior guard, is a playmaker with
tremendous speed. He will be joined in
the backcourt by sophomore Damon
Stoudamire, who shot 40.6 percent from
the three-point line as the sixth man his
freshman year. Ed Stokes, a 7-1 tower
who was slowed by hamstring injuries
last year, still managed to block 41 shots
and could be a true enforcer in the start
ing role. Olson secured one of the best
recruiting classes in the country last
year, signing an entire starting lineup of
top-100 prospects. The Wildcats will be
tested early with road games against
UCLA and USC this week, but have
enough talent to win the league comfort
ably.
2. UCLA: The Bruins have a solid core
of players, but this year's team is not
nearly as loaded as that of a year ago.
Mac Lean, Murray, Gerald Madkins and
Derrick Martin are gone, but Coach Jim
Harrick still has plenty to work with. In
the backcourt, point guard Edney is an
exciting player who creates opportunities
for his teammates. Shon Tarver, at the
offguard spot, complements Edney nice
ly. Forward Mitchell Butler may be the

most athletic player in the Pac-10. Up
front, Ed O'Bannon seems to have recov
ered from his knee problems and is
becoming the offensive threat that made
him such a coveted player out of high
school. In the middle, Richard Petruska,
a 6-10 senior transfer from Loyola Marv
mount, gives UCLA a presence at center
which has been lacking in recent years.
The bench is the Bruins' real weak spot,
as a recent 12-point loss to Pittsburgh
without the services of Butler demon
strated. Only reserve forwards Rodney
Zimmerman and Jiri Zidek have experi
ence, but nevertheless, the Bruins have
more than enough weapons to challenge
for the title.
3. California: The Golden Bears
return a strong crop of players, led by All
Pac-10 performer Brian Hendrick (16.1
points per game, 10.1 rebounds). Coach
Lou Campanelli's strong recruiting class
of 1991 — forwards Alfred Grigsby and
Lamond Murray and guard K.J. Roberts
— have a year of playing experience
under their belt, and should only contin
ue to get better. Round out that five with
superfrosh Kidd and the Bears have a
combination that could go places. Fresh
man guard Jerod Haase has also proven
himself to be a competitor, and sopho
more center Ryan Jamison can con
tribute off the bench. Cal is probably a
year away from being in position to win
the Pac-10, but they will certainly give
many opposing teams trouble.
4. Oregon State: All five starters are
back for the Beavers. The best least
known player in the country may be Scott
Haskin, a 6-11 center who rallies the

faithful in Corvallis. Haskin led the
league in field goal percentage (61.2) and
blocked shots (2.2 per game) last season.
Coach Jim Anderson again has the ser
vices of senior Chad Scott (17.8 points
per game), who left the team last season
due to academic difficulties and legal
problems. Forward Mustapha Hoff lines
up alongside Haskin and Scott. The
guard spots will be filled by the consis
tent senior Charles McKinney and sopho
more Brent Barry. The key to Oregon
State's success will be Scott, for he must
play steadily to take pressure off Haskin.
5. USC: The Trojans lost last year's
backcourt of Miner and Duane Cooper to
the NBA, and postman Yamen Sanders is
also gone. But coach George Raveling still
has the services of seniors Phil Glenn and
Rodney Chatman at the guard slots.
Junior bruiser Mark Boyd and sopho
more scorer Lorenzo Orr line up at the
forwards, but the question mark remains
in the middle. 6-5 sophomore Tremayne
Anchrum starts at center, but the relief
duties fall on the shoulders of two fresh
men — Kirk Homenick and David
Crouse. The Trojans have beaten quality
teams during the non-conference season
in Nebraska, Miami and Notre Dame, but
whether that will translate into Pac-10
success is questionable.
6. Arizona State: The Sun Devils'
main obstacle to success is keeping their
players on the active roster. Between
injuries and illegal activity, coach Bill
Freider has lost many of his top players
for the year. Sophomore forward Mario
Bennett (12.5 ppg, 6.8 rebounds), a Pac
-10 All-Freshman team performer last

season, injured his knee in a summer
pickup game and is out for the year.
Junior forward Jamal Faukner was
kicked off the team by Frieder after vio
lating the terms of his probation for cred
it card fraud. He was allegedly involved in
an assault on his girlfriend and missed
curfew, resulting in several nights spent
in jail last summer. Junior forward
Dwayne Fontana may return for the Pac
-10 season, though he will be a bit rusty.
He too was involved in a sexual assault
last year. ASU does have two returning
starters in center Lester Neal and guard
Stevin Smith. Junior transfer guard Mar
cel Capers and freshman guard Ron Riley
fill out the frontcourt, and 6-8 sopho
more transfer forward James Bacon will
complete the three guard, two forward
lineup.
7. Stanford: An assessment and pre
view of the Cardinal as it heads into the
Pac-10 season will appear tomorrow.
8. Washington: The Huskies have
one of the best frontlines in the confer
ence, but trouble looms at the guard posi
tion. 6-10 senior center Rich Manning
averaged 16.8 points and 6.1 rebounds
last year after transferring from Syra
cuse. Mark Pope, last season's Pac-10
Freshman of the Year, posts strong num
bers in both points (10.3) and boards
(8.1). Martin Keane, a 6-8 senior transfer
from Oklahoma and a member of the
1992 Canadian Olympic team, adds mus
cle to the group. At guard, Brent Pagett
gets the nod at the point and Bryant
Boston, who started 17 games last year
