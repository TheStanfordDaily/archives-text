## Listening in on the wiretapping debate Congressional bill pleases FBI, upsets telecommunications industry 
### Peter Stevens Staff writer 
Eavesdropping on telephone conversations
used to be easy. But the technology used in
telecommunications equipment has gotten
more and more complicated. As a result, wire
tapping has become much more difficult.
Those interested in listening in on conver
sations are facing new difficulties due to the
conversion of most telecommunications sig
nals into digital form, as well as by the prolif
eration of both new types of communications,
such as electronic mail, and new types of
transmission equipment, such as digital fiber
optic cables.
Wiretapping is used by both federal and
state law enforcement agencies in criminal
investigations. Legal wiretaps require autho
rization by court order and are relatively rare.
They are intended as procedures of last
resort, because such investigative techniques
are considered extremely intrusive.
According to FBI figures, Federal and
State agencies together received under a
thousand interception authorizations from
the courts in 1990. However, FBI Director
William Sessions said in an interview with the
Boston Globe that interception is a key tech
nique in these cases. Many important crimi
nal investigations in areas such as terrorism,
racketeering and drug trafficking could not be
pursued without the ability to selectively
intercept and record communications without
the knowledge of the suspects.
The FBI claims to be having difficulty car
rying out legally authorized interceptions due
to technical and structural changes in the
telecommunications business. Their response
to this difficulty was to propose legislation
last year to force telecommunications equip
ment providers to design interception capabil
ity into their products from the ground up.
In seeking the new legislation the FBI says
it is just requiring help from industry in over
coming the technological challenges, not ask
ing for additional rights or privileges beyond
what current law provides.
"We are just asking to maintain the ability
we have had in the past to implement court
ordered interceptions," said FBI spokesman
Nestor Michnak. "With the proliferation of
many small telecommunications providers
and rapid technical change, this has become
increasingly difficult."
The Digital Telephony bill, to be consid
ered in the next Congress, would require all
"providers of electronic communications ser
vices and private branch exchange operators"
to make design decisions explicitly fqjr wire
tapping. The bill would also empower tne Jus
tice department (the FBl's parent organiza
tion) to enforce compliance with the regula
tions, and specifies penalties for non-compli
ance.
The bill actually extends far beyond voice
communications. "Providers of electronic
communications" encompass essentially all
electronic common carriers, not just what we
normally think of as the telephone system.
Computer bulletin board systems, electronic
mail, wide area networks such as the Internet
and many other related computer and com
munications systems are covered by the
extremely broad language of the bill.
Much of the Stanford community uses elec
tronic communications in the form of e-mail,
Folio and on-line information such as medical
records, in addition to ordinary voice commu
nications. All these systems would be subject
to the new design-for-wiretapping guidelines.
A public interest group, the Computer Pro
fessionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR),
and the telecommunications industry have
both expressed objections to the FBl's pro
posal as it currently stands.
The CPSR's objections concern the broad
scope of the legislation, the lack of public
debate over the bill, and the legislation's
impacts on technological development, securi
ty and privacy.
"The FBI fails to see some of the negative
consequences of this legislation," said Marc
Rotenberg, head of the CPSR Washington
D.C. Office. "Wire surveillance is far more

intrusive than other investigative techniques.
Public oversight of communications policy in
this area is crucial."
Neither the CPSR nor the telecommunica
tions industry question the right of law

enforcement agencies to carry out
court-ordered wiretaps. They do

question the FBl's characteriza
tion of the problem, and they A
agree that there are technical
problems with the FBl's

approach.
The FBI does not claim it
has been unable to imple
ment any court ordered

wiretap because of techni
cal difficulty. It will only
say that some court
orders have not been
sought because of per
ceived technical diffi-

culties with a spe
cific telecommuni-

cations provider.
According to

industry
sources, the
FBI and state 1
law enforce- %

ment agencies
currently
have reason- 1
able access to

interception ■
targets as
authorized by
court orders.
"They can cur-

rently imple
ment wiretaps,".
said Elliot
Maxwell, Assis
tant Vice Presi
dent for Corpo-

rate Strategy at
Pacific Telesis.
"The industry is
involved in on
going talks with
both Federal and
State law enforce-

ment agencies to
ensure this contin
ues."

Maxwell feels that
the specific means of
implementing surveil
lance should remain with

the telecommunications compa
nies. ... .*

The technical problems with the rlm's
proposal include the "dumbing down" of
American telecommunications products.
Implementing the technical features
required by the bill could result in security
and privacy problems because of the
requirement to leave "back doors" in the
telecommunications software for wiretap
access.
Maxwell claims that "design for intercept
ability may inherently compromise securi
ty." Such systems might be difficult to sell
and, if used, allow privacy breaches.
The telecommunications industry, in a
joint comment on the FBl's initiative, has
pointed out that the requirement for wire
tapping access would impose new engineer
ing standards on the industry. Current law
makes no such imposition — law enforce
ment agencies take the communications net
work "as is" and work within its constraints.
The new requirements imposed by the bill
would impose additional costs on new devel
opment.
Both the CPSR and the telecommunica
tions industry believe the FBl's proposal is
not the only possible technical solution.
Both argue that telecommunications com
panies can easily devise other ways of inter
cepting communications on a case by case
basis.
They argue that the number of wiretaps
is very small compared to the number of
connections into the communications net
work and the number of calls made. The

number or connections to tre Communica
tions network in the United' States is in
excess of 140 million, and the number of
communications initiated per year is well in
excess of one trillion.
"A huge industry and user community
would be affected for the convenience of a
relatively small number of interceptions,"
Rotenberg said. "It is as if the Federal Gov
ernment, concerned about speeding,
required all auto manufacturers to put less
powerful engines in cars."
Sobel agreed, questioning whether gov
ernment interest in law enforcement
should have precedence in technical devel
opment. "Should the guiding force behind
technical development in the telecommuni
cations industry be convenient law enforce
ment, or should it be technical excellence
in a free society and international market
place?"
Shortly after the FBI proposed the Digital
Telephony bill last year, the CPSR request
ed, under the Freedom of Information Act,
internal working documents from the FBI.
When the FBI refused, the CPSR filed suit in
Sept. 1992 to compel them to release the rel
evant documents.
The suit, which is still pending, seeks not
to stop the bill, but to force the FBI to reveal
its rationale for the legislation. "We want
the FBI to reveal its reports of problems and
the technical analysis it has done," said
David Sobel, an attorney with the CPSR
Washington D.C. office.

"We are just asking to maintain the ability
we have had in the past to implement court
ordered interceptions," said FBI spokesman
Nestor Michnak. "With the proliferation of
many small telecommunications providers
and rapid technical change, this has become
increasingly difficult."
The Digital Telephony bill, to be consid
ered in the next Congress, would require all
"providers of electronic communications ser
vices and private branch exchange operators"
to make design decisions explicitly fqjr wire
tapping. The bill would also empower tne Jus
tice department (the FBl's parent organiza
tion) to enforce compliance with the regula
tions, and specifies penalties for non-compli
ance.
The bill actually extends far beyond voice
communications. "Providers of electronic
communications" encompass essentially all
electronic common carriers, not just what we
normally think of as the telephone system.
Computer bulletin board systems, electronic
mail, wide area networks such as the Internet
and many other related computer and com
munications systems are covered by the
extremely broad language of the bill.
Much of the Stanford community uses elec
tronic communications in the form of e-mail,
Folio and on-line information such as medical
records, in addition to ordinary voice commu
nications. All these systems would be subject
to the new design-for-wiretapping guidelines.
A public interest group, the Computer Pro
fessionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR),
and the telecommunications industry have
both expressed objections to the FBl's pro
posal as it currently stands.
The CPSR's objections concern the broad
scope of the legislation, the lack of public
debate over the bill, and the legislation's
impacts on technological development, securi
ty and privacy.
"The FBI fails to see some of the negative
consequences of this legislation," said Marc
Rotenberg, head of the CPSR Washington
D.C. Office. "Wire surveillance is far more

intrusive than other investigative techniques.
Public oversight of communications policy in
this area is crucial."
Neither the CPSR nor the telecommunica
tions industry question the right of law

enforcement agencies to carry out
court-ordered wiretaps. They do

question the FBl's characteriza
tion of the problem, and they A
agree that there are technical
problems with the FBl's

approach.
The FBI does not claim it
has been unable to imple
ment any court ordered

wiretap because of techni
cal difficulty. It will only
say that some court
orders have not been
sought because of per
ceived technical diffi-

culties with a spe
cific telecommuni-

cations provider.
According to

industry
sources, the
FBI and state 1
law enforce- %

ment agencies
currently
have reason- 1
able access to

interception ■
targets as
authorized by
court orders.
"They can cur-

rently imple
ment wiretaps,".
said Elliot
Maxwell, Assis
tant Vice Presi
dent for Corpo-

rate Strategy at
Pacific Telesis.
"The industry is
involved in on
going talks with
both Federal and
State law enforce-

ment agencies to
ensure this contin
ues."

Maxwell feels that
the specific means of
implementing surveil
lance should remain with

the telecommunications compa
nies. ... .*

The technical problems with the rlm's
proposal include the "dumbing down" of
American telecommunications products.
Implementing the technical features
required by the bill could result in security
and privacy problems because of the
requirement to leave "back doors" in the
telecommunications software for wiretap
access.
Maxwell claims that "design for intercept
ability may inherently compromise securi
ty." Such systems might be difficult to sell
and, if used, allow privacy breaches.
The telecommunications industry, in a
joint comment on the FBl's initiative, has
pointed out that the requirement for wire
tapping access would impose new engineer
ing standards on the industry. Current law
makes no such imposition — law enforce
ment agencies take the communications net
work "as is" and work within its constraints.
The new requirements imposed by the bill
would impose additional costs on new devel
opment.
Both the CPSR and the telecommunica
tions industry believe the FBl's proposal is
not the only possible technical solution.
Both argue that telecommunications com
panies can easily devise other ways of inter
cepting communications on a case by case
basis.
They argue that the number of wiretaps
is very small compared to the number of
connections into the communications net
work and the number of calls made. The

number or connections to tre Communica
tions network in the United' States is in
excess of 140 million, and the number of
communications initiated per year is well in
excess of one trillion.
"A huge industry and user community
would be affected for the convenience of a
relatively small number of interceptions,"
Rotenberg said. "It is as if the Federal Gov
ernment, concerned about speeding,
required all auto manufacturers to put less
powerful engines in cars."
Sobel agreed, questioning whether gov
ernment interest in law enforcement
should have precedence in technical devel
opment. "Should the guiding force behind
technical development in the telecommuni
cations industry be convenient law enforce
ment, or should it be technical excellence
in a free society and international market
place?"
Shortly after the FBI proposed the Digital
Telephony bill last year, the CPSR request
ed, under the Freedom of Information Act,
internal working documents from the FBI.
When the FBI refused, the CPSR filed suit in
Sept. 1992 to compel them to release the rel
evant documents.
The suit, which is still pending, seeks not
to stop the bill, but to force the FBI to reveal
its rationale for the legislation. "We want
the FBI to reveal its reports of problems and
the technical analysis it has done," said
David Sobel, an attorney with the CPSR
Washington D.C. office.

Eavesdropping on telephone conversations
used to be easy. But the technology used in
telecommunications equipment has gotten
more and more complicated. As a result, wire
tapping has become much more difficult.
Those interested in listening in on conver
sations are facing new difficulties due to the
conversion of most telecommunications sig
nals into digital form, as well as by the prolif
eration of both new types of communications,
such as electronic mail, and new types of
transmission equipment, such as digital fiber
optic cables.
Wiretapping is used by both federal and
state law enforcement agencies in criminal
investigations. Legal wiretaps require autho
rization by court order and are relatively rare.
They are intended as procedures of last
resort, because such investigative techniques
are considered extremely intrusive.
According to FBI figures, Federal and
State agencies together received under a
thousand interception authorizations from
the courts in 1990. However, FBI Director
William Sessions said in an interview with the
Boston Globe that interception is a key tech
nique in these cases. Many important crimi
nal investigations in areas such as terrorism,
racketeering and drug trafficking could not be
pursued without the ability to selectively
intercept and record communications without
the knowledge of the suspects.
The FBI claims to be having difficulty car
rying out legally authorized interceptions due
to technical and structural changes in the
telecommunications business. Their response
to this difficulty was to propose legislation
last year to force telecommunications equip
ment providers to design interception capabil
ity into their products from the ground up.
In seeking the new legislation the FBI says
it is just requiring help from industry in over
coming the technological challenges, not ask
ing for additional rights or privileges beyond
what current law provides.
