# Bug investigates a tasteless question with his tongue in cheek
## 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Q: Does pure water have a flavor? For
example, if you wanted to manufac
ture some water-flavored candy, what
would you put in it? If you gave someone
a piece, would they say, "Mmm, this
tastes just like water," or would they just
say, "\Wiat the hell is this?" If water does
have a flavor, where does the flavor come
from — is it the hydrogen or the oxygen?
A: If I were possessed by the desire to
make water-flavored candy, I'd be at
a loss for which ingredients to use. Other
than the mainstream American beers,
very few things in the world taste like
water — except, of course, pure water
itself.
As for the rest of your question: A
great and venerated professor of biology
once related to me (and the ninety thou
sand other students in the lecture hall) a
true tale of the folly of a particular gang
of medieval church scholars, who once
spent the better part of a week debating
the exact number of teeth found in a
horse's mouth.
None of them went to the trouble of
going to the holy stables and examining
one of the blessed steeds, and — although

If you feel like you can
taste water, either
you've got rusty pipes
or that waiter you stiffed
last week is having a
wee joke at your
expense.

history leaves us hanging on this point —
I'd be willing to bet a dozen of those little
communion cookies that they never came
up with the right answer.
With this in mind, I ask you: Why not
look the proverbial horse in the mouth?
Get up. Go to the store. Buy some dis
tilled water. Have a drink.
Well?
Since you probably share the typical
American reluctance when confronted
with the prospect of actually doing an
experiment, I'll assume that you are still
reading and I'll have to tell you the
answer. But first, some background
about taste.
Taste, also known as gustation, is the

process by which an animal identifies dis
solved chemicals placed in contact with
one of its organs. Recognition of a tasty
molecule usually depends more strongly
on the overall molecular structure of the
chemical than on its elemental composi
tion.
Hence, if water had a flavor, it would
be due to its shape, rather than the just
the hydrogen or just the oxygen.
Some organisms have gustatory
organs distributed over the whole body —
fish have them on the fins and tail — but
in mammals the sense of taste is limited
to the oral taste buds.
In humans, the taste buds consist of
cup-like structures called papillae, where

gustatory sense reception actually takes
place. The papillae are distributed all
over the tongue and on the adjacent por
tions of the palate and throat.
Classically, theories of gustation treat
ed all tastes as the result of mental inte
gration of four basic qualities: salty,
sweet, bitter and sour. Papillae devoted
to the former two are most prevalent on
the tongue itself, while receptors for the
latter pair of basic tastes are more com
mon on the throat and palate.
You may notice that I don't mention
"wetness" (or whatever the taste quality
of pure water would be) as one of the four
basic gustatory stimuli. You might con
clude from this omission that water has

no flavor. And, in the case of humans,
you'd be right: As far as the best efforts
of gustation researchers have yet indicat
ed, we proud highest primates cannot
taste pure water.
Sure, the clear fluid that runs from
the faucets may evoke a different gusta
tory response in Omaha than it does in
I>as Vegas, but the strength of anv such
response is in direct proportion to the
impurity of said fluid. If you feel like you
can taste water, either you've got rusty
pipes or that waiter you stiffed last week
is having a wee joke at your expense.
In closing, I must note that my narrow
anthropocentric answer is not universal.
In some species of mammals (in particu
lar, the cat), specific taste receptors* are
indeed activated by water, making water
taste a fifth gustatory quality in these
species. These same receptors are inhibit
ed by weak saline solutions, suggesting to
this humble Bug that the purpose of
water-taste receptors is to tell your dear
little kitty when it's safe to drink the
water.
Doesn't stop them from drinking out
of the toilet, though.
