# Hospital appoints directors
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Stanford Hospital is starting the new year with
three new directors.
Psychiatry Department Chair Alan Schatzberg
and two area residents — Betsy Morgenthaler and
Samuel Bronfman 11, each involved in the wine in
dustry and charitable groups — were appointed to
the hospital's Board of Directors as of Jan. 1. They
will each serve three-year terms.
According to board coordinator Maijorie Hildahl,
the three were chosen as part of a ongoing process for
selecting directors. The board's members — current
ly numbering 23 — have responsibilities such as
working on the hospital's budget, approving policies
for the hospital's medical stafT and approving staff
members, she said.
Schatzberg is serving as faculty representative to
the governing body, replacing Functional Restora
tion Prof. Lars Vistnes, whose term expired.
Educated at the New York University School of
Medicine, he served on the faculty at Harvard until
coming to the West Coast in 1991. He is a specialist on
depression.
Morgenthaler is a partner in the Rutherford Hill
and Jaiger Vineyards wineries. She has volunteered

at the hospital since 1986, serving first with the Com
munity Committee, and then the fund-raising Devel
opment Council. She also helped form the Hospital
Partners fund-raising board.
"It's been an interesting, involved and committed
six years," Morgenthaler said.
She said serving on the hospital board should be
interesting because nationwide changes in health
care are imminent, perhaps including reduced gov
ernmental funding for health care.
"There's going to be a big squeeze," Morgenthaler
said. "Clinton's stated goal is that health care reform
is one of the priorities of his administration."
Morgenthaler received her undergraduate degree
from UC-Berkeley and a master's degree from the
University of Virginia.
The third new board member, Samuel Bronfman
11, is president of the Seagram Classics Wine Co. , and
has worked with several charitable groups including
Meals on Wheels and the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defama
tion League.
He is also president of the Samuel Bronfman
Foundation. Named for his grandfather, the founda
tion is a charitable philanthropic organization.
Morgenthaler and Bronfman replace Emeritus
Surgery Prof. Lawrence Crowley and Stanford Board
of Trustees Chair John Freidenrich on the board.
