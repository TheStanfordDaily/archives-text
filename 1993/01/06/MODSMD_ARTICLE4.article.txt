# Attention tree huggers: Stanford to host Earth Day 1993
## 
### Haley Mitchell 
Thousands of people will flood the cam
pus in April when Stanford hosts Bay Area
Earth Day 1993, a $75,000 environmental
extravaganza featuring live entertainment
and educational booths.
Performers Joan Baez, Bonnie Raitt
and Los Lobos have been invited, along
with speakers such as "Diet for a New
America" author John Robbins, Sierra
Club executive director Karl Pope and
Pulitzer Prize-winner Wallace Stegner.
Senator Barbara Boxer and Representa
tive Anna Eshoo are also hoping to appear
at the April 17 event, according to Holly
Kaslewicz, co-director of Earth Day at
Stanford and executive director of Bay
Area Action Network.
The event is expected to draw up to
10,000 people, she said, and is a combined
effort of Students for Environmental Ac

tion at Stanford, Bay Area Action Network
and the city governments of Palo Alto and
East Palo Alto.
Kaslewicz cited Stanford's neutrality,
facilities and cooperative SEAS group as
the primary reasons it was chosen to host
the fair
"This is an opportunity for Stanford not
to be an island, not an isolated tower, but
rather to be connected," she said. "Stan
ford can show that it cares to build connec
tions with surrounding groups."
Bay Area Action Network initiated
Earth Day 1993 as a follow-up to the 1990
event, which was an international effort to
stimulate awareness, confirm commit
ment to the earth and focus on the chang
ing needs of the '90s.
But Earth Day at Stanford will have a
much narrower focus, SEAS coordinator
Abdi Soltani said — to incorporate an envi
ronmental awareness into the daily lives of

individuals, organizations and businesses
in the Bay Area.
Earth Day 1993 is to be the first of an
nual Earth Day fairs at Stanford,
Kaslewicz said. It will be an all-day, free-of
charge event featuring shows by nationally
known musicians as well as acoustic per
formers, rappers, a cappella groups and
possibly even the Stanford Band.
On the educational side, there will be
hands-on interactive booths, theme infor
mation areas like "The Clean and Green
House" and "Ecosystems on Earth," sever
al speakers and areas to view videos and
slide presentations.
Earth Day coordinators want to host the
event on the intramural fields, but
Kaslewicz said the site has not yet been
confirmed.
The Earth Day Advisory Committee —
which includes former University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy — is hoping that

Stanford's administration will make Earth
Day 1993 a priority, she added.
Despite the excitement surrounding
Earth Day, some members of SEAS said
they worried people will come to the Earth
Day fair, feel good about themselves and
then leave without making any sort of
change or commitment to the environment.
The SEAS Earth Day Group, led by
Soltani and Michael Cohen, has responded
by gearing the fair toward practical and on
going changes.
"The booths will be very informative,"
Soltani said. "For example, the Clean and
Green House will feature products one can
buy that are environmentally safe to re
place a currently used, damaging product.
Other booths will inform visitors about or
ganic agriculture, for example."
A month of programs
Pre-Earth Day projects will pave the

way for the Stanford event. An Earth Day
Benefit Run sponsored by the city of Palo
Alto, a lecture series at Stanford and a
youth creative writing contest have been
scheduled.
Follow-up activities will also be publi
cized at the Earth Day event, encouraging
visitors to sign up and make a personal
commitment to preservation.
Post-Earth Day programs include com
munity workshops in composting and
urban gardening with Palo Alto Historical
Society, a tree planting day with Magic
Inc., volunteer orientation sessions at spe
cific organizations, nature hikes, a Bay
lands cleanup and a wetlands tour.
The precursor projects, Earth Day at
Stanford and the follow-up activities com
prise what is known as Bay Area Earth
Month. The calendar of this month has pri-
marily been engineered by the
SEAS group, Soltani said, which
believes that a series of events will
have a more significant impact
than a one-day fair.
The month's programming is
part of the effort to promote ongo
ing change and community
involvement in environmental
preservation, he said.
With an an estimated cost of
approximately $75,000 for Earth
Day at Stanford, Kaslewicz said all
cooperating parties have been
fund raising this past quarter and
finding sponsors for the event.
Foundations and grants have
been solicited in addition to local
government and business spon
sors, and individual contributors.
However, she said the majority of
the money still remains to be
raised. A sponsorship drive will be
held in January to attempt to gen
erate funds.
A reinvigorated SEAS
SEAS, which is playing a coor
dinating role in April's event, was
created in 1987 and overhauled

last year when enthusiastic fresh
men members took over the
group's leadership hoping to
undertake more projects.
"A lot of people put a lot of ener
gy in to Earth Day 1990, but it
seemed that energy was difficult to
sustain and redirect," Sol tan i said.
"We now have a new and different
energy that we've used to get a lot
done."
Since the overhaul, Soltani said
SEAS has been among the most
ambitious of college environmen
tal groups. More than 15 different
environmental projects are cur
rently underway under its umbrel
la.
The Eco House Project, led by
sophomores Lara Keper and Grace
Kong, is working with the Stan
ford Housing Administration to
create an environmentally sound
housing facility.
Students were concerned that
newly built dorms such as Lan
tana, Costano and Kimball did not
take advantage of existing envi
ronmental technologies, according
to sophomore David Groves, a
group member.
He said such technologies,
which are very cost-effective,
include passive solar lighting and
heating. "Gray water" from sinks

and showers can be recycled and
re-used — to water the grounds,
for example.
"We wanted the University to
do a bit of research and break itself
from the 'standard housing' mind
set," Groves said. "We hoped they
would look at other alternatives
and see if they were feasible."
The University responded by
hiring some renowned environ
mentally minded architects and
designers, but as of yet no defini
tive housing plans have been set,
he added.
"After the many hours of work,
we are anxiously awaiting the Uni
versity's new and innovative
designs for future housing at the
Knoll Site," he said.
Another SEAS sub-group is Stu
dents for Environmental Educa
tion, headed by sophomores Jessie
Levine and Keane Lee. Members
teach interactive environmental
education at the Castano elemen
tary school in East Palo Alto.
The sub-group has approxi
mately 30 student volunteers per
quarter and is now looking to
expand by offering their teaching
at other elementary schools in the
area. Future plans include initiat
ing their teaching program at
other universities.

buy that are environmentally safe to re
place a currently used, damaging product.
Other booths will inform visitors about or
ganic agriculture, for example."
A month of programs
Pre-Earth Day projects will pave the

way for the Stanford event. An Earth Day
Benefit Run sponsored by the city of Palo
Alto, a lecture series at Stanford and a
youth creative writing contest have been
scheduled.
Follow-up activities will also be publi
cized at the Earth Day event, encouraging
visitors to sign up and make a personal
commitment to preservation.
Post-Earth Day programs include com
munity workshops in composting and
urban gardening with Palo Alto Historical
Society, a tree planting day with Magic
Inc., volunteer orientation sessions at spe
cific organizations, nature hikes, a Bay
lands cleanup and a wetlands tour.
The precursor projects, Earth Day at
Stanford and the follow-up activities com
prise what is known as Bay Area Earth
Month. The calendar of this month has pri-
marily been engineered by the
SEAS group, Soltani said, which
believes that a series of events will
have a more significant impact
than a one-day fair.
The month's programming is
part of the effort to promote ongo
ing change and community
involvement in environmental
preservation, he said.
With an an estimated cost of
approximately $75,000 for Earth
Day at Stanford, Kaslewicz said all
cooperating parties have been
fund raising this past quarter and
finding sponsors for the event.
Foundations and grants have
been solicited in addition to local
government and business spon
sors, and individual contributors.
However, she said the majority of
the money still remains to be
raised. A sponsorship drive will be
held in January to attempt to gen
erate funds.
A reinvigorated SEAS
SEAS, which is playing a coor
dinating role in April's event, was
created in 1987 and overhauled

last year when enthusiastic fresh
men members took over the
group's leadership hoping to
undertake more projects.
"A lot of people put a lot of ener
gy in to Earth Day 1990, but it
seemed that energy was difficult to
sustain and redirect," Sol tan i said.
"We now have a new and different
energy that we've used to get a lot
done."
Since the overhaul, Soltani said
SEAS has been among the most
ambitious of college environmen
tal groups. More than 15 different
environmental projects are cur
rently underway under its umbrel
la.
The Eco House Project, led by
sophomores Lara Keper and Grace
Kong, is working with the Stan
ford Housing Administration to
create an environmentally sound
housing facility.
Students were concerned that
newly built dorms such as Lan
tana, Costano and Kimball did not
take advantage of existing envi
ronmental technologies, according
to sophomore David Groves, a
group member.
He said such technologies,
which are very cost-effective,
include passive solar lighting and
heating. "Gray water" from sinks

and showers can be recycled and
re-used — to water the grounds,
for example.
"We wanted the University to
do a bit of research and break itself
from the 'standard housing' mind
set," Groves said. "We hoped they
would look at other alternatives
and see if they were feasible."
The University responded by
hiring some renowned environ
mentally minded architects and
designers, but as of yet no defini
tive housing plans have been set,
he added.
"After the many hours of work,
we are anxiously awaiting the Uni
versity's new and innovative
designs for future housing at the
Knoll Site," he said.
Another SEAS sub-group is Stu
dents for Environmental Educa
tion, headed by sophomores Jessie
Levine and Keane Lee. Members
teach interactive environmental
education at the Castano elemen
tary school in East Palo Alto.
The sub-group has approxi
mately 30 student volunteers per
quarter and is now looking to
expand by offering their teaching
at other elementary schools in the
area. Future plans include initiat
ing their teaching program at
other universities.
Thousands of people will flood the cam
pus in April when Stanford hosts Bay Area
Earth Day 1993, a $75,000 environmental
extravaganza featuring live entertainment
and educational booths.
Performers Joan Baez, Bonnie Raitt
and Los Lobos have been invited, along
with speakers such as "Diet for a New
America" author John Robbins, Sierra
Club executive director Karl Pope and
Pulitzer Prize-winner Wallace Stegner.
Senator Barbara Boxer and Representa
tive Anna Eshoo are also hoping to appear
at the April 17 event, according to Holly
Kaslewicz, co-director of Earth Day at
Stanford and executive director of Bay
Area Action Network.
The event is expected to draw up to
10,000 people, she said, and is a combined
effort of Students for Environmental Ac

tion at Stanford, Bay Area Action Network
and the city governments of Palo Alto and
East Palo Alto.
Kaslewicz cited Stanford's neutrality,
facilities and cooperative SEAS group as
the primary reasons it was chosen to host
the fair
"This is an opportunity for Stanford not
to be an island, not an isolated tower, but
rather to be connected," she said. "Stan
ford can show that it cares to build connec
tions with surrounding groups."
Bay Area Action Network initiated
Earth Day 1993 as a follow-up to the 1990
event, which was an international effort to
stimulate awareness, confirm commit
ment to the earth and focus on the chang
ing needs of the '90s.
But Earth Day at Stanford will have a
much narrower focus, SEAS coordinator
Abdi Soltani said — to incorporate an envi
ronmental awareness into the daily lives of

individuals, organizations and businesses
in the Bay Area.
Earth Day 1993 is to be the first of an
nual Earth Day fairs at Stanford,
Kaslewicz said. It will be an all-day, free-of
charge event featuring shows by nationally
known musicians as well as acoustic per
formers, rappers, a cappella groups and
possibly even the Stanford Band.
On the educational side, there will be
hands-on interactive booths, theme infor
mation areas like "The Clean and Green
House" and "Ecosystems on Earth," sever
al speakers and areas to view videos and
slide presentations.
Earth Day coordinators want to host the
event on the intramural fields, but
Kaslewicz said the site has not yet been
confirmed.
The Earth Day Advisory Committee —
which includes former University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy — is hoping that

Stanford's administration will make Earth
Day 1993 a priority, she added.
Despite the excitement surrounding
Earth Day, some members of SEAS said
they worried people will come to the Earth
Day fair, feel good about themselves and
then leave without making any sort of
change or commitment to the environment.
The SEAS Earth Day Group, led by
Soltani and Michael Cohen, has responded
by gearing the fair toward practical and on
going changes.
"The booths will be very informative,"
Soltani said. "For example, the Clean and
Green House will feature products one can
buy that are environmentally safe to re
place a currently used, damaging product.
Other booths will inform visitors about or
ganic agriculture, for example."
