# Attention tree huggers: Stanford to host Earth Day 1993

Thousands of people will flood the cam
pus in April when Stanford hosts Bay Area
Earth Day 1993, a $75,000 environmental
extravaganza featuring live entertainment
and educational booths.
Performers Joan Baez, Bonnie Raitt
and Los Lobos have been invited, along
with speakers such as "Diet for a New
America" author John Robbins, Sierra
Club executive director Karl Pope and
Pulitzer Prize-winner Wallace Stegner.
Senator Barbara Boxer and Representa
tive Anna Eshoo are also hoping to appear
at the April 17 event, according to Holly
Kaslewicz, co-director of Earth Day at
Stanford and executive director of Bay
Area Action Network.
The event is expected to draw up to
10,000 people, she said, and is a combined
effort of Students for Environmental Ac

tion at Stanford, Bay Area Action Network
and the city governments of Palo Alto and
East Palo Alto.
Kaslewicz cited Stanford's neutrality,
facilities and cooperative SEAS group as
the primary reasons it was chosen to host
the fair
"This is an opportunity for Stanford not
to be an island, not an isolated tower, but
rather to be connected," she said. "Stan
ford can show that it cares to build connec
tions with surrounding groups."
Bay Area Action Network initiated
Earth Day 1993 as a follow-up to the 1990
event, which was an international effort to
stimulate awareness, confirm commit
ment to the earth and focus on the chang
ing needs of the '90s.
But Earth Day at Stanford will have a
much narrower focus, SEAS coordinator
Abdi Soltani said — to incorporate an envi
ronmental awareness into the daily lives of

individuals, organizations and businesses
in the Bay Area.
Earth Day 1993 is to be the first of an
nual Earth Day fairs at Stanford,
Kaslewicz said. It will be an all-day, free-of
charge event featuring shows by nationally
known musicians as well as acoustic per
formers, rappers, a cappella groups and
possibly even the Stanford Band.
On the educational side, there will be
hands-on interactive booths, theme infor
mation areas like "The Clean and Green
House" and "Ecosystems on Earth," sever
al speakers and areas to view videos and
slide presentations.
Earth Day coordinators want to host the
event on the intramural fields, but
Kaslewicz said the site has not yet been
confirmed.
The Earth Day Advisory Committee —
which includes former University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy — is hoping that

Stanford's administration will make Earth
Day 1993 a priority, she added.
Despite the excitement surrounding
Earth Day, some members of SEAS said
they worried people will come to the Earth
Day fair, feel good about themselves and
then leave without making any sort of
change or commitment to the environment.
The SEAS Earth Day Group, led by
Soltani and Michael Cohen, has responded
by gearing the fair toward practical and on
going changes.
"The booths will be very informative,"
Soltani said. "For example, the Clean and
Green House will feature products one can
buy that are environmentally safe to re
place a currently used, damaging product.
Other booths will inform visitors about or
ganic agriculture, for example."
A month of programs
Pre-Earth Day projects will pave the

way for the Stanford event. An Earth Day
Benefit Run sponsored by the city of Palo
Alto, a lecture series at Stanford and a
youth creative writing contest have been
scheduled.
Follow-up activities will also be publi
cized at the Earth Day event, encouraging
visitors to sign up and make a personal
commitment to preservation.
Post-Earth Day programs include com
munity workshops in composting and
urban gardening with Palo Alto Historical
Society, a tree planting day with Magic
Inc., volunteer orientation sessions at spe
cific organizations, nature hikes, a Bay
lands cleanup and a wetlands tour.
The precursor projects, Earth Day at
Stanford and the follow-up activities com
prise what is known as Bay Area Earth
Month. The calendar of this month has pri-
