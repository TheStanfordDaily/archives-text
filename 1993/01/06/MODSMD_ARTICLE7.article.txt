Experts from India and the United States — in
cluding the present and former Indian ambassadors
to the United States and the Indian representative
to the United Nations — will gather at Stanford this
summer to discuss the future of Indo-Americans in
both countries.
A three-day conference devoted to Indo-Ameri
can issues will be held the week after finals, from
June 15 to 17.
"Our basic goal is to establish a national audi
ence. . . of people who have an interest in the Indo-
American people," said senior Anita Goel, chairper
son of the event.
The first day will include "a focus on the econom
ic and cultural problems that we will face in the fu
ture," she said. "We will also examine how we are re
lating to other minorities in the United States."
"We will also establish a political agenda of Indo-
American interests," said Goel, in order to "unify
our support of leaders in this country."
In addition there will be "a series of workshops on
harnessing the community's economic interests for
development and integration into America," she said.
The other two days of the conference will include
round-table sessions regarding the Indian conti
nent.
This portion of the meeting will primarily
investigate ways in which the communities in
India can be unified with those in the United
States, she added.
The conference will include "many world
renowned figures," Goel said. In addition, she said
there will be "a caucus of Indo-Americans along
with cultural and business leaders from India."
A decision has not been reached on whether the
conference will be open to the public, she said.
Goel added that feedback from the Stanford com
munity is greatly desired. "We would like to know
students' reactions and suggestions for the event,"
she said.
