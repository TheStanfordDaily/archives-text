# Delivery droid avoids the Noid

As Stanford students grit their teeth and look
up up their grades on Axess, they may wonder if
they accomplished anything at all last quarter.
One group of dedicated students, however, will not
have to worry. If nothing else, they taught a robot
how to deliver a pizza.
C 5222: Autonomous Systems is one of a hand
ful of classes in the country in which undergradu
ates and graduate students can learn how to pro
gram a robot using the computer language LISP.
Offered every fall quarter, the class, taught by
Prof. Mike Genesereth, teaches students the fun
damentals of programming "autonomous sys
tems," physical systems that operate without
human assistance.
Using Macintosh Powerbooks and two identical
Nomad 100 mobile robots, students learned how to
program basic robot behaviors, culminating in the
final project: the robot pizza delivery competition.
During the competition, four of five program
ming teams squared off in two semifinal rounds,
culminating in a final matchup between the top
two teams.
Placing the two robots at opposite ends of a
symmetrical maze made of white cardboard boxes,
the teams started their programs as the robots re
ceived "pizza orders" via radio modem from a cen
tral dispatch computer.
The two robots then competed with each other
to find their way around the maze in order to pick
up and deliver the most "pizzas," represented by
numbered notecards, in the shortest amount of
time.
"The robots had a representation of the world
in the form of a map given to them five minutes be
fore the competition began," teaching assistant
Illah Nourbakhsh explained. "The programs de
signed by students work for any map."
