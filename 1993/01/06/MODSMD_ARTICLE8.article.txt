# Delivery droid avoids the Noid
## 
### Jennifer Cho Staff writer 
As Stanford students grit their teeth and look
up up their grades on Axess, they may wonder if
they accomplished anything at all last quarter.
One group of dedicated students, however, will not
have to worry. If nothing else, they taught a robot
how to deliver a pizza.
C 5222: Autonomous Systems is one of a hand
ful of classes in the country in which undergradu
ates and graduate students can learn how to pro
gram a robot using the computer language LISP.
Offered every fall quarter, the class, taught by
Prof. Mike Genesereth, teaches students the fun
damentals of programming "autonomous sys
tems," physical systems that operate without
human assistance.
Using Macintosh Powerbooks and two identical
Nomad 100 mobile robots, students learned how to
program basic robot behaviors, culminating in the
final project: the robot pizza delivery competition.
During the competition, four of five program
ming teams squared off in two semifinal rounds,
culminating in a final matchup between the top
two teams.
Placing the two robots at opposite ends of a
symmetrical maze made of white cardboard boxes,
the teams started their programs as the robots re
ceived "pizza orders" via radio modem from a cen
tral dispatch computer.
The two robots then competed with each other
to find their way around the maze in order to pick
up and deliver the most "pizzas," represented by
numbered notecards, in the shortest amount of
time.
"The robots had a representation of the world
in the form of a map given to them five minutes be
fore the competition began," teaching assistant
Illah Nourbakhsh explained. "The programs de
signed by students work for any map."

the Computer Science 222 "pizza delivery" competition.
As the robot interacts with
its surroundings, it can add to
the original map, putting up or
removing barriers in its memo
ry as it encounters them.
Physically, the Nomad 100
robots bear a strong resem
blance to R2D2, from the "Star
Wars" movies. Designed by
former C 5222 students,
Nomad 100 stands roughly two
and a half feet high and has
wheels attached to its under
side which allow it to move and
change directions.

The robot competi
tion was an oppor
tunity for students
to pull out all the
stops and abandon
the Honor Code.

Nomad 100 "sees" through
four types of sensors it has to
the outside world. In addition
to radio modem, Nomad 100
can measure its distance from
nearby objects through 16
sonar detectors and 16 infrared
detectors along its circumfer
ence. A tactile sensor, or
bumper, near its wheels lets it
know when it hits another
object, so it can change direc
tion.
The robot competition was
an opportunity for students to
pull out all the stops and aban
don the Honor Code.
"Anything is legal in the
competition that these robots
are capable of performing,"
Genesereth announced at the
beginning of the competition.
"Ramming of robots is perfect
ly acceptable, and so is sending
out incorrect messages."
The team which could
anticipate such events and
program behaviors to perform
in each case would most likely
win this "contest of controlled
software design," as described
by Genesereth.
The competition was also
one in which creativity was
encouraged. The winner, team
Tortoise, strapped bicycle
reflectors around its Nomad
100 to confuse the infrared
detectors of its opponents.
This tactic proved to be suc
cessful, as Tortoise lured KCS,
the second-place team, away
from a pizza.
While Nomad 100 was
mostly fun and games at this
competition, robots have been
utilized in the industrial sec
tor for years for more serious
purposes.
"Often you want an
autonomous, robust non
human to do the work in situa
tions which pose human dan
ger or where you want very
high precision," Nourbakhsh
said.
"Ethically, I think the most
important area in which
robots are doing something
good is where work is rote,
repetitive and uninteresting.
It lets people do more interest

ing things."
Similarly, former T.A.
David Zhu hopes to see people
benefit from autonomous sys
tems. Nomad 100 is actually a
prototype he and former stu
dent Jim Slater designed as a
C 5222 project three years ago.
Today, Zhu and Slater own
Nomadic Technologies, Inc., a
company which produces
Nomad 100 and the newer
Nomad 200, in addition to
other models used in compa
nies in several countries,
including Japan and Italy.
"People look at [robots] like
people looked at computers 20
years ago, as something very
esoteric and very difficult to
use," Zhu said. "We want to
change that and make them as
easy to use as a Macintosh is
today."
But at present program
ming robots is a delicate task.
It requires a knowledge of how
a robot senses its surround
ings and makes decisions.
C 5222 teaches students both
the low level and high level
planning involved in program
ming autonomous systems.
"Low level planning is a
very reactive, simple behavior,
like a reflex," explained Nour
bakhsh. Behaviors such as
tracking moving objects, mov
ing away from objects and cor
ridor-following are character
istic of low level planning.
"High level planning
involves going around walls,
figuring out how to get from
one place to another and how
to deal with a blockade, in
which case, the robot must
replan," Nourbakhsh said.
Basically, low level plan
ning can be described as the
means by which a robot gets
from one point to another, and
high level planning tells the
robot the best way to go about
doing it.
Nomad 100 does not func
tion perfectly. Described by
Zhu as "mechanically and sen
sory limited," the robots
appeared to be confused, or
"lost" several times during the
competition and no longer
continued to move along the
correct path.
A robot gets "lost" because
of flaws in low level planning
and inaccurate or poor sensory
input. It may "see" another
robot with its infrared sensors
and think it is a wall, therefore
adding a wall to its representa
tion of the world and eventual
ly trapping itself.
Throughout out the class,
programming projects chal
lenged students to design fea
sible low level architectures
that would interact successful
ly with high level planning. An
earlier project stressed cooper
ation, instead of competition,
where communication
between the two robots was
necessary in order to complete
the required task.
Besides being a one-of-its
kind class, C 5222 is a "good
way to show that robots are a
good vehicle for low level
architecture and high level
planning and an effective way
to introduce people to
autonomous systems," added
Nourbakhsh.

detectors of its opponents.
This tactic proved to be suc
cessful, as Tortoise lured KCS,
the second-place team, away
from a pizza.
While Nomad 100 was
mostly fun and games at this
competition, robots have been
utilized in the industrial sec
tor for years for more serious
purposes.
"Often you want an
autonomous, robust non
human to do the work in situa
tions which pose human dan
ger or where you want very
high precision," Nourbakhsh
said.
"Ethically, I think the most
important area in which
robots are doing something
good is where work is rote,
repetitive and uninteresting.
It lets people do more interest

ing things."
Similarly, former T.A.
David Zhu hopes to see people
benefit from autonomous sys
tems. Nomad 100 is actually a
prototype he and former stu
dent Jim Slater designed as a
C 5222 project three years ago.
Today, Zhu and Slater own
Nomadic Technologies, Inc., a
company which produces
Nomad 100 and the newer
Nomad 200, in addition to
other models used in compa
nies in several countries,
including Japan and Italy.
"People look at [robots] like
people looked at computers 20
years ago, as something very
esoteric and very difficult to
use," Zhu said. "We want to
change that and make them as
easy to use as a Macintosh is
today."
But at present program
ming robots is a delicate task.
It requires a knowledge of how
a robot senses its surround
ings and makes decisions.
C 5222 teaches students both
the low level and high level
planning involved in program
ming autonomous systems.
"Low level planning is a
very reactive, simple behavior,
like a reflex," explained Nour
bakhsh. Behaviors such as
tracking moving objects, mov
ing away from objects and cor
ridor-following are character
istic of low level planning.
"High level planning
involves going around walls,
figuring out how to get from
one place to another and how
to deal with a blockade, in
which case, the robot must
replan," Nourbakhsh said.
Basically, low level plan
ning can be described as the
means by which a robot gets
from one point to another, and
high level planning tells the
robot the best way to go about
doing it.
Nomad 100 does not func
tion perfectly. Described by
Zhu as "mechanically and sen
sory limited," the robots
appeared to be confused, or
"lost" several times during the
competition and no longer
continued to move along the
correct path.
A robot gets "lost" because
of flaws in low level planning
and inaccurate or poor sensory
input. It may "see" another
robot with its infrared sensors
and think it is a wall, therefore
adding a wall to its representa
tion of the world and eventual
ly trapping itself.
Throughout out the class,
programming projects chal
lenged students to design fea
sible low level architectures
that would interact successful
ly with high level planning. An
earlier project stressed cooper
ation, instead of competition,
where communication
between the two robots was
necessary in order to complete
the required task.
Besides being a one-of-its
kind class, C 5222 is a "good
way to show that robots are a
good vehicle for low level
architecture and high level
planning and an effective way
to introduce people to
autonomous systems," added
Nourbakhsh.
As Stanford students grit their teeth and look
up up their grades on Axess, they may wonder if
they accomplished anything at all last quarter.
One group of dedicated students, however, will not
have to worry. If nothing else, they taught a robot
how to deliver a pizza.
C 5222: Autonomous Systems is one of a hand
ful of classes in the country in which undergradu
ates and graduate students can learn how to pro
gram a robot using the computer language LISP.
Offered every fall quarter, the class, taught by
Prof. Mike Genesereth, teaches students the fun
damentals of programming "autonomous sys
tems," physical systems that operate without
human assistance.
Using Macintosh Powerbooks and two identical
Nomad 100 mobile robots, students learned how to
program basic robot behaviors, culminating in the
final project: the robot pizza delivery competition.
During the competition, four of five program
ming teams squared off in two semifinal rounds,
culminating in a final matchup between the top
two teams.
Placing the two robots at opposite ends of a
symmetrical maze made of white cardboard boxes,
the teams started their programs as the robots re
ceived "pizza orders" via radio modem from a cen
tral dispatch computer.
The two robots then competed with each other
to find their way around the maze in order to pick
up and deliver the most "pizzas," represented by
numbered notecards, in the shortest amount of
time.
"The robots had a representation of the world
in the form of a map given to them five minutes be
fore the competition began," teaching assistant
Illah Nourbakhsh explained. "The programs de
signed by students work for any map."

lllah Nourbakhsh demonstrates the Nomad 100, the robot used in
the Computer Science 222 "pizza delivery" competition.
As the robot interacts with
its surroundings, it can add to
the original map, putting up or
removing barriers in its memo
ry as it encounters them.
Physically, the Nomad 100
robots bear a strong resem
blance to R2D2, from the "Star
Wars" movies. Designed by
former C 5222 students,
Nomad 100 stands roughly two
and a half feet high and has
wheels attached to its under
side which allow it to move and
change directions.

The robot competi
tion was an oppor
tunity for students
to pull out all the
stops and abandon
the Honor Code.

Nomad 100 "sees" through
four types of sensors it has to
the outside world. In addition
to radio modem, Nomad 100
can measure its distance from
nearby objects through 16
sonar detectors and 16 infrared
detectors along its circumfer
ence. A tactile sensor, or
bumper, near its wheels lets it
know when it hits another
object, so it can change direc
tion.
The robot competition was
an opportunity for students to
pull out all the stops and aban
don the Honor Code.
"Anything is legal in the
competition that these robots
are capable of performing,"
Genesereth announced at the
beginning of the competition.
"Ramming of robots is perfect
ly acceptable, and so is sending
out incorrect messages."
The team which could
anticipate such events and
program behaviors to perform
in each case would most likely
win this "contest of controlled
software design," as described
by Genesereth.
The competition was also
one in which creativity was
encouraged. The winner, team
Tortoise, strapped bicycle
reflectors around its Nomad
100 to confuse the infrared
detectors of its opponents.
This tactic proved to be suc
cessful, as Tortoise lured KCS,
the second-place team, away
from a pizza.
