# Campus disabled access still inadequate, students say
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Although all newly constructed University build
ings are equipped with disabled-access ramps and spe
cial handrails, these structures are not always fully
accessible to the disabled, say many disabled students.
The decision to provide disabled access on only
the first floor in newly constructed residences such
as Kimball Hall, Lantana and Costano has been a
subject of frustration for many members of the dis
abled community. This limited access, they say, has
failed to address the social needs of students who use
wheelchairs.
Not being able to visit people on the second and
third floors is isolating to students who use
wheelchairs — especially freshmen, who are just try
ing to establish their group of friends — said Adri
ana Duffy.
"It doesn't really work to call up people and tell
them to come to your room," said Duffy, who uses a
wheelchair. "It's just not the way things happen. It
constrains what we can do."

But, according to Disability Resource Center pro
gram coordinator John Asheim, the recently enacted
Americans with Disabilities Act only outlines
requirements for first-floor accessibility in build
ings.
"Under the strict letter of the law, the University
is not required to install elevators as long as all ele
ments of the program are accessible," Asheim said.
Duffy, who graduated last quarter, said she
acknowledged that installing and retrofitting eleva
tors is costly, especially in a time of budget cuts.
However, living in a dorm which is only first floor
accessible poses many inconveniences and limita
tions for students who use wheelchairs.
"I find it really incredible," said Duffy. "The Uni
versity's so into Res Ed and learning from other stu
dents, but they still have no qualms about excluding
a whole group from interacting with other people."
She pointed out that in Kimball, the cost of an ele
vator would have been 1 percent of the total cost of
building the residence.
Ashiem pointed out that often there are more
issues involved with access than just compliance

with the law. What is accessible is not always conve
nient, he said.
For example, it may be more convenient to install
an automatic door opener for wheelchair users in the
back of a dorm building, but these students would be
forced to enter through the back door every time
they wanted to get into the building.
While the University Project Office usually hires
a consultant to determine compliance with laws such
as Americans with Disabilities Act, issues that go
beyond the law are now determined by The Housing
Policy Group.
Asheim represents the DRC on the committee,
which is made up of Housing and Facilities Office
directors. The group is in the process of "hammering
out" policies about accessibility.
The group has already recommended that the
Knoll and all new subsequent student housing be
made vertically accessible.
Asheim said the new Knoll residences will have at
least two elevators.
However, he pointed out that after the Knoll is
constructed there will probably not be any new resi

dences being built for some time, and that because
the Knoll is on a hill, many wheelchair users will
find it difficult to get to and from the residence.
Members of the disabled community say the
Knoll decision may have been a response to students
who were upset that new dorms like Kimball were
not equipped with elevators.
The policy group now faces challenges regarding
the retrofitting of existing dorms to be accessible or
more accessible, Asheim said.
It has already been determined that when Wilbur
is remodeled this summer, the first floor will be
made accessible. And, since Toyon will be used for
summer housing this year, its first floor will also be
made accessible.
However, because of limited funds, University
planners are being forced to choose between
retrofitting more buildings to make them first-floor
accessible, and retrofitting buildings with elevators.
Funding is especially a problem for existing build
ings because donors are usually more eager to fund
new residences. "You can't put your name on a
remodeling job or an elevator," Asheim said.
