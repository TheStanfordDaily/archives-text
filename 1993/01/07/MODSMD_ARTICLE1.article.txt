## Rats, bugs attracted to food left in Green destroying books 
### Sarah Nagae 
Increasing numbers of stu
dents are eating in Green Li
brary, librarians say, and what
they leave behind has been at
tracting insects and rodents that
have attacked books.
"Crumbs and greasy fingers of
those actually eating while read
ing" cause direct damage to ma
terials, said Connie Brooks, head
of the preservation department.
She even recalled that a piece of
American cheese was once found
as a bookmark.
But a greater potential danger
posed by consumption of food in
the libraries is the damage in
flicted by cockroaches, silverfish
and rats.
These pests, originally at
tracted by soda, chips and other
leftovers, later turn to the books
themselves. They not only chew
through pages but also eat away
at bindings, destroying entire
books.
Technically, eating is not al
lowed in the library. But "it's
amazing how much is left —
cans, candy wrappers, full
course meals, baked potatoes,
you name it," Brooks said.
The problem is worst during
dead week and finals. Students
holed up in Green's depths do not
take the time to walk outside, in
stead leaving their garbage on
the desks, she said.
"Students do not really under
stand how attractive a can of
Coke can be to these insects,"

Brooks said. "Some people just
leave them sitting in the
shelves."
Not only are bugs immediate
ly attracted to soda, but these
cans are inevitably knocked over,
their contents spilling into the
books on lower shelves.
"Luckily, we have not been
cursed with a big infestation
yet," Brooks said, but numerous
insect-eaten books have been
found. While rats and other ro
dents are not currently a major
concern, librarians fear that the
problem could become worse if

food continues to be brought to
and consumed in the libraries.
Some insects are naturally at
tracted to the cellulose in paper
and the protein in binding adhe
sive, Brooks said. Food left be
hind in the library only makes
the problem worse.
The library staff hopes it will
not have to use such drastic mea
sures such as extermination, as
the chemical pollutants in pesti
cides themselves can cause dam
age both to the library materials
and to humans.
The preservation department,

which is also responsible for reg
ulating temperature in the li
braries and rebinding damaged
books, hopes to educate library
users about the problems caused
by food and cans.
Through the use of displays
and by distributing literature,
they hope to spread an awareness
of the severity of the problem so
those tempted to munch while
studying will think twice. A dis
play in the lobby of Green library
advises students to "Take your
break outside the library —
starve a bug."
