# Fish, bunnies, and other Farm animals
## Students keep pets in residences despite penalties

Students are not allowed to
house any pets within the resi
dences. You will be charged $100
per day. All damage by pets will
be charged to the owner, if
known, and the house, if owner
cannot be identified.

Judging from the literal
plethora of fauna that can be
found all over the Stanford cam
pus, the joy of owning a pet
exceeds the possible conse
quences that might befall stu
dents living in campus dorms.
Just ask "Chris," a junior
who keeps four fish tanks in his
room, ranging in weight from
eighty to four hundred pounds
each. Despite the fact that Chris
is "not very good at keeping
them alive," and has "gone
through about forty-five fish,"
he enjoys watching the little
suckers swish around the tank.
"If the pet is suited for dorm
life and it is fair to the animal
and the people around you, then
it should be allowed," said Chris,
the proud owner of eight live fish
right now, including some
Oscars and goldfish, plus a small
aquarium frog. "The fish liven
up the room. At night the peace
ful sound of running water helps
me and my roommate to fall
asleep."
"Jim," the proud owner of a
mini lop-eared rabbit named
Bob, also extolled his pet's
appeal; the four-and-a-half
pound creature is almost thera
peutic for Jim and his friends.
"There is a lot of good out of
having Bob. He's small, fuzzy
and won't assign homework,"
said Jim.
Among his many furry and
amorous qualities, he is toilet
trained,("everyone's amazed
that he doesn't smell," interject
ed Jim), can go for walks on a
leash, and proves to be a valu
able listening companion.
"[My roommate] talks to Bob
more than he talks to me," he
added.
Every student in Murray
House is able to enjoy having a
pet, thanks to their resident fel
lows, the Weisbergs. They own a
seven-year-old bearded collie
named Maxine Moonshine who

actually lives inside the resi
dence with the students. The
Weisbergs' daughter, Elizabeth,
explained that "the apartment is
pretty small so 'Max' usually
hangs in the dorm," while their
cat remains mostly outdoors.
Max has more or less become
Murray's mascot and appears on
the dorm T-shirt. "Some people
think she's stupid," said Eliza
beth, "because Max often walks
into walls due to the long hair
that gets in her eyes." She is also
occasionally sprayed by skunks.
Faults aside, though, "lots of
people love her," said Elizabeth,
who feels that the collie is a
member of the dorm and that
Murray would not be the same
without her.
Others, like Berny Chen, a
senior living in Crothers Memo
rial, have chosen a different
option for a means of companion

ship. Chen is the proud owner of
a Chia Pet and an ant farm.
He purchased his Chia Teddy
Bear, fondly referred to as
"Homey," at Walgreen's during
his sophomore year. "It was an
investment. I wanted to see if
it's really the pottery that
grows," explained Chen. He has
had two unsuccessful seed plant
ings that ended in mold and a
dead ceramic pet. Despite the
"long and arduous process"
planting a Chia may be, Chen is
planning to mount a third
attempt this quarter.
Unlike Chris and Jim, not all
of Chen's friends like Homey the
way he does. His roommate from
last year recently hired a Chia
assassin to wipe out his friend.
Luckily the plot failed, although
Chen has heard new rumors of
putting red dye in Homey's
water supply. After such

threats, Chen is still concerned
for Homey's safety, and hopes he
lasts until graduation.
Chen's other pet, the Rebel
Ant, was the sole survivor of a
pack of fifteen ants ordered in
the mail for $1.50. Providing
hours of entertainment, the
light tan insect mindlessly digs
around a green silo, windmill,
and farmhouse.
"It's wrong to deny students
the companionship of reason
ably-sized pets as long as they
are not disturbing others," said
Chen.
Jim, Chris, Elizabeth also
agreed that the present restric
tion against pets is unfair and
should be modified.
However, as the rule stands
now, Chris commented, "I don't
see how they can enforce it. Peo
ple are going to [have pets] any
way."

the dorm T-shirt. "Some people
think she's stupid," said Eliza
beth, "because Max often walks
into walls due to the long hair
that gets in her eyes." She is also
occasionally sprayed by skunks.
Faults aside, though, "lots of
people love her," said Elizabeth,
who feels that the collie is a
member of the dorm and that
Murray would not be the same
without her.
Others, like Berny Chen, a
senior living in Crothers Memo
rial, have chosen a different
option for a means of companion

ship. Chen is the proud owner of
a Chia Pet and an ant farm.
He purchased his Chia Teddy
Bear, fondly referred to as
"Homey," at Walgreen's during
his sophomore year. "It was an
investment. I wanted to see if
it's really the pottery that
grows," explained Chen. He has
had two unsuccessful seed plant
ings that ended in mold and a
dead ceramic pet. Despite the
"long and arduous process"
planting a Chia may be, Chen is
planning to mount a third
attempt this quarter.
Unlike Chris and Jim, not all
of Chen's friends like Homey the
way he does. His roommate from
last year recently hired a Chia
assassin to wipe out his friend.
Luckily the plot failed, although
Chen has heard new rumors of
putting red dye in Homey's
water supply. After such

threats, Chen is still concerned
for Homey's safety, and hopes he
lasts until graduation.
Chen's other pet, the Rebel
Ant, was the sole survivor of a
pack of fifteen ants ordered in
the mail for $1.50. Providing
hours of entertainment, the
light tan insect mindlessly digs
around a green silo, windmill,
and farmhouse.
"It's wrong to deny students
the companionship of reason
ably-sized pets as long as they
are not disturbing others," said
Chen.
Jim, Chris, Elizabeth also
agreed that the present restric
tion against pets is unfair and
should be modified.
However, as the rule stands
now, Chris commented, "I don't
see how they can enforce it. Peo
ple are going to [have pets] any
way."

"Bob," a mini lop-eared rabbit, is one of several pets kept by students. He can be walked on a leash,
he's toilet trained, and he's even willing to listen to problems.
