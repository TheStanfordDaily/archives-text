## Iraq given new U.N. warning 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
The United States and its allies
in the United Nations yesterday
gave Baghdad 48 hours to
remove its missiles from the
edge of a no-fly zone in southern
Iraq or risk military retaliation.
The ultimatum, delivered to
Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Ham
doon, was drafted by the United
States, France, Britain and
Russia — four of the five per
manent members of the Securi
ty Council. China is the other
member.
The four nations also
demanded that Iraq not use the
missiles' radar units to target
American planes. The ultima
tum took effect immediately
after Hamdoon received the
document at 5:30 p.m. EST.
Iraq is accused of moving the
equipment to the edge of a no
fly zone established in southern
Iraq after the Persian Gulf War
to protect rebel Shiite Muslims.
A U.S. demand could set the
stage for another clash with
Saddam Hussein before Presi
dent Bush leaves office in two
weeks. Just last month an Iraqi
MiG was shot down over south
ern Iraq.
"There is agreement on the
need for Iraq to comply fully
with the U.N. resolutions and

the no-fly zone," said Richard A.
Boucher, the State Department
spokesman.
Accusing Iraq of intimidating
American planes, he said "we
are ensuring that the Iraqis are
left in no doubt about the
importance of strict adherence
to the terms of the no-fly zone."
Senate Democratic Leader
George J. Mitchell of Maine said
after a meeting with President
Bush at the White House that
"no decision has been made
with respect to any of the
options available to the Presi
dent."
"The President indicated he
is consulting with our allies, has
made no decision, is weighing
all options," Mitchell said.
House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley of Washington said the
Iraqi surface-to-air missiles
pose a potential threat to U.S.
aircraft. "I think the President
is concerned about the situation
with American fliers who are
being asked to enforce the no-fly
zone in the area."
Hussein, in a speech broad
cast in Iraq, said his army "is
the army of all the
Arabs. . . .From this distin
guished and honorable history,
we draw great confidence in the
readiness of this army of believ

ers and in its unwavering ability
to confront aggression."
An ultimatum would be
based on U.N. Security Council
resolutions that authorize all
necessary means to ensure the
Iraqi people are not subjected to
abuses by his regime, said two
officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
Presidential spokesman Mar
lin Fitzwater said, "we do not
intend to tolerate continued vio
lations" of the U.N. resolutions
imposed on Iraq after the Per
sian Gulf War.
"All options are open,"
Bush's spokesman said.
The southern zone was estab
lished in August by the United
States, Britain and France to
protect the Shiite population
from Hussein, whose secular
rule is at odds with their quest
for a government based on the
Muslim religion.
The missiles are capable of
attacking allied military aircraft
patrolling the no-fly zone. Pen
tagon sources said Tuesday that
Iraq had been told not to aim
anti-aircraft radar at U.S. fight
ers.
Pointing the radars at an air
plane is considered a hostile act,
and one that warns pilots they
may be under attack.
