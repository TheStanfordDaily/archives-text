# Bush breaks a bleak budget
## $292B deficit, but Clinton reaffirms budget-cutting pledge 
### 
WASHIGTON (AP) — President Bush, in a final
and gloomy budget outline released yesterday, pre
dicted unrelentingly huge federal deficits and
underscored how difficult it may be for President
elect Clinton to fulfill his economic promises.
Clinton, who after Jan. 20 will submit the budget
Congress will actually work on, called the figures
projected yesterday by Bush "unsettling." But he
signaled that he was not abandoning his campaign
commitments to cut the deficit in half by 1996 while
at the same time embarking on an ambitious pro
gram to "rebuild America" through stepped-up gov
ernment investment.
"We can now see the full magnitude of the debt
we inherit and the challenge that we must con
front," Clinton said. "This sounds the final warning
bell. This endless pattern of rising deficits must
stop."
In sending his last, bare-bones budget to
Congress, Bush projected spending of $1.52 trillion
for the 1994 fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, an
increase of 3.2 percent, with a projected deficit of
$292 billion.
Bush estimated that the deficit for the current
1993 fiscal year would hit a record $327.3 billion —

a far cry from the small surplus that Bush had
promised to achieve by this time when he took
office.
Bush's document was met with scorn by
Democrats in Congress.
"This submission is not a budget," said Senate
Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-
Tenn. "It really is an irrelevance. It's a confusing
irrelevance."
He said Bush's budget forecasts contained lots of
phony numbers to make the deficit look smaller,
just as past Bush spending plans have.
"It's just the same song, but happily it's the last
verse."
Clinton spokesman George Stephanopoulos said
Clinton "stands by his campaign commitments,"
including his pledge to cut the deficit in half. The
new deficit estimates will make achieving that
pledge "more difficult but just as necessary,"
Stephanopoulos said.
But Sasser questioned whether Clinton could do it.
"Given the much larger deficit projections, the
president-elect will have a very difficult if not impos
sible task of cutting the deficit in half," Sasser told
reporters.
