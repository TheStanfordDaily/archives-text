# The 						state of California: tax breaks and a $7.5B deficit
## Wilson's State-of-the-State 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov. Pete Wilson yester
day proposed new tax breaks and incentives for small
businesses to create new jobs and "rebuild Califor
nia."
In his annual State-of-the-State address to the
California Legislature, the Republican governor

ruled out tax increases to balance
an expected deficit of at least $7.5
billion in the state budget and
repeated his determination to let
a temporary half-cent of the
statewide 7 1/4-cent sales tax
expire next July 1.
He also announced the creation
of a Council of Economic Policy
Advisors that will be headed by
Distinguished Hoover Fellow and
former Secretary of State George
Shultz.
"California is in crisis. We have
lost 800,000 jobs. At least one in
10 Californians is out of work,"
he told the joint session of the
state Senate and Assembly and a
statewide television and radio
audience.

He said that while the recession is ending nation
ally, Californians are still losing jobs or live in fear of
losing them.
"We must rebuild California, job, by job, by job,"
Wilson said. "To do that, California must start eas
ing the burden on job-creators. We can't have
employees without employers. You can't love jobs
and hate job-creators.
"If we are to create new jobs, we'll have to do
more than reject higher taxes. If we are to create
jobs, we'll have to cut taxes," he continued. He asked
the Legislature to enact a series of tax cuts designed
to encourage small businesses to open or expand.
Specifically, Wilson asked the lawmakers to:
• Increase the research and development tax cred
it, currently at 8 percent, to 12 percent for businesses.
• Enact a small-business investment tax credit of
at least 4 percent, with bigger credits of up to 16 per

cent for longer-term investments in small businesses.
• Double the current small business loan guaran
tee program from 300 to 600 loans.
• Create a state task force to help California busi
nesses market environmental cleanup technologies
in other nations.

• Create the Council of Economic
Policy Advisors, chaired by Shultz.
Wilson also raised the possibility
of a sales tax exemption for the pur
chase of manufacturing equipment,
but didn't specifically endorse the
idea. He said he would ask Shultz's
council to study the idea and make
recommendations to the state.
Aides estimated direct tax rev
enue losses at $155 million for the
expanded research and develop
ment tax credit and $30 million for
the small business investment tax
credit. They estimated the cost of
expanding the small business loan
guarantee program at $2 million.
Wilson didn't say what state
spending he would cut to finance
the proposed tax incentives or to

erase the expected deficit. Aides said he expected
the tax cuts to pay for themselves by stimulating
the economy.
Wilson made only a few general references to his
state budget, which is to be unveiled tomorrow. He
said the state "cannot pay for all the increased ser
vices we are asked to provide."
SHe also made only passing reference to the work
ers' compensation reforms he has sought for two
years in an effort to reduce the burden on California
businesses.
"We moved closer last year, but failed to reform a
corrupt, costly and terribly unfair system of work
ers' compensation," Wilson said. "Let's reform this
corrupt system. Let's get the job done."
Wilson also used the speech to announce that he
will submit his long-delayed growth-management
plan to the Legislature this year.
