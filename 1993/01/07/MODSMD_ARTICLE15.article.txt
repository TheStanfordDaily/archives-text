Bush can't kill e-mail
WASHINGTON <AP) - A federal judge
ordered the Archivist of the United States yester
day to act immediately to assure that records on
White House computers are not destroyed before
President Bush leaves office.
U.S. District Court Judge Charles R. Richey
ordered the preservation of computer backup
tapes of electronic mail messages generated dur
ing the Bush and Reagan administrations.
Richey said the current White House guide
lines are "inadequate, arbitrary, capricious and
contrary to law in that they permit the destruc
tion of records."
The White House had contended that e-mail
messages are not federal records once a paper
copy has been printed and so don't have to be
saved.

The judge, however, noted that the printed
copies seldom contain all the information that
was in the computer, such has who received the
information or otherwise had access to it and
when.
Gillespie, Nureyev dead
(AP) — They pursued their art with intensity,
grace and showmanship — Dizzy Gillespie and
Rudolf Nureyev, the master of jazz and the mas
ter of ballet who both died yesterday.
Nureyev, who had been suffering from AIDS,
died at age 54 in a Paris hospital of what his doc
tor described as a "cardiac complication following
a cruel illness."
Gillespie died in his sleep at Englewood, N.J.,
Hospital, where he was being treated for pancre
atic cancer. He was 75.
