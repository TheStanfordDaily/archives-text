## Person of the Year 
### 
Bill Walsh has earned
title with his class and
success on the field

Bill walsh, american
hero. Displaying the admirable
qualities of an Army graduate
— discipline, honesty, responsibility,
success — Walsh made a triumphant
return to Stanford University last
spring, picking up the same job he
left over 10 years ago.
Walsh's decision to coach at
Stanford — after speculation he
might instead return to coach a
professional team — ranked
behind only the antics of Keith
Rabois as the most talked-about
news item on campus last year.
Even the most football-illiterate
people knew Walsh's name, if not
the fact that he had led the San
Francisco 49'ers to their tremen
dous success in the 80's.
Hard-core sports fans immedi
ately ordered record numbers of
season tickets in anticipation of
the upcoming Stanford football
dynasty. What else could you
expect from the man who has been
described as a "football genius" by
every broadcaster ever to cover one
of his games?
And if the 1992 season is any
indication, he will not disappoint.
Walsh, who had the good fortune
to inherit a talent-rich team from
his predecessor, led the Cardinal to
their first 10-win season since
FDR was in office.
Walsh's team dominated nation
al powerhouse Notre Dame early
in the year — handing them their
only loss of the season — and gave
hints that Stanford's "glory days"
lie in the near future.
Stanford was one win away from
their first birth in the Rose Bowl in
over 20 years, and made Penn
State look just plain silly in their
Jan. 1, nationally televised bowl.
Perhaps most importantly,
Walsh carried out these accom
plishments not in any brash man

ner, but with the disposition and
attitude that make him one of the
classiest coaches in college football.
Walsh has also displayed a gen
uine commitment to Stanford.
One need only to have seen his
interview before the Penn State
game, or his interview on "Night
line" to realize that Walsh cares
about Stanford — the institution
as well as the students — as well as
winning.
Bill Walsh's return brought a
new excitement to Stanford Stadi
um and engendered a new spirit
that — to Dennis Green's credit —
only the presence of a living legend
could.
The addition of Walsh will mean
more national recognition for Stan
ford's football program as well as
increased revenue for the Depart
ment of Athletics from television
contracts and season ticket sales —
all of which will result in an
increase in student applications.
Certainly, there are more impor
tant things to Stanford than its
football team. The fact is, though,
that besides the two Keiths —
Archuleta and Rabois — few indi
viduals had a great impact on the
campus in 1992.
Yes, one individual was seen
much more than Walsh on the
front page last year — the Univer
sity's new President Gerhard
Casper. However, Casper has been
a bit of a non-presence so far, and
has done nothing approaching the
dramatic thus far. His stated goals
are sensible, if not expected, and
his manner is mild. The calm after
the storm of last year's indirect
cost hearings may be what Stan
ford needs in the short term, but it
will not fulfill our long term goals.
While Casper has infinitely
more potential to impact and affect
the direction of Stanford Universi
ty in the long term, he did not com
pare to Bill Walsh this year.
Casper may have put the motto
back on the seal, but Walsh won
the Blockbuster Bowl. And most
Stanford students don't even
know the motto.
