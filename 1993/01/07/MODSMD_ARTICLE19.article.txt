Student disappointed with education at Stanford

ALTHOUGH DEAD WEEK and
finals of autumn quarter are
thankfully long gone, a strong
feeling of disillusionment about what
kind of "liberal education" I am receiv
ing at Stanford has remained with me.
I have heard many others express
the same dissatisfaction with a learn
ing process which values facts over
independent thought, and the accumu
lation of knowledge and information
over free and creative thinking.
Although I am a "techie," last quarter
I took two humanities courses which I
hoped would allow me to escape the
memorization and rigidity of my techie

classes. However, throughout dead and
finals weeks, I found myself and others
cramming facts and ideas into my head,
tiying to sharpen my skills of short-term
memory and recall.
Studying for my fuzzy classes did not
differ greatly from preparing for my
techie finals. And although many of
these ideas were provocative and inter
esting, it was much more important to
be able to regurgitate them than to real
ly think about them.
The main purpose of finals is to make
sure that the student is well-versed in
all of the course material. Although this
is a necessary function, in my experi-

ence, this purpose hinders the creative
process.
Even in essay questions, writing style
and use of course materials is much
more important to the graders than
provocative ideas.
When taking my finals, I was unable
to draw upon personal experience or
other readings from outside the class
which would have more truthfully artic
ulated my opinions.
Discussion sections at Stanford too
often follow the precedent set by Cul
tures, Ideas and Values sections: Stu
dents are more concerned with impress
ing the section leader or other students

than about questioning why, for instance,
they are reading a particular text.
The distribution requirement system
is designed to ensure that we get a well
rounded education and is categorized by
subject. However, perhaps our adminis
tration should be more concerned about
how we are thinking rather than what to
think.
If it is impossible to leave Stanford
without learning about a natural science
or American culture, shouldn't it be just
as imperative that a student learn liber
al thinking?
