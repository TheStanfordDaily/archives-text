# New tools enable tracking of PAC hackers

Phone code crooks and computer hackers,
beware: Communication Services has got your
number.
Using new data management tools, the cam
pus telephone service is cracking down on peo
ple who use someone else's Personal Autho
rization Code to make long-distance calls.
"We're able to detect a lot more going on,"
said client services manager Anne Crowley,
who has already referred three cases to the Ju
dicial Affairs Office this year. "We try to nip it
in the bud."

She reported two cases in 1989-90 — the
new phone system's first year — and three
cases in each of the following years. While
clients have the option of pressing criminal
charges, Crowley said, "the majority of cases
are handled through Ithe University's! judicial
process."
Students "may think it's just a game" to
guess random numbers, warned Judicial Af
fairs Officer Sally Cole, but the use of someone
else's PAC is a Fundamental Standard viola
tion.
"Using somebody else's authorization code
is a form of theft," she said. "It's like using
someone else's credit card."

Punishments for phone code fraud can vary,
but Cole said the typical penalty for theft is sus
pension from Stanford.
Communication Services has been working
on having "better tools at hand to massage the
data" for about a year and a half, Crowley said,
and they completed the process over the sum
mer.
Abusers work by "randomly or sequentially
dialing authorization codes either with a com
puter or just manually," she explained.
"Any time that's done it raises a flag in the
phone system. ... If they are trying to guess at
authorization codes, their phone
number shows up."
Long-distance calls appear
on the PAC owner's telephone
bill along with the telephone
number it was made from,
Crowley said. Communication
Services then tries to identify
the caller.
Sometimes illegal calls are
made from a line shared by room
mates, complicating the identifi
cation process. But most of the
time, the answer is obvious with a
little phone record sleuthing,

Crowley said.
"If calls are being made on
abused codes to Wisconsin and
one of the roommates is from
Wisconsin, that's pretty straight
forward."
The severity of the crime
varies, however. Cases may range
from a computer hacker who's
just trying to see how many codes
he or she can obtain to someone
who uses a departmental code for
personal calls, according to Crow
ley.
While only a handful of
abusers have been caught so far,
Crowley said she "would antici
pate that with the better tools we
have, unfortunately [the number
of cases) might rise."
