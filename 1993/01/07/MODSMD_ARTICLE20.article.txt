# Involvement in tutor program encouraged by administrators
## 
### 
We encourage you to explore the oppor
tunities to serve as a tutor or mentor at
tonight's Tutoring Program's Mini-Fair.
Tutoring programs enable University stu
dents to affect positive change, and they
empower tutees to strive for excellence
both in school and in their personal lives.
Whether a tutee is a young child receiv
ing help with homework or an adult learn
ing to read, the rela
tionship is a critical investment in that
individual's future.
As students, your flexible schedules
and boundless energy can be tremendous
assets in roles as tutors, advocates or pro
gram organizers. Service experiences like
these often help students, particularly
freshmen, to find or clarify their niche
within the University community.
Your own involvement will enable
Stanford to extend its commitment and
contribution to public service and, indeed,

to enhance the growth and well-being of
everyone involved.
