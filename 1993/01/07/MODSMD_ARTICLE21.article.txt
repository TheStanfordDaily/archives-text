# Athletics Dept. should axe the yell leaders
## 
### 
I recently had the pleasure of spending
New Year's Day in Fort Lauderdale watch
ing the Cardinal soundly beat Penn State
in the Blockbuster Bowl. I was happy to
see the Stanford Band and Dollies at the
game, as they provide a form of entertain
ment unique among Pac-10 schools.
Another student group present in Fort
Lauderdale was the yell leaders. Judging
by their name, I would expect such a
group to lead "yells," or cheers, thereby
creating crowd noise to support the Stan
ford players. However, their attempts are
largely ignored by the crowd and have

been since the formation of the group. I
welcome the participants to continue wast
ing their time and breath at that activity if
it makes them happy.
I believe their role should be limited to
leading cheers and perhaps performing
stunts. Perhaps if they worked harder on
this they could actually become a useful
organization.
However, they waste their time produc
ing sorry attempts at dances to the music
of the Band. Such displays are embarrass
ing to me as a Stanford student.
The Dollies have finely choreographed
dances, each one uniquely fitted to a spe
cific Band song. The yell leaders have
generic routines which look downright
poor when performed next to the Dollies.
When the yell leaders went so far as to
"dance" in front of the Dollies at the
team's hotel after the bowl game, they
merely made it more clear that they were
vastly outclassed.
Ideally, I would like to see the yell lead
ers eliminated by the Department of Ath
letics. This could provide much-needed
funding for some of the less publicized
sports teams.
At the very least, though, the cheer-

leaders should stop acting like Dollie
wannabes; they are embarrassing them
selves as a group and Stanford as a whole
