## Problems with being PC 
### 
How predictable this must sound,
but sometimes the most obvious
things are the most difficult. And
though I'm wary to approach the issue
and to express my ambivalence in such a
short space, perhaps just as obvious as
anything else these days are the letters
PC. Political correctness.
Even when alone in your living room,
you can feel the imaginary police state
crowding your mind and tongue. Of
course it is inexcusable and pure human
evil to dismiss or abuse someone based
on their race, religion, nationality, sexu
al orientation, etc.
But I still feel somewhat adrift in the
whole PC campaign, and recent conver
sations have helped bring to the surface
some fundamental concerns with what's
going on PC-wise. These concerns are
not aimed at the motives of the cam
paign, but rather its concept and cur
rent reception.
One anti-PC gripe frequently men
tioned is that the movement has
instilled feelings of shame in people like
me for being who we are: regular whites
folk. This point is valid, but quite shal
low when compared to its counterpart —
the shame which "others" have suffered
for so long.
Of deeper concern than white shame,
however, I feel a certain tension
between the purpose and premise of the
PC movement — the purpose being, as I

see it, the just and equal treatment of all
groups, races, nations (again, etc.) of
people, and the premise that any given
group, race or nation deserves such
treatment as much as any other.
When I think of political correctness,
I feel tension. The divisiveness which the
movement aims to destroy seems to be
perpetuated, in more subtle and private
ways, by its focus on groups. The con
cern itself that those people deserve the
same treatment as these people may not
drive the wedge further, but the wedge's
shadow still remains through a con
scious move toward a more PC way of
thinking or acting, inevitably placing
more emphasis on our differences than
our similarities.
Of course this is not a matter of dis
paragement or indictment of the move
ment as a whole; history is a testimony
to its urgency. Nor is it a matter of blame
because the element of divisiveness is
inherent in the nature of the call to
equality, and not attributable to the peo
ple involved.
But it is a matter of groups — this
group, that group, groups within groups,
all the groups that are and ever will be.
Somewhere along the way have we lost
sight of the individual? An obvious
answer would be that each group is made
up of individuals, and each individual of
a world of feelings.
But this often becomes overshadowed

by fear. Fear of saying or thinking
something which could be incriminat
ing, and you might not even know it.
Suddenly someone's smile or grimace,
or a look of joy or sadness, becomes hid
den behind their skin color, accent or,
code of dress. Sometimes it feels like we
pass each other by like planets, sure not
to disturb one another, just passing by
with respectful silence and acknowledg
ment.
Yes, this sounds a bit absurd — look at
all the mingling and interaction on cam
pus. Snapshots of friends and lovers from
different parts of the world. But the cam
pus is big, and factionalism is rampant in
newspapers, flyers, meetings and so on.
And the world is bigger.
It's fascinating to notice the decline of
jokes regarding race, religion, sexuality,
etc. these days. But it's still quite easy to
come upon wisecracks and cynicism for
those with obesity problems, for example.
Or intelligence. Or those with their own
manners of speech or dress.
Again I ask, are we losing sight of the
individual?
