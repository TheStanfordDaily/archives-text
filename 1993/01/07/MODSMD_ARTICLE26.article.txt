## Is there a doctor in the house? Bruised squad opens Pac-10 play 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
So far, when looking at the achieve
ments of the Cardinal basketball team
heading into Pacific 10 Conference
play, the real winner may be the Stan
ford Hospital.
Injuries have taken their toll on the
Stanford squad, and the team that faces
Oregon State tonight is not the same as
it was expected at the beginning of the
season. As a consequence, coach Mike
Montgomery has tempered his outlook.
"We felt we could be a solid team at
the start (of the year) because we had
strength and depth," Montgomery said.
"Now we don't have those. We're not
the same basketball team."
Two players that were expected to be
major contributors for the 1992-93 Car
dinal are now lost for the season. 6-foot
-8 junior forward Jason Weaver's ten
dinitis in his left knee has grown pro
gressively worse. He will have a thor
ough examination in the near future, at
which time it will be determined
whether he must undergo arthroscopic
surgery. If surgery must be performed
on the lateral release, Weaver will be
out four to six months. In any event, his
knee is in such an unstable condition
that he will be unable to play this year.
Andy Poppink, a 6-7 sophomore
swingman, will also watch the remain
der of the Stanford schedule from the
sidelines. Poppink, whose versitility
was to be a key component for the team,
has been continually suffering from
lower back pains which have yet to sub
side.
Due to these losses of personnel,
Montgomery has been forced to shuffle
a variety of players on and off the court
in search of the right combination.
Stanford has a 5-6 record entering
league play. Montgomery has moved
freshman forward Darren Allaway into

'We're not going to be a
dominant team offensive
ly, and we're not going to
be a dominating rebound
ing team. I don't see us
beating any team by 20,
but I think there are going
to be a lot of close
games.'
— Mike Montgomery
the starting lineup to give the Cardinal
some bulk on the front line. Allaway
has shown that, although he is young,
he is not afraid to muscle it out inside.
"He's getting better and is playing
with a little more confidence," said
Montgomery. "He has quick feet and
has strength inside. We're high on Dar
ren's future."
A note on the positive side is that
Jim Morgan, who was to be Stanford's
focal point in the inside, resumed play
during the Fry's Invitational a little
over a week ago after sitting out the
majority of the preseason with a herni
ated disk in his back, suffered during
fall drills. Morgan was not expected
back for at least another month, but he
is not playing at full capacity.
"Jim is at about 70 percent," Mont
gomery said. "He gets tired really
quickly. We have to be careful with the
length of time we use him, because he
doesn't have much strength and he
won't be at 100 percent for the rest of
the season."
The main reason for Stanford's aver

age record is that the team's big guns —
Peter Dukes, Brent Williams and Mar
cus Lollie — have not reached the offen
sive output that is needed from them
for Stanford to win consistently. Of the
three, only Williams is averaging in
double figures in points (12.6), but even
this number is far less than what Mont
gomery thinks Williams is capable of.
Dukes is taking an average of less
than nine shots per game. Montgomery
would like to see him make that many,
while taking twice that amount. A rea
son in part for this is that Dukes has
faced tighter defensive pressure this
season. Montgomery feels, though, that
Dukes can help both himself and the
team by concentrating more on offen
sive rebounding.
Lollie is tallying four assists per
game, but, says Montgomery, "is still
struggling with who to pass it to
because the team doesn't have a go-to
guy, like last year with Keefe."
Off the bench, both Todd Manley
and Bart Lammersen have improved
their post play with each game. But nei
ther is the dominant physical presence
that Stanford needs at this point of the
season, a presence that Weaver could
have provided.
Poppink's absence leaves the Cardi
nal with a void, for he would fill in nice
ly at either of the forward spots, or even
at the shooting guard. The substitute
small forward, sophomore Nick Ravn,
has performed admirably, but lacks
game experience.
"Ravn gives us some good skills —
he's a smart player, he can hit a three
occasionally, but he'll be overmatched
in some instances," Montgomery said.
At guard, Montgomery rotates a trio
of Kenny Hicks, Dion Cross and Bobby
Patton at various intervals.
"We are of the feeling that we're bet
ter when we play more players — we're
more aggressive, we're quicker ... we
need people to give the positive parts of
their game in short spurts," said Mont
gomery.
Ready or not, the Pac-10 portion of
the schedule has arrived, and Stanford
should make things interesting.
"We're not going to be a dominant
team offensively, and we're not going to
be a dominating rebounding team,"
Montgomery said. "I don't see us beat
ing any team by 20, but I think there
are going to be a lot of close games.
There are going to be a lot of opportuni
ties for us to win, so we need to be able
to make free throws at key times."
Those times start tonight.

ated disk in his back, suffered during
fall drills. Morgan was not expected
back for at least another month, but he
is not playing at full capacity.
"Jim is at about 70 percent," Mont
gomery said. "He gets tired really
quickly. We have to be careful with the
length of time we use him, because he
doesn't have much strength and he
won't be at 100 percent for the rest of
the season."
The main reason for Stanford's aver

age record is that the team's big guns —
Peter Dukes, Brent Williams and Mar
cus Lollie — have not reached the offen
sive output that is needed from them
for Stanford to win consistently. Of the
three, only Williams is averaging in
double figures in points (12.6), but even
this number is far less than what Mont
gomery thinks Williams is capable of.
Dukes is taking an average of less
than nine shots per game. Montgomery
would like to see him make that many,
while taking twice that amount. A rea
son in part for this is that Dukes has
faced tighter defensive pressure this
season. Montgomery feels, though, that
Dukes can help both himself and the
team by concentrating more on offen
sive rebounding.
Lollie is tallying four assists per
game, but, says Montgomery, "is still
struggling with who to pass it to
because the team doesn't have a go-to
guy, like last year with Keefe."
Off the bench, both Todd Manley
and Bart Lammersen have improved
their post play with each game. But nei
ther is the dominant physical presence
that Stanford needs at this point of the
season, a presence that Weaver could
have provided.
Poppink's absence leaves the Cardi
nal with a void, for he would fill in nice
ly at either of the forward spots, or even
at the shooting guard. The substitute
small forward, sophomore Nick Ravn,
has performed admirably, but lacks
game experience.
"Ravn gives us some good skills —
he's a smart player, he can hit a three
occasionally, but he'll be overmatched
in some instances," Montgomery said.
At guard, Montgomery rotates a trio
of Kenny Hicks, Dion Cross and Bobby
Patton at various intervals.
"We are of the feeling that we're bet
ter when we play more players — we're
more aggressive, we're quicker ... we
need people to give the positive parts of
their game in short spurts," said Mont
gomery.
Ready or not, the Pac-10 portion of
the schedule has arrived, and Stanford
should make things interesting.
"We're not going to be a dominant
team offensively, and we're not going to
be a dominating rebounding team,"
Montgomery said. "I don't see us beat
ing any team by 20, but I think there
are going to be a lot of close games.
There are going to be a lot of opportuni
ties for us to win, so we need to be able
to make free throws at key times."
Those times start tonight.

Brent Williams and the injury-plagued Stanford squad open up Pac-10 competition
against Oregon State tonight at 7:30 pm in Maples Pavilion.
So far, when looking at the achieve
ments of the Cardinal basketball team
heading into Pacific 10 Conference
play, the real winner may be the Stan
ford Hospital.
Injuries have taken their toll on the
Stanford squad, and the team that faces
Oregon State tonight is not the same as
it was expected at the beginning of the
season. As a consequence, coach Mike
Montgomery has tempered his outlook.
"We felt we could be a solid team at
the start (of the year) because we had
strength and depth," Montgomery said.
"Now we don't have those. We're not
the same basketball team."
Two players that were expected to be
major contributors for the 1992-93 Car
dinal are now lost for the season. 6-foot
-8 junior forward Jason Weaver's ten
dinitis in his left knee has grown pro
gressively worse. He will have a thor
ough examination in the near future, at
which time it will be determined
whether he must undergo arthroscopic
surgery. If surgery must be performed
on the lateral release, Weaver will be
out four to six months. In any event, his
knee is in such an unstable condition
that he will be unable to play this year.
Andy Poppink, a 6-7 sophomore
swingman, will also watch the remain
der of the Stanford schedule from the
sidelines. Poppink, whose versitility
was to be a key component for the team,
has been continually suffering from
lower back pains which have yet to sub
side.
Due to these losses of personnel,
Montgomery has been forced to shuffle
a variety of players on and off the court
in search of the right combination.
Stanford has a 5-6 record entering
league play. Montgomery has moved
freshman forward Darren Allaway into

'We're not going to be a
dominant team offensive
ly, and we're not going to
be a dominating rebound
ing team. I don't see us
beating any team by 20,
but I think there are going
to be a lot of close
games.'
— Mike Montgomery
the starting lineup to give the Cardinal
some bulk on the front line. Allaway
has shown that, although he is young,
he is not afraid to muscle it out inside.
"He's getting better and is playing
with a little more confidence," said
Montgomery. "He has quick feet and
has strength inside. We're high on Dar
ren's future."
A note on the positive side is that
Jim Morgan, who was to be Stanford's
focal point in the inside, resumed play
during the Fry's Invitational a little
over a week ago after sitting out the
majority of the preseason with a herni
ated disk in his back, suffered during
fall drills. Morgan was not expected
back for at least another month, but he
is not playing at full capacity.
"Jim is at about 70 percent," Mont
gomery said. "He gets tired really

length of time we use him, because he
doesn't have much strength and he
won't be at 100 percent for the rest of
