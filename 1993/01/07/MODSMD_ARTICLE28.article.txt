# Right turn in Albuquerque
## 
### 
On Dec. 19, in Albuquerque, New Mex
ico, I witnessed what can truly be
called a sports miracle.
Actually, it's the third sports miracle I've
seen at Stanford. The first came two years
ago in South Bend, Ind., when an out
matched and outranked Cardinal football
team marched into the home of Touchdown
Jesus and the No. 1 Fighting Irish, and
came away with the biggest upset of the
year.

The second, as you might recall, came on
a cold November night in Memorial Stadi
um later that season, when a determined
Stanford team proved that it isn't over until
the fat lady sings, packs up her microphone
and "clears the field."
But number three topped them both.
Number three had drama, emotion and
ranks in my book as one of the all-time
great sports stories of 1992. So, if you
haven't already watched the ESPN delayed
rebroadcast of the semifinal matches, or
don't want to wait for the even more
delayed rebroadcast of the final match, sit
back and enjoy the story. It's a good one.
Fans of Stanford women's volleyball —
remember if you will just a year ago. The
highly favored and very talented Stanford
volleyball team was a game away from the
Final Four, and hopefully en route to its
first-ever national championship. But
UCLA traveled to Maples Pavilion and
pulled off the heartbreaking upset, leaving
Stanford frustrated in the Tournament
again and without a title.
UCLA would go on to win its second
straight NCAA championship, while Stan
ford would look to next year and another
chance. Specifically, the Cardinal would
need to fill the spots left by two of its key
players, Kristin Klein and Amy Cooper.
Head coach Don Shaw found his starters in
seniors Kristi Paaso, Jennifer Jackson and
Laurie Sawin, not to mention a freshman
recruit from Arroyo Grande, Calif, named
Cary Wendell.
UCLA, on the other hand, returned Ail-
American Natalie Williams to its starting
squad, a candidate for Player of the Year

honors. Add seniors Marissa Hatchett, Lisa
Hudak and Elaine Youngs, and you have
perhaps the most imposing front line in all
of collegiate women's volleyball. With their
lineup, the Bruins were not only favored to
win it all, they were expected to.
800. Hiss.
I know, just pipe down and keep reading.
Turn to this year. Stanford surprises all
the critics and tears through its regular
season schedule. The Cardinal defeats No. 4
Long Beach State. The Cardinal takes No. 3
Pacific twice. Nobody in the Pacific 10 Con
ference can touch the Cardinal — nobody,
that is, except for UCLA, who deals the Car
dinal its only two losses of the year.
Coach Shaw and his players had many
things to say about every game they played
this year. Good execution here, bad rotation
there, they were weak in places, we had
good play from these players. But time and
time again, they would say the same thing
— UCLA is in the back of our minds,
because to win the championship, you have
to beat UCLA.
Fast forward now to the end of the sea
son. Cary Wendell, the fastest rising star on
the Stanford team, was named the Pacific
10 Conference's Freshman of the Year.
Wendy Hromadka joined Wendell on the
Pac-10 All-Freshman Team. Setter Carrie
Feldman and hitter Bev Oden were named
to the All-Pac-10 team, with Oden garner
ing Ail-American honors for the fourth year
in a row.
Shaw wasn't smiling yet, however. After
surviving hostile crowds and Feldman's flu
to win the Mideast Regional, he and the
team knew that the real challenge lay
ahead. He and his team were going to the
Final Four. And that meant / was going to
the Final Four.
Albuquerque, I thought. That's South
west, isn't it? Must be hot down there — I'll
pack some T-shirts.
Yeah, right. No one told me Albuquerque
was 5,000 feet up. I ran head first into 19
degrees of cold. Minus the wind chill.
But luckily, it didn't seem to affect the
players. They had one thing on their minds:
the national championship. In fact, most of
the players were loose and relaxed when
they arrived at The Pit for warmups. You'd
never know they were 45 points away from
the biggest match of their lives, or that they
would probably face nemesis UCLA should
they survive the semifinal.
In a scene that made me think I was in
Maples Pavilion, someone abruptly changed
the pregame warmup music to the far less
appropriate "Giving Him Something He


Mike
McDonough
Can Feel." Senior Laurie Sawin
suddenly stopped her stretching
and busted into a seductive dance
that had her teammates on the
floor. Long Beach State stayed
businesslike on the other side of
the net, and they lost the match.
In the other semifinal, UCLA
blew Florida out in three games
and returned to the sixth floor of
the hotel to celebrate their soon
to-be victory against Stanford,
capping an incredible undefeated
season and earning them the title
of Greatest Team Ever.
Dec. 19. This was the match
we'd all been waiting for. Stan
ford-UCLA. No. 1 vs. No. 2 for the
national championship. A top

ranked team who had beaten its
Pac-10 rival twice during the reg
ular season was trying to make it
three in a row in the Tournament.
To most Stanford fans, this
should sound familiar.
Media buildup was at a fever
pitch. UCLA was the greatest team
ever, Natalie Williams was the best
player ever, they were saying.
Watch for the three-peat, they said.
Then, that night, in easily their
finest performance of the year,
Stanford played with a passion.
Williams and Youngs were stuffed
time and time again, balls were
driven into the floor. The UCLA
rooters were noticeably silent.
Point Stanford followed point
Stanford. Then it was game one,
Stanford. Game two, Stanford.
UCLA fought back and took the
third. Then the final sweet points
of game four. At 13-8, Youngs hit

squarely into the right antenna,
and suddenly it was champi
onship point.
Three sideouts. A UCLA point.
Another sideout. Then All-Pac-10
freshman Wendy Hromadka drove
the ball down and it stayed down.
Finally.
As the players themselves can
tell you, the moment couldn't be
described. These women will go
their separate ways after this
year, some staying to defend the
title, others moving on, maybe to
play in Italy or with luck, the
Olympics. None of them will get
the big NBA contract, or play for
another five to seven years in the
NFL. But they will always have
that moment, their pile at mid
court, and the first ever national
championship.
And that, my friends, is a
sports miracle.

Yeah, right. No one told me Albuquerque
was 5,000 feet up. I ran head first into 19
degrees of cold. Minus the wind chill.
But luckily, it didn't seem to affect the
players. They had one thing on their minds:
the national championship. In fact, most of
the players were loose and relaxed when
they arrived at The Pit for warmups. You'd
never know they were 45 points away from
the biggest match of their lives, or that they
would probably face nemesis UCLA should
they survive the semifinal.
In a scene that made me think I was in
Maples Pavilion, someone abruptly changed
the pregame warmup music to the far less
appropriate "Giving Him Something He


Mike
McDonough
Can Feel." Senior Laurie Sawin
suddenly stopped her stretching
and busted into a seductive dance
that had her teammates on the
floor. Long Beach State stayed
businesslike on the other side of
the net, and they lost the match.
In the other semifinal, UCLA
blew Florida out in three games
and returned to the sixth floor of
the hotel to celebrate their soon
to-be victory against Stanford,
capping an incredible undefeated
season and earning them the title
of Greatest Team Ever.
Dec. 19. This was the match
we'd all been waiting for. Stan
ford-UCLA. No. 1 vs. No. 2 for the
national championship. A top

ranked team who had beaten its
Pac-10 rival twice during the reg
ular season was trying to make it
three in a row in the Tournament.
To most Stanford fans, this
should sound familiar.
Media buildup was at a fever
pitch. UCLA was the greatest team
ever, Natalie Williams was the best
player ever, they were saying.
Watch for the three-peat, they said.
Then, that night, in easily their
finest performance of the year,
Stanford played with a passion.
Williams and Youngs were stuffed
time and time again, balls were
driven into the floor. The UCLA
rooters were noticeably silent.
Point Stanford followed point
Stanford. Then it was game one,
Stanford. Game two, Stanford.
UCLA fought back and took the
third. Then the final sweet points
of game four. At 13-8, Youngs hit

squarely into the right antenna,
and suddenly it was champi
onship point.
Three sideouts. A UCLA point.
Another sideout. Then All-Pac-10
freshman Wendy Hromadka drove
the ball down and it stayed down.
Finally.
As the players themselves can
tell you, the moment couldn't be
described. These women will go
their separate ways after this
year, some staying to defend the
title, others moving on, maybe to
play in Italy or with luck, the
Olympics. None of them will get
the big NBA contract, or play for
another five to seven years in the
NFL. But they will always have
that moment, their pile at mid
court, and the first ever national
championship.
And that, my friends, is a
sports miracle.
On Dec. 19, in Albuquerque, New Mex
ico, I witnessed what can truly be
called a sports miracle.
Actually, it's the third sports miracle I've
seen at Stanford. The first came two years
ago in South Bend, Ind., when an out
matched and outranked Cardinal football
team marched into the home of Touchdown
Jesus and the No. 1 Fighting Irish, and
came away with the biggest upset of the
year.

The second, as you might recall, came on
a cold November night in Memorial Stadi
um later that season, when a determined
Stanford team proved that it isn't over until
the fat lady sings, packs up her microphone
and "clears the field."
But number three topped them both.
Number three had drama, emotion and
ranks in my book as one of the all-time
great sports stories of 1992. So, if you
haven't already watched the ESPN delayed
rebroadcast of the semifinal matches, or
don't want to wait for the even more
delayed rebroadcast of the final match, sit
back and enjoy the story. It's a good one.
Fans of Stanford women's volleyball —
remember if you will just a year ago. The
highly favored and very talented Stanford
volleyball team was a game away from the
Final Four, and hopefully en route to its
first-ever national championship. But
UCLA traveled to Maples Pavilion and
pulled off the heartbreaking upset, leaving
Stanford frustrated in the Tournament
again and without a title.
UCLA would go on to win its second
straight NCAA championship, while Stan
ford would look to next year and another
chance. Specifically, the Cardinal would
need to fill the spots left by two of its key
players, Kristin Klein and Amy Cooper.
Head coach Don Shaw found his starters in
seniors Kristi Paaso, Jennifer Jackson and
Laurie Sawin, not to mention a freshman
recruit from Arroyo Grande, Calif, named
Cary Wendell.
UCLA, on the other hand, returned Ail-
American Natalie Williams to its starting
squad, a candidate for Player of the Year

honors. Add seniors Marissa Hatchett, Lisa
Hudak and Elaine Youngs, and you have
perhaps the most imposing front line in all
of collegiate women's volleyball. With their
lineup, the Bruins were not only favored to
win it all, they were expected to.
800. Hiss.
I know, just pipe down and keep reading.
Turn to this year. Stanford surprises all
the critics and tears through its regular
season schedule. The Cardinal defeats No. 4
Long Beach State. The Cardinal takes No. 3
Pacific twice. Nobody in the Pacific 10 Con
ference can touch the Cardinal — nobody,
that is, except for UCLA, who deals the Car
dinal its only two losses of the year.
Coach Shaw and his players had many
things to say about every game they played
this year. Good execution here, bad rotation
there, they were weak in places, we had
good play from these players. But time and
time again, they would say the same thing
— UCLA is in the back of our minds,
because to win the championship, you have
to beat UCLA.
Fast forward now to the end of the sea
son. Cary Wendell, the fastest rising star on
the Stanford team, was named the Pacific
10 Conference's Freshman of the Year.
Wendy Hromadka joined Wendell on the
Pac-10 All-Freshman Team. Setter Carrie
Feldman and hitter Bev Oden were named
to the All-Pac-10 team, with Oden garner
ing Ail-American honors for the fourth year
in a row.
Shaw wasn't smiling yet, however. After
surviving hostile crowds and Feldman's flu
to win the Mideast Regional, he and the
team knew that the real challenge lay
ahead. He and his team were going to the
Final Four. And that meant / was going to
the Final Four.
Albuquerque, I thought. That's South
west, isn't it? Must be hot down there — I'll
pack some T-shirts.
