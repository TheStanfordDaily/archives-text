# Women's hoops takes on OSU
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
After soundly defeating the Texas Longhorns
on Tuesday, the No. 4 Stanford women's bas
ketball squad will open Pacific 10 Conference
play against Oregon State tonight with a boost
of confidence.
Against the No. 17 Longhorns, the Cardinal
erupted in a second-half outburst and crushed
the Texas squad 87-64, with five players scor
ing in double figures on the night. As a result,
the team received a flattering prediction from
Texas coach Jody Conradt of its chances to win
a fifth consecutive Pac-10 title.
"In my opinion, Stanford will win it," Con
radt said. "I don't see anyone challenging
them. They know what it takes to win, espe
cially in their conference."
Such high praise holds a great deal of weight,
considering that it comes from a person who
recently became the first coach in women's
basketball history to record 600 career wins.
Cardinal head coach Tara VanDerveer felt
that her squad gained momentum after its
whitewashing of Texas.
"It was really a good game for us to head into
the Pac-10 Ischedulel," she said. "Our team
has tremendous confidence and work habits."
Nevertheless, Stanford should have its hands
full when it takes on Oregon State on the road
tonight. After beating the Beavers by 35 points
at home last year, the Cardinal was stunned by
the same opponent on the road later in the sea
son, losing 75-69. The Cardinal has not beaten
the Beavers on their home court since 1990.
In order to halt the losing streak, Stanford
needs to prevent Oregon State's freshmen tan
dem of Tanja Kostic and Anette Mollerstrom
from taking control of the game. The first-year
forwards are averaging 20.9 points per game
and 14.2 points per game, respectively.
Offensively, the Cardinal hopes to frustrate
the Beaver defense with its own superstar tan
dem. Senior point guard Molly Goodenbour
leads the squad in assists while All-American
Val Whiting leads in both the scoring and
rebounding departments.
In addition, the Cardinal must punish the
Beavers with their lethal fast break transition
pjme which proved a pivotal factor in demoral
izing the Texas squad.
"Our team plays better when we are run
ning," Goodenbour explained.
At its current pace, the Cardinal just might
run past all of its Pac-10 competition.
