### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff 
Deputy General Counsel Michael Hudnall has
been named acting general counsel after outgoing
General Counsel John Schwartz was hired by a local
biotechnology company.
Schwartz, who announced in September that he
would step down by the end of the 1992-93 academic
year, was named vice president and general counsel
of Systemix Inc., a Palo Alto-based biotechnology
company.
Hudnall will serve in the new position until a per
manent general counsel is named. A University com
mittee chaired by Law Prof. Robert Weisberg is con
ducting a national search for Schwartz's replacement.
Weisberg said the search is "well on its way" and
estimated that the committee would have a candidate

to recommend to University President Gerhard
Casper by late February or early March.
Hudnall refused to confirm or deny whether he
was a candidate for the permanent position.
He said he does not plan to make any substantial
changes in way the legal office operates.
"I see my role as basically managing the ship dur
ing a time of transition," he said.
Hudnall, a business, real estate and finance law spe
cialist, joined Stanford's legal staff in 1972. He served
as the managing attorney for business and finance be
fore being named deputy general counsel in 1989.
He said he sees the position of general counsel,
which includes overseeing the office's 17 attorneys,
as change from what he has been doing in the past.
"I think the general counsel job is different from all
others in the office. It's much broader in scope," he said.
"The challenge will be to provide steady leadership."
