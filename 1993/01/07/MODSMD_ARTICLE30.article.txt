# Pyramidball hits IM scene
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Take rugby. Throw in two parts ulti
mate frisbee, one part soccer and a dash
of Intramural inventiveness and you've
got pyramidball, the new sport offered
by the Stanford IM department this sea
son.
"It's quick and fun," said pyramidball
commissioner Sarah Bacon. "And it's
real easy to learn."
Played on a soccer field, pyramidball
teams are made up of seven players
apiece, including a goalie. Passes from
player to player are all drop kicks. Upon
receiving a pass, players have three sec
onds to run with the ball. They must
then pass or shoot it.
Shooting is done on an "A" shaped,
two-level goal. The goal is defended by a
goalie, but the goalie can only intercept
shots headed for the base of the "A", the
upper triangle being too high to reach.
Shots going through the upper triangle
are worth one point, while shots passing
the goalie and going through the base of
the triangle earn successively higher

points depending on how far from the
goal the shot is taken.

Posthumous imported pyramidball not
from Egypt, but from Cal.
"At Cal it's huge," Bacon said. "All
the frats participate and it gets extreme
ly competitive."
"Depending on the interest, we hope
to offer pyramidball as a league sport
with co-ed and all University divisions
during the winter quarter," said IM stu
dent director Nick Blosser. "It will be
played on the soccer fields on weekday
afternoons."
"Right now the problem is getting
enough referees so pyramidball, soccer
and this season's biggest sport, basket
ball, will run smoothly," Blosser said.
Referee positions pay $6.50 an hour
and a clinic will be held tomorrow at
the IM office at 5 p.m. for all interested
in officiating any of the three league
sports.
Signups for basketball, soccer and
pyramidball, as well as the multitude of
tournament sports offered this quarter
begin at 1 p.m. today in Ford Center.
