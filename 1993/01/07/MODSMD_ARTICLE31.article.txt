# Freshman luger heads to Europe
## 
### Rich Stolz Staff writer 
On a campus filled with brilliant ath
letes it often becomes passe for any one
to receive extra attention, but in the
case of freshman Paul Baribault, the
spotlight is well deserved. Baribault,
recently a member of the United States
Junior National Luge Team, has moved
up to senior competitor status and is on
his way to World Cup-level competi
tions and a shot at the Olympics in sin
gles luging.
The sudden change in Baribault's
status occurred last summer when the
international congress ruling luge rac
ing streamlined guidelines dealing with
age requirements. It was not until his
first junior-level competition of the
autumn season in Egles, Austria, how
ever, that he learned of his sudden pro
motion to the Senior Circuit.
The transition not only surprised
Baribault but it also forced him to adapt
quickly. In senior competition, the luge
course starts at a much greater height
than that used in junior and women's
competition. This translates to faster
speeds, and inevitably more risk.

Though it may appear simple, luging
is in reality a very demanding sport. It
requires a great deal of strength in the
neck and abdomen to withstand pres
sure that can range from five to seven
G's. In addition, speeds often exceed 85
mph. Maneuvering requires disciplined
but relaxed control of every muscle in
the body. Moreover, luging is the only
sport that is timed in thousandths of a
second. And as Baribault explains, it is
no easy task relaxing at 85 mph when
lying only six inches above the track.
The amount of body control required
by luging is astounding as well. The
slightest movement or pressure exerted
by the racer can steer the sled anywhere
the racer desires. But though the sport
is relatively safe, the slightest loss of
control can cause one to lose a fraction
of a second. "There is no feeling like it,"
he said. "It's a natural rush. It's amaz
ing to be in control and know that you
are at 80 mph."
Lugers must also pass specified
weight minimums. This prevents sheer
weight from taking a very large role in
the competition, equalizing the com
petitors. In order to meet the require
ment, Baribault wore 16 kilograms of

clothing. "It definitely changed the
dynamics," Baribault said. "It was
harder to move, and I only had one
(practice) run at that weight before the
race (in Egles)."
Competing with the more experi
enced members of the Senior Circuit for
the first time at Egles, Baribault fin
ished a respectable 10th place. In his
next competition in Winterberg, Ger
many, he finished eighth.
The latter race served as a confidence
booster, as the meet showcased several
experienced veterans and therefore
much stiffer competition. Baribault,
though pleased with his performance,
was sure he could have done better. "An
Italian took third in the race and I had
beaten him in practice," he said.
Baribault will be one of the youngest,
if not the youngest, racer on the World
Cup Circuit this year, putting him at a
disadvantage. Since there are normally
only a handful of races in a season, it
takes many years for a competitor to
develop not only the skill but also the
experience necessary to be among the
world's best. Baribault only has until
March to grow accustomed to the
Senior Circuit before the Olympic
Trials.
This transition is a major high
light in a young career that began
for Baribault with Stanford Sier
ra Camp. His parents, looking for
a speaker for the camp children,
asked Bonnie Warner, a three
time luge Olympian, to demon
strate her sport. Baribault has
loved luging ever since.

On Friday, Baribault will leave
with the Junior Team for Europe
and a Senior B Circuit race in
Egles. From there he will compete
in a race in Czeckoslovakia where
no American has before compet
ed. Later this winter he will join
the World Cup Circuit and travel
to Winterberg, Lillehammer, Nor
way and Lake Placid, N.Y., where
the Olympic Trials will be held. At
the Olympic Trials only the top
three Americans will be chosen to
go to Lillehammer in 1994. Cur
rently, Baribault is ranked fifth
on the United States Senior
Team.
