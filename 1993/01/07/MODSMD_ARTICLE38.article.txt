'Big Chill' part II:
Halcyon days of
yore, once more

Peter's Friends

Kenneth Branagh, director and star of
"Dead Again" and the 1989 film version of
"Henry V," returns with a comedy-drama to
test the convictions of everyone who hailed
him as the film wunderkind who could bring
Shakespeare to the masses.
"Peter's Friends" depicts the 10-year col
lege reunion of six English friends. The film
tries unsuccessfully to combine the comedy
of rekindling old relationships with the seri
ous problems that arise after those carefree
days in college.
At his country estate, Peter (Stephen Fry)
and his five companions try to work out
their particular neuroses — over-protective
parenting, alcoholism, nymphomania —
while clashing with their respective mates
and old friends.
On the lighter side, there are a few good
lines and witty comebacks—but none of the
inspired anger that a brilliant comic like
John Cleese can make work so well. Emma
Thompson, Branagh's real-life spouse, puts
in a good performance as a nervous introvert
trying to find a sexual identity: "Fill me with
your little babies," she begs a reluctant Peter.
Unfortunately, the comedy just isn't that
funny, overwhelmed by the "serious" issues
and the characters' incessant self-indulgence.
Rita Rudner, who wrote the screenplay, is
especially boring as a British-eye
view version of a vacuous Hollywood televi
sion star.
But her vulgarity is appealing next to the
self-absorbed whining of the more upper
crusty characters, who are apparently sup
posed to have more substance than she and
the few other lower-class figures in the film.
Peter's friends are a pretty dull bunch, de
fined solely in terms of their various prob
lems — which they never stop talking about.
Still, it might be a good idea for all gradu
ating seniors to see this movie, study the
characters and repeat to themselves, "I'll
never be like that, I'll never be like that..."

The Crying Game

In a year when riots followed the acquittal
of four white police officers in the brutal
beating of a black man, many critics mis
guidedly praise such films as "Unforgiven"
and"The Bodyguard" for downplaying
racial issues.
Writer-director Neil Jordan refuses to
take the easy way out, choosing instead to
confront the pervasive reality of racism and
other prejudices. And in doing so, he has cre
ated one of the richest and most complex
films of 1992.
"The Crying Game" begins in Ireland,
where the Irish Republican Army kidnaps a
black British soldier. If one of their comrades
is not released within three days, they will ex
ecute the hostage. During those three days,
the soldier, Jody (Forest Whitaker) and his
minder Fergus (Stephen Rea) slowly become
friends.
When Jody realizes that the IRA can't let
him go, he asks Fergus for a single favor: to
look up his girlfriend in London and tell her
that he was thinking of her.
On the day of the execution, the IRA op
eration goes horribly wrong. Fergus man
ages to escape to London, where he meets
Jody's mulatto girlfriend Dil (newcomer Jaye
Davidson), and finds himself powerfully at
tracted to her. They go out a few times, grow
ing closer on each occasion. Then, just as in
Hitchcock's "Vertigo," the film blindsides us
with a secret that changes our perception of
all that has gone before and all that will fol
low.
Rea is an unlikely romantic lead; he is
lithe, plain and seemingly unemotional. But
beneath that guarded facade lies a genuine
compassion and his seldom-seen crooked
smile which attracts us to him. We believe it
when he helps a tightly bound Jody to relieve
himself. We understand why Dil falls in love

with him. And we never lose sympathy for
him, even as he leads Jody to a remote clear
ing for the inevitable execution.
Jaye Davidson plays Dil as a cool ingenue
who is less self-assured than she appears. Her
scenes with Fergus are the heart and soul of
the the film; it is with some regret that we re
turn to the world around them. Dil's charac
ter is the most crucial to the film, and in
pulling it off, Davidson turns in one of the
year's best performances.
But the true star of Jordan's film is his in
tricately plotted screenplay, which relent
lessly forces us to examine our assumptions
and beliefs. Is an IRA volunteer necessarily a
psychopath? Or a British soldier a hard-line
patriot? And can love overcome our most
deeply rooted prejudices about race and gen
der? The script takes many twists and turns,
but Jordan anchors it firmly with a love story
that ultimately transcends the film's
poignant ending.
So if you're looking for the perfect date
movie, don't bother with "The Bodyguard."
Forget "Forever Young." And avoid "Al
addin." The film you want is "The Crying
Game." From the complicated topics of love,
race, sexuality, loyalty and political conflict,

it fashions a thrilling web of romance and
deceit that will hold you spellbound long
after the lights have come up.

Heart-wrenching
epic of romance
and a revolution

Indochine

Revolutionary Indochina in the '30s is a
powerfully poignant setting for "Indochine,"
the steamy love story of a French colonial of
ficer and a young Vietnamese woman. And
French director Regis Wargnier milks a heat
ed political climate for all the melodrama it's
worth.
Jean-Baptiste (Vincent Perez) and
Camille (Linh Dan Pham) fall in love against
a backdrop of communist invasions and na
tional unrest. Their romance is no relaxed
courting game; when they're not fleeing the
authorities, they're looking for food and
water to live.
The star of the movie is Catherine
Deneuve, as Eliane. She plays the daughter of
the French colonial ruler of Indochina, the
foster parent of Camille, whose elite Viet
namese parents are deceased. She finds her
self the short-time mistress of the sexy,
young officer Jean-Baptiste, who quickly
moves on to other conquests. Eliane is left
insulted and bitter when Camille indepen
dently falls in love with him.
Deneuve's performance as the narrator
with strong maternal ties to Camille and
mixed feelings of passion and hatred for
Jean-Baptiste, is one of the movie's greatest
strengths. In full bloom at age 50, Deneuve
combines the sex appeal of youth with the
distinction of experience. Even if you don't
care about the story, Deneuve makes you
want to hear it.
Perez plays his part well, although it's not
much of a part to play: all he has to do is act
sexy, and the women go wild. His character
does develop as the movie goes on. He starts

out a self-centered seducer and becomes the
faithful and adoring protector of Camille.
But one wonders how the change happened
so fast.
As Camille, Dan Pham is "irresistible" —
as Eliane says — with eyes that express what
words won't. However, her part onscreen is
largely passive; she's usually languishing
from love or fainting from starvation.
Wargnier films each scene with the utmost
care. Just after Camille has announced her new

passion to Eliane, who still burns with love for
Jean-Baptiste, the two women dance a slow
tango together, moving in unison in a subtly
competitive charade. Equally unforgettable is
the image of the two lovers sailing in a huge
moth-like junk among the awesome Southeast
Asian cliffs, trying to catch the last drops of
rainwater in their parched mouths. And the
scene where slave ships sail in the night to de
liver their shameful cargo will haunt the view
er long after the movie has ended.
"Indochine" is a masterful movie in every
sense, from the powerful acting to the politi

cally accurate plot to the artistically adept
filming and costuming. Even if the political
symbolism goes over your head, you can't
help being carried away by the passions of ro
mance and revolution.

Gibson freezes:
Silly, sappy, but
oddly satisfying

Forever Young

Hollywood screenwriter Jeffrey Abrams
said he wanted to write a script about "some
one who represents the romance of America."
Instead he wrote "Forever Young," a film
about frozen men, eight-year-old airplane
pilots, and an Australian's naked butt.
"Forever Young" is not bad, but it lacks
good acting, clever plotting or innovative di
rection.
And yet, strangely enough, this sappy, pre
dictable picture has a way of working its way
into your heart.
The premise of the picture is fairly silly:
Mel Gibson plays Daniel, an Air Corps test
pilot who volunteers for a cryogenics experi
ment (where warm, breathing people are
turned into Butterball turkeys) after his
sweetheart Helen (Isabel Glasser) gets hit by
a fruit truck and turned into a vegetable.
Of course, something goes wrong, and he
doesn't get awakened until two kids screwing
around in a warehouse accidentally revive

him 53 years later.
What follows is about 45 minutes of
Daniel discovering the modern world — in
cluding everything from Hiroshima to
Thighmasters — before we get to the meat of
the movie. Ii turns cut, to no one's surprise,
that his sweetheart didn't really die (she
awakes from her coma shortly after Daniel
gels frozen) and Daniel quickly ages, regain
ing 53 years of wear and tear in about three
days.
Can Daniel see his love again before he
starts looking like Ronald Reagan? Movies
being what they are, of course he does. In
fact, the ending is syrupy, featuring a light
house, sunset and embracing silhouettes
aplenty.
The acting is weak, and the special effects
and direction are routine.
Yet, despite all its flaws, "Forever Young"
makes you feel warm and fuzzy when the two
old lovers get reunited. Sure, the movie is
sappy, romantic and predictable, but some
times a happy ending is just what you need.

'Big Chill' part II:
Halcyon days of
yore, once more

Peter's Friends

Kenneth Branagh, director and star of
"Dead Again" and the 1989 film version of
"Henry V," returns with a comedy-drama to
test the convictions of everyone who hailed
him as the film wunderkind who could bring
Shakespeare to the masses.
"Peter's Friends" depicts the 10-year col
lege reunion of six English friends. The film
tries unsuccessfully to combine the comedy
of rekindling old relationships with the seri
ous problems that arise after those carefree
days in college.
At his country estate, Peter (Stephen Fry)
and his five companions try to work out
their particular neuroses — over-protective
parenting, alcoholism, nymphomania —
while clashing with their respective mates
and old friends.
On the lighter side, there are a few good
lines and witty comebacks—but none of the
inspired anger that a brilliant comic like
John Cleese can make work so well. Emma
Thompson, Branagh's real-life spouse, puts
in a good performance as a nervous introvert
trying to find a sexual identity: "Fill me with
your little babies," she begs a reluctant Peter.
Unfortunately, the comedy just isn't that
funny, overwhelmed by the "serious" issues
and the characters' incessant self-indulgence.
Rita Rudner, who wrote the screenplay, is
especially boring as a British-eye
view version of a vacuous Hollywood televi
sion star.
But her vulgarity is appealing next to the
self-absorbed whining of the more upper
crusty characters, who are apparently sup
posed to have more substance than she and
the few other lower-class figures in the film.
Peter's friends are a pretty dull bunch, de
fined solely in terms of their various prob
lems — which they never stop talking about.
Still, it might be a good idea for all gradu
ating seniors to see this movie, study the
characters and repeat to themselves, "I'll
never be like that, I'll never be like that..."

The Crying Game

In a year when riots followed the acquittal
of four white police officers in the brutal
beating of a black man, many critics mis
guidedly praise such films as "Unforgiven"
and"The Bodyguard" for downplaying
racial issues.
Writer-director Neil Jordan refuses to
take the easy way out, choosing instead to
confront the pervasive reality of racism and
other prejudices. And in doing so, he has cre
ated one of the richest and most complex
films of 1992.
"The Crying Game" begins in Ireland,
where the Irish Republican Army kidnaps a
black British soldier. If one of their comrades
is not released within three days, they will ex
ecute the hostage. During those three days,
the soldier, Jody (Forest Whitaker) and his
minder Fergus (Stephen Rea) slowly become
friends.
When Jody realizes that the IRA can't let
him go, he asks Fergus for a single favor: to
look up his girlfriend in London and tell her
that he was thinking of her.
On the day of the execution, the IRA op
eration goes horribly wrong. Fergus man
ages to escape to London, where he meets
Jody's mulatto girlfriend Dil (newcomer Jaye
Davidson), and finds himself powerfully at
tracted to her. They go out a few times, grow
ing closer on each occasion. Then, just as in
Hitchcock's "Vertigo," the film blindsides us
with a secret that changes our perception of
all that has gone before and all that will fol
low.
Rea is an unlikely romantic lead; he is
lithe, plain and seemingly unemotional. But
beneath that guarded facade lies a genuine
compassion and his seldom-seen crooked
smile which attracts us to him. We believe it
when he helps a tightly bound Jody to relieve
himself. We understand why Dil falls in love

with him. And we never lose sympathy for
him, even as he leads Jody to a remote clear
ing for the inevitable execution.
Jaye Davidson plays Dil as a cool ingenue
who is less self-assured than she appears. Her
scenes with Fergus are the heart and soul of
the the film; it is with some regret that we re
turn to the world around them. Dil's charac
ter is the most crucial to the film, and in
pulling it off, Davidson turns in one of the
year's best performances.
But the true star of Jordan's film is his in
tricately plotted screenplay, which relent
lessly forces us to examine our assumptions
and beliefs. Is an IRA volunteer necessarily a
psychopath? Or a British soldier a hard-line
patriot? And can love overcome our most
deeply rooted prejudices about race and gen
der? The script takes many twists and turns,
but Jordan anchors it firmly with a love story
that ultimately transcends the film's
poignant ending.
So if you're looking for the perfect date
movie, don't bother with "The Bodyguard."
Forget "Forever Young." And avoid "Al
addin." The film you want is "The Crying
Game." From the complicated topics of love,
race, sexuality, loyalty and political conflict,

it fashions a thrilling web of romance and
deceit that will hold you spellbound long
after the lights have come up.

Heart-wrenching
epic of romance
and a revolution

Indochine

Revolutionary Indochina in the '30s is a
powerfully poignant setting for "Indochine,"
the steamy love story of a French colonial of
ficer and a young Vietnamese woman. And
French director Regis Wargnier milks a heat
ed political climate for all the melodrama it's
worth.
Jean-Baptiste (Vincent Perez) and
Camille (Linh Dan Pham) fall in love against
a backdrop of communist invasions and na
tional unrest. Their romance is no relaxed
courting game; when they're not fleeing the
authorities, they're looking for food and
water to live.
The star of the movie is Catherine
Deneuve, as Eliane. She plays the daughter of
the French colonial ruler of Indochina, the
foster parent of Camille, whose elite Viet
namese parents are deceased. She finds her
self the short-time mistress of the sexy,
young officer Jean-Baptiste, who quickly
moves on to other conquests. Eliane is left
insulted and bitter when Camille indepen
dently falls in love with him.
Deneuve's performance as the narrator
with strong maternal ties to Camille and
mixed feelings of passion and hatred for
Jean-Baptiste, is one of the movie's greatest
strengths. In full bloom at age 50, Deneuve
combines the sex appeal of youth with the
distinction of experience. Even if you don't
care about the story, Deneuve makes you
want to hear it.
Perez plays his part well, although it's not
much of a part to play: all he has to do is act
sexy, and the women go wild. His character
does develop as the movie goes on. He starts

out a self-centered seducer and becomes the
faithful and adoring protector of Camille.
But one wonders how the change happened
so fast.
As Camille, Dan Pham is "irresistible" —
as Eliane says — with eyes that express what
words won't. However, her part onscreen is
largely passive; she's usually languishing
from love or fainting from starvation.
Wargnier films each scene with the utmost
care. Just after Camille has announced her new

passion to Eliane, who still burns with love for
Jean-Baptiste, the two women dance a slow
tango together, moving in unison in a subtly
competitive charade. Equally unforgettable is
the image of the two lovers sailing in a huge
moth-like junk among the awesome Southeast
Asian cliffs, trying to catch the last drops of
rainwater in their parched mouths. And the
scene where slave ships sail in the night to de
liver their shameful cargo will haunt the view
er long after the movie has ended.
"Indochine" is a masterful movie in every
sense, from the powerful acting to the politi

cally accurate plot to the artistically adept
filming and costuming. Even if the political
symbolism goes over your head, you can't
help being carried away by the passions of ro
mance and revolution.

Silly, sappy, but

Forever Young

Hollywood screenwriter Jeffrey Abrams
said he wanted to write a script about "some
one who represents the romance of America."
Instead he wrote "Forever Young," a film
about frozen men, eight-year-old airplane
pilots, and an Australian's naked butt.
"Forever Young" is not bad, but it lacks
good acting, clever plotting or innovative di
rection.
And yet, strangely enough, this sappy, pre
dictable picture has a way of working its way
into your heart.
The premise of the picture is fairly silly:
Mel Gibson plays Daniel, an Air Corps test
pilot who volunteers for a cryogenics experi
ment (where warm, breathing people are
turned into Butterball turkeys) after his
sweetheart Helen (Isabel Glasser) gets hit by
a fruit truck and turned into a vegetable.
Of course, something goes wrong, and he
doesn't get awakened until two kids screwing
around in a warehouse accidentally revive

him 53 years later.
What follows is about 45 minutes of
Daniel discovering the modern world — in
cluding everything from Hiroshima to
Thighmasters — before we get to the meat of
the movie. Ii turns cut, to no one's surprise,
that his sweetheart didn't really die (she
awakes from her coma shortly after Daniel
gels frozen) and Daniel quickly ages, regain
ing 53 years of wear and tear in about three
days.
Can Daniel see his love again before he
starts looking like Ronald Reagan? Movies
being what they are, of course he does. In
fact, the ending is syrupy, featuring a light
house, sunset and embracing silhouettes
aplenty.
The acting is weak, and the special effects
and direction are routine.
Yet, despite all its flaws, "Forever Young"
makes you feel warm and fuzzy when the two
old lovers get reunited. Sure, the movie is
sappy, romantic and predictable, but some
times a happy ending is just what you need.

Peter's Friends

Kenneth Branagh, director and star of
"Dead Again" and the 1989 film version of
"Henry V," returns with a comedy-drama to
test the convictions of everyone who hailed
him as the film wunderkind who could bring
Shakespeare to the masses.
"Peter's Friends" depicts the 10-year col
lege reunion of six English friends. The film
tries unsuccessfully to combine the comedy
of rekindling old relationships with the seri
ous problems that arise after those carefree
days in college.
At his country estate, Peter (Stephen Fry)
and his five companions try to work out
their particular neuroses — over-protective
parenting, alcoholism, nymphomania —
while clashing with their respective mates
and old friends.
On the lighter side, there are a few good
lines and witty comebacks—but none of the
inspired anger that a brilliant comic like
John Cleese can make work so well. Emma
Thompson, Branagh's real-life spouse, puts
in a good performance as a nervous introvert
trying to find a sexual identity: "Fill me with
your little babies," she begs a reluctant Peter.
Unfortunately, the comedy just isn't that
funny, overwhelmed by the "serious" issues
and the characters' incessant self-indulgence.
Rita Rudner, who wrote the screenplay, is
especially boring as a British-eye
view version of a vacuous Hollywood televi
sion star.
But her vulgarity is appealing next to the
self-absorbed whining of the more upper
crusty characters, who are apparently sup
posed to have more substance than she and
the few other lower-class figures in the film.
Peter's friends are a pretty dull bunch, de
fined solely in terms of their various prob
lems — which they never stop talking about.
Still, it might be a good idea for all gradu
ating seniors to see this movie, study the
characters and repeat to themselves, "I'll
never be like that, I'll never be like that..."

Roles reverse as
captor becomes
his own hostage

The Crying Game

In a year when riots followed the acquittal
of four white police officers in the brutal
beating of a black man, many critics mis
guidedly praise such films as "Unforgiven"
and"The Bodyguard" for downplaying
racial issues.
Writer-director Neil Jordan refuses to
take the easy way out, choosing instead to
confront the pervasive reality of racism and
other prejudices. And in doing so, he has cre
ated one of the richest and most complex
films of 1992.
"The Crying Game" begins in Ireland,
where the Irish Republican Army kidnaps a
black British soldier. If one of their comrades
is not released within three days, they will ex
ecute the hostage. During those three days,
the soldier, Jody (Forest Whitaker) and his
minder Fergus (Stephen Rea) slowly become
friends.
When Jody realizes that the IRA can't let
him go, he asks Fergus for a single favor: to
look up his girlfriend in London and tell her
that he was thinking of her.
On the day of the execution, the IRA op
eration goes horribly wrong. Fergus man
ages to escape to London, where he meets
Jody's mulatto girlfriend Dil (newcomer Jaye
Davidson), and finds himself powerfully at
tracted to her. They go out a few times, grow
ing closer on each occasion. Then, just as in
Hitchcock's "Vertigo," the film blindsides us
with a secret that changes our perception of
all that has gone before and all that will fol
low.
Rea is an unlikely romantic lead; he is
lithe, plain and seemingly unemotional. But
beneath that guarded facade lies a genuine
compassion and his seldom-seen crooked
smile which attracts us to him. We believe it
when he helps a tightly bound Jody to relieve
himself. We understand why Dil falls in love

with him. And we never lose sympathy for
him, even as he leads Jody to a remote clear
ing for the inevitable execution.
Jaye Davidson plays Dil as a cool ingenue
who is less self-assured than she appears. Her
scenes with Fergus are the heart and soul of
the the film; it is with some regret that we re
turn to the world around them. Dil's charac
ter is the most crucial to the film, and in
pulling it off, Davidson turns in one of the
year's best performances.
But the true star of Jordan's film is his in
tricately plotted screenplay, which relent
lessly forces us to examine our assumptions
and beliefs. Is an IRA volunteer necessarily a
psychopath? Or a British soldier a hard-line
patriot? And can love overcome our most
deeply rooted prejudices about race and gen
der? The script takes many twists and turns,
but Jordan anchors it firmly with a love story
that ultimately transcends the film's
poignant ending.
So if you're looking for the perfect date
movie, don't bother with "The Bodyguard."
Forget "Forever Young." And avoid "Al
addin." The film you want is "The Crying
Game." From the complicated topics of love,
race, sexuality, loyalty and political conflict,

it fashions a thrilling web of romance and
deceit that will hold you spellbound long
after the lights have come up.

Heart-wrenching
epic of romance
and a revolution

Indochine

Revolutionary Indochina in the '30s is a
powerfully poignant setting for "Indochine,"
the steamy love story of a French colonial of
ficer and a young Vietnamese woman. And
French director Regis Wargnier milks a heat
ed political climate for all the melodrama it's
worth.
Jean-Baptiste (Vincent Perez) and
Camille (Linh Dan Pham) fall in love against
a backdrop of communist invasions and na
tional unrest. Their romance is no relaxed
courting game; when they're not fleeing the
authorities, they're looking for food and
water to live.
The star of the movie is Catherine
Deneuve, as Eliane. She plays the daughter of
the French colonial ruler of Indochina, the
foster parent of Camille, whose elite Viet
namese parents are deceased. She finds her
self the short-time mistress of the sexy,
young officer Jean-Baptiste, who quickly
moves on to other conquests. Eliane is left
insulted and bitter when Camille indepen
dently falls in love with him.
Deneuve's performance as the narrator
with strong maternal ties to Camille and
mixed feelings of passion and hatred for
Jean-Baptiste, is one of the movie's greatest
strengths. In full bloom at age 50, Deneuve
combines the sex appeal of youth with the
distinction of experience. Even if you don't
care about the story, Deneuve makes you
want to hear it.
Perez plays his part well, although it's not
much of a part to play: all he has to do is act
sexy, and the women go wild. His character
does develop as the movie goes on. He starts

out a self-centered seducer and becomes the
faithful and adoring protector of Camille.
But one wonders how the change happened
so fast.
As Camille, Dan Pham is "irresistible" —
as Eliane says — with eyes that express what
words won't. However, her part onscreen is
largely passive; she's usually languishing
from love or fainting from starvation.
Wargnier films each scene with the utmost
care. Just after Camille has announced her new

passion to Eliane, who still burns with love for
Jean-Baptiste, the two women dance a slow
tango together, moving in unison in a subtly
competitive charade. Equally unforgettable is
the image of the two lovers sailing in a huge
moth-like junk among the awesome Southeast
Asian cliffs, trying to catch the last drops of
rainwater in their parched mouths. And the
scene where slave ships sail in the night to de
liver their shameful cargo will haunt the view
er long after the movie has ended.
"Indochine" is a masterful movie in every
sense, from the powerful acting to the politi

cally accurate plot to the artistically adept
filming and costuming. Even if the political
symbolism goes over your head, you can't
help being carried away by the passions of ro
mance and revolution.

Gibson freezes:
Silly, sappy, but
oddly satisfying

Forever Young

Hollywood screenwriter Jeffrey Abrams
said he wanted to write a script about "some
one who represents the romance of America."
Instead he wrote "Forever Young," a film
about frozen men, eight-year-old airplane
pilots, and an Australian's naked butt.
"Forever Young" is not bad, but it lacks
good acting, clever plotting or innovative di
rection.
And yet, strangely enough, this sappy, pre
dictable picture has a way of working its way
into your heart.
The premise of the picture is fairly silly:
Mel Gibson plays Daniel, an Air Corps test
pilot who volunteers for a cryogenics experi
ment (where warm, breathing people are
turned into Butterball turkeys) after his
sweetheart Helen (Isabel Glasser) gets hit by
a fruit truck and turned into a vegetable.
Of course, something goes wrong, and he
doesn't get awakened until two kids screwing
around in a warehouse accidentally revive

him 53 years later.
What follows is about 45 minutes of
Daniel discovering the modern world — in
cluding everything from Hiroshima to
Thighmasters — before we get to the meat of
the movie. Ii turns cut, to no one's surprise,
that his sweetheart didn't really die (she
awakes from her coma shortly after Daniel
gels frozen) and Daniel quickly ages, regain
ing 53 years of wear and tear in about three
days.
Can Daniel see his love again before he
starts looking like Ronald Reagan? Movies
being what they are, of course he does. In
fact, the ending is syrupy, featuring a light
house, sunset and embracing silhouettes
aplenty.
The acting is weak, and the special effects
and direction are routine.
Yet, despite all its flaws, "Forever Young"
makes you feel warm and fuzzy when the two
old lovers get reunited. Sure, the movie is
sappy, romantic and predictable, but some
times a happy ending is just what you need.
