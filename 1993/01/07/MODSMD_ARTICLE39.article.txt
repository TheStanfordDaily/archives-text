Converting a dorm room to a studio for a
rock band takes a little crowding, some in
novation and very understanding neigh
bors. Amps are propped up on chairs,
countless cords criss-cross the carpet, a
drum set fits neatly under the lofted bed,

backpacks.
This isn't the slick studio powwow that comes to

where dorm rooms and practice rooms double as
studios, band members skip practice to write pa
pers and the "big break" is an open fraternity
party.
