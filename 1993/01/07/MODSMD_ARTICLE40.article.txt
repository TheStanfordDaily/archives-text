charismatic blues rock with chronic rhythms for your face with a liberal dash of funk, driving, fast alternative, more melodic rock.music that makes you move, alternative rock like R.E.M., U2, INXS.

And trying to be a Michael Stipe or a Jim
Morrison reincarnate with a full load of class
es can easily take its toll — as some members
of Where's Julio have proven in the past.
Three of its members once ended up on acad
emic probation one quarter when the band
was practicing for a gig, said saxophonist
Nick Brown.
At whatever expense, though, Stanford
musicians are still finding time to compensate
for the somewhat lacking Palo Alto nightlife,
filling the lull between papers and problem
sets with some pretty decent music.
The musical repertoires of campus bands
range from R.E.M. to classic rock to more
R.E.M. And many more bands bravely ven
ture into the uncharted territory of (gulp)
composing and performing originals.
While the introduction of an original
sometimes gives dance floor crowds a sudden
urge to go outside for some fresh air or maybe
to shove their way back to the bar, Stanford
bands still swear by the no-pandering-to-audi
ences rule. And the bands play on. The ulti
mate ambitions of every band vary slightly —
some are content just to play for the sake of
playing, while others look ahead to the "real
world" with career aspirations.
Even so, the roots of Stanford music pretty
much remain the same for all band members.
Despite Young Orpheus' plans to break into
the professional music scene and the serious
ness with which members regard their music,
guitarist and vocalist Chad Dyer, a senior,
echoes the "fun" aspect of the campus band
experience at Stanford.
"I can't deny it's fun to play at a big party
and have everyone bopping around," he said.

Jonestown Koolaid
Members: Paul Stasi (guitar), Eric Akre (gui
tar), Matt Clark (bass), Christian Heath
(drums)
Years as a group: one
Style: "High intensity with a touch o'
grunge."
This band is loud. Really loud. Then again,
cramming four instrumentalists into an ATO
one-room double tends to create greater
than-normal reverberations.
Some of the band members even wear
earplugs.
Jonestown Koolaid in its current form is
only a few months old. Last year's lead singer
had departed and guitarist Akre, a freshman,
signed on shortly after his arrival at Stanford.
While band members have been unsuccess
ful so far in their search for a replacement
lead singer who fits their style, they have had
better luck with Akre.
As he and Stasi improvise in tandem during
"Combat Boot," a driving, hard-core instru
mental, it is clear that Akre has gelled with the
band members and their style of music.
Listening to band members talk and play,
one gets the sense that Jonestown Koolaid is
an emerging band on the threshold of some
thing big.
They have achieved a solid style and sound
with their favorite musical influences and
covers — which include Pixies, the Clash and
R.E.M. — and enjoy improvising and com
posing original instrumentals.
Yet band members express frustration at
their lack of a singer. Their repertoire consists
of covers and original instrumentals. They

want to write original music, they have the
ideas, but "it's so hard to write originals with
out someone to write lyrics," Akre said.
Currently, juniors Stasi and Clark stand in as
vocalists.
Fornaka
Members: Guitar, vocals: Raj Dosanjh (guitar
and vocals), Jason Weiss (bass), Rich Hesp
(guitar), Jack Bowen (drums), senior
Years as a group: six

months
Style: "Fast R.E.M.? Naw, it's just ...
Fornaka."
Since its formation last spring, Fornaka has
set out a lofty task for themselves — to devel
op a repertoire of originals, and only origi
nals.
Although the band does cover a couple of
"lesser-known" songs, Weiss, a senior, said
Fornaka members have sacrificed developing
an instant playlist to pursue their passion for
composing.
Putting together enough songs to constitute
a substantial performance — at least an hour
or two — is a tall order, considering the work
and time that goes into creating a song from
scratch, he said.
Each member writes lyrics and music on
their own, Weiss said. "Usually, someone
brings in some lyrics and explains 'This is I
want it to go,' and the rest of us will suggest
things to add on," said Bowen, a sophomore.
The actual song comes together in practice
as the writer presents the basic idea and
members collaborate on and critique the
piece. But they are still careful to "respect
each other's musical integrity," Weiss said.
What emerges are songs and lyrics that are
based on the original style of the composer
and take on the unique sound of the band as
it comes together:
The hazy dreams of the misled blind/ Don't
help the deaf hear the silent war/ The curved
one's friend wants not her kind/ Molly turn that
wheel just a little bit more. — "Don't Blink"
While the band has begun to break into the
Stanford music scene — they played at a Fhi
Delt party last fall — Weiss said Fornaka is
still "not getting nearly as much" as the aver
age campus band, which gets about $200 per
party.
But "when you're starting out, money can't
be a priority," Weiss added.
Young Orpheus
Members: Chad Dyer (guitar and vocals),
Sean Bennett (guitar), Eric Selvik (bass)
Years as a group: two and a half
Style: driving, fast alternative (Isn't everything
"alternative" these days?)
While turning a college band experience
into a career may conjure up "images of a

male adolescent fantasy" — as Yount

Orpheus' manager

senio

Jim Haljun put it — the band's members are
looking to create music on a much more seri
ous level.
Selvik, who graduated last year, said the
idea that of playing in a band as a career can
be "scary" at times, but developing his own
passion for music and the certainty of his
ambitions has led people to take him more
seriously.
The band was formed two and a half years
ago, as "Voice of Harold." But when band
members decided to play all originals, they
changed their name, which was a cover of an
R.E.M. song itself.
Since making the switch to all originals,
they have put together an hour and a half of
music, and recently landed their first off-cam
pus gig — a mid-January stint at Spike's Cafe
in San Francisco.
While the band members were thrilled to
get the "big break" into the "real" music
world, Bennett said the experience has made
them realize the drawbacks of playing outside
of Stanford.
"I'm a little frustrated dealing with people
in the (San Francisco) music scene," said
Bennett. "The people who are in charge of the

about his decision to join the band.
Last year, Kumar organized the
Committee for Original Music by Stanford
Students and proposed to get funds from
ASSU to record a compilation CD of music
by campus bands. But this proposal failed to
pass in the spring election.
Three months ago, the band trimmed
down to a three piece after creative differences
led to the departure of one bandmate. They
are now recording a demo tape, hoping to
land a contract with an independent label.
Where's Julio?
Members: Nick Brown (saxophone), Tim
Choy ceyboards), Joe Kraus (drums), Ryan
Mclnt, re (guitar), Daniel Soto (bass), Mark
Van Haren (vocals)
Years as a group: three
Style: jazzy funk, bluesy funk, grungy funk
The new year finds Where's Julio moving
in a new direction. South.
The band, which won Phi Kappa Psi's
Battle of the Bands last year, has lined up
shows this month at other college campuses
like Pomona College, making the big move
outside the Stanford campus.
Where's Julio has been known as a cover
band playing songs like "Walk This Way," but
the band is beginning to create a few of its
own songs.
So far, the band has six songs with no
lyrics. "We're a musical powerhouse but a
lyrical black hole," said Van Haren. "For some
reason, the music comes a lot easier."
Where's Julio derived its name from the
name of a guy who called the band in
response to a want ad for a bassist and never
called again. Band members say they've met
people who know Julio, but no one in the
band has ever actually met him.
The band's goal is simple: to have people
dance when they play.
Where's Julio will play Jan. 8, at an Elvis
party at Soto where they will perform covers
of Elvis Presley songs.

clubs tend to be less responsible than
people at Stanford."
Nevertheless, Dyer said getting the
gig was a "validation of the time we've put
into it."

Mindslam
Members: Vic Barclay (bass), Steve Guzman
(drums), Srini Kumar (vocals and guitar)
Vears as a group: three
ityle: "It's still pop you can slam to."
Mindslam is an ethnic stew with various
ngredients — Japanese, Mexican, Indian and
ewish — spiced with guitar distortions and
:atchy choruses. Its original compositions fall
.inder the category of punk rock.
Barclay is the only member who has had
iny formal music lessons; Kumar and
Guzman are both self-trained.
"They sucked originally, but something
about them fascinated me," said Barclay

We're a musical powerhouse but a lyrical black hole, rockabilly, classic rock. Fast R.E.M. grunge, good old-fashioned rock and roll with a twist of funk, punk rock, post-modern. Led Zeppellnesque riffs.

Members: Brett Gaines (guitar and vocals),
Shira Foulcard (vocals), Anton Schwartz (sax
ophone), Greg Thomas (drums and percus
sion), Ben Verdier (bass)
Years as a group: four, but less than half a
year in its present form
Style: jazzy, funky, rhythm and blues, soul
music from the '70s and '80s
The little kids who came to feed the pet
while the owner was away spawned the name
Feed the Iguana. This band, composed of
three members of the now defunct Virginia
Sigh, decided that a new lineup deserved a
new name.
But its sound remains the same. While the
band has abandoned some songs, like
"Superfreak" and"Been Caught Stealing" for
a "more mature" sound, Schwartz said, there's
still "a strong emphasis on music that makes
you move."
A cover band with a repertoire of over 50
songs, they have toyed with the idea of even
tually doing originals. In the meantime they
are happy to play covers. "I think we've found
lots of ways to breathe life into songs," said
Thomas.
The band has distributed a demo tape
with the new lineup and is now waiting to
land its first gig in its revised form. Band
members say audiences can expect more
emphasis on improvisation and solos in their
performances.
The band has a clean, professional sound
that reflects the musical talents of the mem
bers. Verdier and Thomas are classically
