Platypus Rex
Members: Steve Buddie (vocals), Mark
Kraus (drummer), Jeff Springer (guitar), Ro
Wietecha (bass)
Years as a group: two
Style: alternative rock like R.E.M., U2,
INXS
Hoping to be a part of the whole Seattle
scene, members of Platypus Rex went up
north last summer to play in the city where
Nirvana and Pearl Jam got their starts.
Unfortunately for the band, clubs were
booked until October, leaving them to try
their luck playing frat parties in Seattle.
Not only did Platypus Rex get a taste of
the music scene in Seattle, but the band
also used the time to write some original
songs.
"It was a period of investment," said
Springer. "Playing covers is fun, but we

wanted to express ourselves more musical
ly." The new songs are what he characterizes
as being "more melodic rock."
But the switch to performing originals
was not smooth.
At campus parties, when Buddie would
announce, "This is an original," people
would start leaving, Springer said. "Now,
we've gotten to the point where we can play
originals and people won't leave."
The band is currently sending its five
song demo tape to venues outside the
Stanford campus. In winter quarter, the band
will go back to the studio to record another
demo tape to send to record companies.
Shagwagon
Members: Max Barnett (bass), John
Borland (guitar), Dan Catherwood
(drums), Mike Drake (guitar), Ivan Garcia
(vocals)
Years as a group: three
Style: "Hiisker Dii meets the Smiths."
Tension between band members some
times leads to a band's demise. However,
with Shagwagon, it allowed for new musical
territory to be explored.

"The most tensions had been from the
songwriting and rehearsals," said Drake. For
the band's first two years, Drake and Garcia
collaborated on material and then intro
duced it to the band. "It took us a while
before we realized everybody wasn't happy
with that."
Now the entire band participates in the
songwriting process, incorporating a wider
range of musical preferences, from classic
rock to Sonic Youth to the Smiths.
Initially, Shagwagon's music was "lighter"
— a lot closer to the Smiths, Garcia's favorite
band. Their music now has a more energized
sound. The guitars aren't as subtle; they per
vade the songs with a loud distortion.
Most of the songs they perform are
originals, although they do admit to playing
some obscure covers like "Molly's Lips" by
Nirvana.
The band plans to go back into the studio
to record a demo tape to send to indie labels.
Uncle Wiggly
Members: Dan Catherwood (guitar and
vocals), Doug Dorst (guitar), David Falzone
(bass), David Gomez (vocals and percus
sion), Sid Heaton (drums)

Years as a group: three
Style: blues rock
A blues rock band without guitars
would be like Well, suffice to say, that if
the members of Uncle Wiggly hadn't
expanded their musical horizons past their
first instruments, that's what they would
have been. Four drummers and a pianist.
Luckily, the band members have learned
other instruments and are now playing
what they call "charismatic blues rock with
chronic rhythms for your face with a liberal
dash of funk." The band mostly plays covers
of Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan
and Neil Young.
"We try to play all the really cool songs
they don't play on the radio," Falzone said.
Lately, the band has also been experi
menting with doing original songs which
have received a great response. "We had
people dancing in the Coffee House," said
Catherwood, a graduate student and the
only band member still attending Stanford.
