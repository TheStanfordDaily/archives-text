It's the best and
brightest, not to
mention biggest

The Smiths

Most alternative rock groups have nei
ther the talent nor the egos to issue retro
spective albums. Not so the Smiths, who,
a decade after their rise to brief-but
cultish stardom, have finally released not
one but two collections of their greatest
hits.
"Best I" and "Best II" showcase the now
defunct group in all its pouting morbidity.
With 14 tracks per album covering 1983-87,

it's safe to assume that "Best" is as good as it
gets.
And when the Smiths are good, they're
very, very good. Only in retrospect can the
stylishness and sheer volume of the Smiths'
catalogue be appreciated.
"Best I" features such essential Smiths
tracks as "Girlfriend In A Coma," "Panic,"
"Shoplifters OfThe World Unite" and "How
Soon Is Now?"
"Best II" follows up with a trio of 1986
hits — "Ask," "Bigmouth Strikes Again" and
"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out" —
as well as perennial favorites, "Shakespeare's
Sister" and "Heaven Knows I'm Miserable
Now."
If nothing else, the albums prove once
and for all that all Smiths songs do not
sound the same. It also reminds us why, 10
years later, these songs arc as popular than
ever, if not more so. Haven't we all wanted to
"drop our trousers to the world" at some
time or another?
But the collection's most exciting revela
tion is Morrisscy in his younger, humbler,
pre-deification days. Before becoming
God's gift to Live 105, the "last of the fa
mous international playboys" was a gifted
songwriter Whose "Half A Person" gave
hope to socially inept, asexual white boys
everywhere.
As with any compilation, the "Best" dis
tinction is dubious. (Do we really need an
other "Reel Around The Fountain?" What
ever happened to "The Queen Is Dead?")
But this long overdue set is a solemn sou
venir of the group that spawned it and the
perfect soundtrack for a broken heart or a
rainy afternoon.

Cocky Connick
corrupts classic
keyboard tunes

Harry Connick Jr.

"This is about as raw as it gets," Harry
Connick Jr. writes in the typically
schmaltzy liner notes to "25," his latest
album. Gone are the big band sounds that
made the Marky Mark of jazz famous. Rely
ing solely on Connick's voice and his piano,
"25" has the feel of a smoky, acoustically
challenged cabaret. It's more intimate than

his previous efforts, and hence its flaws are
more obvious.
On "25," Connick takes 13 timeless clas
sics and reworks them in his own special,
self-indulgent way. For better or for worse,
"On The Street Where You Live" will never
sound the same.
From the sappy "This Time The
Dream's On Me" to the swingy "Didn't He
Ramble" to the strictly silly "I'm An Old
Cowhand (From The Rio Grande)," Con
nick delivers an eclectic bunch of vocal
and instrumental selections so overloaded
with Johnny Mercer tunes that one won
ders why he even bothers with other com
posers, Duke Ellington and John Coltrane
among them.
It was probably a mistake to open the
album with "Stardust," which features Ellis
Marsalis on piano. Marsalis' accompani
ment is far more interesting than Connick's
vocals, and Connick's own keyboard style
suffers in comparison.
His single-piano approach makes sense
on virtuoso pieces like "Muskrat Ramble"
and a smoldering "After You've Gone." But
it generally cheats songs like "Tangerine"
and "Caravan," which would be infinitely
better served by a full orchestra. It's no co
incidence that his most successful piece,
"On The Atchison, Topeka And The Santa
Fe," is the only one backed by a jazz trio.
You can't dance to "25;" you can't even
sing along. Every song is stretched to
roughly three times its original length, per
haps to compensate for the glaring lack of
instrumentation. At 25, Connick remains a
witty and compelling musician, but he's be
ginning to show his youth.
