# Cheap thrills
## Sports, sex and small change

Ah, Nevada. Prostitution is
legal. Gambling is legal. People
on the street fondle each other's
breasts at will.
For one short weekend — or
two if you're ambitious — you
and 60 of your most intimate
friends can leave campus to enjoy
the best Nevada has to offer: ski
ing, casinos and secluded little
sleeping bags built for two.
There is nothing quite like the
dorm ski trip.
The time has come to create
those embarrassing stories your
best friends will rub in your face
for years all in the comfort of
your painfully small, yet tasteful
ly decorated cabin.
From the white blanketed
mountains to the red carpeted
casinos to the pseudo-woodsy
rust brown of your dorm-away
from-home, there has never been
such an opportunity to prove you
can be just as stupid as the next
Stanford student, given the
chance.
You too can be the hero to
drive through Sacramento with
high hopes, only to return with a
spanking new cast, hopelessly
empty pockets and lost virginity.
Dare to dream.
After exhausting all the pizza
parlors in Truckee, Calif, during
your first night in Tahoe, you
have to go gambling. The casinos
are the next best thing to the wild
and wacky freshman advisor din
ners. The loss of oodles of money

nied by cheap
food, free drinks and magnificent
live entertainment by famous
polka masters. Hold me back.
So you're not 21... claim to be
some child actor: the unpopular
kid on "Beverly Hills 90210" or
something. If you're losing
money, it's highly doubtful that
your friendly hosts in Reno are
going to deny you a chance to
have some fun.
But be sure to enjoy the free
drink specials. This is leisure ac
tivity on a grand scale, and it will
be much easier to open that wal
let and allow your friendly dealer
to give you genuinely helpful
"tips" on the game after a few
drinks. If nothing else, you can go
back to your cabin with a stylish
new set of stolen tropical drink
glasses, after going down in
flames.
Don't think you'll get away
with spectating, either. The only
way to get anything resembling a
comfortable seat in the casinos is
if you're going to shell out some
money, so you have to give in and
sit down at the tables, buy a drink
from the bar or try to brave the
smoke cloud of the sports bars on
the second floor. The joys of the
sporting life.
Picking your game is the most
crucial step in the gambling expe
rience. How you blow your
grandparents' trust fund is just as
important as how big it is.
Roulette is your best bet, as a sure

way to lose lots of money over an
extended period of time. Or try
slot machines, for that powerful,
mechanical feel and those dizzy
ing little dancing fruits.
But if you want to blow it all,
go for craps. Craps is one of those
games that is hard to understand
if you're sober, and with the extra
boost of some Long Island iced
tea, the odds against you couldn't
get any better.
As you stumble back into your
cabin, the chance for the Great
Dorm Hook Up has arrived: 60
sexually frustrated hormone
monsters, many of whom have
broken up with their high-school
sweethearts over winter break,
are crammed into three bed
rooms, a living room and those
"whimsically" creative stairways.
In a frenzy of blankets, flannel
pajamas and warm hands, you
can revel in an orgiastic escape.
The lights will be off, and you
won't necessarily know whom
your love partners are, so be
aware of any tropical disease your
snow bunnies might have, and
their compatibility with your sex
ual preferences, before proceed
ing.
Trying to get a bed will be fu
tile, but climbing in closets only
to emerge during others' roman
tic moments is always a fun op
tion. Mass showers, though less
hygienically correct, can also be
the stuff myths are made of.
Or you can be lame and cook
excruciating spaghetti for your
less-than-thankful dormmates.
Or even worse: you could ski.
