Chopin show

The last word 0n...

It has suddenly become hip to be alternative.
Girls of 14 are buying $90 Doc Martens ("No
steel toes, Mom") and having long conversa
tions about their own, tiny dyslexic hearts.
Wearing flannel and big, dumb, sock hats
seems quaint in a kind of David Lynch way,
but when everyone in your high school is
doing it, it smells a little too much like those

No Mozart.
No Tchaikovsky.
No Bach.
But if you're in the mood for some Chopin, you
won't want to miss pianist Garrick Ohlsson, who
will be performing an exclusive all-Chopin pro
gram at Memorial Auditorium Sunday Jan. 10.
Ohlsson is a highly renowned pianist, who has re
ceived numerous distinctions including being the
only American ever to win the Warsaw Chopin
Competition. In addition, he received consecutive
Grammy nominations in 1990 and 1991.
The performance will include nine Chopin pieces
and will begin at 2:30 p.m.
Tickets range from $19 to $25, with special stu
dent discounts, through Bass and the Tresidder
Ticket Office.

Because, really, what else has changed be
sides the terminology? Even band names
aren't that much stranger, really. Is "The
Mighty Lemondrops" somehow less logical
than "The Strawberry Alarm Clock?"
And as that little "college music" section
in Rolling Stone blends more and more with

Oooooh, purdy. On display in the Center for In
tegrated Systems and theTerman Engineering Cen
ter is "Working in the Fourth Dimension," an ex
hibit of fiber works by artist Ragnhild Langlet. Lan
glet, who was designated a "California Living Leg
end" in 1985, draws from the Scandinavian tradi
tion for her vat-dyed and nuihaku works in fiber.
Her large, hanging works combine innovative
techniques including patchwork, applique and em
broidery and are intricately woven and dyed against
natural linen backgrounds. They will be on display
until Feb. 15 in CIS, located at Campus Drive and
Via Palou, and on the second floor of Terman.

the regular top 50, us crazy, college kids will
be forced to listen to worse and worse music
until not even our own college bands will be
able to tolerate playing it.
I don't think, anyone wants that. Except some
slimy agent from L.A. who plans to exploit this
country's youth until he owns the Space Needle.

goin's on

alternative

OK, it's the
beginning of
the quarter
-timetoshmooze,
goof off, spend your
Christmas money and
make up for all the
time you didn't get
during that really short
little thing they called a
break but was at best
only a cheap imitation.
So, what to do:
• RAVE! Sweat
from 8 p.m. until 5
a.m. at CafAend, Jan. 8

at the Coffee House.
It's free and includes music by DJ Harry
Who?, DJ Bernard from the Edge, DJ Scott
from Deep Space and KZSU DJs Unknown,
Francesco and Plastech. Japanese animation
by Chill Space will be shown, dinner will be
served until midnight, and organizers are
working on an after-party place to keep the
rave going until breakfast. A fruit bar, juice
bar, dumb bar, regular smart bar and smart
cotton candy will all be available.
• Smiling skeletons! Oingo Boingo
will be at the Warfield in San Francisco Jan.
8, 9 and 10. Frontman Danny Elfman, who
wrote "The Simpsons" theme and many
other nifty soundtracks, will head up a real
dead man's party. The doors open at 7 p.m.
and tickets are available at Bass. Call (415)
775-7722 for more information.
• Jeff Koons — modern artist, self
promotionist, kitsch's firstborn son — will
speak tonight at the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art. The lecture, an effort to ex
plain Koons' philosophy, is titled "Who is Jeff
Koons?" It is part of a lecture series stem
ming from the current Koons exhibit at the
museum, which runs through Feb. 6. The ex
hibit includes, among other weird items, a
statue of Michael Jackson and his chimp
Bubbles and a photo collection of Koons and
his porn queen wife, in a variety of unmen
tionable positions. Tickets are available

The remainder of the series tickets are avail
able through SFMOMA, at (415) 252-4102.
