# Once upon a time, there was a treatise
## 
### 
I knew something was awry. A
made-for-television movie that
had nothing to do with the
murder of a centerfold was getting
primetime exposure. And even
though Drew Barrymore finally
looked more seductive than she did
in "E.T." I knew better than to sac
rifice key so-you-still-prefer-floral
bras time with my high-school girl
friend over break.
But last week, everyone in this
country who didn't have cable and
still remembers enough of that
"Babes" show to categorically avoid
Fox had to watch one of three ver
sions of the Amy Fisher story.
"Who are these people?" I won
dered. "And are they the ones who
keep Prince 'Valiant' in print?"
And I wondered if it was you, oh
gentle reader. You who, permitted
to shake off that veil of prudish
academia for just two weeks, laid
on your back under your television
in a misguided effort to look up
Alyssa Milano's skirt. I wondered if
you were all alone in your parents'
basement, trying to recapture that
one lone miniseries memory of
shedding a brief tear or two while
watching Kris Kristofferson hero
ically stave off the Russians in
"Amerika."
But as I looked at the ratings, I re
alized it was more than just you. It
was you and your 30 million closest
friends. And if I know anything
about you, the size of your basement
and that pesky little sister of yours,
that just wasn't going to happen.
But as I stepped up my cynical
tirade like David Letterman with
out his valium, I realized the peo
ple who watched Drew Barrymore
don a bad Long Island accent and
mount a mechanic on a washing
machine even though they knew
damn well that the networks don't
show nudity unless it'sMariel Hem
mingway weren't to be blamed.
No, it wasn't the viewer's fault.
America's writers had failed them.
There is no lack of wit or whim
sy in American writing. They dress
a 40-year-old guy in a permanent
mailman suit, make him live witlT
his mother and spend all his time
in a bar. They drop a fat alien from
the sky in a large egg and make him
age backward. They make the en
tire female cast of "Star Trek" —
whether human or better — wear
lycra.
But there are no more stories.
No more giant, all-encompassing,
Herodotus-size epics. Even the
great writers of our times — the
Thomas Wolfes, the Joyce Carol
Oates, the Sidney Sheldons — only
offer us better-written versions of
our own pathetic lives.
Even if, to us, Homer's writing
seems old and sticky, he still told
stories. People were turned into
pigs, guys got caught between Scyl

la and Charbywhatever, and one
eyed-monsters gave men an excuse
to cling to the underside of sheep.
Our writers — even our James
Joyces, our Samuel Becketts and
our Virginia Woolfs — became so
obsessed with the aesthetic they
have failed to give us what we most
need: a good story.
And without stories — without
the mirror of tragedy to affirm our
own suffering — people have had
to turn to reality and distort it to try
to meet their needs. "Americas
Most Wanted," "Cops," the mere
existence of Bob Saget — these
seemingly inexplicable cultural
phenomena can be explained
through our willingness to sink to
pathetic depths for the basic need
to hear a story.
Like little kids willing to sit Indi
an style in front of a frightening
looking 60-year-old librarian
showing way too much cleavage
just so they can figure out why Hor
ton gives a "hoot," we watch all
three versions of the Amy Fisher
story.
But this wretched existence can
not continue for long, my friends,
no matter how clever, how post
post-modernist, how "Short Atten
tion Span Theater" our clever writ
ers and producers get.
Eventually America will feel
guilty for watching the creator and
star of "Teen Steam" hike up her
miniskirt. Eventually we will have
heard too much of Amy's perspec
tive, Mary Jo's take and ABC's gutsy
use of the omniscient narrator.
Eventually the non-story will not
fulfill us, and we will have nothing
left except repeats of "The Patty
Duke Show." And from there, it
won't be long before some wise
acre challenges the genetic possibil
ity of "identical cousins."
"Art is not an imitation of nature
by its metaphysical supplement; it
is raised up beside it in order to
overcome it."
America has been Buttafuocoed.

But as I looked at the ratings, I re
alized it was more than just you. It
was you and your 30 million closest
friends. And if I know anything
about you, the size of your basement
and that pesky little sister of yours,
that just wasn't going to happen.
But as I stepped up my cynical
tirade like David Letterman with
out his valium, I realized the peo
ple who watched Drew Barrymore
don a bad Long Island accent and
mount a mechanic on a washing
machine even though they knew
damn well that the networks don't
show nudity unless it'sMariel Hem
mingway weren't to be blamed.
No, it wasn't the viewer's fault.
America's writers had failed them.
There is no lack of wit or whim
sy in American writing. They dress
a 40-year-old guy in a permanent
mailman suit, make him live witlT
his mother and spend all his time
in a bar. They drop a fat alien from
the sky in a large egg and make him
age backward. They make the en
tire female cast of "Star Trek" —
whether human or better — wear
lycra.
But there are no more stories.
No more giant, all-encompassing,
Herodotus-size epics. Even the
great writers of our times — the
Thomas Wolfes, the Joyce Carol
Oates, the Sidney Sheldons — only
offer us better-written versions of
our own pathetic lives.
Even if, to us, Homer's writing
seems old and sticky, he still told
stories. People were turned into
pigs, guys got caught between Scyl

la and Charbywhatever, and one
eyed-monsters gave men an excuse
to cling to the underside of sheep.
Our writers — even our James
Joyces, our Samuel Becketts and
our Virginia Woolfs — became so
obsessed with the aesthetic they
have failed to give us what we most
need: a good story.
And without stories — without
the mirror of tragedy to affirm our
own suffering — people have had
to turn to reality and distort it to try
to meet their needs. "Americas
Most Wanted," "Cops," the mere
existence of Bob Saget — these
seemingly inexplicable cultural
phenomena can be explained
through our willingness to sink to
pathetic depths for the basic need
to hear a story.
Like little kids willing to sit Indi
an style in front of a frightening
looking 60-year-old librarian
showing way too much cleavage
just so they can figure out why Hor
ton gives a "hoot," we watch all
three versions of the Amy Fisher
story.
But this wretched existence can
not continue for long, my friends,
no matter how clever, how post
post-modernist, how "Short Atten
tion Span Theater" our clever writ
ers and producers get.
Eventually America will feel
guilty for watching the creator and
star of "Teen Steam" hike up her
miniskirt. Eventually we will have
heard too much of Amy's perspec
tive, Mary Jo's take and ABC's gutsy
use of the omniscient narrator.
Eventually the non-story will not
fulfill us, and we will have nothing
left except repeats of "The Patty
Duke Show." And from there, it
won't be long before some wise
acre challenges the genetic possibil
ity of "identical cousins."
"Art is not an imitation of nature
by its metaphysical supplement; it
is raised up beside it in order to
overcome it."
America has been Buttafuocoed.

Joel Stein would once again like to re
mind vou that the characters por
trayed in his column are fictional
ana that any resemblance to real
people and events — whether living,
dead or in Palo Alto — is strictly co
incidental. His column will appear
here weekly until this little italics
part is actually longer than his col
umn.
