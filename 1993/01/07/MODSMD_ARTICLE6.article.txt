# Libraries get bar-codes
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
The future is now for patrons of
the engineering and physics li
braries, thanks to a new automat
ed bar-coding system ready for use
there this quarter.
All Stanford libraries will even
tually follow in these libraries'
footsteps as part of an estimated
four-year project to bar-code Uni
versity materials and to integrate
library operations.
According to Steven Gass, head
librarian at Terman Engineering
Library, the system was "turned
on" Dec. 21 for the first time.
It allows students, faculty and
staff to check out materials by
simply having their University
IDs read by scanners at the circu
lation desk. Previously, library
users had to fill out time-consum
ing charge cards.
The transition to the integra
tion system, called NOTIS, will
cost approximately $1 million per
year, the mtyority of the money
coming from reallocation of cur
rent library funds.

NOTIS will also allow libraries
to block "delinquent" patrons —
those with fines and overdue
books — from checking out mate
rials before they "have cleared
their outstanding obligations to
the libraries," Gass said.
Under the new overdue policy,
to be enforced as NOTIS is in
stalled in other libraries, fines
will be charged immediately from
the due date until the borrowed
material is returned, Gass said.
In the past, an overdue notice was
sent out before fines were as
sessed.
Gass said the bar-coding allows
for "better inventory control," be
cause library staff will be provided
with data on the use of library ma
terials.
In addition, the bar-coding will
allow people to check the availabil
ity of books through the Socrates
program on library computers.
However, Gass said automa
tion will not make human librari
ans obsolete. "I don't think there
is a direct relationship between
the new system and staffing lev
els," he said.
