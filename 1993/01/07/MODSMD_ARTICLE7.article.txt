Searching for innovative solu

ailing economy, Gov. Pete Wilson

Secretary of State George Shultz,
a distinguished fellow at the
Hoover Institution, will chair a
new state economic advisory
board.

Shultz will face a daunting task
as head of the governor's Council
of Economic Policy Advisors, a
group proposed by Wilson to ad
vise him on matters of economic
policy which affect the state.
During his annual State of the
State speech, Wilson outlined Cal
ifornia's continuing economic
maladies and suggested this coun
cil could play an integral part in
bringing about an economic turn
around.
"California is in crisis. We have
lost 800,000 jobs. At least one in
10 Californians is out of work,"
Wilson told a joint session of the
state Legislature.
"California abounds in eco
nomic expertise," he said. "I think

it's time for California to benefit
from the wisdom of a Council of
Economic Policy Advisors."
According to information sup
plied by Shultz's office, thecouncil
will meet about four times a year
and report directly to the gover
nor. The group will be composed of
private citizens and will not be
funded by the state.
In addition to having headed
the State Department, Shultz,

who holds an ap
pointment at the
Graduate School
of Business, was
the chairman of
President Rea
gan's Economic
Policy Advisory
Council for seven
years.

Prior to his Shultz
tenure at Stanford and the Rea
gan administration, Shultz was
Secretary of the Treasury under
President Nixon. He has also been
director of the Office of Manage
ment and Budget as well as Secre
tary of Labor.
"I don't think you could find a
better man for the job. He ran the
U.S. Treasury," said Business
School Prof. Ezra Solomon. "He's
trusted by economists, by busi
nessmen and by labor."
Hoover Fellow John Bunzel

said he did not think "anyone
from either party will find fault
with this appointment."
Shultz was unavailable for
comment last night.
In this speech, Wilson called
for an earnings tax credit for the
purchase of manufacturing
equipment in order to spur manu
facturing job growth.
"This is one of the first ques
tions I want to put before this
new council," asked Wilson.
"Whether and how California can
offer this incentive in so challeng
ing a time, a time of both budget
gap and painfully high unemploy
ment."
The council is expected to deal
with this issue as well as with
small business loans, research

and development tax credits and
small business investment tax
credits.
But Bunzel cautioned that
Shultz's council will only have as
much impact as Wilson will allow.
"Whether or not the council
will be more than a figurehead
remains to be seen," Bunzel said.
It will be "determined by the level
the governor turns to them. The
council can be recommendatory,
it can make studies and it can give
the governor and the Legislature
the benefit of its advice."
Solomon said Shultz's exten
sive leadership background will
make him effective in proposing
economic reform.
"He brings experience and
knowledge to the job," Solomon
said. "He has shown leadership at
the national and world level.
There's no reason why he can't
apply all his knowledge to this
state."
