board.

Wilson's address, page 3.

Shultz will face a daunting task
as head of the governor's Council
of Economic Policy Advisors, a
group proposed by Wilson to ad
vise him on matters of economic
policy which affect the state.
During his annual State of the
State speech, Wilson outlined Cal
ifornia's continuing economic
maladies and suggested this coun
cil could play an integral part in
bringing about an economic turn
around.
"California is in crisis. We have
lost 800,000 jobs. At least one in
10 Californians is out of work,"
Wilson told a joint session of the
state Legislature.
"California abounds in eco
nomic expertise," he said. "I think

it's time for California to benefit
from the wisdom of a Council of
Economic Policy Advisors."
According to information sup
plied by Shultz's office, thecouncil
will meet about four times a year
and report directly to the gover
nor. The group will be composed of
private citizens and will not be
funded by the state.
In addition to having headed
the State Department, Shultz,

who holds an ap
pointment at the
Graduate School
of Business, was
the chairman of
President Rea
gan's Economic
Policy Advisory
Council for seven
years.

Prior to his Shultz
tenure at Stanford and the Rea
gan administration, Shultz was
Secretary of the Treasury under
President Nixon. He has also been
director of the Office of Manage
ment and Budget as well as Secre
tary of Labor.
"I don't think you could find a
better man for the job. He ran the
U.S. Treasury," said Business
School Prof. Ezra Solomon. "He's
trusted by economists, by busi
nessmen and by labor."
