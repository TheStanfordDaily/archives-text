After conquering the interna
tional swimming world with her
four-medal performance at the
1992 Summer 01>mpics, junior
Summer Sanders now faces a
more difficult task â€” a sometimes
too-adoring public.
Mason Crist, 37, of Wat
sonville, was arrested Dec. 31 on
charges of peeking while loitering
outside Sanders' Roseville home
after making repeated unan
nounced visits. He pleaded not
guilty at his arraignment Monday.
"It's really sad that it had to
come to this," said Sanders, who
enrolled again at Stanford this
quarter after stopping out to
train. "[Crist] never came and at

tacked me or anything, but the
whole thinggot to be a little ridicu
lous."
Crist, who wrote to Sanders
shortly after the former Cardinal
star returned home from the
Olympics, has allegedly made nu
merous attempts to contact her
both at home and at Stanford over
the past five months.
Crist faces a maximum of six
months in prison and a $1,000 fine
if convicted. The peeking while loi
tering charge is considered less se
rious than stalking.
"He came to my house in Au
gust for the first time," Sanders
said. "I met him then, and I guess
I talked to him a little bit too
long."
