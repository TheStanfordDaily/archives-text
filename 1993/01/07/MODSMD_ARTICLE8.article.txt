# Overzealous fan of swimmer arrested

After conquering the interna
tional swimming world with her
four-medal performance at the
1992 Summer 01>mpics, junior
Summer Sanders now faces a
more difficult task â€” a sometimes
too-adoring public.
Mason Crist, 37, of Wat
sonville, was arrested Dec. 31 on
charges of peeking while loitering
outside Sanders' Roseville home
after making repeated unan
nounced visits. He pleaded not
guilty at his arraignment Monday.
"It's really sad that it had to
come to this," said Sanders, who
enrolled again at Stanford this
quarter after stopping out to
train. "[Crist] never came and at

tacked me or anything, but the
whole thinggot to be a little ridicu
lous."
Crist, who wrote to Sanders
shortly after the former Cardinal
star returned home from the
Olympics, has allegedly made nu
merous attempts to contact her
both at home and at Stanford over
the past five months.
Crist faces a maximum of six
months in prison and a $1,000 fine
if convicted. The peeking while loi
tering charge is considered less se
rious than stalking.
"He came to my house in Au
gust for the first time," Sanders
said. "I met him then, and I guess
I talked to him a little bit too
long."
In November, Crist was ques
tioned by campus police after
allegedly attempting to acquire
Sanders' unlisted off-campus
phone number through the regis
trar's office. No charges were
filed.
"He went to all of these differ
ent places around school trying to
get my number," Sanders said.
"But people here are really good
about not giving out information
like that."
Sanders said that while she
never felt physically threatened
by Crist, he continued to appear
at the Sanders' family home even
after her father warned him not
to return.
On New Year's Eve, the Wat
sonville man was arrested when
Sanders' father, Robert, contact
ed local police after Crist rang the
doorbell. He is being held on
$5,000 bail in Placer County Jail.

A restraining order was also
issued against Crist at the
request of the Sanders family.
"When things like this happen,
you feel a little scared," Sanders
said. "Although I don't know
[Crist], it's scary to know that
people out there exist who will do
things like he was doing."
Crist had been arrested on a
trespassing charge involving a dif
ferent woman several years ago,
according to the Placer County
Sheriffs Department. In addi
tion, a search of his apartment
turned up letters he wrote to
celebrities such as Priscilla Pres
ley and Elizabeth Taylor.
Sanders, who said the current
incident marks the first time that
she has been forced to deal with
an overzealous fan, acknowledged
that her new-found celebrity sta
tus will make her more wary of
future problems with the public.
"It's going to be hard for me,
because I'm naturally real trust
ing," she said. "I'm definitely
going to have to start being more
careful, though."
