# Academic focus for disabled
## Students want classes that go beyond physical 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Editor's note: this is the second in
a three-part series on disabilities.

This quarter, visiting Asst.
Prof. Paul Longmore will teach a
class on the history of people
with disabilities, the only course
of its kind at Stanford — and as
far as he knows, in the nation.
Although disability issues have
an impact on almost every field of
study and represent the common
experience of a minority group, it
is an area of academic study that is
rarely addressed, said Longmore,
who is disabled himself.
Longmore's history seminar,
"The History of Human Differ
ences: The Disability Minorities
in America" — which he is teach
ing for the third year — is just
one example of how disabled peo
ples' experiences can be dis
cussed in an academic context.
Although there are classes at
other universities that address
specific disabilities, such as the
deaf community's use of sign
language, Longmore said, to his
knowledge, his is the only class
that looks at all people with dis
abilities as a cohesive cultural
community.
Longmore's approach to the
study of disability goes beyond
trying to convey the physical dif
ficulties — as such classes as
Psychology 185, "Experienced
based Study on the Meaning of
Being Handicapped," do — and

explores social issues.
Disabled student Mark
Breimhorst says classes in which
students sit in wheelchairs or
blindfold themselves for a day to
try to understand the disability
experience don't go far enough.
"Some of them focus on social
aspects of disability and some on
the physical," said Breimhorst.
"You're going to get a warped
sense of reality if you [onlyl do
the physical because those of us
who aren't in a wheelchair aren't
going to deal very well with it for
only a day.
1 am very
uncomfortable with
non-disabled people
telling me how my
psychology works. 1
— Mark Breimhorst
"It's devaluing the experience
to say that you can understand
my life in a day, or in a few hours
by doing something like this," he
said. "... disabled people have to
do it day in and day out."
Longmore and Breimhorst
would rather see disabled issues
discussed in a more general aca
demic context. For example, when
students study "Paradise Lost,"
few actually analyze how Milton's
experience as a blind person affect
ed his art. And the impact of
health care policies on the disabled
is rarely given much attention.
Longmore pointed out, "it's not
that there's no disability in aca
demics, it's there a lot already" if
scholars are willing to address the
issue.
As the disabled community
grows — in the last 10 years, the
number of disabled students at
Stanford has steadily risen from
"a handful" to more than 150 self
identified students — its mem
bers speculate that the growing
numbers will develop a voice.
Increasingly, many disabled
students and faculty are begin
ning to view themselves as a
minority group whose experience
and culture should be acknowl

edged and legitimized through
academic study.
Faculty perspectives
Longmore said as part of his
goal in raising awareness about
disability issues, he hopes he can
"encourage at Stanford before I
leave .. . I the recruitment of] fac
ulty with disabilities in whatever
discipline, and to think of it as
another dimension of diversity."
He and other members of the
disabled community say that fac
ulty members with a first-hand
perspective are essential to study
ing disability.
Breimhorst, a coterminal stu
dent in the School of Education,
said the problem with some class
es at Stanford that do address dis
ability is that they are taught by
non-disabled professors using
material about disability often
written by non-disabled scholars.
Breimhorst said that while he
is encouraged by the discussion of
disability issues in some classes,
to his understanding, the courses
have not yet addressed the "prob
lematic dynamic" of not having a
first-hand perspective.
A class about black people in
America "with a white professor
teaching literature written by
white people" would probably be
met with much more protest, he
pointed out.
Breimhorst said it is very
important to him that the profes
sors who teach specifically about
disabled issues are disabled them
selves.
"I am very uncomfortable with
non-disabled people telling me
how my psychology works," he
said. "I have for too long had non
disabled people tell me who I am
or what I should be. I just don't
want that."
Recent graduate Adriana Duffy,
who is disabled, made a distinction
between professors who mention
disability as an additional perspec
tive and those who teach courses
that focus on it.
While she said she would not
"demand that a professor who is
going to touch on the subject be
disabled," as long as he or she
qualified their statements, Duffy
said she believes a professor who
teaches courses that focus on dis
ability should be disabled.
However, Assoc. Dean of
Humanities and Sciences A 1
Camarillo said he believes that for
all minority issues, "anyone that
has the expertise" should be able

to teach a class in that area.
He recognized that being a mem
ber of a minority group does allow a
faculty member to offer a unique
dimension. "I know that my per
spective on disability could not be
as rich or complex as Paul Long
more could offer," Camarillo said.
"But to suggest a minority can
only teach a minority class is
inappropriate," he said.
Student pioneers
Much of the responsibility for
raising awareness of disability as
an academic issue has rested with
disabled students who are inter
ested in exploring their own expe
rience and perspective.
Breimhorst said he often
brings up the disability perspec
tive in class discussions, and
hopes that doing so will encour
age the professors to incorporate
the issues into future discussions.
Because he was interested in
analyzing how his own experience
was relevant to material he was
studying as a comparative litera
ture major, he based his senior
honors thesis on the theories of
marginality in terms of disability.
In his thesis, Breimhorst
addressed Shakespearean plays
from a disabled perspective. For
example, he discussed how the
"civilization" of Caliban, who is
described as a "deformed lump"
in"The Tempest," parallels the
ways in which disabled people are
taught to assimilate.
Longmore was one of Breim
horst's two advisors for writing
the thesis. Breimhorst said Long
more served as a role model —
'But to suggest a
minority can only
teach a minority
class is
inappropriate.'
— Al Camarillo
someone who had undergone the
experience of being disabled and
was willing to "academicize" it.
Longmore said he believes that
ultimately, the power to incorpo
rate disability into the curriculum
lies with disabled students like
Breimhorst.
For example, a self-designed
major in disability would definitely

be possible, with existing classes as a
basis along with independent study,
Longmore said. In fact, a student
recently approached him to discuss
the possibility of such a mtyor.
However, Longmore acknowl
edged that promoting a program
in disability studies would be
"grandiose at this point," but
could be explored as a long-term
goal.
Into the curriculum
Incorporating the disabled per
spective into the curriculum is a
matter of raising awareness
among faculty members and
channeling untapped resources,
Longmore explained.
Like many disabled people,
Longmore said he has "had a real
ly hard time getting a job because
of discrimination." To him, teach
ing at Stanford was a way to
"prove to other schools that I
could do the job."
But limited funds and the lack
of literature about disability have
prevented disabilities from
becoming more readily included
in academic study, he said.
However, Longmore pointed out
that there is a "growing interest on
the part of philanthropists and
foundations around the country" in
supporting disability studies.
Camarillo said that while dis
ability is important in broadening
academic perspectives, the lack of
specialists and literature is con
stricting.
However, Camarillo said he
anticipates an "emerging field of
study that will follow in the wake
of policy discussions stimulated
by the American with Disabilities
Act."
Camarillo drew a parallel to a
class he teaches in the History
department, "Poverty and Home
lessness." When he started teach
ing the class five years ago, there
was virtually no literature on the
subject, but now there are "at
least a dozen decent books."
Although the University "can
not tell the faculty what to teach,"
Camarillo said the "real key" to
bringing disability into the curricu
lum is emphasizing "information,
sensitivity and resources," and
making them available to faculty.
"A growing number of non-dis
abled people are for the first time
becoming aware that there are
major questions involved here
about what kind of society we
want, what kind of university we
want," Longmore said.
