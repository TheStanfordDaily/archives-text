So if you've always wanted to explore the Torah, yet did not feel you had the background to do it,
Torah Study is for you, and EXODUS is a terrific place to start. Each SHABBAT MORNING, from

to a variety of English translations, with ancient and modern commentaries, of the weekly few
chapters from the Torah. So roll out of bed and into the Hillel Library, and have brunch with us.
Food for the body, food for your head. And find out what the hubbub about the Torah is all about.
