# Vanquishing the obstacles
## Learning disability does not stop student from succeeding

Editor's note: This is the final article in a series on
disabilities at Stanford.

In third grade, senior Carolee Reiling took up run
ning as a way to try to escape the struggles of coping
with her learning disability.
"I was the person who was 'too cool' to set foot in
the school library. I was the person who could not
read," said Reiling, a Biology major. "Because I could
not read, I decided to run. Very few people came close
to catching me."
But over her four years at Stanford, she has real
ized that running could get her only so far.
"My endurance hit its limit," Reiling said, explain
ing that while her experiences at Stanford have been
a struggle for her self-confidence, she has known
what it is to work intensely to accomplish her goals.
Because Reiling's disability significantly affects
her reading, writing, spelling, memory and concen
tration, taking classes requires great deal of time, ef
fort and special accommodations such as tutors,
books on tape and untimed exams.
"I have to work so hard to accomplish what some
times seems like proportionally so little," Reiling
said. "It's made me think about things and I really
don't take things for granted as much."
Many students with disabilities like Reiling say
they feel a sense of isolation in Stanford's competitive
academic environment.
Learning-disabled students face numerous obsta
cles here, including having to counter repeated ques
tions about why they have been admitted and dealing
with professors who pity them.
But according to Molly Sandperl, an assistant dean
of students and director of the Disability Resource

Center, learning-disabled students have same poten
tial to succeed as their peers.
"Part of having a learning disability is that your
intellectual capabilities are vastly superior to your
performance," she said.
And Reiling pointed out that contrary to many
people's assumptions, learning disabilities are not
synonymous with stupidity.
"I'm the most creative person 1 know. I'm not
bragging, but I just think in an entirely different way
than most people do," Reiling explained. "People I
know have told me, 'Most people go from A to B to C
to D, but you go from A to D, back to C, skip B . . .' "
And because these thought processes are different,
students with learning disabilities often have difficul

ty with many classes at Stanford, which are often
based on the structured "A to B to C" type of thinking.
Coming to terms
Like the 40 other learning-disabled students who
use the Disability Resource Center, Reiling faces
unique challenges and struggles at Stanford, a com
petitive environment which often emphasizes some
of the tasks that are most difficult for her.
According to Sandperl, many students aren't diag
nosed as learning disabled until they get to Stanford.
Learning-disabled students often develop strate
gies in high school such as pulling all-nighters or

learns differently than the average Stanford student, Reiling spends extra time and effort on reading material.
