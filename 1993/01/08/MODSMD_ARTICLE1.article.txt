# Vanquishing the obstacles
## Learning disability does not stop student from succeeding 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the final article in a series on
disabilities at Stanford.

In third grade, senior Carolee Reiling took up run
ning as a way to try to escape the struggles of coping
with her learning disability.
"I was the person who was 'too cool' to set foot in
the school library. I was the person who could not
read," said Reiling, a Biology major. "Because I could
not read, I decided to run. Very few people came close
to catching me."
But over her four years at Stanford, she has real
ized that running could get her only so far.
"My endurance hit its limit," Reiling said, explain
ing that while her experiences at Stanford have been
a struggle for her self-confidence, she has known
what it is to work intensely to accomplish her goals.
Because Reiling's disability significantly affects
her reading, writing, spelling, memory and concen
tration, taking classes requires great deal of time, ef
fort and special accommodations such as tutors,
books on tape and untimed exams.
"I have to work so hard to accomplish what some
times seems like proportionally so little," Reiling
said. "It's made me think about things and I really
don't take things for granted as much."
Many students with disabilities like Reiling say
they feel a sense of isolation in Stanford's competitive
academic environment.
Learning-disabled students face numerous obsta
cles here, including having to counter repeated ques
tions about why they have been admitted and dealing
with professors who pity them.
But according to Molly Sandperl, an assistant dean
of students and director of the Disability Resource

Center, learning-disabled students have same poten
tial to succeed as their peers.
"Part of having a learning disability is that your
intellectual capabilities are vastly superior to your
performance," she said.
And Reiling pointed out that contrary to many
people's assumptions, learning disabilities are not
synonymous with stupidity.
"I'm the most creative person 1 know. I'm not
bragging, but I just think in an entirely different way
than most people do," Reiling explained. "People I
know have told me, 'Most people go from A to B to C
to D, but you go from A to D, back to C, skip B . . .' "
And because these thought processes are different,
students with learning disabilities often have difficul

ty with many classes at Stanford, which are often
based on the structured "A to B to C" type of thinking.
Coming to terms
Like the 40 other learning-disabled students who
use the Disability Resource Center, Reiling faces
unique challenges and struggles at Stanford, a com
petitive environment which often emphasizes some
of the tasks that are most difficult for her.
According to Sandperl, many students aren't diag
nosed as learning disabled until they get to Stanford.
Learning-disabled students often develop strate
gies in high school such as pulling all-nighters or

working one-on-one with teachers
that allow them to succeed, she
said. But these strategies often fail
when these students encounter
the increased competition, large
amount of reading and fast pace of
Stanford classes.
"People come into the office
shell-shocked because they've
never had so many problems in
classes. 'What's wrong with me?'
they ask," Sandperl said, pointing
out that 10 percent of the general
population has some kind of
learning disability and that there
are probably a significant number
of learning-disabled students who
go through Stanford never being
diagnosed.
She said as the number of self
identified students and diagnoses
increases, there is more aware
ness among students to recognize
that they may have learning dis
abilities. "Now, some people come
in because they have been
referred by a friend who's been
diagnosed," Sandperl said.
However, many learning-dis
abled students are "very reluc
tant" to associate themselves with
the DRC and the disabled commu
nity in general, she said.
Reiling herself has addressed
the isolation of having a learning
disability — "Even if you tell peo
ple, it's intangible to them, they
can't understand why you have
these problems or think in a differ
ent way." She leads a learning-dis
abled student group, which seeks
to share common experiences and
"just hang out and talk."
Because learning disabilities
are invisible and not well under
stood by most non-learning-dis
abled people, these students are
often reluctant to come to terms
and identify with their disability
because of negative social stigma,
and choose to run from it, like
Reiling did.
Reiling said her freshman year,
she took 20 units and rowed crew to
prove that she "fit in at Stanford."
"I figured if I failed, at least
people would attribute it to the
fact that I was doing so much and
not that I had some incapabilities,"
she explained. Now, she takes
between eight and 10 units a quar
ter in order to have enough time to
study and "still have a life."
Reiling said the problem in
classes is that she understands
the material, but because of her
' reading and memory problems, it
ttakes her longer to grasp it and
fjonce she does, she often cannot
convey the knowledge in an exam
situation.
And while Reiling does have
* many problems with reading and
writing, her learning disability
does not affect her math and sci
ence skills.

Reiling said the first time in
her life she was told she was
smart was her freshman year at
Polytechnic High School — a
competitive math and science
magnet school in Pasadena. A
math teacher said he felt she had
potential in math "like he had
never seen" and offered to help
her develop her talent.
She graduated from high
school with national honors in
math and an award in physics.
Because math and science do
come easily to her, Reiling enjoys
those subjects and tries to focus
on them and other areas that are
not affected by her learning dis
ability, such as a favorite of hers,
"people skills."
Admissions and myths
However, beyond her personal
struggles, Reiling still encounters
difficulties from the lack of under
standing of her disability. She
said students who have heard her
read — she reads slowly and out
loud to herself — have asked her,
"How the hell did you get into

Stanford?" or told her she didn't
belong here.
These reactions are an example
of the misperception that learning
disabled students are dealt special
favors by the admissions office.
Jon Reider, associate director
of undergraduate admissions, said
in all circumstances, the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions will
not admit a student to Stanford
"who does not have a likelihood of
succeeding at Stanford."
"Identifying as a learning-dis
abled student is not a back door
into Stanford," Reider said.
"There are no special spots for stu
dents with learning disabilities."
But the Admissions Office does
try to gain a "full understanding of
how personal circumstances affect
a student's academic record and
standardized test scores," he said..
It is not uncommon for learn
ing-disabled students to have dis
crepancies in their test scores that
reflect the specific areas which they
have problems with, said Nora
Cain, the DRC's program coordina
tor for students with learning dis

abilities.
However, the consideration for
personal circumstances is not spe
cific or limited to students with
learning disabilities, Reider said.
"For example, we give special con
sideration to students whose
native language is not English,
who live in rural areas or whose
parents did not go to college."
Professors and understanding
Because she needs certain
accommodations in classes, Reiling
said a mqjor part of her academic
life is working with professors to
explain and deal with her disability.
The accommodations that pro
fessors need to provide include
untimed tests and separate rooms
for taking exams. The DRC pro
vides services such as tutoring,
books on tape, transcribing, note
takers and study areas.
Reiling said for the most part,
professors at Stanford have been
understanding, and with the help
of the DRC, have provided reason
able accommodations.
Cain said she and the DRC
serve as a "secondary resource"
for professors who may not
understand a student's learning
disability or why he or she needs
certain accommodations.
Reiling said the problem she
faces is ignorance, not malice.
Her only negative experience
with a professor occurred during
her freshman year, when she
revealed the extent of her reading
disability to a professor who was
reluctant to provide special
accommodations.
"He said I was so stupid I
didn't deserve to go to Stanford
and I would never succeed in his
class, let alone in life," Reiling
said. As the quarter progressed
she said she proved to him that
she could understand the subject
material.
He "shut up and just let me
have my separate room and
untimed exam," she said. "And I
got an A in the class."
However, a more common
problem for her are professors
who feel sorry for her or have low
ered expectations because of her
learning disability.
"It kind of pisses me off when
they don't expect me to do well,"
she said. "I guess it could be nice
to have lower standards, but not if
I don't ask for them."
While Stanford's academics and
reading-intensive environment
often were obstacles to her self con
fidence, Reiling said when she
received five job offers, her abilities
were completely validated. She
plans to work in real estate.
Nevertheless, graduating in
four years from Stanford will be a
significant milestone and confi
dence booster for her, Reiling said.
"It's great because the harder you
work for something, the bigger it is
to you. I'm going to be the happiest
person at graduation."
