Serbs may have raped 20,000
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) â€” About
20,000 women may have been raped by
Serb fighters as part of a deliberate plan
to drive Muslims from their homes in
war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, according
to a report obtained yesterday.
The preliminary findings of a Euro
pean Community investigation said
there was strong evidence many women
and children were killed during or after
sexual abuse.
"The indications are that at least
some of the rapes are being committed in
particularly sadistic ways so as to inflict
maximum humiliation on the victims,"
said the confidential report.
It said "rape is part of a pattern of
abuse, usually perpetrated with the con
scious intention of demoralizing and ter
rorizing communities, driving them from
their home regions and demonstrating
the power of the invading forces."
The findings were based on interviews
with refugees and international aid orga
nizations in Croatia, the former
Yugoslav state that borders Bosnia, and

in Geneva. The investigating team, led
by Dame Anne Warburton of Britain, did
not travel to Bosnia but intends to do so
soon, possibly next week.
