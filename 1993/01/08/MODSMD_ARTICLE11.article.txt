# U.S. barrages Somali clan camps
## 
### 
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) - U.S.
forces sent a devastating message to this
lawless city yesterday, unleashing a bar
rage of tank, helicopter and rocket fire
on two clan camps, killing at least seven
snipers who were taking potshots at
troops.
The attack, the biggest and deadliest
of Operation Restore Hope, was meant
to instill fear among Somalia's feuding
clans and murderous thugs, who have
been growing bolder by the day.
Clans have skirmished in the capital,
and U.S.-led troops have increasingly
been targets of looters, rock-throwing
youths and snipers.
The violence also has intensified safety
worries by relief agencies trying to pro
vide food and medicine to Somalia's starv
ing. The American-led international force
came to the famine-stricken Horn of
Africa nation to protect such shipments.
Mogadishu shook with thunderous
cannon booms, screaming missiles and
ripples of machine-gun fire during the
20-minute onslaught.
At least seven So malis were killed in
the raid, directed at two arsenals in
northwest Mogadishu controlled by

fighters loyal to Gen. Mohamed Farrah
Aidid, one of Somalia's two most power
ful warlords. Military officials said the
Somalis inside the compound appeared to
be leaderless and undisciplined.
One Marine was wounded by friendly
fire in what officials said was a case of
mistaken identity. The injury was not
life-threatening, and he was being treat
ed aboard the helicopter carrier USS
Tripoli.
"We hit them with a firestorm," said
Maj. Gen. Charles E. Wilhelm, comman
der of the Ist Marine Division and the
officer who ordered the assault.
"A strong display of resolve, determi
nation and force is the best way to pre
vent the next one from happening," Wil
helm told reporters.
Wilhelm said he had no information
on Somali casualties, but officers at the
scene said there were at least seven
deaths. He said the assault was ordered
after it was determined that sniper fire
was coming from two of Aidid's arse
nals.
More than a dozen people were taken
prisoner from the two walled com
pounds, and the Marines seized

weapons caches including tanks, anti
aircraft guns, mortars and more than 15
field artillery guns, Wilhelm said.
He said the attack would have no
effect, however, on the balance of clan
power in Somalia, which is armed to the
teeth after years of courtship by the
Cold War superpowers.
The raid was the biggest display of fire
power since President Bush dispatched
U.S. troops to Mogadishu on Dec. 9.
Somalia sank into a nightmare of
death after despotic President
Mohammed Siad Barre was toppled
from power in January 1991. Since then,
at least 350,000 have died from starva
tion, disease and warfare by rival clans.
Mogadishu was abuzz with talk. Some
cheered the fact that U.S. forces had
seized a significant number of weapons.
"It is the first time the Americans
really tried to stop the fighting," said
Mohamed Hassan Mohamoud, 45, a
hotel cook.
Wilhelm said two convoys of U.S.-led
forces had come under sniper fire
Wednesday night. In one instance, he
said, a gun-mounted truck from one of
Aidid's compounds fired on U.S. troops.
