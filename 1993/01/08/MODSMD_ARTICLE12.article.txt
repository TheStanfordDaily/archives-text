# As deadline looms, Iraq still objecting to demands for missile removal
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
Iraq's U.N. envoy refused yester
day to confirm whether Baghdad
would comply with a U.S.-led
demand to remove missiles from a
"no-fly" zone, saying only that the
Western-patrolled area is illegal.
The United States, Britain,
France and Russia have given Iraq
until 5:30 p.m. EST today to
remove surface-to-air missiles from
a zone in southern Iraq created in
August to protect rebel Shiite Mus
lims.
The Pentagon said there were
indications missiles were being
moved yesterday, although it was
not immediately clear whether
they were taken above the 32nd
parallel as demanded.
U.N. Ambassador Nizar Ham
doon did not address the issue of
the missiles in a four-page response

he delivered to ambassadors of the
four nations.
"I hope the crisis has been
defused," Hamdoon said.
"My response was that Iraq does
not recognize the no-fly zone. It
was not imposed by the United
Nations but was imposed by the
three Western powers," he said.
Baghdad has repeatedly contended
the zone violates Iraqi sovereignty.
Hamdoon said he did not
"address the question of the mis
siles per se" in the response, writ
ten in Arabic. He declined to
answer reporters' questions on
whether Iraq was removing the
missiles from the zone, which cov
ers about a third of Iraq.
The British and U.S. ambas
sadors said they would send Iraq's
response to their capitals for
review.

Hamdoon also said Baghdad
invited a delegation of U.S. law
makers to Iraq to discuss the no-fly
zone and other issues. He did not
mention which lawmakers would
be invited.
"Iraq has a sovereign right to do
whatever it wants to with its mili
tary," Hamdoon said.
Earlier yesterday, Iraq's deputy
prime minister, Tariq A ziz,
denounced the ultimatum. But he
avoided a direct rejection of the
demand.
"It is the right of Iraq to deploy
air defenses throughout the coun
try," Aziz was quoted as saying by
the Iraqi News Agency. "Iraqi
pilots are not prohibited from fly
ing in the skies of their country for
training and patrol purposes."
Referring to the no-fly zone,
Aziz reiterated that "Iraq does not

recognize the ban."
Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein
met with top leaders of Iraq's gov
ernment yesterday. The state Iraqi
News Agency reported Saddam's
meeting with the Revolutionary
Command Council and officials of
the ruling Baath Party without giv
ing any details. The report did not
mention the ultimatum.
The session was reported sever
al hours after senior Pentagon offi
cials said Iraq had moved anti-air
crafl missile batteries in southern
Iraq.
If the Iraqis removed the mis
siles, it would be in line with what
is considered the "cheat and
retreat" tactics Saddam has used
repeatedly to test the allies' will
since the Gulf War ended nearly
two years ago.
The uncertainty of Iraq's

response heightened tension in the
Persian Gulf region over the possi
bility that the allies might take
military action against Iraq for the
first time since the war. Kuwait
ordered its fighter pilots to stay
close to their planes in case the
confrontation escalated into fight
ing.
The ultimatum, delivered to
Iraq's U.N. ambassador Wednes
day, ordered Iraq to remove its mis
sile batteries from below and
around the 32nd parallel, the
northern limit of the air exclusion
zone.
The current confrontation
began Dec. 27, when Iraqi MiG-25s
began intruding into the no-fly
zone.
One was shot down that day by
a U.S. F-16, but the incursions
have continued, possibly in an

attempt to lure allied warp lanes
into range of the missiles.
The allied ultimatum came after
Iraq moved mobile Soviet-made Sa
2 and Sa-3 surface-to-air missiles
into the zone over the last few days.
Aziz denounced "the clamor
made by American circles over the
deployment of defensive air
weapons in the south of the coun
try."
He denied that Iraq was using
the approaching Jan. 20 inaugura
tion of President-elect Clinton as
an opportunity to test allied
resol e
The chief U.N. spokesman, Joe
Sills, stressed that the Western
allies issued the ultimatum on
their own and not as a U.N.
demand. "There is no specific man
date in a (U.N.) resolution concern
ing the no-fly zone," he said.
