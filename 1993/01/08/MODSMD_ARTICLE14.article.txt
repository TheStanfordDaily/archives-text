## Editorial 'Cardinal' must go 
### 
Bland name doesn't
excite or inspire fans
or University athletes

tC m HE CARDINAL: ' should
be someone who wears a
JL funny hat, knows lots of
Latin and attends religious cere
monies, not a middle linebacker.
In 1971, the University made
the decision to remove the offen
sive Indian mascot — a decision
which wisely reflected both the
atmosphere and politics of the
University.
Now, however, it's time for Stan
ford to own up to the fact that when
it chose its new name, it goofed.
The choice of the "Cardinal" has
not only disappointed, it has con
fused. Only the most knowledge
able sports fans, or those most
familiar with the University, real
ize that Stanford's mascot is not
the handsome bird glorified by the
St. Louis baseball team and the
Phoenix football team.
The confusion mounts when
these folks see that our mascot is
not a fowl, but something looking,
at best, like an asparagus spear.
What they are looking at is the
"Tree," of course, which is the sec
ond personality that must be
changed in Stanford's schizo
phrenic mascot situation.
Stanford's odd marriage of a
tree and the color Cardinal places
us in the company of universities
such as Miami, which somehow
justifies putting someone in a duck
outfit to represent the "Hurri
canes" at their sporting events.
Surely no one was offended by
the choice of the Cardinal, and it
may have even pleased a few who
have a special affection for the par
ticular shade of off-maroon that
was chosen.
It would appear, though, that
the Cardinal is a rip-off of the
name of our east coast rival, the
Crimson tide. And while both
names bore even the most
enthusiastic fans, only Harvard

has an excuse for theirs: It's old.
Tradition is a fine excuse for the
Crimson, but we on the West Coast
are young, and our name is even
younger. There would be no shock
in a name change at this juncture.
The Cardinal would simply
become another George Lazenby,
an adequate but uninspiring tem
porary between two greats.
Stanford's current nickname is
non-offensive to the point of impo
tence. A new name should be bold,
inspiring and not afraid to poke
fun at the college athletic scene it
is part of, much the same way the
Stanford Band and Dollies do.
Now that both our big "money"
sports, are poised to be perched
among the best and most visible
teams in the country, the Depart
ment of Athletics should elicit sug
gestions for a new, unitary nick
name and mascot.
For too long, students have felt
separated from the impressive, but
distant, sports program. By taking
student suggestions (and possibly
allowing the students to vote on a
new name), the Athletics Depart
ment would make the student pop
ulation feel more in touch with the
sports teams.
The following list of 12 sugges
tions for team names, are meant to
reflect the type of change which
would both reflect and invigorate
the Stanford community. They
should be taken in the spirit in
which they were given — a repre
sentation of the wit, irreverence
and vim that has characterized our
campus.
