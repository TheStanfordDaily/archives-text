Sec. Gen. of UN, others deemed unfit graduation speakers

I DISAGREE STRONGLY with the
criteria elaborated by The Daily edi
torial staff in their Jan. 6 editorial
for the selection of a commencement
speaker.
The most important consideration is
that the speaker be "famous"?! This is
reminiscent of those notorious "most
influential women" lists, for example,
which are largely populated by individu
als in some way "familiar" (often
through association with their husbands
or the like) to the lowest common
denominator of society.
I can see this as a basis for selection
of a speaker at, say, Chico State, where
the most-read periodical might be People
Magazine.

Or could it be the folks at the Stan
ford Review have had it right all along,
and such shallow sentiments might be
the result of a toxic dose of excessive
multiculturalism.
I still however find it difficult to
explain the recent objections to the
choice of John Gardiner, founder of
Common Cause, prominent Secretary of
HEW (under a Democratic Administra
tion, no less), and so much else. Perhaps
it was because he hadn't been on televi
sion too much lately.
In the case of my own undergraduate
commencement from Stanford, the
selection committee managed to land a
real "famous guy" in Archibald Cox, the
one-time Watergate Special Prosecutor.

Everybody knew his name all right,
but apparently no one attempted to dis
cern whether he had much to say that
was inspiring, informative or unique, or
whether he was even a half-way decent
public speaker (a big "no" on all counts,
at least as measured by that particular
performance).
Which brings me to a lesser but not
insignificant point. While I would agree
that graduation day probably holds the
greatest significance for undergraduates,
all things considered, a large proportion
of those receiving degrees will be gradu
ate students.
In perusing the tentative list of
speakers identified by The Daily (which,
by chance, appears to contain at least

some meritorious selections), I note sev
eral "personalities" that may well be
more familiar to, and might even have
exerted more influence on us "older
folks," as a group. I'm thinking for
example of Ken Kesey, Hunter S.
Thompson, Johnny Carson and Jann
Wenner.
These are all interesting and
"famous" people, (as are Matt Groening,
David Letterman, Madonna and others),
and I for one would like to have each
and every one of them over to dinner.
But as graduation speakers? Forget it.
