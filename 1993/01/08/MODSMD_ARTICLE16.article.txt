# 'Vagina,' references to tuna fish offensive to women's movement
## 
### 
Thank you, Pete Huyck, for your
"feminist" poetry in the Dec. 4 Daily. It
has helped the women's movement on
campus considerably.
For those of us who were beginning
to wonder whether we were hyper-sen
sitive to chauvinist slights, you offered
reassurance that misogyny is alive and
well on this campus. You joined the
ranks of Clarence Thomas and Arlen
Specter to demonstrate that despite
education, intelligence and achieve
ment, some men just don't get it.
Many readers have dismissed your
sophomoric poetry because it was dis
tasteful and pointless. But your poems
did have a malicious point: hate
women's bodies.
In "Vagina," you wish for a vagina in
which to hold your keys and money.
Rapists also envision women's vaginas

as disembodied receptacles.
Then you say that women's vaginas
smell like tuna fish. This kind of dis
gust makes both men and women
ashamed of women's sexuality. Finally,
you describe the "monthly attack" of
menstruation as if it were a debilitating
disease. It's a natural process, not a lia
bility.
There is certainly room in the
women's movement for humor, as
demonstrated by the Stanford Women's
Theater Collective's recent production
of "Total Exposure" (We assume you
missed it.) However, your poetry was
malicious mockery.
You could check the offensiveness of
your words by placing them in a anoth
er context, such as race. Would you
have gotten away with a poem called
"Afro," wishing to stick your keys and
pencils in your hair? Would you make
up a complaint about the stink of black
skin and the problem of kinky hair?
Probably not.
Your poetry and underlying miscon
ception of women and feminism high
light the need for a publication such as

G-Spot. Let's hope the new magazine
can engender greater understanding
between men and women.
