# Blockbuster officials give Band the shaft during Florida trip
## 
### 
I and my wife, Mary Pat, had the
pleasure of following the Stanford foot
ball team to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., this
year. We are proud of the fine play of
our team and enjoyed meeting many of
the football boosters with whom we
travelled.

Our doughty band and the huge Penn
State band lent enthusiasm to the occa
sion even under the curious handicaps
handed to them by the Blockbuster
management: They were seated at the
ends of the half-filled stadium away
from their respective rooting sections,
and they weren't to play during the
interminable stadium broadcast com
mercials.
Our Stanford band was saddled with
another handicap: they were probably
hungry. It happened that Mary Pat and
I stayed at the same Holiday Inn as the
Stanford band. We were pleased by the
band's quiet behavior and appalled to
find that they were provided with no
expense money, no meals and that no
activities were planned for them. The
kindest word I can think of to apply to
their treatment is "shabby."
Thanks to all of the band for their
stirring New Year's Eve concert at pool
side. There weren't many present to
hear the concert, but those of us who
were loved it all.
