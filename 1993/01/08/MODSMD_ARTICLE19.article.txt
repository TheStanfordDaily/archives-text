## Poetic talent redux 
### 
AT THE END OF last quarter, I was
shocked and disappointed at the
negative reaction a large part of the
Stanford community had to my feminist
poetry. Not only did they misunderstand
my poems, but they misunderstood me.
Many felt that my poems were intend
ed to be "humorous" or that my sole
desire was to "get a laugh." Nothing could
have wounded me more deeply. I bare my
soul for the intellectual benefit of the
campus, and this is the thanks I get?
I am an artist, God damn it! Did Vincent
Van Gough cut off his ear for a cheap
laugh? Did Hemingway blow his brains out
with a shotgun to shock and titillate? I
think not.
My poetry is a labor of love and pas
sion, and people who flippantly dismiss it
as childish drivel are attacking not only
me but every artist who has ever chal
lenged the boundaries of accepted
thought. How would Beethoven have
reacted if, when he unveiled his Ninth
Symphony, everyone had laughed and
said, "Oh, what a silly little ditty!"?
While my reputation has been dragged
through the mud, I believe it is not
beyond salvation. It is for this reason that
I have decided to run two more poems.
The first poem, "A Velvet Blue," was
written while my sister was in the hospi
tal, and I think it is one of the best poems
of the twentieth century.
The second poem, "Monkey," is a pithy

glimpse at the joy and agony of unrequit
ed love, and heralds the coming of a new
age in modern poetry. With these two
artistic chef d'ouevres, I present both the
raw emotion and the deep understanding
of pentameter and rhyme that is so criti
cal to a poet's success.
These two poems, more than anything
else I have written, demonstrate both my
mental stability and my commitment to
artistic integrity. Of my numerous poems,
these are the most convincing, simply
because they subtly combine my love of
life with my respect for mortality, the two
fibers that run through this tapestry we
call life.
I hope you, the Stanford community,
will take this opportunity to look on these
poems with an unbiased eye and to reeval
uate me, both as an artist and as a person.
A Velvet Blue
Birdy, Birdy Bird
So pretty in the sky
Birdy, Birdy Bird
So sad you have to die
They want you for your feathers
To place atop their hats
They'll use your poked-out eyes
To put curses on black cats
But I just want to watch you
Flying easy, high above

Come, eat these tasty morsels
From my hand, inside this glove
And when you touch down lightly
And look me proudly in the eye
I'll dash your brains out on a rock
And rub them on my thigh
Monkey
Monkey jumps from tree to tree
Swings on vines so carelessly
He's funny, happy, crazy too.
Oh, silly monkey - I love you!
I wish that I could play in trees
And eat and sleep whenever I please
But since I can't and never will
I bought a gun that chimp to kill.
I shoot him down in cold, cold blood
His impish smile changed to surprise
I finish him off, smothered with mud
And rub his brains all over my thighs.
