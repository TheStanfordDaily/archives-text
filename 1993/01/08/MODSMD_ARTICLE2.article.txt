# Faculty Senate ratifies new honors program
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday unan
imously approved a new undergradu
ate honors program in Environmental
Science, Technology and Policy, to
begin this academic year.
Students from any major with a
strong background in environmental
studies will be eligible to participate in
the interdisciplinary program, which
consists of a year-long series of re
search seminars, followed by the prepa
ration of an honors thesis.

"This is giving more than lip service
to the idea of the undergraduate re
search experience. We've got something
really important here," said Walter Fal
con, director of the Institute for Inter
national Studies, which proposed and
plans to administer the new program.
The institute is an umbrella group
formed in 1989 to help coordinate
Stanford's often divergent research
and teaching efforts. It seeks to team
up scientists, economists and political
scientists to tackle world problems,
such as the environment, that cross
disciplinary boundaries.

Over the last few years, there has
been a "tremendous increase" in inter
est among both students and faculty in
environmental issues, said Assoc. Civil
Engineering Prof. David Freyberg,
who chairs the Committee on Under
graduate Studies.
"This is a rigorous, well-structured
program," he said, adding that it pro
vides breadth as well as depth in the
field. The seminars will be led by facul
ty members in the Schools of Engineer
ing, Earth Sciences, and Humanities
and Sciences.
While none of the senators ques

tioned the value of the new program, a
few said they worried whether it sig
naled an unwarranted role for the in
stitute in managing programs in Stan
ford's regular schools.
Sensing the direction of the discus
sion, Falcon said angrily that "it
seems to have become a bit of a turf
issue." He added that he "would have
thought the group would have been
delighted" that the institute is willing
to take on the burden of managing the
new program.
