## Stanford falls to Oregon State 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Where art thou, Adam Keefe?
Oregon State employed the same
strategy on Stanford that the Cardinal
used a year ago, pounding the ball into
their big center when all else failed.
Senior All America candidate Scott
Haskin muscled and grooved his way
to 23 points inside, and in the end
wore down the Stanford front line as
Oregon State defeated Stanford 77-66
at Maples Pavilion last night.
After playing Oregon State tough
for most of the game, Stanford's poor
outside shooting eventually proved too
much to overcome. As a team, Stan
ford shot a poor 35 percent from the
field. Guard Peter Dukes again strug
gled offensively, taking only eight
shots and sinking one.
"I'm struggling right now," Dukes
said. "I've started to take bad shots
and that doesn't help the team."
Despite an inability to make a high
percentage of shots, Stanford man
aged to compete respectably with the
Beavers, having a chance to win until
the waning minutes. Haskin was the
lone offensive force for the Beavers in
the first half, and Montgomery

employed a three guard lineup featur
ing Marcus Lollie, Dion Cross and
Bobby Patton that created some effec
tive matchups. Stanford went into
halftime trailing by a mere four
points.
"There was some encouragement
there for us," coach Mike Montgomery
said. "To hang on as long as we did is
credit to how hard we played."
Montgomery used a rotation of Jim
Morgan, Darren Allaway and Bart
Lammersen in the post in hopes of
wearing the 6-foot-11 Haskin down.
Haskin went to the foul line for 12 free
throws after receiving a flurry of
inside passes from the Oregon State
guards. But while Allaway was
impressive in pulling down 12
rebounds, eight rebounds on the
defensive end, Stanford's concentra
tion on Haskin allowed forwards Chad
Scott and Mustapha Hoff to free
themselves to score 18 and 11 points,
respectively.
"Haskin is a load, there's no ques
tion about it," Montgomery said.
Stanford managed to tie the score
at 32 at the 18:25 mark before the
Cardinal outside shooters began their
dry spell. Oregon State slowly
increased their lead to seven with

12:50 to play. Stanford then toyed
with the possibility of victory via Mar
cus Lollie, who hit a three-pointer and
then made two free-throws after a
Chad Scott foul to bring Stanford
within two at 45-43.
Scott, though, came right back to
hit a three of his own to stifle the
Stanford comeback, and the Beavers
proceeded to extend their lead to dou
ble digits, where it stayed until the
finish.
Oregon State's defensive pressure
played a large part in Stanford's
shooting woes, as the Beavers
amassed eight blocked shots, includ
ing three by guard Brent Barry.
Guard Dion Cross provided spark in
reserve, scoring 10 points and adding
quickness to a sluggish offense.
