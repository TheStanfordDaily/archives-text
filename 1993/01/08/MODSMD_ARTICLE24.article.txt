# Freshmen show promise in disappointing Cardinal loss
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
While the Cardinal upperclassmen
couldn't muster enough points to
defeat Oregon State, the freshmen
proved they might be the silver lin
ing to an all-too-cloudy Stanford
future.
Freshmen Darren Allaway and Dion
Cross provided the missing spark to
Stanford's attack last night, playing
the kind of aggressive basketball usual
ly seen from players two or three years
their senior.
Cross's 10 points helped rally the
Cardinal from as many as 12 points
down, as he shot 3-for-6 on the night
and l-of-2 from three-point range. All
away started his third consecutive
game at the power forward position,
playing tough defense against the
Beavers' premier 6-foot-11 inside man
Scott Haskin while contributing eight

points of his own.
Here's another telling statistic.
Rebounds: Allaway — 12. Rest of the
team — 11.
"Believe it our not, there was some
encouragement there for us," head
coach Mike Montgomery said. "All
away did a nice job on the boards, and
both he and Cross were very encourag
ing tonight."
Cross said he felt some pressure to
step up the tempo coming into the
game off the bench.
"Shots weren't falling for us, so I
felt it was necessary for me to come in
and bring something to our game,"
Cross said. "Coach Montgomery is
always talking about contributing off
the bench, and that's what I wanted to
do."
Cross cut and slashed his way
through the second half to finish as the
third-leading scorer for the Cardinal on
the night, picking up some of the slack

left by guard Peter Dukes, who fin
ished a disappointing l-for-8 with
three points.
"I'm out of rhythm lately," Dukes
said following the game. "On one play,
my guy beat me to the spot where I was
supposed to go, so that's a pretty good
example of where I'm at."
As for Allaway, Oregon State head
coach Jim Anderson admitted that the
freshman was a source of concern for
him throughout the game.
"He's a strong body and he moves
you around," Anderson said. "He does
all those things you're supposed to do
in the low post well."
For Allaway, however, pride in his
own performance was overshadowed
by the play of the team in general.
"It makes no sense to be happy with
my play when we're not playing well as
a team," Allaway said. "I'm not satis
fied with my play unless it's helping us
win."
