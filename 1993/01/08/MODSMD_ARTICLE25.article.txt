# Stanford wrestling squad hosts Oregon State Beavers
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Having spent their winter "vacation"
at tournaments at Cal State-Fullerton,
Northwestern, Oregon State and UC-
Davis, the Stanford wrestling team will
finally open a week-long home stand,
beginning with top-10 opponent Oregon
State on Sunday.
Cardinal head coach Chris Horpel said

his wrestlers must do well against quality
competition such as the Beavers to prove
their abilities not only to others, but to
themselves as well.
Stanford will enter the contest with
some momentum. Redshirt freshman
Matt Cano and sophomore Sahlan Martin
competed in the Fullerton Open on Doc.
20, where Cano placed third at 126
pounds, and 158-pound Martin was only
one match shy of placing in the top eight.

Similarly, in Northwestern's Midlands
Open at the end of December, 118-pound
senior Phil Nowick placed seventh, despite
contending in a pool which included the
likes of perennial powerhouse lowa.
In the Oregon Classic, 142-pound
junior Lance Johnson finished third only
after a close 1-0 defeat at the hands of the
three-time Division II champion, while
150-pound redshirt freshman Tod Sur
mon captured fifth place.

And most recently at UC-Davis' Aggie
Open, Cardinal wrestlers placed from first
through fourth. Junior Jay Jackson won
the 134-pound division, while Surmon got
second at the 150-pound class due to an
ankle injury which forced him to forfeit
his championship match. Cano captured
third and senior Dave Nowick fourth at
126-pounds.
Injuries will pose a great difficulty for
Stanford this Sunday. Breaks, strains and

twists have decimated the Cardinal roster
from 142-pounds and above. Johnson,
suffering from a rib injury, may not wres
tle. Other problem spots on the team also
include Surmon, who's nursing his ankle,
190-pound freshman Roger Liu, who hurt
his back, and Martin, who was recently
assaulted by eight people at the Taco Bell
on El Camino.
The matches will begin at 7 p.m. Sun
day
