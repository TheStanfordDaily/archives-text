The 1992 national champion
Stanford men's gymnastic team
opens their season at San Jose
State today with their sights set
once again on the NCAA title.
"Last year was great for us —
I couldn't have asked for any
thing more," said head coach
Sadao Hamada. "I am very opti
mistic about repeating our cham
pionship again this year."
Last year, after placing first in
the Pacific 10 Conference, the
men's team went on to prove
themselves best in the country,
contributing to Stanford's
record-setting five national
championships in one year.
After placing sixth on the par
allel bars in the Barcelona
Olympics, senior Jair Lynch
returns to lead the Stanford
team. As the youngest gymnast
on the American team, "It was
good for him to go out and get
recognition; the 1996 Olympics is
his next major goal."
Seniors Jeff Bender and
Shawn Adamek are also key
returners, as well as juniors Mark
Booth and Jason Cohen and
sophomore Josh Stein. While
Hamada admitted two of last
year's top performers Steve
Hutchings and Tim Ryan "will be
hard to replace, the team picked
up a number of hopeful new
recruits."
Included in this list are former
Chinese national team member
JingWei Liang, sophomore Evan
Wells and freshmen Peter Hegi
and Andrew Manson. Hamada
describes this year's team as
"even better that last year's
because of added depth and high
er ability level."
Seemingly relaxed about this

first meet, Hamada described it
as "low key".
"My major concern is to get
the guys to a certain level —
starting slowly throughout the
early meets then working
towards a peak near the Moun
tain Pacific Championships,
regionals and finally the NCAA
Championships" said Hamada.
He plans to use this opportu
nity to see where the gymnasts
are at this point and what they
need to improve on in the next
four months.
"Everything for us is geared
towards the NCAA Champi
onships. We may lose some meets
along the way, but that's not a big
concern for me," he said.
Rather than worrying about
winning individual meets, Hama
da chooses to focus on the team's
performance as a whole. Unlike
other sports such as football or
basketball, in gymnastics, teams
earn their way to the champi
onship meets not on the merit of
their win/loss record, but based
on their top three dual meet
scores.
An added challenge arose this
year when the Federation of
International Gymnastics, the
governing body which makes the
rules for gymnastics competition,
changed the system in which
moves are judged. An extra level
was added which includes the
most challenging skills the gym
nasts perform.
In today's opening meet, the
Cardinal will face California,
lowa State and the University of
Mexico as well as other teams
from the western region. If the
season goes as well as Hamada
hopes, the men's team might very
well continue to call themselves
the best in the nation.
