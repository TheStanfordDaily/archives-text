# Cardinal downs Beavers with 13-point comeback
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Last night, the Stanford
women's basketball team proved
that the third time really is a
charm.
The Cardinal (9-2) overcame a
lethargic first-half performance
and a 13-point second-half deficit
to squash Oregon State 70-60,
earning its first win in three years
on the Beavers' home court. Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer
was not surprised that Oregon
State put up such a tough fight.
"There's just such an incredi
ble incentive for them to beat
Stanford, (since we arel ranked
and the defending national cham
pions," she explained.
Although Stanford managed to
pull out the 10-point victory, its
overall performance in the game
could only be described as less
than satisfactory. The Cardinal
committed 24 turnovers during
the game's first 20 minutes, fail
ing to establish any kind of offen
sive rhvthm.
Stanford's first-half defense
fared no better as Oregon State's
freshmen stars Anette Moller
strom and Tanja Kostic scored at
will. Mollerstrom piled up 18
points while Kostic accumulated
14 points of her own in the open
ing period of play. VanDerveer
was full of praise for the Swedish
forwards.
"They are very offensive-mind
ed and excellent shooters," she
said. "They handle the ball well,
and they are very highly skilled
international players."
Down 42-31 at the break, the
second-half did not start out any
better for the defending national
champions. The Cardinal failed to

gain any momentum and found
itself trailing by 13 points, more
than five minutes into the period.
Kate Paye provided the lone
shining spot for Stanford as her
offensive production kept the Car
dinal within reach of the Beavers.
While senior point guard Molly
Goodenbour watched from the
bench, the sophomore reserve
scored five of her seven points,
including a dazzling lay-up which
she converted into a three-point
Play-
Realizing that time was run
ning out on its chance for victory,
the Stanford squad began mount
ing a comeback with under 11
minutes remaining. A Val Whiting
three-point play and a Chris Mac-
Murdo bucket capped an 8-0 run
for Stanford and closed the deficit
to 54-51 at the eight-minute
mark. Several minutes later. Car
dinal sophomore Rachel Hemmer
scored her second basket of the
game, giving Stanford its first lead
of the contest at 57-56.
From that point on, Stanford
extinguished all hopes of an Ore
gon State upset. Goodenbour took
the game into her own hands as
the preseason All-American rat
tled off seven straight points to
preserve the Cardinal win
Despite a poor effort bv the
Cardinal, its victory against a
much improved Beaver squad still
stands as a noteworthy achieve
ment.
"They're an excellent team,"
VanDerveer said "I think they are
much better than last year.
They're much more skilled and
playing much better together."
Tomorrow night, the Cardinal
faces the University of Oregon, a
team that Stanford has beaten 10
straight times.
