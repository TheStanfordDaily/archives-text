# Shop 'til you drop
## Course 'shopping period' one headache after another for Registrar 
### Jake Dorman Staff writer 
It may be two weeks after Christmas, but
Stanford students are on a major shopping
spree: shopping for classes.
And as usual at the beginning of the quar
ter, curious students — at times sitting cross
legged on the floor — cram overcrowded class
rooms, leading to complaints from instructors
and major headaches for the people in the Reg
istrar's Office who laboriously schedule the
University's 200 classrooms.
"Stanford's traditional two-week shopping
period creates a situation where classes are
just bulging at the seams in the first weeks,"
said Acting Registrar Jack Farrell. "Most of
those problems would eventually fix them
selves through natural attrition."
But with several major classroom buildings
closed for repairs and seismic bracing projects
scheduled for the next eight years, the Regis
trar's Office is still feeling aftershocks of the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. "Right now,
because Building 60 is closed, we're in the
worst shape we've been in since the earth
quake," Farrell said.
The University has supplemented its stock
of classroom space with modulars in order to
replace classroom buildings under repair for
earthquake damage.
The Registrar's Office is responsible for
scheduling almost all of the University's class

room space, matching courses with classrooms
using a computer system and a host of criteria
such as the size of the class, equipment needs and
proximity to the department offering the course.
However, due to the tight class space, the
Registrar sometimes cannot fill all the
requests from professors for peak-course
times such as 10:00, 11:00 and 2:15.
"We have to turn people down," said class
scheduling coordinator Melissa Wilson. "They
have to re-decide course days and times."
In addition, the recent expansion of some
graduate departments to offset budget difficul
ties has created some unforeseen overcrowding.
"Autumn quarter, especially, was a night
mare in the Engineering Department," Wilson
said. "There were people that had rooms 15
seats short."
The Registrar's Office asks each depart
ment to estimate the size of a class based on
previous enrollment and the total number of
students in the department.
However, enrollment projection is an inex
act science. "You never know what the enroll
ment will be in a lecture course," said History
Department Academic Assistant Ani Shastri.
In the case of a conflict between two class
es, a professor's seniority can become a factor.
"Somewhere down the list of criteria we look
to see if one's a full professor and one's an
assistant," said Farrell.
More frequently, however, tenured profes
sors will get their choice of rooms because they

have taught a class in a given room for a number
of years, according to both Wilson and Farrell.
In addition to all the other complications,
the course schedule is in a constant state of
flux. "From the moment the time schedule is
printed it's changed," said Wilson.
The process of putting together the time
schedule and assigning classroom space starts
about six months before the first day of the
quarter.
Currently, in addition to re-assigning over
flowing classes to larger rooms and smoothing
out other kinks in the system, Wilson is working
on the Spring time schedule, which should reach
its final typeset stage by the end of January.
Despite all the hassles, the class scheduling
is much easier now than in the past. According
to Farrell, the Registrar's Office used to sched
ule classes using a low-tech card system, which
sometimes led to oversights and double book
ings. "Things have gotten a lot better since we
got the computerized system," he said.
