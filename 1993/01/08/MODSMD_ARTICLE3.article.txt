Many people only dream of giving up smoking.
But it only took one nightmare for Prof William
Dement.'s dream to come true.
"I really had cancer of the lungs. Not in real life,
hut in the dream. And it was very real," said De
ment, who kicked his smoking habit after the
dream. "I felt everything emotionally that I would
have felt if it had happened outside the dream and
that's why I was able to give up smoking."
People's experiences in dreams are as vivid as a
waking experience, according to Dement, who
began his career at the University of Chicago where
he helped discover Rapid Eye Movement. REM is
the rapidly shifting movement of the eyes under
closed lids associated with the dreaming phase of
the sleep cycle.

Now, Dr. Dement, founder of the Stanford Sleep
and Dream Research Lab and the Sleep Disorder
Clinic, teaches a sleep and dreams course at Stanford.
"A person builds up a sleep debt and the size of
the debt determines how much they can get away
with," said Dement.
"Everyday you cope harder until you reach a
threshold. Learn the amount of sleep you need and
take your personal sleep debt into account when you
plan your activities. Reduce you sleep debt whenev
er possible; avoid bankruptcy."
A sleep debt am be fatal. Recounts Dement: A
South Dakota man was driving behind a large truck
when he realized that he needed to stop for coffee.
Next thing he knew, he was already asleep — and he
slammed into a truck ahead of him.
