# Findings on sleep can get you through the night

Many people only dream of giving up smoking.
But it only took one nightmare for Prof William
Dement.'s dream to come true.
"I really had cancer of the lungs. Not in real life,
hut in the dream. And it was very real," said De
ment, who kicked his smoking habit after the
dream. "I felt everything emotionally that I would
have felt if it had happened outside the dream and
that's why I was able to give up smoking."
People's experiences in dreams are as vivid as a
waking experience, according to Dement, who
began his career at the University of Chicago where
he helped discover Rapid Eye Movement. REM is
the rapidly shifting movement of the eyes under
closed lids associated with the dreaming phase of
the sleep cycle.

Now, Dr. Dement, founder of the Stanford Sleep
and Dream Research Lab and the Sleep Disorder
Clinic, teaches a sleep and dreams course at Stanford.
"A person builds up a sleep debt and the size of
the debt determines how much they can get away
with," said Dement.
"Everyday you cope harder until you reach a
threshold. Learn the amount of sleep you need and
take your personal sleep debt into account when you
plan your activities. Reduce you sleep debt whenev
er possible; avoid bankruptcy."
A sleep debt am be fatal. Recounts Dement: A
South Dakota man was driving behind a large truck
when he realized that he needed to stop for coffee.
Next thing he knew, he was already asleep — and he
slammed into a truck ahead of him.

Psychiatry Prof. William Dement converses on the phone in his office yesterday.
The truck was carrying steel
girders. His wife, in the passenger
seat, was decapitated by one of
the girders.
Dement says that most people
need at least seven hours of sleep
per night. There are several peo
ple, however, who have claimed to
be able to get by with less sleep.
Salvador Dali claimed that he
slept sitting on a chair with a
plate on the floor and a spoon in
his hand positioned above the
plate. He said that he slept during
the times that it took the spoon to
hit the plate.
"He must have been lying,"
says Dement.
President-elect Bill Clinton is
reported to sleep only four hours
a night. Dement doesn't think
this could be true. If it is true,
Dement said that Clinton "proba
bly suffers from a delayed-sleep
phase syndrome, where his bio
logical clock runs late such that
he would collapse when his sleep
debt accumulates."
Margaret Thatcher is also
reported to sleep only four hours

by having trained herself to do so.
Dement doesn't think that it's pos
sible for a person to train them
selves to sleep less than required.
"That would be like learning to
cope with it; but, you cannot learn
to sleep less. You can curb your
appetite, but your body still needs
the nutrients," says Dement.
Attendance in Dement's class,
"Sleep and Dreams," offered once
a year through the Human Biolo
gy department, ranges from 350
to 900 students.
"Students learn about public
policy, the biological clock, a teen
sy bit about sex in sleep, stress in
sleep, nightmares, and sleep
across lifespans," said Dement
about his course.
He once persuaded his stu
dents to participate in an experi
ment to test the wish-fulfillment
hypothesis — the students would
not drink any fluids all day and it
was believed that when they slept
they would dream of drinking
something cool.
He had to take a blood sample
of each student to test for dehy
dration. "I had been rusty on my
blood sampling skill and think I
frightened the students. Every
single one of them dreamed of a
professor coming at them with a

needle," Dement said.
In his class, Dement collects
written accounts of students
dreams and reads out the most
interesting ones to the class.
"I 1 Dementi was Apollo. I was
radiantly handsome. All of the
women in the class were worship
ping me," says Dement. He paus
es. "I wasn't the person who had
this dream. You have to make
that clear. It was one of my stu
dents."
"Most of the students in the
class have a sleeping disorder,"
says Dement. Not because only
students with problems take his
course but because "most stu
dents experience some level of
sleep deprivation. We have
learned that sleep deprivation
causes sleep apnea."
Sleep apnea is one of the most
common sleep disorders. People
with sleep apnea have trouble
breathing during the night and
wake up as much as 100 or 200
times — often without being
aware of having woken up. Thus,
they are often tired from lack of a
good night's sleep.
"A river of sleep disorder is
flowing under the noses of prima
ry care physicians and they don't
see it," said Dement.

slept sitting on a chair with a
plate on the floor and a spoon in
his hand positioned above the
plate. He said that he slept during
the times that it took the spoon to
hit the plate.
"He must have been lying,"
says Dement.
President-elect Bill Clinton is
reported to sleep only four hours
a night. Dement doesn't think
this could be true. If it is true,
Dement said that Clinton "proba
bly suffers from a delayed-sleep
phase syndrome, where his bio
logical clock runs late such that
he would collapse when his sleep
debt accumulates."
Margaret Thatcher is also
reported to sleep only four hours

by having trained herself to do so.
Dement doesn't think that it's pos
sible for a person to train them
selves to sleep less than required.
"That would be like learning to
cope with it; but, you cannot learn
to sleep less. You can curb your
appetite, but your body still needs
the nutrients," says Dement.
Attendance in Dement's class,
"Sleep and Dreams," offered once
a year through the Human Biolo
gy department, ranges from 350
to 900 students.
"Students learn about public
policy, the biological clock, a teen
sy bit about sex in sleep, stress in
sleep, nightmares, and sleep
across lifespans," said Dement
about his course.
He once persuaded his stu
dents to participate in an experi
ment to test the wish-fulfillment
hypothesis — the students would
not drink any fluids all day and it
was believed that when they slept
they would dream of drinking
something cool.
He had to take a blood sample
of each student to test for dehy
dration. "I had been rusty on my
blood sampling skill and think I
frightened the students. Every
single one of them dreamed of a
professor coming at them with a

needle," Dement said.
In his class, Dement collects
written accounts of students
dreams and reads out the most
interesting ones to the class.
"I 1 Dementi was Apollo. I was
radiantly handsome. All of the
women in the class were worship
ping me," says Dement. He paus
es. "I wasn't the person who had
this dream. You have to make
that clear. It was one of my stu
dents."
"Most of the students in the
class have a sleeping disorder,"
says Dement. Not because only
students with problems take his
course but because "most stu
dents experience some level of
sleep deprivation. We have
learned that sleep deprivation
causes sleep apnea."
Sleep apnea is one of the most
common sleep disorders. People
with sleep apnea have trouble
breathing during the night and
wake up as much as 100 or 200
times — often without being
aware of having woken up. Thus,
they are often tired from lack of a
good night's sleep.
"A river of sleep disorder is
flowing under the noses of prima
ry care physicians and they don't
see it," said Dement.
