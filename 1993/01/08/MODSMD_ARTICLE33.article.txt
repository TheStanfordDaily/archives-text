# Clinic helps patients rest easy

A man dreams he had gone hunting. He shot a
deer, but the deer didn't die right away. So, he tried
to kill it by breaking its neck. He was woken up by
his wife's screams.
He had his hand around his wife's neck and was
trying to choke her.
Such wild and disturbing stories are a part of
everyday life at the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic.
Pat McKinley, one of the technicians at the clinic,
explains that people with normal sleep patterns act
out their dreams in their mind because their body is
paralyzed. People with sleep disorders, however, are
able to physically act out dreams.
McKinley and Terri Quinonez, both technicians
at the clinic located in Hoover Pavilion, stay up late
every night to diagnose and treat sleep disorders.
Inside the clinic's control room where they work,
six small, black-and-white television monitors peek
in on the sleeping patients in adjoining rooms.
Stacks of computer paper continuously spew out
of an electroencephalogram (EEG) machine. The
wave pattern at the bottom of the page shows the
patients' breathing patterns while sleeping. Used in
conjunction with the other EEG patterns, which
measure various metabolic rates, this is the key fac
tor in diagnosing disorders.
Quinonez goes to the adjoining room to prepare a

patient for a night's sleep at the clinic. She attaches
several long, thin wires to the back of his head, fore
head, chin and heart. These wires are connected to
the EEG machine.
The patient, James Puckett, who had a kidney
problem three years ago, has had problems sleep
ing for many years. Although doctors diagnosed
his sleep disorder as kidney-related, a recent kid
ney transplant proved them wrong: The sleep dis
order persisted, and he was referred to the Stan
ford clinic.
Puckett was diagnosed the previous night with a
mild case of sleep apnea. Tonight he will be sleeping
with a nose mask which is attached to a device that
prevents sleep apnea during sleep.
Several hours later, Puckett is asleep.
Back in the control room, McKinley points to the
television screen that shows the patient in Room 3,
Puckett. A few wave patterns suddenly go wild.
Nothing catastrophic — he's just turning to the
other side. She says that when a person is about to
sleepwalk, the wave patterns look chaotic and wan
der all over the page. The patients at the clinic, how
ever, are restrained and wouldn't be able to sleep
walk very far without being noticed.
"Good night," "Sweet dreams," are the instruc
tion to the patients at this clinic. They close their
eyes and give up a little privacy in hopes of restful
nights and energetic days.
