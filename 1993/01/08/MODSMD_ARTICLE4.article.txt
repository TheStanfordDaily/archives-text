# Dement-chaired national commission requests U.S. center for sleep research

### Jeff Brock Editorial staff 
As chair of the National Com
mission on Sleep Disorders Re
search, Prof. William Dement has
spent four years working on a re
port that he hopes will forever
change the way the American pub
lic views the importance of sleep.
After holding eight public
hearings around the country and
listening to testimony from hun
dreds of witnesses, Dement's
commission found that the Unit
ed States is seriously sleep-de
prived, that 40 million Ameri
cans are chronically ill with vari
ous sleep disorders and that the
country as a whole is unaware of
sleep disorders and the facts of
sleep deprivation.
Now the commission's report
— which in the words of Sen.
Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) "states
powerfully the extent to which
sleep disorders adversely affect
our country, and which articu
lates clearly solutions to this
devastating problem" — rests in
the hands of Congress, which
will decide whether to carry out
its recommendations.
The report makes six recom
mendations to "launch a long
range national plan":
• establish a national center
for research and education on
sleep and sleep disorders, which
would provide currently absent
leadership, fund research and
enact an educational campaign;
• strengthen ongoing pro
grams;
• create accountability in all
Federal agencies which pro
grams affect or are affected by is
sues of sleep and sleep disorders;
• increase support for train
ing and career development for
young investigators in the field;
• educate health profession

als, who regularly misdiagnose
sleep disorders; and
• educate the general public.
Implementing the recom
mendations, Dement said, "will
initiate a radical change in the
way society deals with sleep,
changing it from top to bottom,
from birth to death, from the
bedroom to the factory, from
medical school to the doctor's of
fice, and from the Persian Gulf
to Prince William Sound."
In December, Hatfield joined
three senators in urging Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass.), the
Labor and Human Resources
Chair, to include a provision au
thorizing the national center in
the National Institutes of Health
Reauthorization Bill.
Hatfield will also introduce a
separate bill that both establish
es a center at the NIH and au
thorizes the Secretaries of
Transportation, Education,
Commerce and Defense "to initi
ate appropriate public informa
tion and education programs."
He said he will also strive to
ensure adequate funding for the
center once it is established.
After a Wednesday press con
ference in Washington, D.C., De
ment visited five senators enlist
ing support — and assuring
them that passing a law does not
involve expenditure of money.
After the bills winds their way
through committees and sub
committees to the floor of the
two houses and then hopefully to
the president's desk, the center
"could be the law of the land —
depending on how fast things
move — by March, April or
May," Dement said.
"It's an issue of visibility and
credibility," Dement said. "Vali
dation is the word. Leadership is
