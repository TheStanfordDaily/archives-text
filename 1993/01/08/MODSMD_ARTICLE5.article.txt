# Dean Thomas to step down

### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas will end his five
year term as dean of Humanities and Science on Au
gust 31, President Gerhard Casper announced at last
night's Faculty Senate meeting.
"Using whatever method, Dean Thomas has de
cided that his pain threshold has been reached,"
Casper said in a reference to one of Thomas's earlier
publications titled "On Determining Pain Thresh
olds Using the Limiting Method."
The Senate's Committee on Committees will ap
point search committee members for a new dean
within the next two weeks, according to Provost Ger
ald Lieberman.
When Thomas was first appointed dean in June
1988, he was the associate dean of H&S, and even
then he was already looking forward to being a pro
fessor again.
In an interview after the meeting, Thomas said he
has always kept in mind that he would return to the
faculty after five years and that the idea of staying as
dean any longer "never came up."
Being a dean "is a different kind of work," he said.
"I haven't been able to keep up on my research and
teaching."
Thomas was not very enthusi
astic about the appointment
when he was first named. "I'll try
to live up to the expectations of
my colleagues," he said then.
"Without being too optimistic
about my chances, I'll give it my
best shot."
Five years later, faculty mem
bers are all praises, crediting
Thomas especially for his work in
maintaining a strong H&S faculty.
"The ovation the Senate gave
him was a good measure of the way
the faculty feels about him," said
Radiology Prof. William Northway,
the Faculty Senate chair.
Under Thomas, "recruitment
of minority faculty has been very
strenuously pursued," said
English Prof. Albert Gelpi, calling
the process "a great move on
[Thomas's] part."
Thomas said quality H&S facul
ty was one of his highest priorities,
adding that he felt his office was
successful in maintaining a "very
eminent, distinguished" faculty.
"We've done that through
great hires. We've also retained
most of the faculty who have been
tempted with outside offers,"
Thomas said.
Faculty also recognized Thomas

for his role in H&S finances, espe
cially in handling the budget
crunch and the money raised for
the school during the Centennial
Campaign.
Gelpi said that "while [Thomas
has] been heedful of the tight
budget,"he has remained "open
and responsive to new initiatives
and programs that have been
brought to him."
At the same time, Thomas said
he also learned how to raise
money. Casper called the dean's

fundraising skills
"outstanding."
This year,
Thomas will take
on the other side
of his fundraising
role — determin
ing how the
funds will be used
— as the money
H&S is slated to

receive from the Centennial Cam
paign comes in.
After he steps down, Thomas
will return to teaching statistics
in the Psychology Department.
He said he is pleased to be able to
devote his time to teaching and
research again.
But despite all the administrative
headaches that come with the posi
tion, Thomas said he has enjoyed
being a dean. "It's something I'd rec
ommend to any faculty member
who is asked," Thomas said.
