Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas will end his five
year term as dean of Humanities and Science on Au
gust 31, President Gerhard Casper announced at last
night's Faculty Senate meeting.
"Using whatever method, Dean Thomas has de
cided that his pain threshold has been reached,"
Casper said in a reference to one of Thomas's earlier
publications titled "On Determining Pain Thresh
olds Using the Limiting Method."
The Senate's Committee on Committees will ap
point search committee members for a new dean
within the next two weeks, according to Provost Ger
ald Lieberman.
When Thomas was first appointed dean in June
1988, he was the associate dean of H&S, and even
then he was already looking forward to being a pro
fessor again.
In an interview after the meeting, Thomas said he
has always kept in mind that he would return to the
faculty after five years and that the idea of staying as
dean any longer "never came up."
Being a dean "is a different kind of work," he said.
"I haven't been able to keep up on my research and
teaching."
