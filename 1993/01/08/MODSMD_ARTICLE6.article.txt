# Winter break-ins
## Thieves swipe bicycles, Macs 
### Cathy Siciliano 
When one Adelfa resident returned from winter
break, she was shocked to discover both her and her
roommate's Macintosh computers were stolen.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemey
er, the Adelfa was just one of 10 residence
burglaries that occurred over the holidays. Police
also reported 23 stolen bicycles and 10 car break-ins
during the two-week vacation.
"It seems to be a lot more than usual," said
Niemeyer. "A lot of thefts occur over the holidays
typically; it's a real concern."
The residence burglaries, for the most part, in
volved the theft of computer and stereo-related
equipment.
"We are absolutely heartbroken about this," said
Senior Facilities Supervisor Teresa Riseborough.
"We all feel bad when something like that happens
and we all feel insecure for you."
The break-ins, which are currently being investi
gated by the police, occurred in various locations on
campus, including Lagunita Court,
Lantana and Costano, Wilbur Hall,
Toyon Hall and Roble Hall.
"Detectives are going through
to see if there is a nexus to this,"
said Niemeyer.
Riseborough said the break-ins
at Adelfa and Ujamaa were the
first time rooms in Lagunita have
been burglarized.
According to Niemeyer, a room
in Ujamaa was broken into on
Dec. 28. The burglars kicked
down the lounge door and broke
the lock. One student room was
entered and items were wrapped
in linen and taken from room,
said Riseborough. The burglars,
however, left the items in the
lounge, she said.
The rise in burglaries over the
holidays has prompted questions
regarding residence security.

According to Riseborough, the
thefts could have taken place as stu
dents were exiting the dormitories.
"The person who has been
locking up Lagunita said that he
has had so many problems with
students who didn't want to
leave. He called me at home on
Saturday and I told him to kick
them out," she said.
"Students also need to take
responsibility for securing their
buildings," she said. "Stanford
Police drive around the dorms at
night, but on that particular day so
many people were leaving it would
be impossible to secure the areas."
Because the University assumes
no responsibility for the stolen
items, Niemeyer recommends that
students fjent a mini-storage unit
off campus and store valuable per
sonal items such as bicycles and
computers there.
Riseborough suggests that stu
dents who have computers lock
them to their desks, register them
and get insurance in case of theft.
