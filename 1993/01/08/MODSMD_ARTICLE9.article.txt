# Conference to focus on higher education
## 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
Students will have the oppor
tunity to discuss the relationship
between universities and their
surrounding communities during
the 10th annual You Can Make a
Difference Conference.
The day-long event, scheduled
for April, will explore the interac
tion between institutions of high
er education and the world out
side academia.
The purpose of the event is to
expose students to an important
topic in relation to public service
and to cultivate a general interest
in community involvement, said
Jason Snyder, the conference's co
director.
Community colleges, single
sex colleges and black colleges will
also be included in the discussion,
he said.
The conference often shows
students that "Stanford can be a
part of the real world and that
interaction with the real world
can be very valuable to our mis
sion here," said the conference's
other director, Eddie Garcia.
"There is only so much you can
read about [issues like] homeless
ness and poverty," added Eileen
Yeh, the speakers committee direc
tor for the conference.
Each year more than 30 stu
dent leaders and nearly 100 stu
dent volunteers contribute their
time to the year-long project, Sny
der said. This year's conference is
titled "The University in Transi
tion: Community Responsibilities

and Involvement."
According to Snyder, the 30
student organizers "tie [their]
academics to service." They take a
one-quarter course in directed
reading to research the confer
ence topic, he said.
For participants, the event
often serves as a springboard for
further involvement in the com
munity, he said.
In addition to prominent
keynote speakers, the conference
will offer panel discussions and
workshops emphasizing student
participation, Snyder said. Con
ference organizers have not yet
confirmed the speakers.
There will also be an "Opportu
nity Fair" where participants will
have the chance to become more
directly involved with the commu
nity outside Stanford, he added.
Organizers said the conference
coincides with other campus
events that make its topic espe
cially timely. The new Haas Cen
ter for Public Service will open
the day before the conference and
the meeting will take place during
National Volunteer Week.
The event is not only designed
to only promote volunteerism,
Garcia stressed. Rather, it seeks
to reshape the notion of public
service in students lives, he said.
"If there's a time to feel pas
sionately about something, it's
now and we have the resources
and the opportunity not only to
discuss and to analyze these
issues, but this is actually a chance
to do something and to being
about some change," he said.
