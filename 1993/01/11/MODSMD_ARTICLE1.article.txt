# No glory here
## Conference brings home the unreal realities of war 
### Jeff Brock Editorial staff 
Gary Lapid urged the students in a packed Medical
School classroom Saturday to close their eyes and
imagine that each of the three BBs he was about to drop
in a metal bin represented one megaton of dynamite.
These three BBs, he said, equalled the total fire
power expended in World War 11, including the atom
ic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The associate professor of clinical psychiatry then
released the tiny balls of metal, creating a clanking
sound that echoed through the speakers in the room.
Then he let nine BBs fall from his hand to represent
the power of the nuclear weapons on an old Poseidon
submarine, which could destroy almost 200 major
cities.
Next, to show the firepower of one Trident sub
marine — which can destroy all the major cities in the
northern hemisphere — he simultaneously dropped
24 BBs into the bucket.
Finally, to represent the combined nuclear arse
nals of the United States and the former USSR, he
poured the rest of his BBs into the bucket. And
poured. And poured.
For about 30 seconds, the sound of thousands of
BBs crashing into the bin filled the room.
He paused after the last of the BBs fell. "It gets to
me," Lapid said. "Comprehending the nuclear arse
nal may be an oxymoron."
Many other magnitudes discussed during the Ra
diology Department-sponsored conference — "Mod
ern Warfare; Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Ef
fects" — were almost beyond comprehension.
For example, when describing the physics of a nu
clear explosion, MIT weapons analyst Theodore
Postal noted that in less than a millionth of a second,
the temperature of a one-megaton bomb explosion
reaches more than 100 million degrees Fahrenheit.
The conference, which focused on the medical,
environmental and societal con
sequences of modern warfare,
covered a diverse range of topics
— from the illnesses caused by
radiation to how President
Bush's thyroid condition may
have affected his decision-making
prior to and during the Gulf War.
A few mtyor themes emerged
from the presentations, which
were aimed at medical students:
• Government predictions of
nuclear survival and optimistic
assumptions about what physi
cians will be able to do in a post
nuclear United States are false
and unrealistic, panelists said.
Due to the instant obliteration
caused near Ground Zero, the

devastating firestorm engulfing a
larger area, and the deadly
radioactive fallout drifting for
hundreds of miles, human deaths
and injuries would be massive and
the need for physicians very great.
Therefore physicians need to
take responsibility for' learning
about both the weapons of mass
destruction and effecting policy
change, panelists said.
• As the world moves beyond the
Cold War, global security may
become more precarious and
unpredictable. Accidental or terror
ist launchings have become more
likely despite the fact that treaties
such as START II may reduce the
number of nuclear weapons and
the risk of all-out war.
"Paradoxically, we may be cre
ating a more dangerous world,"
Lapid said. But, he added, the
nuclear age has brought with it
the "opportunity to change the

way we think about conflict, land]
what to do with aggression."
Nations must move quickly and
intelligently to contain nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons,
panelists said.
"The spread of nuclear tech
nology has been obscured by
superpower competition until
recently," Radiology Prof. Her
bert Abrams said, noting that
countries such as Iraq, North
Korea, Iran, Argentina, Brazil,
Libya and Algeria are eager to join
the club of nuclear nations.
What is problematic is that
uranium and plutonium can be
stolen, and a person wlio is "inno
vative, clever and pretty good
with his hands" might be able to
build a nuclear weapon with the
right materials, Abrams said.
He added that, as has been
demonstrated recently in Iraq,
inspecting a plant suspected of
producing nuclear material is dif
ficult, and the economic chaos in
the former Soviet Union could
lead scientists to sell those coun
tries' fissionable materials to the
highest bidder.
Biological weapons — living
organisms that kill or damage

humans, plants or animals — can
have a deadly force comparable to
nuclear weapons, according to Dr.
Meryl Ness, an emergency physi
cian from Boston. These weapons
can be lethal to organisms within
a range of several hundred-thou
sand square kilometers, and sub
stances such as anthrax can linger
in an area for 100 years.
Biotechnology has made possible
the creation of even more powerful
"designer" biological weapons. And
the current treaties on biological ani
chemical warfare as well as nuclear
non-proliferation are riddled with
loopholes, Ness said.
Mike Carter, a senior majoring
in Product Design and Political Sci
ence, said the realization that "war
against states ultimately reduces
itself to war upon people" prompt
ed him to attend the conference.
Sophomore Dave Cohen said
he learned a lot about how lead
ers' decision-making abilities can
be affected by their stress level as
well as their health, especially in
terms of choices made prior to,
during, or after a war.
