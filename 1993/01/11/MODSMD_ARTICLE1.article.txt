# No glory here
## Conference brings home the unreal realities of war

Gary Lapid urged the students in a packed Medical
School classroom Saturday to close their eyes and
imagine that each of the three BBs he was about to drop
in a metal bin represented one megaton of dynamite.
These three BBs, he said, equalled the total fire
power expended in World War 11, including the atom
ic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The associate professor of clinical psychiatry then
released the tiny balls of metal, creating a clanking
sound that echoed through the speakers in the room.
Then he let nine BBs fall from his hand to represent
the power of the nuclear weapons on an old Poseidon
submarine, which could destroy almost 200 major
cities.
Next, to show the firepower of one Trident sub
marine — which can destroy all the major cities in the
northern hemisphere — he simultaneously dropped
24 BBs into the bucket.
Finally, to represent the combined nuclear arse
nals of the United States and the former USSR, he
poured the rest of his BBs into the bucket. And
poured. And poured.
For about 30 seconds, the sound of thousands of
BBs crashing into the bin filled the room.
He paused after the last of the BBs fell. "It gets to
me," Lapid said. "Comprehending the nuclear arse
nal may be an oxymoron."
Many other magnitudes discussed during the Ra
diology Department-sponsored conference — "Mod
ern Warfare; Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Ef
fects" — were almost beyond comprehension.
For example, when describing the physics of a nu
clear explosion, MIT weapons analyst Theodore
Postal noted that in less than a millionth of a second,
the temperature of a one-megaton bomb explosion
reaches more than 100 million degrees Fahrenheit.
The conference, which focused on the medical,
