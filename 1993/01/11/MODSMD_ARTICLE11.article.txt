Serbs edge toward peace
GENEVA (AP) — Bosnian Serbs
appeared to back off formal demands
for a separate state within Bosnia-
Herzegovina, but international media
tors said the new proposal was too
vague to unblock peace talks — aimed
at ending the ethnic war in the former
Yugoslav republic — which resumed
yesterday.
In his proposal yesterday, Radovan
Karadzic, leader of the Serb minority

in Bosnia, did not include the demand
for a separate Serb state.
But Karadzic insisted upon his
arrival in Geneva that the republic's
Muslims, Serbs and Croats remain
"sovereign, constituent and equal."
Karadzic's insistence on a separate
Serb state within Bosnia had been the
main obstacle in the talks.
Ross resurfaces — again
DALLAS (AP) — Ross Perot makes
his comeback today, raising money and

seeking members for United We
Stand, America, his supporters' orga
nization that is to become a political
watchdog group.
The group will allow Perot to main
tain a political support base as Clinton
takes office.
The organization, with a paid staff
of 30 in Dallas, will monitor elected
officials' voting records and follow
issues, particularly government reform
and deficit reduction, which Perot
championed in his independent bid.
