# U.S. congressmen fired on in Somalia

### 
MOGADISHU (AP)—Gunfire crack
led across Mogadishu yesterday as U.S.
congressmen came under sniper fire
and Marines killed three Somalis in a
shootout.
It was some of the heaviest clan war
fare in the Somali capital since Marines
landed a month ago to secure food dis
tribution routes to the sick and starving
across Somalia.
But as the fighting raged, the war
ring factions reached agreement on a
cease-fire. The 14 factions, meeting in
the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa,
said the truce started at midnight (4
p.m. EST yesterday).

They also agreed to disarm their
militias by March 1.
It was unclear whether the cease-fire
was being observed or whether armed
bands could even have been informed of
the pact because of poor communica
tions.
There also was the question of
whether clan leaders have any control
over free-lance bandits terrorizing peo
ple and stealing food.
Yesterday, snipers took aim at U.S.
forces in the capital in more than half a
dozen attacks, including an attempted
ambush in the dark outside the walls of
the former U.S. Embassy compound,

now the Marines' headquarters.
Alerted by a lookout, the Marines
fired first, killing three Somalis. No
Americans were injured.
On a one-day visit to Somalia yester
day, seven U.S. congressmen inspected
relief projects in Baidoa, a town in the
so-called "famine triangle" in the inte
rior. As the congressmen returned to a
Mogadishu soccer stadium being used
by Marines, snipers fired a few rounds
in their direction.
Marines hustled the legislators, clad
in camouflage fatigues, into rooms
beneath the stadium. They left the area
in an armored personnel carrier.
