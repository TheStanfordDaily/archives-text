# Iraq allegedly took arms
## 
### 
LONDON (AP) — About 200 Iraqis
crossed into Kuwait early yesterday and
seized missiles and other weapons before
returning to Iraq, the Kuwaiti News Agen
cy quoted a U.N. spokesman as saying.
The spokesman for the U.N. Observa
tion Mission in Kuwait, who was not iden
tified in the report, was quoted as saying
the Iraqis crossed the border at 7:10 a.m.
(12:10 a.m. EST) in heavy transport vehi
cles and seized armaments in six trenches
on the Kuwaiti side.
Four silkworm missiles were among the
arms taken, the spokesman reportedly said.
A U.N. spokesman in New York, Willard
Hass, said late yesterday that he had no
knowledge of an Iraqi incursion.
Also yesterday, Iraq denied that it had
bowed to an allied ultimatum to withdraw
missiles from its southern border and
stepped up tensions by warning that any
flights of U.N. aircraft over Iraq would be
"fraught with danger."
A spokesman for Saddam Hussein's rul
ing Revolutionary Command Council
claimed the confrontation over anti-air
craft missiles in southern Iraq was created
by President Bush because of personal
grudges against Iraq. He suggested Bagh
dad was hoping for better relations with
President-elect Clinton.
The United States, France, Britain and
Russia had given Baghdad until Friday
night to remove anti-aircraft missiles from
southern Iraq, where the allies are enforc
ing a "no-fly" zone to protect Shiite rebels.

U.S. officials said Saturday that Iraq had
"backed down" and moved the missiles.
But the Iraqi spokesman, said the
White House and Pentagon assertions
were "not true."
"Our planes and our air missiles are in
the places where we decided they should be,"
said the spokesman, who was not identified.
He accused Washington of trying "to
mislead public opinion or to damage our
credibility."
U.S. officials in Washington had no
comment yesterday.
The defiant warning was included in a
letter from Hussein's government outlin
ing new restrictions on U.N. weapons
inspectors that would bar them from flying
into Iraq in their own planes.
Diplomats said it appeared the rules also
might bar inspectors from using U.N. air
craft within Iraq, which could hamper
efforts to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction. The head of the inspectors,
Rolf Ekeus, said Baghdad's move could
prompt military action by the allies.
The Baghdad government told the Unit
ed Nations that the inspectors must fly into
Iraq on Iraqi Airways planes, which have
been grounded by U.N. economic sanctions
since Hussein's army invaded Kuwait.
"Legally, this might mean that if one
feels that Iraq has violated the cease-fire
conditions, this could lead to a formal war
situation between the coalition partners
and Iraq. And that means military
actions," Ekeus said.
