Snide comments about
Chico State example of
snotty Stanford attitude

Normally, I'd let it
slide. Since the power of the
press is on our side, it's The
Daily's custom to let our letter
writers hare the last word on our
pages. However, I feel a careless
comment in one of Friday's letters
— tangential to its main point —
demands a response.
In a letter criticizing The Daily's
method of choosing ideal gradua
tion speakers, Mark Williams flip
pantly remarked that he "can see
(fame being used) as a basis for
selection of a speaker at, say Chico
State, where the most-read period
ical might by People magazine."
For a Stanford graduate, Williams
seems to paint the world with dis
turbingly broad brush strokes.
It's precisely this kind of intel
lectual snobbery — assuming a stu
dent at a state school is less intelli
gent than a Stanford student —
that makes me embarassed to go to
Stanford, that leads me to tell peo
ple I go to school "in the Bay Area,"
rather than deflect their assump
tions about Stanford students.
If Chico students resent being
saddled with a "party school" stig
ma, I resent being labeled a snob
bish brat because I go here. And
careless comments like Williams'
do much to feed both stereotypes.
I spent last summer living and
working in Chico, Calif., and fell in
love with the town. The pace is
slower, the people are friendlier, and
I was actually more likely to talk
politics and literature in a Chico bar
than I am when I go out at Stanford.
Most people who mock state
schools base their assumptions on
their "party school" reputations. In
the case of Chico, this stems from
being named the nation's No.l
party school by Playboy magazine a
few years ago — primarily for their
now-defunct Pioneer Days, an

annual alcohol-heavy festival.
And while a few students may
enjoy the "party school" title, the
overwhelming response on their
campus was outrage and resent
ment — not just from faculty, but
students as well. When Playboy
representatives returned to Chico
this fall, their presence was protest
ed vehemently by the student body.
In recent years, Stanford, too,
has been saddled with a stigma it
has had difficulty shaking. The indi
rect-cost controversy has left Stan
ford with a reputation as an elitist
school that cheats taxpayers out of
their money to feed its gluttonous
need for luxury and opulence.
And while those of us associated
with the school may find the charges
ludicrous, it's easy to see why anti-
Stanford sentiments have caught on
so rapidly: Resentment runs high
for schools associated with privilege,
schools whose graduates look down
upon "lesser" institutions.
But not everyone's life leads
them down the yellow brick road
to Stanford. And it's often socioe
conomic class — not intelligence —
that determines one's route
through higher education.
As tuition at schools like Stan
ford skyrocket, state schools
become the only financial option
for many students. Other factors
— such as an unstable family life
or growing up in a rural environ
ment — prevent intelligent stu
dents from becoming stand-out
college candidates.
And for many other students —
who want to have fun, as well as
get an education — choosing Chico
is a conscious choice, not an unfor
tunate accident.
Assuming that students at a
state school are inferior to those at
Stanford is not only incredibly arro
gant, it's dead wrong. And spewing
stereotypes about any group is a
dangerous practice, indeed.
So for the same reason Chico
students protested Playboy, I
refuse to let seemingly harmless
comments like Williams' go by
unchallenged.
