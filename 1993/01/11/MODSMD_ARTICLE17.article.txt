## A 						romantic prerogative 
### 
IN SHAKESPEARE'S TIME THEY
performed the tragedy "Othello." In
our parents' day the production was
"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." A year
ago we saw "Jungle Fever," and last
quarter, "Zebrahead." Over the past half
millennium the complexities of interra
cial romance have pierced Western soci
ety ferociously, and have been crisply
reflected in Western culture.
In today's world, with nationwide race
relations critically passionate, the issue is
both poignant and unsettled; any opinion
powerfully stated is guaranteed to be just
as forcefully opposed. Most of us discov
ered this a month ago when discussing.
The Daily's end-of-quarter series on the
subject.
Much of the debate seems to center
around the preservation of culture, and
in some ways I can understand that. Hav
ing a partner who has shared our cultur
al experiences is extremely important to
some.
We may want our kids to grow up in a
Chinese-speaking household, or we may
simply be more comfortable spending
time with someone from a similar back
ground, whom we feel will be better able
to understand us.
If we want to be happy, we have abso
lutely every prerogative to lead our
romantic lives any way we see fit.
Unfortunately, to some the issue has
become more than just a personal one.

There are those who see the interracial
romances of friends and family as a
threatening cultural attack, something
which must be battled and controlled.
This attitude is frighteningly wrong.
Last spring, a friend of mine (who hap
pens to be white) was invited by her
boyfriend (who happens to be black) to a
fraternity function held on campus.
At one point during an address to the
crowd, one of the hosts listed challenges
faced by the black community — included
were drugs, crime, and unbelievably,
white women.
Most likely the speaker never even
knew that one of his targets was in the
audience, but that in no way lessens the
impact of his comments. How was she
supposed to feel about such an attack?
It shocks me that an attitude that bla
tantly ugly and racist exists and is toler
ated on a campus claiming to be as open
as ours; and with this anecdote I certain
ly don't mean to imply that it's a problem
limited to blacks and whites.
Interracial couples are frequently sub
jected to open disapprovals and "fetish"
accusations from the very communities
that claim them as members.
Imagine a white speaker urging the
protection of white women from black
men — the campus would be violently
and rightfully disgusted. Racial prejudice
and hatred are wrong no matter which
way we slice it.

It shouldn't matter if more women
than men are dating outside of a race, or
vice versa.
We certainly can't continue to label
entire classes of people as destabilizing
and point accusatory fingers where we
think we've identified fetishes, no matter
what race we are and what our cultural
background is. To do so is to deny the
unique experience of romance and reduce
it to some sort of racial plot.
At least have the decency to realize
that people's personal lives are nobody
else's concern. I don't know where we got
the idea that if people are happy together
it's our problem and our place to inter
fere, but it's intolerably wrong.
Perhaps to some, preserving culture is
an important part of identity. But if oth
ers don't identify racially in exactly same
way and have expanded their romantic
horizons to include people from other
races, it's not a plot to dilute their own
culture.
And it wouldn't be any of our business
even if it were.
