Student faced offensive questions at UCLA interview

IFEEL IT IS IMPERATIVE TO state
my grievance regarding my interview
for admission with a doctor at the
UCLA School of Medicine last month.
Several comments made by the doctor
were offensive and inappropriate, given
the context of our meeting was to discuss
my suitability for the next entering class
of the UCLA School of Medicine.
<â–  Before I explain further, I would like
to state that I do not believe the doctor's
comments were intentionally malicious. I
do not think he realized how disturbing
his comments were. However, this lack
oif knowledge should not in any way jus
tify his inappropriate and improper
behavior.
1 In reviewing my application out loud,
the doctor stated that my mother had
received a degree from USC and had

then become a homemaker. He proceed
ed to note sarcastically that "the femi
nists" would "sure like this" and then
smugly laughed to himself. This remark
insulted my mother and me, as it belit
tled feminists. I doubt he realized that
both my mother and I are feminists; we
both believe in equal rights, treatment
and opportunities for women.
Later, the doctor prefaced two ques
tions with the disclaimer that he asked
them of both his male and female inter
viewees.
He asked me if I was married or had a
serious boyfriend. I answered both ques
tions in the negative. Then he asked me
what I thought of marriage. I told him
that marriage would be a nice addition to
life if I found the right person.
I was then interrupted by his reassur

ance that I would certainly find a hus
band. After all, I was "attractive (pause)
and intelligent." He then proceeded to
shower me with unsolicited advice. He
warned me against marrying someone
"below" me. He said that only another
professional would understand how diffi
cult and demanding professional life is.'
He said that only other doctors or per
haps lawyers would be good, understand
ing husbands. The doctor then alluded to
a professional woman whose marriage to
a truck driver failed.
I find it difficult to believe that the
doctor advises his male applicants in the
same manner. How any of the previous
comments apply to my medical school
application remains a mystery to me.
When the doctor discussed these
issues, I immediately felt ill at ease. But

while I became enraged on the inside, I
smiled on the outside. I felt powerless, as
I believed that I had to remain civil with
him. I could not tell him how I truly felt,
how his words disturbed and belittled
me, how they distorted what should have
been a professional interview.
I know that my interview with this
doctor does not reflect the School
of Medicine's general attitudes. I hope
that by bringing this incident to your
attention, something can be done to pre
vent its reoccurrence.
