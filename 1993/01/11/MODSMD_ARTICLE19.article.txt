A letter in Friday's Daily was given
an inappropriate headline. The letter,
written by Mark Williams, was head
lined, "Sec. Gen. of UN, others
deemed unfit graduation speakers."
However, Williams' letter did not
object to The Daily's inclusion of the
secretary general of the United
Nations on a list of possible candi
dates for Stanford's 1993 graduation
speaker. Rather, it criticized the
methodology The Daily used to
arrive at the names (i.e.: fame).
