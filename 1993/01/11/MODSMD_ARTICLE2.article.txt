## Clown-doctor encourages students not to pursue medicine just for money 
### Carly Berwick Staff writer 
A doctor who earns his money as a professional
clown exhorted students at the School of Medicine on
Friday to pursue medicine "for fun, not for funds."
Dr. Patch Adams, founder of the Virginia-based
Gesundheit Institute, told a packed lecture hall that
"Medicine as a business is ethically wrong." The in
stitute has provided free medical care for 15,000 pa
tients over the past 12 years.
"You will be wealthy as a health care professional
if you are intoxicated by intimacy," Adams said. Vig
orously encouraging the audience to engage in a So
cratic dialogue on health care, Adams criticized tra
ditional medicine on issues of cost, de-humanization,
malpractice and third-party reimbursement.
Instead of "defensive medicine," Adams preached
health care as a means of recreating community and
identity.
"Boredom, loneliness and fear is the description of
the modern population," he said. "Health is not the
absence of disease but a happy, exuberant life."
Adams is currently attempting to demonstrate the
feasibility of low-cost, high-care medicine with the
transformation of the institute into a hospital.
While a normal hospital charges thousands of dollars
for a Caesarean section, Adams said
his hospital could perform the pro
cedure for less than $75.
When asked what kind of costs
would be cut, Adams responded
that staff salaries would be negli
gible, the hospital would not carry
malpractice insurance, and equip
ment would be donated.
In addition to lowering costs,
Adams said he envisions health
care as encompassing "all the
healing arts." The new institute
will include 30,000 square feet
devoted to the performing arts
and beds for students and care
givers as well as patients.
Fully equipped with slides and
tunnels, the new facility will be "a

kind of Disneyland meets Monty
Python and decides to play doc
tor," he said.
For Adams, the doctor's role is
as a giver. "Our ideal patient is
someone who wants to have a deep,
intimate relationship," he said.
Like many other advocates of
alternative medicine, he empha
sized the importance of the
patient's mental health in his or
her physical well-being.
When an audience member
questioned him on how this
approach would work with a
schizophrenic, he replied, "If the
patient was rolling around the
ground eating dirt, I'd be right
there with him."
Second-year medical student
Don Wolf called Adams a "social rev
olutionary of love" and said he sees
him as an "excellent role model" for
aspiring medical school students.
