## Clown-doctor encourages students not to pursue medicine just for money 
### Carly Berwick Staff writer 
A doctor who earns his money as a professional
clown exhorted students at the School of Medicine on
Friday to pursue medicine "for fun, not for funds."
Dr. Patch Adams, founder of the Virginia-based
Gesundheit Institute, told a packed lecture hall that
"Medicine as a business is ethically wrong." The in
stitute has provided free medical care for 15,000 pa
tients over the past 12 years.
"You will be wealthy as a health care professional
if you are intoxicated by intimacy," Adams said. Vig
orously encouraging the audience to engage in a So
cratic dialogue on health care, Adams criticized tra
ditional medicine on issues of cost, de-humanization,
malpractice and third-party reimbursement.
Instead of "defensive medicine," Adams preached
health care as a means of recreating community and
identity.
"Boredom, loneliness and fear is the description of
the modern population," he said. "Health is not the
absence of disease but a happy, exuberant life."
Adams is currently attempting to demonstrate the
feasibility of low-cost, high-care medicine with the
transformation of the institute into a hospital.
