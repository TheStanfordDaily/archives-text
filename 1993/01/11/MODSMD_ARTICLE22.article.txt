## Hoops downs Ducks 71-66 for first conference win 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Whatever coach Mike Mont
gomery said to the Stanford bas
ketball team at halftime Saturday
night, he should say it again.
After trailing by five points at
the break, Montgomery's speech
spurred Stanford to life, as the
Cardinal staged a 15-point
turnaround to defeat Oregon 71-
66 at Maples Pavilion for its first
Pacific 10 Conference win of the
season.
"On Friday, I told the team
that our effort and preparation
were good on Thursday night, but
individual performances had to
change," Montgomery said.
"They changed tonight."
Stanford (6-7, 1-1 Pac-10)
became more aggressive following
the Montgomery lecture. Forward
Brent Williams, whom Mont
gomery saw as a potentially domi
nant player before the season
began, finally showed signs of liv

ing up to those expectations in the
second half after a lackluster first
period. Before the intermission,
Williams displayed what had
become an all-too-familiar sight of
this young season in the form of
failed shots and casual court pres
ence.
In the first half, Williams
missed six of nine attempts,
including a brutal miss of a wide
open uncontested 10-foot jumper
on the left baseline near the end
of the period that caused the
3,354 assembled in Maples to
shake their heads disapprovingly.
But Williams was a new man in
the second 20 minutes. With the
help of well-placed passes from
guard Marcus Lollie, Williams
converted seven of 10 shots, three
of which were dunks, to finish
with a career-high 25 points.
"I wasn't playing up to my
effort level, and the other guys got
on my ass at halftime, especially
coach," Williams said. "I could
feel that my jumper my legs

weren't there, so in the second
half I just started taking it to the
hole."
Lollie also stepped up his game
another notch to get the Cardinal
offense going in the second half.
He scored 11 points, but more
impressive was the fact that he
dished out a career-high 11
assists without committing a
turnover.
"Marcus did an excellent job in
running the floor," said Williams.
"The key to the game was his pen
etration. It opened everybody
up."
Oregon (7-7, 0-2) tried to close
the door on Stanford early via a
barrage of outside shooting.
Antione Stoudamire, Orlando
Williams and Johnny Reece made
four of the six three-point shots
that they would tally in the game
in the first eight minutes to allow
the Ducks to race out to a 14-9
lead. Stanford managed to keep
