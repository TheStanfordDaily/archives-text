## Hoops downs Ducks 71-66 for first conference win 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Whatever coach Mike Mont
gomery said to the Stanford bas
ketball team at halftime Saturday
night, he should say it again.
After trailing by five points at
the break, Montgomery's speech
spurred Stanford to life, as the
Cardinal staged a 15-point
turnaround to defeat Oregon 71-
66 at Maples Pavilion for its first
Pacific 10 Conference win of the
season.
"On Friday, I told the team
that our effort and preparation
were good on Thursday night, but
individual performances had to
change," Montgomery said.
"They changed tonight."
Stanford (6-7, 1-1 Pac-10)
became more aggressive following
the Montgomery lecture. Forward
Brent Williams, whom Mont
gomery saw as a potentially domi
nant player before the season
began, finally showed signs of liv

ing up to those expectations in the
second half after a lackluster first
period. Before the intermission,
Williams displayed what had
become an all-too-familiar sight of
this young season in the form of
failed shots and casual court pres
ence.
In the first half, Williams
missed six of nine attempts,
including a brutal miss of a wide
open uncontested 10-foot jumper
on the left baseline near the end
of the period that caused the
3,354 assembled in Maples to
shake their heads disapprovingly.
But Williams was a new man in
the second 20 minutes. With the
help of well-placed passes from
guard Marcus Lollie, Williams
converted seven of 10 shots, three
of which were dunks, to finish
with a career-high 25 points.
"I wasn't playing up to my
effort level, and the other guys got
on my ass at halftime, especially
coach," Williams said. "I could
feel that my jumper my legs

weren't there, so in the second
half I just started taking it to the
hole."
Lollie also stepped up his game
another notch to get the Cardinal
offense going in the second half.
He scored 11 points, but more
impressive was the fact that he
dished out a career-high 11
assists without committing a
turnover.
"Marcus did an excellent job in
running the floor," said Williams.
"The key to the game was his pen
etration. It opened everybody
up."
Oregon (7-7, 0-2) tried to close
the door on Stanford early via a
barrage of outside shooting.
Antione Stoudamire, Orlando
Williams and Johnny Reece made
four of the six three-point shots
that they would tally in the game
in the first eight minutes to allow
the Ducks to race out to a 14-9
lead. Stanford managed to keep

the score close despite the hot
hand of Stoudamire, who finished
with 20 points, and trailed by less
than eight throughout the half.
The Cardinal managed to cut
Oregon's lead to one at the 3:18
mark before Oregon converted on
two possessions to bring the score
to 32-27 at the half.
The new found aggressiveness
of Stanford became evident early
in the second period, as Stanford
reeled off eight points — a
jumper by Williams and three
inside baskets by freshman Dar
ren Allaway — to Oregon's three
to tie the score at 35. Peter
Dukes got into the act following
two free throws by Stoudamire
with a fast break layup, and then
reserve Bart Lammersen, who
had a career-high 11 points,
tipped in a Dukes miss to put
Stanford in the lead for good at
39-37.
"The momentum switched at
the half, and we didn't meet their
enthusiasm," explained Oregon
coach Jerry Green.
The Cardinal stretched its lead
to 10 while holding Oregon to
33.3 percent shooting in the sec
ond half before Duck guard Andre
Collier hit a jumper and a three
pointer, and teammate Stoud
amire added a three to cut Stan

ford's lead to 64-61 at the 1:08
mark. The teams proceeded to
trade free throws before Williams
slammed down a tomahawk dunk
with 34 seconds left on a long
inbounds pass from Nick Ravn to
seal the victory.
"This was a big win for us,"
Montgomery said. "It's not mon
umental or earthshaking, but it
shows that we can compete in this
league and get some wins."
Stanford will host Notre Dame
tomorrow night before facing Cal
ifornia in Berkeley on Thursday.

Whatever coach Mike Mont
gomery said to the Stanford bas
ketball team at halftime Saturday
night, he should say it again.
After trailing by five points at
the break, Montgomery's speech
spurred Stanford to life, as the
Cardinal staged a 15-point
turnaround to defeat Oregon 71-
66 at Maples Pavilion for its first
Pacific 10 Conference win of the
season.
"On Friday, I told the team
that our effort and preparation
were good on Thursday night, but
individual performances had to
change," Montgomery said.
"They changed tonight."
Stanford (6-7, 1-1 Pac-10)
became more aggressive following
the Montgomery lecture. Forward
Brent Williams, whom Mont
gomery saw as a potentially domi
nant player before the season
began, finally showed signs of liv

ing up to those expectations in the
second half after a lackluster first
period. Before the intermission,
Williams displayed what had
become an all-too-familiar sight of
this young season in the form of
failed shots and casual court pres
ence.
In the first half, Williams
missed six of nine attempts,
including a brutal miss of a wide
open uncontested 10-foot jumper
on the left baseline near the end
of the period that caused the
3,354 assembled in Maples to
shake their heads disapprovingly.
But Williams was a new man in
the second 20 minutes. With the
help of well-placed passes from
guard Marcus Lollie, Williams
converted seven of 10 shots, three
of which were dunks, to finish
with a career-high 25 points.
"I wasn't playing up to my
effort level, and the other guys got
on my ass at halftime, especially
coach," Williams said. "I could
feel that my jumper my legs

weren't there, so in the second
half I just started taking it to the
hole."
Lollie also stepped up his game
another notch to get the Cardinal
offense going in the second half.
He scored 11 points, but more
impressive was the fact that he
dished out a career-high 11
assists without committing a
turnover.
"Marcus did an excellent job in
running the floor," said Williams.
"The key to the game was his pen
etration. It opened everybody
up."
Oregon (7-7, 0-2) tried to close
the door on Stanford early via a
barrage of outside shooting.
Antione Stoudamire, Orlando
Williams and Johnny Reece made
four of the six three-point shots
that they would tally in the game
in the first eight minutes to allow
the Ducks to race out to a 14-9
lead. Stanford managed to keep

the score close despite the hot
hand of Stoudamire, who finished
with 20 points, and trailed by less
than eight throughout the half.
The Cardinal managed to cut
Oregon's lead to one at the 3:18
mark before Oregon converted on
two possessions to bring the score
to 32-27 at the half.
The new found aggressiveness
of Stanford became evident early
in the second period, as Stanford
reeled off eight points — a
jumper by Williams and three
inside baskets by freshman Dar
ren Allaway — to Oregon's three
to tie the score at 35. Peter
Dukes got into the act following
two free throws by Stoudamire
with a fast break layup, and then
reserve Bart Lammersen, who
had a career-high 11 points,
tipped in a Dukes miss to put
Stanford in the lead for good at
39-37.
"The momentum switched at
the half, and we didn't meet their
enthusiasm," explained Oregon
coach Jerry Green.
The Cardinal stretched its lead
to 10 while holding Oregon to
33.3 percent shooting in the sec
ond half before Duck guard Andre
Collier hit a jumper and a three
pointer, and teammate Stoud
amire added a three to cut Stan

ford's lead to 64-61 at the 1:08
mark. The teams proceeded to
trade free throws before Williams
slammed down a tomahawk dunk
with 34 seconds left on a long
inbounds pass from Nick Ravn to
seal the victory.
"This was a big win for us,"
Montgomery said. "It's not mon
umental or earthshaking, but it
shows that we can compete in this
league and get some wins."
