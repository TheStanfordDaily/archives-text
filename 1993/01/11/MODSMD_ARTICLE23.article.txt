# Stars shine as Lollie, Williams lead second-half surge

After a string of preseason performances that at
times seemed soggier than the weather, Marcus Lol
lie and Brent Williams have finally proven that
there may be life after Adam Keefe after all.
Stanford's 71-66 win over the Oregon Ducks on
Saturday night was mostly thanks to the aggressive
play of Williams and Lollie, play which inspired the
sometimes-sluggish Cardinal out of its preseason
slumber and on to its first conference win.
Aggressiveness was the name of the game for
Stanford in the second half, as Lollie drove and pen
etrated to open up key scoring opportunities for
Brent Williams and the rest of the Cardinal big men.
As a result, Williams exploded for a career-high 25
points and six rebounds on 10-for-19 shooting,
remarkable numbers considering that he was only
3-for-9 with six points at the half.
"I wasn't playing that well in the first half,"
Williams said. "The other guys were telling me to
get going and pick up my play, and that's when I
knew I had to step up."

As for Lollie, he finished with 11 points and 11
assists — all without a single turnover.
"That's my job — that's what I do," Lollie said.
"There was no change in plan, I was just trying to be
more aggressive out there."
Lollie's play proved to be the highlight of the
game for the Cardinal, as the 6-foot senior point
guard found hole after hole in the Duck defense and
single-handedly rejuvenated the Stanford offense.
"We'll see a lot more of that," Lollie said. "I'll
penetrate and kick out to Brent or Fete, and hope
fully they'll get some shots down. I'll just try to get
out and run the court, and we'll get our shots."
Cardinal head coach Mike Montgomery noted
that the key to the Cardinal's success this year will
be performances like those from Lollie and
Williams.
"Before the game, I told the team that individual
performances had to improve, and that we had to
step up and play better basketball," Montgomery
said. "Marcus gets 11 assists, Brent gets 25 points
on better than 50 percent shooting. If you have to
point a finger, you don't have to point any further
than that."
