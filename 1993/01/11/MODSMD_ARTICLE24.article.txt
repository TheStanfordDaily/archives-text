# Women back on track in 91-72 rout
## Five in double figures as Cardinal completes Oregon sweep in Eugene 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
Val Whiting scored 23 points
to lead five players in double fig
ures as Stanford exploded for 57
second-half points to defeat Ore
gon, 91-72, in Eugene Saturday
night.
On a cold, snowy night out
doors, the Cardinal (11-2 overall,
2-0 in Pacific 10 Conference play)
finally generated some heat
indoors, outscoring the Ducks 35-
15 in the final 10-1/2 minutes
after Oregon guard Peggy
Swadener hit a three-pointer to
give her team its last lead of the
night, 57-56.
Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer was pleased to have com
pleted the team's first Pac-10
road trip successfully. "This was
a great road trip for us," she said.
"It will help us improve as a
team."
Joining Whiting in double fig
ures was Rachel Hemmer, who
had her best game since return
ing from an eye injury, scoring
18 points on 8-for-9 shooting
from the floor. Molly Gooden
bour, Anita Kaplan and Christy
Hedgpeth also added 14 points
apiece.
Hedgpeth single-handedly
outdueled the Ducks, 9-1, during
one late stretch, expanding the
Cardinal's lead from five to 13
points. Returning to the starting
lineup after coming off the bench
for two games, the junior hit once
from three-point range, convert
ed four free-throw attempts and
banked home a jumper to finish
off a fast break that started with
a blocked shot by Whiting during
the run.
Missing from the Oregon line
up for the sixth consecutive game
was junior Debbie Sporcich.
Through the Ducks' first five con
tests, the 6-foot, 4-inch forward
had averaged 16 points and 10
rebounds per game.
In Sporcich's absence, Cindy
Murphy matched her season high
with 17 points off the bench to
lead Oregon's scoring attack. But
despite Murphy's performance,
the Ducks (6-5, 0-2) sorely
missed their star forward, espe
cially with center Sara Wilson in
foul trouble throughout the sec
ond half.
Whiting, Hemmer and Kaplan
were all able to capitalize on size
mismatches, as Oregon played

without anyone over six feet tall
for much of the second period,
including the last 7:37, after Wil
son fouled out.
VanDerveer started the same
three-guard lineup that she cred
ited with giving Stanford a lift in
the second half of the Oregon
State game Thursday night, say
ing she hoped Goodenbour, Hedg
peth and Kate Pave could get the
team off and running right away
Saturday.
But although the Cardinal
only turned the ball over five
times in the first half (as opposed
to 24 times in the first half of the
previous game), the Stanford
offense continued to struggle as it
has much of this season.
Led by All-Americans Whiting
and Goodenbour, the Cardinal
did manage a 6-0 run and, later, a
9-0 spurt in the first half. Howev
er, Stanford failed to sustain its
attack, in part because Oregon
switched to a 2-3 matchup zone,
which, like other pressure defens
es the squad has faced, at times
got the best of the Cardinal
guards.
At halftime the game was tied
at 34, as both squads met with lit
tle success shooting from the
perimeter. Oregon launched an
improbable 14 three-point
attempts in the first 20 minutes,
finding the bottom of the net only
three times, while the Cardinal
fared no better, sinking only one
of six first-half three-point tries.
Curdinal Notes
The Cardinal's victory was its
11th consecutive against the Ducks,
dating back to 1987.

a pair of road wins in Oregon.
