Tennis
Both Cardinal tennis teams
spent last weekend in rain
soaked Southern California as
they did battle in the National
Collegiate Tennis Classic in
Palm Springs.
On the men's side, unseeded
Robert Devens earned a singles
co-championship with USC's
top-seeded Brian MacPhie as
the final match was called on
account of the inclement
weather. Devens had earned a
spot in the final with a thrilling
7-6 (16-14), 1-6, 6-3 victory
over Mark Schmidt of Notre
Dame, while MacPhie defeated
Stanford's Chris Cocotos 6-2,
6-2 in the other semifinal.
On the women's side,

returning champion Laxmi
Poruri defended her crown by
sharing a co-championship
with Duke's Julie Exum.
Poruri had downed Duke's
Susan Sommerville 6-3, 6-2 in
semifinal action before rain
stopped all play.
Women's gymnastics
Stanford's women's gym
nastics team suffered a
191.75-186.30 dual-meet loss
to Cal State Fullerton in
Southern California last Fri
day night.
Freshman Hillary Anderson
was a lone bright spot for the
Cardinal, as she placed second
in both the balance beam (9.75)
and uneven bars (9.70).
