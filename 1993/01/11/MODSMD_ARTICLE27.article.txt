### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
In its first appearance of the
season, the defending NCAA
champion Stanford men's gym
nastics team finished fourth out
of 11 teams in the Spartan Open
last weekend in a two-day compe
tition.
lowa State captured the top
spot in the first major meet in the
United States since the Barcelona
Olympics with a team score of
'270.35. California and New Mexi
co ended the meet in second and
third with scores of '268.4 and
267.4, respectively.
Stanford's fourth-place score
of 265.75 did not daunt head
coach Sadao Hamada. "1 was just
happy to finish this weekend
without any injuries," he said.
"The team is in very good physi
cal shape at this point but not in
good routine shape."
While many expected Stanford
to place higher in the team com
petition, Hamada chose not to
focus on the outcome but rather
to use the meet as a gauge to
determine the team's overall level
at the outset of the season.
"We didn't really go out to win
this; mainly I wanted to see what
we need to focus on from now
on," Hamada said. "By the middle
of February we should be going
strong."
In the individual finals on Sat
urday night, Stanford gymnasts
impressively placed in the top
four in all six events. .Junior

Jason Cohen finished first on the
floor exercise with a score of 9.60,
and also earned second place on
the vault with a 9.05.
Senior Jair Lynch captured
the top spot on the parallel bars
with a 9.75, followed by sopho
more Josh Stein, who placed third
with 9.10. On the pommel horse,
sophomore Jing-Wei Liang's 9.50
secured a second place finish,
while Stein came in fourth with a
9.30. Senior Jeff Bender rounded
off the list with a 9.30 on the
rings, good enough for fourth
place.
"We have been focusing on
single skills instead of our new
routines," Liang said While he is
convinced these routines will
come with time, he hopes to
improve his abilities on all six
events, adding more difficult
skills.
Liang added that the new Fed
eration of International Gymnas
tics rules "make competition
harder than before We need to
catch up with the new trend."
These rules added an extra skill
level incorporating the hardest
skills.
Hamada used the opportunity
"to get a feel for the new judging
The new F I G. rules make it a
whole new ball game and 1 now
have a better idea of how they will
be judging us during the season."
While Stanford's team finish
may have been disappointing to
some, impressive individual per
formances prove Stanford's top
ranked status is well deserved
