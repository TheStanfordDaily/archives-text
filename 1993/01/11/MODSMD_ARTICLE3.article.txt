# Putting 'the demon on the run':
## Stanford helps Czechs prevent heart disease 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
Doctors and researchers from the
Medical Center are helping reduce
the rate of heart disease halfway
around the world, in the newly
formed Czech Republic.
Along with doctors at the UC-San
Francisco Medical Center, Stanford
clinicians are actively advising physi
cians and other health experts in the
Republic on how to fight heart disease
and prevent strokes in their country.

The effort is a $2 million, five-year
project called "The Program for the
Reduction of Cardiovascular and Cere
bralvascular Diseases in the Czech Re
public."
Using a process known as technolo
gy transfer, members of the two Amer
ican medical centers are empowering
the Czech physicians with the knowl
edge needed to take care of the most
pressing health concerns in their coun
try today, said Dr. John Farquar, one
of the project's principal investigators.
"They (the Czech physicians) are

the ones who will become the trainers
of others," said Farquar, director of
the Stanford Center for Research in
Disease Prevention.
Members of the National Institute
of Public Health in Prague are the
ones responsible for bringing these
new techniques to the community of
Dubec, a suburb of the nation's capi
tal, he added.
Last summer, 16 health specialists
from the Republic came to Stanford
and UCSF to learn more about the
methods of treating patients with car

diovascular problems, said Medical
School research associate Cheryl Al
bright, project director and co-princi
pal investigator. The project officially
began in March.
According to Farquar, the Czech
Republic has the second-highest rate
of cardiovascular disease in the world.
Scotland is believed to have the high
est rate, he added.
The program's purpose is twofold,
said Albright. The U.S. staff teaches
primary prevention, aiming to pre
vent heart attacks and strokes
before they happen.
In addition, they are helping
the Czech physicians learn the
processes of information dissemi
nation so that Czech citizens can
learn more about the nutrition,
diet and exercise necessary to pre
vent heart disease, she said.
The Czechs have "a lot of fatty
foods," Albright said. They fre
quently eat "pork and beef, and a lot
of cream sauces and a lot of eggs."
Their diet is very salty, she added.
The Republic's high smoking
rate also contributes to the
increased rate of deaths due to
heart disease, she said.
Farquar explained that the
three primary causes of heart prob

lems are smoking, high blood pres
sure and high serum cholesterol.
"We have the demon on the run
here in the United States," he said.
In addition to having national
advertisements against smoking
and educational information avail
able regarding the negative effects
of certain foods on the body, "the
U.S. has led the world in develop
ing leaner pigs," Farquar said.
He said he hopes that technol
ogy transfer will take place
between American agricultural
ists and those in the Republic.
Because this is a voluntary pro
ject, the public has been very sup
portive of it, Albright said. In the
past, under communist rule, the
Czechs were " 'required' to par
take in certain (governmental]
events," she explained.
The Czech health specialists
"were a quick study," she said.
Albright regularly corresponds
with the physicians in the Repub

lie through conventional mail,
electronic mail and faxes.
On their own, "they have
translated many of the materials"
given to them by the U.S. experts
into their own language, she said.
They are "very cooperative land)
very knowledgeable" in their
areas of expertise as well as in
English, she added.
According to Farquar, this
"small project can ramify like a
pebble in the pond and the waves
will wash them up on more than
one beach."
The prevention and interven
tion program is one of 10 funded
by the U.S. Agency for Interna
tional Development. In each of
the programs, health care experts
from U.S. institutions work with
colleagues in Eastern Europe to
tackle various health problems.
Other nations participating in
similar efforts include Slovakia,
Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria.
