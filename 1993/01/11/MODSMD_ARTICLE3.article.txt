## Stanford helps Czechs prevent heart disease 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
Doctors and researchers from the
Medical Center are helping reduce
the rate of heart disease halfway
around the world, in the newly
formed Czech Republic.
Along with doctors at the UC-San
Francisco Medical Center, Stanford
clinicians are actively advising physi
cians and other health experts in the
Republic on how to fight heart disease
and prevent strokes in their country.

The effort is a $2 million, five-year
project called "The Program for the
Reduction of Cardiovascular and Cere

Using a process known as technolo
gy transfer, members of the two Amer
ican medical centers are empowering
the Czech physicians with the knowl
edge needed to take care of the most
pressing health concerns in their coun
try today, said Dr. John Farquar, one
of the project's principal investigators.
"They (the Czech physicians) are

the ones who will become the trainers
of others," said Farquar, director of
the Stanford Center for Research in
Disease Prevention.
Members of the National Institute
of Public Health in Prague are the
ones responsible for bringing these
new techniques to the community of
Dubec, a suburb of the nation's capi
tal, he added.
Last summer, 16 health specialists
from the Republic came to Stanford
and UCSF to learn more about the
methods of treating patients with car

diovascular problems, said Medical
School research associate Cheryl Al
bright, project director and co-princi
pal investigator. The project officially
began in March.
According to Farquar, the Czech
Republic has the second-highest rate
of cardiovascular disease in the world.
Scotland is believed to have the high
est rate, he added.
The program's purpose is twofold,
said Albright. The U.S. staff teaches
