# On-line library
## Card catalogs fully contained on Socrates 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
Card catalogs have gone the
way of slide rules and 8-tracks, as
the conversion of all University li
brary records from card catalogs
to the Socrates/NOTIS on-line
catalog has been finished, library
officials announced last week.
The completion of the Retro
spective Conversion (RECON)
Project means that information
on all titles in all of the Universi
ty's branches are now accessible
through on-line computers.
But the coordinate libraries of
the Hoover Institution, Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, and
Law School, as well as the Lane
Medical and Jackson Business Li
braries, are not part of the
RECON project. They each have
their own conversion projects and
different time schedules.
"The RECON project means
that records of all holdings will be
in one place — meaning Socrates
— whereas before you had to go to
Socrates and the card catalog,"
said Cynthia Gozzi, director of
technical services for the libraries.
The completion of the project
allows anyone around the globe to
get information such as whether
the University owns an item and
whether it is available, according
to Keith Mowen, manager of the
RECON project since 1984. All
one needs is a computer connected
to a network which can access the
on-line catalog.
Library records have also been
entered into two nationwide data
bases that virtually all public li
braries use: the Online Computer
Library Center and the Research
Libraries Information Network,
said Mowen.
Most major universities in the
United States can access the vari
ous networks needed to retrieve
information from on-line catalogs
at other universities, said Gozzi.
However, Stanford is one of only a
few schools which have converted
their records completely to an on
line catalog.

In addition to information
sharing, another advantage of the
RECON project is that library cir
culation information is now auto
mated. People will be able to check
the status of an item without
going to the library, said Donna
Hjertberg, data services specialist
and publicity coordinator for Cub
berley Library.
Mowen said checking out mate
rials will also be an automated

At the beginning of
the project, about
800,000 book titles,
52,000 serials, 20,000
musical scores, and
1,500 recordings
were not accessible
on-line.

process after the materials are
bar-coded, most likely within the
next two years. The Physics and
Engineering Libraries already
have automated check-out. This
procedure should make it easier
and more convenient for people to
check out items from the libraries,
Gozzi said.
"The RECON project is going
to have benefits not just for users,
but (for people who work in) vari
ous services at the library because
they can get access at any termi
nal," she said.
During the RECON project, the
records entered before 1987 were
updated, Gozzi said.
"Some records for titles were
very brief, particularly serials, and
so they were made fuller," she said.
Titles were first cataloged on
line in about 1972, said Mowen.
At the beginning of the project,
about 800,000 book titles, 52,000
serials, 20,000 musical scores, and
1,500 recordings were not accessi
ble on-line.
By 1987, 200,000 titles had been
entered on-line. Since then, 600,000
more titles have been entered after
a decision was made to complete the
cataloging by the end of 1992.

In order to pay for the conver
sion, the library system used its
own funds, receiving a $1,467 mil
lion grant from the provost and
obtaining grants from the U.S.
Dept. of Education, the State of
California (Library Services and
Construction Act funds) and the
National Endowment for the
Humanities, Gozzi said.
The project staff included five
full-time employees as well as

more than 200 Stanford students,
said Mowen.
"Most of the inputting was
done by students," he said. "We
couldn't have done it without
them. They were very impor
tant."
Gozzi said many of the full
time employees hired for the
duration of the project have elect
ed to stay at Stanford since the
project has ended.
