# Soaps: They're mushy, gushy, sleezy, cheezy, way too dramatic, far from didactic. And we love them.

"Who cares ? " you ask.
Thousands of soap fans at
Stanford, that's who. And that
includes professors, too.
In an intellectual enclave
where esoteric conversations
about Kierkegaard and quantum
mechanics spring up at the din
ner table between "pass the salt,"
the popularity of shows such as
"Days of Our Lives" and "All My
Children" might seem like an
anomaly.
Not so, says Prof. Marjorie
Perloff of the English depart
ment, who religiously watches
"The Young and the Restless"
every day at 11 a.m. and points
out that soaps can be a relaxing
contrast from abstract academia.
"They are the most perfect escape
mechanism," she said.
"Soap operas are the opposite
of everything we do," said PerlofT,
a noted intellectual and critic
who has written many books on
literary theory and modern art.
"There is nothing but plot: no
theme, (and] characters are not
as important. The plot moves for
ward in little increments of time,
so vou have to watch everv dav to

see what will happen to so-and-so
because of whatever they did in
the last episode."
Catching up with "so-and-so"
has become a campus pastime as
dozens of students can be found
huddled around a TV set during
lunchtime.
"I really do get caught up in
the action," said sophomore Keri
Holding. She said she watches
"Days of Our Lives," "The Young

and the Restless," and "All Mv
Children" at least twice a week.
"It's entertaining, and I know
what happens on the show will
never happen to me."
Even the most die-hard fans,
however, won't hesitate to dis
parage a soap's "cheesiness,"
which is central to its appeal.
"Soap operas are pretty stupid
and outrageous — it's fun to
watch them to make fun of them

selves as much as anything else,"
said senior Abby Williams, who
added that soaps aren't really to
be taken seriously.
"It's funny, it's like comedy, I
guess," said Matt Esslanger, a
freshman who tunes in to "All My
Children" regularly. For Ess
langer, watching the show has al
most become a family tradition.
