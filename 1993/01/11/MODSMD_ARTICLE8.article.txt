# Soaps: They're mushy, gushy, sleezy, cheezy, way too dramatic, far from didactic. And we love them.

Will Erica come out of her
coma if she hears Dmitri's voice?
Does Ryan really love Victoria
or is he in it for the money?
Will Marlena leave the new
Roman for the old Roman?
"Who cares ? " you ask.
Thousands of soap fans at
Stanford, that's who. And that
includes professors, too.
In an intellectual enclave
where esoteric conversations
about Kierkegaard and quantum
mechanics spring up at the din
ner table between "pass the salt,"
the popularity of shows such as
"Days of Our Lives" and "All My
Children" might seem like an
anomaly.
Not so, says Prof. Marjorie
Perloff of the English depart
ment, who religiously watches
"The Young and the Restless"
every day at 11 a.m. and points
out that soaps can be a relaxing
contrast from abstract academia.
"They are the most perfect escape
mechanism," she said.
"Soap operas are the opposite
of everything we do," said PerlofT,
a noted intellectual and critic
who has written many books on
literary theory and modern art.
"There is nothing but plot: no
theme, (and] characters are not
as important. The plot moves for
ward in little increments of time,
so vou have to watch everv dav to

see what will happen to so-and-so
because of whatever they did in
the last episode."
Catching up with "so-and-so"
has become a campus pastime as
dozens of students can be found
huddled around a TV set during
lunchtime.
"I really do get caught up in
the action," said sophomore Keri
Holding. She said she watches
"Days of Our Lives," "The Young

and the Restless," and "All Mv
Children" at least twice a week.
"It's entertaining, and I know
what happens on the show will
never happen to me."
Even the most die-hard fans,
however, won't hesitate to dis
parage a soap's "cheesiness,"
which is central to its appeal.
"Soap operas are pretty stupid
and outrageous — it's fun to
watch them to make fun of them

selves as much as anything else,"
said senior Abby Williams, who
added that soaps aren't really to
be taken seriously.
"It's funny, it's like comedy, I
guess," said Matt Esslanger, a
freshman who tunes in to "All My
Children" regularly. For Ess
langer, watching the show has al
most become a family tradition.

Perloff started watching soaps
years ago; she supposes she may
have been hooked sometime in
the mid-'7os when she was sick in
bed, watching TV. It was in 1975,
right after she was hooked on
"The Young and the Restless"
that she wrote an article for The
New Republic called "Soap Opera
Bubbles."
"The situations are unreal in
the fact that things happen that
wouldn't normally be believed, but
yet real enough so that people can

identify with them," PerlofTsaid.
She gave the example of Victo
ria Newman on "The Young and
the Restless," a rich girl who mar
ried a poor man. Victoria com
plains because they have no
money to buy Christmas presents,
so when her husband's former
girlfriend gives him some money,
he lies to Victoria and tells her
that he just got a new job and they
gave him a cash bonus right away.
The part about the lack of
money for Christmas presents
and the fact her husband lied is
the real part of this plot that peo
ple can identify with; people often
can't buy Christmas gifts, and
people do lie, says PerlofT.

"But no one in the 'real world'
would be likely to believe her hus
band's lie: cash bonuses are rarely
given out upon hiring. This unre
al element is an escape from the
real world for soap opera fans,"
said Perloff. "It is like the real
world in one way, but also totally
unrealistic."
Real or unreal, soap operas
have found their social niche,
weaving their way into conversa
tions and dorm-bonding.
"It's just a good break,"
Williams said. "Freshman year I
watched 'All My Children' with a
bunch of people, about 30. It was
so fun. To me, it's not as fun to
watch soaps alone. I never do."
