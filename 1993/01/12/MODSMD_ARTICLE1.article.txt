On Sundays, worshipers come to St.
Samuel's Church of God in Christ in
East Palo Alto to hear the words of
their minister and give thanks. But
early on Saturday mornings, doctors
and nurses from Stanford Hospital
hold a different kind of ministry — a
ministry of health.
Since the Stanford Area Rota Care
Clinic's start Nov. 10, hospital staff
members have come to East Palo Alto
weekly to provide free, no-questions
asked medical care. Funded by dona
tions from area Rotary Clubs and phar
maceutical companies, the doctors,
nurses and pharmacists work out of
the church's dining area.
"It's a very new program," said
Diana Diamond, special assistant to
the hospital president and coordinator
of the Rota Care program. "It's very re
warding. One of the first patients who
came had pneumonia and was home
less, and we were able to get her to a
hospital."
Urology Prof. Emeritus Duncan
Govan, the clinic's medical director,
said, "We're really kind of a lifeline for
people who are scared to go somewhere
else or don't have money."
The clinic is created by hanging blue
plastic curtains across the dining room,
forming three separate rooms. Blue
foam pads, covered with plastic, turn
the church's tables into examining sta

tions. Boxes of bandages and tongue
depressors line one wall, and the
pantry is converted into a pharmacy.
The volunteers come from a pool of
dozens of medical workers who donate
their time and talents, working on a ro
tating basis, Govan said. Each week the
clinic is staffed by one pediatrician, one
internist, a few nurses and a pharmacist.

Govan said the clinicians observe a
variety of ailments, including colds,
coughs, diabetes and parasitic infec
tions — "routine things you see in gen
eral practice. It's really kind of a triage
center."
If patients need more extensive
medical care than the clinic can pro
vide, they are referred elsewhere,

sometimes to the San Mateo County
Hospital or East Palo Alto's Drew Med
ical Clinic, and sometimes to Stanford
Hospital or Stanford Medical Center
clinics, all of which treat the patients
free of charge.
For example, Govan said, the chair
