# 'The greed of the '80s is over, and people are starting to care about other people'
## Community medicine 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
On Sundays, worshipers come to St.
Samuel's Church of God in Christ in
East Palo Alto to hear the words of
their minister and give thanks. But
early on Saturday mornings, doctors
and nurses from Stanford Hospital
hold a different kind of ministry — a
ministry of health.
Since the Stanford Area Rota Care
Clinic's start Nov. 10, hospital staff
members have come to East Palo Alto
weekly to provide free, no-questions
asked medical care. Funded by dona
tions from area Rotary Clubs and phar
maceutical companies, the doctors,
nurses and pharmacists work out of
the church's dining area.
"It's a very new program," said
Diana Diamond, special assistant to
the hospital president and coordinator
of the Rota Care program. "It's very re
warding. One of the first patients who
came had pneumonia and was home
less, and we were able to get her to a
hospital."
Urology Prof. Emeritus Duncan
Govan, the clinic's medical director,
said, "We're really kind of a lifeline for
people who are scared to go somewhere
else or don't have money."
The clinic is created by hanging blue
plastic curtains across the dining room,
forming three separate rooms. Blue
foam pads, covered with plastic, turn
the church's tables into examining sta

tions. Boxes of bandages and tongue
depressors line one wall, and the
pantry is converted into a pharmacy.
The volunteers come from a pool of
dozens of medical workers who donate
their time and talents, working on a ro
tating basis, Govan said. Each week the
clinic is staffed by one pediatrician, one
internist, a few nurses and a pharmacist.

Govan said the clinicians observe a
variety of ailments, including colds,
coughs, diabetes and parasitic infec
tions — "routine things you see in gen
eral practice. It's really kind of a triage
center."
If patients need more extensive
medical care than the clinic can pro
vide, they are referred elsewhere,

sometimes to the San Mateo County
Hospital or East Palo Alto's Drew Med
ical Clinic, and sometimes to Stanford
Hospital or Stanford Medical Center
clinics, all of which treat the patients
free of charge.
For example, Govan said, the chair

of Stanford's Ophthalmology
Department once examined four
patients Govan had sent to his
clinic free of charge.
Stanford Hospital pharmacist
Steve Miller, volunteering Satur
day at the church, said drug com
panies donate a fairly wide range
of somewhat modern, non-narcot
ic drugs for treatment. If he
doesn't have an appropriate drug,
he can send patients to a local
Walgreen pharmacy that honors
Rota Care's prescriptions and bills
the clinic later, he added.
Govan said the clinic serves
some patients who may be afraid
to go to Stanford Hospital or
other local clinics because of their
large size or for fear of being
asked financial questions.
"Some have been to Drew Clin
ic, but many have been nowhere,"
he said of the patients' previous
medical care. "We've had people
who have just come over the Mex
ican border and were lost."
Originally, the clinic was held
on Tuesday nights, but few
patients ventured to the clinic in
the dark. Since moving to Satur
day mornings, attendance has
picked up some, but is still slow.
"It's pretty slow going, but
that's not unexpected," Govan
said. "We'll keep coming as long
as they're coming."
Currently, Govan said, doctors
see about eight patients per week
— twice the number seen during
the first few weeks.
Before the clinic opened, "I
think that some of them just

didn't get medical attention,"
Diamond agreed.
One of the patients at the clin
ic Saturday was East Palo Alto
resident Jessica Anderson's son
Mattias, who had a hearing block
age. Anderson said it was her first
trip to the clinic, adding that the
service is a boon.
"Since I'm uninsured, and rather
low-income, it helps a lot," she said
after Stanford pediatrician Kim
Harvey had treated Mattias.
Before the clinic started, Ander
son said she usually didn't seek
help for medical problems except
emergencies.
If Rota Care hadn't treated
Mattias' hearing, she said, "I
would have tried to deal with it, or
probably have ended up waiting
until this was urgent care."
And volunteers at the clinic
said they find it as rewarding as
the patients consider it useful.
"I came here because when I
moved to the Bay Area, less than
two years ago, I became aware of
the homeless and immigrant popu
lations," said Theresa Dendinger,
a licensed vocational nurse in the
Medical Center's urology clinic.
"This is my way to help them . . .
this is my way to do something for
the community," she continued.
"Something has happened in
the '905," Diamond said. "The
greed of the '80s is over, and peo
ple are starting to care about
other people."
According to Diamond, the
Stanford Area Rota Care clinic is
the fifth Rota Care clinic. All have
been funded by Rotary Clubs and
located in the Bay Area.
Diamond said she got the idea
for the clinic from Kenneth Gra
ham, president of the St. Louise

Hospital in Gilroy, who started
the first clinic.
"When he proposed the idea, I
said 'Gee, that sounds really neat,'
and about a second later, I was put
in charge," Diamond remembered.
But, she added, it's a job she enjoys
having.
The clinic has received about
$8,000 in donations from local
Rotary Clubs, much of which will
go toward malpractice insurance
for the clinic. Currently the hospi
tal covers the insurance.
Once the clinic gets insured,
she said, doctors from places
other than the hospital will also
volunteer at the clinic.
Diamond said she envisions
the Rota Care system expanding
across the country, and said she
has already received a call from
one New York Rotary Club inter
ested in starting a similar clinic.
"It's a marvelous marriage
between Rotary Clubs and the
medical profession," she said.
Doctors say they are expecting
the number of patients at the East
Palo Alto clinic to increase, too.
"I saw a lady with a skin rash
... she's homeless ... and doesn't
really have any way to keep her
hands clean," said anesthesiologist
Richard Novak, who was volun
teering at the clinic Saturday.
"She's really not all that ill, but she
comes here, she tells some friends,
and maybe she'll come back when
she's really sick," he said.
"My guess is by the time sum
mer comes around, and word of
mouth spreads, it will get busier,"
Novak added.
Being busier would be just fine
with Govan. "The busier you are,
the better it is," he said. "You get
turned on by helping people."
