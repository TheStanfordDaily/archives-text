# Seminar bridges departmental gaps
## Course on facism first to be listed in four humanities departments 
### Cathy Siciliano 
Profs. Jeffrey Schnapp, Sepp Gum
brecht and Timothy Lenoir have taught
seminars involving two or three differ
ent fields, but until this quarter, never a
course that was listed in four different
departments.
The seminar "Technological and Ide
ological Incubations of Fascism" is the
first seminar in the humanities that
incorporates at least four different disci
plines — in this case, French, Italian,
Comparative Literature and History of
Science, said Schnapp, vice chair of the
French and Italian Department.
"The course is an unusual situation
that brings together so many disci
plines," he said.
Schnapp, French Prof. Gumbrecht

and Assoc. History of Science Prof.
Lenoir teamed up this quarter to teach
the seminar. Thirty graduate students
in French, Italian, Comparative Litera
ture, Spanish and the History of Science
attended the first meeting last week.
"The point of the seminar is not
about the devastating consequences of
fascism," which would be taken for
granted in a graduate seminar, Gum
brecht said.
Instead, the seminar examines the pre
fascist era, covering events such as the
ater performance, mass spectacles and
pop culture from 1900 to the 1920s and
connects them to later fascist movements.
Students will discuss nine topic areas
during the first four weeks of the quar
ter and will present their own research
projects during the remaining weeks.

Working in conjunction with the
Hoover Archives, students will search
through journals, films, posters and
other items such as Lenin's private
diary as the basis for their projects.
Schnapp said the Hoover Archives con
tain one of the best collections about
pre-fascist movements.
Schnapp said he hopes the class will
give students ideas for research projects
and dissertations or instigate research
in areas of interest.
The three professors themselves hope
to gain from the seminar. Schnapp said
his goal is to be exposed to different dia
logues that pertain to his own research.
He added that he views the seminar as
an "opportunity to engage in dialogue
and work with other disciplines and per
spectives."
