## U.S. Marines capture illegal Somali arms 
### 
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) - In the
largest U.S. military operation so far in
Mogadishu, 900 U.S. Marines swept
through the country's biggest arms bazaar
yesterday and seized weapons ranging
from anti-aircraft guns to assault rifles.
The raid indicated the mission of U.S.
forces was changing from guarding food
shipments from bandits to also seizing
weapons, as U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali had requested.
The Marines moved unopposed into
the core of the fetid Bakara bazaar with
their weapons ready to fire.
In another attempt to improve security
Marines hope to double their daily patrols
over the next few days, said Col. Michael
Hagee, a spokesman for U.S. forces.
Mogadishu was mostly peaceful yester
day, the day a cease-fire agreed to by Soma

lia's 14 warring factions was to take effect.
"A month ago they were in full-scale
civil war. There's been a considerable
improvement," said U.S. envoy Robert
Oakley.
In the day-long raid, dubbed "Opera
tion Nutcracker," the Marines seized
recoilless rifles, anti-aircraft guns and a
mix of light weapons, Hagee said.
Some Somalis protested yesterday's
arms raid. They say they will become
easy prey for the gangs who roam this
city if weapons they use for self-protec
tion are taken away.
But many in Mogadishu say only total
disarmament will restore peace. "People
are coming up to us to give us informa
tion. They give us the thumbs up sign,
they're clapping when we come in,"
Hagee said.
