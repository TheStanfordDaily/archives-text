# Another Iraqi act of defiance
## U.N. condemns raids on Kuwait 
### 
KUWAIT CITY (AP) - Scores of
Iraqis crossed into Kuwait again yester
day and carted ofT equipment from a dis
puted naval base, the second border
foray in 24 hours to underscore Saddam
Hussein's defiance of President Bush
and his allies.
The U.N. Security Council late yester
day condemned Iraq's raids and demand
ed the return of four Silkworm missiles.
The 15-nation council issued only a
vague warning of "serious conse
quences."
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali earlier said he hoped the
council would issue "a very stiff answer."
Iraq's U.N. ambassador argued that
U.N. officials gave permission for yester
day's action and another expedition Sun
day, when about 200 armed Iraqis
removed weapons, including four Silk
worm anti-ship misrlles abandoned by
defeated troops in the Persian Gulf War.
A U.N. spokesman, Abdel Latif Kab
baj, said Iraq had permission to remove

only non-military equipment by Friday.
He said Iraqis violated the agreement.
On Sunday, an Iraqi held a pistol to
the head of an unarmed Canadian peace
keeper who tried to block the road with
his car, Canada's ambassador to Kuwait
said.
"I think his immediate response was
to remove the vehicle," said Ambassador-
Christopher Poole. Poole characterized
the incident as more a dispute over assets
than an invasion across the border.
"It hasn't resulted in a great mood of
pessimism, fortunately, here in Kuwait â€”
neither among the Kuwaiti community
nor the expatriate community," he said.
The forays followed Hussein's appar
ent capitulation to a demand to remove
anti-aircraft missiles from southern
Iraq, where U.S. and allied planes have
patrolled since August to prevent Iraqi
air attacks on Shiite Muslim rebels.
But even while it was backing down
on the missiles, Iraq made the border
crossings and banned U.N. flights to and

over Iraq, a restriction that hampers
U.N. efforts to dismantle Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction.
"It's clear from this raid into Kuwait
that Saddam Hussein is continuing his
pattern of trying to cheat wherever pos
sible, continuing to challenge the U.N.
resolutions," said Marlin Fitzwater, the
chief White House spokesman.
He repeated that the United States
was ready to act "without warning" to
force Baghdad back into compliance.
Hussein might be trying to provoke a
crisis to divert domestic attention from
Iraq's problems. U.N. trade sanctions
imposed on Iraq after its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait have caused severe
food shortages and rampant inflation.
Renewed hostilities also could divide
the U.S.-led coalition that drove the
Iraqis from Kuwait. Arab participants in
that force appear unwilling to take part
in a military action that might further
weaken Iraq, which is seen as a bulwark
against a rearming Iran.
