# Supreme Court rejects free-press arguments in two cases
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Supreme Court yes
terday rejected free-press arguments in two closely
watched cases, including one that might put Soldier
of Fortune magazine out of business.
The court, without comment, let stand a $4.3 mil
lion judgment against Soldier of Fortune. A federal
jury said the magazine negligently contributed to
Richard Braun's 1985.
Lefty Wilson, director of operations for the maga
zine, said yesterday, "We're exploring our options

and hopefully we'll be able to enter negotiations
with the plaintiffs. The judgment stands at $4.3 mil
lion. Obviously, we can't pay that."
Wilson said Soldier of Fortune publisher Robert
Brown would consider handing over the magazine to
satisfy part of the judgment, but only as a last
resort.
The high court has never ruled on the exact pub
lisher-liability issue the case presented.
Soldier of Fortune was sued by Braun's two sons

because the magazine's June 1985 edition included
a personal ad in which Michael Savage offered his
services as a "GUN FOR HIRE."
Bruce Gastwirth, Braun's partner, responded to
Savage's ad. On Aug. 26, 1985, Savage and two other
men went to Braun's homeand killed him. Savage
and the others involved in the murder plot were
caught, convicted and imprisoned.
Upholding the $4.3 million award, the 11th Cir
cuit court said the ad presented a "clearly identifi

able unreasonable risk . . . (of) a violent crime."
In a second case, the court turned down the
appeal of a former newspaper reporter facing 30
days in jail for refusing to divulge the identity of the
source who provided him information which is
secret under Florida law.
Tim Roche, was cited for "indirect criminal con
tempt" after including in a news story 54 words
from a state judge's sealed order. Roche refused to
say who gave him a copy of the judge's order.
