GENEVA (AP) — Bosnia's
Serb leader dropped demands
yesterday for a separate state in a
concession coinciding with the
first appearance at peace talks by
hard-line Serbian President Slo
bodan Milosevic.
Radovan Karadzic's decision
could pave the way for a power
sharing pact between Bosnia's
Serbs, Muslims and Croats, who
have battled for 10 months in a
civil war that has claimed at least
17,000 lives.
Milosevic also appeared willing
to consider peace jjans by envoys
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.

Mediators trying to end the
conflict have insisted the Serb
side give up their core demand for
an enclave in the former
Yugoslav republic.
Under a peace plan prepared
by Vance and Lord Owen, the
republic would be divided into 10
provinces along ethnic lines.
Bosnian Serbs have rejected that
proposal in the past.
Karadzic said Bosnia's division
into 10 provinces was acceptable.
"We would . . . sign that we do
not want secession," he said.
"What we cannot accept is that
we will not be able to maintain

ties and contacts . . . with neigh
boring and distant nations. What
we can't give up is our own iden
tity and personality."
Milosevic has given his tenta
tive support for the mediators'
plan.
On arrival for his first peace
talk appearance, he said the
mediators' peace plan "can serve
as a base for negotiations."
The mediators' spokesman,
Fred Eckhard, said, "There is an
atmosphere developing that gives
the sense that further discus
sions could be productive, could
put us over the top."
