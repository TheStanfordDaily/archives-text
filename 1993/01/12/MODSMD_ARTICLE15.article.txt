No middle class tax cut
WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Clin
ton's choice for budget director all but buried
hopes for any quick middle-class tax cut yesterday
and warned that Americans should be prepared
for sacrifice in the fight against the deficit.
Rep. Leon Panetta, testifying at his Senate con
firmation hearing, said "everything is on the
table" in the search for ways to reduce a federal
deficit that could reach $500 billion early in the
next decade without action.
Panetta said that tax increases would have to
be a part of any deficit reduction package. He did
not endorse anything beyond Clinton's proposal

to boost the top rate on the wealthy but said a
wide range of new taxes should be examined.
Christopher under scrutiny
WASHINGTON (AP) — A Senate committee
launched an inquiry yesterday into Secretary of
State-designate Warren Christopher's statements
15 years ago to Congress that he didn't know the
Army spied on civil rights and anti-war protesters.
The action by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee came after The Associated Press
reported that Christopher's personal files indicate
he was informed in 1968 that the Army was con
ducting surveillance on civilians.
