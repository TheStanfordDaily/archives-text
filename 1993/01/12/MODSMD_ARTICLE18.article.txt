Boycott of Colorado
represents a positive
reaction to prejudice

ON NOV 3, COLORADO vot
ers approved by a 53-47 per
cent margin an amendment
to the state constitution which has
essentially codified bigotry.
Amendment Two repeals antidis
crimination laws passed by the cit
izens of Boulder, Aspen and Den
ver and prohibits enactment of
laws protecting the rights of homo
sexuals in the future.
In response, groups supporting
gay, lesbian and bisexual rights have
urged an economic boycott. The
boycott has been a success, and
those who are supporting it should
be applauded.
In one very long sentence, the
amendment states that no govern
ment entity shall afford to gays "any
minority status, quota preferences,
protected status or claim of discrimi
nation." Hysterical political rhetoric
encouraged voters to vote against
"quotas" which never existed.
Of course, the key words of the
amendment are "claim of discrimi
nation." Under Amendment Two,
any individual who was fired,
denied housing, expelled from
school or harassed on the grounds
of sexual orientation has no statuto
ry recourse.
Why did 53 percent of Colorado
voters endorse this law? Perhaps
they did not understand it. Perhaps
they truly Believed that gays seek
"special rights." Or perhaps they
understood it fully and wish to do
anything they can to make the lives
of gay people difficult.
Whatever motives the voters
might have had, the fact is that this
law dramatically limits the civil
rights of at least 10 percent of the
population of Colorado.
Colorado is a curious place to
earn the title of "the hate state." It
has produced progressive political
leaders like Congresswoman Patri

cia Schroeder and Federico Pena.
The state has a well-earned reputa
tion for environmental protection.
If the impact of Amendment Two
was limited to Colorado, it might be
sensible to allow Colorado's legisla
tive and judicial process to overcome
it. But the impact of this kind of leg
islation will not be limited to the
state. The so-called Christian Coali
tion which led the drive for Amend
ment Two used out-of-state funding
and solicitors to collect signatures to
put the measure on the ballot, and
they have plans to urge similar leg
islation in a number of other states,
including California.
It is understandable that the
business community and elected
officials of Colorado are concerned
about the boycott. So far, it has cost
the state $11 million, primarily in
lost convention business.
And convention organizers tend
to be associations or government
bodies which are more accountable
than private companies for how
they spend their money.
The example of Arizona looms
large. When that state rescinded the
holiday named for Martin Luther
King, Jr. tens of millions of dollars
from sports games, conventions and
business dried up. Eventually, vot
ers changed their minds.
Opponents of a boycott argue
that it would be counterproductive.
They point out that withdrawal of
tourist and convention business will
most directly hurt progressive areas
like Denver and Aspen. Further
more, it would be especially ironic
for areas like Aspen to lose skiing
business to their far more conserva
tive neighbor, Utah.
It would be preferable to target
this kind of economic protest,
toward those voters who feel that
trampling the civil rights of part of
the population is morally acceptable
behavior. Unfortunately, this is
impossible.
An economic boycott of Colorado
will signal that political decisions
have consequences â€” and it will be
a lesson not just for Coloradans but
for others who may wish to use the
law to codify their prejudices.
