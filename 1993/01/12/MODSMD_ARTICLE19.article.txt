Author of letter complains of headline, Daily politics

BY MEANS OF THE headline
appended to my letter of Jan. 8
("Sec Gen of UN, others deemed
imfit graduation speakers"), regarding
selection of a commencement speaker,
The Daily editors managed to complete
ly distort the overall tenor of the piece.
I was quite transparently attempting
to critique primarily a mind-set and a
methodology, not an enumeration of
particular individual candidates per se.
â€¢ In fact, I specifically acknowledged
that some of the names included in the
priginal list of Jan. 6, (which I inferred
were culled from the editors' teevee [sic]
Yiewings) clearly did represent, perhaps
by chance, potential meritorious selec
tions.
* I certainly would include the

esteemed U.N. Secretary-General in
this category. If The Daily editors had
wished to critique the substantive
aspects of my original letter, they
should have done so explicitly in a sepa
rate letter, not by subliminally under
mining the intent and meaning of my
own article by means of their deceptive
headline.
This is unfortunately not an isolated
occurrence, but rather is reflective of
the kind of biased journalism that this
paper has come to represent. Over the
years, the editorial component of The
Daily has transformed itself from a sta
tus of national acclaim rooted in
unquestioned integrity and reasonable
even-handedness, to that of a compara
tive rag consumed with pandering to

liberal special-interest groups.
I challenge the leaders of The Daily
to actively seek out staff members and
contributors who will both adhere to
the highest standards of journalism,
and lend a more balanced editorial
viewpoint (without fear of the atten
dant harassment evidenced here,
which no doubt has dissuaded others
from criticizing this publication).
As to the subsidiary issue of my per
haps misguided attempt at humor,
which June Cohen chose to target in
her Jan. 11 editorial as the focal point
of my original letter after receiving the
complaint discussed above (undoubted
ly to deflect attention from the central
issue), I agree that I probably should
not have made the off-handed refer-

ence to the students of Chico State
(though I wonder if she would have
approved of my citing Berkeley
instead).
In any case, I was not placing Chico
students below those at Stanford, at
least not The Daily editors, but rather
in exactly the same category.
Those who know me well would
hardly characterize me as elitist, espe
cially in the context of this particular
community. I am however happy for
Cohen that she had the opportunity to
clearly solidify her own "non-elitist"
credentials via her summer experience
