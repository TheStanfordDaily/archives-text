# Profs. shake up aftershock assumptions

Two Stanford geophysicists have
devised a new theory based on data
gathered during the 1989 Loma Pri
eta earthquake that contradicts long
held assumptions about aftershocks.
Profs. Mark Zoback and Gregory
Beroza argue that the data obtained
during the 1989 temblor, which are
more detailed than for many previous
ones, show remarkable deviation
from known aftershock behavior.
The contemporary rationale ex
plains an aftershock as a slip in a near
by fault caused by a build-up of stress

from the preceding earthquake. In an
aftershock, the fault should move in
the same direction as in the initial
earthquake.
But Zoback and Beroza found that
instead of the aftershocks following in
the direction of the initial earth
quake, they moved in varying direc
tions. "Current models of seismic be
havior couldn't explain the Loma Pri
eta aftershocks any better than a ran
dom computer simulation," said
Zoback, chair of the Geophysics De
partment.
Zoback said his and Beroza's new
theory can accurately explain up to 87

percent of the aftershocks. He likened
their model of aftershocks to slipping on
a banana peel. Adding a force to the ba
nana peel causes one to slip and fall, but
the direction one falls depends on the
ground underneath the banana peel.
Similarly, when an earthquake
puts a force on the aftershock fault,
the direction it moves depends not on
the direction of the force but on the
pre-existing contours of the fault
plane itself, he said.
Zoback further explained this idea
with an analogy to the breaking of a
pencil. "You bend a pencil to the point
just before it breaks. Then instead of

adding more stress to the pencil to
break it, the pencil becomes struc
turally weaker and then the pre-exist
ing pressure breaks the weakened
pencil," Zoback said.
Similarly, the original earthquake
does not put any more pressure on the
aftershock fault but merely weakens
its structural integrity; for example,
cracks may begin to propagate. Con
sequently, the fault slips under its
pre-existing stress in whichever direc
tion its contours dictate.
This process may occur through
the water that fills faults deep
within the earth. Seepage of
water into the cracks of the
fault's rock lining make it more
susceptible to water pressure.
The shaking of the initial earth
quake compresses the walls of
the fault, increasing the water
pressure, Zoback said.
When the water pressure
inside the fault increases, the
fault weakens and slippage
occurs, registering an aftershock,
he added.
Zoback and Beroza are cur
rently looking at other earth
quake data to find correlations
with this theory and ultimately
gain more insight into predicting
earthquakes of large magnitude.
