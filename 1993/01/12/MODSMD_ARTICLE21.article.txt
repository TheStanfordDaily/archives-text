## The 						writing on the wall 
### 
EVERY WEDNESDAY AND Sunday
evening last quarter found me
working at the Cubberly Education
Library. And while shelving books wasn't
exactly the highlight of my week, I did
discover a secret fascination on my trips
to the bathroom.
There, on the wall of the badly-lit sec
ond floor stall, I watched a saga grow.
"Women who seek equality" was the
first phrase I noticed.
"will always be seeking something,"
someone else continued.
"unless they meet violence with vio
lence" (through this someone had writ
ten "NUTZ" in purple.)
"Unless they seek a new world order
first."
"Unless they do something about it!"
This was no ordinary bathroom graffiti.
From this exchange was an arrow
drawn to "Discover your femininity."
"What the hell does that mean?"
"Femininity is a category created by a
capitalist patriarchy. Females can be vio
lent, as men can be nurturing. The point
is to transcend sexual and gender bound
aries. .
And on and on, for all to read, is dis
played a gush of inks and scribbles that
argues and agrees about sexuality, reli
gion, humanity and the self — with sparks
of anger, cynicism and optimism. All in all,
it's a pretty inspiring place to pee.
But it also made me wonder what it is

about anonymity that released the hon
esty of these women in this unexpected
place. Why aren't they columnists for
The Daily? Obviously, they have some
thing to say.
When I applied to be a columnist back in
September, I had no idea that the pool
would consist of over 40 men and three
women — a fascinating disparity. Where
were all those articulate women I had lis
tened to in class and wished I could be like?
I never intended to write from a
"woman's" viewpoint. I planned to write
from my individual experience.
And I didn't expect reactions, but they
came. Of course there were critical letters
iipTheT)aity, which I hid from and even
tually parted on my kitchen wall to
desensitize myself to. Mean whispers to
my sister at a party.
A few friends have told me they think
I'm brave. People have written or called
to say they like my style. An offer of free
beer at The Goose. Arid how amazing to
have a professor write me a note about
how she found something I said mean
ingful, or another tell me that I raised a
really difficult and interesting question.
I've heard my ideas making a differ
ence. But even with all the agreement
I've found for my positions, it's impossi
ble to expect that I could possibly be the
voice for half this campus, as many peo
ple tell me I am now. "Woman" isn't
an indicator of some monolithic set of

viewpoints, and to consider me only as a
"representative of females" is to discount
my own individuality. The fact that I can
be labelled Big Feminist On Campus
shows how desperately we need more
exposure to women's opinions..
It's scary to put your soul on a piece of
paper and wait for someone to rip it up,
and frustrating when you don't have
enough time to work through what you
want to say.
But putting your face behind your
words is a strengthening experience; it
means taking credit — whether that
means praise or criticism. My ability to fill
this space every Tuesday has become
inseparable, really, from the challenge to
claim some patch for myself in the nulli
fying vastness of time, big words and
power struggles.
Someday I might be able to do it with
out the distance of paper between my
ideas and the people I want to tell them to.
I hope other women will be able to do it
without a fortress built of bathroom walls.

Andrea is sorely disappointed in the bath
rooms of Zuni, New Mexico, where she
will be for the rest of the quarter. Her col
umn appears here Tuesdays.
