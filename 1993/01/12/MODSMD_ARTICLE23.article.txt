## Cardinal gets Irish treat in rare midweek showdown Notre Dame in town as cagers get one day rest before Cal contest 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
A Stan ford-Notre Dame matchup is
always attractive. However, this one
comes at a most inopportune time for
the Cardinal.
It is not that Stanford will not be able
to compete with the Fighting Irish.
Rather, this extra midweek nonconfer
ence game takes away preparation time
for Thursday night's more important
Pacific 10 Conference matchup with
California at Berkeley.
"There's no question that this affects
our preparation," coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "The Cal game was origi
nally scheduled for Saturday, so we
scheduled Notre Dame for Tuesday. But
then ESPN changed the (Cal) game to
Thursday. We tried not to play it then,
but since it is Cal's home game they
decided to play it."
Every team in the Pac-10 has two
"one" weeks during the season, where
by the only conference game they play
during that week is against their rival.
That "one" week is usually the time
that Pac-10 schools try to schedule
other traditional nonconference rival
ries or attractive games to keep their
teams active. Notre Dame, as an inde
pendent, typically likes to stack its
schedule during the months of January
and February.
Stanford (6-7) scheduled Notre
Dame with the idea that the team would
still have three days to prepare for Cal.
Instead, the team will have only one day
to prepare.
And what of Notre Dame? The Cardi
nal coaching staff knew that tonight's
game was not going to be easy when
they scheduled it.
The Irish (6-5) are a solid team
despite the loss of starters LaPhonso
Ellis, Elmer Bennett, Daimon Sweet
and Keith Tower from last year's squad.

They're a good basket
ball team. But if we can
play with the kind of
heart that we have lately,
we have an excellent
chance to win.'
— Mike Montgomery

Notre Dame is led by Monty Williams, a
6-foot-8 senior forward who is averag
ing 18.3 points and 10.3 rebounds per
game.
The Irish are fortunate to have
Williams back. He has sat out the last
two seasons with a diagnosis of hyper
trophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which
involves a thickened muscle between
the chambers of the heart. After under
going extensive testing at the National
Institute of Health in Bethesda, Md.,
this summer, the doctors determined
that the potentially dangerous condi
tion was not severe enough that playing
basketball would pose a threat to his
health. Now, Williams poses a threat to
Irish opponents.
"He's a very good player," Mont
gomery said. "He's a three-man (small
forward) playing four-man (power for
ward), so he gives you matchup prob
lems."
In reserve for Notre Dame, fresh
man guard Ryan Hoover is a dangerous
outside shooter. Against Dayton, he
came off the bench to make seven
three-pointers, and is shooting at a
45.7 percent clip from long range for
the season.
Notre Dame has played a difficult
schedule thus far, and has played

impressively against formidable oppo
nents. Notre Dame beat Dayton 71-66
in South Bend, Ind., last Saturday, and
earlier in the year defeated Boston Col
lege. The Irish have also lost narrowly
to sixth-ranked Indiana and USC. But
the Irish have had some down days,
including a recent 24-point loss to
Detroit Mercy.
"They're a good basketball team,"
Montgomery said. "But if we can play
with the kind of heart that we have late
ly, we have an excellent chance to win."
Cardinal Notes
Tip off for tonight's game in Maples
Pavilion is at 7:30 p.m. . .Football wide
receiver Justin Armour practiced for
the first time yesterday. He worked at
the power forward spot in practice, and
will be suited up tonight. He will wear
jersey number 34. . . Armour said he
enjoyed his first practice: "I liked it. It
was fun. I felt pretty out of control and
pretty clumsy. But the guys were super
helpful and helped me learn (the sys
tem).". . . Armour should be ready to
play in a few weeks. Said Montgomery:
"He provides another body for prac
tice. He just wants to come out and
help the team. He's a good athlete, and
he's got a good attitude, and in a
month from now, we'll see what hap
pens."
