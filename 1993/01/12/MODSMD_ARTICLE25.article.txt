# Stanford men's hoops needs support while picking up pieces
## 
### 
The sports world might be the place
where reality and fantasy enjoy
their closest marriage. We watch
with awe and excitement as the likes of
George Brett, Michael Jordan, Joe Mon
tana and Wayne Gretzky perform feats
about which we "mortals" can only dream.
Subconsciously, we also keep running
tabs, comparing the best and brightest of
today with the all-time greats; this is
what helps us keep our interest in spite of
the increasingly persistent and wide
ranging problems that loom over athlet
ics at every level.
It might be easier, then, for a sports
fan to cross over the sometimes-blurred
line between cold, hard reality and idyllic
fantasy than it would be for, say, an avid
follower of politics or business. Some
times, though, a little make-believe can
be both necessary and helpful: long-suf
fering Chicago Cubs faithful, none of
whom under the age of 90 would be able
to recall their team's last World Series
championship in 1908, have gone
through nearly four generations of
"woulda, shoulda, coulda;" Seattle
Mariner backers can look back fondly to
1991, the young franchise's only season
above .500, and to the subsequent firing
of manager Bill Plu— maybe that was a
bad example.
No matter what the sport or team or
degree of current success, however, fans
have a natural inclination to relate the

present and future to the past, be it
recent experience or legends liriit heard
while still in the crib.
Which brings me to the 1992-93 Stan
ford Cardinal men's basketball team.
Folks, it's time to wake up.
It seems as if everywhere I turn these
days — print, radio, and television media
and everyday conversations with friends
— the names "Adam Keefe" and, depend
ing on the Stanford tenure of the person
to whom I'm talking, "Todd Lichti" come
up when referring to the Cardinal's
progress this season.
I know what year this is, and — not to
sound "snotty" or anything — I am
aware of the average intelligence of the
Stanford community. And I know some
thing else, something that I can state
with all confidence: that neither Adam
Keefe nor Todd Lichti will ever again don
a Cardinal uniform.
This might come as a shock to some
people, but I invite all doubters to check
any evening sports cast featuring NBA
highlights: Keefe, a rookie for the Atlanta
Hawks, will usually be the one you can
make out in the background admiring
teammate Dominique Wilkins' "monster
jams," while Lichti, a fourth-year player
for the Denver Nuggets, may be seen as
the only player outside Dikembe
Mutombo and Chris Jackson to put any
points on the board for that rebuilding
organization.

With that ugly bit of business out of
the.way, then, it's time to give our men's
basketball team the credit it deserves.
After all, the players work hard for their
scholarships, and to put forth their best
efforts (most of which, by the way, are
outstanding) come gametime. Also, along
with football, men's basketball is the
bread-and-butter of any Athletics
Department; if you don't believe me, ask
Ted Leland.
Keep in mind, I am not being ridicu
lous in my praise of the Cardinal cagers. I
do not profess that this year's team, with
its 6-7 record, is going to set the Pacific
10 Conference on fire for the remainder
of the regular season, earn a spot in the
NCAA Tournament, and make a run at
the Final Four. I realize that, unlike its
female counterpart, Stanford's men's
team does not figure to be the next Duke
in the near future (Although I would
wager that we, too, could lose to Georgia
Tech.). I'm not even promising that the
squad will win more than 10 or 12 games
by season's end.
What I am saying is that the last four
years are just that. Four consecutive post
season appearances, two invitations to the
"Big Dance," one NIT championship — all
are part of Stanford basketball's proud
tradition and hence a part of the past.
This is now.
I attended last Saturday's victory over
Oregon at Maples Pavilion, a win that

earned the Cardinal a .500 conference
record, but only 3,353 other people were
on hand in a building that holds 7,500.
Pretty pathetic, considering that it was a
Saturday night (This is Stanford, what
else could you possibly have planned?) and
that it was the first weekend of the quar
ter. If there are that many empty seats for
a favored team's first weekend conference
home game, there could be more plastic
visible at that squad's midweek contests
than there is at a department store the
weekend before Christmas.
Maybe people forgot to pick up a
handy-dandy pocket schedule at the
sports marketing table when they attend
ed all those women's volleyball and pre
season women's basketball games before
Winter Break. Maybe they thought that
when they didn't see men's basketball on
the football ticket order form they
returned the first day they received it in
the mail last August (A handful of gener
ous companies are letting the student

body into the games free this season),
that for some reason the "Keefe-less"
program had been dropped.
Au contraire, mi amigos. Basketball is
alive and well and here to stay, as 292
other Division I schools can well attest.
Legends often have trouble leaving to
their successors every ingredient that
contributed to their own prowess, often
because of the cult of personality that
develops around such figures — but their
successors are often able to hold their
own. Reagan had Bush. Cronkite had
Rather. Carson had Leno. Keefe and
Lichti have Brent Williams, Marcus Lol
lie, Peter Dukes and their teammates.
It's hard cleaning up after a magnificent
parade, but we shouldn't hold that
against those who are eminently quali
fied to try.
So stop living in the past. Your first
chance for personal vindication by hoops
coach Mike Montgomery will be tonight's
contest Pgainst Notre Dame (Yes, it's the
same school to which we administered its
only football loss of 1992, not the cheap
imitation from Menlo Park).
And remember, it could be a lot worse.
You could be a Dallas Mavericks fan.

Andy Eiser, one of the Daily's crestfallen
sports editors, hopes this weekend's NFL
"road warriors," Dallas and Buffalo, get
the better of last weekend's party-poopers.
Beware the Chargers and Redskins in '93!

returned the first day they received it in
the mail last August (A handful of gener

body into the games free this season),
that for some reason the "Keefe-less"
program had been dropped.
Au contraire, mi amigos. Basketball is
alive and well and here to stay, as 292
other Division I schools can well attest.
Legends often have trouble leaving to
their successors every ingredient that
contributed to their own prowess, often
because of the cult of personality that
develops around such figures — but their
successors are often able to hold their
own. Reagan had Bush. Cronkite had
Rather. Carson had Leno. Keefe and
Lichti have Brent Williams, Marcus Lol
lie, Peter Dukes and their teammates.
It's hard cleaning up after a magnificent
parade, but we shouldn't hold that
against those who are eminently quali
fied to try.
So stop living in the past. Your first
chance for personal vindication by hoops
coach Mike Montgomery will be tonight's
contest Pgainst Notre Dame (Yes, it's the
same school to which we administered its
only football loss of 1992, not the cheap
imitation from Menlo Park).
And remember, it could be a lot worse.
You could be a Dallas Mavericks fan.

Andy Eiser, one of the Daily's crestfallen
sports editors, hopes this weekend's NFL
"road warriors," Dallas and Buffalo, get
the better of last weekend's party-poopers.
Beware the Chargers and Redskins in '93!

The sports world might be the place
where reality and fantasy enjoy
their closest marriage. We watch
with awe and excitement as the likes of
George Brett, Michael Jordan, Joe Mon
tana and Wayne Gretzky perform feats
about which we "mortals" can only dream.
Subconsciously, we also keep running
tabs, comparing the best and brightest of
today with the all-time greats; this is
what helps us keep our interest in spite of
the increasingly persistent and wide
ranging problems that loom over athlet
ics at every level.
It might be easier, then, for a sports
fan to cross over the sometimes-blurred
line between cold, hard reality and idyllic
fantasy than it would be for, say, an avid
follower of politics or business. Some
times, though, a little make-believe can
be both necessary and helpful: long-suf
fering Chicago Cubs faithful, none of
whom under the age of 90 would be able
to recall their team's last World Series
championship in 1908, have gone
through nearly four generations of
"woulda, shoulda, coulda;" Seattle
Mariner backers can look back fondly to
1991, the young franchise's only season
above .500, and to the subsequent firing
of manager Bill Plu— maybe that was a
bad example.
No matter what the sport or team or
degree of current success, however, fans
have a natural inclination to relate the

present and future to the past, be it
recent experience or legends liriit heard
while still in the crib.
Which brings me to the 1992-93 Stan
ford Cardinal men's basketball team.
Folks, it's time to wake up.
It seems as if everywhere I turn these
days — print, radio, and television media
and everyday conversations with friends
— the names "Adam Keefe" and, depend
ing on the Stanford tenure of the person
to whom I'm talking, "Todd Lichti" come
up when referring to the Cardinal's
progress this season.
I know what year this is, and — not to
sound "snotty" or anything — I am
aware of the average intelligence of the
Stanford community. And I know some
thing else, something that I can state
with all confidence: that neither Adam
Keefe nor Todd Lichti will ever again don
a Cardinal uniform.
This might come as a shock to some
people, but I invite all doubters to check
any evening sports cast featuring NBA
highlights: Keefe, a rookie for the Atlanta
Hawks, will usually be the one you can
make out in the background admiring
teammate Dominique Wilkins' "monster
jams," while Lichti, a fourth-year player
for the Denver Nuggets, may be seen as
the only player outside Dikembe
Mutombo and Chris Jackson to put any
points on the board for that rebuilding
organization.

With that ugly bit of business out of
the.way, then, it's time to give our men's
basketball team the credit it deserves.
After all, the players work hard for their
scholarships, and to put forth their best
efforts (most of which, by the way, are
outstanding) come gametime. Also, along
with football, men's basketball is the
bread-and-butter of any Athletics
Department; if you don't believe me, ask
Ted Leland.
Keep in mind, I am not being ridicu
lous in my praise of the Cardinal cagers. I
do not profess that this year's team, with
its 6-7 record, is going to set the Pacific
10 Conference on fire for the remainder
of the regular season, earn a spot in the
NCAA Tournament, and make a run at
the Final Four. I realize that, unlike its
female counterpart, Stanford's men's
team does not figure to be the next Duke
in the near future (Although I would
wager that we, too, could lose to Georgia
Tech.). I'm not even promising that the
squad will win more than 10 or 12 games
by season's end.
What I am saying is that the last four
years are just that. Four consecutive post
season appearances, two invitations to the
"Big Dance," one NIT championship — all
are part of Stanford basketball's proud
tradition and hence a part of the past.
This is now.
I attended last Saturday's victory over
Oregon at Maples Pavilion, a win that

earned the Cardinal a .500 conference
record, but only 3,353 other people were
on hand in a building that holds 7,500.
Pretty pathetic, considering that it was a
Saturday night (This is Stanford, what
else could you possibly have planned?) and
that it was the first weekend of the quar
ter. If there are that many empty seats for
a favored team's first weekend conference
home game, there could be more plastic
visible at that squad's midweek contests
than there is at a department store the
weekend before Christmas.
Maybe people forgot to pick up a
handy-dandy pocket schedule at the
sports marketing table when they attend
ed all those women's volleyball and pre
season women's basketball games before
Winter Break. Maybe they thought that
when they didn't see men's basketball on
the football ticket order form they
returned the first day they received it in
the mail last August (A handful of gener
ous companies are letting the student

body into the games free this season),
that for some reason the "Keefe-less"
