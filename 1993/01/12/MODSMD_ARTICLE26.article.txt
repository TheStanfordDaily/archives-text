# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
In sports, what happens to a team at the
outset of a calendar year — whether New
Year's Day falls at the beginning or in the
middle of its season — can be important in
setting the tone for the remainder of that
campaign.
This week, the Daily has chosen as its
Athletes of the Week Robert Devens and Val
Whiting, two competitors who have gotten

1993 off to a great start for the Cardinal
men's tennis and women's basketball teams,
respectively.
Devens, a junior from New York City, was
co-champion of the singles draw at the
National Collegiate Tennis Classic last
weekend in Palm Springs. As an unseeded
player going into the tournament, Devens
had to battle past USC's Adam Peterson and
pull off upsets of Notre Dame's Will Forsyth
and Stanford teammate and doubles partner
Michael Flanagan before earning a thrilling
7-6 (16-14), 1-6, 6-3 comeback win over the
Irish's Mark Schmidt in the semifinals.
The next time Devens faces USC's Brian
MacPhie, last weekend's No. 1 seed whom
Devens defeated earlier in his career, the two
will make up their scheduled Final, which
was rained out. This showdown could take
place as early as this weekend, when the
Cardinal participates in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Indoor Championships.

Whiting, the senior center and mainstay
of the defending NCAA champions, got her
squad off and running in Pac-10 play by
scoring 43 points and grabbing 25 rebounds
in Stanford's road sweep of Oregon and Ore
gon State.
A native of Wilmington, Del., Whiting has
made good on her preseason All-American
billing in leading the fourth-ranked Cardinal
to an 11-2 record thus far. She has led her
team in scoring seven times during the

young season and in rebounding on eight dif
ferent occasions.
As she attempts to lead Stanford to its
third national title in four years, Whiting
finds herself chasing Cardinal individual
records as well. Already the school's all-time
leading rebounder, she is just 28 shy of the
1,000 mark and is also 326 points away from
earning the all-time scoring title.
