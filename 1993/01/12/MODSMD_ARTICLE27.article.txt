# Grapplers fall to OSU

### Sam Wu Staff writer 
With No. 7 Oregon State boast
ing five nationally-ranked grap
plers, the Stanford wrestling
team had no trouble understand
ing the challenge awaiting them
last Sunday evening. What the
Cardinal did have a problem with
was the ii\juries that had decimat
ed its first string.
In 10 total matches, the Cardi
nal won only one and lost six,
while forfeiting at the 167-pound,
177-pound, and heavyweight divi
sions; the Beavers triumphed 41-
4 at Stanford.
"We would have found our
hands full even if we were
healthy," said Stanford head
coach Chris Horpel. "They were
simply more ready."
As a dual meet, the Oregon
State contest does not significant
ly influence the Cardinal's team
standing, since the squad will face
the Beavers and other conference
foes once again at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships in
late February. However, the
encounter will figure into individ
ual rankings.
Four Stanford wrestlers
entered their matches with rea
sonable hopes of being seeded in
the Pac-10 Championships and
the NCAA meet. Redshirt fresh

man Jimmy Aguirre, competing
at 134 pounds, continued his
already promising march by
securing the Cardinal's only vic
tory of the event by a score of 17-
6. His three counterparts did not
fare so well, however.
Lance Johnson, according to
Horpel, suffered the most dis
heartening defeat. The 142-
pound junior, who qualified for
nationals last year, lost a close 9-
6 decision to the Beaver's defend
ing Pac-10 champion Ryan Sugai.
Johnson wrestled despite nursing
a rib injury.
Senior Phil Nowick, at 118
pounds, also lost a close match, 3-
2. Redshirt freshman Tod Sur
mon, who had not yet recovered
from an ankle injury, faced more
difficulties, losing 11-2 in the 150-
pound class to Oregon State's
Rvan Kringlie, an opponent Sur
mon had defeated two weeks ear
lier.
"Only four of nine wrestlers in
a weight division will receive
seedings in the Pac-10 Champi
onships," Horpel said. "We need
to beat people like Oregon State
to reach our goal."
Stanford, now with a 2-1-0
dual meet record, will have more
chances to prove itself with Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and South
ern Oregon on the horizon this
weekend
