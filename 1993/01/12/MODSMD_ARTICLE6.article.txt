## Hunt for multicultural educator almost over 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
After six months of hunting for the right person to
replace Greg Ricks, the search committee for a new
multicultural educator is bringing five finalists to
campus for interviews and hopes to make its decision
in time for the person to begin work spring quarter.
"We have a really outstanding group of final can
didates," said Dean of Students Michael Jackson, the
chair of the committee. "I think we're going to have a
very difficult choice."
Committee member and Assoc. Dir. of Residential
Education Ann Porteus said the last candidate will
visit on Jan. 19 and that the com mittee hopes to have
a decision soon after that.
"We would love it if somebody could come by

spring quarter," she said, adding
that spring is an important time for
the multicultural educator because
of Orientation planning.
The multicultural educator posi
tion has been vacant since Ricks re
signed May 12 to take a job as vice
president for education and training
at City Year, a non-profit "urban
peace corps" in Boston.
All of the five candidates, one man

and four women, come from distinct backgrounds,
Jackson said, adding that none have a connection to
the University.
The candidates are:
• Czerny Brasuell, director of the Development
and Community Organization at the Christie Insti
tute South in North Carolina;
• Cornelia Dinnean, former director of the Office
of Faith, Peace and Justice Program at Fairfield Uni
versity in Connecticut;
• Dianna Kale, coordinator of special projects in the
Dean of Students office at the University of Oregon;
• Maria Molina, director of the women's center at
the University of Iowa; and
• Tommy Woon, associate dean of the college and di
rector of the Third World Center at Brown University.
According to Porteus, each candidate will probably
spend one day on campus talking to members of the
search committee, the deans of the ethnic communi
ty centers and some student leaders.
Assoc. Dean of Students Jim Larimore, director of
the Native American Cultural Center, said he has
been very impressed with the candidates and their
"broad range of past experiences."
"Each of the candidates brings with them strong
points and areas that will need to adjust to life at
Stanford," Larimore said.
