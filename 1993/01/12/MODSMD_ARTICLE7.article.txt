# Libraries acquire Sánchez' personal papers
## 'Provocative' poet significant figure in Chicano Studies, graduate students say 
### Roberto Milk Staff writer 
Stanford has acquired the personal papers
of renowned Chicano poet Ricardo Sanchez, li
brary officials announced last week, marking
what several graduate students called a signif
icant addition to Stanford's collection of Chi
cano literature.
"Every field of study has some seminal fig
ures or markers which they use to gauge their
evolution, birth, and development." said Ben
Olguin, a doctoral candidate in the Department
of Spanish and Portuguese. "Sanchez is one of
them — he's a watermark in Chicano Studies."
Sanchez, currently a professor at Washing
ton State, is recognized by many Chicano Stud
ies scholars as one of the fundamental figures
in Chicano literature.
Roberto Trujillo, curator for Mexican-Amer
ican collections, said the acquisition process
began at the behest of two graduate students.
"I. . . checked with professors that knew
Sanchez's work well and everybody that I
talked to advised we should do all that we could
towards the acquisition. |The process] was ba
sically a collaborative initiative of the students
and faculty of the library," he said.
"I simply don't believe you can study Chi
cano literature and not know who Ricardo
Sanchez is," Trujillo said. "So having his per
sonal correspondence on video and having all
that primary source material above and be

yond his published work will make research on
him and his work much richer."
Much of the force behind Sanchez's work is
drawn from his own personal history of being
victimized by the "system," Olguin explained.

This man, through sheer
force of character, has been a
survivor. This man was able to
get his GED and then a Ph.D.
.. . and then become a
university professor despite
the fact that he was an ex-con.'

Sanchez dropped out of high school, enlisted in
the U.S. army, and later ended up in prison. He
was incarcerated in both California and Texas.
"He cultivated his own sense of being in
prison, in solitary confinement," Olguin said.
Doctoral student Miguel Lopez describes
S&nchez as a survivor. "What happens to ex
convicts in this country? Normally, they are de
stroyed — but this man, through sheer force of
character, has been a survivor. This man was

able to get his GED and then a Ph.D. . . . and
then become a university professor despite the
fact that he was an ex-con."
Sanchez, 51, is currently an associate pro
fessor at Washington State with appointments
in both the English Department and the De
partment of Comparative American Cultures.
"He's provocative," Trujillo said. "He in
spires students to want to know his work bet
ter. So what better way to support that kind of
research than to have those materials here.
They are here because of our students."
The Sanchez acquisition will serve to high
light the needs of Chicano literature programs
at Stanford. "The status of Chicano culture at
Stanford, and in a broader sense the U.S., has
been as a bastard stepchild," Olguin said. "It's a
struggle. When we want to get a faculty mem
ber, it's a struggle just to get a position for them.
"Eor every issue we always have to justify
the legitimacy of Chicano culture and Chicano
lit. I hope that we don't have to do that in this
school anymore. I hope Stanford can become a
leader," he said.
Stanford plans to host a panel discussion and
reception in March in conjunction with the Na
tional Association of Chicano Studies confer
ence to inaugurate the documents, Olguin said.
Sanchez is scheduled to conduct a reading of
his poetry at the event, Trujillo said.
"It's an opportunity for people on campus,
particularly undergrads, to see a historical fig
ure," he said.
