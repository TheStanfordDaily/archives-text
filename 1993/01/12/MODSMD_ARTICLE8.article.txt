# Stanford grad takes a 'Quantum Leap' tonight

As a five-year-old, Megyn Price
made her debut as an actress in a
household production of "The Lit
tle Red Riding Hood."
"We Imy siblings) rewrote the
story and invited family and
neighbors to come watch," recalls
Price, who graduated from Stan
ford in June.
Now, Price has made a "Quan
tum Leap" from neighborhood
theater to primetime TV. "Quan
tum Leap," which airs tonight at 8
p.m. on channel 8, features the
Stanford alumnae in a guest star
ring role as 18-yr-old "Suzi," a dis

ciple of a feminist movement in
1968 Greenwich, Connecticut;
Sam Beckett, the main actor
played by Scott Balcula, leaps
through time into the body of
Suzi's mother.
"I had met the casting director
who told me they'd auditioned a
million actresses and they didn't
know what they wanted," said
Price, who then tried out for the
part.
"I thought it would be just
three or four lines," said Price,
who had a part in "Tequila and
Bonetti," a television show which
aired last fall. "When I found out it
was a guest starring role I felt like
I was on another planet. I must

have been jumping and screaming
for 10 minutes."
Price then underwent an "in
sane" shooting schedule at Uni
versal Studios, working from 5 in
the morning to midnight for a
week. "I've never been so tired or
so happy," she said.
Snagging a plum role on a
primetime TV show so shortly
after graduation is a boon for any
actress, especially for Price, who
had doubts about acting at one
point despite her track record of
experience.
"I wanted a safe career but I
was unhappy," said Price, who
considered majoring in economics
before switching to communica

tions. "It was very scary seeing all
of my friends graduate and land
ing these stable, well-paying jobs.
"By God, if there was anything
else I enjoyed as much I'd do it.
But this is the only lifestyle that
really makes me happy, even if it is
the craziest lifestyle," said Price,
who added that her education at
Stanford has widened her perspec
tive and prepared her for her act
ing career.
Even in the glitzy land of Holly
wood, the Stanford name pulls
weight and raises eyebrows.
"Ninety-nine percent of t he popu
lation in Ix)s Angeles are actors,


Megyn Price
who don't normally put their
education on their resume. As
soon as they see the Stanford
name, I feel as if they give me
more respect, it's more phenome
nal."
Pryce's other projects include
an audition for a commercial in
which she is told to laugh boister
ously for 10 straight minutes.
Judging from her current suc
cess, the audition couldn't have
been too hard.
