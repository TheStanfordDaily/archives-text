# The
						'tidal wave' of democracy
## Former U.S. Rep. Solarz asserts triumph over dictatorship 
### Elisabeth Witchel Staff writer 
Promoting both the practical
and idealistic sides of worldwide
democracy, former New York
Congressman Stephen J. Solarz
last night told a Kresge audience
of several hundred that "the
desire for a full belly is not incom
patible with the desire to cast a
vote."
Solarz's talk, "U.S. Policy
Toward Third World Dictator
ships: The Democratic Option
Reconsidered," addressed the
"tidal wave of democracy" that
has hit worldwide in the last 10
years "from Mongolia to
Moscow" and the role which the
United States has played and
ought to play in the future.
"Democracy has prevailed over
dictatorship" in numerous
unlikely places in Africa, Asia,
Eastern Europe, Central and
South America, and of course the

Soviet Union, Solarz said. The
impetus of the democratic move
ment began in the Philippines
when the Marcos regime was top
pled, said Solarz, who conducted
the investigation into the Marcos'
private wealth.
Such transitions to democracy
have gone against former asser
tions that in Third World coun
tries "development is more impor
tant than pluralism" or that those
countries possess cultural tenden
cies toward authoritative
regimes.
He did not deny the several
exceptions — China, North
Korea, Vietnam, Burma, most of
the Middle East, Cuba and oth
ers. In these cases, he explained,
fostering democracy is an objec
tive to always keep in mind, but
American policymaking should
also consider other things.
For example, Solarz said that
since China plays a large role in
the world community its coopera

tion is highly desirable in dealing
with world issues. In Saudi Ara
bia the emergence of democracy
is as likely as "coming across
water in the desert,"and as the
United States is oil dependent,
eliciting a democratic govern
ment will have to wait.
While he advised political
restraint in such regions, Solarz
encouraged aggressive support —
mostly economic — for the still
fragile democracies in Eastern
Europe and the former republics of
the Soviet Union to the degree of
the Marshall plan after World War
n.
Solarz, a Democrat, speaks
from extensive experience when
he discusses foreign affairs. As a
Congressman, he served on the
House Committee of Foreign
Affairs working particularly on
policies in the Philippines and
Africa.
Solarz will also speak at a sem
inar today at noon in Building 90.
