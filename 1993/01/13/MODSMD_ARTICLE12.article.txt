# Report denies hostage conspiracy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A $1.3
million congressional investiga
tion has found no credible evi
dence that Republicans conspired
with Iran in 1980 to delay the
release of American hostages
until after the U.S. election,
according to a summary of the
report obtained yesterday.
The full document, to be
released by the bipartisan con
gressional task force today, seeks
to lay to rest allegations that have
haunted the Reagan and Bush
administrations for years.
"There is wholly insufficient

credible evidence of any communi
cations by, or on behalf of, the 1980
Reagan presidential campaign with
any persons representing or con
nected with the Iranian govern
ment, or with those holding Amer
icans as hostages during the 1979-
1981 period," said the summary.
"There is no credible evidence
supporting any attempt or proposal
to attempt, by the Reagan presiden
tial campaign. . . to delay the
release of the American hostages in
Iran," the task force concluded
after an 11-month investigation.
The report itself, contains

detailed information rebutting alle
gations that senior Reagan aides —
among them the late William Casey
who served as his campaign manag
er and then headed the CIA — took
part in meetings in Europe with
Iranian representatives.
But the task force reported that,
in fact, the Reagan administration
in its first term "upheld the arms
embargo with Iran and encouraged
its allies to do the same." In its sec
ond term, the Reagan administra
tion did sell Iran weapons, in return
for the release of Americans taken
hostage in Lebanon.
