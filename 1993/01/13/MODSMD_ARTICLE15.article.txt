Earth Day sure is nice,
but it's just paying the
environment lip service

Reduce, reuse, recycle.
Fifty Simple Things You Can Do
To Save the Earth.
You can make a difference.

ed Bay Area Earth Day
1993, the time has come for
Stanford to examine its commit
ment to conservation and environ
mental preservation.
Sure, many students carry blue
plastic SEAS mugs on their back
packs. Sure, green recycling bins
are übiquitous. And even The Daily
likes to pat itself on the back for
printing on (sort of) recycled paper.
But now, as the campus pre
pares for a $75,000 Earth Day
extravaganza featuring everyone
from Joan Baez to Anna Eshoo,
it's time to ask: Are we really going
beyond lip service when it comes to
environmentalism?
A quick look around is all that's
required to realize that Stanford
would like to save the Earth, as long
as doing so won't infringe upon our
cozy lifestyles and standard of living.
The evidence is easy to find. A
sign in the Ford Center advises
people to toss newspapers in a
garbage can rather than a recy
cling bin. Hazardous waste viola
tions are a recurring problem.
Planners fail to take advantage of
modern, environmentally sound
construction techniques when
building new dormitories.
Environmentalism gets lots of
talk and little action on this cam
pus, it seems. April 22, 1990 —
a.k.a. Earth Day 1990, the mother
of all Earth Days — was supposed
to change the world, and it didn't,
at least not very quickly or in any
major way. So what's another
party going to do?
Organizers claim that this event
will have a narrower focus, that of

incorporating environmental aware
ness into the daily lives of individu
als, organizations and businesses in
the Bay Area. Students, faculty and
staff will have the opportunity to
interface with hands-on, interactive
booths, theme information areas
like "The Clean and Green House,"
and view videos and slide presenta
tions.
Pre- and post-Earth Day events,
such as a benefit run, a writing
contest, a tree planting day, a wet
lands tour and a Baylands cleanup
also have been scheduled.
Such is all well and good, and
certainly admirable, if we don't
want to end up in nursing homes
built atop landfills sometime in the
21st century. But can one more she
bang give people the kick in pants
needed to really get serious and
make some sacrifices in order to
preserve the only home we know?
Will such a festivity be sufficient
to convince people that every light
they don't shut off, every battery
they throw away rather than
recharge, every rainforest wood
product they purchase is con
tributing to the blitzkreig that is
stripping and polluting the planet?
If the past is any precedent, the
answer, unfortunately, is a resound
ing no.
Sure, go to the little Earth Day
celebration. Party your little green
butt off. But when you wake up in
the morning and watch the cara
van of garbage trucks that are cer
tain to be carting off the hypocriti
cal evidence of a population that
can't think beyond the present,
take a minute to really consider
the importance and the immensity
of the task that lies at the foot of
the twentysomething generation.
Now is when our patterns of
behavior will be established for
life. Now is when we can vote. Now
is when we have an opportunity to
educate ourselves at this
renowned university about the
great clean-up project that is in
our hands. The actions of today
will determine the future of our
planet for many years to come.
Party on, dude?
