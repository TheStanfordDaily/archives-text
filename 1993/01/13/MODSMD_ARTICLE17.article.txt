## Pete Rose got a raw deal 
### 
For those of you who
weren't keeping score at home,
Reggie Jackson was the only per
son elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame
by the Baseball Writers Association of
America this year.
Named on 93.6 percent of the ballots
in his first year of eligibility, few base
ball fans would argue that Mr. October
should not be in the Hall.
But what struck me more in the vot
ing was the fact that Pete Rose got only
14 votes in the balloting. Again, the
question has come up, should Pete Rose
be in the Baseball Hall of Fame? I
believe he should.
Pete Rose was banned from baseball
for life by former Commissioner Bart
Giamatti for gambling on baseball. In a
secret plea bargain, Rose accepted the
commissioner's sentence but never pub
licly admitted he had bet on baseball.
While he is banned from the game, Rose
is ineligible for the Hall of Fame.
Reporting on the elections, the San
Jose Mercury News yearned for "anoth
er time, when baseball was measured
more in hits, runs, wins and losses than
bottom lines."
The Merc pines for the same things
that most baseball fans do: a return to
the days of baseball when players
pushed themselves to excel because they
loved the game.
The baseball Hall of Fame was creat-

Ed exactly for this brand of baseball
player — the athlete who performed at a
level of excellence over the span of his
career. Pete Rose is another who
brought the game to new heights and he
deserves representation.
The question hinges on what the Hall
of Fame is supposed to represent. Is it a
hall of athletic champions whose mem
bership is determined solely by on-field
ability?
Or is it supposed to represent some
bigger notion of sport or society,
therefore only including members
with both excellent talents and perfect
character?
I believe it would have to be the for
mer, because few people short of Jesus
would be able to meet the requirement
of the latter. (Besides, Jesus' slugging
percentage was overly inflated by that
money-changers-in-the-temple episode.)
As a society we have a tendency to
elevate our sports heroes to the level of
demi-gods, only to have the illusion
shattered when we realize that they, too,
are human.
Don't get me wrong, I strongly
believe that sports players should
always strive to be good role models for
youth because they are in public posi
tions of influence. We should not,
however, expect that any of them are
above humanity because of athletic
ability.

Pete Rose made a big mistake, maybe
many. Still, his all-time hit record may
be the single most impressive statistic in
baseball and alone might merit induc
tion into Cooperstown.
Maybe more importantly, for most of
his career "Charlie Hustle" was the
embodiment of everything that a base
ball player was supposed to be: one who
gave every bit of himself on the field in
the pursuit of excellence.
The bottom line is that the decision of
the baseball commissioner's office must
be changed and Rose reinstated into
baseball before he can be elected to
Cooperstown.
With a new Commissioner due in
the next few months, it may become a
reality. I hope the baseball writers
then will recognize the exceptional
human abilities Rose brought to Amer
ica's game while they remember his
humanity.
Now, about this Shoeless Joe Jackson
thing. ..

ner Sportstalk with Ari, Mike and

more times.
