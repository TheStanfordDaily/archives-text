Condemning columnist
while excusing female
for same writing unfair
When I was reading Professor Cohen
and company's Jan. 8 letter in The Daily
about Pete Huyck's poetry, I noticed a
blatant double standard at work.
They accused Huyck of misogyny and
hatred of women's bodies based on his
writings. Conveniently left unmen
tioned, however, was Marjorie Crigler's
Dec. 9 response poem in The Daily,
"Penis." Why does a poem written by a
man that makes fun of female genitalia
receive an indignant letter while a poem
written by a woman that makes fun of
male genitalia receives no mention from
the same people?
The entire point of writing "Penis"
was to respond in kind to Huyck's
"Vagina." I have never used my penis as
a donut-holder — just as women don't
actually use their vaginas as handy stor

age areas — but I can still laugh at both
images.
The male organ is the obvious target
of the donut analogy, but rather than be
offended by it, I take the reference as
what it was meant to be, a joke. Crigler's
poem was written just as offensively,
and just as funny, as Huyck's.
If your goal is to protest poetry that
you consider insulting to a person's gen
der, then you must give Crigler's poem
equal mention.
On the other hand, if your goal is
only to protect women from the "mali
cious" writings of male humorists, then
you can ignore what a woman writes,
even if the two pieces of offensive mate
rial are nearly identical.
If Cohen and company choose not to
find humor in what Huyck says, or if
they want to label it as offensive, that's
one thing. It's quite another thing to
apply a double standard by labeling
something as offensive if written by a
man while ignoring an equally "offen
sive" work written by a woman.

Letter reminds woman
of 30-year-old incident,
sexism in medical Held
Kimberly Harper's letter in the Jan.
11 issue of The Daily reminded me of
my own experience 30 years ago.
As a premed student at the top of my
class at Rice University, I was planning
my final year's classes with my advisor.
Knowing that I was newly engaged, he
asked me why I was registering for a
notoriously difficult biochemistry class
as well as physics.
I told him that I intended to apply to
very competitive medical schools and
wanted to be well-prepared. He then
informed me that medical schools did
not accept married women (a subse
quent survey bore him out) and that I
could not marry my fianc6 until after I

had matriculated at medical school.
Med students were not expelled if
they married, but extreme pressure was
put on married women to withdraw. He
said that I would have to lie to the inter
viewer about my marriage plans, but
that I was not likely to be believed
because I was "too beautiful not to get
married."
Everyone assumed that a married
woman would drop out of practice to
have babies, and that her education
would have been "wasted."
In the '60s, there was no avenue for
complaint, and neither laws nor public
sentiment to condemn this attitude.
Refusing to lie and to postpone my wed
ding plans, I renounced neurosurgery
and became a professional editor instead.
I hope Kimberly Harper will not be
discouraged, but will persevere in expos
ing residual sexism in medicine for her
own sake, and that of the next genera
tion of women.
