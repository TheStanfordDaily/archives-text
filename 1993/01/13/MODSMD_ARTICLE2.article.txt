# Employees say early retirement forced

### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Claiming they were forced to leave involun
tarily, a number of University employees say a
budget-cutting plan that encouraged them to
retire early unfairly targets older people in the
workplace.
Many employees said they would have pre
ferred to continue working, but were told — ei
ther directly or in more subtle ways — that
their job was in jeopardy.
"A department head told me quite explicitly
that he had heard I was in trouble," said a
SLAC technician in his mid-60s, who insisted
on anonymity.
The technician eventually decided to accept

Stanford's Staff Early Retirement Incentive
(SERI) program, which encouraged long-time
University staff members to retire, in ex
change for an incentive ranging from four to 12
months of salary.
Nearly 1,300 staff members were eligible for
the program, and 497 decided to accept it.
"I didn't really want to retire, but an extra
year's pay seemed . . . adequate," the techni
cian said.
Critics of the program complain that it sets
up a dynamic in the workplace that permits
abuse of older staff members. "It leads to
younger staff mistreating older staff because
we've all agreed we've got to get these old
timers out of here," said Jack Truher, a SLAC
engineer who runs an ad-hoc employee net

work called the "Employee Rights Clinic."
But University officials contend that the
program is a voluntary, humane alternative to
layoffs that provided staff members with a very
attractive bonus.
"It does not force anybody to retire," said
Keith Smith, manager of Employee Relations.
"It says if you meet certain eligibility criteria,
you may get an incentive or extra money to re
tire."
He added that while some criticize SERI for
targeting older people, the 169 layoffs the Uni
versity made during the 1990 "repositioning"
hit mainly younger people, because those lay
offs were based on seniority.
