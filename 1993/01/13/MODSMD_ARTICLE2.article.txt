# Employees say early retirement forced
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Claiming they were forced to leave involun
tarily, a number of University employees say a
budget-cutting plan that encouraged them to
retire early unfairly targets older people in the
workplace.
Many employees said they would have pre
ferred to continue working, but were told — ei
ther directly or in more subtle ways — that
their job was in jeopardy.
"A department head told me quite explicitly
that he had heard I was in trouble," said a
SLAC technician in his mid-60s, who insisted
on anonymity.
The technician eventually decided to accept

Stanford's Staff Early Retirement Incentive
(SERI) program, which encouraged long-time
University staff members to retire, in ex
change for an incentive ranging from four to 12
months of salary.
Nearly 1,300 staff members were eligible for
the program, and 497 decided to accept it.
"I didn't really want to retire, but an extra
year's pay seemed . . . adequate," the techni
cian said.
Critics of the program complain that it sets
up a dynamic in the workplace that permits
abuse of older staff members. "It leads to
younger staff mistreating older staff because
we've all agreed we've got to get these old
timers out of here," said Jack Truher, a SLAC
engineer who runs an ad-hoc employee net

work called the "Employee Rights Clinic."
But University officials contend that the
program is a voluntary, humane alternative to
layoffs that provided staff members with a very
attractive bonus.
"It does not force anybody to retire," said
Keith Smith, manager of Employee Relations.
"It says if you meet certain eligibility criteria,
you may get an incentive or extra money to re
tire."
He added that while some criticize SERI for
targeting older people, the 169 layoffs the Uni
versity made during the 1990 "repositioning"
hit mainly younger people, because those lay
offs were based on seniority.
Smith said he would have liked
to take advantage of SERI him
self. "If they'd lowered the age to
35, I'd be gone," he said.
SERI applies only to employees
who are at least 55 and have
worked at the University for at
least 10 years. Those whose age
and number of years at the Uni
versity totals 75 were also eligible
for the program.
Eligible staff members could
apply for SERI between March 15
and Oct. 15 of last year, and must
leave the University by Aug. 31.
They will receive an incentive
based on their years at the Uni
versity. The amount ranges from
four months of salary for working
between 10-12 years, to one year
of salary for working 26 or more
years.
"What they've done is sweeten
the pot to get people to voluntari
ly roll over — people who may not
necessarily want to stop working
at this point, but the financial set
tlement is to their benefit," said
Leah Kaplan, the University's
ombudsperson. She speaks with

many employees who have
grievances against the University.
Kaplan said the "generational
purge" of older people is nothing
new, but simply a usual tactic of
employers — at Stanford as well
as across the country. "That's a
common dynamic," she said. "It's
existed before repositioning, but
it has to be combatted if it's not
for the employee."
Many employees said they felt
pressured to accept the incentive,
and betrayed that an institution
to which they had contributed so
much was simply shunting them
aside.
"I'm disappointed in the Uni
versity," said a 55-year-old
employee in a Stanford depart
ment who "saw [herself] forced to
accept" the SERI program.
"You feel you've devoted most
of your professional career to the
University and you find it particu
larly hard to have to leave and
look for something else," said the
employee, who has been at Stan
ford for nearly 30 years.
She said that while her super
visor did not directly encourage
retirement, he told her severe
cuts would be made in the depart
ment and her area was one of the
prime targets. Then, she said, she

was "bombarded" with a string of
notices from the University's
Human Resources Office remind
ing her of the deadline for apply
ing to SERI.
"It wasn't as if you could forget
about it — the deadline was con
stantly in your mind," she said.
"It was always put as if somebody
was doing you a great favor."
Another employee, a staffer in
a University department in his
mid-50s, said he, too, felt pressure
to take the incentive. A supervisor
in his department told him that
"we had a bunch of retiring pro
fessors, and they were having a
hard time scraping up money to
pay me."
Officially, he said, "I've decided
to take the incentive voluntarily;
unofficially, I've been kind of
pushed into it."
Smith maintained that SERI
was "strictly voluntary." He
added that managers "were not
supposed to tell individuals"
about their job status — only hold
meetings with their entire staff
informing them of when the unit
or department would be cut.
"They shouldn't have taken
individuals aside and said your
position," Smith said.
Many employees contend that

the University is guilty of age dis
crimination because of the way
SERI targets older staffers.
"What if you offered a special
incentive for eliminating Lithua
nian women from the staff?"
Truher asked. "You'd call it dis
crimination, right?"
But many said they did not
think efforts to sue the University
would be very successful, because
employees accepting SERI were
required to sign a form saying
they had agreed voluntarily.
"It's impossible to get them
legally because they've safeguard
ed themselves against that," the
55-year-old woman said.
Smith said the claims of age
discrimination were invalid, and
added that if employees tried to
take legal action against the Uni
versity "they'd have a very hard
time pursuing it."
Some employees, however,
called for a different kind of
action. "I have a little bit of kick
— I'm ready to fight," said the
man in his mid-50s, who has been
at Stanford more than 25 years.
He added that if he "knew there
were a dissatisfied group of people
out there," he would be willing to
work with them to pursue the
case.
