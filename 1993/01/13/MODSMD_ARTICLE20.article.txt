## A
						whale of a what!? 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Those few among you who have
closelv followed this humble week
ly offering will have noticed by
now that I am a techie bigot. I
have sneered at literature, jeered
at the social "sciences" and —
until my recent re-education at the
hands of a respected companion —
I called one of the three most pop
ular majors at Stanford "JV Bio."
This Wednesday's column
marks my first effort to make
amends. Earlier in the week, the
nice man attributed below accosted
me on the street and presented the
stated question.
Etymology, history and good
old-fashioned human error have a
good deal more to do with the
answer than do chemistry or biolo
gy. Nonetheless, I decided that the
query was suitably intriguing
(and, although I've managed to
control myself, a darn good chance
to make crude sexual innuendo),
so without further ado:
Q # Why are sperm whales called
\ sperm whales?
— Todd David
A # If I told you that the sperm
'whale, Physeter macro
cephalus, got its common name
because each animal is the source
of vast quantities of a certain
gooey white material, you proba
bly wouldn't believe me.
Too bad.
Around the end of the fifteenth
century, European fishermen dis
covered that a gland in the over
sized, squarish head of a particular
species of whale contained up to
500 gallons (that's 10 recycling bar
rels full, just for perspective) of a
pale wax, which when purified had
the form of a soft, white scaly mass.
Unable to accurately identify
their discoveiy, these fishermen
applied the current version of the
famous adage, "If it looks like a
duck, and quacks like a duck, then
it must be a duck." Being simple,
earthy folk, they proclaimed that
the novel substance was the
whale's seminal fluid.
The educated people of the time
named the wax "spermaceti," from
Latin and Greek roots meaning
"sperm of the whale" — and
although we know better now, the
name has stuck. The species of
whale, was dubbed the "sperm
whale" in honor of what appeared
to be its most copious bodily fluid.
I admit that I have no idea what
they thought a whale would do
with that much sperm — male
whales, like their brethren in other
mammalian species, have a well
designed sperm targeting system
which alleviates the necessity for
covering the female with ejaculate.
Remember, however, that these
people were still struggling with

the idea that the earth is round.
After 1712, when the first sperm
whale was harpooned by an efficient
commercial whaling operation off
the coast of Nantucket, spermaceti
was used extensively as lamp fuel
and a raw material for candle manu
facture.
In modern times, spermaceti has
been little used except as a base for
certain toiletries and pharmaceuti
cals. In the 19505, advances in oil
chemistry allowed a much larger
fraction of sperm oil to be used in
soaps, and it was discovered that
treatment with sulfur made sperm
oil an ideal high-pressure lubricant.
Motivated by a desire to exploit
this new resource, humanity
embarked on the last great commer
cial assault on the sperm whale — an
attack halted less by our species' sud
den enlightenment than the result
ing scarcity of the sperm whale.
Inquiring minds among the
readership will have noticed that
the sperm of most mammals is not
useful in the manufacture of can
dles or in procuring lubricant
(although in the latter case, it
sometimes works the other way
round). What, then, is spermaceti,
and why does the animal need so
much of it?
It turns out that spermaceti is
chemically pretty simple — mostly
cetyl palmitate (seen listed even
today as an ingredient of some
shampoos, although plants and
synthetics have supplanted whales
as the source) and fatty alcohol
esters of fatty acids.
It isn't totally clear why the
sperm whale needs a 500-gallon
bag of the stuff in its head, but
the literature contains two pret
ty fair, mutually compatible
guesses.
The spermaceti gland may serve
as a cushion to protect the whale's
vital organs against the crushing
pressure of deep sea diving. Sperm
whales routinely swim as deep as
1,150 feet beneath the surface in
pursuit of giant squid and other
prey, and they have been found tan
gled in cables at depths three times
greater.
Another possibility is that the
big oil bag functions as part of the
sperm whale's "sonar." In the dark
deeps of the sea, whales emit
sounds and evaluate the returning
echoes to gather information about
their environment.
Sound waves propagate differ
ently in oily media than in salt
water, and it seems reasonable
that the spermaceti gland, located
near the echolocating organs,
might have something to do with
the processing of cetacean sonar
signals.
