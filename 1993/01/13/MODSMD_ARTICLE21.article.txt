# Juggling atoms and snapping DNA
## Physicist Steve Chu uses lasers to twiddle with life's building blocks

Imagine a car cruising down
Highway 280 at a velocity of 600
meters per second, 20 times
faster than the average Califor
nia speed limit. This is the typi
cal speed of an atom at room
temperature. Now imagine a car
crawling along at a speed of 2.7
meters per second, slower than a
tossed softball.
The laboratory team of
Physics Prof. Steve Chu has been
able to slow down atoms to this
speed by cooling these tiny parti
cles to within 250 millionth of
absolute zero with one simple
tool-lasers. Not even the world's
most complex refrigerators oper
ating simultaneously could reach
this temperature.
The lab has been making rapid
progress in the field of laser cooling
and trapping of atoms, a technique
that has been applicable in many
fields of science.
For a long time, scientists
have been able to control the
movements of charged particles
using the forces exerted on them
by electric and magnetic fields.
However, manipulating neutral
particles has always been a tech
nical challenge. Since a neutral
particle does not carry a net
charge, the attractive force
between it and either an electric
or magnetic field is negligible to
be of any practical use.
Chu's technique is based on
the Doppler effect. When an
atom moves against the propa
gation direction of a laser beam,
it "sees" a higher frequency
than an atom moving with the
beam. If the laser is tuned so
that its frequency is slightly
lower than the frequency of
maximum absorption by the
atom, then atoms moving
against the beam will absorb
and reradiate energy. In effect,
they will be "pushed back" by
the laser.
By aligning three sets of
lasers perpendicular to each
other, atoms can be "trapped" in
what Chu calls the "optical
molasses." In the process,"the
internal kinetic energy of the

atoms will be reduced, and the
gas will be cooled.
One of the applications
of this technique is to study the
behavior of atoms and how they
interact with each other at very
low temperature.
An apparatus built for this
purpose is the atomic fountain,
designed by Nobel Prize win
ning physicist Norman Ramsey.
After the atoms are slowed
down and cooled by the optical
molasses trap, they are then
launched upward at a velocity of
2.7 meters per second. At the
top of the trajectory, the atoms
can be excited to other energy
states by beaming microwaves
at them.
Laser cooling has enabled
scientists to "reach out and
touch particles in new ways,"
Chu said in a recent article in
Science magazine.
The fountain has led to more
accurate measurements of the
energy levels in atoms. Since the
current time standard is defined
using the energy difference
between two particular energy
levels in ground states of the
cesium atom, it is possible to
make an atomic clock using this
method with one thousand times
better accuracy than today's best
clocks.
In addition, atoms launched
from an atomic fountain can be
as long as one second, which
allowed for a more accurate mea
surement of g, the earth's gravi
tational acceleration. Using this
method, g can be measured with
a resolution of "at least three
parts in 100 million," Chu said.
Future experiments are expected
to improve the measurement of
this value by approximately 100
times.
Another technique Chu's lab
has worked upon is the use of
lasers as "optical tweezers" to
manipulate neutral particles.
Because light is comprised of
perpendicular electric and mag
netic fields, a laser beam can
induce a dipole moment in a
neutral particle, causing it to
move. For example, said Chu, "if
the particle is exposed to a nega
tively charged object. . . the elec

trons in the particle will dis
tribute themselves unevenly so
as to move away from the nega
tively charged object as much as
possible."
This asymmetrical distribu
tion creates an induced dipole
moment. And when the polarity
of a laser's electric field changes,
so does the polarity of the parti
cle. At all times, the particle
tries to remain aligned to where
the laser's electric field is the
greatest. This dipole moment
forms the basis of the optical
tweezers.
The complete assembly con
sists of a beam of laser light used
to trap the particles, along with a
microscope so that the sample
may be viewed and manipulated
at the same time. This tool
enables biologists to trap trans
parent organisms such as bacte
ria without puncturing their cell
membranes and other mem
brane-bounded organelles. How
ever, the organisms will be "opti
cuted"-or fried-if the intensity of
the laser is not carefully con
trolled.
Recently, Chu's lab, in collab
oration with Professor James
Spudich's lab in the Medical
Center, has successfully manip
ulated one of the smaller
molecules essential to life-DNA.
According to Physics graduate
student Steve Quake, who
works in Chu's lab, this proce
dure was first accomplished by
"attaching polystyrene balls
coated with the chemical avidin
to the ends of a phage(virus)
DNA."
Two lasers then trap the balls
and move them so that the DNA
stretches apart. After staining
the sample with ethidium bro
mide, the DNA can be viewed
with a video camera, where they
look like fluorescent squirming
worms.
These experiments have

revealed a great deal about the
elastic properties of DNA. This
technique may also be applied to
characterize the mechanical com
pliance of other biological
molecules, such as muscle fibers,
as well as bacterial flagella,
sperms, and chromosomes.
Quake said that future experi
ments are designed to visualize
the actions of enzymes, such as
polymerases and ligases, along a
DNA strand.
Thus the development of both
optical molasses and optical
tweezers has lead to the develop
ment of innovative biochemical
tools.
"It's been a personal joy to
see how esoteric conjectures in
atomic physics have gone well
beyond our dreams during the
early days, and have provided
important tools for physics,
chemistry and biology," Chu
said in his article.

An atomic fountain is created by positioning six lasers to create
an "optical molasses" that slows the atoms. An additional laser
pushes the atoms into another chamber, where they can be ana
lyzed. The fountain has proved useful in measuring the energy

cuted"-or fried-if the intensity of
the laser is not carefully con
trolled.
Recently, Chu's lab, in collab
oration with Professor James
Spudich's lab in the Medical
Center, has successfully manip
ulated one of the smaller
molecules essential to life-DNA.
According to Physics graduate
student Steve Quake, who
works in Chu's lab, this proce
dure was first accomplished by
"attaching polystyrene balls
coated with the chemical avidin
to the ends of a phage(virus)
DNA."
Two lasers then trap the balls
and move them so that the DNA
stretches apart. After staining
the sample with ethidium bro
mide, the DNA can be viewed
with a video camera, where they
look like fluorescent squirming
worms.
These experiments have

revealed a great deal about the
elastic properties of DNA. This
technique may also be applied to
characterize the mechanical com
pliance of other biological
molecules, such as muscle fibers,
as well as bacterial flagella,
sperms, and chromosomes.
Quake said that future experi
ments are designed to visualize
the actions of enzymes, such as
polymerases and ligases, along a
DNA strand.
Thus the development of both
optical molasses and optical
tweezers has lead to the develop
ment of innovative biochemical
tools.
"It's been a personal joy to
see how esoteric conjectures in
atomic physics have gone well
beyond our dreams during the
early days, and have provided
important tools for physics,
chemistry and biology," Chu
said in his article.

An atomic fountain is created by positioning six lasers to create
an "optical molasses" that slows the atoms. An additional laser
pushes the atoms into another chamber, where they can be ana
lyzed. The fountain has proved useful in measuring the energy
levels of atoms.
Imagine a car cruising down
Highway 280 at a velocity of 600
meters per second, 20 times
faster than the average Califor
nia speed limit. This is the typi
cal speed of an atom at room
temperature. Now imagine a car
crawling along at a speed of 2.7
meters per second, slower than a
tossed softball.
The laboratory team of
Physics Prof. Steve Chu has been
able to slow down atoms to this
speed by cooling these tiny parti
cles to within 250 millionth of
absolute zero with one simple
tool-lasers. Not even the world's
most complex refrigerators oper
ating simultaneously could reach
this temperature.
The lab has been making rapid
progress in the field of laser cooling
and trapping of atoms, a technique
that has been applicable in many
fields of science.
For a long time, scientists
have been able to control the
movements of charged particles
using the forces exerted on them
by electric and magnetic fields.
However, manipulating neutral
particles has always been a tech
nical challenge. Since a neutral
particle does not carry a net
charge, the attractive force
between it and either an electric
or magnetic field is negligible to
be of any practical use.
Chu's technique is based on
the Doppler effect. When an
atom moves against the propa
gation direction of a laser beam,
it "sees" a higher frequency
than an atom moving with the
beam. If the laser is tuned so
that its frequency is slightly
lower than the frequency of
maximum absorption by the
atom, then atoms moving
against the beam will absorb
and reradiate energy. In effect,
they will be "pushed back" by
the laser.
By aligning three sets of
lasers perpendicular to each
other, atoms can be "trapped" in
what Chu calls the "optical
molasses." In the process,"the
internal kinetic energy of the

atoms will be reduced, and the
gas will be cooled.
One of the applications
of this technique is to study the
behavior of atoms and how they
interact with each other at very
low temperature.
An apparatus built for this
purpose is the atomic fountain,
designed by Nobel Prize win
ning physicist Norman Ramsey.
After the atoms are slowed
down and cooled by the optical
molasses trap, they are then
launched upward at a velocity of
2.7 meters per second. At the
top of the trajectory, the atoms
can be excited to other energy
states by beaming microwaves
at them.
Laser cooling has enabled
scientists to "reach out and
touch particles in new ways,"
Chu said in a recent article in
Science magazine.
The fountain has led to more
accurate measurements of the
energy levels in atoms. Since the
current time standard is defined
using the energy difference
between two particular energy
levels in ground states of the
cesium atom, it is possible to
make an atomic clock using this
method with one thousand times
better accuracy than today's best
clocks.
In addition, atoms launched
from an atomic fountain can be
as long as one second, which
allowed for a more accurate mea
surement of g, the earth's gravi
tational acceleration. Using this
method, g can be measured with
a resolution of "at least three
parts in 100 million," Chu said.
Future experiments are expected
to improve the measurement of
this value by approximately 100
times.
Another technique Chu's lab
has worked upon is the use of
lasers as "optical tweezers" to
manipulate neutral particles.
Because light is comprised of
perpendicular electric and mag
netic fields, a laser beam can
induce a dipole moment in a
neutral particle, causing it to
move. For example, said Chu, "if
the particle is exposed to a nega
tively charged object. . . the elec

trons in the particle will dis
tribute themselves unevenly so
as to move away from the nega
tively charged object as much as
possible."
This asymmetrical distribu
tion creates an induced dipole
moment. And when the polarity
of a laser's electric field changes,
so does the polarity of the parti
cle. At all times, the particle
tries to remain aligned to where
the laser's electric field is the
greatest. This dipole moment
forms the basis of the optical
tweezers.
The complete assembly con
sists of a beam of laser light used
to trap the particles, along with a
microscope so that the sample
may be viewed and manipulated
at the same time. This tool
enables biologists to trap trans
parent organisms such as bacte
ria without puncturing their cell
membranes and other mem
brane-bounded organelles. How
ever, the organisms will be "opti
cuted"-or fried-if the intensity of
the laser is not carefully con
trolled.
