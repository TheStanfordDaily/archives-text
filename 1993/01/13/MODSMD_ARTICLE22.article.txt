# What Trilogy is selling
##

According to a Westinghouse
Electric study, manufacturing
companies spend more than 1
percent of revenue per year cor
recting sales order mistakes.
This doesn't sound like much,
but Trilogy Founder Joe Lie
mandt sees a $500 million mar
ket in that percentage, and
SaIesBUILDER is his entry
into this market
Suppose a customer wants
to buy a stereo system — some
thing that would bring out the
haunting quality in Sinead's
voice and capture all the
nuances of Zappa's composi
tions for under $700.
SaIesBUILDER could ask
the customer a few questions
about the type of music he lis
tens to and the type of individ
ual components (a CD-player, a
cassette player, etc.) he wants.
It also asßs for a price range.
The software package would
then offer a list of configura
tions within the given price
range. Each configuration
varies from each other in terms
of performance — maybe one
shows a higher quality CD
player, and another Bhows a

higher quality cassette player.
By simply glancing down the
list and picking a configura
tion, the customer can auto
matically order all the parts
and accessories needed for the
system, including parte that he
forgot to request, such as
speakers and speaker wire.
This would be a trivial task
for the SaIesBUILDER. Its cur
rent applications are in sales
and manufacturing, where
products have 10 times as
many parts and hundreds of
different configurations.
Trilogy's current market
runs the gamut from configu
ration of personal computers to
large mainframe systems and
computer networks. Computer
companies use the software for
sales-quotes or to design sys
tem configurations. Sales-
BUILDER may reduce the
response time for sales quotes
from two weeks to a few min
utes.
Hewlett Packard, Silicone
Graphics, LSI, Pyramid and
Octel Communications are
some of the companies which
have bought the product.
Trilogy's future markets
may range from car manufac
turing to airline reservations.
