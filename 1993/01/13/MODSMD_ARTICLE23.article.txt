# The 						wonders of human excretion

### Scoopy the Alien 
Humans spend nearly a year
out of their lives sitting on what is
commonly known as the throne of
contemplation.
According to Urology Prof.
Pataad Constan, it is a year where
in remarkable things happen.
"For a long time excretory sys
tems have been considered some
thing of an anticlimax in physiol
ogy," Constan said. "After all the
interesting stuff happened inside,
who cared what happened to the
leftovers?"
But over the past few decades,
researchers have discovered that
the human excretory system is
much more than a passive pas
sage. They have found that the
process of excretion, or "bowel
movement," triggers a whole
range of chemical and neural sig
nals that have profound effects
on the entire body, including the
brain.
Five years ago, Constan's
team discovered that excretion
triggers the release of large
amounts of dopamine, an endor
phin that stimulates neurons and
produces a general feeling of
well-being.
Intrigued, the team investigated
further and found a whole range of
hormones are released during
excretion, including adrenaline.
Biology Prof. Ursa Inwood
believes these releases are a
holdover from when the primate
ancestors of humans first came
down from the trees.
"When primates began to
walk on two legs, the process of
defecation placed them in a very
vulnerable position," Inwood
said. "The smell associated with
the process attracted predators,
who could easily catch our ances
tors with their pants down."
Although evidence is tentative,
Constan believes excretion stimu
lates neurons. Last month his group
measured increased brain activity in
primates while defecating.
"Indeed, we find that the
brain and rectum are intimately
linked," Constan said.

Thus article, written by a fictional
character from the Mike Duh's
comic strip "Wilbur Hall," is
entirely fictional.
