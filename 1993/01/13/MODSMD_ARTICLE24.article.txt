## No Irish hoops upset as Cardinal falls short, 67-61 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
For the first 36 minutes last night, the
Stanford basketball team actually looked like
it would beat a major opponent despite its per
petual shooting woes.
But the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame
escaped with a 67-61 victory in a sloppily
played game in which the teams combined for
38 turnovers.
To top off what head coach Mike Mont
gomery called a "very discouraging game,"
starting power forward Darren Allaway suf
fered a "moderate to severe sprain" and
appears unlikely to play tomorrow night
against California.
"I don't think we were ready to play at the
beginning," Montgomery said. "We looked a
half-step slow. . . and we got really, really out
physicalled."
Before 5,643 fans in Maples Pavilion, Stan
ford (6-8), which had shot well in Saturday
night's win against Oregon, again failed to put
in the ball in the hoop, shooting 36 percent for
the game.
Notre Dame (7-5), meanwhile, finished the
game shooting 57 percent, including a torrid
64 percent in the second half.
"You have to give them credit," Mont
gomery said. "Notre Dame is a very average
basketball team, but they did what they had to
do to win. I would have liked to see them beat
us when we were at our best."
The only bright spot for the Cardinal was
freshman Dion Cross, who led the team with a
career-high 17 points and often kept Stanford
in the game.
Small forward Brent Williams continued to
have his troubles, hitting only six of 21 shots
for nine points, including one of 11 shots in
the first half.
"I'm in a shooting slump, but I'm not real
ly in a scoring slump," a disheartened
Williams said after the game. "I need to be
more consistent in driving to the hoop. My
outside jump shot is not falling in."
Despite the team's overall shooting woes,
Stanford still managed to lead for most of the
game, capitalizing on second-chance opportu
nities produced by 19 offensive rebounds.
But with six minutes to go in the game,
Notre Dame took its first lead since the middle
of the first half, and the Cardinal failed to
answer the challenge.
Over the next four minutes, Stanford turned
the ball over three times, and suddenly the
Fighting Irish jumped out to a six-point lead.
A furious rush at the end, including a key
three-pointer by guard Marcus Lollie, was
proven futite when Notre Dame was twice able
to break the Cardinal full-court press for easy
dunks.
Stanford's bigger loss, however, may be the
injury to Allaway, who started off making his
first two shots before twisting his left ankle

with 16 minutes to go in the first half.
The freshman had stepped up in recent
games to become the team's strongest physi
cal presence under the boards, and his loss is
yet another in a season full of injuries to the
Cardinal front line.
With Allaway out, none of remaining big
men picked up the slack. Bart Lammersen and
Todd Manley combined for only 14 points, and
Jim Morgan failed to score before fouling out
with four and a half minutes to go in the
game.

Although Stanford out-rebounded the
Fighting Irish 42-30, the stronger and more
physical Notre Dame players often stripped
the ball away.
"They stripped the ball free time and time
again," Montgomery said, noting that the Fight
ing Irish "took us out of our game with their ath
leticism and moved us around physically."
After the game, the players had another
closed-door meeting, and Williams said Mor
gan and others have made a "commitment to
be more aggressive" in upcoming games.
