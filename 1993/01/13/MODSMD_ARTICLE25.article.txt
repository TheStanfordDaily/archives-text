# Totally Crossed out: freshman ignites Stanford with 17 points
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Don't call him "Neon" just yet.
But freshman guard Dion
Cross did shed light on a stagnant
Stanford offense last night, com
ing off the bench to lead the Car
dinal in scoring.
The 6-foot-2 first-year player
from Little Rock, Ark., scored a
career-high 17 points in Stan
ford's 67-61 loss. In the first half,
Cross was a perfect four-of-four
from the field. Coach Mike Mont
gomery played him for eight min
utes in the opening period, in'
which Cross proceeded to drive in
for a layup, steal Notre Dame cen
ter Jon Ross' pass, hit a 15-foot
jumper from the right corner,
knock down a three-pointer, con
vert a baby hook in the lane, and
make another steal before return
ing to the sidelines.
"Dion went in and did what
he's capable of doing," Mont
gomery said. "Sometimes he
doesn't know what to do and
makes mistakes because he's a
freshman, but you've got to give
the kid credit for going out and
doing what he's supposed to do.
I'm glad someone's in there mak
ing some plays."
"As coach started playing me
more, my confidence started to
build," Cross said. "My first pri
ority is defense, and defense
becomes offense."
Montgomery inserted Cross
into the game again at the 15:53
mark of the second half, and
because of his strong play, Cross
stayed on the Maples Pavilion
floor for the remainder of the
game. He finished the evening an
impressive six-for-eight from the
field, including two-of-three
three-pointers.
"Dion Cross was tremendous,"
Notre Dame coach John MacLeod
said. "We were very concerned
about him and (Kenny) Hicks
coming off the bench. We couldn't
contain him and couldn't stop
him. He was very effective."
"He was great," Cardinal
guard Marcus Lollie added. "Dion
came out and did what he does in
practice — jump up and score the

ball."
Cross, though, kept his perfor
mance in perspective, placing the
team's success above his own.
"I felt very good about it (my
play), but it doesn't matter how
well you perform if you don't win
the game," Cross said.
With each game, Cross is gain
ing more experience, and improv
ing as a result. Montgomery has
recognized this progress and has
rewarded Cross with increased
playing time.
"I've got to give people oppor
tunities when they're earning
them, and he certainly is," Mont
gomery said.
Even though Cross is not as
heralded and has received signifi
cantly less media coverage than
crosstown freshman guard Jason
Kidd at California, Cross is more
than ready for a potential
matchup tomorrow night in
Berkeley.
"I'm looking forward to it,"
Cross said. "I'm tired of hearing
about Jason Kidd."
Tomorrow night, he'll get to
see Kidd close up.
