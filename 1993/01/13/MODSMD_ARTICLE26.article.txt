# A 						tribute to Ditka: Windy City will miss departed icon, hero
## 
### 
A week ago yesterday, a true tragedy
occurred in the Windy City, and
many are still in mourning. Mike
Ditka was fired as coach of the Chicago
Bears.
Ditka was more than just a Saturday
Night Live skit. He was, and is, the sym
bol of 'Da Bears in the modern era.
Who can forget his many sideline
tirades, from spitting gum on a fan to
swearing at the press to calling kicker
Kevin Butler "gutless" before Butler was
to attempt a game-winning field goal?
Ditka was hired by Papa Bear himself,
George Halas, and coached the Bears for
11 seasons.
Sure, he was tough on his players, but
he brought back the vision of what the
Bears had been in the "Monsters of the
Midway" days, for he had grown up expe
riencing that brand of football. In 1963,
Ditka was the tight end on the Bears
championship team.
Under Ditka's leadership, the Bears
won the NFC Central Division title six
times and advanced to three NFC Cham
pionship games. In his greatest triumph,
he led the team to a 46-10 victory in

Super Bowl XX following the 1985 season.
This year, the Bears had a less-than
successful season, posting a 5-11 mark.
But this was hardly reason to fire him.

After all, only a year ago, the Bears were
11-5. The Super Bowl title was a mere
seven years ago, and that is only yester
day in Chicago years. Chicagoans will be
able to talk about that victory for anoth
er 25 years before they can complain
about not being in the Super Bowl.

Chicago already has one winning team
right now in the Bulls, and Chicagoans
have no right to get greedy. It just isn't in
the City of Big Shoulders' contract to
have more than one winning team at any
given time.
That's why, as painful as it may be,
until Michael Jordan retires, Cubs fans
cannot even think about a National
League pennant.
But no matter what the Bulls do, there
is no comparison in Chicago between their
level of popularity and that of 'Da Bears.
If Ditka had been fired on the same day
that the Bulls won the NBA title, Ditka
would have been the front page news.
To the majority of Bears fans, Ditka
was a deity. WTien 'Da Bears Superfans
on Saturday Night Live concluded that
the result of a hypothetical matchup
between Ditka and God would be "Ditka
27, God 17," they weren't kidding.
But what of "Iron Mike"? His coaching
style is not outdated. The problem is that
he hasn't had the talent to win. The players
that embodied the Bears of the '80s — Wal
ter Payton, Wilbur Marshall, Mike Single
tary and even Jim McMahon—are gone.

Everyone complained that the Bears
had no team speed this year. That speed
could have been found in Willie Gault,
whom management let go several years ago
to the Los Angeles Raiders.
Michael McCaskey, president of the
Bears, is known throughout Chicago as a
cheapskate. He refuses to pay for players
with the potential to dominate the NFL.
All of the Tom Waddle's and Glen
Kozlowski's of the world don't add up to
Jerry Rice, Michael Irvin or even Ed
McCaffrey. They can work real hard, but
let's face it — they just aren't very good.
Instead, Ditka was stuck with
mediocre players such as quarterback
Jim Harbaugh and defensive lineman
Trace Armstrong.
The responsibility for the Bears demise
this season has to rest with management.
Ditka was one of the few coaches in the
league who was not allowed to have input
on personnel decisions. His style of coaching
did not change between this year and last;
he just did not have a good enough team.
Management made player decisions
based upon money. Three years ago,the
Bears had the number six pick and wast-

Ed that high pick on Mark Carrier only
because he had agreed to their low-ball
contract before the draft began.
But McCaskey can't fire himself, leav
ing him with only one other person to
blame — Ditka.
Where else will McCaskey find a coach
who uses enough mousse to withstand
the winds of Lake Michigan descending
on Soldier Field?
Ditka is truly a great American and
was one of the top five coaches in the
league, perhaps even the top three.
To fire him would be like firing Bobby
Knight at Indiana. Who would even con
sider it, much less actually do it?
To think of Ditka coaching some
where else is unfathomable. He is
Chicago.

Howard Libit is a native Chicagoan who
thinks that there are three seasons —
Bears, Bulls and Cubs. David Schwartz
is a Chicagoan once-removed who contin
ues to suffer as a Cubs fan. They both
hope that the Bulls management doesn 7
follow the Bears' example and get rid of
its most popular Mike — Jordan.

able to talk about that victory for anoth
er 25 years before they can complain
about not being in the Super Bowl.

Chicago already has one winning team
right now in the Bulls, and Chicagoans
have no right to get greedy. It just isn't in
the City of Big Shoulders' contract to
have more than one winning team at any
given time.
That's why, as painful as it may be,
until Michael Jordan retires, Cubs fans
cannot even think about a National
League pennant.
But no matter what the Bulls do, there
is no comparison in Chicago between their
level of popularity and that of 'Da Bears.
If Ditka had been fired on the same day
that the Bulls won the NBA title, Ditka
would have been the front page news.
To the majority of Bears fans, Ditka
was a deity. WTien 'Da Bears Superfans
on Saturday Night Live concluded that
the result of a hypothetical matchup
between Ditka and God would be "Ditka
27, God 17," they weren't kidding.
But what of "Iron Mike"? His coaching
style is not outdated. The problem is that
he hasn't had the talent to win. The players
that embodied the Bears of the '80s — Wal
ter Payton, Wilbur Marshall, Mike Single
tary and even Jim McMahon—are gone.

Everyone complained that the Bears
had no team speed this year. That speed
could have been found in Willie Gault,
whom management let go several years ago
to the Los Angeles Raiders.
Michael McCaskey, president of the
Bears, is known throughout Chicago as a
cheapskate. He refuses to pay for players
with the potential to dominate the NFL.
All of the Tom Waddle's and Glen
Kozlowski's of the world don't add up to
Jerry Rice, Michael Irvin or even Ed
McCaffrey. They can work real hard, but
let's face it — they just aren't very good.
Instead, Ditka was stuck with
mediocre players such as quarterback
Jim Harbaugh and defensive lineman
Trace Armstrong.
The responsibility for the Bears demise
this season has to rest with management.
Ditka was one of the few coaches in the
league who was not allowed to have input
on personnel decisions. His style of coaching
did not change between this year and last;
he just did not have a good enough team.
Management made player decisions
based upon money. Three years ago,the
Bears had the number six pick and wast-

Ed that high pick on Mark Carrier only
because he had agreed to their low-ball
contract before the draft began.
But McCaskey can't fire himself, leav
ing him with only one other person to
blame — Ditka.
Where else will McCaskey find a coach
who uses enough mousse to withstand
the winds of Lake Michigan descending
on Soldier Field?
Ditka is truly a great American and
was one of the top five coaches in the
league, perhaps even the top three.
To fire him would be like firing Bobby
Knight at Indiana. Who would even con
sider it, much less actually do it?
To think of Ditka coaching some
where else is unfathomable. He is
Chicago.

Howard Libit is a native Chicagoan who
thinks that there are three seasons —
Bears, Bulls and Cubs. David Schwartz
is a Chicagoan once-removed who contin
ues to suffer as a Cubs fan. They both
hope that the Bulls management doesn 7
follow the Bears' example and get rid of
its most popular Mike — Jordan.
