# ASSU to Casper: 'Slow down':
## New conduct policy under fire by Senate 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night
strongly urged University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper and the Uni
versity Cabinet to delay action on
the new Policy on Unacceptable
Sexual Conduct, which will be pre
sented to the cabinet tomorrow.
The policy has been written and
revised for the past two years and
addresses sexual assault, harass
ment and other objectionable sex
ual behavior such as obscene
phone calls.
However, students were never
consulted during the writing and
formulation of the policy, accord
ing to Chair of the ASSU Universi
ty Relations Committee Derek
Miyahara, who authored the
unanimously approved bill.
Miyahara said the bill is not an
objection to the policy itself, which
has not been released. "I'd like to
send the message to the Universi
ty to slow down and let other
groups look at it,"he said.
He doesn't necessarily expect
Casper or the University Cabinet
to contact the Senate, Miyahara
said, but hopes students will be
consulted and can offer amend
ments.
Written by the University

Working Group on Unacceptable
Sexual Conduct, the policy must
be approved by the University
Cabinet and signed by Casper.
"We'd like to see students be
more involved in decision making,
especially in areas where it will af
fect students, and this is one of
those areas," Miyahara said.
Students are directly affected
by the policy, he said, and added
that it is especially important to
graduate students who often work
as teaching assistants and can be
considered employees of the Uni
versity.
"I don't think there was any
wide-spread consultation in this
area, and it's one that needs to be
addressed," Miyahara said. "If
this passes there will have been no
involvement of students at all."
The University began revising
its sexual harassment and sexual
assault policies two years ago
upon the recommendation of the
Sexual Assault Task Force, a now
defunct committee.
The sexual assault policy, after
clarification revisions, was adopt
ed by the University Cabinet and
former University President Don
ald Kennedy last year.
However, the policy was adopted
in order to comply with a Califor
nia state law mandating universi
ties to implement sexual assault
policies which list resources avail
able to students, faculty or staff
who are assaulted.
That policy, along with an

expanded version of the sexual
harassment policy, is included in
the comprehensive Policy on
Unacceptable Sexual Conduct.
Also at the meeting, graduate
senator Sanford Dickert informed
the Senate that the Memorial Audi
torium sound system has begun to
be installed and will be completed
by Feb. 1. He said the system will
first be used for the Flicks showing
of "Apocalypse Now."
