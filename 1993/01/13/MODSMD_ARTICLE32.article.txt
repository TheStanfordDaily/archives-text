"They Mutate, Diversify, and Escape!"
flashed across the big screen as part of James
Mullins* presentation, describing the "nasty"
AIDS virus. '
Mullins, chair of the Microbiology and
Immunology Department in the School of
Medicine, said that these three words are his
"shortened version of what the AIDS viruses
do" with a host body.
Along with 10 other AIDS specialists,
Mullins participated in a campus conference
yesterday, called "AIDS: Infection, Gene Reg
ulation, Therapy."
Held in Fairchild Auditorium and co-spon
sored by Stanford's Center for AIDS
Research, the conference attracted California
based company representatives, interested
faculty and students.
Human Biology 142, the "Impact of AIDS"
class, had been cancelled so that students
could sit in on the conference. Chris Gonzales,
a student in this class, said that Prof. Robert

Siegel "encouraged us to go and said that
these were the best people in the field."
At the conference, University of Colorado's
Prof. Robert Schooley summarized the
progress of AIDS therapy as "slow, incom
plete, and difficult," with a need for much
deeper understanding.
Schooley, an expert on infectious diseases,
tried to end his spiel on a lighter note by
remarking that "Dan Quayle once said, 'If we
do not succeed, then we run the risk of fail
ure."
Mullins told the audience that therapy is
sometimes even ineffective, saying that virus
es can spread rapidly and transform from
"minimal pathogens to formidable
pathogens."
Virus spread is most rapid in Thailand and
Bombay, Mullins said, where prostitution is
prevalent.
Yvonne Maldonado, an assistant professor
of pediatrics at Stanford, added that in Thai
land and Bombay and other undeveloped
countries, the problem has reached huge pro
portions with no immediate cure in sight.

Sub-Saharan Africa has two-thirds of the
world's total AIDS cases, she said. The
scourge is projected to decrease population
growth by as much as 30 percent in that area
in the near future.
The key to lowering infection rates is pre
vention and education, Maldonado said,
although the future looks bleak since growth
rates for undeveloped countries "have not yet
reached a plateau."
Lawrence Corey of the University of Wash
ington said that he knows "no western indus
trialized country that has attempted to control
STDs" through education and similar means.
Therefore, unlike Maldonado's pre-infec
tion approach, Corey said he believes that the
only combat method must be "the develop
ment of vaccines."
Leonard Herzenberg, co-chair of the Medi
cal School, encouraged the audience members
to take action.
He said that the world of AIDS research is
"sorely lacking funds for clinical trial
research, cut by the Bush administration." He
said he "hopes for restoration" soon.
