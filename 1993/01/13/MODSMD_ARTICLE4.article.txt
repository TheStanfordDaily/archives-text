# Dropout no deadbeat, founds own company
## 
### Leena Prasad Staff writer 
The notion of being your own
boss is sexy, but running your own
company requires a marriage of
extraordinary commitments.
"When you start a new company,
the odds are that you are going to
fail," said Joe liemandt. "I had to do
it because I couldn't imagine doing
anything else. That's what you have
to ask yourself."
Liemandt, 24, is the president and
chief executive officer of a multi-mil
lion dollar company, Trilogy Develop
ment Group. Trilogy, which has its
headquarters in Austin, Texas, cur
rently employs around 60 personnel,
and will be expanding to over 100.
While a Stanford University
student in 1989, he founded the

company with five other Stanford
students. He left Stanford before
graduating. In an interview with
the Wall Street Journal he said,
"It's hard to focus on your next
Spanish exam when you have a
$500 million idea."
Liemandt realized his entre
preneurial skills while a high
school student. While a symbolic
systems major, he started a data
base company called 4th Connec
tion. This company brought him
in contact with several high-tech
companies, including the telecom
munications company 3Com.
4th Connection developed and
presented a prototype of Sales
BUILDER to 3Com, which decided to
build it themselves instead of giving
the job to Liemandt's company.
Not discouraged by this initial
failure, Liemandt asked some
people from 4th Connection and a
few friends to contact manufac
turing companies.
"Because of Stanford's name
and reputation, you can simply
call people up and say 'I'm work
ing on a senior project and we'd
like to see if it's useful, and I'd
like to ask you a few questions,'"
Liemandt said.
After feeling out the field, Lie
mandt said he found that a soft
ware package like SaIesBUILDER
would be in demand with many
manufacturing companies.
"If you have a widget, and they
want a wadget, build a wadget,"
Liemandt said. "If you have to
convince people that they need
your product, you shouldn't waste
your time in making the product."
Novel, another company,
expressed an interest in seeing the
SaIesBUILDER prototype devel
oped into a product, so Liemandt
set to work. He incorporated Trilo
gy, recruiting five other students.
After working 100 hours a
week for six months, the Trilogy
founders had a product. Novel
changed its mind, however, and
decided not to buy Sales-
BUILDER.
They then contacted the semi

conductor manufacturer LSI.
"We convinced LSI that we could
provide what they had in mind," said
Liemandt. Another six months of
development work produced a ver
sion of the SaIesBIJILDER which
LSI bought, thus becoming Trilogy's
first customer.
"It was an unparalleled learning
and professional opportunity," said
Christi Jones, who worked until 6
a.m. during three weeks of spring
break to meet the project deadline.
She is now the Director of Market
ing at Trilogy.
Seth Stratton, Chris Porch, John
Lynch and Tom Carter were the
other four initial key players. Except
for Seth Stratton, the original team
is still supporting Liemandt.
"John Lynch, who is now the head
of development at Trilogy, lived in a
garage for 18 months while working
on Trilogy," Liemandt said. "We
shared apartments. We missed pay
roll. I was so far in debt, I didn't have
a choice but to keep going."
A combination of not being able
to turn back and having the stamina
to keep going forward resulted in the
eventual success of the company.
Liemandt said that a would-be
entrepreneur needs many special
qualities. "You have to have perse
verance, enthusiasm, cheerleading
skills and drive. The overriding
thing is the drive and flexibility and
goal-orientation- 'we have to do
this, we will figure out a way.'"
Choosing the right product was
a big part of their strategy for suc
cess. "When I was at Stanford, I

took a New Enterprise class. We
were going to build a better spread
sheet. I thought it was the greatest
idea," said Liemandt.
"Looking back, that's a bad
idea," he added. "You can't do
something if somebody else is
already there, unless you are a big
company and can afford three revi
sions like Microsoft did with MS-
Windows.
"Big companies can afford to
make mistakes," he continued.
When asked for advice on starting
a company, he replied, "Find an
area with no competition. Make
the idea so good that there is
nobody there. "
Another key factor is funding.
Even though many companies
want the SaIesBUILDER now
and said they wanted it when it
was being developed, few would
have supported the initial devel
opment, Liemandt said.
"I sold shares to partners in a
consulting group at Stanford. I
had 30 credit-cards which were
maxed out to the hilt."
But Trilogy didn't go under.
The company's goal is to conquer
65 percent of the manufacturing
market.
"When we talked to people
they said, 'if you can build it, we'll
buy it.' Once they are convinced
that it'll work, over 90 percent of
them become customers," he said.
Liemandt said he still puts in
100 hours per week. "It's not a
chore anymore. There's less
anxiety."

Seth Stratton, Chris Porch, John
Lynch and Tom Carter were the
other four initial key players. Except
for Seth Stratton, the original team
is still supporting Liemandt.
"John Lynch, who is now the head
of development at Trilogy, lived in a
garage for 18 months while working
on Trilogy," Liemandt said. "We
shared apartments. We missed pay
roll. I was so far in debt, I didn't have
a choice but to keep going."
A combination of not being able
to turn back and having the stamina
to keep going forward resulted in the
eventual success of the company.
Liemandt said that a would-be
entrepreneur needs many special
qualities. "You have to have perse
verance, enthusiasm, cheerleading
skills and drive. The overriding
thing is the drive and flexibility and
goal-orientation- 'we have to do
this, we will figure out a way.'"
Choosing the right product was
a big part of their strategy for suc
cess. "When I was at Stanford, I

took a New Enterprise class. We
were going to build a better spread
sheet. I thought it was the greatest
idea," said Liemandt.
"Looking back, that's a bad
idea," he added. "You can't do
something if somebody else is
already there, unless you are a big
company and can afford three revi
sions like Microsoft did with MS-
Windows.
"Big companies can afford to
make mistakes," he continued.
When asked for advice on starting
a company, he replied, "Find an
area with no competition. Make
the idea so good that there is
nobody there. "
Another key factor is funding.
Even though many companies
want the SaIesBUILDER now
and said they wanted it when it
was being developed, few would
have supported the initial devel
opment, Liemandt said.
"I sold shares to partners in a
consulting group at Stanford. I
had 30 credit-cards which were
maxed out to the hilt."
But Trilogy didn't go under.
The company's goal is to conquer
65 percent of the manufacturing
market.
"When we talked to people
they said, 'if you can build it, we'll
buy it.' Once they are convinced
that it'll work, over 90 percent of
them become customers," he said.
Liemandt said he still puts in
100 hours per week. "It's not a
chore anymore. There's less
anxiety."
The notion of being your own
boss is sexy, but running your own
company requires a marriage of
extraordinary commitments.
"When you start a new company,
the odds are that you are going to
fail," said Joe liemandt. "I had to do
it because I couldn't imagine doing
anything else. That's what you have
to ask yourself."
Liemandt, 24, is the president and
chief executive officer of a multi-mil
lion dollar company, Trilogy Develop
ment Group. Trilogy, which has its
headquarters in Austin, Texas, cur
rently employs around 60 personnel,
and will be expanding to over 100.
While a Stanford University
student in 1989, he founded the

company with five other Stanford
students. He left Stanford before
graduating. In an interview with
the Wall Street Journal he said,
"It's hard to focus on your next
Spanish exam when you have a
$500 million idea."
Liemandt realized his entre
preneurial skills while a high
school student. While a symbolic
systems major, he started a data
base company called 4th Connec
tion. This company brought him
in contact with several high-tech
companies, including the telecom
munications company 3Com.
4th Connection developed and
presented a prototype of Sales
BUILDER to 3Com, which decided to
build it themselves instead of giving
the job to Liemandt's company.
Not discouraged by this initial
failure, Liemandt asked some
people from 4th Connection and a
few friends to contact manufac
turing companies.
"Because of Stanford's name
and reputation, you can simply
call people up and say 'I'm work
ing on a senior project and we'd
like to see if it's useful, and I'd
like to ask you a few questions,'"
Liemandt said.
After feeling out the field, Lie
mandt said he found that a soft
ware package like SaIesBUILDER
would be in demand with many
manufacturing companies.
"If you have a widget, and they
want a wadget, build a wadget,"
Liemandt said. "If you have to
convince people that they need
your product, you shouldn't waste
your time in making the product."
Novel, another company,
expressed an interest in seeing the
SaIesBUILDER prototype devel
oped into a product, so Liemandt
set to work. He incorporated Trilo
gy, recruiting five other students.
After working 100 hours a
week for six months, the Trilogy
founders had a product. Novel
changed its mind, however, and
decided not to buy Sales-
BUILDER.
They then contacted the semi

conductor manufacturer LSI.
"We convinced LSI that we could
provide what they had in mind," said
Liemandt. Another six months of
development work produced a ver
sion of the SaIesBIJILDER which
LSI bought, thus becoming Trilogy's
first customer.
"It was an unparalleled learning
and professional opportunity," said
Christi Jones, who worked until 6
a.m. during three weeks of spring
break to meet the project deadline.
She is now the Director of Market
ing at Trilogy.
