# Congressional committee to scrutinize Christopher on spying
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Secretary of
State-designate Warren Christopher, a
Stanford trustee, will likely be grilled by
members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee about his knowledge of Army
spying on 1960s civil rights leaders during
his confirmation hearing today.
On Sunday, The Associated Press re
ported that Christopher's personal files
from when he was deputy attorney gener
al in 1968 indicate he knew about Army
surveillance on civil rights and anti-war
activists even though he later told Con
gress he wasn't aware of the activities.
The committee is awaiting a written re
sponse from Christopher as to whether he
misled Congress 15 years ago about his
knowledge of the surveillance.

"The staff wants a full explanation of
any inconsistencies," a Senate panel
source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
Christopher, a Los Angeles corporate
lawyer, graduated from Stanford Law
School in 1949 and is in his fourth term on
the University's Board of Trustees. He
was the board's president from 1985-88.
The source said the committee's staff
was sending the Clinton transition team
copies of the intelligence summaries and
memos that The AP found in Christo
pher's personal files at the Lyndon B.
Johnson archives in Austin, Texas. It may
also seek to interview some authors of the
memos, the source said.
Christopher told the same committee

in 1977, when he was being confirmed as
President Carter's deputy secretary of
state, that he hadn't known the Army
placed civil rights activists and anti-war
demonstrators under surveillance in the
late 19605.
But the documents show Christopher
received Army intelligence reports on Viet
nam War protesters and civil rights ac
tivists such as followers of Martin Luther
King Jr.
There are at least 67 intelligence sum
maries and other documents in Christo
pher's Johnson library files relating to
civil disturbances that are unavailable for
public inspection because they are classi
fied due to national security or privacy.
The committee staff has never reviewed

the Johnson library files and is currently
pressing to do so.
Both Republican and Democratic com
mittee staffers said they hoped the files
would shed new light on what Christopher
knew.
Whatever is found among the classified
papers, Republicans said they planned to
particularly question Christopher about
one 1968 memo from a Justice aide that
informed Christopher that Army "opera
tives" were the "main source of intelli
gence" on civil rights and anti-war ac
tivists in Washington.
Christopher's initials were scribbled
on that document, discovered by The AP
at the Johnson library, with a notation
"Noted."

The national security spokesman for
the Clinton transition team said Sunday
that Christopher would not comment.
But the spokesman, who insisted that he
not be identified by name, said the docu
ments "do not alter Mr. Christopher's rec
ollection."
He reiterated that Christopher stood
by his testimony to the Senate panel in
1977 that he had "no knowledge that the
U.S. Army was engaged in surveillance or
other covert activity."
An aide to the late Sen. Jacob Javits, R-
N.Y., who questioned Christopher about
the activities at the 1977 hearing, said the
documents were not available to Congress
