## Foreign scholars bring total to three 
### Matthew Gregory 
Seniors Siddhartha Mukherjee
and Fayyaz Nurmohamed have
been named Rhodes Scholars rep
resenting their respective home
countries of India and Canada,
bringing the total number of Stan
ford winners this year to three.
Mukherjee, a biology major
who is also in the Program in
Ethics and Society, is the first In
dian Rhodes Scholar whose under
graduate studies were outside of
his country. "I'd always thought
about applying for the Rhodes," he
said. "In India, it's very big; it's
something that you hear about a
lot."
After completing the initial ap
plication, Mukherjee was offered a
preliminary interview, which was
conducted by telephone in early
November. A few weeks later, he
learned he had been picked as one
of 16 finalists and was invited to
New Delhi for a more in-depth in
terview.
The final interviews, however,

were postponed by religious riot
ing that kept several finalists from
attending. On the morning of Jan.
3, three weeks after originally
scheduled, interviews were finally
held. The four winners were an
nounced later in the day.
At Oxford, Mukheijee plans to
get a master's degree in biology or
biochemistry. After that, "defi
nitely a Ph.D. in biochemistry and
immunology. ... I might go to
medical school as well."
Eventually, he would like to be
come a researcher and teach.
Mukheijee has worked since the
summer after his sophomore year
with Biochemistry Prof. Paul
Berg, investigating the link be
tween a particular human nuclear
oncogene and cancer.
He said he hopes to be able to
continue his research at Oxford,
but thinks that might be difficult.
"You have to find a faculty mem
ber with similar interests," he
said.
A resident assistant in Ham
marskjold, Mukherjee was also a

teaching assistant in cellular neu
roscience last quarter. He studies
Indian vocal music in his spare
time and has won several awards
during his Stanford career, includ
ing the President's Award for Aca
demic Excellence.
History mtyor Nurmohamed
plans to pursue a master of philos
ophy in Middle Eastern History at

Oxford. "I am a Muslim, and so
Islam and the Islamic world has al
ways been of great interest to me,"
he said.
"It is a specific program, al
though the Oxford system does
allow for a wide latitude in terms
of tailoring one's program to one's
needs. I do plan on carving out my
own niche."

Currently, Nurmohamed is
writing an honors thesis on the
modern history of the Shia Ismaili
sect and is a member of the Stan
ford Middle East focus group.
Nurmohamed applied for the
Rhodes at the suggestion of his ad
viser, History Prof. Joel Beinin.
He was invited to British Colum
bia for an interview Dec. 5. Later
that day, Nurmohamed learned he
was one of Canada's eleven
Rhodes scholars.
Moving to England should be
no problem for globe-trotter Nur
mohamed, who was born in
Kenya, attended high school in
Italy and now lives in Vancouver.
Nurmohamed said he is uncer
tain what he will do after getting
his master's degree. "Perhaps
academia, perhaps a D. Phil.,
maybe law school. I'm not sure, all
options are open in my mind.
"If further graduate work is in
order, I'll probably come back to
the United States. Eventually I'd
like to see myself in Canada, possi
ble Vancouver."
Senior Erez Kalir, a U.S. citi
zen, was also named a Rhodes
scholar in early December.
