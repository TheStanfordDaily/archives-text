Carrying placards, red and
green balloons and a banner read
ing "Keep King's Dream Alive,"
about 30 children marched along
Escondido Road yesterday after
noon to celebrate Martin Luther
King, Jr.'s birthday.
During the "Children's
March for Peace and Justice,"
children from schools in East
Palo Alto, Menlo Park and
Atherton chanted "Stop the Vio
lence" and "A mind is a terrible
thing to waste."
Braving the cold, rainy
weather, the children marched
to Kresge Auditorium, attract
ing the attention and stares of
bicyclists and walkers, some of

whom chanted slogans along
with the marchers and applaud
ed their efforts.
The march is a 6-year-old
Stanford tradition which in past
years was limited to Escondido
Village. This year marks the first
time the event has crossed Cam
pus Drive.
Many of the children, who
ranged in age from six to 18, came
to the program with their school
mates and teachers. Once inside
the auditorium, the children
spoke of what King's message
meant to them and of their hopes
for racial equality in the future.
"I think we should celebrate
Martin Luther King's birthday
because we celebrate George
