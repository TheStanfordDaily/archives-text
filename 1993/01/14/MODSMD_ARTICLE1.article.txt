### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Carrying placards, red and
green balloons and a banner read
ing "Keep King's Dream Alive,"
about 30 children marched along
Escondido Road yesterday after
noon to celebrate Martin Luther
King, Jr.'s birthday.
During the "Children's
March for Peace and Justice,"
children from schools in East
Palo Alto, Menlo Park and
Atherton chanted "Stop the Vio
lence" and "A mind is a terrible
thing to waste."
Braving the cold, rainy
weather, the children marched
to Kresge Auditorium, attract
ing the attention and stares of
bicyclists and walkers, some of

whom chanted slogans along
with the marchers and applaud
ed their efforts.
The march is a 6-year-old
Stanford tradition which in past
years was limited to Escondido
Village. This year marks the first
time the event has crossed Cam
pus Drive.
Many of the children, who
ranged in age from six to 18, came
to the program with their school
mates and teachers. Once inside
the auditorium, the children
spoke of what King's message
meant to them and of their hopes
for racial equality in the future.
"I think we should celebrate
Martin Luther King's birthday
because we celebrate George

coln's birthday land] because he
started civil rights," explained
John Myers, a 9-year-old who
lives in Escondido Village.
Camari Francisco, a 12-year
old, said she had seen pictures of
King and that "the thing that
stands out to me about Martin
Luther King is his smile — he
didn't have one."
"If everyone would work
together on problems (of racism),
I believe Dr. Martin Luther King
would be smiling," she said,
adding that problems like drugs
and crime keep the black leader
frowning.
Rev. Floyd Thompkins, the asso
ciate dean of Memorial Church,
facilitated the program. He began
by reminding the audience of the
need to "celebrate the dream."
Between every child's speech, he
had the audience repeat a part of
King's "I Have a Dream" speech
aloud. The phrases, "I believe in the
dream. I am the dream," echoed
throughout the auditorium.
Summer Butler, a student in
the Upward Bound tutoring pro
gram, spoke of her pride in King's
accomplishments.
"Dr. King's movement makes
me proud to be an African-Ameri
can. It gives me hope, freedom,
pride and opportunity," she said.
"Sometimes I wonder what the
world would be like if Dr. King

had lived. We have not yet experi
enced all of his dreams, but I
dream that one day we will."
The children were joined by
about 30 adults and Stanford stu
dents as they watched a perfor
mance of the Kuumba Dance
Ensemble and sang the black
national anthem, "Lift Every
Voice and Sing."
At one point in the program,
Thompkins called for the children
to honor the six teachers in the
room. "Out of all the rhetoric, only
a few people work with children
and they are special," he said.
In addition to the children,
sophomore Jomo Graham, a
member of Stanford's Black Stu
dent Union, spoke on the history
of the civil rights movement and
King's legacy.
Thompkins concluded the pro
gram by saying he hoped that one
day the color of one's skin would
no longer be cause for hatred and
"no child shall be called anything
but beautiful."
Although the march was origi
nally intended to end outside the
Law School, Barbara Smith, the
acting director of the Black Com
munity Services Center, said the
continuous rain had forced the
coordinators of the march to find
an indoor facility.
However, the change in facility
may have deterred some Stanford
students from attending since
they could not find the program.
Sophomore Kendall Bentz said he
almost missed the event because
there was no publicity about the
change in location.
