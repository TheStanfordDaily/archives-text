## 
### Eileen Schnabel 
Wongda "Harry" Wu, a for
mer political prisoner who spent
19 years in a Chinese prison
labor camp, told scholars at the
Hoover Institution yesterday
that he has documented more
than 1,000 such labor camps
currently existing in China.
WTiile the precise number of
prison camps is a state secret,
said Wu, a Hoover research fel
low, he estimated that total
number may be closer to 3,000.
He said there are more than 10
million people currently held in
such camps.
"If China is part of the
human society, we must think
about this," he said.
Wu's presentation, titled
"Labor Makes You New Born:
Laogai — The Chinese Gulag"
described his own past experi
ences as well as the current sit
uation in China.
Wu was arrested in 1960
after denouncing the Chinese
Communist party during a
1957 meeting. After being
labeled a "capitalistic rightist"
and "a public enemy of the
Communist party," he was
placed in a prison camp where

he remained until 1979.
The camps, Wu said, provide
not only political "re-educa
tion," but are also profit cen
ters, providing cheap labor to
produce goods for domestic and
international markets.
Wu showed slides of prison
ers working naked in tubs of
chemicals used to treat lamb
skins. He said he took the pho
tos with a hidden camera as he
toured camps under the guise
of a foreign investor.
According to Wu, both Amer
ican and Japanese businesses
purchase products manufac
tured in these camps..
In addition, Wu showed
slides of Russian Gulags and
Nazi concentration camps he
visited last year. He pointed
out the similarities in the
atrocities of those camps and
the Chinese ones.
"How come we have a differ
ent standards?" Wu asked. "We
condemn the Nazi concentration
camps and the Russian Gulags.
The Chinese are also human
beings."
Wu has authored a book on
the labor camps and is current
ly writing about the Chinese
prison system.
