# Abortion protests protected

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fed
eral judges cannot stop protesters
who try to block women's access
to abortion clinics, the Supreme
Court ruled yesterday.
The 5-4 decision, a victory for
Operation Rescue and other anti
abortion protesters, means clinic
operators must turn to state courts
for help in thwarting blockades.
Abortion-rights advocates said
they will look to Congress to provide
new legal protection, and also to
President-elect Clinton. A president
has the power to order federal pro
tection without a court injunction.
On Capitol Hill, Reps. Charles
E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., said they will
introduce bills to overcome the
decision.
"The bill will make sure that

radical right-to-lifers using terror
tactics outside clinics won't be
able to take away a woman's con
stitutional right to abortion,"
Schumer said.
The ruling does not alter the
core constitutional right of abor
tion, reaffirmed by the court in a
landmark decision last June.
At issue, instead, was the Ku
Klux Klan Act of 1871 and its ban
on conspiracies aimed at violating
the constitutional rights of a
"protected class" of people.
The court, ruling in a case from
Virginia, said the 1871 law does
not apply to those who participate
in abortion blockades because
women seeking abortions are not
part of such a protected class.
"Whatever one thinks of abor
tion, it cannot be denied that there

are common and respectable rea
sons for opposing it, other than
hatred of or condescension toward .
. . women," Justice Antonin Scalia
wrote for the court.
In dissent, Justice John Paul
Stevens said the blockades present
a striking contemporary example
of the kind of zealous, politically
motivated, lawless conduct that led
to enactment of the Ku Klux Klan
Act."
Justices Harry A. Blackmun,
John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day
O'Connor dissented, and Justice
David H. Souter dissented in part.
Souter provided a sixth vote for
finding that women seeking abor
tions are not protected under one
part of the 1871 law but said he
sometimes would allow federal
court intervention.
