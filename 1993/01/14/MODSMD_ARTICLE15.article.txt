# Clinton eyes benefit programs
## Growing deficit may cause cuts in Social Security, Medicare 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
elect Bill Clinton is eyeing $750 billion
worth of popular benefit programs for
possible budget cuts. But glaring right
back at him are tens of millions of voters
who rely on them.
In recent days, Clinton's economic
team has acknowledged it is consider
ing taking the budget knife to pro
grams such as Social Security and
Medicare — huge, growing and danger
ous targets for a politician to attack. So
far, Clinton aides say they have made
no decisions.
"It's going to call for courageous and
tough stands by the president," conceded
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, Clinton's
Treasury secretary-designate, at his Sen
ate confirmation hearing this week. "And
I believe you're going to get them."
That's exactly what it will take. For
while fat abounds in these benefit pro
grams — which are half the govern
ment's $1.5 trillion annual budget — so
do the number of Americans who don't
want their coverage reduced.
For example:

• Social Security is expected to cost
$319 billion in fiscal 1994, making it by
far the biggest program in the entire
budget. But 40 million elderly people
and injured workers collect monthly
Social Security checks — and older
Americans are one of the country's most
potent blocs of voters.
• Medicare, bearing a $148 billion
price tag next year, is expected to grow
11 percent annually, according to the
Office of Management and Budget. It
helps 35 million elderly and handi
capped people pay their medical bills.
• Medicaid, costing $93 billion next
year, will expand by more than 11 percent
a year. The program helps pay for doctors'
care for 30 million poor Americans — one
of the Democrats' chief constituencies.
• The government pays $60 billion a
year to 3 million federal civilian and
military retirees. It also distributes $20
billion annually in veterans' benefits
and $4 billion for guaranteed student
loans.
Medicare and Medicaid are consid
ered the likeliest targets for savings

because they are growing so rapidly,
accounting for 85 percent of the growth
of all benefit programs, the Congres
sional Budget Office said.
"The health care programs are grow
ing so rapidly that the growth is unsus
tainable," Alice Rivlin, chosen to be
deputy director of Clinton's budget
office, said yesterday at her Senate con
firmation hearing.
She said trying to reduce their costs
would be "an early order of business."
But Clinton, Rivlin and others have
repeatedly said that the only way to control
Medicare and Medicaid costs is to reform
the nation's overall health care system.
Such a plan will take time to imple
ment. That leads many to believe that
Clinton's budget-cutting blueprint will
not count on savings in benefit pro
grams for a few years.
"I'd be surprised to see a deficit
reduction plan that relied heavily on
cuts in Medicare, Medicaid in the short
term," Senate Budget Committee
Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said
yesterday.
