## Save public schools 
### 
Vouchers alone will not
improve the weakening
educational foundation

AMERICA'S infrastructure is
in desperate need of a radical
overhaul. And not just the net
work of bridges and roads. Public
education has always been a corner
stone of this nation's democratic
foundations. Over the last decade
those foundations have weakened to
a dangerous level. Mere cosmetic
repairs will not begin to approach the
gravity of this crisis.
Everyone has heard the stagger
ing statistics that bear witness to
the public school system's inability
to grant even the most remedial
education to millions of young
Americans. Quite simply, it has
grossly failed in its mission. When a
single 18 year old can graduate from
high school and not be capable of
reading at even a fourth grade level,
something drastic has to be done.
If there is to be hope, the govern
ment will have to consider some of
the many innovative approaches to
restructuring education that have
recently gained momentum.
Bureaucratic inertia from the fed
eral level on down must be over
come. The Department of Educa
tion and Congress have consistent
ly been opposed to adopting even
incremental change. Often cited is
the fear that some students may be
left out if school systems are
thrown open to parental choice or
other such programs.
But as things stand, millions of
kids are already being left out.The
recent announcement that Presi
dent-elect Bill Clinton's daughter
Chelsea will attend a private school
in Washington, D.C. rather than a
public one is testimony to the inad
equacy of inner-city public schools.
Critics have charged that Clinton
essentially "sold-out" by spurning a
public education for his daughter. If
the Washington D.C. school system
is not good enough for the Presi

dent's daughter, they ask, how can it
be good enough for anyone's child?
But condemning the Clintons
for what ultimately is a very per
sonal decision isn't fair. Clinton is
indeed, or will be next week, this
nation's President. But he is also a
husband and a father, who has the
obligation to give his daughter the
very best that he can provide. If
the Clintons feel more comfortable
as a family sending their daughter
to a small, intimate private school,
that is their right as Americans.
Their decision, however, does
send a powerful message to all
Americans, whether their children
are in private or public schools:
Something drastic has to be done to
overhaul this country's educational
system, and done quickly. A whole
generation may be lost to ignorance
and condemned to a life of welfare
or dead-end, low-paying jobs.
Republicans have seized upon
the recent Clinton episode as
resounding proof for the necessity
of a national voucher system in
which the government would pay
for a child to attend a private or
parochial school. While such a sys
tem is an innovative method wor
thy of careful consideration, it is a
limited one in the overall picture.
Currently, only 12 percent of Amer
ican children attend such schools. A
successful voucher system, at best,
would double that number.
Clearly, rejecting the public
school system altogether is not a
feasible solution. Opening school
districts to parental choice, howev
er, seems like one of the more
promising options. When parents
and students choose, tliey feel a
sense of community, ownership
and identity with their particular
school, traits which are critical for
morale and, ultimately, for success.
Clinton strongly endorsed such
educational reforms during his
campaign. Though his daughter
may no longer attend a public
school, he himself is a product of
such a system and, more impor
tantly, a committed advocate. His
challenge now is to prove this
commitment.
