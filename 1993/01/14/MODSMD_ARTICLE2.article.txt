# Conduct policy to be presented for discussion
## Officials contest ASSU claim of student exclusion 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
In response to the ASSU's complaints
yesterday about the lack of student input to
ward the new Policy on Unacceptable Sexu
al Conduct, the Work Group responsible for
crafting the policy will present it to the Uni
versity Cabinet today for discussion rather
than approval.
However, members of the group say the
ASSU Senate's claim that no students were
involved in the process is unfounded and that
there was no intent to exclude students. But
the senator who recommended the delay
stood by his objection, saying he was ap
proached by students who believed their voic
es were not being heard by administrators.
The new Policy on Unacceptable Sexual
Conduct incorporates the sexual assault
policy that was written last year and an up
dated version of the University's sexual ha

rassment policy into a single, overarching
policy that attempts to clarify both informal
and formal grievance procedures.
Although the policy has been in the
works for more than two years, its approval
will be further delayed to allow students
who felt they did not have a chance to con
tribute to the policy to do so, group member
Sharon Parker said.
After the ASSU Senate urged University
President Gerhard Casper to delay action on
the policy, the group could have pulled the
policy from the University Cabinet's agen
da, but decided to "go ahead and have a dis
cussion with the cabinet," said Parker, di
rector of the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment.
"We have a draft we want them to see,"
she said. "The University Cabinet may
choose to approve it — which I doubt they
would — or they can use it as an
opportunity to contact student
groups."
Parker refuted the Senate's
claim that students were shut out
of the loop on the policy.
"A whole lot of dialogue" with
students took place during the
process, Parker said. But because
a substantial amount of time
passed between the formation of
the group and the completion of
the policy, many of the students
consulted have graduated or are
no longer involved in certain stu
dent groups.
For example, Parker said last
year's Coordinator of Student
Sexual Assault Prevention Educa
tion, Susan Epstein, brought in
many student concerns that she
had encountered in her work.
But ASSU Senator Derek
Miyahara, who authored yester
day's bill recommending a delay,
said that regardless of whether

some student input was solicited,
"There is a perception on the part
of some students that there
hadn't been enough consultation.
And for me that was enough."
Miyahara, who based his bill on
the concerns of a few students
who approached him, said the bill
was not a comment on the policy
itself — since he hasn't even seen
it — but an objection to the pro
cess by which it was crafted.
"It's not that I think that
because 1 haven't seen it there
hasn't been enough consulta
tion," Miyahara continued. "I
don't have to see everything. But
I do believe the student govern
ment is one of the few places
where students who have these
concerns can go.
"It's up to us to go to bat for
students in those situations. I
stand behind our actions."
Broadening the scope
Members of the group that
crafted the conduct policy hope
the discussion at today's Cabinet
meeting will center less on the
policy — which is "the least con

troversial" component of the
group's report, according to Park
er — and more on an additional
set of recommendations that the
group has written.
The recommendations —
which call for the establishment
of a panel specifically trained to
deal with cases of unacceptable
sexual conduct, a Resource Cen
ter on Unacceptable Sexual Con
duct and various sensitivity, self
defense and assertiveness-train
ing workshops — are not being
submitted for approval, but they
are "strong recommendations
that are essential to the policy,"
Parker said.
If the cabinet eventually
approves the policy, it is with the
understanding that the recom
mendations will be given serious
consideration, Parker said.
The new policy broadens the
scope of the sexual assault and
harassment policies, and also
seeks to clarify sections of the
harassment policy, originally
written in May 1987, that may
have been unclear, said group
member and deputy manager of

Employee Relations Doug Dupen.
The idea for the broad conduct
policy originated with the release
of the Sexual Assault Task Force
Report two years ago.
The report recommended,
among other things, the creation
of a single University policy cover
ing the continuum of unaccept
able sexual behavior, including
sexual harassment, sexual
assault, gender-based discrimina
tion and other acts, such as
obscene phone calls and the dis
play of offensive photos in the
workplace.
Since then, the Work Group
has been moving steadily in that
direction — releasing the Univer
sity Policy on Sexual Assault last
January to comply with state law
— although the entire process has
taken much longer than adminis
trators initially projected.
The original sexual harass
ment and sexual assault policies
were written "rapidly but not
hastily," and the group "brought
them up to date" in the new poli
cy, said Dupen.
The revised policy seeks to

more clearly define both the infor
mal procedures and the formal
grievance process for reporting
sexual harassment. It creates a
set of tables which show the
options available to students, fac
ulty and staff in reporting unac
ceptable sexual conduct, Dupen
said.
However, the new policy does
not alter the procedures for filing
a grievance, which students say
are insufficient and difficult to
understand.
Third-year history graduate
student Renee Romano said she,
as well as other students, thought
the formal grievance procedure
required victims to directly con
front their perpetrator, which
may have discouraged victims
from reporting harassment.
The University's guidelines for
student grievances outline the
first step as, "The student first
should discuss the perceived
offense, orally or in writing, with
the individual(s) most directly
responsible."
While some students believed
that the "individual most directlv

responsible" referred to the per
petrator, Parker asserted that the
policy has always defined the
"individual most directly respon
sible" as the dean of the school.
However, Randi Engle, a sec
ond-year Ph.D. student in the
School of Education, said that
even if administrators intend one
interpretation of a policy, most
students make assumptions on
policy based on what they read or
are told by peers.
The new policy also uses
"stronger wording" regarding
confidentiality of victims. While
the original policy called for hon
oring confidentiality, it did so in
relatively vague terms.
The new policy states, "The
University will not provide infor
mation to the press, parents or
others identifying a person who
has made a complaint of unac
ceptable sexual conduct or identi
fying the subject of that com
plaint without the individual's
express consent."
