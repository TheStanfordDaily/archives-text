## Liquid nitrogen dreams 
### 
I WONDER IF I WOULD LIKE to par
ticipate in one of these — "death
freeze" experiments, where at the
time of my death I would be stuffed into
some icy medium or another, and either
remain forever blue and stiff, or success
fully awakened years later to tread once
again upon dear Mother Earth.
I could visit my children and grand
children with a melting smile, and spend
however many more years dreaming of
heaven from which I was forbidden for
my commitment to Science and Man.
And what a lovely funeral it would be:
my family and friends shuttled by jet
(funded by the government, of course) to
some obscure laboratory at the bottom of
Texas, an underground gathering
around my private and gigantic steel
canister the size of a grain silo. All the
meters and gauges are ticking away dur
ing the eulogies and sniffles, and no one
would be allowed to cry because any
trace of salt in the room might send the
whole system haywire.
No big deal that the service couldn't be
"open canister"— if all went according to
plan, I could be at my children's doorsteps
20 years later wearing the same clothes
and expression as I did when the lid was
screwed shut.
If you wanted to send flowers, you
could even risk a sense of humor and send
a straw and quarter-lime instead. But

most important of all, there had better be
a general consensus that my family and
friends want me to come back for the
first, second, third, whatever time it is: I
may go bad like even the best of beers sent
back to the fridge for a fifth recooling.
Death is a scary matter, but so is eter
nity — even an intermittent version of
it. So I'm left staring out the window at
all this rain, seeing in each water drop
imaginary ladders to some sort of par
adise where those before me are waiting,
and where I will wait for those who fol
low.
I guess I'd choose the everlasting over
the ever long-gone, but hopefully
through spiritual, not scientific, experi
ence. But still, wouldn't I get tired? And
frustrated at not being able to touch all
my loved ones as we swirl around each
other, inhaling our remembered hugs,
perfumes, sex?
I don't want to die. Not in the near
future, at least. At different times in the
last few years I've been practically blind
ed by the thought of it; One time I almost
fell down at the kitchen sink, another
time I almost crashed my car, and a few
weeks later I had to hurry myself to the
bathroom in the middle of a dinner party.
Maybe I'm just a freak. Or going
through a quarter-life crisis. Or maybe
everyone else knows exactly what I'm
talking about, with memories of their

own blinding incidents while alone or in
the company of family, friends, a lover or
two lovers (More than two lovers and
these days you have no choice but to fear
death, and its aftermath of Sunday night
television all about you).
And nothing is more real than the
moment of realization that soon you will be
gone from all of this. Kapoot. There's
always a certain tantalizing thrill to not
knowing what's coming to you, but in this
case, I think I want to know. No, no, I
don't. I'm too scared. Worm-infested obliv
ion? Endless hallways of fire? Song, dance
and reunion in meadows of cashmere?
Don't tell me if you know. Just leave me
hanging like the rest of the world has. We're
all left hanging. You've asked all the whys,
all the hows, and turned to the mirror,
photo album or people around you when
your room or patch of sky doesn't answer.
Answers schmanswers. The only alter
native to being here is not to be, and the
world wouldn't be so crowded if 1, i, 112 and
e didn't spell a good thing.
