Culture creates standards of beauty, sexuality

Brett rodgers' column in
the Jan. 4 issue of The Daily,
"Everybody's so beautiful," asks
ail important question, "What is beau
ty?" then answers that it is whatever
one finds beautiful.
Beauty is relative, he argues, so if
many men find women "with a slim
waist and an ample chest" most attrac
tive, who can blame them?
I can.
When Rodgers says "We don't expect
everyone to match these features," he
establishes a dangerous standard of
beauty that individuals — women in
particular — must struggle to "achieve."
There is nothing wrong with valuing
healthy bodies, but American women
are not supposed to be healthy, they're
supposed to be emaciated.
American women are bombarded
with images of super-thin women on
TV, in magazines and in lingerie ads.
Literally millions of American women

succumb to the pressure to conform by
fasting or purging to prevent themselves
from gaining weight. And those who do
not eat inadequate diets eat at their
social peril.
Rogers would have us believe that
"Sports Illustrated swimsuit models
aren't oppressing women," but in the
current issue of People magazine, super
models Kim Alexis, Carol Alt and Bever
ly Johnson disagree.
Johnson says,"I think the image of
models is very destructive to
women. . . .It does a lot of damage to
women's self-esteem because it makes
them try to reach a goal that they will
never reach."
What does it take to look "so good?"
Alexis says, "starving myself for four
days in a row." She also says, on another
occasion she "was eating only a head of
lettuce for dinner. [Someonel walked in
and said, 'You're eating a whole head of
lettuce? How could you?'"

Alt sympathized: "On my first model
ing job, I fainted right into Isomeone'sl
arms." Women who try to emulate these
successful models suffer both physically
and mentally.
Society does not value women for
their athleticism. Even at progressive
Stanford, we have Stanford basketball
and Stanford women's basketball, in
spite of the fact that the men are losing
to Division II teams while the women
are vying for another national champi
onship.
Nor does society value its women for
their intelligence. Hillary Clinton was
attacked savagely by politicians and the
media for choosing a highly successful
law career over housework.
I myself confess to attractions similar
to those described by Rogers. We must
ask the deeper question of why many
men feel such attractions. The answer is
not, as Rogers implies, chance or genet
ics, but chiefly culture.

When food was scarce in Europe,
obese women were considered beautiful.
When working in the field was a sign of
one's lower class status, "fair skinned"
women were the ideal because they
alone could remain indoors. Today, tan
is "in" because being tan indicates that
one has the time to relax or visit Club
Med.
Rogers assumes that feelings are
exogenous uncontrollables and, thus,
neither good nor bad. Feelings just are.
Certainly feelings are not entirely
uncontrollable, because many people
instilled from youth with prejudiced
feelings toward others succeed in over
coming these feelings.
And just as a bigot's belief that mem
bers of some race or religion are inferior
does not justify that belief, so too the
American male's desire for ultra-thin
women does not legitimize that desire.
