# Daily's environmental editorial way off base
## 
### 
We are grateful that The Daily cares
so much for our Earth that it is willing
to put its journalistic foot in its mouth
for it. Its criticism of Bay Area Earth
Day is totally unfounded.
Earth Day's audience is not just the all
knowing staffers of The Stanford Daily.
The goal is to attract people from through
out the Bay Area, from all walks of life. Big
name speakers and entertainers are a way
of bringing people to an event.
We can't expect people to recharge
their batteries if they don't know that a
battery is harmful to the environment.
Bay Area Earth Day is the only Earth
Day event we've heard of that integrates
education and action. At the fair itself, every
booth in every theme area will emphasize
what an individual can do right now to
share in slowing the destruction of the

earth. One area will even target high school
and college students, describing educational
paths they can follow to a career in environ
mental action.
Doctors will come together to discuss
what they can do within their profession
to help the environment. Workshops will
provide individuals with the skills they
need to make their lifestyles more envi
ronmentally sound.
We have learned from experience that
in order to bring about long-term commit
ment to environmental action, individuals
should be exposed to positive action.
Finally, every organization at the
Earth Day Fair, from the Sierra Club to
the civil engineering graduate students
group, is being urged to put together a
Post Earth Day Action Project rather
than distribute flyers or pamphlets.

We can't guarantee a doubling of
Greenpeace's membership, but we can
anticipate new members joining the
groups that participate in the fair.
While Daily staffers spend their days
talking, writing and paying lip service to
everything from multiculturalism to
environmentalism, members of Students
for Environmental Action at Stanford
have been working on these very issues.
If only the Daily editorialists would
leave their offices to see SEAS members
working with the administration on energy
conservation and sound building practices,
working with Tresidder to use recycled dis
posable goods, and stabilizing our very own
Foothills ecosystem through tree-planting
Ultimately, it seems that the Daily
stafTs main objection to Earth Day is its
tone. They ask, "Party on, dude?" To

this we can say two things. First, Daily
editors themselves created this tone in
the Jan. 6 article, "Attention tree-hug
gers: Stanford to host Earth Day 1993."
The only thing they know about Bay
Area Earth Day is their own article in The
Daily. Do Daily editors footnote themselves
when they write history research papers?
Second, if the Daily staffers expect
the tone of Earth Day to be somber, if
they expect us to make people feel
guilty, then they are totally out of touch
with human nature. The Earth Day Fair
will be fun, no doubt about that, but it
will also be serious.
