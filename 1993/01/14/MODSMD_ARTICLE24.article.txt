## N'Gai Croal Straight White Male seeks same: Christmas at the movies 
### 
TODAY'S STRAIGHT White Male
(SWM) is mad as hell, and he's not
gonna take it any more.
Women, gays and lesbians, and ethnic
minorities are making steady gains, he
believes, at his expense. Blamed for all of
the world's ills, he can't defend himself
without charges of sexism, racism and
homophobia being hurled at him.
So where can the besieged SWM turn
for empowerment? Where can he find
himself represented unapologetically for
who he is, rather than through eyes of the
hyper-sensitive, whining, PC-liberals that
dominate mass media?
The answer: at the movies. Four fall
and winter releases, "A Few Good Men,"
"Glengarry Glen Ross," "Hoffa" and
"Reservoir Dogs," explode the myth of
liberal guilt and tolerance with a
vengeance. On the surface, these films
might seem to have little in common,
but they share predominantly SWM
casts, an emphasis on language (much of
it crude), and a heartfelt yearning for
the days when white men were men.
These films are gangsta rap for the
SWM. Women, gays and lesbians, and
people of color are virtually nowhere to
be found, but the SWM characters' para
noid fear of these "others" explodes in
hateful diatribes.
Quentin Tarantino's "Reservoir
Dogs" is in some ways the worst offend
er. The words nigger, faggot, bitch and
spic are uttered with clockwork regulari
ty, often with a string of profanity
attached to them.
And the characters' fear of women
(e.g. the threat of castration) and jail-

house rape (e.g. black semen being
pumped up white asses) demonstrate a
paranoidal undercurrent of misogyny
and homophobia.

Tellingly, 'Dogs' has two
women listed in its cred
its: Shocked Woman and
Shot Woman.

At least Tarantino's characters are
equal opportunity bigots. Writer David
Mamet ("Hoffa" and "Glengarry Glen
Ross"), who is Jewish, uses Tarantino's
entire panoply of racial and homophobic
slurs while adding "wops" and "cheap
East Indians" to the list, but he notice
ably omits "kike" from his vocabulary.
In "Glengarry," we watch aging
SWMs blame their inability to sell real
estate on bitchy, domineering wives,
cheap East Indians who'll talk for hours
and not buy a thing, and faggot bosses
who won't give them good leads.
At least "Glengarry," has a point to
make: That is, how the dog-eat-dog
world of Reaganomic capitalism corrupts
and destroys working people. "Hoffa,"
on the other hand, is an incoherent mess
that has only one thing to say: The
union was Jimmy Hoffa's life.
Publicity photographs of the some
what nebbishy Mamet and the diminu
tive Danny DeVito provide some insight
as to why these men were attracted to
this two-hour ode to testosterone.

Women, when present in these films,
don't fare much better. Tellingly,
"Dogs" has two women listed in its cred
its: Shocked Woman and Shot Woman.
But fear not; the male characters loving
ly mention a "real fine Oriental bitch,"
and sing the praises of big-breasted
black women — presumably so that the
female audience doesn't feel entirely left
out.
Even more offensive towards women
is "A Few Good Men." The only film of
the bunch to include a significant female
character, it blithely portrays Demi
Moore's Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway as an
incompetent fool. She clumsily botches
her bid to defend two marines accused of
murder, and, in a truly awful scene,
repeatedly "strenuously objects" to the
judge's overrule long after her point has
been made.
So why is she in the film? To cheerlead
the callow Lt. J.G. Daniel Kaffee (Tom
Cruise) into becoming a man, of course.
And though the customary love scene is
absent here, the overt sexual attraction
between Kaffee and Galloway allays any
fears that Kaffee may be as "faggoty" as
his uniform — so described by Col.
Nathan R. Jessup (Jack Nicholson).
These films seem to be competing
with rap culture, where non-blacks,
women and gays are the excluded oth
ers. Both genres struggle to preserve
violence as solely their privilege. Vio
lence, whether physical or verbal,
allows the perpetrators to believe that
they are the oppressors and not the
oppressed — not female, not black (or
white) and not gay.
Further, these films echo the nihlistic

self-destructiveness often found in
gangsta rap. The "other" can't destroy
white males; only the white male can
destroy himself.
The rendezvous in "Dogs" is as
strewn with corpses as the halls of Elsi
nore. In "Glengarry," Shelly Levene is
apprehended for theft because he
couldn't keep his mouth shut. Hoffa is
killed because he didn't know how far
was too far with the mob. And Col. Jes
sup's arrogance causes him to self
destruct on the witness stand, broken
down by a fellow SWM.

If we excuse Ice Cube's
lyrics as an expression of
black rage, then how can
we condemn Tarantino's
expression of white
anger without revealing
hypocrisy?

These films generally received excel
lent reviews, and with the exception of
"Hoffa," are turning up regularly on
critics' top 10 lists. I myself gave "Reser
voir Dogs" an exceptional review. Along
with "Glengarry Glen Ross," these were
two of the best films I saw in 1992.
So what's the problem? I think that
reviewers, myself included, are too
quick to excuse, racist, sexist and homo

phobic slurs in "serious" or arthouse
films. We simply say, "That's how those
people talk — it's just realism." and
leave it at that.
But we're talking about professional
writers — both Mamet and Aaron Sorkin
("A Few Good Men") are acclaimed play
wrights, and words are their weapons of
choice. A skilled writer chooses every
word carefully. So if their screenplays are
filled with invective against the "other,"
there must be a reason.
These films express the fear, anger
and paranoia of the SWM. They're part
of a backlash against the real or imag
ined threat of affirmative action, quo
tas, reverse discrimination, political
correctness — you name it, they're
pissed off.
And the rush to empower the voices
that have traditionally been excluded
has created a world where it is impossi
ble to hold these writers accountable for
their words. If we excuse Ice Cube's
lyrics as an expression of black rage,
then how can we condemn Tarantino's
expression of white anger without
revealing our hypocrisy?
We can't. So as critics, we simply
praise or decry these films on aesthetic
grounds. We start with a pithy lead, we
discuss the performances, the direction,
the cinematography, the score, and then
we wrap things up with a punchy kick
er. Then we kick back, relax and wait to
see what our fellow reviewers have to
say.
There's got to be a better way.
