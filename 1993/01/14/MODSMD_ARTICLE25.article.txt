## Cardinal hoops hopes to beat the heat in Cal's kitchen 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Two months ago, a higher-ranked Stanford team
strode into enemy territory to defeat California in
Berkeley. This time, the task will not be so easy.
For, while Memorial Stadium is a home field, it is
hardly intimidating to the Stanford band, let alone
the Stanford football team.
Harmon Gym is different. It is one of the tough
est places for an opposing team to play in college bas
ketball.
Built in the 1930'5, the arena seats a cozy 6,578.
But unlike Maples Pavilion, which also has a small
capacity, there is no dividing space between the play
ing floor and the fans. Where Newell Court ends, Cal
rooters begin.
"It's kind of crazy there," senior guard Marcus
Lollie said. "The fans are yelling and screaming on
the court, but I like it."
For the mtyority of the Cardinal roster, this will
be their first away game against Cal that is actually
played at Cal. Last year, the two teams faced off in
the Oakland Coliseum. Cal likes to schedule games
against attractive opponents there — such as Stan
ford, Arizona and UCLA — because the school can
take in greater revenue from ticket sales.
The same situation was supposed to occur this
year, but the financial power of cable network ESPN
caused the game to be moved to Thursday. The Col
iseum was subsequently unavailable for use because
its primary tenant, the NBA's Golden State War
riors, had a home game scheduled against the Miami
Heat.
"We were going to play in the Coliseum on Satur
day, which would have been much preferable to play
ing in Harmon on a Thursday night, so we're a bit
disappointed," coach Mike Montgomery said.
If they had their choice, the Stanford team would
rather play at the Coliseum, because it is a more
neutral arena. Instead, the Cardinal is literally
thrown to the Bears — and their supporters.
"If they make a couple of good plays— especially
a dunk, which will eventually happen — the crowd

goes wild and they (Cal) get jacked up," Montgomery
said. "[The crowd noisel sustains their good plays
and prolongs our lapses."
"It's going to be a lot more difficult," added senior
guard Peter Dukes. "It's a small gym so the crowd is

ritfht on you. It tends to magnify your mistakes, so
you must play your best."
The Harmon crowd's intensity can make concen
tration for opponents difficult, even in warmups.
About six years ago, center Eric Reveno so feared the

heckling of the Cal fans that he traded sweatsuits
before the pregame warmups with teammate Der
rick Bruton. The switch paid off at least initially, as
blue-and-gold clad students berated Bruton, while
Reveno warmed up at ease. Stanford, however, still
lost the game. The last time Stanford won at Har
mon was in the 1989-90 season.
Given the preseason hype the Golden Bears have
received, coupled with the usual tension of the Stan
ford-Cal rivalry and a national cable television audi
ence, the excitement in Berkeley tonight for this
Pacific 10 Conference matchup will be at a fever
pitch. Stanford's job will be to stop the noise by play
ing better basketball.
"I like playing there, it's always packed," forward
Brent Williams said. "They're on you before you step
on the court — they're waiting outside at the bus. I use
that to fuel my fire, so I'm going to be pumped up."
Cardinal Notes:
Forward Jason Weaver underwent arthroscopic surgery yes
terday to relieve the roughening of the patella in his left. knee.
The patella was shaved and smoothed. As reported earlier,
Weaver will be out for the season.
