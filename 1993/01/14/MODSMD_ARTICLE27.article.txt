# Stanford takes on Moscow

In their first home appear
ance of the-season, the Stanford
men's gymnastics team will per
form in an exhibition competi
tion against Moscow State Uni
versity tonight.
'This meet will be relaxed and
friendly," said Cardinal head
coach Sadao Hamada. "It's a
good chance to have the guys do
their new skills and routines in a
meet which does not count as an
NCAA qualifying meet."
While the University of
Moscow team could be called the
best collegiate team in Russia,
these gymnasts are not the ones
seen in the Olympics or other
international events. In compari
son, the competitors are students
or former students of the universi
ty who have pursued academic
training, rather than solely con
centrate on gymnastics.
"The American and Russian
systems are very different,"
explained coach Vjacheslov
Vorobjev. "Our high-level sports
men, including gymnasts on the
national team, do not go to Uni
versities, but instead attend insti
tutes of physical education."
The gymnasts competing
tonight are not such profession
als, but students who consider
gymnastics a hobby.

"We got this opportunity to
visit the U.S. because we contin
ued our gymnastics training
after our second year in the uni
versity. It's like a dream that's
turned into reality," said team
member Andre Asainov.
Asainov and his teammates
are not only gymnasts, but also
students, husbands, fathers and
even small business owners.
Many have gone on from the
university and are busy with
careers and families— practicing
gymnastics purely for fun.
Oleg Nosov, who, at 27, is the
oldest on the team, is a lawyer
with two children. The youngest
team member is 19-year-old
Denis Saenko, a second-year
physics student. Most of the

gymnasts have chosen to major
in areas such as journalism, bio
physics and law.
"There has been a decline in
physical education since the
break up of the Soviet Union,"
said Asainov. "There is not as
much money in it — it's unprof
itable now." He added that inter
est has lessened because people
must spend more time concen
trating on their economic well
being and, therefore, they can
not spend much time on hobbies
such as gymnastics.
Asainov and his teammates
stressed that this team is com
posed primarily of scholars who
"might not be on the level that
Americans expect, but this is the
team we have."

For tonight's meet, the Stan
ford gymnasts are trying new
skills and routines and readjust
ing to a competitive atmosphere.
"This meet will be a testing
ground for new tricks," said senior
Jair Lynch. "It's a chance for us to
get back into routine shape — the
uniform, judges, audience — all of
those antsy things that come with
competition."
Those watching tonight's meet
should not expect to see an
Olympic-caliber Russian team.
Rather, the competition will give
spectators an opportunity to com
pare the collegiate gymnastics
styles of two different countries
and also watch the defending-
NCAA champions in what should
be an exciting home opener.
