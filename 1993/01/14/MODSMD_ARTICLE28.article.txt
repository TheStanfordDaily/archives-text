# Cardinal swimmers look to dominate Michigan

One of Skip Kenney's most vivid memories
as the Cardinal men's swim coach came during
the 1988 Michigan dual meet. "That meet was
one of the top two or three dual meets I've ever
been a part of," Kenney said. "Michigan packed
the place — there was standing room only. ..
and then they whipped on us real good."
Now the Cardinal squad has an opportuni
ty to avenge that loss and the string of others
that followed, as they host Michigan at
deGuerre pool, this Friday at 1 p.m. Stan
ford's only recent victory over Michigan
occurred last year, as the Cardinal handed the
Wolverines its first home loss ever under cur
rent head coach John Urbanchek.
Apparently, Michigan has regrouped and
returns this year with its guns reloaded— and
aimed at the Cardinal squad.
"It's a big deal to beat us this year because
we're the defending NCAA champions," Ken
ney said. "Also, Michigan had a couple guys
redshirt last year to train for the Olympics,
and this year they're back." In fact, Michi
gan's roster boasts four Olympians.
"Over the past several years, Michigan has
been the best dual meet team in the country,"
Kenney said. "This year they've put together
another outstanding dual meet team."
In recent memory, however, Michigan has
not beaten the Cardinal at the NCAA champi

onships. According to sophomore freestyle
specialist Dan Kanner, the Cardinal's success
at NCAA's has much to do with their training
philosophy.
"We've changed our workouts a little to incor
porate some speed and competition instead of
just pounding away in the pool like we do in the
fall," said Kanner. "The change of pace has been
nice, but we're still keeping our yardage up."
"You don't need to win dual meets to go to
NCAA's," Kenney said. "Since we do most of
our qualifying at the Pac-10 championships,
we train through the dual meets."
Kenney feels that the key to a Cardinal victo
ry rests in the two relays. "If we win both relays,
it may offset the diving," Kenney said. "Their
divers are among the best in the country.
"Most teams have both strengths and
weaknesses, but Michigan's only weak event
may be the freestyle relay. They're going to
have to win the meet before that last relay in
order to pull off a victory — they won't be sav
ing anyone for that event."
In terms of his own team, Kenney is reluc
tant to burden any single swimmer with the
task of carrying the team to victory. "Erik
Maurer is the defending NCAA champion in
the 50 free and will need to swim big in the 50
and the 100 freestyle and the relay, but this
meet will need to be a total team effort," said
Kenney. "Michigan has someone good in every
single event."
Interestingly enough, the inclement weath

er may prove to be the Cardinal's biggest
advantage, as Michigan's squad trains indoors
year-round.
"The weather is going to be a help to us,"
said Kanner. "We've been training outside and
can handle the rain, but it'll be a real shock to
them."
"We hate the rain too, but we sure hope it's
here on Friday," Kenney agreed.
However, sprint specialist Erik Maurer
feels that the meet rests less on the great out
doors and more on the team's innards.
"Everyone needs to step up their level as we
go on in the dual meet season," said Maurer.
"People are going to be tired from all the train
ing that we've been doing. If we want to win
the meet, we'll need to swim from our hearts
and our guts."
Maurer cited the breaststroke events and
the 200-yard free as events to watch. The Car
dinal lists three top-notch breaststrokers in
Tyler Mayfield, Kurt Grote and J.J. Freitag,
while the 200 freestyle event will pit two
Olympians, Stanford's Joe Hudepohl and
Michigan's Gustavo Borges, against each
other. Borges was a silver medalist in the event
at Barcelona and Hudepohl finished sixth.
"There'll be a lot of great matchups with
top swimmers," said Kanner. "The meet could
come down to hundredths of seconds and
everyone has to take it upon themselves to win
the meet. Who comes out on top could very
well depend on who's having a good day."
