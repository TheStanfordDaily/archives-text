# Mean nasty hecklers hurt players' feelings

NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY,
very naughty. Stanford
fans, you have been very
bad boys and girls. I'm going to
have to spank each and every one
of you if this intolerable behavior
continues.
Last Saturday I managed to
drag myself to the men's basket
ball game versus the mighty
Ducks of Oregon. I figured that
some of those virile elementary
school boys who duke it out dur
ing the Time Out for Tuition
might have reached the interest
ed-in-girls phase.
But as I spanned the crowd for
attractive men, what was I to
hear from your sour little
mouths but mean, spiteful com
ments directed toward the mem
bers of the other team. I do not
quite understand this "be offen
sive" concept, but I know that I
do not like one bit of it. Horrific,
it was.
I was shocked, nay, aghast, as
the nice young man sitting in
front of me shouted out descrip
tions of the pitiful anatomical fee
bleness of one of our pre
pubescent young guests, fluster
ing the player and causing him to
botch an easy pass.
Now can he help it if the time
for pubic hair hasn't come his
way yet? Mother Nature works at
her own pace.
Is this the sort of hospitable
behavior one should expect from a
nationally venerated institution
such as ours? I mean really, you
hoodlums. I think we should wel
come our hosts. Give them a yell
leader to date for the night, per
haps.
It is not necessary to outline
the sexual deviance of the poor
center's grandmother in front of
God and everybody. If you happen
to know his personal history, you
should keep that information to
yourself. He can't help his rural
upbringing or any apparent furry
mammal fetishes that may very
well run in his family. He might
have to go into therapy just
because you wanted your team to
win.
Cruel, wicked comments, you
nasty children.
And that poor boy who finally
made it ofT the bench with five
minutes to go— even though the
Oregon coach was subbing four
players as often as the cheerleaders
yelled that one cheer they memo
rized after extensive practice
("Defense"-clap-clap-"Defense") —
didn't need any more negative
feedback.
He's probably suffering from
self-esteem problems, only to be
compounded by your taunts refer
ring to hemorrhoids and his
sparse goatee. Why not encourage
him? Laud the size of his biceps
compared to the rest of his ane
mic squad, but telling him he has
chocolate smeared on his chin,
and dwelling on the negative is
not very congenial.
Also, if you are going to harass

other players, at least try to pro
nounce their names right. Take
that poor young Duck named Fife
. . . his last name rhymes with
strife, and is not "Fee-Fee". You
unfriendly brutes made him
sound like a French poodle in
heat with your incorrect reading.
Terrible, just terrible.
And then as he looked at you
with his confused little gaze, you
taunted him again. Just because
he's academically challenged —
and only after 20 minutes of Fee-
Fee chants and comments about
getting a perm could he under
stand the nature of your cruel joke
— there is no reason to downplay
his intellectual capacity.
Oregon is a fine academic insti-

tution. There's a very good
chance that he can read, and even
has a favorite author like Dr.
Seuss, Judy Blume or the guy
who wrote those pseudo-Chris
tian, Lion, Witch and Wardrobe
books. No need to underestimate
his intelligence. Actually, I'm
sure that if he had ever learned to
write, he would've gotten into
Stanford, so don't you get all high
and mighty, you ruffians.
Although I'm sure you were
trying to be helpful, I don't think
they need the direction of the
crowd to relate the events of the
game in a sort of mix between
KZSU's screechy color-commen
tary and closed captioning for the
hearing impaired, either. As you
yelled "Bounce, bounce, pass,
bounce, pass", etc., you were
probably doing more harm than
good.
The poor dears had to digest
the sound information, a process
that probably took them consider
ably longer than it would take
most reasonably-functional hum
ans. This most likely hindered
their performance, although they
might have appreciated the
vocabulary lessons, which didn't
have to include brick, airball or
sphincter.
If I hear the same sorts of com
ments at further games, I will be
truly peeved at the whole group of
you. Sportsmanship is a great
quality, and you are likely to give
the Stanford crowd a bad reputa
tion, and other teams won't want
to come to our majestic universi
ty
Despicable. You'll all be sent to
bed without supper.
