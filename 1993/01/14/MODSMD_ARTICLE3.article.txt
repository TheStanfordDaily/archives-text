# Study looks at ovarian cancer

Women who have given birth or used oral contra
ception are less likely to contract ovarian cancer than
women who have not, according to a study coordinat
ed by a Stanford doctor that appeared yesterday in
the American Journal of Epidemiology.
A study of thousands of women showed that those
who have had children are at a lower risk for ovarian
cancer than childless women, said Health Research and
Policy Prof. Alice Whittemore. Furthermore, she said,
as women have more children, their cancer risk drops.
"A woman with four children is protected more
than a woman with three children, and so on," Whit
temore said. "It's really suggesting that there's some
thing actively beneficial about pregnancy."
In addition, she said, the study showed that women
who use birth control pills are at a lower risk for can
cer than childless women who haven't used the pill.
Also, women who breast feed their babies were
found to have a lower rate of cancer than women with
an identical number of children who do not breast
feed, Whittemore said.
Ovarian cancer is a relatively rare form of cancer,
she said. An infant girl born today, who lived to be 85,
would only have a 1.5 percent chance of getting ovar
ian cancer, compared to a 10 percent chance of getting
breast cancer, she added.
Whittemore said there are two
possible explanations for the find
ings. One possibility is that ovula
tion itself contributes to ovarian
cancer. Thus cancer risk would be
lowered during pregnancy or
while a woman uses the pill, both
of which stop ovulation.
Ovulation also does not occur
during the first year a woman
breast feeds, she said.
A second possible explanation
of the lowered cancer risk is that
certain hormones produced in the
pituitary gland that promote ovu
lation might contribute to ovarian
cancer, Whittemore said. Levels
of these hormones drop during
pregnancy and use of the pill.
Whittemore said the study
may lead to the use of oral contra
ception to help prevent ovarian
cancer in high-risk patients.
"If a woman had a mother or a
sister with ovarian cancer, she
may want to consider taking the
pill," she said.
In addition to finding lowered
cancer risks in some women,
Whittemore said the study found
evidence indicating that women

who use fertility drugs have a
higher risk for ovarian cancer.
"It's a worry. It's a worry to
everyone," she said of the finding
on fertility drugs.
Whittemore stressed, however,
that the evidence on fertility drugs
was "very inconclusive," involving
only a small number of the total
women in the sample, and more
research would be needed to dis
cover the exact link between fertil
ity drugs and ovarian cancer.
The study also found that
"estrogen replacement therapy
does not seem to increase risk"
for ovarian cancer, Whittemore
said. Estrogen is often taken by
menopausal women.
Whittemore led a team that
analyzed the raw data of 12 stud
ies involving thousands of
women. The study published yes
terday examined 6,341 white
women. The study's data on black
women will be published in the
Jan. 20 Journal of the National
Cancer Institute.
The data on black women is
being published separately because
blacks have lower ovarian cancer
rates than whites, Whittemore
said. The study showed that black
women receive the same beneficial
effects of pregnancy and oral con
traceptive use as white women.
