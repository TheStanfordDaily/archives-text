Women who have given birth or used oral contra
ception are less likely to contract ovarian cancer than
women who have not, according to a study coordinat
ed by a Stanford doctor that appeared yesterday in
the American Journal of Epidemiology.
A study of thousands of women showed that those
who have had children are at a lower risk for ovarian
cancer than childless women, said Health Research and
Policy Prof. Alice Whittemore. Furthermore, she said,
as women have more children, their cancer risk drops.
"A woman with four children is protected more
than a woman with three children, and so on," Whit
temore said. "It's really suggesting that there's some
thing actively beneficial about pregnancy."
In addition, she said, the study showed that women
who use birth control pills are at a lower risk for can
cer than childless women who haven't used the pill.
Also, women who breast feed their babies were
found to have a lower rate of cancer than women with
an identical number of children who do not breast
feed, Whittemore said.
Ovarian cancer is a relatively rare form of cancer,
she said. An infant girl born today, who lived to be 85,
would only have a 1.5 percent chance of getting ovar
ian cancer, compared to a 10 percent chance of getting
breast cancer, she added.
