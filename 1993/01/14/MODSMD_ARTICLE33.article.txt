# Profs say Stalin backed N. Korea attack
## Political Science Prof. Holloway finds evidence in declassified documents 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) â€” Political Science Prof.
David Holloway and a colleague from Florida
State University announced yesterday that
they have found proof in newly opened Soviet
archives that Josef Stalin approved the North
Korean attack that began the Korean War in
1950.
Western historians have long suspected
that the Soviet dictator authorized the inva
sion.
Holloway, who is co-director of the Center
for International Security and Arms Control
at Stanford, and Kathryn Weathersby of Flori
da State University said the evidence came in
a newly declassified report that was prepared
by the Soviet foreign ministry for Soviet lead
er Leonid Brezhnev in 1966.
According to the report, Stalin gave North
Korean leader Kim II Sung permission for the
invasion during meetings in Moscow in March
and April 1950.
Soviet military advisers then helped to
draft the battle plans, and Stalin "gave orders
that all of Kim's desires for weapons and
equipment should be met quickly," Holloway
said.
After visiting Moscow, Kim went to China,
where he also obtained advance approval for
the attack from leader Mao Tse-Tung, accord
ing to the Brezhnev's report. The report cites
telegrams between Stalin and Kim that are

still classified.
More than 60,000 North Korean troops
streamed across the 38th parallel into South
Korea on June 25, 1950, in an attempt to
bring the entire country under Communist
rule. Korea had been divided into Soviet and
American occupation zones since the end of
World War 11.
United Nations troops led by the United
States drove back the North Koreans in fight
ing that ended with an armistice in July 1953.
More than 33,000 Americans and an estimat
ed 2 million Chinese and Koreans died in bat
tle.
Holloway and Weathersby said the docu
ments show that Kim repeatedly pressed Stal
in for permission to start the war, as former
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev claimed in
his memoirs. Until now, Khrushchev's mem
oirs were the best evidence that Stalin
approved the invasion.
The American researchers announced their
findings at a conference sponsored by the Cold
War International History Project, based at
the Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars in Washington, D.C.
Dozens of Russian and American historians
are presenting papers at the four-day confer
ence, which began Tuesday at the Russian
Academy of Sciences.
Almost all of the research is based on Com

munist Party Central Committee archives
that have been declassified since the Soviet
Union collapsed in December 1991.
The conference has accelerated the release
of once-secret documents, but many crucial
archives remain closed, organizer James G.
Hershberg said.
"This is only a start, although it is a good
start," he said.
On Tuesday, two Russian scholars revealed
that the Soviet Union pushed North Vietnam
to make peace with the United States in 1968.
Ilya Gaiduk and Oganez Marinin said Sovi
et leaders feared that the Vietnam War could
escalate into a global conflict and arranged
secret meetings between U.S. and North Viet
namese officials in Moscow before formal
peace talks were held in Paris in 1968-69.
Other papers presented yesterday con
tained new evidence about the split between
the Soviet Union and China in 1958-61. Kon
stantin Pleshakov of Moscow's Institute of the
USA and Canada disclosed that China did not
notify the Soviets before it shelled the nation
alist Chinese islands of Quemoy and Matsu in
August 1958, causing a major East-West cri
sis.
Pleshakov suggested that the Chinese
deliberately incited the crisis because they
feared Khrushchev was moving toward better
relations with the capitalist world.
