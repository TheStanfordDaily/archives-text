Union film rich in
testosterone, an
ode to the thugs

Hoffa

"Hoffa" could have been an incisive look
at the American labor movement. Or a
"JFK"-like investigation into Jimmy Hoffa's
disappearance. It could even have been a
thorough exploration of what made this
enigmatic and popular labor leader tick.
In the hands of screenwriter David
Mamet and director Danny DeVito, we get
an incoherent, sprawling bio-pic that covers
four decades: from Hoffa's early efforts to or
ganize the Teamsters, to his ascension to
presidency of the union, and finally his in
evitable downfall. Yet more than two hours
later, all we've learned is one thing: Jimmy
Hoffa lived for the Teamsters.
That's because Mamet and DeVito aren't
interested in what made Hoffa tick. Nor are

they interested in the complexities of the re
lationships between the union, the Mafia
and the government.
They're only interested in creating an ode
to the days when men were men and testos
terone ruled the world. We are treated to
scenes of Hoffa fearlessly leading his fellow
strikers to do battle with thuggish strike
breakers, directed with a Potemkin-like
power. Only Sergei Eisenstein directed "Bat
tleship Potemkin" in 1925; this is 1993.
Jack Nicholson's performance is highly
entertaining. He nails Hoffa's midwestern
drawl, huffing and puffing his way through
the picture. He nearly tricks us into praising
his work. But the only reason we like it is that
it's his first performance this year that isn't a
variation on the Joker, which was itself a spin
on his role in"The Shining."
DeVito, who also directed "War Of The
Roses" — a terrific exercise in black comedy
— missteps badly here. He shamelessly
plunders "Citizen Kane," "Lawrence of Ara
bia" and any other classic he can get his
hands on.
Worse than DeVito's direction is his per
formance as Hoffa's fictional sidekick,
Bobby Ciaro. Even Spike Lee had the good
sense to minimize his own screen time. De-
Vito's not that smart, so we're forced to
watch him gaze reverently at Hoffa for two
hours.
Hoffa's private life gets the shaft. His wife
is casually introduced halfway through the
film to look sad at a union funeral while
Hoffa keeps a stiff upper lip. Hoffa spends
more time hanging out with Ciaro than
with his own family. But for those who mis
takenly perceive a homoerotic undercur
rent, the film does include two pointless
scenes of Ciaro with naked women. What a
relief.
At a time when the Federal government
has long been trying to blunt the power of
the unions, an honest look at both Hoffa and
the Teamsters could have been invaluable.
Instead, we get a film that says that Hoffa was
a violent thug, but that it was okay, because
he did what he had to do for the union. If you
believe that, I've got a body under Giant's
stadium to sell you.

Leap of Faith

If I had an old, feeble grandmother, there's
no person I'd rather see rip her off than Steve

Martin. And re
gardless of his
trendy yet lousy
hair dye job, there's
no person I'd rather
cast as a slimeball
con man evangelist.
As Rev. Jonas
Nightengale in
"Leap of Faith,"
Martin is perhaps at
his best.
"Leap of Faith" is a
comedy-drama
about Nightengale
and his traveling
evangelical min
istry which special
izes in good ol' fash
ioned bible
thump in *. Com
plete with his gospel
choir, the Angels of
Mercy, Nightengale
and his entourage
rake in an abun
dance of tithes with
phony acts of heal
ing, fancy foot-

stepping and a constructive use of modern
technology.
The result: the biggest scam ever to hit the
drought-stricken residents of Rustwater, Kan.
After breaking down in the corn relish cap
ital of America, Nightengale, cohorts and his
business manager Jane (Debra Winger), begin
making connections, gathering the proper
permits and raising the ministry's huge circus
like tent.
Despite the sheriff's (Liam Neeson's) bold
attempts to thwart the scam revival and save
his naive town from a self-inflicted apoca
lypse, Nightengale's performance — full of
sparkling glitz and some really astounding
gospel singing — still sparks the locals with
hope in their hard times, enough to lighten
the load in their wallets.
Blending his comic roles of the past and h is
uncharacteristic, depressingly cynical role in
"Grand Canyon," Martin achieves a middle
ground of sorts in "Leap of Faith." On stage,
his great command of physical humor gives
Nightengale his show-stopping charisma.
Martin also displays his growing range of act
ing abilities as he plays the bad guy who hand
ily manipulates the community residents.
"lx;ap of Faith" docs face a certain prob
lematic ambiguity in being a "comedy
drama." The distinction between the two is
never completely made, as director Richard
Fearce warily tiptoes the fine line between
cliche and honest sentimcntalism.
But with Steve Martin backed up by a pow
erful gospel choir, how can anyone go wrong?
While of Faith" could have become
an average cheeseball film, it narrowly avoids
that tragic fate. The climax of the film is
reached in a relatively convincing manner,
and the film ultimately avoids the "Zuzu's
petals" approach to spiritual optimism.

entertaining. He nails Hoffa's midwestern
drawl, huffing and puffing his way through
the picture. He nearly tricks us into praising
his work. But the only reason we like it is that
it's his first performance this year that isn't a
variation on the Joker, which was itself a spin
on his role in"The Shining."
DeVito, who also directed "War Of The
Roses" — a terrific exercise in black comedy
— missteps badly here. He shamelessly
plunders "Citizen Kane," "Lawrence of Ara
bia" and any other classic he can get his
hands on.
Worse than DeVito's direction is his per
formance as Hoffa's fictional sidekick,
Bobby Ciaro. Even Spike Lee had the good
sense to minimize his own screen time. De-
Vito's not that smart, so we're forced to
watch him gaze reverently at Hoffa for two
hours.
Hoffa's private life gets the shaft. His wife
is casually introduced halfway through the
film to look sad at a union funeral while
Hoffa keeps a stiff upper lip. Hoffa spends
more time hanging out with Ciaro than
with his own family. But for those who mis
takenly perceive a homoerotic undercur
rent, the film does include two pointless
scenes of Ciaro with naked women. What a
relief.
At a time when the Federal government
has long been trying to blunt the power of
the unions, an honest look at both Hoffa and
the Teamsters could have been invaluable.
Instead, we get a film that says that Hoffa was
a violent thug, but that it was okay, because
he did what he had to do for the union. If you
believe that, I've got a body under Giant's
stadium to sell you.

Leap of Faith

If I had an old, feeble grandmother, there's
no person I'd rather see rip her off than Steve

Martin. And re
gardless of his
trendy yet lousy
hair dye job, there's
no person I'd rather
cast as a slimeball
con man evangelist.
As Rev. Jonas
Nightengale in
"Leap of Faith,"
Martin is perhaps at
his best.
"Leap of Faith" is a
comedy-drama
about Nightengale

evangelical min
istry which special

plete with his gospel
choir, the Angels of
Mercy, Nightengale
and his entourage
rake in an abun
dance of tithes with
phony acts of heal
ing, fancy foot-

stepping and a constructive use of modern
technology.
The result: the biggest scam ever to hit the
drought-stricken residents of Rustwater, Kan.
After breaking down in the corn relish cap
ital of America, Nightengale, cohorts and his
business manager Jane (Debra Winger), begin
making connections, gathering the proper
permits and raising the ministry's huge circus
like tent.
Despite the sheriff's (Liam Neeson's) bold
attempts to thwart the scam revival and save
his naive town from a self-inflicted apoca
lypse, Nightengale's performance — full of
sparkling glitz and some really astounding
gospel singing — still sparks the locals with
hope in their hard times, enough to lighten
the load in their wallets.
Blending his comic roles of the past and h is
uncharacteristic, depressingly cynical role in
"Grand Canyon," Martin achieves a middle
ground of sorts in "Leap of Faith." On stage,
his great command of physical humor gives
Nightengale his show-stopping charisma.
Martin also displays his growing range of act
ing abilities as he plays the bad guy who hand
ily manipulates the community residents.
"lx;ap of Faith" docs face a certain prob
lematic ambiguity in being a "comedy
drama." The distinction between the two is
never completely made, as director Richard
Fearce warily tiptoes the fine line between
cliche and honest sentimcntalism.
But with Steve Martin backed up by a pow
erful gospel choir, how can anyone go wrong?
While of Faith" could have become
an average cheeseball film, it narrowly avoids
that tragic fate. The climax of the film is
reached in a relatively convincing manner,
and the film ultimately avoids the "Zuzu's
petals" approach to spiritual optimism.

Union film rich in
testosterone, an
ode to the thugs

Hoffa

"Hoffa" could have been an incisive look
at the American labor movement. Or a
"JFK"-like investigation into Jimmy Hoffa's
disappearance. It could even have been a
thorough exploration of what made this
enigmatic and popular labor leader tick.
In the hands of screenwriter David
Mamet and director Danny DeVito, we get
an incoherent, sprawling bio-pic that covers
four decades: from Hoffa's early efforts to or
ganize the Teamsters, to his ascension to
presidency of the union, and finally his in
evitable downfall. Yet more than two hours
later, all we've learned is one thing: Jimmy
Hoffa lived for the Teamsters.
That's because Mamet and DeVito aren't
interested in what made Hoffa tick. Nor are

they interested in the complexities of the re
lationships between the union, the Mafia
and the government.
They're only interested in creating an ode
to the days when men were men and testos
terone ruled the world. We are treated to
scenes of Hoffa fearlessly leading his fellow
strikers to do battle with thuggish strike
breakers, directed with a Potemkin-like
power. Only Sergei Eisenstein directed "Bat
tleship Potemkin" in 1925; this is 1993.
Jack Nicholson's performance is highly
entertaining. He nails Hoffa's midwestern
drawl, huffing and puffing his way through
the picture. He nearly tricks us into praising
his work. But the only reason we like it is that
it's his first performance this year that isn't a
