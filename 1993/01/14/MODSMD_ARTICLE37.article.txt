# Make 'em laugh: Sad life story of a slapstick actor
## 
### 
Chaplin

In "Chaplin," director Richard Attcnbor
ough ambitiously seeks to capture the life of
the worlds most famous comedian.
In recounting the events of Charlie Chap
lin's personal life, the movie entertains with
out reaching any deep understanding of
Chaplin the entertainer.
The story begins as an elderly Chaplin
(Robert Downey, Jr.) discusses his autobiog
raphy with his editor, George Hayden (An
thony Hopkins). As Hayden urges Chaplin
to fill in the gaps in his book, the movie
flashes back to the events of his past.
The screenwriters, unable or unwilling to
focus on any one area of his life, include it all:
tragic childhood, disastrous affairs with
teenage girls, trouble with the FBI and his
career.
The movie jumps from one episode to the
next so quickly that it neglects coherence.
Attenborough shows us a man with power
ful political convictions but forgets to tell us
where these convictions came from. And in
portraying Chaplin's problematic relation
ships with his mother and his lovers, the di
rector fails to make a connection between
the two.
More significantly, "Chaplin" fails to ex
plain the actor-director's genius. How did a
man with such a troubled history become
the greatest comic of his time?
Near the end of the movie, Hayden asks
the aged Chaplin how his mother's and
grandmother's mental illnesses affected his
work. It's an important question, but one
that the film never answers.
Despite the flawed plot, Downey per
forms brilliantly in the title role, playing
the ambitious artist, social critic and ar
dent lover with charisma and intensity. As
a drunk, he elicits the same kind of laugh
ter that Chaplin probably did. However,
he just misses in reproducing Chaplin's
zaniness.
Attenborough does make the movie vi

sually interesting, occasionally making
scenes from Chaplin's real life look like
episodes of a '30s slapstick comedy. He en
livens the movie by inserting segments
from real Chaplin films at opportune mo
ments.
But even Downey and Attenborough can
not turn "Chaplin" into a great biographical
film. Although the movie is often amusing
and occasionally truly funny, it cannot cap
ture Charlie Chaplin in the way Chaplin's
movies do.

Blind, bitter man
meets blue-eyed
boy: A sweet tale

Scent of a Woman

"Scent of a Woman" affords a wonderful
chance to feel for two likeable characters,

while taking mental revenge on all the bas
tard administrators you hated from "Dead
Poets Society." It's a film that laughs its whole
way through, without being afraid to con
front the severity of its promised destination.
Charlie Simms (Chris O' Donne 11) is a
charming and promising blue-eyed prep
school teddy bear who, being on scholarship
and from a small town, isn't like his cascading
through-life-in-daddy's-pocket friends. Just
before Thanksgiving, Charlie finds himself
forced to choose between a promising future
and three friends he doesn't particularly care
for. Caught between a rock and a Harvard.
In order to make money during Thanks
giving break, after which he must make his
decision, he accepts a care-taking job. Taking
care, that is, of the blind Col. Frank Slade (Al
Pacino), who seems to neither require nor
desire any help — save someone to lead him
to the bar. Pacino comes off as sharp and in
triguingly bitter, leaving poor Charlie de
fenseless and wide-eyed.
Charlie finds himself an unwitting guide
dog absorbed in Slade's plans to re-emerge
from dark depression for a final fling with
life's sensory pleasures. As their excursion
progresses the colonel's colors shine
through. He turns from a bitter alcoholic
veteran who can't get close to anybody into a
bitter alcoholic veteran whose sociability, in
sight and chutzpah exceed those of any
sighted person.
Director Martin Brest fills "Scent of a
Woman" with tension, setting the stage for the
two men to teach and, eventually, save each
other.
Though Pacino's comedic torrents (and
even O' Donnell's sporadic zingers) make
the two and a half hours fly by, the interplay
and sharp dialogue between the two charac
ters is where the movie excels.
O'Donnell, playing the prep student role
once again, delivers far more than a victim
ized baby face performance. He lays low at
first, playing the straight man against Paci
no's torrential 'Hoo-wah' cynicism — then
suddenly rises from passivity when the
drama peaks, without losing the character
already established.
True, it's long, but good writing and Paci
no's mastery make "Scent of a Woman" cer
tainly worth your while. It is a film unafraid
to face disconcerting conflicts up close, and
it comes full circle just when you want it to.

Blind, bitter man
meets blue-eyed
boy: A sweet tale

Scent of a Woman

"Scent of a Woman" affords a wonderful
chance to feel for two likeable characters,

while taking mental revenge on all the bas
tard administrators you hated from "Dead
Poets Society." It's a film that laughs its whole
way through, without being afraid to con
front the severity of its promised destination.
Charlie Simms (Chris O' Donne 11) is a
charming and promising blue-eyed prep
school teddy bear who, being on scholarship
and from a small town, isn't like his cascading
through-life-in-daddy's-pocket friends. Just
before Thanksgiving, Charlie finds himself
forced to choose between a promising future
and three friends he doesn't particularly care
for. Caught between a rock and a Harvard.
In order to make money during Thanks
giving break, after which he must make his
decision, he accepts a care-taking job. Taking
care, that is, of the blind Col. Frank Slade (Al
Pacino), who seems to neither require nor
desire any help — save someone to lead him
to the bar. Pacino comes off as sharp and in
triguingly bitter, leaving poor Charlie de
fenseless and wide-eyed.
Charlie finds himself an unwitting guide
dog absorbed in Slade's plans to re-emerge
from dark depression for a final fling with
life's sensory pleasures. As their excursion
progresses the colonel's colors shine
through. He turns from a bitter alcoholic
veteran who can't get close to anybody into a
bitter alcoholic veteran whose sociability, in
sight and chutzpah exceed those of any
sighted person.
Director Martin Brest fills "Scent of a
Woman" with tension, setting the stage for the
two men to teach and, eventually, save each
other.
Though Pacino's comedic torrents (and
even O' Donnell's sporadic zingers) make
the two and a half hours fly by, the interplay
and sharp dialogue between the two charac
ters is where the movie excels.
O'Donnell, playing the prep student role
once again, delivers far more than a victim
ized baby face performance. He lays low at
first, playing the straight man against Paci
no's torrential 'Hoo-wah' cynicism — then
suddenly rises from passivity when the
drama peaks, without losing the character
already established.
True, it's long, but good writing and Paci
no's mastery make "Scent of a Woman" cer
tainly worth your while. It is a film unafraid
to face disconcerting conflicts up close, and
it comes full circle just when you want it to.
