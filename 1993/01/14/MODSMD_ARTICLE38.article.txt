Driven by anger:
Nails succeed in
redefining noise

Nine Inch Nails

Someone out there really pissed off Trent
Re/.nor.
If that's the impression you got when
you first listened to "Pretty Hate Ma
chine" a few years ago, then don't be sur
prised to hear the thick wall of angry noise
coming at you through your speakers on
Nine Inch Nails' new EP, "Broken." And if
that's not enough, then pick up "Fixed,"
which gives a new meaning to the concept
of noise.
It only takes one look at the album pack

aging to realize it won't be another "Pretty
Hate Machine." Not only is "Broken" pack
aged with a cardboard, 3-sided flip-out
booklet design, but it also includes a small
3" CD with two extra tracks. Considering
that the two extra tracks could have easily
joined "Broken*"s six existing tracks, it's
still hard to figure out why they needed to
package everything separately.
Regardless, "Broken" is still very satisfy
ing. The first track is nothing but hard
noise. The second track, "Wish," is a bit
more familiar, with a sound reminiscent of
"Head like a Hole," the song that made
them famous.
Every track is just as angry and driving as
the last. Even the two tracks on the mini-
CD are in the same vein. "Broken" sports a
harder, more punk sound than "Pretty Hate
Machine" — with fewer ominous over
tones.
"Broken" was the product of a lot of
anger about the group's experiences with
the company that produced their first

album. So it's no coincidence that some
tracks have titles like "Happiness in Slav
ery" and "Help me I am in Hell."
"Fixed," the companion CD to "Bro
ken," features remixes of several tracks off
"Broken," including "Wish." You'll be
particularly impressed by the reemer
gence of the industrial sound that was
missing in "Broken." But be warned,
some mixes contain the same kind of an
noying noise-editing present in their
older single "Sin," which makes you jump
to your feet and race to the CD player to
see what's wrong.
Nonetheless, both "Fixed" and "Broken"
are perfect for each other, and are a must for
any Nine Inch Nails fan. If you're looking
for the more ominous, industrial sounds,
though, you'll probably have to wait until
Reznor completes his new album, which
he's recording in the house where — to his
surprise — the Manson girls murdered
Sharon Tate.
