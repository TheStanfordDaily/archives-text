They've got it all wrong.
Drinking is an art form, a

just a party distraction or a

the triumph of freedom over

sing the body intoxic. With

Or maybe it's just getting

Either way, the following will

TEQUILA SUNRISE
Aah! Sunrise at the dish — tequila sunrise
that is, and what better way to start the day
than with this fruity tequila mix praised in
both an Eagles song and a Kurt Russell
movie?
The colors of this drink mirror the colors
of nature set out before you — you can even
put an orange slice "dish" in and pretend
you're picking up weird martian vibes (it's
really the alcohol, of course).
If you prefer something a little softer, a glass
of wine might be appropriate. Intermission
suggests Chablis, a dry, straw-colored wine
with a flinty taste, or Pouilly Fuisse, a dry,
white, fruity — almost racy — wine.
Whether cactus juice or Chablis, one glass
will suffice. Remember, you still need to find
your way back to campus, and the day has
just begun.

Winner of the 1965 Australian National
Cocktail Competition, the tequila sunrise is a
colorful, fruity drink with a layered appear
ance caused by the varying thicknesses of its
components. To make a sunrise, fill cocktail
shaker with crushed ice, and add two parts
tequila; one part each of Galliano (an Italian
herb liqueur), creme de banane and cream;
four drops of grenadine and a squeeze of
lemon juice. Shake once, and strain into a
glass.
COOP SHIP LOLLIPOP
While some Stanford physicists have made
the physics of beer a serious subject of study,
the propriety of mixing science and swill
must be questioned. Indeed, the first thing
every drinker must know is that to every
thing there is a season — a time to be born, a
time to die and yes, even a time to be sober.
For your early morning Physics 63 class,
then, we suggest a sober drink for a sober
subject: the Shirley Temple. This little dar-
ling is created by filling a tall glass with ice
(crushed only, please), pouring in Ginger
Ale and adding a dash of grenadine. The
classic drink is statutorily topped with a
maraschino cherry skewered on a plastic
sword. Gaudy pink and syrupy-sweet, it's the
perfect match for wave-particle duality.

If you want something a little harder, try
Shirley's big brother — the Roy Rogers. This
drink substitutes Coke for Ginger Ale and is
about as light as that exciting electromagnet
ism textbook, the perfect companion for the
study of bosons and other heavy particles.
It is crucial, if ordering the Roy Rogers, to
take care with your speech. Intermission
once witnessed a semantic boo-boo in which
a lad who had ordered the sweetened soda
was given not a Roy Rogers, but a Rob Roy
— half scotch, half sweet vermouth, with a
dash of Angostura bitters. Both drinks are
served with a cherry, further complicating
the bartender, no doubt, as well as the child,
who seemed less that pleased by the foul
tasting (at least to an eight-year-old) bever
age before him.
99 BOTTLES OF BEER ON
THE WALL
You avoided getting tanked at the physics

tank, but seeing that wall on
the way out has put you on an
existential search for the
meaning of that looming
physics tank wall. A little
Frisbee at the oval is just the
thing to take your mind off
abstraction, and the perfect
distraction for Frisbee is beer.
Noon "would be a good
time for beer,"says senior Rob
Frost, co-founder of the
Stanford Brewing Society. "A
nice light beer, a thirst
quencher." He suggests a lager
— a light beer fermented at a
colder temperature than most
other beers.
Intermission recommends
locally produced Anchor
Steam, a fine brew that isn't
heavy and won't slow your
game down. Of course, Henry
Weinhard's, the unofficial
beer of The Stanford Daily, is
pretty good too.

In case you were wondering, the color of
beer is determined by the amount of barley
used to make the beer — the more barley,
the darker the beer. Barley, Frost said, is one
of the three main beer ingredients, along
with yeast and hops, and gives beer most of
its characteristic thickness and taste.
The alcohol in beer comes from yeast act
ing on the sugar in the barley, and converting
it to alcohol, Frost said. The hops give beer
its bitter palate, he added.
HOW DRY I AM
A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and — a dry
lakebed? Full, empty or just muddy, Lake I.ag
is still just about the best place on campus
for a picnic, and no afternoon at the lake
would be complete without the proper
refreshments.
If is dry, try a drink to mirror that
mood: a dry Martini. This most classic of
cocktails is what all those actors drank in the
1940s movies you watch, and tastes like a

forest floor to all but the cultural elite. To
create the drink, put some ice in a glass, and
add equal parts gin and dry vermouth. Mix
and strain into a cocktail glass, and plop an
olive on top.
If Martinis don't float your boat (and if
Lake Lag will), beer and wine are also appro
priate for the occasion.
"I think it would be awesome, sunset at
the lake with a bottle of wine," said graduate
student John Hoekstra, a former member of
the Stanford Wine Circle.
Frost said beer at Lag sounded like a good
idea to him: "If there's water, watch it, and if
there's no water, watch the weeds."

According
to Hoekstra,
selecting a wine is not an exact science. As a
rule of thumb, he said, white wines should,
generally be consumed within 5-7 years, and
red wines can be kept longer. Some wines —
such as Gamay Beaujolais — should be con
sumed as soon as possible, he said.
Also, the most expensive wines aren't
always the best. "I don't think price is neces
sarily a valid indicator of quality,"
Hoekstra said. Most of the wine he buys
is less than $7 a bottle, he added.
I GET NO KICK FROM
CHAMPAGNE
The Rodin Sculpture Garden is surely
the classiest place on campus. Almost
sacred, it is the perfect spot to meditate,
enjoy the fabulous art or spend a roman
tic evening.
No matter which activity you choose,
only a swanky drink will do: Champagne.
If you think Champagne will put you in
the poor house, think again. Cook's
Champagne, for example, can generally
be bought with the change found
between couch cushions, which, unfortu
natcly, is what it tastes like. Don't be so I *7
cheap — the garden's free, so spend a lit \ )
tie more on the bubbly.
Hoekstra said the sculpture garden

would be an appropriately subdued place for
other wines as well. So, if you've been saving
that bottle of Burgundy for a special occa
sion, now you know what to do.

Champagne, classically speaking, is a
sparkling wine made from grapes grown in
the Champagne region of France, located
east of Paris and south of Reims, along the
Marne river. The effervescence in the wine
comes from the addition of yeast and sugar
just before bottling, causing carbon dioxide
to be released into the wine.
Most commercial Champagnes are made
from blends of wines from different areas,
and sometimes from different vintages, thus
the brand name on Champagnes tends to be
more important than the vintage or vine
yard listed.

SMOKE GETS IN
YOUR EYES

If the Rodin sculptures have put
you in a classy mood, why not go
somewhere posh for dinner.
Intermission suggests you

eschew food service, no
matter how tasty the pizza
sticks might be, and head
to the Faculty Club for
dinner.
While at the Club,
the thing to do is sit in a
deep, plush chair, sipping
Port — a sweet dessert
wine — and smoking cigars
while discussing Moliere or,
more likely, basketball.
Very, very high-brow.
All right, so
Intermission doesn't know
if the Faculty Club has
Port or allows smoking.
Intermission doesn't even
know if students are
allowed in the faculty club
without a professorial
escort, but if anyone tries

to stop you, just look them straight in the
eyes and say, "I didn't work my ass off writ
ing articles and getting tenure to be ques
tioned by an undergraduate." That'll stop
them dead in their tracks.

Made in Portugal, Port is a fortified wine
with a higher alcohol content than most
wines. It contains about 20 percent alcohol,
compared to the 12 percent most wines con
tain.
To make Port, crushed grapes are allowed
to ferment only about half the normal time.
The juice from the grapes is then drawn off
into casks containing grape brandy with a
high alcohol content. This stops the fermen
tation of the grape juice, and the end prod
uct is sweet, heavy Port.
DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT HISTORY
You've spent enough of the day looking at
sunsets and sculptures. It's time to get down
to the serious business of Stanford — study
ing your heinie off.
But as you head to Green Library for an
exciting look at that book on the Weimar
Republic, remember that studying doesn't
have to be all that bad. A nip of spirits can
pep up even the most ancient history.
For your studying pleasure, Intermission
recommends pouring a hint or Schnapps —
peppermint is a good flavor — into a glass
of coffee. The caffeine in the coffee will help

keep you awake (while
the booze and the book
try to put you to sleep),
and the zip of the

Schnapps livens up the
night. The hardest part
of this is sneaking it
past the library guards,
especially that one who
seems to search a little
too thoroughly ...
Schnapps in coffee isn't
the only kind of coffee
drink available by a
long shot. Many tasty
concoctions can be
made when java meets
hooch.
Irish coffee, for exam
ple, is made by pouring
a few spoonfuls of sugar
and a shot of Irish

whiskey into a cup of
coffee, with a dollop of
cream on top. Any
liqueur is good in coffee:
Intermission suggests
Kahlua, a coffee-flavored
liqueur, orange-flavored
Grand Marnier or
Bailey's Irish Cream.
TEQUILA!
What can match the
wild abandon, the near
riotous devil-may-care
atmosphere of Flicks?
Tequila shooters, of
course, the perfect pre
film drink. While toss
ing paper wads at your
friends with one hand,
you can toss shots of this
amber liquid — down
your throat — with the
other. Go ahead — you
worked hard, you
deserve it.
And, once the
movie is over and your
day is done, it's time for

you to stumble off to bed.
Before going to sleep, remember your final
drink of the day: a whole lot of water. Not
terribly thrilling, but you'll thank yourself
for it in the morning.

The standard procedure for tequila shots
is to drink the tiny glass dry of liquor in one
gulp, and then squeeze a bit of lime juice
into the mouth, followed by a pinch of salt.
Lemon can certainly be substituted for the
lime.
Sometimes, between the tequila and lime
steps a sip of Sangrita is taken. Sangrita is a
mixture of tomato and Tabasco sauce, and
gives a little extra kick to the drink.

there's no water, watch the weeds."

According
to Hoekstra,
selecting a wine is not an exact science. As a
rule of thumb, he said, white wines should,
generally be consumed within 5-7 years, and
red wines can be kept longer. Some wines —
such as Gamay Beaujolais — should be con
sumed as soon as possible, he said.
Also, the most expensive wines aren't
always the best. "I don't think price is neces
sarily a valid indicator of quality,"
Hoekstra said. Most of the wine he buys
is less than $7 a bottle, he added.
I GET NO KICK FROM
CHAMPAGNE
The Rodin Sculpture Garden is surely
the classiest place on campus. Almost
sacred, it is the perfect spot to meditate,
enjoy the fabulous art or spend a roman
tic evening.
No matter which activity you choose,
only a swanky drink will do: Champagne.
If you think Champagne will put you in
the poor house, think again. Cook's
Champagne, for example, can generally
be bought with the change found
between couch cushions, which, unfortu
natcly, is what it tastes like. Don't be so I *7
cheap — the garden's free, so spend a lit \ )
tie more on the bubbly.
Hoekstra said the sculpture garden

would be an appropriately subdued place for
other wines as well. So, if you've been saving
that bottle of Burgundy for a special occa
sion, now you know what to do.

Champagne, classically speaking, is a
sparkling wine made from grapes grown in
the Champagne region of France, located
east of Paris and south of Reims, along the
Marne river. The effervescence in the wine
comes from the addition of yeast and sugar
just before bottling, causing carbon dioxide
to be released into the wine.
Most commercial Champagnes are made
from blends of wines from different areas,
and sometimes from different vintages, thus
the brand name on Champagnes tends to be
more important than the vintage or vine
yard listed.

SMOKE GETS IN
YOUR EYES

If the Rodin sculptures have put
you in a classy mood, why not go
somewhere posh for dinner.
Intermission suggests you

eschew food service, no
matter how tasty the pizza
sticks might be, and head
to the Faculty Club for
dinner.
While at the Club,
the thing to do is sit in a
deep, plush chair, sipping
Port — a sweet dessert
wine — and smoking cigars
while discussing Moliere or,
more likely, basketball.
Very, very high-brow.
All right, so
Intermission doesn't know
if the Faculty Club has
Port or allows smoking.
Intermission doesn't even
know if students are
allowed in the faculty club
without a professorial
escort, but if anyone tries

to stop you, just look them straight in the
eyes and say, "I didn't work my ass off writ
ing articles and getting tenure to be ques
tioned by an undergraduate." That'll stop
them dead in their tracks.

Made in Portugal, Port is a fortified wine
with a higher alcohol content than most
wines. It contains about 20 percent alcohol,
compared to the 12 percent most wines con
tain.
To make Port, crushed grapes are allowed
to ferment only about half the normal time.
The juice from the grapes is then drawn off
into casks containing grape brandy with a
high alcohol content. This stops the fermen
tation of the grape juice, and the end prod
uct is sweet, heavy Port.
DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT HISTORY
You've spent enough of the day looking at
sunsets and sculptures. It's time to get down
to the serious business of Stanford — study
ing your heinie off.
But as you head to Green Library for an
exciting look at that book on the Weimar
Republic, remember that studying doesn't
have to be all that bad. A nip of spirits can
pep up even the most ancient history.
For your studying pleasure, Intermission
recommends pouring a hint or Schnapps —
peppermint is a good flavor — into a glass
of coffee. The caffeine in the coffee will help

keep you awake (while
the booze and the book
try to put you to sleep),
and the zip of the

Schnapps livens up the
night. The hardest part
of this is sneaking it
past the library guards,
especially that one who
seems to search a little
too thoroughly ...
Schnapps in coffee isn't
the only kind of coffee
drink available by a
long shot. Many tasty
concoctions can be
made when java meets
hooch.
Irish coffee, for exam
ple, is made by pouring
a few spoonfuls of sugar
and a shot of Irish

whiskey into a cup of
coffee, with a dollop of
cream on top. Any
liqueur is good in coffee:
Intermission suggests
Kahlua, a coffee-flavored
liqueur, orange-flavored
Grand Marnier or
Bailey's Irish Cream.
TEQUILA!
What can match the
wild abandon, the near
riotous devil-may-care
atmosphere of Flicks?
Tequila shooters, of
course, the perfect pre
film drink. While toss
ing paper wads at your
friends with one hand,
you can toss shots of this
amber liquid — down
your throat — with the
other. Go ahead — you
worked hard, you
deserve it.
And, once the
movie is over and your
day is done, it's time for

you to stumble off to bed.
Before going to sleep, remember your final
drink of the day: a whole lot of water. Not
terribly thrilling, but you'll thank yourself
for it in the morning.

The standard procedure for tequila shots
is to drink the tiny glass dry of liquor in one
gulp, and then squeeze a bit of lime juice
into the mouth, followed by a pinch of salt.
Lemon can certainly be substituted for the
lime.
Sometimes, between the tequila and lime
steps a sip of Sangrita is taken. Sangrita is a
mixture of tomato and Tabasco sauce, and
gives a little extra kick to the drink.







// /Is there
'J much
drinking at
Stanford?" pro-fros
often ask their all-

knowing tour guides.
"Naaah. Outside your
typical fraternity par
ties, not that much."

At that, the anxious pro-fro
sneaks a sigh of relief, while
the aspiring frat boy makes a
loud show of disappointment.
They've got it all wrong.
Drinking is an art form, a
gift from Bacchus. More than
just a party distraction or a
cheap form of foreplay, it is
the triumph of freedom over
reality, the separation of spir
it from body. Alcohol lets you
sing the body intoxic. With
proper drinking, everyone is
the strongest, wittiest, sexiest
person on earth. Alcohol is a
rejection of rules, a breaking
of bonds — it is a celebration
of the impromptu.
Or maybe it's just getting
shit-faced.
Either way, the following will
give you innovative ideas for the
right drink at the right time.
And remember, California
state law requires that you
must be at least 21 years of
age to consume alcohol...

ANOTHER
TEQUILA SUNRISE
Aah! Sunrise at the dish — tequila sunrise
that is, and what better way to start the day
than with this fruity tequila mix praised in
both an Eagles song and a Kurt Russell
movie?
The colors of this drink mirror the colors
of nature set out before you — you can even
put an orange slice "dish" in and pretend
you're picking up weird martian vibes (it's
really the alcohol, of course).
If you prefer something a little softer, a glass
of wine might be appropriate. Intermission
suggests Chablis, a dry, straw-colored wine
with a flinty taste, or Pouilly Fuisse, a dry,
white, fruity — almost racy — wine.
Whether cactus juice or Chablis, one glass
will suffice. Remember, you still need to find
your way back to campus, and the day has
just begun.

Winner of the 1965 Australian National
Cocktail Competition, the tequila sunrise is a
colorful, fruity drink with a layered appear
ance caused by the varying thicknesses of its
components. To make a sunrise, fill cocktail
shaker with crushed ice, and add two parts
tequila; one part each of Galliano (an Italian
herb liqueur), creme de banane and cream;
four drops of grenadine and a squeeze of
lemon juice. Shake once, and strain into a
glass.
COOP SHIP LOLLIPOP
While some Stanford physicists have made
the physics of beer a serious subject of study,
the propriety of mixing science and swill
must be questioned. Indeed, the first thing
every drinker must know is that to every
thing there is a season — a time to be born, a
time to die and yes, even a time to be sober.
For your early morning Physics 63 class,
then, we suggest a sober drink for a sober
subject: the Shirley Temple. This little dar-
ling is created by filling a tall glass with ice
(crushed only, please), pouring in Ginger
Ale and adding a dash of grenadine. The
classic drink is statutorily topped with a
maraschino cherry skewered on a plastic
sword. Gaudy pink and syrupy-sweet, it's the
perfect match for wave-particle duality.

If you want something a little harder, try
Shirley's big brother — the Roy Rogers. This
drink substitutes Coke for Ginger Ale and is
about as light as that exciting electromagnet
ism textbook, the perfect companion for the
study of bosons and other heavy particles.
It is crucial, if ordering the Roy Rogers, to
take care with your speech. Intermission
once witnessed a semantic boo-boo in which
a lad who had ordered the sweetened soda
was given not a Roy Rogers, but a Rob Roy
— half scotch, half sweet vermouth, with a
dash of Angostura bitters. Both drinks are
served with a cherry, further complicating
the bartender, no doubt, as well as the child,
who seemed less that pleased by the foul
tasting (at least to an eight-year-old) bever
age before him.
99 BOTTLES OF BEER ON
THE WALL
You avoided getting tanked at the physics

tank, but seeing that wall on
the way out has put you on an
existential search for the
meaning of that looming
physics tank wall. A little
Frisbee at the oval is just the
thing to take your mind off
abstraction, and the perfect
distraction for Frisbee is beer.
Noon "would be a good
time for beer,"says senior Rob
Frost, co-founder of the
Stanford Brewing Society. "A
nice light beer, a thirst
quencher." He suggests a lager
— a light beer fermented at a
colder temperature than most
other beers.
Intermission recommends
locally produced Anchor
Steam, a fine brew that isn't
heavy and won't slow your
game down. Of course, Henry
Weinhard's, the unofficial
beer of The Stanford Daily, is
pretty good too.

In case you were wondering, the color of
beer is determined by the amount of barley
used to make the beer — the more barley,
the darker the beer. Barley, Frost said, is one
of the three main beer ingredients, along
with yeast and hops, and gives beer most of
its characteristic thickness and taste.
The alcohol in beer comes from yeast act
ing on the sugar in the barley, and converting
it to alcohol, Frost said. The hops give beer
its bitter palate, he added.
HOW DRY I AM
A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and — a dry
lakebed? Full, empty or just muddy, Lake I.ag
is still just about the best place on campus
for a picnic, and no afternoon at the lake
would be complete without the proper
refreshments.
If is dry, try a drink to mirror that
mood: a dry Martini. This most classic of
cocktails is what all those actors drank in the
1940s movies you watch, and tastes like a

forest floor to all but the cultural elite. To
create the drink, put some ice in a glass, and
add equal parts gin and dry vermouth. Mix
and strain into a cocktail glass, and plop an
olive on top.
If Martinis don't float your boat (and if
Lake Lag will), beer and wine are also appro
priate for the occasion.
"I think it would be awesome, sunset at
the lake with a bottle of wine," said graduate
student John Hoekstra, a former member of
the Stanford Wine Circle.
Frost said beer at Lag sounded like a good
idea to him: "If there's water, watch it, and if
there's no water, watch the weeds."

According
to Hoekstra,
selecting a wine is not an exact science. As a
rule of thumb, he said, white wines should,
generally be consumed within 5-7 years, and
red wines can be kept longer. Some wines —
such as Gamay Beaujolais — should be con
sumed as soon as possible, he said.
Also, the most expensive wines aren't
always the best. "I don't think price is neces
sarily a valid indicator of quality,"
Hoekstra said. Most of the wine he buys
is less than $7 a bottle, he added.

the classiest place on campus. Almost
sacred, it is the perfect spot to meditate,

No matter which activity you choose,

If you think Champagne will put you in

Champagne, for example, can generally
be bought with the change found

gift from Bacchus. More than
just a party distraction or a
cheap form of foreplay, it is
the triumph of freedom over
reality, the separation of spir
it from body. Alcohol lets you
sing the body intoxic. With
proper drinking, everyone is
the strongest, wittiest, sexiest
person on earth. Alcohol is a
rejection of rules, a breaking
of bonds — it is a celebration
of the impromptu.
Or maybe it's just getting
shit-faced.
Either way, the following will
give you innovative ideas for the
right drink at the right time.
And remember, California
state law requires that you
must be at least 21 years of
age to consume alcohol...

TEQUILA SUNRISE
Aah! Sunrise at the dish — tequila sunrise
that is, and what better way to start the day
than with this fruity tequila mix praised in
both an Eagles song and a Kurt Russell
movie?
The colors of this drink mirror the colors
of nature set out before you — you can even
put an orange slice "dish" in and pretend
you're picking up weird martian vibes (it's
really the alcohol, of course).
If you prefer something a little softer, a glass
of wine might be appropriate. Intermission
suggests Chablis, a dry, straw-colored wine
with a flinty taste, or Pouilly Fuisse, a dry,
white, fruity — almost racy — wine.
Whether cactus juice or Chablis, one glass
will suffice. Remember, you still need to find
your way back to campus, and the day has
just begun.

Winner of the 1965 Australian National
Cocktail Competition, the tequila sunrise is a
colorful, fruity drink with a layered appear
ance caused by the varying thicknesses of its
components. To make a sunrise, fill cocktail
shaker with crushed ice, and add two parts
tequila; one part each of Galliano (an Italian
herb liqueur), creme de banane and cream;
four drops of grenadine and a squeeze of
lemon juice. Shake once, and strain into a
glass.
COOP SHIP LOLLIPOP
While some Stanford physicists have made
the physics of beer a serious subject of study,
the propriety of mixing science and swill
must be questioned. Indeed, the first thing
every drinker must know is that to every
thing there is a season — a time to be born, a
time to die and yes, even a time to be sober.
For your early morning Physics 63 class,
then, we suggest a sober drink for a sober
subject: the Shirley Temple. This little dar-
ling is created by filling a tall glass with ice
(crushed only, please), pouring in Ginger
Ale and adding a dash of grenadine. The
classic drink is statutorily topped with a
maraschino cherry skewered on a plastic
sword. Gaudy pink and syrupy-sweet, it's the
perfect match for wave-particle duality.

If you want something a little harder, try
Shirley's big brother — the Roy Rogers. This
drink substitutes Coke for Ginger Ale and is
about as light as that exciting electromagnet
ism textbook, the perfect companion for the
study of bosons and other heavy particles.
It is crucial, if ordering the Roy Rogers, to
take care with your speech. Intermission
once witnessed a semantic boo-boo in which
a lad who had ordered the sweetened soda
was given not a Roy Rogers, but a Rob Roy
— half scotch, half sweet vermouth, with a
dash of Angostura bitters. Both drinks are
served with a cherry, further complicating
the bartender, no doubt, as well as the child,
who seemed less that pleased by the foul
tasting (at least to an eight-year-old) bever
age before him.
99 BOTTLES OF BEER ON
THE WALL
You avoided getting tanked at the physics

tank, but seeing that wall on
the way out has put you on an
existential search for the
meaning of that looming
physics tank wall. A little
Frisbee at the oval is just the
thing to take your mind off
abstraction, and the perfect
distraction for Frisbee is beer.
Noon "would be a good
time for beer,"says senior Rob
Frost, co-founder of the
Stanford Brewing Society. "A
nice light beer, a thirst
quencher." He suggests a lager
— a light beer fermented at a
colder temperature than most
other beers.
Intermission recommends
locally produced Anchor
Steam, a fine brew that isn't
heavy and won't slow your
game down. Of course, Henry
Weinhard's, the unofficial
beer of The Stanford Daily, is
pretty good too.

In case you were wondering, the color of
beer is determined by the amount of barley
used to make the beer — the more barley,
the darker the beer. Barley, Frost said, is one
of the three main beer ingredients, along
with yeast and hops, and gives beer most of
its characteristic thickness and taste.
The alcohol in beer comes from yeast act
ing on the sugar in the barley, and converting
it to alcohol, Frost said. The hops give beer
its bitter palate, he added.
HOW DRY I AM
A loaf of bread, a jug of wine and — a dry
lakebed? Full, empty or just muddy, Lake I.ag
is still just about the best place on campus
for a picnic, and no afternoon at the lake
would be complete without the proper
refreshments.
If is dry, try a drink to mirror that
mood: a dry Martini. This most classic of
cocktails is what all those actors drank in the
1940s movies you watch, and tastes like a

forest floor to all but the cultural elite. To
create the drink, put some ice in a glass, and
add equal parts gin and dry vermouth. Mix
and strain into a cocktail glass, and plop an
olive on top.
If Martinis don't float your boat (and if
Lake Lag will), beer and wine are also appro
priate for the occasion.
"I think it would be awesome, sunset at
the lake with a bottle of wine," said graduate
student John Hoekstra, a former member of
the Stanford Wine Circle.
Frost said beer at Lag sounded like a good
idea to him: "If there's water, watch it, and if
there's no water, watch the weeds."

According
to Hoekstra,
selecting a wine is not an exact science. As a
rule of thumb, he said, white wines should,
generally be consumed within 5-7 years, and
red wines can be kept longer. Some wines —
such as Gamay Beaujolais — should be con
sumed as soon as possible, he said.
Also, the most expensive wines aren't
always the best. "I don't think price is neces
sarily a valid indicator of quality,"
Hoekstra said. Most of the wine he buys
is less than $7 a bottle, he added.
I GET NO KICK FROM
CHAMPAGNE
The Rodin Sculpture Garden is surely
the classiest place on campus. Almost
sacred, it is the perfect spot to meditate,
enjoy the fabulous art or spend a roman
tic evening.
No matter which activity you choose,
only a swanky drink will do: Champagne.
If you think Champagne will put you in
the poor house, think again. Cook's
Champagne, for example, can generally
be bought with the change found
between couch cushions, which, unfortu
natcly, is what it tastes like. Don't be so I *7
cheap — the garden's free, so spend a lit \ )
tie more on the bubbly.
Hoekstra said the sculpture garden

would be an appropriately subdued place for
other wines as well. So, if you've been saving
that bottle of Burgundy for a special occa
sion, now you know what to do.

Champagne, classically speaking, is a
sparkling wine made from grapes grown in
the Champagne region of France, located
east of Paris and south of Reims, along the
Marne river. The effervescence in the wine
comes from the addition of yeast and sugar
just before bottling, causing carbon dioxide
to be released into the wine.
Most commercial Champagnes are made
from blends of wines from different areas,
and sometimes from different vintages, thus
the brand name on Champagnes tends to be
more important than the vintage or vine
yard listed.

SMOKE GETS IN
YOUR EYES

If the Rodin sculptures have put
you in a classy mood, why not go
somewhere posh for dinner.
Intermission suggests you

eschew food service, no
matter how tasty the pizza
sticks might be, and head
to the Faculty Club for
dinner.
While at the Club,
the thing to do is sit in a
deep, plush chair, sipping
Port — a sweet dessert
wine — and smoking cigars
while discussing Moliere or,
more likely, basketball.
Very, very high-brow.
All right, so
Intermission doesn't know
if the Faculty Club has
Port or allows smoking.
Intermission doesn't even
know if students are
allowed in the faculty club
without a professorial
escort, but if anyone tries

to stop you, just look them straight in the
eyes and say, "I didn't work my ass off writ
ing articles and getting tenure to be ques
tioned by an undergraduate." That'll stop
them dead in their tracks.

Made in Portugal, Port is a fortified wine
with a higher alcohol content than most
wines. It contains about 20 percent alcohol,
compared to the 12 percent most wines con
tain.
To make Port, crushed grapes are allowed
to ferment only about half the normal time.
The juice from the grapes is then drawn off
into casks containing grape brandy with a
high alcohol content. This stops the fermen
tation of the grape juice, and the end prod
uct is sweet, heavy Port.
DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT HISTORY
You've spent enough of the day looking at
sunsets and sculptures. It's time to get down
to the serious business of Stanford — study
ing your heinie off.
But as you head to Green Library for an
exciting look at that book on the Weimar
Republic, remember that studying doesn't
have to be all that bad. A nip of spirits can
pep up even the most ancient history.
For your studying pleasure, Intermission
recommends pouring a hint or Schnapps —
peppermint is a good flavor — into a glass
of coffee. The caffeine in the coffee will help

keep you awake (while
the booze and the book
try to put you to sleep),
and the zip of the

Schnapps livens up the
night. The hardest part
of this is sneaking it
past the library guards,
especially that one who
seems to search a little
too thoroughly ...
Schnapps in coffee isn't
the only kind of coffee
drink available by a
long shot. Many tasty
concoctions can be
made when java meets
hooch.
Irish coffee, for exam
ple, is made by pouring
a few spoonfuls of sugar
and a shot of Irish

whiskey into a cup of
coffee, with a dollop of
cream on top. Any
liqueur is good in coffee:
Intermission suggests
Kahlua, a coffee-flavored
liqueur, orange-flavored
Grand Marnier or
Bailey's Irish Cream.
TEQUILA!
What can match the
wild abandon, the near
riotous devil-may-care
atmosphere of Flicks?
Tequila shooters, of
course, the perfect pre
film drink. While toss
ing paper wads at your
friends with one hand,
you can toss shots of this
amber liquid — down
your throat — with the
other. Go ahead — you
worked hard, you
deserve it.
And, once the
movie is over and your
day is done, it's time for

you to stumble off to bed.
Before going to sleep, remember your final
drink of the day: a whole lot of water. Not
terribly thrilling, but you'll thank yourself
for it in the morning.

The standard procedure for tequila shots
is to drink the tiny glass dry of liquor in one
gulp, and then squeeze a bit of lime juice
into the mouth, followed by a pinch of salt.
Lemon can certainly be substituted for the
lime.
Sometimes, between the tequila and lime
steps a sip of Sangrita is taken. Sangrita is a
mixture of tomato and Tabasco sauce, and
gives a little extra kick to the drink.







// /Is there
'J much
drinking at
Stanford?" pro-fros
often ask their all-

knowing tour guides.
"Naaah. Outside your
typical fraternity par
ties, not that much."

At that, the anxious pro-fro
sneaks a sigh of relief, while
the aspiring frat boy makes a
loud show of disappointment.
