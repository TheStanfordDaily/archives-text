# Asbestos accident leaves profs without offices for a day
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
A freak plumbing accident involving a
chunk of asbestos has evicted several politi
cal science professors from their offices
until tomorrow morning.
An employee repairing a leak in a pipe
above the ceiling in the third-floor offices
"accidentally dislodged some material"
Tuesday afternoon, according to Facilities
zone manager Chuck Charlton.
Until the accident, he explained, the as
bestos was "encapsulated" and did not pre
sent a danger. Then the plumber's hand
slipped. "The tool got away from him and

next thing you know, there was an inci
dent," Charlton said.
The eight offices were immediately sealed
off and the suspicious material "rushed to a
lab with 2-hour turnaround," he added.
When the presence of asbestos was re
vealed, the professors were left without the
use of their offices â€” or their lecture notes,
in at least one case.
"It's an inconvenience to them since they
can't even retrieve files," Charlton said.
Prof. Luis Fraga was one of the displaced
faculty members. "When I arrived this
morning the door . . . was taped shut,"
Fraga said.
"I was told I could not get into my office

at all without a respirator and appropriate
training in working in an asbestos-contain
ing environment," he said.
Lacking lecture notes and a file he need
ed, Fraga said he was forced to use other
notes and reschedule a meeting. "I held my
office hours in the faculty lounge," he added.
Only he and Prof. Lucius Barker use the
offices "all day, every day," Fraga said. The
other faculty members are in their offices
"with much less frequency."
Abatement contractors are currently
working on the ceiling, Charlton said, and
plan to finish today.
Such an incident is rare because asbestos
abatement is usually planned in advance, he

said. If the plumber's tool hadn't "slipped
out of his hand," the repair procedure would
have been "very routine."
The leak leading to the asbestos mishap
was caused by the recent wet weather, but
supervisor of maintenance customer service
Chonna Delany said Facilities has not been
flooded with similar repair requests.
Most of the leaks came with the first
rains, when campus buildings' joints were
dry, she said. "It's been raining so much
that almost everything has swollen."
But whether the rain has been the source
of serious problems is a matter of perspec
tive, Delany added. "It depends if it's your
office or not."
