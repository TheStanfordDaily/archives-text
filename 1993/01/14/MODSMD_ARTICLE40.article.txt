# Pizza, frogs, communal marriages: Winter One-Acts oddly entertaining
## 
### Jennifer Randall Staff writer 
A businessman who abandons his job to spend his
life in bed watching television and eating pizza. A high
school boy who obsessively collects random objects in
glass jars. A young woman who rebels against her par
ents and society by joining a communal marriage.
These unusual individuals are a few of the charac
ters in this year's Winter One-Acts, presented by the
Ram's Head Theatrical Society. Winter One-Acts con
sists of three plays written, directed, produced and per
formed by students.
The three plays, which are each about 30 minutes

long, were chosen from about 20 student submissions
based on their quality and originality. "Each of the
plays has something different to offer; they bring a
unique energy to the stage and a well-rounded
evening," said senior Jason Mayland, the producer.
The first play is "Large Pizza, One Topping," written
by senior Jamie Dycus and directed by Chuck Cohen
and Alistair Fernie. The main character, Carl Curley,
"takes control of his life" by rejecting his nine to five
job in favor of staying in bed, visited only by a frustrat
ed sculptress and a young pizza delivery man named
Walter.

Karen Fox and Ross McCall act out Jamie Dycus' original script in "Large Pizza, One Topping," a Winter
One-Act play.
Ephraim Swanson-Dusenbury,
who plays Curley, and Rob Gor
man, who plays Walter, are convinc
ing as average individuals confused
and frustrated by the status quo.
Dycus said the play raises ques
tions about individuals' obligation
and control. It does not offer a spe
cific solution to these dilemmas, he
said, but allows the actors, direc
tors and the audience to reach their
own conclusions. "It would be
ideal if this play had a different
message for everyone," Dycus said.
The second play, "Frog in a Jar,"
written by senior Corii Liau, is
about "a lot of troubled peo
ple. .. [who] bring out the worst in
each other," according to director
April Minor. This three-person
character drama deals with family
relationships, sexual repression
and difficulties in communication.
Sean McMeekin plays John, a re
pressed young boy obsessed with
collecting things in jars. Lynne
ChristofFerson plays Mona, a lonely
adolescent trying to understand
John's world. And Julie Arnall gives
a particularly affecting perfor
mance as John's dominating moth
er, Windy Sea, who shifts with neu

rotic abruptness between bitter ag
gression and wistful nostalgia.
"After France," written by Scott
C. Roos and directed by Steve
Matthews, is the final play in the
One-Acts. A fast-paced comedy
combined with biting social com
mentary, it tells the story of Marie
(Marjorie Crigler), a young
woman who rejects the hypocriti
cal values of her parents and joins a
communal marriage with her high
school sweetheart and his four
other partners.
Roos, a sophomore, is unafraid
to criticize American institutions
such as religion, capitalism and
traditional marriage. In his view,
traditional families can no longer
survive with children, and com
munal living would solve the prob
lems of income and childcare.
Although some people may disagree
with the social criticism, Roos said
that's fine—he wants people to "have
a good time and also think a little."
Roos hopes his play will "prick
minds and get the idea of commu
nal living into people's heads for
the upcoming century."

Winter One-Acts will be performed
in the Nitery Theater, Jan. 19-23 at 7
p.m. There will also be two perfor
mances at 10p.m. Jan. 21 and 22 and
one at 3 p.m. Jan. 23. The cost to stu
dents is 57; general admission is $9.
