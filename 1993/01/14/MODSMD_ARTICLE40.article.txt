# Pizza, frogs, communal marriages: Winter One-Acts oddly entertaining
## 
### Jennifer Randall Staff writer 
A businessman who abandons his job to spend his
life in bed watching television and eating pizza. A high
school boy who obsessively collects random objects in
glass jars. A young woman who rebels against her par
ents and society by joining a communal marriage.
These unusual individuals are a few of the charac
ters in this year's Winter One-Acts, presented by the
Ram's Head Theatrical Society. Winter One-Acts con
sists of three plays written, directed, produced and per
formed by students.
The three plays, which are each about 30 minutes

long, were chosen from about 20 student submissions
based on their quality and originality. "Each of the
plays has something different to offer; they bring a
unique energy to the stage and a well-rounded
evening," said senior Jason Mayland, the producer.
The first play is "Large Pizza, One Topping," written
by senior Jamie Dycus and directed by Chuck Cohen
and Alistair Fernie. The main character, Carl Curley,
"takes control of his life" by rejecting his nine to five
job in favor of staying in bed, visited only by a frustrat
ed sculptress and a young pizza delivery man named
Walter.
