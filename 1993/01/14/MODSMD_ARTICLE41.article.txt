# Auguste was not so august

The Malibu Fun Center doesn't
even come close. Disneyland pales
in comparison. It's zany. It's
wacky. It's out of control. It's
Rodin's ridiculous romp — the
Rodin Sculpture Garden.
A close look at the garden re
veals far more than angst-ridden
bronzes. Clearly, Rodin did not
intend for this to be just a quiet
place of reflection. No, Auguste
had far greater things in mind.
Lounging luxuriously, cavorting
with those crazies from Calais,
and best of all, discoing with the
devilish dudes who have dramat
ically risen from the dead. Dive
in.
Relaxing reclining
If Cecil H. Green's olive vinyl
seating is putting you to sleep,
then look no further than the gar
dens to find a new significant
place to sprawl your florid flesh.
The two best seats in the house
are two feminine beauties —
"Martyr" and "Cybelle" — fea
turing smooth surfaces, cool
cushioning and rounded corners.
Though they don't offer op
tional heat and massage, new
fangled models can't top them.
Their strength, durability and re
sistance to the elements make
them classic seating to be enjoyed
for years to come.
"Martyr" has gone through
extra pains to provide a crook be
tween her right arm and torso, a
perfect place for you to read while
she writhes in pain. Now, can the
Contour Chair Lounge offer all
that?
But hold on to your seats,
there's more! The other option is

"Cybelle," a larger and more im
pressive perch.
This La-Z-Wo-Man puts all
those boys to shame. Just when
you thought you had gotten too
big to sit on laps, this massive ma
triarch offers two comforting
thighs for your sprawling plea
sure. Since she is a few feet up, you
can even sunbathe or enjoy the
panoramic vista of the gardens. All
from the comfort of your own
throne.
Foot fancy
If going skin-to-skin with "Cy
belle" isn't your idea of a good
time, maybe going toe-to-toe is
more your style. Check out the
"Fallen Caryatid with Stone," who
might also be called "Still Life
With Toe." Her expressive ap
pendage is ripe for a little footsy.
Waiting to be tickled, the toe juts
from the rest of her otherwise
pained body.
Auguste Rodin: Sedate sculptor
or freaky fetishist? Enquiring
minds want to know! A master of
whimsy, he really explored the
meaning of two for toe in this one.
It's just too bad that he wasn't
around to enjoy Madonna's toe
job on the cover of "Erotica."
Meatheads
Just around the corner lie
the massive burgher heads.
The first, "Jean d'Aire" — one
of the Burghers of Calais —
sports a certain disgruntled
air. His jutting chin, pouting
lips and flared nostrils suggest
that his whopper wasn't flame
broiled.
In any case, he didn't get it
his way. So steer clear of this
unhappy meathead, for he is
anything but McLean. Large

and looming, Calais is defi
nitely the Big Cheeze of the
Garden.
The other Burgher, "Head of
Pierre de Wissant," is small fries in
comparison. Lacking the austere
authority of his counterpart, he
simply looks sick.
His is the face one makes after
hearing that "Jack in the Box" jin
gle for the 10th time. Either it was
that or the special sauce on his
Whaler. Whatever the culprit,
Pierre deserves a break today. Give
it to him, and keep walking.
A second rendition of "Jean
d'Aire" resides a few feet away.
Working off his McDonald's meal,
this full-bodied Jean ripples with
flexing pecs, taut biceps and solid
quads. It's just how you'd picture
J.J. Lasley without the football hel
met. Encina could benefit from
such inspiration.
But this time, the massive male
nude has met his match. Looking
like the model for American Glad
iators, "Meditation" flexes her
bulky biceps. Ms. Olympia could
not ask for better form. Lace and
Star of "American Gladiator" fame
pale in comparison.
Disco inferno
But forget all of that, and feast
your eyes on the master's wildest,
most outrageous creation. It tow
ers. It moves. It lives. With hot
moving bodies, pulsating
rhythms and funky forms, the
"Gates of Hell" are a veritable
Disco Inferno.
It's Studio 54 gone wild. Figures
writhe, wriggle and shake their
booty all over the work, as three
hairy-looking Bee Gees look
down with approval. Call out the
