# Triple orkas in the Oval
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
You'd think for $24,000 a year, Stanford
could at least give you good weather.
Yes, the rains have started. No more
sun from now on. No freshmen with clean
butts for the next nine weeks. All you're
gonna see are those oh-so-sporty duck shoes
and the best pseudo-weatherproof tundra
jackets The North Face has to offer.
Suddenly hoods become stylish. Spare
me.
Winter is when all the runners on campus
trade in their Michael Jordan/you-can't-see
I've-put-on-weight shorts for those long,
slinky Spandex tights with strategically con
verging euphoric stripes, kind of like sublim
inal bull's-eyes.
Everyone dons those friendly, body-con
tact-conducive plaid flannel shirts. Plaid
flannel is one of those "I'd have a boyfriend if
I could ever remember the names of any of
the guys I hook up with at parties" kind of
fabrics. People who wear lumberjack shirts
know what kind of a statement they're mak
ing; don't be fooled.
But why not wear it? Hell, go wild; have a
spontaneous wet T-shirt contest in the Quad.
Forget social rules about not wearing white
after Labor Day.
Go to that history section dressed head
to-toe in prim, pristine white, wearing ap
propriately black undergarments. It's about
time to show off those tattoos anyway.
It's going to rain all winter quarter until
the the miraculous reappearance of the sun
on the very last day of spring break, so
you've got to make the most of it. Some sug

gestions:
• Go windsurfing in Lake Lag. There's a
little water out there, and you'll never experi
ence such traffic free bliss again, without the
spring barrage of inflatable rowboaters out
on the high seas. Plus, with the help of some
mud, you should easily overcome those bal
ance problems.
• Try playing slip 'n slide in the Oval dur
ing a really heavy storm. You might not make
the cover of "Approaching Stanford" as you
execute a Triple Orka, but the flower garden
is replanted every graduation, so at least you
won't get in trouble.
• If you're really bored, you can always
scour Junipero Serra for roadkill and pick
them up (with all the biological risks in
mind). Plant your pesky waterlogged friend
in one of the compost heaps located conve
niently around campus to add a new, exotic
smell to your corner co-op. Don't worry, pos
sums are biodegradable, and they look so
cute with their flat profile.
• For the less demented and more acade
mically-oriented, why not try to play little
jokes on ornery professors or serious
honor's thesis candidates in exclusive semi
nar classes? Opening up an umbrella over
your seat in that course on the power of the
Virgin Mary, or leaving one of those
"Sounds of the Tropical Rainforest" tapes
playing in your backpack can make others
wonder why they let psychos like you in to
Stanford, or when toucans became indige
nous to Palo Alto.
• Or go to a CIV lecture with a big, floppy
hat on and a whistle. As the lecturer gets a lit
tle boring, whistle to the tune of "Superf
reak." As your classmates scorn you, explain

that you thought it was a rave, and that you
were just trying to liven up the boring parts
of your 50 minutes of euphoria with some
tweet-tweeting. Try the same in a class where
the professor doesn't have tenure.
• Follow the example of your stylish
classmates, cutting out armholes in a trash
bag to keep dry. Only — to clue them in on
the social errors of their ways — remember
to sprinkle some coffee grounds in your
hair, complemented by a banana peel
pinned to one shoulder and a stray panty
liner on your backside. Vomitory body
stench is optional. You wouldn't want to be
too random.
• If nothing else, sabotage the people in
your dorm. Scatter foot-long segments of

toilet paper on the ground in front of the
main entrance/exit door. Then giggle with
glee as your best buddies stomp off to class
with socially stigmatizing Charmin strips
clinging to their LL. Bean shoes.
• If you want to go for the gusto, go to a
frat party clothed in only a raincoat. When
the rent-a-cops ask you for your 1.D., ask
them to hold your coat while you look.
Chances are pretty good that you'll get to step
right on through the door, after they pick the
perfect place to put that stamp allowing you
to consume alcohol.
Winter doesn't have to be a boring season
full of gloom. With a little imagination, you
can be just as silly when when it's wet and
cold as when it's hot and bothered.

playing in your backpack can make others
wonder why they let psychos like you in to
Stanford, or when toucans became indige
nous to Palo Alto.
• Or go to a CIV lecture with a big, floppy
hat on and a whistle. As the lecturer gets a lit
tle boring, whistle to the tune of "Superf
reak." As your classmates scorn you, explain

that you thought it was a rave, and that you
were just trying to liven up the boring parts
of your 50 minutes of euphoria with some
tweet-tweeting. Try the same in a class where
the professor doesn't have tenure.
• Follow the example of your stylish
classmates, cutting out armholes in a trash
bag to keep dry. Only — to clue them in on
the social errors of their ways — remember
to sprinkle some coffee grounds in your
hair, complemented by a banana peel
pinned to one shoulder and a stray panty
liner on your backside. Vomitory body
stench is optional. You wouldn't want to be
too random.
• If nothing else, sabotage the people in
your dorm. Scatter foot-long segments of

toilet paper on the ground in front of the
main entrance/exit door. Then giggle with
glee as your best buddies stomp off to class
with socially stigmatizing Charmin strips
clinging to their LL. Bean shoes.
• If you want to go for the gusto, go to a
frat party clothed in only a raincoat. When
the rent-a-cops ask you for your 1.D., ask
them to hold your coat while you look.
Chances are pretty good that you'll get to step
right on through the door, after they pick the
perfect place to put that stamp allowing you
to consume alcohol.
Winter doesn't have to be a boring season
full of gloom. With a little imagination, you
can be just as silly when when it's wet and
cold as when it's hot and bothered.
