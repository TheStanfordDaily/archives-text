Edward Albees compelling one-act play "The
Zoo Story" tackles man's inability to communicate
in a modern world, a problem that is evident even
today in convenience stores and the ASSU.
The story of two men at a bench in Central Park,
"The Zoo Story" has been performed thousands of
times since its premiere in 1959 and will be pre
sented once more Jan. 13-16 in Eleanor Prosser
Studio, on the second floor of the Drama Dept.
Albee originally became world famous for writ
ing "Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf." Yet due to
its simple, universal themes, his first play, "The
Zoo Story," is as applicable to America today as it
was 34 years ago.
Tickets are $2 at the door, and you can still catch
performances today and Friday at noon, as well as
Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.
You can only kill ants for so long. After awhile,
your mind needs food.
