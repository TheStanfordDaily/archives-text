# The
						Works
## 
### 
Around now most students are breaking out the
crayolas and transforming schedules into multicol
ored surrealistic pieces of self-expression. In their
self-absorption, many of these will miss the real art
on campus, at the Stanford University Art Gallery.
Frank Lobdell: Works, 1947-1992 will offer a
modest but potent sampling of works by the leg
endary Bay Area artist and former professor in the
Stanford MFA program, including paintings,
drawings and prints.
Admission is free, and the exhibit will run from
Jan. 12 to April 25.
