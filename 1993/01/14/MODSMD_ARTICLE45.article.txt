# The 						last word on...
## ...bagels 
### 
A friend of mine from France told me that
until his recent trip to New York he had
thought bagels were supposed to have the
texture of beef jerky.
I take it as a testament to the pathetic state
of bagel technology that a resident of the
Chi Theta Chi house uses a bagel — sus
pended from a string — as a door knocker.
But most Stanford students remain unen

lightened. The poor souls get so excited
about those "fresh bagels" delivered to
houses and dorms. If they only knew that
outside this sheltered oasis of westernism
and academia lies a world of pure, unadul
terated bagelry. The tragedy of it all.
But in this dark tapestry of woe, one small
glimmer of hope peaks through. Gary Gold
stein and Scott Kronenberg have arrived to

replant the fruits of their ancestral roots
right in Stanford's humble Town & Country
shopping center.
At Holy Bagel, they boil their bagels in water,
instead of steaming them like the cheaters do.
It's kind of like the last honest pizza at
Round Table.
Brings a tear to the eye.
