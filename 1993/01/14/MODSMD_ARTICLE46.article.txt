Sex, love, war,
AIDS. Scary,
huh? Those
are opening words by
Santa Monica perfor
mance artist Tim
Miller.
Miller presents an
evening-length manic
and pushy perfor
mance work today
through Sunday at 8
p.m. at Josie's Cabaret
& Juice Joint, on Mar
ket in San Francisco.
It's the story of a
Queer-Boy who jour-

neys through transgressive "homo-sex" to
youthful misadventures in San Fransisco to
romance and apartments on the Lower East
side to trying to save the world by walking
precincts and having public sex on an elec
tion day.
Proceeds benefit ACT-UP San Francisco
and Golden Gate.
Recently awarded a NEA fellowship after
losing his previous one, Miller vows to use
the money to "continue being an activist
slutty queer point of light."
Seems like he has a lot more to say than
the Naked Guy.
• Camerata Musica off Berlin. If
your friends think you need more culture
and you think you eat more than enough
yogurt, maybe you should go listen to Cam
erata Musica of Berlin.
Performing in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on
Wednesday, Jan. 20 at 8 p.m., chances are
you'll get more culture than a quart of
Yoplait.
Including works by Handel, Vivaldi, Tele
mann and Respighi, the concert is per
formed by the celebrated 18-member
chamber orchestra Camerata Musica, visit
ing the U.S.
The concert spans the masters of the Ger
man and Italian Baroque, as well as the clas
sical and contemporary periods.
Tickets are $23 and $21 ($3 off for stu
dents) available at the Ticket Office at
Tresiddcr Union.
It's the best source of culture you won't
have to stir first.
