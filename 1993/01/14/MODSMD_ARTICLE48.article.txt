# Just hoping no bad people come
## 
### 
Only two types of people
threw parties in high
school. Those whose par
ents didn't care and those who
wanted to be cool so badly they let
people carry out pieces of their par
ent's furniture. I never wanted to
find out which one I was.
Besides, there was no reason to
exploit my own parents when there
were other equally cruel and unrea
sonable parents to exploit. As a wise
cannibal once said, "Why eat your
own arm, when this perfectly good

boys' soccer team just crashed into
the side of a mountain?"
Even at college I knew better.
Throwing a party was just a cheap
ploy to gain friends, impress women
and run your own little power trip.
But, I had been taking that free
ride on other peoples' fraternity
dues for too long. I had responsibil
ities to own up to. "This will be
okay," I thought at 1 p.m. last Friday
afternoon, with visions of "cool
ness" already dancing in my head.
"This is college. All the furniture is
University-owned."
It would be fine. I was a senior. I'd
invite a few friends over and we'd
have a few beers, play Pictionary and
watch a movie. Probably a foreign
movie. Probably two friends.
That's not what I wanted. Ever
since high school there was this tiny,
illogical, Dan Quayle-side of me that
screamed, in my best, squeaky,
1977-state-school freshman voice,
"Kegger!" And like most things that
don't concern women, I could quell
this urge only by acting on it.
So from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m., my
friend Ben and I called every man,
woman and child we knew in the
Bay Area, and left messages on their
answering machines. Then we went
to the Liquor Barn to purchase a keg.
Now, kegs, we were soon to dis
cover, do not come in traditional fla
vors like vanilla, chocolate or raw
cookie dough. No, they come in fla
vors like Bud, Coors, Miller and $35
special. We were told we did not
want the $35 special. We did not
argue, it being that the man was
holding a 200-ton metal canister
which he cooly referred to as "a half"
of something.
"You guys gonna have girls

there?"
"There most likely will be some
women attending," I responded, re
membering the well-placed phone
call to my freshman adviser.
"Then you better get light beer.
Guys will hate it, but girls will drink
it, and that will keep the guys there."
His syllogism paused me, but I
somehow sensed that my manhood
was being questioned. So I cleared
my throat and shoved my hand
deeply — yet firmly — into the back
of my pants.
"Not the kind of dames we're
inviting."
He didn't understand either, but
it didn't matter. Men were good,
beer was good and a half of some
unknown quantity is plenty. We all
had a good laugh and he took $158
from my wallet. He said he'd give
some of it back as long as wc brought
back the tap. I told him we hadn't
seen a good one since "The Cotton
Club,"and even that wasn't worth
$158. He slapped me on the back,
laughed and threatened to take
more money.
Feeling good about ourselves and
our genitals, Ben and I headed back
home, where we dragged the heavi
est beverage we ever encountered up
a flight of stairs. Then we circled it,
stabbed it with the tap, yelling "Kill
the pig, spill the blood," and letting
the musty smell of hops fill the air.
This was our night. Women in inap
propriate clothing were going to ap
pear from my closet and Ben and I
were going to give each other hi
fi ves.
Instead, a couple of friends came.
And they talked, and they played
music, and they examined each
other's garter belts — well, one
woman's garter belts, but that's
enough isn't it?
Then they left, and I cleaned up
and tried to lift what now felt like
about four-fifths of Plato's ideal
form of a keg. And I had that sad, re
lieved feeling your mom used to get
when all the relatives left after
Thanksgiving weekend.
And 1 was happy. Because next
year, I won't be able to surround my
self with people I like whenever I
want. Not even with free beer. Not
unless I can dig up those muppet ac
tion figures from my closet at home.
And it's too damn hard to get those
garter belts up Miss Piggy's legs.
"Once, if my memory serves me
well, my life was a banquet where
every heart revealed itself, where
every wine flowed."
I felt like Wayne Campbell.

Joel Stein will invite everyone who
regularly reads his column to his next
party.... Yeah, right. His column will
appear here weekly until he makes
enough money to pay off that keg.
