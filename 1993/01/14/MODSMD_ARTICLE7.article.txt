# Christopher says he didn't know of spying

WASHINGTON (AP) - War
ren Christopher testified yester
day that after reviewing his per
sonal files he still believes he was
unaware in 1968 of the Army's
"covert" surveillance of war pro
testers and civil rights activists.
The secretary of state-desig
nate and member of the Stanford
Board of Trustees told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee on
the opening day of his confirma
tion hearing that he didn't recall
"receiving or reading" any of four
documents in his files at the Lyn
don B. Johnson library detailing
Army intelligence gathering on
civilians.
Republicans said the docu
ments, cited by The Associated
Press in a story Sunday, raised
questions about what Christopher
knew about Army spying and
whether he misled Congress at a
1977 hearing when he denied
"knowledge of any Army surveil
lance of civilians or other Army
covert" programs.
Christopher disagreed in a
written statement to the Senate
committee. In particular, he dis
missed a July 23, 1968, memo that
informed him, then a deputy at
torney general, that Army intelli
gence "operatives" were a primary

source of data on potential civil
unrest in Washington, D.C.
"The word 'operatives' ... is
fully consistent with my 1977 tes
timony indicating my awareness
that the Army had engaged in
non-covert intelligence efforts,"
Christopher wrote.
"I stand by that testimony and
I will not tolerate any such im
proper activities at the State De
partment or elsewhere if I see it in
the government," Christopher
said in his testimony before the
committee.
Christopher, a Los Angeles cor
porate attorney, graduated from
Stanford Law School in 1949 and
is in his fourth term as a trustee.
He served as president of the
board from 1985-88.
The Army conducted wide
spread spying on civilians in the
late 19605, a practice stopped in
1970 and later criticized in Con
gress as unconstitutional. Christo
pher and other Johnson adminis
tration officials have maintained
that for two decades they did not
know about the activities.
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., a
committee member, said the sur
veillance issue raised "legitimate
questions," but added that he did
not "have any concern" about
Christopher's explanation.
Republicans did not question
Christopher about the matter
yesterday. They were waiting to
search for additional evidence
with the arrival of 67 classified
documents from Christopher civil
disturbance files that were not
open to public inspection at the
Johnson library in Austin, Texas.
The hearing is expected to contin
ue today.

In Little Rock, President-elect
Clinton said he has spoken to
Christopher since the reports this
week raised questions Christo
pher's knowledge of Army spying
on civilians in the 19605.
He said that he did not want to
speak for Christopher and that
Christopher will speak for himself
on the issue and draw a distinc
tion between what he really knew
and what the reports suggest he
knew.
"He said he has every confi
dence that in his confirmation
hearings this will be entirely
cleared up," Clinton said. "I now
want it to be fully explored at that
hearing."
