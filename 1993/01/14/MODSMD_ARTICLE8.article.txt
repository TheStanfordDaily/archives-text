WASHINGTON (AP) -
American and allied war
planes raided southern Iraq
and bombed anti-aircraft
missile sites yesterday in a
fiery showdown with Sad
dam Hussein two years after
the Persian Gulf War and a
mere week before President
Bush leaves office.
The 30-minute, nighttime
strike by warp lanes from the
United States, France and
Britain was accompanied by
an order from Bush dispatch
ing about 1,300 American
troops to Kuwait to stand as a
tripwire against any incur
sion from neighboring Iraq.
The bombing fleet included
80 strike planes and 30 sup
port aircraft.
"Preliminary information
indicates the mission was ac
complished," said presiden
tial spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. "All of our planes
have returned to their bases."
The United States had ac
cused Iraq of a lengthy series
of provocations, including
deployment of missile bat
teries in a "no-fly zone," the
firing of a missile from an
Iraqi plane at an American
aircraft and illegal border
crossings into Kuwait.
Iraq condemned the at
tack as "very uncivilized"
but offered to halt cross-bor
der raids into Kuwait. Sad
