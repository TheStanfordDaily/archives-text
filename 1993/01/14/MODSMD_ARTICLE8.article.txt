# U.S. strikes Iraq

WASHINGTON (AP) -
American and allied war
planes raided southern Iraq
and bombed anti-aircraft
missile sites yesterday in a
fiery showdown with Sad
dam Hussein two years after
the Persian Gulf War and a
mere week before President
Bush leaves office.
The 30-minute, nighttime
strike by warp lanes from the
United States, France and
Britain was accompanied by
an order from Bush dispatch
ing about 1,300 American
troops to Kuwait to stand as a
tripwire against any incur
sion from neighboring Iraq.
The bombing fleet included
80 strike planes and 30 sup
port aircraft.
"Preliminary information
indicates the mission was ac
complished," said presiden
tial spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. "All of our planes
have returned to their bases."
The United States had ac
cused Iraq of a lengthy series
of provocations, including
deployment of missile bat
teries in a "no-fly zone," the
firing of a missile from an
Iraqi plane at an American
aircraft and illegal border
crossings into Kuwait.
Iraq condemned the at
tack as "very uncivilized"
but offered to halt cross-bor
der raids into Kuwait. Sad
dam, appearing on Iraqi tele
vision in military uniform,
said, "The criminals have come
back, carrying their hatred and
their evil with them."
President-elect Bill Clinton,
who was telephoned by Bush as
the attack was getting under way,
said, "I think it was the right
decision, done in the right way,"
adding that he cannot rule out
force after he takes office if Sad
dam remains defiant.
The allied bombing was a limit
ed action, confined to militaiy tar
gets and posing no direct threat to
the safety of Saddam, hundreds of
miles away in Baghdad.
Baghdad radio reported that
the raids killed one soldier and
three civilians. The report also

said three soldiers and four civil
ians were wounded.
Bush said the strike demon
strated his seriousness in
demanding that Saddam comply
with the U.N. resolutions that set
terms at the end of the Gulf War.
"You've got to do what you
have to do," he said.
He also said it did not matter
that the bombing came just one
week before he leaves office. "I'm
president untii the 20th and I will
run the foreign policy and make
these kind of decisions as long as
I'm president."
In London, Prime Minister
John Major said the world was
growing increasingly intolerant of
Saddam's defiance.
"I hope this will put an end to
the infringements," Major said.
"If he infringes again, he must
expect us to retaliate again and we

have made it entirely clear to him
that we will certainly do that."
"We stand ready to take addi
tional forceful actions," said
Fitzwater. The military said
about 1,000 soldiers from the Ist
Cavalry Division would fly to
Kuwait and join 300 special oper
ations forces already taking part
in a military exercise there.
U.S. pilots returning to the car
rier Kitty Hawk said they made
double passes over their targets to
make sure they hit the right ones.
They said they encountered only
ineffectual anti-aircraft fire.
Senior Pentagon officials said
Saddam's air-defense capabilities
will have been reduced "very signif
icantly" if the missile strikes were
as effective as initially believed.
Still, they said he had anti-aircraft
missile batteries in the northern
"no fly zone" and elsewhere.

Fitzwater said the bombing
was in retaliation for repeated
provocations by Iraq, including
the deployment of surface-to-air
missile batteries in southern Iraq.
Fitzwater said he could not
judge Saddam's motives but that
it was fair to speculate he was
looking for any weakness as the
United States changes adminis
trations. If that's the case,
Fitzwater said, "he makes a grave
mistake.

been very precise in terms of mak
ing sure that there could be no
