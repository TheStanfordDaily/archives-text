# Conduct policy will be revised by Work Group
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
After reviewing the first draft of the pro
posed Policy on Unacceptable Sexual Con
duct, the University Cabinet sent back the
policy for further revisions yesterday.
The work group responsible for author
ing it will submit a second draft in March.
"We saw a draft; we'll see another," said
Provost Gerald Lieberman. "We just want
ed it to be a little — better."
The policy — which the group has been
working on for more than two years — aims
to incorporate the University's sexual as
sault policy that was written last year and
an updated version of the sexual harass
ment policy into a single, overarching policy
on unacceptable sexual conduct.
Work Group member Doug Dupen,
deputy manager of employee relations, said
the cabinet offered "constructive criticism"
on the policy's "draftsmanship" and sugges
tions to "condense it and organize it slightly
differently."
The ASSU Senate passed a bill Tuesday
night recommending University President

Gerhard Casper delay approval of the policy
until more students are consulted on its
content.
Addressing concerns of insufficient stu
dent involvement, Dupen said "there will be
another chance for student input" as the
group completes its second draft.
"There were students involved (in writ
ing the first draft); there will be more stu
dents involved," said Lieberman. "Student
input is a part of the whole process."
Women's Center Coordinator Rebecca
Bliss said she has already been informally
asked to offer suggestions of student repre
sentatives and groups to contact.
Bliss, a first-year graduate student, said
she hopes the redrafting of the policy will
provide opportunities to offer input for a
broader range of student groups.
For example, Bliss said graduate women,
who "especially felt they had particular
needs that needed attention," said they
were not adequately represented.
"I hope people see this in a positive light
instead of as a setback," Bliss said. "It will
serve to create a strong document
that serves the students and the
faculty on campus."
Fran Gibson, coordinator of
the Sexual Assault Information
Resource Center, said she
hopes "formalized" procedures
will eventually be developed to
allow for student input, focus
ing on addressing confusion
that some students have about
the policy.
"There are points of clarifica
tion that are absolutely essen
tial," she said.
A set of recommendations for
implementation were also submit
ted to be considered upon
approval. Recommendations in
cluded creating a Panel on Unac
ceptable Sexual Conduct to aid
people who have been harassed
and establishing a Resource Cen
ter to provide various sensitivity
training programs.
Gibson added that she and rep
resentatives from Student Affairs
and Cowell Student Health Cen
ter are also concerned about one
of the Work Group's recommen
dations that explores the possibil
ity of combining the student
Resource Center with services for
faculty and staff.
Gibson and the representa
tives have presented a recom
mendation to the group to keep
"current student unacceptable
sexual conduct services" — pro
vided by the Resource Center —
separate from faculty and staff
resources.
