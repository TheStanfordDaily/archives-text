# The 						making of a 'Phobia'
## Students begin production of spy-thriller film 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Last year, it came from SLAC.
This year, it's a phobia.
No matter what you call it, though, Stanford stu
dents are taking another shot at filmmaking on the
Farm.
"It'o a kind of a spy-thriller that takes place on
campus. Innocent man — or student, I guess —
caught up in something bigger than him," said
senior Eric Manchester of "Phobia," the film he
wrote and is currently directing.
Manchester was one of three Stanford under
graduates who teamed up last year to write, produce
and direct the short horror-spoof "It Came From
SLAC." "SLAC" was made entirely on campus with
student actors, and premiered last spring.
For "Phobia," Manchester is working with two dif
ferent partners, producers Brad Nieder, a senior and
Jennifer Kramer, a junior. Manchester's partners from
last year, Chris McKenna and lan Brown, have gradu
ated and are working in film and video production.

Manchester said "Phobia" is a much bigger pro
duction than his last film. Whereas the "SLAC"
script was 30 pages, he said, the "Phobia" script is
about 70 pages. The finished movie should last 75-
80 minutes, he added.
Nieder said auditions for the parts have been held
over the past few days, and the cast and crew will be
announced today. Nieder was also involved in
"SLAC," playing wheelchair user Mr. Porchenko.
Shooting on the film should start next weekend,
he said, and last about six weeks.
"We hope to be done by Dead Week," he added.
Editing will take place during spring quarter,
Nieder said, and the film will premiere at the end of
that quarter.
"Phobia" will cost about $2,500, compared to
"SLAC" 's $1,500 price tag, Manchester said. Fund
ing for the film is currently coming out of the stu
dents' pockets, Nieder said.
In order to raise enough money to pay for the
film's expenses Manchester said the group is apply
ing for a grant from the Undergraduate Research
Office.
