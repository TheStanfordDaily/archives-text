Judge blocks anti-gay law
DENVER (AP) — A judge late yesterday
temporarily blocked Colorado's anti-gay-pro
tection law from taking effect today while he
decides whether to issue a more permanent
order.
The law was to take effect at 12:01 a.m. today.
Denver District Judge Jeffrey Bayless said he
would announce at a 4 p.m. hearing today
whether he would extend the ban. He has heard
testimony in the case all week.
Amendment 2, approved by Colorado voters
on Nov. 3, prohibits state and local governments
from passing laws that protect homosexuals
from discrimination.
Clinton backs Bush on Haitians
LITTLE ROCK (AP) — President-elect Clin
ton, retreating at least temporarily from a cam
pa.gn pledge, said yesterday he would honor
President Bush's policy of forcibly returning
Haitian boat people to Haiti.
"For the time being, this is the right policy,"
Clinton said. He had criticized the policy sharply
during his campaign, leading to widespread
expectations in Haiti that he would overturn it.
"Those who leave Haiti by boat for the Unit
ed States will be intercepted and returned to
Haiti by the U.S. Coast Guard," Clinton said in
a taped message.
Letterman goes to CBS
NEW YORK (AP) — The duel over David
Letterman ended yesterday when he told his
"Late Night" audience he'll be taking his
"Stupid Pet Tricks" and Top 10 lists from NBC
to CBS.
The irascible talk-show host didn't give
details of the move except to say that his last
show on NBC would be June 25. CBS was
expected to announce later yesterday that it had
signed him for an 11:30 p.m. talk show to com
pete against his old friend Jay Leno and NBC's
"The Tonight Show."
NBC didn't say exactly how it would fill Let
terman's 12:30 a.m. slot. The 11-year-old show
had helped the network dominate late-night
television.
NBC Entertainment president Warren Lit
tlefield speaking to reporters in Santa Monica,
Calif., said only that the hour following
"Tonight" would be a comedy show produced by
Lome Michaels, the "Saturday Night Live" pro
ducer.
