# Bush calls hit damaging 4 Iraq sites successful

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Bush declared the military strike on
Iraq "a big success" yesterday and said
he hoped Saddam Hussein "got the
message."
The Pentagon said allied warp lanes
had damaged the four Iraqi air defense
sites they targeted and destroyed one
mobile missile battery. In addition, three
other missile batteries were dismantled
by the Iraqis after the attack, though it
was unclear whether they had been hit.
Administration officials said the limit
ed allied assault demonstrated to a defi
ant Saddam that the United States has
the political will to strike and might do so
again at any time.
President-elect Clinton, meanwhile,
said he would judge Saddam's behavior
by his future conduct but could not imag
ine normalizing relations.
Baghdad scoffed at the attack.
"The aggressive military tyrants
achieved much less than what their sick
minds had dreamed of," said an Iraqi
military communique, which counted
19 dead and 15 wounded from Wednes
day's strike at eight targets in Iraq's
southern "no-fly zone."
But Iraq also said it would cease its
incursions into Kuwait and let United
Nations weapons inspectors resume

their flights.
Meanwhile, Kuwait, which is within
range of Saddam Hussein's artillery,
placed its diminished armed forces on
alert yesterday to brace for possible retal
iation for the allied air strikes on Iraq,
officials reported.
The emirate was calm following
Wednesday's raids by U.S., British and
French warplanes against missile sites in
southern Iraq.
Kuwait also welcomed President
Bush's decision to airlift an armored bat
talion to bolster Kuwait's defenses.
The Pentagon called the attack "a
very small mission" with only 40 planes
bombing Iraqi radar stations and sur
face-to-air missile sites for just 15 min
utes. An additional 70 U.S., British and
French aircraft provided air cover, refuel
ing and other support.
"This wasn't even the second cousin
of all battles," said Pentagon spokesman
Pete Williams.
He said the radar installations in
southern Iraq were "seriously degraded"
and the targeted mobile surface-to-air
missile batteries were either hit by the
allies or dismantled by the Iraqis. One
was hit for sure, he said.
Bush, in an exchange with reporters
in the Oval Office, said, "I think our mis

sion was a big success."
"Let's just hope that Saddam Hussein
got the message," said Bush, who leaves
office in six days. "I hope that he will now
comply with these United Nations reso
lutions."
Later, at a military salute to the out
going president at Fort Myer, Va., Bush
said, "we showed Saddam Hussein once
again that he cannot violate internation
al law with impunity."

Clinton lent full backing to Bush's
decision and said he would not rule out
authorizing force himself if warranted.
In an interview published yesterday in
The New York Times, Clinton said his
message to Saddam was: "If you want a
different relationship with me, you can
begin by observing the U.N. require
ments, and change your behavior."
Bush said it was "a little too early" to
tell if Saddam had gotten the message.
