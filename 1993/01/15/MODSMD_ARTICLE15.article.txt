NEW YORK (AP) - The U.S.
attack on Iraq has overwhelming
public support and a majority wants
further attacks to force Saddam
Hussein from power, according to
national polls released yesterday.
Polls taken Wednesday night by
both ABC News and Gallup found 83
percent approval of the U.S. military
strike.
The Gallup poll, sponsored by
USA Today and CNN, found 59 per
cent in favor of continued military
strikes until Saddam is forced from
the Iraqi presidency. ABC said 84

percent think the United States
should do everything it can to force
Saddam out. That could include
invading Iraq, two in three said.
Majorities in both polls were pes
simistic that Wednesday's air raid
would force Saddam to stop violating
conditions set by the United Nations
in the Persian Gulf War cease-fire
agreement.
ABC said 59 percent think the
United States is heading for another
war with Iraq, and that 46 percent
think the United States should try to
kill Saddam.
