# Clinton picks friends for White House, party posts
## 
### 
LITTLE ROCK (AP) - President
elect Clinton turned to a host of trusted
political advisers for senior White House
posts yesterday and tapped the Chicago
operative who managed his campaign as
the new Democratic Party chairman.
"We will make the White House a
place of teamwork and free flow of ideas,"
Clinton told a news conference in Little
Rock. "I want the best and most creative
advice I can get across the broad range of
areas with which we must deal."
As a sign of his gratitude, Clinton
first chose to introduce David Wilhelm
as his choice to head the Democratic
National Committee. Wilhelm's selec
tion must be ratified by DNC members,
but there is no opposition and it is rou
tine for a winning presidential candi
date to handpick a chairman.

"We have an opportunity to turn the
Democratic Party into a governing
coalition of a majority of Americans for
change," Clinton said in introducing
Wilhelm, who will direct Clinton's polit
ical operation from party headquarters.
Then, after weeks of jockeying and
shuffling that continued until the eve
of the announcement, Clinton released
more than 50 appointments to the staff
of his office and those of first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice Pres
ident-elect A 1 Gore.
Most of those named worked in the
campaign or transition, or both. Twen
ty-three of the appointments went to
women, from press secretary Dee Dee
Myers and domestic policy adviser
Carol Rasco to the entire staff, so far,
of Mrs. Clinton's office.

Dozens of additional lower-level
White House appointments are still
pending, and Clinton aides say it is
unlikely that the president-elect will ini
tially meet his campaign pledge to reduce
the White House staff by 25 percent.
Serving as top deputy to Thomas
McLarty, Clinton's pick for chief of
staff, will be Mark Gearan, a close Clin
ton adviser and top transition deputy
who managed Gore's vice presidential
campaign.
One of Clinton's closest friends,
attorney Bruce Lindsey, got three titles
â€” assistant to the president, senior
adviser and director of the White House
office of personnel, where he will over
see major administration appointments.
Other major players included
George Stephanopoulos, Clinton's

campaign and transition communica
tions director who will now hold that
position in the White House. In a break
from tradition, Clinton aides said
Stephanopoulos would, at least initial
ly, conduct the daily White House press
briefings, a task that usually falls to
the press secretary.
In that role, Stephanopoulos will be
the administration's most visible
spokesman, next to Clinton himself.
And Eli Segal, a Massachusetts
businessman and veteran Democratic
activist who served as Clinton's cam
paign chief of staff, was named to run
the new White House office of national
service. Segal's task is to implement
Clinton's campaign pledge to allow col
lege students to repay college loans by
taking community service posts.
