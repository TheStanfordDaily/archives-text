Snubbing sororities
on housing isn't only
unstellar, its unfair

NO MATTER HOW IT'S
dressed up, the University's
policy of denying housing to
sororities while maintaining Row
houses for fraternities, boils down
to one thing: sexual discrimination.
How unfair is that?
University policy no longer per
mits subjectively selected groups
from applying for row houses,
except for those that have been
grandfathered into the law. In
other words, most of the campus'
fraternities.
And while this policy is based on
a desire to steadily phase out
housed fraternities, there is no jus
tification for this preferential treat
ment to males.
Fraternities have not proven
themselves any more responsible
than the sorority system, and the
reasons sororities originally lost
their housing would be seen as
archaic and sexist today.
The first sororities at Stanford
were founded in 1891, concurrently
with the first fraternities, and until
the disbanding of all Stanford
sororities in 1944, both male and
female groups resided in houses
along the Row.
The decision to eliminate sorori
ties was based on the emotional
impact that rejection had on those
women turned away from Greek
groups. (Contrary to a popular
Stanford myth, no one ever com
mitted suicide by throwing them
selves off of Hoover Tower because
of a sorority rejection.)
However, in 1978, sororities
were allowed to return to campus,
in compliance with Title IX anti
discrimination laws. The conde
scending reasons for which they
were eliminated were no longer
seen as valid, and the allowance of
male-only, but not female-only
groups was seen as gender-based

discrimination.
The question of whether frater
nities should be housed at all is
being questioned on campuses all
over the country now — particular
ly on the legal grounds that they
exclude on the basis of sex. Such
discrimination becomes particular
ly acute when policy prohibits
women from establishing their own
gender-exclusive housing.
To remedy this inequity, the Uni
versity should stray from its gener
al policy of phasing out the housed
Greek system. When fraternities
lose their houses, as did the Betas
last year, those houses should first
become available to sororities and
unhoused fraternities who desire
them — instead of immediately
being turned over to the University.
The option of living in a housed
fraternity or sorority should not be
denied because of the prevailing
politics of the University. Students
should be treated like adults, even
if that means sharing a home with
people who put their names on
mugs with those funny pink paint
pens.
Sororities may very well choose
to remain unhoused social groups.
But they should be given the oppor
tunity to choose.
On a separate but related point,
the University should allow sorori
ties the same leeway they allow the
fraternity system during Rush.
The tent system only allows the
briefest, most-forced meetings —
not to mention annoying all of
Wilbur and Stern. In effect, the
University is saying women are not
mature enough to manage their
own Rush events.
Instead, sororities should be
allowed to do what the fraternities
do: have barbecues, throw single
gender parties and play broomball
in order to meet their future sis
ters. Such an atmosphere would
allow women to make more mature
choices, while ending a sexist policy.
Discrimination is unacceptable in
any form. But it is even more
heinous and hypocritical when com
ing directly from the fine folks who
brought us Residential Education.
