# Program seeking support
## ASSU's outdoors workshops need more backing from University to get trips, training off ground 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
The recently hired director of Stanford's
new outdoor education program, Jeff McKay,
describes some of the experiences students
will have while taking part in the group's trips
as "creative, wild, exciting and powerful."
But in order to implement the RED
WOOD program — Recreational Educa
tional Developmental Workshops Out Of
Doors — McKay said he must first garner
more than just token support from the Uni
versity administration.
"I think how long it takes to get off the
ground is really a function of the support we
get from the different agencies of the Univer
sity," he said. "I have to sort out with the ad
ministration what form the trips will take."
The program was created by the ASSU

last spring with a $74,000 grant from its re
serves.
McKay, said although the group is unique
because it was created by student interest
and funded by student money, they still
must work with the administration on such
issues as storage for the equipment, trans
portation and housing for student leaders
who return to campus early to lead the trips.
According to McKay, REDWOOD is cur
rently working on three main projects: or
ganizing outdoor trips for incoming first
year students, training student leaders for
the trips, and planning weekend outings for
students this auarter.
McKay said the first year tripa are his
biggest challenge because he is unsure of
how the University is approaching them. He
said the administration has been
supportive, but not "actively sup
portive."
He said the trips will either
take place before or after Orienta
tion, but not during it, as was pre
viously discussed.
McKay added that funding is
still an issue because although
some scholarships will be offered
through the ASSU's grant, the
costs could skyrocket if the
administration doesn't help defer
the costs of housing and storage.
"Our goal is that the cost of the
trips will in no way keep any stu
dent away," he said.
The details for first year trips
need to be hammered out by the
end of this quarter or else it will
be very difficult to be prepared for
trips by next September, he said.
The pilot program will consist
of 200 new students. Although

most of the participants will be
freshmen, a few transfers and
graduate students will also take
part in the trip, he said.
According to McKay, there will
be two programs, an outdoor trip
and a service trip, similar to the
alternative spring break program
offered by the Haas Center for
public service.
McKay said it is crucial to set
tle matters with the University by
March so he can embark on the
second aspect of the project — the
training of student leaders during
spring quarter.
He said a leadership program
for this quarter will begin on Jan.
28, and that the program will be
repeated every quarter after that.
The program will focus on
"experiential leadership train
ing," he said, and will consist of
outdoor education, service and
general leadership. Training will
occur on two Saturdays and on
two evenings and will culminate
with a spring break trip, probably
to Pyramid Lake in Nevada.

"It will be a challenging experi
ence," he said. "We're hoping to
draw people from diverse areas of
campus."
REDWOOD'S final project is to
provide outdoor trips and service
trips for current Stanford stu
dents.
McKay said the trips will range
from rock climbing and winter
camping to the exploration of the
Tuolomne River watershed.
"Come spring break," he said,
"there will be a lot more trips."
REDWOOD will hold its first
campus-wide meeting on Jan. 21,
and McKay said he will have a
better idea about what type of
trips to run after the meeting.
McKay, who is a part-time
employee, said he has been very
impressed with the support he
has received from the Office of
Student Activities and expressed
his optimism about the relation
ship with the University.
"REDWOOD is really an
unusual interface between stu
dents and University," he said.
