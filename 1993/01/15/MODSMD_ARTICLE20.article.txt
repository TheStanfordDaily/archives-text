## Knocking out PC wusses 
### 
Last Friday i was the subject of
yet another letter to The Daily,
which compared me to everything
from a rapist to Clarence Thomas. The let
ter was written by a number of students in
a communications class and its professor,
Jeremy Cohen.
What few people may realize, however,
is that my association with Prof. Cohen
dates back two years to when I was a stu
dent in his introductory communications
class. A fellow student and I gave a final
presentation lampooning the multicultur
alism Cohen had been so gleefully ram
ming down our throats for a quarter. That
was when the feces hit the fan.
Cohen forced us to attend a meeting
with him, the teaching assistants for the
class and the class' multicultural advisor,
in which he showered us with his holy
wrath (and a good deal of warm spittle). He
was the royal inquisitor, and, with teeth
clenched and veins popping, he vowed to
drive the "un-P.C." demons from our
tainted souls. He demanded formal apolo
gies to both him and the class.
My friend buckled. I laughed. Cohen
has loathed me ever since.
While Cohen glibly extolled the virtues
of the First Amendment and freedom of
speech, he tried to silence any student who
disagreed with his political agenda and had
the gall to express any deviant opinions.
Prof. Cohen has taken the concept of
white man's guilt to a whole new level,

running around campus with his flaming
sword drawn and looking for someone or
something to defend.
I can just imagine how hard it is for
Cohen to do something as simple as shop
ping at Tresidder Express. First, there is
the thinly-veiled anti-Semitism of the
"JuJußees" in the candy section. He
sprints for the chips section, where he is
accosted with "Cheese Nips," which bla
tantly mock Japanese-Americans.
In a mad dash for the door, he sees the
freezers full of carton after carton of "Fro
Yo." This final slight to African-American
hair and culture prove too much, and he
runs outside, his eyes moist with tears of
righteous indignation.
In their letter, Cohen and his cronies
(including a San Jose State student who
apparently has a little too much time on his
hands) asserted that, with regards to the
women's movement, I "just don't get it."
While this may be true in more ways
than one, I feel it is important to establish
a few facts. First, I am no "misogynist."
Hell, I don't even like back rubs.
Secondly, their assertion that the sole
message of my writing was the promotion
of hatred towards women's bodies was
insulting to anyone with even a fraction of
his or her gray matter in operating condi
tion.
I love every lobe, crevice and odor of
every woman's body on this God-forsaken
planet, and anyone who has seen my vast

magazine collection (many of them illegal
here in the U.S.) can attest to this fact.
Lastly, these insidious Nimrods asked
how my poems would have been received
had they been placed in the context of race,
despite the fact that the column wasn't
even obliquely connected to racial issues.
Most Stanford students are thankfully
smart enough to see through this cheap
inflammatory ploy, as I have received
nothing but overwhelming support from
the men and women of this campus.
The meager space provided here does
not allow room for a comprehensive rebut
tal to their groundless assertions. These
pathetic, humorless clods don't even
deserve my further attention, so I'm going
to lay it on the line.
Let's have it out once and for all, Prof.
Cohen. One on one. Mano a mano. Today.
White Plaza High Noon. No weapons. No
clothes. Nothing but a good old-fashioned
bare-knuckled bout. The time for words
has passed. Put up your dukes, and pre
tend you're a man.

Cohen for a recommendation for graduate
school.
