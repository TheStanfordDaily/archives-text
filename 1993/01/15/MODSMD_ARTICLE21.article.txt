Women get unfair shake in sciences, Daily article

AS WOMEN PH.D. STUDENTS in
electrical engineering, we would
like to comment on the article
"Techie Double Standards" in the Dec. 4
issue of The Daily.
We are pleased that The Daily
addressed the subject of gender bias and
obstacles faced by women in science and
engineering. However, we were dis
turbed by the sexism behind some of the
opinions in the article. Also, because the
article lacked facts and statistics, and
instead presented these opinions undis
puted, it may actually have helped to per
petuate harmful stereotypes against
women rather than to dispel them.
As an example, we challenge sopho
more Steven Hychong's comment, "I
have not met that many female scientists
who are extremely bright. A lot of guys I
talk to have the same view as I do." Had
Hychong's statement pertained to a
racial minority, most people would have
found it inflammatory.

For someone to feel comfortable pub
licly stereotyping and classifying women
in this way indicates to us that the Stan
ford environment is not as non-sexist as
people would like to believe.
Hychong continues, "The standards
for females seem lower than the ones for
males because not enough women are
interested." This is a very serious accusa
tion; obviously, The Daily could and
should have contacted the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions for data. For
The Daily to omit further statistics to
support or refute Hychong's opinions
gives them the weight of undisputed fact.
Why are there so few women scien
tists and engineers? There have been a
number of concrete studies about the
biases and obstacles faced by women in
technical fields that The Daily could have
referred to in order to find the answer to
this question. To list just a few:
• Our social environment has an effect
on young girls and their career choices.

By age three, girls want to be "a mommy,
a teacher or nurse," while boys, "a doctor
or a boss."
• Average people seem to think that
men are "more analytical" and women
are "more verbal," although no biological
proof has ever been found to support this
claim.
• Once a woman gets into graduate
school or a technical industry, the pre
dominantly male environment can fre
quently be an obstacle to working effec
tively.
• A study by the Office of Technology
Assessment shows that women experi
ence lower pay and fewer promotional
opportunities than male counterparts
with virtually identical backgrounds.
• A subconscious bias against women,
although often difficult to identify, has
been demonstrated in numerous studies.
Subjects consistently rate technical arti
cles thought to be written by women
lower than the very same articles when

thought to be written by men. Similarly,
department chairs were asked to review
resumes of prospective professors; they
ranked a resume significantly higher
when it had a male name on top than the
very same resume with a female name on
top.
We ask The Daily to do a follow-up
article incorporating facts such as those
outlined above and emphasizing inter
views with women — especially graduate
student and professors.
We hope that members of the Stan
ford community, after hearing our per
sonal experiences and relevant facts, will
give women scientists and engineers the
same credibility they give their male
counterparts.
