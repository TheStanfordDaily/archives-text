# SEAS members support Earth Day, feel they are making a difference
## 
### 
We are writing in response to your
Wednesday editorial that criticized
Earth Day for not revolutionizing the
world overnight. Today's environmental
problems are a result of years of destruc
tion, neglect and short-sighted vision; we
can not expect them to go away as a
result of a single event.
Earth Day is a part of on-going envi
ronmental movement that aims to
regain respect for our surroundings.
Earth Day is a time for environmental
ists to rededicate themselves to the
cause and is a time for newcomers to
recognize the self-destructive nature of
the present system.

Students for Environmental Action at
Stanford and the environmental move
ment as a whole work throughout the
year to coordinate positive social change.
Earth Day creates the energy, enthusi
asm and inspiration needed for our work
to continue.
The Daily editorial makes reference
to the slogan "you can make a differ
ence," which has been used so often it
has lost its impact. Just by saying the
words "you can make a difference,"
nothing is going to change. Rather, it
must be accompanied by action.
Despite The Daily's skepticism, some
individuals already have made mfyor
adjustments in their lifestyles to benefit
the environment. As more and more indi
viduals change their lives, our environ
mental problems can be reduced at a faster
rate. Events such as Earth Day serve to
educate people on what actions can be

taken to reduce waste and energy use.
As each Earth Day passes, more join
the movement and stay in it year-round.
No, Earth Day isn't a miracle drug, and
it doesn't replace on-going efforts. Yet, it
is a day to remember the urgency of our
struggle.
