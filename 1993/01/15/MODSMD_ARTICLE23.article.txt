# Columnist only 'tickles' himself, should get the can from Daily staff
## 
### 
Consider this letter a "vote to the edi
tor" â€” get rid of "columnist" Pete
Huyck and replace him with a real

columnist.
Huyck is neither enlightening nor
entertaining. He seeks only to tickle his
own funny bone and serves no journalis
tic purpose whatsoever.
Do us a big favor and hire a new
columnist.
