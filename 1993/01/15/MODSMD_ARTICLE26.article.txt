## Loud crowd, Cal squad blow Cardinal out of Harmon, 83-66 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY — Before a national
television audience, California was not
Kidding around. Sophomore forward
Lamond Murray scored 24 points as the
Golden Bears dominated Stanford 83-66
at Harmon Gym in Berkeley last night.
"Cal just flat out beat us in every
phase of the game," said coach Mike
Montgomery. "It could have been worse
and probably should have been worse."
Another poor shooting outing by the
Cardinal and a lack of rebounding at
either end of the floor were the cause of
Stanford's (6-9, 1-2 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) demise. In the first half alone,
Cal's offensive rebound total of 16 sur
passed Stanford's overall total of 13
boards. Cal's stronger big men proved to
be too tough for the injury-depleted
Stanford. Coach Montgomery's front
line rotation of Jim Morgan, Bart Lam
mersen and Todd Manley were worn
down inside by an endless series of Bear
attackers. Iryured freshman starter Dar
ren Allaway was sorely missed.
It appeared that it could get ugly early
as Cal (8-3, 2-1) raced out of the gate to
score the game's first eight points, cour
tesy of forwards Lamond Murray and
Alfred Grigsby, before Stanford could
even get on the board.
But the Cardinal placed itself tem
porarily back in contention behind Mar
cus Lollie and a seemingly resurgent
Brent Williams, who gave Stanford a
one-point cushion at the 11:37 mark.

The teams continued to trade baskets
until a television timeout broke the Car
dinal's concentration. Jason Kidd
responded to a Brent Williams jumper
with a short hook in the key to start the
Bears' spurt. After Brian Hendrick con
verted one-of-two free throws, Alfred
Grigsby rocked Harmon Gym with a
leaning one-handed dunk from the left
side. Stanford then proceeded to make a
series of turnovers and Cal, with support
from a standing-room-only crowd, put
the game out of reach with a 16-2 run
before halftime.
"The first half was unbelievable,"
Montgomery said. "It's the worst half
from a Stanford basketball team I've
seen since I've been here."
The second 20 minutes proved to be
no different, as Cal proceeded to get
numerous second and third-chance shot
opportunities inside. Grigsby, who tied
his career high with 19 points, was par
ticularly adept in the offensive glass, tal
lying six rebounds.
"We let him shoot at his range, and
his range is the dunk," Montgomery
said.
Once again, Dion Cross proved to be
the lone bright spot for Stanford, finish
ing with 17 points off the bench and
playing tight defense on Jerod Haase.
Cal employed a pressure defense that
rattled the Cardinal ball-handlers to no
end. On the night, Stanford committed
an uncharacteristic 21 turnovers.
"I felt the press set the tone early, and
our mixing of defenses was very effec
tive," said Cal coach Lou Campanelli.

"The one thing that we've done well
all year is to take care of the ball, but
tonight the guys treated it like it was a
hot potato — no one wanted anything to
do with it."
Bear freshman playmaker Jason Kidd
had a game-high seven assists along with
eight points, including an ally-oop pass
to Grigsby with just over six minutes left
that brought down the house, accentuat
ing the victory.
"We just wanted to make sure that we
went out and beat Stanford the way that
they beat us last year," Grigsby said.
