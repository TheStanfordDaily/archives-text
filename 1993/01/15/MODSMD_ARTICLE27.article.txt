# An unfortunate lesson in Montgomery's Law
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
BERKELEY — You've heard of Mur
phy's law. Last night, the Cardinal
demonstrated Montgomery's law.
Anything that can possibly go wrong
will — at Berkeley.
"It seemed like everything that could
go wrong went wrong," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery following
his team's 83-66 loss to California last
night. "We just couldn't win the game
with the performance we had out there."
Stanford came into a packed Harmon
Arena and gave the home fans plenty to
cheer about. The Cardinal.. oouWc't
seem to get anyone to score consistent
ly. California also took advantage of
chronic breakdowns in Stanford's
defensive coverage to lay in easy baskets
and dunks, as Stanford's defense looked
increasingly unorganized throughout
the game.
Still, the Cardinal played the first
15 minutes as if it was going to be a
tight game. Stanford tied the game at

26-26 with just over five minutes left
in the first half, thanks to a number
of missed shots by the Golden Bears.
But the Bears quickly recovered from
their early sluggishness to go on a 16-
2 run, going to the locker room up 42-
28.
"We were fortunate to be down 14,"
Montgomery said. "We really didn't
compete at all, and just didn't give our
selves a chance to win the game."
For head coach Lou Campanelli and
the Bears, however, nothing could go
wrong. Lamond Murray and Alfred
Grigsby combined for 43 of California's
83 points, most taken from the paint,
and electrified a deafening Harmon
Gym crowd.
"As long as we kept the pressure on
and kept the crowd in, we knew we
could wear them down," Campanelli
said.
Stanford's problems mounted in the
second half. The Bears ran their lead to
as many as 18 points behind Grigsby and
Murray, and got a great deal of help from
a floundering Stanford defense. The Car

dinal turned the ball over 21 times in the
game, was consistently outrebounded
two and three times under the net and
never got its offense on track.
The bright spot for the Cardinal
again was freshman Dion Cross, who
came off the bench to lead all Stanford
scorers with 17 points and, along with
Marcus Lollie, comprised what little
offense Stanford had.
"Boy, he's a fine young player,"
Campanelli said of Cross. "He is going
to be a great player."
Montgomery had similar praise for
the freshman. "Thank God for Dion
Cross," Montgomery said. "Dion's just
playing — he takes the ball and figures
it's time to play basketball.
Cross's play over Stanford's past two
games has many Cardinal fans wonder
ing when they'll see him in the starting
lineup.
"It won't be much longer," Mont
gomery said. "We've got a real dilemma
personnel-wise, and it's just a question
of getting a group of kids on the floor
that can play."
