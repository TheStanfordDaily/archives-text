# Cardinal looks to tear apart Golden Bears tonight in Maples
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
When the Stanford women's basket
ball team battles California tonight at
Maples Pavilion, more will be at stake
than just the Cardinal's 24-game home
winning streak and its position atop the
Pacific 10 Conference. The No. 4 Stan
ford (11-2, 2-0) squad also will be play
ing for pride as it hopes to destroy its
cross-bay rival.
The Cardinal is riding a wave of
momentum after three convincing wins
last week over No. 17 Texas, Oregon
State and Oregon. And with all week to

prepare for the Bears (9-2, 1-1), it
appears that Stanford will make things
quite difficult for Cal.
"This week, practice is going really
well," said Cardinal head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "Usually when we practice
well, we also play well."
In order to keep the contest close, the
Bears must place constant pressure on
senior stars Val Whiting and Molly
Goodenbour. Whiting reached double
figures in points and rebounds the past
three games, and Goodenbour has aver
aged 14.2 points and 6.5 assists on the
season.
But lately, other Cardinal players

have also made substantial contribu
tions and, as a result, VanDerveer has
had the luxury of giving many people
considerable playing time.
"When people play well, it gives me a
lot of flexibility," said the eighth-year
coach. "We're really able to play eight
or nine people."
Nevertheless, the Bears are enjoying
one of their best seasons so far, and
they should prove a formidable chal
lenge for the Cardinal. Led by senior
guard Milica Vukadinovic (16 points
and 6.5 assists per game), four Cal play
ers are averaging double figures in
points.

VanDerveer explained that part-time
Stanford starter Kate Paye, one of the
top defensive players on the Cardinal
squad, will be assigned to guard
Vukadinovic and thwart the Bear
offense.
"Kate is starting because she plays
excellent perimeter defense," she said.
"We call her the spoiler because she
kind of brings [people's scoring aver
ages] down. She shuts them down."
After being upset by the Bears at
Berkeley last year and barely beating
them at home later in the season, the
Cardinal is hoping to send a message to
its rival tonight in what should be one

of Stanford's most exciting home games
this year.
Cardinal Notes
Tip-off time for tonight's game has been
changed from 7:30 to 8:00 p.m. in order to
accommodate live television coverage. . . .
The first 1,500 students will once again gain
free admission. . . . With 972 career
rebounds, center Val Whiting needs 25 more
boards to break the Pac-10 record of 996 set
by Stefane Kasperski of Oregon. ... It is
expected that Whiting, Stanford's all-time
leading rebounder, will achieve this feat
sometime next week, either against UCLA or
use.
