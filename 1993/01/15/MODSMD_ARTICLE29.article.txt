# Gymnasts upend Moscow squad
## 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
In the relaxed spirit of last
night's meet, the music of INXS
played in Burnham Pavilion as
the Stanford men's gymnastics
team opened its home season in
a exhibition meet against the
University of Moscow. In a close
finish, the defending NCAA
champions edged out the Rus
sian team by a score of 258.37 to
250.80.
"The guys are still learning
their new skills," said Cardinal
head coach Sadao Hamada.
"They missed some of their rou
tines, but their trick sequences
are looking much better."
Stanford captured first place
in each of the individual events
with seniors Jeff Bender and
Jair Lynch securing top scores,
leading the team to an overall
victory.
Pleased with the team's per
formance, Hamada's goals for
the end of the season, specifical
ly qualifying for the NCAA
championships, are "right on
schedule."
"Since it is still so early in the
season, we are taking extreme
caution to stay healthy and grad
ually trying to improve our con
sistency and executions. The
groundwork is being laid and by
mid-February we should be

going strong," said Hamada.
Bender finished first both on
the pommel horse with a 9.75
and on the rings with a 9.70.
Also capturing two first-place
spots was senior co-captain Jair
Lynch. He followed his score of
9.20 on the high bar with a spec
tacular 9.5 parallel bar routine,
to end the meet.
University of Moscow team
members Artemij Kruchkov and
Sergei Korchinskij propelled the
Russian team with high scores in
all six events.
"They were definitely not
used to our scoring system, and
while it might have been pretty
hard for them, overall they had a
very consistent meet," said
senior Shawn Adamek of the
Russian team.
"They obviously had very
good training as kids, judging by
their basic skills and excellent
technique," commented Hama
da. "What I am most impressed
by is their genuine enjoyment of
the sport, which, in the U.S., we
sometimes forget. I hope I can
get my guys to have as much fun
at gymnastics as they do."
The Russian team traveled to
the U.S. exactly for that reason.
Team member Andrej Asainov
described the personal fulfill
ment of the sport as the most
important part of gymnastics.
"We just compete to have

fun," he said. "The result is not
really all that important."
Not only did the Russian team
enjoy competing at Stanford, but
the opportunity to host a Rus
sian team was a new experience
for the Cardinal gymnasts.
"We're really glad they had
the opportunity to visit Stan
ford. We had a great time com
peting against them. Not only
are they impressive in the gym,
they are also a great bunch of
guys," said junior Jason
Cohen.
As the Stanford team looks
toward its next meet, to be held
next Friday at California, the
gymnasts will be attempting to
improve the difficulty of their
skills as well as polish their new
routines.
"This meet was a good chance
for us to throw some of our new
tricks in a competition situation
and get some good practice in for
our regular season," said Ben
der.
In an attempt to promote the
sport of gymnastics at Stanford,
both the Russian team and the
Cardinal had the opportunity to
demonstrate their skills in a
friendly atmosphere. The Stan
ford men prepare for their first
regular season match up at the
end of the week — beginning
their quest to remain the NCAA
champions.
