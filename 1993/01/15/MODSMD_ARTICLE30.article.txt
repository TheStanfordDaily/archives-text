# Grapplers host two opponents
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
In "professional" wrestling, injuries come in
the form of false blood, mock casts and limps that
suddenly switch from one leg to another.
Unfortunately, Stanford grapplers are not
actors, and will have to compete despite bumps
and bruises against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and
Southern Oregon this weekend at home.
Already forfeiting at the 177-pound and heavy
weight divisions, the Cardinal line-up also
includes three wrestlers who will wrestle without
having fully recovered from injuries suffered in
past weeks. Lance Johnson, a 142-pound junior, is
saddled with a rib injury, while 150-pound red
shirt freshman Tod Surmon and 167-pound true
freshman C.E. Smith still nurse sprained ankles.
Stanford head coach Chris Horpel estimated the
latter two at 70 percent strength.
Without a complete and healthy line-up, Horpel
admitted that it will be difficult for the Cardinal to
win the dual meets. Indeed, the Mustangs are
ranked in the top 25, while Southern Oregon
stands at the No. 4 spot in NAIA polls and features
two top-ranked wrestlers at 150 and 190 pounds.
Even so, Horpel believes his team has a genuine
chance of victory. "When adrenaline flows," he
said, "They (the Cardinal) won't be concerned
with their injuries, and will compete much better
than in practice."
While Southern Oregon's strength resides in
the heavier weight classes, where Stanford either
has to forfeit or feature young talent, the match
ups against Cal Poly-SLO are more promising,
according to Horpel.
"I just hope we're a little tougher where we
match up," he said.
In any case, both meets will provide valuable
preparation and experience for the Pacific-10
Championships in late February and early
March, while the Cal-Poly-SLO conference clash
will also influence individual seedings in the
tournament.
The duel with the Mustangs will take place at
7:30 p.m. Friday. Southern Oregon will compete
on Saturday at the same time. Both bouts will be
held at Burnham Pavilion in Ford Center.
