The reigning national champi
ons of men's collegiate tennis will
make their Pacific 10 Conference
debut this afternoon in Seattle.
With a preseason No. 2 ranking,
the Cardinal should be a
formidable threat to all its oppo
nents at this weekend's Pac-10
Individual Indoor Championships.
Throughout preseason compe
tition the Stanford men have con
sistently raised their level of play,
peaking last weekend when
Robert Devens reached the finals
and Chris Cocotos reached the
semifinals of the National Colle
giate Tennis Classic.
Although Devens is unranked in
the preseason singles polls, he holds
the No. 5 ranking in doubles with
partner Michael Flanagan (No. 10
in singles). Another Cardinal pair,
Cocotos and Vimal Patel, are next
in line with a No. 6 national rank
ing. Cocotos won the national dou
bles title last spring with Stanford
graduate Alex O'Brien.
When today's tournament
begins, Flanagan and Devens will
lead the team in Flight 1, com
prised of the participating teams'
top two players. Cocotos and Patel
will compete in Flight 2 while
team captain, and lone senior,
Roman Sydorak will play in the
third flight with freshman Jeff
Salzenstein. Freshmen Ricky
Becker and Jim Thomas round
out the Cardinal's starting lineup
in the fourth flight.
Although the 1992-93 squad
has no established superstar,
head coach Dick Gould is confi
dent the team will "have a chance
at each spot, but there will be no

guaranteed spots. . . . Every
match will be a dogfight."
Luckily, fighting to the finish is
the team's forte. The spirit and
dedication that led them to a
national title last year very could
well propel them to a second cham
pionship. "Above all other teams
I've coached, these guys want to
win as a team," Gould said.
"They have tremendous pride
and confidence but they're not the
kind of guys to sit on it. They are
versatile. . .and they're hungry.
This team has a chance to win
(the national championship) if
things break right â€” I couldn't
say that last year at this time."
Cardinal Notes
Earlier this week, Fox &
Carskadon, a Bay Area real estate
firm, agreed to underwrite the balance
of both the men's and women's tennis
teams' operating costs. The arrange
ment, via the Athletic Department,
does not increase the team budgets but
it makes the tennis programs virtually
self-sufficient; they are no longer a lia
bility to the Athletic Department.
Men's head coach Dick Gould
believes that this is the first agreement
of its kind in collegiate snorts.
This season, the men's tennis team
will implement a new match format.
Matches will begin with doubles,
which will be played as eight-game pro
sets rather than as the traditional two
out-of-three, six-game sets. Gould esti
mates average match length will be
around three hours rather than five.
In addition, the three doubles
matches will count for a total of one
team point. So, if a team loses in dou
bles they will need to win four of the
six singles matches to secure a team
victory. The singles will still be played
in the traditional format but after the
doubles matches.
