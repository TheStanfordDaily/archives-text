# Strong Cardinal squad heads to UCSB tourney
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Take two first team All-Ameri
cans. Add three more returning
starters from a squad that was a
game away from the National
Championship last year. Toss in
the best freshman class in the
country. You've just concocted
the Stanford's men's volleyball
team, ranked third in the nation
in Volleyball Monthly's preseason
poll.
Look at the ingredients more
carefully. Senior Dave Goss's
name springs off the roster. Goss,
a first team Ail-American, has the
opposite-hitter position firmly in
grasp. Last year he hit an NCAA -
record 55 kills in a game versus
UCLA, while leading the nation
with a 7.47 kills-per-game average.
"Dave Goss, I think, is one of
the three top hitters in the U. 5.,"
said head coach Ruben Nieves.
Canyon Ceman, the other
Cardinal returning All-Ameri
can, is Stanford's career assist
leader after only two years. He
maintained a .44 service-ace
average, which was good for fifth
in the nation, en route to win
ning the Stanford Block "S"
Award for outstanding male ath
lete of the sophomore class last
year. However, he does not have
the starting setter position
nailed down. Powerful competi
tion is being applied by senior
Jimmy Blackman.
"People assume Canyon's
going to be our starter because
he's a returning first team Ail-
American," said Nieves. "Jimmy
is giving him a run for his
money."
The middle blocker positions
are also hotly contested. Senior
John Bezmalinovic and junior Joe
Burghardt anchored the middle
last season, where Burghardt led
the nation with a .505 hitting per
centage, with Bezmalinovic
fourth at .478.
Senior John Hribar and sopho
more Brian Garrett are compet
ing for the middle spots as well,
adding to the squad's depth.
"Again, from the outside it
looks simple," said Nieves. "But
a coach bases his opinion on
who's playing the best right now.
And we've got a good fight in the
middle now between those four
players."

The one position experiencing
a lack of depth, according to
Nieves, is the swing-hitter posi
tion, after the graduation of Ail-
American Duncan Blackman.
Scrambling to replace Blackman
are Ryan Moos, another return
ing starter, Bob Hillman, Eric
Wells and David Fischer.
Wells and Fischer, who will
probably back up Moos and Hill
man, both are short on experi
ence. Fischer lacks playing time
at the swing-hitter position and
needs to improve on his passing
ability while Wells has the skills
but is yet unproven at the col
lege level, according to Nieves.
The Cardinal has four mem
bers of what Volleyball Monthly
calls the best freshman class in
the nation. Only one, though,
will be seeing any action. Mike
Lambert will be backing up
Goss at the opposite-hitter posi
tion.
"I think that, if not the top,
he's one of the best freshmen in
the country," said Nieves.
"Because he's playing a position
where he backs up a first team
All-American, I don't know how
much he's going to play. But
believe me, he can play."
In any other sport a recipe
such as this would be enough to
at least secure a division crown.
But not in men's volleyball, and
definitely not in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation, a
league which is arguably the best
in the history of collegiate volley
ball.
The Cardinal plays in the
Pacific division of the MPSF,
along with such juggernauts as
No. 5 USC and No. 6 Cal State-
Long Beach State. In particular,
Cal State-Long Beach returns
one of the most exciting collegiate
players in the country, Brent
Hilliard. Hilliard was the only
collegiate player to participate on
the Olympic Team in Barcelona
last summer.
And conquering this division
does not even assure Stanford's
spikers of a trip to the NCAA
tournament. They then must
beat the top team from the
Mountain division of the MPSF,
which may even be tougher than
the Pacific division with teams
such as No. 1 UCLA, No. 2 Pep
perdine (last year's national
champion) and No. 9 UC-Santa

Barbara. Only then can the Car
dinal count on a trip to Los Ange
les for the National Champi
onships on May 7-8.
But a trip to Los Angeles is
far from the minds of this amal
gam of premier volleyball play
ers as they head to UC-Santa

Barbara to play in the UCSB
Invitational this weekend. This
strong tournament features five
of the top 10 teams in the
nation, including UCLA and
Pepperdine, as well as some of
the top club teams and the top
squads from Canada.
