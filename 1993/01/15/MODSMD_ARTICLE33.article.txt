# Women's gymnastics hosts Oregon State
## 
### Sean May Staff Writer 
The No. 12 Stanford Cardinal women's
gymnastics team heads into the 1993 cam
paign with a top ranking and the confidence
that it can rise even higher.
Six women return from last year's 10th
ranked squad, which was the first in Cardi
nal history to be invited to the NCAA nation
al meet, but Coach Breck Greenwood thinks
this team has what it takes to best last year's
unprecedented finish.
"Our goal this year is to finish in the top
six," Greenwood said.
But first the Cardinal must get past the
No. 4 Oregon State Beavers, who it hosts
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
"They've been the best in our region for

the last three years," Greenwood said, "but
they've been especially good lately."
The Beavers are led by junior All-Ameri
can Chari Knight, last year's Pacific 10 Con
ference Gymnast of the Year.
"She is pretty much flawless," Greenwood
said of who racked up eight of the top nine
All-Around scores in the Pac-10 last year.
Knight is hardly the only star Beaver
coach Jim Turpin will bring to Maples this
weekend. Senior Amy Durham and junior
Traci Crover also earned second team All-
America recognition last year.
The Beavers will be met this weekend by a
Cardinal team that features its own Ail-
American in sophomore Jene Elzie.
Coach Greenwood is also expecting big
things this year from junior co-captain Mol
lie Brown, sophomore Tina Snowden and

freshman Hillary Anderson, who won a gold
medal in the team competition and a silver
medal on the bars in the 1991 Pan-American
Games.
Saturday will be "Shannon Miller Night,"
as the Olympic silver medal-winning gym
nast will be signing autographs and perform
ing her floor routine at the meet.
"Having Shannon Miller here is a big
deal," Greenwood said. "Many of our athletes
know her and have competed against her."
Stanford opened the season last week
with a 191.75 - 186.3 loss at Cal State-
Fullerton, a meet both Elzie and junior Lau
rie West missed due to injury. However,
their return for the conference season
doesn't mean things will get easier for the
Cardinal. Every Pac-10 school is currently
ranked in the national Top 20.
