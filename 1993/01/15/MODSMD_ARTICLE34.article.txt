# Stanford opens year with Arizona meets
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
After an intense winter train
ing session, the Stanford women
swimmers are ready to dive into
the regular season with a roadtrip
to Arizona and Arizona State this
weekend.
First stop, the top-ranked and
defending NCAA champion Car
dinal will battle No. 4 Arizona
today. Boasting a line-up of three
Olympians, 12 NCAA finalists
and a strong incoming freshman
class, Stanford already has
defeated the Wildcats once this
season, in last month's Texas
Invitational.
"Although Arizona is a very
good, strong, balanced team, I
don't think they have quite the
marquee athletes we do," said
head coach Richard Quick. "And
in their most apparent strength,
which is sprinting, we have Jenny
Thompson to answer them."
Nevertheless, Wildcat sprinter
Amy Van Dyken, who upset
Thompson at the Texas Invita
tional, poses a serious threat in
the 50-meter freestyle, 100 free
and 100 butterfly events.
Freshman teammate Becky
Gumpert is also likely to place
high in the breaststroke and indi
vidual medley races. The rookie
swimmer will face some stiff com
petition against Stanford's for
mer NCAA champion, Lori
Heisick, in the 100 and 200
breaststroke. In the 200 IM, the
Cardinal placed seven swimmers
in the 1992 NCAA Champi
onships, and maintains the
strongest 1-2-3 combination in
the nation.
"Arizona will be very well rest
ed and ready to face us," said
senior backstroke specialist Lea
Loveless. "We're just looking to
swim fast in order to get an idea
as to how far along we are train
ing-wise."

On Saturday, the Cardinal will
travel to Tempe to take on Ari
zona State, another traditionally
strong team.
Brazilian native Ana Azevedo,
will lead a strong lineup of back
strokers for the Sun Devils. Last
year she was ASU's top performer
in the 100 and 200 backstroke.
On an international scale she has
set or broken the Brazilian
national record in six events,
including the ones she will swim
this weekend.

However, the backstroke
events are also among the
strongest for Stanford this year
as well. Olympian Loveless leads
the way for the Cardinal, followed
by Mary Edwards and co-captain
Anne Mahoney.
Adding to the strength of the
Cardinal swimmers at both
meets will be divers Eileen
Richetelli and Molly Wood.
Richetelli, the NCAA champion
in the 3-meter and platform div
ing events is only 60-70 percent
recovered from the third-degree
ligament sprains she suffered in
both her ankles.
"If she was 100 percent right
now, no one could come close to
her level," said diving coach Rick
Schavone. "Even though she isn't
fully recovered yet, she should
come out on top this weekend if
she dives solidly."
