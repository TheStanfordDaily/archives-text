# Survey reveals increased activism
## 
### Scott Van Winkle 
A nationwide survey of college fresh
men released this week revealed that
this year's incoming students have been
more involved in the community and in
political protests than any previous class
— including those in the turbulent
1960s
The wide-ranging survey, conducted
by the UCLA Higher Education Re
search Institute, included more than
200,000 students from colleges around

the country.
It found that more than 40 percent of
freshmen had participated in an orga
nized demonstration in their senior year
of high school — almost double the fig
ures for the late 19605. In addition, al
most two-thirds said they had performed
volunteer work. Both figures are the
highest since the survey began in 1966,
according to the Institute's report.
Of the almost 1500 Stanford students
responding to the survey, 24 percent said
they were involved in protests, while

more than 89 percent had done some
community service.
One reason cited for the surprisingly
high percentage of students involved in
protests was the widespread reaction to
the Rodney King verdict last spring.
UCLA Graduate School of Education
Prof. Eric Dey, who helped direct the
survey, said, "By and large, students
have responded ito the King verdict] by
recommiting themselves to promoting
racial equality."
But although many Stanford
freshmen said they would be will
ing to volunteer while in college
— 49 percent of respondents said
they planned to volunteer —
many appear not to have followed
up on their plans thus far.
Anne Takemoto, director of the
Ravenswood Stanford Tutoring
Program, described this year's
freshman involvement in her pro

gram as "the lowest we've ever
had." Normally, she said,
Ravenswood has about 120
tutors, 50 to 60 percent of whom
are freshmen.
This year, however, the pro
gram has only 84 tutors, and
freshmen constitute a smaller
percentage than in past years,
Takemoto explained.
The problem is not just con
fined to the Ravenswood pro
gram, she added. "Recruiting has
been really difficult for a lot of
programs" this year, especially
Barrio Assistance, she said.
Socially, however, Stanford

freshmen lag behind the nation
and appear generally less active
than their peers at other schools.
Only 37 percent "frequently" or
"occasionally" drank beer last
year, while 54 percent of stu
dents polled nationwide reported
the same amount of consump
tion.
When asked how many hours
per week they spent partying, 28
percent of Stanford freshmen
responded "none," while only 15
percent of freshmen attending
private colleges nationwide
reported the same level of activi
ty.

The survey also revealed that
Stanford freshmen were more
likely to consider themselves lib
eral than were freshmen at other
schools. Forty-three percent
labeled themselves "liberal" or
"far left," compared to 33 percent
among all private colleges and 27
percent nationwide.
On the other hand, Stanford
freshmen appeared less support
ive of politically correct initia
tives, with only 43 percent agree
ing with the statement "colleges
should prohibit racist/sexist
speech on campus," compared to
53 percent at private schools and

61 percent nationwide.
Compared with students at
other highly selective private
institutions, Stanford freshmen
were more likely to be attending
their first-choice school, less like
ly to have decided on a major,
and more likely to have had
above a "B+" average in high
school.
Ethnically, Stanford freshmen
are generally more diverse than at
other top schools, with higher
than average percentages of
Asian-American, African-Ameri
can, Chicano/Latino and Native
American students.
