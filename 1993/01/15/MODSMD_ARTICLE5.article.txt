With passion in her voice, African and
Afro-American Studies Prof. Sylvia Wyn
ter challenged a Stanford audience last
night to carry on Martin Luther King,
Jr.'s legacy and "reform knowledge" by
tackling the problems of racial inequality.
"My point is to try to understand what
kind of disillusion could have kept decent
men and women gripped in this belief
system" of racial discrimination, she said
in a keynote address given as part of the
University's commemoration of King's
birthday.
Above all, Wynter questioned what
role the nation's educational system
played in sustaining the practice of racial
inequality. She cited a definite link be
tween education and the knowledge it
disseminates.
"Our role in the university today is to

spearhead the writing. . . and the rewrit
ing" of knowledge, she said.
Wynter emphasized that King was
faced with the tough choice of starting
the civil rights revolution or waiting to
see what changes, if any, the upcoming
local Alabama elections would make.
"King challenged the basic premise of
contemporary liberal thought, the
premise that underlies the liberal con
ception of justice which is the dominat
ing concept in which we orient our be
haviors," she said.
"It seems at this moment King was
faced with jail, something I call the risky,
full-loaf transform option, or the half
loaf reform action."
King took the "full-loaf option, but,
Wynter argued, "the universities and
Black Studies programs have settled for
the half-loaf reform option. We have not
seen our mission."

This observation elicited nods and
murmurs from the crowd.
"I have a lifelong quest for another
kind of freedom, freedom of the human
. . . from (the) mental slavery that en
ables violence and injustice to seem to us
all unceasing," Wynter said.
Junior Kwame Anku said he came "to
see and hear how |Wynter) starts to ex
plain how we came to our present situa
tion in regards to race and social prob
lems."
"Sylvia Wynter is a brilliant speaker
and thinker," said graduate student
Carla Fiani. "She has a really different
way of looking at our society."
Concluding her address with an ex
cerpt from King's celebrated "I Have A
Dream" speech, Wynter asked the audi
ence to "finish it for me." The crowd
joined in unison, "Free at last, free at
last, thank God almighty, free at last."
