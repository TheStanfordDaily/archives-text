# King papers provide insight for students

What was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
doing at 1:52 p.m. on March 10, 1964?
Only a few students might know the
answer to this question or understand
where to look for it. And chances are that
they work for the Martin Luther King, Jr.
Papers Project, cataloging documents de
tailing the life of the slain civil rights
leader and researching their significance.
"The work is interesting because King
is a great figure in American history who
most people don't know much about ex
cept for the 'I Have a Dream' speech and
the Montgomery bus boycott," said Matt

Scelza, a junior majoring in American
Studies who works on the project.
"I have an appreciation of King that
99 percent of the country can't under
stand because of my work at the pro
gram," he said.
About a dozen students work as re
search helpers for the project, either for
directed research credit or in a volunteer
capacity. Most of the students enter let
ters and other documents related to
King's life into a computer system called
Prism, helping to develop a chronology of
his actions.
