# King papers provide insight for students

What was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
doing at 1:52 p.m. on March 10, 1964?
Only a few students might know the
answer to this question or understand
where to look for it. And chances are that
they work for the Martin Luther King, Jr.
Papers Project, cataloging documents de
tailing the life of the slain civil rights
leader and researching their significance.
"The work is interesting because King
is a great figure in American history who
most people don't know much about ex
cept for the 'I Have a Dream' speech and
the Montgomery bus boycott," said Matt

Scelza, a junior majoring in American
Studies who works on the project.
"I have an appreciation of King that
99 percent of the country can't under
stand because of my work at the pro
gram," he said.
About a dozen students work as re
search helpers for the project, either for
directed research credit or in a volunteer
capacity. Most of the students enter let
ters and other documents related to
King's life into a computer system called
Prism, helping to develop a chronology of
his actions.
Fifth-year senior Tom Williams said
that working with Prism may be
the most exciting part of the pro
ject. "The most important thing is
the help you can give inputting
the information in the computers.
It makes research easier for
everyone across the country," he
said.
Freshman Julie Lanoff said
her work at the papers has given
her a special appreciation of his

torical figures.
"I took a course last quarter
about race and ethnicity and read
about all these leaders from a his
torical perspective," she said.
"Then I go to work and read a let
ter from that historical figure.
What [I was] seeing was actually
from the hand of a great man."
Some students have even based
their senior honors theses on the
King papers. Williams said he
chose to work with project direc
tor Clay Carson and base his his
tory honors thesis on a part of the
project because "it's such an

important source of information
about one of the most important
African-American leaders."
Williams' thesis concerns
King's travels to India in 1959
and how the trip affected his phi
losophy of non-violent resistance.
Many get involved in the pro
ject as a means of educating them
selves. Scelza said he decided to
research because he realized he
was making too many assump
tions about historical figures like
King.
"I said something about how
King was the nice guy and Mai

colm X was mean," he said,
adding that his research has
shown him that both civil rights
leaders are more complcx than he
originally thought. "The more I
learn about it, the more I get
intrigued by the black freedom
struggle."
Some King project research
helpers have ambitions to teach
others the knowledge they've
gained about the civil rights
movement. Williams said he may
use the experience in a future
teaching career; Scelza has
already put the information to

work, teaching a seminar for high
school students last summer.
The main reasons students
keep working on the project are
entertainment and interest. "It's
not just a bunch of weird people at
the project," Scelza said. "It's a
fun place to work."
But he pointed out that the
King papers can also have their
boring moments. "It's research.
You get some really interesting
documents and then you get 10 in
a row that are invitation rejec
tions. 'I'm sorry but King can't
appear on this date ....'"
