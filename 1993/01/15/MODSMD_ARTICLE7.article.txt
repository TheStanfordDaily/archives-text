# A 						carefully mapped road
## Singaporean program puts students on career track 
### Amanda Beacom 
During his four years at Stan
ford, freshman Wee Ping Lim won't
pay a single visit to the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center.
He doesn't need to.
Like most of the 71 students
from Singapore, Lim can map out
his future, down to the very busi
ness that will employ him, without
the help of career counselors or
aptitude tests.
Every month he receives a com
prehensive scholarship check from
a Singaporean company called the
Port of Singapore Authority. In ex
change, Lim must return home
upon graduation and spend eight
years working for the company as
an electrical engineer, fulfilling a
contract he signed with them.
"I won't say I regret it (signing
the contract)," said Lim. "But I
may think differently in 1996."
Almost 100 such overseas
scholarships are offered each year
by the Singaporean government
and semi-private businesses. In a
process that varies slightly from
company to company, students
apply for academic scholarships to
universities in the United States,
Great Britain, Australia or Japan.
Among American schools, Sin

gaporean students usually contact
the Ivy Leagues, Berkeley, and
Stanford, institutions which com
panies look upon favorably.
Lim chose Stanford because of
its flexible curriculum, while both
graduate student Patrick Teo and
freshman Shiang Lim said they
were attracted to the Farm in part
by California's warm weather,
similar to Singapore's climate.
"It would be hard to get used to
Harvard," said Shiang Lim with a
smile.
Once awarded a scholarship, a
student decides upon a particular
field of study that meets the com
pany's needs and satisfies his or
her own interests. Because Singa
pore is a newly industrialized
country, the overwhelming major
ity of students major in electrical
engineering, computer science or
economics, fields that are pre-pro
fessional in nature.
However, a small number of Sin
gaporeans do focus on more "fuzzy"
fields, like senior Mun Wei Chan.
Originally an economics mtyor
at the University of Chicago, Chan
declared an anthropology
after transferring to Stanford.

lines, approved of the change,
Chan is uncertain of a similar
response to his wish to obtain a
master's in education.
"It's a trade-off," said Chan of
the scholarship system. "You gain
financial aid, but you also lose the
freedom to choose."
While the companies do not
monitor course selection or grades
closely, Teo feels that "ultimately,
we have to do what they tell us."
Both Teo and Wee Ping Lim
observe that when students apply
for the scholarships at age 18 or
19, few realize the opportunities
they sign away with the bond.
"A lot of people don't think
about working for the company at
the time, but instead focus on the
money they will receive," said Lim.
Because his career path is
already chosen, Lim said he feels
he might be missing out on what
he calls a "true education" — one
that involves exploring a variety

of subjects and then basing a
career choice on that exploration.
Teo also points to a simple eco
nomic loss in the fact that he must
return to Singapore to work. "As a
person approaching the job mar
ket, we'd have more buying power
in the United States," he said.
Even when adjusted for the
cost of living, Teo feels the start
ing salary for a computer scientist
is greater in the United States
than in Singapore.
Although many students often
feel restricted by the conditions of
the scholarship, few possess the
resources to break free. Sin g a -
poreans who decide not to return
home and work for their sponsor
must pay the total cost of their
education as well as 10 percent
compounded interest and a 10
percent inflation and damages
fee. Often the total amount reach
es almost 250,000 Singapore dol
lars ($150,000).
"If given the choice, everyone
would rather go without the
bond, said Shiang Lim. "The
thing is, there's no such thing as a
free lunch."
