## Singaporean program puts students on career track

During his four years at Stan
ford, freshman Wee Ping Lim won't
pay a single visit to the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center.
He doesn't need to.
Like most of the 71 students
from Singapore, Lim can map out
his future, down to the very busi
ness that will employ him, without
the help of career counselors or
aptitude tests.
Every month he receives a com
prehensive scholarship check from
a Singaporean company called the
Port of Singapore Authority. In ex
change, Lim must return home
upon graduation and spend eight
years working for the company as
an electrical engineer, fulfilling a
contract he signed with them.
"I won't say I regret it (signing
the contract)," said Lim. "But I
may think differently in 1996."
Almost 100 such overseas
scholarships are offered each year
by the Singaporean government
and semi-private businesses. In a
process that varies slightly from
company to company, students
apply for academic scholarships to
universities in the United States,
Great Britain, Australia or Japan.
Among American schools, Sin

gaporean students usually contact
the Ivy Leagues, Berkeley, and
Stanford, institutions which com
panies look upon favorably.
Lim chose Stanford because of
its flexible curriculum, while both
graduate student Patrick Teo and
freshman Shiang Lim said they
were attracted to the Farm in part
by California's warm weather,
similar to Singapore's climate.
"It would be hard to get used to
Harvard," said Shiang Lim with a
smile.
Once awarded a scholarship, a
student decides upon a particular
field of study that meets the com
pany's needs and satisfies his or
her own interests. Because Singa
pore is a newly industrialized
country, the overwhelming major
ity of students major in electrical
engineering, computer science or
economics, fields that are pre-pro
fessional in nature.
However, a small number of Sin
gaporeans do focus on more "fuzzy"
fields, like senior Mun Wei Chan.
Originally an economics mtyor
at the University of Chicago, Chan
declared an anthropology
after transferring to Stanford.
