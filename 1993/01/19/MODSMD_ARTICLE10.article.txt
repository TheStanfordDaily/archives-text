# Jetsetting reporter arrives in D.C.

WASHINGTON"The —"The devil gave his powers
to Nero Caesar, who was reborn as Ronald Wilson
Reagan!"
Thus spoke Joshua Israel, also known as Jesus
Cruz, to masses of unhearing, hurrying, boister
ous tourists, packed Tokyo-style into speeding
Metro trains hurtling below the streets of Wash
ington, D.C.
Interested in this peculiar piece of political
punditry, I asked, "If the Republicans were in
cahoots with the devil, did the Democrats and
Clinton have God on their side?"
"Unfortunately, no," said Cruz. "[Clinton's] not
that Great White Hope, though I wish he was."
If Cruz is right that Clinton is not the political
messiah, it's a good thing that no one has told the
throngs of Clinton enthusiasts who descended on
D.C. with money in their pockets and jubilation
on their agendas.
But first, some background: My plane arrived
in Houston on the first leg of the flight to Wash
ington, D.C. just in time for a fiery red sunset.
The irony of the situation struck me: I was going
to Washington by way of Houston, George Bush's
home away from Kennebunkport, Maine.
Houston Intercontinental Airport is like any
other airport except the urinals are dirtier and the
in-house chapel is open 24 hours a day.
The flight to Washington was filled with Clin
ton groupies trading tips on which Inaugural
Balls were sold out (all of them) and how to get
tickets (sell yourself into indentured servitude).
Upon our arrival, I discovered that the Nation
al Airport in Washington is like any other airport

except the loudspeaker announcer tells you to
grasp your belongings firmly to your body.
I left the airport and headed for the metro, lug
ging my suitcase, The Daily's portable word pro
cessor, a backpack containing several weeks
worth of textbooks to salve my guilty conscience,
and a hanging bag with my faux-tuxedo (just in
case I could get into an Inaugural Ball on the
strength of my Daily press pass).
D.C.'s Metro is a lot like BART except it actu
ally goes where you want to go and is easy to use.
I emerged from the Woodley Park-Zoo Metro
station onto the cold streets of our nation's Capi
tal, clutching my belongings firmly to my body.
After a few moments of silent reverie, I remem
bered my luggage.
I found the Stanford in Washington building
and buzzed at the broken intercom at the front
door. "I can't hear you, but I'm gonna let you in,"
said the voice over the intercom. "Just don't kill
any of us or steal anything."
Easy enough, I figured. I went into the student
lounge, where a crowd of Stanford In Washing
ton-ites were watching Saturday Night Live.
"Hi. I'm from The Daily. I'll be staying here for
q wook "
"Really?" asked junior Mike Brylawski. "I'll
give you a malt liquor if you quote me."
I knew I was home.

Staff writer Jake Dorman worked on the Clinton-
Gore campaign this summer. He will be reporting
from Washington this week, if he hasn't had too
much malt liquor.
