U.S. troops leave Somalia
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Hun
dreds of American combat troops were
packing for home yesterday as Washing
ton prepared to transfer military control
of Somalia to U.N. command as early as
Feb. 1, a U.S. spokesman said.
The United States appears to be try
ing to prod the United Nations into mov
ing faster by announcing it is ready to
make the transfer. The first contingent
of about 850 soldiers is scheduled to
leave today for Camp Pendleton, Calif.
But at U.N. headquarters in New York
yesterday, the top U.N. envoy to Somalia,
Ismat Kittani of Iraq, cast doubt on the
feasibility of a transfer in only two weeks.
"You can't say that a 'secure environ
ment' for the delivery of assistance has
been achieved" in Somalia, a precondition

for the transfer of authority, Kittani said.
Seven die in train crash
GARY, Ind. (AP) — One commuter
train sideswiped another at a narrow trestle
yesterday, killing seven people, an official

The eastbound and westbound trains
collided shortly after 9:30 a.m., said
John Parsons, spokesman for Northern
Indiana Commuter Transit District,
which owns the Chicago-to-South Bend
rail line. The cause of the crash was
under investigation by the National
Transportation Safety Board.
"The walls were ripped open, creating
an effect like a big razor blade," Gary
Fire Chief Ben Perry said.
Several of the dead were decapitated,
he said.
