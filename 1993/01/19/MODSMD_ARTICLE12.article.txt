BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Iraq reported
21 deaths from allied air raids in southern
and northern Iraq yesterday, including
two deaths caused by Sunday's cruise mis
sile attack on the al-Rashid hotel.
Air raid sirens sounded briefly after
sunset in Baghdad last night and some
anti-aircraft guns fired sporadically, but
the shooting was not as intense as dur
ing the cruise missile attack Sunday.
The official Iraqi News Agency gave
few details on yesterday's round of
attacks — the third on Iraq in six days
and the first daylight raids.
It quoted a military spokesman as
saying there were nine incidents of
allied aircraft striking military positions
in Dhi Qar province, the city of Nas
sariya in southern Iraq and south of
Mosul in the north.
The agency said two raids south of
Mosul were driven off by Iraqi defenses,

but made no claims of allied aircraft
being hit. U.S. officials said all allied
planes returned safely from attacks on
air defense sites.
Also yesterday, a senior U.S. military
official, speaking in Washington on con
dition of anonymity, said the Pentagon
has concluded the Tomahawk cruise
missile fired in Sunday's attack had gone
off course because of Iraqi anti-aircraft
artillery and struck the al-Rashid hotel.
"We regret the loss of life," the Pen
tagon official said.
The hotel is home to many visiting
journalists, several of whom were
injured by the blast, and was the site for
the sixth World Popular Islamic Confer
ence, an Iraqi-organized group of aca
demics and low-level religious officials
from Muslim nations.
U.S. Navy warships fired the more
than 30 Tomahawk cruise missiles Sun-

day at a complex of factories in the Bagh
dad suburb of Zaafaraniyeh.
The White House and the U.N.
Atomic Energy Agency said the plant
had been used to produce electromag
netic parts for enriching uranium so it
could be used in nuclear weapons. Iraq's
Information Ministry denied the plant
had anything to do with nuclear work.
The attacks drew reaction from for
eign governments yesterday, straining
the international coalition that supported
the war to drive Iraqi troops from Kuwait
two years ago. Arab nations criticized the
attacks on Iraq, but they stopped short of
backing Saddam Hussein.
The Cairo-based Arab League said it
"regrets the policy of military escalation
against Iraq."
But the 21-nation group also called
on Baghdad to respect Kuwait's
sovereignty.
