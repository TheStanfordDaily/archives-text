Elaborate inauguration
signals a change from
'average guy' Clinton

AT LONG LAST, tomorrow
brings deliverance from the
months of speculation and
second-guessing. Mr. Governor
will finally ascend to the title of
Mr. President.
Bill Clinton, the endless cam
paigner and champion of Mr. Aver
age, must finally demonstrate
whether his endless promises of a
slimmer, trimmer, reinvigorated
America are worth their weight in
television ads and newspaper
interviews.
If this weekend's inauguration
is indicative of his future budget
proposals, however, this country
has been woefully deceived. Esti
mates for the total bill for Bill and
Al's inaugural extravaganza hover
at over $25 million. So much for
Mr. Average and his fiscal
restraint.
The inauguration's intended
goal had been for the new Presi
dent to appear an approachable,
down-to-earth guy who cares for
the people of this country. Plan
ners apparently hope to cement
Clinton's popular support by cre
ating an image of jubilation and
rebirth throughout the nation.
After 12 years of Republican
domination, the Democrats are
determined to show their elation
at snatching back the executive
branch. And so they are deter
mined to throw the party of the
decade.
There is something for every
one: balls honoring lesbians and
gays, Caribbean Americans and
Native Americans, a reunited
Fleetwood Mac and an open house
at the White House.
It also includes certain compas
sionate touches, such as the
mandatory can-of-food-for-the
homeless admission requirement
to one event and the White House

luncheon for 50 people Clinton and
Gore met during the campaign.
When Jimmy Carter journeyed
to Washington from his home state
of Georgia back in 1977, he spent a
paltry $3 million on his inaugura
tion. And yet he still touched the
hearts of the nation with his sim
plicity through such gestures as
walking hand-in-hand with his
wife through the streets of the cap
ital, not through star-studded gala
after gala.
On the whole, the Clinton-Gore
inauguration is far too overblown
and out of touch with the average
American in, say, Arkansas. A good
party is not what this country
needs and Clinton, as its new chief
physician, should know better
than prescribing such a placebo.
It appears much more likely
that his first order of business will
be injecting a heavy dose of reality
into the American psyche. Since
the morning after Election Day,
Clinton has scaled back many of
his explicit campaign pledges:
reducing the budget deficit in half
over four years, granting immedi
ate middle-class tax relief, revers
ing the ban on homosexuals in the
military, reducing the White
House staff by 25 percent and
more.
Few political observers believed
Clinton could stand firm on many
of these promises, so his recent
actions come as no surprise. The
political and fiscal realities of
Washington differ greatly from the
campaign idealism of a Greyhound
bus.
Yet the prospect of making real
progress at the national level has
not been greater in years. Clinton
sweeps into power tomorrow with
a strong majority in Congress and
a public eager for new leadership.
America will wake up after the
five-day fiesta with a strong need
for powerful medicine. As a candi
date, Clinton offered the equiva
lent of a second opinion on the
nation's ills; as President, he must
not only diagnose and speculate
about potential cures, but treat
them on a day-to-day basis.
