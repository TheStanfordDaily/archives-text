## Impressions of Zuni 
### 
ZUNI, NEW MEXICO, Jan. 18. This
must be one of the muddier places
on earth. Some 8,000 people shlep
around in it, to and from cinderblock
houses scattered in random arrange
ments below Dowa Yalonne (Corn Moun
tains), a mesa of sacred significance and
red stripes of clay.
There's one pizza place, one restau
rant the size of a dorm room and three
sort-of grocery stores — one which has a
gas station and good banana bread,
another which advertises "broasted"
chicken and a third complete with lap
idary supplies and a fax machine.
A town where you can buy some of
the most beautiful jewelry I've ever
seen, but not envelopes. Free aerobics
to country music every night of the r
week. And large and numerous signs
flanking the pueblo to remind out
siders "No picture taking, No Sketch
ing, No Tape Recording of the Reli
gious Activities."
These are the physical features of
Zuni I've noticed in my first two weeks
here; I've also realized that a more com
prehensive view of the life and people
here is not simply described.
The high school kids write their
assignments in English, play a lot of bas
ketball and whisper in Zuni. The family
I live with hangs Christmas decorations
alongside a painting of the summer rain
dancers alongside the souvenir teatowel

that one son had sent home from a mili
tary training expedition. The reserva
tion is supposedly "dry," but there are
more beer cans than coke cans on the
side of the road.
What do I make of this jumble of the
familiar and the completely different?
The contradictions seem strange, yet at
the same time perfectly acceptable,
mostly because I had no idea what to
expect when I arrived.
When a culture is presented in books
and television shows it's usually a dead
and dissected version we see — its parts
categorized, analyzed and generalized
about. Now that I'm having the experi
ence of living in a different cultural
first-hand, though, I realize
\hat ijfcerrelatedness of all the
organs is lost"when a community is dis
tilled iqlOv£hapters and slides.
And not only are there ties between
government and religion and kinship to
consider, but connectedness with other
cultures. The Zuni have been surround
ed by the Spanish and Anglos for sever
al centuries, and other Native Ameri
cans for much longer. They have televi
sions and tamales as well as clans and
kiva groups.
But I can't think of Zuni as some
anthropological testing ground; it
became much more than an academic
endeavor the minute I sat down at my
professor's dinner table to eat his wife's

homemade pasta salad on the night I
arrived. For someone who used to have
to save up several day's worth of bravery
to go to office hours, it's much easier to
ask a professor questions after having
seen him shuffling down the hall in his
slippers.
Now that I've moved in with a Zuni
grandmother (and her daughter and
granddaughter), the line between the
academic and all the rest of life becomes
almost impossible to draw. I'm not a
student when I share the family chores
and meals and stories.
Which goings on are material for
"field notes" and which are only for my
personal journal? It's a question of
ethics that I haven't discovered the bal
ance for yet.

Andrea Parkes squeezes in the time to
write her columns between the endless
tupperware demonstrations she per
forms for local tribes and her newfound
love — hunting and gathering. Her last
column will appear here next week, enti

win the NBA crown in 1993, Or How I
Became A Professional Basketball
Junkie."
