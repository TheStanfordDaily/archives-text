Swimsuit models, Playboy centerfolds need reality check

IAM MYSTIFIED that many stu
dents, and even a professor, have
spent their energy debating Peter
Huyck's "poetry" (obviously intended as
a spoof), while Brett Rogers' Jan. 4 col
umn, "Everbody's so beautiful," went
largely unchallenged.
James Lavin's response scratched the
surface of the issue of body image and
self-esteem but missed, I believe, a
major point.
Rogers' reasoning has been used to
justify men's ogling of women since the
swimsuit was invented. Of course, he is
absolutely right: beauty is subjective,
and there's nothing wrong with admir
ing something you consider beautiful
But the frenzy generated by the year
ly appearance of the Sports Illustrated
swimsuit issue, and occasional celebrity
layouts (so to speak) in Playboy maga
zine are not merely about the simple
admiration of the human physique.
There are beautiful men and women

running around everywhere you look,
particularly on this campus. The differ
ence between the people here at Stan
ford and the people in the magazines is
this: reality.
Stanford women have lives. Stanford
women go to classes, do problem sets,
write papers, eat meals and get involved
in sports, student government or intern
ships.
Models, on the other hand, represent
women whose sole purpose is hanging
around looking great. The swimsuit edi
tion models, in particular, are pictured in
fantastic situations and poses, with
equally improbable expressions of steamy
desire on their perfectly made-up faces.
The difference between Stanford
women and models is that Stanford
women don't drape themselves in a field
of daisies, fluff their hair picturesquely
around their heads, and wait — bosoms
heaving — for Joe Schmoe to come along
and have his way with them.

What is being sold here is not beauty,
but a sexual fantasy. Look at the
women: they're perfect, they're silent
and they are there for men's pleasure.
They don't have needs, they don't have
annoying habits or complicated opinions
and they don't require any patience,
dedication or attention. If you get bored,
you can always turn the page.
Everyone loves a fantasy (movies,
soap operas and pop music are testimo
ny to that), but this fantasy has gone too
far. It is so pervasive and profuse that it
is now thought of as the norm.
Most thin women don't have large
breasts, but the miracles of modern cos
metic surgery have forever banished
that ironic twist of biology. Less than 5
percent of women can be healthy at
"model" proportions, yet that is what
every woman has been taught to strive
for.
Sexuality is not a woman's sole
attribute, yet that is the overwhelming

quality focused on by the media. Women
do not exist for the use of men, yet the
mtgority of images we see depict just
that — and how much the woman is
enjoying it.
Rogers is right: The models in Sports
Illustrated are not oppressing women.
Although fantasy is not reality, these
images become reality in many men's
and women's minds — that is where the
real danger lies.
Don't fall for a simplistic analysis
that justifies turning women into sexy
toys for viewing pleasure. And don't
accuse those who protest the objectifica
tion of women of having low self-esteem.
They have a right to feel uneasy and
underappreciated, and they have the
sense to know when a "reasonable"
explanation is really a smoke screen
designed to distract them from the real
issues at hand.
