## Ten-year campaign to renovate residences 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Starting with Wilbur Hall this summer,
the University will kick off a massive 10-
year campaign to completely renovate most
campus residences.
"We want to bring the Sterns and the
Wilburs up with the Kimballs and the Man
zanitas," said Rodger Whitney, the director
of Student Housing Operations.
Pending approval by the Board of
Trustees in February, Housing and Food
Services will refurbish Stanford's aging res
idences — every building except Castano,
Lantana, Kimball and Rains — and build
two new ones. The project, which will cost
about $110 million, will be funded through
state bonds and private loans.
About $28 million will go to the new resi
dences. A building on the Knoll site is tenta
tively scheduled to open in fall 1994, and
Manzanita 111 should be finished in fall 1996.
Food service will also receive attention,
along with computer facilities and disability
access. "We're going to see some real payoff
from this," Whitney said. "It's got every
body excited."
Within five years, he said the goal is for
all residences to have in-room student con
nections, computer clusters and access to
University computer resources like SUNet.
But in a time of University-wide budget
cuts, he also worries that the capital-im
provement plan might be misunderstood.
