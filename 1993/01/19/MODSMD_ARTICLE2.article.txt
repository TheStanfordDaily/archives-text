## Ten-year campaign to renovate residences 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Starting with Wilbur Hall this summer,
the University will kick off a massive 10-
year campaign to completely renovate most
campus residences.
"We want to bring the Sterns and the
Wilburs up with the Kimballs and the Man
zanitas," said Rodger Whitney, the director
of Student Housing Operations.
Pending approval by the Board of
Trustees in February, Housing and Food
Services will refurbish Stanford's aging res
idences — every building except Castano,
Lantana, Kimball and Rains — and build
two new ones. The project, which will cost
about $110 million, will be funded through
state bonds and private loans.
About $28 million will go to the new resi
dences. A building on the Knoll site is tenta
tively scheduled to open in fall 1994, and
Manzanita 111 should be finished in fall 1996.
Food service will also receive attention,
along with computer facilities and disability
access. "We're going to see some real payoff
from this," Whitney said. "It's got every
body excited."
Within five years, he said the goal is for
all residences to have in-room student con
nections, computer clusters and access to
University computer resources like SUNet.
But in a time of University-wide budget
cuts, he also worries that the capital-im
provement plan might be misunderstood.
"The cuts we took in Housing
were designed to let us take this
on," he said.
"This isn't money that we've
got, that we've got all this cash
we're going to spend. . .. We're
not this rich entity while everyone
else is suffering."
Order already set
Wilbur will be the first dormi
tory renovated, followed by one
more each summer. Florence
Moore Hall is next in line, then
Stern Hall, Lagunita Court,
Toyon Hall, Branner Hall,
Crothers and Crothers Memorial
Halls, Roble Hall and finally Gov
ernor's Corner.
At the same time, Escondido
Village and Mirrielees — as well
as three to four Row Houses per
year — will be rejuvenated over
the entire span of the improve
ments plan.
The 1,440 apartments will be
done incrementally — 70 this
summer, then 160 to 170 in each
of the following years, Whitney
said. "Escondido Village will seem
more like a Rains complex when
we get this work done."
On the Row, Whitney said only
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk and 557
Mayfield — the old Beta house —
will be renovated this summer.
The order of improvement for the
Row's other 34 houses should be

determined within the next few
weeks, he added.
The decision will be based on
draw data, each facility's condi
tion and "programmatic impact"
— whether it is a theme house.
"It was 'Who needs it first?' "
said Row Director Diana Conklin,
who was consulted on the order of
renovations. But priorities could
change, she added. "It's not like
we're going to carve anything in
concrete."
Dealing with health and safety
issues like asbestos or lead paint
will also be part of the plan, Whit
ney said. In addition, changes will
be made to improve disability
access, as suggested by a separate
advisory committee.
"As we get to each project,
we're going to try to address the
accessibility issues," he said. "For
example, our goal in Wilbur is to
make one four-class house, one
all-frosh house and the theme
house — Okada — fully accessible
to the first floor."
The two new houses "will be
both vertically and horizontally
accessible — which means eleva
tors."
Rents won't jump
And all this, Whitney said,
won't substantially increase the
student cost of living.
"People won't be burdened by
higher room rates to make this
campaign work," he promised,
adding that there will be the usual
small increases but no huge hikes
in cost.

"Because we're doing it in a
debt service over 30 years, no
one's going to get hit by a big bill.
It would be unfair to make today's
students pay for dorms to be used
for years to come."
The improvements must pass
one more test with the trustees,
Whitney said. "We need to get the
board's final approval for the
specifics of the first-year plan.
The concept for 10 years has
already been approved."
The motivation for the renova
tion plan came from many
sources, said Whitney. First, resi
dences are getting old and "just
look run down."
Students should be able to
choose residences based on
whether the programs and
options fit their needs, he said,
not on the age of the buildings.
Also, "most of our energy has
gone into building new housing
over the last 10 years." Since it is
"very hard to do both a building
and a renovation campaign, . . .
some of our older residences have
slipped into a state where we can't
just let them go."
Deciding the order of renova
tions in a fair and consistent way
was also important to the plan
ners. Since Housing and Food
Service cannot borrow more than
$10 to $11 million each year,
Whitney said, the work had to be
spread out.
'Worst cases first'
Priorities were determined by
ranking the "worst cases first"

and using draw data and informa
tion from a facilities audit done
two years ago, Whitney said. They
are also trying to deal equally
with graduate and undergraduate
housing.
"There's been a lot of concern
from graduate students" that
undergraduate residences get
more attention and resources,
Whitney said.
Glenn Carroll, Stanford's man
ager of apartment facilities, also
mentioned the equity issue. "Sin
gle students in Rains and Escondi
do Village pay the same rates," he
said, even though Rains opened in
1988 and parts of Escondido are
more than 30 years old.
New carpets, stoves, refrigera
tors, counter tops and oak furni
ture will be combined with redone
kitchen floors and brighter paint
to give the apartments a new look,
he said.
The apartments will be spiffed
up over the summer and as stu
dents move out during the year.
"We're trying to work out a way
so students living here could real
ize the benefits" by moving into
the renovated residences, he said.
Especially for families living in
the apartments for up to five or
six years, Carroll said the
improvements are important. The
older units have "just looked a bit
long in the tooth."
Input was a vital part of the
process, Whitney said. "We don't
want to undertake something and
have students say 'Why did you do
that?' "

Still, there were no students on
the advisory committee. "The
(resident fellows) get feedback
from students," Whitney said,
adding that many of the meetings
were during the summer months
when students were gone.
Surveys and model rooms
"We did do a student survey a
year and a half ago about Housing
and Food Service," he said, adding
that he has consulted resident
assistants and Btudent groups.
Model rooms were also set up
beginning last fall in Wilbur and
Escondido for student perusal.
Student input has been solicit-

Ed through the model rooms pro
gram. One example: chairs with
carved seats will be used since
"families didn't want upholstered
dining room chairs because of
children," Carroll said.
"As we move through the vari
ous stages," Conklin said, "the
people in those (Row) houses will
be asked their opinions."
An advisory group has been
meeting for the past year, Whit
ney said. In addition to resident
fellows, it includes representa
tives from Food Service, Residen
tial Education, graduate resi
dences and computer network
ing.

A prototype remodeled Escondido Village apartment.
Starting with Wilbur Hall this summer,
the University will kick off a massive 10-
year campaign to completely renovate most
campus residences.
"We want to bring the Sterns and the
Wilburs up with the Kimballs and the Man
zanitas," said Rodger Whitney, the director
of Student Housing Operations.
Pending approval by the Board of
Trustees in February, Housing and Food
Services will refurbish Stanford's aging res
idences — every building except Castano,
Lantana, Kimball and Rains — and build
two new ones. The project, which will cost
about $110 million, will be funded through
state bonds and private loans.
About $28 million will go to the new resi
dences. A building on the Knoll site is tenta
tively scheduled to open in fall 1994, and
Manzanita 111 should be finished in fall 1996.
Food service will also receive attention,
along with computer facilities and disability
access. "We're going to see some real payoff
from this," Whitney said. "It's got every
body excited."
Within five years, he said the goal is for
all residences to have in-room student con
nections, computer clusters and access to
University computer resources like SUNet.
But in a time of University-wide budget
cuts, he also worries that the capital-im
provement plan might be misunderstood.
"The cuts we took in Housing
were designed to let us take this
on," he said.
"This isn't money that we've
got, that we've got all this cash
we're going to spend. . .. We're
not this rich entity while everyone
else is suffering."
Order already set
Wilbur will be the first dormi
tory renovated, followed by one
more each summer. Florence
Moore Hall is next in line, then
Stern Hall, Lagunita Court,
Toyon Hall, Branner Hall,
Crothers and Crothers Memorial
Halls, Roble Hall and finally Gov
ernor's Corner.
At the same time, Escondido
Village and Mirrielees — as well
as three to four Row Houses per
year — will be rejuvenated over
the entire span of the improve
ments plan.
The 1,440 apartments will be
done incrementally — 70 this
summer, then 160 to 170 in each
of the following years, Whitney
said. "Escondido Village will seem
more like a Rains complex when
we get this work done."
On the Row, Whitney said only
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk and 557
Mayfield — the old Beta house —
will be renovated this summer.
The order of improvement for the
Row's other 34 houses should be

determined within the next few
weeks, he added.
The decision will be based on
draw data, each facility's condi
tion and "programmatic impact"
— whether it is a theme house.
"It was 'Who needs it first?' "
said Row Director Diana Conklin,
who was consulted on the order of
renovations. But priorities could
change, she added. "It's not like
we're going to carve anything in
concrete."
Dealing with health and safety
issues like asbestos or lead paint
will also be part of the plan, Whit
ney said. In addition, changes will
be made to improve disability
access, as suggested by a separate
advisory committee.
"As we get to each project,
we're going to try to address the
accessibility issues," he said. "For
example, our goal in Wilbur is to
make one four-class house, one
all-frosh house and the theme
house — Okada — fully accessible
to the first floor."
The two new houses "will be
both vertically and horizontally
accessible — which means eleva
tors."
Rents won't jump
And all this, Whitney said,
won't substantially increase the
student cost of living.
"People won't be burdened by
higher room rates to make this
campaign work," he promised,
adding that there will be the usual
small increases but no huge hikes
in cost.

"Because we're doing it in a
debt service over 30 years, no
one's going to get hit by a big bill.
It would be unfair to make today's
students pay for dorms to be used
for years to come."
The improvements must pass
one more test with the trustees,
Whitney said. "We need to get the
board's final approval for the
specifics of the first-year plan.
The concept for 10 years has
already been approved."
The motivation for the renova
tion plan came from many
sources, said Whitney. First, resi
dences are getting old and "just
look run down."
Students should be able to
choose residences based on
whether the programs and
options fit their needs, he said,
not on the age of the buildings.
Also, "most of our energy has
gone into building new housing
over the last 10 years." Since it is
"very hard to do both a building
and a renovation campaign, . . .
some of our older residences have
slipped into a state where we can't
just let them go."
Deciding the order of renova
tions in a fair and consistent way
was also important to the plan
ners. Since Housing and Food
Service cannot borrow more than
$10 to $11 million each year,
Whitney said, the work had to be
spread out.
'Worst cases first'
Priorities were determined by
ranking the "worst cases first"

and using draw data and informa
tion from a facilities audit done
two years ago, Whitney said. They
are also trying to deal equally
with graduate and undergraduate
housing.
"There's been a lot of concern
from graduate students" that
undergraduate residences get
more attention and resources,
Whitney said.
Glenn Carroll, Stanford's man
ager of apartment facilities, also
mentioned the equity issue. "Sin
gle students in Rains and Escondi
do Village pay the same rates," he
said, even though Rains opened in
1988 and parts of Escondido are
more than 30 years old.
New carpets, stoves, refrigera
tors, counter tops and oak furni
ture will be combined with redone
kitchen floors and brighter paint
to give the apartments a new look,
he said.
The apartments will be spiffed
up over the summer and as stu
dents move out during the year.
"We're trying to work out a way
so students living here could real
ize the benefits" by moving into
the renovated residences, he said.
Especially for families living in
the apartments for up to five or
six years, Carroll said the
improvements are important. The
older units have "just looked a bit
long in the tooth."
Input was a vital part of the
process, Whitney said. "We don't
want to undertake something and
have students say 'Why did you do
that?' "

Still, there were no students on
the advisory committee. "The
(resident fellows) get feedback
from students," Whitney said,
adding that many of the meetings
were during the summer months
when students were gone.
Surveys and model rooms
"We did do a student survey a
year and a half ago about Housing
and Food Service," he said, adding
that he has consulted resident
assistants and Btudent groups.
Model rooms were also set up
beginning last fall in Wilbur and
Escondido for student perusal.
Student input has been solicit-

Ed through the model rooms pro
gram. One example: chairs with
carved seats will be used since
"families didn't want upholstered
dining room chairs because of
children," Carroll said.
