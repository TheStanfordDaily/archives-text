## Cardinal hoops crushes Cal, flounders against Trojans 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Just when the Stanford women's bas
ketball squad was finally beginning to
play like a defending national champion,
its hopes for winning back-to-back
NCAA titles were dealt a harsh blow last
night in Southern California.
After smoking the California Golden
Bears 89-63 Friday at Maples Pavilion,
the No. 3 Cardinal traveled to USC last
night where the Lady Trojans handed
them a 67-55 defeat and a rude awaken
ing.
Against archrival California, Stanford
(12-3, 3-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
performed like a team on a mission. All
five starters played nearly flawless bas
ketball as four Cardinal players scored in
double figures, while the other starter,
Kate Paye, gained recognition for her
outstanding defense.
"I was really pleased with our team
effort," Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "I don't think anyone
played poorly."
Stanford mounted a ferocious rally
midway through the first half, thanks to
some extremely accurate outside shoot
ing from an unlikely source — All-Amer
ican center Val Whiting bombed several
long-range shots, including a crowd
pleasing three-pointer, which accounted
for 15 of Stanford's first 17 points. Whit
ing's 20 opening-period points ignited
her squad to score 14 straight points to
build a sturdy 27-13 lead with 4:38
remaining in the opening half.
Whiting described her amazing per
formance with modesty.
"It was pretty lucky," Whiting said. "I
don't usually hit threes."
VanDerveer, on the other hand,
wasn't surprised by the senior center's
outside shooting display.

"After Val missed her first two shots,
I just said, 'Val, relax and take your
shot.' That opened the floodgates."
The Bears quickly fought back, clos
ing the lead to 44-39 near the 15-minute
mark in the second period. The Cardinal,
however, did not lose its composure, and
it responded to the California threat by
shifting its play into high gear. Stanford
exploded past its opponent, out-rebound
ing and out-scoring the Bears by 21
points in the remainder of the game.
"We're trying to improve in every game,
and I was really pleased with our second
half effort tonight," VanDerveer said.
Seniors Molly Goodenbour and Chris
MacMurdo as well as sophomore Rachel
Hemmer took charge offensively as the
three players combined for 31 second
period points. MacMurdo's aggressive
performance also netted her 14 rebounds
on the night.
The best performance of all may have
come from Stanford defensive-specialist
Paye. The sophomore walk-on pestered
California's star player, Milica Vukadi
novic, all night, holding her to 12 points
(four points less than her season aver
age) on 5-for-16 shooting, and forcing
her to commit three turnovers.
"Kate really helped our team a lot
with her defensive intensity," Van-
Derveer said. "I thought she did a great
job defensively on Vukadinovic."
Despite her outstanding defense and
her seven second-half points which
helped clinch the victory, Paye was quick
to recognize the contributions of her fel
low Cardinal players.
"I had a lot of help from my team
mates," she said. "It was a team effort."
Against the No. 14 Trojans (11-2, 5-
0), however, Stanford looked like a team
without any energy.
The Cardinal was manhandled by
sophomore sensation Lisa Leslie and

company as it played well below its
potential on the USC court. Leslie led all
players with 27 points and could not be
stopped by the Stanford squad.
"She's very fluent, very athletic,"
VanDerveer explained. "She has an
excellent touch."
The Cardinal's chances for victory
looked fairly promising in the opening
moments of the contest as a Goodenbour
three-pointer and a basket by Whiting
off of a steal propelled Stanford to an 11-
7 lead. The Trojans kept in stride with its
opponent, though, and the teams had
exchanged the lead six times by the
seven-minute mark.
It was at that point when the usually
potent Cardinal offense went sour.
Stanford failed to establish any kind
of shooting rhythm, and as a result, it
went five minutes without a bucket.
Meanwhile the Leslie-led USC squad
was busy building its lead and quickly
found itself up 37-29 at the half.
"They're a team that in a way can be
very dangerous and can be very streaky
and really get going," VanDerveer said
prior to the game.
In the second period the Cardinal
attack fared no better as it failed to cut
its deficit to anything smaller than seven
points. Although MacMurdo and Whit
ing both toyed with the idea of taking
charge and leading a Cardinal comeback,
the Trojan defense always seemed to
extinguish their efforts before any real
damage could be done. On the other end
of the court Leslie always seemed to be
scoring two of her 27 points just at a time
when Stanford appeared ready to cap
ture the momentum.
"You don't want to see Lisa get going
because it just might be something you
can't put out," VanDerveer said. "That's
something I'm always worried about.
She's a very, very talented player."

moments of the contest as a Goodenbour
three-pointer and a basket by Whiting
off of a steal propelled Stanford to an 11-
7 lead. The Trojans kept in stride with its
opponent, though, and the teams had
exchanged the lead six times by the
seven-minute mark.
It was at that point when the usually
potent Cardinal offense went sour.
Stanford failed to establish any kind
of shooting rhythm, and as a result, it
went five minutes without a bucket.
Meanwhile the Leslie-led USC squad
was busy building its lead and quickly
found itself up 37-29 at the half.
"They're a team that in a way can be
very dangerous and can be very streaky
and really get going," VanDerveer said
prior to the game.
In the second period the Cardinal
attack fared no better as it failed to cut
its deficit to anything smaller than seven
points. Although MacMurdo and Whit
ing both toyed with the idea of taking
charge and leading a Cardinal comeback,
the Trojan defense always seemed to
extinguish their efforts before any real
damage could be done. On the other end
of the court Leslie always seemed to be
scoring two of her 27 points just at a time
when Stanford appeared ready to cap
ture the momentum.
"You don't want to see Lisa get going
because it just might be something you
can't put out," VanDerveer said. "That's
something I'm always worried about.
She's a very, very talented player."

Val Whiting blazed through the Cardinal's victory over Cal on Friday night, but Stanford
fell to USC yesterday.
Just when the Stanford women's bas
ketball squad was finally beginning to
play like a defending national champion,
its hopes for winning back-to-back
NCAA titles were dealt a harsh blow last
night in Southern California.
After smoking the California Golden
Bears 89-63 Friday at Maples Pavilion,
the No. 3 Cardinal traveled to USC last
night where the Lady Trojans handed
them a 67-55 defeat and a rude awaken
ing.
Against archrival California, Stanford
(12-3, 3-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference)
performed like a team on a mission. All
five starters played nearly flawless bas
ketball as four Cardinal players scored in
double figures, while the other starter,
Kate Paye, gained recognition for her
outstanding defense.
"I was really pleased with our team
effort," Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "I don't think anyone
played poorly."
Stanford mounted a ferocious rally
midway through the first half, thanks to
some extremely accurate outside shoot
ing from an unlikely source — All-Amer
ican center Val Whiting bombed several
long-range shots, including a crowd
pleasing three-pointer, which accounted
for 15 of Stanford's first 17 points. Whit
ing's 20 opening-period points ignited
her squad to score 14 straight points to
build a sturdy 27-13 lead with 4:38
remaining in the opening half.
Whiting described her amazing per
formance with modesty.
"It was pretty lucky," Whiting said. "I
don't usually hit threes."
VanDerveer, on the other hand,
wasn't surprised by the senior center's
outside shooting display.

"After Val missed her first two shots,
I just said, 'Val, relax and take your
shot.' That opened the floodgates."
The Bears quickly fought back, clos
ing the lead to 44-39 near the 15-minute
mark in the second period. The Cardinal,
however, did not lose its composure, and
it responded to the California threat by
shifting its play into high gear. Stanford
exploded past its opponent, out-rebound
ing and out-scoring the Bears by 21
points in the remainder of the game.
"We're trying to improve in every game,
and I was really pleased with our second
half effort tonight," VanDerveer said.
Seniors Molly Goodenbour and Chris
MacMurdo as well as sophomore Rachel
Hemmer took charge offensively as the
three players combined for 31 second
period points. MacMurdo's aggressive
performance also netted her 14 rebounds
on the night.
The best performance of all may have
come from Stanford defensive-specialist
Paye. The sophomore walk-on pestered
California's star player, Milica Vukadi
novic, all night, holding her to 12 points
(four points less than her season aver
age) on 5-for-16 shooting, and forcing
her to commit three turnovers.
"Kate really helped our team a lot
with her defensive intensity," Van-
Derveer said. "I thought she did a great
job defensively on Vukadinovic."
Despite her outstanding defense and
her seven second-half points which
helped clinch the victory, Paye was quick
to recognize the contributions of her fel
low Cardinal players.
"I had a lot of help from my team
mates," she said. "It was a team effort."
Against the No. 14 Trojans (11-2, 5-
0), however, Stanford looked like a team
without any energy.
The Cardinal was manhandled by
sophomore sensation Lisa Leslie and

company as it played well below its
potential on the USC court. Leslie led all
players with 27 points and could not be
stopped by the Stanford squad.
"She's very fluent, very athletic,"
VanDerveer explained. "She has an
excellent touch."
