# Bush presidency equals high tide for Stanford athletics
## 
### 
Thoughts while contemplating the
difference between 91 and 38 per
cent:
Well, this is finally it. The end of an
era.
The "era" of which I speak, of course, is
the Bush Administration, which today
staggers across the finish line more than
two months after Washington's focus
turned toward morning jogs to McDon
ald's, Socks and "transition teams."
Regardless of their political affiliations,
Americans have truly witnessed a "new
world order" as it has come to pass in the
sporting world over the last four years
("Come to pass." That's what Mike Ditka,
the erstwhile coach of the Chicago Bears
who simply would not have survived during
a Democratic administration anyway,
lamented as he was fired just two weeks
ago). Here's one man's primer on the qua
drennium gone by:
Cardinal Comeuppance
Stanford sports have enjoyed unparal
leled, if not unbridled, growth and success
since Jan. 20, 1989. The arrival of Bill
Walsh a year ago, two consecutive bowl
appearances and counting, a co-Pacific 10
Conference championship last season, a top

10 national finish for the first time in a gen
eration, and several first-round NFL draft
picks have put the football program firmly
at the head of Cardinal athletic activity for
years to come.
Oh, and let us not forget: 24-14, 27-25
("Please clear the field, the game is not

over"), 38-21 and 41-21. Four years, four
Big Game W's. We've still got The Axe, and
we have no intention whatsoever of giving
it up anytime soon.
Men's basketball has made the postsea
son dance, be it NCAA or NIT, after each of
its previous four campaigns. We saw the
tail end of the Todd Lichti era and the
emergence and disappearance of the bril
liant collegiate career of Adam Keefe, possi

bly Stanford's all-time greatest shooting
star.
It was Lichti and Keefe who brought
about one of the greatest upsets in history
—_ those who witnessed it will always
remember the "Miracle at Maples," when
the Cardinal defeated then-No. 1 Arizona
— and it was these same two future NBA
picks that fell victim to an equally great
upset (in magnitude only), the "Siena
shocker" of the first round of the NCAA
tournament that same season.
Tar a VanDerveer has worked her magic
beautifully over the women's basketball
team, and her record over the last four
years speaks for itself: two NCAA champi
onships, four Final Fours, four Pac-10
titles and, finally, a No. 1 ranking before
the current campaign began.
Then there are the programs that con
tributed to Stanford's reputation as the
most well-rounded athletic school in the
nation, the sports that gave Cardinal
squads a record five NCAA championships
during the 1991-92 school year, six in cal
endar year 1992 (which must be some sort
of record) and into the double digits in total
titles (pardon the excessive alliteration)
during this Presidency.

Women's volleyball finally shook the
UCLA ghost and pulled off what could only
be called a minor miracle at The Pit in
Albuquerque, N.M., last month as it took
its first national crown. Janet Evans, Jeff
Rouse and Summer Sanders have given
way to Joe Hudepohl, Lea Loveless and
Jenny Thompson as the Cardinal swim
teams have ensured that there will be no
Olympic gold, Pac-10 or national title
shortage at deGuerre.
J air Lynch and Tim Ryan engineered a
masterful upset of Nebraska at last year's
NCAA men's gymnastics meet, and Lynch
and the Cardinal will look to repeat the feat
this spring. And tennis — well, both of
Stanford's teams will probably tighten
their stranglehold on the national title
"promised land" until well into the next
century.
Outside achievements
As Stanford became the dominant colle
giate athletic power under President Bush,
the centralized forces of professional sports
were thrown off-kilter, leaving the scene in
a semi-chaotic state.
The World Series was won by the Min
nesota Twins when they had the home
field advantage in both playoff series. Sur

prise. No, the real surprises were the Loma
Prieta Oakland A's sweep in 1989 (Tony
Laßussa had friends in high places), and
the Cincinnati Reds' sweep of the A's in
1990. What's next, a Canadian world
champion?
The Lakers and Celtics could be counted
on during the Reagan years. Next, it was
the Pistons and the Bulls. Who's next? Oh,
by the way, the Dream Team, the greatest
basketball team ever assembled, won a gold
medal in Barcelona and Magic Johnson
and Larry Bird, the dominant players of
the '80's, both retired last year.
The NFC did win four Super Bowls,
though, just to prove that some things
never change.
And, as we witness the multi-million
dollar extravaganza that is the swearing in
of a new Commander-in-Chief over the
next couple of days, we should try to
remember that change in the world at
large, like change in sports, can work both
ways.

1990. What's next, a Canadian world
champion?
The Lakers and Celtics could be counted
on during the Reagan years. Next, it was
the Pistons and the Bulls. Who's next? Oh,
by the way, the Dream Team, the greatest
basketball team ever assembled, won a gold
medal in Barcelona and Magic Johnson
and Larry Bird, the dominant players of
the '80's, both retired last year.
The NFC did win four Super Bowls,
though, just to prove that some things
never change.
And, as we witness the multi-million
dollar extravaganza that is the swearing in
of a new Commander-in-Chief over the

remember that change in the world at
large, like change in sports, can work both
ways.

Thoughts while contemplating the
difference between 91 and 38 per
cent:
Well, this is finally it. The end of an
era.
The "era" of which I speak, of course, is
the Bush Administration, which today
staggers across the finish line more than
two months after Washington's focus
turned toward morning jogs to McDon
ald's, Socks and "transition teams."
Regardless of their political affiliations,
Americans have truly witnessed a "new
world order" as it has come to pass in the
sporting world over the last four years
("Come to pass." That's what Mike Ditka,
the erstwhile coach of the Chicago Bears
who simply would not have survived during
a Democratic administration anyway,
lamented as he was fired just two weeks
ago). Here's one man's primer on the qua
drennium gone by:
Cardinal Comeuppance
Stanford sports have enjoyed unparal
leled, if not unbridled, growth and success
since Jan. 20, 1989. The arrival of Bill
Walsh a year ago, two consecutive bowl
appearances and counting, a co-Pacific 10
Conference championship last season, a top

10 national finish for the first time in a gen
eration, and several first-round NFL draft
picks have put the football program firmly
at the head of Cardinal athletic activity for
years to come.
Oh, and let us not forget: 24-14, 27-25
("Please clear the field, the game is not

over"), 38-21 and 41-21. Four years, four
Big Game W's. We've still got The Axe, and
we have no intention whatsoever of giving
it up anytime soon.
Men's basketball has made the postsea
son dance, be it NCAA or NIT, after each of
its previous four campaigns. We saw the
tail end of the Todd Lichti era and the
emergence and disappearance of the bril
liant collegiate career of Adam Keefe, possi

bly Stanford's all-time greatest shooting
star.
It was Lichti and Keefe who brought
about one of the greatest upsets in history
—_ those who witnessed it will always
remember the "Miracle at Maples," when
the Cardinal defeated then-No. 1 Arizona
— and it was these same two future NBA
picks that fell victim to an equally great
upset (in magnitude only), the "Siena
shocker" of the first round of the NCAA
tournament that same season.
Tar a VanDerveer has worked her magic
beautifully over the women's basketball
team, and her record over the last four
years speaks for itself: two NCAA champi
onships, four Final Fours, four Pac-10
titles and, finally, a No. 1 ranking before
the current campaign began.
Then there are the programs that con
tributed to Stanford's reputation as the
most well-rounded athletic school in the
nation, the sports that gave Cardinal
squads a record five NCAA championships
during the 1991-92 school year, six in cal
endar year 1992 (which must be some sort
of record) and into the double digits in total
titles (pardon the excessive alliteration)
during this Presidency.

Women's volleyball finally shook the
UCLA ghost and pulled off what could only
be called a minor miracle at The Pit in
Albuquerque, N.M., last month as it took
its first national crown. Janet Evans, Jeff
Rouse and Summer Sanders have given
way to Joe Hudepohl, Lea Loveless and
Jenny Thompson as the Cardinal swim
teams have ensured that there will be no
Olympic gold, Pac-10 or national title
shortage at deGuerre.
J air Lynch and Tim Ryan engineered a
masterful upset of Nebraska at last year's
NCAA men's gymnastics meet, and Lynch
and the Cardinal will look to repeat the feat
this spring. And tennis — well, both of
Stanford's teams will probably tighten
their stranglehold on the national title
"promised land" until well into the next
century.
Outside achievements
As Stanford became the dominant colle
giate athletic power under President Bush,
the centralized forces of professional sports
were thrown off-kilter, leaving the scene in
a semi-chaotic state.
The World Series was won by the Min
nesota Twins when they had the home
field advantage in both playoff series. Sur

prise. No, the real surprises were the Loma
Prieta Oakland A's sweep in 1989 (Tony
Laßussa had friends in high places), and
the Cincinnati Reds' sweep of the A's in
1990. What's next, a Canadian world
champion?
The Lakers and Celtics could be counted
on during the Reagan years. Next, it was
the Pistons and the Bulls. Who's next? Oh,
by the way, the Dream Team, the greatest
basketball team ever assembled, won a gold
medal in Barcelona and Magic Johnson
and Larry Bird, the dominant players of
the '80's, both retired last year.
The NFC did win four Super Bowls,
though, just to prove that some things
never change.
And, as we witness the multi-million
dollar extravaganza that is the swearing in
of a new Commander-in-Chief over the
next couple of days, we should try to
remember that change in the world at
