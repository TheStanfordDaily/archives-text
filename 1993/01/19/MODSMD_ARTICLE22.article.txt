# Cardinal swim squads turn in stellar weekend victories
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
As expected, the Stanford women's
swim team cruised by Pacific 10 Confer
ence rivals Arizona State and Arizona last
weekend by the considerable margins of
170-127 and 182-99.
Racing on very little rest, due to a hectic
travel itinerary, the Cardinal entered
Tempe, Ariz. Friday afternoon fresh off of a
5:30 a.m. red-eye flight. However, against
the ninth-ranked Sun Devils, the Cardinal
did not show any signs of fatigue, as it post
ed excellent times for this stage in the sea
son, according to head coach Richard Quick.
Freshman free-stylist Lisa Jacob and
junior butterfly specialist Pam Minthorn
both finished with NCAA-consideration,
'B' standard times, which they will
undoubtedly improve upon in upcoming
dual meets against UCLA and USC.
For co-captain Janel Jorgensen, "It was
a good stepping stone. ASU was our first
dual meet in more than a month and those
who swam well were extremely pleased.
Those who came out a little disappointed
learned a lot from this experience. But no
matter what, we'll get more and more con
fident as the season progresses."
Next, the Cardinal took a late flight out
of Tempe, Ariz, for an early 11 a.m. meet
against the No. 8 Wildcats. After defeating
them earlier in the season at the Texas
Invitational, Stanford fared just as well the
second time around.
In fact, the Cardinal actually had a field
day against the Wildcats, sweeping all the
individual and relay events, except for the
200 meter freestyle relay. According to
assistant coach Ross Gerry, even that event
was well within Stanford's grasp.
Individually, Olympians Jenny Thomp

son and Lea Loveless reaffirmed their trips
to the NCAA finals by shaving seconds off
of their old qualifying times, while Mary
Ellen Blanchard approached the NCAA
standard in three events.
Stanford's new additions to the team,
freshmen Jacob, Tammy Shannon and
Jane Skillman all won their respective
races. Overall, the Cardinal posted nine
NCAA-consideration and three NCAA
qualifying times for the weekend.
"The dual meets really sharpen our com
petitive edge," said co-captain Anne
Mahoney. "It's a good chance to practice
our racing, and I think everyone had at
least one good race."
In the diving events, defending NCAA
champion Eileen Richetelli swept the 1-
meter and 3-meter springboard competi
tions against both ASU and Arizona,
despite third-degree ligament sprains in
both ankles.
"We did pretty well over the weekend,
considering our road trip — including the
flights and the races — totalled only 36
hours," Quick said.
"Arizona State actually presented more
of a challenge to us than Arizona did
because (Arizonal is not a good dual meet
team, meaning they are not as well-round
ed," Quick added. "ASU gave us some very
good races, especially in the 100 and 200
breast, and the 500 free and the 400 I.M.
events, which they won."
After their first two meets of the season,
Stanford is tied with Texas for the No. 2
spot in the national rankings, behind a sur
prisingly strong Florida squad which
demolished Texas over the weekend. Look
ing ahead to the NCAA Finals, Florida and
Texas will be the only contenders standing
in the way of Stanford's defense of the
national title.
