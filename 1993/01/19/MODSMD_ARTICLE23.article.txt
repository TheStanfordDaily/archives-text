# Defending national champs fend off Wolverines
## 
### Kay Hong Staff writer 
Despite a tough training regimen,
inclement weather and a gaping chin
wound incurred by senior Eric Maurer
as he attempted to shave his face in
honor of the event, the Cardinal men's
swim team defeated the Michigan
Wolverines last Friday, 129-114.

Head coach Skip Kenney was ecstat
ic over the win. "I don't think we'll run
into another dual meet team as good as
Michigan," Kenney said. "Michigan
doesn't have a whole lot of competition
in their conference, so when they step
out of it, they're ready to go. This is a
huge win for us."
Though Michigan is, or was,
arguably the best dual meet team in the

nation, the defending NCAA champion
Cardinal not only delivered a promising
victory, but also managed to set two
new pool records along the way.
Consistent with their performances
thus far in the season, junior Derek
Weatherford and freshman Joe Hude
pohl turned in key wins for the Cardi-
nal.
Weatherford won the 200-yard
individual medley (1 minute,
49.15 seconds) and set a new pool
record in winning the 200 back
stroke (1:45.88), breaking the pre
vious record by almost a full 80C"
ond. Weatherford also combined
with Tyler Mayfield, Trip Zedlitz
and Hudepohl to win the 400 med
ley relay.
In addition to a first-place fin
ish in the 400 medley relay, Hude
pohl scored a decisive win in the
200 free (1:36.84) and teamed up
with Erik Maurer, Bill Schell and
Eric Diehl to win the 400 free
relay. The time of 2:58.99 turned
in by the Cardinal foursome shat
tered the previous deGuerre pool
record held by California by
almost two seconds.
However, Stanford's team vic
tory was not decided by first-place
finishes, but rather by battles for
second, third, fourth and even
fifth-place points.
When the 400 medley relay
team of Clay Tippins, co-captain
J.J. Freitag, Eddie Parenti and
Dan Kanner edged both Michigan
squads for a 1-2 Cardinal finish in
the meet's opening event, Stan
ford appeared to be looking at an
easy victory.

But Michigan came back just
one event later in the 1,000 free
with Eric Namesnik (9:12.65)
leading off a first, third, fourth
and fifth-place Wolverine sweep of
points, as Michigan began to chal
lenge for the victory.
Apparently the Cardinal had
other ideas, as Hudepohl, Kanner
and Diehl clinched the top three
spots in the 200 free and Maurer,
Schell and Mayfield grabbed sec
ond, third and fourth-place points
in the 50 free behind Wolverine
Olympian Gustavo Borges.
Erik Maurer led ofT another 2-
3-4-5 Cardinal attack in the 100
free (45.52), followed by Tippins,
Schell, and promising freshman
Scott Gagner. Sophomore Dan
Kanner (4:30.17), freshmen Eric
Diehl (4:31.34) and Mike Covert
(4:32.37) also contributed with a
2-3-4 finish in the closely contest
ed 500 free.
"Truthfully, I thought the
score would be much closer than it
was," Kenney said at the conclu
sion of the meet. "We had a a cou
ple guys — Kurt Grote in the 200
breast and Trip Zedlitz in the 200
I.M. — swim lifetime bests
unshaved. That was the real turn
ing point — a little bit here and a
little bit there."
Kenney's original game plan
was to try to match up the two
Olympians — Cardinal freshman
Joe Hudepohl and Michigan's
Gustavo Borges, a sophomore

freestyle specialist from Bar
barosa, Brazil — in a contest that
didn't end up taking place.
Borges went on to win the 50
and 100 free while Hudepohl

stuck to the longer 200 free and
the relays.
"The problem with having
someone like Joe Hudepohl is that
it's tough to figure out where you

want to put him," Kenney said.
"You get so excited making the
lineup and then you realize that
Joe's name is in there five times."
Interestingly enough, Michi

gan's head coach, Jon Urbanchek,
felt that the real key to a Wolver
ine victory rested not in his own
swimmers but in the condition of
Stanford junior Brian Retterer.
"Jon asked four or five people
about Brian's condition, but we
didn't really want anyone to know
what was going to happen.
There's spying, even in swim
ming," Kenney said, with a good
natured laugh.
Retterer, a second-place finisher
in the backstroke at the NCAA
Championships and a consistent
point scorer in past seasons, injured
his shoulder late last quarter and
decided on Thursday to redshirt
the remainder of the season.
Apparently, Urbanchek felt
that Michigan had a shot at a vic
tory if Retterer was unable to
swim. He was proven wrong on
Friday.
"They have an awesome collec
tion of swimmers," Urbanchek
said. "They do not need Brian Ret
terer to win this year.
And how will the Cardinal fare
at NCAA's this year? Even
Urbanchek, with four Olympians
on his Wolverine roster and a
0.942 winning percentage to boot,
seems resigned to contend for sec
ond place.
"They're unbeatable," Urbanchek
said of the Cardinal squad. "The only
team that can beat Stanford is Stan
ford. There will be a big dogfight at
NCAA's — for second place."

stroke (1:45.88), breaking the pre
vious record by almost a full 80C"
ond. Weatherford also combined
with Tyler Mayfield, Trip Zedlitz
and Hudepohl to win the 400 med
ley relay.
In addition to a first-place fin
ish in the 400 medley relay, Hude
pohl scored a decisive win in the
200 free (1:36.84) and teamed up
with Erik Maurer, Bill Schell and
Eric Diehl to win the 400 free
relay. The time of 2:58.99 turned
in by the Cardinal foursome shat
tered the previous deGuerre pool
record held by California by
almost two seconds.
However, Stanford's team vic
tory was not decided by first-place
finishes, but rather by battles for
second, third, fourth and even
fifth-place points.
When the 400 medley relay
team of Clay Tippins, co-captain
J.J. Freitag, Eddie Parenti and
Dan Kanner edged both Michigan
squads for a 1-2 Cardinal finish in
the meet's opening event, Stan
ford appeared to be looking at an
easy victory.

But Michigan came back just
one event later in the 1,000 free
with Eric Namesnik (9:12.65)
leading off a first, third, fourth
and fifth-place Wolverine sweep of
points, as Michigan began to chal
lenge for the victory.
Apparently the Cardinal had
other ideas, as Hudepohl, Kanner
and Diehl clinched the top three
spots in the 200 free and Maurer,
Schell and Mayfield grabbed sec
ond, third and fourth-place points
in the 50 free behind Wolverine
Olympian Gustavo Borges.
Erik Maurer led ofT another 2-
3-4-5 Cardinal attack in the 100
free (45.52), followed by Tippins,
Schell, and promising freshman
Scott Gagner. Sophomore Dan
Kanner (4:30.17), freshmen Eric
Diehl (4:31.34) and Mike Covert
(4:32.37) also contributed with a
2-3-4 finish in the closely contest
ed 500 free.
"Truthfully, I thought the
score would be much closer than it
was," Kenney said at the conclu
sion of the meet. "We had a a cou
ple guys — Kurt Grote in the 200
breast and Trip Zedlitz in the 200
I.M. — swim lifetime bests
unshaved. That was the real turn
ing point — a little bit here and a
little bit there."
Kenney's original game plan
was to try to match up the two
Olympians — Cardinal freshman
Joe Hudepohl and Michigan's
Gustavo Borges, a sophomore

freestyle specialist from Bar
barosa, Brazil — in a contest that
didn't end up taking place.
Borges went on to win the 50
and 100 free while Hudepohl

stuck to the longer 200 free and
the relays.
"The problem with having
someone like Joe Hudepohl is that
it's tough to figure out where you

want to put him," Kenney said.
"You get so excited making the
lineup and then you realize that
Joe's name is in there five times."
Interestingly enough, Michi

gan's head coach, Jon Urbanchek,
felt that the real key to a Wolver
ine victory rested not in his own
swimmers but in the condition of
Stanford junior Brian Retterer.
"Jon asked four or five people
about Brian's condition, but we
didn't really want anyone to know
what was going to happen.
There's spying, even in swim
ming," Kenney said, with a good
natured laugh.
Retterer, a second-place finisher
in the backstroke at the NCAA
Championships and a consistent
point scorer in past seasons, injured
his shoulder late last quarter and
decided on Thursday to redshirt
the remainder of the season.
Apparently, Urbanchek felt
that Michigan had a shot at a vic
tory if Retterer was unable to
swim. He was proven wrong on
Friday.
"They have an awesome collec
tion of swimmers," Urbanchek
said. "They do not need Brian Ret
terer to win this year.
And how will the Cardinal fare
at NCAA's this year? Even
Urbanchek, with four Olympians
on his Wolverine roster and a
0.942 winning percentage to boot,
seems resigned to contend for sec
ond place.
"They're unbeatable," Urbanchek
said of the Cardinal squad. "The only
team that can beat Stanford is Stan
ford. There will be a big dogfight at
NCAA's — for second place."

Derek Weatherford won the 200-yard individual medley as Stanford upended Michigan. Weatherford
also set a pool record in the 200 backstroke.
Despite a tough training regimen,
inclement weather and a gaping chin
wound incurred by senior Eric Maurer
as he attempted to shave his face in
honor of the event, the Cardinal men's
swim team defeated the Michigan
Wolverines last Friday, 129-114.

Head coach Skip Kenney was ecstat
ic over the win. "I don't think we'll run
into another dual meet team as good as
Michigan," Kenney said. "Michigan
doesn't have a whole lot of competition
in their conference, so when they step
out of it, they're ready to go. This is a
huge win for us."
Though Michigan is, or was,
arguably the best dual meet team in the

nation, the defending NCAA champion
Cardinal not only delivered a promising
victory, but also managed to set two
new pool records along the way.
Consistent with their performances
thus far in the season, junior Derek
Weatherford and freshman Joe Hude
pohl turned in key wins for the Cardi-
nal.
Weatherford won the 200-yard
individual medley (1 minute,
49.15 seconds) and set a new pool
record in winning the 200 back
stroke (1:45.88), breaking the pre
vious record by almost a full 80C"
ond. Weatherford also combined
with Tyler Mayfield, Trip Zedlitz
and Hudepohl to win the 400 med
