# Stanford nabs fourth place at UCSB tourney
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
The Stanford men's volleyball team entered last
weekend's 29th Annual UC-Santa Barbara/ Bud
Light Collegiate Invitational Tournament looking
for the right starting lineup and left with a fourth
place finish and some combinations to ponder.
The Cardinal won five games and lost three in
the 24-team tournament.
But seven of the eight matches were best-two
out-of-three, and since the NCAA only recognizes
matches that are best-three-out-of-five, Stanford is
officially 0-1.
Stanford started the weekend tournament on a
high note, defeating UCSB's no. 2-squad (UCSB
entered two teams because they hosted the event.),
Loyola Marymount and San Jose State in opening
round robin play. All three teams fell to the Stan
ford spikers in straight games.
Then the Cardinal hit the first of three
snags. Its fourth match pitted it against UCLA,
ranked No. 1 in the Volleyball Monthly presea
son polls.
The Bruins dealt with Stanford by winning in
straight games, 15-11, 16-14. They then went on to
beat UCSB's first team in the title game to win the
tournament.
Rebounding strongly, Stanford beat both the
University of Manitoba and California in straight
games.
However, defeat struck the spikers again as
USC, a team the Cardinal had beaten twice earlier
in preseason matches, handed it its second loss, 17-
16, 11-15, 13-15.
This defeat sent the Cardinal to a final third
place match against Pepperdine, last year's NCAA
Champion.
It was the only best-of-five match either team
would play over the weekend, but the Waves would
only need four, winning 15-10, 4-15, 15-7, 15-9.
The Stanford spikers left the UCSB Events Center
with a fourth-place finish and a 0-1 record.
All three of Stanford's losses were to top ranked
teams, with UCLA at No. 1, Pepperdine at No. 2
and USC at No. 5.
But according to Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves, these three teams only got a glimpse of
what the No. 3 Cardinal will show them during the
heart of the season.
"We played all 12 players a lot," Nieves said. "We
rotated the setters and the middle blockers and got
a good look at everyone in match situations."
For Canyon Ceman, the only Cardinal selected
to the All-Tournament team, this constant shuf
fling definitely cost Stanford some key points, if
not some key games. "Various hitters need differ
ent types of sets," Ceman said. "With so much
changing, it's hard for the team to get in rhythm."
"Now the coaching staff must analyze the tour
nament and zero in on a starting lineup," contin
ued Nieves.
Besides Ceman, Coach Nieves also highlighted
three other players who had outstanding weekends
— Mike Lambert, David Fischer and Bob Hillman.
"We didn't side out like we need to and we didn't
pass as well as usual," said Nieves. "Overall,
though, we're where we need to be after one week."
The Stanford squad battles its next opponent,
California, this Friday at home. The match starts
at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
