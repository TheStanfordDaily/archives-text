# Stanford netters get mixed results at Pac-10 Indoors
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
For the third year in a row,
the men's tennis team claimed
top honors at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Indoor Championships.
Led by junior Michael Flanagan,
every one of the eight participat
ing Cardinal players progressed
to at least the quarterfinals.
Flanagan, following in '92
graduate Alex O'Brien's foot
steps, defeated Seattle's home
town favorite, Chet Crile, in the
Flight 1 finals. The 6-3, 6-1 victo
ry was "a great win for Michael,"
according to Stanford head coach
Dick Gould. "I was happy for him
because he executed things. It
was nice to see Michael step up."
En route to a tournament vic
tory, Flanagan blanked Oregon's
Lee Kirner, 6-0, 6-0, and gave up
only two games to top-seeded
Brian MacPhie before MacPhie
retired with an elbow injury.
Flanagan followed that 6-2, 2-0
victory with a long 6-2, 4-6, 7-6
(3) battle against third-seeded
Bruce Haddad of Arizona State
before clinching the tournament
title.
Stanford's Robert Devens,
suffering from back pains, lost in
the top flight's quarterfinals to
USC's David Ekerot, 4-6, 4-6.
In Flight 2 action, Chris Coco
tos won several nail-biting,
tiebreaker matches before falling
to USC's Jon Leach, 5-7, 0-6. "I
think I played pretty well," he
said. "Today (in the finals) I was
sluggish — the last couple days
of matches took their toll."
Leach also claimed Cardinal
Vimal Patel among his victims
during his march to Flight 2 vic
tory. Patel lost in the semifinals,
4-6, 3-6.
Stanford team captain Roman

Sydorak and rookie Jeff Salzen
stein battled through several
rounds of the third flight before
losing in the quarterfinals, 6-7,
6-1, 1-6 and 3-6, 2-6, respective
ly-
Two other Cardinal freshmen,
Ricky Becker and Jim Thomas,
were defeated in the semifinals of
Flight 4.
The team's consensus was
positive toward the freshmen's
performance: "They did real well
and didn't act like freshman,"
Cocotos said. "They didn't act
like this was the greatest thing in
the world, they just went out and
got the job done. They weren't
intimidated by anyone."
In doubles action, two Cardi
nal teams were eliminated in the
final round while the other two
lost in the semifinals. Despite an
impressive showing against
UCLA's Robert Janecek and
Sebastian Leßlanc, Cocotos and
Flanagan lost 6-7 (4), 6-4, 3-6 in
Flight 1.
Cocotos was pleased with this
performance, as last weekend the
Bruins duo defeated the nation's
top-ranked team, USC's Jon
Leach and Brian MacPhie. "Even
though we lost I felt like these
guys were definitely beatable,"
he said.
In Flight 3, Patel and Thomas
also lost a close final-round
match to a tough UCLA pair,
Darin Pleasant and Davide San
guinetti, 4-6, 6-7 (5).
Devens paired up with Sydo
rak to compete in the second
flight. Another Bruin duo, this
time Fritz Bissell and Graham
Gillis, defeated the Cardinal
team 7-6 (5), 6-1 in the semifi
nals.
The lone victory for tourna
ment-host Washington came in
Flight 4 doubles. Huskies Mark

DeMaine and Inaki Marti beat
Stanford's Salzenstein and Beck
er 7-6, 6-4 in the semifinals
before nabbing a final-round vic
tory.
By the end of the weekend,
coach Gould had sized up the
Pac-10 competition for this sea
son. "Here's what we learned:
USC is awesome. They have

tremendous depth, all their
starters are back and they have
two really good freshmen." He
also noted that although UCLA
lost many of its top players, it
gained several top new
prospects. ASU and California
also showed much improve
ment, but Gould was quick to
assert that Stanford "is not

going be bad.
"It was a solid tournament for
a good, not a great, team. Usual
ly, out of eight singles players
and four doubles teams, there is
going to be something along the
way that you're disappointed
with, but this weekend there was
no one. . . . Everybody had really
solid matches. M

Cocotos felt it was an especial
ly good start for the team, con
sidering the poor weather.
"We're not in good shape because
we've had such limited time out
on the courts because of all the
rain," he said. "But hopefully we
can use this (tournament) as a
good base for the rest of the sea
son."

top honors at the Pacific 10 Con
ference Indoor Championships.
Led by junior Michael Flanagan,
every one of the eight participat
ing Cardinal players progressed
to at least the quarterfinals.
Flanagan, following in '92
graduate Alex O'Brien's foot
steps, defeated Seattle's home
town favorite, Chet Crile, in the
Flight 1 finals. The 6-3, 6-1 victo
ry was "a great win for Michael,"
according to Stanford head coach
Dick Gould. "I was happy for him
because he executed things. It
was nice to see Michael step up."
En route to a tournament vic
tory, Flanagan blanked Oregon's
Lee Kirner, 6-0, 6-0, and gave up
only two games to top-seeded
Brian MacPhie before MacPhie
retired with an elbow injury.
Flanagan followed that 6-2, 2-0
victory with a long 6-2, 4-6, 7-6
(3) battle against third-seeded
Bruce Haddad of Arizona State
before clinching the tournament
title.
Stanford's Robert Devens,
suffering from back pains, lost in
the top flight's quarterfinals to
USC's David Ekerot, 4-6, 4-6.
In Flight 2 action, Chris Coco
tos won several nail-biting,
tiebreaker matches before falling
to USC's Jon Leach, 5-7, 0-6. "I
think I played pretty well," he
said. "Today (in the finals) I was
sluggish — the last couple days
of matches took their toll."
Leach also claimed Cardinal
Vimal Patel among his victims
during his march to Flight 2 vic
tory. Patel lost in the semifinals,
4-6, 3-6.
Stanford team captain Roman

Sydorak and rookie Jeff Salzen
stein battled through several
rounds of the third flight before
losing in the quarterfinals, 6-7,
6-1, 1-6 and 3-6, 2-6, respective
ly-
Two other Cardinal freshmen,
Ricky Becker and Jim Thomas,
were defeated in the semifinals of
Flight 4.
The team's consensus was
positive toward the freshmen's
performance: "They did real well
and didn't act like freshman,"
Cocotos said. "They didn't act
like this was the greatest thing in
the world, they just went out and
got the job done. They weren't
intimidated by anyone."
In doubles action, two Cardi
nal teams were eliminated in the
final round while the other two
lost in the semifinals. Despite an
impressive showing against
UCLA's Robert Janecek and
Sebastian Leßlanc, Cocotos and
Flanagan lost 6-7 (4), 6-4, 3-6 in
Flight 1.
Cocotos was pleased with this
performance, as last weekend the
Bruins duo defeated the nation's
top-ranked team, USC's Jon
Leach and Brian MacPhie. "Even
though we lost I felt like these
guys were definitely beatable,"
he said.
In Flight 3, Patel and Thomas
also lost a close final-round
match to a tough UCLA pair,
Darin Pleasant and Davide San
guinetti, 4-6, 6-7 (5).
Devens paired up with Sydo
rak to compete in the second
flight. Another Bruin duo, this
time Fritz Bissell and Graham
Gillis, defeated the Cardinal
team 7-6 (5), 6-1 in the semifi
nals.
The lone victory for tourna
ment-host Washington came in
Flight 4 doubles. Huskies Mark

DeMaine and Inaki Marti beat
Stanford's Salzenstein and Beck
er 7-6, 6-4 in the semifinals
before nabbing a final-round vic
tory.
By the end of the weekend,
coach Gould had sized up the
Pac-10 competition for this sea
son. "Here's what we learned:
USC is awesome. They have

tremendous depth, all their
starters are back and they have
two really good freshmen." He
also noted that although UCLA
lost many of its top players, it
gained several top new
prospects. ASU and California
also showed much improve
ment, but Gould was quick to
assert that Stanford "is not

going be bad.
"It was a solid tournament for
a good, not a great, team. Usual
ly, out of eight singles players
and four doubles teams, there is
going to be something along the
way that you're disappointed
with, but this weekend there was
no one. . . . Everybody had really
solid matches. M

Cocotos felt it was an especial
ly good start for the team, con
sidering the poor weather.
"We're not in good shape because
we've had such limited time out
on the courts because of all the
rain," he said. "But hopefully we
can use this (tournament) as a
good base for the rest of the sea
son."
