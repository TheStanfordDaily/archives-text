# Cardinal off balance against OSU
## 
### Sean May Staff writer 
Oregon State showed the Stan
ford women's gymnastics team
what it takes to be an elite team, as
the No. 4 ranked Beavers defeated
the Cardinal Saturday night in
Maples Pavilion, 191.00 - 188.15.
The No. 12 Cardinal was hurt in
the competition by several falls,
particularly on the beam, but
Coach Breck Greenwood wasn't
overly worried about his team's
performance.
"We *e still not as good in the
meet as we are in practice," he
said. "But in our second meet last
year, we hit everything and got
this score; this year we had four or
five misses."
The Cardinal was led in the all
around competition by sophomore
Meegan Lannin, who finished sec
ond with a score of 37.50, and
freshman Linda Chun, who came
in third with 37.20. Chun's beam
routine scored a 9.75, the third best
beam score in Stanford history.
"I'm pretty happy because it
was my first ever home meet,"
Chun said, adding that she still
hopes to add difficulty to her rou
tines.
While Lannin was not heavily
touted in the Stanford media
guide, Greenwood said her perfor
mance was no surprise.
Four Stanford athletes had per
sonal-best performances against
the Beavers. Chun's beam and bar
routines were both career bests,
while junior Mollie Brown scored a
personal record of 9.65 on the bars.
Lannin tied her best with a 9.55 on
the floor, and sophomore Ail-Amer
ican Jene Elzie, bothered with a bad
back, earned a 9.75 on the vault.
Junior All-American Chari
Knight led Oregon State with a
meet-high all-around score of

39.05.
When asked what the Cardinal
needed to do to improve, Stan
ford's Greenwood said, "Get
healthy. Jen 6 has only been in the
gym for three days, and that's not
enough to get back to form." He
continued by saying that Stanford

was still adding difficulty to its
routines.
"If we were perfect today, then we
would be close to beating Oregon
State," Greenwood said. "When
Jen 6 and Hillary (Anderson) are
on, then we'll score 190s every
time."
