# Olympian Miller a hit at Maples
## 
### Sean May Staff writer 
The record crowd of 2,040
had showed up more for
"Shannon Miller Night," than
the rest of the meet, as the gold
medalist from Barcelona came
to Maples Pavilion Saturday to
sign autographs and perform
her Olympic floor routine.
The biggest cheer of the
night was reserved for the star
of the show, 15-year-old
Olympic standout Miller. The
crowd stomped their feet when
the five-medal-winner was
introduced, creating a rum
bling sound far louder than
that from Friday night's 5.1
earthquake.
Miller said even though she
has Olympic gold under her
belt, she's not ready to retire
yet, and still trains five to six
hours a day.
"I'm taking it a year at a
time; I still hope to be in
Atlanta" for the 1996 Olympics,
the 15-year-old Oklahoman
said.
Miller returned to school
this year, where she said she
had no trouble fitting back in,
although she had to travel with
a tutor during the five-week

exhibition tour she finished
just before her performance at
Stanford.
This arrangement was not
without its drawbacks. Miller
turns 16 in March, and though
she already has a Saturn, she
can't drive it.
"I haven't been able to take
driver's ed yet," she said.
Although this was the first
college meet that Miller has
ever watched, she has compet
ed with and against many of
the gymnasts in the meet,
including Stanford's Tina
Snowden and Hillary Ander
son, as well as Oregon State's
Chari Knight.
Her coach Steve Nuno, a for
mer collegiate coach at the Uni
versity of Massachusetts and
Oklahoma University, also
watched the meet, observing that
the quality of college gymnastics
has risen substantially since
he left college coaching in 1985.
"The coach's role is essen
tial," he said. "If you take a
tour of Paris by yourself, you'll
see a couple things, and that's
it. But you'll see a lot more and
really enjoy your tour if you
have a guide. She doesn't know
what to do on her own. ... A
coach is like a guide."
