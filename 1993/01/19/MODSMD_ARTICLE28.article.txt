# Grapplers fall to Cal Poly-SLO, Southern Oregon
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
Despite tremendous outings by individual grap
plers, the Stanford wrestling team couldn't over
come its injury handicaps and forfeitures as it took
on Pacific 10 Conference-rival Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo and Southern Oregon this weekend. The
Cardinal lost to the Southern Oregon squad 22-20,
and also fell to the Mustangs by a deceptively large
margin of 32-10.
However, Cardinal head coach Chris Horpel
believed the two dual meets demonstrated just how
far his team has progressed since the beginning of
the season.
"I always believe in maximum effort," Horpel
said. "That's what the guys gave, and to me, that's
success."
While the Cardinal triumphed in only three of its
10 matches against Cal Poly-SLO, that was not the
complete story. Stanford had to forfeit the 177-
pound and heavyweight classes due to its lack of

wrestlers at those divisions, and three Cardinal
wrestlers lost very close decisions.
Among the latter, 118-pound senior Phil Nowick
found himself ahead with three seconds remaining
in regulation.
He was atop his nationally-ranked opponent,
Joey Dansby, needing only to hold his position for
the three seconds. Instead, Dansby managed to
escape, which earned him the necessary points to
send the contest into overtime, during which he
scored a takedown against Nowick to secure the
match.
Similarly, 158-pound sophomore Sahlan Mar
tin lost by a mere takedown, and 190-pound

victory.
Senior Dave Nowick at 126 pounds, redshirt
freshman Jimmy Aguirre at 134 pounds and junior
Lance Johnson at 142 pounds triumphed in their
encounters with the Mustangs. However, since
dual meet scores depend mainly on the number of
total victories, unless individual grapplers capture

major wins by pin-fall, Stanford did not emerge as
the victor.
"That was the best we've wrestled all year," said
Horpel. "We wrestled even better the next night
against Southern Oregon."
This time, five Cardinal grapplers won their
matches. Both Nowicks, Aguirre, Johnson and 150-
pound redshirt freshman Tod Surmon stood among
them, while 167-pound freshman C.E. Smith who
nursed an ankle injury, Martin and Liu lost close
decisions.
Liu came up just short of victory against the top
ranked 190-pound wrestler in the NAIA.
Although Stanford triumphed in five of the eight
matches in which it competed, the two forfeitures
and the margin of defeat in the three losses gave
Southern Oregon the victory.
"We lost both meets because of little mistakes,"
Horpel said. "But we can correct those mistakes very
easily."
Horpel and Stanford will look to do that next Sat
urday against UC-Davis.
