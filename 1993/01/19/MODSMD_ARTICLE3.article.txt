# Wilbur the dregs of The Draw no more?
## 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
At age 43, Wilbur Hall is getting a
little cosmetic surgery — and resi
dents hope the face lift will help their
much-disparaged dormitory gain
some respect.
"Wilbur has always been criticized
and trashed by students as an unpopu
lar place to live," said Ed Iwata, one of
Okada's resident fellows. "Now the ren
ovation will hopefully give it new life."
The $8 million remodeling will be
completed this summer, said Rodger
Whitney, director of Student Housing
Operations.
"Wilbur will be a whole new place,"
he said.
New carpets, bright paint and new
lighting will grace the student rooms.
Lounges, bathrooms and landscaping
will also feel the impact of the renova
tions.
Wilbur will also get all-new dining
room equipment and offer a choice be
tween a la carte or full board meal
plans, Whitney said. "Some of that din
ing room furniture is exactly the same
furniture as when the dorm was
first constructed."
Rinconada RF Rich Holeton, a
member of the renovation cam
paign's advisory committee, said
Wilbur's position at the top of the
list is something he has "been
sort of lobbying for."
"Wilbur was the logical place
because while Stern is clearly on
the lower end of things along with
Wilbur, Stern had its dining room
redone," Holeton said.
He said he has concentrated on
encouraging changes that "make
a difference in student lives." For
example, nicer lounges mean
more to students than invisible
maintenance like plumbing or

wiring, he added.
His proximity to students gives
him "a different perspective than
others on the committee," Hole
ton said. And factors such as com
mon spaces and food quality are
"key to how people feel about
where they live" and whether
they spend time there.
Six model rooms have already
been set up on the first floor of
Okada, and students had a chance
to inspect them earlier in the year.
"It's a definite improvement," said
Paul Carney, a freshman who lives
in one of the models.
He and his roommate are able
to take advantage of the new
modular furniture that will
replace chunky built-in furniture
in every room next year. "We've
been able to do more interesting
set ups than on the other floors
with less hassle," Carney said.
