week.

WASHINGTON - According
to the Constitution, all President
elect Bill Clinton has to do to as
sume office is repeat a simple oath
tomorrow afternoon.
In practice, however, the Inau
guration of the 42nd President of
the United States will be a week
long extravaganza featuring every
thing from Michael Jackson to a
one-ton cheesecake.
The week's activities started off
Sunday with a two-day festival
showcasing America's culture in
an attempt to include and enter
tain a large number of people.

Dubbed "America's Reunion on
the Mall," the festival combined a
diversity of foods, crafts, and free
music in 20 heated tents on the
Mall between the Washington
Monument and the Capitol.
"I liked it a lot," said junior
Michelle Barrett, who attended
Stanford in Washington in the fall
and returned for the Inaugura
tion. "It included a lot of people
that maybe couldn't get tickets to
the balls or other events."
More than 60 musicians, in
cluding Toad the Wet Sprocket,
Wynton Marsalis, Michelle

Shocked, Blues Traveler, Robert
Cray, Los Lobos, Salt-N-Pepa and
Peter, Paul and Mary performed
over the two days in four large
tents.
Blues master Taj Mahal ex
plained the rationale behind the
music was to unify, motivate and
entertain. "Music was a transi
tional force in this generation's
minds, but music as a viable po
litical force has been left be
hind."
Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul
and Mary expressed a similar sen
timent: "This is music as a cata

lyst. This isn't entertainment
time, this is catalyst time."
In addition to the music, three
giant tents housed 50 food vendors
selling everything from the one
ton cheesecake to spare ribs, and
31 craftsmen from around the
country displayed their wares.
Other exhibits included a model
of the space shuttle from NASA
and a "Town Meeting Wall" on
which school children posted their
hopes for America on colored con
struction paper.
The crowd overflowed the Mall,
creating half hour-long lines for

food and major transportation
complications.
The Metro added extra trains
and the Presidential Inaugural
Committee ran special shuttles
between the Mall and 30 major
Washington area hotels.
Vendors on the Mall sold com
memorative T-shirts, sweat
shirts, and buttons at a steady clip
all day.
In addition, three official "In
augural stores" sell Inaugural yo
yos, golf balls, license plates and

saxophone-shaped lapel pins.
Most spectators were impressed
by the two-day extravaganza,
although not everyone was there
for the same reasons.
Lori Shinseki, a Stanford grad
uate student in the Communica
tion Department came to Wash
ington with her husband for the
Inauguration. "We were here last
time in 1989 and I don't remem
ber it being such a people celebra
tion."
"We came for the bands, espe
cially Bob [WeirJ and Rob
[Wasserman]," said Jenny Porter
of Eugene, Oregon. "We're hoping
Jerry [Garcia] will show up. .. .
We don't care too much about the
political stuff."
