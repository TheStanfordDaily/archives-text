# Audiovisual equipment to be installed
## Registrar's office stretches budget to start equipping classrooms 
### Neerad Lal Staff writer 
Despite severe budget cuts over the last few
years, the Registrar's Office has begun to equip
major classrooms on campus with much-needed au
diovisual equipment. But in the long run, the im
provements will save money by eliminating the need
to pay for repeat delivery of the items by Events and
Services.
The office will begin the program this year by plac
ing equipment in 18 classrooms at the History Corner
and some of the larger lecture halls on campus. The
ultimate goal is to equip all 145 registrar-scheduled
classrooms, at an average cost of $6,000 per room.
"It's been long overdue," said Acting Registrar
Jack Farrell, who oversees classroom improvements
on campus. Farrell hopes to have all of the equipment
installed over the next three to four years.
"Now we have a very beneficial arrangement for
the University. We'll pay for the installation and
equipment and Events and Services will maintain it
free of charge."
Use of the new audiovisual equipment will be free
for regular classes; Events and Services will charge
fees for its operation during summer conferences,
club meetings and other non-class related activities
to defray maintenance costs.
Standard equipment in each room will include an
overhead transparency projector (already in most
classrooms since the end of last year), slide projector,
video cassette recorder and television set or video

projector. All equipment will be bolted down with se
curity devices to prevent theft, and operating in
structions will be provided.
Arranging for the funds to buy the equipment has
been a challenge, Farrell said, because of far-reaching
budget cuts in the Registrar's allocations. The office
has had to reduce its spending for classroom im
provements by some 40 percent, which amounts to a
loss of $ 140,000 every year, he said.
"These are permanent cuts which were exacerbat
ed by the earthquake," said Farrell, referring to the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake that caused millions of
dollars worth of damage at Stanford.
As a result, the Registrar's office is trying to plan
its budget as effectively as possible in order to provide
the campus with the optimum amount of audiovisual
equipment.
A committee commissioned by Mary Edmonds, vice
provost for student affairs, and Robert Street, vice
provost and dean of Libraries and Information Re
sources, will assess the needs of various classrooms
across campus.
The group is presently considering fully equipped
multi-media rooms with higher-end technology, such
as laser-disc projectors and computer networks for
SUNET videos.
Recent technology is being emphasized, Farrell
said, because "things become obsolete and have to re
placed. Our first classroom computers . . . are now
Model Ts."
The Registrar's office plans to select equipment
that will last at least five years after it is purchased.
