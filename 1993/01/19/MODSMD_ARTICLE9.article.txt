# 'Cutting edge' nutrition program may be swimmers' winning edge
## 
### Rich Stolz Staff writer 
The defending NCAA champion men's
and women's swimming teams are unde
feated thus far in 1992-93. But in a sport
where the difference between first and sec
ond place can be only a hundredth of a sec
ond, any advantage has some significance.
The key to the Stanford swimming teams'
"winning edge" may be the Bio/Syn diet.
"It's the cutting edge of research and ap
plication in this field. I'm surprised more
programs don't use it," said men's swim
ming coach Skip Kenney, an enthusiastic
endorser of the program.
Stanford swimming is the only sports
program in the country currently employ
ing the Bio/Syn program, which emphasizes
a proper ratio of proteins and carbohydrates
in a balanced diet. And surprisingly, it en
courages the consumption of fats, supple
mented with capsules, protein and fat-en
riched Bio/Syn bars.
Though the program does not actually
force-feed the athletes, swimmers are
strongly encouraged to conform to these di
etary guidelines. "Discipline in a diet is the

hardest thing an athlete can face," Kenney
said, "It takes a real special athlete to make
it through the chow line."
Through guest speakers and weekly eval
uations, participants are advised to stream
line their diets. The team philosophy on nu
trition is that everything put in the mouth
causes some hormonal response. In order to
control the response, athletes must control
what they eat.
That is no easy task. The Bio/Syn bars
which are eaten before and after practice
are an acquired taste, as are the fish oil Eico
max capsules.
Most swimmers are skeptical about chang
ing their diets so drastically. "It's harder to
discipline yourself with carbohydrates and
beer everywhere," said Olympic freestyler
Jenny Thompson, "Food Service doesn't give
much of a choice. And then there's pizza."
The program has developed over a six
year period since Kenney and women's
swimming coach Richard Quick first intro
duced the diet to their teams. Previous to
that, the coaches tested the diet on them
selves for a year. Kenney and Quick noticed
marked improvement in their endurance,
their recovery speed and the degree of sore

ness they experienced after workouts.
Both coaches were eager to try the diet
with their athletes. Quick even brought it
with him to the 1992 Olympics.
There, the program appeared to have em
pirical success. Pablo Morales, who was on
the diet, won his gold medal only by a mar
gin of seven-hundedths of a second.
"You have to make sure you cover all the
bases and have a 100 percent complete pro
gram," Kenney said. "Any advantage makes
you feel psychologically better."
Thompson experienced more drastic re
sults. After one year on the Bio/Syn diet, she
shaved 1.5 seconds off of her time in the
100-meter freestyle. "It was incredible be
cause my times were already at a nationally
competitive level," Thompson said.
According to Kenney, further proof of
Bio/Syn's effectiveness can be found in the
fact that Stanford was the only program to
perform well at both the Olympic Trials and
NCAA Championships last year. These
meets were separated by less than two weeks.
The Bio/Syn diet is the product of years
of research performed by Dr. Barry Sears.
Originally devised to promote longevity and
alleviate heart problems, he discovered that

it was also helpful to athletes. The diet cov
ers all areas of nutrition and its influence on
the biochemical processes in the body.
It emphasizes the importance of the
body's hormonal responses to certain foods.
According to Sears, one's diet should be
about 40 percent carbohydrate, 30 percent
protein and 30 percent fat.
The critical hormones in this equation
are glucagon and insulin. The body's bal
ance of insulin and glucagon is controlled by
protein and carbohydrate consumption.
This glucagon-to-insulin ratio plays a
large factor in the athlete's conditioning. A
glucagon-favored diet promotes decreased
hunger, higher endurance, mental alert
ness, less muscle fatigue and less body fat.
Body fat is the primary source of muscle en
ergy. The brain, however, can only use carbo
hydrates. When the brain needs more energy
it decreases the amount of insulin in the blood
stream and increases the amount of glucagon.
Glucagon is a hormone that encourages
the breakdown of glycogen, a readily avail
able source of glucose, in the liver, thereby
increasing the blood sugar level. Glucagon
also frees fat from fatty tissue, thereby feed
ing the muscles.
