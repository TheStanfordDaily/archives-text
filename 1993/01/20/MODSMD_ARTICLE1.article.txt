# Stanford fares well under final indirect-cost codes
## 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Having worked feverishly to finish be
fore the arrival of the Clinton administra
tion, the federal government announced
new indirect-cost regulations late yester
day afternoon.
While the changed rules will cost the
University millions of dollars per year,
Stanford appears to have emerged in bet
ter shape than was predicted based upon
earlier drafts.
The new regulations are scheduled to
be in place nationwide on Jan. 1, 1994,
and will take effect at Stanford during
academic year 1994-95.
The University's indirect-cost rate will
not to go much above the current 60.3 per
cent, according to Chief Financial Officer
Peter Van Etten, and, as expected, the gov
ernment officially ended tuition remission
— the system of government reimburse-

ment for some of the tu
ition of graduate stu
dents involved in federal
ly sponsored research
through indirect costs.
But the government
responded favorably to
many written comments
made by Stanford and
other schools, making
changes that appear to

avert what could have been a dramatic
drop of $11 million in reimbursement to
the University.
In the rules proposed by the govern
ment last month, administrative and cler
ical personnel salaries were to be added to
the administrative cost pool.
The problem, however, was that the
University is already $6 million to $8 mil
lion over the 26 percent cap on the admin
istrative cost pool — meaning that Stan
ford simply would not have been reim

bursed for any other expenses that were
added to the area.
The final version changes the wording,
allowing schools to charge those depart
mental expenses as direct costs for "major
projects" where the clerical personnel can
be directly tied to the project.
"We are pleased that the government
has changed the wording . .. but it is un
clear what are 'non-major' projects," Van
Etten said. "We are concerned how the
changes will be interpreted."
Had the change been implemented as
first proposed, it could have cost the Uni
versity up to $11 million per year. With
the new wording, Van Etten said he ex
pects that Stanford will recover "most of
the $11 million because a sipiificant por
tion of the research is in major projects."
Despite this favorable news, the new
rules may lead to Stanford receiving less
money that it does now from the adminis
trative cost pool.

In addition to the 26 percent cap, the
government implemented a 24 percent
threshold. In other words, all schools
would receive a rate of 24 percent for ad
ministrative expenses, and the cost of
doing the paperwork to justify the 26 per
cent rate might actually be more expen
sive than the extra 2 percent.
The other major concern addressed by
the government in the final version of the
regulations involves the transition away
from tuition remission.
Beginning Oct. 1, 1997, Stanford and
the three other schools using tuition re
mission (MIT, Caltech and Columbia) will
be required to include the tuition of grad
uate students involved in research as a di
rect charge of a grant.
Because the tuition of graduate stu
dents is more expensive than the salaries
of postdoctoral students, researchers may
tend to shift away from Ph.D. candidates
and hire the cheaper "postdocs" to keep

down the costs of their projects.
While the University recognized
months ago that tuition remission would
end, the initial version of the new regula
tions was unclear about the transition pe
riod — something that appears to have
been at least partially cleared up with the
new wording.
"We are pleased that tuition remission
was put off until 1997, but we are con
cerned that the final language may be
problematic," Van Etten said. "We have to
determine how to handle grants that may
run beyond fiscal year 1998."
Stanford continues to study the impact
of ending tuition remission, and, although
initial estimates had placed the potential
cost at up to $12 million while jeopardiz
ing the status of up to 25 percent of grad
uate students, more recent analyses sug
gest that the ultimate effect will not be


Van Etten
that bad.
One of the first tasks now facing
Dean of Research Charles Kruger,
who assumed his position at the
beginning of this month, is finding

the most equitable solution to the
ending of tuition remission.
Van Etten said he expected
that the University and the Office
of Naval Research — the govern
ment agency responsible for over
seeing Stanford's indirect-cost
reimbursement — will need to
discuss how to interpret the new
rules before they take effect.
