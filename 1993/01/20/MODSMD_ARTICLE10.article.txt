# 'The great business success story'
## Microsoft mogul 
### Judy Hsu Staff writer 
After spending a total of 24
hours interviewing Microsoft
founder Bill Gates, Stephen
Manes has a pretty good idea of
what the man is like.
"There are two great myths
about Bill Gates," Manes said.
"One is that he's a nerd and the
other is that he's not a nerd."
"Both of those myths are
true," says Manes.
Manes and Paul Andrews are
co-authors of a new book —
"Gates: How Microsoft Mogul
Reinvented an Industry and Made
Himself the Richest Man in Amer
ica." The two signed first-edition
copies of their book at the Book
store yesterday afternoon, on the
date of its official publication.
After discovering that there
haven't been any books about
Gates or Microsoft since about
1985, they decided to write "the
great business success story" of
the decade, said Manes.
"It's a story that has never
been told fully and accurately,"
Andrews said. In the book, "we
broke down the process of how
the company and how the busi
ness got built through Gates'
vision."
Originally Microsoft would not
cooperate, the authors said. But
after three months of doing their
"homework," and after the com
pany realized that the authors

weren't "asking about Bill's dan
druff or anything," Manes said
Microsoft changed its mind.
The authors got access to
Gates and other information from
Microsoft in late 1991.
The mogul recently donated $6
million to the University's com
puter science department. "He
likes the idea of being recognized
as a technologist and a scientist,"
Andrews said.
"He's been really successful as
a businessman," Andrews added,
"but we think he's going to end
up using his fortune in research,
particularly in science and tech
nology."
The new book explains in
detail "how one of the nation's
great business geniuses built the
business and how the PC revolu
tion changed America,"he said.
It also paints a "picture of how
Microsoft works," Andrews said.
This includes the corporation's
eclectic interviewing process in
which the company flies students
out to one of its "campuses" and
proceeds with its day-long inter
views in an attempt to discover
how their minds work.
Gates' story is "a challenge to
students anywhere," said Manes.
He never finished school — he
dropped out of Harvard — yet he
is one of the most successful peo
ple in America today, he added.
The book has reached the best
seller list in Seattle, San Francis
co and L.A., Andrews said.
