FBI director reprimanded
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Depart
ment reprimanded FBI Director William S. Ses
sions for "taking advantage of the government"
for extensive personal travel and ordered him to
reimburse the Treasury, according to documents
released yesterday.
A report by the agency's Office of Professional
Responsibility said it found a widespread pattern
of misconduct that was "inconsistent with that
expected of the head of the nation's premier law
enforcement agency."
Before he left office last week, former Attorney
General William P. Barr sternly rebuked Sessions
in a letter for repeatedly using FBI aircraft for
personal trips and justifying billing the govern
ment by arranging to attend functions of "trivial,
if any, value to the government."
Barr's letter said he was "most troubled" by
Sessions' effort to avoid paying taxes on the use of
a government-supplied limousine that takes him
to and from work.
Former Czech nations join U.N.
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Czech
Republic and Slovakia became the newest U.N.
members yesterday, 19 days after Czechoslovakia
peacefully divided into two nations.
"On this solemn day we have entered a new
stage in the history of Slovakia," Milan Knazko,
the Slovak foreign minister, told the General
Assembly after it inducted the two new nations as
members by acclamation.
"The Czech Republic as a new member state of
the United Nations. . . will try to contribute its
modest share to the principles of human rights
and freedoms which form the backbone of its
domestic and foreign policy," said Czech Foreign
Minister Josef Zieleniec.
Kodak to cut 2,000 jobs
ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) — Eastman Kodak
Co. will cut about 2,000 jobs as part of a plan to
trim costs by more than $200 million a year, the
company said yesterday.
Kodak has been under pressure from Wall
Street and shareholders to improve its balance
sheet because for five years earnings have fallen
although sales have increased.
Most of the new cuts will come in the
Rochester operations of Kodak's imaging group,
said Kay R. Whitmore, chief executive officer.
Savings from the job cuts and other reductions
will lower net costs by more than $200 million a
year, Whitmore said.
