Sen. Jesse Helms of North Caroli
na, the ranking Republican on the

of the questions."

Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.1., the
panel's chairman, pointed out that

He was the board's president from
1985-88.
Christopher is also a graduate of
Stanford Law School.
He served as deputy secretary of
state in the Carter administration
and deputy attorney general in Lyn
don Johnson's administration.

In addition to Christopher, six
other Clinton Cabinet nominees
cleared committees yesterday and
Senate leaders made plans to confirm
at least a few key officials within hours
of today's presidential inauguration.

for Donna Shalala to head the Health
and Human Services Department,
Richard Riley as education secretary,
Robert Reich as labor secretary, Rep.
Mike Espy, D-Miss., as agriculture
secretary, Hazel O'Leary as energy
secretary and Mickey Kantor to
become U.S. trade representative.
In addition, Carol Browner was
cleared for Environmental Protection
Agency administrator and Roger Alt
man was approved as deputy secre
tary of the Treasury, a position below
Cabinet level.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen

was approved previously by the Finance

Defense Secretary-designate Les Aspin
was slated for today.
Officials said final details on the
appointees to be confirmed by the full
Senate on today were still being sort
ed out.
Others named to the Clinton Cabi
net faced confirmation hearings Tues
day, including Bruce Babbitt, named
to head the Interior Department;
Hazel O'Leary, tapped for energy sec
retary; and Zoe Baird, who apologized
before the Senate Judiciary Commit
tee for having hired two illegal aliens
to work in her home.
"It was a violation of the law," Baird
told the panel, which still appeared
inclined to approve her nomination.
"Our decision to hire the couple was
wrong, and I deeply regret it."
