# Iraq to allow inspections; cease-fires also proposed
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Easing the
crisis with Iraq on one front, the United
Nations yesterday accepted an Iraqi offer
to let weapons inspection flights resume
without conditions, an official said.
Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, the world body's
top weapons inspector, said an uncondi
tional Iraqi offer on resuming the flights
"should be taken seriously." The flights
have been delayed for two weeks.
"We will restart our flights as soon as
the commission deems it feasible," said
Ekeus, the executive chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction under terms of resolutions
that ended the Persian Gulf War.
Baghdad also offered yesterday a cease
fire in two "no-fly" zones. Ekeus said he
had received a communique explaining
the Iraqi initiatives, and had discussed
them with Iraq's ambassador, Nizar
Hamdoon.
The allies have hit Iraq with air strikes
and U.S. cruise missiles for a week to
force Baghdad to cooperate with the U.N.
weapons inspectors and keep its planes

and radar out of "no-fly zones" in north
ern and southern Iraq.
Yesterday, Iraq made the two offers,
apparently on condition that United
States, Britain and France halt the
attacks.
In Baghdad, Iraq's ruling Revolution
ary Command Council, headed by Presi
dent Saddam Hussein, said there would
be no more attacks on U.S., French or
British planes in the no-fly zones because
of the inauguration tomorrow of Presi
dent-elect Clinton.
The Security Council also planned to
discuss Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali's plan to send 3,650 armed
peacekeepers to the Iraq-Kuwait border
to guard against further Iraqi raids.
Iraq has refused to recognize the new
border mapped by the U. N., and still
claims sovereignty over all of Kuwait.
The new, infantry-based force would
replace the current 350-man military
observer mission, Boutros-Ghali said. The
observer mission began in April 1991
after the Council adopted the formal
cease-fire ending the Gulf War.
