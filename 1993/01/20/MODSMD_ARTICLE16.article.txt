# Law barring Israeli talks with PLO lifted
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - In
what could be a boost to Middle
East peace talks, lawmakers
yesterday abolished a 7-year
old law barring Israelis from
meeting with members of the
PLO.
The 39-20 vote in the 120-
member Parliament followed
four hours of debate in which
the right-wing opposition vain
ly tried to water down the gov
ernment bill.
But Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin opposed such contacts
and it was not clear if he would
resist the decision.
Yesterday's vote annulled a
1986 amendment to Israel's
anti-terror law which barred
Israelis from meeting with
members of terror organiza
tions. Israel classifies the PLO
as such a group.
In Tunis, Tunisia, the PLO
welcomed the decision and also

appealed to President-elect Clin
ton to restore contacts with the
organization.
PLO spokesman Bassam
Abu-Sharif praised the vote as
"a new, real and serious step
towards establishing a just and
comprehensive peace in the
region."
He renewed a call to Israeli
Foreign Minister Shimon
Perez to meet with PLO offi
cials with a view to preparing a
"summit" between PLO chair
man Yasser Arafat and Rabin.
The vote could help Israel in
its effort to stem the rising
influence of Muslim fundamen
talists, who oppose peace talks
and vie with the PLO to lead
Arabs in the occupied territory.
Liberal legislator Dedi Zuck
er said he expected the vote
would help "create a better
atmosphere for the peace
talks."
