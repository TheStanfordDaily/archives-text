Student input could
help translate conduct
policy into English

WHILE THE UNIVERSITY
seems to be making a good
faith effort to address
women's needs on campus — by
releasing the Women's Needs
Assessment last month and contin
uing to revise drafts of an "unac
ceptable sexual conduct policy" —
even the best-laid plans can go
astray when students don't have
enough say in University policy.
For the past two years, the Uni
versity has been drafting (and re
drafting, and re-drafting) a policy
on unacceptable sexual conduct
that addresses the continuum of
sexual misconduct and combines
the existing sexual assault policy
(adopted last January) and a
revised sexual harassment policy.
Last week, the latest draft of the
policy was presented to the Uni
versity Cabinet, but approval was
delayed until at least March pend
ing some revisions and more stu
dent input. And by the looks of the
policy, some outside comments are
precisely what is needed to turn it
into a user-friendly document.
Cumbersome and complicated,
the proposed policy is somewhat dif
ficult to decode. In all, the combined
policies comprise an overwhelming
21 pages. Additional recommenda
tions bring the total to 38.
But for all that information, some
questions Eire still unanswered.
For several years the Universi
ty's sexual harassment policy and
grievance procedures have been
criticized because they fall far
short of user-friendly. The campus
lacks a single, visible person or
group to turn to with sexual
harassment complaints, and stu
dents lack confidence in the sys
tem's ability to meet their needs.
Unfortunately, the policy that
was presented to the cabinet for

review did little to clean things up.
While the policy states in many
explicit terms just what kinds of
behavior are considered unaccept
able, it provides little in the way of
real solutions to the real problems
real students face.
When contemplating how to deal
with an incident of harassment,
most students want to know the
basics: Who should I report the
incident to? How do I know my
harasser (who might just happen to
be my adviser) won't blacklist me?
These issues seem to be given
only peripheral treatment — for
instance, retribution is mentioned in
the policy, but the two sentences it is
allotted do not convincingly display
an understanding of how important
this issue is to students who might
consider reporting incidents.
Also, the policy refers students
who want to file "formal" com
plaints to the "Student Academic
Grievance Procedure," but no one
besides University administrators
has the foggiest idea where to find
the "University Bulletin" it's list
ed in (It's sent home along with
Courses and Degrees each fall.).
Once located, it's confusing and
far from concise.
In addition, the work group's best
recommendation — to create a panel
specialized in dealing with com
plaints of sexual harassment — was
left out of the revised policy, and
included only as a "recommenda
tion." But without such a panel, the
most substantive complaints of
many students remain unaddressed.
Last year, the work group writ
ing the policy came under fire for
excluding students from their
efforts. Last week, right before a
draft of the completed policy was
presented to the cabinet, the ASSU
objected to it on similar grounds.
Judging by the Cabinet's
response to the policy — "We just
wished it would be — better," said
Provost Gerald Lieberman — the
Work Group would do well to heed
the ASSU's advice and allow the stu
dents whom this policy will affect
have some more say in what it says.
And while you're at it, hurry up.
