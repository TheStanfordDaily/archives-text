## Purloined pieces prompt pricey punishments 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
A rash of furniture thefts during winter break has
prompted the University to crack down on offenders
in an effort to prevent future incidents.
"We found furniture from Manzanita and Kimball
in fraternities and on the Row in students' rooms,"
said Rodger Whitney, the director of Student Hous
ing Operations, who described the situation as "out
and out theft."
"We know of at least eight students who were in
volved in taking furniture before or during winter
break," Whitney said. "We are taking the students in
front of a judicial board for violating the Fundamen
tal Standard and filing a report with the police."
Some of the stolen pieces of furniture showed up at
the Kappa Alpha house. But KA president Mark Ab

bott said the fraternity is not to blame.
"What we want to emphasize is that a few people
in the house got way out of line," he said. "They are
being punished within the house.
"The University is making it out to be a KA event,"
Abbott added.
Whitney, however, emphasized that there were
other incidents. "This is not just a fraternity prob
lem," he said.
The thefts are not a new occurrence, Whitney said.
"Usually it comes and goes in cycles, but this year
there were more thefts than usual."
In addition to students who remove furniture
from other residences, Students found moving furni
ture from their dormitory lounges to private rooms
will be punished, according to Whitney.
