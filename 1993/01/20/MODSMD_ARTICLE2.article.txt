# Been caught stealing?
## Purloined pieces prompt pricey punishments 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
A rash of furniture thefts during winter break has
prompted the University to crack down on offenders
in an effort to prevent future incidents.
"We found furniture from Manzanita and Kimball
in fraternities and on the Row in students' rooms,"
said Rodger Whitney, the director of Student Hous
ing Operations, who described the situation as "out
and out theft."
"We know of at least eight students who were in
volved in taking furniture before or during winter
break," Whitney said. "We are taking the students in
front of a judicial board for violating the Fundamen
tal Standard and filing a report with the police."
Some of the stolen pieces of furniture showed up at
the Kappa Alpha house. But KA president Mark Ab

bott said the fraternity is not to blame.
"What we want to emphasize is that a few people
in the house got way out of line," he said. "They are
being punished within the house.
"The University is making it out to be a KA event,"
Abbott added.
Whitney, however, emphasized that there were
other incidents. "This is not just a fraternity prob
lem," he said.
The thefts are not a new occurrence, Whitney said.
"Usually it comes and goes in cycles, but this year
there were more thefts than usual."
In addition to students who remove furniture
from other residences, Students found moving furni
ture from their dormitory lounges to private rooms
will be punished, according to Whitney.
"Taking furniture from a com
mon area to a student's room is
illegal. From now on, we are going
to call the police and follow up on
these thefts whenever and wher
ever they occur," he said.
"When we put furniture in a
house, we expect it to stay in com
mon areas where all of the resi
dents can use it. Every Stanford
student pays for replacement of
this furniture when it is stolen."
A $200 fine will now be enforced

when missing furniture is found in
student rooms, he said. Also,
appropriate judicial action will be
taken through the University.
This year, there were problems
with repair and maintenance
employees leaving buildings open
during winter break because of
their need to enter and leave, he
said. "Also, people stayed too long
and were still in the buildings
after break officially began."
The University is currently
looking for ways to better address
these issues, he said. "Security
patrolling of the buildings and
finding better ways to close the
buildings are possible options."
