## Remembering my father 
### 
Last Monday was my dad's 58th
birthday. This date has become a
sad one in my family, as we count
another year spent without him. I
remember so vividly how my freshman
year I mailed him a Mr. Coffee Iced Tea
Maker from the mall. He loved it. Ten
days later I lost him.
I think of him when I wear one of the
countless neckties he left behind and
laugh at some of the truly ugly ones we
bought him over the years. I convince
myself that it is not disrespectful to wear
his ties because he wouldn't have had it
any other way.
Eveiy time one of us would dress up, he
would scan our clothing, adjust whatever
tie we had chosen and say "I have a tie
that would be perfect for that outfit. It's in
my closet, just don't ruin it." How many
times we replayed that scene I can't guess.
The newspaper clippings tried to give a
broad picture of his life and accomplish
ments, yet all fell so short. Maybe, though,
the things that shine for me are the ones
no paper could know.
He took so much pride in his children.
He wanted each of us to be the best we
could and he provided us all with the
means to do it — be it a math tutor or
hockey camp. He wanted us to excel. He
wanted us to want to excel.
I played four years of high school foot
ball and was confident that I could play
quarterback. He searched the city for the

exact football I would be using, eventually
ordering one from the Spalding factory in
Cincinnati. He paid for a football coach to
give me some private lessons. How he
must have loved to watch me learn and
how it must have pained him to see me
give it only a half-hearted effort.
He came to almost every game — to
almost any event his children were in. He
loved to watch them compete, to strive
towards a personal goal. In pouring rain,
with a smoldering cigar in his mouth he
would stalk the sidelines yelling encourage
ment and instruction. "Stay low, Tommy"
or "They're coming your way, Tom" could
be heard before every snap of the ball.
Sometimes, at the most random times
and places, he comes up in conversation,
even here in Stanford, Calif., 2,000 miles
away from where he earned his reputation
and spent his final years.
I was at a small room party when I met
a guy who had lived briefly in Milwaukee.
As we did our traditional small talk rou
tine he suddenly told me that Dad had per
formed open-heart surgery on his grandfa
ther 15 years earlier.
I've heard this from many different
people and have always greeted it with a
sort of well-isn't-that-neat attitude. This
guy, though, thanked me for my dad. You
see, Dad had given him a chance to know
his grandfather. Here was a college stu
dent at a party thanking me for my dad's
talent.

I thanked him, a little uncomfortable at
what to say, and thought something along
the lines of "all in a day's work." But in
reality, the years he added onto thousands
of lives are his true legacy.
The one thought that pains me the
most is that I will never get to show him
what I have learned and what I can do. He
won't be at my graduation. I can't call to
tell him about the football game, good
grades or professor's comments. I've tried
to pattern myself after him, but it hurts to
know he won't be here to see me grow and
mature — hopefully in his likeness.
It was very hard to choose Stanford over
Amherst. His alma mater was very impor
tant to him and I'm sure he would have
loved for me to follow him there. But then,
I know he recognized the merits of this
place. He probably relished being able to
send me to the best school in the country.
One day, as I lamented the fact that he
never saw Stanford, one of my best friends
assured me that he can see it now. I pray
he can. I hope he likes what he sees.

Tom Flemma's column will appear here
once more — at which time he will return
to the oblivion of anonymity from whence
he came.
