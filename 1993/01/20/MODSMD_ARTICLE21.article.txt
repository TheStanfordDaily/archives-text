Interviewee apologizes
for thoughtless quotes;
did not mean to offend
I would like to apologize for my com
ments in the article, "Techie double
standards," in the Dec. 4 issue of The
Daily.
At the time, I did not fully under
stand the importance and sensitivity
surrounding the issue of women in the
sciences.
As a result, I spoke in a very casual
and thoughtless manner. I phrased my
ideas poorly and made under-qualified
statements.
I realize that I have offended many
people, and for that I apologize. Though
my quotes seem to indicate otherwise, I
do not believe that women are less intel
ligent than men, nor that women cannot
excel as scientists.
In fact, I would be extremely happy to
see more women in my engineering
classes. I have responded to the specific

concerns of certain students who e
mailed me, and I encourage anyone who
would like a more detailed explanation
to e-mail me as well.
College, they say, is a period of learn
ing, and although the article consumed
much of my already too scarce time and
energy, I have learned a great deal from
this event.

Columnist neglects his
duty to readers; sexism
encouraged by his work
When I first read Pete Huyck's col
umn in the Dec. 4 issue of The Daily, I
was very upset.
I thought the column about poems he
submitted to the G-Spot was stupid and
offensive, but I told myself it was just a
space-filler for an ignorant columnist
who had run out of good ideas that
week, and tried to ignore it.

A month and two indignant columns
later, I've convinced myself that I don't
need to invalidate my feelings any
longer — Pete Huyck is simply dead
wrong, and seems bent on proving that
(a la Keith Rabois) to the entire Stan
ford community.
Huyck's three columns show a real
insensitivity to women and women's
issues. Although his views could be
overlooked in the name of humor, it is
the humorous tone that concerns me.
Maybe Huyck is neither a misogynist
nor sexist — when joking around, one
never knows for sure — but his readers
could be.
Huyck may take his role as a colum
nist lightly — he may not understand
that many, many people read his
columns and validate thur own feelings
with his words.
Instead of using his influence and
position as a writer to help make the
world a better place, Huyck is wasting
column space with bad jokes.
Objectifying people by reducing them
to body parts makes it much easier for a
perpetrator of a sexual crime to rational

ize his actions.
Granted, Huyck's columns aren't the
reason that the already extremely high
number of violent crimes against women
keeps rising — but by writing an article
that so obviously could be interpreted
"the wrong way," Huyck certainly isn't
doing anything worthwhile to stop the
existing problems.
I personally feel that one sexually
obsessed columnist who jokes about
women in an objectifying way is too
much for any publication.
However, Joel Stein usually clarifies
his meanings by the end of his articles
so that the sexist, misogynist readers
in his audience are not reassured by
his words. Stein's humor seems natu
ral and witty in print, and above that,
he writes well.
Pete Huyck is no Joel Stein.
The responsibility to those readers
out there who are seeking confirmation
from a columnist for The Stanford Daily
is a big weight to carry. But is one not
so-amusing article worth it?
