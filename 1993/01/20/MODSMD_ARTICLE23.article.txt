## Project tests effect of future atmosphere on native plants What will happen to Jasper Ridge? 
### Ceara McNiff Staff writer 
A team of scientists working at Stan
ford's Jasper Ridge is examining the pos
sible effects that increased atmospheric
carbon dioxide levels will have on local
plant populations.
The five-year study, sponsored by the
National Science Foundation, will deter
mine whether already-detected increases
in atmospheric carbon dioxide are affect
ing plant growth, and what these effects
might mean for the native plant commu
nities around Stanford and around the
world, said Nona Chiariello, a Stanford
research associate involved in the pro
ject. She is working with Biology Prof.

Harold Mooney, of four principal
investigators of the project.
In the enigmatic global warming puz
zle, plants constitute a key variable,
because of their role in exchanging car
bon dioxide with oxygen.
Carbon dioxide affects plants in two
ways. Since plants require the compound
to photosynthesize, some scientists have
hypothesized that increased carbon diox
ide levels will mean better plant growth
and higher crop yields. This anticipated
'benefit' of global warming has been
much debated, however.
Carbon dioxide concentrations also
affect the water usage of certain plants,
because the uptake of the gas and the
transpiration of water occur through the

same pores on the underside of the
plants' leaves. In the presence of excess
carbon dioxide, the pores become small
er, and less water is lost by the plant,
making it more water efficient. "At this
point we don't know how characteristic a
response this is" in native plants at
Jasper Ridge, Chiariello said.
These different feedback mechanisms
make it unclear what the overall effect
on plant growth would be. However, two
hypothesis exist.
One possibility is that in the presence
of more carbon dioxide plants will fix
more carbon into their structures. If this
occurs, Chiariello said, the plants will
decompose more slowly, and it will take
longer for nutrients to be released back
into the soil. With fewer nutrients in the
soil, the ratio of hardy native plants to
non-native plants might increase, but
the total number of plants in a given area
would probably decrease.
The other possibility is that all plants
are limited more by the lack of nutri
ents in the serpentine soil, and that
altering the atmosphere will have no
effect at all.
While past studies have looked at this
same question of whether increased car
bon dioxide affects plant growth,
Chiariello said, the Jasper Ridge study
differs in two main respects.
Most past studies have investigated
plants growing only in greenhouses
where the soil is very nutrient-rich, con
ditions unlike those around Stanford.
Instead, the Jasper Ridge study repli
cates environmental stresses such as
poor soil quality and low rainfall.
The second difference is that past
studies have mostly looked at perennial
plants which show increased growth
mainly in development of underground
tap roots. By studying annuals (plants
that die each year) instead, Chiariello
said, the scientists at Jasper Ridge hope
to be able to detect above ground changes
in plant growth without digging the
plant up and killing it.
Researchers hope the five year time
span of the study will allow them to see
how the relative numbers of the differ
ent species change in the plant commu
nities.
The researchers are conducting two
different experiments at Jasper Ridge.

The first is a series of soil plots enclosed
in futuristic-looking plastic bubbles.
Inside the bubbles, the plants grow in
plots in which scientists have controlled
soil conditions and carbon dioxide levels,
and have eliminated wind, contamina
tion by foreign species and pollination.
Only rainwater remains uncontrolled.
Each bubble connects to a huge,
refrigerated carbon dioxide tank which
blows gas into each plot. Half the plots
receive normal carbon dioxide levels,
while half receive twice the atmospheric
concentration, a change that creates the
atmosphere projected for a century in
the future.
In these controlled conditions,
researchers are studying eight species of
plants — six native and two non-native.
They are growing them both in isolated
plots and in communities.
The pots contain stratified serpentine
soils which replicate local conditions.
Half the plants also receive time-release
fertilizers in an attempt to determine the
role of nutrients in carbon dioxide's
effect on plants.
The second experiment at Jasper
Ridge uses actual field plots where atmo
spheric carbon dioxide is again con
trolled. Because the experiments use the

natural soil conditions, however, creat
ing much more variability, the field
experiments will be repeated 10 times.
In both experiments scientists use
many different measurements to deter
mine the effects of carbon dioxide. They
examine leaf-level physiology to find the
carbon content fixed in the plant tissues.
Scientists monitor the amount of water
and nutrients the plants use, as well.
In addition, scientists measure the
amount of biomass the plants produce,
and they look at how the plant popula
tions change in relative abundances over
time.
So far, the results of the study are
tentative.
In the field over the past year, doubled
carbon dioxide levels did not produce an
increase in living plant mass. However,
the amount of dead and decaying plant
matter increased slightly.
Chiariello said this result may be an
experimental error. If the result is valid,
it may be caused by a faster turnover in
the living plants, or because the dead
biomass is not decomposing as quickly.
Anyway, the change has been "very sub
tle," she said.
It will take a few years to get definate
results.

in futuristic-looking plastic bubbles.
Inside the bubbles, the plants grow in
plots in which scientists have controlled
soil conditions and carbon dioxide levels,
and have eliminated wind, contamina
tion by foreign species and pollination.
Only rainwater remains uncontrolled.
Each bubble connects to a huge,
refrigerated carbon dioxide tank which
blows gas into each plot. Half the plots
receive normal carbon dioxide levels,
while half receive twice the atmospheric
concentration, a change that creates the
atmosphere projected for a century in
the future.
In these controlled conditions,
researchers are studying eight species of
plants — six native and two non-native.
They are growing them both in isolated
plots and in communities.
The pots contain stratified serpentine
soils which replicate local conditions.
Half the plants also receive time-release
fertilizers in an attempt to determine the
role of nutrients in carbon dioxide's
effect on plants.
The second experiment at Jasper
Ridge uses actual field plots where atmo
spheric carbon dioxide is again con
trolled. Because the experiments use the

natural soil conditions, however, creat
ing much more variability, the field
experiments will be repeated 10 times.
In both experiments scientists use
many different measurements to deter
mine the effects of carbon dioxide. They
examine leaf-level physiology to find the
carbon content fixed in the plant tissues.
Scientists monitor the amount of water
and nutrients the plants use, as well.
In addition, scientists measure the
amount of biomass the plants produce,
and they look at how the plant popula
tions change in relative abundances over
time.
So far, the results of the study are
tentative.
In the field over the past year, doubled
carbon dioxide levels did not produce an
increase in living plant mass. However,
the amount of dead and decaying plant
matter increased slightly.
Chiariello said this result may be an
experimental error. If the result is valid,
it may be caused by a faster turnover in
the living plants, or because the dead
biomass is not decomposing as quickly.
Anyway, the change has been "very sub
tle," she said.
It will take a few years to get definate
results.

plants will grow two feet. Some plots contain a single species, while larger plots
contain communities of species.

A team of scientists working at Stan
ford's Jasper Ridge is examining the pos
sible effects that increased atmospheric
carbon dioxide levels will have on local
plant populations.
The five-year study, sponsored by the
National Science Foundation, will deter
mine whether already-detected increases
in atmospheric carbon dioxide are affect
ing plant growth, and what these effects
might mean for the native plant commu
nities around Stanford and around the
world, said Nona Chiariello, a Stanford
research associate involved in the pro
ject. She is working with Biology Prof.

Harold Mooney, of four principal
investigators of the project.
In the enigmatic global warming puz
zle, plants constitute a key variable,
because of their role in exchanging car
bon dioxide with oxygen.
Carbon dioxide affects plants in two
ways. Since plants require the compound
to photosynthesize, some scientists have
hypothesized that increased carbon diox
ide levels will mean better plant growth
and higher crop yields. This anticipated
'benefit' of global warming has been
much debated, however.
Carbon dioxide concentrations also
affect the water usage of certain plants,
because the uptake of the gas and the
transpiration of water occur through the

same pores on the underside of the
plants' leaves. In the presence of excess
carbon dioxide, the pores become small
er, and less water is lost by the plant,
making it more water efficient. "At this
point we don't know how characteristic a
response this is" in native plants at
Jasper Ridge, Chiariello said.
These different feedback mechanisms
make it unclear what the overall effect
on plant growth would be. However, two
hypothesis exist.
One possibility is that in the presence
of more carbon dioxide plants will fix
more carbon into their structures. If this
occurs, Chiariello said, the plants will
decompose more slowly, and it will take
longer for nutrients to be released back
into the soil. With fewer nutrients in the
soil, the ratio of hardy native plants to
non-native plants might increase, but
the total number of plants in a given area
would probably decrease.
The other possibility is that all plants
are limited more by the lack of nutri
ents in the serpentine soil, and that
altering the atmosphere will have no
effect at all.
While past studies have looked at this
same question of whether increased car
bon dioxide affects plant growth,
Chiariello said, the Jasper Ridge study
differs in two main respects.
Most past studies have investigated
plants growing only in greenhouses
where the soil is very nutrient-rich, con
ditions unlike those around Stanford.
Instead, the Jasper Ridge study repli
cates environmental stresses such as
poor soil quality and low rainfall.
The second difference is that past
studies have mostly looked at perennial
plants which show increased growth
mainly in development of underground
tap roots. By studying annuals (plants
that die each year) instead, Chiariello
said, the scientists at Jasper Ridge hope
to be able to detect above ground changes
in plant growth without digging the
plant up and killing it.
Researchers hope the five year time
span of the study will allow them to see
how the relative numbers of the differ
ent species change in the plant commu
nities.
The researchers are conducting two
