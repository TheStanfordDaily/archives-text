# Grungy? How to get really clean
## 
### Chris Patil Staff writer 
Somewhere between the helpless, doomed inver
tebrates in my laboratory and the chaotic jumble
that I call my room, I lost the original version of this
week's question. Consequently, with apologies to
the kind reader who posed the question in the first
place, I must paraphrase.
Despite the fact that the query is not verbatim
from a reader, I would like to remind my public that
every question answered in this column, however
ridiculous or extreme, is a bona fide question posed
by a member of the Stanford community.
So, without further use of Latin words, here
goes:
I noticed that a bodywash I use contains
nonoxynol-9 as its sixth ingredient. Isn't this
substance a spermicide? If so, what is it doing in my
bodywash ?
— I can't remember the the name
A : Your question reminds me of a parable about a
xxband of old, blind sages that encountered an ele
phant. The wise men quickly set about trying to
identify the object before them by stroking its
respective parts.
One of the sages touched the elephant's legs, and
decided that the animal was a tree. Another member
of the band contacted its broad side, and concluded
that he was facing a wall. Three of the sages insisted
that they were examining a hanging jungle vine.
The moral of the story is, of course, that an object
can have several mutually compatible identities.
Nonoxynol-9, or "nonylphenoxypolyethoxye
thanol" for short, is indeed a spermicide of some
repute. In fact, most vaginal spermicides manufac
tured in the U.S. employ nonoxynol-9 or a closely
related molecule, octoxynol-9, as their active ingre
dient.
Its concentration varies between applications:
The more solid creams and gels use about 2-5 per
cent nonoxynol-9, whereas contraceptive foams —
in addition to using CFC foaming agents that are
bad for the environment — contain as much as 12
percent.
Meaningless statistics aside, a quick trip to any
drugstore reveals the shocking fact that nonoxynol
-9 is also found in a number of other personal
hygiene products, ranging from the bodywash men
tioned in the question to several popular hand
lotions, a couple of liquid soaps and even a medicat
ed shampoo.
Upon making this discovery, it occurred to me

that unless one is involved in truly alternative sexu
al behavior, one needs no spermicide in these beau
ty products. Ergo, I reasoned, nonoxynol-9 must
serve some other function in these cases. But what?
Calling the 1-800 numbers on the bottles and jars
under investigation in an attempt to procure an
answer proved singularly useless. But after learning
a bit about the spermicidal action of this versatile
chemical, it was possible to make a reasonable guess
about its utility in other realms of hygiene.
Nonoxynol-9 is a non-ionic surfactant, which is
basically a glorified name for a detergent. In cell and
molecular biology labs, non-ionic detergents are
used to disrupt the membranes that surround and
enclose cells. Needless to say, such treatment is
often detrimental to the cells in question, and fre
quently results in their demise.
Nonoxynol-9's spermicidal action comes from
this molecular activity. A sperm which encounters a
region of high surfactant concentration will sudden
ly find himself with massive degradation of the
membrane which encapsulates his head. This dis
ruption of the cell membrane makes the sperm non
viable.
A similar fate awaits any microorganism who
might try to hitch a ride in the ejaculatory fluid.
Their cell membranes are made of more or less the
same kind of stuff as the membranes of our sex cells,
and are therefore susceptible to the ravages of
non-ionic detergents.
One might predict from this that women who use
contraceptive foams and jellies would be at a lower
risk for such STDs as gonorrhea and chlamydia, and
one would be right.
(The cells of the woman's reproductive tract are
protected from damage by the thick, jelly-like mucus
secreted by epithelial cells that line the walls of the
system.)
So, nonoxynol-9 isn't just a spermicide — it's a
general antibacterial agent as well. In fact, one could
consider its contraceptive function as a special case
of its more widespread anti-biological activity.
This explains its presence in bodywashes and
hand soaps. It's nice to have a gentle antibacterial
agent in your cleaning products to kill all the nasty
little bugs that one encounters in everyday life.
So, when you next have that not-so-fresh feeling,
or just want to get your hands really, really clean,
try nonoxynol-9.
Not just for breakfast anymore.
