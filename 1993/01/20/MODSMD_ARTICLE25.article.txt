## Montgomery looks for cure as ailing hoops heads to L.A. Loss of Allaway leaves Cardinal short as UCLA, USC await 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
As the Stanford basketball team pre
pares to head to Los Angeles minus the
services of yet another player, coach
Mike Montgomery is looking every
where he can to find saving graces for
his squad.
"I spend about 24 hours a day think
ing about something I can do to make
us effective," Montgomery said. "But
when the questions get to 'How can I
post-up Nick Ravn, well ..
A lot of extra thought had to go into
preparation for games against No. 23
UCLA tomorrow night and USC Sat
urday given the injury suffered by
starting freshman forward Darren All
away.
"We need Darren back," Mont
gomery said. "He's our most athletic
post guy and fre has the strength to
[muscle] inside. That was not the guy
we needed to lose at this point."
The loss of Allaway leaves Mont
gomery with the services of only four
inside players — Jim Morgan, Bart
Lammersen, Todd Manley and Justin
Armour — and even Manley's status is
not certain. The sophomore forward did
not practice Monday because he hyper
extended his knee, but did practice yes
terday.
Stanford's limited roster could result
in potential matchup problems, espe
cially inside. On Thursday, Lammersen
will have to defend against UCLA's 6-
foot-8 Ed O'Bannon, who is averaging
18.-4 points.
"O'Bannon is an athlete who can

ball well, consistently,
take care of the basket
ball and get back In tran
sition. If we do those
things, we'll be in a posi
tion to win. But there are
some giames we might
not be able to win even if
we play at 100 percent of
our capability.'

rebound, yet he can also run the floor,"
Montgomery said.
A difference between this year's
UCLA squad and those of the recent
past is that the Bruins have a legiti
mate threat at center in the form of 6-
foot-10 senior Richard Petruska, and
the Bruins have adjusted their style
accordingly.
"They're playing differently — they
are looking more to establish the low
post game with Petruska when last
year they had (Tracy) Murray and
(Don) Mac Lean outside," Montgomery
said.
But the customary Bruin transition

game is still dangerous. Guard Tyus
Ednoy is averaging 6.1 assists and has
been very effective at pushing the ball
for UCLA.
As for the Trojans, Stanford will face
a different set of problematic circum
stances. USC starts a three-guard line
up, and looks to quicken the tempo of
the game at all times.
"They are very athletic," Mont
gomery said. "They play small, but
there is no advantage for us in being
bigger" because of their team speed.
USC coach George Raveling has stat
ed that his team will "live and die" by
the three-point shot.
So far, the Trojans are living quite
nicely. They are averaging 9.3 suc
cessful three-pointers a game, and
are shooting 38.9 percent from three
dom.
"They may not have a marquee play
er like Harold Miner, but George (Rav
eling) has done a real nice job utilizing
his personnel and setting up the three
point shots," Montgomery said.
Freshman Burt Harris has solved
USC's preseason dilemma at point
guard, and ranks third in the Pacific 10
Conference in assists.
Stanford will need to play superb
basketball on the trip south if it wishes
to improve upon its 6-9 record.
"We need to shoot the ball well, con
sistently, take care of the basketball
and get back in transition," Mont
gomery said. "If we do those things,
we'll be in a position to win. But there
are some games we might not be able to
win even if we play at 100 percent of our
capability."
