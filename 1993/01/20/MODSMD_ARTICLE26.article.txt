# 'Boys will collect overdue Bills
## 
### 
In a little less than two weeks
from now, the Super Bowl will
again be played on a Sunday
in late January to determine the
champion of the National Foot
ball League, and once again the
American Football Conference
will come up short.
It was a good thing that the
Bills enjoyed their stay in Miami,
because the plane flight that they
take home from Pasadena follow
ing Super Bowl XXVII will not
have the same joyous overtones.
Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly,
while professing great satisfaction
with his team's 29-10 victory in the
AFC Championship Game over the
Dolphins, unknowingly gave an
indication of things to come when
he stated, "It was the sweetest vic
tory I've ever been a part of."
In 1991, in perhaps the best
Super Bowl ever played, Buffalo
narrowly lost to the New York
Giants of the National Football
Conference's Eastern Division
20-19 in Tampa as Scott Nor
wood missed a 47-yard game
winning field goal with four sec
onds left.
Last year, the NFC East's
Washington Redskins were up to
the task, defeating Buffalo 37-24
in the Metrodome in Minneapolis.
And in 1993? Same story. A
third team from the NFC East,
the Dallas Cowboys, should send
Buffalo home a loser.
For Buffalo, it is amazing that

they are even in the Super Bowl. If
not for their NFL record 32-point
comeback against the Houston
Oilers in the wild card round of
the playoffs, the Bills would be sit
ting at home watching the Super
Bowl on television like almost
everyone else. Buffalo made it the
hard way, prevailing in three
straight playoff games (the last
two on the road) in convincing

fashion. Aside from the 41-38
overtime win against Houston,
the Bills easily brushed aside the
other two obstacles in their path
toward a Southern California win
ter vacation with a 24-3 victory
over Pittsburgh and then last
Sunday's win at Miami.
In order to beat the Cowboys,
backup quarterback Frank (Lloyd)
Reich, who engineered the display
at Houston, will have to design a
foolproof blueprint to win.
Buffalo is a good team, but Dal
las is a step ahead. The teams with
the two best records in football
faced off a few days ago in rain

soaked Candlestick Park, and they
were both in the same conference.
The Cowboys came away with a
30-20 victory over the 49ers, and
Buffalo will be easy pickings after
San Francisco.
Cowboy quarterback Troy Aik
man also has an intangible advan
tage: he is returning to play on »
what was once his home field. The *
Super Bowl will be played at the
Rose Bowl, where Aikman called
the signals in his college days for
two years as the quarterback at
UCLA.
After defeating Miami, the Bills
could not even enjoy the victory
before facing questions about los
ing again. Ironically, the Bills are
the only team other than Miami
to advance to three straight
Super Bowls. The difference is,
though, that Miami won it two
out of the three times they
advanced to the game.
At least the Bills will be able to
claim that they've been to the
Super Bowl. Many players never
even get there. It's probably better
to be at the party even if you don't
get the big present than to be
watching it from the outside.

David Schwartz is going to mingle
with the paparazzi this weekend at
the Sports Arena in Los Angeles.
0.K., maybe not the rich and
famous, but perhaps the USC cheer
leaders. Would you believe the hotel
room Spectravision?
