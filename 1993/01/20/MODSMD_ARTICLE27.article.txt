It looks as though even
geniuses can make mistakes.
On Monday, Syracuse Uni
versity filed a protest with the
Pacific 10 Conference over Stan
ford head football coach Bill
Walsh's recruitment of a Mas
sachusetts high school football
player.
However, the NCAA has
since determined that Stanford
gained no recruiting advantage
as a result of the incident, and
has let the football staff off with
a formal reprimand.
Walsh reportedly committed
a number of minor recruiting
violations in his recruitment of
Xaverian High star running
back Greg Cornelia. The protest
was filed after a press confer
ence during which Cornelia ver
bally committed to Stanford.
"I believe this was an honest
mistake by our football staff.
But it was a mistake neverthe
less," said Athletics Director
Ted Leland in a statement
released yesterday.
Apparently, at least three vio
lations were committed. NCAA
rules state that (l)a coach may
not be at a press conference
where a verbal commitment is

made to their college or univer
sity, (2) a coach may not be pho
tographed with a player during
the recruitment period, and (3)
a coach may not discuss the
player's future with them until
after the official national letter
of-intent signing day on Feb. 3.
"As is our policy, the incident
was self-reported to the Pacific
10 Conference and the NCAA
was notified immediately to
begin the review process,"
Leland said.

However, the NCAA ruled
yesterday that the mistakes
made were honest ones. Walsh
claimed that he had forgotten
specific recruiting procedures
since his last collegiate tour of
duty in 1978.
The NCAA looked favorably
on Stanford's prompt notifica
tion of the Pac-10 and the
NCAA after the violations
occurred.
As the violations were minor
and Stanford had no prior
record of rules violations, no
real punishments or restrictions
were imposed.
Boston College was also
reportedly investigating the sit
uation, according to Eagles Ath
letic Director Chet Gladchuk.
"We can't conduct business
like that and, as far as I know,
no one else in the NCAA does
either," Gladchuk said.
Both Boston College and
Syracuse had been heavily
recruiting Cornelia. But the vio
lations committed will have no
bearing on Cornelia and his
choice of collegiate attendance
for next year.
"(Cornelia's eligibility! has
been restored and he can sign a
national letter-of-intent with
Stanford University if he so
chooses," Leland said.
