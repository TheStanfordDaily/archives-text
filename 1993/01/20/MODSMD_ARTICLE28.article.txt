## 
### Brian Brennan Staff writer 
Stanford rugby opened league
play on a high note last Saturday,
as all three Cardinal teams posted
crushing victories over UC-Santa
Cruz. The Banana Slugs were
outmatched in all facets of the
game, and Stanford took full
advantage of its superior size and
speed.

"We throttled them, but we
made a lot of mistakes. It was a
good learning experience," said
Stanford captain Trevor Brown.
The Cardinal first squad came
out hard and scored two quick
tries, converting one of the kicks
for a 12-0 lead early. With changes
in scoring procedure going into
effect this year, a try is worth five
points, with the opportunity for a
two-point conversion following.
"It was a good first game," said

senior flanker Dan Byars, assess
ing the Cardinal effort. "The for
wards dominated the game, but we
need to work on our defense
against bigger, more physical
teams."
Tries by Emile Bruneau and
John Gerard pushed the score to
27-0 at halftime, but Santa Cruz
refused to roll over for the Cardi
nal. Defensive breakdowns and
missed tackles allowed the Slugs
to score two quick tries and nar
row the margin to 27-12.
In characteristic fashion, coach
Frank Boivert had only guarded
praise for his team's performance.
"It was not too bad, but there is a
lot to perfect. We need much more
aggressiveness in defense. Our
execution must be sharpened, and
we need more pace, more pace,
more pace." ,
A full-length rugby game con
sists of two 40-minute halves of
continuous action, and Boivert's
comments reflect his emphasis on
conditioning, which should be a
big factor against UC-Davis this
Saturday.
Play will open at 11 a.m. at Mal
oney Field with the third-team
game, with the first squad follow
ing at 1 p.m. The second team will
play at 3 p.m.
