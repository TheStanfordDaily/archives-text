# Athletes of the Week

### 
The Daily may be bringing you its Ath
letes of the Week a day late because of
Monday's holiday, but our selections —
Michael Flanagan and Meegan Lannin —
certainly did not take a day off or fall short
in their King-like efforts for the men's
tennis and women's gymnastics teams,
respectively.
Flanagan, a junior who originally hails

from Dallas, paced the Cardinal to its third
consecutive Pacific 10 Conference Indoor
Championship last weekend in Seattle by
taking the Flight 1 singles title.
He shut out Oregon's Lee Kirner, 6-0, 6-
0, and then gave up just two games in a 6-2,
2-0 default victory over USC's top-seeded
Brian MacPhie in the second round. Flana
gan proceeded to down Bruce Haddad of Ari
zona State, the third seed, 6-2,4-6, 7-6 (3) in
a tough semifinal match before defeating
Washington's Chet Crile — the hometown
favorite — in straight sets, 6-3, 6-1, to take
the crown.
When he wasn't displaying his individual
talents, Flanagan was pairing up with class
mate Chris Cocotos as the tandem finished
runner-up to UCLA's Robert Janecek and
Sebastian Leßlanc in the Flight 1 doubles
competition.

Lannin, a sophomore from Bangkok,
Thailand, took second place in her first col
legiate individual all-around competition as
the 12th-ranked Cardinal fell to No. 4 Ore
gon State 191.00-188.15 on "Shannon Miller
Night" last Saturday.
Replacing ir\jured classmate Jen 6 Elzie,
Lannin tallied a total of 37.50 on the four
disciplines, including a career-best 9.55 in
the floor exercise and season-high marks of
9.60 on the uneven bars and 9.40 on the
vault. Amazingly, her performance was so
well-rounded that she did not finish among

the top three in any single discipline.
Beaver junior All-American Chari
Knight took first in the bars and door on
the way to a 39.05 first-place score, while
Stanford freshman Linda Chun took third
with 37.20.
Lannin's contributions will be vital to the
Cardinal as it bids for a second consecutive
NCAA final meet appearance this spring.
