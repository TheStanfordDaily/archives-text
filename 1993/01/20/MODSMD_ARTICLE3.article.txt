# Will politics become policy?
## 
### Markley Bavinger Staff writer 
As the new administra
tion takes office, technology
experts will watch and see if
a sweeping technology policy
issued by the Clinton cam
paign will be implemented as
promised.
Stating that "leadership in
developing and commercializ
ing new technologies is critical
to regaining industrial leader
ship, creating high-wage jobs,
and ensuring our long-term
prosperity," Bill Clinton and
A 1 Gore committed them
selves last summer to in
creased attention to and in
vestment in technology. Such
promises were key factors in
winning crucial endorsements
from Silicon Valley companies
like Hewlett-Packard and
Apple Computer.
According to many tech
nology experts, including
Food Research Institute Prof.
Brian Arthur, such an interven
tionist policy is long overdue.
Arguing that for the last 10
years the government has been
wrong to not be more involved
with technology policy, Arthur
has been the author of several
publications concerning the eco
nomics of high technology.
Over the past years, the United
States' edge in technological mar
kets has been slowly eroded by
international competition, Arthur
said. Although the United States
maintains leadership in scientific
fields such as biotechnology,
information technology and
aerospace technology, its position
in these markets is slipping.
In 1986, the United States
posted a deficit in high-tech trade
and has since re-established only
a slight surplus. The trade bal
ance for semiconductors is cur
rently negative, while the balance
for computers is approaching
zero.
At root of these poor trade bal
ances is a lack of investment in
technology, he said.
U.S. expenditures on non
defense R&D and on plant and
equipment is significantly lower
than that of Germany and Japan.
While Germany invests 2.8 per
cent of its GNP in non-defense
R&D and Japan invests 3.0 per
cent, the United States invests
only 1.9 percent. The U.S. invest
ment rate in plant and equipment
of approximately 11 percent of
GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is
half that of Japan's 22 percent
investment and below Germany's

14.5 percent.
Over half of all new U.S.
patents are going to foreign com
panies, with the top four recipi
ents of 1990 patents going to
Hitachi, Toshiba, Canon and Mit
subishi.
The Clinton-Gore technology
policy shows a commitment to the
reversal of these trends. Arthur
said he thinks this policy is evi
dence that the administration is
"waking up to the fact that high
technology is essential to the
modern economy."
Arthur commended the vision
of this policy.
"In the new administration
people are looking ahead 10 to 20
years, and not just until the next
crisis, as has been done in the
past."
This shift in policy is largely
due to the termination of the Cold
War, which has allowed for a
"new sense of national interest
not in military but in economics,"
said Arthur. "The enemy is no
longer seen to be the Soviet
Union, but our economic com
petitors like Germany and
Japan."
Concomitant with this intensi
fied focus on economics has been a
shift from manufactured to
knowledge-based products. "Nat
ural resources, what we dig out of
the ground," reads the policy, "are
being replaced by knowledge and
technology, what we dig out of our
minds, as the source of national
economic competitiveness."
The technology policy reflects
this shift by calling for a redistri
bution of federal R&D funds on
critical technologies that enhance
industrial performance and an
overall leveraging of the national
R&D investment.
Currently 60 percent of the

federal R&D budget is set aside
for defense programs, with the
other 40 percent going to non
defense R&D. Clinton has pro
posed that the percentage expen
diture on defense programs
shifts to 50 percent, thus releas
ing over $7 billion for non
defense R&D.
This is good news for research
universities like Stanford. The
policy suggests continued support
for these institutions because "it
is impossible to predict where the
next breakthrough may come."
The policy also strongly sup
ports investment in 21st century
infrastructures such as an
advanced national communica
tion network.
According to the policy, infras
tructure investment is encour
aged because of its ability to
"stimulate major new national
R&D efforts; create large, pre
dictable markets that would
prompt significant private sector
investments; and create millions
of new jobs."
Other initiatives of the policy
are the establishment of educa
tion and training programs for a
high-skills work force, the invest
ment in technology programs
that empower America's small
businesses, and the creation of a
world-class business environ
ment for private sector invest
ment and innovation.
A final section of the policy
states that there will be increased
support for the two government
agencies which coordinate policy
and enhance private and public
sector cooperation: the Federal
Coordinating Council for Science,
Engineering and Technology
(FCCSET) and the Office of Sci
ence and Technology Policy.
Although Arthur commends
the policy's vision, he insists
there is room for improvement.
He said he would like to see
civilian support for federal R&D
go one step further, and suggests
that a separate government agen
cy should be authorized to appro
priate seed money for high tech
nology projects. Furthermore, he
said there is a great need for an
organization such as this, which
would be free from 'special inter
ests' and 'pork barrel politics.'
Arthur also advocates greater
support for academic research
than is expressed in Clinton's pol
icy. He would like to see a shift
toward the opinion that money is
well spent in universities and
decries the recent onslaught of
government investigations.
It is not wise "throttle the
goose that lays the golden egg,"
he said.
