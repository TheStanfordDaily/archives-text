# For Stanford wrestlers, weight is no light matter
## 
### Dave McAleer 
Pedaling along furiously on an Exercycle for sev
eral hours while wearing a heavy sweatsuit is some
thing most people wouldn't do voluntarily. But for
wrestlers, it's almost a prerequisite to qualifying
for competition.
In NCAA wrestling, there are 10 weight classes,
beginning with 118 pounds and progressing up to
heavyweight, which has an upper limit of 275
pounds. Because additional weight can be an
advantage in a match, most wrestlers try to com
pete at the top end of the lowest weight division
they can qualify for. And in order to bring their
weight down just within the acceptable range for
their desired class, most wrestlers sweat.
Jay Jackson, a junior on the wrestling team,
likened losing weight to "cramming for finals. If
you decide not to do it,"he said, "then everyone
else will have an advantage over you."
Laura Brainin-Rodriguez, a nutritionist with
Cowell's Health Promotion Program, has made
presentations concerning diet and nutrition to
many Stanford athletes, including the wrestling
team. She estimated that she has also individually
counseled about 10 Stanford wrestlers who were
either trying to make a lower weight class or were
just concerned about their nutrition.
"I generally counsel [wrestlers] to maintain a
weight within four to six pounds of their weight
class, and if they want to lose weight to do it over a
period of time, losing no more than two to three
pounds per week," she said.
"Although it varies from person to person, the
majority (of wrestlers) are quite health-conscious,"
she said.
Carol Rewick, a registered dietician at the Palo
Alto Clinic, pointed to crash diets and poor eating
habits as the main health risks for wrestlers trying
to lose weight.
"Wrestlers who try to lose weight through
reducing food, especially carbohydrate intake prior
to wrestling, or who wrestle in a dehydrated state
are just hurting their performance," Rewick said.
Rewick and Brainin-Rodriguez both said low
glycogen levels, which could be caused by too little
carbohydrate intake, would hurt an athlete's per
formance by draining him of needed energy.

However, wrestling coach Chris Horpel said
Stanford wrestlers maintain healthy dietary
habits.
"Wrestlers are often associated with people with
eating disorders, and that is the most inaccurate
thing imaginable," Horpel said. He added that in
his 14 years at Stanford, he has not been aware of
any wrestlers who have had nutritional problems.
Brainin-Rodriguez said Stanford athletes' high

level of nutritional awareness could explain the low
number of diet-related health problems.
Horpel said most wrestlers do not starve them
selves to make their weight class. Instead, they rely
on water loss through sweating and metabolic
weight loss during a typical team workout.
"It's not uncommon for a wrestler to lose from
six to 10 pounds in a workout," Horpel said. "In
essence, a wrestler trains so hard that he loses

water faster than he can assimilate it into his sys
tem. Being dehydrated for two hours is both
healthy and necessary."
Since NCAA weigh-ins are the night before a
match, wrestlers have time to replenish their flu
ids, Horpel said.
"On weigh-in day I lose all the water, and don't
drink it back until after weigh-ins." Jackson said.
"You're always eating normally to keep your
metabolism going. The food gives you energy to lose
that water weight."
Rewick said that as long as a wrestler continues
to eat healthily, and "makes weight" through water
loss the night before a match, there shouldn't be
any ill effects, provided he is not in a prolonged
state of excessive dehydration, and drinks enough
water to replenish his system before the match.
The amount of water a wrestler loses in practice
may seem high, but Brainin-Rodriguez pointed out
that healthy athletes with low body fat will tend to
retain more water because of higher glycogen lev
els, and thus would have more water to lose.
Horpel said, "Wrestlers work extremely hard,
harder than the average person can imagine. Most
people cannot imagine losing 10 pounds in a two
hour workout, but then most people never get in
good enough shape to work that hard for two
hours."
But weight fluctuation can cause long-term
problems.
"This sort of weight-fluctuation can add stress
to the body," Brainin-Rodriguez said. "If continued
over a long period of time, it can lead to weight
cycling," which makes it hard to maintain a consis
tent, healthy weight.
Junior co-captain Lance Johnson said there is
very little outside pressure on Stanford wrestlers to
drop weight classes.
Horpel agreed with Johnson. "A wrestler choos
es his weight division based on his fat percentage
and on where he can make the team. I never tell
someone he has to lose weight.
"I pay attention to how an athlete competes,"
Horpel said. "Some wrestlers are more successful
going down one weight division while others are
more successful going up."
"Success is the strongest motivation for chang
ing weight divisions," he said.

to wrestling, or who wrestle in a dehydrated state
are just hurting their performance," Rewick said.
Rewick and Brainin-Rodriguez both said low
glycogen levels, which could be caused by too little
carbohydrate intake, would hurt an athlete's per
formance by draining him of needed energy.

However, wrestling coach Chris Horpel said
Stanford wrestlers maintain healthy dietary
habits.
"Wrestlers are often associated with people with
eating disorders, and that is the most inaccurate
thing imaginable," Horpel said. He added that in
his 14 years at Stanford, he has not been aware of
any wrestlers who have had nutritional problems.
Brainin-Rodriguez said Stanford athletes' high

level of nutritional awareness could explain the low
number of diet-related health problems.
Horpel said most wrestlers do not starve them
selves to make their weight class. Instead, they rely
on water loss through sweating and metabolic
weight loss during a typical team workout.
"It's not uncommon for a wrestler to lose from
six to 10 pounds in a workout," Horpel said. "In
essence, a wrestler trains so hard that he loses

water faster than he can assimilate it into his sys
tem. Being dehydrated for two hours is both
healthy and necessary."
Since NCAA weigh-ins are the night before a
match, wrestlers have time to replenish their flu
ids, Horpel said.
"On weigh-in day I lose all the water, and don't
drink it back until after weigh-ins." Jackson said.
"You're always eating normally to keep your
metabolism going. The food gives you energy to lose
that water weight."
Rewick said that as long as a wrestler continues
to eat healthily, and "makes weight" through water
loss the night before a match, there shouldn't be
any ill effects, provided he is not in a prolonged
state of excessive dehydration, and drinks enough
water to replenish his system before the match.
The amount of water a wrestler loses in practice
may seem high, but Brainin-Rodriguez pointed out
that healthy athletes with low body fat will tend to
retain more water because of higher glycogen lev
els, and thus would have more water to lose.
Horpel said, "Wrestlers work extremely hard,
harder than the average person can imagine. Most
people cannot imagine losing 10 pounds in a two
hour workout, but then most people never get in
good enough shape to work that hard for two
hours."
But weight fluctuation can cause long-term
problems.
"This sort of weight-fluctuation can add stress
to the body," Brainin-Rodriguez said. "If continued
over a long period of time, it can lead to weight
cycling," which makes it hard to maintain a consis
tent, healthy weight.
Junior co-captain Lance Johnson said there is
very little outside pressure on Stanford wrestlers to
drop weight classes.
Horpel agreed with Johnson. "A wrestler choos
es his weight division based on his fat percentage
and on where he can make the team. I never tell
someone he has to lose weight.
"I pay attention to how an athlete competes,"
Horpel said. "Some wrestlers are more successful
going down one weight division while others are
more successful going up."
"Success is the strongest motivation for chang
ing weight divisions," he said.
