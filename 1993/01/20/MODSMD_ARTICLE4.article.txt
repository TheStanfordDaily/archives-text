paign last summer. He is report
ing on the inauguration this week.
WASHINGTON — Traditional
ly, First Families leave a gift to be re
membered by in the White House;
Nancy Reagan, for example, ordered
a new set of White House china.
Barbara Bush, not to be out
done, ordered a set of china plat
ters from Lennox, the supplier of
china and crystal to the White
House for more than 100 years.
That's how Stanford In Wash
ington senior Becca Bracy almost
got her 15 minutes of fame. Bracy
was scheduled to help her father,
who works for Lennox, present
the official Bush platters to Bar
bara Bush last Monday.
"While everyone was partying
it up with the Clintons, we were
supposed to present these platters
to Babs," she said. "Unfortunate
ly, it all fell through, and I had to
settle for presenting the official
Inaugural crystal bowls to Sena
tor (Wendell 1 Ford |D- Kyi "

All is not lost, however.
"It might happen at a late
night rendezvous in a Motel 6
somewhere, but it might not have
the same drama as in the White
House receiving room.". . .
. . . The following items are
reprinted, verbatim, from Press
Pool Report 1 of January 17, 1993,
describing the Clintons' and
Gores' tour of Monticello:
"Clinton admired a high back
curved back leather chair in the
library and he said 'it's much easi
er to stay alert in a high back
chair.' "
"The guide explained that TJ
only read books in there (sic) orig
inal language and he read in seven
languages. Gore quipped 'a high
standard for me, I only read in six
languages.' "...
. . . Blues great Taj Mahal on
Bill Clinton's sax playing:
"Practice. Get up every morn
ing and practice. 'Cause he's got
great tone. ... I dunno, music ca
reer, politics, [it] would be kind of
hard to balance both. But I bet
that sometimes when it gets hec
tic, he's gonna get his sax out and
play something, you know, for
himself." . . .
. . . "Parade Fun Facts," cour
tesy of PIC, the Presidential Inau

gural Committee:
• The first civilian to pass Pres
ident-elect Clinton at the review
ing stand: Trudie McAdams, 17,
drum major for the Hope High
School Band.
• Gallons of soup for perform
ers: 700
• Gallons of hot beverages: 500

• Pints of Arkansas water for
participants: 15,000
• Number of porta-potties: 253
• Number of donkeys: 6 . . .
.. . Funniest sight so far: the
sign language interpreters trying
to keep up with the musicians at
this week's festivities. Apparent
ly, they don't screen these people
for soulfulness before they match
them with performers.
Case in point: the woman try
ing to keep up with Robert Cray as
he crooned the blues was trying to

be soulful with her hips and sign
the blues, but couldn't quite sway
rhythmically. It must have looked
like Hoagy Carmichael sounds.
The "most confused inter
preter" award goes to the guy who
was trying to communicate what
ever Bob Dylan was saying on Sun
day night at the Lincoln Memorial.
How do you mumble meaningfully
in sign language? . ..
. .. Bill Clinton has chosen his
signature food, according to the
Almond Board of California, and

it's not those dancing raisins. Soon
the nation's chic dish will be cinna
mon-glazed California almonds.
The favorite foods of seven of
Clinton's predecessors have been:
• George Bush: Pork Rinds
• Ronald Reagan: Jelly Beans
• Jimmy Carter: Peanuts
• Richard Nixon: Cottage
cheese and ketchup
• John Kennedy: Strawberry
shortcake
• Dwight Eisenhower: String
beans almondine and quail hash
