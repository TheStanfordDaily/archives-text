WASHINGTON â€” Traditional
ly, First Families leave a gift to be re
membered by in the White House;
Nancy Reagan, for example, ordered
a new set of White House china.
Barbara Bush, not to be out
done, ordered a set of china plat
ters from Lennox, the supplier of
china and crystal to the White
House for more than 100 years.
That's how Stanford In Wash
ington senior Becca Bracy almost
got her 15 minutes of fame. Bracy
was scheduled to help her father,
who works for Lennox, present
the official Bush platters to Bar
bara Bush last Monday.
"While everyone was partying
it up with the Clintons, we were
supposed to present these platters
to Babs," she said. "Unfortunate
ly, it all fell through, and I had to
settle for presenting the official
Inaugural crystal bowls to Sena
tor (Wendell 1 Ford |D- Kyi "

All is not lost, however.
"It might happen at a late
night rendezvous in a Motel 6
somewhere, but it might not have
the same drama as in the White
House receiving room.". . .
. . . The following items are
reprinted, verbatim, from Press
Pool Report 1 of January 17, 1993,
describing the Clintons' and
Gores' tour of Monticello:
"Clinton admired a high back
curved back leather chair in the
library and he said 'it's much easi
er to stay alert in a high back
chair.' "
"The guide explained that TJ
only read books in there (sic) orig
inal language and he read in seven
languages. Gore quipped 'a high
standard for me, I only read in six
languages.' "...
. . . Blues great Taj Mahal on
Bill Clinton's sax playing:
"Practice. Get up every morn
ing and practice. 'Cause he's got
great tone. ... I dunno, music ca
reer, politics, [it] would be kind of
hard to balance both. But I bet
that sometimes when it gets hec
tic, he's gonna get his sax out and
play something, you know, for
himself." . . .
