## Winter One Acts scores a home run with 'Baseball' 
### Peter Edmonston Staff writer 
"Night Baseball," a one-act play written for last
year's Original Winter One Acts, has been selected as
one of 13 plays to compete in the American College
Theater Festival, organizers announced last week.
The Ram's Head production will go up against
original plays from Glendale and CSU-Fullerton next
month at the Pacific Regionals, held at the Universi
ty of Nevada at Las Vegas.
Senior Kevin Bleyer, the producer of last year's
Winter One Acts, has spent much of the last two
weeks reassembling the six members of the cast of
"Night Baseball," three of whom have graduated
since the original production last January.
"One of them was on his way to go ice-fishing in
Alaska," Bleyer said. The playwright, Gabriel Tissian
— who has since stopped out — is flying back to Stan
ford to attend the competition.
If Stanford's production is chosen as one of the
two finalists, the Festival will fly the cast, crew and
sets to Washington, D.C. for a performance at the
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
Though its title sounds quite innocuous, "Night
Baseball" deals with issues of racism among Philadel
phia police officers. The title refers to a group of

Philadelphia police officers' nighttime ritual of racist
beatings. During the course of the play, a new recruit
slowly becomes aware of the legacy of violence which
he has inherited.
Much of the play's strength comes from the raw
ness of its writing, according to Bleyer. The on-stage
violence of this production is rough enough to require
a special reinforced table as part of the set, which
must be hauled to Las Vegas for the competition.
"It's ironic that we have to bring a poker table to Las
Vegas," Bleyer observed.
Bleyer said that Ivan Hess, Chairman of the Festi
val, was particularly impressed when he discovered
that the One Acts are a completely student-run en
deavor.
Though only "Night Baseball" was chosen for the
competition, the group of three plays has already
been given a merit award for production by the judges
of the Festival.
Festival Pacific Chair Harvey Lamda, who judged
the performance, praised all three productions for
their "wide-ranging stylistic insight." Moreover,
three actors in the One Acts — Monica Romig, Dan
Hunt and Russell Bell — were nominated to compete
for individual awards in acting next month in Las
