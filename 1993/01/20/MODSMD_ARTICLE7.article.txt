# Shopping Central: supply store to open today
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
More than four years after the ASSU
started its quest to "Beat the Bookstore,"
the University is stepping into the ring
today — with a ribbon-cutting ceremony
marking the opening of a Stanford-operated
store offering wholesale home, school and
office supplies at discount prices.
The warehouse outlet is located at 330
Bonair Siding Rd. and is run by Stanford's
Procurement Department. It will carry
about 12,000 items on its shelves, according
to Jane Williams, marketing and customer
service manager for Central Stores.
Store officials expect a gathering of ap
proximately 150 people for the 11 a.m. cere
mony, Williams said. Among those sched
uled to appear are ASSU Senate Chair Ron
Brown and Vice President of Faculty and
Staff Services Barbara Butterfield.
The Central Stores satellite represents a
new on-campus option for Stanford con
sumers, Williams said. "We would like to see
ourselves as providing an alternative to the
Bookstore."

Nevertheless, Williams said that last
year's decision to open the store had little to
do with revelations concerning the Book
store's unusual perquisites. "It's more coin
cidence than anything else," she said.
The Procurement Department already
operates an Electrical Engineering store
and had previously offered Central Stores
products to University staff via on-line com
puter.
The opening of a site at Stanford, howev
er, means that consumers can now "come in
and see" what they want to buy, Williams
said. In addition, the store's services will be
available for all students as well as staff for
the first time.
Williams said that the University will
make only a 5 percent profit on the store,
enough to cover staffing costs. She said the
University will in fact save money from the
project, since "the Procurement Depart
ment is buying products at the lowest possi
ble price and staff members will not have to
shop around on paid time."
The store will carry office and school

supplies, including computers
and computer software, and some
home furnishings. Williams said
that special orders on items not
on store shelves will be filled
within 48 hours.
Central Stores is negotiating
with Apple Computers to retail
Macintoshes in its location, she said,
but could be unsuccessful because

the Bookstore's existing Microdisc
store sells Apples exclusively.
The store is still looking for
three more students to staff the
warehouse. The store's opening,
in fact, was pushed back from its
original December target because
preparations "required more per
son power than we thought,"
Williams said.
Central Stores hopes to take in
$30 million per year. "If we reach
that level, we'll know we're really
doing it," Williams said. "I think
it's quite possible."
