# Racism victim holds session with faculty
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Senior Mary Wu received a verbal apology yesterday
from Michel Boudart, the chemical engineering pro
fessor who made racist remarks to her in October at
the Faculty Club. The apology came a few hours before
Wu participated in a presentation on racial issues for
the Engineering Department's executive committee.
Meanwhile, the Board of Directors of the Faculty
Club is considering whether it should develop its own
statement defining acceptable conduct at the club,
said board president Marian Adams.
The University has not taken any formal action
against Boudart, who apologized for making remarks
such as "Go back to China" and "You make me so
sick" to the Chinese-American student while she
worked at the Faculty Club.
Boudart's personal apology yesterday follows a let
ter of apology sent to her earlier. He has been on sab
batical during fall and winter quarters. '
Wu, who has declined to identify Boudart, said she
accepted his apology because she "realized he felt re
morse and was sincere."
Although Wu said she is disappointed that no offi
cial action was taken against Boudart, she is "satis
fied" with his apology.
"Although his real feelings may not change, people
are more sensitized [andl more aware," she said.
Boudart said he considers his personal involve
ment in the incident finished because of his verbal
and written apologies to Wu. But he added that he ad
mires and supports Wu's plan to use the incident to
raise awareness about racism.
"She is still very much in a mood of pursuing this
thing, but not in a personal way, because of the im
portance of the problem in the University. I respect
that," Boudart said.
"I believe in that issue — the issue of racism — and
she is probably the best person on campus to add to
the sensitivity of it,"he added.
Education on racism
In addition to meeting with Boudart, Wu joined four
other students who met with the executive committee
of the School of Engineering and spoke about the im
pact of racism. The committee consists of the deans, as
sociate deans and department heads of the school.
Wu said she tried to convey the damaging effect of
racial incidents on individual's lives, using her own
experience as evidence. Other topics covered in the
discussion included political cor
rectness and the difficulty stu
dents have in discussing sensitive
issues with professors.
"The students essentially gave
the faculty an excellent tutorial
on the kinds of racial issues that
face students every day," said
Dean of Engineering James Gib
bons. "It was extremely powerful
and productive for the chairs of
the department of the school to
hear this testimony in such a
moving way."
Junior Lynn Enoch said she
was "surprised at how supportive
and receptive" the committee
was. She added that there was one
awkward moment when a profes

sor made comments questioning
the credibility of Wu's story.
"The comments of one person
put a damper on the whole thing,"
she said. "But the good thing is
that most of the people there dis
agreed with him openly."
Gibbons said the discussion
would continue in individual
departments using transcripts of
the students' presentations. "The
students have done an enormous
service for the University and we
will make the notes available to
other schools" at Stanford, he
said.
No real Club policy
The Faculty Club's Board of
Directors has sent letters to its
members explaining the incident
and condemning such behavior as
"unacceptable." The board will
make a decision on whether it

needs its own conduct policy at next
Thursday's meeting, Adams said.
After Wu complained about
Boudart's remarks, the board
searched for a way to respond but
did not find a University policy
that was obviously applicable to
incidents within the Faculty
Club, Adams said.
Last quarter, the board sent
letters to members indicating
that similar incidents would be
unacceptable. "An environment
that fosters [a] sense of communi
ty requires that members treat
each other, staff and servers with
courtesy and civility," the letter
read.
In addition, the board sent a
letter to Boudart, but decided not
to take any further action against
the professor because they felt the
University's grievance policy
would take effect, Adams said.
