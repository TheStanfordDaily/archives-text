### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
Senior Mary Wu received a verbal apology yesterday
from Michel Boudart, the chemical engineering pro
fessor who made racist remarks to her in October at
the Faculty Club. The apology came a few hours before
Wu participated in a presentation on racial issues for
the Engineering Department's executive committee.
Meanwhile, the Board of Directors of the Faculty
Club is considering whether it should develop its own
statement defining acceptable conduct at the club,
said board president Marian Adams.
The University has not taken any formal action
against Boudart, who apologized for making remarks
such as "Go back to China" and "You make me so
sick" to the Chinese-American student while she
worked at the Faculty Club.
Boudart's personal apology yesterday follows a let

Wu, who has declined to identify Boudart, said she
accepted his apology because she "realized he felt re
morse and was sincere."
Although Wu said she is disappointed that no offi
cial action was taken against Boudart, she is "satis
fied" with his apology.
"Although his real feelings may not change, people
are more sensitized [andl more aware," she said.
Boudart said he considers his personal involve
ment in the incident finished because of his verbal
and written apologies to Wu. But he added that he ad
mires and supports Wu's plan to use the incident to
raise awareness about racism.
"She is still very much in a mood of pursuing this
thing, but not in a personal way, because of the im
portance of the problem in the University. I respect
that," Boudart said.
"I believe in that issue — the issue of racism — and
she is probably the best person on campus to add to
the sensitivity of it,"he added.
Education on racism
In addition to meeting with Boudart, Wu joined four
other students who met with the executive committee
of the School of Engineering and spoke about the im
pact of racism. The committee consists of the deans, as
sociate deans and department heads of the school.
Wu said she tried to convey the damaging effect of
racial incidents on individual's lives, using her own
experience as evidence. Other topics covered in the
