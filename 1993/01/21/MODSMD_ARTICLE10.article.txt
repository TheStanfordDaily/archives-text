inist Ann Simonton began her presentation to a
Cubberly Auditorium audience last night by show
ing a picture of herself at a beauty pageant, scanti
ly clad, lined up among others similarly dressed.
Simonton said she learned at an early age to
accept the humiliation of being stared at and sole
ly judged by her outward appearance.
By institutionalizing the importance of packag
ing oneself, beauty contests harm all women, said
Simonton, who added that it's an unfortunate
irony that the Miss America Pageant offers the
largest educational scholarship available to
women in the whole world.
In her address — "Sex, Power, and the Media:
Rethinking Myths of America's Dream Girl"—
Simonton challenged students to become "more
critical viewers of the media."
Mass media shapes the way we feel about
women, men, children and violence, Simonton said.
The media usually depicts women as sex objects,
which "harms and belittles" all women and has
highly destructive consequences, Simonton said.
In addition, the $130 billion, 100 percent tax
free advertising industry glamorizes sexual vio

lence and feeds off people's insecurities so that
they will remain consumers, Simonton said.
Through images and words, she demonstrated
the destructive messages that advertisements
convey.
After showing an ad of a superwoman perform
ing about 10 different tasks, Simonton said, "These
kinds of (unrealistic) stereotypes are killing people."
"Who is Victoria Secret that she has the time to
lounge around?" Simonton asked. This is a "pas
sive, classist notion" that women have an abun
dance of leisure time, she said. "Women don't
have the time to lounge around."
Turning to another topic, Simonton said the
diet industry makes $33 billion per year. But it's
been shown that "diets don't work," she added.
"You'll diet and you'll become fatter" because
dieting changes your body's metabolism.
The ideal perpetuated by the media that beau
tiful women all have the emaciated look denies
"who we are genetically," Simonton said, and it
pushes women to become "anorexic, surgically
altered Barbie dolls."
But "we are more than the way we look,"
Simonton said.
For eight years Simonton has served as coordi
nator of Media Watch, a group that monitors the
media's portrayal of women.
