# Burglars steal from Trancos
## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
A thief or thieves stole more than $1,000 worth of
items including a television, VCR, microwave and
computer keyboard from Trancos early yesterday
morning.
"They also stole our best ping-pong paddle," said
Trancos freshman Eric Bauer. "They knew which
one was the best and then took it."
Trancos residents filed a police report, but Stan
ford police were unavailable to comment because the
report had not yet been processed.
A number of Trancos students expressed anger at
the break-in. "We feel like our dorm was cheated out
of a lot of money by this person," Bauer said.

"Dorms do not carry insurance for theft," said
Amit Baneijee, resident assistant at the Wilbur Hall
dormitory. "So we won't be reimbursed for the loss
es. We'll have to pay for it ourselves."
The robbery occurred between 5 a.m. and 8 a.m.,
he said. "All the doors were locked — I checked them
myself."
No one in the dorm saw the robbery, and the fear
is that the intruder had a key, he said.
However, other possibilities for the burglar's
entry are being discussed. Several windows were left
open Tuesday night, providing another entryway.
"We didn't do a good job of locking things up,"
Baneijee pointed out. Once inside the building, it
would be fairly easy for someone to take the equip
ment and run, he said.
