## Senate confirms three key Cabinet nominees 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate
confirmed Warren Christopher, Les
Aspin and Lloyd Bentsen to Cabinet
posts yesterday, speedily installing the
officials President Clinton needs to han
dle the diplomatic and economic troubles
he inherited.
In a rapid-fire series of voice votes,
Christopher was approved as secretary
of state, Aspin as secretary of defense
and Bentsen as secretary of the Trea
sury. It took less than 45 minutes to con
firm the first three members of Clinton's
Cabinet.
"The Senate stands ready to work
with President Clinton and Vice Presi
dent (Al) Gore, and to work for all Amer
icans," said Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
The Christopher and Aspin nomina
tions were approved on the first day in
recognition of pressing international
business and to ensure an "effective
chain of command." Bentsen, a Texas
Democrat who chaired the Senate

Finance Committee, was the first of the
three taken up, in recognition of the
high esteem his colleagues hold for him,
Mitchell said.
"He understands our tough problems
can only be solved by bipartisan coopera
tion," Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dole of Kansas said of Bentsen, who was
the Democrats' 1988 vice-presidential
nominee.
Christopher, who headed Clinton's
transition team, and Aspin, a Democrat
from Wisconsin who was House Armed
Services Committee chairman, also drew
bipartisan praise.
The 67-year-old Christopher, a Los
Angeles corporate attorney who gradu
ated from the Stanford Law School, is in
his fourth term on the University's
Board of Trustees. He was the board's
president from 1985-88.
The Senate might have taken up
more, but with lawmakers eager to
attend inaugural balls, other confirma
tions were scheduled for today.
