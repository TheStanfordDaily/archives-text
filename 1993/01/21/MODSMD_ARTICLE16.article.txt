## Saddam mocks Bush one last time 
### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Iraq gave
George Bush one last sneer yesterday,
promising to rebuild a factory blasted by
U.S. missiles and appearing to abide by
a cease-fire offered to President Clinton.
U.S. planes were reported in the skies
over Iraq, but military officials in Wash
ington said there no fire or provocations
were directed at American craft.
Saddam Hussein promised Tuesday
to stop shooting at allied planes as "a
gesture of good will" toward Clinton,
who took office yesterday.
"The cursed criminal George Bush
ended his ominous term today and
departed for history's trash heap with
his hands stained with the blood of peo
ple aspiring to freedom," the official
Iraqi News Agency commented.
Baghdad also said it would allow
U.N. weapons inspection flights to
resume without the conditions Iraq
imposed earlier.
The 70-member U.N. inspection
team that has been waiting in Bahrain
for more than two weeks will leave for
Iraq today, U.N. regional chief Doug
Englund said in Manama. The group
includes a 25-member chemical

weapons destruction team led by Amer
ican Paul Brough.
Still, Hussein showed yesterday he
would remain an irritant to Clinton. He
ordered the reconstruction of the facto
ry that was seriously damaged in an
attack Sunday by U.S. Tomahawk
cruise missiles, the Iraqi News Agency
»•£ ported.
The Pentagon said the factory at Zaa
faraniyeh, just south of Baghdad, was
an important part of Iraq's nuclear pro
gram. Iraq insisted it made moldings
and machine tools for private industry.
France, a key member of the U.S.-led
coalition that fought the Persian Gulf
War and drove Iraq from Kuwait, yes
terday criticized the cruise missile
attack, saying it overstepped the U.N.
mandate. Russia, a former Iraqi ally,
also opposed the attack.
The U.N. Legal Department backed
the French in a ruling yesterday. It said
the resolution the allies used to justify
declaring "no-fly" zones in southern and
northern Iraq makes no reference to the
use of military force.
French planes have flown escort for
U.S. and British craft during the mili

tary strikes against Iraq that began Jan.
13, but Sunday's attack was carried out
only by missiles fired from U.S. ships.
Iraq also announced that today it will
reopen a baby formula factory destroyed
by allied bombs during the 1991 Gulf
War. The United States insisted at the
time the facility was a cover for the
manufacturer of bacteriological
weapons.
Iraq could not resist a last shot at
Bush, who as president forged the Gulf
War coalition.
Saadi Mahdi Saleh, speaker of Iraq's
parliament, expressed his country's
"sincere desire to establish constructive
relations with the new U.S. administra
tion under Bill Clinton."
He said that he hoped Clinton would
take positions different from those of
Bush, "whose policy caused the launch
ing of an evil aggression against an inde
pendent and peace-loving people."
The Iraqi News Agency accused Bush
of "ugly crimes," such as leading the
multinational force that drove Iraq from
Kuwait in February 1991. It said recent
allied attacks were Bush's "last, poi
soned drops of hatred."
