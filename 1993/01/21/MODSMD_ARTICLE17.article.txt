i)r. Death' strikes again
SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) - Dr. Jack
Kevorkian was present at his ninth assisted sui
cide yesterday, and his attorney said more would
come before a temporary state law banning the
practice takes effect.
Jack Elmer Miller, 53, was the first man to die
with help from Kevorkian, who has helped eight
women die since 1990.
Miller inhaled carbon monoxide through a
mask at 9:10 a.m. at his home in Wayne County's
Huron Township, lawyer Geoffrey Fieger said.
Miller suffered from bone cancer that had left him
in excruciating pain, Fieger said.
"There will be more deaths," Fieger said.
"There is a feeling of desperation among many
people out there that time is running out."
Effective March 30, a state law will make
assisted suicide a felony for 15 months while the

issue is studied. Violators face up to four years in
prison and a $2,000 fine.
Hepburn dies at 63
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Audrey Hepburn,
the Oscar-winning actress known for her charm,
high-fashion elegance and aristocratic bearing in
films such as "Roman Holiday" and "My Fair
Lady," died yesterday, the U.N. Children's Fund
said. She was 63.
Hepburn, who had undergone colon cancer
surgery last year, had been a longtime goodwill
ambassador for the U.N. agency.
She won an Academy Award for best actress in
1953 for her first American film, "Roman Holi
day," the story of a princess who goes incognito in
Rome and falls in love with a journalist. Time
magazine said she was "exquisitely blending
queenly dignity and bubbling mischief."
