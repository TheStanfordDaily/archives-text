## New president looks to future, better America

WASHINGTON (AP) -
William Jefferson Clinton was
inaugurated the 42nd presi
dent of the United States yes
terday before a cheering crowd
of a quarter-million, bringing a
new generation to power and
pledging "to face hard truths
and take strong steps."
Inheriting a weak economy,
a $4 trillion federal debt and a
galaxy of foreign-policy prob
lems, Clinton called for nation
al renewal and acknowledged,
"It will not be easy; it will re
quire sacrifice." But he speci
fied none in his inaugural ad
dress, leaving that for later.
Clinton used the word
change 11 times, and promised
that his Democratic adminis
tration would end the "dead
lock and drift" of government.
"There is nothing wrong
with America that cannot be
cured by what is right with
America," Clinton said at a
Capitol ceremony bathed in
sunlight on a chilly winter day.
