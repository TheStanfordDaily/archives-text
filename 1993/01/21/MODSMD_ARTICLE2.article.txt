# Crowds, cheers, changes at Clinton inaugural
## New president looks to future, better America 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
William Jefferson Clinton was
inaugurated the 42nd presi
dent of the United States yes
terday before a cheering crowd
of a quarter-million, bringing a
new generation to power and
pledging "to face hard truths
and take strong steps."
Inheriting a weak economy,
a $4 trillion federal debt and a
galaxy of foreign-policy prob
lems, Clinton called for nation
al renewal and acknowledged,
"It will not be easy; it will re
quire sacrifice." But he speci
fied none in his inaugural ad
dress, leaving that for later.
Clinton used the word
change 11 times, and promised
that his Democratic adminis
tration would end the "dead
lock and drift" of government.
"There is nothing wrong
with America that cannot be
cured by what is right with
America," Clinton said at a
Capitol ceremony bathed in
sunlight on a chilly winter day.

With wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea by his side, Bill Clinton is sworn in as the 42nd president by Chief Supreme Court
Justice William Rehnquist on the Capitol steps.
Cheers, whistles and applause
swelled from the huge crowd.
Around the world, countless mil
lions paused to watch the ceremo
ny on television.
It was a day of emotional cele
bration and colorful pageantry.
Pennsylvania Avenue was packed
with an estimated 800,000 well
wishers as the new president and
his wife, Hillary, walked several
blocks of the parade route to their
new home at the White House.
Hand in hand, they walked inside
after staying past dark to watch
marching units from every state.
Later, they headed out for a
late night of partying, beginning
with a dinner honoring Medal of
Honor winners. "As you might
imagine, this has been a long,
wonderful, unique day in the lives
of Bill and Hillary Clinton," the
president told military digni
taries. "We wanted to begin here
because of your commitment to
our nation." Next came 11 inau
gural balls.
A saxophone was presented to
Clinton at the Arkansas ball and
he delighted the crowd by playing
along as Ben E. King sang, "Your
Momma Don't Dance and Your
Daddy Don't Rock 'n' Roll."
Outgoing President Bush,
denied a second term by a restive
electorate demanding change,
watched stoically at the Capitol as
Clinton was sworn in by Chief
Justice William Rehnquist. Sud
denly an ex-president, Bush
stepped forward to shake his suc
cessor's hand.
Afterward, Bush flew home to
Houston, ending a quarter-centu
ry of public service and 12 years of
Republican rule in the White
House. Bush left behind a note for
Clinton in the Oval Office; its con
tents weren't disclosed.
At 46, Clinton is the nation's

third-youngest president and the
first of the postwar Baby Boom
generation to sit in the White
House.
Bush, perhaps the last presi
dent of the World War II genera
tion, was the fourth-oldest chief
executive when he was sworn in
at 64.
In his speech, remarkable for
its brevity at 14 minutes, Clinton
saluted Bush but lamented the
state of the nation.
"Raised in unrivaled prosperi
ty, we inherit an economy still the
world's strongest but weakened
by business failures, stagnant
wages, increasing inequality and
deep divisions among our people,"
Clinton said. He decried the high
costs of health care, the scourge of
crime and the hardships suffered
by millions of poor children.
The day was draped in expecta
tions that Clinton would move
quickly with an economic pro
gram — and more slowly perhaps
to recast U.S. policies involving
international crises in Somalia
and Iraq, Haiti and Bosnia.
Untested in foreign affairs,
Clinton was forceful in expressing
his resolve.
"When our vital interests are
challenged, or the will and con
science of the international com
munity defied, we will act — with
peaceful diplomacy when possible,
with force when necessary. The
brave Americans serving our
nation in the Persian Gulf, in
Somalia, and wherever else they
stand are testament to our resolve."
With U.S. warplanes flying
over Iraq, Clinton was the first
president since Richard Nixon to
take office with American troops
on combat duty. Iraq appeared to
be abiding by the cease-fire it
offered Clinton but there was a
fresh challenge, as Baghdad
promised to rebuild a factory dev
astated by a U.S. cruise missile
attack.
The inaugural parade was still
under way as the Senate con

firmed the nominations of key
members of Clinton's Cabinet:
Warren Christopher, secretary of
state; Les Aspin at Defense, and
Lloyd Bentsen at Treasury. Clin
ton may hold his first Cabinet
meeting today. He plans to per
sonally greet White House visi
tors at an open house and, aides
said, he will issue executive orders
on unspecified subjects.
A moving van with Arkansas
tags — presumably carrying his
household goods — arrived at the
White House at the same time as
Clinton. "Y'all made it, huh?"
Clinton said.
In his last hours as a private
citizen, Clinton stayed up until
the early hours of yesterday talk
ing with Vice President-to-be A 1
Gore about the days ahead. "I
didn't get much sleep," Clinton
told lawmakers at a Capitol lun
cheon. He raised his glass to toast
"a new partnership in America's
government."
House Speaker Thomas Foley
pledged cooperation from con
gressional Democrats. "We will
match your proposals with our
strong effort to move the country
toward fundamental change."
At 11:58 a.m., two minutes
ahead of schedule, Clinton raised
his right hand and recited the
simple 35-word oath used by
George Washington and every
American president thereafter.
With his left hand on a King
James Bible given by his grand
mother, he pledged "to preserve,
protect and defend the Constitu
tion."
The president took his oath as
William Jefferson Clinton,
eschewing for the moment his
trademark "Bill."
Clinton grabbed Gore in a bear
hug after Gore recited the vice
presidential oath. After his own
swearing in, Clinton kissed his
wife and his 12-year-old daughter,
Chelsea, and scooped them up in a
family hug. "I love you," he whis
pered.
