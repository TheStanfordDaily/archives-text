University requirements
intend to enhance major;
distribute ill will instead

((IT TELL-ROUNDED" —
\l\f that's the phrase that
Y Y most Stanford stu
dents heard from the moment they
began thinking about colleges.
According to recent college
admission trends, the applicant that
plays the tuba, speaks Serbo-Croat
ian, fled "Vietnam at age three and
took a year off to go to the North
Pole is more likely to be offered a
spot in the incoming class than the
bookworm with a 4.0 GPA. Reason
being, the well-rounded applicant
can contribute varied experiences
and viewpoints to the college atmo
sphere that others cannot.
Yet the desire for well-rounded
students does not end with the
arrival of a university acceptance
letter. Stanford, for example, adds
finishing touches to each student's
breadth through everyone's favorite
graduation hurdle: Distribution
Requirements.
In an effort to generate techies
who can spell "Plato" and fuzzies
who can turn on a computer, the
University requires all students to
explore other disciplines. Loftily
explained, the requirements provide
students with an excellent opportu
nity to examine unfamiliar disci
plines, question their choice of a
major and, of course, become even
more well-rounded as individuals.
But the DR system at Stanford is
more likely to create a paper tigers
chasing their own tails than Renais
sance men and women. All too
many DRs are confusing and disre
spected. Students view these classes
as a chore, and, on the whole, enroll
in the easiest ones on a pass/no cred
it basis. And many only attend these
classes on test days — attesting that
the course is a waste of time, units
and tuition.
The current system needs to be
rejuvenated, so that the DRs create

the academically diverse students
they were intended to ensure. First,
there needs to be a consolidation of
some of the DRs. The current system
is not only redundant, but it also
requires too much time and too many
units. The nine separate require
ments prevent further exploration of
a secondary subject (the equivalent of
a "minor") and students obtaining
demanding engineering degrees
encounter extra difficulty when ful
filling these requirements.
Areas 1, 2 and 3 should be consol
idated for one simple reason: all
focus on variations of a theme: cul
ture. If the Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues tracks were restructured cor
rectly, both world and American cul
ture would be incorporated into the
freshman curriculum. The non
western requirement still could be
fulfilled through CIV and courses
earmarked in Areas 7, 8 and 9.
Courses listed under Area 6,
Technology and Applied Science,
could be offered as purer forms of
the maths and sciences under
either Area 4, Mathematical Sci
ences, or Area 5, Natural Sciences.
Classes which satisfy Areas 4 and 5
would involve hands-on practicality
in problem solving.
The basic problem with the DR
system is that students are able to
skirt them. Departments must
make the courses that satisfy these
requirements both more challeng
ing and more interesting. Econ
classes could use videotapes of Ross
Perot to examine his policies.
There are successes already pre
sent within the DR system. Gil Mas
ter's CEI7O class, which many stu
dents only take because of the
requirement, creates an engaging
atmosphere for many students —
even at 8 a.m. Taking a subject and
bringing it down to a practical level
makes it a learning experience for
the neophyte.
To ask students to spend units on
subjects that do not attempt to pull
them in is too much to ask.
Until this is done, well-rounded
ness will continue to complicate stu
dents' lives and build nothing — not
even character.
