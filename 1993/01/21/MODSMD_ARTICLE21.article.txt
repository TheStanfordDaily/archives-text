Post Office belittles its
patrons, damages mail
after long lines, waits

I just wanted to drop a note to berate
the Stanford post office.
After waiting 45 minutes in line
there, I mailed a letter two-day priority
mail. Five days later, it ended up in my
own mail box, damaged, torn and late.
As it was an application to a graduate
school on the East Coast, I was fairly
upset. So I went very politely to speak
with the manager.
The manager of the post office
informed me that my letter wasn't dam
aged at all. He told me that I had misla
belled the envelope, even though I had
followed my postal worker's instruction
and also had plastered a huge TO and

FROM across the label, precisely
because my letters have been mishan
dled in the past.
And, finally, the manager told me
that they at the post office were accus
tomed to dealing with "adults" and
"grown-ups" who would use their "com
mon sense" when mailing a letter.
I was enraged. I happen to be 21
years old and a senior here, which I
assume is just about the age a university
post office should be used to dealing
with. I am old enough to do everything
in this country but serve as President.
And, as for common sense, please
explain to me how a letter takes five
days to get across a 50 foot distance, and
gets damaged in the process, especially
when it was addressed elsewhere.
Ladies and gentlemen standing there
in the post office line as we speak, read
ing this Daily, please beware. Not only
can you expect delays and damage, but

patronizing insults as well. I know that
people are trying to do the best they can,
but that kind of treatment is unaccept
able, insulting and infuriating.
I've got just one word for you: fax.

Swimming team's diet
contributes much less
than Daily article said

I am writing in response to the Jan.
19 article in The Daily on the Bio/Syn
nutrition program used by the Stanford
swim teams.
This nutrition program may in fact be
"cutting edge," but in my experience on
the Stanford men's swimming team, it is
not the case that swimmers who are on

the Bio/Syn diet follow it precisely. The
Daily wrote that "most swimmers are
skeptical about changing their diet so
drastically."
A Stanford swimmer for the past
fours years — two of which were under
the Bio/Syn diet — I can personally
attest that most male swimmers, myself
included, did not come close to following
this diet with rigor. Certain guidelines
and proper techniques for combining
food were made clear to us, but they
generally were not observed.
I do not want to downplay the impor
tance of diet in a swimmer's life, but it is
misleading to suggest that the success of
the Stanford swimming program relies
largely on diet. I believe its success is
due to other revolutionary training tech
niques, team unity and a commitment to
hard work.
