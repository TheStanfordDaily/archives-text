## Bombs, Inaugural balls 
### 
AS THE INAUGURATION ap
proached yesterday, television sta
tions across America wondered
how to split their air time between clips
of the evening sky flashing with fire
crackers on one end of the earth and trac
er bullets at the other.
On the same page, USA Today listed
the Hollywood stars that will flood Wash
ington, and the different types of artillery
that are being used to shell suspicious
installations near Baghdad. The Wash
ington Monument reaches for heaven
while Tomahawk craters dig for hell.
There, processions of families and
friends dressed in black march and
mourn out loud in words we don't under
stand, and here, MTV pumps us up for its
first Inaugural Ball to show how hard we
can work and play at the same time.
This is not meant to slight America, or
criticize its fair accordance with the United
Nations warnings. But the world is too
strange. Yes, the numbers of its cities, pop
ulations, histories and futures are all so
thrilling and wonderful to be a part of, but
what about the individual conscience wan
dering its real and imaginary landscapes?
I guess it's for the best what the U.N.
is doing to Iraq, but it's still hard to rec
oncile any amount of such logic with the
loss of even one innocent life in the lobby
of a hotel in Baghdad.
Was it Stalin that said one death is a
tragedy, and five million is a statistic?

Something like that. The horror of such a
statement resonates too deeply. I find
myself remembering this morning's
CNN camera shot of a man weeping for
his lost wife amidst the ruins of the al
Rashid hotel in Baghdad.
His screams, confusion and blurred
expression — which probably resemble
what we all look like as we slip into the
beginnings of a nightmare during sleep no
matter where we came from. But for those
of us whom Tragedy has not yet invaded,
the transience of such troubled sleep is
what keeps us awake. I myself have been
able to leave any such imaginary hardship
in my pillow when I waken each morning.
But the pillow is swelling. . . .
And the cheers, optimism and smiles
of pit-stop supporters lined between
Monticello and Washington, D.C. I hope
he's as able as he says he is, but certain
doubts are reconfirmed when he reneges
his campaign promise to admit Haitian
refugees to this country.
Again, there is an obvious political
logic to this decision. The Atlantic-bound
refugees crowded in a makeshift boat
that I probably couldn't even sail across
Lake Lag? Camera shots of them ventur
ing into the nighttime seas with no life
jackets and no moonlight? If not here,
they will end up somewhere.
The world is very big, very huge. Fam
ished Somalia, the tent-ridden Palestini
ans, your suffering neighbor or perhaps

yourself for not being as grateful and
happy as you feel you should be.
Does this sound sentimental? I'm
sorry, I know sentimentality is the trap of
Modern Letters. So pretend you're not
reading this. You're hearing it. You're
hearing it from yourself. A small part of
you feels responsible for all that's going
on around you, all that's wrong, all that
you would like to change. But there are
too many people.
When I was a boy I wondered how
heaven could fit all of our dead, and now
I wonder if the earth will be able to. I
guess spirits could pass through each
other with some sort of shudder, but
won't the graveyards someday crowd our
lawns and highways?
Underground rivers of all our blood
run for some opening in the grass or
asphalt, and find none. We are closed off,
the bombed, the drowned, the man who
finally died in his sleep. We enter the pol
itics of oblivion; eternity with each other
is our only logical choice.

Brad Winters occasionally may ponder
life's weighty ironies, the bitterness of
remorse and all imaginable forms of the
hereinafter, but overall, he's one great guy.
