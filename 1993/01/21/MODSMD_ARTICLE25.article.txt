## Senior Hicks adds depth, lift to Cardinal men's basketball 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
A week ago today, Stanford freshman
guard Dion Cross went inside for a shot,
only to have it swatted by Jason Kidd of
California. Jtidd proceeded to boast to
Cross when Kenny Hicks stepped in.
"Anyone can make a block, so I told
him where he could stick his com
ments," Hicks said.
Hicks, a 6-foot-4 senior, is usually
one of the first players called when
coach Mike Montgomery looks to the
bench, and his main job as a reserve is to
use his positive attitude to reinvigorate
his teammates.
"My job coming off the bench is to get
the crowd into it, maybe make some
flashy plays, and to give our teammates
a lift," Hicks said.
That lift oftentimes comes in the
form of defense. Hicks is a quick player
who can shut down the opposition's
main perimeter offensive threat.
Tonight, he will be faced with the chal
lenge of guarding either Mitchell Butler
or Shon Tarver of UCLA, both pre-sea
son All-Pacific 10 Conference selections.
"It pumps me up to play against those
players," Hicks said. "I don't fear any
one. No matter who it is, I'll find a way
to guard you —I'll push, hold, shove. . . .
I go into the game feeling that I'm not
guarding them — they have to take me.
You can't think that they're better than
you, otherwise you'll lose confidence."
Even though Stanford is not having
as much success as Hicks would like,
Hicks takes pride that he is always pre
pared — both mentally and physically —
for each of the Cardinal's games.
"In almost every instance, he's ready
to play," Montgomery said.
"I don't take to losing very well,"
Hicks said. "It's frustrating for me and
for everyone on our team. But feeling
negative isn't the way to go. If I stay
positive, maybe the younger guys will
see that and not get negative when the
chips are down."
Hicks is averaging 4.8 points a game,
and has risen to the occasion against the
tougher opponents on Stanford's sched
ule. Against Virginia, he scored six
points in 11 minutes of play, as well as
scoring eight points against LSU at the
Maui Invitational.
Hicks is still kicking himself for his
one preparation lapse this season, which
occurred on Jan. 12 against Notre

Dame, as he went 0-for-3 from the field
and committed one turnover in Stan
ford's 67-61 defeat.
"I was so upset that I wasn't ready to
play," Hicks said. "I don't like it when I
don't do my job, and we lost, so I take it
personally. That's not going to happen
any more."
Hicks feels that he is gaining his confi
dence back, to the point where observers
will once again take notice as he does one
of his dazzling drives to the hoop.
"As a senior, he provides us with lead
ership," said guard Peter Dukes. "He
comes out and plays hard, he grabs loose
balls, he's a great defender.... When he's
on, he can really make things happen
quickly, and that gives us a big boost."
"Athletically, he gives you better
quickness and speed (on the floor),"
Montgomery said. "For a right-handed
player, he uses his left hand going to the
basket extremely well."
Usually, though, the highlight-film
moves that Hicks makes happen only a
few times at best during the games,
because Montgomery's offense is oriented
towards half-court offensive sets rather
than a loose, freestyle form of play.
"I'm an open court player," Hicks
said. "I'm not a 'set-up-the-offense'
player. I work on emotions.
"I've had to adjust myself to the
(Montgomery) system. There's no room
for creativity for me — that's my game,
that's where my confidence comes from.

I'll push, hold, shove
I go into the game feeling
that I'm not guarding
them — they have to take
me. You can't think that
they're better than you,
otherwise you'll lose
confidence.'
— Kenny Hicks

I like to play in the open court. I con
stantly feel that I'm playing someone
else's game and not my game."
The Sherman Oaks, Calif, native said
he wants to go home this weekend on
his last Southern California roadtrip
and come away with some victories.
"I would like to win at USC, since I
haven't done that since I've been here,"
Hicks said. "I think I made the right deci
sion, maybe not basketball-wise, but in
other ways, in coming to Stanford. I could
have gone to Harvard or Northwestern,
but I would not have fit in with their sys
tems very well. Plus, I didn't like the cold."
Perhaps Hicks will be able to heat up
some Los Angeles gyms one last time
this weekend.

That lift oftentimes comes in the
form of defense. Hicks is a quick player
who can shut down the opposition's
main perimeter offensive threat.
Tonight, he will be faced with the chal
lenge of guarding either Mitchell Butler
or Shon Tarver of UCLA, both pre-sea
son All-Pacific 10 Conference selections.
"It pumps me up to play against those
players," Hicks said. "I don't fear any
one. No matter who it is, I'll find a way
to guard you —I'll push, hold, shove. . . .
I go into the game feeling that I'm not
guarding them — they have to take me.
You can't think that they're better than
you, otherwise you'll lose confidence."
Even though Stanford is not having
as much success as Hicks would like,
Hicks takes pride that he is always pre
pared — both mentally and physically —
for each of the Cardinal's games.
"In almost every instance, he's ready
to play," Montgomery said.
"I don't take to losing very well,"
Hicks said. "It's frustrating for me and
for everyone on our team. But feeling
negative isn't the way to go. If I stay
positive, maybe the younger guys will
see that and not get negative when the
chips are down."
Hicks is averaging 4.8 points a game,
and has risen to the occasion against the
tougher opponents on Stanford's sched
ule. Against Virginia, he scored six
points in 11 minutes of play, as well as
scoring eight points against LSU at the
Maui Invitational.
Hicks is still kicking himself for his
one preparation lapse this season, which
occurred on Jan. 12 against Notre

Dame, as he went 0-for-3 from the field
and committed one turnover in Stan
ford's 67-61 defeat.
"I was so upset that I wasn't ready to
play," Hicks said. "I don't like it when I
don't do my job, and we lost, so I take it
personally. That's not going to happen
any more."
Hicks feels that he is gaining his confi
dence back, to the point where observers
will once again take notice as he does one
of his dazzling drives to the hoop.
"As a senior, he provides us with lead
ership," said guard Peter Dukes. "He
comes out and plays hard, he grabs loose
balls, he's a great defender.... When he's
on, he can really make things happen
quickly, and that gives us a big boost."
"Athletically, he gives you better
quickness and speed (on the floor),"
Montgomery said. "For a right-handed
player, he uses his left hand going to the
basket extremely well."
Usually, though, the highlight-film
moves that Hicks makes happen only a
few times at best during the games,
because Montgomery's offense is oriented
towards half-court offensive sets rather
than a loose, freestyle form of play.
"I'm an open court player," Hicks
said. "I'm not a 'set-up-the-offense'
player. I work on emotions.
"I've had to adjust myself to the
(Montgomery) system. There's no room
for creativity for me — that's my game,
that's where my confidence comes from.

I'll push, hold, shove
I go into the game feeling
that I'm not guarding
them — they have to take
me. You can't think that
they're better than you,
otherwise you'll lose
confidence.'

I like to play in the open court. I con
stantly feel that I'm playing someone
else's game and not my game."
The Sherman Oaks, Calif, native said
he wants to go home this weekend on
his last Southern California roadtrip
and come away with some victories.
"I would like to win at USC, since I
haven't done that since I've been here,"
Hicks said. "I think I made the right deci
sion, maybe not basketball-wise, but in
other ways, in coming to Stanford. I could
have gone to Harvard or Northwestern,
but I would not have fit in with their sys
tems very well. Plus, I didn't like the cold."
Perhaps Hicks will be able to heat up
some Los Angeles gyms one last time
this weekend.
