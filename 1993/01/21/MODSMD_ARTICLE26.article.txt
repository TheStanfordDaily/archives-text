# Stanford Polo charges into season
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
The biggest polo stories in California are usual
ly the ones plastered on the front page of tabloids
involving certain members of the English royal
family. This season, however, the Stanford Men's
Polo Club will try to add a new dimension to the
game's popularity by going after its first national
title.
The Cardinal horsemen started their season
off with flying colors last Friday as they dished
out a 26-0 pummeling to Washington State.
Playing on their home turf, Stanford was led
by junior captain John Harris, who racked up 11
goals. Charging from the forward position, the
platoon between Guy Elliot and Morgan McCar
roll accounted for another 11 goals, as defender
John Mc√üitchie rounded out the scoring with
three goals from the backfield.
"We were able to score so many goals and shut
out the opponent because we communicated with
each other on the field and anticipated the plays,"
said head coach Wes Linfoot. "We played an
unselfish passing game, and that worked wonder
fully against their press."
After beating the Huskies, Stanford rose to the
No. 1 spot in the Western Region established by the

American Polo Association. From here, the club
will finish playing their league matches before
heading to the Regionals over Spring Break. The
top team from each region will battle it out for the
national title in the Final Four held at Texas.
"There's a great possibility that we'll go unde
feated this year, all the way up until the Final
Four," Harris said. "We are returning the same
team from last year, four seasoned veterans. And
that gives us more experience than any other
team in the Western Region.
"We're training hard and trying to shake off the
image of the petunia-garlanded show horses; polo
is a rigorous sport. Hopefully this year we will be a
force to be reckoned with on the collegiate circuit.
If we do go all the way, Stanford will finally break
the stranglehold of the East coast powers."
Last year, the club began its ascent by beating
the perennial polo powerhouse, UC-Davis, en
route to its first appearance in the Final Four.
This weekend the Cardinal will again face off
against Davis. However, this time the Aggies
come in as the underdog after graduating several
key players last year.
Stanford will host Davis at 2 p.m. Sunday in
the Combined Equestrian Training Arena
(CETA) located off Sand Hill Road, three miles
from the Stanford campus.
