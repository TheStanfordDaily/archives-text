# Fencers up for Eastern opponents
## 
### Oscar Dominguez Staff writer 
The 1992-93 Stanford fencing squad begins its
second quarter of competition this week with two
Pennsylvania tournaments. After disposing of UC-
Santa Cruz last quarter, 5-4, 6-3, 3-6 and 10-6, in
men's foil, sabre, epee and women's foil, respective
ly, the squad is poised and ready to take on the best
the East Coast has to offer.
"Fencing against 'SC, the atmosphere is very dif
ferent," said men's head coach Zoran Tulum. "The
score is always 14-13. It's not that one of us is better.
. . we know each other too well."
The men's team held on for the win despite a
strong finish by Santa Cruz in the epee. The women
also added to the combined final score with a strong
showing in foil.
"I got a little worried because 'SC improved a lot,"
said women's head coach Sherry Posthumus.
"Tasha Martin is one of the top five fencers in the
country. She beat Lana (Kang) last year at regionals.
Lana beat her this time."
The women's team is young this year, with three
freshmen on the varsity squad. Posthumus
explained that the fencers look up to their captain,
Kang, and draw confidence from her victories, espe
cially against competition like Santa Cruz and the
Banana Slug's Martin.
With no local meets in the near future, the squad
looks to the East where they will fence their tough

est opponents. Pennsylvania will be hosting a meet
today, featuring Temple, Rutgers and Stanford.
"Temple was last year's NCAA champ with every
one returning," said Posthumus. "But the East
coast doesn't know how much strength we have."
The women will fence Pennsylvania in epee for the
first time in its history. The epee is generally consid
ered only a men's event, but coaches all over the
country are hoping to add it to women's competition.
Posthumus is confident in her team's chances.
"We probably have the strongest (epee) team in
the country right now," she said.
The men have their work cut out for them also, as
their no.l Sabre man, Keith Early, will be ineligible
for competition due to academic problems.
"That's my biggest problem, because he is my top
guy," Tulum said. "But I still have two good sabre
men, and foil is my strongest event."
Individually, the competition will be tough for the
Cardinal men.
"Tamir Bloom of U-Penn is one of the top ep£e
men in the country," Tulum said. "Jeremy Nelson
will give him a good workout."
Fortunately, the Cardinal is not without its own
star fencers, with the presence of Nick Bravin,
Olympian, two-time national champion and NCAA
champion in foil.
"He's known as a team fencer and his good fenc
ing will push the team to do its best," Tulum said.
After today's day-long meet, the squad will travel
to Penn State where they will meet Cornell, Duke,

Northwestern, the University of North Carolina,
Navy, John Hopkins (men only) and Fairleigh Dick
inson (women only).
"Penn State has scholarships and can bring in peo
ple from Europe and Northern California who couldn't
make it here (academically)," Coach Tulum explained.
"Duke and NC are always very close, and Northwest

ern, Navy, Cornell and John Hopkins we can beat."
Because Stanford does not offer fencing scholar
ships, most of their fencers come from P.E. classes.
"Even without money our position in the top 10 is
very gratifying," said Tulum. "We don't have schol
arships and national recruiting. ... All we have is
talent and hard work."
