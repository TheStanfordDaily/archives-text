# Women's hoops heads to UCLA
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
After losing to a top-notch Uni
versity of Southern California
squad earlier in the week, the No.
3 Stanford women's basketball
team will find that its schedule
doesn't get any easier.
The Cardinal (12-3, 3-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference) continues
Pac-10 competition tonight at
Maples Pavilion against UCLA (8-
5, 3-1), a team with which it shares
the second-place position in the
conference. Two nights later,
Stanford will once again square off
against the Trojans as it seeks to
gain revenge in home territory.
Although both UCLA and USC
are sure to provide a tough chal
lenge for the Stanford squad, the
Cardinal will play on its home
court, where it has won 25
straight games. Having thou
sands of screaming supporters
should help pump up Stanford
come warm-up time.
"The adrenaline gets pumping

when you hear the crowd getting
into it," sophomore Rachel Hem
mer explained, moments after
Stanford crushed Cal last week
before a sell-out home crowd.
Despite their mediocre record,
the Bruins have won seven of their
last eight games and have proven
they can keep up with some of the
better teams in the nation.
Much of their recent success can
be accredited to center Natalie
Williams, a two-sport star who
returned to the team in late Decem
ber after leading the UCLA volley
ball squad to a second-place fmish
at the NCAA Championships. Since
joining the basketball team this
season, Williams has led the Bruins
in scoring and rebounding, in all
but one of the nine games in which
she has played.
However, UCLA has demon
strated to its opponents that it is
far from a one-dimensional team.
"They have good three-point
shooters, and their point guard
(Nicole Anderson) drives well,"
said sophomore Anita Kaplan.

"We have to play smart defense."
In its game against USC Mon
day night, the defending national
champion Cardinal showed that
even the best teams have bad
nights. Stanford set season lows
in total points, shooting percent
age and rebounds as it was dis
mantled by the Trojans, 67-55.
"We felt we didn't play well at
all," Kaplan said. "It was just an
off game for the whole team."
While the team knows it is
quite capable of giving a stronger
performance, a more hazy issue is
whether it can shut down junior
Lisa Leslie, who burned the Car
dinal for 27 points on Monday.
CARDINAL NOTES:
Val Whiting is just nine rebounds awuy
from becoming the Pac-10 career
rebound leader. . .The first 1,500 stu
dents will once again be admitted free to
both of the upcoming women's basket
ball games. .. Stanford will be playing
UCLA on Thursday, followed by a game
against USC on Saturday, contrary to
the dates on the printed schedule, which
were switched afler the season's start.
