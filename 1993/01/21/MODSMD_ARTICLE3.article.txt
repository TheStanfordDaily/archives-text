WASHINGTON — At yesterday's
apex of a star-studded Inaugural
week, William Jefferson Clinton be
came the 42nd president of the Unit
ed States with a speech that chal
lenged Americans to boldly change
their country and called for a renewed
dedication to personal sacrifice for
the greater good.
The address, like the entire week's
events, was carefully constructed to
invoked the spirits of Clinton's per
sonal Democratic Hall of Fame:
Thomas Jefferson, FDR, JFK and
MI. K, with a touch of Southern Bap

tist thrown in for good measure.
After an invocation delivered by
the Rev. Billy Graham, the ebullient
crowd that flooded the Mall to witness
the swearing-in on the West steps of
the Capitol Building heard the 46-
year-old president call on the nation,
and especially the nation's youth, to
engage in public service:
"I challenge a new generation of
young Americans to a season of ser
vice. . . . There is much to be done —
enough for millions of others who are
still young in spirit to give of them
selves in service too."

The call alluded to a cornerstone of
Clinton's agenda during the cam
paign — his idea of a national service
plan that, like a domestic peace corps,
would allow students to serve for two
or three years in public-interest jobs
after graduation as a way of paying off
college loans.
Stanford students seem to agree
that the main constraint on their gen
eration that keeps even idealists from
public service is the economic necessi
ty of paying off burdensome debts
