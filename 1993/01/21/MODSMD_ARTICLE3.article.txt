WASHINGTON — At yesterday's
apex of a star-studded Inaugural
week, William Jefferson Clinton be
came the 42nd president of the Unit
ed States with a speech that chal
lenged Americans to boldly change
their country and called for a renewed
dedication to personal sacrifice for
the greater good.
The address, like the entire week's
events, was carefully constructed to
invoked the spirits of Clinton's per
sonal Democratic Hall of Fame:
Thomas Jefferson, FDR, JFK and
MI. K, with a touch of Southern Bap

tist thrown in for good measure.
After an invocation delivered by
the Rev. Billy Graham, the ebullient
crowd that flooded the Mall to witness
the swearing-in on the West steps of
the Capitol Building heard the 46-
year-old president call on the nation,
and especially the nation's youth, to
engage in public service:
"I challenge a new generation of
young Americans to a season of ser
vice. . . . There is much to be done —
enough for millions of others who are
still young in spirit to give of them
selves in service too."

The call alluded to a cornerstone of
Clinton's agenda during the cam
paign — his idea of a national service
plan that, like a domestic peace corps,
would allow students to serve for two
or three years in public-interest jobs
after graduation as a way of paying off
college loans.
Stanford students seem to agree
that the main constraint on their gen
eration that keeps even idealists from
public service is the economic necessi
ty of paying off burdensome debts

from college.
"Most people are idealistic
until they have to start paying
income taxes," said senior Justin
Hayes. "There's a lot of idealism
among people in college, but I
know a lot of idealistic people who
have graduated from college and
said 'I've got to start paying off
my debt.' "
"Hopefully a fever of optimism
will take over in this nation, and
hopefully it will prevail," said
junior Mike Brylawski.
There was a sense among
Stanford students that they have
a greater stake in the new admin
istration than in any prior one.
"This administration is
younger and more in tune," said
Brylawski.
"This is the first president who
I've voted for who has won," said
Quan Phung, Class of '92. "I feel
like I'm invested in this president
and his performance will test my
ability to judge people."
One Stanford graduate who
has a very concrete stake in the
Clinton presidency is Cheryl
Mills, Stanford Law School class
of '90, who was recently named
Associate White House Counsel.
"He's going to be a very excit
ing president. It's weird, it's
almost freaky in this day and age
— he's a true listener, and that's
very rare."
Clinton's address was more
focused and effective than his
speech at the Democratic Nation
al Convention in July, even if it
lacked the natural ease and flour
ish of previous inaugural address
es on which it was modelled.

Clinton, like President Kennedy,
sounded the theme of public respon
sibility, and used the Kennedyesque
term "My fellow citizens ..."
But his address lacked
Kennedy's natural oratorical
style as well as a phrase as memo
rable as Kennedy's "My fellow
Americans, ask not what your
country.. ."
Instead, Clinton used the
rather forced image of a new
spring in the middle of winter as a
metaphor for the "season of
change" in America.
Just as the references to late
American leaders evoked the sym
bolism of the past week's visit to
Monticello, concert at the Lincoln
Memorial, and bell ringing at the
Jefferson Memorial, the speech
also was a product of the presi
dential campaign of the last year.
Clinton included elements of
well-worn campaign oratory such
as his premise that the country
has gone awry under the past 12
years of Republican rule, while
adding a dose of the Ross Perot
influenced populism.
After saluting former Presi
dent Bush for 25 years of public
service, Clinton said in reference
to the Reagan/Bush years: "We
know we have to face hard truths
and take strong steps. But we
have not done so. Instead, we
have drifted, and that drifting has
eroded our resources, fractured
our economy and shaken our con
fidence."
Clinton received loud applause
when, in a statement that owed
much to Ross Perot, he described
Washington, D.C., as "a place of
intrigue and calculation," where
"powerful people maneuver for
position . . . forgetting the people
whose toil and sweat sends them
here and pays their way."
