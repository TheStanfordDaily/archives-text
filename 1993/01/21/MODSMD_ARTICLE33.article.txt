### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
Officials suspect that a 4-
month old who died in a campus
day care center on Tuesday may
have been stricken by Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome.
Although the exact cause will
not be known until a coroner's
examination is completed in sev
eral days, the circumstances of
Zachary Kung's death point to
SIDS, according to Kathleen Sul
livan, director of child and family
services for the University.
SIDS strikes approximately 1
in 1,000 infants in their first
year. Infants who die of SIDS
suddenly stop breathing while
asleep, and medical experts have
not determined any cause or
treatment.
Kung, the son of medical
school student Andrew Li-jen
Kung and his wife Cynthia,
apparently stopped breathing
while taking a nap in a crib at the
Arboretum Children's Center
early Tuesday afternoon.
After the child was discovered
by child-care personnel, another
child's parent who is a doctor and
was at the center began car

diopulmonary resuscitation,
according to Sullivan.
"We did everything we should
do," Sullivan said. "All of our
staff is trained to do CPR, but
another mother who is a physi
cian happened to be at the cen
ter. . . . We couldn't have done
anything more."
Paramedics transported the
infant to the emergency room at
Stanford Hospital, where he was
pronounced dead at 1:18 p.m.
"It was a terrible tragedy, and
we are providing support for the
family as well as for the staff at
the center," Sullivan said. "Par
ents of other children in the cen
ter have . . . been very support
ive."
The center, which opened in
1988, provides daytime care for
approximately 150 children
(aged two months to five years
old) of students and campus
employees.
The center is overseen by an
independent, non-profit board
composed of parents whose chil
dren attend the center and rep
resentatives from the Universi
ty, the hospital and the Lucile
Salter Packard Children's Hos
pital.
