Beyond Erotica:
A Madonna film
with a plot (not)

Body of Evidence

Don't be fooled: "Body of Evidence" is
every bit as cheesy as its title. Both sequel and
remake of "Basic Instinct," this blatant
Madonna vehicle is as predictable as it is im
probable, a slick ride through all-too-famil
iar territory.
Appropriately, Madonna first appears on
a TV screen, though it's not initially clear
whether the image is a pornographic home
movie or a badly-dubbed version of the
"Erotica" video.
Unfortunately, the effect doesn't last.
"Body of Evidence" would have been infi
nitely more entertaining as a music video. As
is, it's more like a Madonna album: beauti
fully produced, without an original thought
in its platinum-blonde head.
Madonna plays Rebecca Carlson, a Port
land gallery owner on trial for murdering
her elderly millionaire lover with sex and a
little cocaine on the side. Lawyer Frank De
laney (an utterly forgettable performance by
Willem Dafoe) is faced with the seemingly
impossible task of defending her. Mean
while, the two do the nasty in more ways,
shapes and places than the entire cast of
"Damage."
Already, this "Body's" flaws are evident.
Do they even have galleries in Portland?
Whatever happened to professional ethics?
And the whole thing hinges on a body-as
murder-weapon theory that wouldn't hold
up in"The People's Court."
But courtroom drama is quickly aban
doned as the movie degenerates into a series
of tawdry S&M tableaux. Many of the scenes
are straight out of "Sex," and just as static.
In fact, "Body of Evidence" could easily be
described as nothing more than a giant in
fomercial for Madonna's book — for
Madonna in general. See Madonna naked!
See Madonna handcuffed! See Madonna
masturbate! It's enough to drive a person to
celibacy.
Like too many of Madonna's movies,
"Body of Evidence" gets better as it gets

worse. One gets the feeling that she's not tak
ing herself very seriously as she spits out lines
like, "That's what I do — fuck."
Then again, who could take this movie se
riously? Not Joe Mantegna, who wears a per
petually bemused smirk as the smarmy, sar
donic prosecutor. Not screenwriter Brad
Mirman, whose pseudo-suggestive plati
tudes go limp upon leaving the mouth. "I
never know why men lie," Rebecca coos.
"They just do. Men. Lie."
And women fuck? Like everything else
about this movie, I just don't buy it.

Worst nightmare
come true: Plane
crash, cannibals

Alive

"Are we supposed to fly that close to the
mountain?"
Evidently not. The result is an oddly realis
tic plane crash which leaves the survivors
stranded atop the desolate, snow-covered
Tinguiririca volcano in the Andes Mountains.
"Alive" is based on a 1972 incident in which
members of a Uruguayan rugby team, their
plane downed and without hope of rescue,
struggled to survive sub-zero temperatures
and starvation while trying to reach help.
Those who survived told their story to

writer Piers Paul Read, on whose novel of the
same name the film is based. Overshadowing
the film is the much publicized fact that the
starving survivors resorted to cannibalizing
their dead. (But how many people would see
the movie if this wasn't the case?)
"Alive" is actually at its best when it deals
with harrowing details like cannibalism. To its
credit, the film stays true to the real life story. It
neither sensationalizes, nor allows the disturb
ing issue to sink away in Disney-like fashion.
Instead, it places the painful violation of
taboo in the context of survival. In one scene,

the team builds a fire using their paper cur
rency and a guitar, reminding us that the
structures of civilization, even psychological
prohibitions, quickly fall apart under the
threat of extinction.
This is no simple re-ordering of priorities
— Robinson Crusoe valuing an axe more
than gold. Rather, the characters face a pro
found violation of the sacred. "What will our
friends think of us?" they ask. Perhaps it is a
test of God, one survivor suggests, "to see if we
remain civilized."
Remarkably, the characters both survive
and remain civilized. In turning their necessi
ty into a kind of communion — a pact that,
upon death, each will give his body so the oth
ers might live — they discover that ritual is
not just a stagnant set of useless taboos, but a
way to face the simple, ugly fact that man is
matter: We must eat or die.
Truth is often stranger than fiction; the
most brutal realities are often the most unbe
lievable. And "Alive" succeeds best when it
presents brutality face on.
The film falls short when it interprets the
facts for us and gives us sweeping musical
scores and slick action scenes. It may be that
the truth in "Alive" cannot be conveyed.
"Alive" is a strong, largely successful at
tempt. But when it does not work, it seems
not only less than real, but also less than fic
tional. The most the kid in the seat next to me
could muster for a reaction was,
"Mmm... .yummy butt."

Junkie's story of
self-destruction:
It's one bad flick

Bad Lieutenant

He snorts coke after dropping the kids off
at school. He snorts coke on the job. He
snorts coke while doing two junkie babes
and chugging a bottle of vodka in the dingy
pad which symbolizes the secret life his wife
and four kids will never discover.
One could argue that writers Abel Ferrara
and Zoe Lund meant for "Bad Lieutenant" to
capture the self-absorbed, downward spiral

of a successful professional hopelessly hooked
on drugs. That would explain the plot — scene
after scene after scene of the lieutenant (Harvey
Keitel) getting high before finally self-destruct
ing.
One could argue that the story revolves
around the lieutenant, so he and the audience
share the same point of view. That would ex
plain how he, a member of the narcotics squad,
can arrive late to every crime scene — sniffling,
pupils dilated, concentrating more on the find
than the case at hand — while none of his fel
low narcotics cops say anything, or even notice.
The lieutenant is in his own little drugged
out world. No one will ever comment on his
condition because denial tells him he's still in
control, right?
Okay, let's pretend Ferrara and Lund's noble
and artistic mission was solely to focus on the
lieutenant's addiction.
Well, to put it succinctly, they didn't accom
plish it. In fact, they fell shorter than Keitel's
jimmy.
The simplistic symbolism of the rape of a
nun — dcpictcd by the quick cuts and skewed
angles of a music video — combined with
laughable scenes of Jesus writhing on the cross
and, later, reaching out to the lieutenant in for
giveness, scream, "novice writer, novice writer."
Also, the startling inconsistencies within the
lieutenant and the story itself only further re
duce the film's credibility, rendering it impo
tent as a stylized view of one man's degenera
tion and inevitable self-destruction.
In the only powerful scene of the entire film,
the lieutenant pulls over two young girls in a
stolen BMW and forces them to expose them

selves, then mime sucking a man's penis while
he masturbates outside their car.
Yet, scenes earlier, this same man convinces
fellow officers not to post a $30,000 reward for
the capture of the nun's rapists, arguing that,
simply because of her status, the nun would be
valued more highly than other women who
have suffered the same trauma.
the lieutenant leaves his fingerprints
all over the rape scene — most noticeably on a
Nativity figurine — before falling asleep in the
pews. The next morning, an investigator dusts

the very same figurine for prints, but does not
find his. No one ever notices that the lieutenant
has a problem. No one.
No matter how cleverly Ferrara and Lund
may have captured the excruciating,
Kafkaesque deterioration of a hardcore junkie,
artistic license will never pardon poor writing.

Same dumb plot:
Helpless woman
rescued by hunk

Nowhere to Run

The latest Jean-Claude Van Damme
movie, "Nowhere to Run," may please the
actor's most ardent fans. The film offers
them an opportunity to watch him flex his
macho muscles, karate chop several bad guys
and French kiss the damsel in distress.
However, even the endless shots of his un
clothed body cannot compensate for the
movie's outrageously bad plot and acting.
The story begins as convict Sam (Van
Damme) escapes from a high-security vehi
cle, flees to a nearby town and hides in the
woods.
Sam does not remain in hiding for long.
He soon discovers that the woods belong to
Clydie (Rosanna Arquette), a pretty young
widow who refuses to sell her family's prop
erty to the town's evil condominium devel
opers. Just as the bad guys start to exert heavy
pressure on her, Sam comes to the rescue.

As it strays from the action-adventure
prototype, "Nowhere" begins to flail. In
stead of letting Van Damme pull spectacular
stunts and demolish all the bad guys, direc
tor Robert Harmon and the screenwriters
try to make him a lovable, fatherly character.
They fail in part because they initially
portray him as a sleazy peeping Tom who
reads porno magazines — an unlikely hero
at best. Sam supposedly experiences an
about-face in character when he becomes
the object of Clydie's son Mookie's (Kieran
Culkin) affection.
Van Damme's poor acting makes it im
possible to accept such a far-fetched premise.
His vacant stares and emotionless dialogue
make Sam appear incapable of empathy.
Clydie's and Mookie's love for him seems in
explicable.
Even those prepared to suspend their dis
belief about the faulty plot and plastic char
acters will be disappointed by "Nowhere"'s
action scenes. Van Damme performs some
skillful martial arts moves, but unfortunate
ly does nothing new or different.
Several of the action sequences seem
pulled directly from other adventure
movies. The initial escape from the armed
police bus looks strikingly like a scene from
"Patriot Games," and the episode in which
the entire state police force races after Sam
closely resembles the final car chase in
"Thelma and Louise."
The big-strong-man-rescues-helpless
woman formula must do something unusu
al or spectacular in order to work. "Nowhere
to Run" does nothing spectacular; in fact, it
does nothing even remotely interesting.
