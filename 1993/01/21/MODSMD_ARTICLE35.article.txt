Beyond Erotica:
A Madonna film
with a plot (not)

Body of Evidence

Don't be fooled: "Body of Evidence" is
every bit as cheesy as its title. Both sequel and
remake of "Basic Instinct," this blatant
Madonna vehicle is as predictable as it is im
probable, a slick ride through all-too-famil
iar territory.
Appropriately, Madonna first appears on
a TV screen, though it's not initially clear
whether the image is a pornographic home
movie or a badly-dubbed version of the
"Erotica" video.
Unfortunately, the effect doesn't last.
"Body of Evidence" would have been infi
nitely more entertaining as a music video. As
is, it's more like a Madonna album: beauti
fully produced, without an original thought
in its platinum-blonde head.
Madonna plays Rebecca Carlson, a Port
land gallery owner on trial for murdering
her elderly millionaire lover with sex and a
little cocaine on the side. Lawyer Frank De
laney (an utterly forgettable performance by
Willem Dafoe) is faced with the seemingly
impossible task of defending her. Mean
while, the two do the nasty in more ways,
shapes and places than the entire cast of
"Damage."
Already, this "Body's" flaws are evident.
Do they even have galleries in Portland?
Whatever happened to professional ethics?
And the whole thing hinges on a body-as
murder-weapon theory that wouldn't hold
up in"The People's Court."
But courtroom drama is quickly aban
doned as the movie degenerates into a series
of tawdry S&M tableaux. Many of the scenes
are straight out of "Sex," and just as static.
In fact, "Body of Evidence" could easily be
described as nothing more than a giant in
fomercial for Madonna's book — for
Madonna in general. See Madonna naked!
See Madonna handcuffed! See Madonna
masturbate! It's enough to drive a person to
celibacy.
Like too many of Madonna's movies,
"Body of Evidence" gets better as it gets

worse. One gets the feeling that she's not tak
ing herself very seriously as she spits out lines
like, "That's what I do — fuck."
Then again, who could take this movie se
riously? Not Joe Mantegna, who wears a per
petually bemused smirk as the smarmy, sar
donic prosecutor. Not screenwriter Brad
Mirman, whose pseudo-suggestive plati
tudes go limp upon leaving the mouth. "I
never know why men lie," Rebecca coos.
"They just do. Men. Lie."
And women fuck? Like everything else
about this movie, I just don't buy it.

Worst nightmare
come true: Plane
crash, cannibals

Alive

"Are we supposed to fly that close to the
mountain?"
Evidently not. The result is an oddly realis
tic plane crash which leaves the survivors
stranded atop the desolate, snow-covered
Tinguiririca volcano in the Andes Mountains.
"Alive" is based on a 1972 incident in which
members of a Uruguayan rugby team, their
plane downed and without hope of rescue,
struggled to survive sub-zero temperatures
and starvation while trying to reach help.
Those who survived told their story to

writer Piers Paul Read, on whose novel of the
same name the film is based. Overshadowing
the film is the much publicized fact that the
starving survivors resorted to cannibalizing
their dead. (But how many people would see
the movie if this wasn't the case?)
"Alive" is actually at its best when it deals
with harrowing details like cannibalism. To its
credit, the film stays true to the real life story. It
neither sensationalizes, nor allows the disturb
ing issue to sink away in Disney-like fashion.
Instead, it places the painful violation of
taboo in the context of survival. In one scene,

the team builds a fire using their paper cur
rency and a guitar, reminding us that the
structures of civilization, even psychological
prohibitions, quickly fall apart under the
threat of extinction.
This is no simple re-ordering of priorities
— Robinson Crusoe valuing an axe more
than gold. Rather, the characters face a pro
found violation of the sacred. "What will our
friends think of us?" they ask. Perhaps it is a
test of God, one survivor suggests, "to see if we
remain civilized."
Remarkably, the characters both survive
and remain civilized. In turning their necessi
ty into a kind of communion — a pact that,
upon death, each will give his body so the oth
ers might live — they discover that ritual is
not just a stagnant set of useless taboos, but a
way to face the simple, ugly fact that man is
matter: We must eat or die.
Truth is often stranger than fiction; the
most brutal realities are often the most unbe
lievable. And "Alive" succeeds best when it
presents brutality face on.
The film falls short when it interprets the
facts for us and gives us sweeping musical
scores and slick action scenes. It may be that
the truth in "Alive" cannot be conveyed.
"Alive" is a strong, largely successful at
tempt. But when it does not work, it seems
not only less than real, but also less than fic
tional. The most the kid in the seat next to me
could muster for a reaction was,
"Mmm... .yummy butt."

Junkie's story of
self-destruction:
It's one bad flick

Bad Lieutenant

He snorts coke after dropping the kids off
at school. He snorts coke on the job. He
snorts coke while doing two junkie babes
and chugging a bottle of vodka in the dingy
pad which symbolizes the secret life his wife
and four kids will never discover.
One could argue that writers Abel Ferrara
and Zoe Lund meant for "Bad Lieutenant" to
capture the self-absorbed, downward spiral
