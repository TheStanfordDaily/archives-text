'That girl' shines
in frenzied, loud
New York story

Six Degrees of Separation

At a time when original plots are relegat
ed to trying to find another subtle twist to
the "90210" plot, Americas best writers have
turned to reality as the source of their fanta
sy. And a kid impersonating Sidney Poitiers
son in order to mooch room and board from
families on the upper west side of Manhattan
seems as ripe a news clipping as any.
The tension in John Guare's "Six Degrees

of Separation" reeks of New York: hypocrisy,
race relations, greed and the rest of the lone
ly-in-a-city-of-six-million irony. But, other
than the recurring joke about "Cats," the au
dience never feels alienated from the action;
somehow, in the two years since it was writ
ten, New York's problems have become the
country's.
The play comes to life through the direc
tion of Jerry Zaks', who has tightened up the
performance since it first appeared in Lin
coln Center. The play moves quickly, almost
spastically, and at points there are as many
as nine people on the stage at once — most
of them talking simultaneously.
But Zaks avoids the arms of absurdism
into which the play seems constantly to try to
seek shelter; Zaks forces the audience to em
pathize with characters who are blatantly di
vorced from reality. When the Dartmouth
kid stands in the juliet, yelling at his father,
"You're a cretin. No wonder Mom left you,"
it all seems a believable interpretation of real
life. And he never lets the energy level drop.
Mario Thomas does a fantastic job at
playing of a lonely woman trapped in an
apartment of art-turned-plastic. She's even
more successful in making us forget she was
both "That Girl" and the campy feminist
cheerleader of "Free to Be You and Me" —
without losing any of the innocent charm
from her association with those roles.
Although the play's ending may not deliv
er all the energy and tension promised, it re
mains provocative until the curtain closes.
Somewhere along the writing process, Guare
realized it's better to be vague than didactic.
Performances run through Jan. 31 at the
Curran Theatre, 445 Geary in San Francisco
Tickets ($l2-42) are available through BASS.

Even when she has company — in this case Paul (Ntare Mwine) — Ouisa (Mario
Thomas) is a lonely woman in "Six Degrees of Separation."
