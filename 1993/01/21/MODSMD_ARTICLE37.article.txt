# Honest, but likable too: 'Barry Does Japan' gently criticizes Americans and Japanese
## 
### Joel Stein Editorial staff 
Dave Barry is the kind of guy
who was smart, funny and
nonthreatening enough to
be class clown and teacher's pet.
And, like in high school, what
comes out most in both his humor
columns and his books is his desire
to be likeable.
Although East Coast-bred, his
humor (in contrast to the metropol
itan sarcasm of Indiana's David Let
terman) is white-bread middle-
America; he pulls you into the joke
instead of attacking you with it. He's
the type of guy who hands his plate
back to the guy behind the sushi bar,
tells him "it's a little undercooked"
and giggles through the rest of the
meal.
lust the type of guy a bunch of
stuffed shirts at Random House
would think it would be funny to
send to Japan for a couple of
weeks.

While "Dave Barry Does
Japan" softly ridicules Ameri
cans' fear and confusion about
the Japanese, he also dishes
out his own dose of mockery
of the Japanese — just to
make sure we know he's just

one of us.
"I've always wanted to b<
someone who's in the same
world as my readers,"
Barry willfully admits.
"Not someone who's col
umn is by virtue of the
fact that he was some

special insight or wis
dom that they don't have

— someone who's al
ways writing about
how he had dinner

with the prime minister of Israel."
Barry pauses for a moment, as if
the prospect of offending the prime
minister of Israel has eclipsed his
thoughts.
"I mean if the prime minister of
Israel is ever in Miami, he's welcome
to my house, but it's not likely to
happen."
He leans back in his chair,
pleased, with his apology, confident
he will remain likeable in Israel.
The book, of course, offers no
more insight into Japan than those
cute little anecdotes that always ap
pear in the middle column of the
Wall Street Journal. And like those
articles, the book constantly oscil
lates between mockery and rever
ence of Japanese culture:
One afternoon in Tokyo we walked
past a man who was down on his knees
on the sidewalk cleaning a public
trash can Can you imagine any
body doing that job in the United
States? Can you imagine that job even
existing. No chance! I sure as hell
wouldn't do that job. Neither would
you. Nobody would. It would be be
neath everybody's dignity. If a judge

sentenced convicted child-murderers
to do that job, they'd file lawsuits al
leging cruel and unusual punishment.
But gentle observation seems to
be enough of a goal for the book,
with its wide margins and giant font;
you don't expect anything more be
cause Barry is careful never to
promise anything more.
"1 have no goal to uplift or en
lighten or impart knowledge or
make the world a better place in
which to live," Barry explains. "I
view myself as very much similar to
Gary Larson. No one would ever say,
'Millions of people are reached by
Far Side cartoons so maybe you
should put

something in
there about ending hunger.'

"1 guess I could put a fortune
cookie thing at the end. Or 1 could
end it by telling them the capital of
Vermont," he ponders, content with
the thought. "That would be a good
ending."
But, despite his modest claims,
even Barry can't help but throw in a
healthy bit of didacticism to end a
book on the Risen Sun:
Japan isn't our enemy. That notion
is racist and stupid. Japan had noth
ing to do with creating our monster
national debt, or wrecking our cities,
or dumbing down our schools, or
making so many of us hate and fear
each other.... And if we're going to
solve our problems, we could probably
stand to take a few lessons from the
Japanese, about things like respect
and responsibility.
But somehow, even this is bear
able coming from Barry; it's like our
buddy from the office went to Japan
with his family, tried Sapporo, did
some honest-to-God thinking and
just wanted to share it with us after

the slide show was over.
And it's a pretty good slide show.
"Dave Barry Does Japan" isn't his
best book, or his most creative idea,
but everything in it is fresh material
— compared to the column-compi
lations he occasionally puts out
under a hard cover. And, unlike those
volumes — which feel incomplete as
they jump from topic to topic — the
narrative nature allows Barry room
to return to a joke and expand upon
it. And it's nice to see Barry stretch
out, even if his strongest talent may
lie in the soft, quick jabs which per
vade his columns.
"I like writing columns better be
cause it's quicker, you're done with
it, it's out there, and you go on to

something new,"
Barry confesses
with a childlike

enthusiasm com
patible with his at
tention span.
"With a book I have
to be a little more

coherent — al
though, in the case of
my books, not a
whole lot more coher-

ent — but somewhat
more. And the topic
has to be a topic.
They're very strict."
Barry says he

plans to plug along his
book-a-year path while
continuing his weekly

syndicated columns,
which he says take him

about 12 hours each. But
the books, he promises,
will continue to be sopho
moric; he fears the novel be-

cause it is too big, too artis
tic, too pretentious — too
unlikeable. The Great Ameri
can novel is not the project of

a class clown.
"To me that's kind of like, "Hey I
won an Olympic gold medal for div
ing, I think I'll play the violin for the
symphony orchestra," he explains,
fearing his novel would turn out like
Kirk Douglas' latest contribution to
the art form.
"1 don't know why I'd suddenly
be able to do it with no practice
whatsoever. I guess I would have a
little advantage on Kirk Douglas be
cause I've written down more words
than he has. The words he's proba
bly written down are "Kirk Douglas'
or "Best Wishes: Kirk Douglas."
"Dave Barry Does Japan" does
not highlight all of Dave Barry's po
tential. But it shows off enough of it,
like a second grader at a piano
recital. And for a man who describes
himself as a regular neighbor and
dad — only "lanky and cruelly
handsome" — it may be enough to
just keep his writing safe enough to
make sure we continue to like him.
The capital of Vermont is Mont
pelier.
