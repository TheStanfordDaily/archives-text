Called "The Spring Festival" in
China, the first day of the Lunar
New Year is also supposedly the
coldest day of winter, which means
the rest of the year can only get warmer.
The Lunar New Year isn't just celebrated in
China, though. Most people call it "Chinese
New Year" because of the population and

history of the Chinese
in the United States, says
A.sian American Activity

Center director Rick Yuen.
However, more and more

people now more accurately
call it the "Lunar New Year,"
which Yuen believes reflects changing demo
graphics.
Madeleine Lu, co-chair of culture and edu
cation for the Asian American Student
Association, says that although it is mainly
the Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese cultures
that celebrate the Lunar New Year, AASA
includes all Asian groups in its annual dinner
and performance party.
"The Lunar New Year Celebration brings
us all together, and that's what makes it
AASA's most important event in winter quar
ter," Lu says.

Like most "delicacies" your parents
tried to make you eat as a kid, tra
ditional New Year fare is an
acquired taste. According to Linh
Cao, a member of the Stanford Vietnamese
Society, a common New Year food is bank
trung. Literally translated as "decoration
cakes," they are rice cakes wrapped in bam
boo leaves with rice, mung bean paste and
pork.
"Most people don't really like to eat them,"
Cao says. "They're kind of bland and boring.
When someone gives you bank trung, it's
really the thought that counts. It's a labor of
love; they're such a pain to make."
Senior Rick Bang describes the Korean tra
ditional New Year food duk kuk as "a bland
soup with beef and oval-shaped flattened
rice/dough things."
Don't expect bank trung and duk kuk at the
Lunar Celebration, though. As the menu
reflects, tradition is often compromised by
convenience — and second-generation taste
buds.
"The soup would be really hard to coordi
nate. We usually serve kalbi (marinated beef)
because it's the easiest thing for us to cater...
kalbi is a very popular Korean food, so it's
not like people wouldn't eat it on New Year
's," Bang says.

What would a feast be without
the fun? In previous years
the Lunar Celebration at
Stanford has featured tradi
tional lion and dragon dances and drum
troupes. All three performances are designed
both to celebrate the New Year and to scare
away evil spirits.
Other traditional dances include the
Chinese Folkdance's fan dance, and the
Stanford Vietnamese umbrella/hat/basket
dance. According to Cao, in Vietnam pale
ness is considered veiy feminine, and thus,
the umbrellas and hats represent femininity,
as do the baskets filled with flowers.
A combination of both traditional and
modern culture, Stanford's UCAAppella (an
offshoot of the Undergraduate Chinese
American Association) sings folk songs in
both English and Chinese. "The tra
ditional New Year's song wishes people pros
perity, encourages them to be merry and
dance around in the streets," says sophomore
Candace Tom.
A Korean American Student Association
skit in 1991 depicted what happens on New
Year's day in a typical Korean-American fam
ily: the parents sit cross-legged on the floor,
the children bow to them, and the parents
give the children "good-luck money" in
bright red envelopes.
Sounds like a good deal, doesn't it?
"The best thing about the skit was that it
joined slapstick humor with traditional cul
ture" Bang says. "One of the 'children' was
very irreverent and gave a sloppy bow;
instead of money, his father hit him over the
head with a newspaper."

While many Stanford students
celebrate the Lunar New Year
as an appreciation of their
Asian-American heritage, for
many international students, the celebrations
do more than pay homage to tradition.
"The Spring Festival is the most important
celebration in China. It lasts two weeks and
you get four days of holiday," says Gia Wu, a
sophomore transfer student from Beijing.
Olivia Ouyang, also a transfer student
from Beijing, adds that the four-day holiday
is also very practical.
"The New Year is really the only time our
whole family is together. I get to talk to my
parents a lot about things that are impor- ■
tant," Ouyang remarks.
"Also, on the first day, it is traditional for
the bosses to go to their employees' houses
and greet them with a happy New Year;
neighbors greet neighbors, and relatives
other relatives. In this way people create
good relations."
"On the second day, the mother goes to
her mother's house" as a kind of homecom
ing, since many married women become part
of their husbands' families. "There is always
very heavy traffic on this day," Ouyang says.

lthough cheek to cheek public
transportation with thousands
°112 your closest friends and rel
%atives isn't that common in the
Wiited States, other features of the Lunar
New Year have carried over directly into
Chinese-American culture.
For example, in San Francisco's Chinatown
— the largest in the United States — many
shops post bright gold and red signs with
Chinese calligraphy characters such as "good
fortune," "prosperity" and "special blessing."
In China, Wu says that people often hang
the word "Good Fortune" on their doors up
side down. Inverted, the character means
"Come"
According to Wu, the Chinese love puns, as
tonal shifts give ample opportunity; the same

word pronounced different ways can yield up
to four separate meanings. In Beijing the
streets are illuminated with paper lanterns in
which people have written "riddles" If you
think you have the answer to the riddle, you
can fill out a form and turn it into an office
where prizes are awarded, Wu says.
Wu and Ouyang agree that one of the most
prominent features of the two-week celebra
tion are the fairs in the parks.
"There is a lot of food, performances by
magicians, people who can stand on balloons
without breaking them, who can lay on nee
dles without being hurt, people practicing
martial arts, and puppet shows for children,"
Ouyang says.
"For kids, the festivals mean food, gifts and
fire-crackers," Wu adds.

1 I ow many New Year's Eves have
I I you spent with Dick Clark?
I Although watching other people
I party while you drink
Martinelli's with your parents and little
brother may not be your idea of fun, it's
become a recent tradition in China to spend
New Year's Eve watching a television show
featuring China's most popular entertain
ment figures.
"In China we don't normally have televi
sion that you can watch all night. Every day
programs end at midnight. But on New Year
s Eve, you can watch television all night. So
it's really something special," says Ouyang.
She adds that New Year's Eve is the biggest
party on television, "featuring famous
celebrities — singers, dancers, and actors."

enough, one of the
I most popular traditions of the Bay
4 I Area's Chinese-Americans may
not have any connection to cele
bratory events in China. While Chinese
Chamber of Commerce representative
Wayne Hu estimates a crowd of 500,000 peo
ple at this year's Chinese New Year Parade,
Ouyang and Wu state that New Year parades
just don't happen in China.
However, as far back as 1850, San
Francisco's Chinese community has celebrat
ed the Lunar New Year with a parade. Today,
San Francisco's parade is the largest Lunar
New Year event outside of Asia, and one of
the few night-illuminated parades in the
United States.
Parade co-chairman Hu says over the past
five years the parade has been visited by light
drizzle to outright downpour. "It's actually
good luck because the dragon is is a water
creature."
"Besides," he adds, "this year we've bought
450 umbrellas for our VIP guests and staff—
so maybe it won't rain after all."
Siegrid Liu, the UCAA's cultural chair,
encourages "everybody who's interested" to
join UCAA's annual trip to the City for the
parade on Feb. 6, the last day of the New Year
celebration.
"Last year we had about 60 people show up
for the dinner, then we watched the parade,

and about 30 of us spent
the night at the Westin
Saint Francis," Liu says. V
"It's really beautiful V
because the city is all lit
up and there's an enthusi
astic crowd," Liu says. "It's
crowded, noisy and full of
colorful floats, drums and
firecrackers"
Even if you can't make it to

the parade or have a big dinner
with your family and friends, you can still cel
ebrate the New Year by keeping a few things
in mind. Sweep out any of last year's evil spir-

its before the celebration
begins. On New Year's day,
wear your best clothes, be
nice to your room-
Sj mates and hope that
they're nice back to
you: According to tradi
tion, the first day of the
New Year sets a model
for the rest of the year.
