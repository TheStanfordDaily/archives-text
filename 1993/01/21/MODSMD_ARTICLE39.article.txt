# Animal Astrology

1993 is the year of the Rooster, which,
according to Chinese prophets, signals
optimism and potential. Supposedly, peo
ple born on the Year of the Rooster are
flamboyant and proud, as well as selfish and
eccentric. Sound like anyone you know?

According to legend,
Buddha called all the ani-

mals to say goodbye to him before he depart
ed from the earth. Only 12 animals came: the
Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse,
Ram, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Boar. In
appreciation, Buddha named a year after each

of the animals in order of their arrival.
Chinese astrology is based on a 12-
year cycle. Thus, people born in

1972 or 1960 (or any other
multiple of 12) are Rats; peo-

ple born in 1973 or 1961 are
Oxen, etc.

The mythology
lurking behind the ani
mal signifying your birth
year is as reliable as it is
logical:

• Rat: Charming,
social. Nervous, quick
tempered.
• Ox: Dependable,
patient, precise.

•Tiger; A rebel
without a cause.
Attractive but irre
sponsible.
• Cat; Reserved,
poised. Sociable,
superficial.
• Dragon: Lively,

idealistic. Demanding but giving.
• Snake: Romantic, funny, intellectual,

possessive.
• Horse: Athletic, independent, self-centered.
• Goat: Artistic, pessimistic, capricious.
• Monkey: High-spirited and mischievous.
• Dog: Intelligent, determined. Guarded, critical.
• Boar: Sincere, gullible, a good sport.
