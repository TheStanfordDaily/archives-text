# Doctors find drug to avert artery disease
## 
### Andy Dworkin Staff writer 
Stanford doctors have found
that a common anti-hyperten
sion drug may prevent coronary
artery disease in heart trans
plant patients.
In today's New England
Journal of Medicine, Stanford
researchers report that heart
transplant patients who are
given the drug diltiazem as part
of their post-operative treat
ment are much less likely to

suffer blocked arteries than pa
tients who don't take the drug.
"We had a big clinical prob
lem," said Cardiovascular Med
icine Prof. John Schroeder, lead
author of the study. "We would
do heart transplants on our pa
tients, and get them through a
very difficult year with infec
tion and rejection . . . and then
blockages would show up" in
coronary arteries.
"The main thing that threat
ens life after the first year (after a
transplant) is the development of
this disease," agreed Cardiovascu
lar Medicine Prof. Sharon Hunt.
She said that about half of all
heart transplant recipients show
some evidence of blocked arteries
within five years of the transplant.
The only way to treat such
blockages, Schroeder said, was to
retransplant the heart, which is
expensive and creates a greater
demand for the already-small pool
of available hearts.
However, Schroeder said, when
patients were given diltiazem after
transplants, "over the first several
years there was ... no evidence
the calcium was being deposited."
Out of about 50 patients who
received the drug, only five devel
oped minor blockages, Schroeder
said. In a similar-size group of
transplant patients who did not
receive the drug, he said, 14
developed some blockage and five
of those patients either died or
needed new transplants.
"It's very encouraging. It's
exciting for us," said Hunt.
"We and others in the field had
been looking for anything that
would slow down" arteriosclero
sis, she added.
Diltiazem is a relatively inex
pensive drug that is widely used

as a high-blood-pressure drug,
Hunt said.
Hunt said two additional bene
fits of taking diltiazem come from
its interaction with cyclosporin, a
drug transplant patients take to
suppress their immune systems
and prevent rejection of the
transplanted organ.
According to Hunt, one side
effect of cyclosporin is that it raises
a patient's blood pressure. Dilti
azem works to lower blood pres
sure, counteracting this side effect.
Also, diltiazem changes the
way cyclosporin is metabolized,
allowing patients to take less
cyclosporin, she said. Since
cyclosporin is expensive — it costs
about $10,000 per year — Hunt
said taking less can mean a
$2,500 yearly savings for patients
who take diltiazem.
Hunt said more research
should be done before doctors
begin widespread prescription of
diltiazem for transplant patients.
"I think all of my co-authors
would agree that this is pretty
preliminary evidence," she said.
Schroeder said the study has
been underway at Stanford Hos
pital since 1986. In addition to
Schroeder and Hunt, Cardiotho
racic Surgery Prof. Edward Stin
son, Cardiovascular Medicine
Prof. Edwin Alderman, research
associate Shao-Zhou Gao and

ciate Prof. lain Johnstone con
tributed to the report.
