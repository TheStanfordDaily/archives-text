# Refritos on the other side
## 
### Simon Zambra 
If you're looking for good, cheap
Mexican restaurants, just head east
on University Avenue until "Bever
ly Hills Cop" turns into "Boyz 'N
the Hood." You're now in East Palo
Alto.
Continue on to the civic center.
Five doors down from the post of
fice and reassuringly near the police
station is the prosaically named
Villa Taqueria.
It's a big, airy place with an open
kitchen, benches and big trestle ta
bles. Plastic flowers are the only ob
vious concession to Mexican
restaurant kitsch.
"Super-burritos" are a sure way
to fill up for only $4.50, even if they
do look like giant sea slugs. You can
choose between pork, beef tongue,
chicken and chorizo, accompanied
by the usual stuff — shredded let
tuce, cheese, chilis, beans and rice,
guacamole — the kitchen sink. The
ordinary burrito for $2.75 is an ab
breviated version of the same thing.
More ambitious dishes are of
fered as well. Ribs and steaks, along
with various specials, are trusty
stand-bys. Be warned, the transla
tion of "bisteck" is not filet mignon.
The ranchero or chili verde sauce
covering the bistec hide a multitude
of sins.
These dishes cost $7 and are
served with beans, rice and a
mountain of piping hot cornflour
tortillas made in true Mexican
style: with pig fat. The rice has a
nice smoky garlic and tomato taste
but has obviously been re-heated
more than once. A nice touch is the
small piece of Mexican goat cheese
that's served on the side.
Villa Taqueria stocks six differ
ent Mexican beers which cost $2
each. Don't expect to sample them

all at one go — a sign admonishes
three beers per person.
If you're dining alone you can
watch Mexican soaps on the televi
sion in the corner. It's never turned
off, not even when the juke box is
blaring a particularly powerful
song by "The Puma" or Rafael.
Just across the road at 2377 Uni
versity Avenue is El Bohemio: a
dark pool hall and shellfish bar. In
side there are signs on the walls
that read, "If you want to fight, spit
or sell drugs — DON'T!"
But yuppiedom has struck even
here; Coronas come with salt-en
crusted limes stuck in their necks.
"Ostiones" — oysters — cost $12 a
dozen. If you find you've made a
mistake, you can always smother
them in chili sauce.
Order in Spanish and the
servers will answer you in Spanish.
But don't go there to make friends.
A couple of doors further down
at 2373 is Carnitas Uruapan. The
specialties of the house are seafood
and, logically enough, "carnitas,"

or ribs. As at Villa Taqueria, the
food seems to fall into two camps:
Americanized Mexican food like
quesadillas and enchiladas, or
more traditional plates of meat or
fish.
Food here is cheap; for just
$4.95 you can get a substantial
plate of ribs, served with beans,
rice, tortillas and a drink. The food
is cooked in advance and re-heated
— but you still have to wait. (Not
to worry, there's a television and
juke box to keep you occupied.)
The meat is decidedly not fat-free,
but the beans are nice and creamy.
All available wall space in the
restaurant has been decorated
with garish murals. There are pink
plastic pansies too.
If you've got to choose, go to
Villa Taqueria first. You'll get a
bang for your buck, authentic food
and a friendly staff. And you can
congratulate yourself for finding a
real Mexican restaurant — the
kind that doesn't automatically
serve you iced water.
