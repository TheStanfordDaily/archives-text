# Heavenly sounds: Mem Chu organs inspire awe
## 
### Aaron Thode Editorial staff 
Over 40 years ago, a nuclear
physics doctoral student became
interested in the organ sitting in
Memorial Church. Within a few
weeks, he became a music major.
Techies die hard, however.
He quickly discovered that he
was more interested in building or
gans than-in playing them. His
mentor, Herbert Nanney, intro
duced him to John Swinford, the
maintenance man for all the organs
in the area.
Thus began the career of Charles
Fisk, one of the greatest organ
builders in the 20th century. He
died 10 years ago, but not before he
began work on his last organ.
Through the efforts of his widow,
Virginia Fisk, and other dedicated
workers, a second organ was added
to Memorial Church — known
ever after as the "Fisk" organ.
Fisk is one of many individuals

to fall under the spell of the organ.
University Organist Kimberly Mar
shall and Associate Organist Robert
Bates are two others who have ded
icated their careers to this complex
instrument.
Bates, who plays music for over
150 weddings in Memorial Church
each year, began playing the organ
in the seventh grade. "At that age it
was the complexity of it. Maybe it
was the power," he said. "You have
your own world you create in the
organ loft."
"I speculate some people play
the organ for that reason alone."
"It's a very patriarchal instru
ment. It projects power and con
trol," said Marshall, who began
playing at age 15. "Within a year I
was hooked. It's like being a con
ductor, except you have complete
control over the entire orchestra."
While making the air thunder
was what originally attracted both
to the organ, what kept them
hooked was the vast amount of

music written for the instrument.
"No other instrument can give such
a variety of music," Marshall said.
The reason for this variety is that
the organ is an ancient instrument.
According to Marshall, icono
graphs show that organs existed in
the Roman Empire by the third
century A.D. The earliest surviving
written music is from the late Me
dieval period, the focus of Mar
shall's expertise.
A final reason organs fascinate
those who play and build them is
that each one is unique. "Every
organ is a different instrument,"
Bates said. Once a year he visits the
Fisk's older cousins in Europe,
some of whom have survived since
the Middle Ages.
The architecture and personali
ty of the country and age seep into
each organ, Bates said. "Italian or
gans are warm and vocal, while
French organs are very colorful. In
Northern Germany organs have a
solid and powerful sound, while
the Spanish organs have a royal, ex
otic sound" — possibly created by

trumpet horns attached to the
pipes.
The Fisk organ has its roots in
the German style. Standing in front
of the console, it is an impressive
sight. Four manual keyboards, a
separate set of foot petals, and 20
stops that adjust combinations of
pipes. Mastery of all of this is re
quired to operate the 4,422 pipes in
the organ, which range in size from
one inch to 32 feet.
Looking like the flue of a chim
ney, a large lever indicates a very
special feature. By shifting the
lever, the organ can play two differ
ent tuning systems. As a result, it
can properly recreate almost all
organ music produced from the
16th to 18th century. Ironically,
"The Fisk organ is best at playing
the older music," Bates said, noting
that the older organ is best at play
ing modern music.
Also ironic is that the original
1903 Murray-Harris organ, which
surrounds the more compact Fisk,
is completely electric. "One of the
first things electricity was used for

was to operate organs," Bates said,
and the Murray-Harris simply re
flected the times.
The more modern Fisk, by con
trast, is mostly mechanical. "There
is a 99 percent direct linkage from
keys to pipes," he said. The older
organ, which is not currently in
use, is being reinforced.
When operational, the two or
gans combined can play a greater
variety of organ music than any
others on earth, making Stanford a
mecca for organ players. Currently
six graduate students and two un
dergraduate music majors special
ize in the organ.
Before playing on the big or
gans, students practice on a third
organ on the second floor of the
Music Department. Marshall says
that the department is raising
funds to buy a new practice organ
and to construct a practice room
that will be dedicated to Herbert
Nanney, University organist for
over 40 years, and the man who in
troduced Fisk to his life's calling so
many years ago.
