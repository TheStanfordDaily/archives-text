Thanks to the Loma Prieta earthquake, many Stanford students
(including seniors) have never heard the Fisk organ being played in
Memorial Church.
Now is an ideal time to catch up. Over the next month, three organ
concerts will be given, and your next chance will not be until spring
quarter. (Of course, one could always attend the 10 a.m. University
interdenominational services each Sunday.)

Kimberly Marshall will play a few of his works. Admission free.
■ Jan. 31,8 p.m. Divine Euterpe: Kimberly Marshall will play works by
several female composers. $7 general admission; $4 students.
■ Feb. 14, 8 p.m. Visiting professor Robert Anderson will play several
contemporary works for organ. The concert is part of a conference on
"The Organist in the 21st Century.* $7 general admission; $4 students.
■ Feb. 15,4 p.m. Also part of the conference, six different organists
will play recently composed music, including two works commis
sioned especially for this performance. Admission free.
