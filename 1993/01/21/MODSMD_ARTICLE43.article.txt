# Tips for trips: How to plan your ski adventure
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
If you've got a few hundred bucks in your
dorm slush fund, the patience to withstand a
sweaty 14-hour car trip and an urge to hit the
slopes — be it face-first or otherwise — then go
to Tahoe, young man.
This season will probably be the best for many
years to come... with snow the way the gods in
tended it to be. Soft, supple snow that falls from
the sky. Not spewed from some icky, harsh ma
chine like in previous drought-ridden seasons.
So you've already gone skiing. So you hate ski
ing. Maybe you're like me and have never even
seen the snow. Who cares?! Go skiing anyway.
Just imagine yourself zig-zagging across the
slopes like Suzy Chapstick, narrowly saving
yourself from dismemberment at the hands of an
aggressive tree; waving at less-intelligent, yet
more attractive skiers from large, state schools;
trying to steal your skis like those red and blue
bowling shoes, by hiding them down your shirt.
Just imagine all the fun you'll have driving a
rented mini-van like some middle-aged slow
pitch softball coach from Fresno, with full insur
ance. Doughnuts in the parking lot? Driving 145
miles per hour on icy roads? Why not?! Free
blue-velvet lined coffins are included in the
deluxe package. Try driving it off a harmless lit
tle cliff to see if Dodge engineering is as sturdy
and safety-conscious as Volvo's.
You never know until you try.
But make sure to bring snow chains, and Find
some big, husky person to put them on. Prefer
ably someone who can bench-press your As
tro Van in the air and strap them on the tires with

their teeth.
Otherwise you'll have to pay a chain rat $20 to
put them on on the highway, plus $10 more to
take them off. Too extravagant for starving stu
dents. Try to find someone from your dorm that
lives in the Arctic Circle to direct the endeavor.
And unless you've got your own stash of neon
green, pink and black matching ski boots, bind
ings, skis, jacket, pants, earmuffs, ski mask,
turtleneck, gators, cufflinks, condom collection,
leg warmers and similarly accessorized signifi
cant other, you will have to rent.
The horror.
Yes, everyone will know — as your un
matched self bumbles around the slopes — that
you've never gone heli-skiing in Montana.
You've never skied the Alps, and your Mr.-Rent-
A-Skis give you away. It's just like not having
Guess jeans in the eighth grade. But you'll get
over it.
Try renting stuff in Palo Alto. If you wait until
you get to Tahoe, you'll have to stand in lines as
long and sickly-satisfying as those for Food Ser
vice holiday dinners. Plus you'll have to wear
boots made for the children of sick parents who
bound their kids' feet as an act of toughlove. Not
that your toenails are a priority in comparison to
the unbridled joy of zooming down a mountain
full of weekend athletes such as yourself.
And get some warm clothes. No jeans this sea
son, sporto. Powder equals wetness, and there's
nothing less sensuous than wet jeans chafing
your genitalia. Get those polyester pants. Your
friends won't laugh. They'll be wearing them too.
lodging can be finagled through a realtor or

from the ski lodge itself. You can do
the condo thing, the cabin thing or
the limp around the fireplace in the
lodge trying to find someone to give
you a honey mustard/Ben Gay rub
down thing.
Be careftil in picking the location
of your temporary love nest. South
Tahoe is full of casinos, restaurants
and free showings of all three
"Porky s" films 24 hours a day.
North Tahoe brings the word
"boring" to new heights. They take
their boredom seriously. Olympic
caliber boring. No Mel Torm^-filled
nights of excitement and dancing
girls with obnoxious headdresses.
No toupees, free drinks or
"lounges." Just bad TV reception.
Then, you've got to ski. The
miniature golf course in Tahoe is
closed most of the time, so there's
no use trying to amuse yourself
during the day seeing the sights. Yes,
you can make snow angels. Yes, you
can write your name in the snow
with your own urine. Yes, you can
have snowball fights. But it's a ski
trip, moron. Ski. And ski well.
The Lake Tahoe area is home to
15 ski resorts ranging in size from

Soda Springs' cozy two lifts on 200
acres, to Squaw Valley's 33 lifts on
8,300 acres. Most resorts' seasons
extend until Easter, and lift tickets
range from $18 to $40.
The thrill of skiing in two differ
ent states on the same run, as well as
the casinos in the lodge, make
Heavenly a sure crowd pleaser.
Heavenly has 25 lifts with a $39
daily fee and offers a beginner pack
age for $40 which includes lesson,

Just imagine
yourself zig-zag
ging across the
slopes like Suzy
Chapstick.

all-day rental equipment and
novice lift access, just to get you to
fall in love with the entrancing, yet
painfully expensive, sport of skiing.
Okay, so maybe all the resorts
offer $40 beginner packages, but

why not be able to say you've skied
in California and Nevada, for that
pseudo-jetsetter feeling?
Unfortunately, Heavenly is big
and crowded, detracting from that
man vs. nature feeling as you try
and wade your way around the
throng of semi-coordinated vaca
tioners.
Instead, try North Star. For $39 a
day, with 11 lifts, limited ticket sales
and new equipment, North-Star
at-Tahoe is less crowded, but not as
small as your back yard in Vermont.
Kirkwood is also recommended,
with 11 lifts at $35 a day, and a good
variety of terrain, from very ad
vanced to beginner slopes.
Kirkwood, North Star and Tahoe
Donner, among others, also have
cross-country ski areas with trail
fees of around $15.
If you want to make others jeal
ous, try snowboarding. At Heaven
ly and Kirkwood beginners' pack
ages are in the $50 range.
An offer too good to refuse? Take
the weekend off. Like you were
gonna study, or practice your polka
moves with your Viennese Ball date.
Yeah, right. Go skiing, Dislocating
your knee will probably be less
painful, anyway.
