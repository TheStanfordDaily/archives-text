# The 						joys of hormones, sweat and beer
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
Fraternity parties are as close as you can get to the junior
high school Utopia. Only this time you get to sit in the
back seat of the bus with the cool kids whose parents
don't care that they're growing marijuana plants in their bed
rooms.
The idea of a Thursday through Saturday meat market
brings tears of joy to your eyes, I know. The memories. The
scams. People "accidentally" touching your butt as they wade
through the crowd.

Yes, you too can be amazingly
attractive three nights a week.
A few hundred of your clos
est friends milling around,
with their Sperry topsiders —
little curly-q, pig's tail
shoelaces optional — sticking to
the scum on the floor.

Squeaky freshmen girls scream as
they see their next-best-friend
bounce through the door, as if college
was their only chance to break out of

the "smart girl" and into the "annoying
bimbo" category.... A step with a very
low degree of difficulty, they will discov
er by their sophomore year.

Men taller than large, industrial build
ings obstruct your view of the band while
trying to consume enough beer to get their
mammoth selves stumbling drunk enough
to wipe out herds of trendy Brannerites like
Godzilla in Tokyo.

Rent-a-cops in stylish neon jackets write
on your hand in water-based ink that you
are far too young and immature to be drink
ing —a problem that is easily solved as one o
your gracious hosts licks it off, while you
feign bubbly repulsion to hide your secret
admiration for the size and shape of his
tongue.

You gotta love it.
So go nuts with it. Due to the gen
erosity of the fraternity community,

there will be several more opportunities
for you to meet the man/woman of your

dreams, research the quality of 75-cents-a-keg lite beer, be
come intimately familiar with the bathrooms of the Row
houses and show the world that you can be just as social as
Chelsea Clinton when the urge hits you.
First, you must "rally up" a group of "partymeisters" such
as yourself, with the same interests. Work-boots and bad
drugs people should stay with their own kind. Polo shirts and
pinky rings with theirs. And those people who kick it up on
weekends by studying in Cubberley instead of Meyer... well,
you should stay with your own snivelling set as well.
Although wearing matching shirts and pants like some
bowling team from hell can be a good conversation piece, it

isn't highly recommendable. When
your designated pachyderm of passion
for the evening finally decides to come
back over and enjoy the luxuries you
have to offer, he and his four brain cells
will remember "skanky black skirt,

bomber jacket and low-cut, breast-expos-

ing v-neck" before
"Squeaky Fromme, psy
chology major" I

You wouldn't want
one of your oh-so-close,
yet slightly-unattractive-

compared-to-you friends to
get your action just because
you thought it would be
adorable to play twinsies for

the evening.

So pull out a nice, tight shirt, the one skirt you can
still fit in, and those little black flats, and step into the

limelight. Men... who ever notices what men wear?! It's
all up to mother nature for you, because that button-

down shirt and Gap jean ensemble has been in style since
women started remembering the days of the week by their
birth control prescriptions.

Then trudge on over to the hormone-fest of your choice,
based on the originality/nudity of the art on the fliers,
and the line piled up outside. Only Exotic Erotic is worth

waiting in line for, because any row house pushed to
four times its capacity will only be enjoyable if others
wear correctly pH-balanced deodorant, or if your
sponsors drop Lysol bombs on the keg room every 20
minutes.
At this point, it's all up to you. Be the perkiest, slight
ly-intelligent-yet-not-intimidating person you can be.

Don't talk
about ]
grades, J
G.P.A.s 1
or your
exploits on

your high school's
Quiz Bowl team.
Be relaxed. Tap
your foot to the

high-school
dance hits
the DJ plays

or the Jackson Five
cover the band is inflicting
upon the crowd.

Maybe you should get drunk, so the whole process would
be easier.
Now, lean against a wall somewhere, scan the crowd for
prospective love nymphs and take one of those gold condom
coins and flip it in the air like a mafia-lord. Heads equals
clothes on, tails equals duct tape optional.
Remember to say "hi" to people you don't know to waste
10 minutes of their evening trying to figure out where the hell
they met you and what your name is.
And the rest is up to fate. It's all Cupid. The luck of the
draw. How much karma you've racked up by folding other
peoples' laundry.
Just don't be in a hurry. Nobody else has gotten any action
since high school, either.
