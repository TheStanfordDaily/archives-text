## Japan's drums 
### 
With a message promoting harmony and com
munication among all peoples, the Japanese taiko
drumming company, Kodo, will perform in Memo
rial Auditorium on Jan. 22 and 23 at 8 p.m.
The 12-member group incorporates a wide vari
ety of Japanese instruments, dance and mime into
their performances.
But drums — including the 900-pound o-daiku
— dominate Kodo's shows.
Performing in a variety of positions that demand
intense physical discipline, they create a wide range
of sound that reverberates with a mystical, hypnot
ic effect.
Founded in 1971, Kodo draws from Japan's rich
musical tradition, and has collaborated with musi
cians and artists across the spectrum, helping to
promote a worldwide interest in percussion.
Ticket prices begin at $19 and are available at the
Tresidder Ticket Office, (415) 725- ARTS, or
through BASS.
