# Orpheus Rising
## 
### 
Tonight, Spike's Cafe in San Francisco will spot
light one of Stanford's most successful student
bands, Young Orpheus.
The trio of Chad Dyer, Sean Bennett and Erik
Selvik formed two-and-a-half years ago as a cover
band, then started playing originals.
The group now plays all originals — with an al
ternative bent — and has put together an hour
and-a-half set for tonight's show, which they regard
as their debut into the "real" music world.
Spike's is located at 139 Bth Street between
Howard and Mission. The show begins at 10 p.m.
