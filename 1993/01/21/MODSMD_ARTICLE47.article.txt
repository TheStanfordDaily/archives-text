They're everywhere, and darn it, they give
me the willies.
It's like those old movies where a little nuclear
waste gets spilled and a horde of six foot mon
sters roam the landscape, carrying people off
and making strange, loud, maraca-like sounds.
Some may call them ants, but I think
they're little black demons sent to punish me
for years of throwing food out when people

were starving somewhere else.
I used to think things like, "Ants are some
thing that other people get." But then 1 re
turned from vacation to discover a stream of
ants climbing up the wall to get at a Twinkie
which I had thought would be amusing
tacked 10 feet from the ground. That was
when I knew.
1 got ants.

They are masters of stealth, like tiny Ninja
that can scale walls and find their way
through the tightest security.
You're not powerless though. Each time you
squash one under a finger, or zap a pack with
a can of Raid, you're helping to fight a war.
Grab a can, and start spraying. We have a
war to fight.
