Richards" will be on display in the Stanford
Art Gallery Jan. 26 through March 28.

coastal scenes.
The selection of about 40 works by the
19th century artist includes drawings, water
colors and oils.
The last laugh. If you want kidney
bursting, lunch-launching laughter, then you
want Steven Wright.
His dry, droll approach to humor com
bines the everyday mundane existence of life
with an insane perspective that gives birth to
nothing short of hilarity.
The point: He's really funny.
On Saturday Jan. 23 Wright will be at the
Nob Hill Masonic Auditorium at 111 Cali
fornia in San Francisco. Tickets are $18 and
$ 15, and are available at the Great American
Music Hall Box Office and at BASS outlets.
