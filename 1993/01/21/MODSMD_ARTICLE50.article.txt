# Don't worry Dad, I won't wait up for you
## 
### 
There are certain things your parents
shouldn't do. They shouldn't sing in
the car. They shouldn't be seen in pub
lic for the entire year when you're 13. They
shouldn't go to a fancy restaurant and order
a cake that says "Congratulations On Your
First Menstrual Cycle."
They also shouldn't date.
To be honest, I wasn't even comfortable
with the idea of my parents dating each other.
While other kids stayed up past "Fantasy Is
land" for the comfort and reassurance of their
parents' return, I stayed up to make sure Dad
didn't try to take Mom somewhere after the
movie. Also to shake the specter of that tiny
Mexican guy leering over Lynn Redgrave in a
bikini. But that was secondary.
Eventually they calmed down and started to
spend their Saturday nights ordering out Chi
nese food and renting bad movies. But even
after their wild days of dating were long over,
neither of them would own up to the fact that
this "other couple" I heard so much about
never really existed. I hope.
So when I lived with my Dad this summer,
I wasn't prepared for the coming home at all
hours of the night, the phone calls deep in the

a.m. or the three Greek letters posted over the
door frame My Dad had started dating again.
And my Mom's name wasn't "Lisette." I
tried my damnedest not to play the bitter child
of a broken family. At least not before it's time
for graduation presents. But somehow, every
time I heard one ofhis exploits, and the mantra
about how a 52-year-old with hair doesn't have
any problems with the "ladies," I found myself
calling him "Squiggy."
Somehow, the thought of a woman who
isn't my mother making me breakfast in a red
lace teddy wasn't living up to the fantasy.
So I sat him down and tried to have a ma
ture conversation. 1 told him that I understood
his situation. I told him what he was doing was
a perfectly normal reaction to the separation
he and my mother were undergoing. I told him
he was a jerk. He started mumbling the Greek
alphabet backwards and told me he wasn't
going to teach me the secret handshake.
But he was happy, in a teenage, my-parents
went-away-for-the-weekend kind of way. Like
a freshman in college, he put a bunch ofbeer in
the refrigerator, even though he doesn't drink
beer. He emptied his pockets to proudly show
me intricately folded notes passed to him at

work. I felt like I was living with Screech from
"Saved by the Bell."
Because deep in my heart, I was jealous. I
was old enough to sit back and patiently wait
for the woman who was going to be the love of
my life, so why couldn't he? Hell, he could at
least spend some time pining. I was hoping we
could pine together.
But not Dad. He fell off the horse and wasn't
going to wait to put the saddle on. Even the
metaphors make me nauseous. Imagine what

the cheap cologne does.
It's not really the idea of my father dating
that bothers me. It's the idea of him tongue
kissing someone.
But I don't have it in my heart to be angry.
He's happy, he has a Structure credit card and
he's teaching me things about 30-year-old
women which may prove invaluable in just a
couple of years. He's also in no position to ever
judge any future girlfriends of mine. Especial
ly if he's gone out with them.
No matter how explicit he is about his
chance encounter with one of the "fly girls," at
least it's just the two of us talking together, in
some kind of Bill Cosby meets Benny Hill way.
It's this Lisette woman that's the problem.
Before I know it, I'll be sitting in my house hav
ing a superficial conversation with my Dad
about the new Oliver Stone movie, because 1
don't feel comfortable with the 28-year old
blonde sitting there, packing his pipe.
I think my Dad's dating one of the Gore
girls.
