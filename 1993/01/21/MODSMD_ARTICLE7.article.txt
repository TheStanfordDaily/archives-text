# ASSU explores summer storage options

### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
ASSU senators struggling to revive summer
storage for student belonpngs are investigat
ing several possibilities to deal with fire hazard
and budgetary problems.
The Office of Residential Education discon
tinued the storage last year because of budget
cuts, but undergraduate senator Stacey Strong
said money is not the most important obstacle
now.
"The problem the University sees with stor
age is that it's a fire hazard," Strong said. "The
fire marshall is coming down really hard."
She said the fire hazards pose an increased
insurance risk to the University, and that
makes the storage space under buildings virtu
ally useless.
The ASSU is currently working on two

plans which may improve the
situation, Strong said.
The first would involve
asking the Stanford Fire Mar
shall to visit campus later this
month "to see if some of the
storage can be salvaged or
changed to meet fire codes."
Hiring an outside contrac
tor for storage off campus is
the other possibility, Strong

said, although it would be expensive and goods
cou Id get lost or broken while being transported.
Dean of Students Michael Jackson, who met
with ASSU senators last month about the stor
age issue, said the situation will be much clear
er once the University knows what campus
spaces can be used and what the manpower
costs will be.
Some options include storing students' be

longings in large metal bins that are left out
side, Jackson said. But large numbers of bins
would be an eyesore, he added, and Facilities
would have to be consulted.
The most likely outcome is a combination of
on-campus and off-campus storage, he said,
and the situation needs to be worked out by the
end of this quarter so students can begin mak
ing arrangements for the summer.
"A well-thought-out proposal needs to be
brought back to the student senate," Jackson
said.
Strong added that University President
Gerhard Casper "expressed concern" about the
matter when asked about it at an ASSU Senate
meeting last quarter.
Casper encouraged the Senate to work with
the University to "see whether we can con
structively approach this problem and come up
with a solution that's workable."
