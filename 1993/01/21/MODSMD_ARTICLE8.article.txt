# New year's days
## Students prepare for Asian holidays 
### Colleen Krueger 
Remember that New Year's
resolution? Though it's only three
weeks into 1993, even the best-in
tended resolutions may already be
forgotten.
But all is not lost for members of
the Stanford community who fol
low Chinese, Korean and Viet
namese cultural traditions. For
them, the new year has yet to come.
Many consider Lunar New
Year — also called Chinese New
Year — the most important holi
day of the year. On campus, stu
dent organizations have spent
weeks preparing for the Year of
the Rooster, which begins Jan. 23.
The Asian American Student
Association will host its annual
Lunar New Year Banquet Jan. 31.
The evening will feature perfor
mances by several Asian groups.
AASA cultural chair Madeleine
Lu stressed that "even though
Lunar New Year is traditionally
celebrated by the Chinese, Kore
an, and Vietnamese cultures . . .
our role is to incorporate all differ
ent Asian cultures and their tradi
tions into our celebration."
Siegrid Liu, cultural co-chair of
the Undergraduate Chinese-
American Association said the
group will be bringing in a speaker
in late January to "demonstrate
the myths and traditions associat
ed with paper cutting."

On Feb. 6, group members will
venture into San Francisco to see
the annual Chinatown New Year's
Parade, Liu said.
In past years, Stanford's cele
bration has included a lantern pa
rade through campus, a tradition
that many hope will continue.
Community leaders have not yet
set a date for the event.
While student organizations
are planning events, for many stu
dents, the heart of the holiday lies
in the home.
In freshman Amy Hsieh's fam
ily, traditional foods are symboli
cally laid upon the table for the
Hsieh's ancestors. Incense and
traditional invocations are also of
fered as signs of respect and re
membrance.
The Hsiehs spend the weeks
leading up to the new year folding
specially purchased squares of
gold paper into "heaven curren
cy," which is burned in honor of
ancestors.
Because Lunar New Year signals
the beginning of spring on the tradi
tional Asian calendar, many families
fill their homes with cherry blos
soms and other signs of renewed life.
Junior Tina Lai, who left Tai
wan seven years ago, remembers
the Lunar New Year celebrations
there as being "just like winter
break."
"We wouK celebrate for at
least 14 dayt," she said.
In Taiwan, Lai remembers
spending the holiday with her
family. Traditionally, younger
family members receive money
from their elders each new year.
"Kids are supposed to bow to
their elders ... for respect and
then they get money in red
envelopes," she said.
According to freshman Ken
Wong, these red envelopes are
"everybody's first memory about
celebrating New Year."
"My parents get really upset if
I fight with my brother on Chi
nese New Year," said Hsieh. "You
just try to make everything about
the day positive because it's rep
resentative of the whole year."
