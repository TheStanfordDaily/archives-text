Social Policy of Stanford Fraternities and Sororities
Realizing the importance and necessity of responsible par
ty planning, the Greek Leadership Circle has developed the
following social policy. Going beyond fulfilling state law, this
policy tries to address many issues which are often overlooked
when planning campus social events. The Greek Leadership
Circle hopes that the Stanford community will become famil
iar with this policy. Additionally, we hope that campus organi
zations will use these standards, or similar standards, as a mini
mum in planning social functions.
Social Policy of Stanford Fraternities and Sororities
Stanford's Greek community strongly encourages responsi
ble and safe use of alcohol when served at social functions. In
order to support this goal, the Greek Leadership Circle, the
Interfraternity Council, and the Intersorority Council have
instituted the following standards for social functions involv
ing alcohol. All Stanford fraternities and sororities are expected
to comply with these standards and practices, adding specific
standards if they deem necessary. In the event that a problem
arises at a Greek social function, the level of adherence of these
standards will be carefully evaluated by the Greek Judicial
Board.
1) The possession, use, sale, consumption or serving of alco
holic beverages by the Stanford Greek community or its
members shall be in accordance with all applicable
University, local, state, and federal laws and regulations.
Signs clearly stating California law concerning alcohol
consumption must be posted at the entrance to all parties
and in any areas designated for alcohol distribution.
2) Alcohol may not be mentioned in any advertisements for a
social event (i.e. fliers, banners, or invitations) and must be
an adjunct to an event, never the focus.
3) Host organizations must:
a. Provide door monitors at the entrance of the party. The
door monitors shall be either two members of the host
organization(s), or one or more hired security guards*.
The door monitors must:
1. only admit guests with valid Stanford ID who are
not visibly intoxicated (at the entrance to the site of
the party),
2. check for valid identification of age and shall mark in
a clear and precise manner that can not be repro
duced (i.e. wristbands) those guests who are of legal
drinking age. Methods of identification using ink,
such as hand stamps or markers, are strongly
discouraged.
b. Provide at least two sober members or a hired bar
tender* to serve any alcohol provided from the opening
of the party until 1:00 am, at which time alcohol will
no longer be served.
*In the case where professional staff is hired, party
planners and chapter officers are still responsible for
supervising their actions.
c. Provide an adequate amount of equally attractive non
alcoholic beverages (EANABs) and non-salty food
throughout the party.
d. Designate, in advance, sober monitors who will be pres
ent for the entire duration of the function. The number
of sober monitors shall be decided in advance and shall
be appropriate for the number of guests anticipated (i.e.
3 for a closed function hosted by two groups, 15 for an
All-Greek Tailgate).
e. Designate, in advance, a system for providing sober
rides home from the event and offer to find an escort or
means of transportation for those guests in apparent
need.
f. Provide a receptacle at the exit to the party and a sign
stating that no alcohol may leave the site of the event.
The door monitors are responsible for ensuring that no
guests or members leave the party with cups or contain
ers of alcohol.
g. Determine, in advance, possible emergency procedures.
If a function is co-sponsored, participating organiza
tions shall have a clear understanding of the procedures
and contacts in the event of an emergency. It is recom
mended that there be a single individual from the
organization who will serve as the immediate contact.
4) Social coordinators from each chapter shall be trained
regarding responsible party planning prior to sponsoring
any social events. Programs organized by Party Pros or the
Office of Student Activities are available for this purpose.
5) Fraternities and Sororities hosting co-sponsored functions
shall have equal responsibility for the planning of the event
and the implementation of these standards.
6) Greek leadership shall review this policy annually and
make modifications as necessary.
