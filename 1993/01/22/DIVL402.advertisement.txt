Investment Bankers to Entrepreneurs
Opportunities in Investment Banking
Volpe, Welty & Company is a boutique investment bank dedicated
to serving the financial needs of emerging companies in selected
industries, including medical technology and services,
biopharmaceuticals, interactive media, software, communications and
entertainment. As our logo signifies, our clients are leading
entrepreneurs, not dinosaurs.
The Firm is seeking to hire select members of Stanford's Class of
1993 to serve as Financial Analysts in both its San Francisco and Boston
offices. Because we are a small and focused firm, Financial Analysts at
Volpe, Welty & Company will be expected, to assume, quite rapidly, a
high degree of responsibility in assisting us to execute client
assignments ranging from public offerings to mergers, acquisitions and
private placements.
Candidates should possess superior analytic capabilities, an
interest in finance, excellent communication skills and an ability to
thrive in an unstructured, fast-paced environment.
Interested graduating seniors should submit a resume and cover
letter by February 1, 1993 to:
