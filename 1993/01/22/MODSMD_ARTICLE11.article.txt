Baird won't withdraw despite pressure
WASHINGTON (AP) — A combative Zoe Baird rejected calls to
withdraw as attorney general-designate yesterday despite rising
public and congressional opposition. The Clinton administration
offered her muted support in the furor over hiring illegal aliens.
"Right now, Zoe Baird is his nominee," White House spokesman
George Stephanopoulos told reporters as Baird underwent a second
day of grilling by the Senate Judiciary Committee. He also said
President Clinton may never have discussed the pivotal issue with
his nominee prior to picking her.
Economy improving, but not here
WASHINGTON (AP) — Lifted by strong Christmas sales, the
economy is improving everywhere in the United States but Cali
fornia, the Federal Reserve said yesterday in an assessment of
economic conditions facing the new administration.
"Reports . . . indicate continued improvement in economic con
ditions across much of the nation," the central bank said.
Its report, the most upbeat since late last spring, singled out
retail sales as a bright spot. But it cautioned that the job market
still hasn't responded fully to the rising economy.
Troops remain in Somalia until March
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Some American troops the
United States had hoped to pull out of Somalia before or soon
after President Clinton's inauguration could remain until as late
as March, a U.S. military spokesman said yesterday.
Marine Col. Fred Peck said no timetable could be set until the
U.N. Security Council adopts a resolution necessary to transfer
control of the U.S.-led relief operation to a U.N. peacekeeping force.
Commemorating Roe v. Wade
WASHINGTON (AP) — Abortion foes will assemble near the
White House today for their annual march on the Supreme Court.
But for the first time in 12 years, rather than being emboldened by
a president's words, they will be set back by his deeds.
President Clinton will mark the day, the 20th anniversary of
legal abortion in America, by revoking his predecessors' restric
tions on abortion counseling at federally supported clinics.
