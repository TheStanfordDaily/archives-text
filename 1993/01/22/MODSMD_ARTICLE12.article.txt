# After the inaugural party
## Clinton plans first executive actions 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - On his first day in
the Oval Office, President Clinton said yester
day his administration would not flinch from
military showdowns with Iraq following a
fresh challenge. The Senate rushed approval
of more of his Cabinet but hundreds of senior
positions remained vacant.
After partying into the early hours after his
inauguration, Clinton spent all morning greet
ing thousands of visitors to a White House
open house. Well-wishers waited outdoors for
hours for a greeting from Clinton.
It was almost I p.m. before he paid his first
visit to the Oval Office — just a quick look
around before moving on to the Roosevelt
Room for a meeting with senior aides.
Clinton told them, "We just have to be dom
inated by high standards and clear vision, and
we ought to have a good time doing it."
Meanwhile, his wife, Hillary, was checking

out the Oval Office. In a break with tradition,
she will have an office in the West Wing, the
first time a first lady has had space there. A
spokesman said she would be closely involved
in developing Clinton's health-care program.
Day One brought the first break in the mil
itary cease-fire extended by Saddam Hussein
as a goodwill gesture to the new president.
The new president said he was sticking with
the Bush administration's policy, which called
for instant strikes against belligerent forces
and measured responses to violations of "no
fly" zones imposed in Iraq by Gulf War allies.
On Capitol Hill, the Senate confirmed nine of
Clinton's Cabinet members and five other top
officers. Nevertheless, hundreds of senior posi
tions remained open.
There was an air of confusion as Clinton's
new team — inexperienced in the ways of the
White House — searched for telephone num

bers, directions and a general plan of operation.
Eager to begin putting his policies into
effect, Clinton will move quickly to revoke the
ban on homosexuals in the military, despite
grumbling from the Pentagon, officials said.
Clinton also plans to act today — the 20th
anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling that
legalized abortion — on executive orders
expanding abortion rights.
One order ready for his signature would lift
restrictions on abortion counseling at federal
ly financed clinics. Another would end the ban
on medical research using fetal tissue from
abortions.
In his first national security directive, Clin
ton added Robert Rubin, head of his newly
formed National Economic Council, and
Madeline Albright, nominated as ambassador
to the United Nations, to the National Securi
ty Council.
