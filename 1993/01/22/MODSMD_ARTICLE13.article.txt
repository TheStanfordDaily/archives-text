# Cease-fire breaks down; U.S. bombs Iraq

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - A
cease-fire proclaimed as a "good
will gesture" to President Clinton
broke down yesterday when U.S.
jets bombed a radar site. Baghdad
denied it provoked the action, but
promised to uphold the truce.
U.N. weapons inspectors, mean
while, arrived in Iraq to resume
work after a more than two-week
hiatus caused by the current con
frontation.
Pentagon officials said two U.S.
warplanes fired on and bombed an
Iraqi air defense radar site in
northern Iraq after radar was

turned on them — a preliminary
step to firing missiles. The Pen
tagon said Iraqi anti-aircraft guns
also shot at the allied planes.
A statement carried by the Iraqi
News Agency quoted an unnamed
Foreign Ministry spokesman as
denying any radar had been
turned on in the northern "no-fly"
zone. He said there were no casu
alties.
But he said, "Iraq still abides by
its declared cease-fire despite the
behavior of the U.S. plane, which
was aggressive and provocative."
It was unclear if Baghdad was

testing Clinton's resolve or if the
Iraqi action was an error. Most
Iraqi officials have been appealing
to Clinton to change U.S. policy
toward their country. The govern
ment said Tuesday its forces would
stop shooting at allied planes.
In a move that could also be
seen as a challenge to Clinton,
Saddam's government announced
yesterday it is reopening a Bagh
dad powdered-milk plant that
U.S. officials say was a cover for
biological weapons production.
Reports of the hostilities came a
few hours after 52 U.N. weapons

inspectors arrived in Baghdad to
resume dismantling Iraqi weapons
under terms of the Gulf War cease
fire.
Saddam banned U.N. planes
from flying to Baghdad earlier
this month. But in declaring the
cease-fire, the government also
bowed to U.N. demands to drop
the ban on U.N. flights.
The head of the inspection
operation, Rolf Ekeus, said he
would keep flying inspectors into
Iraq despite the latest clash. He
said the resumption of U.N.
flights went smoothly.
