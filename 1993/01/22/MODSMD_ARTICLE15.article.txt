Yell Leaders should be
axed, their expenses
given to other sports

Nobody likes yell
Leaders. And if that's an
overstatement, it's not
much of one. The loudest "cheers"
the Yell Leaders inspire is the col
lective groan of the crowd when
they first appear at a sporting
event.
Students, most of them violent
ly opposed to the reappearance of
the Yell Leaders three years ago,
have continually berated the group
and considered them a sorry com
panion for the beloved Dollies.
The Department of Athletics
should consider the prevailing
opinion of students and do the
right thing: Give the Yell Leaders
the axe. They should do it for one
reason and one reason only — the
Yell Leaders aren't worth the
money.
Hard-working athletes who par
ticipate in club sports such as
Crew and Rugby are continually
looking for money — money
they're not getting from the Ath
letics Department.
Their long hours of hard work
only get longer when they have to
spend weekends taking tickets at
the football stadium or working on
other fund raisers.
Spending money on those pret
ty white skirts and megaphones
is wrong as long as any of our
sports programs are forced to go
without. And although there is no
way to know exactly how much
money is being spent on the Yell
Leaders — the Athletics Depart
ment won't tell The Daily — it's
probably not an insignificant
amount.
The Athletics Department, for
instance, paid for the Yell Leaders'
trip to the Blockbuster Bowl. That
couldn't have been cheap.
Acting of its own accord, the

Athletics Department reinstituted
the Yell Leaders three years ago as
a way to bring spirit to Stanford's
sporting events. If the Yell Leaders
even came close to achieving this
goal, it might be reasonable to
keep them around.
But as anyone who's been to a
football game can tell you, they
don't. Students have made it clear
that they find the Dollies and the
Stanford Band quite sufficient as
instruments of spirit.
The Dollies and the Band work
together to inspire the crowd — as
well as to provide humor and
lightheartedness to our sporting
events.
Irreverence is their middle
name, and students love them for
it. One of the very first things
upperclassmen teach freshmen
upon their arrival is the timing of
the jump in "All Right Now."
Standing next to the Dollies and
the Band in perfect, white uni
forms, the Yell Leaders look down
right boring.
They look exactly like what you
would expect to see at any other
university in the nation. And
that's probably just what the Ath
letics Department had in mind
when they re-formed the group —
a wholesome-looking, alumni
pleasing, television camera-friend
ly group of buxom young women
and brawny young men.
The Athletics Department
claims that the Yell Leaders and
the Dollies aren't in competition
with each other. The Yell Leaders
should be thankful for that,
because they would be far behind
indeed.
But the fact is that the Yell
Leaders and the Dollies do com
pete with one another, however
indirectly, for the crowd's atten
tion. The Yell Leaders, for
instance, have taken to doing a
Dollie-like dance during the play
ing of "All Right Now."
Stanford sporting events would
be much more pleasing if this com
petition was eliminated, and the
proceeds were given to Stanford's
needy sports program.
