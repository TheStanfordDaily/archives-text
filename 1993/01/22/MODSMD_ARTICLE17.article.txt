## Curing the Stanford blues 
### 
HEY, YOU. Yeah, you. You're prob
ably reading this in class, tired,
bored and alone. Your grades have
been one disappointment after another,
and over the last six months you've
"checked the cream" more times than
Sam Breakstone.
Remember all those pictures in
Approaching Stanford? A smiling young
man peering into his post office box. Four
happy students frolicking on the banks of
Lake Lagunita. A whole classroom of
excited students laughing at a professor's
erudite wit. Lies. All lies.
We were duped. The whole Disneyland
of the North thing was a big sham, and
we bought it with the eagerness of a
tourist in New York City getti*g a»ge»*
uine Rolex for only five dollars.
Beneath the saccharin smiles and
strained enthusiasm, you're angry. So
what do you do? Transfer? Try to con
vince your parents that Chico State is
better suited to your unique academic
needs?
No, you're trapped in this plastic Gar
den of Eden, and there's only one thing to
do with your frustration. Vent it.
• All the muscle-bound jocks on cam
pus make you feel scrawny and inade
quate, and to make matters worse,
they're probably smarter than you. Go to
Encina. Look for the hugest and meanest
dude in the place. While he strains to
hoist a colossal barbell, "pants" him. By

the time the ambulance arrives, you'll be
miles away giggling like a schoolgirl.
• You're old enough to die for your
country, but God forbid you should ven
ture outside with a cup of watered-down
Meister Brau. Get yourself a clear pitcher
and fill it with ginger ale. Stagger around
campus singing "99 Bottles of Beer" at
the top of your lungs. When a cop
approaches and asks what you're drink
ing, smugly tell him "ale." Wait until he's
got the cuffs on to let him in on your lit
tle joke.
• When you're not getting any action,
there's nothing worse than a roommate
who is. The next time j'ou come home to
find your sleeping bag in the hall and the
door locked, nonchalantly strut into the
room, turn on the lights and exclaim
approvingly, "Boy, those open sores sure
aren't holding you back!"
• The grades your professors are dol
ing out will undoubtedly keep you from
entrance to the law school upon which
your parents' love is contingent. Give
them a taste of your justice. Phenoltha
line, the colorless, odorless, tasteless
indicator used in your chemistry lab, is
coincidentally the strongest laxative
known to man. Sprinkle a few drops in
the punch at the next faculty banquet. Sit
back and savor the spectacle as Nobel
laureates and other academic paragons
helplessly run amok while their colons
discharge.

• The checkers at Green Library view
every Stanford student as a potential
thief, and they wantonly violate your
right to privacy by rifling through your
book bag in search of contraband. Hide a
starving, half-crazed ferret beneath some
magazines in your book bag, and coolly
explain that you might have stolen some
books by accident, but you're not really
sure. He'll think twice the next time he
sticks his mangled nose where it doesn't
belong.
So now you're beginning to get the
idea. It's you or them. Don't keep all that
anger pent up inside of you, • it's
unhealthy and bad for your complexion.
You spent more than 17 years of your life
being a model citizen, and look where it's
gotten you. Here.
So what's the message of this whole
diatribe? Stop trying to save the world,
and look out for number one. And people
say my columns have no redeeming social
value.

Pete Huyck does not intend for any of his
loyal fans to take these ideas seriously
(but he does recommend the long-toothed
Peruvian ferret. It can eat off a man's face
in less than five seconds.)
