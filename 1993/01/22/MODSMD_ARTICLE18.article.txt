## Coordinator for Diversity explains importance of the job 
###

CC OORDINATOR FOR WHAT?"
I "What the heck does a Coordi-
VJ nator for Diversity do?" "Fig
ures The Daily would come up with a
position like that."
If I had a nickel for every time any of
these questions/utterances were directed
at me, I would be a rich woman (and
probably not working at The Daily on the
-- um, sparse — salary it offers).
I will be the first to say I was always a
bit confounded as to the purpose and
necessity for a "Coordinator for Diversi
ty" at The Daily, even when I took the
position at the beginning of this school
year.
But as this volume comes to a close, I
— the wise and seasoned Coordinator for
Diversity I am — can explain the role to
the baffled masses, and in all serious
ness, attest to its importance at a time
when "multiculturalism" has taken on
too many negative connotations.
So what does a Coordinator for Diver
sity do anyway?
First of all, what I didn't do: I didn't
go through the paper and change every
"black" to "African-American" and every

"disabled" to "differently abled." I didn't
police the editorial staff to make sure
every group had a certain number of
articles written about them.
Instead, I made an effort to meet with
representatives from every campus com
munity and get in touch with the issues
they were concerned about. I asked them
to use me as a contact to The Daily to
inform the staff about events or issues
we should be aware of, or voice criticism
and suggestions about our coverage or
sometimes, lack thereof.
I was encouraged that many people
did contact me with ideas and concerns.
When community members had com
plaints about coverage, I hoped that
speaking to someone besides the
reporter or the editor was helpful in
improving communication between The
Daily and the community.
And there were problems. There are
areas in covering multicultural issues in
which we know The Daily could improve
— and most likely, there are problems
we aren't aware of yet.
We should not cover them merely to
meet some P.C. agenda, however. That

would only serve to belittle and demean
the issues that exist. We should cover
events and issues because they reflect
social movements both within and out
side of Stanford, or have an impact on
the lives of members of the Stanford
community.
Which brings me to make the distinc
tion between adhering to the P.C.
mantra and addressing the real issues
that various University communities
face:
As Coordinator for Diversity, I have
been granted numerous affectionate
nicknames from well-meaning peers who
believed my main purpose was only to
serve as a terminology watchdog. Among
these are "P.C. Police," "P.C. Queen"
and a personal favorite of mine, "Coordi
nator for Pigment."
People are usually surprised to discov
er I am relatively unconcerned with
politically correct terminology.
While members of minority communi
ties should be given the power to deter
mine how they will be referred to by oth
ers, too much emphasis on terms and
labels avoids the issues that really exist

in these communities.
Historically marginalized groups con
tinue to face prejudice and have unique
experiences and concerns that impact all
aspects of life at Stanford — from the
curriculum to subjects of dorm conversa
tions.
Considering the complex issues that
lie ahead, I offer my challenge to the
Stanford community: Communicate
with us.
I was never disappointed when I
received an angry phone call or letter,
because it meant that one more person
had brought to our attention a problem
or misunderstanding instead of stewing
about it or complaining to those who had
no power to change the situation.
And even better than receiving com
plaints was having a two-way discussion
about the problem. This way, at least
each side could begin to understand the
other's perspective.
I sincerely hope that the lines of com
munication I established will be main
tained in the future with the next Coor
dinator for Diversity, and that many new
ones will be built.
