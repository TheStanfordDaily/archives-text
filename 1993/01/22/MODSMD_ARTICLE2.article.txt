# Casper establishes, chairs Medical Center task force
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
In hopes of drawing the Univer
sity and its three primary medical
branches closer together, Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper has
created and will chair a Medical
Center task force.
Casper has charged the com
mittee with developing a long
term plan that will better coordi
nate the Medical Center — con
sisting of the Stanford Hospital,
the School of Medicine and the Lu
cile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital — and also make it more
financially stable. The group plans
to have a report ready by May.
At last night's Faculty Senate
meeting, Casper talked about the
relationship between the Medical
Center and the University, a sub
ject which he has "spent more
hours at night (studying) since ar
riving than on any other subject
related to Stanford University."
While Casper said the estab
lishment of the six-member task
force is not in reaction to a partic
ular problem in the Medical Cen
ter, he added that "certainly there
is a nationwide health care crisis
that affects Stanford as much as
anything." And with all the possi

ble changes that will come with
the Clinton Administration,
Casper said he was worried that
"Stanford would find it very diffi
cult to react in a concerted way."
The committee's work, its
members expect, will mean a more
comprehensive response to these
challenges.
' Faculty members raised some
concerns about the purpose of the
task force. "Exactly what is on the
table for this task force for the
Medical Center? .... Could you be
clearer? Are you going to start
from the ground up or where are
you going to start?" asked Genet
ics Prof. David Botstein.
Botstein remarked that the
task force appears to be a "very fi
nancially oriented" committee.
But "there are academic issues out
there, too," he said.
Casper replied that while "on
the surface," the task force seemed
concerned mainly with finance, its
agenda is actually much broader.
"I think what is absolutely im
portant is that the financial issues
of the Medical Center are reviewed
in terms of the academic priori
ties, the pressures on the hospital,
etcetera," he said.
"Certainly this is not meant as
a task force that has only one
goal, and that is to deal with the
long-term clinical-service side of
the center."
When asked why there are no
faculty members on the task
force, Casper said that there soon
will be committees working under
the task force that will be much
wider reaching, encompassing the
faculty and the community.
He explained that he decided to
be the chair because he found
that the structure of the Medical
Center — in which neither the
Stanford Hospital president nor
the Medical School dean reports
to each other — prevented anyone

else from effectively running the
committee.
"I found, whether I like it or
not, that the president is the
only agent who could try to pull
these things together without
having never-ending discussions
opening every issue," Casper
said. "The president of the Uni
versity is the only agent to whom
all these parties relate at some
level."
The task force includes Medi
cal School Dean David Korn,
Chief Financial Officer Peter Van
Etten and Stanford University
Hospital president Kenneth
Bloem.
Isaac Stein, president of the
investment firm Waverley Associ
ates, Inc. and former chairman of
Esprit de Corp, will work as a
part-time, unpaid special assis
tant to Casper.
