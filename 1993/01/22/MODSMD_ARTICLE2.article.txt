In hopes of drawing the Univer
sity and its three primary medical
branches closer together, Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper has
created and will chair a Medical
Center task force.
Casper has charged the com
mittee with developing a long
term plan that will better coordi
nate the Medical Center — con
sisting of the Stanford Hospital,
the School of Medicine and the Lu
cile Salter Packard Children's
Hospital — and also make it more
financially stable. The group plans
to have a report ready by May.
At last night's Faculty Senate
meeting, Casper talked about the
relationship between the Medical
Center and the University, a sub
ject which he has "spent more
hours at night (studying) since ar
riving than on any other subject
related to Stanford University."
While Casper said the estab
lishment of the six-member task
force is not in reaction to a partic
ular problem in the Medical Cen
ter, he added that "certainly there
is a nationwide health care crisis
that affects Stanford as much as
anything." And with all the possi

ble changes that will come with
the Clinton Administration,
Casper said he was worried that
"Stanford would find it very diffi
cult to react in a concerted way."
The committee's work, its
members expect, will mean a more
comprehensive response to these
challenges.
' Faculty members raised some
concerns about the purpose of the
task force. "Exactly what is on the
table for this task force for the
Medical Center? .... Could you be
clearer? Are you going to start
from the ground up or where are
you going to start?" asked Genet
ics Prof. David Botstein.
Botstein remarked that the
task force appears to be a "very fi
nancially oriented" committee.
But "there are academic issues out
there, too," he said.
Casper replied that while "on
the surface," the task force seemed
concerned mainly with finance, its
agenda is actually much broader.
"I think what is absolutely im
portant is that the financial issues
of the Medical Center are reviewed
in terms of the academic priori
ties, the pressures on the hospital,
etcetera," he said.
