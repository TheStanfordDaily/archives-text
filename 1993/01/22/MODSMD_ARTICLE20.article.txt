## Stanford rebounds behind second-half surge, 79-70 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Just when things were looking pret
ty low for the Stanford women's bas
ketball team, everything seemed to
click into place in the second half of
last night's game against UCLA.
After a disappointing performance
against USC on Monday and a some
what sloppy first-half effort against
the Bruins, the No. 3 Cardinal final
ly turned things around by slipping
past UCLA, 79-70, at Maples Pavil
ion.
"This was a much better effort for
our team," Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "It was how we like
to play."
Although Stanford (13-3, 4-1 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) managed to pull out
the nine-point victory, it was by no
means an easy task. The gritty Bruin
squad relied on solid first-half shoot
ing from all five of its starters as it
held the lead for most of the opening
period. Whenever the Cardinal tried to
take the lead, UCLA always seemed to
respond with a run of its own, making
for an exciting and competitive con
test.
"There's something about when
Stanford and UCLA play together that

tends to bring out the best in both
teams," said Bruin head coach Billie
Moore.
The second half proved no different
as both squads increased their level of
intensity. A pair of Chris MacMurdo
layups tied the game at 41 apiece with
18 minutes left in the second period
and gave the Cardinal a boost of
momentum. However, UCLA pushed
forward once again, establishing a
seven-point lead with 12 minutes
remaining.
Realizing that time was running
out, Stanford finally took control of
the contest as it embarked on an over
whelming 21-7 run. While center Val
Whiting scored six of her game-high
28 points with her inside moves, point
guard Molly Goodenbour dominated
from the outside. The senior presea
son All-American converted four of
her six three-point baskets during this
span.
"They doubled and tripled on our
post players and Val kicked it out real
ly well," Goodenbour said. "I would've
felt guilty if I didn't hit them."
Perhaps the most impressive per
formance of all came from sophomore
forward Rachel Hemmer, who
knocked in 14 points and gathered 10
rebounds while substituting from the

bench. Even more significant than
these statistics was her hustle
throughout the contest, as she
grabbed three steals, forced several
jump balls, and fired up the crowd of
3,292 with her overall intensity.
"I just try to provide whatever's
going to make the team win," Hemmer
said.
Furthermore, Stanford's defense
performed convincingly, flustering
UCLA star Natalie Williams through
out the game. The tenacious effort of
Whiting and company held the for
ward to just 12 points, a far cry from
her 24 points-per-game average.
"Every time she caught the ball she
had two or three people on her,"
Moore said.
Not only did the Cardinal gain some
much-needed momentum from its sec
ond-half outburst, but it can now take
over the top spot in the Pac-10 with a
win over USC (11-3, 5-1) tomorrow
night. According to VanDerveer, Stan
ford is looking to gain revenge for its
loss to the Trojans on Monday.
"I'm glad it's this week," she said.
"We didn't play our best [last time).
They're an excellent team. More than
anything we need to take the ball
inside and go at [USC starj Lisa
Leslie."
