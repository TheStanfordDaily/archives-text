# 'Sixth woman' comes to Cardinal's rescue in nick of time

Score one for the sixth woman.
Although Maples Pavilion was less
than half-filled last night, the 3,292
fans who watched Stanford surge to
victory against UCLA more than made
up for the ring of empty seats around
the top of the arena.
"The people who were here tonight
really wanted to be here," coach Tara
VanDerveer said after the game.
"The extra emotion in the crowd
helps a lot," she said. "We needed it."
In particular, the six-and-a-half
minutes in the second half when the
Cardinal turned a seven-point deficit
into a seven-point lead revealed the
power of home-court advantage.
A dramatic symbiosis emerged as
Cardinal scores elicited roars from the
crowd, and, in turn, the hand-clapping,
foot-stomping and screaming of the
fans injected the Stanford players with
all the adrenaline they needed to sus

tain their run.
Just before the Cardinal players
retook the court after VanDerveer
called a rare timeout with 12:27 to go,
an isolated clap snowballed into an
avalanche of energy from the crowd.
Playing an aggressive 1-3-1 half-court
trap, Stanford devoured the fans'
enthusiasm and quickly forced two
Bruin turnovers.
Bruin coach Billie Moore tried to
thwart the surge in its nascent stages
with a timeout of her own, but neither
the frenzied crowd nor the revved-up
players eased up the pressure.
Shortly after play resumed, Cardi
nal forward Rachel Hemmer made
sure her teammates' emotions didn't
ebb. Lunging after a loose ball near the
sideline, she reached high into the air
and hurled the ball off a UCLA play
er's leg, enabling Stanford to retain
possession.
Following the play, Hemmer
whirled toward the student section,
thrusting her fist high into the air and

touching off a firestorm of sound in
return.
Bruin point guard Nicole Anderson
claimed the noise didn't hurt her
team's attempts to cling to its lead.
"The crowd really doesn't matter. You
have to block them out," she said.
But ignoring the fans last night
became akin to blocking out the
sounds of a minefield. Seemingly each
step the players took — be it a Cardi
nal steal or basket, or a Bruin miss or
errant pass — sparked an explosion
from the local faithful.
Molly Goodenbour, whose barrage
of second-half three-pointers was like
gasoline added onto the fire, stressed
the need for intense play.
"What we're trying to do is have
that consistent emotion every night,"
Goodenbour said. "Finding that recipe
for getting emotion into every game"
would go a" long way toward helping
Stanford repeat as national champion.
The home crowd last night stirred
in one key ingredient.
