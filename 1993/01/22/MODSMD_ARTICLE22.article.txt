# Hoops gives all but falls to UCLA, 84-76

### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES— In a city
where everybody has a dream,
Stanford's came up just a bit
short. Putting forth one of its
best efforts of the season last
night before a Pauley Pavilion
crowd of 8,767, the Cardinal
fell to UCLA, 84-76, as the
long-range shooting of reserves
Kevin Dempsey and Marquis
Burns busted an effective Stan
ford zone. The Cardinal failed
in its bid to beat the Bruins on
their home floor for the third
time in four seasons.
Trailing by a mere three
point margin at halftime, the
Cardinal sensed that an upset
of the 23rd-ranked Bruins was
within their grasp. Stanford
(6-10, 1-3 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) opened the second period
with a 12-6 run to take a 44-43
lead, with five of those points
coming from senior guard
Marcus Lollie.
But UCLA (12-4, 3-2) then
employed a stifling full-court
press to embark on a 13-3 run
of their own. Bruin forwards
Ed O'Bannon and Rodney Zim
merman found themselves left
alone for easy inside buckets
as a result of transition game
steals, and UCLA earned a 57-
47 cushion by the 10:17 mark,
a deficit from which the Cardi
nal would never quite recover.
"I liked our defensive effort,"
UCLA coach Jim Harrick said.
"I liked our pressure on the
ball, and (backup center Rod
ney) Zimmerman did a nice job
of up the middle."
Coach Mike Montgomery
went to a small lineup in an
attempt to rattle the Bruins,
employing three guards, mov
ing Brent Williams to the power
forward position, and rotating
Jim Morgan and Bart Lam
mersen at center.
"We made a decision to look
at different lineups and went
small," Montgomery said. "I
wanted to get the best players
out there on the floor."
Aside from UCLA's one

large spurt, however, the rest
of the game was essentially
even, as Stanford gave a solid
overall performance and
scored more than 70 points for
only the fourth time all season.
Coach Mike Montgomery's
game plan of setting his team
up in a defensive zone and forc
ing UCLA to make outside
shots worked, at least on the
Bruin starters. Shooting guard
Mitchell Butler went l-for-5
from the field, and point guard
Tyus Edney was a mere 3-for-8.
Other than O'Bannon, who led
the Bruins with 19 points,
UCLA's front line was very
quiet. UCLA center Richard
Petruska, who came into the
game averaging 13.8 points,
failed to score.
"As critical as we've had it
inside with our injuries, I
thought our guys did pretty
well," Montgomery said.
Not included in Mont
gomery's game plan, though,
was Bruin backup Kevin
Dempsey.
Dempsey, a freshman
swingman who sat out three
games earlier this year due to
tendonitis in his knee, showed
no signs of pain behind the
three-point stripe. He convert
ed 4-of-5 three pointers, and
along with reserve Marquis
Burns (who sank both of his
three-point attempts), used
the longball to send the Cardi
nal home.
"Dempsey came in and hit
some big shots," Lollie said. "If
it hadn't been for him and
Burns, we had them where we
wanted them."
The opening minutes pro
vided an unimpressive display
filled with errors on both sides,
as UCLA and Stanford commit
ted a flurry of turnovers. Stan
ford played up to the level of
UCLA, as the Bruins managed
to entertain leads of only seven
points at best before the Cardi
nal would come back. The high
light for Stanford was the play
of reserves in the backcourt, as
a steady Dion Cross and a
flashy Kenny Hicks combined

for 19 of the Cardinal's 32
first-half points.
Stanford's backcourt play
ers had a wealth of shot
opportunities all night, and in
contrast to recent outings,
converted on many occasions.

Starters Lollie and Peter
Dukes each finished with 10
points, and Hicks scored a
career-high 15 points in
reserve. Cross, a freshman,

ford kept last night's contest with UCLA close, but eventually
wound up on the short end of the score.
led Stanford in scoring for the
third consecutive game with 18
points.
"We can't be happy about los
ing," Montgomery said. "But the
step up in effort and concentra
tion was really satisfying. We
competed, we played hard and
were in a position to win. If we
can understand the difference
between how we played tonight
and how we've played recently,
we'll be better off."
The next test for the Cardinal
comes tomorrow afternoon
against USC, a contest that will
take place at 3 p.m. at the Los
Angeles Sports Arena.
