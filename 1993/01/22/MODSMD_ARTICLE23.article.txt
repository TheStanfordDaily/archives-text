The best and the brightest.
This Sunday at Stanford Sta
dium, the 68th annual East-
West Shrine Game will feature
72 all-stars from the 1992 col
lege football season.
This year's edition of the
Shrine Game features perhaps
the best crop of players that the
game has ever seen.
Last year, seven players from
the Shrine Game were taken in
the first round of the National
Football League pro draft.
But that number pales in
comparison to the incredible 15
potential first-rounders that
will take the field this year.
The nation's top quarter
backs, offensive linemen, run
ning backs, linebackers and
defensive backs will display
their talents for the estimated
100 pro scouts that will be in
attendance.
In all, a record 23 first-team
Ail-Americans will participate
in the game.
Stars such as Miami's Gino
Torretta, winner of the Heis
man Trophy — given to college
football's most outstanding
player — and Nebraska's Will
Shields, the Outland Trophy
winner as the country's best
offensive lineman, will show
case their talents for a national
ESPN audience.
The list of premier players
hardly ends there. Also com
peting will be Chris Slade,
Virginia defensive lineman
and Football News Defensive
Player of the Year; Lincoln
Kennedy, Washington offen
sive tackle and two-time
Pacific-10 Conference Line
man of the Year; Trevor
Cobb, Rice running back and
1991 Doak Walker Award
winner (given to the nation's
top running back); and Mar
cus Buckley, Texas A&M
linebacker and Southwest
Conference Defensive Player
of the Year.

Rick Mirer, rumored to be the
No. 1 or No. 2 pick in the NFL
draft, will also see action.
The Shrine Game is college
football's oldest all-star game,
and younger only than the Rose
Bowl in postseason competi
tion.
Stanford Stadium has been
the host of the Shrine Game
and pageant since 1976.
The past 10 years have seen a
75,000 person attendance aver
age, making it easily the most
visible college all-star game.
The Pac-10 is well represent
ed with 20 players, and every
school in the conference is
accounted for — with the excep
tion of hard-luck Oregon State.
Stanford offensive guard Chris
Dalman and Ail-Americans
Glyn Milburn, a running back,
and Ron George, a linebacker,
will be on hand.
Other conference partici
pants include Washington's
Kennedy and linebacker Dave
Hoffmann, UCLA cornerback
Carlton Gray and California
running back Russell White.
Past greats such as Walter
Payton, Roger Staubach, Ed
"Too Tall" Jones, Kellen
Winslow, Larry Csonka have
played in the Shrine Game.
Current stars such as John
Elway, Randall Cunningham,
Sterling Sharpe, Art Monk,
Lorenzo White, Brent Jones,
Lawrence Taylor, Steve Atwa
ter, Gill Byrd and Chip
Lohmiller are among many
other all-pro stars of today who
have played in the post-season
classic.
The Shrine Game is played
for the benefit of the Shriner's
Hospitals for Crippled and
Burned Children, and lives up
to its motto of "Strong Legs
Run, So That Weak Legs May
Walk."
In its history, the game has
raised more than $12 million
for Shriner's hospitals across
North America.
The pre-game pageant will
begin at 10:45 a.m. and kick-off
will be at 1:00 p.m
