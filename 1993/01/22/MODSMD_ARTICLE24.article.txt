# Cardinal gymnastics teams together in Berkeley
## No.12 women seek bragging rights in 'Big Meet' vs. 13th-ranked archrival 
### Sean May Staff writer 
There's no love lost when the
Stanford Cardinal meets up with
the California Golden Bears.
Each contest is a titanic battle of
wills, and the only one left stand
ing at the end is declared the win
ner.
Talking about football? Wrong.
Basketball? Guess again.
Try women's gymnastics.
"We want to beat the Wee
nies," junior co-captain Mollie
Brown said.
The No. 12 Cardinal (0-1 con
ference, 0-2 overall) will face the
No. 13 Golden Bears (0-1, 0-1) in
a dual meet tonight at 7:30 p.m.
at Harmon Gymnasium in Berke
ley. The two teams will tangle
again next week at Maples Pavil
ion in Chili's Red Hot Invitation
al.
Cal defeated Stanford in two of
three meets last year. The Cardi
nal beat the Golden Bears in the
Pac-10 Championships, but Cal
won the regular season dual meet
and finished eighth to Stanford's
10th in the NCAA Champi
onships.
"This year we want to beat
them all year," Brown said.
The Cardinal has a golden
opportunity tonight. Beset by
injuries all season, the Cardinal
is finally starting to mend. A bad
back has kept Ail-American Jene
Elzie out of the all-around com
petition the last two meets, but
she will return to the lineup
tonight.
Except for junior Laurie
West's foot injury, the team is
back to full health.
Stanford also should be
helped by major changes in the
Bears' lineup. Six seniors gradu
ated from coach Pam Burgess'
team last year.
Cal, however, still has some
excellent gymnasts, led by fresh
man Lisa Washington and senior
Cindy Tom, who scored a 10.00
on the uneven bars in competi
tion last year.

While Cardinal coach Breck
Greenwood isn't thrilled about
his team's winless record, he
isn't particularly concerned
about it, either.
"I don't like to lose, but Ore
gon State is one of the top four or
five teams in the country, and
Cal State-Fullerton is a fast
starting team," he said.
Concerning his own team's
performance, Greenwood cited a
lack of experience on the vault
and injuries to Elzie and West as
two main factors contributing to
Stanford's slow start.
He was quick to stress the
positive, however.
"We have some bright spots
we didn't anticipate," he said,
specifically mentioning the per
formances this season of Brown
and freshman Linda Chun.
Greenwood added that a cou
ple of lineup changes should
increase scoring.
Sophomore co-captain Katie
Clancy, one of the team's best
beam performers, will be return
ing to that event, and the addi
tion of Elzie to the all-around
also will help.
Tonight's meet at Cal will be
the first time this season that
both the men's and women's
squads have competed on the
same floor.
