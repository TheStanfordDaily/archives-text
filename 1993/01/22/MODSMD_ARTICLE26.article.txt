# Stanford men out to hone skills, continue progress toward repeat
## 
### Sarah Nagae Staff writer 
As Stanford men's gymnasts
travel to Berkeley tonight to take
on the California Golden Bears,
the team is not merely focusing
on scoring another win over its
archrivals. While the squad's
goal is to end the meet with the
most points, its real concern lies
in successfully performing new
skills in preparation for the sec
ond half of the season.
Coach Sadao Hamada's team
will compete in a co-ed dual meet
in Harmon Gym at 7:30 p.m. with
a line up "just good enough to
beat Cal." He will primarily use
this meet as a viewing session to
obtain a better idea of what the
team needs to improve upon.
"Many of these guys are still
throwing new skills, many of
which they are competing for the
first time," Hamada said. "I hope
to get an indication of where they
are right now so I can predict
where we will be in two months."
In order to retain the title of
national champions, the team
must concentrate on two key
points, according to Hamada.
"My concerns right now are to
maximize the difficulty in each
one of their routines and at the
same time make sure that the
guys stay healthy.
"Sometimes you have to for
get about the win/loss records
and all the rankings and focus on
building the team as a whole,"
Hamada said. "My goal is to win
in April."
Senior Jair Lynch, a member
of the 1992 Olympic team and co
captain of the Cardinal squad,
will compete in all six events
tonight in preparation for the
USA Winter Championships.
Hamada believes Lynch is "very
capable of winning the champi
onships," which take place in two
weeks in Colorado Springs.
Other Cardinal gymnasts
Hamada is counting on to lead
the team tonight are seniors Jeff
Bender and Shawn Adamek,
juniors Mark Booth and Jason

Cohen, sophomores Jing-Wei
Liang and Josh Stein and fresh
man Peter Hegi.
"This meet will be a turning
point for me," said Liang, who
will compete in five disciplines.
"While I will be performing
almost all my new tricks, I will
use the next three weeks to put
everything together.
"I think it's very important
that everyone stays healthy and
works to execute their routines

The co-ed atmosphere
is always exerting, it
adds a different twist to
the meet.'

above par," said co-captain
Booth. "The co-ed atmosphere is
always exciting, it adds a differ
ent twist to the meet."
Hamada, in his 21st year of
coaching, is always looking to the
future. One of his brightest hopes
is freshman Peter Hegi, whom
Hamada describes as "the most
improved gymnast on the team so
far, someone who works very hard
and has an excellent attitude."
Competing for Stanford for
the third time, Hegi hopes to con
tribute to the team and minimize
his errors while competing.
Cal finished the 1992 season
ranked 13th under first-year
coach Barry Weiner. Five of the
six Golden Bear national quali
fiers have returned this year,
including senior Marc Feingold,
junior Ail-American Jason
Bertram and junior James Guay.
Tonight's meet is an opportu
nity for the defending NCAA
champions to work out the kinks
in their new routines and
attempt their most difficult
tricks. While the season is just
beginning, the Cardinal's sights
are continually set on back-to
back national titles, its ultimate
team goal.
