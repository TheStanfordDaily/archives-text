# Cardinal spikers face alumni, Cal
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
The men s volleyball team will have some famil
iar guests at Burnham Pavilion this weekend.
Tonight at 7:30 p.m. they host California, and
tomorrow they host former Cardinal players in the
annual Alumni Day.
At Cal, men's volleyball has only club status, but
the Golden Bears are the four-time defending
national club champions. Last weekend they beat
out many varsity squads to place ninth out of 24
teams in the UC-Santa Barbara Tournament.
At the same competition, the Bears lost to Stan
ford in straight games. Last year Cal fell to the
Cardinal in three games at Burnham, then
stretched the Cardinal to five games in Berkeley
before losing.

'What's important is not so
much who we are playing, but
that we take the court ready to
play.'
— coach Ruben Nieves

"Outside of us, they are the best team in North
ern California," said Stanford head coach Ruben
Nieves.
The match against Cal marks Stanford's first
home match of the season. At the UCSB tourna
ment, Stanford had an overall won-lost record of 5-
3, but because only the loss in the third-place
match against Pepperdine was best-of-five, Stan
ford's official record is 0-1.
On Saturday, Burnham will be transformed into
a volleyball gala for the traditional Alumni Day.
The festivities start at 1:30 p.m. with round robin
play. Present Cardinal players will be mixed with
alumni and some members of Stanford's 1992
women's volleyball national championship team,
including Bev Oden.
Then, at 5 p.m., the Cardinal spikers take on a
team of alumni in a best-of-five match. Last year,
the varsity team beat the alumni, which may not be
a good omen for this year's squad since the winner
has alternated every year.
The alumni team should be a formidable oppo
nent, as it includes former standouts Rod Fletcher,
Mike Lowe and Duncan Blackman. Lowe is fourth
on the Stanford record list for most blocks in a sin
gle match. Blackman was a first team All-American
last year, his senior season. He is now a Cardinal
assistant coach, soon to play on the U.S. National
Team.
When discussing tonight's match against Cal
and tomorrow's Alumni Game, Coach Nieves
emphasized the importance of the play of the Car
dinal over the strength of the opposition.
"What's important is not so much who we are
playing, but that we take the court ready to play."
