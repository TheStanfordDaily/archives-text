# Wrestlers face Davis, Bakersfield

### Sam Wu Staff writer 
After narrowly losing its last two home dual
meets, the Stanford wrestling team looks to atone
for the defeats this weekend at UC-Davis and Cal
State-Bakersfield.
For the first time in two weeks, the Cardinal
will feature a mostly healthy line-up, needing to
forfeit only the heavyweight division due to the
lack of a grappler in that category. In the past
three dual meets, the Cardinal forfeited two or
three weight classes due to injury, and fielded
wrestlers who had not recovered fully from vari
ous ailments.
Match-ups also appear favorable according to
Cardinal head coach Chris Horpel. Both the Aggies
and the Roadrunners rely on their lighter grap
plers, just as Stanford finds its strength in 118-
pound senior Phil Nowick, 126-pound senior Dave
Nowick, 134-pound redshirt freshman Jimmy
Aguirre, and 142-pound junior Lance Johnson.
"It's quite realistic for us to win six of 10 match
es in both dual meets," Horpel said.
The Cardinal already defeated UC-Davis in its
season opener, 21-16.
"I want to beat them worse than last time," Hor
pel said.
Horpel had kinder words for Bakersfield. He
views the Roadrunners as one of the top three
squads in wrestling's rather hybridized Pacific 10
Conference. Bakersfield does not compete in the
Pac-10 in most other sports.
The Roadrunners utilize young talent, though
they will still have more experience than Stanford.
While the Cardinal is comprised mainly of freshmen
and sophomores, sophomores and juniors swell
Bakersfield's ranks.
"They always give us a good battle," Horpel said.
"It's gonna be difficult, but definitely not impossi
ble."
Stanford will discover the truth of that state
ment on Sunday after Saturday's dual meet with
the Aggies.
