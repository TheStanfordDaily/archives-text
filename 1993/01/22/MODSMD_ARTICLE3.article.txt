# Search for next provost to start soon
## 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
University President Ger
hard Casper told the Faculty
Senate yesterday that he will
soon begin a search for a suc
cessor to Provost Gerald
Lieberman, who will step
down by Sept. 1.
Casper said he tried to
convince Lieberman to re
main as provost longer, but
Lieberman, who had agreed
to take the position only on
an interim basis, declined.
"I've got to go back. . .to
teaching and research and
writing," said Lieberman, a
professor of statistics and
operations research who
joined the Stanford faculty
in 1953. When he accepted
the position last February,
Lieberman had said he would
serve no longer than 18 months.
Casper was effusive in his
praise of Lieberman, a veteran
faculty leader who has been one of
his key advisers.
"Rarely in our lives.. .do we have
the good fortune of getting to know
someone who we instantly trust,
like, and thank for his intellect and
judgment," Casper said. "Jerry
Lieberman's willingness to take on
the job of breaking in a new presi

dent has placed the University, and
especially me, in good stead."
Casper said he plans to "short
ly request" the Committee on
Committees to select faculty
members who will form a search
committee to find the new
provost. As he has said a number
of times before, Casper told the
senate that the new provost will
be a current member of Stan
ford's faculty.
Referring to his lack of ties to
Stanford before he became presi
dent, Casper said selecting an
insider as provost will "make up
for at least one of my many defi
ciencies."
Lieberman, who plans to con

duct research in applied probabil
ity models and reliability after he
steps down, said serving with
Casper was one of the highlights
of his term.
"He's terrific," Lieberman
said. "We really have a very good
relationship and I've enjoyed
working with him as much as he's
enjoyed working with me."
Casper noted that the Univer
sity simultaneously will conduct a
search for a provost and a new
dean of Humanities and Sciences.
Ewart Thomas, the current dean,
announced earlier this month
that he will step down Aug. 31.
The timing of the two searches
will present a challenge, Casper

said, because both positions are
crucial to issues such as under
graduate and graduate education.
"I view these appointments as two
of the most important choices I
shall have to make," Casper said.
While making appointments
may not seem "dramatic," Casper
said that "for the long-term
future of Stanford, nothing is
more important."
Lieberman will not be a lame
duck in his final months as
provost, Casper told the senate.
"He will continue to have all
provostial authority — neither he
nor I believe that the concept of
'lame-duckness' has much mean
ing here," Casper said.

"When a successor will have
been found, Jerry will gradually
and happily introduce her or him
to the mysteries of the office. In
light of Jerry's strong academic
values and his commitment to
Stanford as the institution, we
could not hope for anything bet
ter," he said.
