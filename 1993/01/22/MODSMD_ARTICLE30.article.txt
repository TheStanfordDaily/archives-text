CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -
Oregon State University issued
a statement Thursday saying it
believed the school and its per
sonnel acted properly in the case
of Earnest Killum, the basket
ball player who died a year ago
Wednesday.
Killum's mother, Thelma Lil
lard, has filed a lawsuit in Los
Angeles seeking unspecified
damages from the university,
Oregon Health Sciences Univer
sity and the state of Oregon.
She contends the defendants'
actions contributed to the death
of Killum, a promising sopho
more player on the Oregon State
team. Killum collapsed on Jan.
20,1992, at a hotel in Los Ange
les and died later of a blood ves
sel disease.
The university said in its
statement that nothing can
replace the loss of Killum but
that the school believes its per
sonnel acted properly.
Athletic director Dutch
Baughman said Wednesday
night that school officials had
not seen the lawsuit. He also
said that the university and its
personnel acted responsibly.
"We believe his death was a
tragic loss to everyone and that
nothing, money or otherwise,
can replace him," Baughman

said.
Lee Lewis Husk, spokeswom
an for Oregon Health Sciences
University in Portland, declined
to comment on the lawsuit. She
said the state attorney general's
office would handle the case.
Killum underwent a battery
of tests at OHSU. The man who
administered the tests, Dr. John
McAnulty, professor of cardiolo
gy, "is one of the most beloved
and respected doctors at the uni
versity," Lewis Husk said.
McAnulty approved lowering
the dosage of anticoagulant Kil
lum was receiving to reduce the
risk of bleeding so he could play.
McAnulty said after the player's
death that Killum knew there
were risks involved in his deci
sion to return to basketball after
he sat out the early part of the
1991-92 season.
Dr. Carl Orfuss, a neurologist
who treated Killum at the Los
Angeles hospital, said the day
Killum died he didn't believe the
death was related to basketball.
"It is the opinion of myself
and all the physicians who treat
ed Earnest here that he suc
cumbed to a disease affecting
the blood vessels and that his
resumption of basketball in no
way precipitated the terminal
event," Orfuss said.
