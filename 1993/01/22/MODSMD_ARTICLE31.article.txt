# Schott to appear before council today

GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) - The head of
baseball's executive council said there won't
be an immediate decision on the fate of Marge
Schott after the Cincinnati Reds owner
appears before the ruling group.
Schott is scheduled to appear today before
the council to answer accusations that she
made racial and ethnic slurs. A four-person
committee submitted the evidence against
Schott to her lawyer in late December.
Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig, the
council chairman, was asked Thursday
whether he expected an immediate decision.
"I do not," he said.
Selig said the council hadn't yet decided

how it would proceed to a decision following
today's 1 p.m. EST meeting.
"We'll take that each day as it comes," he
said in Milwaukee.
The council has the power to fine Schott up
to $250,000 or to suspend her for any length
of time it finds to be "in the best interest of
baseball." The council assumed authority
Sept. 7 following the forced resignation of
commissioner Fay Vincent.
Schott, who assumed control of the Reds on
Dec. 21, 1984, has been accused by several
people of making slurs against blacks, Jews
and Asians.
She has confirmed some statements and

apologized for them. She has denied other alle
gations, including accounts that she slurred
black players on the Reds.
Robert Bennett, Schott's lawyer, submitted
her written response Wednesday to National
League counsel Robert Kheel. Bennett had
asked to have until Jan. 25 to respond and was
angry that the executive council didn't comply
with her request.
"I had been hopeful of working out an ami
cable resolution of this thing," Bennett said
after the deadline was set. "But I am not going
to let Mrs. Schott be rushed to judgment. I am
hopeful that this isn't an indication that they
have reached their sentence."
