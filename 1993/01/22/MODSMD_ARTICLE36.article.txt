# Deputy deans to strengthen H&S
## New full-time positions to increase school's legitimacy 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper yesterday announced
moves intended to bolster the
authority of deans in the School
of Humanities and Sciences.
The moves create three new
"deputy deans" who will have
more power in deciding how to
spend the school's funds and will
serve full-time. They will replace
five associate deans who current
ly serve part-time.
The reorganization responds
to faculty concerns that the asso
ciate deans had little real authori
ty, leaving most decisions
to the dean and slowing the work
ings of the school.
Under Casper's plan, an
nounced in yesterday's Faculty
Senate meeting, the deputy deans
will be responsible for three sepa
rate clusters: Humanities, Social
Sciences and Natural Sciences.
They will act as advocates for fac
ulty in their respective clusters.
The deans will serve three-year
terms, and will control some of
the school's discretionary funds
each year. They will then be able
to make more decisions, reducing
the pressure on the dean and pro
viding faculty with more options
as they search for funding or sup
port for projects.
"If it's all kept within one

dean, I think that dean becomes
very overworked," said Chemistry
Prof. Richard Zare. "I much pre
fer this new system that Casper
has announced."
Under the old structure, facul
ty members often became so frus
trated that they would bypass the
school administration altogether
and take matters directly to the
provost.
Creating the deputy deans will
"increase their legitimacy" with
the faculty, making the deans feel
"that they actually have the back
ing of their peers," Casper said.
The new structure will take
effect Sept. 1, when a new dean
takes over for Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Ewart Thomas, who
announced his resignation earlier
this month. The deputy deans will
be recommended by three sepa
rate faculty search committees.
The final decision, however, will
rest with the new dean.
The issue of reorganizing
Humanities and Sciences, Stan
ford's largest school, has been dis
cussed for the past year. The Fac
ulty Senate's Committee on Edu
cation and Scholarship recom
mended a number of possible
solutions last June. These includ
ed suggestions as radical as break
ing it into a number of smaller
schools or increasing its represen
tation on the University Cabinet
in order to better meet the diver

gent interests of its departments.
"We felt H&S was very much
in need of rethinking," said Zare,
who chaired the senate commit
tee. He added that "a lot of the
faculty" felt that a single dean —
who must devote a great deal of
time to fund-raising as well —
could not adequately serve their
interests.
The committee favored a mod
erate reorganization plan, and
Casper's announced moves match
closely with the committee's sug
gestions, Zare said. Casper's
statement detailing his plan
rejects more radical remedies,
saying "it is vital to maintain the
school as an individual unit."
The dean will remain the
school's sole representative on
the cabinet under the new plan.
Zare cautioned that the reorga
nization does not address the
issue of funding for the school as
a whole. "This stuff is not the
cure," he said. "I don't care how
all these things get organized —
H&S is underfunded as a school.
H&S again and again has always
had to go beg the provost for
money."
Casper's statement said he rec
ognized that the reorganization of
the school "is only tangentially
related to our efforts to address
long-term financial imbalances
which exist for Stanford as well as
for most research universities."
