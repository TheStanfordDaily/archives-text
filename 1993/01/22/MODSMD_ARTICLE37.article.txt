# One word can be a 'major' problem
## Defining 'major' projects may be a glitch in federal funding 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
What's in a word?
A great deal, the Faculty Senate discovered yes
terday afternoon.
Explaining his reaction to the federal govern
ment's new indirect-cost regulations, which were
announced Tuesday, Provost Gerald Lieberman said
there are both benefits and drawbacks.
But he said he is particularly concerned about the
ambiguities created by the insertion of a single word
in the final draft of the regulations.
The final draft stipulates that only "rmyor" pro
jects may be claimed as a cost of doing research, leav
ing open the question of what constitutes a "major"

project, Lieberman said.
The interpretation of the word "major" may allow
the government to limit the amount it is willing to
pay Stanford and could develop into a further point
of contention between the two parties.
University President Gerhard Casper said he has
no idea how the word, which was not in the original
draft Stanford saw only a few days earlier, managed
to sneak into the final draft. "How it made it into
that and what it means and if they know what they
mean by it ... I think is open to interpretation," he
said.
But Biology Prof. Robert Simoni has no doubts
about the meaning of the word. "Just for the record,
I would like to declare my own research 'major,' " he
quipped, eliciting laughter from the senators.
