# Makinen elected Daily Editor

### Joel Stein Chief correspondent Joel Stein Service 
Ah, the editors in chief.
They're a peculiar bunch. Some
take off their clothes at the drop
of a pin. Others at the supplica
tions of a short Indian man with a
penchant for self-op food.
Julie Makinen (MAK-IN-EN),
current managing editor, re
nowned harpist and owner of an
American car, was elected editor
in-chief late last night in an elec
tion that will be remembered, if
nothing else, for Communist-era
ballots.
Legally a midget, Makinen
stands at 4-foot-11-inches-and
three-quarters.
"I haven't fully been through
her underwear drawer yet," said
current News Projects Editor and
Concubine-in-Waiting Rajiv

Chandrasekawhatever.
After slurping down several
healthy swigs of champagne
through her ample nose, Makinen
said her goal was, "to, uh, to work
the editor's couch to a point
where a new one must be pur
chased."
But, even sober, Makinen has
many of the same attributes as
ex-President Bush.
"He's a little bit concerned
about the status of my love life,"
said Angie Chuang in an unrelat
ed newsroom discussion.
Makinen is a Finnish name.
In Vol. 203 Makinen promises,
first and foremost, to bring back
munchies, the little gift editors
often give staffers late at night for
their hard work.
"Yeah, munchies," she said.
Another promise Makinen
made concerned the reappearance
of the long-lost Diversions sec

tion, the Friday humor section of
the paper.
Makinen said she's bringing
back the section because "I'm try
ing to think of something witty to
say."
News Editor Howard Libit was
the only staff member who voted
against Makinen, opting instead
for write-in-candidate — and Sci
ence Bug — Chris Patil.
"I like the idea of the Stanford
Indian," he said.
In an effort to rebuild The
Daily financially, Makinen said
she plans to take a trip up to
Twain Harte. "We're going to sit
in bed naked and read the Book
store Gazette. That's how we're
going to win the Bookstore back
as an advertiser."
No mention was made of Stan
ford Review staffer Lisa Koven.
"Frankly, I'm distraught, but
there's no way I can compete with


Mimi Kuo — Daily
