WASHINGTON - The band
was wearing rainbow-hued spandex,
loincloths, harem pants, body suits
and wedding gowns. The crowd was
decked out in black ties and prom
dresses. Later on, the President of
the United States showed up.

No, this wasn't a bizarre dream;
it was the Inaugural Youth Ball.
"Before we're finished, we're
gonna rock those tuxes and gowns
off you!" said George Clinton, the
dreadlocked leader of legendary funk
band Parliament Funkadelic and no
relation to the new First Family.
"I know we look rather strange,
but you'll get used to that," he told
rather apprehensive college-aged
crowd of 3,000 before starting his
rollicking three-and-a-half-hour
set. "Remember, we're one nation
under groove."
From the subways Filled with
tuxedo and ball gown-clad revelers to
the streets choked with limousines,
Washington was aswirl with Inau
gural Balls Wednesday night in a cel
ebration that felt like the world's
largest New Year's Eve party.
More than 70,000 party-goers

attended 11 official balls, includ
ing a National Ball, regional balls
and the Youth Ball.
But several unofficial celebra
tions — such as the Gay and Les
bian Ball and the MTV Ball —
were the hottest tickets in town.
Bill and Hillary, as well as A 1 and
Tipper, visited each of the Balls,
which featured live performances
from well known jazz, rock and pop
musicians. In an effort to include
people who in prior years could not
afford to attend an inaugural ball,
tickets were sold for $ 125.
Nevertheless, the crowd didn't
appear very inclusive. "Gore talked
about diversity [when speaking at
the ball] but there's not much diver
sity in this crowd," said junior Mike
Brylawski. "Washington is 70 per
cent African American, but maybe 2
percent are going to t he balls."

The Youth Ball was held under
the cavernous atrium of the Old Post
Office Pavilion on Pennsylvania Av
enue. Ballgoers rocked to live perfor
mances from the Dimension Saxo
phone Quartet, Forever Smoothe,
Steele Pulse and Salt-N-Pepa.
Both President Clinton and Vice
President Gore, in their brief ap
pearances, exhorted the young
crowd to enter public service or oth
erwise sacrifice for their country.
"You and your generation are a
lot of what this election was all
about and I hope you feel you won
today," Clinton told the revelers.
At that point, the President and
the First Lady stepped away from
the microphone and started to
walk off stage, but were interrupt
ed by the crowd chanting "Hill-ar
y!, Hill-ar-y!
She responded to the crowd,

saying, "I just hope you have fun
tonight and you have fun tomor
row and you have fun for the next
four years as you help us change
the country for the better."
Afler her comments, the crowd
cheered and"It Had To Be You "by
Harry Connick Jr. came on the
loudspeakers.
The Clintons took a few turns
around the stage, shook a few
hands and left as the Marine band
struck up "All Hail To The Chief."
In the crowd were Chelsea Clin
ton's friends and classmates from
Horace Mann Junior High School
in Little Rock, Ark. More than 40
pre-teens made the trek to attend
the Inauguration of Chelsea's dad,
and Hillary Clinton helped get
them tickets to the events such as
the concert at the Lincoln Memor
ial and the ball.

Fourteen-year-old Gregory
Barnes already has made up his
mind about the one-day-old Clinton
Presidency. "He's a great President
— he's from Little Rock," he said.
All of Chelsea's classmates had
high praise for the 12-year-old.
"She's really nice. She's just like
everyone else," said eight friends
en masse. "She's down to earth."
What did her public school
classmates from Arkansas think
about the recent controversy over
Chelsea going to a private school
in Washington?
"I think it's good," said Jen
nifer Ivory. "If she didn't [go to
private school] all the people
would mess with her."
So why didn't Chelsea's former
schoolmates mess with her?
"She was nice," Ivory repeated.
"Down to earth."
