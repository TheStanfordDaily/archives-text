# New Health Library opens
## Cowell Student Health Center seeks to change its image from 'a place of sickness' to 'a place of health' 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
As a way of increasing its involvement
with the Stanford community — and of ed
ucating students about their own health —
the Cowell Student Health Center officially
opened its new Health Library last night.
In an attempt to change its image "from a
place of sickness to a place of health," Cowell
designed the new facility to provide Stanford
students and their families practical health
information, according to junior Janna
Friedly, coordinator of the library project.
"Stanford is a well-read community. The
library is consistent with the way people
learn on campus and starts them on a life
long process of health awareness," said Dr.
Wesley Alles, director of Cowell's Health
Improvement Program.
One focal point of the new library is the
Cold Clinic, which was designed to help stu
dents conquer the common cold through ed
ucation and sample medication, Friedly
said. It also will help ease congestion in the
main clinic of Cowell.
The library, located on the second floor of
Cowell, contains books and videos dealing with
such topics as AIDS and sexual health,
surgery, eating disorders and parenting. It also
contains a file of recent art icles dealing with

current health issues, according to Friedly.
Carole Pertofsky, director of Cowell's
Health Promotion Program, said Cowell of
ficials hope that "it will not just be a library,
but a comfortable gathering place to discuss
health issues."
Students are not able to check out mate
rials from the library, Friedly said, but copy
machines and a screening room are avail
able for student use in Cowell.
Friedly added that the student-staffed li
brary is also designed as a "resource room
and focal point" for campus health groups.
The new library is actually a branch of the
Stanford Hospital's Health Library located
in the Stanford Shopping Center. Linda
Romley Irvine, director of the Hospital's
Health Library, called Cowell's library an ex
citing "way of addressing student issues that
the main health library does not" address.
Irvine added that she hopes this new cen
ter will be "a link to the main library for
more in-depth research."
Dr. John Dorman, director of Communi
ty Relations at Cowell, said Cowell has been
working on this project for a year and a half.
The library was able "to get off the ground"
with a $10,000 donation from the Stanford
Mothers' Club, Dorman said.
The library is open Mondays, Wednes
days and Fridays from noon to 5:30 p.m.
