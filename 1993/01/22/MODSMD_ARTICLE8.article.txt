# Backlog of orders delays delivery of Apple Powerbooks
## 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
One of freshman Amy West's first mtyor
purchases at college was a computer she'd
be able to use for the next four years. When
she ordered an Apple Macintosh Powerbook
145 in mid-October, she was told it would
take three to four weeks to receive her
portable laptop.
Now, three months later, she still does not
have a computer. She should be receiving her
machine soon, but only because she upgrad
ed her order — for an additional $300.
Apple Computers, Inc. has had a $1 bil
lion backlog of computer orders because of
internal difficulties, including the growing
popularity of the Powerbook computers,
said Chester Rice, Microdisc Manager of the
Stanford Bookstore.

"The demand exceeded the supply," said
Rice. "There are constraints everywhere,
not just at Stanford."
Pat Kinley, public relations specialist at
Apple, said there is a shortage of many types of
Apple computers, notjust the Powerbook 145.
The Powerbook 145 model is more scarce than
the other two models, the Powerbooks 160
and 180, because it came out in August, two
months before the other models.
"There was an immediate demand for
the 145," she said. "Since it was released be
fore the other two models, there has been
more time to demand more."
It normally takes anywhere from a few
days to a few weeks to receive a computer
through the Bookstore, although "it totally
fluctuates" according to Rice.
Because of the backlog of Apple's Macin
tosh Powerbook 145, a minority of the peo

ple who had purchased the Powerbook 145
opted to change their orders, said Rice. The
options included canceling the order for a
full refund, switching to another manufac
turer or, like West, changing to a different
Macintosh computer.
Many of the buyers, including West,
changed their orders to a Powerbook 160, a
slightly superior model which costs about
$250 more than the Powerbook 145. The
Powerbook 160 model is also more widely
available.
"(Customers) had to pay a little bit more,
but they got a newer and better machine,"
Rice said. "For instance, the Powerbook 160
can be plugged into a color monitor."
However, West had to pay an extra $300
because when she originally ordered her
Powerbook 145, she bought it for a special
promotional price of $1673 — about $50

less than the current price of $1717.
"I was mad about the discount," West
said. "They should have done something to
compensate."
But she said the Microdisc representa
tives told her she would have to wait until
February or March to receive the Power
book 145. So she decided to upgrade her
order for the sake of convenience.
"A 145 is as good as a 160 for word pro
cessing, and that's what I'm basically using
it for," she said. "But I did not want to
wait."
Neither Apple nor Microdisc plan to com
pensate those purchasers of the Powerbook
145 who upgraded their orders to expedite
delivery.
Not everybody wished to pay an extra
$250 for a few added functions.
Freshman Calvin Chen ordered
his Powerbook 145 Oct. 5. He said
he was promised his computer in
three weeks, but it did not arrive
for three months.
"It was really inconvenient for
me because I didn't have a com
puter to use," he said.
Chen said he wanted a Power
book 145 because it was portable
and he didn't need the extra $250
worth of features.
"I felt kind of ripped off," he
said. "If I had known it was going
to take this long, I would've gone
somewhere else."
Rice said Microdisc made an
attempt to contact the people

whose Powerbook 145 orders
were backlogged. But since they
were not receiving accurate infor
mation from Apple, they did not
have a set time prediction.
"We tried to call, but then peo
ple wanted an estimate and we did
not want to say we didn't know,"
he said. "We can't make a com
mitment without Apple's ship
ping schedule."
However, both West and fresh
man Sarah Harrigan said they
were never contacted by the
Microdisc department. Chen said
Microdisc informed him of the
delay only after Chen called first.
Harrigan also upgraded her
order from a Powerbook 145 to a
Powerbook 160 model after
almost three months of waiting.
She said she was so outraged by
the disorganization that she filed
a complaint with Apple.

"When I went in to Microdisc,
they said Apple was having trou
ble producing and suggested I
cancel my order," she said. "It's a
really inefficient system."
Microdisc is still taking orders
for the Powerbook 145, but Rice
said it is trying to discourage
them because of the uncertainty
of their availability. However, he
said the delivery cycle is slowly
getting better.
Kinley said the factories at
Apple are working at full produc
tion and added she hopes that the
backlog is under control by the
end of March.
Rice agreed that the backlog is
frustrating, but said it cannot be
controlled.
"It's a symptom of the growth
of the industiy," he said. "These
situations might arise again, like
it or not."

were not receiving accurate infor
mation from Apple, they did not
have a set time prediction.
"We tried to call, but then peo
ple wanted an estimate and we did
not want to say we didn't know,"
he said. "We can't make a com
mitment without Apple's ship
ping schedule."
However, both West and fresh
man Sarah Harrigan said they
were never contacted by the
Microdisc department. Chen said
Microdisc informed him of the
delay only after Chen called first.
Harrigan also upgraded her
order from a Powerbook 145 to a
Powerbook 160 model after
almost three months of waiting.
She said she was so outraged by
the disorganization that she filed
a complaint with Apple.

"When I went in to Microdisc,
they said Apple was having trou
ble producing and suggested I
cancel my order," she said. "It's a
really inefficient system."
Microdisc is still taking orders
for the Powerbook 145, but Rice
said it is trying to discourage
them because of the uncertainty
of their availability. However, he
said the delivery cycle is slowly
getting better.
Kinley said the factories at
Apple are working at full produc
tion and added she hopes that the
backlog is under control by the
end of March.
Rice agreed that the backlog is
frustrating, but said it cannot be
controlled.
"It's a symptom of the growth
of the industiy," he said. "These
situations might arise again, like
it or not."
One of freshman Amy West's first mtyor
purchases at college was a computer she'd
be able to use for the next four years. When
she ordered an Apple Macintosh Powerbook
145 in mid-October, she was told it would
take three to four weeks to receive her
portable laptop.
Now, three months later, she still does not
have a computer. She should be receiving her
machine soon, but only because she upgrad
ed her order — for an additional $300.
Apple Computers, Inc. has had a $1 bil
lion backlog of computer orders because of
internal difficulties, including the growing
popularity of the Powerbook computers,
said Chester Rice, Microdisc Manager of the
Stanford Bookstore.

"The demand exceeded the supply," said
Rice. "There are constraints everywhere,
not just at Stanford."
Pat Kinley, public relations specialist at
Apple, said there is a shortage of many types of
Apple computers, notjust the Powerbook 145.
The Powerbook 145 model is more scarce than
the other two models, the Powerbooks 160
and 180, because it came out in August, two
months before the other models.
"There was an immediate demand for
the 145," she said. "Since it was released be
fore the other two models, there has been
more time to demand more."
It normally takes anywhere from a few
days to a few weeks to receive a computer
through the Bookstore, although "it totally
fluctuates" according to Rice.
Because of the backlog of Apple's Macin
tosh Powerbook 145, a minority of the peo

ple who had purchased the Powerbook 145
opted to change their orders, said Rice. The
options included canceling the order for a
full refund, switching to another manufac
turer or, like West, changing to a different
Macintosh computer.
Many of the buyers, including West,
changed their orders to a Powerbook 160, a
slightly superior model which costs about
$250 more than the Powerbook 145. The
Powerbook 160 model is also more widely
available.
"(Customers) had to pay a little bit more,
but they got a newer and better machine,"
Rice said. "For instance, the Powerbook 160
can be plugged into a color monitor."
However, West had to pay an extra $300
because when she originally ordered her
Powerbook 145, she bought it for a special
promotional price of $1673 — about $50

less than the current price of $1717.
"I was mad about the discount," West
said. "They should have done something to
compensate."
But she said the Microdisc representa
tives told her she would have to wait until
February or March to receive the Power
book 145. So she decided to upgrade her
order for the sake of convenience.
"A 145 is as good as a 160 for word pro
cessing, and that's what I'm basically using
it for," she said. "But I did not want to
wait."
Neither Apple nor Microdisc plan to com
pensate those purchasers of the Powerbook
145 who upgraded their orders to expedite
delivery.
Not everybody wished to pay an extra
$250 for a few added functions.
Freshman Calvin Chen ordered
his Powerbook 145 Oct. 5. He said
he was promised his computer in
three weeks, but it did not arrive
for three months.
"It was really inconvenient for
me because I didn't have a com
puter to use," he said.
Chen said he wanted a Power
book 145 because it was portable
and he didn't need the extra $250
worth of features.
"I felt kind of ripped off," he
said. "If I had known it was going
to take this long, I would've gone
somewhere else."
Rice said Microdisc made an
attempt to contact the people

whose Powerbook 145 orders
were backlogged. But since they
were not receiving accurate infor
mation from Apple, they did not
have a set time prediction.
"We tried to call, but then peo
ple wanted an estimate and we did
not want to say we didn't know,"
he said. "We can't make a com
