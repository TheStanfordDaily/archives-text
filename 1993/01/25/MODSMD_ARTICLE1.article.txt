# Unwilling candidate
## Prof. will decline attorney general position if asked 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff With AP wire reports 
Law School Prof. Barbara Bab
cock, widely mentioned as a possi
ble attorney general candidate,
said yesterday she will not accept
the nomination if offered.
"I am very pleased that my
name has come up but the timing is
not right for me," said Babcock, a
former Justice Department official
in the Carter administration. "I
have been really very involved in
teaching at the Law School and in
my scholarship. I'm not ready now

to disrupt it."
President
Clinton's original
nominee for at
torney general,
Zoe Baird, with
drew early Friday
morning amidst
intense opposi
tion after she ad
mitted hiring two

illegal aliens to work in her home.
Though Clinton has not given
any details on candidates he is
considering to replace Baird, he
has instructed his staff to look at
"three or four folks."
Babcock was one of four possi
ble candidates mentioned by
White House and congressional
sources over the weekend. The
three others were: U.S. District
Judge Patricia Wald, who turned
down the job in November; New
York State Appeals Judge Judith
Kaye; and 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals Judge Amalya Kearse.
Others who may be considered
include: Peter Edelman, who is
running Clinton's Justice Depart
ment transition team; his wife,
Marian Wright Edelman, head of
the Children's Defense Fund; and
Susan Thomases, a liberal New
York lawyer who was a senior
Clinton campaign aide.
In searching for the new ad
ministration's final cabinet mem
ber, officials said Clinton is not
looking just at women candidates.
"The president is going to look
for the best person to fill the
post," George Stephanopoulos,
the White House communications
director, said Friday.
Babcock said she has not yet
been contacted by the Clinton ad
ministration.
"I haven't heard from them
yet, but I've been called by quite a
few news organizations," she said.


Babcock
Babcock, who is currently
working on a book about Califor
nia's first woman lawyer, said she
is "pleased lots of other women
are on the list."
"We've come to a point where
women could be appointed attor
ney general because so many
women have come into the field of
law," she said. "This book is about
the rise of women in law and it's

important I write about that."
Asked if Clinton would return
to earlier lists, which included
Stanford Law School graduate
Brooksley Born, Stephanopoulos
said: "I wouldn't rule that out,
but he is starting the process
anew."
Born, considered a leading can
didate before Baird's nomination,
was the first woman president of
the Stanford Law Review.
Many believe Clinton shied
away from Born because she was
closely allied with the feminist
movenventr According'to transi

tion officials, Clinton wanted an
attorney general without a specif
ic agenda. But with Baird's depar
ture, Born may again emerge as a
leading candidate.
Unlike Baird, who served for
only a short stint in the White
House legal office, Babcock has
significant Justice Department
experience. From 1977-79, she
took a leave of absence from
Stanford to serve as assistant
attorney general in the Justice
Department's civil division, head
ing a staff of more than 1,000
lawyers.

She joined the Stanford Law
School faculty in 1972 as the first
tenure-track woman professor.
Prior to that, she served as
director of the District of
Columbia's public defender ser
vice. She was the first woman to
hold that post.
But at this point in her career,
she said that being the first
woman attorney general doesn't
really appeal to her.
"You come to the point where
it's wonderful that other people
are able to be the first as well,"
she said.
