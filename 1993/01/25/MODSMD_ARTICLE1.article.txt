# Unwilling candidate
## Prof. will decline attorney general position if asked 
### Rajiv Chandrasekaran Editorial staff With AP wire reports 
Law School Prof. Barbara Bab
cock, widely mentioned as a possi
ble attorney general candidate,
said yesterday she will not accept
the nomination if offered.
"I am very pleased that my
name has come up but the timing is
not right for me," said Babcock, a
former Justice Department official
in the Carter administration. "I
have been really very involved in
teaching at the Law School and in
my scholarship. I'm not ready now

to disrupt it."
President
Clinton's original
nominee for at
torney general,
Zoe Baird, with
drew early Friday
morning amidst
intense opposi
tion after she ad
mitted hiring two

illegal aliens to work in her home.
Though Clinton has not given
any details on candidates he is
considering to replace Baird, he
has instructed his staff to look at
"three or four folks."
Babcock was one of four possi
ble candidates mentioned by
White House and congressional
sources over the weekend. The
three others were: U.S. District
Judge Patricia Wald, who turned
down the job in November; New
York State Appeals Judge Judith
Kaye; and 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals Judge Amalya Kearse.
Others who may be considered
include: Peter Edelman, who is
running Clinton's Justice Depart
ment transition team; his wife,
Marian Wright Edelman, head of
the Children's Defense Fund; and
Susan Thomases, a liberal New
York lawyer who was a senior
Clinton campaign aide.
In searching for the new ad
ministration's final cabinet mem
ber, officials said Clinton is not
looking just at women candidates.
"The president is going to look
for the best person to fill the
post," George Stephanopoulos,
the White House communications
director, said Friday.
Babcock said she has not yet
been contacted by the Clinton ad
ministration.
"I haven't heard from them
yet, but I've been called by quite a
few news organizations," she said.
