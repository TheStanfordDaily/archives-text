## Capitol Hill conflict Gays in military spur Congressional revolt 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Defense Sec
retary Les Aspin said yesterday he wants
to head off a potential "revolt" among
Congress and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
over President Clinton's plan to lift the
ban on homosexuals in the military.
As Clinton prepared for a meeting
today with the joint chiefs of the armed
services, Aspin said "they and the militaiy
.. . have to understand that the president
is deeply committed to . .. end discrimina
tion against homosexuals in the military."
"My argument to the military is soon
er or later, the courts are going to come
at you on this issue," Aspin said on CBS
TV's "Face the Nation."
Clinton should give the defense secretary
six months to prepare an executive order
lifting the ban, according to a Jan. 18 draft
of a memo from Aspin to the president.
Time magazine reported that Joint

Chiefs Chairman Colin Powell might
resign if Clinton lifts the ban on gays.
Army Col. Bill Smullen, a spokesman
for Powell, denied the Time report, saying
the chairman does not intend to resign,
although he does oppose the move.
The memo to Clinton suggests the
president hold meetings with "key sena
tors" and with the Joint Chiefs.
"This is not a negotiation," said the
memo "instead, it is the first step in the
consultation that you have promised."
But Aspin said the opposite on CBS.
"The point is, is that it is a negotiation,"
he said. "As a practical matter, we are not
going to be able to force this down the
throats of the Congress."
Aspin's memo says that if Senate con
servatives were to propose a resolution in
support of the current policy, there would
be "no more than 30 sure votes" against it.
