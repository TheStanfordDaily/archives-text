# Threatening Balkan peace
## Croatian attack shatters calm 
### 
ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — Croatia
said it has ended a surprise offensive
that shattered a year of calm with rebel
Serbs, but fighting raged near the port
of Zadar and there were reports of bat
tles farther south yesterday.
Fierce fighting also was reported in
eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, where
Muslim forces are trying to clear Bosni
an Serb troops from a region along the
border. Fighting between Muslims and
Croats was reported in central Bosnia.
The upsurge in fighting and tough
words from leaders of all ethnic factions
in the former Yugoslav federation
threatened to undo international peace
talks and heightened fears of a wider
war in the Balkans.
In Geneva, where leaders of the fac
tions met to discuss a peace plan for
Bosnia, Yugoslav President Dobrica
Cosic demanded the U.N. Security Coun
cil condemn the Croatian attacks and

insisted Croatia withdraw its soldiers
from areas seized from Serb militants.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
said in an interview with Croatian TV
that his troops attacked Friday out of
frustration over Serb refusals to allow
reconstruction of a bridge at Maslenica.
Before Friday, Serbs held one end of
the bridge and Croats the other. The
bridge is on the only land route linking
Zagreb, Croatia's capital, with the Dal
matia region along the Adriatic coast.
Croatian troops apparently seized
the other end of the bridge and made
other gains in territory occupied by the
rebels. "This action is now over," Tudj
man said. But he said Croatian troops
would not give up their gains.
Serbs, who account for 12 percent of
Croatia's population, captured one-third
of Croatian territory in a seven-month
war in 1991 that erupted after Croatia
seceded from Serbia-dominated

Yugoslavia. At least 10,000 people are
thought to have died in the fighting,
which was halted by a truce last January.
Tudjman's spokeswoman, Vesna
Skare, said 10 Croatian soldiers were
killed and 30 wounded in Friday's fight
ing. The Serbs reported 29 of their peo
ple killed.
Cosic, upon returning to Belgrade,
charged that Croatia had "ripped up the
Vance peace plan."
Zivota Panic, chief of Yugoslav
army's general staff, charged that some
U.N. peacekeeping units "encouraged"
the attack by Croatian troops. He did
not elaborate, but pledged in a letter to
U.N. commanders to protect Serbs in
Croatia if U.N. forces could not.
A U.N. forces spokesperson in
Zagreb, Shannon Boyd, called the Croa
tian attack a "major setback" for peace
efforts but argued that "it is certainly
not irreversible."
