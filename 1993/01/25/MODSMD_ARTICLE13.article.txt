# Iraq denies attacking planes

BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) â€” Iraq
denied its anti-aircraft batteries
fired at U.S. warplanes again and
insisted yesterday that the cease
fire it declared last week remained
in effect.
The claims came a day after
U.S. warplanes attacked Iraqi
missile sites for the third consecu
tive day.
In Washington, Defense Secre
tary Les Aspin said it was not cer
tain the Iraqis opened fire Satur
day night in the southern "no fly"
zone, but he stressed the pilot
thought he was shot at.
U.S. military spokesmen stood
by the report that American
planes were fired on, and a second
pilot on the aircraft carrier USS
Kitty Hawk reported seeing gun
flashes during the Saturday night
incident.
Aspin also reported that there
was "some indication" that Iraqi
troops were preparing new sites for
anti-aircraft missiles, despite allied

warnings to keep such weapons out
of the air exclusion zone.
Appearing on CBS's "Face the
Nation," Aspin said recent Iraqi
action "was not proof that Sad
dam Hussein's government was
trying to test the new U.S. admin
istration, or that it had broken its
own cease-fire.
Iraq's information minister,
Hamed Yousef Hummadi, called
for "pragmatic, businesslike dis
cussion" with the United States.
In an interview with CNN,
Hummadi said the recent U.S.
attacks were "minor ones, and we
are committed to the cease-fire."
But if attacks continue, the two
sides could be in for a difficult
time, he said.
In another development, hun
dreds of Jordanians marched
through the streets of Amman
cheering Hussein and chanting
anti-American slogans. Many
Arabs are criticizing the West for
being harsher on Iraqis than oth

ers who ignore U.N. resolutions.
Clinton has pledged to contin
ue the policy begun by President
Bush to respond strongly to Iraqi
threats to allied planes in the air
exclusion zones.
The United States has said its
planes attacked air defense sites
in the "no fly" zones on Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday after
hostile acts by Iraqi troops.
Iraq has repeatedly denied its
forces fired at or turned targeting
radar on any allied planes since it
announced a cease-fire beginning
Wednesday.
Despite the repeated air strikes,
U.N. experts resumed destruction
of mustard and nerve gas at the
Muthanna complex north of Bagh
dad, said the team's leader, Paul
Brough. The team, which had been
kept out of Iraq for several weeks,
is acting under a Gulf War cease
fire provision requiring Iraq to dis
mantle weapons of mass destruc
tion.
