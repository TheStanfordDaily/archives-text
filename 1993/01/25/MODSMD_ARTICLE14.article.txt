Thurgood Marshall dead at 84
WASHINGTON (AP) - Retired Justice Thur
good Marshall, the most prominent civil rights
attorney of his generation and the first black to
serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, died yesterday
of heart failure. He was 84.
Marshall was a hearty, blunt-spoken, irascible
figure — from the outset a liberal activist who
looked out for disadvantaged Americans.
Marshall had been in failing health for the past
several years and left the court in 1991.
As a lawyer for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, Marshall argued
and won the landmark Brown vs. Board of Educa
tion desegregation case before the court in 1954.
Bush discovered 'in the loop'
WASHINGTON (AP) — A document in the
hands of Iran-Contra prosecutors indicates
George Bush asked Honduran President Jose
Azcona Hoyo in 1986 to help secretly move guns
to the Nicaraguan Contras."
It has been known that then-President Reagan

made his vice president an emissary to Honduras
in 1985 and 1986. But what hasn't been known is
that Bush's mission in 1986 was specifically to get
Azcona to "assure a supplied front" that allowed
military equipment and other materiel to reach
the U.S.-backed Contras.
The document shows that Bush, who has publicly
maintained he was "out of the loop" for all of the Iran-
Contra scandal, was deeply involved in the Reagan
administration's effort to find secret ways to help the
Contras militarily after Congress banned such help.
Three Somalis killed
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Three Somalis
were killed and at least five were wounded in
clashes yesterday with troops of a U.S.-led coali
tion trying to safeguard efforts to feed the coun
try's starving.
Despite the presence of more than 38,000 allied
troops, Somalia remains dangerous. The violence
led Col. Marc Jacqmin, the commander of Belgian
troops here, to warn development officials from
the European Community and Belgium not to
visit Kismayu as they had planned.
