## Presidential advice 
### 
Casper should give
addresses, attend
classes at Stanford

That Gerhard Casper. He's got
to get out more. If he's to fix
this place — if he's to
breathe new life into this institu
tion slowly slipping in the ranks of
that gospelized U.S. News and
World Reports thing — he's got to
see it, hear about it and talk about
• A n» A 1 1 A 1 A • A •

it first-hand. And not just seeing
Stanford at its prettiest: the Win
ter One Acts he attended on

l/Wi A iV/ VU AIV/ UHUVIIUV\
Saturday, the football
games he tries to under
stand with inappropri

ate soccer analogies, the
really long ASSU meet
ings he pretends to take
seriously.

No. He's got to see the
steamy underbelly that is
Stanford University. The

vomiting in the freshman
dorm bathrooms. The soy
enhanced product Food Service
continually refers to as Chinese
food. The professors who drone on
and on until they finally return to
the topic at hand.
In order to get more in touch
with the University qua University,
Casper should begin a policy of tak
ing 50 minutes out of each week to
attend a lecture class.
After spending months and
months talking about academia as
a metaphysical entity, it's time to
investigate Stanford in action.
Which professors, which classes,
indeed, which departments, aren't
living up to expectations? And
which students are sleeping in
class? Playing high school principal
once a week would give Casper an
acute perspective which he would
find invaluable in his role of Über
administrator.
For someone who spends his
spare time reading 16th-century
French humanists, it would do

Casper well to see what students
actually listen to in class, and judge
for himself how well a CIV lecturer
can connect the changing designs of
urinals with the wisdom of
Rabelais.
Secondly, Casper should address
the entire student body with a
State of the University address —
two or three times a year. Such an
address (possibly to be held at
Memorial Auditorium or Dinkel
spiel) would allow students to feel
part of the decision-making process
and changes which are taking place

— not completely unlike Ross
Perot's electronic town halls, but
unlike enough.

Casper currently
meets with the ASSU each
quarter, holding a signifi
cant question-and-answer
session with those sena
tors which happen to be

' present. These meetings
are important, but they
ii would be significantly
\ more beneficial if they
Jrtook place before the
- entire student body.

Most students pay
little attention to the activities of
the ASSU, and receive scant infor
mation at best from Casper's quar
terly meetings with the student
government body. If Casper were to
give quarterly or bi-annual
addresses, not only would under
graduates and graduates be more
informed about the activities of the
administration, but they would get
a chance to see what the president
of their University is really like.
Few students have had com
plaints about Casper during his
first four months as University
president. That's probably because
they haven't the foggiest idea of
what he's done or plans to do dur
ing his tenure.
And although Casper must have
incredible demands on his time as
president, students deserve, at the
very least, a bi-annual address
from their leader as well a more
detailed look at their academic life.
They might not want a COFJ but
they do want a president.
