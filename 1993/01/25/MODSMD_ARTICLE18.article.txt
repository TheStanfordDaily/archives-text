## Getting the whole picture 
### 
Tolerance at Stanford is a
funny concept. At a school com
prised of students accustomed to
vigorously defending their personal
beliefs, it can be difficult to overcome the
impulse to "win" the discussion instead
of listening clearly to different view
points.
Ironically, some of the most closed
minded people on campus actually claim
tolerance to be their guiding light in life.
Any point of view digressing from their
personal beliefs is found to be unaccept
able, an immediate candidate for censor
ship.
Berkeley's paper, The Daily Cal, has
actually refused advertising from groups
whose political beliefs are in opposition to
the editors', a case of editorial discretion
leaping a few yards out of bounds. Last
year, protests denounced the decision to
allow William F. Buckley to speak on
campus, as if somehow his opinions could
be declared wrong without his ever
expressing them.
Trying to restrict access to opposing
viewpoints is just as wrong now as it was
when they were burning books and
thumping Bibles.
But just hearing other points of view
isn't enough. At Stanford especially, where
standards are so much higher, we should
understand that true tolerance implies
listening to other viewpoints as well.
Opposing an argument while neglect

ing its intricacies is ignorant and irre
sponsible at best. It takes a pretty feeble
mind to label anything left-of-center as
"politically correct" and consider that an
academic rebuttal. "Politically correct"
and all of the myriad other buzzwords
floating through our conversations are
annoying tools of the dim, reducing com
plicated issues to a few simple syllables.
This blade of ignorance is sharp no
matter which direction it's blindly
thrusted. It's easier for people to twist an
issue into something simple and easy to
disagree with than to understand it fully.
Case in point: I wrote a column two
weeks ago on standards of beauty as they
affect both men and women. Yet respons
es focused on just one dimension of my
argument, ignoring the complete issue I
had addressed — lamenting the swimsuit
models, but ignoring the Chippendale
dancers; disparaging "slim waists and
ample chests," but not "tall and brawny"
men; pointing out the anorexia, but
glossing over the steroid abuse.
I'm sorry that supermodels eat lettuce
heads for dinner, as somebody pointed
out. But two days before the quarter
began I attended the funeral of a friend of
mine, who — after gaining over 100
pounds of muscle in less than a year —
shot himself in the face this past Christ
mas Day in a bout of steroid-induced
depression. I just can't accept that lettuce
heads are the only aspects of the issue.

Why intentionally chop it in half, then?
Because the concept that everyone faces
standards of beauty is more complicated
than some are willing or equipped to con
front. "Sexism," on the other hand, is a
safer concept to cling to — even if it
requires irresponsibly misrepresenting the
original point, or ignoring it altogether.
Oppression of women, like political
correctness, is an accusation that often
requires little thought, immediately con
juring negative images and winning
instant allies whether or not it's accu
rately applied.
Free expression is a powerful concept.
If an idea is worth your energy to believe,
it's more than worth your energy to
defend. If someone expresses an opinion
you don't agree with, you don't have the
right to silence them. You have the
responsibility to challenge them, and
challenge them intelligently. If an opin
ion is right, it will stand up to these chal
lenges; if it's wrong, we'll be able to form
a new one.
But if we don't allow a clash, we'll
never know for sure.
