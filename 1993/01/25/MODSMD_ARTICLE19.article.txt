Huyck gets a i serious' challenge from disgruntled reader

I HAD SECOND THOUGHTS about
writing to The Daily about columnist
Pete Huyck, because at this point it
seems like beating a dead horse. Howev
er, unlike the slew of letters that have
appeared over the last few weeks, the
purpose of this letter is not to critique
Huyck's works or scold him for being
tasteless and immature.
Instead, I am writing purely to vent
my anger. I have tried to ignore Huyck's
column, because, quite simply, it is not
worthy of my time or trouble. Even with
this in mind, I feel physically incapable
(and believe me, I realize this is a weak
ness) of letting Huyck retire without fac

ing consequences.
As offensive as his words are, they are
not what irks me the most. Huyck deliv
ers his attacks in a forum conveniently
constructed so as to preclude fair rebut
tal. Would he write so carelessly if he
knew he would have to defend himself
with a rational response?
I suppose he thinks he can brazenly
insult every member of this community
and then go on with his life as though
his column were nothing more than a
big joke. Well, Pete, it wasn't a joke, and
we won't let you off that easy.
Pete Huyck is a coward, pure and
simple. He attacks every group on cam

pus with the illusion of bravery, but is
he really willing to stand behind his
words? The First Amendment protects
our right to free speech, and those who
test these boundaries should be respect
ed. In my opinion, this is not Huyck's
motive, though he may claim it is.
The First Amendment protects heart
felt and meaningful ideas that may seem
controversial. Huyck's work, on the
other hand, shows a young man using
this sacred right as nothing more than a
self-indulgent toy. Last Friday, you chal
lenged Prof. Jeremy Cohen to a fight in
White Plaza at noon. I, too, would like to
make a challenge.

Huyck, you thrive in a world of intim
idation and senseless bullying where you
are never held accountable for your
words. For once, I want to see you
respond face to face with all the people
you have hurt. I formally challenge you
to something far more dangerous than
your physical threats: a serious discus
sion, face to face with me and anyone
else who wishes to see how tough you
really are, in person — not on paper.
This Friday. White Plaza. High Noon.
I'll be there. Will you?

Computerized library
check-out does not
impress grad student

With a degree of self-satisfaction evident,
the Stanford library staff recently
announced that library records have been
fully computerized for on-line service.
Funny, I remember using such an on
line service that even had the option of
sending the electronically checked-out
book to me via campus mail, at the Uni
versity of Illinois — in 1981! Welcome to
the '80s.
