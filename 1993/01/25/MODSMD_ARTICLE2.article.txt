# Gas lines to Webb Ranch workers' homes turned off
## Profs, declare Webbs negligent, demand University action 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Augustin Gonzalez stands on the wooden porch of
his family's weather-beaten trailer, holding the tiny
portable heater that has been the home's only source
of heat since early November.
"The kids have been really cold," he says. "This
can't heat the entire house." A worker at Webb
Ranch for the past 24 years, Gonzalez lives with his
wife and five children in the trailer, wedged close to

the edge of a shallow ravine at the ranch.
Eight families live year-round on the 237-acre veg
etable and berry farm, which is located on Stanford
land just off Alpine Road near Interstate 280 and has
been leased to the Webbs since 1922.
The Pacific Gas and Electric company shut off the
gas to Gonzalez's trailer and the homes of three other
families Nov. 11, telling the Webbs the 30-year-old
gas lines were unsafe.
San Mateo County building inspectors had been
pressuring the Webbs to repair the lines for the past

eight months, according to Reuben
Serna, a field representative for
the United Stanford Workers.
Meanwhile, a set of Manzanita
Park trailers — obtained by the
Webbs nearly two years ago to re
place the dilapidated existing trail
ers — sit unfinished and unoccu
pied.
Gary Webb, the president of
Webb Ranch, says installation of
the new trailers has been delayed
by the county's stringent building
requirements and the heavy rains
of the past two months.
"I'd like everyone to be moved
in now," he says. "We've been
moving as fast as we can go, but it
just takes time with the inspec
tions and regulations."
Serna, however, says the Webbs
have stalled and that if it weren't
for pressure from the county in
spectors, they would still not have
begun work on the new trailers.

ly's trailer at the ranch. Right: Old trailers from Manzanita Park, intended to replace the existing employee trailers, currently sit unfinished and
unoccupied at Webb Ranch. The University allowed any group that would pay to remove the old student residences to take them at no cost.
"From the time that the union
has pursued the trailers, Webb
Ranch management has sat on
it," Serna says. When the gas
lines were shut off, he says, the
union called Webb Ranch and
"told them it was their fault
because of their damn delays . ..
so they'd better do something
damn well fast."
Webb Ranch has been criti
cized in the past few years for
poor working and living condi
tions, including pay below the
minimum wage and exorbitant
charges for rent.
Three Stanford professors,
Political Science Profs. John
Manley and Luis Fraga and
English Prof. Ron Rebholz, are
urging Stanford's administration
to intervene and attempt to pro
vide the families with heat.
Manley and Rebholz were both
active in the drive for union repre
sentation for Webb Ranch work
ers three years ago, and say they
visited the ranch Jan. 12 with
Fraga to see whether conditions
had improved since the workers
joined the USW in April 1989.
Rebholz says they were
amazed to discover that some of
the families lack heat. "It has an
immediacy that's appalling," he
says. "They've gone through
some very, very cold, not to men
tion damp, days there."
Manley was even more critical,
saying: "This is poverty, and Stan
ford is profiting from it through the
lease with the Webbs and the Webbs
are profiting from it through the
exploitation of the workers."
Rebholz sent a letter to Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
Thursday, which said "while
Stanford has no legal obligation
to intervene, on ethical and com
passionate grounds, Stanford
should in my view act quickly to
solve the problem of the workers
who live on Stanford land."
Casper told the Faculty Senate
in a meeting Thursday afternoon
that the administration "is look
ing into" what he considers "a
real problem" at Webb Ranch.
The Webbs claim they have
done all they can to help the fami
lies, including spending a consider
able amount of their own money
working to install the new trailers.
Besides, conditions are not really
that bad, according to Webb.
"They have heat. They have
electric heaters. One family has a
wood stove," he says.

But the Solis family, which
owns the wood stove, purchased it
with their own money, according
to 16-year-old Tanya Solis. She
says her father has worked on the
ranch for 20 years, but "it doesn't
seem like [the Webbs] care."
The family has no hot water
for showers, and must either heat
water or go to a relative's house in
Redwood City to take a hot show
er, Solis says.
While the Solis family has the
wood stove, other families each
have only a three-foot-long Cole
man outdoor stove to do all of
their cooking.
Gonzalez says the Webbs
brought each family one of the
stoves about a week after the gas
was shut off. The stoves must be
used outside, however, which
makes it practically impossible to
cook in the rain. The only heat the
families have comes from portable
heaters provided by the union.
The new trailers are actually old
Manzanita Park trailers, obtained
when the University was preparing
for construction of the Manzanita
II dormitory and offered the trail
ers to anyone willing to pay the
costs to remove them.
Webb claims his company
spent about $1,700 to remove
each trailer, and has spent about
$20,000-$30,000 so far on them.
The union, he says, is also obli
gated to spend $20,000 on
installing the trailers, but "we
have yet to see it materialize."
Serna, however, angrily denies
that the union must pay for
readying the trailers. He says the
$20,000 union obligation Webb is
referring to is actually the settle
ment of a lawsuit, won by the
workers four months ago, that
sets up a fund to pay for mainte
nance and repairs of the trailers
once they are finished.
"Under the contract, the com
pany is supposed to have ade
quate housing out there and fin
ish the housing," Serna says.
"Once it is completed, then the
union or the workers will main
tain it. But the union or the
workers are not going to pay for
something that [the Webbs]
should have taken care of 50
years ago."
Webb criticizes the efforts of
the Stanford professors, saying
they are not backing up their
words with concrete actions. "It's
one thing to talk about it; it's
another thing to come out and
help get things done."
Webb adds that the only way
Stanford's administration can
help the situation is if they "bring
their checkbook."

Manley was even more critical,
saying: "This is poverty, and Stan
ford is profiting from it through the
lease with the Webbs and the Webbs
are profiting from it through the
exploitation of the workers."
Rebholz sent a letter to Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
Thursday, which said "while
Stanford has no legal obligation
to intervene, on ethical and com
passionate grounds, Stanford
should in my view act quickly to
solve the problem of the workers
who live on Stanford land."
Casper told the Faculty Senate
in a meeting Thursday afternoon
that the administration "is look
ing into" what he considers "a
real problem" at Webb Ranch.
The Webbs claim they have
done all they can to help the fami
lies, including spending a consider
able amount of their own money
working to install the new trailers.
Besides, conditions are not really
that bad, according to Webb.
"They have heat. They have
electric heaters. One family has a
wood stove," he says.

But the Solis family, which
owns the wood stove, purchased it
with their own money, according
to 16-year-old Tanya Solis. She
says her father has worked on the
ranch for 20 years, but "it doesn't
seem like [the Webbs] care."
The family has no hot water
for showers, and must either heat
water or go to a relative's house in
Redwood City to take a hot show
er, Solis says.
While the Solis family has the
wood stove, other families each
have only a three-foot-long Cole
man outdoor stove to do all of
their cooking.
Gonzalez says the Webbs
brought each family one of the
stoves about a week after the gas
was shut off. The stoves must be
used outside, however, which
makes it practically impossible to
cook in the rain. The only heat the
families have comes from portable
heaters provided by the union.
The new trailers are actually old
Manzanita Park trailers, obtained
when the University was preparing
for construction of the Manzanita
II dormitory and offered the trail
ers to anyone willing to pay the
costs to remove them.
Webb claims his company
spent about $1,700 to remove
each trailer, and has spent about
$20,000-$30,000 so far on them.
The union, he says, is also obli
gated to spend $20,000 on
installing the trailers, but "we
have yet to see it materialize."
Serna, however, angrily denies
that the union must pay for
readying the trailers. He says the
$20,000 union obligation Webb is
referring to is actually the settle
ment of a lawsuit, won by the
workers four months ago, that
sets up a fund to pay for mainte
nance and repairs of the trailers
once they are finished.
"Under the contract, the com
pany is supposed to have ade
quate housing out there and fin
ish the housing," Serna says.
"Once it is completed, then the
union or the workers will main
tain it. But the union or the
workers are not going to pay for
something that [the Webbs]
should have taken care of 50
years ago."
Webb criticizes the efforts of
the Stanford professors, saying
they are not backing up their
words with concrete actions. "It's
one thing to talk about it; it's
another thing to come out and
help get things done."
Webb adds that the only way
Stanford's administration can
help the situation is if they "bring
their checkbook."
Augustin Gonzalez stands on the wooden porch of
his family's weather-beaten trailer, holding the tiny
portable heater that has been the home's only source
of heat since early November.
"The kids have been really cold," he says. "This
can't heat the entire house." A worker at Webb
Ranch for the past 24 years, Gonzalez lives with his
wife and five children in the trailer, wedged close to

the edge of a shallow ravine at the ranch.
Eight families live year-round on the 237-acre veg
etable and berry farm, which is located on Stanford
land just off Alpine Road near Interstate 280 and has
been leased to the Webbs since 1922.
The Pacific Gas and Electric company shut off the
gas to Gonzalez's trailer and the homes of three other
families Nov. 11, telling the Webbs the 30-year-old
gas lines were unsafe.
San Mateo County building inspectors had been
pressuring the Webbs to repair the lines for the past

eight months, according to Reuben
Serna, a field representative for
the United Stanford Workers.
Meanwhile, a set of Manzanita
Park trailers — obtained by the
Webbs nearly two years ago to re
place the dilapidated existing trail
ers — sit unfinished and unoccu
pied.
Gary Webb, the president of
Webb Ranch, says installation of
the new trailers has been delayed
by the county's stringent building
requirements and the heavy rains
of the past two months.
"I'd like everyone to be moved
in now," he says. "We've been
moving as fast as we can go, but it
just takes time with the inspec
tions and regulations."
Serna, however, says the Webbs
have stalled and that if it weren't
for pressure from the county in
spectors, they would still not have
begun work on the new trailers.

ly's trailer at the ranch. Right: Old trailers from Manzanita Park, intended to replace the existing employee trailers, currently sit unfinished and
unoccupied at Webb Ranch. The University allowed any group that would pay to remove the old student residences to take them at no cost.
"From the time that the union
has pursued the trailers, Webb
Ranch management has sat on
it," Serna says. When the gas
lines were shut off, he says, the
union called Webb Ranch and
"told them it was their fault
because of their damn delays . ..
so they'd better do something
damn well fast."
Webb Ranch has been criti
cized in the past few years for
poor working and living condi
tions, including pay below the
minimum wage and exorbitant
charges for rent.
Three Stanford professors,
Political Science Profs. John
Manley and Luis Fraga and
English Prof. Ron Rebholz, are
urging Stanford's administration
to intervene and attempt to pro
vide the families with heat.
Manley and Rebholz were both
active in the drive for union repre
sentation for Webb Ranch work
ers three years ago, and say they
visited the ranch Jan. 12 with
Fraga to see whether conditions
had improved since the workers
joined the USW in April 1989.
Rebholz says they were
amazed to discover that some of
the families lack heat. "It has an
immediacy that's appalling," he
says. "They've gone through
some very, very cold, not to men
tion damp, days there."
Manley was even more critical,
saying: "This is poverty, and Stan
ford is profiting from it through the
