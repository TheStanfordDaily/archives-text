# Gas lines to Webb Ranch workers' homes turned off
## Profs, declare Webbs negligent, demand University action

Augustin Gonzalez stands on the wooden porch of
his family's weather-beaten trailer, holding the tiny
portable heater that has been the home's only source
of heat since early November.
"The kids have been really cold," he says. "This
can't heat the entire house." A worker at Webb
Ranch for the past 24 years, Gonzalez lives with his
wife and five children in the trailer, wedged close to

the edge of a shallow ravine at the ranch.
Eight families live year-round on the 237-acre veg
etable and berry farm, which is located on Stanford
land just off Alpine Road near Interstate 280 and has
been leased to the Webbs since 1922.
The Pacific Gas and Electric company shut off the
gas to Gonzalez's trailer and the homes of three other
families Nov. 11, telling the Webbs the 30-year-old
gas lines were unsafe.
San Mateo County building inspectors had been
pressuring the Webbs to repair the lines for the past

eight months, according to Reuben
Serna, a field representative for
the United Stanford Workers.
Meanwhile, a set of Manzanita
Park trailers — obtained by the
Webbs nearly two years ago to re
place the dilapidated existing trail
ers — sit unfinished and unoccu
pied.
Gary Webb, the president of
Webb Ranch, says installation of
the new trailers has been delayed
by the county's stringent building
requirements and the heavy rains
of the past two months.
"I'd like everyone to be moved
in now," he says. "We've been
moving as fast as we can go, but it
just takes time with the inspec
tions and regulations."
Serna, however, says the Webbs
have stalled and that if it weren't
for pressure from the county in
spectors, they would still not have
begun work on the new trailers.
