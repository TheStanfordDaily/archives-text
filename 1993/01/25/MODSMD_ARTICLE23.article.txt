## Revenge is sweet as Cardinal downs Trojans, 76-67 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
For the second time in six days, Stan
ford held USC to only 67 points. This
time, however, the Cardinal prevailed
before a sellout crowd of 7,500 at Maples
Pavilion.
Val Whiting led all players with 27
points and 12 rebounds, and Rachel Hem
mer dominated the closing minutes of last
Saturday's rematch, as the third-ranked
Cardinal avenged last Monday's upset in
Los Angeles, 76-67.
With the win, Stanford (14-3 overall)
moved into first place in the Pacific 10
Conference at 5-1.
"We did a much better job of getting
the ball inside," coach Tara VanDerveer
said, comparing Saturday's performance
with the game at USC.
Taking advantage of foul trouble that
limited Trojan superstar Lisa Leslie to
only 13 minutes of action (as well as a
career-low six points), Whiting, Hemmer
and Anita Kaplan combined for 54 points
on the night. The Cardinal's low-post trio
had managed only 24 points last Monday.
"It makes it easier because you don't
have to think about getting your shot
blocked," Whiting said, commenting on
the 6-foot-5-inch Leslie's reduced playing
time.
Hemmer scored all 14 of her points in
the second half, including 10 in the final
3:10, a stretch in which she single-hand
edly fouled out all three Trojan centers as
the Cardinal ended the game on a 15-5
run.
The sophomore forward converted 8-of
-9 free throws after drawing the fouls, and
hit both ends of a one-and-one situation
three times — all despite entering the
game shooting 68 percent from the line.
Only six seconds after sinking the free
throws from Leslie's fifth foul, Hemmer
stole the ball on a full-court press and
drew backup center Kim Gessig's fifth
personal. The Cardinal forward then com
pleted the trifecta 41 seconds later, foul
ing out Rashida Jeffery.
After Whiting missed a free throw,
Hemmer muscled around Jeffery for the

offensive rebound, scored on the put-back
and drew the foul. Total time: 47 seconds;
total damage: three USC disqualifica
tions.
Leslie first ran into foul trouble early in
the first half, sitting down with 13:33 to
go, but USC (11-4, 5-2) retained control of
the game throughout the period.
Point guard Nicky McCrimmon never
let Stanford get its running game started,
slowing the tempo to a snail's pace and
routinely winding down the shot clock
before launching her team's offense.
Senior Joni Easterly, who led USC with
25 points on the night, gave Stanford fits
throughout the contest.
The Cardinal seemed content to let
McCrimmon slow up the game, pressuring
the Trojan ball-handler only a few times
in the first half, and even falling back into
a 2-3 zone. As a result, McCrimmon was
able to use as many as 15 seconds per pos
session before even crossing the half-court
line.
Out-rebounded 24-17 and shooting dis
mally (32 percent), Stanford staggered
into the locker room at halftime, lucky to
have tied the score at 28 on Molly Good
enbour's jumper just before the buzzer.
Even as the second half opened, the
Cardinal continued to struggle, falling
behind by six with 15:44 to play.
But Christy Hedgpeth then nailed a
pair of three-pointers, firing up the sellout
crowd, and the two teams went on to trade
the lead five times in the second half.
McCrimmon blazed through the Cardi
nal defense to give USC its last lead at 62-
61. From then on, the message board at
Maples Pavilion kept flashing "Hemmer
Time."
Cardinal Notes
Whiting's 12 rebounds give her 1,007 for
her career. She is the only player in Pac-10 his
tory to surpass 1,000 rebounds. With her sec
ond board of the night, she passed the previous
record holder, Oregon's Stefanie Kasperski,
who pulled down 996 rebounds from 1987-90. .
. . Stanford's win was its 27th consecutive
home victory since its loss to Washington on
Feb. 9, 1991. . . . The Cardinal is now 4-0 in
front of capacity crowds at Maples.
