# 'Crunch time' play keys Stanford win
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
You can't help but admire a
team that comes through in the
clutch.
After the Cardinal's thrilling
come-from-behind victory over
USC last Saturday night, Stan
ford showed that even when fac
ing adversity, it still has an
uncanny ability to deliver during
crunch time.
For most of the first period,
the Stanford squad seemed one
step behind the visiting Trojans,
and it did not play like a top
ranked team. In fact, it didn't
even perform like one of the bet
ter teams in its own conference.
"I thought we played a real
poor first half," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "Our first half
(shooting] percentage hurt us a
lot."
However, down the stretch,
the defending national champion
Stanford squad finally appeared
on the Maples Pavilion floor. The
Cardinal guards began hitting
some three-pointers, the for
wards took charge down low near
the basket, and the entire team
jump-started its potent fast
break offense.
"I have a lot of confidence in
our team in that they'll listen
and make some adjustments at
halftime," VanDerveer said.
Every one of her players defi
nitely paid attention to Van-
Derveer at the break.
Slowly but surely, the Cardi
nal wore down its opponent in
the last few minutes of the con
test and in the process whipped
the sellout crowd of 7,500 into a
frenzy.
What made Saturday night's
victory even more special was
the fact that it came just five
days after Stanford's disappoint
ing loss to the Trojans on the
road.
With the defeat still fresh in
their minds, the Cardinal players
set out to regain the enviable
position of being the best team in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
"I think they had something
to prove tonight because we
already beat them," said USC
guard Joni Easterly. "They want
ed to prove that it was a fluke."
"Our team was mentally more
prepared and invested a lot emo
tionally into this game," Van-
Derveer said.

Along with its improved men
tality, Stanford also demon
strated its ability to adapt its
style of play in order to shut
down Lisa Leslie, USC's top
offensive player.
While Leslie single-handedly
destroyed the Cardinal last Mon
day, she was a non-factor on Sat
urday as she spent the entire
evening in foul trouble.
VanDerveer explained that on
offense, Stanford intentionally
passed the ball to its forwards as
much as possible, hoping to get
Leslie to commit fouls against
them.
"That was the difference [in
this game]," she said.
Even Trojan coach Marianne
Stanley was impressed with the
Cardinal's dramatic turn-around
from its previous outing against
use.
"They got the job done," she
said. "You've got to give them
credit for that."
