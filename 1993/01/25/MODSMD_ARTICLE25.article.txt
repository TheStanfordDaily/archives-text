"I think both meets went very well,"

The Cardinal men's swim team con
tinued its quest for an undefeated dual
meet season last weekend with decisive
wins over Arizona State and Arizona.
On Friday, the Stanford squad left
Arizona State trembling in its wake as
the Cardinal cruised to a 150-91 victory.
Stanford showed strength in the
freestyle events, as senior Erik Maurer
grabbed first place in the 50- and 100-
yard races with times of 20.31 and
45.11 seconds, respectively.
Freshman Joe Hudepohl chalked up
two more wins in the 200 (1:36.61) and
500 free (4:27.21), and classmate Mike
Covert added a strong second- place
finish in the grueling 1,000 free
(9:14.74).
Other Cardinal first-place finishes
came from Ray Carey in the 200 butter
fly (1:49.13), Derek Weatherford in the

what happened.'

said Parenti, a butterfly and freestyle
specialist. "The weather out there was
great — lots of sun and heat. At first we
were so excited to be out there that it
was hard to focus on the meet. We real
ized that we had a task to do though,
and we accomplished it."'
Cardinal coach Skip Kenney made
note of both the 80-degree Arizona
weather and the fact that his squad had
just come off of last week's emotional
victory against Michigan.

"We wanted to sneak into town, grab
two dual meet wins, and get outta
there," Kenney said. "We had a simple
goal — to swim well and win. That's

Along the way, Stanford just hap
pened to set four new pool records. In
addition to the marks established by
Weatherford and Hudepohl against the
Sun Devils, the Cardinal 400 medley
and free relays also set new standards
at ASU's Mona Plummer Aquatic Cen

ter. The 400 medley relay (Weatherford,
J.J. Freitag, Trip Zedlitz, Bill Schell)
turned in a time of 3:19.13 and the 400
free relay (Hudepohl, Eric Diehl, Tyler
Mayfield, Maurer) bested the previous
record with a time of 2:59.39. Both Car
dinal relays are undefeated in dual meet
competition thus far.
"It was a great team effort from top
to bottom," Kenney said. "We've got an
amazing dual meet squad — I wish the
dual meet season would go on forever."
However, rather than contemplating
the success of past meets, the Cardinal
squad is already looking ahead at the
big USC/UCLA weekend on Feb. 5 and
6.
"We'll be ready to swim fast against
those two schools," Kenney said. "Our
team is so flexible that we've already
used three or four different lineups —
other coaches have no idea where we'll
put our guys. I'd hate to write a lineup
to try to beat us."
