# Shooting woes continue as men fall to USC
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES— Just as all good things
come to an end, thankfully so did a bad one
Saturday.
After both teams collectively played one of
college basketball's worst halves this season,
Stanford failed to hit its shots down the
stretch and USC prevailed 63-55 at the Sports
Arena.
In a game featuring nine lead changes,
USC was able to be on the better end of the
final swing in the last seven minutes of the
contest. Forward Mark Boyd provided muscle
and intimidation inside late for the Trojans,
while teammate Tremayne Anchrum collect
ed seven of his 18 points in the closing min
utes to provide his team with a sufficient
cushion.
"We didn't make plays when they had to be
made," Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
said. "We weren't competitive inside, and
they got some mileage out of getting it inside
to the post."
After a Peter Dukes three-pointer with
2:21 to play cut the USC lead to 54-50, the
Cardinal veterans did not produce. Marcus
Lollie, who led the Cardinal with 19 points on
the day, double-dribbled on the next Stanford
possession, and had an inbound pass stolen by
Anchrum only a minute later.
Then, with 35 seconds to play, forward
Brent Williams — the only other Stanford
player to score in double figures — made an
errant pass downcourt that went out of
bounds, sealing USC's victory.
"Did I do my job in the end?" Lollie asked
rhetorically. "I don't think I did. I need to
keep working hard until we start winning."
Freshman guard Dion Cross, who led the
Cardinal in scoring in the previous three
games, managed only three points on the
afternoon after picking up two quick fouls in
the early minutes. But it was a shot that
should have fallen that was an indicator of
what was to come.
After Lollie gave Stanford a 42-40 lead

with 11:20 to go, Cross made a nice move to
the basket the next trip down the floor only to
have the ball stick between the backboard and
rim as it was spinning into the basket. A sub
sequent time out on the floor left Stanford
with a lead of two points rather than four,
and USC went on to outscore the Cardinal 22-
10 en route to victory.
Neither team did its job at the start of the
contest. It was not until the 16:10 mark of the
opening period that the 3,761 assembled at
the Sports Arena were awakened from their
daytime slumber as Lollie hit a three-point
jumper, causing the numbers on the score
board to change for the first time since the
opening tipoff.
For those lucky enough to have taped the
game, be thankful for the fast forward button.
But if you must watch, be forewarned — the
first-half display was not suitable for the eyes
of young children.
Before Lollie's three, the only positive note
was that each team improved its defensive
rebounding average, as Stanford and USC
were a combined 0-for-15 from the field in the
first four minutes of play.
And it did not get much better. Stanford
(6-11, 1-4 Pacific 10 Conference) shot 29.6
percent from the field in the first half, besting
the Trojans' equally horrible percentage of
23.1. Only six assists were amassed in the
period, while there were nine turnovers and
24 fouls.
USC (11-4, 4-2) decided they enjoyed miss
ing shots so much that they provided an
encore of aimlessness later in the half, failing
to convert a field goal between the 12- and six
minute marks. In fact, USC did not make a
two-point shot until Anchrum scored a layup
with 5:22 left in the half.
"I'm just happy we won," USC coach
George Raveling said. "It wasn't a great game
and we didn't play well, but so what? This
game was probably as good as the Super Bowl
will be."
Where Stanford was most effective in the
game was on the defensive end of the floor.
The Trojans came into the game averaging

seven three-pointers per game, but managed
just four against the Cardinal.
"Stanford did an excellent job getting out
on us and taking the three-point shot away,"
Raveling said.
The overall play on both sides improved
slightly in the second half, but while USC
managed to improve its shooting, Stanford's
attempts continued to falter. The Cardinal big
men missed several easy shots inside, and in
contrast to the UCLA game, the bench did not
provide substantial offensive firepower.
"We're not getting much production
inside," Montgomery said. "That really puts a
premium on the perimeter guys.
"We're not shooting the ball as well as I
think we can. We're getting good looks at the
basket, but the shots are just not going down.
We can play better than we're playing. It's not
like we're favored to come down here and win.
You can't shoot in the mid-30s and expect to
beat anybody."
USC's 43.5 percent proved to be enough.

bounds, sealing USC's victory.
"Did I do my job in the end?" Lollie asked
rhetorically. "I don't think I did. I need to
keep working hard until we start winning."
Freshman guard Dion Cross, who led the
Cardinal in scoring in the previous three
games, managed only three points on the
afternoon after picking up two quick fouls in
the early minutes. But it was a shot that
should have fallen that was an indicator of
what was to come.
After Lollie gave Stanford a 42-40 lead

with 11:20 to go, Cross made a nice move to
the basket the next trip down the floor only to
have the ball stick between the backboard and
rim as it was spinning into the basket. A sub
sequent time out on the floor left Stanford
with a lead of two points rather than four,
and USC went on to outscore the Cardinal 22-
10 en route to victory.
Neither team did its job at the start of the
contest. It was not until the 16:10 mark of the
opening period that the 3,761 assembled at
the Sports Arena were awakened from their
daytime slumber as Lollie hit a three-point
jumper, causing the numbers on the score
board to change for the first time since the
opening tipoff.
For those lucky enough to have taped the
game, be thankful for the fast forward button.
But if you must watch, be forewarned — the
first-half display was not suitable for the eyes
of young children.
Before Lollie's three, the only positive note
was that each team improved its defensive
rebounding average, as Stanford and USC
were a combined 0-for-15 from the field in the
first four minutes of play.
And it did not get much better. Stanford
(6-11, 1-4 Pacific 10 Conference) shot 29.6
percent from the field in the first half, besting
the Trojans' equally horrible percentage of
23.1. Only six assists were amassed in the
period, while there were nine turnovers and
24 fouls.
USC (11-4, 4-2) decided they enjoyed miss
ing shots so much that they provided an
encore of aimlessness later in the half, failing
to convert a field goal between the 12- and six
minute marks. In fact, USC did not make a
two-point shot until Anchrum scored a layup
with 5:22 left in the half.
"I'm just happy we won," USC coach
George Raveling said. "It wasn't a great game
and we didn't play well, but so what? This
game was probably as good as the Super Bowl
will be."
Where Stanford was most effective in the
game was on the defensive end of the floor.
The Trojans came into the game averaging

seven three-pointers per game, but managed
just four against the Cardinal.
"Stanford did an excellent job getting out
on us and taking the three-point shot away,"
Raveling said.
The overall play on both sides improved
slightly in the second half, but while USC
managed to improve its shooting, Stanford's
attempts continued to falter. The Cardinal big
men missed several easy shots inside, and in
contrast to the UCLA game, the bench did not
provide substantial offensive firepower.
"We're not getting much production
inside," Montgomery said. "That really puts a
premium on the perimeter guys.
"We're not shooting the ball as well as I
think we can. We're getting good looks at the
basket, but the shots are just not going down.
We can play better than we're playing. It's not
like we're favored to come down here and win.
You can't shoot in the mid-30s and expect to
beat anybody."
USC's 43.5 percent proved to be enough.

Marcus Lollie can only look back on what could have been as Jim
Morgan and the rest of his Cardinal teammates let the Trojans slip
away in a 63-55 loss.
LOS ANGELES— Just as all good things
come to an end, thankfully so did a bad one
Saturday.
After both teams collectively played one of
college basketball's worst halves this season,
Stanford failed to hit its shots down the
stretch and USC prevailed 63-55 at the Sports
Arena.
In a game featuring nine lead changes,
USC was able to be on the better end of the
final swing in the last seven minutes of the
contest. Forward Mark Boyd provided muscle
and intimidation inside late for the Trojans,
while teammate Tremayne Anchrum collect
ed seven of his 18 points in the closing min
utes to provide his team with a sufficient
cushion.
"We didn't make plays when they had to be
made," Stanford coach Mike Montgomery
said. "We weren't competitive inside, and
they got some mileage out of getting it inside
to the post."
After a Peter Dukes three-pointer with
2:21 to play cut the USC lead to 54-50, the
Cardinal veterans did not produce. Marcus
Lollie, who led the Cardinal with 19 points on
the day, double-dribbled on the next Stanford
possession, and had an inbound pass stolen by
Anchrum only a minute later.
Then, with 35 seconds to play, forward
Brent Williams — the only other Stanford
player to score in double figures — made an
errant pass downcourt that went out of
bounds, sealing USC's victory.
"Did I do my job in the end?" Lollie asked
rhetorically. "I don't think I did. I need to
