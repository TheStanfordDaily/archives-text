# Seniors take curtain call at Shrine: running backs rule in 31-17 contest
## 
### Mike Langford Editorial staff 
The East-West Shrine Game
meant many different things to
many different people.
In the big picture, the game
meant very little as far as college
football goes. The fact that the
East squad won the game 31-17
behind a strong running game
and a solid defense will probably

soon be forgotten. To a certain
degree, the halftime show was
more spectacular than the game
itself.
However, a Shrine Game
record 84,000 college football
fans enjoyed one more game
before going into hibernation
until next fall. Nearly 100
National Football League scouts
and administrada watched and
salivated over the prospect of

having one or more of the players
on their rosters following the
draft in late April. And players
took the gridiron to showcase
their talents in a final opportuni
ty to increase their stock in the
eyes of those scouts.
For many small college play
ers, the Shrine Game was a
chance simply to introduce
themselves by way of their tal
ent to a national television audi
ence and hopefully a spot in the
draft.
Middle Tennessee State run
ning back Walter Dunson did
just that. The senior showed his
blazing speed in runs from
scrimmage, kick returns and
receiving to gain over 100 all
purpose yards.
Dunson wasn't recruited by
any big colleges because he is
legally blind in his right eye. But
that didn't stop him from stand
ing out as perhaps the biggest
game-breaker in the bunch,
among even the Trevor Cobbs,
Russell Whites and Glyn Mil
burns.
"I'm real pleased with my
performance," Dunson said. "I
knew I had to do a little bit
extra, playing behind [Terryl
Kirby and [Chuckie] Dukes, so
that's what I did. I really felt I
could play with these guys."
The play of the quarterbacks
was unspectacular, allowing for
the emergence of Dunson and
other runners. Virginia running
back Kirby's strong rushing for
25 yards and led to two East
touchdowns, while Miami's
Heisman Trophy winner Gino
Torretta looked average for the
second time this month, tossing
an interception and more than a
few overthrows. Notre Dame's
Rick Mirer, Washington's Mark
Brunell and Weber State's
Jamie Martin were just as inef
fective.
The game earned Dukes, a
former Boston College star,
MVP honors on offense. But he
received the trophy more as a
representative of the ground
bound East offense than for his
game-high 62 rushing yards.

"I went out and did alright,"
Dukes said. "But [the MVP
award] really goes to the whole
East offense. A lot of guys came
up with a lot of great plays."
Arizona State linebacker
Brett Wallerstedt won the
defensive MVP after recording a
game-high 13 tackles and out
playing such standout defenders
as Texas A&M's Marcus Buck
ley, Washington's Dave Hoff
mann and Miami's Ryan
McNeil.
For California's White, the
game meant one more, and one
last, loss at Stanford Stadium.
"I just can't come out of this
stadium with a win," White
said. "I was even on the same
team as Stanford players and I
can't come out of here with a
win."
The coaches, including Texas
A&M's R.C. Slocum, Miami's
Dennis Erickson and North Car
olina State's Dick Sheridan,
used the opportunity to try long
bombs and trick plays. The
game featured a fleaflicker scor
ing the game's first touchdown,
a back-to-quarterback halfback
pass and a fumblerooskie.
For Pacific receiver Aaron
Turner, the end of the game
meant "back to classes." For
Fresno State fullback Lorenzo
Neal, it finally meant a chance
to break from football, at least
until the scouting combines
start up next month.
And for Chris Dalman, Ron
George and Milburn, the Shrine
Game meant one last chance to
play in Stanford Stadium before
graduating into the pros, and a
few last comments to make.
"Thank you [to the Stanford
fans] for the support and the
love," said George, who record
ed three tackles and a late-game
interception. "I've had so many
great moments here, I just hope
I gave something in return."
"I'll miss it," said Milburn,
who ran for less than 20 yards
and was kicked away from for
most of the game. "I've had a lot
of memorable experiences here.
That's all I can say."
