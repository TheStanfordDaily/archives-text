# Spikers win big in home opener
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Last Friday night, the Cardi
nal men's volleyball team — in
games marked by the absence of
two established seniors and the
presence of an up-and-coming
freshman — breezed by Califor
nia 15-7, 16-14, 15-1 at Burn
ham Pavilion.
Neither Ryan Moos nor Dave
Goss, two starters from last
year's Final Four team, suited up,
as both complained of sore shoul
ders. This necessitated a shakeup
of the Cardinal starting lineup,
with Canyon Ceman moving
from setter to swing hitter,
Jimmy Blackman moving to set
ter and freshman Mike Lambert
taking Goss' place at opposite hit
ter. These three — along with
swing hitter Bob Hill man and
middle blockers John Bezmali
novic and Joe Burghardt — com
prised a Cardinal starting lineup
that saw only one short-lived sub
stitution the entire night.
The Stanford spikers roared
through the first game. The tone
was set early by a diving Blackman
dig and two quick Ceman aces as
the Cardinal won easily, 15-7.
But some inaccurate Stanford
passing combined with some pow
erful California spikes — most
notably by Scott Bishop and Matt
Clark — almost led to a Cal victo
ry in the second game.
The teams began the game by
trading points until the score
was 6-6. A big spike by Clark
spurred the Bears to a 9-6 lead,
but Burghardt returned the
favor as the Cardinal spiked its
way back to 9-9.
Then Cal reached the high
point of its night, going ahead
14-12 and serving for match
point. But a huge Ceman spike
sided out for Stanford, and the
momentum switched irre
versibly. With Blackman serving
the last four points, the Cardinal
took the game 16-14 on blocks by
Hillman and Burghardt and a
final cross-court Lambert spike.
Led by Lambert's and
Ceman's vicious kills, the Cardi
nal did not let the Bears get close
in the third game. Winning the

first four and last 11 points, the
Cardinal cruised 15-1.
Lambert, the only Stanford
freshman not redshirting, was
the big story of the night. Play
ing in his first home collegiate
match, he led the Cardinal in
kills and blocks, with 16 and
four, respectively. He was also
among the team leaders with
three digs and two aces.
"I thought Lambert was the
best hitter on the court tonight,"
head coach Ruben Nieves said. "I
felt like whenever we set him,
the rally was going to end."
"He's got loads more talent
than I ever had as a freshman,"
said Goss, the first team Ail-
American whom Lambert
replaced. "Right now we're look
ing for more ways to get him on
the court because he is such a
talented player."
When Goss returns from his
injury next week, Lambert goes
back to the bench, a situation
which he accepts gracefully.
"I see my role as a backup to
Dave and possibly a backup
swing hitter as well. I am totally
willing to take that role," Lam
bert said. "It's a great team to
play for, on and off the court."
Moos' injury allowed the Car
dinal to experiment with a new
lineup it has worked on in prac
tice. Stanford moved All-Ameri
can setter Ceman to swing hitter
and let Blackman play setter.
Neither was ecstatic about his
own performance.
"It was frustrating because I
don't feel as comfortable at
swing hitter as I do at setter,"
Ceman said.
"I felt that the team played
pretty inconsistent," Blackman
said. "Just for some reason
things didn't seem smooth. I
blame myself for that because
I'm the setter."
Overall, Nieves was reason
ably happy with his team's per
formance. However, he did high
light one aspect of the squad's
play that needs work.
"We don't want to be streaky
and in game two we gave up two,
three and four points in a row. In
our league, if you give up a point,
you sideout the next time."
