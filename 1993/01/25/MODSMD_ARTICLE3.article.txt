# Pioneering heart transplant surgeon retires

For Norman Shumway, stepping down
as chair of the department of cardiac
surgery has meant more free time for golf
ing, some skiing and on the side, lobbying to
change organ donation laws.
Shumway, 69, left the post he had held
for more than 30 years earlier this month.
Mandatory retirement laws said his time
was up, and he agreed.
"We need someone else with different
ideas," Shumway said. "Some people hang
around much too long. That's bad for the
school and bad especially for the person."
In Shumway's case, it's hardly been bad
for the school. Thanks to the doctor's work
in developing heart transplant techniques,
Stanford's cardiology department has
gained widespread prominence.
"He's a great credit to the University,"
said Cardiothoracic Surgery Prof. Phillip
Oyer, who has worked with him since the
early '70s. "Anyone who has anything to do
with cardiology knows Shumway."
Heart transplants "are commonplace
around the world now," Oyer said, "and if it
weren't for [Shumway], it might very well
have not been done." In the '70s, when heart

transplants were not yet common practice,
Shumway was "the only one in the world
pursuing it with any vigor," Oyer said.
Shumway is still continuing with his work
after his retirement, performing surgery and
teaching a few medical school classes.
However, his main project nowadays is
working to get a presumed consent law
passed. The law would let doctors use a de
ceased person's organs — with the consent
of the next of kin — unless the person had
requested otherwise.
"It's a shame that only 10 percent of the
potential donors are being used," Shumway
said, because the scarcity of donors is the
greatest problem plaguing heart transplant
surgery.
The reasoning, Shumway said, is that
the next of kin are more likely to allow the

use of the organs if consent is presumed.
Shumway said he has already been con
tacted by several legislators and hopes to get
the law on the books within the next couple
of years.
This isn't the first time legal issues have
affected Shumway's work, though.
The concept of the heart transplant itself
meant trouble for the doctor when he began
his research in the late 19505, during his
first years at Stanford.
Shumway and Dr. Richard Lower were
trying to find a better way to protect the
heart during open heart surgery by experi
menting on dogs.
They decided to take a heart out and were
able to keep it going for about an hour.
From that came the idea that a heart could
possibly be kept alive and be transplanted
from one patient to another.
The first problem with heart transplants
on humans was medical: they had to find a
way to suppress the patient's immune sys
tem so that it wouldn't reject the new heart.
The other problem was with the law. At
the time, there was no concept of "brain
death." The definition of death hinged upon
heartbeat and circulation, so an operation
