# Pioneering heart transplant surgeon retires
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
For Norman Shumway, stepping down
as chair of the department of cardiac
surgery has meant more free time for golf
ing, some skiing and on the side, lobbying to
change organ donation laws.
Shumway, 69, left the post he had held
for more than 30 years earlier this month.
Mandatory retirement laws said his time
was up, and he agreed.
"We need someone else with different
ideas," Shumway said. "Some people hang
around much too long. That's bad for the
school and bad especially for the person."
In Shumway's case, it's hardly been bad
for the school. Thanks to the doctor's work
in developing heart transplant techniques,
Stanford's cardiology department has
gained widespread prominence.
"He's a great credit to the University,"
said Cardiothoracic Surgery Prof. Phillip
Oyer, who has worked with him since the
early '70s. "Anyone who has anything to do
with cardiology knows Shumway."
Heart transplants "are commonplace
around the world now," Oyer said, "and if it
weren't for [Shumway], it might very well
have not been done." In the '70s, when heart

cholesterol level is. Just

transplants were not yet common practice,
Shumway was "the only one in the world
pursuing it with any vigor," Oyer said.
Shumway is still continuing with his work
after his retirement, performing surgery and
teaching a few medical school classes.
However, his main project nowadays is
working to get a presumed consent law
passed. The law would let doctors use a de
ceased person's organs — with the consent
of the next of kin — unless the person had
requested otherwise.
"It's a shame that only 10 percent of the
potential donors are being used," Shumway
said, because the scarcity of donors is the
greatest problem plaguing heart transplant
surgery.
The reasoning, Shumway said, is that
the next of kin are more likely to allow the

use of the organs if consent is presumed.
Shumway said he has already been con
tacted by several legislators and hopes to get
the law on the books within the next couple
of years.
This isn't the first time legal issues have
affected Shumway's work, though.
The concept of the heart transplant itself
meant trouble for the doctor when he began
his research in the late 19505, during his
first years at Stanford.
Shumway and Dr. Richard Lower were
trying to find a better way to protect the
heart during open heart surgery by experi
menting on dogs.
They decided to take a heart out and were
able to keep it going for about an hour.
From that came the idea that a heart could
possibly be kept alive and be transplanted
from one patient to another.
The first problem with heart transplants
on humans was medical: they had to find a
way to suppress the patient's immune sys
tem so that it wouldn't reject the new heart.
The other problem was with the law. At
the time, there was no concept of "brain
death." The definition of death hinged upon
heartbeat and circulation, so an operation


Dr. Norman Shumway
to take out a still-functioning
heart out of a patient legally
meant killing that person.
Shumway was faced with
exactly this problem in a case dur
ing the late 19605.
A family of a homicide victim
wanted his heart to be used as a
transplant. Though the Stanford
Hospital had an agreement with
the Santa Clara County coroner
that no homicide victims would be
used as donors, the heart was
brought to the hospital and
Shumway went ahead with the
operation.
The defense attorneys used the
heart transplant as a last-shot

defense, arguing that the victim
had not really died until his heart
had been taken out. In legal
terms, the defendant had not
killed the victim; the doctors did
by taking out his heart.
The jury agreed, and the case
paved the way for a 1973 state law
which incorporates the idea of
brain death into the legislature's
definition of death.
Since then, Shumway has also
worked on artificial hearts and on
lung and liver transplants. He
completed the first successful
heart and lung transplant in 1981.
The people who get trans
plants generally would die within
six months without the surgery,
Shumway said. Thanks to new
drugs and improved techniques,
80 percent of patients live up to
one year.

Shumway has trained more
than 70 heart surgeons during his
years at Stanford.
One of his students was Bruce
Reitz, who just succeeded Shum
way as chairman. Reitz said that,
at first, he was awed by his
famous professor. "Then you find
out how human and personable
he is," he said.
Oyer agreed, saying that
Shumway is unlike other famous
doctors. "He's cut from a different
mold," he said. "He was never the
dictatorial authoritarian type."
For instance, in spite of his
knowledge about the heart,
Shumway is not a health fanatic.
"I have no idea what my choles
terol level is. Just don't smoke,
exercise, and don't get fat," he
said. "Preventive medicine is
highly overrated."

For instance, in spite of his
knowledge about the heart,
Shumway is not a health fanatic.

For Norman Shumway, stepping down
as chair of the department of cardiac
surgery has meant more free time for golf
ing, some skiing and on the side, lobbying to
change organ donation laws.
Shumway, 69, left the post he had held
for more than 30 years earlier this month.
Mandatory retirement laws said his time
was up, and he agreed.
"We need someone else with different
ideas," Shumway said. "Some people hang
around much too long. That's bad for the
school and bad especially for the person."
In Shumway's case, it's hardly been bad
for the school. Thanks to the doctor's work
in developing heart transplant techniques,
Stanford's cardiology department has
gained widespread prominence.
"He's a great credit to the University,"
said Cardiothoracic Surgery Prof. Phillip
Oyer, who has worked with him since the
early '70s. "Anyone who has anything to do
with cardiology knows Shumway."
Heart transplants "are commonplace
around the world now," Oyer said, "and if it
weren't for [Shumway], it might very well
have not been done." In the '70s, when heart

transplants were not yet common practice,
Shumway was "the only one in the world
pursuing it with any vigor," Oyer said.
Shumway is still continuing with his work
after his retirement, performing surgery and
teaching a few medical school classes.
However, his main project nowadays is
working to get a presumed consent law
passed. The law would let doctors use a de
ceased person's organs — with the consent
of the next of kin — unless the person had
requested otherwise.
"It's a shame that only 10 percent of the
potential donors are being used," Shumway
said, because the scarcity of donors is the
greatest problem plaguing heart transplant
surgery.
The reasoning, Shumway said, is that
the next of kin are more likely to allow the

use of the organs if consent is presumed.
Shumway said he has already been con
tacted by several legislators and hopes to get
the law on the books within the next couple
of years.
This isn't the first time legal issues have
affected Shumway's work, though.
The concept of the heart transplant itself
meant trouble for the doctor when he began
his research in the late 19505, during his
first years at Stanford.
Shumway and Dr. Richard Lower were
trying to find a better way to protect the
heart during open heart surgery by experi
menting on dogs.
They decided to take a heart out and were
able to keep it going for about an hour.
From that came the idea that a heart could
possibly be kept alive and be transplanted
from one patient to another.
The first problem with heart transplants
on humans was medical: they had to find a
way to suppress the patient's immune sys
tem so that it wouldn't reject the new heart.
The other problem was with the law. At
the time, there was no concept of "brain
death." The definition of death hinged upon
heartbeat and circulation, so an operation

to take out a still-functioning
heart out of a patient legally
meant killing that person.
Shumway was faced with
exactly this problem in a case dur
ing the late 19605.
A family of a homicide victim
wanted his heart to be used as a
transplant. Though the Stanford
Hospital had an agreement with
the Santa Clara County coroner
that no homicide victims would be
used as donors, the heart was
brought to the hospital and
Shumway went ahead with the
operation.
The defense attorneys used the
heart transplant as a last-shot

defense, arguing that the victim
had not really died until his heart
had been taken out. In legal
terms, the defendant had not
killed the victim; the doctors did
by taking out his heart.
The jury agreed, and the case
paved the way for a 1973 state law
which incorporates the idea of
brain death into the legislature's
definition of death.
Since then, Shumway has also
worked on artificial hearts and on
lung and liver transplants. He
completed the first successful
heart and lung transplant in 1981.
The people who get trans
plants generally would die within
six months without the surgery,
Shumway said. Thanks to new
drugs and improved techniques,
80 percent of patients live up to
one year.

Shumway has trained more
than 70 heart surgeons during his
years at Stanford.
One of his students was Bruce
Reitz, who just succeeded Shum
way as chairman. Reitz said that,
at first, he was awed by his
famous professor. "Then you find
out how human and personable
he is," he said.
Oyer agreed, saying that
Shumway is unlike other famous
doctors. "He's cut from a different
mold," he said. "He was never the
dictatorial authoritarian type."
For instance, in spite of his
knowledge about the heart,
Shumway is not a health fanatic.
"I have no idea what my choles
terol level is. Just don't smoke,
exercise, and don't get fat," he
said. "Preventive medicine is
highly overrated."
