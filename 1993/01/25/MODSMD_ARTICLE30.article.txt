# Women's gymnastics floors Cal

Sometimes 75 percent is good enough.
Despite another poor performance on the
vault, the No. 12 Stanford Cardinal women's
gymnastics team was plenty good in the other
three events as it defeated the No. 13 Califor
nia Golden Bears, 188.15 - 186.45, in Friday's
Big Meet at Berkeley's Harmon Gymnasium.
Finishing first in the all-around was Stan
ford's Jen 6 Elzie with a career-best and
school-record score of 38.975. Freshman Linda
Chun turned in a surprisingly impressive per
formance, finishing third with a 37.50.
A back injury had prevented Elzie from com
peting in the all-around the last two weeks, but
she showed no ill effects in setting the record.

'To be a great team, you
need to have two great
freshmen come in each
year. We had Katie (Clan
cy) and Jene last year,
and now Hillary and
Linda.'
— Breck Greenwood

"When we recruited her, we knew she would
be a star," coach Breck Greenwood said. "Now
she's starting to believe it, too."
Chun and fellow freshman Hillary Anderson
have both made tremendous impacts on the
team in their first year.
Chun has been one of Stanford's top two all
arounders in each meet this season, and Ander
son — who competes in three events — scored
a 9.85 on the bars Friday, the second-best mark
in Stanford history.
According to Greenwood, "To be a great
team, you need to have two great freshmen
come in each year. We had Katie (Clancy) and
Jene last year, and now Hillary and Linda."
The Bears were led by freshman Sirinda
Sincharoen, who finished second in the all
around with a score of 37.60. A torn Achilles
tendon prevented All-American Cindy Tom
from competing.
"Cal's not the same team they were last
year," Greenwood said. "They're getting a lot
of injuries right now, and we're getting
healthy."
Once again, the Cardinal (1-2 overall, 1-1
Pacific 10 Conference) had problems on the
vault, the event that has kept the team from
posting top-notch team scores to this point. Fri
day's showing was the squad's worst of the
yfear, Vis only t\vd Cardinal gymnasts scored

above a 9.00 against Cal (0-2, 0-2).
"No one's really panicking," Elzie said.
"Three or four people are still learning new
vaults and they're so close. Right now, we have
to substitute lesser vaults for the ones that
aren't ready yet."
Anderson is among the gymnasts learning
new vaults, and her new routine should be
ready for the Cardinal's next meet.
Greenwood was confident that the team's
score will show marked improvement soon.
"We had lots of practice on the vault today

(Sunday), and with Hillary coming in, we'll
pick up one to one-and-a-half points," he said.
An outstanding team score of 48.05 on the
floor exercise made up for the vaulting defi
ciency against Cal. The performance was as
consistent as it was excellent. All six Stanford
athletes scored between 9.35 and 9.75 on the
apparatus.
Stanford and Cal hook up again next week,
and the two squads will be joined by UC-Santa
Barbara this Friday in the Chili's "Red Hot"
Invitational at Maples Pavilion.
