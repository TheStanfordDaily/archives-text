### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
It might only be January, but the Stanford
women's tennis team is already serving
notice to the rest of the Pacific 10 Conference
that it will be the one to beat in 1993.
The Cardinal took some of its top players
to the 1993 Pac-10 Women's Indoor Tennis
Tournament at the University of Washing
ton last weekend, capturing titles in two of
the individual flights and one doubles
flight.
In the first flight, third-seeded Kim Shas
by easily handled top-seeded Alix Creek from
Arizona 6-1, 6-1, while Beth Berris defeated
Amy Chiminello in the second-flight all-
Stanford final, 6-3, 6-3.
The Cardinal team of Shasby and
Chiminello also won the second-flight dou
bles title over Kori Davidson and Kara
Schertzer from Arizona State, 6-4, 6-2.
Shasby reached the finals by posting a
tough 6-7, 6-3, 6-3 win against UCLA's Keri
Phebus in the semifinal, but according to
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan, the
final match was all Shasby.
"She was awesome," Brennan said. "She
was really good, and we're obviously pleased
with that."
Berris and Chiminello met in the second
flight singles final, the only final of the tour
nament involving two players from the same
team.
Berris advanced to the final with a rela
tively easy 6-1, 6-2 win over Arizona's Miko
Hemsi, while Chiminello had a more difficult
time with USC's Courtney Rose, winning 6-
4, 6-4.
Chiminello and Shasby, the top seeds in
the second doubles flight, rolled into the
final, losing only one game in the process.
Their win gave Stanford its third title of the
six-flight tournament, more than any other
team participating.
In other singles action, Stanford's Wendy
Sacks lost to top-seeded Melissa Hernando
from USC in the first round of the third sin
gles flight, 6-3, 7-6; Emma Woodhouse fell to
California's Veena Prabhakar in the quarter
finals of that flight, 2-6, 6-4, 7-6; and Kris
tine Kurth lost her second-round match to
California's Pam Nelson, 6-4, 7-5.
Stanford's doubles team of Sacks and
Woodhouse dropped a second-round match to
California's Valerie Poulos and Lisa Parks,
7-6, 6-2, while Kurth and Berris lost in the
O" erfinals of the first flight to Arizona's
and Michelle Oldham, 6-2, 6-3.
Stanford hopes to take last weekend's
momentum into this Saturday's conference
opener, when the Cardinal hosts the Wash
ington Huskies at Stanford Tennis Stadium
at 1:30 p.m.
