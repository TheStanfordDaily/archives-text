Unexpected injuries hampered
the Cardinal men's gymnastics
team Friday as they fell to Cali
fornia 273.05-269.80. In the first
ever coed meet held at Berkeley,
the defending national champi
ons slipped behind after the first
rotation and were unable to make
up the point difference as the
meet progressed.
While the Cardinal was unable
to pull together for the team com
petition, however, Stanford gym
nasts came out on top in four of
the six events. Senior Jair Lynch
captured first place in the all
around competition with 55.10,
trailed closely by Cal's Marc Fein
gold with 54.95 and James Guay
with 54.80.
Lynch's 9.55 on the floor and
meet high of 9.90 on the parallel
bars secured him two first places.
Senior Jeff Bender's pommel
horse routine scored a winning
9.70 and sophomore Jing-Wei
Liang's 9.65 on the rings also
earned him a first place.
"I had to scratch two guys
today, which really hurt us, espe
cially on the vault and the floor,"
coach Sadao Hamada said. "We
simply came up short on the scor
ing and lost."
Two of the team's top per
formers, junior co-captain Mark
Booth and junior Jason Cohen,
were both missing from the Stan
ford lineup. Cohen came down
with the flu right before the meet,
while Booth pulled a calf muscle
during warmups.
"I saw some very good indica
tors here and there," Hamada
said. He pointed out Liang's per
formance as one of the bright
spots of the meet. "I was happy
he made all of his new tricks on
the pommel horse, the high bar
and the rings."
Hamada cited Lynch's floor
routine, which included two
brand-new skills, as another high
point of the meet. Also impressive
were Bender's performance on
the pommel horse and freshman
Peter Hegi's high bar routine.
"The team didn't do well
under pressure in the last two
events," Lynch said. "We need to
feel more comfortable with our
routines."
Lynch's next competition will

be the Winter Nationals taking
place in Colorado in two weeks. "I
have had to get ready so fast," he
said. "But I'm glad I've got a cou
ple of meets under my belt so
when I go there, I'll feel relaxed."
Cal's winning score was large
ly boosted by junior Guay, whose
9.30 on the vault earned a first

place. Feingold, a senior, also cap
tured an individual first on the
high bar with a 9.55.
"Cal is improving quickly,"
Hamada said. "They have a good,
young team." He is confident,
however, that the next matchup
of these rivals will result in a
Stanford victory. "I don't think
we'll have any problem beating
them next time. Today without
Booth and Cohen we lost, but the
outcome is not really my concern
at all "
A three-week break in the
meet schedule gives Stanford a
chance to finalize routines and
work on new skills they haven't
had the chance to develop yet.
"During the second half of the
season we should be sticking
every landing and eliminating
form breaks," Hamada said. "I
plan for our team score to go up
to 290 in about two months or
so."
With the long-range team goal
of a repeat win at the NCAA
championships, the gymnasts
can't let losses along the way
affect their attitude or perfor
mance. For any Stanford athlete,
however, a defeat at the hands of
Berkeley is a somewhat agonizing
experience.
