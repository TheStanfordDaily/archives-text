# Grace under pressure
## Students compete for performance awards 
### Carly Berwick Staff writer 
Phlegm in Michael York's
throat might have cost him $400.
Competing with a slight cold,
the San Jose State University stu
dent did his best to impress the
judges with a Tchaikovsky aria at
Saturday's Mu Phi Epsilon Schol
arship auditions at Campbell
Recital Hall.
But for York, who aspires to
become a professional opera
singer, an "out of control" voice in
his second piece put the prize
beyond his grasp.
Students from five Bay Area
universities competed in vocal
and instrumental categories to
garner not only money but perfor
mance experience.
Only 24 carefully screened
instrumentalists and vocalists
were scheduled to audition.
"There aren't many competitions
where they say everyone should
keep studying and go on to perfor
mance, but the judges did here,"
said auditions chair Sara Sals
bury.
Stanford pianist Ann March
winska, a graduate student who
came to California from Poland to
study and teach music, won the
instrumental prize. The instru
mental division included pianists,
guitarists and french horn play
ers. The vocal prize was awarded
to Victoria Kelp of San Francisco
State University.
The musicians had varying
reactions to the competitive
atmosphere. Many of the vocal
ists, who began their auditions
early in the morning, said they
were forced to strain their vocal
chords before they had warmed
up.
"The only thing that was hard

was singing at 9 a.m.," said con
testant Juliene Malecot from San
Francisco State University.
And as guitarist Andrew Hull
from the San Francisco Conserva
tory played a Bach gavotte, the
judges interrupted him to request
the next movement.
"It really bothered me. I was
into it and they pulled me out,"
Hull said. Marchwinska com
mented that she had been dis
turbed by merely anticipating the
interruptions as she played.
Despite such annoyances, the
participants did not sense undue
pressure from other competitors.
Many have attended school togeth
er or know each other from previ
ous competitions. "You're compet
ing against yourself," York said.
For many of the musicians,
competitions like these are a way
to perfect their performance
skills. "Competition is one of the
most helpful tools in terms of per
formance ability," said pianist
Jeaneah Paik.
Paik, a sophomore, was the
only other Stanford student to
audition. She expressed her disap
pointment that more Stanford
students had not participated.
Judge Paul Rosas told the
instrumentalists who didn't win:
"Even though you don't have
money, you have the reward of
working through the material and
it grows. And the whole point of
music is to let it grow and live
within you."
Though money remains a
principal concern for the aspiring
performers, most of the competi
tors said they hope they will be
able to support themselves off
their art.
Hull said he already makes
$200-300 a week playing guitar
part-time. Hull was fortunate

enough to make the call-back for
instrumentalists, giving him a
chance to perform his Bach piece
without interruption.

"I try to bring the emotional
part of music across," he said,
"because anyone can do the tech
nical thing."
