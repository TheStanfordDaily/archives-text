Salamanders caused more
problems than muddy freshmen
at the seventh annual Kappa
Alpha Mud Volleyball Tourna
ment on Saturday
The unusual amount of rain
over the last two weeks led to
interesting play, but a messy
problem: According to sophomore
Josh Richaw, the fraternity was
notified that the recent rain had
caused the return of the tiger
salamanders. A group organized
to protect the salamanders was
concerned that volleyballers
would wreck the animals' habitat.
In order to ensure the little
critters' home wasn't destroyed,
the fraternity had to do some
extra work. "We did all the work
by hand preparing the field to
avoid damage," said Richaw.
Even so, he believes KA may have
to find a new site for the event
next year.
Despite all the added effort,
fraternity members remained
enthusiastic about the event."It
may seem like something that's
thrown together, but it's a lot of
work," said sophomore Marshall
Brickeen. He said the group had
worked most of the quarter to
organize the event.
"It's a lot of work and a lot of

time, but it's also a lot of fun and
goes for a good cause," added
Mike Widlansky as he communi
cated by walkie-talkie to the field
below and charted the progress of
the teams on a board.
And when the mud finally
dried, the champion was Safe Sex,
defeating Shank in the mud 15-
10.

"The best part is taking a
shower and a hot tub afterward,"
said graduate student Joan Bet
zer, caked in mud after her team's
defeat.
More than 70 teams participat
ed in the games. The fraternity
raised approximately $11,000 for
the Muscular Dystrophy Associa
tion.
