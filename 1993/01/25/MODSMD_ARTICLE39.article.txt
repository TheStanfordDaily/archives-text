# Alternate route to law fields: clerking in Fed courts
## 
### Jack Chu 
Most people who graduate from law
school go directly into the field, either in a
law firm or in the corporate world. But a
few have decided to take an alternate path,
becoming clerks in the federal court system.
There, they examine first-hand some of
the major issues of the day and become
close confidantes of top judges.
Miles Ehrlich, one of 40 graduates of the
Stanford Law School's Class of 1992 serv
ing in judicial clerkships this year, said his
input on cases ranges from "substantial to
tremendous."
Ehrlich works between 50 and 55 hours a
week, a figure he calls "very reasonable." He
gets along very well with the judge, William
A. Norris of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Los
Angeles, saying they have lunch every day
and talk about art and politics.
He said he chose to apply for the clerk
ship with Norris because he had heard
through the grapevine that he "was one of
the smartest, effective judges with whom I
shared a judicial philosophy, as well as an
excellent teacher."
Second-year law students at Stanford
Law School are currently in the midst of

applying for clerkships to begin in August or
September of 1994. The process is hectic but
rewarding, said Maya Harris, a 1992 gradu
ate who now works for Judge W. James
Ware of the U.S. District Court in San Jose.
"It was a nightmare, having gone into
the process blindly," Harris said, adding
that she felt a similar uncertainty in apply
ing to college.
According to Hank Greely, a Stanford
law professor and former chair of the clerk
ship committee which gives assistance to
students applying for clerkships, judges
will receive from 20 to as many as 600
applications for clerkships a year for only a
handful of positions.
The judges will choose to interview a
select group of applicants based on a tran
script, resume and writing sample, then
make formal offers of clerkship.
"The process stretches out to about a
year and a half," Greely said. "Current sec
ond-year law students are applying for
clerkships to begin in August or September
of 1994."
Greely added that the judge's decision is
very personal because they work in small
offices and are fairly secluded from the pub
lic, so clerks are not only assistants but also

very important parts of the judges' lives —
sometimes they will be as close as family.
Judges might base their decision to
accept a clerk on the unique interests of the
applicant. For example, judges who are
sports fans might favor those interested in
sports law; others might choose applicants
with an interest in civil rights or even taxes.
Stanford Law School tends to do very
well in terms of percentage of graduates
appointed to clerkships. Though he does
not have exact figures, Greely said he is
confident that Stanford does just as well, if
not better, than all the other law schools
with the possible exception of Yale.
The clerkships are usually one-year terms
though a few do last up to two years. The job
serves as a "training period" for future work
with law firms or public interest groups.
Ehrlich said his job usually involves
looking at briefs presented by both sides of
a case. Then, after hearing oral arguments,
the clerks will help the judge develop a posi
tion and come to a decision.
Most of the work in an appellate court is
done on paper, and deals with legal ques
tions as to what the interpretation of the
law should be, Ehrlich said.
An interesting case Ehrlich encountered

recently is a libel suit involving a father
and son. The son is trying to force the
father to turn over his notes for a book to
be published about their relationship. The
dispute involves First Amendment rights
of free speech, a person's right to confiden
tiality, as well as due process.
Just a week ago Ehrlich received word
that he would have a clerkship next year
with Supreme Court Justice Anthony
Kennedy. Ehrlich said he hopes to become
a courtroom lawyer after his clerkships,
perhaps in a position at the public defend
er's office in Washington, D.C.
Coincidentally, Justice Kennedy's son
Gregory is also a 1992 Stanford law gradu
ate who received a clerkship. He works for
Judge Alex Kozinski at the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Pasadena.
Kennedy said a judge helps a clerk devel
op legal skills in terms of being able to ana
lyze briefs and other writings. He chose his
judge because he had a reputation of being
a demanding and detail-oriented teacher.
Kennedy will go on to work for a law firm
after his clerkship ends.
Harris said she chose her judge because
her professors at the law school knew him
well and recommended him highly.

Just a week ago Ehrlich received word
that he would have a clerkship next year
with Supreme Court Justice Anthony
Kennedy. Ehrlich said he hopes to become
a courtroom lawyer after his clerkships,
perhaps in a position at the public defend
er's office in Washington, D.C.
Coincidentally, Justice Kennedy's son
Gregory is also a 1992 Stanford law gradu
ate who received a clerkship. He works for
Judge Alex Kozinski at the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Pasadena.
Kennedy said a judge helps a clerk devel
op legal skills in terms of being able to ana
lyze briefs and other writings. He chose his
judge because he had a reputation of being
a demanding and detail-oriented teacher.
Kennedy will go on to work for a law firm
after his clerkship ends.
Harris said she chose her judge because
her professors at the law school knew him
well and recommended him highly.
