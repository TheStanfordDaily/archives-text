Minnesota Vikings' star Roger Craig, formerly of the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles
Raiders, shakes hands with fans at yesterday's East-West Shrine Game at Stanford Stadium. The
East All-Stars, led by offensive MVP Chuckle Dukes of Boston College and two rushing touch
downs by Virginia's Terry Klrby, prevailed over the West All-Stars 31-17 before a record 84,000
fans. The 68th annual Installment of the contest, which benefits Shriners Hospitals throughout
Norlh America, also marked the final home appearance of Cardinal seniors Chris Dalman, Ron
George and Glyn Milburn. See story, page 8.
