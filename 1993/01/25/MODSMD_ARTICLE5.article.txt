# Katchadourian offers straight talk about sex

Some people have a hard time
talking to their kids about sex.
Some people have a hard time
talking about sex at all.
Then there are those like Prof.
Herant Katchadourian, who can
talk about things like transsexual
ism, homosexuality, and auto
eroticism to a classroom of a thou
sand students.
"Obviously, the subject matter
is interesting. And I suspect there
is a kind of 'bandwagon' effect, as
some students might take the
class because so many others have
taken it," said Katchadourian,
who has taught "Human Sexuali
ty" for 25 years.
It's the wit and engaging teach
ing style of Katchadourian him-

self, however,
that are the real
magnets attract
ing students to
the course.
"People think
I'm a good lectur
er," said Katcha
dourian, who
tries to use humor
to make students

feel at ease with uncomfortable and
often controversial subjects such as
pornography and abortion. "Some
times in these lectures you can just
cut the tension with a knife."
In a potentially embarrassing
lecture on sexual stimulation,
Katchadourian quips, "Some
times people think there is a sort

of a map of the body people can
get their hands so they would
know how to please their partner.
They think they can go from point
A to point B," he says, pausing
before announcing sardonically,
"Sorry, there is no such map,"
causing an undercurrent of
laughter to sweep through the
classroom.
For Katchadourian, being a
teacher means being a filter and
catalyst. "The text I wrote for the
course, 'Fundamentals of Human
Sexuality,' is a vehicle to get infor
mation," said Katchadourian, who
has been selected as "outstanding
professor" and Class Day speaker

by Stanford seniors six times.
Although Katchadourian has
come to be known as the a kind of
Dr. Ruth meets Academia, he
describes his entrance into the
field of human sexuality as a
"pure accident." As a young assis
tant professor of psychiatry, he
served on a committee which
examined problems of student
health, especially those involving
sexually transmitted diseases and
pregnancy. "I asked why there
was no course addressing these
issues. The committee said, 'What
a good idea. . .Why don't you
teach it?' "
Katchadourian then ham
mered a course together and 70
students showed up. By the
fourth year, there were over 1,000
students, and enrollment stayed
at that level for almost 10 years.

Over 15,000 students have taken
the course.
While Katchadourian explains
that changing sexual attitudes are
difficult to observe in a class of
such enormous size with no dis
cussion sections, he does observe
changes that have occurred
decade by decade.
Although he introduced Hum-
Sex in 1968, it wasn't until the
'70s, during the tail end of the sex
ual revolution, that his class began
to attract large numbers of stu
dents. At one point, 1,200 students
jammed themselves into Memorial
Auditorium for the course.
In reflecting on his experience
at Stanford, Katchadourian says,
"I have done a lot of things in my
life, but primarily I think of
myself as a teacher. I would teach
if they didn't pay me!"
