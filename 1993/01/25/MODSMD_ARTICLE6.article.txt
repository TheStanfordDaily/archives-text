# Panel urges action on Native American issues
## 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
While women and many minor
ity groups have battled a "glass
ceiling" in trying to achieve eco
nomic opportunities and social
equality, speakers at a Saturday
night conference agreed that Na
tive Americans are still in the cel
lar, with only a few rays of light
seeping through the cracks.
Encouraged by President Clin
ton's appointment of Bruce Bab
bit as the Secretary of the Interior,

the panelists for "Contemporary
Issues in American-Indian Policy
Making" hoped issues such as
water and land rights, the envi
ronment and Native American ed
ucation would be addressed over
the next four years.
"We have an opportunity with
this administration, in effect, to
start with a clean state," said Alan
Parker, director of the National
Indian Policy Center. "We feel we
have the best opportunity we've
ever had to establish a relation
ship that reflects equality."
Specifically, Parker would like to
see the Bureau of Indian Affairs
(the administrative body that
oversees tribal governments and
works with other government
agencies) staffed primarily, if not
entirely, by Native Americans.
"We're going from a relation
ship where those laws were made
by lawmakers in Washington, to a
relationship in which the elected
leadership of the tribes partici
pate in the making of the laws
and policies."
Commenting on the election of
President Bill Clinton and his
appointment of former Arizona
Governor Bruce Babbit as the Sec
retary of the Interior, Parker gave
an approving endorsement. "We
feel we have the best opportunity
we've ever had to establish a rela
tionship that reflects equality."
In addition to governmental
action, personal involvement was
another message of the panelists.
"What I'm saying to you is: Try
to identify issues," said Byron
Mallott, former CEO of Seaalaska,
a large, Alaskan Native American
owned corporation that supports
its shareholders through educa
tional and cultural programming.
"What are the public policy issues
that need to be addressed?"
According to Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization co-chair
Myra Parker, one of the panel's
goals was to raise professors'
awareness of Native American
policy issues. "We want the facul
ty more aware of issues affecting
Native Americans and to have
them implement them into the
curricula," agreed senior Isabel
Bourelle, Co-Chair of SAIO. But
it appeared that few faculty were
actually in attendance; about 50
people showed up for the panel.
While acknowledging that the
pressure placed on young Native
American adults is great, Mallott
said that "as students, ultimate
ly, it is just you, and how you as
an individual move ahead is the
critical thing."
The former Chairman of the
Colorado River Tribes, Franklin
McCabe, agreed. "Unless you
really take it upon yourself,
whether you help in a direct way,
unless you do those things, then
you are as effective as a buffalo
fart in a snow blizzard, and you'll
have no effect," he said.
Junior Sheila McCabe said she
came to the event because "as a
student, as Navajo-Sioux, those
things are happening to my peo
ple. These are subjects you don't
learn in the classroom, so we have
to bring in people like this."
This April, SAIO will sponsor
another presentation focusing on
the future of Native Americans in
education.
