Our three year Master of Science Program offers a systematic, well
integrated curriculum grounded in the original theory of Traditional Chinese
Medicine.
The emphasis we place on excellence is more than philosophical. Our
commitment is to educate students in Acupuncture, Moxibustion, Oriental
Herbal Prescription and Western Clinical Sciences, in order for them to
become Primary Care Practitioners who will serve the public with skill and
dedication.
Our next class begins in September, 1993 and could be your pathway to a
new profession.
