# 'One more straw on the camel's back'
## Lesbian naval officer, student comes out to fight military ban 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
As the nation focuses on President
Clinton's campaign promise to lift the
ban on homosexuals in the military,
Stanford student Zoe Dunning is watch
ing more closely than most.
Dunning, a Stanford Business School
student, announced at a rally at Moffett
Field on Jan. 16 that she is a lesbian — a
lesbian who graduated from the U.S.
Naval Academy, served six years on active
duty and is now a Navy reserve officer.
In her speech to supporters and the
press, Dunning said, "I am both a naval
officer and a lesbian, and I refuse to live
that lie anymore. I will no longer sacrifice
my dignity and integrity and live in fear. .
. . All we ask for is the dignity to serve our
country with pride and without shame."
As Clinton meets with the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and Defense Department

officials about lifting the 50-year ban on
homosexuals in the military, Dunning
faces discharge for homosexuality.
"Bill, if you're listening out there
please do it as soon as possible because
my naval career rides on it," Dunning
pleaded.
Dunning's decision to come out was
motivated in part by Clinton's inaugura
tion.
"We're really at a crucial point right
now with the Clinton Administration tak
ing office," Dunning said in an interview.
"The rally that I came out at was four days
before the Inauguration. I hoped that it
would get national media (attention) so
that it would be just one more straw on
the camel's back," she said.
The support of other students also
played a part in her decision.
Dunning, who went from active duty
directly into the Business School, said,
"As I got more used to the campus envi

ronment, I started coming out to more
and more people."
Last spring, she and several other stu
dents formally came out in a memo spon
sored by the Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual
Business School Community, sent to
every student and faculty member.
"It was amazing how much support I
got," she said. "All of the horrible things I'd
thought might happen didn't happen. The
more I came out to people the freer I felt.
The last step in that process was coming
out to the Navy ... it's a matter of person
al integrity — not living a lie anymore."
Dunning said she feels she is in a
strong position to take a stand against
the ban.
"I have less to lose, probably, than
most. I have a job lined up after gradua
tion, I'm out to ail my friends and family,
and I thought that I could serve as a good

1 am both a naval
officer and a lesbian,
and I refuse to live
that lie anymore. I will
no longer sacrifice
my dignity and
integrity and live in
fear... .All we ask for
is the dignity to serve
our country with
pride and without
shame.'

role model for both civilians and
military to prove that we're not
something to be afraid of," she said.
"We are very successful and
we've been serving along side you
all along. And lifting the ban isn't
going to change the basic struc
ture of the military or be any kind
of a threat," she added.
Dunning, scheduled to gradu
ate in June, is no stranger to
hardship and discrimination.
"The first class of women
entered the Naval Academy in
1980; I entered in 1981, so we
were still sort of a novelty. Men
outnumbered women 13 to one.
There was definitely an undercur
rent of people not wanting them
(women) there. The guys took
every opportunity they could to
remind you that you shouldn't be
there," she remembered.
Homosexuality at the academy
was "closeted. ... I found out
years later about some people
who were gays and lesbians.
Many of them were kicked out,
quality students kicked out just
for that reason."
Nor were her years as an
active-duty officer ever easy.
She points to the prevailing atti
tude among many servicemen that
"women would only join the Navy
to find a husband or if they were a
lesbian. You're either a dyke or a
slut in most guys minds ... if you
don't sleep with them then they
assume that you're the other."
Dunning said many of her fel
low officers went out of their way
to harass and degrade her.
"I was on board a ship. There
was one particular table where
some friends and I would always
sit and there was this Louisiana
Bull Sauce, one of the condiments
that were always on the table, and
someone had gone and written
'bull dyke' on the condiment
sauce at the table where we
always sat," she recalled.
In another incident, "there was
a booklet that had photographs
and names of all the officers on the
ship," she said. "It was there when
you came on and off the ship, and
the duty officer had it available.
"And by people that they sus
pected were gay and lesbian they
had written 'dyke. . . bull dyke,'
and of course lots of people had
seen this by the time I got around

to it.. . subtle things like that."
Nonetheless, her fellow service
members' reactions to her coming
out have not all been negative.
"I had some people that came
directly to me and were very sup
portive, and some who discussed
the topic with me in a very neu
tral detached manner. There were
others that avoided me altogether
. . . (and) some that expressed
that although they didn't disagree
with the fact that I came out or
that I was homosexual, they dis
agreed with the fact that I did it in
a public forum," she said.
Dunning pointed out that the
Navy has a particularly high
homosexuality discharge rate
compared to the other services.
And, while women make up only
10 percent of the Navy, they
account for 25 percent of dis
charges for homosexuality.
The Navy is currently process
ing Dunning for discharge. Until
Clinton formally overturns the
ban, Navy officials say "that they
are obligated to process me for
discharge," she said.
"I'm very heartened by the fact
that [Clinton has] taken action
right away," Dunning said. "Most
of the media before the inaugura
tion were quoting the Defense
Department and the Joint Chiefs
of Staff — the military establish
ment — when they were saying he
was going to study it and have
commissions.
"Whenever you listened to the
Clinton administration, they
never changed from their path of
fulfilling that pledge, so I was rid
ing my hopes on the fact that the
Clinton Administration would
fulfill their promise."
For President Clinton, howev
er, the process may not be easy or
quick. Many arguments against
lifting the ban have been raised by
military leaders since Clinton
took office — concerns that Dun
ning isn't buying.
Troops questioning the orders
of gay or lesbian officers is one
concern often raised.
Dunning countered by saying,
"Those who can't follow orders
should be processed for their con
duct and should be dealt with as
such."
She pointed to the similar con
troversies surrounding the offi
cial inductions of women and peo
ple of color into the military, say
ing, "Why should we be punished
because you can't deal with us?"
As for the concern among mili

tary leaders that new facilities and
educational programs will overtax
already stretched military budgets,
Dunning simply replied, "I don't
think money should be an excuse
for the restriction of civil rights."
Dunning said she found it ironic
that officials have cited the
increased risk of AIDS as a reason
to keep gays out of the military. "If
that's the basis you're going to use
then the entire military force
should be lesbian," she said, noting
many servicemen's practice of fre
quenting prostitutes while abroad.
She said she feels that counter
ing such arguments is just the
beginning of Clinton's work in
lifting the ban.
"It has to come from an execu
tive order from the President to
send a strong message," rather
than an indirect action through
the Defense Secretary. "I think
the military's got to stand at
attention, salute and say, 'We'll
carry it out' and mean it," said
Dunning.
Even if gays and lesbians are
officially allowed into the mili
tary, Dunning still sees a hard
road ahead.
Although gays can serve in the
military in 13 of the 16 NATO
countries, Dunning says they are
still harassed and are often placed
in dead-end career paths.
"Even when the ban is lifted, I
don't see a lot of people coming
out. There's too much at risk,"
she said.
With all the prejudice and hos
tility in the military, it is easy to
wonder why Dunning still wants
to be a Naval Officer.
"The reason I entered to begin
with was that my mother was a
first lieutenant in the Women's
Army Corps during World War 11.
She quit college at Northwestern
University at 19, lied about her
age and served two years. When I
was growing up, she told me these
really great stories about what it
was like," remembers Dunning.
If her mother's memories moti
vated her to join, it is her own
experiences that have kept her in.
"There's a real camaraderie, a
sense of pride, a sense of service
to your country— all these corny
terms but it really holds true,"
said Dunning.
"I feel very privileged to be an
American citizen. . . . You've got to
put something back into the coun
try for what we've received from it
and my way of putting back into it
was to serve in the military."
