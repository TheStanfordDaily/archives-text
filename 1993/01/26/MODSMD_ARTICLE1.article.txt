# 'One more straw on the camel's back'
## Lesbian naval officer, student comes out to fight military ban 
### Colleen Krueger Staff writer 
As the nation focuses on President
Clinton's campaign promise to lift the
ban on homosexuals in the military,
Stanford student Zoe Dunning is watch
ing more closely than most.
Dunning, a Stanford Business School
student, announced at a rally at Moffett
Field on Jan. 16 that she is a lesbian — a
lesbian who graduated from the U.S.
Naval Academy, served six years on active
duty and is now a Navy reserve officer.
In her speech to supporters and the
press, Dunning said, "I am both a naval
officer and a lesbian, and I refuse to live
that lie anymore. I will no longer sacrifice
my dignity and integrity and live in fear. .
. . All we ask for is the dignity to serve our
country with pride and without shame."
As Clinton meets with the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and Defense Department

officials about lifting the 50-year ban on
homosexuals in the military, Dunning
faces discharge for homosexuality.
"Bill, if you're listening out there
please do it as soon as possible because
my naval career rides on it," Dunning
pleaded.
Dunning's decision to come out was
motivated in part by Clinton's inaugura
tion.
"We're really at a crucial point right
now with the Clinton Administration tak
ing office," Dunning said in an interview.
"The rally that I came out at was four days
before the Inauguration. I hoped that it
would get national media (attention) so
that it would be just one more straw on
the camel's back," she said.
The support of other students also
played a part in her decision.
Dunning, who went from active duty
directly into the Business School, said,
"As I got more used to the campus envi

ronment, I started coming out to more
and more people."
Last spring, she and several other stu
dents formally came out in a memo spon
sored by the Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual
Business School Community, sent to
every student and faculty member.
"It was amazing how much support I
got," she said. "All of the horrible things I'd
thought might happen didn't happen. The
more I came out to people the freer I felt.
The last step in that process was coming
out to the Navy ... it's a matter of person
al integrity — not living a lie anymore."
Dunning said she feels she is in a
strong position to take a stand against
the ban.
"I have less to lose, probably, than
most. I have a job lined up after gradua
tion, I'm out to ail my friends and family,
and I thought that I could serve as a good

1 am both a naval
officer and a lesbian,
and I refuse to live
that lie anymore. I will
no longer sacrifice
my dignity and
integrity and live in
fear... .All we ask for
is the dignity to serve
our country with
pride and without
shame.'
