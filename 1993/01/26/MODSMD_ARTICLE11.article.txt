Two killed near CIA offices
MCLEAN, Va. (AP) — A young man sprayed
rifle fire into cars waiting to turn into Central
Intelligence Agency headquarters yesterday,
killing two men at point-black range and wound
ing three others before fleeing the morning rush
hour scene in his own vehicle, authorities said.
The man, described as a white male in his
20s, remained at large late yesterday.
Police would not speculate on a motive for the
shooting, although they cited a "common sense
connection" to the CIA headquarters, a sprawl
ing, wooded complex surrounded by wealthy res
idential neighborhoods a few miles west of
Washington, D.C.
Sears cuts traditional catalog
CHICAGO (AP) — Sears, Roebuck and Co.
said yesterday it will cut about 50,000 full- and
part-time jobs, close 113 stores and shut down
its "big book" catalog in its most drastic move
yet to revitalize its retailing business.
Sears also said it would discontinue some of its
auto-repair services and sell a chain of women's
apparel stores. Eliminating the catalog also
means closing some 2,000 Sears catalog stores,
most owned by independent retailers.
The cuts are the deepest Sears has made in
the four years since the company began over
hauling its merchandising group to combat
declining sales and market share. Sears estimat
ed the moves would save it $300 million a year.
Investors were pleased: Sears gained almost
$2 to close at $50.75 a share yesterday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
Sears produced its first general merchandise
catalog, which came to be known as the "big
book," in 1896. But while the catalog operation
has been unprofitable for years, Sears has
balked at shutting it down.
