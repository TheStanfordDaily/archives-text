# Hillary Clinton to head health-care task force

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton put his wife, Hillary, in charge
yesterday of a task force that will ham
mer out his blueprint for a major over
haul of America's health care system.
Clinton called his wife, until recent
ly a corporate lawyer, "a first lady of
many talents" with a unique gift for
cutting through complex issues and
forging consensus.
It is the first time any president has
ever assigned his wife to formulate
major domestic policy.
Tackling the troubles in the U.S.
health care system — which costs more
than any in the world but leaves tens of
millions of Americans without health
insurance — was one of Clinton's

bedrock promises in the 1992 campaign.
The president said he was grateful
that Hillary would "be sharing some
of the heat I expect to generate."
"I want it done — now," he said at
the close of an hour-long meeting with
Mrs. Clinton, a half-dozen Cabinet
secretaries, his OMB director and
other senior White House aids on the
President's Task Force on National
Health Care Reform.
He noted that she chaired an
Arkansas Education Standards Com
mittee that played a leading role in
pushing through school reforms there
a decade ago while he was governor,
and also had chaired a state panel on
rural health problems.

Clinton said the task force would
work from a "war room" in the Old
Executive Office Building in a crash
effort to meet his goal of sending his
health reform legislation to Capitol
Hill in his first 100 days.
Although May 1 is day 100, the
White House said the task force was
expected to finish its work by the end
of May.
"We are going to work constantly
day and night until we have a health
care plan ready to submit to the
Congress that we believe we can
pass," said the president.
"We've talked about it long enough.
The time has come to act," said Clin
ton, who wants to control skyrocket

ing costs and close the gaping holes in
the health safety net.
Some 35 million Americans — most
from working families — now have no
health insurance and 20 million more
are inadequately insured.
Clinton made the announcement at
the end of an hour-long meeting with
his health advisers. He spoke at a
lectern in the Roosevelt Room, while
Mrs. Clinton sat a few feet away at the
end of table with Cabinet officers and
other senior aides. She did not speak
while reporters were present.
She will draw no salary.
"I never have paid her for her pub
lic service," the president said with a
smile. "I don't want to start now."
