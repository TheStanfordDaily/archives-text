MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) - The
United States and its allies plunged deeper
into Somalia's civil war yesterday, blasting
members of a clan militia with rocket and
cannon fire as they advanced on the south
ern port city of Kismayu.
No American casualties were reported in
the helicopter gunship assault about 25
miles west of Kismayu, the first U.S. inter
vention in a conflict between Somali forces.
Officials said the assault had been
requested by Gen. Mohamed Farrah Aidid,
a major warlord, and was aimed at enforc
ing an 11-day cease-fire so peace talks
between 14 warring factions can resume
next Monday. The talks were halted Friday
because of the fighting in southern and
central Somalia.
U.S. Marine Col. Fred Peck, a spokesman
for the coalition, said he had no estimate of

Somali casualties by gunships firing rockets
and 20mm cannon at the forces of Gen.
Mohamed Said Hirsi, known as Gen. Morgan.
About 40 injured people were admitted
to hospitals in Kismayu yesterday, said
Nina Winquist, a Red Cross spokeswoman,
but it was not clear if their injuries were a
result of the U.S.-led attack or other vio
lence in the city.
U.S. officials said Morgan had broken a
Jan. 15 cease-fire by attacking forces of
Col. Omar Jess, an ally of Aidid.
Whether the American response pre
saged a further pattern of intervention in
clan battles by U.S.-led forces wasn't known.
No U.S. ground forces were involved,
but as many as 200 Belgian troops joined
the attack. Peck said one U.S. helicopter
from the 10th Mountain Division sus
tained light damage from small-arms fire.
