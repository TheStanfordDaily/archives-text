ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) — An attempted
cease-fire disintegrated yesterday as two
French peacekeepers were killed and three
wounded at a U.N. control post in southern
Croatia.
The U.N. peacekeepers were killed at Karin
Plaza near a key bridge that has been the
object of intense fighting between ethnic Serb
rebels and majority Croats of this former
Yugoslav republic, said Shannon Boyd, U.N.
spokeswoman in Zagreb.
The identity of the gunmen who fired on
the peacekeepers was not immediately known,
but the fighting and tough rhetoric by-leaders
on all sides has raised concern that clashes in
Croatia could spark a broader Balkan war
involving Serbs, Croats and Muslims.
Fighting continues in neighboring Bosnia-
Herzegovina between the three groups.
Croatian army commander Gen. Janko
Bobetko told reporters in the port of Zadar
that his forces had secured control of both
ends of the Maslenica bridge, a key road link
destroyed in Croatia's six-month war in

1991.
Croatian fighters also seized Zemunik. a
strategic military airfield 12 miles inland from
Zadar.
Serbian military sources confirmed the
Croatian claims, the Belgrade-based Tanjug
news agency said.
But fighting raged on for the nearby vil
lages of Smilcic, Drace and Biljane, which
Boyd described as a "battle zone" between
minority Serbs and Croats.
According to the French Defense Ministry,
the peacekeepers were killed by heavy arms
fire at the j)9st that jrgirfcs a Serb-Croat front
line. JL * A k. JlviUl
The deaths brought the total number of
U.N. peacekeepers killed in former Yugoslavia
to 26.
A Yugoslav government statement said 500
Serb civilians and 150 Serb policemen had
died in renewed fighting in Croatia. On Sun
day, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said
120 Serb and 10 Croat fighters had been
killed.

Tanjug reported 5,000 refugees had fled the
area.
The Croatian offensive began Friday, as
U.N. mediators Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen
prepared for the latest round of peace talks in
Geneva that seek political settlements for
Croatia and war-wracked Bosnia, another for
mer Yugoslav republic.
Croatia's war, which left 10,000 dead,
ended Jan. 3, 1992, with a truce that brought
in U.N. peacekeepers to demilitarize and con
trol the occupied territories pending a political
settlement.
-But Serbian forces have remained in con
trol of the Zadar hinterland and Knin — the
center of Croatian Serbs' rebellion. Eastern
Slavonia and Baranja, fertile regions border
ing Serbia, also have remained effectively
under Serb command.
Tudjman has been under increasing domes
tic pressure to regain the one-third of Croatia
lost to Serbs in the 1991 war. His Croatian
Democratic Union party also faces elections
for Parliament's lower house in coming weeks.
