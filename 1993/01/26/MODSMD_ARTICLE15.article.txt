# Taxes, cuts needed to slow down deficit
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Congress' top budget analyst
says federal deficits will more
than double in a decade unless
the public accepts higher taxes
and trimmer programs.
Unchecked, the shortfall
will hit about $650 billion in
fiscal 2003 — compared to last
year's record $290 billion,
according to testimony pre
pared by Director Robert Reis
chauer of the nonpartisan Con
gressional Budget Office.
In his prepared remarks, for
delivery to the Senate Budget
Committee today, Reischauer
projected deficits for the next
few years that are roughly sim
ilar to the gloomy estimates
that outgoing President Bush
released three weeks ago.
In a blow to President Clin
ton, Reischauer warns that nei
ther economic growth nor
reform of the health-care system
will solve the government's red
ink problem. Clinton has said he
would rely heavily on both to
help reduce the budget gap.
"The deficit will come down
only when both elected officials
and the public conclude that
the borrowing binge must
stop," Reischauer said. "They
must be willing to pay higher
taxes and receive fewer govern
ment benefits in the 1990s for
the sake of higher living stan
dards in the next century."
Reischauer's views are
important because the Con
gressional Budget Office is

widely respected on Capitol
Hill as an impartial source of
budget information.
Reischauer projects that the
fiscal 1993 budget gap will be
$310 billion, $17 billion less
than Bush estimated. Fiscal
1993 runs through Sept. 30.
But after dipping to $291
billion next year, Reischauer
sees the deficit rising steadily
afterward, hitting $319 billion
in fiscal 1997 — $14 billion
more than Bush projected. The
fiscal 1997 budget is the spend
ing plan Clinton will be prepar
ing during his 1996 re-election
campaign.
When Bush released his lat
est deficit projections on Jan. 6,
Democrats said the figures were
tainted because they relied on
unre. assumptions to hold
the budget shortfall down.
For example, Bush assumed
that spending on many domes
tic programs would be frozen
after 1995, not even being
increased for inflation — an
assumption that few in Wash
ington believe is valid.
The Congressional Budget
Office assumed those programs
would grow at the rate of infla
tion, which explains most of
the difference between its esti
mates and Bush's.
Reischauer attributed most of
the growth in future deficits to
the rapidly expanding Medicare
and Medicaid programs, which
provide health care for the elder
ly, handicapped and poor.
