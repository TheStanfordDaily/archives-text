Clinton should follow
through with promise
despite military flack

IT SAYS SOMETHING about
the resiliency of prejudice that
our nation's military leaders
are willing to devote so much time
and energy to trampling the civil
rights of gay and bisexual Ameri
cans.
Since President Clinton
announced that he would issue an
executive order to rescind the offi
cial military policy of discrimina
tion against gays, high-ranking
military officials have launched a
full-frontal offensive of private
meetings, press leaks and public
pronouncements to derail the cam
paign promise.
Clinton has delayed the order in
an effort to build support for the
policy change and not waste valu
able political capital. But eventual
ly, Clinton must take a stand and
endorse the right of all Americans
— not just heterosexuals — to
serve in the military. That moment
quickly approaches.
The military's stated policy is
that "homosexuality is incompati
ble with military service." Openly
gay recruits are prevented from
joining the military and the mili
tary has license to boot out the
ones it discovers (an exception is
apparently made in times of com
bat, when gay folks are useful fod
der).
As a factual matter, voiding this
policy would directly benefit a rela
tively small number of people —
gay, lesbian and bisexual soldiers.
As a practical matter, other issues
eclipse this one for both the mili
tary and gay Americans.
The military needs to craft an
entirely new role overseas, deal
with budget cuts and cope with the
prevalence of sexual harassment.
Similarly, grander matters face the
gay community, like employment

discrimination in other fields, fam
ily rights and AIDS prevention and
treatment.
Still, symbolism is tremendous
ly important. If Bill Clinton is to be
remembered as the president who
extended full civil rights to gay sol
diers, he may transform the over
whelming support he received
from gays in the 1992 election into
long-lasting support for the Demo
cratic party, in the same way that
the recognition of Israel by Tru
man solidified the support of Jews
for the Democratic party.
Rejecting discrimination does
not require the government to
raise taxes or redistribute income;
in fact it will save the government
money since it will no longer have
to spend millions of dollars perse
cuting and expelling individuals it
had previously recruited, educated
and trained.
The best answer to the current
hysterics of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff is, simply, history. Forty
years ago, President Truman was
besieged by warnings of race riots
and the demoralization of white
troops if blacks were given equal
status in the military.
In that era of legal segregation,
the idea of black and white sol
diers working, washing and sleep
ing in the same quarters was
characterized as repugnant and
unnatural. Yet just a few years
after Truman signed an executive
order desegregating the armed
forces, the armed forces per
formed with no less cohesion or
ability in the Korean War than
they had in previous wars. (One
wonders if Colin Powell, the first
African-American chair of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and an oppo
nent of rescinding the ban, both
ers to trace his own success back
to Truman's farsighted action.)
While President Clinton can
be commended for attempting to
build consensus, the military is
making it clear that it will only
respond to marching orders. As
Commander in Chief, Bill Clin
ton is the one who can issue
them.
