Cheerleaders declared non-toxic by 'scientific 9 study...

AN ASTOUNDING NEW discovery
has been made right here at Stan
ford University. Would you believe
. . . cheerleaders are people too!
A large scale, inter disciplinary study
supported by profits from the sale of sev
eral top football prospects to Oregon
State delivered several stunning results
this weekend. It has been determined,
contrary to the popular belief of some in
this community, that the cheerLeaders
are not "terminators" designed at the
Berkeley labs of the future and sent back
in time to eliminate the Dollies and —
gasp — the Stanford Band.
These people will be relieved to find
that their heroic and vigilant effort to

quell these cheerleaders with verbal and
physical abuse need not continue as they
have been found to be safe and non-toxic.
Cheering at Stanford sporting events
is still strictly optional. Henceforth
cheering will be offered in two distinct
flavors: "with cheerleader" or "without
cheerleader," with volume and tonal
quality being a strictly personal decision.
Students choosing both options will not
be charged extra for their season tickets.
Scientists assure cautious students
that cheering for Stanford under either
option will be safe, fun and free from all
communicable disease as long as a cardi
nal-colored latex condom is used.
However, scientists do warn that the

outright "dissing" of cheerleaders, dol
lies, band members or the athletes them
selves may lead to a severe decline in spir
it causing athletic losses and in the long
term a desire for a marching band that
"you know. . . marches."
Dr. Ludwig von Vienerschnitzel clear
ly stated in his Sunday afternoon press
conference that: "De law ahf de conserv
ing ahf energy shows us dat clearly de
expenditure ahf energies to de harassing
ahf cheerpersons can be redirected to de
cheering fur das Cardinal, resulting in
an additional 4.723459871 times pi vic
dories each season. Derefore, de rivalry
between de cheerleaders und da band ist
a vaste of energy und de Axe should be

buried only in das Oskis."
In an as-yet-unconfirmed result, Dr.
Roof Vestheimer stated: "The overall sex
ual performance of the Stanford student
is directly related to the intensity of his
or her cheering." This result may explain
the increased use of hidden corners in
Green Library this football season.
Given this astounding set of discover
ies, local merchants have stated that they
expect a run on Cardinal merchandise
and ear plugs in preparation for the next
home basketball game. GO CARDINAL!
