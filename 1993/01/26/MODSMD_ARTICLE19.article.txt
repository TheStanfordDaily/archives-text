# ...but others claim they embarrass the school

### 
Three cheers and a hearty thank you
to The Daily editorial staff for finally
raising their voices against the "cheer
leaders." We have suffered long enough
— now it is time to repent and start
anew.
Since they were crammed down our
throats a couple years ago, the cheerlead
ers have been reactionary at best, and
embarrassing at all times. As a regular at
Stanford sports events, I have yet to see
them start a cheer that incites the fans to
join in.
They seem more apt to follow a chant
originating from the Stanford Band or
the fans themselves. For those who have
been around for a few years, may I
painfully remind you of the S-T-A-N-O-
R-D misspelling at the football game, an
embarrassment that punctuates a dismal
cheerleading career of ineffectiveness.
The fact remains that cheerleaders, in
the traditional sense, have no place at
Stanford. Ours is a university unlike any
other, combining superior academics and
athletics with creativity and ingenuity to

set trends and provide leadership.
Before the cheerleaders' dubious
beginning, my classmates and I would
relish the fact that Stanford had none of
these screaming nuisances at sporting
events. We were proud to be unique, with
our beloved, irreverent, non-conformist
band and Dollies, and, yes, with the crazy
Branner cheering section.
Stanford neither needs nor wants to
be told when and what to cheer in that
annoying, uncreative way — we can fig
ure it out for ourselves.
If you are still unconvinced of the
cheerleaders' silliness, I suggest you
watch them closely at the next basketball
game. See if those all-too-familiar split
kicks, pom-pom waves, glazed stares and
mouthed words raise your levels of
excitement and school spirit.
I was beginning to think that Stanford
was losing its grip on originality and
uniqueness, slipping into the mediocrity
of the State school. Now I see some hope,
with others expressing their disgust for
the cheerleaders. As The Daily editorial
recommends, let's give them the Axe.
After that, perhaps we could work on get
ting the Grateful Dead back at Frost. ...
