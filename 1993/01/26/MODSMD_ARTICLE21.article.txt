## Thinking about George 
### 
George bush has been on my
mind a lot this week. Don't get me
wrong — I'm happy Clinton won
the election. I'm thankful he's finally able
to drop the "-elect."
But somewhere amidst all the pomp
and fashion parading of inauguration day,
I found myself wondering how George
was dealing with it all — all the celebra
tion of his being shoved out after only one
term in office.
A one-termer — that's what makes all
the difference. To step aside isn't such a
painful thing when you've successfully
completed the two terms allowed by law.
Then you have the comfort of knowing
that your being out of office isn't a reflec
tion of how little the American people
thought of your performance in the Oval
Office. Bush fought, though, and he lost
to a guy who's a generation younger,
whose middle name is Jefferson and has a
cool wife to boot.
But if we remember that there are peo
ple behind the titles, then having all of
America witness the throwing out of the
old, as well as the swearing in of the new,
seemed a bit cruel to Bush.
There he was on television standing in
front of the White House with Barbara
and Millie. We saw him take a step too
soon, before Bill and Hillaiy and Chelsea
quite made it up the stairs, and how he
had to stand there with his arms out
stretched for an awkwardly long time

before he could get out "Welcome to your
new home."
We were shown the huge moving van
pulling up behind the White House, and
told all the speculation about why Bush
requested a separate holding room for the
Clintons before the inaugural ceremony.
And then he was gone, back to Texas
where he came from — on Air Force One
which had already been renamed Air
Force Mission some-number-or-other.
A lot happened around the world while
George Bush was president, not very
much of which seemed to be his direct
doing. I would say he was more of a reac
tor than an actor. And not even a great
reactor.
How does it feel to leave a job that peo
ple have said you weren't good at? In a
way an "average president" is an oxy
moron; it took a lot of brains and guts to
get there in the first place.
But I can't guess how George Bush
feels. I've only come to know the way
Bush played the role of president, with its
script of gag rules and foreign interven
tions and misreading the lips of a saggy
baggy economy.
Being president demands sacrifices of
individuality for the sake of the position,
and we've already watched Clinton
pulling on the costume — shortening his
natural verbosity to fit speech time slots,
forcing his contemplative self to make
quick cabinet decisions.

But what becomes of the man now that
we no longer want him as "President"? A
person can't remain a symbol — individu
als are too complex to be distilled into a
few qualities and quirks.
Bush may have lost the privilege of the
title when he walked away from Pennsyl
vania Avenue last Wednesday, but he did
regain the privilege of just getting to be
George.
He's going to have to carry the title of
former president around for the rest of
his life — fame and power have taken a
little bit of him for permanent public dis
play. But the burden of that title is con
siderably lighter, maybe even light
enough for George to crawl out from
under its weight and become the full-time
grandfather he says he wants to become.
I'm glad that President George Her
bert Walker Bush is out of the White
House. But as for George, I hope he'll find
time between fishing trips to separate the
claims of mediocrity that will be found in
the history books from the greatness that
might very well be the guy.
