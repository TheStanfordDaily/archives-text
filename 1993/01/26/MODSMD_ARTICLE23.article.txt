## Grapplers gain road split 
### David McAleer 
The Stanford wrestling team took to the road last
weekend, and broke a three-meet losing streak with a
win followed by a loss. On Saturday, the grapplers
pulled out a 19-18 victory over UC-Davis, but on Sun
day they fell to Cal State Bakersfield, 31-10. The
team's dual meet record now stands at three wins
and four losses.
Stanford has suffered from a sparse lineup all sea
son, especially in the upper weight divisions.
"We've been having to juggle athletes to fill the line
up," said head coach Chris Horpel. "We only have two
wrestlers over 158 (pounds)" to fill the four highest
weight divisions, he went on to explain.
"I weighed in both C.E. (Smith) and Sahlan (Mar
tin) at 158 pounds (for the weekend meets)," he said.
"Then I wrestled them where I thought they would do
best."
On Saturday, Smith wrestled at 158 and Martin
was moved up a weight class to 167. The next day they
switched places.
Horpel also said that freshman Nathan Lovelle,
who should be in the 167-pound division, has been
wrestling in the 177 class. Switching up a weight class
in this manner can give the opponent a decided weight
advantage.
On Saturday night, however, Martin and Smith
were vital to the one-point victory over the Aggies, as
both earned decisions in their favor. Also scoring vic
tories in Davis were Phil Nowick (118 lbs.), Dave
Nowick (1'26), .Jimmy Aguirre (134), and Lance John
son (142).

Sunday, Stanford only managed three victories, as
Aguirre (134), Johnson (142), and Martin (158) com
bined for a total of 10 points.
In both meets, Stanford forfeited the heavyweight
division, giving up an automatic six points.
Horpel also pointed to a good performance on Sat
urday night by freshman Tod Surmon, who lost by one
point in overtime. "He's coming off an ankle injury,
and wasn't able to move as well as he should have
been."
Freshman Aguirre continued his impressive win
ning streak with back-to-back victories, bringing his
record to seven wins and no losses.
"Jimmy Aguirre is really coming on strong," Horpel
said. "He's our only wrestler undefeated in dual meets.
"He came in as a really solid recruit, with three
state (high school) titles. The first couple of matches,
although he won, he didn't look as strong. But in the
last matches, he's been performing like everyone
thought he could."
Overall, Horpel was happy with his team's perfor
mance over the weekend.
"We're doing pretty well for what we have," he
said. "We're a very young team. Our expectations
have to be realistic.
"This is kind of a rebuilding year," Horpel said.
"We're wrestling a lot of freshmen, and we're forfeit
ing one to three weight classes each meet."
The wrestling team has two more home meets this
season. They host Oregon on Friday, Feb: 5, and
Fresno State on Feb. 6. Both meets are at 7:30, and
as always there will be complimentary pizza and soft
drinks for all spectators.
