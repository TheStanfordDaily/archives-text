# Cardinal ruggers rip Aggies 23-14 despite scrum penalties
## 
### Brian Brennan Staff writer 
Frustration. That is the word that
Stanford rugby coach Franck Boivert
used to describe his team's 23-14 win last
Saturday over UC-Davis. The Cardinal
was called repeatedly for illegal play in
the scrum, leading Boivert to put aside
his usual indifference to the officiating.
"I'm so frustrated about this referee
thing, I'm not thinking about much else
right now," Boivert said. "The ref just
took the game away from us. We couldn't
get the ball from the scrum."
After the ball is dead, the referee calls
a scrum to put the ball back in play.
Three members of each team comprise
the "front row," who crouch and lean for
ward — pushing shoulder against shoul

der. The five remaining players are
arranged behind the front three, and lean
forward to push on their teammates. The
team that is awarded the ball by the ref
eree stands outside the scrum and tosses
the ball underneath it between the two
teams, thus giving them the advantage.
The players then try to push over the
ball; if one side is losing consistently, it
will sometimes fall, or "pull down" the
scrum, to prevent the other team from
easily gaining possession. This tactic can
be effective but it is also illegal. Stanford
was repeatedly penalized for bringing
down the scrum, bewildering Boivert.
"You pull the scrum down if you are
being beaten, but we were killing them in
the scrum," Boivert said. "What was the
ref thinking?"
In their second league contest, the

Cardinal ruggers came out hard, keeping
the ball in the Aggies' half of the field for
most of the first half. Stanford controlled
the scrums and line-outs, but neverthe
less, at the half it was only Eric Flecten's
two successful penalty kicks that gave
Stanford a 6-0 lead.
Conditioning was to be the key for the
Cardinal in the second half, as the Aggies
tired and Boivert anticipated taking
advantage of his mobile lineup. Quick
play resulted in a breakaway early in the
half by Matt Tripp, who was dropped five
yards short of the goal line. Tripp's team
mates joined him to bind together and
muscle over the Aggies for the first Stan
ford try. From that point, however, the
Cardinal effort stalled, as it held on to a
13-0 lead.
The physical Aggies pounded into

their try zone soon after, as the referee
penalized Stanford for pulling down the
scrum. With the score 13-7, the match
was far from over. "Our scrum destroyed
them, but it didn't lead to anything," said
Stanford second row man Ben Wright.
"We couldn't get the ball out to the
backs."
The corps of Cardinal backs out
matched the Aggies, but without the ball
it was unable to showcase its talents.
"Communication was pretty shaky," said
Cardinal flyhalf Flecten. "It seemed like
we were overwhelming them, but we
never really had good offensive progres
sions."
The Aggies were threatening for much
of the second half, and the game was not
decided until Dan Lazar capped one of
the Cardinal's few strong second half

progressions by darting the final 10
meters through the Davis defense for the
score and a 20-7 lead. The Aggies scored
a late try, and Flecten answered with his
third penalty kick to close the scoring.
The Cardinal second team blew out
the Aggies 41-6, with a line-up bolstered
by football players Derron Klafter, Bryan
Schultz, Allen Gonzalez, Becket Hinckley
and Vince Otoupal. Stanford s third team
came up short, falling 21-0.
The Gaels of St. Mary's are up next for
the Cardinal. The third team opens play
at 11 a.m. in Moraga, with the first side
following at 1 p.m. and the seconds play
ing at 3 p.m.
"We haven't seen the difference
between playing fast and playing fran
tic," Boivert said. "That is what we must
perfect for St. Mary's."
