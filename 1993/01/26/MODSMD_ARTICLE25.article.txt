# A 						tale of one city: Cowboys, Mavericks split Dallas' sporting fate
## 
### 
It stands at once as the paragon of
excellence and at the brink of
destruction. A world of enticing pos
sibility lies before it, yet there is no
hope. It is the best of times, it is worst of
times.
This is a tale of one city, of a metropo
lis that in the sporting landscape of
early 1993 offers a contrast so marked
that even Charles Dickens would be
moved to words were he around today.
I am speaking of Dallas, a place where
the weather forecast, food and football
are hot, while business, beer and basket
ball are definitely not. A Texas joint
where the "man without the hat" can
join his top-ranked defense in the safety
dance, while the man who fired the
"shot Heard 'round the world" has to
duck so as to avoid those of his new
charges, whose pathetic tries just might
land there. The home of a dynasty
reborn and of a horrific regression, of a
team five days away from receiving a
congratulatory phone call from the lead
er of the free world and of one that
deserves to be eliminated from it.
Indeed, the opening weeks of this

year have seen an ongoing drama of
unprecedented proportions unfold in the
Lone Star State.
The NFL's Dallas Cowboys, trying to
regain the public's heart and the title of
"America's Team," have played protago
nist to the bewildering exploits of the
NBA's Dallas Mavericks, who appear to
be mimicking Olympic basketball in
their ability to make every opponent
look like the "Dream Team." The stage
is the sports pages, and everywhere
sports are discussed just the mention of
the name "Dallas" effects a discordant
reaction of jubilation and fear on par
only with the frenzy over "Who Shot
J.R.?"
The bright side
The Dallas Cowboys are the team
that beat the 49ers last week to
earn the rights to bounce the Buf
falo Bills from a third straight Super
Bowl this Sunday. This information is
essential, and I apologize to those who
stuck around and got to the back pages
of "finer" Bay Area daily publications to

see the actual 30-20 score (for those who
only had time for the front page, I hope
that your knowledge of the locations of
Steve and Joe's — or is that Joe and
Steve's? — birthmarks serves you well).
Anyway, the Cowboys are one of the
youngest and hottest teams in profes
sional football. After completing the reg
ular season at 13-3 and notching the
championship of the NFC East (foot
ball's best division), they won the rub
ber game of their season series with the
Philadelphia Eagles in the divisional
playoffs before finishing off the Niners.
Their defense, ranked No. 1 in the
league for most of the season, was so
team-oriented that none of its starters

made it to the Pro Bowl.
Their offense, led by Emmitt Smith
— the NFL's leading rusher for two
years running — as well as the big-play
tandem of quarterback Troy Aikman
and wide receiver Michael Irvin, can
explode in the face of anyone in its way
at any time.
Da 'Boys, as they are affectionately
referred to by their millions of recent
converts, are led by coach Jimmy John
son. Johnson, a man who wouldn't deign
to wear a cap on the sidelines like a cer
tain legendary former Cowboy skipper
for fear of mussing his impeccable hair
do, is by no means a stranger to win
ning. His Miami Hurricane teams won
two NCAA mythical national champi
onships and placed in the top three of
the final Associated Press poll after
every season of his tenure.
Many doubted his ability to take over
for Tom Landry, the only coach the
Cowboys had had in their 29-year, five
Super Bowl history to that point, but
Johnson quelled the fear and four sea
sons later has the franchise in Super
Bowl No. 6.

The dark side
The Dallas Mavericks were an NBA
expansion franchise — in 1979.
While they enjoyed one of the
most successful debuts of any team in
the history of professional sports at the
time, they chose to play like they were
born yesterday exactly 13 years later.
Lucky them.
Currently sporting a 3-33 record, the
Mavs are a woeful 0-17 on the road and
1-24 against Western Conference foes
(By a strange twist of fate, that would
win a playoff tiebreaker in the East).
After a Babe Ruth-for-cash, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar-for-anybody, Wayne Gret
zky-for-who-can-remember-esque trade
that sent point guard Rolando Black
man to the New York Knicks for a first
round pick in 1995, Dallas is left with
one legitimate star (Derek Harper), a
still-unsigned '92 draftee (Jimmy Jack
son) and not much else.
The Mavericks make less than 70 per
cent of their free throws, 42 percent of
their field goals, and get outscored by 17


Andy
Eiser
points a game. They have joined
hockey's San Jose Sharks and
Ottawa Senators in the "Victory
of the Month Club" by chalking up
W's at Reunion Arena against the
Atlanta Hawks, Los Angeles Lak
ers and Detroit Pistons in Novem
ber, December and January,
respectively. At their present pace,
the Mavs will shatter the Philadel
phia 76ers' "record" for futility
from 20 seasons ago at 9-73.
You get the idea. The Maver
icks are pathetic. At 2-26, coach
Richie Adubato was finally
"excused" from his duties. The
former Chuck Daly assistant was
replaced by Garfield (Gar) Heard,
whose game-tying shot at the
buzzer led to an eventual 148-146
triple overtime victory over the
Boston Celtics in the 1976 NBA
Championship Series and is still

the proudest moment in Phoenix
Suns history. Heard hasn't been
able to pull rabbits out of his hat
yet, but, hey, the Mavs are 1-7
since then, and maybe the change
did them good. Right.
Recycling the past
There was a day when the
scene in Dallas was equally
schizophrenic, but in reverse. I
recall sitting through a seminar
at the Hugh O'Brien Youth
Leadership Conference in early
June, 1988. My beloved Los
Angeles Lakers were battling the
Dallas Mavericks in game seven
of the Western Conference title
series, and there I was, slumped
in my chair with my headphones
on, making sure not to cheer
loud enough to disrupt whatever
was going on in the auditorium
(To this day I don't know). The
Lakers' five-championships-in
nine-years dynasty almost came
to a close that day, and when

they held on for a narrow victory,
I remember thinking that Dallas
would be something to reckon
with in the future.
Little did I know that the
Cowboys, they of the 1-15 record
in 1989 — Johnson's first season
after the purchase of the team by
longtime Arkansas friend Jerry
Jones — would rise from obscu
rity while the Mavericks sank to
oblivion.
The best the Mavs can hope
for, then, is a reversal of fortune,
for the ebb and How of athletic
tidings to turn the tables back on
those darned 'Boys. Until then,
the town ain't big enough for the
both of them. There's treachery
in Dickensian Dallas, so please,
no great expectations.

Andy Eiser, one of the Daily's
stuck-in-the-mud sports editors,
will be going nowhere when the
volume, or whatever it is, changes
next week. His favorite number is
1,455 — and counting.

ball are definitely not. A Texas joint
where the "man without the hat" can
join his top-ranked defense in the safety
dance, while the man who fired the
"shot Heard 'round the world" has to
duck so as to avoid those of his new
charges, whose pathetic tries just might
land there. The home of a dynasty
reborn and of a horrific regression, of a
team five days away from receiving a
congratulatory phone call from the lead
er of the free world and of one that
deserves to be eliminated from it.
Indeed, the opening weeks of this

year have seen an ongoing drama of
unprecedented proportions unfold in the
Lone Star State.
The NFL's Dallas Cowboys, trying to
regain the public's heart and the title of
"America's Team," have played protago
nist to the bewildering exploits of the
NBA's Dallas Mavericks, who appear to
be mimicking Olympic basketball in
their ability to make every opponent
look like the "Dream Team." The stage
is the sports pages, and everywhere
sports are discussed just the mention of
the name "Dallas" effects a discordant
reaction of jubilation and fear on par
only with the frenzy over "Who Shot
J.R.?"
The bright side
The Dallas Cowboys are the team
that beat the 49ers last week to
earn the rights to bounce the Buf
falo Bills from a third straight Super
Bowl this Sunday. This information is
essential, and I apologize to those who
stuck around and got to the back pages
of "finer" Bay Area daily publications to

see the actual 30-20 score (for those who
only had time for the front page, I hope
that your knowledge of the locations of
Steve and Joe's — or is that Joe and
Steve's? — birthmarks serves you well).
Anyway, the Cowboys are one of the
youngest and hottest teams in profes
sional football. After completing the reg
ular season at 13-3 and notching the
championship of the NFC East (foot
ball's best division), they won the rub
ber game of their season series with the
Philadelphia Eagles in the divisional
playoffs before finishing off the Niners.
Their defense, ranked No. 1 in the
league for most of the season, was so
team-oriented that none of its starters

made it to the Pro Bowl.
Their offense, led by Emmitt Smith
— the NFL's leading rusher for two
years running — as well as the big-play
tandem of quarterback Troy Aikman
and wide receiver Michael Irvin, can
explode in the face of anyone in its way
at any time.
Da 'Boys, as they are affectionately
referred to by their millions of recent
converts, are led by coach Jimmy John
son. Johnson, a man who wouldn't deign
to wear a cap on the sidelines like a cer
tain legendary former Cowboy skipper
for fear of mussing his impeccable hair
do, is by no means a stranger to win
ning. His Miami Hurricane teams won
two NCAA mythical national champi
onships and placed in the top three of
the final Associated Press poll after
every season of his tenure.
Many doubted his ability to take over
for Tom Landry, the only coach the
Cowboys had had in their 29-year, five
Super Bowl history to that point, but
Johnson quelled the fear and four sea
sons later has the franchise in Super
Bowl No. 6.

The dark side
The Dallas Mavericks were an NBA
expansion franchise — in 1979.
While they enjoyed one of the
most successful debuts of any team in
the history of professional sports at the
time, they chose to play like they were
born yesterday exactly 13 years later.
Lucky them.
Currently sporting a 3-33 record, the
Mavs are a woeful 0-17 on the road and
1-24 against Western Conference foes
(By a strange twist of fate, that would
win a playoff tiebreaker in the East).
After a Babe Ruth-for-cash, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar-for-anybody, Wayne Gret
zky-for-who-can-remember-esque trade
that sent point guard Rolando Black
man to the New York Knicks for a first
round pick in 1995, Dallas is left with
one legitimate star (Derek Harper), a
still-unsigned '92 draftee (Jimmy Jack
son) and not much else.
The Mavericks make less than 70 per
cent of their free throws, 42 percent of
their field goals, and get outscored by 17


Andy
Eiser
points a game. They have joined
hockey's San Jose Sharks and
Ottawa Senators in the "Victory
of the Month Club" by chalking up
W's at Reunion Arena against the
Atlanta Hawks, Los Angeles Lak
ers and Detroit Pistons in Novem
ber, December and January,
respectively. At their present pace,
the Mavs will shatter the Philadel
phia 76ers' "record" for futility
from 20 seasons ago at 9-73.
You get the idea. The Maver
icks are pathetic. At 2-26, coach
Richie Adubato was finally
"excused" from his duties. The
former Chuck Daly assistant was
replaced by Garfield (Gar) Heard,
whose game-tying shot at the
buzzer led to an eventual 148-146
triple overtime victory over the
Boston Celtics in the 1976 NBA
Championship Series and is still

the proudest moment in Phoenix
Suns history. Heard hasn't been
able to pull rabbits out of his hat
yet, but, hey, the Mavs are 1-7
since then, and maybe the change
did them good. Right.
Recycling the past
There was a day when the
scene in Dallas was equally
schizophrenic, but in reverse. I
recall sitting through a seminar
at the Hugh O'Brien Youth
Leadership Conference in early
June, 1988. My beloved Los
Angeles Lakers were battling the
Dallas Mavericks in game seven
of the Western Conference title
series, and there I was, slumped
in my chair with my headphones
on, making sure not to cheer
loud enough to disrupt whatever
was going on in the auditorium
(To this day I don't know). The
Lakers' five-championships-in
nine-years dynasty almost came
to a close that day, and when

they held on for a narrow victory,
I remember thinking that Dallas
would be something to reckon
with in the future.
Little did I know that the
Cowboys, they of the 1-15 record
in 1989 — Johnson's first season
after the purchase of the team by
longtime Arkansas friend Jerry
Jones — would rise from obscu
rity while the Mavericks sank to
oblivion.
The best the Mavs can hope
for, then, is a reversal of fortune,
for the ebb and How of athletic
tidings to turn the tables back on
those darned 'Boys. Until then,
the town ain't big enough for the
both of them. There's treachery
in Dickensian Dallas, so please,
no great expectations.

Andy Eiser, one of the Daily's
stuck-in-the-mud sports editors,
will be going nowhere when the
volume, or whatever it is, changes
next week. His favorite number is
1,455 — and counting.
It stands at once as the paragon of
excellence and at the brink of
destruction. A world of enticing pos
sibility lies before it, yet there is no
hope. It is the best of times, it is worst of
times.
This is a tale of one city, of a metropo
lis that in the sporting landscape of
early 1993 offers a contrast so marked
that even Charles Dickens would be
moved to words were he around today.
