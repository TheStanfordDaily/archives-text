An essential ingredient for the success of
any athletic squad is its ability to recover
from injury, an inevitable part of every
sporting activity. In tribute to the work ethic
and team unity that go along with this abili
ty, The Daily's Athletes of the Week — Mike
Lambert and Jene Elzie — reflect comeback
victories by the Cardinal men's volleyball
and women's gymnastics teams last week

end.
Lambert, a freshman from Kaneohe,
Hawaii, paced Stanford with 16 kills and
four blocks in the Cardinal's 15-7, 16-14, 15-
1 victory over California on Friday night.
His three digs and two service aces for the
defending NCAA runners-up were also
among team leaders.
The only member of the volleyball team's
freshman class not to redshirt this season,
Lambert was pressed into service at opposite
hitter when starters Ryan Moos and Dave
Goss were sidelined with shoulder soreness
on match night. He used the opportunity to
springboard what figures to be a promising
Stanford career — when those ahead of him
at swing and opposite hitter graduate, that is.
He will most likely return to the bench
when Moos and Goss are ready to return,
but Ijambert performed when the spotlight
was squarely on him, a quality that will be
useful as the Cardinal guns for its first-ever
national crown this spring.

Elzie, a sophomore from El Cerrito,
Calif, recovered from a bad back to set a new
Stanford record in the individual all-around
Friday night during the Cardinal's 188.15-
186.45 win in Berkeley. Her 38.975 cumula
tive score, which beat out the closest com
petitor by more than a full point, included
top-two finishes in each of the four disci
plines.
Elzie took first place in the floor exercise

— an event she was forced to sit out the pre
vious week — with a 9.75, and also earned
the top score on the balance beam, where she
tallied a 9.725. Her best mark of the evening,
a 9.775 on the uneven bars, was good for sec
ond place, as was her 9.725 on the vault.
Elzie's performance will be the key to any
chances Stanford has at making a repeat
appearance in the NCAA final meet in April.
