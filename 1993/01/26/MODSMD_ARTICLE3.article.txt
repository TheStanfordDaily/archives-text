# Jewish supporter of Palestinians discusses formation of her views
## 
### Lubna Qureishi 
Addressing a group of students and professors,
Barbara Lubin talked about her journey from a Jew
who once never knew a Palestinian, to a Jew who now
champions their rights.
"I grew up in a family that supported the right
wing policies of Israel all my life," said Lubin, direc
tor of the Middle East Children's Alliance.
Her strong support toward Israel wavered, howev
er, when she learned of the massacres by Israeli sol
diers in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila fol
lowing the 1982 Palestinian Liberation Organiza
tion's evacuation of Beirut. The camps had been
home to more than 309,000 Palestinians and
Lebanese.
Lubin visited Israel in January 1988, one month

after the beginning of the Intifada â€” the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation.
Accompanying a delegation of locally elected Amer
ican officials, Lubin visited the occupied territories of
Gaza and the West Bank. It was after this trip that she
began speaking out against Israel's policies.
"It was a difficult trip," Lubin said in her speech in
History Corner. "All about Israel I grew up with was
coming apart for me." She said the trip also inspired
her to start the Middle East Children's Alliance.
In recent years, however, Lubin has come under
attack for her views, which has caused her to some
times back away from public speaking.
Lubin said she also feels that it is difficult in Amer
ica to speak openly about Israeli injustices.
"The most frustrating thing is
the inability to speak out on this
issue," Lubin said. "People call
for sanctions in South Africa and
the end to aid in El Salvador, but
when it comes to the issue of
Palestinian rights, they are silent.
"And not only that, but they
muzzle people who try," she added.
Graduate student Hilton Oben
zinger, who assisted Lubin in her
speech, said that the media in
America are also silent on this issue.
"There is a general set of polit
ical frameworks of things that are
appropriate to say," Obenzinger
said.
According to Obenzinger, since
1948, the growing pro-Israeli sen
timent in the United States has
made it difficult for people to
speak about Palestinians. The
silence is perpetuated when the

Anti-Defamation League and Jew
ish lobbies say that any criticism
of Israel is anti-Semitic, he said.
"The ADL gathers information
on the Nazis, skinheads and KKK
and puts in the same category any
one who criticizes Israel, like Noam
Chomsky, Edward Said, Barbara
Lubin and Joel Beinin," Oben
zinger said. "This framework influ
ences those people in the media."
Although Obenzinger said that
the media is starting to portray
Palestinians as not just militant but
also as people who have been vic
timized, "even to this day, if some
thing is shown about Palestinians
there is a great deal of pressure for
balance, or for it not to be shown."
After making brief reference to
the current stand-off in Lebanon,
Lubin focused on the poor condi
tions that plague the Palestinian
refugee camps. The refugee
camps were started in 1948, and
Jabaliya, one of the largest camps,
holds more than 60,000 people.
"It's the most densely populat-

Ed place on earth," Lubin said.
"There is no indoor plumbing or
electricity."
The harsh conditions go
beyond that of infrastructure.
"All the Palestinians have to
carry passbooks. It's very similar
to the situation in South Africa.
Schools are closed off. In every
family there's at least one young
man in prison. Nine thousand to
15,000 men are held in detention.
They have no lawyers."
But Lubin said she believes
that a Palestinian state can exist
peacefully side by side with Israel.
"There is a peace movement
inside Israel," Lubin said. There
are also activists in the occupied
territories who support two states.
According to Obenzinger, the
United States is key to peace in
the Middle East.
"The U.S. needs to work in the
political arena," she said. "People
have to put pressure on candi
dates to make policies that reflect
public opinion."
