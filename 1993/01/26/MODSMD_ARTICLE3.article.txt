# Jewish supporter of Palestinians discusses formation of her views

Addressing a group of students and professors,
Barbara Lubin talked about her journey from a Jew
who once never knew a Palestinian, to a Jew who now
champions their rights.
"I grew up in a family that supported the right
wing policies of Israel all my life," said Lubin, direc
tor of the Middle East Children's Alliance.
Her strong support toward Israel wavered, howev
er, when she learned of the massacres by Israeli sol
diers in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila fol
lowing the 1982 Palestinian Liberation Organiza
tion's evacuation of Beirut. The camps had been
home to more than 309,000 Palestinians and
Lebanese.
Lubin visited Israel in January 1988, one month

after the beginning of the Intifada â€” the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation.
Accompanying a delegation of locally elected Amer
ican officials, Lubin visited the occupied territories of
Gaza and the West Bank. It was after this trip that she
began speaking out against Israel's policies.
"It was a difficult trip," Lubin said in her speech in
History Corner. "All about Israel I grew up with was
coming apart for me." She said the trip also inspired
her to start the Middle East Children's Alliance.
In recent years, however, Lubin has come under
attack for her views, which has caused her to some
times back away from public speaking.
Lubin said she also feels that it is difficult in Amer
ica to speak openly about Israeli injustices.
