# A 						time for reflection
## Multifaith Taize prayer unites religions 
### Michelle Johnson 
Every Tuesday night, nearly
two dozen voices break the silence
of the candlelit Memorial Church
with a chant:
"Magnificat. Magnificat. Mag
nificat anima mea Dominum."
The worshipers, seated on mats
on the floor of the chancel, attend
the weekly Taize services to both
both unite as a group and reflect
as individuals.
"I look forward to that time
every week where you can just
think and meditate," said senior
Monique VanderMarck, who began
going to Taize prayer in 1989 but
stopped after the earthquake when
Memorial Church closed.
She started attending services
again last fall when Taize was
moved back to the restored church.
Taize (pronounced TIE-ZAY),
an interdenominational service
that emphasizes inner reflection
through a combination of chants,
meditation, Bible readings and
prayer, at one time attracted as

many as 70 worshipers to Memorial
Church.
After the 1989 earthquake and
the closing of the church, howev
er, the Taize service was moved to
the Clubhouse and lost some par
ticipants, said the Rev. Herb
Schmidt.
Taize services arc named after
the French city in which they were
developed by an interdenomina
tional monastic order. In addition
to its unique form of worship, the
order, which was founded in 1940,
became known for its political and
social work, including helping
Jews escape from occupied France
during World War 11.
During the 19605, the monastery
attracted thousands of students,
who came there to ramp and partic
ipate in services. In 1974, the Taize
monastery hosted a World-Wide
Council of Youth, which attracted
40,000 people, including Schmidt.
"I had my four sons," he re
called. "And we got there, and we

had to hike in about 10 miles, and
take all our gear. Then it rained.
And so they had latrines, you
know, and people would fall into
the latrines. But it was the high
point of my spiritual life."
One inspiring aspect of Taize
prayer is the way it unites people
of different denominations and
those who are searching for God,
Schmidt said.
"For me, it's a symbol of what
the church should be," he said.
"All Christians working together
and [being] open to, and working
with, people of good will from
every religion and [also] people
who profess to hold no religion."
VanderMarck agreed. "It's a
good thing because it brings
together people from different
faiths," she said. "You can get
beyond those boundaries."
Schmidt estimated that Taize
worshipers at Memorial Church
are one-third Roman Catholic
students, one-third Protestant
students and one-third communi
ty members of various denomina
tions.
After visiting Taize in the '70s,
Schmidt carried the practice of
Taize prayer back to UC-Santa
Cruz, where he was a campus

minister. When he moved to Stan
ford in 1986, he and a former
campus minister, the Rev. Rus
Roide, started the services at
Memorial Church.
"For me what was attractive
about Taize was that it combined
radical political action, which was
risking their lives to help Jews in
occupied France," said Schmidt.
"So it was radically political, but
at the same time, it was radically
spiritual."
Today, the Taize monastery
has outposts in Hell's Kitchen
and impoverished areas of Africa,
Asia and Latin America. All dona
tions given to the monastery are
used to help local people. The
brothers, in turn, work to support
themselves, through writing, art
or other trades.
At Stanford, Schmidt and the
Rev. Jim Erps, who lead the ser
vices, concentrate on spiritual
development through Taize
prayer.
Many of the Taize participants
belong to other churches and are
looking for a time for individual
reflection rather than additional
commitments, he said."l think
Taize is the kind of place where
people can come, and they are not
going to be pressured."
Several of the Taize worshipers
said the services' primary appeal
was the opportunity for inner
reflection.

"It's a much more personal
worship experience than the com
munity worship I experience on
Sunday," said Sunnyvale resident
Sherri Johnson.
Taize services, which use
repetitive chants and prayers,
allow more time for contempla
tion than traditional church ser
vices, she said. "Sunday services,
while enjoyable, are sometimes
hectic."
Justine Fertig of Palo Alto said
the repetition allows her to focus
on the meaning of the Taize
chants. "They really sink into
your innermost being," she said.
VanderMarck said the service
is a time to find inner peace. "The
singing is a way to let out tension
in a positive way," she said.
Still, the political and social
awareness integral to Taize is not
ignored. The Stanford service has
two times for prayer. One, called
Prayer on the Cross, focuses on
worshipers' personal struggles.
The other, called Prayers of the
People, focuses on prayers for
humanity, emphasizing Taize's
concern with social justice.
The Rev. Aaron Carland, of
the San Jose Presbytery, said
Taize prayer helps participants
develop a method for praying.
"I think it's important to pray
in groups to remind us that it's not
just what I'm asking God but what
the church is asking God," he said.
