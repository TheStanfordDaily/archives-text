University officials say they are concerned about
living conditions at Webb Ranch and plan to meet
later this week to discuss the matter.
However, the officials say they cannot yet make a de

United Stanford Workers and must do most of their
cooking outdoors on three-foot-long Coleman stoves.
Gary Webb, the president of the ranch, maintains
that they have done all they can to help the families,
and have been working "full blast" over the past two
months to install new trailers. Webb said the work
has been delayed, though, because of complex county
regulations and the heavy rains.
However, Reuben Serna, a field representative for
USW, said the Webbs have stalled for nearly a year and
should have completed the new trailers months ago.
The new trailers are actually old Manzanita Park
trailers obtained nearly two years ago by the Webbs,
when the University offered them to anyone who
