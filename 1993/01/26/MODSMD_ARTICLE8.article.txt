# Women's Need Assessment awaits discussion by committee, students
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
A committee formed through
the Office of Student Affairs will
soon address t he recommendations
made in the report of the Women's
Need Assessment study group.
Dean of Students Michael .Jack
son said he is going to help orga
nize a committee "in the next cou
ple of weeks" to work with him to
discuss the report, which evaluat
ed the concerns and needs of
women students at Stanford and
outlined recommendations to im
prove the quality of women's lives,
such as implementing sensitivity
t rai ni ng for facu 1 ty and st a ff about
issues of sexism in the classroom
and establishing a full-time assis
tant dean for the Women's Center.
Women's Center Coordinator
Rebecca Bliss said the Women's
Center Advisory Board plans to

present their responses to the re
port and recommendations for
consideration by the committee.
Bliss said she has distributed
copies to the Women's Center Ad
visory Board, which will discuss
the report today.
Jackson said the committee will
include some original group mem
bers as well as "other people who
would be helpful," he said, adding
that it is "more than likely" that
students will be involved in the
group as well.
The committee will also work
with offices "to which the recom
mendations were forwarded,"
such as Residential Education and
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment, Jackson said.
Students who have read the re
port say it raises important issues
— such as the impact of gender is
sues and sexual harassment on
the academic environment — but

assert the need for wider distribu
tion to further discussion about
these concerns.
Distribution is important
Although the report will soon be
addressed by the committee, stu
dents say few of them know of or
have had a chance to read the re
port and offer their perspectives to
the discussion. The report com
piled student responses through
"focus groups" — residence and
graduate school-based discussions.
Senior Jane Lin, a Women's Cen
ter Collective member, said the re
port needs to be distributed so stu
dents can read and think about it.
The fact that the report repre
sents many women voicing con
cerns will give the issues more va
lidity to the University communi
ty, Lin said.
