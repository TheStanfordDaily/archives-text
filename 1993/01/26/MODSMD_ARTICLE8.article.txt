# Women's Need Assessment awaits discussion by committee, students
## 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
A committee formed through
the Office of Student Affairs will
soon address t he recommendations
made in the report of the Women's
Need Assessment study group.
Dean of Students Michael .Jack
son said he is going to help orga
nize a committee "in the next cou
ple of weeks" to work with him to
discuss the report, which evaluat
ed the concerns and needs of
women students at Stanford and
outlined recommendations to im
prove the quality of women's lives,
such as implementing sensitivity
t rai ni ng for facu 1 ty and st a ff about
issues of sexism in the classroom
and establishing a full-time assis
tant dean for the Women's Center.
Women's Center Coordinator
Rebecca Bliss said the Women's
Center Advisory Board plans to

present their responses to the re
port and recommendations for
consideration by the committee.
Bliss said she has distributed
copies to the Women's Center Ad
visory Board, which will discuss
the report today.
Jackson said the committee will
include some original group mem
bers as well as "other people who
would be helpful," he said, adding
that it is "more than likely" that
students will be involved in the
group as well.
The committee will also work
with offices "to which the recom
mendations were forwarded,"
such as Residential Education and
the Office of Multicultural Devel
opment, Jackson said.
Students who have read the re
port say it raises important issues
— such as the impact of gender is
sues and sexual harassment on
the academic environment — but

assert the need for wider distribu
tion to further discussion about
these concerns.
Distribution is important
Although the report will soon be
addressed by the committee, stu
dents say few of them know of or
have had a chance to read the re
port and offer their perspectives to
the discussion. The report com
piled student responses through
"focus groups" — residence and
graduate school-based discussions.
Senior Jane Lin, a Women's Cen
ter Collective member, said the re
port needs to be distributed so stu
dents can read and think about it.
The fact that the report repre
sents many women voicing con
cerns will give the issues more va
lidity to the University communi
ty, Lin said.
Women's Needs Assessment
Study Group chair Diana Akiya
ma said while the report has been
distributed to "key" members of
the faculty, staff and administra
tion, as well as through the Dean
of Students Office and the
Women's Center, there has been
no organized form of mass distri
bution to the University commu
nity.
However, the study group did
not have the budget to print
"thousands of copies" of the
report, said Akiyama, assistant
dean of Memorial Church. She
and the offices that had the report
gave copies to "whoever came and
got one."
Third-year graduate student
Renee Romano, a member of
Graduate Women's Network, said
the section of the report concern
ing graduate women was printed
in the network's last newsletter
as a way to initiate discussion
about it.
Assistant dean position
Although the report formally
recommends the establishment of
an assistant dean for the
Women's Center, the need for the
position is hardly a new issue,
members of the women's commu
nity say.
Bliss, the current coordinator,
said according to Women's Center
files, the need for an assistant
dean has been recognized for at
least 10 years.
Conrad, a Women's Center
Collective member, said the cur
rent 10-hour-a-week coordinator
position is not sufficient to build a
strong women's community based
around the center.
Organizing volunteers to just
keep the center open half-time
takes a great deal of energy that
could be channeled into strength
ening community ties, said Con
rad, who is also on the advisory
board.
"So much more needs to be
done besides keeping the center
open," Conrad said. For example,
one of the report's recommenda
tions calls for more interaction
between the women's center and
the ethnic community centers —
a project that could be accom
plished with a more cohesive
women's communitv.

Gender in the classroom
Much of the report focuses on
gender dynamics in the academic
setting, which students echo as an
area of great concern.
Sophomore Esther Conrad
said the report's recommenda
tions for faculty sensitivity
training were especially signifi
cant to her because of her recent

experiences in
classes.
Conrad said
she is often not
comfortable rais
ing her hand in
classes where
women "are not
treated fairly."
For example, in
some of her

classes, professors or fellow stu
dents ridicule gender issues
when they are brought up in dis
cussion.
Junior Matt Mizel said atten
tion needs to be focused on the
classroom environment because
professors "make a lot of assump
tions in how they teach."
"The academic system is defi
nitely built on patriarchy," said
Mizel, coordinator of the Stanford
Men's Collective — a men's group
he founded last quarter that dis
cusses gender issues.
Romano emphasized the need
for taking the specific needs of
graduate women into account
when implementing the recom
mendations.
For example, graduate
schools tend to have a much larg
er percentage of male students
and male faculty and reward
"socially constructed male
traits" — such as aggressiveness
— more so than undergraduate
schools.
Graduate schools need to
incorporate teaching workshops
that will offer alternatives that
are less intimidating for women
in a male-dominated environ
ment, and hire more women fac
ulty to serve as role models and
advocates for women students,
Romano said.
The report and Conduct Policy
The Women's Needs Assess
ment committee will also deter
mine how the report will "fit in"
with recommendations made by
the Work Group on Unacceptable
Sexual Conduct to supplement
their proposed policy, Jackson
said.

The policy is currently under
going a second revision to meet
the University Cabinet's approval.
Romano said the report could
also help address recent concerns
about student input in the draft
ing of the Policy on Unacceptable
Sexual Conduct.
"It seems like [the report]
could save the people who are
writing the policy a lot of leg
work," she said.
Bliss said she hopes the recent
attention focused on the policy, in
addition to the release of the
Women's Needs Assessment
report will "re-emphasize to the
University the need for more sup
port and better training" in the
area of women's issues.
