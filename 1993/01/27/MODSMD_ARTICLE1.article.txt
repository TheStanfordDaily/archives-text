# Return of the water
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Anyone who's ever dipped their
toes into the refreshing waters of
the Claw on a sweltering after
noon can rejoice — fountain-hop
ping days are here again.
Water in campus fountains will
flow next week for the first time in
more than two years, the result of
unexpectedly heavy rainfall so far
this winter.
The fountains will use non
potable water from Felt and
Searsville Lakes, both of which
are full. However, the allotment of
drinking water is still restricted
and conservation requirements
will remain in effect.
"The rules haven't changed,"
said Julie Hardin, Stanford's en
ergy management coordinator.
"As far as the immediate future
goes, it's business as usual."
The severity and length of the
drought, coupled with new federal
regulations on water use aimed at
preserving game and wildlife,
mean that conservation laws are
not likely to be lifted soon, she said.
"Because of the extensiveness
of the drought, it could take two to
three years before we're in the
clear," Hardin said.
However, she said, Stanford
"could see some kind of a break in
terms of allotment." For five
years, Stanford has been required
to hold its water use 25 percent
below 1987 levels. This restriction
may be eased by April or May, she
added.
Officials from both of Stan
ford's domestic water suppliers
said though rainfall levels to date
are above normal levels, allotment
decisions will not be made until at
least February.
Hetch Hetchy reservoir engi
neer Michael Tsang said rainfall
and snowpack water content are
both over 150 percent of normal
for this time of year. If, however,
the remainder of the season is rel
atively dry, the gains made in
December and January "won't be
much help."
Although the University did not
initially plan to run the fountains,

new pumps designed to accommo
date non-potable water have been
installed in all of them except for
the Hoop near Green Library.
Fountains ran for most of the
1989-1990 school year but were
shut off that summer. Fountain
hoppers have been inactive ever
since.
Stanford's own Lake Lagunita is
also filling from runoff, Hardin said.
University water officials will meet
with the Lake Lagunita Commis
sion to determine when to pump
additional water into the lake.
Because of the continuing uncer

tainty shrouding future water poli
cies, Hardin believes Stanford
should continue its generally cau
tious approach to water usage.
For example, the University
has taken several steps toward
reducing water use in landscap
ing. The Main Quad and new resi
dences like Kimball and Manzani
ta II were landscaped with wood
chips and drought—tolerant turf.
"I don't want to send out the
message that you can just waste
water," she said. "It's important
for all of us to remember what
we've been trying to accomplish."
