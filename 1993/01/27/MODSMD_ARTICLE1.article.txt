# Return of the water
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
Anyone who's ever dipped their
toes into the refreshing waters of
the Claw on a sweltering after
noon can rejoice â€” fountain-hop
ping days are here again.
Water in campus fountains will
flow next week for the first time in
more than two years, the result of
unexpectedly heavy rainfall so far
this winter.
The fountains will use non
potable water from Felt and
Searsville Lakes, both of which
are full. However, the allotment of
drinking water is still restricted
and conservation requirements
will remain in effect.
"The rules haven't changed,"
said Julie Hardin, Stanford's en
ergy management coordinator.
"As far as the immediate future
goes, it's business as usual."
The severity and length of the
drought, coupled with new federal
regulations on water use aimed at
preserving game and wildlife,
mean that conservation laws are
not likely to be lifted soon, she said.
"Because of the extensiveness
of the drought, it could take two to
three years before we're in the
clear," Hardin said.
However, she said, Stanford
"could see some kind of a break in
terms of allotment." For five
years, Stanford has been required
to hold its water use 25 percent
below 1987 levels. This restriction
may be eased by April or May, she
added.
Officials from both of Stan
ford's domestic water suppliers
said though rainfall levels to date
are above normal levels, allotment
decisions will not be made until at
least February.
