PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) — Vaclav

lution," Havel was Czechoslovakia's first post-
Communist president and remains the best
known Czech politician at home and abroad.

imagine no one else as the new republic's first
president.
He easily defeated his only two opponents,
winning a majority 109 votes in the 200-mem
ber Parliament as the nominee of the four-party
governing coalition of Premier Vaclav Klaus.

five-year term.
