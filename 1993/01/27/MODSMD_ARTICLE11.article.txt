# Naked Guy expelled from UC-Berkeley

BERKELEY (AP) â€” A universi
ty student who reworked a campus
motto of "Go Bear" into "Go Bare,"
as he attended class in the altogeth
er has been stripped of a place in
the school, officials said yesterday.
"I think we could see the hand
writing on the wall on this one,"
said campus Police Lt. Bill Foley.
Nineteen-year-old Andrew
Martinez, a student at the Uni
versity of California here, has
been expelled, school spokesman
Jesus Mena said. He declined to
give the reason for the expulsion,
citing confidentiality rules.
But Martinez had been facing
naked opposition from adminis
trators for some time as his
predilection for strolling around
campus in nothing but shoes
became more visible.
In September, Martinez, who
by that time was well known by
his nom de buff of the "Naked
Guy," led a campus nude-in that
drew national news exposure.
Most on campus responded to
the stark strolls with chuckles or
chiding, but the student said he
was trying to make an important
philosophical point about free
expression, a message he thought

belonged at Berkeley, birthplace of
the 1964 Free Speech Movement.
Martinez said yesterday his
expulsion notice came in a letter
that declared, "your refusal to
return to campus appropriately
clothed would continue to disrupt
essential university functions."
He said he would appeal the
expulsion.
After the nude-in, Martinez
was arrested twice, although the
district attorney declined to pros
ecute because city law does not
prohibit nudity.
But university officials, who at
first were inclined to look the other
way, took action in November,
drawing up a policy that banned
nudity on campus. Martinez was
suspended for 14 days, but that
punishment had to be rescinded
because university officials didn't
follow the proper procedure.
An administrative hearing on
Martinez' conduct followed, a ses
sion that ended just after Martinez
showed up in the buff. Subsequent
action led to the expulsion.
"My original plan was that I
was going to get expelled and then
sue for readmittance," he said. "I
can learn a lot suing them."
