# Committees pass family leave, 'motor voter' bills

WASHINGTON (AP) - Congres
sional committees moved swiftly yes
terday on family leave and "motor
voter" legislation, a pair of bills Demo
cratic leaders hope to get to President
Clinton swiftly.
The Senate Labor Committee
approved the family leave bill 13-4 while
a House Administration Elections sub
committee passed the "motor voter"
measure on a voice vote. Both were
vetoed last year by President Bush but
have Clinton's wholehearted support.
Democrats put them on a fast track,
in part, to demonstrate their claim that
gridlock is over in Washington.

"No effort has been made to take
advantage of the changed political sit
uation," said Rep. A 1 Swift, D-Wash.,
the sponsor of the voter registration
bill. He said there was no effort to
make the measure more favorable to
Democrats, even though the "partisan
political roadblock" is gone.
The family leave legislation would
require employers of 50 or more peo
ple to grant workers up to 12 weeks of
unpaid leave to care for a newborn or
tend to a family illness. The Labor
Department says it would affect just 5
percent of the nation's employers, but
40 percent of the workforce.

The "motor voter" bill is designed to
simplify voter registration procedures
in hopes more people will go to the polls.
It is so named because one feature
would entitle people to register to vote
when they apply for a driver's license.
House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-
Wash., said both measures will be
taken up on the House floor next
week; the Senate version of the family
leave legislation could hit the Senate
floor tomorrow.
The family leave measure has
widespread bi-partisan support,
though a handful of Republicans on
the Senate panel said it was inappro

priate for the government to be man
dating worker benefits.
Sponsors say it is a long overdue
protection — already accorded to
workers in many other countries —
that will encourage employee morale
and loyalty by saving them from what
otherwise could be a choice between
job and family.
The bill is expected to face little trou
ble in either chamber, although there's
talk the Republicans might try to use
the Senate debate for offering amend
ments on issues they want to force a
discussion on, such as reaffirming the
ban on homosexuals in the military.
