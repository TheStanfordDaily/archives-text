# Clinton to force lifting of gay ban in military
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House asserted the right to revoke the
ban on homosexuals in the military
without the consent of Congress yester
day and administration officials said
President Clinton may end the 50-year
old prohibition as early as today.
"The president has the power to move
forward on ending discrimination
against homosexuals in the military,"
spokesman George Stephanopoulos said.
White House press secretary Dee Dee
Myers said Clinton probably would
announce his decision today. She said, "I
don't think it gets any easier" by waiting.
Though some Republican lawmakers
explored how to force a vote, Senate Major
ity Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, pre
dicted "it will all be worked out."
"If we can avoid a legislative battle,
that's all to the good," Stephanopoulos
said. "But the president remains com
mitted to his policy."
Clinton held his first legislative strat
egy meeting with Democratic and
Republican congressional leaders, but
participants said there was only scant
discussion of lifting the military ban on
homosexuals.
Mitchell said after the meeting that

he didn't know how the Senate would
vote on the issue if it arose. But he
added, "I don't think it's going to come
to that. ... I think it will all be worked
out beforehand."
Republicans accused Clinton of ignor
ing the strong objections of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
"These experts are saying something
simple: If you are looking for a way to
destroy the discipline and esprit de corps
of a military unit, it is clear — just inject
sexual tension into the barracks," said
Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana, the GOP
point man in the fight with the new
administration.
But Republicans were not united in
their opposition. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
whose New York constituency includes a
large number of homosexuals.
"No government has the right to dis
criminate against any of its own people,"
D'Amato said. "Gays and heterosexuals
have served in the military with honor
and they will continue to serve honor
ably together in the future."
While the White House said Clinton
could act on his own, some Republicans
discussed ways to force a vote on main
taining the ban.
