## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Cheaper by the dozen?

Membership may have
its privileges, but when
you have to keep pasting
together flimsy cards and then dis
carding them every 10 weeks, you
start to wonder.
In an average, four-year stay at
Stanford, each student receives 12
different student ID cards, each of
which includes almost exactly the
same information and none of
which are particularly effective
outside the Bay Area, because they
don't display photographs of their
proud card-bearers.
In addition, most students
receive at least one meal card from
Food Service during their stay on
the Farm, and everyone was issued
a new one during fall quarter of
1991, when students' ID numbers
were changed.
Even a Vegas dealer would tire
of shuffling that many cards.
Most schools issue students a
single ID card — good for food ser
vice, as well as other uses like
entry into campus buildings and
checking out books at the libraries

— upon arrival at their hallowed
halls. The card is laminated, and
includes the student's name, ID
number and in some cases, date of
birth.
A unified system like this would
make a lot of sense at Stanford.
The cards could be compatible
with the libraries' new bar-code
system, and they could be updated
annually or quarterly with new
seals or stamps to reduce the
threat of unauthorized use by
freeloading graduates.
Not only would the issuance of a
single card avoid the wasteful pro
duction and disposal of many
thousands of extra ID cards per
year, but the switch would be a
great convenience to students:
providing students with an effec
tive, photo-bearing official student
ID that carries weight outside of
the Bay Area, reducing the num
ber of cards that students on Food
Service need to carry and eliminat
ing the hassle of constantly
switching ID cards each quarter.
It just makes sense.
