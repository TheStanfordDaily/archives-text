# Much ado about clothing

IT COULDN'T HAPPEN here.
And that's too bad. It's hard to
imagine a Stanford student
walking around campus letting it
all hang out, without a Gap shirt or
shorts in sight. Which is probably
why most of us were pulling so
hard for Naked Guy and his free
expression "cause."
But Berkeley's little-known
puritanical streak was exposed this
weekend when UC-Berkeley
administrators stripped Naked
Guy, a.k.a. Andrew Martinez, of his
student status.
Like the furor that surrounded
Henri Matisse's "Dance" — the
mural of five naked women dancing
with abandon in a circle — earlier
this century, the kneejerk reaction
of Berkeley administrators
amounts to nothing more than the
repression of someone who dares
feel at ease with his body.

Naked Guy is merely trying to
prove a point about free expression.
And by banning him from campus
for his unwillingness to conform to
the school's dress code, Berkeley
administrators are doing their
school a disservice, while making
Martinez an in-the-flesh First
Amendment martyr.
If Martinez wants to walk
around buck-naked, let him.
Those who feel threatened,
uncomfortable or nervous in the
presence of a man's genitalia can
politely look the other way when
he walks by.
And if sanitation is an issue, as
some at Berkeley have claimed,
require him to carry a towel or ban
danna to sit on in class. But
expelling Naked Guy reflects far
worse on the school than the
junior's bare bottom ever could.
After all, it's just a Weenie.
