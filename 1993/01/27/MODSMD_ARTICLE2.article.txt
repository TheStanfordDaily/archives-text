# Keeping her culture alive
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
To Mabel Pike, beading isn't just an activity
done during arts and crafts at a summer camp.
A Native American elder oftheTlingit tribe, Pike
creates her traditional beadwork designs both to
decorate moccasins and help maintain her heritage.
Pike, who has visited Stanford each January for
the past three years, spends her time teaching oth
ers to do native beadwork.
"I'm trying to keep the culture alive," said Pike,
adding that she learned the art of beading from her
grandmother when she was seven years old.
"It's almost second nature to me," she said.
"It's like eatine."

She first became acquainted with Stanford
when she met Asst. Dean of Students Jim Lari
more at a conference on education and the preser
vation of culture. Larimore suggested that she
come to Stanford and teach students here about
the Tlingit culture.
"I'll furnish my body and you furnish every
thing else," was Pike's response to Larimore's re
quest, she said.
During each of her visits, Pike has done more
than just demonstrate her own talents. She has
helped interested Stanford students learn to bead
and make their own moccasins during frequent
sessions in the Native American Cultural Center.
