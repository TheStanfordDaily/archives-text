# Keeping her culture alive
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
To Mabel Pike, beading isn't just an activity
done during arts and crafts at a summer camp.
A Native American elder oftheTlingit tribe, Pike
creates her traditional beadwork designs both to
decorate moccasins and help maintain her heritage.
Pike, who has visited Stanford each January for
the past three years, spends her time teaching oth
ers to do native beadwork.
"I'm trying to keep the culture alive," said Pike,
adding that she learned the art of beading from her
grandmother when she was seven years old.
"It's almost second nature to me," she said.
"It's like eatine."

She first became acquainted with Stanford
when she met Asst. Dean of Students Jim Lari
more at a conference on education and the preser
vation of culture. Larimore suggested that she
come to Stanford and teach students here about
the Tlingit culture.
"I'll furnish my body and you furnish every
thing else," was Pike's response to Larimore's re
quest, she said.
During each of her visits, Pike has done more
than just demonstrate her own talents. She has
helped interested Stanford students learn to bead
and make their own moccasins during frequent
sessions in the Native American Cultural Center.

Mabel Pike, a Native American elder of the Tlingit tribe, helps freshman Marissa Flannery make tra
ditional beadwork designs. Pike continues her handiwork both to decorate moccasins and to help
maintain her heritage. She has visited Stanford each January for the past three years.
The table in the center is cov
ered with different colored beads
on paper plates and partially fin
ished sets of moccasins as stu
dents learn how much time and
patience the craft requires.
"I love to sew and work with
students. This year they have cre
ated their own designs," Pike
said, adding that many students
are in the middle of making their
own pair of moccasins.
During yesterday's session, one
student worked on the tops of a
pair of moccasins with a red and
black eagle design while another,
who had completed the beadwork,
sewed the body of the slippers.
"I just hope I'm here long

enough to finish them," Pike said.
Her visit, which began Jan. 18,
will end Monday when she
returns home to Alaska.
The beadwork designs are often
symbolic of a Tlingit's clan; differ
ent patterns hail from different
clans such as the Eagle or the
Raven, the clan Pike belongs to.
But the most special designs
are the ones "coming out of your
own head," she said, adding that
she often "copies Mother Nature."
Moccasins she shows as exam
ples have emblems such as red
roses and black ravens. In addi
tion, Pike shows pictures of deco
rative frogs that she has created
out of green beads.
Pike also tells students tradi
tional Tlingit stories during pro
grams in dormitories.
The fables are also related to
her clan, Pike said. For example,

members of the Raven clan
believe that the bird is responsi
ble for the existence of the sun,
moon and stars.
During the rest of the year, she
teaches beadwork and tells stories
to students of all ages in schools
and museums in Alaska.
In addition to beading, her
native language is another cultur
al aspect that is important to
Pike, but she said she does not see
a way to help keep it alive.
"When I pass on there are no
more Tlingit-speaking people in
my family," she said. In contrast,
two of her daughters and many of
her grandchildren do beadwork.
"It's easier to learn to bead
than (to speak) Tlingit," Pike
said. "If you want to learn the
Tlingit language, you have to be
exposed to it daily. Beading you
can learn in just one session."
