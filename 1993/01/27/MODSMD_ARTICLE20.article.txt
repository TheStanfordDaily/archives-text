Daily's coverage of racial incident disappoints reader

1N THE JANUARY 21 edition of The
Daily, there was an article concern
ing racist remarks made to Mary Wu,
a senior who works at the faculty club. I
was extremely disappointed with this
article.
As a close friend of Wu's, I have been
aware of this incident since the begin
ning, and I was with her both when the
professor apologized to her and in the
executive committee meeting of the
engineering department. I was deeply
upset that The Daily revealed the name
of the professor for several reasons.
From the beginning of this incident,
Wu has not wanted his name made pub
lic. Last week, at the meeting, there was
a unanimous agreement that his name
not be mentioned.

First, this article reflects poorly on
Wu. Although there is an understated
disclaimer, it could be interpreted that
Wu was in some way responsible or at
least willing for him to be interviewed.
To the members of the committee and to
the professor himself, this could be
viewed as hypocrisy on Wu's part.
But that is a minor point. What is
most upsetting is that the emphasis was
placed on the professor and whether he
has been sufficiently punished. Wu's
actions were not done to seek revenge
nor to publicly humiliate this man.
Instead, she wanted to raise aware
ness, both his and the public's, that
these incidents occur and must not be
tolerated, especially from someone with
as much influence and status as a Stan

ford professor. There is a much broader
issue here than who insulted her.
Racism is still very prevalent in our soci
ety, and the actions and words of this
professor are an all-too-clear example of
how deep-rooted racism is.
I also believe that the article empha
sized the negative and understated the
positive outcome of this event. It dimin
ished the amount of time and effort Wu
invested in resolving the issue, as well as
the significant amount of emotional
strain she experienced.
As one of the five students who spoke
before the committee of the engineering
department, I can attest to the fact that
Wu's and the remaining students' pre
sentations had, for the most part, a huge
impact on the administration. And that

is no small accomplishment.
The event also has significantly affect
ed student groups and the Stanford com
munity in general. Besides student inter
est groups such as the Black Student
Union and Asian American Student
Association who have taken an active
role in responding to this incident, it has
been a topic of discussion in classes and
meetings among the faculty and staff.
What Wu was trying to do, and, in
many ways, accomplished, was to alert
the Stanford community, including the
administration, to these issues. By con
centrating last week's article on the pro
fessor, The Daily obscured the larger
issue.
