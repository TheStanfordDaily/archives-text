# Israeli involvement misstated by Daily
## 
### 
Free press guarantees our right to
write and publish whatever we choose.
With the freedom to express our opin
ions, however, comes a responsibility to
at least try to tell the truth.
In yesterday's article, "Jewish sup
porter of Palestinians discusses forma
tion of her views" decries both Israeli
policy towards Palestinian refugees, and
a supposed American ban on the expres
sion of ideas critical of those policies.
While Barbara Lubin, director of the
Middle East Children's Alliance, calls
the media's "pressure for balance" in
the Palestinian issue repression, there
are many of us who call it good journal
ism.
It is for this that I vigorously protest
the statement that the Sabra and Shati
la massacres of Palestinian refugees
were the acts of Israeli soldiers. One
instant of investigation, by a Daily fact
checker, would have revealed that the
September 1982 massacres were con-

ducted by rightist Lebanese militia men.
While it has been and should be debated
that the Israeli army was aware of these
killings, the implication that Israeli sol
diers, with their own hands, conducted
the massacre is both deliberately
inflammatory and patently untrue. If
the article claims to have been quoting
Lubin on this fiction, quotation marks
might have been appropriate.
It is ironic, that in writing this letter,
I join the ranks of the Anti-defamation
League and the others among Lubin's
oppressors who attempt to silence any
one critical of Israel. I have, I assure
her, no interest in suppressing anyone. I
ask only that their criticism not rest
upon a lie.
There is, thankfully, a Constitution
in this country, which prevents the kind
of political censorship that the article
deplores. The responsibilities of balance
and truth-telling in the press fall more
squarely on our shoulders. It is unfortu
nate that this responsibility was so
undermined, both in the writing and
printing of this article.
