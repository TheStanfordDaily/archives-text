# Huyck confrontation encouraged by reader
## 
### 
I cannot express my relief upon read
ing Scott Cook's letter in Monday's
Daily, in which he challenged Pete
Huyck to an open discussion of his
columns on Friday at noon in White
Plaza. This is not because I necessarily
disagree with everything Huyck has
written, but I have found some of his
pieces objectionable.
I was in a class with Huyck our fresh
man year, and found him to be an intel
ligent, clear-thinking and, most impor
tantly, reasonable person. It is because
of this that I believe Friday's discussion
in White Plaza will prove extremely ben
eficial.
It will give Huyck an opportunity to
clarify his positions and give the Stan
ford community a chance to question
him in person, and perhaps help him
understand why some people were hurt
by what he wrote.
I believe that Huyck meant no ill will
with his columns (I have even found

some of them to be quite humorous.),
but I also can understand how they
might have been interpreted as mali
cious.
I really hope you show up, Huyck,
because this is a great opportunity. Your
columns have stirred much controversy
— maybe we can channel these emotions
into a positive experience.
I strongly urge everyone who has any
thing to say about Huyck's columns to
show up on Friday — at noon in White
Plaza.
