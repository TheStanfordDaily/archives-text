## The 						Human Genome Project: Stanford researchers coax the gene-ie out of the human nucleus 
### Jennifer Cho Staff writer 
With contributions ranging from
engineering and technology develop
ment to the actual sequencing of the
genome, Stanford researchers are play
ing a key role in unraveling the secrets
and the promises of the human genome,
in part by studying an unlikely human
cousin, the yeast.
While the project title implies the
investigation of the human genome
exclusively, many researchers have
found that several lower organisms,
such as mice, Drosophila melanogaster
(the fruit fly) and even Escherichia coli
bacteria, possess genes similar to those

found in humans.
Among these scientists, Prof, of
Genetics David Botstein and Prof, of
Biochemistry and Genetics Ronald
Davis, both at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter, are sequencing the genome of Sac
charomyces yeast, more commonly
known as baker's yeast.
Both Botstein and Davis have been
studying the genetics and cellular pro
cesses of yeast for more than 20 years.
At a length of 12.5 million bases
(rungs on the DNA ladder), the yeast
genome, while still a sizable undertak
ing, is only one-two hundred and thirti
eth the size of the 3 x 109 base long
human genome.
Like many so-called model organ
isms, yeast has a short reproductive and
prolific growth cycle (only a few hours
long), which makes the manipulation of
its genome considerably more feasible
and time-efficient.
What makes yeast an ideal human
analogue, however, is its surprising sim
ilarity to humans. Botstein said that the
fungus contains major genes that oper
ate the intracellular machinery of the
organism that are "so similar to human
proteins that you can remove a yeast
gene, which will kill it, and replace the
gene with its human analogue and it will
'come back to life."'
Botstein and Davis have demonstrat
ed this phenomenon using a gene that
causes cancer when mutated.
The researchers have demonstrated
the genetic similarity between humans
and yeast in other ways. Noting that
both humans and yeast both contain
actin, a component of muscle, they
sought to determine the degree of their
similarities. In humans, muscles move

by the coordinated action of two muscle
components, actin and myosin. When
purified yeast actin was placed into a
system with a human myosin, the scien
tists noted that the yeast actin moved,
even though yeast, unlike humans, have
no muscles.
"After a billion years of evolution,
lyeast] actin still remembers the trick of
moving with myosin," Botstein said.
"The medical community resisted Sac-

charomyces as a model for
humans for a long time,"
Davis explained. "They
presented arguments
such as yeast is a
single-celled organism, so
it must be fundamentally
different from the human,
when yeast and humans are not
much different at all. They are fun
damentally the same, and the 'racial'
differences are minor "

In addition, from an ethical and
bureaucratic standpoint, yeast is an
ideal model, because its manipulation
and use in research is not subject to the
same scrutiny as other organisms such
as monkeys or humans.
In coordination with the goal of being
the first to sequence the yeast genome,
Davis' laboratory is also engaged in
developing quicker and more cost effec
tive technology. Using current technolo
gy, "a single individual working full time
with the best techniques can sequence at
best 35,000 bases a year at a cost of four
dollars a base," Davis said.
This sounds impressive, but simple
multiplication indicates that even the
investigation of the yeast genome, not to
mention that of humans, would be a
ridiculously and hopelessly expensive

endeavor.
Since the laboratory has undertaken
the ambitious task of sequencing the
entire yeast genome, a major goal is to
lower the per-base cost of sequencing
the yeast genome by developing new
techniques that can eventually be
applied to the human genome.
Davis hopes to couple innovative
engineering with biology to produce
sequencing techniques that are faster,
easier and therefore cheaper than pre
sent methods.

His lab has set the goal of increasing
the rate of sequencing bases by a
factor of two every year while
decreasing the cost per base by
the same amount.
Having embarked on
this project two years ago,
Davis estimates develop
ments in the laborato
ry have lowered
costs to one dol
lar a base. If
current

trends

contin-

ue, Davis
hopes to
lower the cost
to a very feasible
and affordable 25
cents per base within
two years, a break
through which would
contribute a great deal tc
the project overall.

"Costs need to be driven down
dramatically, and at 25 cents a base,
it makes sense to continue sequencing
and imaging," Davis said, explaining
that the cost-effectiveness of the project

has been of major concern among many
scientists.
Another Stanford contribution to the
project is being initiated by Genetics
Prof. Luigi Cavalli-Sforza, who plans to
address the question of variability
between the genomes of one person to
another, and to what extent these differ
ences are significant.

In March, Dr. David Cox and Dr.
Richard Meyers, both from UC-San
Francisco Medical school, will transfer
their mapping center to Stanford.
One of the original centers,
work in this laboratory maps
around regions of human
chromosome 4. Currently,
Cox and Meyers are
intensely involved in
the region containing
the gene responsible
for Huntington's
Disease.

With contributions ranging from
engineering and technology develop
ment to the actual sequencing of the
genome, Stanford researchers are play
ing a key role in unraveling the secrets
and the promises of the human genome,
in part by studying an unlikely human
cousin, the yeast.
While the project title implies the
investigation of the human genome
exclusively, many researchers have
found that several lower organisms,
such as mice, Drosophila melanogaster
(the fruit fly) and even Escherichia coli
bacteria, possess genes similar to those

found in humans.
Among these scientists, Prof, of
Genetics David Botstein and Prof, of
Biochemistry and Genetics Ronald
Davis, both at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter, are sequencing the genome of Sac
charomyces yeast, more commonly
known as baker's yeast.
Both Botstein and Davis have been
studying the genetics and cellular pro
cesses of yeast for more than 20 years.
At a length of 12.5 million bases
(rungs on the DNA ladder), the yeast
genome, while still a sizable undertak
ing, is only one-two hundred and thirti
eth the size of the 3 x 109 base long
human genome.
Like many so-called model organ
isms, yeast has a short reproductive and
prolific growth cycle (only a few hours
long), which makes the manipulation of
its genome considerably more feasible
and time-efficient.
What makes yeast an ideal human
analogue, however, is its surprising sim
ilarity to humans. Botstein said that the
fungus contains major genes that oper
ate the intracellular machinery of the
organism that are "so similar to human
proteins that you can remove a yeast
gene, which will kill it, and replace the
gene with its human analogue and it will
'come back to life."'
Botstein and Davis have demonstrat
ed this phenomenon using a gene that
causes cancer when mutated.
The researchers have demonstrated
the genetic similarity between humans
and yeast in other ways. Noting that
both humans and yeast both contain
actin, a component of muscle, they
sought to determine the degree of their
similarities. In humans, muscles move

by the coordinated action of two muscle
components, actin and myosin. When
purified yeast actin was placed into a
system with a human myosin, the scien
tists noted that the yeast actin moved,
even though yeast, unlike humans, have
no muscles.
"After a billion years of evolution,
lyeast] actin still remembers the trick of
moving with myosin," Botstein said.
"The medical community resisted Sac-

charomyces as a model for
humans for a long time,"
Davis explained. "They
presented arguments
such as yeast is a
single-celled organism, so
it must be fundamentally
different from the human,
when yeast and humans are not
much different at all. They are fun
damentally the same, and the 'racial'
differences are minor "

In addition, from an ethical and
bureaucratic standpoint, yeast is an
ideal model, because its manipulation
and use in research is not subject to the
same scrutiny as other organisms such
as monkeys or humans.
In coordination with the goal of being
the first to sequence the yeast genome,
Davis' laboratory is also engaged in
developing quicker and more cost effec
tive technology. Using current technolo
gy, "a single individual working full time
with the best techniques can sequence at
best 35,000 bases a year at a cost of four
dollars a base," Davis said.
This sounds impressive, but simple
multiplication indicates that even the
investigation of the yeast genome, not to
mention that of humans, would be a
ridiculously and hopelessly expensive

endeavor.
Since the laboratory has undertaken
the ambitious task of sequencing the
entire yeast genome, a major goal is to
lower the per-base cost of sequencing
the yeast genome by developing new
techniques that can eventually be
applied to the human genome.
Davis hopes to couple innovative
engineering with biology to produce
sequencing techniques that are faster,
easier and therefore cheaper than pre
sent methods.

His lab has set the goal of increasing
the rate of sequencing bases by a
factor of two every year while
decreasing the cost per base by
the same amount.
Having embarked on
this project two years ago,
Davis estimates develop
ments in the laborato
ry have lowered
costs to one dol
lar a base. If
current

trends

contin-

ue, Davis
hopes to
lower the cost
to a very feasible
and affordable 25
cents per base within
two years, a break
through which would
contribute a great deal tc
the project overall.

"Costs need to be driven down
dramatically, and at 25 cents a base,
it makes sense to continue sequencing
and imaging," Davis said, explaining
that the cost-effectiveness of the project

has been of major concern among many
scientists.

project is being initiated by Genetics
Prof. Luigi Cavalli-Sforza, who plans to

ences are significant.
