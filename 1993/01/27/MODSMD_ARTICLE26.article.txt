# After the genome is mapped, what next?
## Playing God poses problems 
### Troy Parkins Staff writer 
If you thought the controver
sy over a London company's
offer to allow parents to choose
the sex of their children stirred
controversy, then wait until you
hear about the Human Genome
Project.
This massive endeavor, com
parable to the scale of the Man
hattan Project, might be able to
provide scientists and doctors
with the instructions of how a
human is made. It will also pro
vide enough moral quandaries
to keep ethicists, futurists and
theologians employed for
decades to come. Already, sever
al debates surround the project.

One concerns the funding
behind the project. Some people
think that such a massive
undertaking will drain funds
from other important research
areas.
But this is not true; funding
for most medical research
comes out of the National Insti
tutes of Health budget, while
money for the genome project
comes from a separate source.
Financial worries pale next
to concerns about how this
information should be used and
who should be using it.
"By the end of the project we
will be able to identify major
genes and evaluate a person's
status with respect to these
genes," said Biochemistry Prof.
Paul Berg. Such information, he
added, could be encoded on a
'credit card' of sorts, which lists
the likelihood that the person
will get a particular disease — a
possibility that is ripe for abus
es.
Once the genome is
sequenced, doctors may be able
to predict a person's propensity
for getting cancer, heart disease
and diabetes. Some people are
concerned that this information

may be used against individuals
for such things as insurance
coverage or employment.
Prof, of Law Henry Greely
said, "It could have a very nega
tive effect when you can predict
someone's health costs — there
could be discrimination." Many
people think insurance compa
nies will use this information to
refuse coverage.
Lisa Ormond, from State
Farm Insurance, said that
insurance companies already
use medical records extensively
to evaluate whether or not to
give health and life insurance.
"We would not be willing to
use it unless the medical com
munity says (the technique) is
alright," Ormond said. She also
said that it was "hard to say
what will happen until it hap
pens."
Insurance companies are
taking a "wait and see"
approach, Ormond said.
According to Biochemistry
and Genetics Prof. Ronald
Davis, the simple solution
would be to change insurance
coverage. Greely agrees with
Davis in 'regard to changing the
health care finance system.
"The problem is with the health
care system, not the genome
project," he said.
The major debate has
focused on whether or not the
insurance company should get
an individual's genetic informa
tion. However, Davis raised
another interesting question:
"What if the person abused the
information?"
For example, after a patient
reviews his genetic printouts he
might purchase large amounts
of insurance to cover his ail
ments. In effect, he would be
using "inside information" to
profit. This is another problem
policy makers will have to cope
with.
Genetics Prof. Davis Botstein
said that he does not think that
life insurance will change very
much, but he does believe
health insurance will become
universal.
Some experts are concerned
that employers will use this
information to hire and fire peo
ple. An argument for this is that
an employer does not want to
waste time and money training
people who will become sick and
die shortly.
David Danbluz, the secretary
and treasurer of the Bay Area
chapter of the Teamsters
Union, had strong opinions
about this scenario.
He called such actions
"morally wrong," adding, "It's
just like they don't want to hire
people because they are HIV


Paul Berg
positive. . . . It's discrimination.
It's wrong!"
"If they are going to get a dis
ease in two years, they should still
be able to be employed for those
years and support themselves," he
said.
Another moral dilemma
involves making "designer
babies." If people know the genet
ic make up of themselves or their
offspring they may alter their mat
ing behavior to obtain certain
traits.
"I personally find people mix
ing and matching their babies dis
tressing," Greely said. He also
said, to get an intelligent, tall
Stanford Volleyball player would
take a lot of time and money and it
would not be simple.
Is a future approaching where
people marry each other for their

genes? "There could be a pro
found impact on the way people
relate with each other," Berg said.
However, he is quick to point
out, "Traits like beauty and ath
letic skills are highly complex,
involving many genes. Most peo
ple think selective mating of this
type is science fiction."
There is also resistance within
the scientific community to people
using genetic information to
choose sex, according to Berg. But
researchers are not guided by eth
ical concerns, he added.
"It is not the researcher's
responsibility to deal with conse
quences of their
work. . .researchers are guided by
knowledge."
The Human Genome Project
will go onward through these tur
bulent ethical waters. As Biology
Prof. Robert Simoni put it,"It is
quite preposterous" that people
will stop the genome project
because of these social policy
issues.

out, "Traits like beauty and ath
letic skills are highly complex,
involving many genes. Most peo
ple think selective mating of this
type is science fiction."
There is also resistance within
the scientific community to people
using genetic information to
choose sex, according to Berg. But
researchers are not guided by eth
ical concerns, he added.
"It is not the researcher's
responsibility to deal with conse
quences of their
work. . .researchers are guided by
knowledge."
The Human Genome Project
will go onward through these tur
bulent ethical waters. As Biology
Prof. Robert Simoni put it,"It is
quite preposterous" that people
will stop the genome project
because of these social policy
issues.
If you thought the controver
sy over a London company's
offer to allow parents to choose
the sex of their children stirred
controversy, then wait until you
hear about the Human Genome
Project.
This massive endeavor, com
parable to the scale of the Man
hattan Project, might be able to
provide scientists and doctors
with the instructions of how a
human is made. It will also pro
vide enough moral quandaries
to keep ethicists, futurists and
theologians employed for
decades to come. Already, sever
al debates surround the project.

One concerns the funding
behind the project. Some people
think that such a massive
undertaking will drain funds
from other important research
areas.
But this is not true; funding
for most medical research
comes out of the National Insti
tutes of Health budget, while
money for the genome project
comes from a separate source.
Financial worries pale next
to concerns about how this
information should be used and
who should be using it.
"By the end of the project we
will be able to identify major
genes and evaluate a person's
status with respect to these
genes," said Biochemistry Prof.
Paul Berg. Such information, he
added, could be encoded on a
'credit card' of sorts, which lists
the likelihood that the person
will get a particular disease — a
possibility that is ripe for abus
es.
Once the genome is
sequenced, doctors may be able
to predict a person's propensity
for getting cancer, heart disease
and diabetes. Some people are
concerned that this information

may be used against individuals
for such things as insurance
coverage or employment.
Prof, of Law Henry Greely
said, "It could have a very nega
tive effect when you can predict
someone's health costs — there
could be discrimination." Many
people think insurance compa
nies will use this information to
refuse coverage.
Lisa Ormond, from State
Farm Insurance, said that
insurance companies already
use medical records extensively
to evaluate whether or not to
give health and life insurance.
"We would not be willing to
use it unless the medical com
munity says (the technique) is
alright," Ormond said. She also
said that it was "hard to say
what will happen until it hap
pens."
Insurance companies are
taking a "wait and see"
approach, Ormond said.
According to Biochemistry
and Genetics Prof. Ronald
Davis, the simple solution
would be to change insurance
coverage. Greely agrees with
Davis in 'regard to changing the
health care finance system.
"The problem is with the health
care system, not the genome
project," he said.
The major debate has
focused on whether or not the
insurance company should get
an individual's genetic informa
tion. However, Davis raised
another interesting question:
"What if the person abused the
information?"
For example, after a patient
reviews his genetic printouts he
might purchase large amounts
of insurance to cover his ail
ments. In effect, he would be
using "inside information" to
profit. This is another problem
policy makers will have to cope
with.
Genetics Prof. Davis Botstein
said that he does not think that
life insurance will change very
much, but he does believe
health insurance will become
universal.
Some experts are concerned
that employers will use this
information to hire and fire peo
ple. An argument for this is that
an employer does not want to
waste time and money training
people who will become sick and
die shortly.
David Danbluz, the secretary
and treasurer of the Bay Area
chapter of the Teamsters
Union, had strong opinions
about this scenario.
He called such actions
"morally wrong," adding, "It's
just like they don't want to hire
people because they are HIV


Paul Berg
positive. . . . It's discrimination.
It's wrong!"
"If they are going to get a dis
ease in two years, they should still
be able to be employed for those
years and support themselves," he
said.
Another moral dilemma
involves making "designer
babies." If people know the genet
ic make up of themselves or their
offspring they may alter their mat
ing behavior to obtain certain
traits.
"I personally find people mix
ing and matching their babies dis
tressing," Greely said. He also
said, to get an intelligent, tall
Stanford Volleyball player would
take a lot of time and money and it
would not be simple.
Is a future approaching where
people marry each other for their

genes? "There could be a pro
found impact on the way people
relate with each other," Berg said.
However, he is quick to point
out, "Traits like beauty and ath
letic skills are highly complex,
involving many genes. Most peo
ple think selective mating of this
type is science fiction."
There is also resistance within
the scientific community to people
using genetic information to
choose sex, according to Berg. But
researchers are not guided by eth
ical concerns, he added.
"It is not the researcher's
responsibility to deal with conse
quences of their
work. . .researchers are guided by
