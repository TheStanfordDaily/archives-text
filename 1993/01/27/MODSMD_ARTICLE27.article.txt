Q: Why do weather patterns move from west
to east? Since the earth turns from west to
east, it seems like this means the atmosphere
would have to be turning faster than the plan
et. Is this possible?
Feeling dizzy,
— Grant McFarland
A: If you think about it for a minute, the
idea of something on the earth's surface
moving faster than the earth turns isn't
that much a stretch. For example, suppose
you load up your car and drive to Tahoe — lo
and behold, your car and all your ski equip
ment are moving around earth's axis faster
than the earth rotates!
Thus, you have to accept that it's at least
possible for some physical entity to "turn
faster than the planet" without violating one
of Newton's Big Three.
Nonetheless, I grant you that it's sort of
counterintuitive for weather patterns to move
west to east (as they indeed do) — regardless
of whether it's possible for such a thing to
happen, how does it get started? One might
expect the earth to slip out from underneath
the atmosphere (due to the inertia of the air),
resulting in an overall east-to-west motion of
weather patterns, but in the grand scheme of
things this just doesn't happen. Why?
The primary driving force of Earth's

weather is sunlight. The amount and distribu
tion of solar radiation can be credited (or
blamed) for most of the big-picture meteoro
logical events that occur on our world, and the
west-to-east motion of weather patterns is an
especially facile example of this.
As everyone and their dog knows, the
earth's axis of daily rotation is tilted (22
degrees 30 minutes, to be precise) with respect
to its plane of revolution about the sun. As a
consequence of this tilt, high latitudes get
solar radiation at a fairly oblique angle and
consequently remain cool all year round, get
ting especially frigid in the winter.
Low latitudes (from the equator to about
30 degrees North and South), however,
receive substantial radiational heating
whether it's winter or summer, and experi
ence little variation in temperature over the
course of the year.

The weather-pattern story begins in these
low latitudes. All year round, the level of solar
heating over the humid tropics is pretty much
the highest in the world. The hot air immedi
ately above these regions, being less dense
than the cool air higher up, wants to rise, and
does. However, because of the stable stratifi
cation of the atmosphere into layers, the ris
ing convectional current encounters a ceiling
(the border between the lower layers of the
atmosphere and the higher stratosphere) and
can climb no further.
Rather than turning around and settling
down to where it came from, this restless air
diverges toward the poles, carrying with it the
moisture and heat it picked up over the trop
ics. That's not all it's carrying, however — like
any other massive object, the moving air

retains the angular momentum it
picked up while over the equator.
Angular momentum is propor
tional to the angular velocity with
which a body rotates. Angular
velocity depends solely on the
number of times an object goes
around a circle during some unit
time. Thus, the minute hand of
Big Ben has the same angular
velocity as the minute hand of my
faithful Swatch™.
But angular momentum has
two other factors: It is propor
tional to mass and the distance
of the rotating body from the
axis of rotation. For our discus
sion, the latter is more impor
tant: Equatorial air is farther
away from the earth's axis than

is air closer to the pole. Having
more or less the same mass and
the same angular velocity (one
circle per day) as the poleward
air, this greater distance results
in a greater angular momen
tum.
When the tropical air we were
discussing earlier migrates north
or south, it loses distance from
the rotational axis. In order to
conserve its angular momentum,
it has to increase its angular
velocity in the direction of the
earth's rotation — i.e., west to
east — and as the air moves, so do
the weather patterns.
Well, there it is.
