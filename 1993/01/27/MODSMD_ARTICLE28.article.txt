## It's out with the old, in with the new for baseball '93 Cardinal squad starts season Saturday 
### Brian Egan Editorial staff 
"We have a talented, young, and enthu
siastic team," Cardinal baseball coach
Mark Marquess said in assessing the
prospects of his 1993 squad.
"But we have never had to replace so
many players before."
Indeed, Stanford, which begins its sea
son Saturday against St. Mary's at Sunken
Diamond, returns only nine of 24 letter
men from its 1992 team, a group that
amassed a 39-23 record, a second place fin
ish in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division (Six-Pac), and an appearance in
the NCAA South II Regionals.
None of the departed will be missed
more dearly than centerfielder Jeffrey
Hammonds. Hammonds, a consensus All-
American, won last season's Six-Pac bat
ting crown with a .380 average, and was
nabbed by the Baltimore Orioles with the
fourth selection overall in last June's pro
fessional draft.
Also notably absent are pitching
workhorses Rick Helling, Brian Sackinsky
and Jamie Sepeda. The three righthanders
combined for 43 starts and 22 wins in '92.
"Realistically, it will be difficult to
replace the production of the pitchers that
we lost," Marquess said. "To be honest,
I'm not sure exactly how we're going to do
it yet."
However, the Cardinal cupboard of tal
ent is far from bare. The infield should be
one of Stanford's main strengths, as a
young yet experienced nucleus returns.
Sophomore Dusty Allen (10 home runs, 46

runs batted in, .296 batting average in '92)
can be expected build on last season's suc
cess. As a freshman, the right-handed first
baseman started in 58 games and finished
the year tied for the team lead in
roundtrippers.
"Allen was real solid for us last year,"
Marquess said. "He's our best returning
offensive player, and he'll provide us with
some power."
Stanford also returns three quality mid
dle infielders in junior Jeff DesJardins and
sophomores Jed Hansen and Todd Laßoc
ca. Hansen (3 HR, 20 RBI, .263), who saw
most of his action last year at shortstop
and third base, will move to second base
this season. Laßocca, who started at short
stop in nine of the Cardinal's final 11
games, hit at a sizzling .410 clip in 39 at
bats in '92. DesJardins, recovering from
back problems, will battle for playing time
at both positions.
In the outfield, junior Nate Olmstead
should see plenty of time in left. Olmstead
(1 HR, 13 RBI, .284), primarily used as a
designated hitter last year, became one of
the Cardinal's top offensive performers as
he batted .345 in the second half of 1992.
"Nate and Laßocca came on strong at
the end last year," Marquess said. "I
expect both of them to step in and con
tribute."
Despite the loss of Helling, Sackinsky
and Sepeda, the Cardinal pitching corps
should be strong. Junior Willie Adams
established himself as the staff ace in '92,
leading the team in innings pitched (113),

and finishing fifth in the Six-Pac
with a 3.91 earned run average.
Adams, is preseason All-American
candidate, and one of the top pro
prospects in the nation.
"In Willie, we have one of the
best pitchers in the conference, if
not the country," Marquess said.
"He's our No. 1 starting pitcher."
Junior Andrew Lorraine (2-0
record, 4.26 ERA) will shift from
the bullpen to the starting rotation,
where he will become Stanford's
first full-time left-handed starter
since 1985.
The Cardinal roster will also be
bolstered by one of its best incom
ing freshman classes in years. Led
by 1992 Gatorade High School
Baseball Player of the Year A.J.
Hinch, Stanford's incoming
recruits were tabbed tops in the
country by Baseball America, and
No. 2 by Collegiate Baseball.
Hinch, a strong-armed catcher
from Midwest City, Okla., will start
behind the plate, and freshmen
Cale Carter and Brian Dallimore
will see playing time at center field
and third base, respectively.
Marquess expects his team to
struggle in the talent-laden Six-Pac,
where five of six clubs competed in
NCAA action last year.
"We're going to take our lumps
early," the coach said. "Everyone in
the league has talent; the real ques
tion is, 'To what stage has your talent
developed?'"
Indeed, with the difference
between first and last place in the
Six-Pac a meager five games last sea
son, development could be the differ
ence between a first and second divi
sion finish for the Cardinal.
Marquess agreed. "It's difficult to go
to the team and say, '(Xir goal is to win
the conference,' because that's not veiy
realistic. Right now, making the
(NCAA) playoffs is a tremendous goaL"

Hinch, Stanford's incoming
recruits were tabbed tops in the
country by Baseball America, and
No. 2 by Collegiate Baseball.
Hinch, a strong-armed catcher
from Midwest City, Okla., will start
behind the plate, and freshmen
Cale Carter and Brian Dallimore
will see playing time at center field
and third base, respectively.
Marquess expects his team to
struggle in the talent-laden Six-Pac,
where five of six clubs competed in
NCAA action last year.
"We're going to take our lumps
early," the coach said. "Everyone in
the league has talent; the real ques
tion is, 'To what stage has your talent
developed?'"
Indeed, with the difference
between first and last place in the
Six-Pac a meager five games last sea
son, development could be the differ
ence between a first and second divi
sion finish for the Cardinal.
Marquess agreed. "It's difficult to go
to the team and say, '(Xir goal is to win
the conference,' because that's not veiy
realistic. Right now, making the
(NCAA) playoffs is a tremendous goaL"
"We have a talented, young, and enthu
siastic team," Cardinal baseball coach
Mark Marquess said in assessing the
prospects of his 1993 squad.
"But we have never had to replace so
many players before."
Indeed, Stanford, which begins its sea
son Saturday against St. Mary's at Sunken
Diamond, returns only nine of 24 letter
men from its 1992 team, a group that
amassed a 39-23 record, a second place fin
ish in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division (Six-Pac), and an appearance in
the NCAA South II Regionals.
None of the departed will be missed
more dearly than centerfielder Jeffrey
Hammonds. Hammonds, a consensus All-
American, won last season's Six-Pac bat
ting crown with a .380 average, and was
nabbed by the Baltimore Orioles with the
fourth selection overall in last June's pro
fessional draft.
Also notably absent are pitching
workhorses Rick Helling, Brian Sackinsky
and Jamie Sepeda. The three righthanders
combined for 43 starts and 22 wins in '92.
"Realistically, it will be difficult to
replace the production of the pitchers that
we lost," Marquess said. "To be honest,
I'm not sure exactly how we're going to do
it yet."
However, the Cardinal cupboard of tal
ent is far from bare. The infield should be
one of Stanford's main strengths, as a
young yet experienced nucleus returns.
Sophomore Dusty Allen (10 home runs, 46

runs batted in, .296 batting average in '92)
can be expected build on last season's suc
cess. As a freshman, the right-handed first
baseman started in 58 games and finished
the year tied for the team lead in
roundtrippers.
"Allen was real solid for us last year,"
Marquess said. "He's our best returning
offensive player, and he'll provide us with
some power."
Stanford also returns three quality mid
dle infielders in junior Jeff DesJardins and
sophomores Jed Hansen and Todd Laßoc
ca. Hansen (3 HR, 20 RBI, .263), who saw
most of his action last year at shortstop
and third base, will move to second base
this season. Laßocca, who started at short
stop in nine of the Cardinal's final 11
games, hit at a sizzling .410 clip in 39 at
bats in '92. DesJardins, recovering from
back problems, will battle for playing time
at both positions.
In the outfield, junior Nate Olmstead
should see plenty of time in left. Olmstead
(1 HR, 13 RBI, .284), primarily used as a
designated hitter last year, became one of
the Cardinal's top offensive performers as
he batted .345 in the second half of 1992.
"Nate and Laßocca came on strong at
the end last year," Marquess said. "I
expect both of them to step in and con
tribute."
Despite the loss of Helling, Sackinsky
and Sepeda, the Cardinal pitching corps
should be strong. Junior Willie Adams
established himself as the staff ace in '92,
leading the team in innings pitched (113),

and finishing fifth in the Six-Pac
with a 3.91 earned run average.
Adams, is preseason All-American
candidate, and one of the top pro
prospects in the nation.
"In Willie, we have one of the
best pitchers in the conference, if
not the country," Marquess said.
"He's our No. 1 starting pitcher."
Junior Andrew Lorraine (2-0
record, 4.26 ERA) will shift from
the bullpen to the starting rotation,
where he will become Stanford's
first full-time left-handed starter
since 1985.
The Cardinal roster will also be
bolstered by one of its best incom
ing freshman classes in years. Led
