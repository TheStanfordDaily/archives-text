## It's out with the old, in with the new for baseball '93 Cardinal squad starts season Saturday 
### Brian Egan Editorial staff 
"We have a talented, young, and enthu
siastic team," Cardinal baseball coach
Mark Marquess said in assessing the
prospects of his 1993 squad.
"But we have never had to replace so
many players before."
Indeed, Stanford, which begins its sea
son Saturday against St. Mary's at Sunken
Diamond, returns only nine of 24 letter
men from its 1992 team, a group that
amassed a 39-23 record, a second place fin
ish in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division (Six-Pac), and an appearance in
the NCAA South II Regionals.
None of the departed will be missed
more dearly than centerfielder Jeffrey
Hammonds. Hammonds, a consensus All-
American, won last season's Six-Pac bat
ting crown with a .380 average, and was
nabbed by the Baltimore Orioles with the
fourth selection overall in last June's pro
fessional draft.
Also notably absent are pitching
workhorses Rick Helling, Brian Sackinsky
and Jamie Sepeda. The three righthanders
combined for 43 starts and 22 wins in '92.
"Realistically, it will be difficult to
replace the production of the pitchers that
we lost," Marquess said. "To be honest,
I'm not sure exactly how we're going to do
it yet."
However, the Cardinal cupboard of tal
ent is far from bare. The infield should be
one of Stanford's main strengths, as a
young yet experienced nucleus returns.
Sophomore Dusty Allen (10 home runs, 46

runs batted in, .296 batting average in '92)
can be expected build on last season's suc
cess. As a freshman, the right-handed first
baseman started in 58 games and finished
the year tied for the team lead in
roundtrippers.
"Allen was real solid for us last year,"
Marquess said. "He's our best returning
offensive player, and he'll provide us with
some power."
Stanford also returns three quality mid
dle infielders in junior Jeff DesJardins and
sophomores Jed Hansen and Todd Laßoc
ca. Hansen (3 HR, 20 RBI, .263), who saw
most of his action last year at shortstop
and third base, will move to second base
this season. Laßocca, who started at short
stop in nine of the Cardinal's final 11
games, hit at a sizzling .410 clip in 39 at
bats in '92. DesJardins, recovering from
back problems, will battle for playing time
at both positions.
In the outfield, junior Nate Olmstead
should see plenty of time in left. Olmstead
(1 HR, 13 RBI, .284), primarily used as a
designated hitter last year, became one of
the Cardinal's top offensive performers as
he batted .345 in the second half of 1992.
"Nate and Laßocca came on strong at
the end last year," Marquess said. "I
expect both of them to step in and con
tribute."
Despite the loss of Helling, Sackinsky
and Sepeda, the Cardinal pitching corps
should be strong. Junior Willie Adams
established himself as the staff ace in '92,
leading the team in innings pitched (113),
