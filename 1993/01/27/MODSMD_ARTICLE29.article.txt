# Fencers find success in Keystone State

Few people ever have to endure a red-eye
flight highlighted by a two-hour layover, mix
ups with rental cars and problems with their
hotel. And most of them don't have to compete
for five hours afterwards â€” on less than two
hours of sleep. The Stanford fencing team did
all of that last week and still came away from a
difficult Eastern road trip with a winning
record.
"We got there late and had trouble with the
cars and the hotel and didn't have time to rest
up before the meet," women's team captain
Lana Kangsaid.
The Cardinal men's and women's teams
met their toughest competition of the season
at Pennsylvania and Penn State last Thursday
and Saturday and, despite their initial set
backs, came away with 6-3 and 6-4 records,
respectively.
"We are very pleased with our results with
our East coast trip," men's head coach Zoran
Tulum said. "I saw the way my men fenced
against different competition and now can cus
tomize my practices."
Women's head coach Sherry Posthumus
felt similarly. "It was a great indication of how
we are going to do at NCAA's," Posthumus
said. "I feel really good about the whole thing."
After arriving in Philadelphia early Thurs
day, the squad met Rutgers, Penn and Temple
(women only).
The men fell to Penn 18-9 and beat Rutgers
15-12. The women were defeated by Penn 11-5

and Temple by the same score, but crushed
Rutgers 12-4.
The scores were indicative of the fatigue
incurred by the fencers after their difficult
trip.
"It affected me pretty majorly," said Jeremy
Nelson, senior epee man. "If your timing is just
a little bit off, that's it."
Despite their teams' defeats, the coaches
were pleased with Stanford's overall perfor
mance.
"I'm extremely pleased," Posthumus said.
"We did especially well that first day. If we
hadn't travelled under the conditions we did
we would have easily beaten Penn and given
Temple a much better run. I'm looking for
ward to meeting them at the NCAA's."
After a day of rest, the team then travelled
to Penn State to meet even tougher oppo
nents.
"That was very difficult because we had to
fence seven varsity teams for an hour to an
hour-and-a-half with no breaks," Tulum
explained. "The highlight was definitely foil
against Penn State. Each match was close and
could have gone either way."
With the loss of Keith Early, the men's No.
1 sabre man, to academic ineligibility, the
team has struggled and looked to others to
excel.
"All the third-man spots in each weapon
did more than I was expecting from them,"
Tulum said.
The men defeated Johns Hopkins, Cornell,
Navy and Northwestern by identical 17-10
scores and downed Duke 19-8. They were

defeated by Penn State 20-7 and North Car
olina 15-12.
"Penn State are defending champs (NCAA)
and their sabre is really strong," Tulum said.
"They have two NCAA champs. Our captain,
Glenn Wong, beat the acting champ in the
sabre. The last three years, his only losses
have been to Stanford sabremen from our
P.E. classes."
The Cardinal women had similar results in
Saturday's matches. They defeated North
Carolina 11-5, Navy 15-1, Cornell and Duke
by 12-4 scores and Northwestern 10-6. They
fell to Penn State 9-7 and Fairleigh Dickinson
8-8 on a tiebreaking three-touch difference.
"We figured we'd lose to Penn State,"
Posthumus said. "The way the lineup was
organized, we faced FDU, the second
strongest school there, after Penn State."
Individually, the tournament was a success
for the women, according to Posthumus, who
was "really pleased with the performance of
our three freshmen [Morgan Hoch, Chloe
Sladden and Steph WienJ."
Kang, the team captain, agreed with her
coach. "I was really proud of my team, they've
improved a lot," said Kang.
With the first of two major road trips
behind them, the fencers are preparing for
their next big test against major West Coast
competition at Cal Tech on Feb. 6 and 7. That
meet will be a tune-up for Western Regional
Championships one month later.
"I feel so confident about the team now,"
Tulum said. "We are just going to crush every
one on the West Coast."
