# ASSU OK's Ice-T
## Rap singer to speak on campus; ASSU may lose $90,000 in funds 
### Elise Wolfgram Staff writer 
Controversial rap artist Ice-T
will speak on campus Feb. 20 with
the help of the ASSU Senate,
which unanimously approved
funding for his visit last night.
Ice-T's song "Cop Killer"
stirred much controversy during
the past year for its title and lyrics,
prompting several police depart
ments across the country to call
for a boycott of his album.
The ASSU will pay $4,000 of
the $6,500 total cost of the speech.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau, the
Stanford Concert Network and
Roble Hall are sponsoring the
event, which was conceived as a
Residential Education idea.
"I thought of this after Clinton
was elected, "said Roble resident as
sistant Nicole Sanchez, who orga
nized the speech. "I felt Tipper Gore
as Second Lady was an issue that
wasn't addressed as far as music
censorship and labelling goes, so I
decided to bring a controversial per
son who would have hands-on expe
rience with it to campus."
During his presentation, titled
"A Conversation With Ice-T," the
performer will discuss topics such
as his personal history, the validity
of the criticism he has received, his
personal agenda and motivation, as
well as issues such as free speech
and civil liberties, Sanchez said.
Details such as security and
ticketing have not been worked out
yet, she said, but added that the
event will only be open to Stanford
faculty, students and staff She
said a lottery for tickets is likely.
"There have always been con
troversial speakers brought in by
the Speakers Bureau, and in keep
ing with tradition, I think it will be
an interesting event," undergrad
uate senator Mork Murdock said.
In other news, the ASSU may
encounter large budget difficul
ties next year if the University
cuts its $90,000 subsidy as expect

ed. And if students prefer to have a
Council of Presidents next year,
the ASSU will have to pay out an
extra $20,000 in COP salaries,
which were not included in this
year's budget.
After winning last spring's
election, "The I Prefer Not to
Have a COP" slate fulfilled its
campaign promise by immediately
resigning.
The ASSU must plan for the
subsidy cut, although the Univer
sity has not officially informed the
group of its elimination, said Brian
Flachs, Chairman of the ASSU
Budget and Finance Committee.
Flachs said the Budget and Fi
nance Committee is investigating
the possible elimination of the
ASSU banking service and the "as
sociated policing" of the budgets of
ASSU-funded student groups,
which total about $40,000.
Other possibilities include the
permanent elimination of COP
salaries, closing some of the ASSU
discretionary accounts — which
hold money budgeted to ASSU di
visions such as the Senate — and
no longer saving funds by deposit
ing them in the reserve accounts.
The committee is also looking
at replacing grants to student
groups with loans and end the fee
refund system.
"Overall, the $90,000 budget
cut is sure to dramatically change
the way the ASSU does business,"
Flachs wrote in his report to the
senate. "The necessary reductions
in paid staff will reduce the ASSU
to overseeing the business pro
jects, running the special fee sys
tem and supporting the senate."
Graduate senator Sanford
Dickert also informed the senate
that the Memorial Auditorium
sound system will be completed a
month later than planned due to a
mix-up with Events and Services.
He said the showing of "Apoca
lypse Now" has been moved from
Feb. 7 to March 7. when the sound
system will debut.
