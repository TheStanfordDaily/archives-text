# Hoops harbors high hopes for winning week
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
After an encouraging, though
not victorious, road swing in Los
Angeles last weekend, the Stan
ford men's basketball team
returns to Maples Pavilion with
a strong possibility of earning
some wins.
Stanford (6-11, 1-4 Pacific 10
Conference) plays host to the
two Washington schools this
weekend, each of whose league
record is only one game better
than the Cardinal's.
Stanford put forth a solid
effort against UCLA and USC,
playing strong defense that
allowed the Cardinal to stay com
petitive throughout both con
tests. In its 84-76 loss to the Bru
ins, Stanford employed an effec
tive zone, forcing UCLA to win
the game from the outside. Aside
from the three-point shooting of
UCLA reserve Kevin Dempsey,
who unpredictably came off the
bench to shoot four-of-five from
the stripe, coach Mike Mont
gomery's game plan was right on
target. As for the USC game,
Stanford's perimeter defense
shut down the Trojans' outside
shooting threats, but USC's
inside players wore down Stan
ford's big men in the end.
"We forced them to go to sec
ondary ways in order for them to
win, and in both cases they
responded," Montgomery said.
"Defensively, we played well. We
played intelligently and we
played hard.

Marcus Lollie and the Cardinal hope to pick up a pair of Pac-10 victories In home contests against
Washington and Washington State later this week.
"To go to Los Angeles and
compete against two good teams
is encouraging, but we have to
take the next step and win."
That next step could come
tomorrow night against Wash
ington State.
The Cougars (8-6, 2-3),
though fresh off a home sweep
of Oregon and Oregon State,
were projected by many to finish
in the bottom half of the confer
ence.
Washington State plays in a
style similar to USC's, employ
ing a three-guard, two-forward
lineup with an emphasis on
perimeter shooting. Senior
guard Bennie Seltzer leads the
way with a 15.9 points per game
average.
"They are not as big as
USC, but they're quicker,"
Montgomery said. "They play

with a lot of emotion and play
an aggressive man-to-man
defense."
A pleasant surprise for the
Cougars has been the play of
freshman forward Mark Hen
drickson, who ranks second in
the Pac-10 in rebounding and is
averaging 13 points a game.
"Hendrickson is athletic and
has a real good touch," Mont
gomery said. "You have to be
impressed with a freshman who
puts those kind of numbers on
the board."
Matching up with Washing
ton (8-6, 2-3), though, demands
that Stanford take an approach
similar to that used in the UCLA
game in trying to minimize the
effectiveness of the Husky front
line.
Six-foot-11 center Rich Man
ning, who comes to the Bay Area
averaging 16.1 points and 9.7
rebounds per outing, is danger
ous when he has room to maneu
ver and is considered one of the
conference's best big men.

"If he gets isolated at the
block, he's as good a scorer as
(Oregon State's Scott) Haskin,"
Montgomery said.
What has been Stanford's
main problem as of late is that
the Cardinal has been unable to
maintain a high level of play in
the closing minutes, often
being both outscored and outre
bounded.
"We haven't been able to
score in spurts," Montgomery
said. "That has pretty much
been our undoing. We get tired
late in games, so that leads to
some errors."
More production needs to
come from inside, where Jim
Morgan, Bart Lammersen and
Todd Manley have combined for
just 11 points in the past two
games.
"We can't win with only three
of the five people on the floor
having the ability to score,"
Montgomery said.
"We can't accept things the
way they are."
