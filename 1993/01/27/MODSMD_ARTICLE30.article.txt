After an encouraging, though
not victorious, road swing in Los
Angeles last weekend, the Stan
ford men's basketball team
returns to Maples Pavilion with
a strong possibility of earning
some wins.
Stanford (6-11, 1-4 Pacific 10
Conference) plays host to the
two Washington schools this
weekend, each of whose league
record is only one game better
than the Cardinal's.
Stanford put forth a solid
effort against UCLA and USC,
playing strong defense that
allowed the Cardinal to stay com
petitive throughout both con
tests. In its 84-76 loss to the Bru
ins, Stanford employed an effec
tive zone, forcing UCLA to win
the game from the outside. Aside
from the three-point shooting of
UCLA reserve Kevin Dempsey,
who unpredictably came off the
bench to shoot four-of-five from
the stripe, coach Mike Mont
gomery's game plan was right on
target. As for the USC game,
Stanford's perimeter defense
shut down the Trojans' outside
shooting threats, but USC's
inside players wore down Stan
ford's big men in the end.
"We forced them to go to sec
ondary ways in order for them to
win, and in both cases they
responded," Montgomery said.
"Defensively, we played well. We
played intelligently and we
played hard.
