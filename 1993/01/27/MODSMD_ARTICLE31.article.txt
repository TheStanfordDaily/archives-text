# Prepare for annual overindulgence:
## It's Super Sunday 
### 
Ah yes, it's finally here.
The event that the
media craves, the time
when beer vendors crank up
the taps and Doritos already
knows that you're probably
going to crunch more than you
want, so they make more . . .
and more and more. Four days
from now the streets will be
empty and the couches full as
Americans celebrate the only
holiday that the Post Office
doesn't close for, and that's
because it always falls on a
Sunday.

That's right, the entire
country will be glued to their
sets to watch what is annually
the biggest sporting event of
the year — the Super Bowl, the
only professional sports cham
pionship deemed important
enough to use Roman numer
als in its title.
I barely managed to escape
the crush of the press core as
they gathered Sunday evening
at LAX in anticipation of the
arrival of the Cowboys and
Hills. With large red banners
adorning the airport, journal
ists staked out their positions
early so they could ask that
ever-relevant question that t he
public is dying to hear the
answer to — "How does it feel
to get off the plane?"
Everything about the Super
Bowl is Super: Super Advertis
ing, Super Pregame, Super
Player Introductions, Super
Halftime Show, Superfans
(hey wait! where's Da' Bears?
well, maybe not the Superfans,
but team diehards nonethe
less), Super Scalpers and, as if
Los Angeles did not have
enough, Super Traffic.
Accompanying the triumvi
rate of eat, drink and be merry
on Super Sunday every year
unfortunately has evolved a
tradition that is pointless: the
marathon Super Bowl pregame
show. This is a program that
previews the program that you
are about to see, which in and
of itself takes at least three
hours to watch. The pregame
show is a spectacle whose run
ning time seems longer than
"Dances With Wolves" and
"JFK" combined, and which
says virtually nothing.
This year, NBC is trying to
entice innocent civilians into
watching its two-and-a-half
hour block by way of promot
ing it as a show featuring half

entertainment, half football.
Don't hold your breath. The
show will open with entertain
ment, with "NFL Live" host
Bob Costas overseeing a mas
sive tailgate party outside the
Rose Bowl featuring various
performers, including (.for
those who missed hearing their
music every five minutes last
week) Fleetwood Mac. The
later portion of the show will
be devoted to analyzing ad
nauseam every conceivable
matchup between Dallas and
Buffalo, from the quarterbacks
to the defense to the team uni
forms to the cheerleaders.
As an added bonus, for
those who simply could not
wait until halftime, there will
be a segment previewing
Michael Jackson's halftime
show. NBC does not seem to
realize that hardly anyone
watches the halftime show.
People are usually reloading
their food plates, using the
restroom, analyzing their
chances to win the betting
pool, or perhaps playing a
quick game of touch football
outside, weather permitting.
Why, then, would people want
to see footage of the Gloved
One preparing for the inter
mission show?
NBC, though, apparently has
some former couch potatoes in
its brass, because the network
decided to cut the length of the
halftime show by 12 minutes, so
the break will only last 22 min
utes in contrast to the 34-
minute pause of a year ago. This
was in part due to the fact that
Fox network successfully coun
terprogrammed an episode of
"In Living Color" at halftime
last year.
But do not feel sorry for
NBC. Even though the halftime
show will be shorter, the net
work still has the same amount
of advertising spots to sell. A 30-
second spot during the game or
halftime costs a cool $900,000.
Plus, Lay's potato chips is spon
soring the halftime perfor
mance, and the snack company
paid a nice sum for that honor.
And what would a Super
Bowl be without the video ad
extravaganza provided by Bud
weiser? Ready or not, Bud Bowl
V is upon us.
As we focus our attention to
Pasadena for Super Bowl
XXVII, yet another title match
that probably will not live up to
all the hype provided in the two
weeks before the game, take
solace in the fact that if the
game is lousy, 750 million peo
ple in 60 countries will have
wasted their time watching also.

David Schwartz will he
slumped in front of the televi
sion this Sunday with junk
food in hand, just like everyone
else.
