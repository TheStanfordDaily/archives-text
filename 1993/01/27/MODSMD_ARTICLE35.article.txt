### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Telling a story from four
women's points of view was the
hardest part of writing the best
selling "Waiting to Exhale,"
author Terry McMillan told her
audience last night in Branner
Hall.
"I wanted to try to create four
women who would tick to differ
ent beats, but would still end up
being friends," she said.
Horace Porter, coordinator
for the African and Afro-Ameri
can Studies Program, intro
duced McMillan by saying, "She
has become a kind of legendary
figure throughout the coun
try."
After reading aloud a chapter
from her book, McMillan answered
questions from the ethnically
diverse crowd of about 350 for
more than an hour.
"When you've finished telling
a story, you have experienced
everything that the characters in
the book felt," she said, explain
ing her state of mind after writing
the book.

'At least 70 percent
of the young men in
my family are either
incarcerated or dead
from drugs.'
— Terry McMillan

"There is a definite bond that
forms between author and char
acters," McMillan said, adding
that they were very much a reflec
tion of her own life.
In response to a question about
her recent success, she seemed
less enthusiastic. "Everybody
wants something from you," she
said. "I tell stories. And if people
can identify with some of them,
all the better.
"I am just giving things some
time to settle down. Right now, all
of this stuff is almost unreal."
McMillan, who grew up in a
small, predominantly white
town in Michigan, also spoke
about the problems in today's

cities. "I think a lot of the
young people today are under
extreme pressure. This is a very
scary time."
Personal experience has given
her an understanding of the prob
lem's scale. "At least 70 percent of
the young men in my family are
either incarcerated or dead from
drugs," she said.
Finally, McMillan gave tips to
future writers in the audience —
"Read and write everything you
can get your hands on and take a
writing workshop."
Though she admitted that she
was "very lucky" to get her first
book published, McMillan encour
aged potential writers to submit
books to publishers.
Her other works include the
book "The Disappearing Acts"
and "Breaking Ice," a journal of
contemporary African-American
Fiction.
The movie rights for "Waiting
to Exhale" have been sold to 20th
Century Fox, but McMillan
expressed doubt about the
prospects for the movie.
"This stuff takes forever," she
said. "Just like my check."
