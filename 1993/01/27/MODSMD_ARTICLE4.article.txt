# For modern knights and damsels, love is no fairy tale
## 
### Kris McNeil Staff writer 
Knights on horseback . . . damsels in
distress . . . soldiers rescuing fair maidens
and riding happily off into the sunset.
Certainly such chivalrous images re
main today only in fairy tales, but is all
chivalry dead? As steps have been made
toward achieving equal treatment be
tween men and women, society has been
left a little confused as to what's polite and
what's offensive.
Should women ask men out? Who pays
on a date? Should men open doors for
women? Thoughtfulness or sexism? Often
it's the most minor, seemingly insignifi
cant details which manage to mystify men
and women both.
"I don't ever think about it, but if they

open the door in front of me and then just
walk through it, I am kind of offended,"
said sophomore Megan Williams.
"I think it's awesome, totally romantic
when they're behind you and they run up
to open the door for you, when they make a
big deal about it I think that's adorable,"
said sophomore Viv Hsy. "I like it a lot —
all theswept-off-your-feet romantic stuff."
A catch-22 situation
Many men claim to feel frustrated and
trapped by what they think is a catch-22
situation. If they don't help women with
doors or carrying heavy things and let
them pay for themselves, they risk being
called inconsiderate or cheap. But if they
try to be gentlemanly, they may be ac
cused of being sexist.
"When someone makes a big deal out of

it, then they're just being silly," said
freshman Michael Keinath. "It's just out
of politeness and being considerate."
Being from the South, he added, "a lot of
my friends from high school went |to col
lege! where people don't do those things,
and some of them really miss it."
Sophomore Terry Cussen, pointed out
that acts considered "chivalrous" may
just be considerate, regardless of gender.
"If someone's obviously overloaded
with things, it doesn't really matter if
they're a man or a woman, I would just try
to help them out," said Cussen.
"As longas it's done out of consideration
and not because 'she's a woman and she
ain't do things for herself,' then it's fine,"
said Dominique Blom, a senior anthropolo
gy major with a concentration in feminist
studies. "But in any relationship there has

to be that respect for both people, so that
it's not just assumed that the woman
should go first for some bizarre reason.
Both people need to help each other."
Who pays?
The question of who pays on a date has
the potential to create some awkward situ
ations. Everyone has their own little for
mula for determining when they pay and
when it's the other person's responsibility.
"If I ask them out, then I assume I pay.
If they ask me out, then it's kind of a weird
situation. I'd go there expecting to pay,
but if she stops me I guess I'd let her," said
freshman Chris Ramsborg.
"If I asked him out then I would as
sume that I was paying, but I guess I
would hope that he would at least offer to
pay for his half. I would be a little hurt if

he didn't," said Williams.
"I always offer when someone asks me
out, so I guess I would expect them to
offer. I guess I think it's kind of silly to de
cide who pays based on who asks who out,
and kind of archaic to assume that the
person who asks should automatically pay
for everything," said junior Liz Gorgue.
Flip-flopping feminists
Defining oneself as a feminist can also
complicate the situation, since the term
carries different meanings for different
people. Some individuals have expressed
resentment at women who call them
selves feminists but act in ways they con
sider hypocritical —expecting men to al
ways pay for dates or to support them fi-
nancially while arguing that
women need to be more indepen
dent, for example.
"They're flipping on the issue.
It's fine if they really are feminists,
but they can't have it both ways,"
Robinson said. "You can't just
choose one situation to be a femi
nist and then be a traditionalist
some other time, while expecting a
guy to just sit there and take it."
I think people shouldn't flip
flop," Blom said. "But I don't think
there's any one definition of what a
feminist is, each person can define
it in their own way."
But others said a little flip
flopping was understandable.
"I think you can have a femi
nist view about the workplace —
believing that women should be
paid and treated equally — but if
you also enjoy being wined and
dined I think that's okay," said
freshman Sam Brasch.
"But if someone gets upset

when you open the door for them
and then turns around and
expects you to buy them dinner,
then that's a problem."
Williams added that although
these little details are important,
there are many things in relation
ships which are far more signifi
cant than who opens the door and
who pays. "They've got the open
ing-door thing down fine, it's just
what happens after they open it
that needs some work."

For the record

Due to an editing error, an arti
cle in yesterday's Daily implied that
the September 1982 Sabra and
Shatila massacres were acts of
Israeli soldiers. While the speaker,
Barbara Lubin, attributed respon
sibility for the massacre to Israel,
the acts themselves were actually
committed by Phalangist soldiers,
who were permitted to enter the
camps by the Israeli army. This was
confirmed by Israel's Commission
of Inquiry into the Events at the
Refugee Camps in Beiruit 1983.
