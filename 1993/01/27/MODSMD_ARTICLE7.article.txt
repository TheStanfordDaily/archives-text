# Mapping mankind
## Genome project ambitious, expensive 
### Jennifer Cho Troy Parkins Staff writers 
Generations have followed the
stars, gazed into crystal balls, and
sat chanting around Ouija boards
— just to learn how their children
will turn out. A few years from
now a single visit to the doctor and
a single blood test could provide
people with a map of their future,
relegating all those legends and
toys to the trash heap.
What will enable this to happen
is the Human Genome Project.
This massive international under
taking, initiated four years ago, will
provide scientists with a blueprint
of what makes a human being.
The international project com
bines the efforts of researchers in
Europe, Japan and the United
States. In the United States, re
search is being conducted in both
private laboratories and govern
ment-funded research centers.
With an original estimate of
three billion dollars to complete
the project over a course of fifteen
years, Congress currently budgets
100 million dollars a year towards
this endeavor.
That slippery genome
What, exactly, is all this money
being spent on, and why?
The "genome" is considered to
be the collection of all genes in the

body. Presently, information con
tained within the genome is used
by doctors and scientists to diag
nose diseases such as sickle-cell
anemia and cystic fibrosis. After
the completion of the project, doc
tors may be able to predict a per
son's propensity for cancer, heart
disease and a number of other po
tentially deadly plagues.
According to Prof, of Genetics
David Botstein, four goals emerged
from scientists' lengthy discus
sions about the project.
The first goal is to obtain a ge
netic map of the chromosomes.
This map indicates the relative po
sitions of various genetic units in
the genome.
The second goal lies in creating
a more detailed physical map of
the genome, which breaks down a
genetic unit into sections that
code for specific proteins. Scien
tists construct this map by pulling
out a specific gene within a unit
and seeing what effect their action
has on the offspring.
The physical map will allow
doctors to find defects in particu
lar genes and discover drugs to fix
the problem, said Botstein's part
ner Ronald Davis, Prof, of Bio
chemistry and Genetics.
The third goal is to get the ac
tual sequence of the genome. The
genes are made up of DNA, which
contains four nitrogenous bases:
adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine
(T), cytosine (C).
The sequences of bases code for
protein production, and these
sequences are different in every
gene. Researchers eventually hope
to determine the specific sequence
for entire genome.
Finally, project scientists hope to
figure out some means for under
standing what the sequences actu
ally mean. In effect, they hope to
learn how to "translate" sequences
into specific biochemical functions.
Such knowledge is gained by
manipulating the genes of simple
organisms, such as yeast, and not
ing the effects.
Because experimentation on
humans is often subject to contro
versy, many scientists, like Botstein
and Davis, prefer to use these sim
pler organisms.
However, laboratories involved
in sequencing the actual human
genome must use human DNA.
Most of these laboratories operate
on the initial assumption that the
DNA used comes from one individ
ual. In reality, according to Bot
stein, "They take the DNA from
wherever they can get it — wherev
er is most convenient." These
diverse sources range from donated
tumor cells to blood test samples.
Responding to criticism
The project has been criticized
from many sources, from both a
financial and ethical standpoint.
According to Davis, although
100 million dollars may sound like
a ridiculously large amount of
money, research is very expensive.

Much of the costs includes the
development of new sequencing
technology.
Currently, "One student can
sequence between 200 and 300
bases a day," Biology Prof. Robert
Simoni, department chairman,
said. However, this is inefficient
and expensive, because "for this
project we need to do 1,000 to
10,000 bases at a time. This can be
accomplished b} r automated sys
tems."
Computers keep track of isolat
ed genes and are important for cat
egorization and analysis of base
sequences. As computer sequenc
ing techniques are refined, the cost
of the project will continue to drop,
Simoni added.
Comparing this project to the
space program in the 19605, Davis
argued that the government should
spend millions of dollars on the pro
ject, in order for the United States
to maintain a competitive edge in
the international marketplace.
Money used to develop sequenc
ing technology is well spent, Davis
said. He used the discovery of the
cystic fibrosis gene as an example.
While it originally took ten years
and cost between $20 and $200 mil
lion to find the gene, he estimated
that the same task could be accom
plished today by just one graduate
student. "Without these technolog
ical developments, it could take the
same amount of time to find the
next lethal gene," he said.
He attributed the incredible
amount of time devoted to finding
the cystic fibrosis gene to the fact
that researchers had virtually no
idea where to start looking for it.
With 20 to 30 possible candidates or
suspect genes, a scientist could
devote several years of research
simply to find that it was the
"wrong" gene in the first place, and

the work would have to start all
over again.
With the development of a
genetic map, however, scientists
can initiate a search with relative
certainty that the gene they are
looking for is located within a par
ticular region.
Recognizing the value of estab
lishing usable genetic maps of
human chromosomes, scientists
have established several mapping
centers, a process that has been
accelerated with the initiation of
the genome project.
Ethical quandaries

As techniques grow more effi
cient, and completion of the
genome project draws closer,
numerous moral and ethical
questions keep arising. Should
this information be available to
insurance companies? Should

people be able to make
"designer" babies? If a
detrimental gene, such as
a propensity for alco-

holism, is located in a
zygote, should it be

altered?
Other concerns
are raised by
members of
the scien-

tific
community.

Commenting on
the controversy surrounding the
project when it was first proposed,
Botstein, a member of the Human
Genome Advisory Committee, said,
"There was a great concern that if
we set up a goal to sequence the

human
genome
by a specified
date, the pro
ject could become
a bureaucratic and
mindless endeavor."
In order to make tht
project more "palatable"
to scientists, the Advi
sory committee was
organized and has
since been
merged
with

the
Nation
al Insti
tutes of Health
Advisory Coun
cil. The commit
tee, composed of sci
entists and lay people
who represent a cross
section of the community,
oversees that money is spent
in a "scientifically responsible
way."
"If research becomes impracti
cal, then the project should be
abandoned," Botstein said. "A lot of
money gets wasted when it is just a
bureaucratic operation."
The dangers of bureaucracy
aside, the genome project does
involve cooperation between gov
ernment and the scientific commu
nity. When the project finally
reaches completion, it will change
the way government views research
and the face of medicine itself.
Not to mention reducing the
answer to the philosophical ques
tion "What is man?" to several
hundred volumes of sequenced
bases.

bines the efforts of researchers in
Europe, Japan and the United
States. In the United States, re
search is being conducted in both
private laboratories and govern
ment-funded research centers.
With an original estimate of
three billion dollars to complete
the project over a course of fifteen
years, Congress currently budgets
100 million dollars a year towards
this endeavor.
That slippery genome
What, exactly, is all this money
being spent on, and why?
The "genome" is considered to
be the collection of all genes in the

body. Presently, information con
tained within the genome is used
by doctors and scientists to diag
nose diseases such as sickle-cell
anemia and cystic fibrosis. After
the completion of the project, doc
tors may be able to predict a per
son's propensity for cancer, heart
disease and a number of other po
tentially deadly plagues.
According to Prof, of Genetics
David Botstein, four goals emerged
from scientists' lengthy discus
sions about the project.
The first goal is to obtain a ge
netic map of the chromosomes.
This map indicates the relative po
sitions of various genetic units in
the genome.
The second goal lies in creating
a more detailed physical map of
the genome, which breaks down a
genetic unit into sections that
code for specific proteins. Scien
tists construct this map by pulling
out a specific gene within a unit
and seeing what effect their action
has on the offspring.
The physical map will allow
doctors to find defects in particu
lar genes and discover drugs to fix
the problem, said Botstein's part
ner Ronald Davis, Prof, of Bio
chemistry and Genetics.
The third goal is to get the ac
tual sequence of the genome. The
genes are made up of DNA, which
contains four nitrogenous bases:
adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine
(T), cytosine (C).
The sequences of bases code for
protein production, and these
sequences are different in every
gene. Researchers eventually hope
to determine the specific sequence
for entire genome.
Finally, project scientists hope to
figure out some means for under
standing what the sequences actu
ally mean. In effect, they hope to
learn how to "translate" sequences
into specific biochemical functions.
Such knowledge is gained by
manipulating the genes of simple
organisms, such as yeast, and not
ing the effects.
Because experimentation on
humans is often subject to contro
versy, many scientists, like Botstein
and Davis, prefer to use these sim
pler organisms.
However, laboratories involved
in sequencing the actual human
genome must use human DNA.
Most of these laboratories operate
on the initial assumption that the
DNA used comes from one individ
ual. In reality, according to Bot
stein, "They take the DNA from
wherever they can get it — wherev
er is most convenient." These
diverse sources range from donated
tumor cells to blood test samples.
Responding to criticism
The project has been criticized
from many sources, from both a
financial and ethical standpoint.
According to Davis, although
100 million dollars may sound like
a ridiculously large amount of
money, research is very expensive.

Much of the costs includes the
development of new sequencing
technology.
Currently, "One student can
sequence between 200 and 300
bases a day," Biology Prof. Robert
Simoni, department chairman,
said. However, this is inefficient
and expensive, because "for this
project we need to do 1,000 to
10,000 bases at a time. This can be
accomplished b} r automated sys
tems."
Computers keep track of isolat
ed genes and are important for cat
egorization and analysis of base
sequences. As computer sequenc
ing techniques are refined, the cost
of the project will continue to drop,
Simoni added.
Comparing this project to the
space program in the 19605, Davis
argued that the government should
spend millions of dollars on the pro
ject, in order for the United States
to maintain a competitive edge in
the international marketplace.
Money used to develop sequenc
ing technology is well spent, Davis
said. He used the discovery of the
cystic fibrosis gene as an example.
While it originally took ten years
and cost between $20 and $200 mil
lion to find the gene, he estimated
that the same task could be accom
plished today by just one graduate
student. "Without these technolog
ical developments, it could take the
same amount of time to find the
next lethal gene," he said.
He attributed the incredible
amount of time devoted to finding
the cystic fibrosis gene to the fact
that researchers had virtually no
idea where to start looking for it.
With 20 to 30 possible candidates or
suspect genes, a scientist could
devote several years of research
simply to find that it was the
"wrong" gene in the first place, and

the work would have to start all
over again.
With the development of a
genetic map, however, scientists
can initiate a search with relative
certainty that the gene they are
looking for is located within a par
ticular region.
Recognizing the value of estab
lishing usable genetic maps of
human chromosomes, scientists
have established several mapping
centers, a process that has been
accelerated with the initiation of
the genome project.
Ethical quandaries

As techniques grow more effi
cient, and completion of the
genome project draws closer,
numerous moral and ethical
questions keep arising. Should
this information be available to
insurance companies? Should

people be able to make
"designer" babies? If a
detrimental gene, such as
a propensity for alco-

holism, is located in a
zygote, should it be

altered?
Other concerns
are raised by
members of
the scien-

tific
community.

Commenting on
the controversy surrounding the
project when it was first proposed,
Botstein, a member of the Human
Genome Advisory Committee, said,
"There was a great concern that if
we set up a goal to sequence the

human
genome
by a specified
date, the pro
ject could become
a bureaucratic and
mindless endeavor."
In order to make tht
project more "palatable"
to scientists, the Advi
sory committee was
organized and has
since been
merged
with

the
Nation
al Insti
tutes of Health
Advisory Coun
cil. The commit
tee, composed of sci
entists and lay people
who represent a cross
section of the community,
oversees that money is spent
in a "scientifically responsible
way."
"If research becomes impracti
cal, then the project should be
abandoned," Botstein said. "A lot of
money gets wasted when it is just a
bureaucratic operation."
The dangers of bureaucracy
aside, the genome project does
involve cooperation between gov
ernment and the scientific commu
nity. When the project finally
reaches completion, it will change
the way government views research
and the face of medicine itself.
Not to mention reducing the
answer to the philosophical ques
tion "What is man?" to several
hundred volumes of sequenced
bases.

Generations have followed the
stars, gazed into crystal balls, and
sat chanting around Ouija boards
— just to learn how their children
will turn out. A few years from
now a single visit to the doctor and
a single blood test could provide
people with a map of their future,
relegating all those legends and
toys to the trash heap.
What will enable this to happen
is the Human Genome Project.
This massive international under
