# Mapping mankind
## Genome project ambitious, expensive

Generations have followed the
stars, gazed into crystal balls, and
sat chanting around Ouija boards
â€” just to learn how their children
will turn out. A few years from
now a single visit to the doctor and
a single blood test could provide
people with a map of their future,
relegating all those legends and
toys to the trash heap.
What will enable this to happen
is the Human Genome Project.
This massive international under
taking, initiated four years ago, will
provide scientists with a blueprint
of what makes a human being.
The international project com
bines the efforts of researchers in
Europe, Japan and the United
States. In the United States, re
search is being conducted in both
private laboratories and govern
ment-funded research centers.
With an original estimate of
three billion dollars to complete
the project over a course of fifteen
years, Congress currently budgets
100 million dollars a year towards
this endeavor.
That slippery genome
What, exactly, is all this money
being spent on, and why?
The "genome" is considered to
be the collection of all genes in the

body. Presently, information con
tained within the genome is used
by doctors and scientists to diag
nose diseases such as sickle-cell
anemia and cystic fibrosis. After
the completion of the project, doc
tors may be able to predict a per
son's propensity for cancer, heart
disease and a number of other po
tentially deadly plagues.
According to Prof, of Genetics
David Botstein, four goals emerged
from scientists' lengthy discus
sions about the project.
The first goal is to obtain a ge
netic map of the chromosomes.
This map indicates the relative po
sitions of various genetic units in
the genome.
The second goal lies in creating
a more detailed physical map of
the genome, which breaks down a
genetic unit into sections that
code for specific proteins. Scien
tists construct this map by pulling
out a specific gene within a unit
and seeing what effect their action
has on the offspring.
The physical map will allow
doctors to find defects in particu
lar genes and discover drugs to fix
the problem, said Botstein's part
ner Ronald Davis, Prof, of Bio
chemistry and Genetics.
The third goal is to get the ac
tual sequence of the genome. The
genes are made up of DNA, which
