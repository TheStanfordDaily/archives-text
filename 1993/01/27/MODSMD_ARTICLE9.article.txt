# When getting into Stanford was a weighty matter

Thick packet or thin rejection notice?
Most Stanford students can relate to
the 13,000 high school students now anx
iously awaiting their answers from the
admissions office. We've all had to deal
with it: the essay questions, the note to
the future roommate, the "anything else
we should know" section. . .
Applying to Stanford wasn't always
the way it is now, though. As recently as
eight years ago, applicants were asked
their height and weight. There even was
a space on the application to attach a pho
tograph with the disclaimer, "We obvi
ously do not use pictures for selection
purposes."
"We had to ask ourselves what we
were doing with these questions," said
Associate Dean of Admissions John Bun
nell, who joined the Office of Undergrad

uate Admissions in 1963. The admissions
officers realized that these parts of the
application really served no productive
purpose, he said. "We didn't want to
unconsciously (form al bias [toward! the
applicants."
Over the past 30 years or so, changes
in the application process have centered
around issues of equity.
When Bunnell first arrived, the pro
cess used to be more of an "old boy net
work," he said. The number of applicants
wasn't so large, and admissions officers
and high school counselors had more
of a personal relationship. Sometimes an
admit could almost be guaranteed with "a
handshake and a quick look at the tran
script" for top students, he said.
Despite the increased volume and thus
workload for the admissions office these
days, Bunnell said he welcomes the
change. "It's a mixed blessing, but we
bring it on ourselves" by recruiting stu

dents from around the world. "We want
it to be busy."
Stanford's applicant pool grew when
Rick Snyder, the dean of admissions of
the mid-'7os, "pioneered" Stanford's
need-blind admissions policy, which
encourages students from lower-income
classes to apply. Around this time, the
admissions office also started to become
"much more concerned with diversity,"
Bunnell said.
Twenty years ago there were "very few
people of color," according to Bunnell.
The affirmative action movement in the
late '60s and early '70s encouraged more
people to apply.
Around the mid-'7os, the admissions
officers started to take into account other
important factors, such as the fact that
some students need to work to help out
their families. Such students are certainly
different than the ones who "can travel to
Europe every summer," Bunnell said.

"What's the difference between a 3.8
student and a 3.6 student?" asked Bun
nell. "If an applicant has a job, that 3.6
looks awfully good." Such circumstances
weren't considered until recently. "You
get a good feeling when you can give
deserving students an opportunity," he
said.
Sophomore Emma Luevano, who is
Hispanic, helps bring these students to
Stanford. She works for the admissions
office's ambassador program. Primarily
during the summer, she goes to high
schools in her area to help recruit black
and Hispanic students. While the focus is
on applying to Stanford, "I think the
main goal is to get them to apply (to any
school), period," Luevano said.
Luevano fully supports the admissions
office's attempt to create a racially
diverse student body. "I really like the
way Stanford tries to take into account
where [studentsl are coming from and

what obstacles they had to face."
She does think, however, that affirma
tive action should be focused more on
socio-economic class. Luevano said while
she can understand how people might be
opposed to affirmative action, she is in
favor of it."The way society works today,
you need to have it," she said.
Some, such as sophomore Todd Elder,
question the role of affirmative action. "If
admissions is need-blind,why wouldn't it
be color-blind too?" he asked."They
should ignore color and look at socio-eco
nomic background."
Admissions officers have also recently
begun admitting more students from out
side California. In the past, 60 percent of
the admitted students were from the
Golden State. Now 60 percent are from
out of state. Over the last 20 years, Stan
ford has evolved into an "international
school with an international reputation,"
said Bunnell.
