# An ancient art for modern masses
## John Chuck has taught tai chi to over 1,000 pupils

Legend has it that so coveted
was the martial art of tai chi in
Ching Dynasty China that a schol
ar named Yang Lu Zhan dressed
up as a crippled beggar and swept
the streets daily, feigning to be
mute so as to gain the sympathy of
tai chi masters.
Dressed for five years in this
garb, Yang, who was to become
the father of modern tai chi, spent
five years gleaning the tricks and
techniques of a martial art so
closely guarded that even fathers
were reluctant to teach it to their
children.
Two-hundred years later, Yang
would only have had to stroll into
Roble on a Wednesday evening to
find tai chi master John Chuck
openly instructing an eager flock
of Stanford students, demonstrat
ing the movements that have en
dured for 15 centuries.
"Tai chi was originally devel
oped in the Sung Dynasty by a
Taoist priest for the purposes of
self defense," explains Chuck, who
has taught the class at Stanford for
four years. "Gradually it has be
come more of a form of exercise."
For those that have never prac
ticed the art before, tai chi seems
like an unlikely exercise, much
less a self-defense technique. The
slow, flowing movements with
tempered breath appear an odd
interpretive dance rather than a
martial art. No foot-stomping,
panting or hollering here.
As the class progresses howev
er, and a few groans are heard
from students during the stretch
ing, it becomes clear that this is
no patty-cake exercise. Tai chi

In front of the mirrored walls in Roble gym, tai chi instructor John Chuck demonstrates some of the
moves that have taken him years to perfect. "Everyone's into it. It's become international," he said
of the centuries-old martial art.


Adept with both
the sword and
three-sectioned
stick, the wiry
fortyish instructor
can do a backflip
from a stand-still.
