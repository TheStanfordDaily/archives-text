# An ancient art for modern masses
## John Chuck has taught tai chi to over 1,000 pupils 
### Carrie Chang Editorial staff 
Legend has it that so coveted
was the martial art of tai chi in
Ching Dynasty China that a schol
ar named Yang Lu Zhan dressed
up as a crippled beggar and swept
the streets daily, feigning to be
mute so as to gain the sympathy of
tai chi masters.
Dressed for five years in this
garb, Yang, who was to become
the father of modern tai chi, spent
five years gleaning the tricks and
techniques of a martial art so
closely guarded that even fathers
were reluctant to teach it to their
children.
Two-hundred years later, Yang
would only have had to stroll into
Roble on a Wednesday evening to
find tai chi master John Chuck
openly instructing an eager flock
of Stanford students, demonstrat
ing the movements that have en
dured for 15 centuries.
"Tai chi was originally devel
oped in the Sung Dynasty by a
Taoist priest for the purposes of
self defense," explains Chuck, who
has taught the class at Stanford for
four years. "Gradually it has be
come more of a form of exercise."
For those that have never prac
ticed the art before, tai chi seems
like an unlikely exercise, much
less a self-defense technique. The
slow, flowing movements with
tempered breath appear an odd
interpretive dance rather than a
martial art. No foot-stomping,
panting or hollering here.
As the class progresses howev
er, and a few groans are heard
from students during the stretch
ing, it becomes clear that this is
no patty-cake exercise. Tai chi

In front of the mirrored walls in Roble gym, tai chi instructor John Chuck demonstrates some of the
moves that have taken him years to perfect. "Everyone's into it. It's become international," he said
of the centuries-old martial art.

may seem like an aesthetically
pleasing meditative motion, a
kind of wading through a water
less ocean, but also it demands
fierce agility, concentration and
intensity of motion that has
become second-nature to Chuck,
who began learning the martial
art from his father when he was
12.
Rather than guarding family
secrets, Chuck, who emigrated
from China in 1962, has since
proffered his tai chi instruction to
over 1,000 pupils in the Bay Area,
half of whom have been Stanford
students.
"It was almost natural for me
to be in the martial arts field,"
said Chuck, an electrical engineer
who is also learned in wu shu and
kung-fu.
In addition to teaching at Stan
ford, Chuck runs his own martial
arts studio in Sunnyvale and has
traveled back to China to help
train athletes for international
competitions.
"A lot of times I hear about a
tai chi performance by a very
famous person who has been in
international competition. I come
in and sqy 'Hey John, every hear
of this person?' " said junior Tony
Tong, a teaching assistant of the
class who has studied with Chuck
for several years. "It usually
turns out that John taught that
person. . . it all comes back to
him."

Familiar with various forms
of martial arts, Chuck knows the
self-defense purposes of tai chi
well, and is not someone you
would want to pick a fight with.
Adept with both the sword and
three-sectioned stick, the wiry
fortyish instructor can do a
backflip from a stand-still. But
rather than having a tough
demeanor, Chuck seems mild
mannered and patient as an
instructor.
"Your body becomes in-tuned
with the mind, and you become
more sensitive to movement or
things coming at you, so if some
one is striking at you, you are
more likely to sense it,"says
Chuck, who found that tai chi
came in handy during the fights
he had when he was younger.
"Since then I've become more
rational," he adds, laughing. "It
helps my character and also
brings up my confidence in life
because I know that I can defend
myself I can walk tall, and I have
good health."
Accounts of tai chi's salubri
ous effects are stories in them
selves, with claims of curing can
cer and ulcers. Chuck is dubious
about these claims, but affirms
the health benefits of tai chi:
"You increase your lung capacity.
You relax.
The movement will help mas
sage your external organs. The
movements become more fluid
and you feel more tranquil. At
the same time it gives you enough
intensity to up your heart rate
because you move so slow and
you keep your stance so low."

Captured by almost every
PBS documentary on China, the
vision of hundreds of Chinese
practicing the art of tai chi in the
morning attests to its populari
ty. "Everyone can learn. You can
just walk out on the street and
follow them," describes Chuck,
who went back to visit China in
1981 and has delighted in seeing
the art spread to other coun
tries.
"Everyone's into it. It's
become more international. You
can actually look up the word 'wu
shu,' in Webster's now," he adds
excitedly. "Wu shu," a more con
temporary exercise which com
bines some of the techniques of
tai chi with other martial arts, is a
term actually coined by Chuck
and one of his friends.
Besides demonstrating his
technique to students, Chuck
shares the wealth of folklore
which surrounds the martial art,
telling tales of old masters who
supposedly could poke the pres
sure points on people in such a
way as to make them stay still as
if frozen.
"People say that one of the old
masters was so good at tai chi
that when a bird flew down on his
hand he could make the bird stay
on his hand forever. He had such
a sensitive hand that every time
the bird tried to push off, he
could feel it and react to the bird
so it couldn't fly. He was so sensi
tive it seemed like the bird was
stuck to his hand," Chuck
relates, and smiles, musing, "I've
never seen it happen, but who
knows?"

were reluctant to teach it to their
children.
Two-hundred years later, Yang
would only have had to stroll into
Roble on a Wednesday evening to
find tai chi master John Chuck
openly instructing an eager flock
of Stanford students, demonstrat
ing the movements that have en
dured for 15 centuries.
"Tai chi was originally devel
oped in the Sung Dynasty by a
Taoist priest for the purposes of
self defense," explains Chuck, who
has taught the class at Stanford for
four years. "Gradually it has be
come more of a form of exercise."
For those that have never prac
ticed the art before, tai chi seems
like an unlikely exercise, much
less a self-defense technique. The
slow, flowing movements with
tempered breath appear an odd
interpretive dance rather than a
martial art. No foot-stomping,
panting or hollering here.
As the class progresses howev
er, and a few groans are heard
from students during the stretch
ing, it becomes clear that this is
no patty-cake exercise. Tai chi

In front of the mirrored walls in Roble gym, tai chi instructor John Chuck demonstrates some of the
moves that have taken him years to perfect. "Everyone's into it. It's become international," he said
of the centuries-old martial art.


Adept with both
the sword and
three-sectioned
stick, the wiry
fortyish instructor
can do a backflip
from a stand-still.
may seem like an aesthetically
pleasing meditative motion, a
kind of wading through a water
less ocean, but also it demands
fierce agility, concentration and
intensity of motion that has
become second-nature to Chuck,
who began learning the martial
art from his father when he was
12.
Rather than guarding family
secrets, Chuck, who emigrated
from China in 1962, has since
proffered his tai chi instruction to
over 1,000 pupils in the Bay Area,
half of whom have been Stanford
students.
"It was almost natural for me
to be in the martial arts field,"
said Chuck, an electrical engineer
who is also learned in wu shu and
kung-fu.
In addition to teaching at Stan
ford, Chuck runs his own martial
arts studio in Sunnyvale and has
traveled back to China to help
train athletes for international
competitions.
"A lot of times I hear about a
tai chi performance by a very
famous person who has been in
international competition. I come
in and sqy 'Hey John, every hear
of this person?' " said junior Tony
Tong, a teaching assistant of the
class who has studied with Chuck
for several years. "It usually
turns out that John taught that
person. . . it all comes back to
him."

Familiar with various forms
of martial arts, Chuck knows the
self-defense purposes of tai chi
well, and is not someone you
would want to pick a fight with.
Adept with both the sword and
three-sectioned stick, the wiry
fortyish instructor can do a
backflip from a stand-still. But
rather than having a tough
demeanor, Chuck seems mild
mannered and patient as an
instructor.
"Your body becomes in-tuned
with the mind, and you become
more sensitive to movement or
things coming at you, so if some
one is striking at you, you are
more likely to sense it,"says
Chuck, who found that tai chi
came in handy during the fights
he had when he was younger.
"Since then I've become more
rational," he adds, laughing. "It
helps my character and also
brings up my confidence in life
because I know that I can defend
myself I can walk tall, and I have
good health."
Accounts of tai chi's salubri
ous effects are stories in them
selves, with claims of curing can
cer and ulcers. Chuck is dubious
about these claims, but affirms
the health benefits of tai chi:
"You increase your lung capacity.
You relax.
The movement will help mas
sage your external organs. The
movements become more fluid
and you feel more tranquil. At
the same time it gives you enough
intensity to up your heart rate
because you move so slow and
you keep your stance so low."

Captured by almost every
PBS documentary on China, the
vision of hundreds of Chinese
practicing the art of tai chi in the
morning attests to its populari
ty. "Everyone can learn. You can
just walk out on the street and
follow them," describes Chuck,
who went back to visit China in
1981 and has delighted in seeing
the art spread to other coun
tries.
"Everyone's into it. It's
become more international. You
can actually look up the word 'wu
shu,' in Webster's now," he adds
excitedly. "Wu shu," a more con
temporary exercise which com
bines some of the techniques of
tai chi with other martial arts, is a
term actually coined by Chuck
and one of his friends.
Besides demonstrating his
technique to students, Chuck
shares the wealth of folklore
which surrounds the martial art,
telling tales of old masters who
supposedly could poke the pres
sure points on people in such a
way as to make them stay still as
if frozen.
"People say that one of the old
masters was so good at tai chi
that when a bird flew down on his
hand he could make the bird stay
on his hand forever. He had such
a sensitive hand that every time
the bird tried to push off, he
could feel it and react to the bird
so it couldn't fly. He was so sensi
tive it seemed like the bird was
stuck to his hand," Chuck
relates, and smiles, musing, "I've
never seen it happen, but who
knows?"
Legend has it that so coveted
was the martial art of tai chi in
Ching Dynasty China that a schol
ar named Yang Lu Zhan dressed
up as a crippled beggar and swept
the streets daily, feigning to be
mute so as to gain the sympathy of
tai chi masters.
Dressed for five years in this
garb, Yang, who was to become
the father of modern tai chi, spent
five years gleaning the tricks and
techniques of a martial art so
closely guarded that even fathers
were reluctant to teach it to their
children.
Two-hundred years later, Yang
would only have had to stroll into
Roble on a Wednesday evening to
find tai chi master John Chuck
