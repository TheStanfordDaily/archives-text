## U.N. 'dragging its feet' in Somalia 
### 
MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — U.S.
special envoy Robert B. Oakley accused
the United Nations yesterday of "drag
ging its feet" on taking over military com
mand in Somalia from the United States.
He said the United States and other
nations were pressing U.N. Secretary-
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to name
a respected independent mediator to
help Somalia's warring factions on the
road to peace.
"There's a quiet, collective push to
get Mr. Boutros-Ghali to do for Somalia
what he seems to be comfortable with in
Bosnia," said Oakley.
Boutros-Ghali appointed former U.S.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance last
August to seek a negotiated settlement
to the war in Bosnia. Vance is working
alongside Lord Owen, a former British
foreign secretary who is the European
Community mediator.

"It doesn't have to be Vance and
Owen, but someone of independent
stature," Oakley said in an interview.
"It would make the United Nations a lot
stronger."
The United Nations has had two spe
cial envoys to Somalia, a post currently
held by Ismat Kittani, an Iraqi. It was
not clear whether Oakley meant to
imply criticism of Kittani.
Oakley said the United States had
restored enough security since the
Marines arrived on Dec. 9 for a U.N.
commander to begin taking power.
"But . . . the United Nations is drag
ging its feet," Oakley said.
Boutros-Ghali could not immediately
be reached at the United Nations yes
terday regarding Oakley's charge. He
has made no secret that he will resist
deploying U.N. peacekeepers until he
believes it is safe for them to operate.

The United States told the council
that together with its coalition partners,
it had made significant gains in securing
key towns, ports, airports and roads. But
it stopped short of saying it had estab
lished an entirely safe environment.
Oakley said the United States also told
the United Nations that a U.N. force
should operate throughout Somalia. The
U.S.-led coalition is restricted to the more
famine-wracked southern half of the
country, where an estimated 2 million
Somalis are threatened with starvation.
The United Nations has traditionally
taken the view that the world body
should serve the role of peacekeeper, not
peacemaker — as it would have to be
amid clan warfare in northern Somalia.
Boutros-Ghali sees the United
Nations' task as working with private
relief agencies to restore basic services
and revive Somalia's economy.
