# Military gay ban fight:
## Clinton to decide today; congressmen speak for ban 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton tried to defuse opposition to lift
ing the ban on homosexuals in the mili
tary yesterday, pledging on the eve of his
proposal that a strict code governing sex
ual conduct would accompany any policy
change. Republicans readied for a fight
just the same.
Clinton focused on fellow Democrats,
telephoning Sen. Sam Nunn and inviting
him and other Armed Services Commit
tee Democrats to an evening meeting at
the White House.
Nunn, probably the most influential
senator on military matters, recited a
litany of reasons for keeping the ban in a
Senate floor speech. However, in a
switch of tone from earlier criticism of
Clinton's handling of the issue, he also
said, "It's in everyone's interest to see if
we can resolve this issue through con
sensus rather than confrontation."
Clinton had intended to release his
policy yesterday, but delayed it one day
to give himself and Defense Secretary
Les Aspin a chance to speak further to
Nunn and other senators.
A testy Clinton refused to answer
reporters' questions on the issue at a pic
ture-taking session. Asked if the contro
versy were distracting him from the
economy, Clinton snapped: "No, it's dis
tracting you. It's not distracting me."
Opposition continued among law
makers and in thousands of telephone
calls that tied up Capitol telephones
most of the day.
Nunn said in his speech that any pol
icy change must be the shared responsi
bility of the executive branch and
Congress. The Georgia Democrat asked
a series of provocative questions that he
said the administration had failed to
answer, including whether separate liv
ing quarters or changes in the law on
sodomy would be necessary.
"It's not simply the right of homosex

uals at stake. It's also the right of all
those men and women who serve in the
military," Nunn said.
His committee plans hearings on the
issue in March, and in the meantime, he
said in an interview after the speech,
"I'd like to have no final decisive action
by the president and no final decisive
action by the Congress."
At the White House, spokesman
George Stephanopoulos said the presi
dent would release his policy today and
couple it with a strict conduct code gov
erning sexual behavior and harassment
that covered both homosexuals and het
erosexuals.
"I think it is important to draw a line
between status and conduct," Stephan
opoulos said.
The Uniformed Military Code of Jus
tice currently states that sodomy is a
crime.
Republicans, meanwhile, promised an
immediate challenge to any policy changes.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas said if Clinton acts, the Republi
cans, in a symbolic move, would intro
duce a free-standing bill codifying the
ban this week.
He conceded that the GOP would be
unable to get Democratic consent to vote
on such a measure.
Then, the Republicans would try to
attach an amendment adding the ban to
a family and medical leave bill which will
be presented next week.
"We'd just as soon wait for family
leave . . . and take care of two things at
once," Dole said at a Capitol Hill news
conference.
The public was being heard as well.
The main telephone numbers for the
House and Senate were jammed most of
yesterday.
Opponents of lifting the ban said
most of the hundreds of callers felt the
same way.
