# U.S. Gulf War soldiers exposed to radiation by friendly fire

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Several dozen
U.S. soldiers were exposed to minor
amounts of radiation in the Gulf War and
the Army did not provide proper warn
ings or training for the hazards, accord
ing to a draft General Accounting Office
report.
The exposures resulted partly from
"friendly fire" rounds containing deplet
ed uranium — shells that penetrated
Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehi
cles, the GAO said in the draft obtained
yesterday by The Associated Press.
Depleted uranium is a slightly radioac
tive material used to toughen armor
piercing rounds and the shielding of some

MIAI Abrams tanks. It ordinarily poses
no health risk to tank crews because it is
covered by other shielding material.
Some tank crews were exposed when
they were near vehicles which accidental
ly caught fire and igmted aimnuivttiOn,
and some troops assigned to disposal of
damaged vehicles also may have been at
risk, the congressional investigators con
cluded.
The GAO did not report any illness
among those exposed, but noted that pre
liminary tests on two wounded soldiers
"showed the presence of uranium in their
urine in excess of' federal radiation expo
sure guidelines.

But the levels "were far below the
amounts which would cause toxic
effects," the report said.
Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who ordered
the report as chairman of a House Small
Business subcommittee, said he will ask
Defense Secretary Les Aspin to conduct a
review of the exposure "on an expedited
basis."
"We should undertake changes to
make sure that these exposures are kept
to an absolute minimum. It's readily
apparent that this sloppy system doesn't
deliver that assurance," Wyden said.
The Army "has not effectively educat
ed its personnel in the hazards of DU

(depleted uranium) contamination and in
proper safety measures," the report said.
"What little information is available is
not widely disseminated."
"Our review showed that at least sev
eral dozen U.S.- soldiers, some unknow
ingly, were exposed" to depleted uranium,
often in the form of dust, the report said.
Army and Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission officials believe the doses did not
exceed federal limits established by the
NRC, the report said.
But both agencies agreed "the rela
tionship between radiation dosage and
health risks at low levels of exposure is
not clearly understood and compliance

with the NEC limits does not eliminate
the risk of future health problems."
The report said 15 Bradleys and 14
Abrams tanks were contaminated in the
war and 35 soldiers were wounded.
In addition, 27 New Jersey Army
National Guard soldiers from the 144 th
Service and Supply Company said they
were unknowingly exposed to depleted
uranium. These troops were assigned to
determine damage to the vehicles and
ready the equipment for shipment.
As of November, a dozen guard mem
bers received radiological testing and
were informed the results were negative,
the GAO said.
