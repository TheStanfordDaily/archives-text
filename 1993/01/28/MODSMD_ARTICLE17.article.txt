The University would
do good to build more
recreational facilities

CAL. HARVARD. The Univer
sity of North Carolina.
What do all of these
schools have that Stanford
doesn't? A college town. An easily
reachable place with used CD
stores, pizza parlors, bars by the
dozen and a fair share of eccentrics
loitering about.
Given this socially deficient
atmosphere, one would expect that
University students would try to
make their own fun. And, general
ly, they do. Overflowing crowds at
the Coffee House attest to this.
These crowds are a testament to
the atmospheric and program
changes that have allowed a more
diverse group to feel comfortable
there. Hip-hop night introduced
Bay Area rappers and DJ's to the
campus music scene, filling the
void that several rounds of "Brown
Eyed Girl" created.
Yet, something was lost when
the Coffee House painted its walls
periwinkle and threw the bohemi
ans and the Portable Nietzsche in
the street. The place has become
more of a bar/dancehall than a tra
ditional, intellectual coffee house.
Now that the ASSU is going to
use the space under Tresidder
(once, legend has it, a bowling
alley) they would do well to create
another on-campus, after-hours
recreational option, like a sports
bar or a '50s-style soda fountain.
Such a location would establish an
on-campus hangout, and would be
more popular than the ASSU's
current plans of moving the ne'er
do-well Shirt Shack down there.
However, even a sports bar can
only be so much of a salve to the
open sore of a dull campus
nightlife, especially on weekday
nights. The rest of Tresidder —
the grill, the Corner Pocket, etc —
closes its doors early. If students

want a place to hang out and peo
ple-watch after 10 p.m., they are
out of luck.
A local cafe, ice-cream parlor, or
even diner can be an invaluable
addition to the "intellectual atmo
sphere" of a school if only because
at such a place a person can sit,
think and just be. Plato had the
Academy. Shakespeare the Globe
Theater. We need something
grander than an overcrowded cof
fee stand.
Tresidder certainly has a pletho
ra of "dead space" that begs for
renewal. Stanford students rarely
take their 501's to the campus
cleaners for a pressing, and
Kinko's 2-cent-per-copy deal cer
tainly beats the best offer that the
University can make.
Within these rooms, Stanford
could establish a used-book/used
CD store where students actually
could beat the Bookstore. The
store should include comfortable
reading chairs for students who
wish to relax a while before mak
ing a purchase.
A late night soda fountain with
table service could offer home
cooked meals like burgers and
chocolate chip pancakes. Or maybe
the University could build a second
recreation room, where students
could lean back in bean bags and
select one of many board games to
play with a group of friends.
Tresidder has long promised to
transform into a more student
focused environment, and creative
ideas like these are an excellent
place to start. As far as funding is
concerned, investment in any of
these areas undoubtedly will make
back the start-up costs.
And for unconvinced adminis
trators, these suggestions are in
perfect accord with Stanford's
strict alcohol policy. The Universi
ty could prevent many of the prob
lems associated with alcohol abuse
by providing real entertainment
alternatives, including a sports bar
with professional bartenders
instead of students pouring Ever
clear into a garbage can full of Kool
Aid.
