## A
						benediction from Brad 
### 
ADIOS, AMIGOS. I'M OUTTA HERE.
Arrivederci. Sayonara. Au revoir.
Auf wiederschen. One thousand
and one ways of saying goodbye. Later.
The youth, intoxicated with his admira
tion of a hero, fails to see, that it is only a
projection of his own soul, which he
admires. In solitude, in a remote village,
the ardent youth loiters and mourns. . . .
The difference of circumstance is merely
costume. I am tasting the self-same life —
its sweetness, its greatness, its pain, which
I so admire in other men. Read Emerson.
And read Rainer Maria Rilke, begin
ning with his "Letters to a Young Poet"
even if you hate poetry. This book is a
necessity. So is Philip Levine's "New
Selected Poems," even if you despise
poetry. Just buy them, and get around to
the reading part when you can.
But don't read too much. Some say the
pen is mightier than the sword, others
say the sword over the pen and some
times the remote control feels like the
mightiest of 'em all. But don't watch too
much TV, either. Worst of all, don't read
TV Guide. Television sucks these days.
Turn it off, maybe shoot it before some
one on "Cops" or "911" shoots you right
through the screen.
Pray to the gods inside you. Or the one
above. Or someone very close to you, or an
absolute stranger who somehow made
you feel sad. Just pray. Someone or some
thing needs to be thanked for what you

have. So does the earth, and every day at
that. A trip tomorrow to San Gregorio
beach could take care of all the above. But
the following day there's so much more.
A jug of Carlo Rossi Blush would do you
well on any road trip with friends. So
would a copy of "Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas." Friendship. Such an odd concept
for two beings to come together and share
alike and share apart. But something
about all of it is right. Or else it's all wrong.
Ah, life's weighty ironies! The bitterness of
remorse, imaginable forms of the here
inafter! How I love to ponder so! So do you.
You wonder what to name your chil
dren. Write a letter to your unnamed
child, confess all you've done and contin
ue to do and tuck it away somewhere to
be found and opened years from now.
Watch the children around you. How
small they are. How big they will become.
How you don't know what the hell has
been going on between.
Close your eyes. Open your eyes. Close
your eyes until you can't stand it any
longer. Go for as long as you can in one
day without talking. Notice the next time
your hands aren't touching anything,
and sift the air that is the same on both
sides of your hands. Disappear for a little
while, then come back.
It's all about magic. Here, there, him
and her, you yourself and I. Abracadabra,
it's gonna grab ya — last week I saw
someone biking naked through the rain.

Pay attention. To every second, every
voice, every silence, everything. Indeed,
the moment is a cliche, but chances are, if
we lived by certain cliches we'd probably
be a lot better off. Don't let the bed bugs
bite. Let your lover.
Thurgood Marshall has died. "That he
did what he could with what he had" is
what he once told reporters how he want
ed to be remembered.
I talked to my dad this morning, trying
to figure out what I can do with all I have.
Maybe I'm just feeling tired these
days. But naps seem evil, too. In the
meantime I'm still waiting for an Andrea
Parkes experience, for someone to buy
me a beer at the Goose. Time's a
wastin'. . . .
If you want me again, look for me
under your bootsoles. You will hardly
know who I am or what I mean, but I
shall be good health to you nevertheless
and filter and fibre your blood. Failing to
fetch me at first, keep encouraged. Miss
ing me one place, search another. I stop
somewhere waiting for you. . .

Brad Winters passes the time with Emer
son and a small bag of peanuts waiting
patiently for an ice-cold, frosty one.
