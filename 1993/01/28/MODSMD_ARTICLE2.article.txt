# Indirect-cost rules held off for a while
## 
### Howard Libit Editorial staff 
The Clinton administration has
indefinitely postponed implemen
tation of the new federal indirect
cost regulations, possibly giving the
University another chance to cam
paign against the costly revisions.
The new rules had been released
by the Office of Management and
Budget last week on the Bush ad
ministration's last day of office.
But, pending further review,
new OMB head Leon Panetta has
temporarily halted implementa
tion of all new regulations issued
during the last few days of the
Bush administration — including
the indirect-cost rules.
An OMB spokesman confirmed
the postponement yesterday but
would not comment on what
might happen during the delay or
how long it will be before the Clin
ton administration issues new
regulations.
In announcing the delay, the

government said the last-minute
regulations would be reviewed
after the OMB finishes hiring pro
gram associate directors some
time in early February.
But no one knows whether the
Clinton administration will mere
ly reissue the same indirect-cost
regulations that were published
last week or make substantial re
visions to them.
"I have no idea what will come
out of this," said Chief Financial
Officer Peter Van Etten. "They
very well could do the same thing."
"It's like reading tea leaves,"
said Hall Daily, the director for
government relations and com
munity affairs at Caltech. "One
can always find reasons to be
hopeful and reasons to be fearful.
At this point I don't think there is
good reason to be either."
The release of the new indirect
cost regulations last week had repre
sented the completion of an almost
two-year effort by the government
to fix the problems that led to Stan
ford's indirect-cost controversy.
After a series of embarrassing
revelations about inappropriate
charges to indirect costs to uni
versities nationwide, the govern

ment concluded that the rules
governing indirect costs were
unclear and misleading.
In the meantime, of course,
government reimbursement of
indirect costs to Stanford was
reduced more than $20 million
per year.
It is unclear how much the new
changes proposed by the Bush
administration would have cost the
University, but initial estimates

suggest they would be expensive.
For instance, the regulations
formalized a 26 percent cap on
administrative expenses, which,
because the University is over the
cap, is costing Stanford between
$6 million and $8 million per year.
The ending of tuition remis
sion — the practice of charging a
portion of the tuition of graduate
students involved in federally
sponsored research to indirect

costs — could also cost Stanford
between $5 million and $10 mil
lion per year while jeopardizing
the status of up to 25 percent of
graduate students.
The other major change
involves how the University can
charge the salaries of administra
tive and clerical personnel.
Although the initial draft of
the new rules would have cost
Stanford $11 million in reim

bursement for those salaries, the
final version has allowed the Uni
versity to recapture at least some
of the money. But vague wording
in the regulations surrounding
that area could still prove expen
sive for Stanford.
Under last week's regulations,
the University's indirect-cost rate
was also unlikely to increase
much above its current rate of
60.3 percent.

Before the indirect-cost contro
versy, Stanford had been seeking
a rate of 78 percent. Each per
centage point roughly corre
sponds to $1.5 million per year.
Van Etten said he did not know
if the government will allow anoth
er period of comment on the pro
posed regulations, but said Stan
ford will try to work with other uni
versities affected by the rule
changes "to try to get clarification."
