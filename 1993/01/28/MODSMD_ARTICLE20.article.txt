Huyck's column protected by First Amendment

IN LAST MONDAY'S letter in The
Daily, senior Scott Cook made a
challenge to Pete Huyck: to meet
at noon in White Plaza "face to face
with me and anyone else who wishes
to see how tough you really are, in
person."
What is this, junior high? What next,
are we going to bring in all our daddies
to see which one is biggest?
Let's face it. Huyck is operating com
pletely within his rights and is not obli
gated to give an explanation for any
thing he's done. He applied for a job as a
columnist, for reasons that are strictly
his business. They gave him the job. His
responsibility is quite simple: to write
something that will catch people's inter
est so they'll read the newspaper. It
seems to me that he has fulfilled his

responsibility quite well.
Now don't anybody come at me with
"journalistic ethics," because I don't
know anything about that and I don't
care. As a reader, all I want is something
interesting to look at while I eat my
lunch.
And I don't believe Pete Huyck signed
any kind of P.C. agreement. So he has
no obligation to live up to anyone's stan
dards of morality but his own.
We all have different opinions of
Huyck's work. Some think it's funny,
some think it's offensive, some think
other things. Guess what: By definition,
we are all correct. However you perceive
his work defines what it is to you and
you alone. It cannot be defined as uni
versally funny or offensive. You can't
tell someone that material isn't funny if

it makes them laugh.
It is also true that you can't invali
date someone's feelings if they are
angry or offended. But Huyck hasn't
done this â€” he's only expressed himself.
It's not his obligation to be sensitive to
those whom he has offended. We may
think it would be nice of him, but we
are not justified in trying to force him to
do so.
This is why I think people like Cook
should be careful about saying things
like "we won't let you off that easy" to
Huyck. Who is this "we," and where do
you claim to derive your authority?
Don't presume that you represent
"every member of this community,"
because you don't.
And don't claim that the First
Amendment doesn't apply to Huyck,

because it applies to everyone. It doesn't
just protect "heartfelt and meaningful
ideas." It protects all ideas, without cast
ing judgement on their value.
Until you can find the words "politi
cally correct" in the First Amendment,
you've got no real case against Huyck,
and you have to "let him off that easy"
because that's his Constitutional right.
So if you don't like his work, don't
read it.
Or, if you choose, scream out your
point of view in public and write 10,000
editorial letters. But don't expect him to
show up in White Plaza to let you yell at
him. Huyck has no obligation to argue
with you, or to give any explanation for
the ideas he has freely expressed.
