# Nothing honorable in lying to Navy officals about medical records
## 
### 
I see no integrity in lying to the mili
tary.
The front-page article of the Jan.
26 issue of The Daily describes a les
bian Naval Officer who is appealing to
our President to overturn her dis
charge.
One of the questions on a military
entrance physical asks whether one is
homosexual. Falsifying a medical history
is grounds for discharge, and indeed the
military takes disciplinary action for
such lies.
Why should they exclude this inten
tional deception? Regardless of the
"political correctness" of the policy, a lie
is a lie and is unbecoming conduct for an
officer. This alone is sufficient to end
her Naval career. The time to argue the

policy is before entering the military, not
after one sneaked in.
One also has to wonder what motivat
ed Zoe Dunning, a Stanford Business
School student, to lie. Perhaps she cares
not for the military, but the scholarship
money and benefits it brings.
