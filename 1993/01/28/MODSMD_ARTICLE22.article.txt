# Distorted perception: Palestinians' plight misstated by many
## 
### 
I am writing to express my dismay
over the reporting and views expressed
in the article, "Jewish supporter of
Palestinians discusses formation of
her views" in the Jan 26 issue of The
Daily.
Points of view in the article are based
on obvious distortions of fact. Unfortu

nately, the general reader and public is
unaware that much of what they read
and see about the "Palestinian Ques
tion" has similar factual distortions and
half-truths.
The New York Times and ABC
News, contrary to graduate student
Hilton Obenzinger's observation
(expressed in the article) that the U.S.
media remains silent, are well known
for similar abuses in their (mis)treat
ment of Israel.
(See for example, "The Media's War
Against Israel," ed. by Karetzky and
Goldman).
This is why I am overwhelmingly
appalled by Obenzinger's assertion that
"the Anti-Defamation League gathers
information on the Nazis, skinheads and
KKK, and puts in the same category
anyone who criticizes Israel, like Noam
Chomsky, Edward Said, Barbara Lubin
and Joel Beinin."
Unlike Obenzinger's implication that
the Anti-Defamation League is an evil
intelligence agency, the ADL is a not-

for-profit organization whose goal, as
its name implies, is to prevent exactly
the misinformation that is evident in
the article. By making the general pub
lic aware of facts, not opinions, the
ADL hopes to foster more intelligent
and reasoned discussion of Israeli poli
cy.
For example, when refugee camps
that were started in 1948 are men
tioned in the article, nothing is men
tioned about Lebanon, Syria, Jordan
and Egypt's refusal to accept the
Palestinians into their country, even
though they had incited their depar
ture from Israel.
Thanks to organizations like the
ADL, the public is able to sift through
illusion and reality and make informed
judgements.
I applaud the Anti-Defamation
League's efforts, and I hope they contin
ue in the face of critics like Lubin and
Obenzinger.
