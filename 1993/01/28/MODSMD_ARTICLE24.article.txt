## Hoops' leading-scorer Williams shoots for unfound consistency Cardinal junior looks to break slump against WSU 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
It seems that there are two versions
of Brent Williams: the one who only a
year ago scored 22 points against Ari
zona and Alabama; and the one that has
been wearing jersey no. 33 lately and
shooting 42 percent from the field.
So where did the first one go in just
one season?
With the departure of Adam Keefe,
Stanford was expected to concentrate on
offensive fireworks from the outside,
and the new focal point was supposed to
be Brent Williams. Dick Vitale's "Annu
al" referred to him as an "ascending
star." He's still ascending.
"Brent is a hard one to figure," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery.
"He's not an aggressive kid. He's very
quiet, and he's struggling a little bit
with what to do."
To the outsider, all would seem well
and good. He enters tonight's contest as
Stanford's leading scorer, averaging
13.4 points per game, also leading the
team with a 5.7 rebounding average.
Williams' numbers are not bad by any
means. But nor are they earth-shatter
ing, and that's where much criticism
lies.
"I haven't been very consistent,"
Williams said. "I haven't been shooting
well, and the injuries we've had team
wise have put more pressure on me —
not just to produce but to make things
happen."
Williams also has been bothered by
bone spurs in his left ankle and tendini
tis in his left knee sporadically through
out the season, accounting, in part, for
his performances of late. Williams was
supposed to be the player the Cardinal
would turn to down the stretch, but
Williams has yet to show himself as
Stanford's go-to guy.
"I'm not jumping as high as usual
and I have trouble keeping my balance,
and that has made it harder to score,"
Williams said. "I'm trying to make it so
that it's all mental — [the painj is going
to be there, but I have to put that out of
my mind and just play."
Williams has had difficulty adjusting
to other teams' habit of focusing their
defenses on him. In the Pacific 10 Con
ference, league foes know that the key to
success against Stanford is stopping
Williams.
"We've got to continue to work with
him to develop a good set of skills and
get him mentally able to adjust to being
the target of other people's defenses,"
Montgomery said.

Williams has been getting good looks
at the basket during the games and is
taking approximately 14 shots per out
ing. He has not, however, been making
those shots at a high clip, something
Montgomery has stressed as a key to the
team's success from the get-go.
"It would be nice for him to shoot 60
percent and get 20 points a game, but I
don't know if that's in the cards right
now," Montgomery said.
Williams, though, thinks he'll turn it
around.
"This is one of the longest shooting
slumps I've had," Williams said. "Soon,
my shots will start going down, my play
will get better. But it's more important
to get some wins."
The game that turned Williams into
a high-profile player was against Alaba
ma in the first round of the NCAA
Southeast Regional last March.
Williams played 40 minutes against the
Crimson Tide, and had a strong defen
sive showing against Latrell Sprewell,
now of the NBA's Golden State War
riors.
"I think that game was both the best
and worst thing to happen to me,"
Williams said. "On the one hand, we
played well and I played well. I was in a
zone all game — everything I touched
went in. On the other, I haven't been
able to reach that point of focus all sea
son. I was really nervous before that
game, and I haven't really been nervous
this season.
"People have put all that stuff in
my face — you played well against
Sprewell, you played well against
Tracy (Murray), you played well
against Harold (Miner), and look what
they're doing. I've been having trouble
dealing with all of it. The most impor
tant thing right now is that we have to
find a way to win. The honors will
come later."
Because Stanford's injury situation
has left the team with a lack of depth in
the frontline, Montgomery has recently
used Williams at the power-forward spot
when putting his small, quick lineup on
the floor. Consequently, Williams is
oftentimes matched up against bigger
players, but is also in better position to
rebound. Last Thursday, he tallied 13
boards against UCLA.
"Playing the four (power forward)
makes me more responsible for things
on the court," Williams said. "I like that.
There are advantages of playing down
low — when you're playing post you're
right there for the rebound. When
you're at small forward, two guys are in
your way to get there."

'It would be nice for
him to shoot 60 percent
and get 20 points a
game, but I don't know
if that's in the cards
right now.'
— Mike Montgomery

Nothing, though, gets in the way of
Williams' attempts for mental prepara
tion. Williams enjoys listening to music
off the court, both before and after
games.
"Before I get ready for a game, I lis
ten to hard-core rap," Williams said. "I
don't want to go into a game soft and
lazy. I want to get pumped."
Post-game, Williams likes to wind
down with some slow music, and has
recently developed a jazz collection.
The 6-foot-6 junior from Tacoma,
Wash., has extra motivation for impres
sive play this weekend playing against
his hometown schools.
"All my best friends go to Washing
ton State, and my family is near Wash
ington," Williams said. "I have to do
well, otherwise I'll hear it from the
home crowd."
Williams would be more than happy
to give the opposition some blues com
pact discs to listen to in exchange for
two wins.

So where did the first one go in just
one season?
With the departure of Adam Keefe,
Stanford was expected to concentrate on
offensive fireworks from the outside,
and the new focal point was supposed to
be Brent Williams. Dick Vitale's "Annu
al" referred to him as an "ascending
star." He's still ascending.
"Brent is a hard one to figure," said
Stanford coach Mike Montgomery.
"He's not an aggressive kid. He's very
quiet, and he's struggling a little bit
with what to do."
To the outsider, all would seem well
and good. He enters tonight's contest as
Stanford's leading scorer, averaging
13.4 points per game, also leading the
team with a 5.7 rebounding average.
Williams' numbers are not bad by any
means. But nor are they earth-shatter
ing, and that's where much criticism
lies.
"I haven't been very consistent,"
Williams said. "I haven't been shooting
well, and the injuries we've had team
wise have put more pressure on me —
not just to produce but to make things
happen."
Williams also has been bothered by
bone spurs in his left ankle and tendini
tis in his left knee sporadically through
out the season, accounting, in part, for
his performances of late. Williams was
supposed to be the player the Cardinal
would turn to down the stretch, but
Williams has yet to show himself as
Stanford's go-to guy.
"I'm not jumping as high as usual
and I have trouble keeping my balance,
and that has made it harder to score,"
Williams said. "I'm trying to make it so
that it's all mental — [the painj is going
to be there, but I have to put that out of
my mind and just play."
Williams has had difficulty adjusting
to other teams' habit of focusing their
defenses on him. In the Pacific 10 Con
ference, league foes know that the key to
success against Stanford is stopping
Williams.
"We've got to continue to work with
him to develop a good set of skills and
get him mentally able to adjust to being
the target of other people's defenses,"
Montgomery said.

Williams has been getting good looks
at the basket during the games and is
taking approximately 14 shots per out
ing. He has not, however, been making
those shots at a high clip, something
Montgomery has stressed as a key to the
team's success from the get-go.
"It would be nice for him to shoot 60
percent and get 20 points a game, but I
don't know if that's in the cards right
now," Montgomery said.
Williams, though, thinks he'll turn it
around.
"This is one of the longest shooting
slumps I've had," Williams said. "Soon,
my shots will start going down, my play
will get better. But it's more important
to get some wins."
The game that turned Williams into
a high-profile player was against Alaba
ma in the first round of the NCAA
Southeast Regional last March.
Williams played 40 minutes against the
Crimson Tide, and had a strong defen
sive showing against Latrell Sprewell,
now of the NBA's Golden State War
riors.
"I think that game was both the best
and worst thing to happen to me,"
Williams said. "On the one hand, we
played well and I played well. I was in a
zone all game — everything I touched
went in. On the other, I haven't been
able to reach that point of focus all sea
son. I was really nervous before that
game, and I haven't really been nervous
this season.
"People have put all that stuff in
my face — you played well against
Sprewell, you played well against
Tracy (Murray), you played well
against Harold (Miner), and look what
they're doing. I've been having trouble
dealing with all of it. The most impor
tant thing right now is that we have to
find a way to win. The honors will
come later."
Because Stanford's injury situation
has left the team with a lack of depth in
the frontline, Montgomery has recently
used Williams at the power-forward spot
when putting his small, quick lineup on
the floor. Consequently, Williams is
oftentimes matched up against bigger
players, but is also in better position to
rebound. Last Thursday, he tallied 13
boards against UCLA.
"Playing the four (power forward)
makes me more responsible for things
on the court," Williams said. "I like that.
There are advantages of playing down
low — when you're playing post you're
right there for the rebound. When
you're at small forward, two guys are in
your way to get there."

'It would be nice for
him to shoot 60 percent
and get 20 points a
game, but I don't know
if that's in the cards
right now.'

Nothing, though, gets in the way of
Williams' attempts for mental prepara
tion. Williams enjoys listening to music
off the court, both before and after
games.
"Before I get ready for a game, I lis
ten to hard-core rap," Williams said. "I
don't want to go into a game soft and
lazy. I want to get pumped."
Post-game, Williams likes to wind
down with some slow music, and has
recently developed a jazz collection.
The 6-foot-6 junior from Tacoma,
Wash., has extra motivation for impres
sive play this weekend playing against
his hometown schools.
"All my best friends go to Washing
ton State, and my family is near Wash
ington," Williams said. "I have to do
well, otherwise I'll hear it from the
home crowd."
Williams would be more than happy
to give the opposition some blues com
pact discs to listen to in exchange for
two wins.

Brent Williams and the Stanford squad look to rebound after two LA losses, taking on
the Washington State Cougars at home.
It seems that there are two versions
of Brent Williams: the one who only a
year ago scored 22 points against Ari
zona and Alabama; and the one that has
been wearing jersey no. 33 lately and
shooting 42 percent from the field.
