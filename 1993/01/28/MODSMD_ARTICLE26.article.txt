Game in and game out, the Cardinal women's
basketball squad is constantly reminded how diffi
cult it is to be the defending national champion.
Midway through the season, Stanford (14-3, 5-1
Pacific 10 Conference) has learned that it cannot
afford to take any team lightly, as every opponent
gets fired up when it has the chance to knock off a
top-ranked team.
"Every team we play makes a special concerted
effort against us," said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "It comes with the territory. Our team
has to expect that and welcome that challenge."
The No. 5 Cardinal received all the challenges it
could handle last week as it faced USC and UCLA,
two of the best squads in the Pac-10. After losing
soundly to USC early in the week, Stanford quickly
bounced back as it edged out the Bruins on Thurs
day and revenged the Trojans last Saturday.
"I thought we had a real good weekend, coming
back after the USC loss, playing two of the top four
teams in the conference," VanDerveer said.
The Lady Cardinal hopes to repeat its performance
on the road tonight against Washington State (6-8, 2-
3) and Saturday night at Washington (8-6, 3-2).
Although Stanford has beaten Washington State
in all of their 14 meetings and has won three straight
against the Huskies, according to VanDerveer, wins
don't come easily against any Pac-10 team.
"The conference competition is excellent and the
teams are really well prepared to play us," she said.
"The environment in both places will be tough."
Still, the Cardinal figures to dash both of it's
opponents' hopes for an upset this weekend, espe
cially if Ail-American center Val Whiting continues
to dominate. In the past seven games, Whiting has
been on a tear, averaging 24 points and over 10
rebounds per contest.
In addition, the 6-foot-3 senior was recently
named Pac-10 Player of the Week for her inspired
efforts against USC and UCLA last week. In Satur
day's game against the Trojans, Whiting grabbed 12
rebounds to become the Pac-10 Career Rebound
leader and the first player in Stanford history to
accumulate over 1,000 boards.
"She always plays really well in the big games,"
VanDerveer said. "She has a lot of confidence."
Nevertheless, the Cardinal has clearly established
itself as a multi-dimensional team this season Several
players have stepped forward to carry the load, making
things easier for Whiting to operate close to the basket
"What I think has really helped Val," VanDerveer
said, "has been Anita I Kaplan's] and Rachel |Hem
mer'sl success and Molly Goodenbour's three-point
shooting. It really opens things up for Val."
"When she's isolated one-on-one, there's nobody
who can stop her."
