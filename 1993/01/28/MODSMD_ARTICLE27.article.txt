# Pardon Walsh for NCAA flubs
## 
### 
Violations, schmiolations.
It seems as if we got caught with our
hand in the cookie jar last week, as Stan
ford received a slap on the wrist from the
NCAA. A little football recruiting no-good-bad
stuff on our part. A photo here, a press confer
ence there. An itsy-bitsy smudge on the shining
record of our own personal messiah, Bill Walsh.
The man.

The myth. The
rule violator?
C'mon, give him
a break.
We're talk
ing Bill Walsh.
The man who
tied the NFL
around his
pinky finger.

The man who
walks on water. The man who has Stanford
alumni sacrificing young goats to the gods in
appreciation.
So he's a little rusty on the whole NCAA
invent-a-new-restriction-every-time-Fox-puts
out-a-new-sit-com policy.
Oops.
He's sorry. We're sorry. Ted Leland is sorry.
Can't you see that? We were way too busy mak
ing sure our current players got in their
honor's theses to preoccupy ourselves with
minor details.
Did I mention that we're sorry?
Walsh is supposed to find time in between
widows, orphans and puppies society charity
balls to read the do's and don't's of the nasty
NCAA? Puh-leeze. The man is a genius. He
doesn't have time to memorize which flavor ice
cream you can buy a recruit or how long you
can flirt with the recruit's mother/girlfriend
I mean, for a coach like Walsh, there
shouldn't be any rules. Free cars? Why not.
Free prostitutes for visiting recruits? Sure, the
alumni'll foot it. No Billy Joe Hobert-esque
loans, but $20,000 for a summer job at a rich
alumni's BMW dealership? Sure. The NCAA
should give him money to distribute, so more
players can get into his program. Call it his own
personal gift to humanity.
So when he travels across country, with
satyrs sprinkling the airport runway with roses
to honor his arrival, how can he not give his


Tish
Williams
giddy high school prospects a fair
sampling of his god-like ways.
A photo for Mom and Dad to
put on the mantle, right next to
the 801 l Weevil League Defensive
Player of the Year trophy. All the
kids at school will be so jealous.
Something to make a Christmas
card out of, and run in the local
used car tabloid.
Allow the recruits the little
pleasures of life.
Bill Walsh shows up on your
doorstep, eeks out a smile as your
dog sluggo humps his leg, chokes
down your mom's Goat Helper,
tells your punked-out sister she's

beautiful and rubs your dad's
beer gut, and your supposed to
restrain your excitement. Pee in
your pants. . . no. Milk it for all
it's worth. . . yes.
Do you think he does these
things for his own personal ben
efit? I think not. Not that home
town press conferences aren't
fun. Not that Mom isn't the next
best thing to carpet deodorizer.
But Mr. Walsh has better things
to do with his precious time. It's
not like the 49ers cheerleaders
are worried about losing their
spots to your mother.
But the kids. Think of the kids.
Think of the joy. If they can get
in, they've got to be good kids.
Moral kids. Angelic, candidate
for-canonization type kids like
Justin Armour.

I mean, we turned ourselves in.
We're good kids too. We steal
some Brachs candy out of the
supermarket, and we tell the
owner, asking if we should pay for
emotional damage too.
So give us a break. We're the
good guys. Go check out Texas
A&M again. Look at USC. Leave
us alone, we're clean. We've got it
down pat. We'll never do it again.
We won't stoop to any lows.
And don't go asking about the
new linen sheets in Hoover
House, either. Walsh didn't have
anything to do with those. Not a
thing.

Tish Williams cannot hope to ever
achieve the heights David Schwartz
has, and quietly must retire from
her columnist position.
