# Pardon Walsh for NCAA flubs
## 
### 
Violations, schmiolations.
It seems as if we got caught with our
hand in the cookie jar last week, as Stan
ford received a slap on the wrist from the
NCAA. A little football recruiting no-good-bad
stuff on our part. A photo here, a press confer
ence there. An itsy-bitsy smudge on the shining
record of our own personal messiah, Bill Walsh.
The man.

The myth. The
rule violator?
C'mon, give him
a break.
We're talk
ing Bill Walsh.
The man who
tied the NFL
around his
pinky finger.

The man who
walks on water. The man who has Stanford
alumni sacrificing young goats to the gods in
appreciation.
So he's a little rusty on the whole NCAA
invent-a-new-restriction-every-time-Fox-puts
out-a-new-sit-com policy.
Oops.
He's sorry. We're sorry. Ted Leland is sorry.
Can't you see that? We were way too busy mak
ing sure our current players got in their
honor's theses to preoccupy ourselves with
minor details.
Did I mention that we're sorry?
Walsh is supposed to find time in between
widows, orphans and puppies society charity
balls to read the do's and don't's of the nasty
NCAA? Puh-leeze. The man is a genius. He
doesn't have time to memorize which flavor ice
cream you can buy a recruit or how long you
can flirt with the recruit's mother/girlfriend
I mean, for a coach like Walsh, there
shouldn't be any rules. Free cars? Why not.
Free prostitutes for visiting recruits? Sure, the
alumni'll foot it. No Billy Joe Hobert-esque
loans, but $20,000 for a summer job at a rich
alumni's BMW dealership? Sure. The NCAA
should give him money to distribute, so more
players can get into his program. Call it his own
personal gift to humanity.
So when he travels across country, with
satyrs sprinkling the airport runway with roses
to honor his arrival, how can he not give his
