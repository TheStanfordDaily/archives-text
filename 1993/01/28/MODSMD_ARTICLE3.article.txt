# D'Sousa decries CIV in debate with prof.
## 
### Romesh Ratnesar Staff writer 
In a stirring debate on political
correctness last night, conserva
tive author Dinesh D'Souza con
demned Stanford's Cultures,
Ideas and Values courses for sub
verting academic standards and
bowing to political pressure.
Speaking before a lively packed
house at Kresge Auditorium,
D'Souza criticized CIV courses for
"replacing the orthodoxies of the
past with new political biases."
He argued that the texts in the
CIV curriculum are chosen for
cultural representation, not acad
emic merit.

"Liberal education has become
a sort of cultural Olympics," he
said. "Each ethnic group simply
wants to know, 'what did my guys
do?' " Later, D'Souza waggishly
commented, "The number one
problem with diversity is that
sometimes you get it."
He further argued that CIV has
succumbed to a victim's revolu
tion, and that claims of cultural op
pression have been "converted into
certificates of moral achievement."
D'Souza is the author of the
1989 book "Illiberal Education:
The Politics of Race and Sex on
Campus." The book included a
chapter commenting on the cam
pus-wide debate that led to the
transformation of the old Western
Culture program to CIV in 1988.
His opponent, Philosophy Prof.
Ron Glass, said D'Souza's book
reflected "modest" research skills.
"His chapter on CIV is riddled
with errors and fouled by an
intemperate tone," Glass said.
He argued that the CIV coordi
nators on the whole have not
abandoned great Western texts in
favor of political exigencies.
"We are serious scholars and
we treat texts accordingly," Glass
said. "We are still operating out of
a great books tradition."
Glass called attacks on CIV and
multicultural education "political
carping by D'Souza and his allies,
which should not be put up with
at Stanford, or anywhere."
"Equal opportunity means

that a variety of talents should be
recognized and valued," he said.
D'Souza called Glass' argu
ments "self-righteous" and said
that multiculturalism has led not
to "free and open debate" but a
stifling of expression.
He wondered what response
would be elicited if a student in a
feminist studies class were to
"stand up and say, 'the Roe ver
sus Wade decision was wrong.'
You'd probably begin to feel a lit
tle uncomfortable; you wouldn't
just be considered wrong, you
would be considered immoral."
Large portions of the debate
swirled around the book "I,
Rigoberta Menchu," the autobiog
raphy of a Nobel Peace Prize-win
ning Guatemalan activist, which
is taught in the Europe and the
Americas CIV track.
D'Souza said that Menchu's
Marxist views are not representa
tive of a non-western perspective
and are taught at Stanford
because she has "achieved con
summate victim status."

Glass countered, saying that
the book is not widely taught in
CIV and has thematic relevance
to the Europe and the Americas
track. He scolded D'Souza for his
remark that he was "sick and
tired of the third world being rep
resented by a lesbian feminist
from Guatemala."
D'Souza also criticized minori
ties for claiming texts from their
ancestries as "ethnic property."
"It would be as if white guys get
up and walk around with a smile
all day because Homer wrote the
Iliad," D'Souza said of such appro
priation.
Both speakers did, however,
move toward a semblance of ideo
logical convergence.
"The preservation of a thriv
ing university is about the fate of
the earth, and all that lives upon
it," Glass said.
D'Souza evoked a similar vision
of "universalism," adding that by
negotiating "the narrow chasm of
separation, we can recognize new
horizons open to all of us."
