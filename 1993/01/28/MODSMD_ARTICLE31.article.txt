# INTERMISSION
## Over The Hills We Go 
### Amy McConnell Editorial staff 
THE STANFORD DAILY'S ENTERTAINING WEEKLY

You've been to San Francisco,
eaten sourdough bread at
Fisherman's Wharf, maybe
even seen the Golden Gate Bridge.
Ten to one, you haven't crossed it You
should.
North of San Francisco, across the Bay on
the other side of the Bridge, lies what's per
haps California's quirkiest county. Just an
hour away from Stanford, Marin is a mecca
of money. But unlike Woodside or Atherton,
its got personality.
That everyone in Marin has a hot tub and
drinks white wine is false, but that the place is
home to more than its fair share of eccentrics
is true. California is hopelessly associated
with the quest for the good life, fitness and
self-help philosophies, money and fame. In
Marin County, these stereotypes aren't far
from the truth. And Mill Valley is the center
of it all.
