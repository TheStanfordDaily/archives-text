British film with
a Harlequin plot
just a bit too trite

Damage

Successful family man meets mysterious,
exotic female at a cocktail party, and after one
look (and one phone call) the two unite in
frenzied lovemaking sparking a scandalous af
fair.
But there's more. British politician Stephen
Fleming (Jeremy Irons) isn't sleeping with just
any exotic female; he's sleeping with Anna Bar
ton (Juliette Binoche), his son's fiancee.
The story mostly revolves around Fleming
and Barton's sexual excursions and cryptic
games of phone tag with glimpses of Fleming's
picture-perfect family coloring their not-so
kosher relationship.
Ah, the stuff of Harlequin romance novels

And director Louis Malle ("Au Revoir les En
fan ts") couldn't have done more justice to
"Damage," based on British author Josephine
Hart's novel of the same name. Lavish offices,
expensive cars and tailored landscapes provide
the perfect settings for the erotic melodrama,
while snug close-up shots intensify the tension.
Fortunately for those of us who were ex
pecting something fresh from the film —
other than 25 sexual positions kids shouldn't
try at home — superb acting and (believe it or
not) the character, Anna Barton, keep "Dam
age" afloat.
Although Barton fits the stereotype of "the
other woman" — dark-haired, promiscuous,

exotic — her fiercely non-committal attitude
and her intelligence are endearing.
Much of the credit must go to Binoche who
takes androgyny to another level, sporting
cropped hair and suit coats that add a certain
class to her character.
In the only original scene of the movie, Bar
ton basically tells Fleming to get real, after he
begs her to run away with him. "Why?" she
asks. "So we can have breakfast together?"
You've gotta love a woman like that. Go
ahead, girl.
Miranda Richardson shines as Ingrid
Fleming, the good wife who doesn't deserve
the pain her husband's thoughtless affair
brings her.
Yet, a review of "Damage" simply wouldn't
be complete without at least one comment on
the multiple sex scenes. At times violent, al
ways anxious, every thrust, every grimace em
phasizes the lack of true emotion. As Fleming
slams Barton's head against the floor while
rocking her to orgasm, one has to wonder how
their intercourse can be fun.
Keeping the fact that "Damage" is mostly
comprised of these scenes in mind, one also
has to wonder why anyone would spend seven
dollars to see it.

Champagne and
murder: A comic
look at violence

Man Bites Dog

Ben, a serial-killer, bumps off a friend
during his birthday party. He then noncha
lantly sits down, gobbles cake and asks for
more "bubbly," as the other guests sit in awk
ward silence, spattered with blood.
"Man Bites Dog" is not for the weak
hearted. The film, in French with English

subtitles, is an interesting play on the con
ventional representation of violence in the
mass media. However, for all its apparent
shock value, the film takes almost an hour to
reach its full stride.
In "Man Bites Dog" — a mock documen
tary like "Bob Roberts" or "Spinal Tap" — an
impoverished film crew follows Ben through
a series of murders and body dumpings.
In the opening scene, Ben
(producer/writer Benoit Poelvoorde) gives
the crew — and the audience — a lesson on
how much ballast weight is necessary to
properly sink the bodies of adults, midgets
and children. Ben relishes his role in front of
the camera and uses the time to not only off
victims but also philosophize and recite po
etry.
The movie, shot in 16 mm black and
white film, is the first feature-length project
by Belgian and French filmmakers R£my
Belvaux, Andr£ Bonzel and Benoit Poelvo
orde, whose relative inexperience with long
format shows through in some of the more
meandering sequences.
The humor in "Man Bites Dog" is darker
than dark. A few "Spinal Tap"-esque gags —
a combustible drummer is replaced by a dis
posable sound man — pepper the script.
And Ben constantly engages in ironic word
play, some of which gets lost in translation.
The comic aspects of the movie are over
shadowed by violence. One feels like a guest
at Ben's deadly birthday party — a little too
disturbed by what is happening to react.
When the film crew transforms from ob
servers and recorders of violence to accom
plices in Bens crimes, the plot thickens. Ben
begins to steal from his victims to finance the
documentary's completion. Onscreen, the
shift is made obvious when the crew emerges
from behind the camera to talk to Ben and
later to drag out and bury bodies.
The not-so-subtle indictment that "Man
