'Doubt' lingers in
Jones's latest: A
'Perverse' sound

Jesus Jones

Once-trendy Jesus Jones is back, and
they're pissed off. It was inevitable that the
band would lose its youthful abandon, first to
international stardom and now to Serious Art.
On their third album, the group delivers
the same sound with a different message: Even
pretty boys have problems. How "Perverse."
Only two songs on "Perverse" — "The
Devil You Know"and "Magazine" — cap
ture the sheer exuberance of 1990 hit "Right
Here, Right Now." And they are, sadly, des

tined to become just as overplayed. "The
problem with success is you become what
you detest," lead singer Mike Edwards sings
in"The Right Decision." Or, worse, you stop

taking chances.
Musically, Jones hasn't changed much in
the two years since they released their Gram
my-nominated second album, "Doubt." The
band's trademark compromise between
techno and guitar rock is still just that: a com
promise, with techno slowly gaining ground.
But, for all its self-plagiarism, "Perverse"
has nothing to equal the brooding simplicity
of "Welcome Back Victoria" or the righteous
fury of "1 Don't Want That Kind of Love"
from their debut album, "Liquidizer." Not
even a blender sample.
"Your Crusade" is purely a dance track,
while "From Love to War" espouses
peacenik rhetoric to a funky beat.
At least Jesus Jones hasn't lost its relentless
contemporaneity. At its best, "Perverse" calls
to mind images of U2 on acid. But a ballad
about global pollution? An ode to binary
codes? Pass the remote.
