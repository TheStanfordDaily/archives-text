The hub
Start your visit in the center of town at the Book
Depot — the hub of Mill Valley, literally. This was
once the bus depot, where locals hung out
playing hackey sack or smoking — and not M
just Marlboros. ■ 1 *
The bus station has been converted into a
bookstore/cafe where you can listen to authors
lecture on subjects like "The Wounded Woman." Or
browse through books — the self-help section is
especially well-stocked — while you eat your muffin
or sip your latte, which is most likely made with
milk from Marin's free-range cows.
People still hang out in the town square, but these
days there's a new attraction: a set of six permanent
game tables — four chess and two backgammon —
donated by the late Bill Graham, a Marin County
local.
The rich and the famous
At the locals' favorite bar, the Sweetwater (153
Throckmorton Ave.), you can listen to groups like
"The Fabulous Bud. E. Love Show" or "Dick Dale
and the Deltones." But, if you're lucky, you just
might catch Huey Lewis or maybe even Jerry
Garcia. For the concert schedule, call \

hood store, the Mill Valley

Market, located at 12 Corte Madera Ave. Lewis,
Sammy Hagar, Matt Dillon, Bonnie Raitt and Peter
Coyote have all been known to shop here, according
to employees.
Herbs and gvanola
For anthropologist-types, particularly amusing is
Roots and Legends (38 Miller Ave.), a store that sells
teas, roots, incense and all the essentials for those
who seek the way of herbal harmony.
Living Foods (149 Throckmorton Ave.) is also
worth a visit — if not for the organic crunchy
munch, at least for the colorful ambience. It's a
turn-of-the-century-style market, with knotty pine
walls and bright orange gourds piled high in the
windows. Browsing is as entertaining as buying;
j / who ever thought there were so many brands
of organic toothpaste?
Since the spirit, as well as the body, needs
food, as any Mill Valleyite would agree, an
organic picnic is a must — preferably including
a soy product — and the place to eat it is outside
under a tree, or by a stream.

Park yourself here
The Old Mill
Park is just a bit fur

ther down Throckmorton
Avenue. Aside from a jungle gym and a set of swings
that beckon to even the oldest-at-heart, the park
features several relics of local history.
There's an old saw mill reconstructed from the
1830s, when Mill Valley was first and foremost a mill
town, supplying cut wood to Yerba Buena — the small
city across the Bay — now known as San Francisco.
And there's also a gravity car that once formed
part of the Mount Tamalpais Railway, which served
as a playground for visiting San Franciscans at the
turn of the century. Twelve gravity cars were
attached to an engine and pulled to the top of the
mountain, where passengers marvelled at the vast
panorama of San Francisco and Marin County.
For the return trip, the gravity cars were unhooked
from the engine, so that individual groups could
drive themselves down the mountain at 12 m.p.h. —
the strictly enforced speed limit. The turn-of-the
century version of mountain biking, no doubt.
Stairmaster frenzy magnified
Old Mill Park has one other claim to feme: It's the
starting point of the annual Dipsea footrace, the
race that makes Ford Center-regulars look wimpy.
