The hub
Start your visit in the center of town at the Book
Depot — the hub of Mill Valley, literally. This was
once the bus depot, where locals hung out
playing hackey sack or smoking — and not M
just Marlboros. ■ 1 *
The bus station has been converted into a
bookstore/cafe where you can listen to authors
lecture on subjects like "The Wounded Woman." Or
browse through books — the self-help section is
especially well-stocked — while you eat your muffin
or sip your latte, which is most likely made with
milk from Marin's free-range cows.
People still hang out in the town square, but these
days there's a new attraction: a set of six permanent
game tables — four chess and two backgammon —
donated by the late Bill Graham, a Marin County
local.
The rich and the famous
At the locals' favorite bar, the Sweetwater (153
Throckmorton Ave.), you can listen to groups like
"The Fabulous Bud. E. Love Show" or "Dick Dale
and the Deltones." But, if you're lucky, you just
might catch Huey Lewis or maybe even Jerry
Garcia. For the concert schedule, call \
(415) 388-2820. (A

hood store, the Mill Valley

Market, located at 12 Corte Madera Ave. Lewis,
Sammy Hagar, Matt Dillon, Bonnie Raitt and Peter
Coyote have all been known to shop here, according
to employees.
Herbs and gvanola
For anthropologist-types, particularly amusing is
Roots and Legends (38 Miller Ave.), a store that sells
teas, roots, incense and all the essentials for those
who seek the way of herbal harmony.
Living Foods (149 Throckmorton Ave.) is also
worth a visit — if not for the organic crunchy
munch, at least for the colorful ambience. It's a
turn-of-the-century-style market, with knotty pine
walls and bright orange gourds piled high in the
windows. Browsing is as entertaining as buying;
j / who ever thought there were so many brands
of organic toothpaste?
Since the spirit, as well as the body, needs
food, as any Mill Valleyite would agree, an
organic picnic is a must — preferably including
a soy product — and the place to eat it is outside
under a tree, or by a stream.

Park yourself here
The Old Mill
Park is just a bit fur

ther down Throckmorton
Avenue. Aside from a jungle gym and a set of swings
that beckon to even the oldest-at-heart, the park
features several relics of local history.
There's an old saw mill reconstructed from the
1830s, when Mill Valley was first and foremost a mill
town, supplying cut wood to Yerba Buena — the small
city across the Bay — now known as San Francisco.
And there's also a gravity car that once formed
part of the Mount Tamalpais Railway, which served
as a playground for visiting San Franciscans at the
turn of the century. Twelve gravity cars were
attached to an engine and pulled to the top of the
mountain, where passengers marvelled at the vast
panorama of San Francisco and Marin County.
For the return trip, the gravity cars were unhooked
from the engine, so that individual groups could
drive themselves down the mountain at 12 m.p.h. —
the strictly enforced speed limit. The turn-of-the
century version of mountain biking, no doubt.
Stairmaster frenzy magnified
Old Mill Park has one other claim to feme: It's the
starting point of the annual Dipsea footrace, the
race that makes Ford Center-regulars look wimpy.
The Dipsea takes every fitness-obsessive inclination


of everyone in (
Marin and magnifies
them 1,000 times.

Measuring 7.6 miles long and consisting mostly of
steep stairs and poison-oak tangled trails, the
Dipsea is practically deified in Marin: there's a
Dipsea cafe, Dipsea T-shirts, a Dipsea movie
you'd think Spike Lee had something to do with it.
There's even an "opening day of Dipsea season" cer
emonial run in March — for a race that's not until
June. The stairs, which start from the park, are
worth a peek; one look and you'll get the gist of
what it's all about.

Biking
But you can enjoy the pleasures of sport in more
civilized ways, without climbing hundreds of stairs.
Mount Tarn is an endless network of trails, and the
birthplace of the mountain bike — which was
invented by Gary Fisher, Charles Kelley and Tom
Ritchey, all Marinites.
According to Kurt Ryan, a former mountain bike
racer from Marin, the earliest mountain bikes were
Schwinn Typhoons with 10-speed components.
"They [ Fisher, Kelley and Ritchey] were taking
street bikes with balloon tires, and racing them
around on the mountain," Ryan said. The first
mountain bike race was on Tarn's famous Repack
Trail, said Ryan. Some mountain bikes, such as the

Hoo Koo E Koo, are now named after

Tamalpais trails.
And hiking
Those same trails are

great for hiking too.
The best place to
start a hike on
Mount Tam is
from the Mountain
Home Inn, halfway
up the mountain
on Panoramic

Highway. Pick up a trail
map at the Depot in
downtown Mill Valley. |
The West Point Inn,
where train passengers
used to stop for a
drink or a home-cooked
meal, makes a good des

tination. .
Just over a
mile, the
hike takes you up the
chapparal-cov-

ered Matt
Davis Trail,

then over the tree-shaded
Nora Trail, which features
Marin's famous redwood

trees.
Back in the days of the
railroad, you could j

spend the night at The
West Pdint Inn for

$1, and eat for
$1.25. For $20 you
can still spend

the night in
one of the
eight

rooms or four
cabins, which
provide you with

beds, blankets,
kerosene lamps

and kitchen facilities. Call 388-
9955 to reserve a bed.

Soul-searching
Ever attended a Zen Buddhist

church service? Well, now's your chance.
Green

Gulch

(
Zen Center,
in a grassy

held oft of Highway 1,
offers Sunday programs of medi
tation instruction, followed by a
"public sitting," a lecture on the
relationship between Zen and

world events, and finally tea and a discussion. Lunch,
served for $5, is strictly vegetarian.

If the idea of an organized service doesn't
grab you, feel free to wander in the public
gardens or practice what looks like
Michael Jackson's moonwalk, a medita
tive technique they might teach you if
___ you're lucky.

And of course, you've got
to see Stinson Beach — complete
with surfers, picnic tables and

I barbecue pits, and a main strip

that boasts of nothing more
elegant than Ed's Superette
and the Parkside Cafe.

The other tourist hot spot is Muir Woods, where
the redwood trees are almost as tall as Hoover
Tower — and about 20 times as old.
One final point of interest is Muir Beach, a down
scale version of Stinson that's small and scenic — an
ideal place to contemplate the shapes of driftwood
and the meaning of life.
But don't leave out the little things that aren't list
ed in the guidebooks. Take at least one side trip to
Roots and Legends, the Sweetwater, Old Mill Park,
Living Foods .... Get a taste of the essence of Mill
Valley, in all its wealthy, New Agey, Zen-based,
organic loveableness.
Otherwise you might as well stay at the Wharf,
eating sourdough bread.
