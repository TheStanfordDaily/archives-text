# DJs return to CoHo Hip Hop

Live music is out, and DJs are back in at Hip Hop
Night.
After a brief but unsuccessful flirtation with live
music, the creators of Hip Hop Night have decided to re
turn it back to its original format, opting for fewer

events but hoping for larger crowds.
Hip Hop Night hit the Coffee House hard
last year, mixing sweaty bodies gyrating to
the newest sound with powerbook-toting
grad students. With a "club atmosphere," DJs
and hip hop music, "the first night... had

everybody dancing, everybody wet... we had

water dripping down the windows," said co-creator of
Hip Hop Night senior Jim Haljun.
This year, the attempt to bring live performers — some
of them up-and-coming rap groups — was not as well re
ceived as Dote and Haljun had hoped.
The organizers were able to bringto the event, at very lit
tle cost, live acts which usually charge audience members
$5 to $15 when performing elsewhere.

But some students who attended Hip

Hop Night this year claimed the perform
ers were inexperienced. "Hip hop is
about dance," said freshman Rob Gitin,
who frequents hip hop clubs in New
York. "It's hard to dance when you have

amateur MC's messing up the lyrics over the
beat It's hard to keep the rhythm."
The organizers, however, blamed the poor reception
on the Stanford campus's general ignorance about hip
hop. Students "think they know more than they actual
ly do when it comes to the real music that's being played

in the dubs," Haljun said.
Poor equipment quality — especially in the outdoor
venue — also detracted from the new format of Hip
Hop Night.
Hip Hop Night began last winter quarter when
Haljun, as Coffee House entertainment coordinator,
noticed that all the CoHo programming seemed "the

same."

. "The music was sort of this 'Sweet
Home Alabama' rock," Haljun said. The Cof
fee House "wasn't a place where a lot of differ
ent people felt comfortable. I was disappoint
ed in the lack of diversity."
Both organizers are quick to deny that Hip Hop

is a "black thing." "There were definitely more mem
bers of the African-American community than there
were [at the Coffee House] on any other night, but it had
everybody dancing," Dote said.
So what exactly is hip hop music? Originating with
New York street musicians who mixed eight-tracks in
Central Park, it is a mixture of African-American-
Cuban music. It differs from rap, they said, which orig
inated from Jamaican rhythms.
Usually, however, when people mention hip hop,
they mean the culture surrounding the music which,
Dote said, "includes rap, old school, Detroit techno
and dance hall" styles.
"People tend to move more interactively, more excit
ingly and with more energy than they would at your av
erage Platypus Rex party," Dote observed.

Kutmasta Kurt of Rapid Fire Productions will be spinning
at the Coffee House on Friday, Jan. 29. Hip Hop Night will
also he held on Friday, March 5.
