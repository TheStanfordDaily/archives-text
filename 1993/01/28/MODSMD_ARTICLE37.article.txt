# She has a vision of sound

"From the foothills to the bay... "
The well-known refrain of the Stan
fond Hymn strikes a familiar chord in
Amy Lieberman's memory. When
Gerhard Casper became Stanford's
new president, Lieberman got the
opportunity of her undergraduate
career — to conduct the Hymn for
his inauguration.
For Lieberman, a senior majoring
in music, the inauguration was both
her largest venue as a conductor and
a euphoric beginning to her final year
at Stanford.

"I wanted to
bring out the
nostalgia and
emotion in the
words [of the
Stanford
Hymn]," says
Lieberman.
Lieberman
was successful:
"The greatest
thing was after
the perfor
mance, when
some of the
singers came up
to me and told
me how they
choked up dur
ing 'From the
foothills to the
bay,'" she says
with a smile.
Lieberman
quickly dispels
the notion that

conducting is a frenzied display of
arm-waving. She demonstrates the
physical component of her skill by
tracing a triangle in the air, the move
ment a conductor makes when lead
ing a three-beat measure such as a
waltz.
1 icbcrman believes that the con
ductor is "the architect of sound,"
who brings musical notes to life. The
conductor must have not only an in
depth theoretical knowledge of
music but also a vision of what she
wants the piece to sound like.
A vision of sound? The seeming
contradiction in terms is what
Lieberman actually sees as her art,

saying she "looks for the colors and
sounds that I want to bring out of the
music" and often uses imagery rather
than technical terms when explain
ing to the performers what she wants.
When describing what she means
by the "colors" of music, Lieberman's
language takes an almost Proustian
turn: "Music creates an emotional
and visceral response in the audience.
[It] can take them back to another
time and all the colors, smells and im
ages associated with [that time]"
