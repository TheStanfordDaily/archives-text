# She has a vision of sound

### Molly Conroy Staff writer 
"From the foothills to the bay... "
The well-known refrain of the Stan
fond Hymn strikes a familiar chord in
Amy Lieberman's memory. When
Gerhard Casper became Stanford's
new president, Lieberman got the
opportunity of her undergraduate
career — to conduct the Hymn for
his inauguration.
For Lieberman, a senior majoring
in music, the inauguration was both
her largest venue as a conductor and
a euphoric beginning to her final year
at Stanford.

"I wanted to
bring out the
nostalgia and
emotion in the
words [of the
Stanford
Hymn]," says
Lieberman.
Lieberman
was successful:
"The greatest
thing was after
the perfor
mance, when
some of the
singers came up
to me and told
me how they
choked up dur
ing 'From the
foothills to the
bay,'" she says
with a smile.
Lieberman
quickly dispels
the notion that

conducting is a frenzied display of
arm-waving. She demonstrates the
physical component of her skill by
tracing a triangle in the air, the move
ment a conductor makes when lead
ing a three-beat measure such as a
waltz.
1 icbcrman believes that the con
ductor is "the architect of sound,"
who brings musical notes to life. The
conductor must have not only an in
depth theoretical knowledge of
music but also a vision of what she
wants the piece to sound like.
A vision of sound? The seeming
contradiction in terms is what
Lieberman actually sees as her art,

saying she "looks for the colors and
sounds that I want to bring out of the
music" and often uses imagery rather
than technical terms when explain
ing to the performers what she wants.
When describing what she means
by the "colors" of music, Lieberman's
language takes an almost Proustian
turn: "Music creates an emotional
and visceral response in the audience.
[It] can take them back to another
time and all the colors, smells and im
ages associated with [that time]"

March 2 in Memorial Church.
Symphony with her mother at age
five; after the trip, she announced her
desire to become a conductor. In the
same year, she started playing both
violin and piano.
In many ways, Lieberman's trans
formation from pianist to conductor
has been facilitated by the Music De
partment's emphasis on both the the
oretical and performing aspects of
music, which are brought together in
conducting.
She turned down the chance to
study piano at a more traditional
conservatory school because, she
says,"I didn't want to spend eight
hours a day in a rehearsal hall. I want-

Ed to study music in a more well
rounded environment."
But in discussing the opportuni
ties for female conductors in general,
Lieberman says, "When I tell some
people that I want to be a conductor,
they say, 'Good luck,' mostly referring
to the fact that I am a female."
The world of conducting, espe
cially orchestral conducting, is still "a
good old boys' network," she says, hy
pothesizing that "some musicians
don't know how to react to a female
conductor; [they're] not used to
being told what to do by a woman."
However, Lieberman believes that
opportunities for women in music
are greater today than at any time in
the past.
Lieberman envisions a future in
which she can both teach and con

duct in a university setting. She is am
bivalent about a future in the com
petitive international conducting
scene, where she acknowledges she
would be a "trailblazer."
"I don't want to have to change my
personality to be effective," says
Lieberman, referring to the brash ag
gressiveness commonly associated
with conductors.
Lieberman plans to continue her
packed schedule of studying, per
forming and conducting music. Her
immersion in the art is not only nec
essary for a musician, she says, but
also born of a feeling that her work is
never really over. "1 never leave the re
hearsal room with complete satisfac
tion. The only closure is after a per
formance," she says."I feel liberated
in performance."
