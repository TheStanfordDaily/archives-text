The eight-foot ball of carnivo
rous foam, known as Audrey 11,
will make its Stanford debut
tonight at the Eleanor Prosser Stu
dio.
"We've been trying to get this
show done for years. I think we've
done a very good job of it," said
Peter Commons, producer of"Lit
tle Shop of Horrors."
This production of "Little
Shop" is one of the largest of the
Ram's Head Special Projects,
under which Ram's Head sponsors
performances other than the fa
miliar Big Game Gaities, Winter
One Acts and Spring Musical.
Director Robert Nickel
promises that this is not merely an
imitation of the recent film version
featuring Rick Moranis and Steve
Martin. Nickel rewrote small por
tions of the dialogue to incorpo
rate "whatever we thought worked
best," said Commons. It is actually
closer to the off-Broadway musical
rendition in both story and struc
ture, while attempting to highlight
the strengths — if indeed there are
any —of the original 1960 film.
And a three-person chorus was
added "because we probably have
a bigger budget than [the off-
Broadway production] did,"
Commons said.

The show's performances in
the smaller venue of Prosser Stu
dio presented the production and
technical staff with both chal
lenges and new opportunities.
Seating is arranged along three
of the theater's four walls, so the
audience has a 270-degree view of
the stage. The difficulty lay in stag
ing the effects to make the illusion
of four people being eaten by a
giant plant appear plausible from
only five feet away.
"Because it's in such a small
space you really get the feel for it.
The audiencc is much more a part
of it here, instead of sitting so far
away on a stage as big as Mem
Aud," Commons said. This was
one of the reasons they opted to
produce "Little Shop" as a Special
Project rather than a Spring Show.
Perhaps the most impressive of
the show's technical feats is the
working of the Audrey 11. While
the cast is excited to see the audi
ence's reaction to the special ef
fects, senior Jason Mayland, the
booming voice of Audrey 11, is es
pecially enthusiastic because "it's
not often I get to have two women
handle my body."
Most of the special effects take
place on stage right — so that's the
place to avoid if you have a prob
lem with death.

The show's 12 performances will
run Jan 28-31 and Feb. 4-7. Tickets
are $7. Seating will be limited.
