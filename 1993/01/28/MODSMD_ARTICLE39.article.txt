# Life outside Stanford is tough
## 
### Tish Williams Editorial staff 
The drug pushers are scary. The drive-by's

are harrowing. The riff-raff in synthetic fab

ric shirts, feux-chinchilla

coats and leather

pants is blood-cur

dling. And the

coke at Max's
Opera Cafe is

always flat.
They say
Stanford stu
dents can't
survive in
the outside
world, but 1
do just fine at

the Stanford
Shopping Center.
No problem. It's
a cinch. This is the
real world, and it is
definitely doable. No

sales... okay. Screaming ba

bies. .. 1 can deal. Sixty-year-old

women in leggings and furry

sweaters, complemented with hip

boots... I'm getting a little sketched out,

but my valium prescription is holding up.

A mere Marguerite ride away, the Stanford
Shopping Center— that's upper-middle class for "mall" —
can be a painless testing ground for all those true-life skills
you're supposed to be picking up here at Stanford. Even
though you haven't quite crossed El Camino, you can get a
preview of what's in store east of Eden.
In our little outdoor paradise, the harsh trauma of life
sets in with all too much frequency. Your favorite sidewalk
cafe runs out of peach Crystal Geysers. There are kiwi
shortages at the exotic fruit store. A rude pedestrian bumps
you into the frog fountain by Fresh Choice, ruining your
Corinthian leather suit. Life's not all Brie and baguettes.
And you finally realize that you aren't sitting in Paris,
and that quaint apartment you're staring at will never
house a passionate Frenchman. It's just a pastel painting de
signed for yuppie pleasure... a simulated truth.
Try and cope with the grace of an adult as the two-di
mensional door won't open.
Perhaps you think there's no danger in the mall. What
about McDonald's? Have you ever seen the Oxy-lO poster
kids that hang out there? With a quick remark about their
Stoopid brand sock hats, and how they can't even spell stu
pid, you can get laid out on the floor, impaled by a Mayor
McCheese highchair.
Life's not risk-free.
You can relive your dreams of debutantedom in Banana
Republic, as you fail to be couth enough to buy the khaki

clothing and once again in your pitiful life fall short of the
upper crust, forced to shop in the Gap along with everyone
else. Buying the same intriguing forest green, classic-fit-for

roamy-hips jeans, that have intrigued every

other 15-30-year-old in America, you

are doomed to mediocrity and
insignificance in a world of re
dundancy.

But look up, the

record store is a
place for you to
bust out. Are
you a Garth
Brooks person?
Or an Ice Cube

person?
An In
spiral-

carpets per
son? Don't

tell me.. .you're
one of those
classic rock
mutants.
Actually,

your individual tastes

7
don't even matter, as the only tapes
offered are Whitney Houston's ex

cruciating Bodyguard single and sale com

pilations of the Bangles and Fleetwood Mac.

What a paltry existence this is.
If you'd like to test your ability to hold an intelligent con
versation about an unknown topic, now that you are a bud
ding intellectual. . .hop on over to the funky-imported-art
pieces-for-under-$ 100 store, where you can roughly fondle
large paper mach£ African masks to the salesperson's dis
may.
While detailing your complete knowledge of Franz
Fanon and Algeria, courtesy of CIV— discussing the
tragedies of European hegemony— I'm sure the grimacing
worker will be as thrilled and impressed as anyone on the
streets of New York, awed by your trivial knowledge and as
tute memorization. As you go around the store spouting
lines from "The Heart of Darkness," your educated pres
ence will undoubtedly be appreciated, at least before mall
security carts you away.
Finally, as you ponder the loss of your youth, others will
be amused as you find yourself stuck after attempting to
pass through the 4-foot door at the Imaginarium.
And no one will risk scuffing their European shoes to
dislodge you from the door.
As you try to figure out how to get your bike out of the
intricate locking system and head out exhaustedly into the
bike lane of life back to campus, you are in no means sur
prised as a middle-aged investment banker in a shiny, new
BMW cuts you off, throwing you head over heels onto the
concrete.
This too shall pass.
