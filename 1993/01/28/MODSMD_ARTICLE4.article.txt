# Violence in East Palo Alto doesn't deter tutors
## 
### Lindsey Marcus Staff writer 
Living on Stanford's green, shel
tered campus, it is easy to forget that
the city adjacent to affluent Palo Alto
has the highest murder rate per capita
in the nation.
But the fact that East Palo Alto is a
violent city hasn't deterred the many
Stanford students who volunteer
there; they say they do not feel at risk
and have no intention of decreasing
their involvement in the city because of
the high crime rate.
East Palo Alto, a city of 24,000, re
ported 42 killings in 1992. This figure
translates to 175 murders for every
100,000 people, a rate which tops even
Washington, D.C.'s severe homicide
statistics.
The situation is so extreme, in fact,
that Charlie Mae Knight, superinten
dent of the Ravenswood City Elemen
tary School District, suggested two
weeks ago that the district offer 24-
hour emergency medical coverage and
life insurance for students. This would

help parents pay for their children's
burials if they are killed. Last year, five
of the district's 4,200 students died.
According to Anne Takemoto, pro
gram coordinator for school programs at
the Haas Center for Public Service,
about 400 Stanford students participate
in some kind of volunteer work with stu
dents from East Palo Alto through more
than 10 different organizations.
Takemoto said safety has not been a
problems with volunteers in the
Ravenswood-Stanford Tutoring Pro
gram, in which about 100 Stanford stu
dents tutor third through sixth graders
in the Ravenswood system twice a week.
"Most everyone has hesitations be
fore they go, but we carpool to the
schools during the day, so there really
is no problem," she said.
She said the only time tutoring was
suspended was the day after the Rod
ney King verdict was announced be
cause there were "rumors."
But for the most part, volunteers ex
press little reservation about venturing
into Palo Alto's violent next door
neighbor.

For instance, sophomore Jessie
Levine, who coordinates a tutoring pro
gram based at Castano School in East
Palo Alto said that since the work ends
by 2:30 p.m. every day, there is no need
to be concerned about safety.
"People drive to the school in
groups, and they wouldn't volunteer if
they felt unsafe," she said.
Senior Valerie Powell, who has vol
unteered in East Palo Alto for three
years, said she hasn't seen the danger
that the numbers suggest.
"The statistics boggle your mind,
but I haven't seen any violence with
kids. I've never talked to kids about it,
and it's not apparent in the class
rooms," she said.
Senior Paula Estrada had not wit
nessed any violence in her work with
Barrio Assistance, a program in which
East Palo Alto students come to Stan
ford on Saturdays.
But last fall when she was dropping
off the children for a Halloween party,
a group of teenagers surrounded the
van and one of the boys jumped on it.
She said the van door opened, but the

boy had apparently fallen ofT.
"That incident shook me up," she
said. "I used to think of (East Palo Alto 1
as just any neighborhood, but that
made me realize that it's not so safe."
Junior Joi Spencer, volunteer coor
dinator for the Black Community Ser
vices Center, attributes the problems
in East Palo Alto to idleness.
Spencer acts as coordinator for the
Nia (meaning "purpose" in Swahili)
program, which tutors African-Ameri
can students at Menlo-Atherton High
School in east Menlo Park. Spencer
said the dropout rate among African-
American students at the school is 60
percent.
"There is no high school in East Palo
Alto and it's a travesty," she said. "The
problem is from our own lack of doing."
Spencer added that the tutors in the
program do not feel threatened.
"The kids want your help," she said.
"There are a lot of problems in East
Palo Alto, and one problem is that peo
ple don't see the need. It's not so much
the danger, it's about time and com
mitment."
