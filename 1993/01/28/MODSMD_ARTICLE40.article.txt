A naked John wrapped around a black-clad
Yoko. Whoopi submerged in a milk-filled tub.
Rosanne and lots of mud. These photographs have
come to symbolize a generation. These pho
tographs could only have been captured by Annie
Leibovitz.
From now until March 14, the Ansel Adams
Center in San Francisco will be featuring "Annie
Leibovitz Photographs 1970-1990." This is the first
ever comprehensive exhibit of Leibovitz's work
and will contain more than 120 pieces: from her
early days with Rolling Stone magazine to her re
cent ad campaign for American Express. Lei
bovitz's portraits of celebrities depict the workings
of popular culture in such a way as to make her
photography's living goddess.
The Ansel Adams Center is located at 250
Fourth Street in San Francisco and is open Tues
day through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call
(415) 495-7000 for more information.
