"Poland in Transition 1989-1992," a photogra
phy exhibit documenting political upheaval, will
be on display in the Herbert Hoover Memorial
Pavilion until Feb 16. The photographs are taken
from "Gazeta Wyborcza" a newspaper rooted in
the underground press movement that has since
become one of Europe's most respected papers.
Some of the earlier photos were taken by ama
teurs involved in the political activist movement of
Poland. The exhibit charts their rise from under
ground status to creators of a new independent
press The Exhibition Pavilion is located next to the
Hoover Tower.
