They call it hippie crack. I call it just plain
silly.
People at Dead shows should be staring at
the shapes of the clouds, even if it's long past
sunset. They should be gnawing on bitter
mushrooms and talking about Emerson.
It doesn't feel right to see Dead Heads
twitching, trying to grab hold of large metal
canisters. Sure they can be recycled, but it's too

serious, too '90s, too, if you will, "Karina."
LSD may be a dangerous unnatural chem
ical mixed in enormous vats, but at least it
was touted by a crazy doctor from Harvard.
Nitrous oxide is used by dentists. And
what's cool about dentists?
Sure it's a depression era, and, sure we're
in that fourth, final, chaotic stage Vico
warned us about, but, damnit, hippies

shouldn't be selling their bodies for drugs.
Not without a smile on their face.
So next time you're with your friends and
Stud whips a 12-pound tank of laughing gas
out of his backback, just say, "No. Whip-its
are for nerds." Better uncool than slumped
over the Redi Whip section at Safeway.
