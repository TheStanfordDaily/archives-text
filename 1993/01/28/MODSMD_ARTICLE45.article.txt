# An ode: Take my columns, please
## 
### 
I NEVER GET LAID. Never. Not
after fraternity parties, not
after hours of talking to fresh
women on my double bed, not
even after expensive dinners with
my mother.
At one time, my penis gave me
great pleasure. I used to sleep in a
fetal position so 1 could stare at it
while 1 slept. I used to compete
against it in Trouble. I used to play
fully tease it by mumbling

"Durkheim" and imagining the
labor divided between two women
wearing lycra ...

STOP. IF YOU FINISH BEFORE
TIME IS CALLED, YOU MAY
REREAD THIS SECTION ONLY.
YOU MAY ALSO STARE AT MY
PICTURE, BUT THAT IS ALL.
Help.
I have become a parody of my
self. And it's not even a good paro
dy, like Jack Nicholson's or Up
With People's. No, I have created a
persona that I've been trying to
force myself into, whether I like
him or not. And, to be honest, I
don't think I do — particularly
when he makes those unsettling
jokes about my mother.
When I started writing columns
two-and-a-half years ago, I was on
a mission. A mission to force
everyone to listen to me, even if I
didn't have anything more to say
than "Dad always told me not to
jerk around during my college
years."
It's not like I had some giant
multicultural ax to grind — like
reparations for the unlicensed use
of inappropriate Native American
words to name our states. Not to
mention that French fiasco with
the "Grand Tetons." STOP.
All I wanted from you, is to sit
there like the mindless cattle you
are and let me rip things from the
back of your memory and careless
ly strew them where they don't be
long. And I wanted you to thank
me for it.
But now what I write here each
week is nothing more than a des
perate attempt to copy a persona. A
persona which got a positive reac
tion, some attention and to third
base with a sophomore who was

taller than me. Although I'm still
not sure what exactly third base is.
STOP.
Each week, less of what I think
goes in to the batter, and more of
what I'm expected to write. A penis
joke here. A young-budding-ac
tress-at-Stanford joke there. And
always work in threes. Worked for
Dante, it'll work for me.
And, if I take a step back, 1 real
ize that in the same way 1 lost con
trol of my writing, I lost control of
myself.
A long time ago, I think it was
eighth grade, and I think it had
something to do with Kelly Mack
getting breasts, I found I could get
attention by being funny, feigning
irreverence and showing people
my "big scar." Of course, then Mara
showed me her "tattoo" and my
parents made me change schools.
STOP.
It was so nice to have an identi
ty, even if it wasn't completely my
own, that I was willing to sacrifice
the freedom to decide what I want
to say at each moment. And I was
willing to do it long before I was
lucid about my decision.
But now all I want is my writing
back.
To be honest, I generally like this
persona guy I created. He makes
me laugh. He seems likeable in that
he never gets any. Just like me.
STOP.
But sometimes, he's so antithet
ical to what I think and feel, he
makes me laugh a little too hard
and then everyone stares at me and
I have to spit the part of the dead
bird I had eaten back on the
ground.
It happens all the time. "You're
in the Band." "You're Phi Beta
Kappa." "You got a job at Bain."
And that's what you'll become. Es
pecially if you work for Bain.
Because your new identity is just
another blanket to wrap around
your Linus-like insecurity. Sort of
like what Pepsi is trying to do with
that naturally "clear" soda thing. I
don't trust it. Not as long as I know
that the cola bean is brown.
But not me. I will not be my own
death through my every breath.
There's nothing more trite than
writing a column about writing a
column. Except, maybe, writing
about not getting laid.
I give this space back to you.
Now do something with it.

Joel Stein was just scaring you, kids.
His column will reappear, like a
phoenix reborn, or a sitcom dragged
up out of the vaults and shoveaon
stage in a musical comedy, some
where in the paper next week. Al
most makes you want to wake up for
all your 9 a.m.s.
