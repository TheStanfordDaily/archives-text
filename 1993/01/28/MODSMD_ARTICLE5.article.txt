# Student singer contests firing
## 
### Elisabeth Witchel Staff writer 
George Shepherd's career as the anthem
singer for the Department of Athletics has
ended on a bad note.
Shepherd claims that a letter he wrote last
January criticizing the high salary of head foot
ball Bill Walsh has led to a decision not to invite
him back to sing at basketball and baseball
games this year.
Athletics Department officials, however,
maintain that the letter has nothing to do with
it, and say they eventually plan to invite Shep
herd back to sing if they have an opening.
Now a third-year economics graduate stu
dent, Shepherd began his stint as anthem singer
when he volunteered at several Stanford home
baseball games in the spring of 1991.
Shepherd said he was "thanked repeatedly"
