# Student singer contests firing
## 
### Elisabeth Witchel Staff writer 
George Shepherd's career as the anthem
singer for the Department of Athletics has
ended on a bad note.
Shepherd claims that a letter he wrote last
January criticizing the high salary of head foot
ball Bill Walsh has led to a decision not to invite
him back to sing at basketball and baseball
games this year.
Athletics Department officials, however,
maintain that the letter has nothing to do with
it, and say they eventually plan to invite Shep
herd back to sing if they have an opening.
Now a third-year economics graduate stu
dent, Shepherd began his stint as anthem singer
when he volunteered at several Stanford home
baseball games in the spring of 1991.
Shepherd said he was "thanked repeatedly"
by Athletics Department officials,
and was invited back to perform at
about four women's basketball
games and "as many baseball
games as I could schedule."
But in the meantime, Shepherd
had written a letter to The Daily
criticizing the University's decision
to cut its graduate music perfor
mance program while hiring Walsh
for a reported $350,000 salary. The
letter appeared Jan. 16, 1992.
That afternoon, Shepherd
called the Athletics Department to
verify his next game and was told

on the phone that he was no longer
permitted to sing the anthem.
Shepherd was informed that, "the
department had decided that
because you wrote the letter to the
editor, you are not permitted to
sing the national anthem at any
further Stanford games," he said.
But Jim Brungard, director of
sports marketing, said in an inter
view that the letter had nothing to
do with the decision not to ask
Shepherd back this year. "I never
even read it," Brungard said.
Shepherd said he contacted
Law School Prof. Robert Weisberg,
a friend of his, the day after the let
ter was published, for advice. Weis
berg spoke with then-University
President Donald Kennedy that

day, and showed him the letter.
In reference to the Athletics
Department, Weisberg recalls that
Kennedy said, "in this business
you have to have thicker skin."
Weisberg says that Kennedy told
him he would look into it.
Later that day, Shepherd was
offered his position back by Athlet
ic Director Ted Leland. Shepherd
also received a written apology
from Brungard extending the
department's "most sincere apolo
gy for last week's misunderstand
ing concerning your article."
Shepherd sang throughout last
year; however, his request in July
to sing for the upcoming season
went unacknowledged. Several let
ters and phone calls to Brungard

were unanswered, Shepherd said.
After sending a letter to Brun
gard last month, Shepherd said he
received a phone call from some
one in the department who said he
would be contacted after Winter
Break, but he has not heard any
thing further.
Shepherd said he feels the Ath
letics Department's decision not
to ask him back to sing is an
attempt to "punish me for exer
cising my rights."
But Brungard said there have
simply been no openings yet this
year. The department, he said,
prefers "to have the band perform
the anthem when available and so
far this year there haven't been
any scheduling conflicts."
