## Sophomore playwright stops out for the year to write his first book at home 
### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Many people dream of writing
"The Great American Novel" 20
years down the line after finals,
job applications and the hectic
pace of student are out of the way.
Sophomore Gabriel Tissian
couldn't wait 20 years.
"I told |my parents| I needed to
get back into prose and under
stand who I was as a writer," said
Tissian, who has stopped out for a
year to work on a novel at home in
Philadelphia.
Although he has already writ
ten four one-acts and two full
length plays, Tissian says drama
was just the tip of the iceberg.
"I don't feel I've ever proven
myself in prose," explained Tiss
ian, whose Winter One Act,
"Night Baseball," was chosen to
compete in the American College
Theater Festival.
While Tissian was mum on the
subject of his novel, and in fact
only shows his prose to his father,
he did discuss the reasons behind
his decision to stop out.

"I'm writing my first novel, but
it's more about understanding my
writing and figuring out what I
wanted to say," said Tissian, an
English major with a creative
writing emphasis. "All these ques
tions were floating around in my
mind and I didn't think I could
stay at Stanford if I didn't resolve
these questions."
At home nowadays, Tissian
gets up at noon, goes through the
shave-shower-breakfast routine,
and takes a brisk walk while he
brainstorms his writing ideas for
the day."The two things that are
most important to me are charac
ters, particularly characters that
are outcasts in society, and also
urban settings," said Tissian, who
writes at least three hours a day.
Fortunately for Tissian, his
parents are more than supportive
of his decision to take time off
from academics. "When I told
them I needed to get back into
prose to develop my voice and style
of writing, they definitely support
ed me," he said, adding that they
didn't care how he structured his
college education as long as he
was happy.
"In my freshman year at Stan
ford, I felt I didn't have the breath
ing room to even think about them
(ideas for writing)," he said. "I just
wasn't happy because I didn't have
time to write."
Although Tissian doesn't have
an official writing mentor, he
names Hemingway, Gabriel Gar
cia Marquez and Wallace Stegner
as strong influences.
It was Stegner's support of the

creative writing program that ini
tially attracted Tissian to Stan
ford.
Linda Paulson, a lecturer in
the Humanities and Sciences Pro
grams, said Tissian "manages to
advance a plot that really holds
back information yet presents the
tension of the situation."
"I always fantasized when I
was a kid," said Tissian. "Dream
ing up people, that is essentially
what I love; writing really comes
down to being able to create real
people within an artistic frame
work," he said, adding that there
were no doubts in his mind as to
his future as a writer. "The ques
tion is not the will for me, it's the
way."
