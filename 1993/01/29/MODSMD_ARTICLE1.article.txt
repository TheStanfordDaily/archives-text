# Meinhold speaks in Larkin as gay ban struck down
## 
### Colleen Krueger Grace Lee Staff writers with AP wire reports 
A federal judge struck down as unconstitu
tional the Pentagon's ban on gays in the mili
tary yesterday, ordering naval Petty Officer
Keith Meinhold permanently reinstated.
Meinhold, who spoke at Larkin lounge
last night, said he was "ecstatic" about the
ruling and was confident that the military
would be able to comply with it.
Although the military can appeal the rul
ing, Meinhold said, "It's in the military and
the taxpayer's best interest to let the deci
sion stand."
"I don't think there'll be any problems
making it a smooth and easy transition" to al
lowing gays in the military, Meinhold added.
Meinhold, 30, a 12-year Navy veteran,
was honorably discharged from the Navy in
August after disclosing his homosexuality
on national television.
U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr., in a
ruling that affects all branches of the mili
tary, said the military's policy on gays vio
lated the Constitution's guarantee of equal
protection.
"Gays and lesbians have served, and con
tinue to serve the United States military
with honor, pride, dignity and loyalty,"
Hatter wrote.

"The Department of Defense is perma
nently enjoined from discharging or deny
ing enlistment to any person based on sexu
al orientation in the absence of sexual con
duct, which interferes with the military
mission of the armed forces of the United
States," wrote Hatter, who issued a tempo
rary injunction in November ordering the
Navy to reinstate Meinhold.
Meinhold, who lives in Palo Alto, re
turned to active duty Nov. 12 as an anti-sub
marine warfare operator at Moffett Naval
Air Station south of Palo Alto.
At last night's Larkin presentation,
Meinhold spoke to an overflow crowd about
his experiences as a publicly gay naval officer
fighting the ii.ilitary policy on homosexuals.
Meinhold said he sees his efforts to end
the ban as his "sworn duty to stop letting
the military be hurt by this policy."
"I'm doing this for the military," he
added.
"We will have a much larger percentage
of top quality people in the service that we
can retain without any fear of retribution,"
Meinhold said, speculating about the rul
ing's repercussions.
"Now we need to work on a way to best
integrate gays and lesbians into the ser
vice," he added.

Navy Petty Officer Keith Meinhold speaks in the Larkin lounge last night, hours after a U.S. District Judge struck down the
military ban on homosexuals and permanently reinstated him.
President Clinton and Senate
Democrats discussed ways to
defuse Congress' intense opposi
tion to Clinton's plan to suspend
the ban. They hope to build sup
port for the move during the six
month interim before a final exec
utive order is issued.
Clinton may announce an
interim order today halting the
discharge of homosexuals.
Referring to Clinton's efforts,
Meinhold said, "I support the
President 100 percent."
Meinhold expressed a strong
desire to participate in upcoming
Congressional hearings about
gays in the military, scheduled for
March: "I hope I will have some
sort of input because I think I
have a lot to say."
Meinhold said he had been able
to successfully take on the mili
tary because of his determination.
"One thing the military taught
me was if I had an objective; to go
for that objective no matter what
it took."
"The Navy gave me a lot of

self-confidence — they built this
monster," said Meinhold.
While Meinhold was jubilant
over the ruling and its potential to
allow gays to serve in active duty,
lesbian naval reserve Lieutenant
Zoe Dunning, a student at Stan
ford's Graduate School of Busi
ness, said she is awaiting Clinton's
formal action lifting the ban.
She said Meinhold's victory
will have little effect on her imme
diate fate, since she has not been
formally been discharged from
service yet.
Although he didn't attend
Stanford, Meinhold has been an
active member of the campus gay
community, attending discussion
groups at the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center.
"The support I've gotten at
the Fire Truck House has been
wonderful," said Meinhold.
He also complimented Stanford
on the recent passage of the domes
tic partners bill, which extended
spousal benefits to partners of gay
and lesbian staff members. The
University enacted a similar policy
for all domestic partners of stu
dents — regardless of sexual orien
tation — two years ago.
Television crews and reporters

descended on Larkin last night to
get the activist sailor's first public
reaction to the ruling. Camera
men rolled film throughout the
hour-long student discussion, and
conducted several interviews
afterward.
In a press conference just as he
arrived on campus, Meinhold
summarized the ruling by saying
"The policy that discriminates
against someone just because of
who they are is unconstitutional."
Describing the Joint Chiefs of
Staff as "openly homophobic,"
Meinhold stressed that formally
lifting the ban against homosexu
als in the military is both impera
tive and inevitable.
"I've been public (about my
homosexuality) because it's time
for a gay person to describe what
it's like to be gay," said Meinhold.
Meinhold said the battle to
regain his job has taken a person
al toll. "It's kind of hard to feel
positive about the military in gen
eral" these days, he said.
Meinhold said most of his fel
low sailors at Moffett just want
the case to go away. "They are
sick of the whole issue and the big
deal everybody is making of it,"
he said.

me was if I had an objective; to go
for that objective no matter what
it took."
"The Navy gave me a lot of

self-confidence — they built this
monster," said Meinhold.
While Meinhold was jubilant
over the ruling and its potential to
allow gays to serve in active duty,
lesbian naval reserve Lieutenant
Zoe Dunning, a student at Stan
ford's Graduate School of Busi
ness, said she is awaiting Clinton's
formal action lifting the ban.
She said Meinhold's victory
will have little effect on her imme
diate fate, since she has not been
formally been discharged from
service yet.
Although he didn't attend
Stanford, Meinhold has been an
active member of the campus gay
community, attending discussion
groups at the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center.
"The support I've gotten at
the Fire Truck House has been
wonderful," said Meinhold.
He also complimented Stanford
on the recent passage of the domes
tic partners bill, which extended
spousal benefits to partners of gay
and lesbian staff members. The
University enacted a similar policy
for all domestic partners of stu
dents — regardless of sexual orien
tation — two years ago.
Television crews and reporters

descended on Larkin last night to
get the activist sailor's first public
reaction to the ruling. Camera
men rolled film throughout the
hour-long student discussion, and
conducted several interviews
afterward.
In a press conference just as he
arrived on campus, Meinhold
summarized the ruling by saying
"The policy that discriminates
against someone just because of
who they are is unconstitutional."
Describing the Joint Chiefs of
Staff as "openly homophobic,"
Meinhold stressed that formally
lifting the ban against homosexu
als in the military is both impera
tive and inevitable.
"I've been public (about my
homosexuality) because it's time
for a gay person to describe what
it's like to be gay," said Meinhold.
Meinhold said the battle to
regain his job has taken a person
al toll. "It's kind of hard to feel
positive about the military in gen
eral" these days, he said.
Meinhold said most of his fel
low sailors at Moffett just want
the case to go away. "They are
sick of the whole issue and the big
deal everybody is making of it,"
he said.
A federal judge struck down as unconstitu
tional the Pentagon's ban on gays in the mili
tary yesterday, ordering naval Petty Officer
Keith Meinhold permanently reinstated.
Meinhold, who spoke at Larkin lounge
last night, said he was "ecstatic" about the
ruling and was confident that the military
would be able to comply with it.
Although the military can appeal the rul
ing, Meinhold said, "It's in the military and
the taxpayer's best interest to let the deci
sion stand."
"I don't think there'll be any problems
making it a smooth and easy transition" to al
lowing gays in the military, Meinhold added.
Meinhold, 30, a 12-year Navy veteran,
was honorably discharged from the Navy in
August after disclosing his homosexuality
on national television.
U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr., in a
ruling that affects all branches of the mili
tary, said the military's policy on gays vio
lated the Constitution's guarantee of equal
protection.
"Gays and lesbians have served, and con
tinue to serve the United States military
with honor, pride, dignity and loyalty,"
Hatter wrote.

"The Department of Defense is perma
nently enjoined from discharging or deny
ing enlistment to any person based on sexu
al orientation in the absence of sexual con
duct, which interferes with the military
mission of the armed forces of the United
States," wrote Hatter, who issued a tempo
rary injunction in November ordering the
Navy to reinstate Meinhold.
Meinhold, who lives in Palo Alto, re
turned to active duty Nov. 12 as an anti-sub
marine warfare operator at Moffett Naval
Air Station south of Palo Alto.
At last night's Larkin presentation,
Meinhold spoke to an overflow crowd about
his experiences as a publicly gay naval officer
fighting the ii.ilitary policy on homosexuals.
Meinhold said he sees his efforts to end
the ban as his "sworn duty to stop letting
the military be hurt by this policy."
"I'm doing this for the military," he
added.
"We will have a much larger percentage
of top quality people in the service that we
can retain without any fear of retribution,"
Meinhold said, speculating about the rul
ing's repercussions.
"Now we need to work on a way to best
integrate gays and lesbians into the ser
vice," he added.
As Meinhold celebrated his victory,


Victor Cheng — Daily
Navy Petty Officer Keith Meinhold speaks in the Larkin lounge last night, hours after a U.S. District Judge struck down the
military ban on homosexuals and permanently reinstated him.
President Clinton and Senate
Democrats discussed ways to
defuse Congress' intense opposi
tion to Clinton's plan to suspend
the ban. They hope to build sup
port for the move during the six
month interim before a final exec
utive order is issued.
Clinton may announce an
interim order today halting the
discharge of homosexuals.
Referring to Clinton's efforts,
Meinhold said, "I support the
President 100 percent."
Meinhold expressed a strong
desire to participate in upcoming
Congressional hearings about
gays in the military, scheduled for
March: "I hope I will have some
sort of input because I think I
have a lot to say."
Meinhold said he had been able
to successfully take on the mili
tary because of his determination.
"One thing the military taught
me was if I had an objective; to go
for that objective no matter what
it took."
"The Navy gave me a lot of

self-confidence — they built this
monster," said Meinhold.
