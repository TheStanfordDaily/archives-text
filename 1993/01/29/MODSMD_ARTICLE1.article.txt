A federal judge struck down as unconstitu
tional the Pentagon's ban on gays in the mili
tary yesterday, ordering naval Petty Officer
Keith Meinhold permanently reinstated.
Meinhold, who spoke at Larkin lounge
last night, said he was "ecstatic" about the
ruling and was confident that the military
would be able to comply with it.
Although the military can appeal the rul
ing, Meinhold said, "It's in the military and
the taxpayer's best interest to let the deci
sion stand."
"I don't think there'll be any problems
making it a smooth and easy transition" to al
lowing gays in the military, Meinhold added.
Meinhold, 30, a 12-year Navy veteran,
was honorably discharged from the Navy in
August after disclosing his homosexuality
on national television.
U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr., in a
ruling that affects all branches of the mili
tary, said the military's policy on gays vio
lated the Constitution's guarantee of equal
protection.
"Gays and lesbians have served, and con
tinue to serve the United States military
with honor, pride, dignity and loyalty,"
Hatter wrote.

"The Department of Defense is perma
nently enjoined from discharging or deny
ing enlistment to any person based on sexu
al orientation in the absence of sexual con
duct, which interferes with the military
mission of the armed forces of the United
States," wrote Hatter, who issued a tempo
rary injunction in November ordering the
Navy to reinstate Meinhold.
Meinhold, who lives in Palo Alto, re
turned to active duty Nov. 12 as an anti-sub
marine warfare operator at Moffett Naval
Air Station south of Palo Alto.
At last night's Larkin presentation,
Meinhold spoke to an overflow crowd about
his experiences as a publicly gay naval officer
fighting the ii.ilitary policy on homosexuals.
Meinhold said he sees his efforts to end
the ban as his "sworn duty to stop letting
the military be hurt by this policy."
"I'm doing this for the military," he
added.
"We will have a much larger percentage
of top quality people in the service that we
can retain without any fear of retribution,"
Meinhold said, speculating about the rul
ing's repercussions.
"Now we need to work on a way to best
integrate gays and lesbians into the ser
vice," he added.
