# 'Independent' a relative term for different college papers
## 
### Juthymas Harntha Senior staff writer 
On the entry form for its annual awards,
the Associated Collegiate Press doesn't ask
college newspaper editors if their publica
tions are independent from their universi
ties. It's just too difficult to explain with a
simple yes or no.
When first asked if their newspaper is
"independent," most collegiate editors
adamantly maintain that in no way does
their university's administration interfere
with the editorial content of their paper.
But that's where the similarities end.
Editors at the The Harvard Crimson, for
instance, say they are only dependent on
the university for the dorm keys they needs
for delivery, while at Houston Community
College, the campus newspaper is basically
funded by the school.
So in technical terms, independence
varies quite a bit: some newspapers are fully
or partially supported by the university,
some have faculty advisors, some use uni
versity buildings and a few, like The Daily,
have become independent corporations.
When a paper is financially controlled by
a university, there is always some chance
that the administration might intervene.
For example, at Houston Community
College, changes were made once after the
newspaper already had gone to the print
shop, according to Napoleon Johnson, the
paper's advisor.
In the incident, which took place before
Johnson arrived, the university took out a
phrase that described the campus police
negatively.
But even with newspapers that are basi
cally self-sufficient, problems can arise.
At UC-Irvine, The New University gets
free rent and electricity from the university,
an arrangement that sometimes has creat
ed tense situations for the paper's editors.
"For the most part, they can't come right
out. .. and threaten to kick us out of the
building," said Editor in Chief Jill Bradbury.
However, there have been times when
the university has wielded its power, she
said. A few years ago, for instance, the editor
in chief was pressured into letting an admin
istrator run a commentary in the paper.
But when deciding which articles will
run in the paper, Bradbury said she doesn't

consider the possibility that UC-Irvine may
force the paper out of the building.
However, she said that threat "gets
alluded to" in dealings with the adminis
tration. "It's kind of like a game," she said.
Subtle pressure in the background is
especially difficult when the administra
tion's point of view is well known.
While maintaining that there is no cen
sorship or prior restraint at his school, Tad
Walsh, the editor of Brigham Young Uni
versity's campus paper, said the editors do
consider the views of the church that runs
the university.
"We don't run pro-abortion columns,"
he said. According to Walsh, the university
administration came down heavily on the
paper after it accidentally ran an ad for a
National Organization for Women lecture
about abortion.
On the other hand, papers that are tech
nically dependent on the university can
sometimes be very editorially independent.
The Minnesota Daily, the student-run
paper at the University of Minnesota, Twin
Falls, is one example.
According to editor Blake Morrison, the
newspaper sues the university about once a
year over anything from documents the
school won't release to meetings reporters
aren't allowed to attend.
"We keep suing them and that keeps us
independent," Morrison said.
Although editors generally like to be as
separate as possible from their universities,
being financially independent often means
being financially insecure.
For collegiate and professional newspa
pers, the recent economic slowdown has
resulted in smaller issues and tightened pay
rolls, as well as caused a few papers to go out
of print. In such times, the university's will
ingness to let newspapers be independent
may seem less an act championing free
speech than a pragmatic financial move.
When UC-Berkeley's Daily Californian
was having severe money problems last
year, the university stayed out instead of
intervening.
The paper was a liability that the uni
versity was going to let "sink or swim," said
former editor Virginia Matzek.
"They had no desire to get back into
publishing us," she said. "They can't afford
it with their budget cuts."
