Welfare law overturned
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - A
judge overturned a new California law
yesterday that cut welfare benefits for
people who move here from other states.
U.S. District Court Judge David Levi
ruled the residency requirement illegally
singled out newcomers, violating their
constitutional rights to equal protection
and to travel.
"If the purpose of the measure is to
deter migration by poor people in the state,
and it appears that this may be the pur
pose, then the measure must be unconsti
tutional," Levi wrote in his ruling.
The law, which took effect Dec. 1, pro
vided that applicants who lived in Cali
fornia less than a year would receive wel
fare benefits at the same level they
would have received in their previous
states, instead of at California's general
ly higher level.
