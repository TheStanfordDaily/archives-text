# King 'willfully' deprived of rights
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” The govern
ment outlined its case against four
police officers in the beating of black
motorist Rodney King in a 35-page trial
memorandum yesterday that stressed
alleged proof the officers acted "willful
ly" to deprive King of his civil rights.
"The government expects to present
evidence that establishes willful con
duct," said the memorandum filed by
federal prosecutors.
"That evidence includes the character
and duration of the beating of Rodney
King, the defendants' misleading
reports, the defendants' post-incident
statements and MDT (mobile digital
transmission) messages, and defendant
Briseno's perjury during the state trial."
The prosecutors' reference to testi
mony by Officer Theodore Briseno in
last spring's Simi Valley trial indicated
the government will press for conviction
of Briseno more strenuously than state
prosecutors did.
Briseno testified against his co-defen
dants in the state trial, and thus was
spared extensive cross-examination by
prosecutors.
But the government's reference to

perjury shows federal prosecutors reject
Briseno's claim during the state trial
that he was the lone officer trying to pro
tect King from harm during the beating.
Briseno was seen on videotape stomping
the back of King's neck with his foot, but
he said that was intended merely to keep
King still so the other officers would not
continue beating him.
Briseno is charged along with officers
Laurence Powell and Timothy Wind and
Sgt. Stacey Koon in the March 3, 1991
beating.
The officers were acquitted of most
charges in the state case, triggering
deadly riots in Los Angeles. The four
were later charged under federal law.
The federal prosecutors acknowl
edged in their brief that they must
prove intentional acts to deprive King of
his civil rights.
"The fact that the defendants were
not thinking in constitutional terms is
not material," the brief said. "The req
uisite intent need not be expressed, but
may be inferred from all the circum
stances attendant to the act."
The trial memorandum outlined in
great detail the events surrounding

King's beating, and indicated many of
the witnesses and evidence to be present
ed at federal trial beginning Feb. 3 will be
identical to that presented in Simi Valley.
"The government expects the evidence
will show that defendants Powell, Wind
and Briseno, who struck and kicked Rod
ney King repeatedly while he was on the
ground, used more force than was objec
tively reasonable to accomplish a legiti
mate law enforcement purpose of arrest
ing King and thereby deprived King of his
constitutionally protected right to be free
from the infliction of unreasonable force
during arrest," the memo said.
Meanwhile, a psychologist announced
yesterday that many children who lived
through the riots prompted last spring
by the state court decision suffer the
same psychological problems as victims
of child abuse.
"The psychological disturbances that
children manifest are virtually the same
for child molestation, physical abuse or
if the child has experienced a disaster,"
said Hershel Swinger, clinical director
of Children's Institute International, a
non-profit clinic for physically and sexu
ally abused children in Los Angeles.
