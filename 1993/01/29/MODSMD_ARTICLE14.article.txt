## Editorial Editor's farewell 
### 
WORKING AT THE DAILY
has changed me. No one
could walk away from 6,000
hours, hundreds of angry phone
calls, dozens of critical letters, sever
al unwanted sexual advances and
one particularly memorable death
threat unscathed.
I'm no longer that sweet, inno
cent sophomore who responded to
a "Daily Orientation" ad. And I'm
no longer willing to donate my
time indiscriminately or give
everyone the benefit of the doubt
— because, quite frankly, not
everyone deserves it.
I learned more about human
nature by reporting on this cam
pus than I ever could have by sit
ting in its lecture halls. And my
education continued as editor,
although the position wasn't the
writing-intensive job for which I
was trained.
In fact, as editor, my influence
over the paper's editorial content
turned out to be little more than
that of a glorified proofreader.
Once every month or two I got to
make a momentous editorial deci
sion, like whether or not to capital
ize the "B" in Powerßook (No.)
and whether or not to run a naked
photo of J.J. Lasley (Yes.)
But being editor, I found, has a
lot more to do with being a leader
than with being a writer. And being
a leader has a lot less to do with your
skills than it does with your soul.
Overachievers abound on this
campus, but true leaders are a
rarer breed. They may never earn
capitalized titles or drive fancy
company cars, but true leaders are
the steady pulse that keep this
country, this campus and this
newspaper moving forward.
They're the ones who quietly,
graciously and unceremoniously do
what needs to be done. The ones
who stay up late tutoring you, then
forget to study themselves. The
ones who win every teaching award
in the book, but still don't get
tenured because they place their
students' careers before their own.
They're the ones who take on

five too many projects, because "If
I didn't, no one would." The ones
who understand that being a lead
er means leaving the place better
than it was before, and making
sure whoever does your job after
you never has to say, "If only some
one had told me."
Being a leader means following
through on your promises: so no
one has to clean up after you the
way you clean up behind everyone
else. It means being there for peo
ple when they need you to be —
not just when you feel like it.
It means staying true to your
self, and resisting pressures to con
form. It means having the courage
to stand up for what you believe in,
and standing up for others who do
so, even when you despise the
opinions they espouse.
Leadership is also about resilien
cy. It's about withstanding attacks
on your character and judgment.
I've seen reporters reduced to
tears over difficult articles or abu
sive sources. I've watched colum
nists pour their hearts out over the
keyboard so someone else could
benefit from experiences they've
painfully endured.
Along with the bittersweet
memories of late nights and dead
lines; along with the yellowed clip
pings to remind me of glory days
past, I'll take something far more
valuable with me as I clean out my
office this weekend.
My memory of their faces may
fade, but I'll carry with me the wis
dom I've gained from working
closely with 20 or 30 of the most
extraordinary leaders I've known
— most of whose names are listed,
for the last time, on the right-hand
side of this page. Read them
through, you'll see them in great
places one day.
That's the news. And I am outta
here.
