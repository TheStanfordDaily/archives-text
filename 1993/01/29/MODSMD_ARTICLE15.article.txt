Professor gives less-than-inspired defense of CIV

Early in Wednesday's debate
between Dinesh D'Souza and Prof.
Ron Glass, following a petty open
ing statement by Glass, D'Souza looked
into the crowd and said, "This is schol
arship? I'm underwhelmed." Frankly, so
was I.
It's pretty safe to call myself an all
out liberal. I was looking forward to
Stanford putting this political punk, this
right-wing young gun, about whom I
knew very little, in his place. At the
same time, I welcomed the chance to
hear a conservative voice on this cam
pus, an opportunity the does not come
around often.
Unfortunately, Prof. Glass immediate
ly turned what could have been an impor
tant debate into a pathetic catfight.
Instead of fostering a discussion on
D'Souza's very valid and nationally
debated claims, Glass opted to question
D'Souza's integrity as a political scientist.

First of all, one must question the
wisdom of throwing mud at a Dart
mouth Review man (trust me, I grew
up in Hanover, N.H.). More important
ly, while Glass carefully researched
inconsistencies in D'Souza's work,
such as how many people were at this
and that decisive ASSU meeting and
who really said what or why so-and-so
resigned from whatever and who really
cares anyway, he neglected to present
a reason why CIV — with its broad
multi-cultural focus — works. There
fore, Prof. Glass, representing Stan
ford University, lost this debate. Big
time.
D'Souza's integrity is hardly the
issue. D'Souza has clearly grabbed the
attention of the nation, and Stanford is
not going to change anyone's mind by
simply calling him names. What we need
to do is show the world why CIV works,
and why we are now better off than we

were with Western Culture.
In the meantime, many of D'Souza's
statements are still ringing in my ears.
For example, are the priorities of affir
mative action misplaced? Does it matter
whether or not Stanford students have
a strong grasp of the classics? Finally,
is Stanford's conservative community
being suffocated by P.C.?
Is Wednesday night's debate indica
tive of Stanford's attitude toward con
servative thought? I have been led to
believe that if conservatives did more
thorough research, they would agree
with the liberals.
In the meantime, Stanford will
insult anyone harboring un-P.C.
thoughts, and silence them. I obviously
will need to look elsewhere to educate
myself on my political beliefs, because
performances such as Prof. Glass' are
sure to keep other distinguished conser
vatives off The Farm. I believe that

Glass, on behalf of Stanford, has sent
yet another message to our conserva
tive community that its voice is
unwanted.
Prof. Glass suggested that D'Souza
owes Stanford an apology for insulting
and misrepresenting us in "Illiberal
Education." Whether or not D'Souza
"started it" with his book, Glass'
behavior on the stage was not worthy of
a Stanford professor.
He should have demonstrated what a
true scholar is like by respecting his
opponent and preparing his case, not
slandering his adversary and his views.
Glass denied the Stanford community a
chance to hear a real debate. In short,
he denied us an integral part of our
education.
Professor Glass, I believe you owe
Stanford an apology.
