# Daily's sinister pact with Band uncovered
## 
### 
My friends and I are writing in dis
gust to the cruel editorial written in Fri
day's paper about the cheerleaders. If
the opinion stated was accurate or repre
sentative of the student body as a whole,
then I suppose some sort of fair criticism
would be justifiable.
However, The Daily has repeatedly
berated the cheerleaders without accept
ing rebuttals from any group that may
have found these claims unfounded or
insensitive.
What we strongly object to is The
Daily's repeated malicious attacks on a
group whose sole purpose is the indis
criminate support of Stanford athletics.
The cheerleaders work extremely hard
in support of various sports teams.
The Daily refuses to accept this effort
as genuine (due in no small part to the

Stanford Band's overwhelming influence
within The Daily staff). What should
really matter is the opinion of the ath
letes and the Department of Athletics,
both of whom have shown continued
support for the cheerleaders.
If any other organization whose pur
pose was as plain and true as the cheer
leaders received like treatment, numer
ous people would be up in arms about
the insensitivity towards fellow stu
dents' spirit and will.
An opinion stated in a fair manner
would be acceptable to us. In the case of
the cheerleaders, though, no such treat
ment has ever been given. Could you edi
tors find it in your callous hearts to sup
port (or at least be neutral towards) an
organization that exists for a laudable
cause even in the light of extreme con
tempt and adversity?
