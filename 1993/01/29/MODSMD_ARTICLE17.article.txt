# Ice-T doesn't stop his dirty lyrics with 'Cop'
## 
### 
Last spring, I took a closer listen to
some of the music of Ice-T, and was sur
prised by what I found. In a class called
Popular Music, the visiting industry
"big-wig" brought in Ice-T's latest pro
ject for us to preview. The following is
an excerpt from what we heard that day:
• "I love my KKK bitch, love it when
she sucks me through/ I love my KKK
bitch, love it when she fucks me
through/1 love my KKK bitch, she loves
it when I treat her badll love my KKK
bitch, mutha fuck her dear old dad."
• "We had our hoods on, we were
slick,/ she pushed her butt up hard
against my dick/ Then her daddy jumped
on the stage/ talkin' about killin' in a
Goddamn rage/1 got mad, my dick got
hard/ entered in her ass/ she said, "Oh
my God."

• "So what we're really tryin' to say is
Body Count loves everybody/ We love
Mexican girls, black girls, Oriental girls,
it really don't matter/ If you from Mars,
and you got a pussy/ we will fuck you."
I recognize and support Ice-T's right
to express himself, including the right to
come to campus and defend his views. I
am writing this letter in the hope of rais
ing awareness of the views he actually
represents.
While most of the recent controversy
surrounding his work has centered on
the song "Cop Killer," that is certainly
not the only sentiment he espouses
which merits discussion.
I doubt that either the ASSU or Roble
Hall intended to offend anyone with
their decision to invite and pay for Ice-T
to come to campus. Nonetheless, their
sponsorship has the unfortunate effect
of tacitly sanctioning his views, whether
or not they agree with them.
