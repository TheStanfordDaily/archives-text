## A 						letter from Grandma 
### 
Dear Mary,
Peter drove me down yesterday to
a friend in Santa Clara who is
selling her dolls. I felt guilty
having Peter drive when I learned
he had a bad cold, although we
weren't away from campus for quite
an hour.
Peter's articles get worse and
worse. He seems to be trying to
get attention by being offensive.
I am afraid he is ruining his
life. No professor is going to
recommend him for any job or grad
uate school. And later on, if he
ever does mature, these articles
are going to haunt him.
He should be encouraged to not
write anything more for publica
tion anywhere.
There are various aspects to
this situation. You, of course,
cannot show his articles around
Greenwich as Brad Winter's mother
proudly can. Your father and I are
very embarrassed.
We have come to dread Fridays,
fearing what awful drivel will
appear under Peter's name. Our
neighbors are also appalled by it.
But the saddest thing is what
Peter is doing to himself. He
seems to be bent on harming him
self as much as he can. I have

never had much use for psychia
trists; the ones I knew in Berke
ley were pretty nerdy. And from
what I have read, they can do a
lot of harm to their patients. It
is too bad Casper's wife special
izes in bulimia; she might be an
honest person who could help
Peter.
Perhaps the two of you could sit
down with him and try to help him
discover why he is bent on
destroying himself. At any rate,
see if you can get him to come
home and go to bed early â€” it
might help him.
Linda's decorations are in the
window, and they are very spectac
ular. She has her name in each
corner.
Love,
Mother
This is a genuine letter from my
grandmother to my mother. When
I read it, I decided that enough was
enough.
When the fire-breathing feminists on
campus clamored for my resignation, I
barely raised an eyebrow. When profes
sors and students attempted to publicly
defame my character, I snored. When I
found it increasingly hard Lo get dates, I
begged.
But when my grandmother said that I

was embarrassing our family, I decided to
bring my illustrious journalistic career to
an end. I love my grandmother very
much, and I hope I didn't cause her too
much discomfort.
Now, for the rest of you slugs. There is
still one round left, and it's going to be a
humdinger. You called me a coward. You
said I didn't have the guts to stand
behind what I wrote. Come to White
Plaza at high noon today, and find out
just how wrong you were.
This is an open invitation to anyone
who wants to participate in the mother of
all multicultural debates. There will be
no self-righteous professors telling you
what to think, and there will be no snivel
ing RAs condemning your "insensitivi
ty." Bring every ounce of your pent-up
bile and spew it like a porpoise.
Unlike residential education, I don't
want just one opinion. I want everyone
from the most militant feminist to the
most pig-headed misogynist. Stanford is
intellectually constipated, and I'm the
laxative. I AM THE PRUNE.

Pete Huyck is a senior majoring in histo
ry. Really.
