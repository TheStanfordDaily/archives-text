# 20 yrs. of independent journalism
## A 						look back at The Daily's struggle for editorial freedom 
### Miranda Doyle Ari Richter Senior staff writers 
Diarmuid McGuire was angry. The
former graduate student was in jail,
and he was there, he claimed, because
he had been snitched on. Writing from
his cell, he named his betrayers and ex
horted the Stanford community to
"take care of snitches."
When The Daily printed his col
umn, titled "Snitches and Oppres
sion," in October 1970, a firestorm of
criticism swept through the campus.
Could The Daily get away with print

ing a column that was little more than
an incitement to violence?
Within days, a group of 170 com
munity members took out a full-page
ad in The Daily, condemning its edi
tors for printingthecolumn, and Pres
ident Richard Lyman announced he
felt an "increased urgency to make
The Daily completely independent."
Today, The Daily commemorates
the 20th anniversary of its indepen
dence, which had been talked about
for a decade, took more than two years
to achieve and was catalyzed by
McGuire's column.
"The Daily being independent

means that its readers can feel safe in
the knowledge that the administration
is iiot controlling what they read," ex
plains Prof. Jim Bettinger, chair of The
Daily's board of directors. "For better
or for worse, it's the editors and writers
who are deciding what's in the paper."
Prior to January 29, 1973, The
Daily was owned and published by the
ASSU. Since then, control has rested
with The Stanford Daily Publishing
Corporation, an independent, non
profit entity governed by a nine-mem
ber board of directors, with the editor

in chief of the paper serving as
president of the corporation.
But the transition was far from
instantaneous. It took a 150-page
report outlining the possibilities,
the labor of dozens of staff mem
bers and the support of University
administrators to make the change.
"The University was afraid of
what The Daily might do, and they
didn't want the liability," says for
mer Editor in Chief Frank Miller.
"The University wanted to say,
'We're not subsidizing The Daily'
and we wanted to say the same."
The infamous column only
added to the University's fears.
"The 'Snitches and Oppression'
column is really what lit the fuse
on this little firecracker," says Ed
Kohn, who was managing editor
during the 1970-71 school year. "I
think the University really want
ed to control The Daily after
• 'Snitches and Oppression.' "
With then-Biology Prof. Donald
Kennedy as the "ringleader,"
Kohn says the column "drew an
incredibly strident — rabid, really
— response from the community."
Then-University President
Richard Lyman agrees that
McGuire's column was the cata
lyst. "It's when times are very
troubled that any kind of incendi
ary comment is particularly dan
gerous," he says.
But "I never had any tempta
tion to shut the paper up," Lyman
adds. His thinking was instead,
"Who wants responsibility with
out power? Let The Daily have
responsibility for The Daily."
Felicity Barringer, editor in the
spring of '71 and now a reporter
for the New York Times, also
remembers "Snitches" as the
beginning of the serious push for
independence.
University administrators wor
ried about whether they would be
liable if The Daily "went off half
cocked," she says, but it was also a
"question of editorial indepen
dence" for the staff.
Although the column height
ened awareness of the need for
independence, Barringer says
there was also "a sense that it
would be better, it would be clean
er" to break away.
Others, however, remember
the time period differently.
Charlie Hoffman, who was edi
tor in chief of The Daily's first
independent volume, says it was
the April 1971 police search of
The Daily's offices that "set the
wheels in motion."
With a lawsuit on their hands
that would eventually go all the
way to the U. S. Supreme Court as
Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, Hoff
man says, Daily editors realized
they had no lawyers and no busi
ness advisers they could turn to.
"We realized that The Daily was
a vulnerable entity. All you had
were a bunch of students," he says.
Editors from the early '70s say

although there were no Universi
ty efforts to censor the paper,
staff members were uncomfort
able with The Daily's dependence.

"The newspa
per had taken
some stands, edi
torial positions
the University
was uncomfort
able with," Miller
says. "There was
a feeling that . . .
[the University]
could have been

tempted to do certain things to
manipulate the newspaper. There
was a certain level of distrust."
In January 1971, a Stanford
Workshop on Political and Social
Issues class was organized to
study the feasibility of indepen
dence. Sixteen staff members and
a communication professor took
two quarters to compile the 150-
page report, which they hoped
would serve as "a blueprint for
turning speculation into reality."
Meanwhile, negotiations with
the University led to an agree
ment that The Daily would lease
its office space in Storke Student
Publications Building for free and
retain the word Stanford in its
name.
The process cleared its final
hurdle in October 1972 when the
student body voted by a 5-1 mar
gin to transfer all assets of the
paper from the ASSU to an inde
pendent, non-profit corporation.
All that remained then was for
mal recognition of that corpora
tion by the state, which took place
exactly 20 years ago.
Before independence
In the years before indepen
dence, former editors say there
were instances when members of
the Stanford community tried to
exert control over The Daily.
Harry Press, managing editor
of The Daily in 1939, recalls one
such incident, when he was called
in for a lecture from then-Univer
sity President Ray Lyman Wilbur.
"We ran a story taking on bars
who served liquor to minors,"
Press recounts, "and there were
pictures of the bars to go with it."
Evidently, Wilbur then received
pressure from the owners of the
bars, who demanded proof of their
violations.
Press was summoned to
Wilbur's office. "He was a very
austere iceberg, and he was
frightening," Press says."I was
sure I was going to be thrown out
of Stanford." Fortunately for
Press and The Daily, Wilbur went
no further than a scolding.
A more drawn-out and bitter
dispute occurred 18 years later
when the legislature of the ASSU
asserted some of its power as pub
lisher of The Daily.
Trouble began to brew in
February 1957, when the legisla
ture discussed an amendment to
the ASSU Bylaws that would have

threatened The Daily staff*s abili
ty to choose its own editor.
Whereas the editor had until
then been elected on the basis of a
weighted vote among staff mem
bers, the amendment sought to
make the staff's choice subject to
the approval of a mcyority of the
legislature.
"They were trying to control us
by naming the editor," remem
bers Dave Scott, editor of The
Daily at the time. "I didn't feel
they had any right to do that."
After two weeks of debate, at
meetings and on the pages of The
Daily, the legislature flexed its
muscle on the night of March 6.
Then-ASSU President Bob Free
len cast the deciding vote, giving
the amendment the three-fourths
majority it required to pass.
The Daily staff produced the
next day's paper, reporting news
of the vote, and then made their
own news under the banner head
line: "LEGISLATURE MOVES
IN; DAILY STAFF MOVES
OUT."
In a front-page editorial titled
"The Last Straw," the staff
announced they were going on
strike:
"Legislature has tried to force
cooperation down our throats.
We've taken all the abuse we
could, and we're sick of it. The
whole staff is walking out and will
not return until the present legis
lation is rescinded."
Freelen, now vice president for
public affairs, says The Daily's
trend toward covering national
news to the exclusion of campus
news created the impetus for the
ASSU to assert its power. He
adds, "As the publisher of the
paper, we felt it was important to
cover the community."
But for the paper's editors, the
issue transcended any debate over
what to cover. "We are walking
out," the editorial concluded, "for
an ideal — an ideal of a free,
enlightened, critical Stanford Daily
with no legislative shackles on it."
The strike lasted for one issue,
the next day's, as the ASSU
recruited volunteers to get out the
paper. Dead and finals weeks, fol
lowed by spring break, then inter
vened, and the editors returned to
work for spring quarter. The leg
islation had not been repealed,
but the ASSU had agreed to put
the matter before a vote of the
student body during the April
elections.
In that vote, more than 58 per
cent of the students casting bal
lots rejected the amendment, and
the staff of The Daily regained the
exclusive power to choose its edi
tor.
Apparently, the hullabaloo
blew over quickly. Notwithstand
ing the attempt at restricting The
Daily, Scott felt secure enough in
The Daily's position to write in
his May farewell editorial: "There
is no actual control by either the
Communication-Journalism

Department, the Administration
or the student government."
'Abolish the editorship'
The first calls for The Daily's
formal independence occurred in
the early 19605, but little in the
way of progress occurred. Evident
ly, it took the radicalization and
subsequent cooling of campus to
galvanize the efforts of enough peo
ple to make independence possible.
One voice for independence
came from Michael Sweeney, edi
tor of The Daily in 1968. Sweeney
corresponded in late 1967 and early
1968 at great length with former
Stanford News Service Director
Bob Beyers, who had been editor of
the independent Cornell Sun,

The Daily being inde
pendent means that
its readers can feel
safe in the knowledge
that the administration
is not controlling
what they read.'
— Jim Bettinger

bandying about various ideas for
the accomplishment of the task.
But like anyone who might
have suggested the idea before
him, Sweeney failed to get up the
head of steam needed to sever The
Daily's ties. He did, however, later
etch himself in Daily lore, as he
led a campaign in May 1969, to
"transform The Daily into a
democratic commune."
In a document titled "Five rec
ommendations for The Daily,"
Sweeney and a score of others,
including former editorial page
editor Diarmuid McGuire, urged
the staff to "abolish the editor
ship" and "abolish the hierarchy,"
drawing inspiration from"the
April 3rd Movement," which "has
shown us one example of a new
way to bring people together to
achieve goals."
Financial, legal obstacles
The greatest barriers to imme
diate independence were financial
and legal.
The major change brought
about by independence was that
the University no longer had to
worry about liability fQr The
Daily's debts or legal problems,
Hoffman says. "There was never
an overriding issue of someone
trying to control us."
The goal was to be totally
dependent on advertising rev
enues, but over the years The
Daily has sometimes asked for a
special fee from the student body.
As long as The Daily was
housed on campus and bore the
Stanford name, Barringer liabili

ty was "still a worry" for the Uni
versity. But the incorporation
and fiscal independence helped
ease the administration's con
cern.
However, the financial issues
were harder to deal with. "The
Daily had no resources in that
era," Kohn says. In the fall of
1970, the paper "appeared to be
technically broke," and later was
thousands of dollars in the red.
Part of the problem was that
the editor and the business man
ager acted separately, with little
understanding or coordination
between the two spheres.
When The Daily drafted its
bylaws and formed a board of
directors, the editor in chief was
given responsibility for the
paper's financial well-being to end
the tug-of-war over how much
space The Daily could afford for
news stories in its pages.
The extra editions and pages
covering protests helped precipi
tate the financial crisis of the
early '70s, according to Barringer.
"The Daily business manager
ship seemed to be handed down
from one fraternity brother to
another," she adds. Editors final
ly asked the current manager to
resign and replaced him with a
second-year business student.
Taking total responsibility for
financial matters has not always
been easy. Hoffman says unwise
investments in computer equip
ment during the late '70s led to
The Daily's losing "a massive
amount of money."
Several years of losses in the
mid-'Bos also left the paper with
depleted reserves, Hoffman said,
but The Daily managed to regain
its financial health.
'Independence is relative'
Regardless of The Daily's legal
status, it still maintains several
ties to the University.

Kennedy, who
stepped down as
University presi
dent last year,
maintains that
The Daily isn't
fully independent
because it uses
the Stanford
name and a Uni
versity building.

"Independence is relative," he
says."The Daily has achieved a
great measure of independence,
but it's not fully independent."
He cites the Harvard Crimson,
which owns its own real estate
and charges for copies, as an
example of a totally independent
university paper.
"I think the degree of indepen
dence The Daily has is enough to
guarantee it full freedom of
expression," Kennedy says,
adding that the University would
not have tried to control the paper
whatever its status.
But Daily Business Manager
Rick Wolfgram argues that the ties

to the University do not afTect inde
pendence because administrators
have no control over the paper.
"Because of our financial sta
tus, we could feasibly move to
another location and survive," he
says."I could not think of any
thing [the University 1 can do any
thing in terms of censorship."
The Storke building was specif
ically constructed for The Daily
and other student publications,
Wolfgram adds.
As for the special fee, granted
through the vote of a majority of
students in the ASSU's spring
election, he says students receive
plenty of value for the $3 to $4
each pays during the year.
Along with free papers, "any
one can walk in the door and do
any aspect of production," Wolf
gram says, and receive training in
journalism or business.
"I have always treated The
Daily as if it was fully uncoupled,"
Kennedy says, adding that Lyman
and current University President
Gerhard Casper have done the
same.
During his 12-year reign as
president, did Kennedy ever wish
he had a say in The Daily's edito
rial policies? "Only on extremely
bad mornings," he joked, "which I
regret in short order."
After independence
After the long struggle for
independence, former editors say
the changes were more in attitude
than editorial content.
"I saw no major transitions in
what The Daily covered or editori
al position from pre-independence
time to post-independence time,"
Miller says.
"I think it made a lot of differ
ence to the staff. It made them
feel like independent journalists,
more responsible, especially from
a financial standpoint."
Often under attack from both
the right and the left, The Daily
was accused of being agents of the
University, the police and mili
tary intelligence, Kohn says.
"To the extent that people
thought we were a tool of some
other interest group, indepen
dence would have helped to blunt
criticism."
Others say independence has
also made a difference in news
coverage.
"I think it was easier for The
Daily to take on the Bookstore as
an independent entity," Hoffman
says, but he adds that during the
Vietnam War years, "The Daily
had an independent stance and it
was dependent."
Students who know their
paper is "not a toy" and are forced
to make decisions when "a series
of wrong decisions could
bankrupt them" is excellent job
training, Hoffman added.
"I think there's been a marked
increase in the number of stu
dents going into top-level journal
ism jobs after The Daily."

says."I could not think of any
thing [the University 1 can do any
thing in terms of censorship."
The Storke building was specif
ically constructed for The Daily
and other student publications,
Wolfgram adds.
As for the special fee, granted
through the vote of a majority of
students in the ASSU's spring
election, he says students receive
plenty of value for the $3 to $4
each pays during the year.
Along with free papers, "any
one can walk in the door and do
any aspect of production," Wolf
gram says, and receive training in
journalism or business.
"I have always treated The
Daily as if it was fully uncoupled,"
Kennedy says, adding that Lyman
and current University President
Gerhard Casper have done the
same.
During his 12-year reign as
president, did Kennedy ever wish
he had a say in The Daily's edito
rial policies? "Only on extremely
bad mornings," he joked, "which I
regret in short order."
After independence
After the long struggle for
independence, former editors say
the changes were more in attitude
than editorial content.
"I saw no major transitions in
what The Daily covered or editori
al position from pre-independence
time to post-independence time,"
Miller says.
"I think it made a lot of differ
ence to the staff. It made them
feel like independent journalists,
more responsible, especially from
a financial standpoint."
Often under attack from both
the right and the left, The Daily
was accused of being agents of the
University, the police and mili
tary intelligence, Kohn says.
"To the extent that people
thought we were a tool of some
other interest group, indepen
dence would have helped to blunt
criticism."
Others say independence has
also made a difference in news
coverage.
"I think it was easier for The
Daily to take on the Bookstore as
an independent entity," Hoffman
says, but he adds that during the
Vietnam War years, "The Daily
had an independent stance and it
was dependent."
Students who know their
paper is "not a toy" and are forced
to make decisions when "a series
of wrong decisions could
bankrupt them" is excellent job
training, Hoffman added.
"I think there's been a marked
increase in the number of stu
dents going into top-level journal
ism jobs after The Daily."


Lyman


Kennedy
Diarmuid McGuire was angry. The
former graduate student was in jail,
and he was there, he claimed, because
he had been snitched on. Writing from
his cell, he named his betrayers and ex
horted the Stanford community to
"take care of snitches."
When The Daily printed his col
umn, titled "Snitches and Oppres
sion," in October 1970, a firestorm of
criticism swept through the campus.
Could The Daily get away with print

ing a column that was little more than
an incitement to violence?
Within days, a group of 170 com
munity members took out a full-page
ad in The Daily, condemning its edi
tors for printingthecolumn, and Pres
ident Richard Lyman announced he
felt an "increased urgency to make
The Daily completely independent."
Today, The Daily commemorates
the 20th anniversary of its indepen
dence, which had been talked about
for a decade, took more than two years
to achieve and was catalyzed by
McGuire's column.
"The Daily being independent

means that its readers can feel safe in
the knowledge that the administration
is iiot controlling what they read," ex
plains Prof. Jim Bettinger, chair of The
Daily's board of directors. "For better
or for worse, it's the editors and writers
who are deciding what's in the paper."
Prior to January 29, 1973, The
Daily was owned and published by the
ASSU. Since then, control has rested
with The Stanford Daily Publishing
Corporation, an independent, non
profit entity governed by a nine-mem
ber board of directors, with the editor

in chief of the paper serving as
president of the corporation.
But the transition was far from
instantaneous. It took a 150-page
report outlining the possibilities,
the labor of dozens of staff mem
bers and the support of University
administrators to make the change.
"The University was afraid of
what The Daily might do, and they
didn't want the liability," says for
mer Editor in Chief Frank Miller.
"The University wanted to say,
'We're not subsidizing The Daily'
and we wanted to say the same."
The infamous column only
added to the University's fears.
"The 'Snitches and Oppression'
column is really what lit the fuse
on this little firecracker," says Ed
Kohn, who was managing editor
during the 1970-71 school year. "I
think the University really want
ed to control The Daily after
• 'Snitches and Oppression.' "
With then-Biology Prof. Donald
Kennedy as the "ringleader,"
Kohn says the column "drew an
incredibly strident — rabid, really
— response from the community."
Then-University President
Richard Lyman agrees that
McGuire's column was the cata
lyst. "It's when times are very
troubled that any kind of incendi
ary comment is particularly dan
gerous," he says.
But "I never had any tempta
tion to shut the paper up," Lyman
adds. His thinking was instead,
"Who wants responsibility with
out power? Let The Daily have
responsibility for The Daily."
Felicity Barringer, editor in the
spring of '71 and now a reporter
for the New York Times, also
remembers "Snitches" as the
beginning of the serious push for
independence.
University administrators wor
ried about whether they would be
liable if The Daily "went off half
cocked," she says, but it was also a
"question of editorial indepen
dence" for the staff.
Although the column height
ened awareness of the need for
independence, Barringer says
there was also "a sense that it
would be better, it would be clean
er" to break away.
Others, however, remember
the time period differently.
Charlie Hoffman, who was edi
tor in chief of The Daily's first
independent volume, says it was
the April 1971 police search of
The Daily's offices that "set the
wheels in motion."
With a lawsuit on their hands
that would eventually go all the
way to the U. S. Supreme Court as
Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, Hoff
man says, Daily editors realized
they had no lawyers and no busi
ness advisers they could turn to.
"We realized that The Daily was
a vulnerable entity. All you had
were a bunch of students," he says.
Editors from the early '70s say

although there were no Universi
ty efforts to censor the paper,
staff members were uncomfort
able with The Daily's dependence.

"The newspa
per had taken
some stands, edi
torial positions
the University
was uncomfort
able with," Miller
says. "There was
a feeling that . . .
[the University]
could have been

tempted to do certain things to
manipulate the newspaper. There
was a certain level of distrust."
In January 1971, a Stanford
Workshop on Political and Social
Issues class was organized to
study the feasibility of indepen
dence. Sixteen staff members and
a communication professor took
two quarters to compile the 150-
page report, which they hoped
would serve as "a blueprint for
turning speculation into reality."
Meanwhile, negotiations with
the University led to an agree
ment that The Daily would lease
its office space in Storke Student
Publications Building for free and
retain the word Stanford in its
name.
The process cleared its final
hurdle in October 1972 when the
student body voted by a 5-1 mar
gin to transfer all assets of the
paper from the ASSU to an inde
pendent, non-profit corporation.
All that remained then was for
mal recognition of that corpora
tion by the state, which took place
exactly 20 years ago.
Before independence
In the years before indepen
dence, former editors say there
were instances when members of
the Stanford community tried to
exert control over The Daily.
Harry Press, managing editor
of The Daily in 1939, recalls one
such incident, when he was called
in for a lecture from then-Univer
sity President Ray Lyman Wilbur.
"We ran a story taking on bars
who served liquor to minors,"
Press recounts, "and there were
pictures of the bars to go with it."
Evidently, Wilbur then received
pressure from the owners of the
bars, who demanded proof of their
violations.
Press was summoned to
Wilbur's office. "He was a very
austere iceberg, and he was
frightening," Press says."I was
sure I was going to be thrown out
of Stanford." Fortunately for
Press and The Daily, Wilbur went
no further than a scolding.
A more drawn-out and bitter
dispute occurred 18 years later
when the legislature of the ASSU
asserted some of its power as pub
lisher of The Daily.
Trouble began to brew in
February 1957, when the legisla
ture discussed an amendment to
the ASSU Bylaws that would have

threatened The Daily staff*s abili
ty to choose its own editor.
Whereas the editor had until
then been elected on the basis of a
weighted vote among staff mem
bers, the amendment sought to
make the staff's choice subject to
the approval of a mcyority of the
legislature.
"They were trying to control us
by naming the editor," remem
bers Dave Scott, editor of The
Daily at the time. "I didn't feel
they had any right to do that."
After two weeks of debate, at
meetings and on the pages of The
Daily, the legislature flexed its
muscle on the night of March 6.
Then-ASSU President Bob Free
len cast the deciding vote, giving
the amendment the three-fourths
majority it required to pass.
The Daily staff produced the
next day's paper, reporting news
of the vote, and then made their
own news under the banner head
line: "LEGISLATURE MOVES
IN; DAILY STAFF MOVES
OUT."
In a front-page editorial titled
"The Last Straw," the staff
announced they were going on
strike:
"Legislature has tried to force
cooperation down our throats.
We've taken all the abuse we
could, and we're sick of it. The
whole staff is walking out and will
not return until the present legis
lation is rescinded."
Freelen, now vice president for
public affairs, says The Daily's
trend toward covering national
news to the exclusion of campus
news created the impetus for the
ASSU to assert its power. He
adds, "As the publisher of the
paper, we felt it was important to
cover the community."
But for the paper's editors, the
issue transcended any debate over
what to cover. "We are walking
out," the editorial concluded, "for
an ideal — an ideal of a free,
enlightened, critical Stanford Daily
with no legislative shackles on it."
The strike lasted for one issue,
the next day's, as the ASSU
recruited volunteers to get out the
paper. Dead and finals weeks, fol
lowed by spring break, then inter
vened, and the editors returned to
work for spring quarter. The leg
islation had not been repealed,
but the ASSU had agreed to put
the matter before a vote of the
student body during the April
elections.
In that vote, more than 58 per
cent of the students casting bal
lots rejected the amendment, and
the staff of The Daily regained the
exclusive power to choose its edi
tor.
Apparently, the hullabaloo
blew over quickly. Notwithstand
ing the attempt at restricting The
Daily, Scott felt secure enough in
The Daily's position to write in
his May farewell editorial: "There
is no actual control by either the
Communication-Journalism

Department, the Administration
or the student government."
'Abolish the editorship'
The first calls for The Daily's
formal independence occurred in
the early 19605, but little in the
way of progress occurred. Evident
ly, it took the radicalization and
subsequent cooling of campus to
galvanize the efforts of enough peo
ple to make independence possible.
One voice for independence
came from Michael Sweeney, edi
tor of The Daily in 1968. Sweeney
corresponded in late 1967 and early
1968 at great length with former
Stanford News Service Director
Bob Beyers, who had been editor of
the independent Cornell Sun,

The Daily being inde
pendent means that
its readers can feel
safe in the knowledge
that the administration
is not controlling
what they read.'
— Jim Bettinger

bandying about various ideas for
the accomplishment of the task.
But like anyone who might
have suggested the idea before
him, Sweeney failed to get up the
head of steam needed to sever The
Daily's ties. He did, however, later
etch himself in Daily lore, as he
led a campaign in May 1969, to
"transform The Daily into a
democratic commune."
In a document titled "Five rec
ommendations for The Daily,"
Sweeney and a score of others,
including former editorial page
editor Diarmuid McGuire, urged
the staff to "abolish the editor
ship" and "abolish the hierarchy,"
drawing inspiration from"the
April 3rd Movement," which "has
shown us one example of a new
way to bring people together to
achieve goals."
Financial, legal obstacles
The greatest barriers to imme
diate independence were financial
and legal.
The major change brought
about by independence was that
the University no longer had to
worry about liability fQr The
Daily's debts or legal problems,
Hoffman says. "There was never
an overriding issue of someone
trying to control us."
The goal was to be totally
dependent on advertising rev
enues, but over the years The
Daily has sometimes asked for a
special fee from the student body.
As long as The Daily was
housed on campus and bore the
Stanford name, Barringer liabili

ty was "still a worry" for the Uni
versity. But the incorporation
and fiscal independence helped
ease the administration's con
cern.
However, the financial issues
were harder to deal with. "The
Daily had no resources in that
era," Kohn says. In the fall of
1970, the paper "appeared to be
technically broke," and later was
thousands of dollars in the red.
Part of the problem was that
the editor and the business man
ager acted separately, with little
understanding or coordination
between the two spheres.
When The Daily drafted its
bylaws and formed a board of
directors, the editor in chief was
given responsibility for the
paper's financial well-being to end
the tug-of-war over how much
space The Daily could afford for
news stories in its pages.
The extra editions and pages
covering protests helped precipi
tate the financial crisis of the
early '70s, according to Barringer.
"The Daily business manager
ship seemed to be handed down
from one fraternity brother to
another," she adds. Editors final
ly asked the current manager to
resign and replaced him with a
second-year business student.
Taking total responsibility for
financial matters has not always
been easy. Hoffman says unwise
investments in computer equip
ment during the late '70s led to
The Daily's losing "a massive
amount of money."
Several years of losses in the
mid-'Bos also left the paper with
depleted reserves, Hoffman said,
but The Daily managed to regain
its financial health.
'Independence is relative'
Regardless of The Daily's legal
status, it still maintains several
ties to the University.

Kennedy, who
stepped down as
University presi
dent last year,
maintains that
The Daily isn't
fully independent
because it uses
the Stanford
name and a Uni
versity building.

"Independence is relative," he
says."The Daily has achieved a
great measure of independence,
but it's not fully independent."
He cites the Harvard Crimson,
which owns its own real estate
and charges for copies, as an
example of a totally independent
university paper.
"I think the degree of indepen
dence The Daily has is enough to
guarantee it full freedom of
expression," Kennedy says,
adding that the University would
not have tried to control the paper
whatever its status.
But Daily Business Manager
Rick Wolfgram argues that the ties

to the University do not afTect inde
pendence because administrators
have no control over the paper.
"Because of our financial sta
tus, we could feasibly move to
another location and survive," he
says."I could not think of any
thing [the University 1 can do any
thing in terms of censorship."
The Storke building was specif
ically constructed for The Daily
and other student publications,
Wolfgram adds.
As for the special fee, granted
through the vote of a majority of
students in the ASSU's spring
election, he says students receive
plenty of value for the $3 to $4
each pays during the year.
Along with free papers, "any
one can walk in the door and do
any aspect of production," Wolf
gram says, and receive training in
journalism or business.
"I have always treated The
Daily as if it was fully uncoupled,"
Kennedy says, adding that Lyman
and current University President
Gerhard Casper have done the
same.
During his 12-year reign as
president, did Kennedy ever wish
he had a say in The Daily's edito
rial policies? "Only on extremely
bad mornings," he joked, "which I
regret in short order."

ence to the staff. It made them

1970, the paper "appeared to be
technically broke," and later was
thousands of dollars in the red.
Part of the problem was that
the editor and the business man
ager acted separately, with little
understanding or coordination
between the two spheres.
When The Daily drafted its
bylaws and formed a board of
directors, the editor in chief was
given responsibility for the
paper's financial well-being to end
the tug-of-war over how much
space The Daily could afford for
news stories in its pages.
The extra editions and pages
covering protests helped precipi
tate the financial crisis of the
early '70s, according to Barringer.
"The Daily business manager
ship seemed to be handed down
from one fraternity brother to
another," she adds. Editors final
ly asked the current manager to
resign and replaced him with a
second-year business student.
Taking total responsibility for
financial matters has not always
been easy. Hoffman says unwise
investments in computer equip
ment during the late '70s led to
The Daily's losing "a massive
amount of money."
Several years of losses in the
mid-'Bos also left the paper with
depleted reserves, Hoffman said,
but The Daily managed to regain
its financial health.
'Independence is relative'
Regardless of The Daily's legal
status, it still maintains several
ties to the University.

Kennedy, who
stepped down as
University presi
dent last year,
maintains that
The Daily isn't
fully independent
because it uses
the Stanford
name and a Uni
versity building.

"Independence is relative," he
says."The Daily has achieved a
great measure of independence,
but it's not fully independent."
He cites the Harvard Crimson,
which owns its own real estate
and charges for copies, as an
example of a totally independent
university paper.
"I think the degree of indepen
dence The Daily has is enough to
guarantee it full freedom of
expression," Kennedy says,
adding that the University would
not have tried to control the paper
whatever its status.
But Daily Business Manager
Rick Wolfgram argues that the ties

to the University do not afTect inde
pendence because administrators
have no control over the paper.
"Because of our financial sta
tus, we could feasibly move to
another location and survive," he
says."I could not think of any
thing [the University 1 can do any
thing in terms of censorship."
The Storke building was specif
ically constructed for The Daily
and other student publications,
Wolfgram adds.
As for the special fee, granted
through the vote of a majority of
students in the ASSU's spring
election, he says students receive
plenty of value for the $3 to $4
each pays during the year.
Along with free papers, "any
one can walk in the door and do
any aspect of production," Wolf
gram says, and receive training in
journalism or business.
"I have always treated The
Daily as if it was fully uncoupled,"
Kennedy says, adding that Lyman
and current University President
Gerhard Casper have done the
same.
During his 12-year reign as
president, did Kennedy ever wish
he had a say in The Daily's edito
rial policies? "Only on extremely
bad mornings," he joked, "which I
regret in short order."
After independence
After the long struggle for
independence, former editors say
the changes were more in attitude
than editorial content.
"I saw no major transitions in
what The Daily covered or editori
al position from pre-independence
time to post-independence time,"
Miller says.
"I think it made a lot of differ
ence to the staff. It made them
feel like independent journalists,
more responsible, especially from
a financial standpoint."
Often under attack from both
the right and the left, The Daily
was accused of being agents of the
University, the police and mili
tary intelligence, Kohn says.
"To the extent that people
thought we were a tool of some
other interest group, indepen
dence would have helped to blunt
criticism."
Others say independence has
also made a difference in news
coverage.
"I think it was easier for The
Daily to take on the Bookstore as
an independent entity," Hoffman
says, but he adds that during the
Vietnam War years, "The Daily
had an independent stance and it
was dependent."
Students who know their
paper is "not a toy" and are forced
to make decisions when "a series
of wrong decisions could
bankrupt them" is excellent job
training, Hoffman added.
"I think there's been a marked
increase in the number of stu
dents going into top-level journal
ism jobs after The Daily."


Lyman


Kennedy
Diarmuid McGuire was angry. The
former graduate student was in jail,
and he was there, he claimed, because
he had been snitched on. Writing from
his cell, he named his betrayers and ex
horted the Stanford community to
"take care of snitches."
When The Daily printed his col
umn, titled "Snitches and Oppres
sion," in October 1970, a firestorm of
criticism swept through the campus.
Could The Daily get away with print

ing a column that was little more than
an incitement to violence?
Within days, a group of 170 com
munity members took out a full-page
ad in The Daily, condemning its edi
tors for printingthecolumn, and Pres
ident Richard Lyman announced he
felt an "increased urgency to make
The Daily completely independent."
Today, The Daily commemorates
the 20th anniversary of its indepen
dence, which had been talked about
for a decade, took more than two years
to achieve and was catalyzed by
McGuire's column.
"The Daily being independent

means that its readers can feel safe in
the knowledge that the administration
is iiot controlling what they read," ex
plains Prof. Jim Bettinger, chair of The
Daily's board of directors. "For better
or for worse, it's the editors and writers
who are deciding what's in the paper."
Prior to January 29, 1973, The
Daily was owned and published by the
ASSU. Since then, control has rested
with The Stanford Daily Publishing
Corporation, an independent, non
profit entity governed by a nine-mem
ber board of directors, with the editor

in chief of the paper serving as
president of the corporation.
But the transition was far from
instantaneous. It took a 150-page
report outlining the possibilities,
the labor of dozens of staff mem
bers and the support of University
administrators to make the change.
"The University was afraid of
what The Daily might do, and they
didn't want the liability," says for
mer Editor in Chief Frank Miller.
"The University wanted to say,
'We're not subsidizing The Daily'
and we wanted to say the same."
The infamous column only
added to the University's fears.
"The 'Snitches and Oppression'
column is really what lit the fuse
on this little firecracker," says Ed
Kohn, who was managing editor
during the 1970-71 school year. "I
think the University really want
ed to control The Daily after
• 'Snitches and Oppression.' "
With then-Biology Prof. Donald
Kennedy as the "ringleader,"
Kohn says the column "drew an
incredibly strident — rabid, really
— response from the community."
Then-University President
Richard Lyman agrees that
McGuire's column was the cata
lyst. "It's when times are very
troubled that any kind of incendi
ary comment is particularly dan
gerous," he says.
But "I never had any tempta
tion to shut the paper up," Lyman
adds. His thinking was instead,
"Who wants responsibility with
out power? Let The Daily have
responsibility for The Daily."
Felicity Barringer, editor in the
spring of '71 and now a reporter
for the New York Times, also
remembers "Snitches" as the
beginning of the serious push for
independence.
University administrators wor
ried about whether they would be
liable if The Daily "went off half
cocked," she says, but it was also a
"question of editorial indepen
dence" for the staff.
Although the column height
ened awareness of the need for
independence, Barringer says
there was also "a sense that it
would be better, it would be clean
er" to break away.
Others, however, remember
the time period differently.
Charlie Hoffman, who was edi
tor in chief of The Daily's first
independent volume, says it was
the April 1971 police search of
The Daily's offices that "set the
wheels in motion."
With a lawsuit on their hands
that would eventually go all the
way to the U. S. Supreme Court as
Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, Hoff
man says, Daily editors realized
they had no lawyers and no busi
ness advisers they could turn to.
"We realized that The Daily was
a vulnerable entity. All you had
were a bunch of students," he says.
Editors from the early '70s say

although there were no Universi
ty efforts to censor the paper,
staff members were uncomfort
able with The Daily's dependence.

"The newspa
per had taken
some stands, edi
torial positions
the University
was uncomfort
able with," Miller
says. "There was
a feeling that . . .
[the University]
could have been

tempted to do certain things to
manipulate the newspaper. There
was a certain level of distrust."
In January 1971, a Stanford
Workshop on Political and Social
Issues class was organized to
study the feasibility of indepen
dence. Sixteen staff members and
a communication professor took
two quarters to compile the 150-
page report, which they hoped
would serve as "a blueprint for
turning speculation into reality."
Meanwhile, negotiations with
the University led to an agree
ment that The Daily would lease
its office space in Storke Student
Publications Building for free and
retain the word Stanford in its
name.
The process cleared its final
hurdle in October 1972 when the
student body voted by a 5-1 mar
gin to transfer all assets of the
paper from the ASSU to an inde
pendent, non-profit corporation.
All that remained then was for
mal recognition of that corpora
tion by the state, which took place
exactly 20 years ago.
Before independence
In the years before indepen
dence, former editors say there
were instances when members of
the Stanford community tried to
exert control over The Daily.
Harry Press, managing editor
of The Daily in 1939, recalls one
such incident, when he was called
in for a lecture from then-Univer
sity President Ray Lyman Wilbur.
"We ran a story taking on bars
who served liquor to minors,"
Press recounts, "and there were
pictures of the bars to go with it."
Evidently, Wilbur then received
pressure from the owners of the
bars, who demanded proof of their
violations.
Press was summoned to
Wilbur's office. "He was a very
austere iceberg, and he was
frightening," Press says."I was
sure I was going to be thrown out
of Stanford." Fortunately for
Press and The Daily, Wilbur went
no further than a scolding.
A more drawn-out and bitter
dispute occurred 18 years later
when the legislature of the ASSU
asserted some of its power as pub
lisher of The Daily.
Trouble began to brew in
February 1957, when the legisla
ture discussed an amendment to
the ASSU Bylaws that would have

threatened The Daily staff*s abili
ty to choose its own editor.
Whereas the editor had until
then been elected on the basis of a
weighted vote among staff mem
bers, the amendment sought to
make the staff's choice subject to
the approval of a mcyority of the
legislature.
"They were trying to control us
by naming the editor," remem
bers Dave Scott, editor of The
Daily at the time. "I didn't feel
they had any right to do that."
After two weeks of debate, at
meetings and on the pages of The
Daily, the legislature flexed its
muscle on the night of March 6.
Then-ASSU President Bob Free
len cast the deciding vote, giving
the amendment the three-fourths
majority it required to pass.
The Daily staff produced the
next day's paper, reporting news
of the vote, and then made their
own news under the banner head
line: "LEGISLATURE MOVES
IN; DAILY STAFF MOVES
OUT."
In a front-page editorial titled
"The Last Straw," the staff
announced they were going on
strike:
"Legislature has tried to force
cooperation down our throats.
We've taken all the abuse we
could, and we're sick of it. The
whole staff is walking out and will
not return until the present legis
lation is rescinded."
Freelen, now vice president for
public affairs, says The Daily's
trend toward covering national
news to the exclusion of campus
news created the impetus for the
ASSU to assert its power. He
adds, "As the publisher of the
paper, we felt it was important to
cover the community."
But for the paper's editors, the
issue transcended any debate over
what to cover. "We are walking
out," the editorial concluded, "for
an ideal — an ideal of a free,
enlightened, critical Stanford Daily
with no legislative shackles on it."
The strike lasted for one issue,
the next day's, as the ASSU
recruited volunteers to get out the
paper. Dead and finals weeks, fol
lowed by spring break, then inter
vened, and the editors returned to
work for spring quarter. The leg
islation had not been repealed,
but the ASSU had agreed to put
the matter before a vote of the
student body during the April
elections.
In that vote, more than 58 per
cent of the students casting bal
lots rejected the amendment, and
the staff of The Daily regained the
exclusive power to choose its edi
tor.
Apparently, the hullabaloo
blew over quickly. Notwithstand
ing the attempt at restricting The
Daily, Scott felt secure enough in
The Daily's position to write in
his May farewell editorial: "There
is no actual control by either the
Communication-Journalism

Department, the Administration
or the student government."
'Abolish the editorship'
The first calls for The Daily's
formal independence occurred in
the early 19605, but little in the
way of progress occurred. Evident
ly, it took the radicalization and
subsequent cooling of campus to
galvanize the efforts of enough peo
ple to make independence possible.
One voice for independence
came from Michael Sweeney, edi
tor of The Daily in 1968. Sweeney
corresponded in late 1967 and early
1968 at great length with former
Stanford News Service Director
Bob Beyers, who had been editor of
the independent Cornell Sun,

The Daily being inde
pendent means that
its readers can feel
safe in the knowledge
that the administration
is not controlling
what they read.'
— Jim Bettinger

bandying about various ideas for
the accomplishment of the task.
But like anyone who might
have suggested the idea before
him, Sweeney failed to get up the
head of steam needed to sever The
Daily's ties. He did, however, later
etch himself in Daily lore, as he
led a campaign in May 1969, to
"transform The Daily into a
democratic commune."
In a document titled "Five rec
ommendations for The Daily,"
Sweeney and a score of others,
including former editorial page
editor Diarmuid McGuire, urged
the staff to "abolish the editor
ship" and "abolish the hierarchy,"
drawing inspiration from"the
April 3rd Movement," which "has
shown us one example of a new
way to bring people together to
achieve goals."
Financial, legal obstacles
The greatest barriers to imme
diate independence were financial
and legal.
The major change brought
about by independence was that
the University no longer had to
worry about liability fQr The
Daily's debts or legal problems,
Hoffman says. "There was never
an overriding issue of someone
trying to control us."
The goal was to be totally
dependent on advertising rev
enues, but over the years The
Daily has sometimes asked for a
special fee from the student body.
As long as The Daily was
housed on campus and bore the
Stanford name, Barringer liabili

ty was "still a worry" for the Uni
versity. But the incorporation
and fiscal independence helped
ease the administration's con
cern.
However, the financial issues
were harder to deal with. "The
Daily had no resources in that
era," Kohn says. In the fall of
1970, the paper "appeared to be
technically broke," and later was
thousands of dollars in the red.
Part of the problem was that
the editor and the business man
ager acted separately, with little
understanding or coordination
between the two spheres.
When The Daily drafted its
bylaws and formed a board of
directors, the editor in chief was
given responsibility for the
paper's financial well-being to end
the tug-of-war over how much
space The Daily could afford for
news stories in its pages.
The extra editions and pages
covering protests helped precipi
tate the financial crisis of the
early '70s, according to Barringer.
"The Daily business manager
ship seemed to be handed down
from one fraternity brother to
another," she adds. Editors final
ly asked the current manager to
resign and replaced him with a
second-year business student.
Taking total responsibility for
financial matters has not always
been easy. Hoffman says unwise
investments in computer equip
ment during the late '70s led to
The Daily's losing "a massive
amount of money."
Several years of losses in the
mid-'Bos also left the paper with
depleted reserves, Hoffman said,
but The Daily managed to regain
its financial health.
'Independence is relative'
Regardless of The Daily's legal
status, it still maintains several
ties to the University.

Kennedy, who
stepped down as
University presi
dent last year,
maintains that
The Daily isn't
fully independent
because it uses
the Stanford

He cites the Harvard Crimson,
which owns its own real estate

adding that the University would

way of progress occurred. Evident
ly, it took the radicalization and
subsequent cooling of campus to
galvanize the efforts of enough peo
ple to make independence possible.
One voice for independence
came from Michael Sweeney, edi
tor of The Daily in 1968. Sweeney
corresponded in late 1967 and early
1968 at great length with former
Stanford News Service Director
Bob Beyers, who had been editor of
the independent Cornell Sun,

The Daily being inde
pendent means that
its readers can feel
safe in the knowledge
that the administration
is not controlling
what they read.'
— Jim Bettinger

bandying about various ideas for
the accomplishment of the task.
But like anyone who might
have suggested the idea before
him, Sweeney failed to get up the
head of steam needed to sever The
Daily's ties. He did, however, later
etch himself in Daily lore, as he
led a campaign in May 1969, to
"transform The Daily into a
democratic commune."
In a document titled "Five rec
ommendations for The Daily,"
Sweeney and a score of others,
including former editorial page
editor Diarmuid McGuire, urged
the staff to "abolish the editor
ship" and "abolish the hierarchy,"
drawing inspiration from"the
April 3rd Movement," which "has
shown us one example of a new
way to bring people together to
achieve goals."
Financial, legal obstacles
The greatest barriers to imme
diate independence were financial
and legal.
The major change brought
about by independence was that
the University no longer had to
worry about liability fQr The
Daily's debts or legal problems,
Hoffman says. "There was never
an overriding issue of someone
trying to control us."
The goal was to be totally
dependent on advertising rev
enues, but over the years The
Daily has sometimes asked for a
special fee from the student body.
As long as The Daily was
housed on campus and bore the
Stanford name, Barringer liabili

ty was "still a worry" for the Uni
versity. But the incorporation
and fiscal independence helped
ease the administration's con
cern.
However, the financial issues
were harder to deal with. "The
Daily had no resources in that
era," Kohn says. In the fall of
1970, the paper "appeared to be
technically broke," and later was
thousands of dollars in the red.
Part of the problem was that
the editor and the business man
ager acted separately, with little
understanding or coordination
between the two spheres.
When The Daily drafted its
bylaws and formed a board of
directors, the editor in chief was
given responsibility for the
paper's financial well-being to end
the tug-of-war over how much
space The Daily could afford for
news stories in its pages.
The extra editions and pages
covering protests helped precipi
tate the financial crisis of the
early '70s, according to Barringer.
"The Daily business manager
ship seemed to be handed down
from one fraternity brother to
another," she adds. Editors final
ly asked the current manager to
resign and replaced him with a
second-year business student.
Taking total responsibility for
financial matters has not always
been easy. Hoffman says unwise
investments in computer equip
ment during the late '70s led to
The Daily's losing "a massive
amount of money."
Several years of losses in the
mid-'Bos also left the paper with
depleted reserves, Hoffman said,
but The Daily managed to regain
its financial health.
'Independence is relative'
Regardless of The Daily's legal
status, it still maintains several
ties to the University.

Kennedy, who
stepped down as
University presi
dent last year,
maintains that
The Daily isn't
fully independent
because it uses
the Stanford
name and a Uni
versity building.

"Independence is relative," he
says."The Daily has achieved a
great measure of independence,
but it's not fully independent."
He cites the Harvard Crimson,
which owns its own real estate
and charges for copies, as an
example of a totally independent
university paper.
"I think the degree of indepen
dence The Daily has is enough to
guarantee it full freedom of
expression," Kennedy says,
adding that the University would
not have tried to control the paper
whatever its status.
But Daily Business Manager
Rick Wolfgram argues that the ties

to the University do not afTect inde
pendence because administrators
have no control over the paper.
"Because of our financial sta
tus, we could feasibly move to
another location and survive," he
says."I could not think of any
thing [the University 1 can do any
thing in terms of censorship."
The Storke building was specif
ically constructed for The Daily
and other student publications,
Wolfgram adds.
As for the special fee, granted
through the vote of a majority of
students in the ASSU's spring
election, he says students receive
plenty of value for the $3 to $4
each pays during the year.
Along with free papers, "any
one can walk in the door and do
any aspect of production," Wolf
gram says, and receive training in
journalism or business.
"I have always treated The
Daily as if it was fully uncoupled,"
Kennedy says, adding that Lyman
and current University President
Gerhard Casper have done the
same.
During his 12-year reign as
president, did Kennedy ever wish
he had a say in The Daily's edito
rial policies? "Only on extremely
bad mornings," he joked, "which I
regret in short order."
After independence
After the long struggle for
independence, former editors say
the changes were more in attitude
than editorial content.
"I saw no major transitions in
what The Daily covered or editori
al position from pre-independence
time to post-independence time,"
Miller says.
"I think it made a lot of differ
ence to the staff. It made them
feel like independent journalists,
more responsible, especially from
a financial standpoint."
Often under attack from both
the right and the left, The Daily
was accused of being agents of the
University, the police and mili
tary intelligence, Kohn says.
"To the extent that people
thought we were a tool of some
other interest group, indepen
dence would have helped to blunt
criticism."
Others say independence has
also made a difference in news
coverage.
"I think it was easier for The
Daily to take on the Bookstore as
an independent entity," Hoffman
says, but he adds that during the
Vietnam War years, "The Daily
had an independent stance and it
was dependent."
Students who know their
paper is "not a toy" and are forced
to make decisions when "a series
of wrong decisions could
bankrupt them" is excellent job
training, Hoffman added.
"I think there's been a marked
increase in the number of stu
dents going into top-level journal
ism jobs after The Daily."


Lyman


Kennedy
Diarmuid McGuire was angry. The
former graduate student was in jail,
and he was there, he claimed, because
he had been snitched on. Writing from
his cell, he named his betrayers and ex
horted the Stanford community to
"take care of snitches."
When The Daily printed his col
umn, titled "Snitches and Oppres
sion," in October 1970, a firestorm of
criticism swept through the campus.
Could The Daily get away with print

ing a column that was little more than
an incitement to violence?
Within days, a group of 170 com
munity members took out a full-page
ad in The Daily, condemning its edi
tors for printingthecolumn, and Pres
ident Richard Lyman announced he
felt an "increased urgency to make
The Daily completely independent."
Today, The Daily commemorates
the 20th anniversary of its indepen
dence, which had been talked about
for a decade, took more than two years
to achieve and was catalyzed by
McGuire's column.
"The Daily being independent

means that its readers can feel safe in
the knowledge that the administration
is iiot controlling what they read," ex
plains Prof. Jim Bettinger, chair of The
Daily's board of directors. "For better
or for worse, it's the editors and writers
who are deciding what's in the paper."
Prior to January 29, 1973, The
Daily was owned and published by the
ASSU. Since then, control has rested
with The Stanford Daily Publishing
Corporation, an independent, non
profit entity governed by a nine-mem
ber board of directors, with the editor

in chief of the paper serving as
president of the corporation.
But the transition was far from
instantaneous. It took a 150-page
report outlining the possibilities,
the labor of dozens of staff mem
bers and the support of University
administrators to make the change.
"The University was afraid of
what The Daily might do, and they
didn't want the liability," says for
mer Editor in Chief Frank Miller.
"The University wanted to say,
'We're not subsidizing The Daily'
and we wanted to say the same."
The infamous column only
added to the University's fears.
"The 'Snitches and Oppression'
column is really what lit the fuse
on this little firecracker," says Ed
Kohn, who was managing editor
during the 1970-71 school year. "I
think the University really want
ed to control The Daily after
• 'Snitches and Oppression.' "
With then-Biology Prof. Donald
Kennedy as the "ringleader,"
Kohn says the column "drew an
incredibly strident — rabid, really
— response from the community."
Then-University President
Richard Lyman agrees that
McGuire's column was the cata
lyst. "It's when times are very
troubled that any kind of incendi
ary comment is particularly dan
gerous," he says.
But "I never had any tempta
tion to shut the paper up," Lyman
adds. His thinking was instead,
"Who wants responsibility with
out power? Let The Daily have
responsibility for The Daily."
Felicity Barringer, editor in the
spring of '71 and now a reporter
for the New York Times, also
remembers "Snitches" as the
beginning of the serious push for
independence.
University administrators wor
ried about whether they would be
liable if The Daily "went off half
cocked," she says, but it was also a
"question of editorial indepen
dence" for the staff.
Although the column height
ened awareness of the need for
independence, Barringer says
there was also "a sense that it
would be better, it would be clean
er" to break away.
Others, however, remember
the time period differently.
Charlie Hoffman, who was edi
tor in chief of The Daily's first
independent volume, says it was
the April 1971 police search of
The Daily's offices that "set the
wheels in motion."
With a lawsuit on their hands
that would eventually go all the
way to the U. S. Supreme Court as
Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, Hoff
man says, Daily editors realized
they had no lawyers and no busi
ness advisers they could turn to.
"We realized that The Daily was
a vulnerable entity. All you had
were a bunch of students," he says.
Editors from the early '70s say

although there were no Universi
ty efforts to censor the paper,
staff members were uncomfort
able with The Daily's dependence.

"The newspa
per had taken
some stands, edi
torial positions
the University
was uncomfort
able with," Miller
says. "There was
a feeling that . . .
[the University]
could have been

tempted to do certain things to
manipulate the newspaper. There
was a certain level of distrust."
In January 1971, a Stanford
Workshop on Political and Social
Issues class was organized to
study the feasibility of indepen
dence. Sixteen staff members and
a communication professor took
two quarters to compile the 150-
page report, which they hoped
would serve as "a blueprint for
turning speculation into reality."
Meanwhile, negotiations with
the University led to an agree
ment that The Daily would lease
its office space in Storke Student
Publications Building for free and
retain the word Stanford in its
name.
The process cleared its final
hurdle in October 1972 when the
student body voted by a 5-1 mar
gin to transfer all assets of the
paper from the ASSU to an inde
pendent, non-profit corporation.
All that remained then was for
mal recognition of that corpora
tion by the state, which took place
exactly 20 years ago.
Before independence
In the years before indepen
dence, former editors say there
were instances when members of
the Stanford community tried to
exert control over The Daily.
Harry Press, managing editor
of The Daily in 1939, recalls one
such incident, when he was called
in for a lecture from then-Univer
sity President Ray Lyman Wilbur.
"We ran a story taking on bars
who served liquor to minors,"
Press recounts, "and there were
pictures of the bars to go with it."
Evidently, Wilbur then received
pressure from the owners of the
bars, who demanded proof of their
violations.
Press was summoned to
Wilbur's office. "He was a very
austere iceberg, and he was
frightening," Press says."I was
sure I was going to be thrown out
of Stanford." Fortunately for
Press and The Daily, Wilbur went
no further than a scolding.
A more drawn-out and bitter
dispute occurred 18 years later
when the legislature of the ASSU
asserted some of its power as pub
lisher of The Daily.
Trouble began to brew in
February 1957, when the legisla
ture discussed an amendment to
the ASSU Bylaws that would have

threatened The Daily staff*s abili
ty to choose its own editor.
Whereas the editor had until
then been elected on the basis of a
weighted vote among staff mem
bers, the amendment sought to
make the staff's choice subject to
the approval of a mcyority of the
legislature.
"They were trying to control us
by naming the editor," remem
bers Dave Scott, editor of The
Daily at the time. "I didn't feel
they had any right to do that."
After two weeks of debate, at
meetings and on the pages of The
Daily, the legislature flexed its
muscle on the night of March 6.
Then-ASSU President Bob Free
len cast the deciding vote, giving
the amendment the three-fourths
majority it required to pass.
The Daily staff produced the
next day's paper, reporting news
of the vote, and then made their
own news under the banner head
line: "LEGISLATURE MOVES
IN; DAILY STAFF MOVES
OUT."
In a front-page editorial titled
"The Last Straw," the staff
announced they were going on
strike:
"Legislature has tried to force
cooperation down our throats.
We've taken all the abuse we
could, and we're sick of it. The
whole staff is walking out and will
not return until the present legis
lation is rescinded."
Freelen, now vice president for
public affairs, says The Daily's
trend toward covering national
news to the exclusion of campus
news created the impetus for the
ASSU to assert its power. He
adds, "As the publisher of the
paper, we felt it was important to
cover the community."
But for the paper's editors, the
issue transcended any debate over
what to cover. "We are walking
out," the editorial concluded, "for
an ideal — an ideal of a free,
enlightened, critical Stanford Daily
with no legislative shackles on it."
The strike lasted for one issue,
the next day's, as the ASSU
recruited volunteers to get out the
paper. Dead and finals weeks, fol
lowed by spring break, then inter
vened, and the editors returned to
work for spring quarter. The leg
islation had not been repealed,
but the ASSU had agreed to put
the matter before a vote of the
student body during the April
elections.
In that vote, more than 58 per
cent of the students casting bal
lots rejected the amendment, and
the staff of The Daily regained the
exclusive power to choose its edi
tor.
Apparently, the hullabaloo
blew over quickly. Notwithstand
ing the attempt at restricting The
Daily, Scott felt secure enough in
The Daily's position to write in
his May farewell editorial: "There
is no actual control by either the
Communication-Journalism

Department, the Administration
or the student government."
'Abolish the editorship'
The first calls for The Daily's
formal independence occurred in
the early 19605, but little in the
way of progress occurred. Evident
ly, it took the radicalization and
subsequent cooling of campus to
galvanize the efforts of enough peo
ple to make independence possible.
One voice for independence
came from Michael Sweeney, edi

corresponded in late 1967 and early
1968 at great length with former
Stanford News Service Director
Bob Beyers, who had been editor of
the independent Cornell Sun,

pendent means that

bandying about various ideas for
the accomplishment of the task.
But like anyone who might
have suggested the idea before
him, Sweeney failed to get up the
head of steam needed to sever The
Daily's ties. He did, however, later
etch himself in Daily lore, as he
led a campaign in May 1969, to
