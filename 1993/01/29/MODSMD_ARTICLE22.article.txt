## Olympian looks for another NCAA ring in final season 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Former Olympic medalist and
NCAA champion Janel Jor
gensen's first love v as not swim
ming. Instead, the Connecticut
native thrived on equestrian
sports as a child, until she was
forced out of the stables and into
the pool one summer.
"When I was little I used to
horseback ride, and I totally loved
it to death," said Jorgensen. "My
two older sisters swam, so our
mother would always take them
to their carpools in the afternoon,
and I would always have to go to
the farm separately.
"There was this one time when
(my mom) broke her knee, and I
kind of got thrown into the car
pool group for a while. Since then,
I made some friends from swim
ming and stuck with that more
than riding.... I had no idea that
it would turn out so well."
Indeed, everything has fallen
perfectly into place for Jorgensen,
who has tasted the sweetness of
both Olympic and NCAA glory
during her career.
At the Olympic Trials for the
1988 Summer Games, Jorgensen
missed making the national team
by one position. She placed third
in the 100-meter butterfly, but
only the top-two finishers from
each event advanced to the
Olympics.
Devastated, she avoided the
pool for several weeks until
Olympic head coach (and Stan
ford's present coach) Richard
Quick phoned her a month before
the Games.
"One night I got a call from
Richard, and I thought, since it
was the summer before my senior
year in high school, that he was
trying to recruit me," Jorgensen
said. "It started out really normal
— how are you doing and stuff
like that — but then he asks me to
sit down because he had some
thing to say to me. He then
shocks me by telling me that I was
in, that I was on the team. That
was the start of an incredible
Olympic experience.

"lt turned out that the girl who
had won the 100 fly, Angel Myers,
had tested positive for steroids, so
she was automatically disquali
fied. I was kind of on an emotion
al rollercoaster, because for weeks
I was so low and suddenly I was
flying again."
At the Olympics she swam
"like she had nothing to lose" and
ended up beating the other Amer
ican qualifier to take fifth place in
the world. That race put her on
the medley relay team where she
and three other Americans com
bined for an Olympic silver medal.
Following her Olympic tri
umph, Jorgensen was successful
ly recruited by Quick for his top
ranked Stanford team. Swimming
as a' freshman in 1990, Jorgensen
continued to dominate the nation
in the 100 and 200 fly events and
the 200 Individual Medley by
sweeping all three individual
races at the NCAA Champi
onships.
As a sophomore and junior she
continued to excel at the NCAA
level, but last year signified the
first trouble spot in her career.
This time it was the Summer
Games in Barcelona, and she felt
disappointed with her showing at
the Olympic Trials, failing to
qualify for the US squad.
"Last year was really frustrat
ing for me, and I had a real hard
time coming back in the spring
and being excited about swim
ming again. I felt I gave my heart
and soul to the [Olympic Trialsl
and things just didn't work out
the way I wanted them to.
"I swam very fast times, but
the entire race left a poor image in
my mind because I didn't qualify.
If the results had been different, I
would have been very happy with
my times. But they weren't, and
that one race sort of tainted my
entire image of last year."
"During Spring Quarter it got
to the point where I knew I need
ed a break. ... I even considered
retiring then."
The only consolation she
received last year was the Cardi
nal's NCAA title, but, despite that
achievement, Jorgensen felt

"burned-out."
"I took last summer off from
training. And people always asked
me, 'Are you ever going to come
back? Are you hanging it up?' But
for me, I think there was no other
way I could be where I am now if
I hadn't taken that break. Men

tally, physically and emotionally I
was just fed up with the whole
process of the sport.
"It worked, because when I
came back this year I was so excit
ed about swimming hard, work
ing hard and training hard. Now,
when we have grueling workouts

at 6 in the morning I'd be like,
'this is so great!' That's impor
tant. You have to enjoy it. If you
don't enjoy it, then that's when
you know it's all over."
Her goals this season include
shooting for life-time bests in
individual events and American

records in the relays, but her
main focus will always be to swim
fast and help the team capture its
third-consecutive NCAA crown.
"The Olympic experience is
what every individual dreams of,
