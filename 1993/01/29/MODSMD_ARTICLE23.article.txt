# Sluggish Stanford hoops stunned by lowly Cougars, 64-59
## Depressing basketball as hoops slump lingers 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
If you're wondering what's wrong with Stan
ford men's basketball these days, don't ask Mike
Montgomery. He's fresh out of answers.
"I don't know what to tell you — I don't know
what to tell my team," Montgomery said after
his team's 64-59 loss to Washington State last
night. "This is difficult — difficult for the kids,
difficult for the coaches."
Frustrated by the Cougars' surprisingly effec
tive zone defense, the Cardinal couldn't seem to
put the ball in the hoop.
Stanford shooters went 9-for-30 in the first
half, including 6-for-13 shooting from the free
throw line. Add to that eight turnovers and 20
percent shooting from three-point range, and
you'll start to understand this team's frustra
tion.
Freshman Dion Cross has averaged 13.8
points per game over the Cardinal's past four
games, but he was nowhere to be found in last
night's loss, scoring six points in his brief 15
minutes of play.
"He struggled a little bit in the first half
against the zone," Montgomery said. "But he's a
guy we're going to continue to play more min
utes."
Cross came in late in the game to sink a clutch
three-pointer and cut the Cougar lead to 61-59,
but the Cardinal couldn't convert in the closing
seconds, turning the ball over on two trips down
the floor.
Not all of the news was bad for the Cardinal,
however. Senior Brent Williams tallied 17 points
on 8-for-16 shooting on the night, picking up 12
rebounds along the way. Senior point guard
Marcus Lollie, after scoring just three points in
the first half, exploded for 15 points in the sec
ond half, going 4-for-6 from three-point range.
"Marcus is the one guy who's been consistent
ly good for us this year," Montgomery said.
"He's a very tough-minded player."
But at times, the problems seem insurmount
able for Stanford. The Cardinal is in a slump,
and it has affected every member of the team,
especially senior guard Peter Dukes.
Dukes, the hottest hand from three-point
range last year, hasn't been able to buy a basket
in recent weeks.
"He would do anything for a bucket right
now," Montgomery said. "That's what it's come
down to."
For their part, however, Dukes and Lollie
aren't giving up on the team or the season.
"You just gotta go to practice and play as hard
as you usually play," Dukes said. "You have to
keep your head up."
"We're on the verge of getting a 'W' — and I'm
not a quitter," Lollie added. "As a leader on this
team, it's my responsibility to keep everyone's
head up, eo I'm going to do that."

In the Pacific 10 Conference,
the visitor can only give the home
team so many chances to win
before the opposition takes the
host up on its offer to have a
pleasant stay while in the neigh
borhood.
For Washington State, three
times proved to be the charm as
Stanford failed to capitalize on
possessions in the closing minute
and fell 64-59 to the Cougars
before a largely quiet 2,310 at
Maples Pavilion.
"The kids are working hard,"
said Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "It's extremely disap
pointing and extremely frustrat
ing. We're not finishing and mak
ing game-winning plays. I just
don't know the answer."
Stanford (6-12, 1-5 Pac-10)
had control of the basketball with
just under two minutes to play
trailing Washington State (9-6, 3-
3) 59-56, but was unable to nar
row the gap despite Washington
State's underlying encourage
ment. On its first trip down the
floor, the Cardinal took three
shots at the basket — two of
which were close to the basket
following offensive rebounds —
and came up empty.
But the Cougars' Eddie Hill,
who led all scorers with 20 points,
proceeded to dribble the ball off of
his legs after crossing the mid
court line, and the ball rolled
backwards, resulting in a back
court violation. Worse for Hill, he
became the object of a tirade by
Cougar coach Kelvin Sampson,
who ripped his tie off of his shirt
and held it aloft like a noose.
"I was so mad I wanted to
strangle him," Sampson said.
After taking the team's first
timeout, Stanford had another
chance to narrow the margin, but
guard Marcus Lollie's pass inside
to center Todd Manley went
through Manley's legs at the 33-
second mark for Stanford
turnover no. 2.
Kenny Hicks quickly fouled
Hill, who made two free throws,
and freshman Dion Cross calmly
sank a three-pointer with 0:21 to
bring the Cardinal within two at
61-59. Hill was fouled again and
made only the second free-throw,
giving Stanford a chance to tie in
regulation. But Marcus Lollie
bounced the ball off his foot with
nine seconds left for Stanford
turnover no. 3, consigning the

Cardinal to yet another narrow
loss.
"We played hard and we did
what we wanted to do, but we
didn't make plays at the end," Lol
lie said.
Lollie, though, was virtually
the only one making plays for the
Cardinal all night. The senior
playmaker scored 18 points,
including 10 during a 14-5 Stan
ford run that allowed the Cardinal
to tie the score at 43 at the 11:34
mark after the squad had trailed
by 11 only four minutes earlier.
The Cardinal again was
plagued by breakdowns at key
moments of the contest, which
proved costly. Aside from the
turnovers at the end, Stanford
missed five-straight free throws at
the conclusion of the first half,
and consequently went into the
break trailing the Cougars by four
points, instead of holding a one
point advantage.
As a team, Stanford shot the
ball better than in recent outings,
but 41 percent still was not good
enough. Individually, the Cardi
nal's shooting woes continued.
Shooting guard Peter Dukes was
0-for-6 from the field and did not
score at all. It was first time Dukes
has failed to score since his sopho
more season.
"I've got to keep plugging
away," Dukes said. "There's no
sense sulking about it. I've got to
keep my head up. I know I'm a
good shooter."
Stanford has been unable to
put together a complete game, and
both the team and Montgomery
recognize that everything must
click for a win to occur in the near
future.
"Every game we're there and
within striking distance," Mont
gomery said. "But it seems like, if
it's not one thing, it's another. We
just can't get everyone on the
same page on the same day. Right
now my answer list is shorter than
my question list."
A chance for a positive response
will come tomorrow night against
Washington.
