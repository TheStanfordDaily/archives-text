### Brian Border Staff writer 
Another game. Another over
whelming second-half perfor
mance. Another win for the Stan
ford women's basketball team.
Even though the Cardinal has
fallen into the same routine for just
about all of its Pacific 10 Confer
ence games so far, this pattern of
play once again proved successful
last night as Stanford ambushed
Washington State 78-44 on the
road, outscoring the Cougars 47-16
in the second period.
Led by Rachel Hemmer's offen
sive domination and Molly Good
enbour's pinpoint outside shoot
ing, the No. 5 Cardinal (15-3, 6-1
Pac-10) finally got rolling in the
last 20 minutes, after leading by
just three points at halftime.
Hemmer scored eight of her 17
points in the second period, and
also snatched 10 rebounds in the
game.
"Rachel was really aggressive
on the offensive boards," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
In addition, the 6-foot-3 sopho
more made a key steal and fast
break layup to blow open the con
test, 49-33, with under 14 minutes
remaining.
Goodenbour opened the second
half scoring with a three-point
bomb and never cooled down. The
senior point guard converted three
more treys before she was through
for the evening, racking up a game
high 18 points (all on three-point
baskets) and six assists.
Possibly the most crucial aspect
of Stanford's second-half outburst
was its tenacious press defense,
which completely flustered the
Washington State players for the
rest of the contest. The Cardinal
caused its opponent to commit a

total of 26 turnovers and rattled
the Cougars' shooters during the
closing period. As a result, Wash
ington State fielded a lousy 19.2
second-period shooting percentage.
However, in the first half the
Cougars looked much more like a
team capable of upsetting the
defending national champions.
Darci Wellsandt scored 10 of her
12 points less than seven minutes
into the contest as her Washington
State squad sprung out to a 15-9
advantage. The Cougars held the
lead for most of the opening period,
while the Cardinal relied mostly on
Hemmer's consistent shooting to
keep it close.
Unlike recent games when the
Cardinal has received substantial
contributions from only one or two
players, Stanford enjoyed one of its
best team efforts last night. Along
with the inspired efforts of Hem
mer, Goodenbour and Chris Mac-
Murdo, the Cardinal squad was
aided by the performances of sever
al other players.
Guard Christy Hedgpeth broke
out of a recent shooting slump for
15 points while redshirt-freshman
Bobbie Kelsey chipped in eight
points of her own. In addition, cen
ter Val Whiting grabbed nine
rebounds.
"It's nice to play a game where
everyone could play and con
tribute," VanDerveer said. "A lot of
our offense has just been Val lin
past games]."
The Cardinal hopes to continue
playing team-oriented and
turnover-free basketball as it
squares off against Washington
tomorrow.
"We turned the ball over too
much in the first-half," said Van-
Derveer. "We need to work on tak
ing care of the ball against Wash
ington."
