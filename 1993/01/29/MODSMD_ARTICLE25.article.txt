# Baseball opens against St. Mary's

The Stanford baseball team heads into
a new season this weekend with a lineup
full of both questions and promise.
"It may take us a while to figure out
who belongs where," assistant coach Dean
Stotz said. "So there's plenty of opportu
nity out there."
The Cardinal opens the season with a
home-and-home series against St. Mary's
tomorrow and Sunday.
Last year, Stanford split its series with
the Gaels, defeating them 3-2 at home,
and dropping a 4-3 contest in Moraga.

"St. Mary's will be a good test for us,"
said Stanford coach Mark Marquess.
"They have a very good nucleus of offen
sive players, and recruited several strong
junior college players this year."
Of the several new faces who will start
for the Cril<dfaia! tfliYidrrow, none will be
placed in the fire more quickly than fresh
man catcher A.J. Hinch.
Hinch, the 1992 Gatorade National
High School Player of the Year, and his
strong arm will be challenged early and
often by St. Mary's.
"St. Mary's has a lot of team speed,"
Marquess said. "They will be a good test
for us, and a good test for Hinch."
Indeed, the games will be an early test
for most of the Stanford roster. First base
man Dusty Allen is the only active Card to
have started more than 50 games last
year.
Allen will likely bat in the cleanup slot,
where he will be protected by switch-hit
ting Nate Olmstead. Olmstead, a junior
who was primarily used as a designated
hitter last year, will bat fifth and start in
left field.
While second baseman Jed Hansen and
shortstop Todd Laßocca have secured
starting roles as well, the rest of the Stan
ford lineup will be determined by the
Gaels' starting pitchers, according to
Stotz.
"At this point, three or four different
spots will change when we're facing a

right-handed or left-handed pitcher,"
Stotz said.
Among those lineup spots is the leadoff
role vacated by departed All-American Jef
frey Hammonds, a slot that could be filled
by Laßocca, freshman center fielder Cale
Carter or sophomore Jimmy Noriega.
Starting on the mound for Stanford
will be veteran juniors Willie Adams and
Andrew Lorraine. While Adams, who will
pitch tomorrow, has been a starter
throughout his collegiate career, the left
handed Lorraine was used primarily out
of the bullpen last season.
Card notes
On Wednesday, the Stanford Department of
Athletics announced the resignation of long
time pitching coach Tom Dunton. Dunton, who
began his service with the Cardinal in 1968, had
become a volunteer coach last year to comply
with NCAA bylaws restricting the number of
paid assistant coaching positions.
Under new NCAA guidelines, volunteer
coaches are no longer able to travel with their
teams. Both Marquess and Dunton felt that this
restriction would limit Dunton's effectiveness.
"It is unfortunate that a student-athlete
cannot benefit from an outstanding coach who
wants to volunteer his time with minimal
financial impact on the University," Marquess
said. "I will work actively towards changing
this particular rule."
Stotz will assume Dunton's pitching coach
duties for the remainder of 1993.
