# Cardinal tennis hosts San Diego
## 
### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
Out with the old and in with the new seems to be
the theme of the men's tennis program this year.
The graduation of Alex O'Brien and Jason Yee left a
big hole in the Cardinal squad, but four incoming
frosh hope to keep the team airtight and going
strong for a few more years.
Their challenge begins tomorrow when the Cardi
nal takes on the University of San Diego at noon in
the Stanford Tennis Stadium. Toting national
junior championships and impressive rankings,
Ricky Becker, Paul Galichia, Jeff Salzenstein and
Jim Thomas will face off against experienced upper
classmen teammates Roman Sydorak and Billy
Wright for the fourth, fifth and sixth singles spots in
tomorrow's match.
"Its going to be a dogfight," said head coach Dick
Gould of the challenge matches for the starting
spots.
With top man Michael Flanagan in San Francisco
for the Volvo Tournament's qualifying rounds, the
other three juniors, Chris Cocotos, Robert Devens
and Vimal Patel, have moved up a spot for this week
end's match.
Gould considers this year's freshman class "very
similar" to the junior class. Both had members
ranked in the top 10 (of junior divisions) and both
classes are very versatile on the court.
"They can all attack or stay back," he said.
"They're a great nucleus for the future." With only
one sophomore on the team, Mihir Mankad, these
freshmen will be the heart of the team after the pack
of juniors graduates.
For this reason, Gould stressed the need for the
rookies to focus on improving their games this year.
"This is a learning year. It is important that they do
not get caught up in positions — whether or not they
are in the starting lineup is really secondary."
Frosh Ricky Becker of Roslyn, N.Y., made an
impressive showing at the Pacific 10 Conference
Indoors two weeks ago. By reaching the semifinals of
both the Flight 4 singles and doubles, he showed
why he was ranked No. 7 in the juniors last year.
Gould notes his return-of-serve game as his pri
mary strength, but is quick to add that he can serve
and volley as well. "Ricky's an outstanding all-court
player," Gould said. "He's also a real fighter on the
court."
Paul Galichia has also proved himself to be a
fighter, by overcoming a devastating knee injury
which occurred two years ago. After winning several
national tennis championships when he was
younger, Galichia went on to become an All-State
basketball player. Blowing out his knee, consequent
ly, cost him his basketball career as well as a year
and a half of tennis.
However, he's come back with a vengeance. "He's
improving by leaps and bounds," Gould said. "If he's
patient with himself and doesn't get down on him
self he'll be fine."
The "most fundamentally solid of the group" is
Denver's Jeff Salzenstein. Ranked No. 4 in the 16-
and-Under division and then No. 2 in the 18s, the
left-hander has a punishing volley. Although Salzen
stein is still adjusting to a late growth spurt, Gould is
confident that "as his serve improves he'll be an out
standing player." Salzenstein teamed up with Becker
in the doubles of the Pac-10 Indoors in Seattle.
Thomas, at a towering 6-foot-4, was also a top
high school basketball player. His height lends him a
huge forehand and a big serve, but his movement
and agility need a bit of work, according to Gould.
Like Becker, Thomas reached the Flight 4 singles
semifinals in his Pac-10 debut two weeks ago.
