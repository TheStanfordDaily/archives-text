## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
For those who have been wait
ing patiently through the Jan
uary rain for action on the courts
of the Stanford Tennis Stadium,
the wait is finally over.
Stanford fans will get their
first look at the 1993 version of
the women's tennis team tomor
row, when the Cardinal hosts
Washington at 1:30 p.m.
Junior Laxmi Poruri and
senior Heather Willens will lead
Stanford into tomorrow's match
against the Huskies as the No. 1
and No. 2 Stanford players,
respectively.
Junior Kristine Kurth will
start in the No. 4 position for
Stanford, while freshman Beth
Berris opens her Cardinal career
on Saturday in the No. 5 spot.
Amy Chiminello rounds out the
varsity starters in the No. 6 posi
tion.
Kim Shasby, the No. 3 player
for the Cardinal, will not play in
tomorrow's matches. Kurth,
Berris, Chiminello and No. 7
Emma Woodhouse will move up a
spot to temporarily fill Shasby's
slot.
"We're obviously very excited
to get started," assistant coach
Lele Forood said. "Everyone's
healthy, and as they proved this

weekend, they're playing very,
very well."
Stanford took individual titles
in three of the six flights held at
the 1993 Pacific 10 Conference
Women's Indoor Tennis Tourna
ment held in Seattle last week
end.
Shasby and Berris captured
individual titles, while the team
of Shasby and Chiminello took
the doubles title in its flight.
Forood emphasized Stanford's
depth this year, noting that the
team will have some of its newer
players play every match.
"We'll be seeing players like
Woodhouse and Wendy Sacks
playing as much as possible,"
Forood said. "We want to give
everyone lots of experience this
year."
Battered by injuries through
out the lineup, the Cardinal
missed in its bid for a seventh
straight NCAA title last year
when it lost to Texas in the semi
finals of the tournament.
This year, however, Stanford
is at full strength, and Forood is
confident that Stanford will
return to championship form in
1993.
"We have a very positive atti
tude going into this year," Forood
said. "We're going to work hard
and play a very high level of ten
nis out there."
