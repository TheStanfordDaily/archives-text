### Sean May Staff writer 
The Stanford women's gymnastics team
returns home tonight to host the Chili's
"Bed Hot" Invitational against the Califor
nia Golden Bears and the UC-Santa Bar
bara Gauchos at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavil
ion.
The No. 20 Cardinal (1-2, 1-1 Pacific 10
Conference) has dropped eight spots since
the preseason rankings, but that doesn't
bother head coach Breck Greenwood. To
him, performance is what matters.
"Last year we weren't even a top-15 team
(at the end of the regular season), and we fin
ished 10th (at the NCAA Championships),"
he said.
Greenwood admits that he's been a little
disappointed in Stanford's performance so
far this year, but thinks things will be differ
ent this weekend.
"I'm confident we'll score 190 this week,"
he said, noting the level the team needs to
reach to be a top national team.
"Psychologically, they're a lot more pre
pared," added assistant coach Lisa Mitzel-

Izzi. "They're really ready to show it."
Greenwood cited lineup changes as part of
the reason that the Cardinal will improve its
score. Heralded freshman Hillary Anderson
will compete in the all-around for the first
time this season, and Jenny Ward will be per
forming a new bar routine.
Anderson has been performing only on
beam, floor and bars this season, while learn
ing a new vault, and she was spectacular
against Cai last week, scoring 9.725,9.65 and
9.85, respectively.
Last week was "one of the first times I
calmed down," she said.
Greenwood expects that the new lineup
will add at least a point to a point-and-a-half
to Stanford's score. The Cardinal's best per
formance of the year was a 188.15 total score.
Cal has been racked with injuries this
year, and Greenwood said that coach Pam
Burgess' Bears team (0-2, 0-2) is "not the
same team as they were last year," when they
were ranked No. 8.
Coached by Tim Rivera and led by Sarah
Lucas and Dana Faircloth, UCSB (2-0 over
all) is currently ranked eighth in the West
Region, with a top team score of 183.20.

"I don't think they're a big threat,"
Greenwood said.
The Cardinal athletes will be adding new
skills to their routines, although MitzeMzzi
stressed that these tricks aren't really "new."
"They've been doing the skills for a long
time," she said, adding that this meet is just
the first time they will be performed in com
petition.
The key to a good performance, according
to Mitzel-Izzi, is consistency and "mental
accuracy — knowing what the body needs to
do and doing it.
"We can't afford the small flaws and
breaks that cause deductions," she said.
According to Greenwood, the Cardinal has
been tired recently, which may have con
tributed to the team's recent flaws and
breaks. The squad took Monday off, and
Greenwood expects a rejuvenated team to be
in Maples tonight.
One athlete who has been putting on a
good show is sophomore Jen 6 Elzie, who set
a personal and school record with a 38.975
all-around score against Cal last week.
"We want to put on a great show," Green
wood said.
