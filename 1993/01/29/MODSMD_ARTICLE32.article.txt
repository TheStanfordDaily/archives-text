# Spikers look for clean wins on roadtrip
## 
### Rob Ross Staff writer 
Sporting a new, clean-shaven look, the
Stanford men's volleyball team takes their
first extended road trip this weekend.
Clean-shaven scalps, that is.
The third-ranked spikers, who all got hair
cuts a la the U.S. Olympic volleyball team last
Saturday, play three matches in two days,
starting with the University of the Pacific
tonight, then both UC-Davis and UC-Santa
Cruz at Davis on Saturday.
Although known for the strength of its
women's varsity program, Pacific has never
offered men's volleyball on the varsity level,
until this year. Moreover, in the trial-by-flre
method, the Tigers have entered the Mountain

Pacific Sports Federation, joining Stanford
and 12 other teams in the strongest confer
ence in the country.
Two freshman lead the Pacific squad — hit
ter David Ottenfeld, the Los Angeles City
Player of the Year, and setter Russell Gan, a
top recruit from Newport Harbor, Calif. Dar
ren Lance, a transfer student from Long
Beach State, brings varsity experience to the
Tiger lineup.
Pacific is 1-1 in their inaugural season. They
lost decisively to San Diego State, but rebound
ed to defeat UC-San Diego in four games.
On Saturday, the Cardinal travels to Davis
to play Santa Cruz at 2 p.m., followed by UC-
Davis at 7:30 p.m. in two non-conference
matches. Like California, UC-Davis offers only
club-level men's volleyball. A strong club

team, last year the Aggies advanced to the
semi-finals of the National Men's Volleyball
Club Championship.
Stanford is 1-1, losing to Pepperdine in the
third-place match in the UC-Santa Barbara
tournament and defeating California last Fri
day in straight games.
Stanford's match against Pacific tonight
marks the Cardinal's first true conference
match this season. Although the team faced
some conference teams in the UCSB tourna
ment, these matches do not count toward
league standings.
After next weekend's Cal rematch, the Stan
ford spikers play only one more non-league
opponent in 19 matches. Ten of these matches
will be played at home, seven at Burnham
Pavilion and three at Maples Pavilion.
