# Wrestlers look for wins
## 
### Sam Wu Staff writer 
The Stanford wrestling team
will prepare for its last two regu
lar season dual meets by compet
ing in Cal State-Bakersfield's
Country Classic Open this week
end.
Although the tournament
will influence neither team nor
individual standings, it will
provide valuable experience for
the freshman-dominated Car
dinal squad and respite for
grapplers still suffering from
injuries.
As an open tourney,
wrestlers of all backgrounds
may enter the Country Classic.
In addition to several Oregon
and California schools, Stan
ford expects junior colleges and
even assistant wrestling coach
es to compete. Accordingly,
opposition should prove
intense.
"The best wrestlers are often
between the ages of 25 and 30,"
said Cardinal head coach Chris
Horpel. "They peak after col
lege not only because of experi

ence, but because wrestling is
mostly about endurance. Power
is developed in college, but
endurance peaks later in life."
As he pointed out, seldom do
collegiate athletes represent their
nations in Olympic wresting.
Although nine young or oth
erwise inexperienced Stanford
grapplers will look to hone their
skills, some of their teammates
hope to place in or even win
their weight divisions.
Junior Lance Johnson, at
142 pounds, 126-pound senior
Dave Nowick and 134-pound
redshirt freshman Jimmy
Aguirre represent the Cardi
nal's best prospects for success.
Johnson boasts a 10-3 overall
record and a 6-1 dual-meet
standing. Nowick has captured
13 decisions overall and lost six,
while he is 5-2 in dual meets.
Aguirre stands at 7-3 overall.
He remains undefeated in dual
meets at a perfect 7-0.
Aguirre and company must
wait until Saturday to find out
exactly who their opponents
will be in the Country Classic
Open.
