The search committee for a director of
the Black Community Services Center has
whittled a field of 80 applicants down to five
finalists, one of whom spoke in El Centro
Chicano yesterday.
"On paper (the finalists! look great and
on the phone they sound great," said Dean
of Students Michael Jackson, a search com
mittee member. "It's getting fun. We have
some great people."
Each finalist will visit campus and give a
public presentation focussing on "their vi
sion for the Black Community Service Cen
ter and community building."
During a sparsely attended meeting yes
terday, finalist Zizwe Poe told 11 students

and several administrators about his mis
sion to move beyond diversity in skin color
to cultural diversity.
After his presentation, Poe answered a
few questions posed by audience members
concerning his ideas for improving unity
and Stanford's relationship with East Palo
Alto.
Poe serves as the director of African
(Black) Student Programs at UC-Davis and
chairs the school's multicultural events and
relations committee.
Another finalist, Czerny Brasuell, is also
one of the five top candidates for the multi
cultural educator position and completed all
of her interviews in one visit during early
January, Jackson said.
