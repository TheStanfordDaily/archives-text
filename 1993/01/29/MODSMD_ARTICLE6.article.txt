### Linda Friedlieb Staff writer 
The search committee for a director of
the Black Community Services Center has
whittled a field of 80 applicants down to five
finalists, one of whom spoke in El Centro
Chicano yesterday.
"On paper (the finalists! look great and
on the phone they sound great," said Dean
of Students Michael Jackson, a search com
mittee member. "It's getting fun. We have
some great people."
Each finalist will visit campus and give a
public presentation focussing on "their vi
sion for the Black Community Service Cen
ter and community building."
During a sparsely attended meeting yes
terday, finalist Zizwe Poe told 11 students

and several administrators about his mis
sion to move beyond diversity in skin color
to cultural diversity.
After his presentation, Poe answered a
few questions posed by audience members
concerning his ideas for improving unity
and Stanford's relationship with East Palo
Alto.
Poe serves as the director of African
(Black) Student Programs at UC-Davis and
chairs the school's multicultural events and
relations committee.
Another finalist, Czerny Brasuell, is also
one of the five top candidates for the multi
cultural educator position and completed all
of her interviews in one visit during early
January, Jackson said.
She is currently the director
of the Development and Com
munity Organization at the
Christie Institute South in
North Carolina.
The other three candidates
are:
• Steven Birdine, director of
the Marcus Garvey Center at the
University of Northern Colorado,
who will visit March 5;

• Dr. Judith James, executive
director of the Teaching Leader
ship Consortium — Ohio, who
will visit Feb. 9; and
• John Ortiz-Hutsom, the stu
dent affairs officer responsible for
the Learning Skills Center at UC-
Davis, who will visit Feb. 5.
Since Birdine's visit will not take
place until early March, it is unlike
ly that the new director will take
office before spring quarter. The
committee had previously hoped to
have a person in place by Jan. 1.
The search for a new assistant
dean and director of the BCSC

began when former Asst. Dean
Keith Archuleta resigned after
being arrested June 2 for secretly
videotaping women during pho
tography sessions in his Mir
rielees apartment.
Archuleta was sentenced to
four years probation and 200
hours of community service, after
pleading no contest to two misde
meanor accounts of electronic
eavesdropping.
The assistant director of the
BCSC, Barbara Smith, has served
as acting director during the
search.
