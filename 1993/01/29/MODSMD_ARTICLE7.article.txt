# Increasing applicant pool
## More high school seniors vie for spot in Class of '97 
### Miranda Doyle Senior staff writer 
Applications for Stanford's freshman
class crept slightly upward this year to more
than 13,500, despite a nationwide drop in
graduating high school seniors.
"I'm pleased with the quality of the files I
have seen thus far," said Dean of Undergrad
uate Admissions James Montoya of the
13,542 applications received. He noted that
the number does not include 96 students who
have not paid their fee and may still do so.
The increase brings the number of appli
cants up to where it was two years ago. "It
makes sense that we would hold steady,"
Montoya said.
Changing demographics have led to
fewer high school graduates and more uni-

versity competition for the
cream of a smaller crop.
But "next year we plan on
seeing an increase in grad
uates," Montoya added.
A decline of about 300
student applicants last
year coincided with in
creases at Harvard, Prince
ton, Yale and other com
petitive universities.

Three years ago, the number of appli
cants hit a 10-year low amid speculation that
the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake may have
frightened away some high school seniors.
Stanford reached the height of its popular
ity in 1985 with more than 17,000 hopefuls.

Applications fell until 1990, then
rebounded to this year's level.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions must now wade
through the thousands of applica

tions to choose the entering class.
In the past, around 2,800 stu
dents have received the good news
each year.
Approximately 55 percent of
those who are admitted have
enrolled at Stanford in recent
years, for an entering class of
about 1,500 freshmen. "I'm antic
ipating a similar yield rate to

what we've had," Montoya said.
University officials have
expressed concern this year that
$2.5 million cuts in Financial Aids
will damage Stanford's ability to
attract the best students.
"There may be more students
looking at financial aid," Montoya
admitted. But he added, "I expect
Stanford will remain competitive."
