## Event Faire promotes prudent party planning 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
Music, EANABs, food and even
condoms were available at yester
day's "party on parties" at Tresid
der Union. The only thing missing
from the Event Planning Faire
was alcohol.
And that was fine with the
Party Pro's, who coordinated the
event in an effort to decrease the
focus on alcohol at campus par
ties. The student group is based at
Cowell Student Health Center.
"Our purpose was to increase
students' knowledge about busi
nesses in the area that can help
them put on better parties," said
Stewart Kiner, coordinator of the
Faire and project coordinator for
student health services at Cowell.
"We have one every quarter.
About 50 students attend from
various organizations," he said.
"We help set up an alcohol poli
cy and train bartenders for events
at the University," said Philip
Hwang, one member of the group
who worked at the Faire.
The group also conducts work
shops on non-alcoholic beverages
and helps with planning and
preparation in general, he said.
Many businesses attended the
Faire, mostly in an attempt to
publicize their goods and services
on campus.
"Another goal of the event is to

make parties more fun," Kiner
said. That involves finding quali
fied people to provide music, en
tertainment and advertisement.
"We came to the Faire in order
to reestablish the link with the
University that we lost when we
graduated," said Bill Barenboim
of Divine Beat Sounds, an on-cam
pus D.J. company that handed out
records and condoms at the event.
The Ad Agency, another on-cam
pus group, was also on hand at the
Faire. "We aid in design and distrib
ution of fliers and posters to dorms
and students," said A. R. Jones, a
resident assistant at Branner
"I feel like the people that come
to this will actually use the ser
vice," Jones said.
Prior to the Faire, which lasted
from 5-6 p.m., there was a session
on events planning at Tresidder,
according to Kiner.
"During the session, we worked
on giving people from on-campus
organizations suggestions for fun
and safe parties."
