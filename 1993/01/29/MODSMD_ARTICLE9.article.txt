# Court fight after search of office
## 
### Ari Richter Senior staff writer 
In gaining its independence, The
Daily joined many other college papers
around the country in taking what
The New York Times called "a step
toward professionalism."
But when The Daily wound up in
the Supreme Court, it was blazing a
brand new trail.
On Friday, April 9, 1971, police
moved to end a 30-hour sit-in that had
been staged at Stanford Hospital to
protest the firing of a black employee.
Violence between the police and the
protesters ensued, and The Daily
printed a special Sunday edition with
photos and coverage of the clash.
On Monday, in what most
observers believe was an unprecedent
ed occurrence, four Palo Alto and two
Stanford policemen showed up at The
Daily with a warrant to search the
offices for photographs of the violence
that might be used as evidence.
"It was the first time in U.S. histo
ry a paper was subjected to a search
warrant, not a subpoena," according
to former Daily editor Fred Mann.
Mann was one of several plaintiffs to
bring suit against the police officers in
federal district court.
"Being searched is a lot like being
raped," remarks Dan Fiduccia, a Daily
staffer from 1974 to 1979 who has
continued to watch the courts and the
way they have responded to media
searches. "It's a horrible invasion of
privacy; it's largely underreported,
and it can never be repaired."
Outraged at the actions of the
police, prominent journalists quickly
came to the side of The Daily. If the
police could rummage through entire
newspaper offices, these journalists
feared, the threat of such a search
would create a dramatic chilling effect
on the freedom of the press.
Federal District Court Judge

Robert Peckham agreed, ruling on
Oct. 5, 1972, that "the officials had
violated Fourth Amendment protec
tions against unreasonable searches
and seizures by failing to establish suf
ficient cause to obtain the search war
rant used in the case," The Daily
reported the next day.
Peckham also said, "The First
Amendment infringements with search
es of newspapers are quite serious," and
such searches "are impermissible in all
but a very few situations."
The Daily's victory was sweeping
and seemingly gained even more force
when the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals unanimously upheld it.
But the case went on to the
Supreme Court, where in May 1978 a
5-to-3 majority reversed the decision
of the appellate court, striking a
blow to the freedom of the press.

The Court's ruling in Zurcher v. Stan
ford Daily held that the use of a search
warrant by police officers to obtain evi
dence from Daily files was a legal search
under the Fourth Amendment and that
such a search did not abridge The Daily's
First Amendment rights.
Congress responded to the Zurcher
case by passing the Privacy Protection
Act of 1980, a shield law protecting so
called "work products" and "docu
mentary material." Included in the
former category are reporters' notes
and undeveloped film.
But despite the legislation, "State
and federal raids on the mass media
continue," according to Fiduccia, who
says more than 20 searches have been
performed since 1980. "Congress has
provided no oversight, and the Justice
Department has been providing its
own interpretations."
