You can influence a world of
cutting edge technology,
just by working on ours.
By applying your technical skills to our silicon solutions,
you can influence an entire generation of products,
worldwide. We have opportunities spanning three
strategic markets: Analog, including high fidelity personal
audio and video products, medical diagnostic equipment, and
automotive systems; Communications, like network management,
wireless systems, and data hubs; and Personal Systems, encom
passing portable and battery operated PCs, peripherals and
personal information devices.
We are now recruiting Stanford individuals with a BS/MSEE in the
following engineering areas, with a special focus on individuals
with an analog interest:
Design • Applications • Product • Test
We will be on campus soon to discuss in more
detail how you can influence the world at
National Semiconductor.
