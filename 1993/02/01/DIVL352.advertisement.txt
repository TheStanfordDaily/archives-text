Then This Is Just A Watch.
It's time we set the record straight. Oracle created the
world's first commercially available relational data
base. Just as Seiko created the world's first quartz watch
without a battery.* Both remarkable feats. But our
technology didn't stop with database software, any
more than theirs stopped with telling the time.
Today, Oracle provides total systems solutions
through database, tools, applications, and services. Our
products run on more than 100 computer platforms and
are currently offered in 92 countries around the world.
Imagine applying your skills
in advanced networking,
CASE, application develop
ment, office automation,
development tools, multi
media, massively parallel
technology, and more.
So when you're ready to transform your education
into an exciting career, don't just settle for any software
company - choose Oracle.
We are interested in individuals with technical
degrees for positions in Software Development. Techni
cal Support, Consulting and Product Management.
