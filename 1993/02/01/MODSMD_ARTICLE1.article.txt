# Immortal Bill
## Walsh named to Hall of Fame 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer with AP wire reports 
Stanford football coach Bill Walsh, who
recorded three Super Bowl wins as coach of
the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s, was
elected to the National Football League
Hall of Fame on Saturday.
Walsh, who returned to coaching this year
after retiring from the 49ers in 1988, led the
Cardinal to a 10-3 record, a Blockbuster
Bowl victory and a No. 9 national ranking.
"It's a total surprise," Walsh said. "I had
hoped that someday I'd be considered, but
this is just fantastic."
He was one of five members chosen for
the honor by a 34-member media panel, and
will be inducted on July 31 in Canton, Ohio,
along with former Pittsburgh Steelers'
coach Chuck Noll, former Chicago Bears
running back Walter Payton, former San
Diego Chargers quarterback Dan Fouts and
former Miami Dolphins offensive lineman
Larry Little.

'I had hoped that someday
I'd be considered.'

Walsh, 62, began his head-coaching ca
reer at Stanford in 1977 andguided the Car
dinal to two bowl-game victories before he
was hired by San Francisco owner Eddie
Deßartolo Jr. in 1979 to coach the 49ers.
He took over a team that was 2-14 in
1978, and in just three seasons took the
Niners to the first of three Super Bowl ti
tles. Walsh's teams won six NFC Western
Division championships, and Super Bowls
in 1982, 1985 and 1989.
Elected in only his second year of eligibil
ity, Walsh, along with Noll, will be one of 14
coaches in the Hall.
Walsh found it "ironic" that he will be in
ducted in the same year as Fouts, whom he


Head football coach Bill Walsh
coached while offensive coordina
tor at San Diego in 1976, prior to
taking the job with Stanford.
One of the deans of the coach
ing profession, Walsh revolution
ized the game with his wide-open
offensive schemes. Currently,
four of his proteges — Dennis
Green (Minnesota), Mike Holm
gren (Green Bay), George Siefert
(San Francisco) and Sam Wyche
(Tampa Bay) — are head coaches
in the NFL.
"He definitely deserves it,"
•aid Stanford quarterback Steve
Stenstrom. "It was just a matter
of time before he was inducted.

He is one of the greatest names in
all of football."
At first, Walsh, who was in Los
Angeles for the Super Bowl, was
skeptical when he saw the mes
sage light blinking on his hotel
room phone. Given his penchant
for practical jokes, Walsh
assumed someone else was
returning the favor.
"When I checked into my hotel
and got the message, I thought
one of the guys out parking cars
was playing a little trick on me,"
Walsh said.
Walsh now owns the distinc
tion of being the only active coach
in the Hall of Fame.
"This is the ultimate individu
al satisfaction," he said. "It closes
out something, after all the years
you sacrificed and struggled."
