## Walsh named to Hall of Fame 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer with AP wire reports 
Stanford football coach Bill Walsh, who
recorded three Super Bowl wins as coach of
the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s, was
elected to the National Football League
Hall of Fame on Saturday.
Walsh, who returned to coaching this year
after retiring from the 49ers in 1988, led the
Cardinal to a 10-3 record, a Blockbuster
Bowl victory and a No. 9 national ranking.
"It's a total surprise," Walsh said. "I had
hoped that someday I'd be considered, but
this is just fantastic."
He was one of five members chosen for
the honor by a 34-member media panel, and
will be inducted on July 31 in Canton, Ohio,
along with former Pittsburgh Steelers'
coach Chuck Noll, former Chicago Bears
running back Walter Payton, former San
Diego Chargers quarterback Dan Fouts and
former Miami Dolphins offensive lineman
Larry Little.

'I had hoped that someday
I'd be considered.'

Walsh, 62, began his head-coaching ca
reer at Stanford in 1977 andguided the Car
dinal to two bowl-game victories before he
was hired by San Francisco owner Eddie
De√üartolo Jr. in 1979 to coach the 49ers.
He took over a team that was 2-14 in
1978, and in just three seasons took the
Niners to the first of three Super Bowl ti
tles. Walsh's teams won six NFC Western
Division championships, and Super Bowls
in 1982, 1985 and 1989.
Elected in only his second year of eligibil
ity, Walsh, along with Noll, will be one of 14
coaches in the Hall.
Walsh found it "ironic" that he will be in
ducted in the same year as Fouts, whom he
