Clinton visits Camp David
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton returned yesterday to the White
House for meetings with the nation's
governors following a two-day retreat
with his Cabinet that he convened to
discuss plans for reviving the economy.
"We worked hard for two days and it
was great," Clinton said, shouting to
reporters above the roar of his helicopter
after he returned from Camp David, Md.
It was his first trip as president to the
compound in the Catoctin Mountains
north of Washington.
Asked if he finished his economic
plan at the presidential retreat, Clinton
said: "We spent a lot of time talking
about it."
While Clinton wrapped up the private
retreat, a key lawmaker said the admin
istration should stop considering a curb
on Social Security benefits to reduce the
deficit.
"That's a death wish and let's get it
out of the way and forget it right now,"
said Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
chairman of the Senate Finance Com

mittee, when asked about putting a tem
porary freeze on the yearly cost-of-living
increase on Social Security benefits.
