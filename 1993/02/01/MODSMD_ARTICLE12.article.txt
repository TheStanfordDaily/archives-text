# Govs. discuss national health care
## Proposal says universal coverage a 'moral imperative' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The nation's
governors, saying universal health care
is a "moral imperative," began formal
consideration yesterday for their propos
al to extend coverage to all Americans.
The proposal adopted by a committee
of the National Governors Association
calls for guaranteed access to health care
for every citizen and minimum federal
standards to reduce medical liability costs.
Under its "managed competitive"
approach, the government would main
tain a national database through which
consumers could receive information
about the cost and quality of health care
services.
In addition, the government would
expand its support for primary and pre
ventive health care programs, including
periodic health screenings, prenatal
care, well-baby care and childhood
immunizations.
"Everybody's looking for a broad
based basic framework," said South
Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell, a
Republican and member of the commit
tee that designed the plan.

The full association will vote tomorrow
on the plan, which will be presented to
Congress and President Clinton, who only
recently left the organization's ranks. The
governors will meet with Clinton today to
discuss health care and other issues.
Clinton made universal health care a
central theme of his campaign last year,
but has not yet unveiled his plan.
In addition to implementing nation
wide coverage, he promised an annual
spending cap on health care, tax changes
to discourage rapid increases in drug
prices, insurance reforms including a
universal claim form and "pools" allow
ing small businesses to band together to
buy more affordable coverage.
Clinton has received promises of
cooperation from state officials and the
medical community has agreed with the
idea of universal health care but been
unable to refine a proposal of its own to
submit to the president.
Last month, the insurance industry
proposed a sweeping universal care plan
that would be financed partly by taxing
Americans with generous benefits. The

nation's business community, con
cerned about rising costs of health care
coverage, have generally embraced Clin
ton's cost containment ideas.
Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh of Indi
ana said governors were motivated by
fears that the economy and federal bud
get deficit will not improve "unless we
deal with health care."
Texas Gov. Ann Richards, a Demo
crat, abandoned an attempt to exclude
the so-called "tort reform" language
addressing medical liability costs. The
final draft of the plan proposes that
Congress set nationwide limits on mal
practice liability and allow states to
adopt even tighter restrictions.
Tort reform backers generally sup
port limits on medical liability coverage,
believing such curbs will bring medical
malpractice costs under control and
result in lower health care costs.
Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Florida Demo
crat, warned that the federal govern
ment "ain't gonna want this ball" and
Congress would prefer that the states
deal with the issue.
