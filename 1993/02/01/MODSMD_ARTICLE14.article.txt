# Editorial
## Editor's welcome 
### 
Becoming an adult isn't
easy. Just ask anyone who's
turned 21 recently. Sure,
there's the partying. Sure, you can
whine, "Mom, give me a break, I'm
an adult" with some credibility.
And you can stop doing that crazy
ID-switching thing in your wallet.
Hut no one really believes adult
hood is instantaneous — that
overnight you become grown-up
and know all there is to know for
the rest of your life. Heck, if that
were true, I would have gotten
boobs only this year, pigtails would
be fashionable for 17 year-olds and
all those self-improvement mid
life-crises audio tapes would never
exist.
No, growing up is a gradual
thing. . . so gradual we often don't
even notice it. Sure there's the
obligatory cake-and-candles yearly.
But the fact is, until we're about
40, none of us in the "X-genera
tion" will feel comfortable with
that "adult" label. With that
responsibility. With that indepen
dence.
Twenty years ago this week,
The Daily became independent. We
broke free from our parents — the
ASSU and the University — who
published our pages until Jan. 29,
1973. We became free from the
fear that we would be manipulat
ed. We became free from the fear of
censorship. We became more than
a little scared about our allowance
being cut off. But we were excited.
Now that we're 40 free volumes
old, we've finally come to terms
with those three little words we
run under our flag: "An Indepen
dent Publication." Sure, we've
done things we never would have
done with our parents around —
like taking the police to the
Supreme Court. We've built up our
savings. We've made some mis
takes and learned from them.
We've become middle aged, pure
and simple.
The sad truth is, we've gotten
complacent. Too often we've wait
ed for the news to come to us.
We've written reactive editorials

instead of bringing issues to the
attention of the campus. We've
copied others instead of setting the
trends.
It's about time for a mid-life cri
sis.
Frankly, we've got to re-exam
ine ourselves. We've got to pull out
our hair and cry on the bathroom
floor and question a lot of what we
take for granted around this place.
And while we probably all won't
move to Hawaii next week, start a
nudist colony and begin writing on
palm leaves, we'd like to encourage
the rest of you to give us your
input. Wake up, dammit, and tell
us what you think!
We're going to try some new
things, go back to doing some old
things and scrap some of what for
too long we've accepted without
question.
In short, we're intending to
bring you a more investigative,
analytical look at the campus. We
want to make you aware of issues
before, not after, they happen.
We'll strive to entertain you, to
humor you, to surprise you with
our innovation and shock you with
our creativity.
But rejuvenation can't happen
with just words; it requires con
crete planning. So, for instance,
we've named an art director to
enhance our design; we're bring
ing back a real forum for humor;
and we've committed ourselves to
an aggressive staff development
program which will improve our
coverage and ensure a solid Daily
for years to come.
Growing up doesn't have to
mean stagnating. I'd rather strug
gle with a tough judgment call
than complacently bemoan the
fact that we've settled once again.
After all, you're only as old as
you feel.
