Members of football team defend cheerleaders

Your editorial on jan. 22
concerning the cheerleaders was
not merely rude and uncalled for;
it insulted the students of Stanford Uni
versity by implying that we must all be
blind, deaf and decidedly stupid.
The Dollies and Band, you wrote,
are "quite sufficient as instruments of
spirit," while you call the cheerleaders
unnecessary, among other things.
Strangely, while maligning the cheer
squad on page 4, you ran an article on
page 7 praising the deafening noise
generated by the Thursday night
Maples crowd as women's basketball
gained another victory. Clearly, the
"hand clapping, foot stomping and
screaming of the fans" contributed to
the thrilling win that night, but exact
ly who do you suppose was coordinat
ing and helping to facilitate that vol
ume? Certainly not the Dollies, who,
in Los Angeles at the men's game,
were chasing the television camera's
as usual.
No, it was the cheerleaders. Coinci
dence? We don't think so.
It is also no coincidence that, as mem
bers of the Stanford football team, we
have had ample opportunity to familiar
ize ourselves with the "efforts" of the

Dollies and band. The Dollies appeared
to be working very hard to "instill spir
it" at the game against USC this season,
for example, where they lounged on
lawn chairs and sipped drinks through
out the game, at one point on national
television.
The home-field advantage enjoyed by
Arizona, Notre Dame, Washington,
UCLA, USC, Washington State, etc., is
not created by the timing of the jump in
a fight song; it results when the stadium
crowd is so loud that the opposing line
men cannot hear the calls of their quar
terback. As anyone who has attended a
Stanford football game is aware, no such
advantage exists in Stanford Stadium.
To attack the cheerleaders, a group
which is trying valiantly to address the
lack of crowd participation here, is a slap
in the face to the football program and
men's and women's basketball, as well.
It will probably be a while before Stan
ford Stadium sounds like the home
fields of other football powerhouses, but
some "Go Stanford"sand synchronized
clapping are certainly a start, and they
were started by Denny Green's creation
of a cheerleading squad.
By the way, whatever was the Athlet
ics Department thinking when it aimed

for, as you said, "a wholesome-looking,
alumni-pleasing group?" Should it
instead have assembled a sleazy-looking,
alumni-repulsive group? Perhaps we
should replace the current "brawny and
buxom" squad, as your editorial
described it, with one which is more
flabby and unathletic. You juxtapose the
"hard-working club sport athletes" who
must "spend weekends taking tickets at
the football stadium or working on other
fund raisers," with the cheerleaders,
who presumably neither work hard nor
fund-raise on their own.
As for hard work, anyone can see that
the gymnastics, jumps, stunts, etc.
exhibited by the cheerleaders do not
result from lounging on lawn chairs.
During early workouts this summer,
when we hit the field in the morning,
the cheerleaders were already hard at
work on theirs. We saw them perform
ing for alumni, selling T-shirts and
other things to finance travel to away
games. Apparently, all you saw was a
line of "pretty white skirts."
Incidentally, as anyone who has
attended a game recently knows, the
cheerleaders' uniforms are cardinal, our
school color, not white, as you stated,
aud not even red, the color the Band and

the Dollies choose to wear. You would
not, however, need to go to a game in
order to know that the Dollies wore red
during football season, for some of them
attended fraternity parties in their uni
forms, as well.
To address another point you raised,
you must all have auditory damage, for
those of us who attend basketball games
regularly have failed to ever detect the
"collective groan of the crowd" you say
the cheerleaders inspire. We have heard
a few isolated "boos" emanate from the
band on occasion, but the crowd
response usually consists of an increase
in cheering, clapping or stomping. As we
understand it, that's precisely what the
cheerleaders are there for.
Finally, with a new president in
office, American troops in Somalia and
bombing in Iraq, we wonder what exact
ly motivated you to use your editorial
space to needlessly attack a small stu
dent group in the first place. No one
appreciates such an irresponsibly petty
display. And if that's an overstatement,
it's not much of one.
