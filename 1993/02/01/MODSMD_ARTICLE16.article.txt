# Student accuses ADL of spying, harassment
## 
### 
In the Jan. 28 issue of The Daily,
Benjamin Bromberg took issue with my
observation that "the Anti-Defamation
League gathers information on the
Nazis, skinheads and KKK, and puts in
the same category anyone who criticizes
Israel." I stand by the statement — and
the fact that such intimidation has pro
foundly limited discussion of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict among
Americans.
Unfortunately, the ADL has a long

record of harassment of anyone sympa
thetic to the plight of the Palestinians.
Since the early 1980s, when the ADL
defined "the real anti-Semitism" in
America as any criticism of Israel (see
"The Real Anti-Semitism" by former
ADL head Nathan Perlmutter and Ruth
Perlmutter), the organization's worth
while work regarding human rights and
violence against Jews has been seriously
compromised.
I can recount several instances in
which I have been personally slandered
or targeted for surveillance because of
my views as a Jewish critic of Israel. Yet
the Stanford community need not look
any further than an investigation cur-

rently being conducted by the San Fran
cisco police to consider ADL's question
able methods.
Former San Francisco police officer
Tom Gerard is being investigated for
allegedly selling information on the
activities of Arab-Americans and other
advocates of Israeli-Palestinian peace —
as well as opponents of South African
apartheid to the Israeli and South
African governments, respectively. For a
decade, Officer Gerard worked closely
with an undercover agent of the ADL,
Roy Bullock. Police files may have been
improperly obtained by the ADL, and
search warrants have been issued for
ADL offices in San Francisco and

Orange County. The case, raising con
cerns of possible police and ADL miscon
duct with both serious international and
constitutional ramifications, has rocked
the City.
While the investigation of the Gerard
case has only just been launched, ADL
involvement in the affair does not come
as a surprise to supporters of Palestini
an rights and Middle East peace. Rather
than seeking "to foster more intelligent
and reasoned discussion of Israeli poli
cy," as Bromberg asserts, the ADL has
consistently done just the opposite.
