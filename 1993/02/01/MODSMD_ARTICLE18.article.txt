## It's all in the letters 
### 
Grades come and we grumble
or exalt, breathe sighs of relief
or sighs of what might have
been.
All of last quarter is condensed into
neat little symbols. "A" is good, "B" is
not so good and so on down the line to
"NC."
Why do grades hold such power to
enervate and enthrall us?
I think our obsession with grades is of
a purely aesthetic nature, and all of our
responses to the gamut of the grading
alphabet can be traced to concerns with
beauty.
We strive for "A'"s, for example,
because the "A" is the most beautiful of
the letters. Of the regular grading range
A-F, "A" is the only symmetrical charac
ter.
It is stable and balanced, and this
appeals to our instinctual need for secu
rity. The phrase "straight A's" reflects a
similar desire— straight "A'"s is a pre
dictable and safe pattern.
In fact, the "A" is composed of only
straight lines. Its even, solidly-planted
legs are braced by a firm cross beam. "A"
isn't going anywhere, no way— it's here
to stay. It's solid, like a pyramid. Or a
house (A-frame).
"A" has a smooth, cool sound. It was
the Fonz's letter (eehhh. . .), and it
adorns neat phrases like "A-OK."
But as the alphabet is arranged, just

when we're really starting to enjoy the
easy, fluid "A" tone, "B" comes along
and ruins all of our vocal pleasure.
"B'"s plosive sound has an abrupt,
stopping quality to it. "A" is a deep, vel
vety, saxophone tone playing softly on
the stereo and "B" bumbles in, trips over
the chord and turns on the lights, ruin
ing the mood.
And if "A" is the sturdy roof that pro
tects us, "B" is the blundering, beer-bel
lied bum that sits under it. Put a remote
control in its hand and "B" becomes a
couch-bound sloth, burping at the foot
ball game on TV.
Just look at it. "B" is lazy. It's made of
two folds of fat, and it won't get off its
ass except to go to the refrigerator or the
bathroom. (In fact, tipped backwards,
the "B" actually looks like an ass). The
"B" is all unrealized energy. It might
have been an "A" if it had only tried a lit
tle harder.
The "C," on the other hand, wishes it
could enjoy "B'"s gluttonous lifestyle.
The "C" is hungry, empty. Its shape,
hollow and carved-out. "C" is the
mediocre middle child. It never received
the attention afforded to the favorite
son, "A," or the irreverent, boisterous
"F." The "C" stands for neglect. If any
body cared, they would round out "C"
with a simple connecting line and make
it a nice, full, symmetrical "O". But
nobody cares. If the "C" had a color, it

would be dull yellow. Or beige. Blah. Go
away, "C."
The "D" is dumb. It is even worse
than "B," which is too lazy to straighten
itself up and become an "A," because all
"D" has to do is slip downward to "F"
and find some real flare. If you're going
to fail, go all the way.
The "F" has character and verve. If it
lacks "A'"s fixity and symmetry, at least
the "F" stands tall and certain. It looks
like a flag, it announces itself and
screams out in rebellion like a little
junior high school skate rat: "Yeah!
Fuck you! I failed!" Big, fat middle fin
ger in your face. "F"!! So much more
exciting than "NC." I say, bring back the
"F"!
Sure, grades might have some correla
tion with our performance in class, but
that symbolic importance is secondary.
Our real satisfaction with "A"'s, our
uneasiness with "B'"s— all of our emo
tional and psychological responses to
grades are rooted in aesthetics. It's all in
the letters.
