# AIDS quilt may spend a weekend here

### Lenora Chu Staff writer 
A section of the famous 26-acre AIDS quilt
— which consists of 30,000 panels listing the
names of AIDS victims — may make a weekend
stop at Stanford in late February in conjunc
tion with national AIDS Awareness Week.
After seeing a large portion of the quilt dis
played in Washington, D.C., members of Stan
ford's Committee for the AIDS Quilt thought
"that Stanford would be a great place to display
the quilt," said sophomore Chris Levinson.
But Levinson, who is heading the effort to
bring the quilt here, said transforming the
group's plans into reality has not been easy.
"We were hoping that the fact that the quilt
was started by Stanford graduates would aid us

in getting the quilt to come, but that has not
been the case," she said, noting the quilt has
become world-famous and in demand since its
early days in 1987.
According to committee members, safety is
the main obstacle in getting the quilt to appear
at Stanford. The Names Project, the group that
oversees the quilt, is engaged in a "constant
struggle to protect it," said Levinson.
"It's very emotional for a lot of people, and
we want to respect that and do the right thing,"
said Andrew Lisac, assistant dean of continu
ing studies and a member of the AIDS quilt
committee.
"Names (Project) does not allow [the quilt] to be
on display outdoors, with the exception of Wash
ington, D.C., so a big problem is finding a large, in
doors, open space on campus," Levinson said.

One idea the committee proposed v.as to
hang sections of the quilt from the arches in
the Inner Quad, she said.
The quilt project was started by Stanford
alumni Cleve Jones and Mike Smith and is
based in San Francisco "with an office full of
sewing machines," said Levinson.
Stanford's quilt committee
hopes to get a section of the quilt
that is specific to northern Cali
fornia's AIDS victims.
"The quilt has never been
viewed this far up in California,
and we want to get people out
side of Stanford, in the Bay
Area, involved in this," said
Levinson.

Project Save, one of the groups
helping to organize AIDS Aware
ness Week on campus, is sponsor
ing a quilt panel contest at Stan
ford. The contest calls for the
design of a six-foot square section,
representing Stanford's addition
to the massive quilt. The winner
will receive a $50 prize.
"Although this panel is affiliat
ed with Stanford, anyone who's
lost anyone to AIDS is encour
aged to come and contribute
thoughts" after the initial design
is completed, said Levinson.
