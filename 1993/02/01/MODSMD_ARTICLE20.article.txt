## Cardinal lets one get away, drops 68-67 heartbreaker 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
They're getting closer.
Rich Manning sank an eight
foot turnaround with 25 seconds
left and Marcus Lollie's last-gasp
attempt missed long off the back
of the rim as Washington narrow
ly beat Stanford, 68-67, at Maples
Pavilion Saturday night.
"I don't know what we have to
do to win," said Stanford coach
Mike Montgomery.
Stanford (6-13, 1-6 Pacific 10
Conference) shot over 50 percent
from the field for the third time
this season, and became only the
second team to reach that mark
against Washington (9-7, 3-4).
The Cardinal opened the sec
ond half with a blazing 11-2 run to
gain the largest lead of the game
for either team at 45-40, which
Stanford matched two more times
before Washington closed in.
"They came out in the second
half and just lit it up," Manning
said. "They were hot."
Forward Brent Williams came
to life after the break, leading the
surge for the Cardinal with 13 sec
ond-half points and six rebounds.
"I kept calling '42 Counter'
because Brent got the feel of it and
was scoring every time down,"
Lollie said.
While the Cardinal was able to
cool off Manning in the second
half, Husky guard Prentiss
Perkins picked up the slack. In the
opening period, Stanford's guards
sagged away from the Huskies'
perimeter players in order to dou
ble-team Washington's big men.
Aside from Manning, three for
wards — Mark Pope, Martin
Keane and Chandler Nairn —
would kick the ball back outside,
where guards Perkins and Bryant
Boston shot a combined 5-for-10.
Stanford played the percentages
again after the intermission, but

Perkins made the Cardinal pay by
sinking 4-of-5 outside shots, two
from three-point range.
Stanford fell victim to three
questionable calls by official Jerry
White after taking a 64-60 lead on
a Brent Williams putback with
3:38 to play. First, Washington
came down the floor, Perkins
went up for a shot in front of the
free-throw line and Lollie was
called for a foul. Perkins went to
the line and made both free
throws.
Peter Dukes was called for
travelling on the Cardinal's next
trip, after an apparent hack by
Boston, and then Jim Morgan was
called for a foul on Manning that
put the Huskies in the bonus. Two
minutes later, Manning swished
his shot from the baseline, leaving
Stanford with one final chance for
victory.
But for the second time in as
many games, the burden of win
ning fell on Lollie's shoulders.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
the game had an ending similar to
last Thursday's Washington State
contest. Lollie dribbled the ball off
his foot again, but this time he
recovered the ball before it went
out of bounds, only to put up a
shot that left Stanford one point
short at the buzzer.
"Washington made the plays
that they had to make," Mont
gomery said. "In our last posses
sion we mishandled the ball and
Marcus attempted a real tough
shot. We were one play away. It's
always frustrating to come that
close. We just have to continue to
work hard."
Montgomery shook up his line
up in an attempt to gain more
offense from the outset at the off
guard spot, replacing Dukes with
freshman Dion Cross. Cross
responded with eight first-half


Vincent Ho — Daily
Todd Manley and the Cardinal cannot get head and shoulders above Washington on
Saturday. After leading for much of the second half, Stanford suffered a disheartening
loss to the Huskies in the game's closing minutes.
