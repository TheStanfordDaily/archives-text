# Final seconds remind fans of team's year-long struggle

### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
In the last 21 seconds of Stanford's game
against Washington Saturday, fans of Cardinal
men's basketball got yet another look at what has
been the story for the team all year — missed
opportunities.
With 2:06 left in regulation, senior guard Peter
Dukes, who has been in a shooting slump for the
last seven games, found the bottom of the net
from three-point range to put the Cardinal ahead
67-64.
Thirty seconds later, however, Husky forward
Mark Pope made two free throws off a Bart Lam
mersen foul to cut the lead to 67-66 with 1:33 to
go in the game.
Another trip down the court produced nothing
for the Cardinal, but Husky center Rich Manning
rushed down the court and made a eight-foot
jumper, putting Washington ahead 68-67 and
leaving Stanford with 21 seconds to try to win the
game.
What was designed to be a simple inbounds
play turned into a nightmare for the Cardinal,
however, as Manning came from the backside to
double-team senior guard Marcus Lollie on the
dribble.
Lollie raced around trying to find an outlet
before giving the ball off to forward Brent
Williams, who called a timeout with six seconds to
go in the game.
With six seconds left, it was still possible for
Stanford to get the winning shot off. But as has
been the case all season, the Cardinal ran out of
second chances. Lollie received the inbounds pass
again, but as he turned the corner to drive into
what he later called "a wide-open lane," a Husky
hand swatted Lollie's dribble off his leg, forcing
Lollie to run down the ball just in time to put up
a desperation 3-point attempt as he fell out of
bounds.
The miracle ending, however, was not to be, as
Lollie's attempt rattled out of the hoop with no
time left on the clock.
The Cardinal had opportunity after opportuni-
ty to open up a lead on the
Huskies, but the play of Man
ning and guard Prentiss Perkins
kept Washington in the game
throughout. Stanford, for its
part, shot well throughout the
game, but just couldn't put the
Huskies away.
However, all eyes were on
Lollie with six seconds remain
ing, and as if under the spell of
some freakish deja vu, Stanford
missed an opportunity at a cru
cial shot in the final seconds
because of a ballhandling error
by Lollie.
"I was going to score on the
play, and one of their guys got a
hand on the ball, so I just tried
to get the ball and shoot," Lollie
said. "I got a good look at the

hoop. I thought it was going in."
The heartbreaking loss, how
ever, was easier for Lollie to
swallow than some of Stanford's
recent losses. "I don't feel as bad
about it," Lollie said. "We shot
the ball pretty good, so I feel
good about it — there's been a
lot of improvement."
Some of that improvement
came in the shooting of Dukes,
who finished 4-for-5 with 11
points. Dukes got some of the
touch back on his three-pointer,
as he sank three out of four from
the three-point line. Freshman
Dion Cross, making his first
start for the Cardinal, also con
tributed to the Stanford effort
with 10 points on 4-for-7 shoot
ing.
"We played pretty well for the
entire game," Montgomery said.
"We shot better than we shot all
year, so there are some positives
for us."
