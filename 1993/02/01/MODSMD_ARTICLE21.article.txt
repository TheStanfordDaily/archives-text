In the last 21 seconds of Stanford's game
against Washington Saturday, fans of Cardinal
men's basketball got yet another look at what has
been the story for the team all year â€” missed

go in the game.
With six seconds left, it was still possible for

what he later called "a wide-open lane," a Husky
hand swatted Lollie's dribble off his leg, forcing
Lollie to run down the ball just in time to put up

bounds.
The miracle ending, however, was not to be, as
Lollie's attempt rattled out of the hoop with no
