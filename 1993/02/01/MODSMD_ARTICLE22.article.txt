# Women blow early lead as Huskies complete hoops sweep
## 
### Brian Border Staff Writer 
It's not often that the Stanford
women's basketball squad squanders a
13-point lead.
Saturday night, however, the Cardinal
watched as Washington stormed back
from a 29-16 first-half deficit and con
verted it to a 73-70 victory at Hec
Edmundson Pavilion in Seattle.
In the last eight minutes of the con
test, with the score still close, Stanford
self-destructed on offense, practically
handing the Huskies the win.
The Cardinal missed the front-end of
four consecutive one-and-one free throw
situations and thus ruined the opportu

nity to stretch its slim three-point lead
into a potentially devastating 11-point
one. When Stanford wasn't failing from
the free throw stripe, it was committing
several of its 21 total turnovers.
The boisterous Washington crowd of
6,500 didn't make things any easier for
the visiting Cardinal.
"It's not so much that the crowd both
ers our team," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "It's just that it helps
motivate the other team."
Despite the Cardinal's poor execution
down the stretch, it still found itself in a
position to send the game into overtime,
thanks to the 26-point, 19-rebound per
formance of Ail-American Val Whiting.
With 11 seconds left, three-point special

ist Molly Goodenbour got the ball and
tried to get open to launch one more trey.
However, the buzzer sounded before she
could release the shot.
What made the loss even more frus
trating was the fact that Stanford almost
blew the game wide open near the end of
the opening period.
The Cardinal built a sizeable lead as it
outrebounded its opponent and scored on
second and third opportunities at its own
basket.
A key opportunity arose when Whiting
scored off of a rebound to make the score
29-16, and was also fouled on the play.
Before Whiting attempted the resulting
free throw, Washington head coach Chris
Gobrecht was called for a technical foul,

'We could have been up by
20 or more at halftime. We
shot ourselves in the foot'
â€” Tara VanDerveer
giving the Cardinal three-straight free
throws and possession of the ball follow
ing the foul shots.
Stanford failed to increase its lead
though, missing all three free throws and
not scoring on the ensuing possession.
"We could have been up by 20 or more
at halftime," VanDerveer said. "We shot
ourselves in the foot."

After cutting the score to 41-32 at the
break, the Huskies caught fire in the sec
ond period. Washington opened the half
by outscoring the Cardinal 14-4 as it took
a 46-45 lead, its first since two minutes
into the contest.
From that point on, the two squads
exchanged the lead six more times before
the Huskies pulled away for good.
After such a disappointing loss, Van-
Derveer emphasized that many of the
Stanford players need to improve their
overall performances in the future.
"We need people who can handle
defensive pressure and who can guard
people at the same time," she said. "It's
just a matter of them playing well on
both ends of the court."
