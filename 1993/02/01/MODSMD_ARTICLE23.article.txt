# Cowboys: Super win
## 
### 
PASADENA, Calif. (AP) - It
was quicker than anyone could
imagine.
Three seasons ago, the Dallas
Cowboys were the worst team in
NFL history. Now they're Super
Bowl champions and they did it
with four of the quickest touch
downs ever.
That left the Buffalo Bills as
the first team to lose three
straight Super Bowls and the
NFC's supremacy intact — nine
straight NFL titles, seven in
overwhelming fashion, this time
52-17.
With MVP Troy Aikman
throwing for four touchdowns
and Charles Haley and Ken Nor
ton leading a defense that forced
a record nine turnovers, the
Cowboys, the youngest team in
the NFL, scored two touchdowns
15 seconds apart in the first peri
od of Sunday's Super Bowl and
two more 18 seconds apart in the
second.
That made Buffalo only the
second team ever to make it to
three straight Super Bowls, the
first team ever to lose three
straight.
Two of Aikman's TD passes
went to Michael Irvin and one
each to Jay Novacek and Alvin
Harper as the NFC East won the
Super Bowl for the third straight
year, a record. The three winners
were different — Dallas, Wash
ington and the New York Giants
— but the victim each time was
the Bills.
There was another first —
Jimmy Johnson became the first
coach ever to win both a national
college title and a Super Bowl
