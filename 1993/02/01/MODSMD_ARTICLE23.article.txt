# Cowboys: Super win
## 
### 
PASADENA, Calif. (AP) - It
was quicker than anyone could
imagine.
Three seasons ago, the Dallas
Cowboys were the worst team in
NFL history. Now they're Super
Bowl champions and they did it
with four of the quickest touch
downs ever.
That left the Buffalo Bills as
the first team to lose three
straight Super Bowls and the
NFC's supremacy intact — nine
straight NFL titles, seven in
overwhelming fashion, this time
52-17.
With MVP Troy Aikman
throwing for four touchdowns
and Charles Haley and Ken Nor
ton leading a defense that forced
a record nine turnovers, the
Cowboys, the youngest team in
the NFL, scored two touchdowns
15 seconds apart in the first peri
od of Sunday's Super Bowl and
two more 18 seconds apart in the
second.
That made Buffalo only the
second team ever to make it to
three straight Super Bowls, the
first team ever to lose three
straight.
Two of Aikman's TD passes
went to Michael Irvin and one
each to Jay Novacek and Alvin
Harper as the NFC East won the
Super Bowl for the third straight
year, a record. The three winners
were different — Dallas, Wash
ington and the New York Giants
— but the victim each time was
the Bills.
There was another first —
Jimmy Johnson became the first
coach ever to win both a national
college title and a Super Bowl

series with a 9-5 victory in Moraga yesterday.
just three years after he began his
pro coaching career with a 1-15
record. For Dallas, it was their
third Super Bowl victory, but the
first in 15 years.
The Cowboys won on both sides
of the ball. Emmitt Smith, the
NFL's leading rusher, ran for 108
yards on 22 carries and Aikman
completed 22 of 30 passes for 273
yards without an interception.
After spotting the Bills an early
7-0 lead on a TD set up by a
blocked punt, the Cowboys turned
on the defense.
James Washington's intercep
tion against Jim Kelly set up a 23-
yard TD pass to Novacek. Fifteen
seconds later, Haley knocked the
ball loose from Kelly at the goal
line to defensive tackle Jimmie

Jones, who took two steps into
the end zone for the score that
put the Cowboys ahead for good.
Norton and Vinson Smith
sparked a goal-line stand that
stopped the Bills on three shots
inside the Dallas one-yard-line
the last on an ill-conceived
fourth-down pass from the 6-inch
line. Dallas defensive coordinator
Dave Wannstedt — whose
prowess helped earn him the head
coaching job in Chicago next sea
son — had a nickel defense in on
the play and Thomas Everett
intercepted Kelly's desperation
pass in the end zone.
Everett had a second intercep
tion in the fourth quarter that set
up a 10-yard TD run by Smith.
Then Norton scored — taking in a
fumble from nine yards out after
it bounced into his arms following
a high snap.
It was the last gasp for the
Bills.
