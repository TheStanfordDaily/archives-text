# Baseball blows past Gaels in home-and-home series
## 
### Brian Egan Senior staff writer 
Some things never change.
Only four of the 12 players who
appeared in this weekend's lineups for the
Stanford baseball team started any games
in 1992.
The inexperience mattered little, how
ever, as the Cardinal fell back on its old
trademarks — solid pitching and timely
hitting — and sloppy St. Mary's play to
sweep the Gaels, 14-2 and 9-5.
"This is definitely a younger, more inex
perienced and more enthusiastic team
than last year," said left fielder Nate Olm
stead.
Despite Saturday's 14-2 final score, the
season-opener for both squads was actual
ly a close game for seven innings.
The Cardinal opened scoring in the
third in traditional Stanford fashion,
picking up three runs by virtue of only
one hit. After Jed Hansen walked to lead
off the inning, shortstop Todd Laßocca
ripped a double over the head of St.
Mary's left fielder Chad Stark, scoring
Hansen.
Rod Meyer sacrificed Laßocca to third,
and Jimmy Noriega walked, putting run
ners at the corners with one out. A Norie
ga-Laßocca double steal led to two more
runs, thanks to a throwing error by Gael
shortstop Tim Shaffer.
Doubles by Olmstead and Brian Dal
limore gave Stanford a 6-2 lead after seven
innings.
In the eighth, the Cardinal strung
together five singles, two hit batsmen, two
walks and an error to score eight runs and
put the game out of reach.
Stanford righthander Willie Adams
allowed only five baserunners in his five
innings of work.
"Adams had a pitch limit of 75," said
Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "And I
thought he looked real sharp. He had good
velocity, and a great split on his ball."

Highly-touted freshman Todd Bartles
was effective in his three innings of work
despite giving up the only two St. Mary's
runs of the afternoon.
"It was a good game — almost every
body on the roster got into the game,"
Marquess said. "Even though we didn't
put it away until the eighth."
Yesterday, Marquess employed the sec
ond half of his revolving-door lineup, sub
stituting Cale Carter, Steve Carver and
Brodie VanWagenen for Noriega, Dal
limore and Meyer.
"We'll platoon until we find out who
comes to the surface and plays," the coach
said. "There's real competition in the line
up, especially at the outfield positions."
The weekend series didn't make the
lineup picture any clearer. Noriega led off
and scored two runs on Saturday . . . and
Carter did the same yesterday. Dallimore
had two hits, and Carver had three. Van-
Wagenen made a game-saving catch yes
terday, while Meyer drove the ball well on
Saturday.
"Obviously, we're going to have to keep
playing with the lineup," Marquess said.
In yesterday's game, the Cardinal broke
to an early 8-2 lead thanks to a two-run
home run from Hansen and a two-run
Carver double.
Former Cardinal reliever Andrew Lor
raine picked up the win, going five innings
in his new role as Stanford's No. 2 starting
pitcher.
"It's exciting," Lorraine said. "After I
settled down, I think I got the job done. I'm
pleased."
For Lorraine, a junior, the differences
between this season and last go beyond his
personal role.
"(This year's! team is very interesting,"
the left-hander said. "It's a tighter group
than last year, because there's not so much
of an age difference.
"You can see that some things are dif
ferent, whether or not they show up in the
box score."
