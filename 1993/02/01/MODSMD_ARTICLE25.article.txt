# 'Golden' swimmers celebrate coach's birthday in style
## 
### Kathryn Yang Staff writer 
Richard Quick, head coach of the Stanford
women's swim team, celebrated the weekend
of his 50th birthday in style, as he watched
the Cardinal set nine deGuerre Pool-records
en route to beating UCLA and USC.
Friday, Stanford handily disposed of the
Bruins, 182-117, improving their unblem
ished record against UCLA to 11-0. Begin
ning with the 400-yard medley relay, the
Cardinal shattered deGuerre Pool's seven
year-old record with a time of 3 minutes,
40.76 seconds. Swimming the backstroke leg
of that race, Olympian Lea Loveless clocked
a 54.11 to set the first record of the day.
Then it was Jenny Thompson's turn as
she posted a 49.31 to set a new mark in the
100 freestyle. She was followed by Loveless,
who turned in an all-time best in her special
ty, the 200 back.
The next pool mark came during Summer
Sanders' exhibition. Having had her NCAA
eligibility revoked after she turned profes
sional last year, Sanders swam alone and set
records in the 200 butterfly and 200 individ
ual medley events.
Sanders' time in the 200IM did not stand
for long, though, as former record-holder
Mary Ellen Blanchard reclaimed it half-an
hour later with a 1:59.79 clocking.
"One of the highlights of this weekend was
Mary Ellen stepping up in her events," Quick
said. "She's definitely becoming the big factor
that she needs to be." Last year, Blanchard
swam in the shadow of Sanders, but this year
the sophomore is beginning to fill the holes
left by the Olympian's departure.
Although UCLA was overpowered by the

Cardinal, they left with a consolation prize
by besting the old pool standard in the 200
free relay. The Bruins also captured the 1-
meter and 3-meter diving competitions along
with the 200 fly and 50 free events.
"I think that the UCLA meet was the best
dual meet that any of my teams have ever
had, outside of when we swim Texas," Quick
said. "As far as individual improvements, we
took a step in the right direction."
After UCLA left town, its cross-town
rivals from USC arrived on Saturday, and
Stanford repeated its performance by hand
ing the Trojans a 199-88 loss.
Swimming in more off-events, the Cardi
nal only set three pool standards. Thompson
erased the old 200 free mark while Loveless
tied the 200 back record she had posted 24
hours earlier. The Cardinal then savored its
last record of the weekend as the team of
Mary Edwards, Jorgensen, Lisa Jacob and
Thompson recaptured the 200 free relay
record which UCLA had claimed.
In addition to breaking records, Stanford
also qualified two more swimmers for the
NCAA Championships over the weekend, as
both Jorgensen and sophomore Becky Crowe
qualified in the 200 fly.
In addition to the swimming events, last
year's NCAA champion in the platform and
3-meter springboard diving competitions,
Eileen Richetelli, swept both the 1-meter
and the 3-meter events against the Trojans.
Having completed its homestand, Stan
ford will now head out on the road for the
remainder of its season. Next week the No. 2
Cardinal (4-0, 3-0 Pacific 10 Conference) will
face No. 4 SMU and No. 3 Texas in dual
meets before going north to close the regular
season at California.
