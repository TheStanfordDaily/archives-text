# Spikers meet little resistance, take three matches on road

The Stanford men's volleyball team
spent the weekend taming tigers, salt
ing slugs and accosting Aggies, easily
defeating the University of the Pacific,
UC-Santa Cruz and UC-Davis, respec
tively.
UOP and Santa Cruz fell in straight
games while Davis, a club team, won the
first game of its match before losing the
next three.
Stanford's record now stands at 4-1,
1-0 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration.
Friday night, the Cardinal dominat
ed Pacific. Seniors Dave Goss and Ryan

Moos, who were injured last week, led
Stanford to an easy 15-6, 15-3, 15-2
win. Goss, an Ail-American opposite
hitter, blazed the way with 16 kills and
a .608 hitting percentage, leading a Car
dinal team that hit .526 and held the
Tigers to a mere .180.
Moos received 80 percent of Pacific's
serves and passed them extremely well,
according to Stanford coach Ruben
Nieves. He also added three aces to the
Cardinal's team total of 10.
"Ryan Moos was the key," Nieves
said.
"If you have half as many aces as you
have service errors (of which the Cardi
nal had 11), you've had a good serving
match," Nieves said. "Against UOP, we

served extremely well."
On Saturday, the Cardinal squashed
the Banana Slugs 15-3, 15-5, 15-2. Goss
again led the way with 14 kills, as the
squad hit .623 and held Santa Cruz to a
meager .115. Bob Hillman also had an
impressive match, with 12 kills and a
.786 hitting percentage.
As a team, the Cardinal had more
trouble serving — they chalked up 15
service errors and only four aces — but
played better defense, with nine team
blocks.
Davis gave Stanford a surprise Sat
urday night, roaring to a 15-12 win in
the first game before conceding the next
three 15-13, 15-9, 15-6.
"They were the best of the three

teams we faced over the weekend,"
Nieves said.
The Aggies were led by Brian Grey,
who gave the Cardinal fits at the net all
night. As outside hitters Mike Lambert,
Eric Wells, David Fischer and Hillman
struggled, seniors John Hribar and
John Bezmalinovic stepped up at the
middle blocker position to counter
Grey. The two veterans combined for 27
kills and only two errors.
The weekend's matches were tune
ups for the brunt of the Cardinal's sea
son, which begins in two weeks. Stan
ford continued to look at different start
ing lineups, mixing in Jimmy Blackman
at setter and Mike Lambert at middle
blocker against Santa Cruz, and Wells at

middle blocker and Fisher at opposite
hitter against Davis. According to
Nieves, the starting lineup which faced
UOP— with Canyon Ceman setting,
Moos and Hillman at swing hitter, and
Goss at opposite hitter — will take the
court against USC on Saturday, Feb. 13.
The only questions are at middle
blocker, where Lambert, Brian Garrett,
Bezmalinovic, Hribar and Joe
Burghardt continue to fight for the
starting positions.
"In practice we now want to look at
the UOP and UCSC lineups (with Lam
bert and Burghardt at middle blocker),"
Nieves said. "The best right now is the
UOP lineup, but the UCSC lineup has
potential."
