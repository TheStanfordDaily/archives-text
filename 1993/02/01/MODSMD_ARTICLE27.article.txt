Beat me once, shame on you.
Beat me twice. . .
I must be Cal.
The No. 20 Stanford women's
gymnastics team, fresh off a dual
meet win against the California
Golden Bears last week, defeated
the Bears again — along with the
UC-Santa Barbara Gauchos — in
the Chili's "Red Hot" Invitation
al Friday night.
The Cardinal's team score of
189.925 was by far the squad's
best mark of the year, easily out
distancing the sub-184 scores
posted by the other two schools.
Cal finished second with a
183.975, while UCSB posted a
183.15 for third place.
Stanford had the top two indi
vidual all-around performers in
the meet. Sophomore Jene Elzie
had a meet-high 38.925 and
freshman Hillary Anderson, in
her first all-around competition
at Stanford, scored 38.125.
Finishing third in the all
around was Cal's Sirinda Sin
charoen with a 37.65. Emily
Tripiano led the Gauchos with a
score of 37.45.
Elzie and Anderson also tied

would, but we're

The vault has been problem
atic for Stanford all year, but
on Friday the Cardinal had its
best team score of the year in
the event. Coach Breck Green
wood said the addition of
Anderson to the vaulting lineup
was a big reason for the squad's
success.
Although the team didn't
quite reach the 190-point score
it was looking for, Greenwood
said that he was pleased with the
team's showing.
"Now we're getting our meets

up to our practice level," he said.
Stanford was never in any
danger of losing, leading from
the first performer in the first
event right through to the end.
"During the first two events
it was easy, until the beam,"
Elzie said.

balance beam. Sophomore co
captain Katie Clancy was per
plexed by the team's substan
dard performance in the event.
"The beam should be a strong
event for us. It's time for us to
believe beam is a strong event
for us," she said.
Elzie had a more positive
take: "The beam breaks got us
back and allowed us to refocus
on the floor," she said.
According to Clancy, the floor
is one of Stanford's strongest
events, and the athletes proved
it Friday, scoring a season-high
48.35.
Overall, the Cardinal was
confident that Friday would be a
good meet.
"We were a little more pol
ished for tonight," Greenwood
said.
"We sensed it," Elzie added.
"In training, we've been a lot
more confident."
Clancy said that the Cardinal
had been concentrating more on
its "cues" this week. "'Cues' are
certain things we say to our
selves at important parts in the
routine, and we worked on that a
lot," she said.
Greenwood observed that the
team was finally beginning to
progress the way he expected.
"We're getting closer," he
said. "We started slower than I
thought we would, but we're
improving."
In two weeks, the Cardinal
will get a chance to find out how
much they have improved. On
Feb. 12, Stanford will host Cal
State-Fullerton, which defeated
the Cardinal in its first meet of
the season last month.
