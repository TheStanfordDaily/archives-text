# Netters taken to limit by tough Torero team

### Amy Wusterbarth Senior staff writer 
In its home-court debut, the
Cardinal men's tennis team
notched a well-earned 5-3 victo
ry over the Toreros of San Diego
Saturday. Using a new match
format (shorter, eight-game
doubles matches played before
the singles) proved to be exciting
for the audience, but a bit
uncomfortable for some of the
players.
The new format provided a
challenge for the Stanford men.
Because points are played out
much more quickly in doubles
than in singles, the players need
to be ready to go as soon as they
step onto the court. In addition,
the pro-set format used speeds
up the matches.
"We worked in practice on
staying back and getting good
shots," explained junior Chris
Cocotos. "You have to start real
ly quickly (with this format)."
Teammate Roman Sydorak
agreed, "If the guy has a good
serve and you just hit an OK
return, he'll nail a volley and the
point's over.
"You need to warm up more.
You don't have the first few
games to get into [the match]
like you do in singles. It's like a
midterm," he continued.
"With a few multiple choice
questions, you're reminded of a
few things and you get into it
before the big essay question.
But if its just three big essay
questions. . .
Sydorak's performance at
first doubles with teammate
Robert Devens reflected these
sentiments. They lost, 7-9, to
Kevin Bradley and Ignacio Mar
tinez.
Devens also felt the effects of
the new format. "If you get
down a break early in the set its
tough to get it back," he said.
The second and third doubles
teams fared better, clinching the
first team point for the Cardinal.
Junior Vimal Patel paired up
with freshman Jim Thomas to
defeat Fredrik Axsater and
Mark Huarte, 8-3, in the second
slot.
Meanwhile, Cocotos and
freshman Jeff Salzenstein hand
ily defeated Darren Potkey and
Emmanuel Udozorh, 8-2. How
ever, Cocotos was not thrilled
about playing an hour of doubles
before his tough No. 1 singles
match. "I'd rather battle first

(and then play doubles)," he
said.
When he finally did "battle,"
his singles match proved to be
worth the wait. Cocotos held the
fans in suspense with a grueling
three-setter against Bradley.
After trading sets, Cocotos held
serve in the third to go up 5-4,
but then Bradley came back to
win three-straight games for the
victory, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5.
"I was up in most of the
games but he does better when
he's down," Cocotos explained.
"He had big shots on big points."
Head coach Dick Gould was
pleased with Cocotos' perfor
mance. "He played a fine match
throughout and really exploited
his opponent's weaknesses but
(Bradley] just stayed in the
match with him."
San Diego also snagged a vic
tory at second singles. Axsater
put away Patel, 6-3, 6-2. "It
didn't look like there was any
plan involved â€” [Patel] was just
hitting tennis balls," Gould said.
"That's much different than
playing with a strategy."
Devens nailed a solid third
singles win to make up for his
doubles loss. Defeating Mar
tinez, one of his two doubles
opponents, 6-3, 6-2 was satisfy
ing for the Stanford junior.
"He's the same guy I played
last year," he said. "He hit
shorter than usual,, so I came in
a lot, and he missed some pass
ing shots."
Sydorak also made up for his
doubles loss by defeating his
fourth spot singles opponent,
Udozorh, 7-5, 6-1. In the fifth
slot, Thomas made an impres
sive effort but came out on the
short end of a long 3-6, 6-3, 3-6
match against J.J. Shobar.
Ricky Becker, also a Stanford
freshman, routed Olle Pierron,
6-4, 6-3 at sixth singles.
The match held no real sur
prises for Gould. "It was as close
a match as I thought it would
be," he said. "They have good
experience down the line. And I
think the new format was really
exciting. In the long run it will
be good but (for the players) it
takes some getting used to."
Cardinal notes
Junior Michael Flanagan lost his
first round qualifying match in the
Volvo Tournament in San Francisco
on Saturday afternoon. He was
defeated by California graduate Ted
Scherman, 6-7, 7-5, 6-7.
