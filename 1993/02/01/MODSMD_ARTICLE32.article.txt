## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
While other Stanford teams were strug
gling over the weekend, it was business as
usual for the Stanford women's tennis
team, which opened its regular-season
schedule in convincing fashion with a 9-0
win over visiting Washington.
"We were pretty happy," Stanford assis
tant coach Lele Forood said. "It's always
tough going into the first match — the new
players are always anxious to get it over with,
so there was a lot of anticipation there."
Washington, a team better known for
its indoor play, found itself overwhelmed
by the Cardinal on the open-air courts of
Stanford Tennis Stadium. Stanford (1-0,
1-0 Pacific 10 Conference) won every
match in straight sets, with the exception
of the #3 doubles contest between Stan
ford's Wendy Sacks and Sonya Cotero
and Washington's Loan Phan and Becky
Clayton. Sacks and Cotero took three
sets to down Phan and Clayton, 6-4, 2-6,
6-3.
"We let down a little bit, but in all we
played a good match," Sacks said. "After
the second game we got our heads and
games back in it."
Stanford delivered a one-two punch in
the first two singles matches, with dominat
ing performances from junior Laxmi Poruri
and senior Heather Willens. In the No. 1
singles match, Poruri made short work of
Washington's Lisa Proctor, 6-0, 6-1, while
No. 2 Willens also defeated her Husky rival,
Paige Stringer, by a 6-0, 6-1 score.
"Heather and Laxmi were just rolling,"
Forood said. "They played extremely well
— we were pleased with their perfor
mances."
After struggling in the early going
against Washington's Kim Frost, No. 3
Kristine Kurth ran off seven straight

games to take her match, 7-5, 6-0. In the
No. 4 spot, it was freshman Beth Berris
winning her first regular-season match at
Stanford over Washington's April Apel, 6-
0, 6-1. Berris continues to roll after picking
up a singles title in flight two of the Pac-10
Indoor Championships last weekend.
"This was her first dual match and she
played very well," Forood said. "She's a
very focused player on the court — she
doesn't waste time."
In the No. 5 match, sophomore Amy
Chiminello posted a 6-2, 6-2 win over the
Huskies' Phan. "I was really excited at first,
but she got a lot of balls back and broke my
serve in the second," Chiminello said.
"After that, she picked up her game a little
bit, so I just looked to win my serve back."
Freshman Wendy Sacks rounded out
the singles sweep with a 6-0, 6-3 win over
Washington's Michelle Thomas. "I was
happy with the win, but my game wasn't
all there," Sacks said. "I need to practice a
lot more to get it there."
In the doubles matches, the No. 1 team
of Poruri and Willens teamed up to destroy
Washington's Frost and Proctor, 6-0, 6-1,
while No. 2 Berris and Kurth defeated
Stringer and Apel, 6-3, 6-1.
In all, the Cardinal's strong showing
against the Huskies bodes well for the rest
of its season, according to Forood. "It was
great to have everyone play and everyone
do well," she said. "We were pleased with
everyone's play — we have high expecta
tions and there certainly wasn't anything
that didn't meet them."
Stanford will host Fresno State in its
next scheduled dual match tomorrow at
1:30 p.m at Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Cardinal Notes:
Stanford's Kim Shasby did not play in this
weekend's matches, and will return this week to
the No. 3 spot. Kurth will then move to No. 4,
Berris to No. 5 and Chiminello to No. 6.
