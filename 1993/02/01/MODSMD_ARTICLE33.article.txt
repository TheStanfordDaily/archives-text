### Sam Wu Staff writer 
While most people consider a trip
to Hawaii or the French Alps to be a
vacation, Stanford wrestling coach
Chris Horpel decided to occupy his
team's free weekend by . . . entering
the Country Classic Open in Bakers
field?
Two of the Cardinal's first-string
grapplers competed in the tourna
ment, along with nine backups who

needed more experience.
Stanford's seven other regulars,
however, opted not to tumble with
the Olympic hopefuls, assistant
coaches and collegiate athletes who
made the 'fun-filled' outing Satur
day.
However, those who rested may
wonder how they would have per
formed. Despite the quality of the
opposition, five Cardinal wrestlers
placed in their weight divisions.
Starting redshirt freshman Jimmy

Aguirre, who entered the open boast
ing a 7-3 overall record and a perfect
7-0 dual meet standing, captured first
place in the 134-pound category.
He won the championship by for
feit over fellow Cardinal junior Jay
Jackson.
Stanford completed its dominance
of the 134-pound bracket as redshirt
freshman Ed Madina also advanced to
the semifinals, falling short of the
final by losing to Jackson.
Another young grappler, 150-

pound freshman Jack Artman, also
progressed to the semifinals. Though
he lost the match, Artman still
secured a sixth-place finish for him
self.
Still another redshirt, 126-pound
Matt Cano, reached the semis, wind
ing up with a sixth place finish.
Cano lost his semifinal to former
All-American Chris Bolin, who is now
a member of the Sunkist Kids
Wrestling Club, an organization
whose members are battling to make

the 1996 Olympic team roster.
"They surprised me a little," Hor
pel said in reference to the three
freshman standouts.
In all, the Country Classic benefit
ed the Cardinal in various ways.
Wrestlers who competed performed
well and gained a great deal of experi
ence, while others received much
needed time to nurse injuries or just
rest up for next weekend's final two
dual meets against Oregon and Fres
no State.
