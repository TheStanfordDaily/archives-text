# Investigation into alleged Alpha Sig hazing completed
## 
### Matthew Gregory 
The Office of Student Activities
has recently completed an investi
gation into allegations that re
turning residents of the Alpha
Sigma house hazed new house
mates earlier this year.
According to Assoc. Director of
Residential Education Diana Con
klin, who headed the inquiry, the
infractions occurred during the
house's two-week initiation in Oc
tober. She expects to take discipli
nary action, if needed, within
three to four weeks.
Conklin declined to describe
the case in detail, explaining that
she "is still in consultation with
Fraternal Affairs" regarding the
incident. Alpha Sig, an unofficial
coed fraternity, is a self-operative
house in Cowell Cluster.
An Alpha Sig resident, speak
ing on condition of anonymity,
said the investigation examined
several incidents, including the
fact that "people who are not ac
tive are called 'shitties'. . . that's
one of the bad things we've done."
The resident also said that
"shitties" were required to stand
on a table and tell a joke at dinner
during the month before initia
tion. In addition, the resident said,
"shitties" were asked to sit as a
group for a "shittie picture," at
which time already-initiated
Alpha Sigs dumped water on
them.
Finally, the resident said
pledges were "interrogated," dur
ing which they were asked ques
tions such as if they drank or had a
car. They were also asked to per

form tasks such as picking up a
crab or dipping their hands in Jell-
O. According to the resident, this
was done to discover whether to
offer the pledge beer, and how
willing the pledge was to partici
pate in initiation events.
Kirstin Henninger, a sopho
more Alpha Sig resident, said she
thought the investigation also
looked at alcohol use at the
house's yearly initiation.
"There's a lot of different activ
ities, and a lot of them involve
drinking, and they're probably in
vestigating if there's a lot of pres
sure" to drink, she said.
But second-year Alpha Sig resi
dent Sarah Berkelhamer said that
while alcohol is available at initia
tion events, drinking "is never a
thing you 're made to do."
The University hazing policy
defines hazing as "any method of
initiation. . . which causes. . . bod
ily danger, physical harm, or per
sonal degradation or disgrace re
sulting in physical or mental
harm."
Examples of hazing listed in the
University Greek Guide include
"squirting pledge members with
hoses or fire extinguishers," "forc
ing or requiring pledge members
to ingest any liquid" and "grilling
individuals or groups of pledged
members with questions of any
kind."
Conklin stressed that the haz
ing which occurred differs from
popular perception: "A lot of times
when people think of hazing they
think of stuff they've seen in the
