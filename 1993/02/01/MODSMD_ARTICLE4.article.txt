# Investigation into alleged Alpha Sig hazing completed
## 
### Matthew Gregory 
The Office of Student Activities
has recently completed an investi
gation into allegations that re
turning residents of the Alpha
Sigma house hazed new house
mates earlier this year.
According to Assoc. Director of
Residential Education Diana Con
klin, who headed the inquiry, the
infractions occurred during the
house's two-week initiation in Oc
tober. She expects to take discipli
nary action, if needed, within
three to four weeks.
Conklin declined to describe
the case in detail, explaining that
she "is still in consultation with
Fraternal Affairs" regarding the
incident. Alpha Sig, an unofficial
coed fraternity, is a self-operative
house in Cowell Cluster.
An Alpha Sig resident, speak
ing on condition of anonymity,
said the investigation examined
several incidents, including the
fact that "people who are not ac
tive are called 'shitties'. . . that's
one of the bad things we've done."
The resident also said that
"shitties" were required to stand
on a table and tell a joke at dinner
during the month before initia
tion. In addition, the resident said,
"shitties" were asked to sit as a
group for a "shittie picture," at
which time already-initiated
Alpha Sigs dumped water on
them.
Finally, the resident said
pledges were "interrogated," dur
ing which they were asked ques
tions such as if they drank or had a
car. They were also asked to per

form tasks such as picking up a
crab or dipping their hands in Jell-
O. According to the resident, this
was done to discover whether to
offer the pledge beer, and how
willing the pledge was to partici
pate in initiation events.
Kirstin Henninger, a sopho
more Alpha Sig resident, said she
thought the investigation also
looked at alcohol use at the
house's yearly initiation.
"There's a lot of different activ
ities, and a lot of them involve
drinking, and they're probably in
vestigating if there's a lot of pres
sure" to drink, she said.
But second-year Alpha Sig resi
dent Sarah Berkelhamer said that
while alcohol is available at initia
tion events, drinking "is never a
thing you 're made to do."
The University hazing policy
defines hazing as "any method of
initiation. . . which causes. . . bod
ily danger, physical harm, or per
sonal degradation or disgrace re
sulting in physical or mental
harm."
Examples of hazing listed in the
University Greek Guide include
"squirting pledge members with
hoses or fire extinguishers," "forc
ing or requiring pledge members
to ingest any liquid" and "grilling
individuals or groups of pledged
members with questions of any
kind."
Conklin stressed that the haz
ing which occurred differs from
popular perception: "A lot of times
when people think of hazing they
think of stuff they've seen in the
movies, really extreme examples.
This was subtler than that."
Senior Blake Masters, Alpha
Sig's residential assistant, added
that "the alleged hazing was the
type of thing that somebody felt
was happening throughout the
initiation. It wasn't just a single
moment."
There was "nobody with sheep
or paddles or anything" involved
in initiation, said junior Dirk
Pranke, an Alpha Sig resident.
According Masters, the investi
gation began when four com
plaints were filed with the Office

of Student Activities. "I don't
know who they are because they
did it in anonymity to the Row
Office, and I really don't want to
know,"he said.
"I think the important thing is
that since some people had bad
reactions, there could be some
other people out there who didn't
say anything," he said. "For the
house, we felt it was very impor
tant not to turn this into a witch
hunt but instead use it construc
tively."
Berkelhamer, too, said she was
concerned that people felt the
need to complain. "The fact that
people thought they were hazed
really disturbs me," she said.
She said the complaints might
have stemmed from the fact that

some people living at Alpha Sig
this year were unfamiliar with the
house's initiation procedures and
reputation.
Alpha Sig has "been this house
that has traditionally gone really
well in the draw. . . that's
because it was known for being
this fun house where there's a
real sense of community," she
said. But last year, Berkelhamer
continued, Alpha Sig went for
about 3700 in the house draw "so
we had people here who didn't
want to be here."
Masters agreed. "According to
[Conklin's] report, several people
drew into the house this year who
didn't know a lot about it. Alpha
Sig is a very social place, it can be
a very loud place, and somebody

who's expecting to come into a
quiet, 'study dorm' could be very
uncomfortable. There was noth
ing that happened that I think
was intentional but I think some
things were misread because peo
ple had different expectations."
According to Masters, the initi
ation activities date back to when
Alpha Sig was a chartered frater
nity. "We try to carry on every
year many of the same traditions
that were vestiges of the fraterni
ty days, not only because they
were a lot of fun, but also because
they helped bring the house
together and create a bonding
experience."
