### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Mar
shall was remembered Friday by five Law School pro
fessors as "a man who really marched to his own
drummer both before and after becoming a member
of the court."
The professors — three of whom had clerked for
him — shared their thoughts and experiences about
the High Court's first black justice and detailed the
impact he had on the country's histoiy.
Marshall, who died last week at age 84, was de
scribed as the kind of man who would tell stories to
his clerks, tease President Nixon and joke around in
the Supreme Court building.
But the panelists agreed that Marshall's greatest
contribution to American law was his vocal advocacy
of equal rights.
"No one else in the history of this country has con
tributed more to constitutional law before he went on
the bench," said Law Prof. Thomas Grey, who
clerked for Marshall in 1969 and 1970.
As the NAACP's chief lawyer in the Brown v.
Board of Education case, Marshall was remembered
for his winning the case that ended racial segregation
in public schools.
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther, who clerked for Chief
Justice Earl Warren at the time, said "Thurgood
Marshall gave one of the greatest oral arguments I've
ever heard" in the Brown case. "No one came close to
him in terms of dignity and seriousness of purpose."
"I think of a time when [racial equality] really
could have gone either way," said Law Prof. William
Gould. "We read of events in South Africa in 1948
