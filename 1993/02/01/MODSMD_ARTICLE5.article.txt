### Cathy Siciliano Staff writer 
Former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Mar
shall was remembered Friday by five Law School pro
fessors as "a man who really marched to his own
drummer both before and after becoming a member
of the court."
The professors — three of whom had clerked for
him — shared their thoughts and experiences about
the High Court's first black justice and detailed the
impact he had on the country's histoiy.
Marshall, who died last week at age 84, was de
scribed as the kind of man who would tell stories to
his clerks, tease President Nixon and joke around in
the Supreme Court building.
But the panelists agreed that Marshall's greatest
contribution to American law was his vocal advocacy
of equal rights.
"No one else in the history of this country has con
tributed more to constitutional law before he went on
the bench," said Law Prof. Thomas Grey, who
clerked for Marshall in 1969 and 1970.
As the NAACP's chief lawyer in the Brown v.
Board of Education case, Marshall was remembered
for his winning the case that ended racial segregation
in public schools.
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther, who clerked for Chief
Justice Earl Warren at the time, said "Thurgood
Marshall gave one of the greatest oral arguments I've
ever heard" in the Brown case. "No one came close to
him in terms of dignity and seriousness of purpose."
"I think of a time when [racial equality] really
could have gone either way," said Law Prof. William
Gould. "We read of events in South Africa in 1948

and things could have gone that
way in this country.. . It was all
really very much up for grabs.
"Justice Marshall's most sig
nificant work was to lay the
groundwork for what followed
after Brown," he added.
Marshall's legacy, the profes
sors said, are seen in the opinions
he wrote while serving on the
Supreme Court, even when he

was dissenting from the majority.
According to Gunther, "Dissents
are written for the future and
some will become the law of the
land."
In addition to Marshall's public
contributions, the panelists
remembered his personal side,
especially his talent for storytelling.
"It never occurred to me to write
[the storiesj down" when I clerked
for Marshall, said Grey. "He was
too funny, informal, crotchety,
quirky and unpretentious for me to
think of that at the time."
But now, Grey added, "I know

if I spliced [the stories] together,
they would provide a kaleidoscop
ic account of his life."
One of the more humorous sto
ries told of a time when Justice
Marshall was hospitalized for an
illness. President Nixon wanted
to appoint another justice to the
high court in Marshall's place, so
Nixon sent a messenger to the
hospital to see if Marshall had
died.oMarshall wrote a note back
to the president saying "Not yet."
This type of light-hearted
response is indicative of what Jus
tice Marshall was like. "He really

kept in mind the individuals. He
saw the human being in all cases,"
said Assoc. Law Prof. Janet
Alexander, who clerked for him
from 1979 to 1980.
And even though Marshall has
passed away, Gould said his influ
ence continues.
"I believe he, more than any
other individual, inspired me to
go into the law, and dare I say,
whether they know it or not, Jus
tice Marshall is an inspiration for
black law students [today], . . .
and those committed to equality
throughout our land."
