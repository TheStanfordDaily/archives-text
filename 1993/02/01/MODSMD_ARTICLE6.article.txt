# Pop culture gaining legitimacy as supplement to course material
## 
### Solveig Pederson Staff writer 
Watching a Sean Connery film to un
derstand the complexity of medieval leg
ends may seem a bit unorthodox. But pop
ular film and media, traditionally exam
ined only in film and communications
classes, are now gaining acceptance as a
way of enhancing traditional course mate
rial in colleges around the country.
For instance, English Prof. Seth
Lerer's Arthurian literature class watch
es movies such as "Monty Python and the
Holy Grail," "The Sword of the Valiant"
and "Excalibur'' in addition to assigned
reading; the Europe and the Americas

CIV track watches "Bladerunner"; and
Anahid Kassabian's freshman English
classes watch "Oprah" and "Nightline" in
an effort to understand racism.
"In my class, we watch movies to show
how Arthurian legends still have the
power to define national identity, gender
roles and concerns of society for us today,"
said Lerer. "As modern versions of the
Arthurian stories, movies are important
to study so that we can illustrate how the
movies have changed and adapted histori
cal material."
Opinions differ about the study of pop
culture: Is it an art, or does it even have to
be an art?
"Pop culture studies has its place, if one

wants to study what's happening now from
sociological and critical perspectives, but I
think that there is a difference, not neces
sarily a sharp one, between art and pop cul
ture," said English Prof. Marjorie Perloff.
"You can't ignore pop culture, but why
study what you know already, what you
see on the news or read in the papers?" she
asked, adding however, that the study of
pop culture is acceptable as long as it does
not eclipse the study of literature itself.
English Prof. Joss Marsh agreed. "Pop
culture should be studied along with
something else, or it gets sterile," she said.
"We should be experiencing and living in
our culture rather than studying it.
"But studies of pop media are useful to

understand our culture, even if they don't
qualify aesthetically as art," she added.
"Some pop movies or art do turn out to be ar
tistically or at least culturally interesting."
Communications Prof. Henry Bre
itrose emphasized the importance of ex
amining pop art in an effort to understand
society. "I think that it is important to
study the culture we live in. We study in a
culture by lookingat its artifacts," he said.
"Some of our culture's artifacts are in
mass media."
David Schmid, a graduate student in
the Modern Thought and Literature de
partment, is writing a thesis on modern
day serial killers. He also taught a fresh
man English class that examined gangs,

rapes and crime by watchingcurrent films.
"Students were surprised to be watch
ing 'Deathwish' and 'Colors' and listening
to rap when their friends in other frosh
English classes were reading more tradi
tional texts," commented Schmid.
At Harvard, students in a class called
"Women and Popular Culture" watch
Madonna videos such "Like a Virgin" to
understand female identity.
Is this type of class in Stanford's fu
ture?
"I think that someday academic disci
plines will change and become less rigid,"
said Schmid. "There will be a democrati
zation of what can be studied in the uni
versity."
