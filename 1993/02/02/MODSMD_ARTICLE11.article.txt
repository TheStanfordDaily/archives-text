## 
### Michael Slemmer Staff writer 
The "Naked Guy" may have
been kicked out of Berkeley, but
Stanford is welcoming him with
open arms.
Former UC-Berkeley student
Andrew Martinez will be part of
Branner Hall's annual "Two
Weeks of Fun and Contention," a
series of speeches and presenta
tions that will also include the
creator of Crystal Pepsi and a yo
yo expert.
Martinez will speak tonight at
6:30 in the Branner lounge. When
asked how he was induced to come
and speak at the dorm, A.R.
Jones, a resident assistant and the
program's coordinator, said, "We
never reveal our clever tactics, but
we get people however we can."
"I don't even know if Martinez
will be naked for his speech at
Branner," he continued. "I didn't
ask. I'll find out when I pick him
up."

Branner tries to bring guests
that people will want to see, Jones
added. The shows, which are co
sponsored by the dorm and the
Office of Residential Education,
are open to all University stu
dents.
On Friday three people from
Industrial Light and Magic, the
company that created special
effects for "Terminator 2" and
"Star Wars," will give a presenta
tion in the Branner dining hall at
7 p.m.
Next week, Russell Leonard,
the creator of Crystal Pepsi, will
speak to the dorm on Wednesday,
and yo-yo expert Dr. Yo will come
Friday, he added.
On Monday, Branner Presents
will feature Stuart Cheshire, the
man who created the computer
tank game 8010, Jones said.
"Two weeks of fun and con
tention" were kicked off last night
with a presentation on sword- and
fist-fighting by Richard Lane and
Kit Wilder.
