1,000 die in Zaire fighting
KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) â€” Foreigners and
Zaireans packed riverboats and roads yesterday
to flee fighting between mutinous soldiers and
forces loyal to President Mobutu Sese Seko
which has reportedly claimed 1,000 lives.
Mobutu's troops sealed off central Kinshasa
and barred access to opposition party
strongholds after putting down a weekend
rebellion by regular army troops who refused to
accept new 5-million Zaire notes.
The violence has spiraled into a power strug
gle between troops loyal to Mobutu and those
supporting Zaire's democracy movement.
Jean Joseph Mukendi, spokesman for Prime
Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, told The Associ
ated Press: "The estimates that we have allow
us to confirm there were at least 1,000 dead.
They were mostly soldiers."
U.N. to take over in Somalia
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Secretary of
State Warren Christopher said he and U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
agreed yesterday it was time a United Nations
force replaced the American troops in Somalia.
"We believe it's time to begin the transi
tion," said Christopher.
The United States has been pressing
Boutros Ghali to speed up efforts for an inter
national force to replace the U.S. troops who
went to Somalia in December to assist human
itarian relief efforts.
Relief organizations had appealed for assis
tance after local warlords and gangs prevented
food from reaching the starving population.
Christopher said the United States would be
"fully participating" in the transition to a Unit
ed Nations force. "We are thinking very alike
on the subject," he said of his meeting with
Boutros-Ghali.
