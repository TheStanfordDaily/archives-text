# Israel to let Palestinian deportees return
## 'Collision course' with Security Council likely avoided; PLO rejects compromise 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel will
allow 100 deported Palestinians to
immediately return from Lebanon and
will repatriate the nearly 300 other
exiles within a year, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin said yesterday in a deal
designed to avert possible U.N. pun
ishment.
The United Nations had demanded
the exiles' immediate return, and
Israel's refusal endangered the
resumption of Middle East peace talks.
Israel's environment minister pre
dicted the compromise, unanimously
approved by the Cabinet yesterday,
would end Israel's "collision course"
with the Security Council and halt
moves to impose sanctions.
But the Palestine Liberation Orga
nization quickly rejected Israel's
move.
Yasser Abed-Rabbo, a PLO execu

tive committee member, said from
Tunisia that it was an attempt to cir
cumvent the U.N. resolution demand
ing the return of the deportees to their
homes.
Rabin said the arrangement was
worked out in discussions with the
United States, and the Clinton admin
istration promised to shield Israel
from international sanctions and work
to renew the Middle East peace pro
cess.
"It is a package deal," he told a
news conference. He added it would
apply whether or not the deported
Palestinians — who have been living
in a makeshift camp in southern
Lebanon — accepted Israel's offer.
Rabin said Israel would help inter
national groups get humanitarian aid
to the deportees "by helicopter, not by
land."

Details of the plan were not imme
diately known, including how the 100
deportees to be return will be selected.
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid
called the deal "a compromise that is
very helpful to Israel."
"We are getting full backing from
the Americans," Sarid said. "We are
eliminating our collision course with
the Security Council. There is no
longer any fear of sanctions by the
Security Council."
The compromise was intended to
prevent U.N. steps to enforce a resolu
tion demanding the deportees' return.
Arab nations in particular have been
furious at what they consider a double
standard in the way U.N. resolutions
pertaining to Iraq and Israel have been
enforced.
The compromise would make it eas
ier for the United States to block a

U.N. Security Council resolution on
enforcing the resolution.
No action was expected in the full
Security Council until later in the
week, at the earliest.
Secretary of State Warren Christo
pher said in New York the United
States and Israel have been engaged in
"some very extensive consultations"
on the deportations in recent days.
"Both President Clinton and I feel
that these discussions have been posi
tive and productive, and we are quite
optimistic that they will open the way
to a resolution of this issue and enable
us to put the issue behind us," he said.
Israel deported 413 Palestinians
from the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip to Lebanon on Dec. 17,
accusing them of being ringleaders in
radical Muslim groups blamed for the
killing of six Israeli soldiers.
