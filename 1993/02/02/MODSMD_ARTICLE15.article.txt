# Clinton threatens tough trade stance with EC
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Clinton administra
tion took a tough bargaining stance in its first major
trade dispute by announcing yesterday that next
month the federal government may stop purchasing
a wide range of products made in Europe.
The halt would take effect March 22 unless a
compromise is reached before then.
The administration's announcement immediate
ly was branded "unilateral bullying" by one Euro
pean official who urged negotiations to avert a trade
war between the United States and Europe.
The United States is demanding that Europe
abandon rules that favor European manufacturers
at the expense of foreign companies in sales to gov
ernment-run utilities.

U.S. companies like General Electric and the
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. have com
plained the European rules cost them sales.
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said
that the new administration would stop purchasing
European products in the areas of telecommunica
tions, water, energy and transportation unless there
is a settlement by March 22.
Otherwise, "the United States will act and will act
firmly," Kantor said.
He also called for public comments by March 5 on
a proposal to widen the retaliation against European
products beyond federal government purchases.
"We stand ready to conclude an agreement, but
we will not hesitate to enforce our right to be treat-

Ed fairly," Kantor said in a statement.
European officials labelled yesterday's move as
ill-advised and charged that the administration was
ignoring the many "Buy-American" provisions in
U.S. law, especially at the state and local level.
"I cannot believe it is in anybody's interests,
European or American, to attempt to deal with trade
issues in this way," said Leon Brittan, the European
Community's top trade negotiator.
"We do not accept this form of unilateral bully
ing," Brittan said in a statement issued in Brussels.
He said he would bring the matter up when he
meets Kantor in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 11 and
hoped the issue could be resolved when lower-level
negotiators meet on the subject.
