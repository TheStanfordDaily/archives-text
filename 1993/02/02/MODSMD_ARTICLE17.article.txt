Friday's Huyck circus
unified and degraded
Stanford student body

THIS YEAR'S BIG GAME
rally easily could've attracted
more of a crowd ... if only the
drum major had shaved his butt.
Yes, the Stanford student body
has managed to sink to new lows, as
hundreds flocked to White Plaza to
see The Daily's own ex-columnist,
Pete Huyck, in action.
Week after week, students whiz
by Andean musicians, Chinese
dancers, a capella groups and polit
ical forums to make it to the front
of the Food Service lunch line, or
beat the crowds at the Post Office.
But not last Friday.
Last Friday, apathy was thrown
aside. No more aloof avoidance of
campus activities. No shirking
away from non-mandatory time
expenditures. Last Friday, the
lunch line would wait.
And for what? A CIV debate in
Kresge? A gay member of the mili
tary who was reinstated? Gerhard
Casper's inauguration? Not.
This is the Simpsons generation.
Ren and Stimpy, yes. Non-Western
reading, no. We have the attention
spans of small amphibians, living a
Chicken McNugget existence of
instant gratification, low effort and
pre-packaged amusement. Sigh.
We poured out to White Plaza to
see the alleged showdown. The let
ters were fake, the crowd whis
pered. The people on stage arguing
were fake, the crowd suggested. It
was all fake, we considered.
Or maybe it was all real, and one
man's work had finally triggered a
response he couldn't control.
Maybe someone would beat him
up.
Maybe the editors of G-Spot
would actually get to respond to his
words. Maybe it would be an intel
lectual forum for the discussion of
the crowd's feelings.
S-u-u-u-u-r-e.

We laughed as Huyck was driven
in the back of a car around The
Claw. We smiled as he took the
stage, weathering all the speakers'
abuse with calm understanding.
And even more repulsively, we
bonded. Each of us felt the common
ground between ourselves and our
neighbors. We were all there, a uni
fied mass. We all knew how stupid it
was. And we liked it.
It was part of that mentality that
keeps students away from Branner
Presents until the Yo-Yo Guy shows
up. We take our class time seriously,
and our play time even more so.
Stanford has hundreds of events
reflective of its standing as one of
the nation's top universities. We
have speakers, artists, sporting
events. We have a world-class repu
tation for excellence, and activities
on campus demonstrate this fact.
Except when crowd participation
or general attendance is involved.
What is it that keeps so many stu
dents from capitalizing on the
opportunities at Stanford? Apathy,
rearing its ugly head.
How depressing is it that Fri
day's turnout seemed to equal that
of the rally protesting the Rodney
King trial verdict, or the gathering
in support of the arts at Stanford?
Those events featured speakers,
singers, actors. . . above all, impor
tant messages worthy of attention.
Friday's spectacle featured two
men in curly-haired wigs with cans
of shaving cream.
But we watched, with the mor
bidity of a viewer of "Greatest
Home Videos." Stanford's intellec
tually challenging atmosphere has
so much to offer, yet students were
reduced to brainless spectators of a
worthless act of ego-stroking.
It seems that if only some of the
energy put into shouting down the
speakers denouncing Huyck could
have been focused for a meaningful
purpose — a cause, a debate, a
political demonstration, even an
insightful discussion — at least
something positive might have
come out the confrontation.
Instead, we sit pondering the
pain of razor burn aftermath.
