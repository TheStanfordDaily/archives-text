## If only it had a theme song 
### 
SADDAM WHO? After achieving a
level of fame only Rodney King and
Joey Buttafuoco have known in our
recent past, Hussein and his U.N. dis
obeyin' army have become fallen stars in
the United States — simply unable to excite
us the way they did during Desert Storm.
But Desert Storm didn't last long. Just
as quickly as it was thrust upon us — com
plete with a Hank Williams Jr. theme song
— it was gone. Sure, gas-station atten
dants still wear "These Colors Don't Run"
T-shirts even today, but that's about the
only thing keeping it on our minds. There
have been a few ugly news articles about
rapes in U.S. Army tents. Surprisingly few
commemorative coins. That's about it.
The whole post-Desert Storm saga has
received about as much attention in the
past two years as multicultural issues have
in the Sigma Chi house.
And despite the fact that the United
States recently launched 40 cruise missiles
at a Baghdad industrial park, Americans
refuse to renew their interest in our ongo
ing conflict with Iraq.
"Seen that, done that," the nation
replies to news of Tomahawk missiles and
civilian casualties. "Don't bother us,"
America says, "Fleetwood Mac is reuniting
for the inauguration."
Of course, it's no surprise that the
recent attacks would draw much less
attention — not to mention bumper stick
ers — than the all-out war of two Januar

ies past.
I can't help feeling strange, though,
about how the current situation is being
overlooked. The use of U.S. military force
should always be cause for concern, not
just when we have a cute, pudgy general
telling us about it. And our current attacks
may well be more morally questionable —
albeit on a smaller scale — than those of
two years ago.
Why, you might ask, did the Bush
administration choose to initiate military
attacks against Iraq when they did? Could
it be — as one of those important-looking
white males on the "MacNeil-Lehrer News
Hour" suggested — an attempt to tie the
hands of the Clinton administration? And
if so, isn't that immoral, as well?
The questions we could ask about our
recent actions are innumerable, yet
nobody's asking them. Not like they did
two years ago, anyway.
Two years ago — perhaps over-anxious
to play 19605-ish liberals protesting a Viet
nam-ish unjust war — Stanford had teach
ins, candlelight vigils and even our very
own conscientious objector. This time,
we've got nothing.
Despite the fact that there's no war this
time, you'd still think people would be talk
ing about the recent events in Iraq more
than Hillary Clinton's inauguration outfit.
But you'd be wrong.
You'd also think people would be angry
over the fact that part of a U.S. cruise mis

sile landed in a Baghdad hotel. But no,
there's been little reaction, if any.
There have been no speeches on cam
pus. I haven't even heard intellectual dis
cussions involving the words "petroleum
interests," "world capitalist system," or
even "the nose on that Hussein guy."
We're tired of talking about Hussein
and Iraq, I suppose. We've got other things
on our minds now, like Amy Fisher. And
while I can perfectly understand why the
network television movie score is Amy-3,
Hussein-0, I still find our priorities
strange.
During the recent presidential cam
paign, the country grew passionate about
national politics. Now that it's over,
though, we've returned our attention to
the things we like best — David Letter
man's new contract, Joe Montana vs Steve
Young, cannibal rugby teams — and have
forgotten about others, like the crisis in he
Middle East.
I'm not so sure that's what Clinton
meant when he talked about returning to
domestic issues.
