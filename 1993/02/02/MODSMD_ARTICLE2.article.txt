# Stanford ranks sixth in nation â€“ in burglary
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Stanford had the sixth highest burglary
rate among colleges nationwide and the sec
ond highest in the state during 1991, ac
cording to a recent compilation of crime sta
tistics.
But Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said that the data do not adequate
ly reflect crime levels because of Stanford's
large size and population.
"The vast majority of other campuses are
commuter campuses," said Herrington.
"We have close to 1,000 single-family
homes. We have two grade schools.
"There is no other campus in the United
States like that," he added.
Furthermore, Stanford had a low rate of
violent crime compared to schools in Cali
fornia and throughout the country, accord
ing to statistics compiled by the Chronicle of
Higher Education. There were no rapes or
murders and only six aggravated assaults
on campus in 1991.
The campus has less crime now than it
did in 1971, Herrington said. "In the past 20
years, we have been able to bring the crime

rate down in the face of increasing popula
tion and more buildings," he added.
According to information published by
the University, 302 burglaries occurred at
Stanford during 1991. Of these, 162 were
committed in buildings such as classrooms
and residences and 140 involved vehicles.
The schools with the most burglaries
were Duke University with 1,030, UCLA
with 598, Alabama State University with
411, the State University of New York at
Stony Brook with 338 and the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill with 333.
Herrington said Stanford's high bur
glary numbers can be explained by its large
campus. The great number of buildings and
residences on the University's 8,000 acres
increase the chance of crime, he said.
According to Herrington, the high rate of
vehicular burglaries is also related to the
number of parking spaces on campus. He
said most campuses have fewer than 2,000
parking spaces compared to Stanford's
13,000.
Overall, the police chief suggested that
people look at the neighboring areas in
order to judge the viability of the
statistics.
The law only requires the col
leges to report crimes and arrests
that take place on campus, in
buildings or property near the
campus which are owned or con
trolled by the school for education
al and housing purposes and on
property owned or controlled by

recognized student organizations.
Stanford actually has fewer
burglaries and violent crimes
against individuals than Palo Alto
or Menlo Park, Herrington said.
USC has a lower rate of bur
glaries than Stanford, but Her
rington said the school is more
dangerous to attend because the
surrounding area is more crime
ridden and more easily accessible
from campus.
Herrington also said compar
ing many campuses is misleading
because lifestyles at different uni

versities vary.
For example, UC-Berkeley can
not easily be compared to Stan
ford because no faculty and few
students live on campus.
The crime statistics were com
piled and released under provi
sions of the federal Student
Right-to-Know and Campus
Security Act, which took effect in
September, and applies to all col
leges and universities. Institu
tions that do not comply risk los
ing their eligibility for federal stu
dent aid.
