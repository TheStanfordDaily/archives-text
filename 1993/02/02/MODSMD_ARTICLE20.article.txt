Daily misinterprets tutor's East Palo Alto experience

I AM WRITING THIS LETTER in
response to the Jan. 28 article "Vio
lence in East Palo Alto Doesn't
Deter Tutors." I feel that my words
were misinterpreted to suggest that I
was once victimized by "teenagers" who
"surrounded" my van while I was "ven
turing" into East Palo Alto to drive the
children in my tutorial program back
home.
As a coordinator for Barrio Assis
tance, I was asked if anyone in the pro
gram had ever encountered any vio
lence in East Palo Alto. I explained that
the children in our program are
brought to campus every Saturday by
volunteer student drivers.
When specifically asked if any inci
dent had ever occurred while driving, I
replied that the only incident I could
think of in my two years as coordina
tor was the one incident last quarter

after the Haunted House event on
campus.
While driving through a narrow resi
dential street en route to the children's
homes, we passed a group of male
youths (I was uncertain of their ages).
One of the youths jumped on the side of
my van, apparently holding on to the
outside handle. The van door opened
and the youth slipped or jumped off.
I mentioned that the children in my
van were startled and admitted that the
incident "shook me up." (I emphasize
that I never said or implied that these
youths "surrounded" my van.)
At first I expressed that "I used to
think of East Palo Alto as just any
neighborhood, but that (incident) made
me realize that it's not so safe." I want
to clarify that, although I see the com
munity as the home of many good fami
lies, this incident reminded me of the

crime statistics associated with East
Palo Alto, and that there was a real
possibility that we could have been in a
potentially dangerous situation.
Furthermore, I stated in the inter
view that I do not look down upon East
Palo Alto. Our neighboring town is like
any neighborhood in its being vulnera
ble to danger. Had the incident
occurred in Palo Alto or on the Stan
ford campus, I would have reacted with
the same concern, as I had no way of
knowing who had opened the van door,
or what his or her intentions were.
The reporter's questions required
that I focus on those aspects which
are related to East Palo Alto's crime
reputation, which I am not denying is
a genuine concern. However, had she
refocused and asked me what I liked
about interacting with East Palo Alto,
I could have easily shared with her my

many anecdotes about how most of
the Barrio Assistance families go out
of their way to make me feel welcome
in their homes. Or how I look forward
to talking with the children, as they
have a way of challenging me with
their insightful and unique perspec
tives.
If there is any message I would hope
to impress upon you, it is that Stanford
students who tutor children from East
Palo Alto are not martyrs who take
great risks by "venturing into Palo
Alto's next-door neighbor," but rather
that we receive just as much, if not
more, than what we give through these
programs. That is why I continue to
drive and coordinate for Barrio Assis
tance and do not hesitate to encourage
others to do the same.
