# Prof. Glass replies to denunciation of CIV, debate performance
## 
### 
I have read with some sadness the let
ter published today from Brian Cook. I
must take exception with his characteriza
tion of my opening statement as petty. In
that statement, I presented three rather
decisive arguments against the conclusion
of D'Souza's book as it was represented in
the "resolved" statement (that students
are getting an education in closed-minded
ness and intolerance).
First, his argument is based on a faulty
theory: Neither a book, a course, nor four
years of courses is sufficient to make any
one open- or closed-minded, or tolerant or
intolerant. Education, learning and per
sonal attitudes interact in ways far more
complex than D'Souza indicates.
Second, he uses weak logic in his argu
ments (such as they are): Particular cases,

even egregious or spectacular ones, and
even dozens of cases cannot provide suffi
cient warrant for his claim about Ameri
can education (or even about Stanford).
Much more research would be required
that would situate these cases in the com
plete context of university education and
curricula.
Third, with regard to Stanford,
D'Souza does not even have a case from
which to generalize because his facts are
inaccurate and his examples are mis repre
sentative of the actual CIV curriculum (I
will not repeat the specific points I raised
to support this charge, though Cook
seems to have taken note only of the
minor ones I added at the end as my time
permitted).
If Cook and D'Souza are "under
whelmed" by these arguments, so much
the worse for them. Neither of them has
offered any substantive reply. Instead,
Cook and D'Souza choose to slander and
throw mud while claiming that I am the
one doing so. This really is shameful. I
repeat my warning to the audience:

Beware the lie. Its words are poisonous no
matter how sweet and no matter how
well-seasoned with grains of truth.
As for me, I am still waiting for
D'Souza's apologies to Rigoberta Menchu
and to Stanford faculty, administration
and students. I suppose I might now add
that apologies are due to the Nobel Prize
Committee (which D'Souza asserted was
another institution overtaken by the "vic
tims' revolution") and the debate audience
(which he tried to fool with his diversion
ary magic trick of "testing" their knowl
edge of things he thought important).
Finally, if Cook wants to apologize to
me for the excesses of his letter, fine. I do
not see that I owe anyone any apologies. I
have no doubt that my defense of CIV
could have been stronger, but what
defense I offered seems plenty strong
enough to demonstrate that D'Souza's
claim was unscholarly and unfounded.
