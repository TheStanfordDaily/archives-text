Yell leaders vs. Dollies
controversy overlooks
merits of both groups
In response to the letter on Feb. 1
defending the cheerleaders, it should be
noted that the Dollies did not "during
the game against USC lounge on lawn
chairs." They did so at the Northwest
ern game.
Regardless, the Band, the Dollies and
the Tree have worked hard to support
all of Stanford's athletic teams this year
and in years past. We regret that 44
members of the football team have not
noticed it.
The attack on the Dollies in the letter
comes from another misguided perspec
tive in an argument where people believe
only what they want to believe.
"As for hard work," the Dollies started
their workouts in August, the same time
as the cheerleaders and football team did.
No one saw them because, as happens
every year, five local families graciously
opened their homes so the Dollies could
have someplace to stay and practice.

Incidentally, Dollies' uniforms are
traditionally red and white in the fall,
white and red in the spring, and white
and "cardinal" in the winter.
In fact, the Band, Dollies and cheer
leaders have made strides since the
beginning of the school year to hammer
out an agreement under which the two
groups can coexist. So far, it has worked
well during basketball season.
However, there is an important distinc
tion that no one seems to be making. Dol
lies dance, cheerleaders cheer. It's that
simple. The Dollies have danced and will
continue to dance to the Band's music.
While that does not limit their actions,
it is their primary role. If the cheerleaders
lead cheers, fantastic! But the Band can't
figure out why a group that once com
pared us to a "junior high school band"
would want to dance to our music.
This whole "controversy" loses sight
of the main issue, which is that everyone
is out there to see the teams win. Just
because certain people take sides in the
argument doesn't mean all groups can't
be appreciated for what they do. As a
Stanford athletic supporter, there's
nothing I'd like to see more than a full
and raucous crowd at every event.
The truth is, while band members,

cheerleaders and football players — who
seem to be able to talk specifically about
these sideline occurrences — continue to
bicker, we are still confronted with the
fact that it will take more than hard
working female and male cheerleaders,
and one hardworking, wacky, Band to
improve the lack of crowd noise at Stan
ford venues. And if that's an overstate
ment, then . . . well, it isn't.

Dialogue superior to
debate, allows honest
scrutiny of disputes
Notes on attending a debate on multi
cultural education:
In the audience, our bodies stiffen.
We squirm and reel with the punches.
Our egos start buzzing madly. So what's
the point of it all? Is this the best situa
tion we can create? Is this the best we
can bring out in each other?
The surprise of the clever ad
hominem. The agile riposte. The fatal

objection. Who cares? That's so far
removed from what's interesting now,
and so far removed from the self
knowledge and reflection we dearly
need.
The promoters probably thought, as
teachers sometimes do, that a "lively"
debate would stir things up, make the
sparks fly, really get folks thinking, real
ly get them to care.
But the way out of our cul-de-sac has
so little to do with debate and so much
to do with dialogue. Debate, high or low,
is an artless way of promoting growth in
feeling and thought. Debate only breeds
more debate. Dialogue is a different
species:
•Dialogue listens, trying to hear.
Debate looks for openings.
•Dialogue reveals itself. Debate hides
itself.
•Dialogue is quick to concede. Debate
is quick to defend.
•Dialogue is spontaneous, necessarily.
Debate rehearses, and later privately
enjoys revisiting its best lines.
•Dialogue begins with questions, not
knowing its destination. Debate begins
with answers.
•Dialogue can threaten what is deep
within us. Debate threatens only what is

on the surface.
•Above all, dialogue is kind, or at
least aims for kindness. Debate finds
pleasure in wounding. Its aim is to even
the score.
Multicultural education is threatened
at Stanford not because of the absence or
presence of some policy, some individual,
or some requirement. We are at a dead
end because, on all sides, we tend to be
satisfied with our answers and afraid of
our questions.
But the questions are there, and they
aren't going away. The dialogue that the
nation needs and that the institution
needs has hardly begun.
Now our decade-old conversation
about multicultural learning faces a new
threat. Wherever we come together-at
work, in the cafeteria, at a house meet
ing or on the floor in the hallway around
midnight-dialogue takes time. Genuine
dialogue will always require commit
ment and generosity. These days, as stu
dents, faculty and staff, we are smoothly
avoiding commitments, and there's
nothing we are guarding more carefully
than our time.

In response to the letter on Feb. 1
defending the cheerleaders, it should be
noted that the Dollies did not "during
the game against USC lounge on lawn
chairs." They did so at the Northwest
ern game.
Regardless, the Band, the Dollies and
the Tree have worked hard to support
all of Stanford's athletic teams this year
and in years past. We regret that 44
members of the football team have not
noticed it.
The attack on the Dollies in the letter
comes from another misguided perspec
tive in an argument where people believe
only what they want to believe.
"As for hard work," the Dollies started
their workouts in August, the same time
as the cheerleaders and football team did.
No one saw them because, as happens
every year, five local families graciously
opened their homes so the Dollies could
have someplace to stay and practice.

Incidentally, Dollies' uniforms are
traditionally red and white in the fall,
white and red in the spring, and white
and "cardinal" in the winter.
In fact, the Band, Dollies and cheer
leaders have made strides since the
beginning of the school year to hammer
out an agreement under which the two
groups can coexist. So far, it has worked
well during basketball season.
However, there is an important distinc
tion that no one seems to be making. Dol
lies dance, cheerleaders cheer. It's that
simple. The Dollies have danced and will
continue to dance to the Band's music.
While that does not limit their actions,
it is their primary role. If the cheerleaders
lead cheers, fantastic! But the Band can't
figure out why a group that once com
pared us to a "junior high school band"
would want to dance to our music.
This whole "controversy" loses sight
of the main issue, which is that everyone
is out there to see the teams win. Just
because certain people take sides in the
argument doesn't mean all groups can't
be appreciated for what they do. As a
Stanford athletic supporter, there's
nothing I'd like to see more than a full
and raucous crowd at every event.
The truth is, while band members,

cheerleaders and football players — who
seem to be able to talk specifically about
these sideline occurrences — continue to
bicker, we are still confronted with the
fact that it will take more than hard
working female and male cheerleaders,
and one hardworking, wacky, Band to
improve the lack of crowd noise at Stan
ford venues. And if that's an overstate
ment, then . . . well, it isn't.

Dialogue superior to
debate, allows honest
scrutiny of disputes
Notes on attending a debate on multi
cultural education:
In the audience, our bodies stiffen.
We squirm and reel with the punches.
Our egos start buzzing madly. So what's
the point of it all? Is this the best situa
tion we can create? Is this the best we
can bring out in each other?
The surprise of the clever ad
hominem. The agile riposte. The fatal

objection. Who cares? That's so far
removed from what's interesting now,
and so far removed from the self
knowledge and reflection we dearly
need.
The promoters probably thought, as
teachers sometimes do, that a "lively"
debate would stir things up, make the
sparks fly, really get folks thinking, real
ly get them to care.
But the way out of our cul-de-sac has
so little to do with debate and so much
to do with dialogue. Debate, high or low,
is an artless way of promoting growth in
feeling and thought. Debate only breeds
more debate. Dialogue is a different
species:
•Dialogue listens, trying to hear.
Debate looks for openings.
•Dialogue reveals itself. Debate hides
itself.
•Dialogue is quick to concede. Debate
is quick to defend.
•Dialogue is spontaneous, necessarily.
Debate rehearses, and later privately
enjoys revisiting its best lines.
•Dialogue begins with questions, not
knowing its destination. Debate begins
with answers.
•Dialogue can threaten what is deep
within us. Debate threatens only what is

on the surface.
•Above all, dialogue is kind, or at
least aims for kindness. Debate finds
pleasure in wounding. Its aim is to even
the score.
Multicultural education is threatened
at Stanford not because of the absence or
presence of some policy, some individual,
or some requirement. We are at a dead
end because, on all sides, we tend to be
satisfied with our answers and afraid of
our questions.
But the questions are there, and they
aren't going away. The dialogue that the
nation needs and that the institution
needs has hardly begun.
Now our decade-old conversation
about multicultural learning faces a new
threat. Wherever we come together-at
work, in the cafeteria, at a house meet
ing or on the floor in the hallway around
midnight-dialogue takes time. Genuine
dialogue will always require commit
ment and generosity. These days, as stu
dents, faculty and staff, we are smoothly
avoiding commitments, and there's
nothing we are guarding more carefully
than our time.
