## Women's tennis faces Fresno St. 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
When women's tennis head
coach Frank Brennan was told
that the Cardinal's victory over
Washington last Saturday
marked his 300 th at Stanford,
you might say he put it in per
spective.
"Well," Brennan said, "it just
means I've been around a long
time."
In his 13 years with the
women's tennis team, Brennan
has presided over one of the
most successful tennis programs
in collegiate history, coaching
his players to eight of the last 11
NCAA team titles, seven singles
and four doubles champi
onships.
And though he's logged 300
wins with Stanford, they aren't
what Brennan recalls in year
No. 14.
"It's hard to remember all the
wins," Brennan said. "But I've
only had 31 losses, and I remfem
ber every one of those."
With a season-opening win
against Washington under its
belt, Stanford hopes to get Bren
nan's 301st win against Fresno
State today.
The Cardinal (1-0, 1-0 Pacific
10 Conference) hosts the Bull
dogs at 1:30 p.m. at Stanford
Tennis Stadium.
"Fresno State is a good, solid
team like the Washington
teams," Brennan said. "It's a
nice, early-season match to test
the players and see how they can
do."
Stanford's young lineup will
get a test against Fresno State as
No. 1 Laxmi Poruri and No. 2
Heather Willens will be out of
the lineup to rest for the Rolex
Indoor Championships, which
begin Feb. 4 in Minneapolis.
The Cardinal will start junior

Kristine Kurth in the No. 2 posi
tion, while sophomore Kim
Shasby will take over the top
spot.
Brennan described Shasby's
play at the Pac-10 Indoor Cham
pionships in Seattle last week
end as "one of the best perfor
mances I've seen from a Stan
ford player," and expects her to
rise to the occasion playing in
the No. 1 position today.
"She's playing red-hot now —
she'll do real well," Brennan
said. "No one's immune to pres
sure, but she's the most immune
to pressure out of everyone on
the team."
Amy Chiminello and Emma
Woodhouse will move up to the
Nos. 3 and 4 slots, while fresh
men Wendy Sacks and Sonya
Cotero will move up to the fifth
and sixth starting singles posi
tions.
"Sonya was really the star of
the whole match Saturday,"
Brennan said. "Everyone was
talking about Sonya when it was
all over."
Freshman Beth Berris and
Kurth will team up in the No. 1
doubles spot for the Cardinal,
followed by Chiminello and
Shasby at No. 2, and Sacks and
Cotero playing in the No. 3 slot,
their second start in two dual
matches.
Although Sacks and Cotero
have played in numerous major
tournaments, Brennan says that
playing one's first game in Stan
ford Tennis Stadium is always a
nerve-wracking experience for
freshman players.
"Most of our top players play
the U.S. Open, Wimbledon," he
said.
"But when they put on a
Stanford uniform and they're
playing in front of their dorm,
they're nervous — they're a
wreck."
