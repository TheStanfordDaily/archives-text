# Kate Paye's off for Cardinal hoops
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Although Cardinal basketball
player Kate Paye is only a sopho
more, she has been exposed to
Stanford tradition for much
longer than just two short years.
"I've grown up here all my
life," she said. "I've been going
to Stanford football games forev
er."
A 5-foot-8 guard from Wood
side, Calif., Paye followed in the
footsteps of several other mem
bers of her family when she set
foot on campus a year-and-a-half
ago. Both her parents went here,
as did her sister Amy, who grad
uated in 1991. In addition, Kate
spent part of her childhood
watching and learning from her
brother John, the starting quar
terback for the Cardinal football
team from 1983 to 1986.
"I started playing basketball
because my family is very sports
oriented," Paye said. "My broth
er has played sports ever since
he was a kid, and I just sort of
picked up on that, and I tagged
along with him to the gym."
John had an even stronger
influence on his younger sister
during her high school years,
coaching Kate at Menlo School
for her entire prep career. It was
at Menlo that Kate led her squad
to three consecutive state cham
pionships and was voted High
School Player of the Year in Cal
ifornia each time (Division 5).
"I really appreciate what
[John] did. He gave up a lot of
time and put in a lot of effort and
energy to help me develop," she
said.
Though it hasn't been easy,
Paye has made a successful tran
sition to college basketball, turn
ing into a crucial member of the
defending national-champion
Cardinal. This season, her play
ing time has increased substan
tially, and she has even been

called on to start in almost half
of Stanford's contests.
"I think it took me a long time
to get adjusted to this level of
play," Paye said. "Everything's
much quicker."
Much of Paye's recent success
can be attributed to her work
ethic over the past summer.

1 kind of knew all
along that this was
where I wanted to be.
I was going to do
whatever it took to
make it work out.'

According to teammate
Christy Hedgpeth, "She played
[basketball] a lot this summer.
Anytime you play a lot in the
summer, that helps your confi
dence, your physical skills and
your mental concentration."
Paye has responded nicely to
the tougher competition, averag
ing four points, three rebounds,
and three assists per game this
year. More important than these
statistics, however, is her defen
sive role on the team. According
to Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer, Paye constantly
shuts down opposing teams'
players on offense.
"She takes a lot of pride in her
defense," VanDerveer said. "I
call her 'the spoiler.' The people
she guards average 25 points
coming into the game and go out
with 10."
Paye's defensive skills may
have been most apparent when
Stanford hosted archrival Cali
fornia two-and-a-half weeks ago.
