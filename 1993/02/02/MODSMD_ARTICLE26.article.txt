# Kate Paye's off for Cardinal hoops
## 
### Brian Border Staff writer 
Although Cardinal basketball
player Kate Paye is only a sopho
more, she has been exposed to
Stanford tradition for much
longer than just two short years.
"I've grown up here all my
life," she said. "I've been going
to Stanford football games forev
er."
A 5-foot-8 guard from Wood
side, Calif., Paye followed in the
footsteps of several other mem
bers of her family when she set
foot on campus a year-and-a-half
ago. Both her parents went here,
as did her sister Amy, who grad
uated in 1991. In addition, Kate
spent part of her childhood
watching and learning from her
brother John, the starting quar
terback for the Cardinal football
team from 1983 to 1986.
"I started playing basketball
because my family is very sports
oriented," Paye said. "My broth
er has played sports ever since
he was a kid, and I just sort of
picked up on that, and I tagged
along with him to the gym."
John had an even stronger
influence on his younger sister
during her high school years,
coaching Kate at Menlo School
for her entire prep career. It was
at Menlo that Kate led her squad
to three consecutive state cham
pionships and was voted High
School Player of the Year in Cal
ifornia each time (Division 5).
"I really appreciate what
[John] did. He gave up a lot of
time and put in a lot of effort and
energy to help me develop," she
said.
Though it hasn't been easy,
Paye has made a successful tran
sition to college basketball, turn
ing into a crucial member of the
defending national-champion
Cardinal. This season, her play
ing time has increased substan
tially, and she has even been

called on to start in almost half
of Stanford's contests.
"I think it took me a long time
to get adjusted to this level of
play," Paye said. "Everything's
much quicker."
Much of Paye's recent success
can be attributed to her work
ethic over the past summer.

1 kind of knew all
along that this was
where I wanted to be.
I was going to do
whatever it took to
make it work out.'
— Kate Paye

According to teammate
Christy Hedgpeth, "She played
[basketball] a lot this summer.
Anytime you play a lot in the
summer, that helps your confi
dence, your physical skills and
your mental concentration."
Paye has responded nicely to
the tougher competition, averag
ing four points, three rebounds,
and three assists per game this
year. More important than these
statistics, however, is her defen
sive role on the team. According
to Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer, Paye constantly
shuts down opposing teams'
players on offense.
"She takes a lot of pride in her
defense," VanDerveer said. "I
call her 'the spoiler.' The people
she guards average 25 points
coming into the game and go out
with 10."
Paye's defensive skills may
have been most apparent when
Stanford hosted archrival Cali
fornia two-and-a-half weeks ago.

Kate Paye, sophomore point guard for the Cardinal women's bas
ketball team, hopes to pass her brother John and other Stanford
family members in the minds of Cardinal fans.
She was assigned to match up
with Bears superstar Milica
Vukadinovic, who was averaging
16 points-per-game at the time.
Paye flustered her opponent,
keeping her to 12 points on 5-for
-16 shooting and causing her to
turn the ball over three times.
"Paye did a great job on Vukadi
novic," VanDerveer said after the
game. "She works very hard not to
let someone get the ball, and if they
do, she guards them close."
While Paye may be earning a
name for herself with aggressive
defensive play, she also impresses
people with her unselfishness on
offense.
"She's always looking for
other people," VanDerveer said.
"She does a lot of things that go
unnoticed. She's a proverbial
blue-collar worker."
That doesn't mean that Paye
isn't a competitor, though.
According to Hedgpeth, who is
Paye's roommate, "We're both real
ly competitive, so we always play
backgammon and all these other
games. It gets pretty intense."
VanDerveer agreed with this
assessment.
"She's very competitive," the
eighth-year coach said. "I haven't
played her [in backgammon] yet.
I don't know how good she is."
Paye has helped the Cardinal
achieve its admirable 15-4 record
so far this season, but has ex
pressed concern with the squad's
overall play.
"We've really struggled in the
NCAA season to get ourselves
going," she said. "I don't think
we've hit our stride yet. We're not
really consistent this year."
If Stanford is to repeat as
national champion, Paye might
have to step up her offensive pro
duction for the postseason.
"She's not shooting the ball as
well as she could be," VanDerveer
said. "She needs to take the ball
to the basket more."
While Paye is very much a part
of VanDerveer's plans for present
and future titles for Cardinal bas
ketball, she also brings to the pro
gram unique ties to the school's
illustrious athletic past.
"I kind of knew all along that this
was where I wanted to be," Paye
said of her family's Stanford connec
tion. "I was going to do whatever it
took to make it work out."
