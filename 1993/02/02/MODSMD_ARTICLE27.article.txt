# Winning begets winning despite regular season troubles
## 
### 
Now that wasn't so painful, was it?
Many people (myself included)
laid themselves on the line by
boldly predicting that there was no way
the Buffalo Bills were going to defeat the
Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVII last
Sunday. As it turned out, there was noth
ing to worry about in the first place. The
Cowboys (52) have earned the right to be
called "America's Team" until next Jan
uary, while the Bills (17) must once again
go home and figure out what went wrong.
However, looking back on the Super
Hype that was the last two weeks, what
stands out for me is how natural it felt to
give the Cowboys the benefit of the
doubt. Sure, they were the youngest
team in the National Football League
and had suffered through the worst sea
son in NFL history just three years ago.
Sure, a Cowboys victory would make
them the third-consecutive Super Bowl
champion from the NFC Eastern Divi
sion, give the National Football Confer
ence its ninth-straight NFL title and
11th of the last 12, and install the Bills in
the record books as the first team to lose
three-straight Roman Numeral Classics.
Surely we hadn't forgotten that the law

of averages does exist in our time (no, we
hadn't, and don't call me Shirley).
Yet all disbelief was blissfully suspend
ed in the days leading up to Superbole (the
logical contraction of "Super Bowl" and
"hyperbole"). A little leap of faith and the
knowledge that Cowboys were supposed to
have the weapons to shoot down Buffalo
sent many of us scrambling to make deals
with any remaining Bills' backers in order
to put bills back in our pockets.
While our behavior may have been
more or less indiscriminate, I don't blame
those who engaged in it. In fact, it's no
secret that "America loves a winner," and
our concentration on winning is an under
standable and necessary consequence of
the capitalistic society in which we live.

Americans accentuate and encourage
positive stories like the Cowboys', while
they lump the Bills with the Minnesota
Vikings and Denver Broncos in the
"horseshoes and hand grenades" catego
ry, all the better to single out their
uncanny ability to come just close enough
to lose, when it really counts.
Our fixation with winning and staying
on top has made th*» 1990's a comfortable
decade for sports fans. In particular,
three teams — the Chicago Bulls, Duke's
Blue Devils and the Pittsburgh Penguins
— won back-to-back championships in
'91 and '92 and stand poised to three
peat in their leagues for the first time
since 1966, 1973 and 1983, respectively.
Another squad, our very own Cardinal
women's basketball team, took titles in
'90 and '92 and would have done the
same in the intervening year were it not
for key injuries to center Trisha Stevens
and forward Julie Zeilstra.
However, as the performance of these
four clubs has been relatively weak this
year, many theories abound to explain
why. Has Horace Grant's ongoing feud
with Michael Jordan finally gotten out of
hand? Has the departure of Christian

Laettner left Duke without a chance in
the NCAA Tournament? Has Mario
Lemieux's Hodgkins disease done to the
Penguins what no other team in hockey
could? Could Ann Adkins and Kelly
Dougherty possibly have meant that
much to Stanford, which returned every
one else on its roster from last season?
All four would-be dynasties have been
written off by people who should know bet
ter — people who didn't seem to mind
when the New York Knicks extended the
Bulls to seven games in last year's playoffs,
when North Carolina and Wake Forest got
the better of the Blue Devils in ACC play,
when the Washington Capitals had the
Penguins down 3-1 in the first round of
Stanley Cup action or when Arizona State
ambushed the Cardinal in Tempe.
Are our memories really that short?
Must everything be as "easy" as picking
the NFC to win the Super Bowl in order for
us to look past the daily bump-and-grind of
competitive sports, to see that even the
winningest teams in history actually lost
on their way to glory? Or that losing may
actually help a team that is saddled with
the unbelievable expectations placed on
this year's three-peat candidates?

I am not implying that the Bulls, Dev
ils, Penguins and Cardinal have not been
trying to win their regular season games
up to this point — all have some legiti
mate obstacles to overcome before they
reach the "promised land" again. What I
am saying, though, is that these teams
need less practice at winning than do
their more eager opponents. While a one
time upset during a rigorous regular sea
son can happen at any time, these four
teams have postseason capabilities (and
even whole strategies) that they have yet
to unfurl; meanwhile, detractors contin
ue to nail their coffins shut.
It is always proper to recognize a
reigning champion and pay the respects
inherent to that status, especially in the
case of teams that have already proven
they can repeat the feat. Don't write
them off, and don't be surprised to see
any of them do it again.
Trust me, it won't hurt.

Andy Eiser, a Daily sports editor for perpe
tuity, wants to thank the NFL Hall of Fame
voters for bringing about the greatest
moment in Charger history by electing Dan
Fouts. Oh, and thanks for Bill Walsh, too.
