# Athletes of the Week
## 
### 
In the wake of yet another lopsided
Super Bowl, The Daily's Athletes of the
Week — Marcus Lollie and Lea Loveless —
represent Cardinal men's basketball and
women's swimming, two teams whose fates
have been decidedly different up to this
point in the season.
Lollie, a senior point guard from Seattle,
raised his own level of play, despite Stan

ford's defeats at the hands of home state
Pacific 10 Conference rivals Washington
State and Washington.
Against the Cougars last Thursday, Lol
lie tallied 18 points, including 10 during a
14-5 Cardinal run at the beginning of the
second half that tied the score.
He also dished out five assists, grabbed
four rebounds and had two steals on the
night.
On Saturday, he followed that up with a
16-point performance (including four
three-pointers) to put forward with a team
leading four assists in the Cardinal's heart
breaking loss to the Huskies.
Lollie will lead the Cardinal into its
toughest road trip of the year when it takes
on Arizona and Arizona State in the Grand
Canyon State later this week.

Loveless, a senior from Crestwood, N.Y.,
stood out among many Cardinal stars in
Stanford's back-to-back thrashings of
UCLA and USC last weekend.
On Friday, she posted the first of her
team's nine deGuerre Pool records as her
backstroke leg of the 400-yard medley relay
was clocked in 54.11 seconds. She then
added another pool record against the Bru
ins when she lowered a personal best in her
specialty, the 200 back.
Loveless then tied her new 200 back
mark the following day against the Trojans
as the Cardinal remained undefeated on the

dual-meet season.
Of course, Pac-10 and other collegiate
competition cannot compare to Loveless'
experience last summer as a Barcelona
Olympian. There, she swam the backstroke
leg for the gold-medal winning United
States 400-meter medley relay team and
added an individual bronze medal in the
100 back.
