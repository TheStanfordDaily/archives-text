# Ruggers down Gaels

### Brian Brennan Staff writer 
The Stanford men's rugby
team continued its march toward
the Pacific Coast playoffs with a
20-6 win over St. Mary's last Sat
urday. The Cardinal defense
ruled the day as the Gaels pene
trated to the Stanford five-meter
line on several occasions but were
denied each time.
It was a loss to St. Mary's last
year that knocked Stanford out
of playoff contention, so revenge
was on the mind of the Cardinal
players. "They dealt us a real
blow last year," said senior loose
head prop Justin Davis, who
anchors the Stanford scrum. "It
was time for them to pay up."
The Cardinal, undefeated in
league play, opened the scoring
five minutes into the first half by
feeding the ball out to senior
wingman Brian Bell, who
streaked in for the try. "It was a
textbook play," said Bell. "The
ball moved out so fast that (St.
Mary's) never had a chance."
For the third-straight game,
the Stanford pack dominated the
scrum, but though the Gaels
were physically small, they pre
sented a stiff challenge to the
Cardinal. "They kept us moving
all over the field," said Stanford
captain Trevor Brown. "We were

in better shape than they were,
but let's just say I was pretty
happy when the ref blew the final
whistle."
The second Cardinal score
came with 15 minutes remaining
in the first half, as the ball was
once again spun out to Bell at
midfield, where the Gaels were
ready for him this time. The Car
dinal had support for Bell,
though, and he fed the ball back
inside. The intricate passing of
Ben Wright, Dan Lazar, John
Girard and Eric Flecten led the
ball back across the field to senior
football recruit Vince Otoupal,
who blasted over the goal line for
the score.
Two St. Mary's penalty kicks
left a halftime score of 12-6, but
Stanford came out early in the
second half to dash any Gael
comeback hopes. With a scrum
inside St. Mary's 10-meter line,
the Cardinal pack marched
toward the goal line.
The scrum fell apart with only
meters to go, and scrum-half
Charlie Savage got the ball out to
senior Matt Tripp, who pounded
his way into the try zone. "It was
a good win, but we have a long
way to go," Tripp said. "That's
about all I can say."
The team is now focusing on
this Saturday's impending visit
to Chico State.
