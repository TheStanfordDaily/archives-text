# Palo Alto may give road funds
## Sand Hill talks to continue 
### Lesley Edwards Staff writer 
Stanford won a minor victory in its ongoing battle
to extend Sand Hill Road last night when the Palo
Alto City Council agreed to continue negotiations
with the University about a possible financial contri
bution.
Council members emphasized, however, that con
tinuing the negotiating process did not mean that the
council would necessarily approve the project in the
long run.
"This motion simply says that there is the possi
bility of financial involvement," said Vice Mayor Liz
Kniss. "I don't see this as a fait accomplit."
But Andy Doty, Stanford's director of community
relations, said that city funding is crucial to the pro
ject.
"Without city participation, we would have to se
riously reconsider configuration of the road," he said.
The proposal involves two major initiatives: ex
tending Sand Hill Road to El Camino Real and widen
ing it to four lanes as well as closing a portion of Ar
boretum Road so that the two halves of the Stanford
Shopping Center can be united.
Stanford has requested that Palo Alto pay for
$2.15 million of the $9 million total projected cost.
The council, in turn, has asked the University to re
duce the city's $360,000 annual lease payments on El
Camino Park, which is located across from the shop
ping center.
A possible alternative is to
expand Sand Hill to three lanes
instead of four, but Doty said the
resulting decrease in traffic to the
shopping center might wipe out
the project's profit margin.
Many of the concerns shared
yesterday by council members
and local residents will not be
addressed until an environmental
impact report is completed.
Kniss said Stanford will pay all
the costs of the report.
"We can't go further until we
know what the project is," said
council member Lanie Wheeler.
"We are far from that point."
It may a long time before the
council makes a decision about
whether to approve the project.
"A year or two years from now,
we will look at this once again,"
said Kniss. "This is a long pro
cess."
Stanford officials claim the city
will benefit financially from the
project because the $140,000
square feet of new stores in the
shopping center will bring in
more sales tax revenue.
"The city gets its $2.15 million
back in a little over three and a
half years, according to our calcu
lations. An incredible bargain,"
said Doty.
Moreover, the Sand Hill Road
extension would relieve traffic con
gestion by siphoning off the flow of
vehicles from surrounding neigh
borhoods, Stanford officials say.
But concerned Palo Alto and
Menlo Park residents who object
to the move showed up at the
meeting in an effort to persuade
the council not to consider
involvement.
Some claimed the project is a

risky investment for the city to
make during a recession.
"There is strong evidence that
the Stanford Shopping Center
type consumerism is not the type
that will drive our economy in the
upcoming decade," local resident
Denny Petrosian said. "We could
easily see our revenue projections
erode."
Petrosian also claimed that the
Sand Hill extension would exacer
bate rather than relieve traffic
congestion.
"A through-road in that loca
tion is doomed," she said. "You're
going to encourage, not discour
age, through traffic."
Others worried about the envi
ronmental impact of the project.
The Sand Hill extension would
run along San Francisquito Creek
and could threaten its well being.
It is the only natural creek left in
Palo Alto, according to resident
Emily Renzel.
"The area around the shopping
center is truly unique," said resi
dent Bill Watson. "I think [Stan
ford officials] are making a hor
rendous mistake in their land
planning process."
Doty said that those opposing
the project are far outnumbered
by residents who think it is a good
idea. According to a public survey
conducted several years ago, 86
percent of Palo Alto and Menlo
Park residents approved of the
project.
