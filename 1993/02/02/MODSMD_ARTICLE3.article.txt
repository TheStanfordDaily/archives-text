# Palo Alto may give road funds
## Sand Hill talks to continue 
### Lesley Edwards Staff writer 
Stanford won a minor victory in its ongoing battle
to extend Sand Hill Road last night when the Palo
Alto City Council agreed to continue negotiations
with the University about a possible financial contri
bution.
Council members emphasized, however, that con
tinuing the negotiating process did not mean that the
council would necessarily approve the project in the
long run.
"This motion simply says that there is the possi
bility of financial involvement," said Vice Mayor Liz
Kniss. "I don't see this as a fait accomplit."
But Andy Doty, Stanford's director of community
relations, said that city funding is crucial to the pro
ject.
"Without city participation, we would have to se
riously reconsider configuration of the road," he said.
The proposal involves two major initiatives: ex
tending Sand Hill Road to El Camino Real and widen
ing it to four lanes as well as closing a portion of Ar
boretum Road so that the two halves of the Stanford
Shopping Center can be united.
Stanford has requested that Palo Alto pay for
$2.15 million of the $9 million total projected cost.
The council, in turn, has asked the University to re
duce the city's $360,000 annual lease payments on El
Camino Park, which is located across from the shop
ping center.
