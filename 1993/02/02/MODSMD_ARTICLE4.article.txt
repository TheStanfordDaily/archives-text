# Pesky solicitors canvass campus, disregard policy

When a Mirlo resident found herself confronted by
a magazine salesman in her dorm room, she learned
that while Stanford policy officially prohibits solicit
ing, in practice it can't keep door-to-door salespeople
off campus.
"I was in my room by myself when a stranger
walked in without knocking. He tried to sell me a sub
scription to a magazine, and I declined and asked him
to leave. He refused and only left after my resident
assistant was forced to physically push him out of the
dorm," she said.
Students in many residences say they are often ha
rassed by solicitors, despite a policy in the Residential
Staff Resource Manual prohibiting "door-to-door so
licitation."
"Students are urged to call the Stanford Police
when solicitors are in the dorms," said Assoc. Direc
tor of Residential Education Diana Conklin.
But there is no county ordinance against solicita
tion, and calling the police may not be a very effective
deterrent, said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
In effect, "Res Ed's policy against solicitors is not
enforceable," he said.
The police will respond to all complaints but can
not arrest the solicitors "unless they refuse to leave
or if they cause a disturbance," he said. In practice,
the most police can do is be present when a resident
fellow requests solicitors to leave
a residence.
Niemeyer said the most
extreme case that he remembers
involved a solicitor who blocked a
student's exit and "became physi
cal" with the student. The sales
person was arrested on charges of
false imprisonment.
Niemeyer advises students
"not to let solicitors into the
rooms. Students should tell the

solicitors that they're not inter
ested, and if problems arise the
students should immediately call
the police."
Some of the most problematic
offenders are allegedly salespeo
ple for local newspapers such as
the San Francisco Chronicle and
the Peninsula Times Tribune.
Circulation officials at both
newspapers say their publications
do not handle their door-to-door
marketing directly; instead, they
hire contracting agencies which
coordinate, hire and pay solici
tors.
Tina Sung, circulation manag

er at the Chronicle, said the news
paper uses several soliciting agen
cies, but she added that she is not
aware of any complaints about
soliciting at Stanford.
However, Warren Eide, the cir
culation marketing manager at
the Times Tribune is "aware of
the situation concerning solici
tors."
Eide said he has had only one
complaint about his solicitors at
Stanford, which he relayed to the
paper's marketing agency. The
decision about whether or not to
continue selling at Stanford is left
to the agency, he added.
