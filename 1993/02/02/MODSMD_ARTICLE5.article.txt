## Libraries lure flashers, public masturbators 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Most people think of libraries as
staid and quiet places, but recent cases
of indecent exposure in University li
braries have given some studious stu
dents nasty shocks.
Although Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer acknowledged such
crimes are not daily events — he gets
reports about library flashers only
about once a year — he said that he be
lieves many cases go unreported.
One recent indecent exposure inci
dent occurred late last year at Lane
Medical Library. A woman who was
studying in the library was approached

by a man who proceeded to masturbate
in front of her, according to library di
rector Peter Stangl.
The woman reported the incident to
a staff member by phone after the ex
posure had taken place, Stangl said.
Niemeyer said the investigation into
this incident is ongoing.
"We've been working on it. This has
been a continuing problem over the
years," he said. "Just about every year
this happens."
Last year, for example, a series of
similar incidents took place in Green
Library. Several women reported
falling asleep in the library, only to
awaken and find what appeared to be
semen on their clothes and in their

to make any apprehen

hair. But Niemeyer said the Lane flash
er was likely not related to the Green
cases.
Both Stangl and Niemeyer said such
incidents are common in libraries.
Stangl said that in the 21 years he has
been Lane director, he has heard of

about 10 such cases.
Niemeyer said flashing cases have
happened "just about every year," for
the about 17 years he has been at Stan
ford.
The r imbjr of cases hit its peak
about two years ago, when police ar
rested two suspects in indecent expo
sure cases.
Besides the fact that many flashing
cases go unreported, Niemeyer said
many people who do report these cases
often wait until long after the incident,
giving suspects a chance to get away.
"We've seldom been able to make
any apprehensions because these peo-
pie just come and go," he said.
Stangl agreed. "Women tend to
be at the receiving end of this, and
— regrettably — women, for rea
sons of their own, tend not to
report it."
But Stangl and Niemeyer could
only guess why libraries seem to
attract flashers.
"Any library ... is likely to"

attract flashers, Stangl said,
because "usually libraries have
lots of nooks and crannies . . . and
usually there are lots of people sit
ting around."
Niemeyer said flashers might
also frequent libraries because
they are likely to find women
there to expose themselves to.
And while none of the flashers
in Stanford libraries have tried to
physically harm their victims,
Niemeyer said, there has been
some concern in recent years that
perhaps "these very strange serial

murderers start out like that."
Stangl said Lane has some
security guards who patrol the
library occasionally at night, but
pointed out that the large number
of out-of-the-way recesses in the
library make it virtually impossi
ble to have complete security.
Niemeyer suggested the best
way to secure oneself is to report
all flashers to the police immedi
ately so they can be apprehended.
"We would really encourage
people to call us as soon as they
can," he said.
