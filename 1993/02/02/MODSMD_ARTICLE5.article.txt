## Libraries lure flashers, public masturbators 
### Andy Dworkin Editorial staff 
Most people think of libraries as
staid and quiet places, but recent cases
of indecent exposure in University li
braries have given some studious stu
dents nasty shocks.
Although Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer acknowledged such
crimes are not daily events — he gets
reports about library flashers only
about once a year — he said that he be
lieves many cases go unreported.
One recent indecent exposure inci
dent occurred late last year at Lane
Medical Library. A woman who was
studying in the library was approached

by a man who proceeded to masturbate
in front of her, according to library di
rector Peter Stangl.
The woman reported the incident to
a staff member by phone after the ex

Niemeyer said the investigation into
this incident is ongoing.
"We've been working on it. This has
been a continuing problem over the
years," he said. "Just about every year
this happens."
Last year, for example, a series of
similar incidents took place in Green
Library. Several women reported

awaken and find what appeared to be
semen on their clothes and in their

Both Stangl and Niemeyer said such
incidents are common in libraries.
Stangl said that in the 21 years he has
been Lane director, he has heard of

about 10 such cases.
Niemeyer said flashing cases have
happened "just about every year," for
the about 17 years he has been at Stan
ford.
The r imbjr of cases hit its peak
about two years ago, when police ar
rested two suspects in indecent expo
sure cases.
Besides the fact that many flashing
cases go unreported, Niemeyer said
many people who do report these cases
often wait until long after the incident,
giving suspects a chance to get away.
