# Enthusiasm, talent define 'live-in-artist'
## 
### Stephanie Soler 
When Carlos Gonzalez was in
kindergarten, he fell in love for
the first time — with dance.
He learned his first traditional
Mexican dances at an early age,
and in middle school, he broad
ened his interest in the arts to in
clude more than just dance.
By the time he was in high
school, Gonzalez's interest in the
arts became an all-consuming
passion, and he stopped going to
his school classes altogether.
"I told my mother I was going
to high school, but I was going to
dance, drawing, sculpture and
other art classes," Gonzalez said.
Although his mother finally

found out, all was forgiven for the
sake of talent, he said.
This quarter, the 22-year-old
Gonzalez has brought his love for
dance to Stanford where he is the
"artist-in-residence" in Casa Za
pata. Gonzalez teaches a class on
folkloric dance techniques on
Saturday mornings.
When he was 16, Gonzalez
began dancing professionally. As
part of a dance troupe from the
University of Colima in Mexico,
he has travelled through Mexico,
Europe and the United States.
According to Gonzalez, the
highlight of hi 3 dance career was
performing during the '92 Expo

Dancing and other forms of the arts are the ail
consuming passion of Carlos Gonzalez, who is
the "artist-in-residence" in Casa Zapata. The 22-
year-old Gonzalez, who is teaching a Mexican
folk-dancing class during his stay at Stanford,
says his dance career was highlighted by his per
formances at the '92 Expo in Seville and last sum
mer's Olympic Games in Barcelona.
in Seville and last summer's
Olympic Games in Barcelona.
It was during his extensive
travels that he ran into Sue Cash
ion, a senior lecturer in dance at
Stanford.
Gonzalez was first impressed
with Cashion's love for Mexican
dance as he watched an eight kilo
meter procession of dancers dur
ing a celebration of the Virgin of
Soupapa in Guadalajara.
Not only did she dye her blonde
hair dark to dance in Mexico, but
she dressed as an Indian woman
to be in the procession, he
explained.

"Most Mexican people won't
even do that," he said.
Almost five years after becom
ing good friends with Cashion,
Gonzalez coincidentally became
acquainted with one of her dance
students in Mexico.
A few months later he received
an invitation to be an artist-in
residence at Casa Zapata. In addi
tion to teaching his own class,
Gonzalez is taking classes in bal
let, modern dance, jazz, musical
theater and teaching methodolo

While Gonzalez studies many
different styles of dance, his pri
mary focus is in Mexican dance
forms. He said he hopes to even
tually get a masters' in Mexican
folk dance, hopefully here at
Stanford.

Sophomore Amanda Navar, a
member the Ballet Folklorico de
Stanford, said Gonzalez is differ
ent from other dance teachers
because "he's closer to our own
age, and he's really enthusiastic."
Each class stresses endurance,
she said. The first part is a rigor
ous warm-up, and during the sec
ond half, he drills the class on
style.
During his visit, Gonzalez is
also helping the Ballet Folklorico
prepare for their main perfor
mance this spring by teaching
them a new dance.
Gonzalez' enthusiasm and out
going personality are perhaps his
most striking traits. He said he
sees a big difference between peo
ple in his home country and in the
United States.

"In Mexico, it's normal that
even if people are tense and have
work, that they're always smiling
and thinking about other peo
ple," he said. "I know every coun
try is different, but sometimes
Americans seem a little cold. I
adapt."
Gonzalez comes by his talent
naturally. His mother is a cos
tumer, his uncle is a musician, his
sister is a singer, dancer and
model, and his brother is an
artist.
Since the arts aren't consid
ered a practical profession in Mex
ico, he said few members of his
family use their talents profes
sionally.
"They do it because they love
it,"he said. "They live for the art,
not from the art."
