When Carlos Gonzalez was in
kindergarten, he fell in love for
the first time — with dance.
He learned his first traditional
Mexican dances at an early age,
and in middle school, he broad
ened his interest in the arts to in
clude more than just dance.
By the time he was in high
school, Gonzalez's interest in the
arts became an all-consuming
passion, and he stopped going to
his school classes altogether.
"I told my mother I was going
to high school, but I was going to
dance, drawing, sculpture and
other art classes," Gonzalez said.
Although his mother finally

found out, all was forgiven for the
sake of talent, he said.
This quarter, the 22-year-old
Gonzalez has brought his love for
dance to Stanford where he is the
"artist-in-residence" in Casa Za
pata. Gonzalez teaches a class on
folkloric dance techniques on
Saturday mornings.
When he was 16, Gonzalez
began dancing professionally. As
part of a dance troupe from the
University of Colima in Mexico,
he has travelled through Mexico,
Europe and the United States.
According to Gonzalez, the
highlight of hi 3 dance career was
performing during the '92 Expo
