# Black Liberation Month to highlight 'new start'
## 
### Linda Friedlieb Editorial staff 
Black Liberation Month will
kick off at Stanford this week with
a speech Friday by Jesse Jackson
Jr., followed by a series of cultural
celebrations and presentations.
The theme of the month-long
celebration of African-American
heritage, "Young, Gifted and
Black: Taking Responsibility for
our Future," emphasizes the new
beginning every person can make,
said junior Rolanda Gaines, one of
two event coordinators.
"What's most important, what
we're trying to focus on, is ... a
new start with a new president,"
she said.
Barbara Smith, acting director
of the Black Community Services
Center, said the theme is "dynam
ic" and will add to the meaning of
the month.
"The theme will focus on mov
ing our youth in a direction of tak
ing responsibility for getting in
volved and making a difference in
our future — not just for us, but
for our children," she said.
The keynote speaker will add to
the sense of newness and youth
surrounding the celebrations,
Gaines said. "The significance of
Jesse Jackson, Jr., as opposed to
his father, is he's closer to our
age," she added.
"Because of his upbringing he
is politically aware, but he is still
young," she said. "He would be
considered young, gifted and
black."
Jackson's speech will be preced
ed by the performances of dance
groups including the LA (Los
Altos) Steppers and Jam Pac'd.
The month will also feature a
jazz social, the Annual Soul Food
Dinner, Club Ujamaa and the
Second Annual Gospel Extrava
ganza.

The extravaganza will show
case the talents of many Bay Area
gospel groups. The gospel festival
is especially important "because it
gives us time to mix and develop
bonds with people in the sur
rounding community," Smith
said.
Another event,"The Diaspora
Get-Down," is aimed at cross-cul
tural interaction and celebration
through food and culture. All of
the events are sponsored by a
coalition of black volunteer stu
dent organizations and are free to
the public.
