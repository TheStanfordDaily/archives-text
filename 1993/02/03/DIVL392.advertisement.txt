Speaker: Jeff Scott

Why arc the 1980s — a period of great economic growth which has
benefitted millions of people — condemned as the "decade of greed"? Jeff
Scott challenges the economic fallacies of the "decade of greed" myth, and the
philosophical-moral premises which make it sound plausible.
The talk is based on an on-going research project by the Institute for
Objcctivist Studies, a center for research and education on Ayn Rand's
philosophy, Objectivism.
Cosponsorcd by the ASSU Speaker's Bureau and by the Institute for
Objcctivist Studies.
