University President Gerhard
Casper emphasized the impor
tance of creating the best possible
policy on unacceptable sexual con
duct, telling the ASSU Senate last
night that he hopes to have a poli
cy in place by June.
"I do think the question of sex
ual conduct is very important for
the University," he said. "I don't
think it serves any purpose to
delay further."
After receiving a draft of the
proposed policy, Casper said, the
University Cabinet decided the
proposal needed "a lot of revision
and review."
Earlier this year, the senate
passed a bill urging the Cabinet to
delay approval and garner more
student input. Casper said the re
vision process will give students
the opportunity to examine the
new policy.
However, after acknowledging
the senate's bill, Casper quickly
pointed out that students had not
been excluded.

"It is unfair to suggest that
there has been no student input,"
he said. "One problem is that stu
dents in the University change.
Students may fight for a reform
under which they do not have to
live."
Casper encouraged the senate
to "communicate its ideas speedily
to the Office of Multicultural Af
fairs."
During his quarterly meeting
with the senate, Casper also re
sponded to questions regarding
the status of the 1989 University
Committee on Minority Issues re
port, as he did at his first meeting
with the senate in November.
He said the Cabinet had "a very
lengthy discussion of the original
report as well as a 1991 annual re
view panel report" at its last meet
ing. He said a Cabinet subcommit
tee is now preparing a more de
tailed response.
Casper said his personal priori
ty in multicultural affairs rests
with affirmative action in faculty
appointments. "It is crucial we
make progress in this area," he
