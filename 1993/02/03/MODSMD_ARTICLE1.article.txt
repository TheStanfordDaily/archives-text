# Diverse faculty top priority for Casper
## Sexual conduct policy also stressed at quarterly appearance before ÀSSU

University President Gerhard
Casper emphasized the impor
tance of creating the best possible
policy on unacceptable sexual con
duct, telling the ASSU Senate last
night that he hopes to have a poli
cy in place by June.
"I do think the question of sex
ual conduct is very important for
the University," he said. "I don't
think it serves any purpose to
delay further."
After receiving a draft of the
proposed policy, Casper said, the
University Cabinet decided the
proposal needed "a lot of revision
and review."
Earlier this year, the senate
passed a bill urging the Cabinet to
delay approval and garner more
student input. Casper said the re
vision process will give students
the opportunity to examine the
new policy.
However, after acknowledging
the senate's bill, Casper quickly
pointed out that students had not
been excluded.

"It is unfair to suggest that
there has been no student input,"
he said. "One problem is that stu
dents in the University change.
Students may fight for a reform
under which they do not have to
live."
Casper encouraged the senate
to "communicate its ideas speedily
to the Office of Multicultural Af
fairs."
During his quarterly meeting
with the senate, Casper also re
sponded to questions regarding
the status of the 1989 University
Committee on Minority Issues re
port, as he did at his first meeting
with the senate in November.
He said the Cabinet had "a very
lengthy discussion of the original
report as well as a 1991 annual re
view panel report" at its last meet
ing. He said a Cabinet subcommit
tee is now preparing a more de
tailed response.
Casper said his personal priori
ty in multicultural affairs rests
with affirmative action in faculty
appointments. "It is crucial we
make progress in this area," he

said. "I am concerned that very
general debates on very general
and abstract concepts of multicul
turalism have diverted our atten
tion from this issue."
Casper also discussed the role
of the Office of Residential Educa
tion and said he hopes to "create a
somewhat better link between Res
Ed and the undergraduate cur
riculum" in the future.
"In the next few years, we hope
to take a fresh look into the rela
tion [of Res Ed] to the Cultures,
Ideas and Values requirement
and see, perhaps, if we can come
up with a mix that is more con
vincing than what already exists."

Responding to undergraduate
senator Mork Murdock's question
on students' role in University
decision making, Casper said,
"everything in the University
depends on the interaction of stu
dent and faculty."
But he cautioned against too
much student influence, especial
ly in the matter of student evalu
ations of faculty.
"As anyone who has read stu
dent evaluations can tell you,
many students put emphasis on
entertainment value. . . . This
does not say terribly much about
teaching ability."
When asked about the current
status of the legally troubled Book
store, he said the store's board of
directors will be expanded and will
include students to ensure greater
University participation.
