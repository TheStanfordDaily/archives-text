Iraq abides by 'no-fly' zone
WASHINGTON (AP) - Iraq still has
air defense missiles positioned in the
southern and northern "no-fly" zones
patrolled by U.S. aircraft, but it has
stopped U3ing radars that threaten U.S.
pilots, a Defense Department spokesman
said yesterday.
Bob Hall, the spokesman, said U.S.
and allied aircraft are continuing to
monitor the "no-fly" zones, where Iraqi
aircraft are not permitted, but have not
been threatened recently by Iraqi sur
face-to-air missiles or radars associated
with the missiles.
Hall said this was a welcome change
from Iraqi actions in the final few weeks
of the Bush administration.
"We certainly think it's the right
thing for them to do," Hall said in the
first Defense Department news briefing
since President Clinton took office.
On Jan. 20, President Saddam Hus
sein declared a unilateral ceasefire, say
ing he wanted to give the new American
president a chance to review U.S. policy
toward Iraq.
Clinton eyes more spending
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton is eyeing $31 billion in spending
increases and tax breaks for business to
provide a short-term lift to the economy,
top administration officials have told
senators.
Clinton is considering a package con
taining $16 billion in job-creating spend
ing for fiscal 1993, and a $15 billion tax
credit for businesses that invest in
equipment, two Democratic officials,

who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said yesterday. The 1993 fiscal year runs
through Sept. 30.
In a Monday evening meeting with
senators, Clinton's top economic advis
ers said the $16 billion in spending the
president is considering will be for road
building, waste water treatment facili
ties, summer jobs, hiring teachers for
Head Start and administering childhood
vaccinations.
Spaceship to light up earth
MOSCOW (AP) — Turning night into
day is the stuff of Bible stories and sci
ence fiction. But tonight, an unmanned
Russian spaceship will shine a reflected
solar spotlight from the heavens onto
the dark side of Earth.
Weather permitting, light from the
mirror in the sky should appear as a flar
ing star to those in the 2 1/2-mile-wide
path it will illuminate as it sweeps over
the surface of the globe, officials said.
If it works, Operation Banner could
lead to the development of panels of
space mirrors powerful enough to light
up nighttime work projects, rescue oper
ations and sun-starved polar regions —
something like a cosmic night-light.
"Nobody has ever tried this," flight
director Viktor Blagov said yesterday
from the flight control center north of
Moscow. "We could light up any city at
its request from midnight until 6 a.m."
Such practical uses of the night light
are still a decade away and face many hur
dles, including funding, Blagov said. But
many space experts are enthusiastic about
applications of the device, which has been
on the drawing board for three years.
