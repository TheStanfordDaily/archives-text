JERUSALEM (AP) — By refusing
Israel's offer to let 100 of them return, the
Palestinians deported to south Lebanon
have retained a platform from which they
can present themselves as victims and
block U.S.-backed peace talks.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who
ordered the deportations and made the
offer Monday to let some men return, came
under a barrage of criticism in Israel yes
terday for failing to win a propaganda vic
tory.
Even his spokesman, Gad Ben-Ari,
acknowledged the 400 deportees — mem
bers of Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist
group — were holding the world's atten
tion.
Ben-Ari said Rabin had "called the

bluff" of the Palestinians by showing that
they wanted to prolong the crisis rather
than reach a settlement.
But the deportees remain on "a live
stage of propaganda," he noted. "It pro
vides them with an opportunity to present
themselves as innocent victims."
Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian taking
part in the U.S.-sponsored peace talks, said
the delegation's stance pleases Hamas and
other groups that oppose peace talks with
Israel.
"Overall, the deportees are the winners
because they are able to delay the peace
negotiations," he said. "The losers are all
the parties interested in the continuity of
the talks, which is Israel, the Palestinians
and the rest of the Arab countries."
