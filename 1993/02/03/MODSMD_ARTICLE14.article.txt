# Govt. reports economic growth
## Index of Leading Indicators shows biggest increase since '83 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Both new
home sales and the government's chief
economic forecasting gauge jumped
sharply in December, flashing two posi
tive signals for future growth in nearly a
decade.
The announcements, released by the
Commerce Department yesterday, are
the clearest signs yet of continued eco
nomic growth past midyear.
"Even if the numbers are somewhat
overstated, there's no question they
show we have economic growth ahead of
us," said economist David Berson of the
Federal National Mortgage Association.
The Department's Index of Leading
Indicators leapt 1.9 percent, the third
consecutive monthly gain and the
biggest increase since April 1983, when
the nation was emerging from the last
recession.
Meanwhile, new home sales shot up
6.3 percent in December to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 656,000, con
tributing to a 19.4 percent rise for all of
1992, the best in nine years.

The latest economic data came as the
Clinton administration put the final
touches on an economic stimulus pack
age that many analysts argue is no
longer needed.
A Democratic official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Tuesday
that the package will consist of $16 bil
lion in job-creating spending for the cur
rent fiscal year plus $15 billion in tax
breaks to encourage businesses to
invest in more equipment.
Despite the strongest economic
growth in four years during the Octo
ber-December quarter, the nation's
unemployment rate in December was
7.3 percent, less than half a percentage
point below the eight-year high of 7.7
percent in June.
"A jobless recovery is not acceptable
to the president," said economist Robert
G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago.
The administration is currently trying
to put together a long-term plan to trim
the budget deficit and federal borrowing,

a step that should reduce long-term
interest rates such as mortgage rates.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen,
in a speech to department employees,
emphasized deficit cutting and noted
that interest on the $4.1 trillion nation
al debt is the second fastest growing
spending category.
"We have to put an end to that. We
have to get control of our own economic
destiny. That's what we're committed
to," he said.
Nine of the index's 11 leading indica
tors were positive in December. Some of
the indicators include:
• A 14 percent jump in consumer con
fidence levels as measured by a Univer
sity of Michigan survey;
• A drop in the average weekly num
ber of unemployment benefit claims
from 372,000 to 334,000;
• An increase in new orders to facto
ries for consumer goods;
• And a rise in contracts for business
equipment and new commercial build
ings.
