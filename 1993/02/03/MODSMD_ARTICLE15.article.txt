# Clinton vows to modify welfare

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton pledged yesterday to transform
welfare into a "hand up, not a handout"
by giving recipients training and then
requiring them to work. He said he would
allow the nation's governors broad free
dom to experiment with welfare changes.
"Most people on welfare are yearning
for another alternative, aching for the
chance to move from dependence to dig
nity," Clinton said in a speech to the
National Governors' Association. "Wel
fare should be a second chance, not a
way of life."
Clinton broke little new ground,
largely repeating an array of campaign
promises he said would "end welfare as
we know it"and give dignity to families
who work but still find themselves
below the poverty line.
Aides said that despite Clinton's
detailed campaign proposal and yester
day's speech, many critical questions
about the policy were unresolved.
Among them was what, if any, sanctions
would be imposed on welfare recipients
who refused to work, and who besides
the disabled would be exempt from the
work requirements.
During the campaign, Clinton said
his proposal would cost $6 billion a year
for its first four years. But Bruce Reed,
the White House deputy domestic policy
adviser, said that was "not necessarily
what is going to be included in the pres
ident's budget."

To answer such questions and draft
the legislation, Clinton said he would
name within 10 days a White House-led
task force made up of officials from gov
ernment departments and agencies
involved in welfare, education and job
training. Their goal would be to draft a
legislative proposal by spring or early
summer.
Clinton's speech appeared designed
to shift public attention onto one of his
popular, conservative-sounding cam
paign themes after several days of focus
on more controversial matters. F i t -
tingly, he delivered the speech to an
organization in which then-Arkansas
Gov. Clinton cut his teeth on welfare
issues in the mid-1980s as an architect
of national reform legislation.
"I think all of us want what most
people on welfare want, a country that
gives you a hand up, not a handout,"
Clinton told the governors. "No one
likes the welfare system as it currently
exists, least of all the people who are on
it."
Clinton told the governors Washing
ton could not mandate "top-down"
reforms for varying state problems. So
he pledged to look favorably on most
state requests for waivers from federal
rules — even when he was personally
opposed to the specifics of a state exper
iment.
"And the only thing I want to say, to
ask you in return, is let us measure

these experiments and let us measure
them honestly," Clinton said. "And if it
works, let's tell everybody it works so
we can all do it, and if it doesn't, let's
have the courage to quit and admit it
didn't."
Highlights of Clinton's proposal
include:
• Expanding education and training
programs for recipients of Aid to Fami
lies with Dependent Children, the feder
al welfare program which has gone from
helping 3.7 million families in 1988 to
4.7 million last year. In return, recipi
ents would be limited to two years eligi
bility and required to work. If no private
jobs were available, some sort of com
munity service would have to be per
formed to collect benefits.
Clinton and aides said such training
and strict work requirements were crit
ical to breaking the long-term depen
dency of 25 percent of welfare recipi
ents.
• Expanding the Earned Income Tax
Credit so that no family with a parent
who worked 40 hours a week would live
below the poverty line. "If there is dig
nity in all work, there must be dignity
for every worker," Clinton said.
• Creating a national database of
"deadbeat dads" to track fathers delin
quent in making child support pay
ments and using the Internal Revenue
Service to collect from egregious viola
tors.
