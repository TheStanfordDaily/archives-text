## An UnSURE Service 
### 
Escort system befouled
by misuse of golf carts,
inefficient use of funds

FOR MANY WOMAN students,
calling SURE Escort Service
has been anything but what
the acronym promises.
Complaints about SURE carts that
are late or never show up are voiced,
and while Students United for Rape
Elimination unquestionably has cru
cial goals, these are undermined by
an ineffective service.
Many women have complained
of waiting for absurdly long periods
of time for a SURE cart to show up,
often being forced to walk to their
destination when the aforemen
tioned cart never appears.
While the students are obviously
inconvenienced by the service's lack
of dependability, a more important
consequence is the danger the
women put themselves in when
they decide to walk alone.
And this is "rape elimination?"
We simply cannot afford to allow
this lack of reliability to continue.
Not to mention the fact that
SURE is costing the students
money. Last year, the service
received an ASSU fee request of
nearly $53,000, one of the five
highest grants given to any campus
organization.
SURE coordinators say the
money is necessary for the mainte
nance of carts. Yet the most well
maintained carts — even with their
spiffy new painted logos — cannot
make the service more dependable
or punctual by themselves.
Clearly, a lack of organization or
inefficiencies in SURE's system is
to blame.
Also, the fact that the service
does use golf carts leads to unneces
sary use by students.
Large groups frequently use
SURE when they are too lazy to
walk or bike across campus. In
fact, mixed-sex groups have been
seen jammed into carts, racing

through campus laughing and
singing. This is not a traveling
party service.
While the golf carts may look
cool, and could be fast and conve
nient (if only they'd show up on
time), there are alternatives:
UCLA has a walking-escort ser
vice. Two escorts — one male, one
female — meet the caller, and walk
the student to the destination.
UC-San Diego's escorts ride
bikes across their large campus to
meet their callers, and walk with
them. UC-Berkeley utilizes a simi
lar system.
These services are prompt, effec
tive, inexpensive to maintain and
are rarely abused.
While bicycle or walking escorts
may take longer to traverse the
campus, the money saved by not
having to maintain the carts would
surely allow for a substantial, fair
ly-paid staff that will be able to
respond to the inevitable demand
for an efficient service.
While it would be a shame to dis
continue use of the carts after
investing a great amount of student
money in them, we need to recog
nize an unwise investment when
we see one — and stop pouring
funds into it.
The carts could be utilized by the
Disability Resource Center, which
always seems to be short of carts for
disabled and injured students.
If necessary, they could be sold to
Stanford Golf Course. The money
could be applied toward establish
ing the new bicycle service or other
rape prevention projects.
SURE should be commended for
its aims. It is crucial that women
students feel safe on campus, and
that all possible measures are taken
to prevent sexual assault. But in its
current form, the sdWice has not
realized its goals, and may even
serve to hinder them.
Clearly, money and convenience
are not all that are at stake. A cam
pus escort service implicitly takes
responsibility for the lives, well
being and safety of its users. The
risk of failure is far too costly to
take.
