Brooks Johnson's alleged abuse spanned decades

MY DAUGHTER, ELLEN LYONS,
won the 1979 Kinney National
High School (women's) Cross
Country Championship. She was heavily
recruited. Laurel Treon, a fine lady, was
then the Stanford women's coach. Of
course I was prejudiced in favor of my
alma mater, Stanford.
Before Ellen decided to go there, she
asked me if Stanford had a good track
coach. I responded, "Yes! If he coaches at
Stanford he must be good!" I'll never for
get that.
She matriculated in the fall of 1980. At
spring break, I learned of the horrid
treatment visited upon her by Brooks

Johnson. (Laurel was always a lady; she
left about then.) It was the same treat
ment Tish Williams received, except for
head thumping.
I strongly protested to University
President Donald Kennedy and Andy
Geiger. This type of activity did not
belong at Stanford! The alumni liaison
person (for the Athletic Department) was
Dr. Jack Friedenthal of the Law School.
Unfortunately, he did not join with
me, but opposed my strong complaints in
every way. As a former long distance run
ner for Stanford, I well kn6w how strong
a mindset a distance runner needs.
It is not easy to run competitively the

long distances, and one must run
through tremendous physical and mental
pain.
To additionally have a track coach try
ing to harass one is extremely improper
and extremely destructive. No athlete
should have to suffer epithets.
Andy Geiger never wrote me back; Dr.
Kennedy never wrote me; Jack Frieden
thal just argued and equivocated with me
and defended Johnson; Geiger didn't
respond to a letter of protest from my
cousin, the eminent Admiral Tom Hamil
ton (former PCC Director and former
Pac-8 Director).
Possibly, the administration wanted

to band together to protect their selection
of this person. Maybe they wanted to
cover their backsides and squelch my
protest. After about six months, I gave
up.
Now, I wish I had continued to urge
that the horrid, harrying practices cease.
Tish, I feel badly I didn't. The admin
istration owes Tish Williams, and all the
others, deep apologies. No coach should
viciously berate star athletes who enter
Stanford, and hurt or destroy their per
formances and their joy of competition.
