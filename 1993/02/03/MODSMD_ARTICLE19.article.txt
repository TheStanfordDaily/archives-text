# George Shultz disgraces the Hoover Institution
## 
### 
In the headlines I read after almost a
decade of investigation and dispute,
someone is finally admitting that George
Bush was in the Iran-Contra loop. Nei
ther this revelation by George Shultz nor
his apparent opposition to this illegal for
eign policy under the Reagan administra
tion justify his role in this scandal in any
way. The Secretary of State should not
have allowed the arms-for-hostages deal
to take place while he held his office. He
was unequivocally an accomplice.
His recent testimonials, however, only
highlight what is, in essence, to me his
decade-long contempt of court, contempt
of the Constitution and contempt of the
American people. No concern for nation
al security can excuse his long compli
ance and silence here; clearly, Shultz and
his colleagues were only concerned about
their job security.
President Bush may have pardoned
those involved in Iran-Contra, but Stan
ford should not. I would gladly join in
any protest of George Shultz's presence
at Stanford University. He is a disgrace

to his employer, the Hoover Institution.
