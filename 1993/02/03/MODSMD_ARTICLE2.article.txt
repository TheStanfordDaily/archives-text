# Skunks, squirrels & scorpions:
## Creepy-crawlies covering soggy campus 
### Skip Schwartz Staff writer 
Scorpions. Squirrels. Skunks. No, they
aren't just in the zoo — many of them are
showing up on campus and turning Stanford
into a mini-version of "Wild Kingdom."
Due to the drought and then the heavy rains
of the past two months, the campus has been
overrun by animals of all shapes and sizes that
would have made Marlon Perkins proud.
Clark Vit, Wilbur Hall facilities supervisor,
claims that he has "never seen the lant] prob
lem so bad throughout the system."
According to Pete Davidson, vice-president
of operations of Crane Pest Control, animal
problems, particularly ants, are not just con

centrated at Stanford but are happening all
over Northern California.
Davidson, whose company is contracted by
the University to eliminate "a myriad of prob
lems including skunks, wild cats, yellow- jack
ets and ants," blames the unusually heavy
rains for flooding ants' nests, forcing them to
relocate.
Freshman Jeremy Laster, a Toyon resident,
said the ants are definitely a problem, especial
ly in the bathroom where "they crawl up your
legs and feet."
While the pest control service does spray
ants to kill them immediately, Davidson said
they prefer to use "slower and more effective
baiting" — poisoned traps which the ants take
back to the nest.

The rain washed down most of the spray
used on the outside of buildings, forcing the use
of a more granular bait. However, the problem
has definitely "quieted down," Davidson said.
But Tom Cramer, house manager of 553
Mayfield, is not as quick to concede man's vic
tory over the insects.
Cramer, whose house kitchen was "over
run" with a 40-foot long ant trail when the res
idents returned from winter break, said his
house's most recent encounter with an arach
nid was even more exciting.
On Thursday evening, a resident of 553 no
ticed a "big bug" in her room which turned out
to be a scorpion, Cramer said.
