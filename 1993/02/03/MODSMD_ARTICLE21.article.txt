# Huyck abused crucial vehicles of expression
## 
### 
We're writing in response to today's
(Jan. 30) events in White Plaza. We spoke
at the very end of Pete Huyck's "open
forum" and we want to clarify our
remarks. We know Huyck wrote the let

ter signed by Scott Cook challenging him
self to appear in White Plaza for this
debate. Several of the "authors" of letters
regarding Huyck live in his fraternity
house. Coincidence? We think not. Many
of the letters printed in The Daily both in
favor and in opposition to Huyck were, in
fact, written by Huyck himself under
other students' names. We know one per
son who Huyck asked four times to sign a
letter Huyck had written himself.
At the "debate," we repeatedly tried to
speak at the open mike, but were not
allowed to do so, until Huyck's self-creat
ed publicity stunt was over and he had
left. Some of the people that spoke both
for and against Huyck were plants (some
more obvious than others). We feel this
was a blatant mockery and insult to the
people who expressed heartfelt opinions in
what they thought was a serious forum
for discussion. Whether Huyck's inten
tions were to provide humor and enter
tainment, to offend people and create con
troversy or to seriously simulate multicul
tural discourse, we wish he would have
done so in an honest and upfront manner.
Open debates and letters to the editor
are important vehicles of expression for
members of the Stanford community.
This space should be used for more impor

tant issues than one person's continuous
attempts to keep himself in the spotlight.
