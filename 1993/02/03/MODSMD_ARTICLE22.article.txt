# Summer storage does not increase insurance
## 
### 
The Jan. 21 issue of the Daily quoted
ASSU senator Stacey Strong as follows:
"The problem the University sees with stor
age is that its a fire hazard. This hazard
poses an increased insurance risk and the
fire marshal is coming down really hard."
No one has conferred with the Insur
ance/Risk Management office or the Stan
ford Fire Marshal concerning the issue.
The storage does not pose an increased
insurance risk. The Stanford Fire Mar
shal has not expressed any concern about
bona fide storage areas.
It appears the problem applies to bud
get cuts or perhaps other concerns.
Please don't blame the problem on insur
ance, or for fire hazard reasons. Those
concerns do not exist.
