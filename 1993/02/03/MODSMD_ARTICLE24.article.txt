## Scouting out new trails 
### 
A TAN STICK-SHIFT '77 Interna
tional Scout. I never really missed
having a car at college. But when I
was offered the Scout, I suddenly discov
ered that I couldn't go without wheels
any longer.
I've since learned to always go with my
first instinct, and go without.
My dad bequeathed the dust-colored
1970s version of a "multi-purpose vehi
cle" to me over the summer. Said that it
was about time that I had a car up at
school. I suggested that it was about time
that I owned a car not previously owned
by him. He laughed. I told him I wasn't
joking. He still laughed.
So I washed and waxed the Beige
Behemoth. I felt better. Then I washed
and waxed the Scout. As the light brown
gleamed at me like a fifth-grader who has
just beaten the 49ers in Super Tecmo
Bowl, I was utterly convinced that the
Scout looked and ran better than I had
thought. My dad continued to laugh.
I drove the Scout up to Stanford. No
problem. The 13 miles-per-gallon both
ered my wallet a bit, but hey, I had a car.
And a car with character. Yeah, character.
And it had really good windshield wipers.
It was only a trip or two to Chili's, and
maybe a late-night Safeway run later
when the problems started. Even good
windshield wipers won't get you very far
before you start having some troubles.
I first learned that something might

be wrong when I couldn't shift gears. So
I took it to Terry at the Shell station.
Terry and I are already pretty good
friends at this point. See, Terry had given
my Scout a new water pump and carbu
retor. I had given Terry enough for a
down payment on his kid's braces.
But the Scout decided that it wasn't
giving me enough problems for an ordi
nary 15-year-old, especially one with
125,000 miles on it. So it decided to lose its
clutch somewhere on El Camino. Terry
told me that it would cost me another set
of braces to be able to shift gears. I told
him straight teeth were overrated.
When break came, my mission was set
before me: drive home to San Diego with
no clutch. I'm still convinced it can be
done. It just takes the proper amount of
timing and strength. So I brought my
friend Aaron with me.
After we began our adventure, it was dis
covered rather inadvertently that once the
Scout was started, it couldn't be stopped. It
couldn't even idle. But our intentions for a
non-stop trip soon ran afoul.
Somewhere past a place called Nipo
mo, Aaron told me that he had to go to
the bathroom. I explained that we
couldn't stop, and gestured to an empty
Prestone bottle in the back. He respond
ed that he really had to go. The big stuff.
So I slowed down as much as I could,
and Aaron jumped out. He sprinted
ahead in a slightly bow-legged gait, and

disappeared behind a tree. I kept my
speed as low as possible, but before long I
was passing the tree. Then I was 50 yards
past the tree. Then 100 yards past.
Suddenly, Aaron emerged at a full
sprint, looking a little more upright. He
eventually caught up and we were off again.
For at least another half-hour. That
fellow Murphy sure did have something
there.
It took a total of three-and-a-half days,
45 gallons of gas, a nice police officer with
a pretty yellow ticket, about 10 jump
starts, a guy named Jim, some L.A. traf
fic, a Denny's combo and a 35 foot motor
home, but eventually the Scout, along
with Aaron and I, got home.
At which point I bequeathed it back to
my dad..
Strange, I only discovered that I need
ed a car when someone marvelled at the
fact that I was a senior and still rode my
bike into Palo Alto. Now I marvel at how
I survived with it.
"Funny," my dad said. "I never had
any problems with the Scout."
Yeah. Friggin' hilarious.
