## Anarchy in the U.S.A.: a tale of latent rebellion 
### 
I'M THINKING OF GETTING MY
NIPPLES pierced.
My mom always said I had great nip
ples. And you can't believe in anything,
if not your mom's fair, unbiased judge
ment.
I was considering getting a ring of
nubile baby seals — each balancing a
Suicidal Tendencies CD on its nose —
tatooed in a circle around my breasts,
but I figured it'd wreak havoc on future
stretchmarks.
I think I'll get it in my left nipple, for
better traction.
It's my own personal quarter-life cri
sis. I'm old, washed up. Before long I'll
be wearing Dockers and sweaters that
pull over my butt. I feel a Geritol attack
coming on. I'm even acquiring a taste
for orange-flavored Metamucil.
Pass the Ben-Gay.
I never got to be a kid. I never got to
fall out of a tree and break my arm. I
never got to have sex on my parents'
bed when they were at the Swap Meet. I
never got to blow up an administrator's
office at my high school.
OK, so I had big hair, but that
doesn't count.
I was like most Stanford students as
a kid. A few parties here, buttloads of

sports practices there. And a few million
hours in a classroom taught by some
balding, female, single-celled amoeba
with a degree from DeVry, learning
more on how to get sexual favors by
cheating on world history tests than
about Bangladesh.
But I never inhaled.
OK, maybe once.
I lived a typical middle-class L.A.
existence. My dad and I spent time on
the weekends going to the mall to buy
the latest midriff.
I fondly remember gridlock, and the
quality time I had with Dad, trying to
convince him of the angst and unbridled
emotion in the lyrics and video of Pat
Benetar's "Love is a Battlefield."
He tried to relate.
I wore too much makeup, talked on
the phone to people with a lower stand
ing on the food chain and sniffed nail
polish remover.
But I was not a disillusioned youth. I
wash not tortured by the transition
period. I didn't even hit puberty until
last year. Zits . . . yeah, I had 'em. So
what. You did too.
But I didn't get to be a punk.
I listened to Top-40 and hip-hop. I
watched Brat Pack movies. I guess it
never occurred me to subvert any domi

nant diaphragm or anything, so I just
skimmed along with my pathetic exis
tence.
The shame.
My parents didn't even try to despot
ically control me. Sure, I had to cut
down large trees in the forest in the
back yard, strap them to my back, walk
them up to Oregon and plant new
seedlings in their place to protect the
environment.
But none of that fighting-over-the
car stuff. No curfew infringements. No
bodily harm.
My mom gave me the Pepsi.
Sigh. What's a womyn to do.
But I'm taking it all back now, baby.
I'm doing the carpe diem, thing, o' cap
tain. Above the rim. Be all you can be.
Just do it. Nothin' but net. Learn how
to be a model or just look like one.
I'm gonna be the best hoodlum the
world has ever seen.
So now, with the whole grunge thing,
I'm getting my last chance for glory. I'll
shave my head. I'll shave my eyebrows
off. I'll shave my butt.
Nah, too cliche.
I went out over Winter Break and
bought some of those Soho big, black
shoes you steal from an old lady waiting
for a bus on El Camino. Ronald McDon

ald shoes in their most stylish form.
Am I "killer" yet?
And, for the first time in my life, I got
some hand-me-downs from my dad.
Some old suit pants from the '70s, ripe
for cutting off.
Somehow the blue-tinted black
seems like a rebellious, piss-in-your
face kind of color. Someone asked me if
I stole them from a postman.
Milkman, silly. Mom says milkman.
I've got industrial-strength crosses
hanging from my neck, off-white tights
with white socks and the mandatory
dejected-youth T-shirt calling for the
annihilation of the world.
And I love the remake of Led Zep
pelin's "Battle of Evermore" on the Sin
gles album. Love it.
Love Matt Dillon too. This weekend
I'm going shopping, to get myself a sen
sitive ponytail man.

Next year I'm drawing into EBF and
hanging out naked all the time. Or with
a plaid shirt with a hood on. Or just me,
tan lines and some Doc Martens.
I've got to bolster my film repertoire,
too. None of this feel-good stuff. I want
horror. Twisted, demented views of the
world, shocking me out of my serene
existence. Warp me.
I want Crispen Glover to be my best
friend.
A real friend.
I've got the neon-green, pasty-white
thing down pat, though. Waking up
with icicles on my my eyelashes has also
contributed to give me that I-don't
care-if-"Seventeen"-says-tan-is-in skin
color, of a true punk-rock girl. With
bruises.
I'm ready. I've done the normal
thing. I've been taken home to the par
ents. They still didn't like me.
So I'm throwing it all away. Black
eyeliner, platform shoes, body odor, the
works. It's my turn, and I'm going all
out.
Baby, I smell like Teen Spirit.
