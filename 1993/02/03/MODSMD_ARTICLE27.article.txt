## A 						brave new world of computer chip manufacturing 
### Jim Morris 
Although the next generation
of computer chips can be devel
oped for $100 million, the con
struction of a manufacturing
facility to mass produce such
innovations will cost nearly $1
billion, say researchers.
But at Stanford's Center for
Integrated Systems, a inter-disci
plinary team of scientists led by
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Krishna Saraswat is attempting
to circumvent the enormous cost
of producing the next generation
of integrated circuits (ICs) by re
evaluating the process used in
industry today.
As computers begin to infil
trate everyday life from super
markets to cars to defense
machinery, whoever controls the
fundamental parts of these
machines dictates their advance
ment and availability. The most
important and defining part of a
computer is its microprocessor,
an IC that determines the speed
and ability of the computer.
Saraswat and Graduate School
of Business Prof. Samuel Wood,
who holds a Ph. Din electrical
engineering, propose that by
combining various operations
into one Rapid Thermal Multi
processor (RTM), they can manu
facture ICs with two-thirds less
equipment.
Each of these machines will be
computer controlled, monitored
and repaired with real-time algo
rithms operating on work sta
tions integrated into the RTM
itself.
According to Saraswat and
Wood, this integration as well as
state-of-the-art computer control
and diagnostics will provide
greater efficiency and adaptabili
ty than standard IC manufactur
ing methods. Current mass pro
duction techniques, which use
the idea of trial and error
improvement, cannot efficiently
mass produce different types of
ICs.
The RTM is at the heart of a
new idea in manufacturing —
Adaptable Manufacturing Sys
tems (AMS). It has many advan
tages over the conventional Mass

Manufacturing Systems (MMS).
The differences between AMS
and MMS can be described by
looking at the differences
between Japanese and American
automobile manufacturers,
Saraswat said.
While Toyota developed the
idea of an adaptable environment
to produce its cars, General
Motors built for factories that
were less adaptable and geared
towards the production of only
one model. In the semiconductor
industry, however, the roles have
been switched. The Japanese cur
rently uses MMS technology that
is consistent with producing one
item in mass quantities while
Americans are concentrating on
changeability in the AMS factory.
This adaptability will be inte
gral to a future market which will
demand lower quantities of more
varied chip designs. The RTM's
flexibility will produce different
designs and different technolo
gies without having to change
costly machinery, Saraswat said.
He added that the change is
accomplished by simply modify
ing the computer that controls
the process.
The major problem with
putting more than $1 billion into
a MMS factory is that the ICs the
factory makes could be out-of
date in just a few years. This
problem is solved by the AMS fac
tory that can change with the
technology.
Currently, Semiconductor
Research Corporation, Texas
Instruments, and the Department
of Defense are funding the AMS
factory concept.
And at Stanford, an economic
simulator called SCOPE (Stan
ford Cost of Operations and Per
formance Evaluator) will be able
to measure the efficiency of such
factories even before they start to
produce ICs. A series of simula
tions and tests will be the precur
sor to any product made at the
new factory in order to determine
its efficiency.
According to Barbara Hayes-
Roth and Janet Murdock,
researchers in the Knowledge
Systems Laboratory, each RTM
will perform three major func

tions in chip-making: photolithog
raphy, oxidation and etching.
Lithography is the process
where UV light shines through a
sapphire window onto a wafer.
The wafer is composed of a silicon
derivative and is the square board
on which transistors are added.
Then oxidizing gases are flowed
into the system and oxidation
occurs on the wafer. Injected plas
mas produce the etching.
An RTM accepts the wafer and
lays down on it miniscule layers
of silicon nitride, oxide, boron,
phosphorus and other chemicals
through exposing the wafer to
gases. This process lays down an
intricate pattern of millions of
transistors that eventually
become an IC that runs a com
puter.
The process of laying down the
chemicals on the wafer will be

monitored by computers in the
AMS factory, which makes the
process more efficient. Each RTM
will have its own advanced com
puter system that controls the gas
and plasma flow into the process
ing chamber as well as the cham
ber's temperature, pressure and
heat transfer within.
The RTM is continuously sens
ing and regulating the tempera
ture of the wafer. This is impor
tant because the temperature of
the wafer determines the thick
ness of the chemicals, which need
to be as uniform as possible.
These sensors are being devel
oped by Electrical Engineering
Prof. Pierre Khuri-Yakub. When
the wafer is in the RTM, it rests
upon three prongs that stabilize it
in the vacuum environment of the
chamber. Khuri-Yakub has pro
posed that instead of using the

wafer's emissivity (energy emit
ted per degree Celsius) and wave
length emission to determine
temperature, one should use the
acoustics of the wafer.
Sending a vibration through
the wafer from one prong to the
next is a much more reliable way
of determining the temperature
of the wafer, according to Khuri-
Yakub.
"The speed of sound in the
wafer has a one-to-one relation
ship to its temperature," he said.
"Knowing the distance between
prongs and the time the vibration
takes to transverse that distance,
I can determine the speed of the
sound. Thus the temperature of
the wafer is known."
Presently, this process can
determine the temperature of the
wafer at 1,000 degrees Celsius,
plus or minus five degrees.

In addition to a control system
which sets up the guidelines for
the computer to carry out the pro
cesses for making an IC, there will
be a diagnostic system in place to
detect any abnormalities.
Hayes-Roth and Murdock are
creating a unique system of diag
nostics. They have proposed a
form of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
to perform diagnostics on the
RTM.
The AI system will be able to
determine whether or not abnor
malities exist, Hayes-Roth said.
The computer, by direction of
the AI programming, would be
able to correct problems on the
basis of its findings — all without
explicit human supervision.
Hayes-Roth said the researchers
are making progress, though the
AI diagnostics idea is still quite
hypothetical.

wafer's emissivity (energy emit
ted per degree Celsius) and wave
length emission to determine
temperature, one should use the
acoustics of the wafer.
Sending a vibration through
the wafer from one prong to the
next is a much more reliable way
of determining the temperature
of the wafer, according to Khuri-
Yakub.
"The speed of sound in the
wafer has a one-to-one relation
ship to its temperature," he said.
"Knowing the distance between
prongs and the time the vibration
takes to transverse that distance,
I can determine the speed of the
sound. Thus the temperature of
the wafer is known."
Presently, this process can
determine the temperature of the
wafer at 1,000 degrees Celsius,
plus or minus five degrees.

In addition to a control system
which sets up the guidelines for
the computer to carry out the pro
cesses for making an IC, there will
be a diagnostic system in place to
detect any abnormalities.
Hayes-Roth and Murdock are
creating a unique system of diag
nostics. They have proposed a
form of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
to perform diagnostics on the
RTM.
The AI system will be able to
determine whether or not abnor
malities exist, Hayes-Roth said.
The computer, by direction of
the AI programming, would be
able to correct problems on the
basis of its findings — all without
explicit human supervision.
Hayes-Roth said the researchers
are making progress, though the
AI diagnostics idea is still quite
hypothetical.

Although the next generation
of computer chips can be devel
oped for $100 million, the con
struction of a manufacturing
facility to mass produce such
innovations will cost nearly $1
billion, say researchers.
But at Stanford's Center for
Integrated Systems, a inter-disci
plinary team of scientists led by
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Krishna Saraswat is attempting
to circumvent the enormous cost
of producing the next generation
of integrated circuits (ICs) by re
evaluating the process used in
industry today.
As computers begin to infil
trate everyday life from super
markets to cars to defense
machinery, whoever controls the
fundamental parts of these
machines dictates their advance
ment and availability. The most
important and defining part of a
computer is its microprocessor,
an IC that determines the speed
and ability of the computer.
Saraswat and Graduate School
of Business Prof. Samuel Wood,
who holds a Ph. Din electrical
engineering, propose that by
combining various operations
into one Rapid Thermal Multi
processor (RTM), they can manu
facture ICs with two-thirds less
equipment.
Each of these machines will be
computer controlled, monitored
and repaired with real-time algo
rithms operating on work sta
tions integrated into the RTM
itself.
According to Saraswat and
Wood, this integration as well as
state-of-the-art computer control
and diagnostics will provide
greater efficiency and adaptabili
ty than standard IC manufactur
ing methods. Current mass pro
duction techniques, which use
the idea of trial and error
improvement, cannot efficiently
mass produce different types of
ICs.
The RTM is at the heart of a
new idea in manufacturing —
Adaptable Manufacturing Sys
tems (AMS). It has many advan
tages over the conventional Mass

Manufacturing Systems (MMS).
The differences between AMS
and MMS can be described by
looking at the differences
between Japanese and American
automobile manufacturers,
Saraswat said.
While Toyota developed the
idea of an adaptable environment
to produce its cars, General
Motors built for factories that
were less adaptable and geared
towards the production of only
one model. In the semiconductor
industry, however, the roles have
been switched. The Japanese cur
rently uses MMS technology that
is consistent with producing one
item in mass quantities while
Americans are concentrating on
changeability in the AMS factory.
This adaptability will be inte
gral to a future market which will
demand lower quantities of more
varied chip designs. The RTM's
flexibility will produce different
designs and different technolo
gies without having to change
costly machinery, Saraswat said.
He added that the change is
accomplished by simply modify
ing the computer that controls
the process.
The major problem with
putting more than $1 billion into
a MMS factory is that the ICs the
factory makes could be out-of
date in just a few years. This
problem is solved by the AMS fac
tory that can change with the
technology.
Currently, Semiconductor
Research Corporation, Texas
Instruments, and the Department
of Defense are funding the AMS
factory concept.
And at Stanford, an economic
simulator called SCOPE (Stan
ford Cost of Operations and Per
formance Evaluator) will be able
to measure the efficiency of such
factories even before they start to
produce ICs. A series of simula
tions and tests will be the precur
sor to any product made at the
new factory in order to determine
its efficiency.
According to Barbara Hayes-
Roth and Janet Murdock,
researchers in the Knowledge
Systems Laboratory, each RTM
will perform three major func

tions in chip-making: photolithog
raphy, oxidation and etching.
Lithography is the process
where UV light shines through a
sapphire window onto a wafer.
The wafer is composed of a silicon
derivative and is the square board
on which transistors are added.
Then oxidizing gases are flowed
into the system and oxidation
occurs on the wafer. Injected plas
mas produce the etching.
An RTM accepts the wafer and
lays down on it miniscule layers
of silicon nitride, oxide, boron,
phosphorus and other chemicals
through exposing the wafer to
gases. This process lays down an
intricate pattern of millions of
transistors that eventually
become an IC that runs a com
puter.
The process of laying down the
chemicals on the wafer will be

monitored by computers in the
AMS factory, which makes the
process more efficient. Each RTM
will have its own advanced com
puter system that controls the gas
and plasma flow into the process
ing chamber as well as the cham
ber's temperature, pressure and
heat transfer within.
The RTM is continuously sens
ing and regulating the tempera
ture of the wafer. This is impor
tant because the temperature of
the wafer determines the thick
ness of the chemicals, which need
to be as uniform as possible.
These sensors are being devel
oped by Electrical Engineering
Prof. Pierre Khuri-Yakub. When
the wafer is in the RTM, it rests
upon three prongs that stabilize it
in the vacuum environment of the
chamber. Khuri-Yakub has pro
posed that instead of using the

wafer's emissivity (energy emit
ted per degree Celsius) and wave
length emission to determine
temperature, one should use the
acoustics of the wafer.
Sending a vibration through
the wafer from one prong to the
