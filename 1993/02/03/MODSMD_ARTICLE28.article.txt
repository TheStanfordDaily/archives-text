# Bug brushes up on decay of toothpaste

Q, Why does toothpaste have an
expiration date?
— Sally Haskouec
a : This question intrigued me
x\for a couple of reasons. It's my
first foray into the wild world of
consumer protection, a field
which I find kind of romantic.
Charging forward to serve the
interests of my readers' health —
and, more importantly in this
image-oriented culture, their
teeth — what a thrill.
Ralph Nader, step aside. The
Science Bug is here.
Furthermore, after scrutiniz
ing the list of ingredients on the
box which once contained my cur
rent tube of toothpaste, I realized
that there is no obvious scientific
reason for one to expect that
toothpaste would expire at all.
(Incidentally, although I'm
sure that both of my fans are
foaming at the mouth — heh — to
emulate my life right down to the
brand of dental care products I

use, the company didn't pay me
near enough to plug them in my
column.)
A quick trip down to Tresidder
Express™ revealed another suspi
cious detail — namely, that not all
toothpastes have expiration dates
printed on the box.
"What's going on?" I wondered
aloud.
"Not much, man," answered
the checkout guy with the long
hair and Megadeth T-shirt.
I retreated outside to ponder
the implications of my discovery.
After all, what's so different about
Colgate and Crest that the former
expires and the latter does not? Is

Crest hiding something? Is Col
gate attempting to dupe us into a
feeling of urgency — brush now,
for tomorrow it may be too late?
I soon realized that no amount
of guesswork would suffice as
adequately as a trip to the prover
bial horse's mouth, and called the
companies' toll-free numbers. I
didn't expect to get anything but
propaganda, but after spending
someone's $80,000 on almost four
years at Stanford, I assumed that
my finely trained mind would be
able to sort through the hype and
assemble The Big Picture.
It turns out that a lot of stuff
goes into a tube of toothpaste, and
the operators at both customer
service centers were most ade
quately scripted on the function
of each ingredient.
Hydrated silica acts as an abra
sive, sorbitol retains the mois
ture, glycerine and cellulose con
tribute to the consistency, and
sodium lauryl sulfate gives it that
mad-dog-in-heat foaming action.
Fluoride, as we all know, kills the
little germs that would otherwise
wreak havoc on our dentition.
On the subject of spoilage,

however, I got a much more mud
dled story. Crest's representative
(whose product, remember, has
no expiration date) assured me
that even if over years of shelf
life, a flavor or color change
occurred, their paste would never
lose its effectiveness or become
dangerous to the user.
Colgate, on the other hand,
had the audacity to claim that
over the course of a year or so, the
fluoride in their toothpaste
breaks down, changing the flavor
and decreasing the "efficiency" of
the dentifrice.
Listen, gang: sodium fluoride,
NaF, is no more chemically com
plicated than table salt. It just
can't do that much in the way of
breaking down. Sure, it dissoci
ates into sodium cation, Na+, and
fluoride anion, Fl-, but it's sup
posed to. Unless you use radioac
tive isotopes of the two elements
(unquestionably a bad idea with
personal hygiene products), sodi
um fluoride is pretty much with
you for life.
Verdict? Colgate's customer
