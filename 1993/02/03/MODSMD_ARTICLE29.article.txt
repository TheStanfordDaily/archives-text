# Shaman may teach Western docs
## Third World medicine is important, not all witchcraft, lecturer says 
### 
Arguing that Western scientists have much to
learn from the medicinal and conservationist
gractices of indigenous peoples, Paul Cox of
irigham Young University told a Stanford
audience last month "shamans are scientists."
According to Cox, native medicine may also be
the key to both the economic survival of
indigenous people and the environmental sur
vival of the rainforest.
Because many Western scientists believe
that Western medicine is superior, the validi
ty of native medical systems is often over
looked, said Cox, from BYU's department of
Botany and Range Sciences.
Lecturing as part of the Morrison Institute
for Population and Resource Studies' Winter
Colloquium, Cox said indigenous knowledge
can contribute to Western medicine. For
example, in Samoa, herbalists — who are all
women — gather over 100 species of plants,
freshly prepare medicine from specific parts of
the plants, and administer the medicine oral
ly, to the skin or as vapor.
The women apprentice with their mothers

and adopt their patients until they are well,
often walking many miles a day to make home
visits. Unlike Western doctors, herbalists do
not receive payment or special cultural
respect. Cox calls Samoan ethnomedicine (a
particular culture's medical system) a scien
tific paradigm — the result of systematizing
observations about the world, producing theo
ries, and making predictions based on the the
ories.
Cox and his colleagues screened many
Samoan medicinal plants for pharmacological
activity and found a high degree of activity.
One plant, Homalanthus nutans contains
prostratin, a compound that in laboratory
tests has inhibited the viral reproduction of
HIV-1 and protected cells against invasion.
The National Cancer Institute has selected
prostratin as one of three major drugs to test
in vitro and then clinically for HIV treatment.
"Our science vindicates indigenous eth
nomedicine," said Cox. Declaring "eco-colo
nialism" — the imposition of western solu
tions on indigenous peoples is as damaging
to cultures as colonialism, Cox warned against
Western science's "unwillingness to consider
the validity of indigenous paradigms from the

inside out."
Cox admitted that as he studies how
Samoans understand the he struggles
with his own cultural overlays. As a Western
er, he is "looking for useful native medicinal
plants to alleviate our suffering."
Finding those useful plants could bring
needed money to indigenous peoples. Cox
explained how Samoans, with the help of out
side money, are currently using their strong
conservation ethic to protect their rainforest.
In 1988, Falealupo, a village in Western
Samoa, was about to log their rainforest to
raise money to construct a needed school. Cox
assumed the $65,000 debt, the villagers
stopped the loggers, and private donors —
including two herbal pharmaceutical compa
nies — reimbursed Cox.
The subsequent creation of the Falealupo
Rainforest Reserve was novel in many
respects. In a traditional native ceremony, the
donors signed a covenant relinquishing any
rights to the land and agreeing to fund con
struction of the school.
The villagers agreed to continue their 2,000
