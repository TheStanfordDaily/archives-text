# Pro Fro Week gets a theme: 'As you like it'
##

If shining academics, pov/erhouse sports and
sunny weather don't lure the prospective class of
1997 to Stanford, perhaps a new theme for Pro Fro
Week will.
With plans for Prospective Freshman Week al
ready under way, this year's directors have chris
tened the week, "As you like it. . . Stanford style,"
adding a new twist to the previously theme-less year
ly event.
"Maybe it's not the best, but we're happy with it,"
said sophomore Nik Kolodny, programming director
of Pro Fro Week, held April 19-26.
"We had thought about using 'Shades of Stan
ford' as a theme, but we felt even aside from the
Shakespeare allusion, this theme more accurately
gives the feeling that Stanford has everything for
you â€” it's all here for the taking; you just have to
want it."
While the Pro Fro committee has decided on a
theme, it has yet to finalize the schedule of social
events. However, organizers have already asked fra
ternities not to admit Pro Fros to their parties,
Kolodny said.
"All Pro Fro Week is dry; we just can't deal with
the liability," he said. "Hopefully, the Pro Fros can
get acquainted with Greek life by some panel discus
sions or barbecues with the frats."
Kolodny said the committee also hopes to liven up
the formerly exclusive Pro Fro party by opening it up
to the whole campus. The party will still be dry, he
said, "but it should be good."
In addition, the Exotic Erotic, Alpha Sigma's an
nual skin-fest, which usually coincides with Pro Fro
Week, might not occur at all this year. Alpha Sig is
currently waiting for the University to conclude its
investigation of hazing charges.
But Dirk Pranke, a former Alpha Sig house man
ager who organized last year's Exotic Erotic, said, "if
the University lets us, if it's at all
possible, we will throw it again."
As for academic programming,
it is likely that the annual Mtyors
Event, designed to introduce both
current and prospective students
to a wide range of academic fields,
will not be held this year because
of budget cuts at the Undergrad
uate Advising Center.
"We're very disappointed
about the Majors Event, but we
just can't foot the $3,000" cost of
the event, Kolodny said.
Kolodny said the Pro Fro
Week committee is organizing an
Opportunities Fair to expose Pro
Fros to many different campus
groups. He said he hopes individ
ual organizations will hold open
houses.
In addition to the fair, Pro
Fros will be able to attend UAC
seminars, drop-in advising and
financial aid seminars as well as
Overseas Studies and Undergrad
uate Research Opportunities
receptions.
