# Hot info about colds

### 
A sniffling friend told me
recently that she was going to con
quer her cold â€” she had just spent
$30.00 on "cold medicine" at Safe
way. What she bought mostly was
orange juice. Thirty dollars! I
winced. If only she had gone to
C0we11....
"Cowell! Cowell for a cold? And
be forced to fill out a form with five
zillion questions while you sit in
the lobby for 45 minutes?" you
snort contemptously.
However, free drugs, solid medi
cal advice, and yes, even Kleenex
are available to students and staff
at the reopened "Cold Clinic,"
located in the new Health Library
on the second floor of Cowell. Its
purpose, no pun intended, is to
remove some of the congestion
brought to the regular Cowell clin
ic by students with colds.
When students go to Cowell,
they are screened by a nurse who
examines their temperature, blood
pressure and symptoms. Based on
their evaluation, they will either
see a doctor or be sent on up to the
Cold Clinic.
The Cold Clinic offers free sam
ples of non-prescription cold
medicines, including deconges
tants, antihistamines and throat
lozenges. Medics provide a ton of
literature that will tell you all that
you ever wanted to know about
colds and they'll even give you hot
tea.
But for those of you still reluc
tant, or perhaps too sick to get out
of bed to visit Cowell, here's anoth
er chance to help you win your bat
tle against a cold.
What is a cold?
Despite its name, a cold has a lot
more to do with viruses and infec
tion than it does with the weather.
Colds are infections caused by

viruses that invade the body's cells,
triggering an immune response,
causing temporary havoc inside the
body, which you experience in the
form of typical cold symptoms.
To make matters worse, there
are believed to be about 150 differ
ent types of cold viruses. Although
the body develops immunity to
some, it's not equipped to handle
most of these infections. Therefore,
cold remedies come into play.
According to Dr. John Dorman,
staff physician at Cowell, the most
common cold symptoms are conges
tion, runny nose, headaches and a
cough. With proper medications,
rest and hydration, these symp
toms can be alleviated within a few
days.
Cold remedies
Decongestants are often recom
mended for those who are feeling
stuffy. They help to relieve conges
tion due to swollen mucus mem
branes.
Dorman said nose drops, like
Afrin, are highly effective. Howev
er, he cautions against using nose
drops for more than a few days to
prevent a "rebound effect," in
which the drug's effect wears off
and the mucus membranes swell
even more than before.
All decongestants, including
Sudafed, are "uppers." As a result,
side-effects include a rapid heart
rate, over-alertness and the jitters.
Combatting the stimulation
caused by decongestants is one of
the benefits of another medication
for cold patients known as antihis
tamines.
According to Dorman, antihis
tamines are most effective for
those with allergies. However,
since antihistamines have the
opposite effect of decongestants,
which cause drowsiness, they are

often combined with deconges
tants to minimize side-effects.
Some brand name antihistamines
are Dimetapp, Drixoral, and
Benadryl. Actifed is a combination
medication containing a deconges
tant, Sudafed, and antihistamines.
However, some medications can
often offer too powerful a punch.
Medications in combination might
not be best for you. For example,
Alka-Selzer Cold Plus medicine or
CoAdvil are drugs that combine
decongestants, antihistamines and
aspirin. Such combinations, Dor
man says, give the body more med
ication than it really needs.

Aspirin, while helpful for pain
and fever, is generally not a good
remedy for cold symptoms. Accord
ing to Dorman, people should take
aspirin substitutes. These include
acetaminophen and ibuprofen, bet
ter known as Tylenol and Advil,
respectively.
Another highly irritating symp
tom of a cold is a cough. Cough
suppressants, like Robitussin and
Delsym, work to decrease the
cough reflex, making one drowsy
in the process.
In some cases you do not want
to suppress the cough reflex
because it functions to clear the
lungs of congestion and phlegm.
But if your coughing persists for
over a week or is associated with
colored sputum, it might indicate a
more serious illness such as bron

chitis or pneumonia.
In addition to decongestants,
analgesics and cough suppressants,
one of the most effective remedies
for the common cold, yes, is a bowl
of chicken soup. Well, not actually
the soup itself, but fluids in general
are important for loosening secre
tions in the nasal passages and
replenishing the liquids lost because
of runny noses and sneezing.
Symptoms not due to a cold are
temperatures over 101 degrees,
severe sinus pain, sharp ear pains,
severely swollen glands or wheez
ing that results from breathing
deeply. These symptoms indicate
other problems and should be
brought to a physicians attention.
