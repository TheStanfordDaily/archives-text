## Another 'day in park' for women's netters Cardinal 'bagels' Bulldogs with shuffled lineup 
### Mike McDonough Staff Writer 
Just remember, folks: Fresno State is
no Florida.
The Stanford women's tennis team
made that fact abundantly clear yesterday
afternoon at Stanford Tennis Stadium,
barely working up a sweat against the
Bulldogs, who bore no resemblance to the
No. 1 Gators, in a 9-0 victory.

'It's important for us to play
and compete in every match.'
— Frank Brennan

The Cardinal went with a new lineup
against Fresno State, filling in the spots
vacated by junior Laxmi Poruri, senior
captain Heather Willens and freshman
Beth Berris, who are travelling to Min
neapolis for a tournament later this week.
As a result, sophomore Kim Shasby
filled in at the No. 1 singles position for
Stanford and won handily over Fresno
State's Amy Gallagher, 6-0, 6-3. Shasby,
normally Stanford's No. 3 player, rose to
the occasion against Gallagher, who her
self is usually the Bulldogs' No. 2 player.
"Having their top player out of the line
up is tough," said Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan. "Kim hits the ball so
hard, they're not used to it. It's like a guy
playing a girl."
Junior Kristine Kurth, playing in the No.
2 match, also disposed of her opponent, Vicki
Potter, 6-0,6-4. "She's serving very well, and
I think they had problems with that," Bren
nan said. "The other girl hit some good balls
over, but she couldn't keep it up."
In the No. 3 match, sophomore Amy
Chiminello downed the Bulldogs' Kristy
Smith, 6-2, 6-2, while junior Emma Wood
house won her first dual match of the year
in the No. 4 spot with a 6-4, 6-1 victory
over Ann Papi.

"She's playing well," Brennan said of
Woodhouse. "We were happy to see her
come out so strong in her first match here."
Freshmen provided strong perfor
mances in the last two singles spots. No. 5
Wendy Sacks overwhelmed Patricia
Marosova, 6-1, 6-1, while No. 6 Sonya
Cotero topped Gina Serrano, 6-3, 6-1, in
her first regular-season singles appear
ance for the Cardinal.
"Sonya beat a nice player in straight
sets," Brennan said. "She's a player we
haven't seen a whole lot of, so seeing her
do well was gratifying."
Stanford also swept Fresno State in
doubles play, posting straight-set wins at
each position. The No. 1 team of Berris
and Kurth defeated Fresno State's Fallara
and Gallagher, 6-1, 6-3, while the No. 2
team of Shasby and Chiminello overcame
Potter and Papi, 6-1,6-1. Cotero and Sacks
rounded out the sweep for the Cardinal in
the No. 3 match, beating Smith and Serra
no, 6-2, 6-3.
According to Brennan, Fresno State
found itself outmatched and unable to keep
up with Stanford's players shot for shot.
"In a match like this, what you're afraid
of more than anything is that you'll lose
your concentration, or play sloppily,"
Brennan said. "It's important for us to
play and compete in every match."
Tomorrow, Poruri, Willens, Berris and
Kurth will travel to the Rolex National
Indoor Championships, which run Thurs
day through Sunday. Though most of the
players are rested and ready, Berris is
somewhat of a question mark.
"I'm a little bit worried about her — she
has a slight leg problem," Brennan said.
"We're hoping she can — literally and fig
uratively — limp through Minneapolis."
Despite Berris' problems, however,
Brennan is confident that his best players
are ready for the competition.
"I think it'll be interesting," Brennan
said. "Kim's proven that she's a good player
and a good indoor player, and they're all
playing very well right now. We really have
more than one player capable of winning it."
