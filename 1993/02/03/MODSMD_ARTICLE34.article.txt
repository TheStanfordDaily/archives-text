# Men hit road, face toughest Pac-10 test
## 
### David Schwartz Senior staff writer 
Fresh from two tough losses to
the Washington schools at home
last weekend, the last thing the
Stanford basketball team needs is
a trip to the home of the No. 8
team in the country.
Surprise! Guess what's in the
Stanford (6-13, 1-6 Pacific 10
Conference) travels to the desert to
take on Arizona (13-2, 7-0) tomor
row night and Arizona State (10-5,
4-3) on Saturday. These games are
hardly an easy task and, to make
matters worse, the injury bug has
struck the Cardinal once again.
Bart Lammersen, who moved
into the starting lineup just four
weeks ago to replace injured
starter Darren Allaway, sprained
his ankle in practice on Monday
and is questionable for the trip.
Coach Mike Montgomery will
move Todd Manley into the start
ing lineup alongside Jim Morgan,
but Manley is also not at full
strength. He has hyperextended
his knee twice in the last week. If
neither Allaway nor Lammersen
travel this weekend, Mont
gomery's first post player off the
bench will be Justin Armour.
"If you don't have somebody
that can stand in there in the
color, you're going to get killed on
the boards," Montgomery said.
Arizona has just the big men to
do it. 7-foot, 264-pound senior cen
ter Ed Stokes clogs the middle for
the Wildcats, and provides them
with high-percentage scoring
opportunities inside.
"He's not a scoring machine,
but he certainly will cause all
kinds of problems, because he's
big," Montgomery said. "That's
where they (the Wildcats) want to
get the ball."

Arizona has emerged as the
class of the Pac-10, having beaten
both UCLA and Oregon State on
the road. This is due in no small
part to senior forward Chris Mills,
who enters the contest averaging
19.2 points and 7.1 rebounds.
"He's the best all-around player
in the league," Montgomery said.
"He plays strong on the inside, he
cleans the glass and he guards
smaller players on the perimeter."
Besides Arizona's surplus of
talent, Stanford will have to con
tend with the atmosphere of
McKale Center, where the Wild
cats have lost only two games
since the 1987-88 season.
"The crowd is very into it,"
Montgomery said. "It is an intimi
dating place to play. They like to
win at home, and to win by big
margins."
Coach Bill Frieder has his Ari
zona State squad in a five-way
deadlock for third place in the con
ference by playing a small lineup
that creates matchup problems for
virtually every team in the league.
After 6-foot-9 sophomore forward
Mario Bennett went down with an
injury, Frieder decided to put his
five best athletes on the floor,
regardless of their size. As a result,
his tallest starter is 6-foot-6 Lester
Neal, and the Sun Devils rely on
the outside shooting of guards
Stevin Smith and Marcell Capers
while spreading the floor.
"They've done a remarkable
job," Montgomery said. "They put
four players on the perimeter to
shoot the three. Their lineup will
probably force us to go small to
match up defensively, but then
that will create problems for us in
running our offense."
Though Stanford has lost six
straight games, Montgomery
found encouragement in the Car
dinal's one-point loss to Washing

ton last Saturday.
"I am reasonably pleased with
that effort," Montgomery said.
"We're trying to come up with pos
itive things from a difficult situa
tion. Every day in practice, I have
to figure out what I can do to work

that day because I don't have the
same people because of injuries. A
win would be a nice, welcome
change at this point in time, but
it's getting to the point where
doing the best you can has to be
good enough."
