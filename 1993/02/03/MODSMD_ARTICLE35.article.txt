# Midterm musings and birthday wishes

### 
First, one last look at the
Super Bowl:
• That's it, NFL, the joke's over.
This NFC whupping the AFC
after two weeks of hype is getting
old. The only way to reassure fans
is to make sure Buffalo cannot go
next year. Pass a law. Pay off the
refs the next time they play the
Oilers. Anything, please . . .
• America has endured three ver
sions of the Amy Fisher story,
and three appearances by the
Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl.
Someone save our culture before
it's too late . . .
• One sportswriter put it best
when he quipped that halftime
entertainer Michael Jackson had
a better grip on his balls than the
Bills did . . .
• Bonehead of Super Bowl
XXVII: Leon Lett. Lett, a Dallas
defensive end, got his just
desserts in the fourth quarter of
the Super Bowl on Sunday. He
returned an interception 40
yards, tying a Super Bowl
record, but started celebrating
too early, holding out the ball for
all 103,000 at the Rose Bowl to
see. Well, Bills receiver Don
Beebe saw it too, and knocked
the ball out of Lett's hand right
before he reached the end zone.
Serves him right. . .
• The Bills have had as much
success at the Super Bowl as
Sports Illustrated's Paul (Dr.
Z) Zimmerman has had in pre
dicting it . . .
• The best thing by far about the
Super Bowl, if you're watching
on television, is the advertise
ments. Best ad: McDonald's'
Larry Bird-Michael Jordan
shootout was more entertaining
than the game itself. Runner-up:
Shaquille O'Neal's dunking
audition for the masters of the
post — Bill Russell, Wilt Cham
berlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
and Bill Walton. Making the
rookie clean up the glass after
his broken backboard, as the leg
ends looked on, was a nice way to
show respect for the elders . . .
• Most disappointing: Bud Bowl
V. What was the point of having
Bud Light stage a comeback a la
Buffalo vs. Houston after being
down 35-7, only to lose 35-31?
Weak . . .
Moving on . ..
• Question of the week: who does
less with more talent, UCLA's
Jim Harrick or California's Lou

Campanelli?
Harrick looked like he had just
won the national championship
after the Bruins barely eked out a
three-point win at home over a
mediocre Notre Dame team last
Sunday. This, on the one-week
anniversary of UCLA's worst loss
in Pauley Pavilion history, a 104-
82 fiasco to Campanelli's Cal
squad. Harrick did not secure one
prominent recruit in the early
signing period, and the boo birds

are out in Westwood . ~
Meanwhile, the Golden Bears
choked a 20-point lead over mighty
Washington State on Sunday and
lost. It seems clear that all anyone
has to do to beat Cal is run a set
offense. When Cal gets into a run
ning game, they're like a Kidd in a
candy store — they get everything
they want. But if the opposition
plays a deliberate halfcourt game
and minimizes transition opportu
nities, Cal's basketball team has as
much chance of being successful as
its football team does of ever seeing
the Axe again in the near future ...
• As if Amy Fisher wasn't enough, on
Friday, Feb. 12, NBC provides us
with "Mike Tyson: The Movie" ...
• Attention, Pete Huyck: One week
until the Sports Illustrated swim
suit issue...
• Think Bill Walsh, who already
has snared one of the top five
recruiting classes in the country,
will be helped in his recruiting by
being the only active coach in the
Professional Football Hall of Fame?
• Presents I want from the Athlet
ics Department for my birthday:
- some fast wide receivers for
Walsh's offense
- a "fab-five-esque" recruiting
class for Mike Montgomery and
the Stanford basketball team
- a weightlifting session with
Flag Boy.

David Schwartz is 21 years old
today. He will make quick use of his
new legality in order to drown his
sorrows following the Stanford-Ari
zona basketball game in Tucson
tomorrow night.
