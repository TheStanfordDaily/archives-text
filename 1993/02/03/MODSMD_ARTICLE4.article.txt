# Four Webb Ranch homes condemned
## New accomodations must be done by end of March, University says

Four homes at Webb Ranch
have been declared "unfit for
human occupancy" by San Mateo
County health officials, forcing
the immediate relocation of the
families that had occupied them.
In response, the University has
ordered Webb Ranch to finish
building new trailers for the fami
lies by March 31, or face a possible
review of its lease agreement.
Leonie Batkin, asset manager
for the Stanford Management
Company, said the ranch will be re
quired to follow a detailed timeline
outlining each phase of the project.
She also plans to visit the ranch
each week to ensure compliance.
Pacific Gas and Electric Com
pany shut off the gas to the four
families' homes in early Novem
ber, telling the Webbs the 30-year
old gas lines were unsafe. While
three of the homes used electric

floorboard heaters that provided
normal heat, a fourth family had
to make do with an electric space
heater, Batkin said.
In addition, the families had no
hot water for showers and most of
them had to do their cooking out
doors on three-foot-long Coleman
stoves.
Three of the families have al
ready moved in with relatives who
live in the area, while the fourth
will move to an apartment in Red
wood City within the next two
days, according to Reuben Serna,
a United Stanford Workers field
representative.
Eight families live year-round
on the 237-acre ranch, which is lo
cated on Stanford land just off of
Alpine Road near Interstate 280
and has been leased to the Webb
family since 1922.
