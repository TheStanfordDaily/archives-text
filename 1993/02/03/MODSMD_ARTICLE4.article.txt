# Four Webb Ranch homes condemned
## New accomodations must be done by end of March, University says 
### Peter Robison Senior staff writer 
Four homes at Webb Ranch
have been declared "unfit for
human occupancy" by San Mateo
County health officials, forcing
the immediate relocation of the
families that had occupied them.
In response, the University has
ordered Webb Ranch to finish
building new trailers for the fami
lies by March 31, or face a possible
review of its lease agreement.
Leonie Batkin, asset manager
for the Stanford Management
Company, said the ranch will be re
quired to follow a detailed timeline
outlining each phase of the project.
She also plans to visit the ranch
each week to ensure compliance.
Pacific Gas and Electric Com
pany shut off the gas to the four
families' homes in early Novem
ber, telling the Webbs the 30-year
old gas lines were unsafe. While
three of the homes used electric

floorboard heaters that provided
normal heat, a fourth family had
to make do with an electric space
heater, Batkin said.
In addition, the families had no
hot water for showers and most of
them had to do their cooking out
doors on three-foot-long Coleman
stoves.
Three of the families have al
ready moved in with relatives who
live in the area, while the fourth
will move to an apartment in Red
wood City within the next two
days, according to Reuben Serna,
a United Stanford Workers field
representative.
Eight families live year-round
on the 237-acre ranch, which is lo
cated on Stanford land just off of
Alpine Road near Interstate 280
and has been leased to the Webb
family since 1922.
The new trailers are actually old
Manzanita Park trailers, obtained
by the Webbs nearly two years ago
when the University offered them
to anyone who would pay the costs
to remove them.
Webb Ranch maintains that
it has worked as quickly as pos
sible to install them, but has
been delayed by complex build
ing regulations and the heavy
rains of the past two months;
the union claims the company
has stalled and should have
completed the new trailers
months ago.
Gary Webb, president of Webb
Ranch, did not return several
phone calls placed to his home
and office yesterday.
Serna said the Webbs now
seem "more than cooperative"
about finishing the trailers on
time and meeting the workers'
needs — especially since the Uni
versity and San Mateo County
health officials began placing
pressure on them.
"I guess it would be safe in say
ing that Webb Ranch is kind of

between a rock and a hard spot,"
he said.
Serna said the union expects
the Webbs to pay the full cost of
moving the families, including
rent for the family that will move
into an apartment; the extra costs
the other families' relatives may
incur; and the cost of storing the
families' personal belongings
until they move into the new
trailers.
The union has already received
a verbal agreement from the
Webbs to pay for storage, and
anticipates no problem in getting
them to agree to the other provi
sions, Serna said. "I think Webb
Ranch is now very sincere about
getting those trailers done," he
said.
The University was informed
on Thursday that the four homes
had been declared unfit for use
and would soon be demolished,
Batkin said.
She delivered a letter to the
Webbs the same day that set
March 31 as the finai deadline for
construction of the new trailers,
and informed them that failure to
make improvements required for
human occupancy constitutes a

and a hard spot.'

"breach of your lease agreement
with Stanford University."
Batkin said she is "pretty satis
fied" with the timeline submitted
by the Webbs, although she added
that "we need to resolve what
things can be accomplished in foul
and fair weather."
English Prof. Ron Rebholz,
one of three Stanford professors
who visited the ranch in mid-Jan
uary to examine living conditions
there, said he is pleased with the
firm action taken by the Universi
ty" „ ,
"That's splendid news," he
said. "I think the Webbs must
have found the money (to com
plete the trailers) when the pub
licity got to them."
