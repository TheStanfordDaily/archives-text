# Betas setting sights on national charter
## 
### Katie Mauro Staff writer 
Tired of mere "provisional
colony" status, Stanford's Beta
Theta Pi fraternity is attempting
to restore its national charter, two
years after its revocation.
Although the Betas are recog
nized as a fraternity on campus —
both by the Office of Student Ac
tivities and the Interfraternity
Council — they are not au
tonomous in the eyes of their na
tional leadership.
According to Martin Dixon, a
member of the Beta's national of
fice, the Stanford chapter was
named a "provisional colony" last
October. As a provisional colony,

Dixon said, they cannot run them
selves, but are instead led by the
Beta chapter at Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo.
This year, however, Beta presi
dent Kurt Hurtado said the frater
nity's pledges wanted to regain
their national charter.
"The pledges were the ones who
really got us going for this," he said.
"We have also received a lot of sup
port from our alumni members.
They have always been there for us
both financially and morally."
When Dixon, who is in charge
of developing new charters, was
informed of the fraternity's de
sire to reestablish its national
membership, he immediately
flew from his office in Ohio to
Stanford. He met with all seven
nationally recognized Beta mem
bers on an individual basis.
In addition to the recognized
members, Hurtado says the fra
ternity has five or six non-initiat
ed members.
"These are mostly older guys
who don't feel it would be worth it
to become initiated at this point,"
Hurtado said.
In order to regain their old
house, located on the Row, the
fraternity must fulfill certain cri
teria. It has already met three of
the requirements: maintaining
good standing with the Interfra
ternity Council, adopting a local
set of by-laws and maintaining
regular contact with alumni. Now
it must remain free from miscon
duct and meet the 34-member
minimum requirement.
The Beta House is currently
being used for regular student
housing. However, Dixon said the

fraternity may fill the house by
May.
"In order to meet that goal,
though, we need to have a great
rush this year." he said. "We have
an agreement to fill the house in
five years in order to regain mem
bership."
For a successful Rush, Dixon
said the Betas must increase their
membership. Upperclassmen may
rush informally and bypass the
rush process. However, freshmen
must wait until Rush formally
begins in the spring to join the
fraternity.
"We are a group of really good
friends," said Hurtado. "It's hard
to have a real strong fraternity
without the formality of a nation
al charter."
The Betas lost their charter
with the national organization in
1990, due to a "mutual agree
ment," said Dixon. "There was
really a lack of communication.
Hurtado said the break was pri
marily due to "irreconcilable differ
ences."
"We had a series of problems
with the national chapter, and we
therefore severed our ties with
them," he said.
