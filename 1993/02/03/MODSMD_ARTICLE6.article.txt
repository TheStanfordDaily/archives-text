# 'Naked Guy' shows, tells all in Branner lounge
## 
### Joel Stein Staff writer 
Andrew Martinez has a small penis.
And he wasn't afraid to show it to the
crowd of more than 500 people assembled
in Branner Hall last night.
Martinez, a former UC-Berkeley junior,
was recently expelled by the university for
his refusal to wear clothes and is continuing
his crusade for nudist rights at speaking
events and interviews around the country.
"The Naked Guy," as he is affectionate
ly known on the Berkeley campus, gave a
very informal speech which touched upon
the issues he has confronted since shed
ding his clothing. Audience members were
encouraged to interrupt him with ques
tions, which ranged from the dangers of
naked exercise to his views on drugs.
A former rhetorics major, Martinez
spoke impressively, if bluntly, about his
decision to make nudity a full-time cru
sade against the "mainstream."
In particular, Martinez blamed Chris
tianity for stifling sexuality and structur
ing body image so that people feel uncom

fortable with their bodies. Clothes, he ar
gued, do not permit your body to feel all the
sensations he now experiences.
"Maybe that's part of the whole Christ
ian thing. You desensitize your body so you
won't feel like having sex," he syllogized in
his speech.
He also spoke about the lack of toler
ance on both the right and the left, calling
political correctness a limitation of expres
sion and criticizing the moral majority's
stranglehold on mainstream morality.
"I'm a very pro-drug person," said Mar
tinez, adding that he uses pot, acid and Ec
stasy. "I see a kid wearing a 'Drug users
should die' shirt and I'm like 'Wow. They're
like Hitler Youths.' But I can't go up to their
parent and say, 'Hey, that offends me.' "
Although jockish in appearance, the 6-
foot-4 Martinez said he styles himself a hippie
and wants to fight for "hippie-empower
ment." Hippies, he argued in an interview
after the speech, are a "historically oppressed
group" which he would like to empower.
"All these other groups are getting

empowered. I think they are the
most repressed group — because
of the drug thing."
Martinez, whose upper body
has been sculpted by years of
wrestling and football in high
school and recently by judo, said
he would still walk around nude
even if he were overweight and
hairy.
"I have a pretty small dick and
chicken legs," said Martinez,
adding that his body-image has
improved through his public

nudity.
"I think I'm just not hiding. I
don't like hiding. And I'm willing
to accept the consequences of
being a freak.
"So many people think I'm try
ing to do something bigger than I
am," he admitted. "I'm doing this
so I can walk around nude."
Since his expulsion hearings at
the end of last semester, which
included a sexual harassment suit
filed by one extremely offended
man in one of his classes, Mar
tinez has been busy spreading his
gospel.
"Nudity really has taken up
most of my time," said Martinez,
who prefers the moniker "Mili

tant Nudist" to "The Naked
Guy," which was given to him by
The Daily Californian.
Martinez now plans to spend
his time working on a lawsuit
against the university and writing
a book about his experiences.
Thus far, however, he has been
unable to find a lawyer.
The Berkeley office of the
American Civil Liberties Union
"negged me hardcore," he said.
Martinez said his mother has
been supportive of his cause since
seeing its impact. However, he
plans to begin supporting himself;
his needs, he said, have been
scaled back dramatically since he
grew up in Cupertino, where he

first went naked after his senior
year of high school. After he made
nudity a full-time avocation earli
er this year, he gave many of his
clothes to his brother.
For now, Martinez is support
ing himself through public speak
ing and talk-show appearances.
His first endorsement came last
night as sophomore Greg Siegel
slipped him $30 and threw him a
"Nick's Diner" hat.
Of his future, Martinez pre
dicted a "proletariat job" where
he would not be required to wear
more than his shorts.
"Or maybe I'll follow the
Dead," he said, heading off to a
rave.
