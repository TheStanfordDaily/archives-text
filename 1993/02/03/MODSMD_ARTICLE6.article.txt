# 'Naked Guy' shows, tells all in Branner lounge

### Joel Stein Staff writer 
Andrew Martinez has a small penis.
And he wasn't afraid to show it to the
crowd of more than 500 people assembled
in Branner Hall last night.
Martinez, a former UC-Berkeley junior,
was recently expelled by the university for
his refusal to wear clothes and is continuing
his crusade for nudist rights at speaking
events and interviews around the country.
"The Naked Guy," as he is affectionate
ly known on the Berkeley campus, gave a
very informal speech which touched upon
the issues he has confronted since shed
ding his clothing. Audience members were
encouraged to interrupt him with ques
tions, which ranged from the dangers of
naked exercise to his views on drugs.
A former rhetorics major, Martinez
spoke impressively, if bluntly, about his
decision to make nudity a full-time cru
sade against the "mainstream."
In particular, Martinez blamed Chris
tianity for stifling sexuality and structur

sensations he now experiences.
"Maybe that's part of the whole Christ
ian thing. You desensitize your body so you
won't feel like having sex," he syllogized in
his speech.
He also spoke about the lack of toler
ance on both the right and the left, calling
political correctness a limitation of expres
sion and criticizing the moral majority's
stranglehold on mainstream morality.
"I'm a very pro-drug person," said Mar
tinez, adding that he uses pot, acid and Ec
stasy. "I see a kid wearing a 'Drug users
should die' shirt and I'm like 'Wow. They're
like Hitler Youths.' But I can't go up to their
parent and say, 'Hey, that offends me.' "
Although jockish in appearance, the 6-
foot-4 Martinez said he styles himself a hippie
and wants to fight for "hippie-empower
ment." Hippies, he argued in an interview
after the speech, are a "historically oppressed
group" which he would like to empower.
"All these other groups are getting
