# Stanford students nude up

Andrew Martinez wasn't the only
naked person at Branner Hall last night.
Ten clothes-free Stanford students were
also in attendance, in what seemed to be a
culmination of campus nudist activity in
recent weeks.
Nudists have been springing up all over
the Farm this quarter: at Tresidder Union
last Friday and at Happy Hours at the En
chanted Broccoli Forest and Synergy, two

co-ops on campus.
"This isn't our first nude event and it
won't be our last," said a naked senior liv
ing in Synergy who chose to bare all but his
name. He said he began going sans clothes
around his co-op this year. "Last year at
this time, I thought it was gross."
Synergy brought eight of its residents,
five men and three women, to show their
support for Martinez.
"They wouldn't be bothered if more
people did it." yelled an encourag
ing, naked Synergy resident, who
seemed significantly more
adamant about his nudity than
Martinez.
Two Branner residents, one
male and one female, also decided
to de-apparel in celebration of
Martinez's fight against the
mainstream.
Hans Kramer, a freshman,
said he was glad to have been a
part of the mini nude-in, but did
not intend to make an issue of it
like Martinez did.
"I've got another cause that
I'm working on right now, so I
can't concentrate on my nudity,"
said Kramer, an ardent environ
mentalist.
The senior from Synergy said
Martinez would probably stand a
better chance with the Stanford
administration than he did with
the UC-Berkeley hierarchy.
"I think at Stanford there'd be
a bit more administrative
review," he said. "After all, they'd
be throwing out $22,000 a year."

More than 500 people crammed into Branner last night to hear a talk by Andrew Martinez, Berkeley's
"Naked Guy." Martinez wasn't the only one in a birthday suit, however. He was joined by 10 Stanford stu
dents who let it all hang out at the presentation.
