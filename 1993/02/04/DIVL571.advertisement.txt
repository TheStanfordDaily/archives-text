The entrepreneurial adventure of a lifetime.
At Infinity, you won't be just a cog in the machine. You
won't be maintaining someone else's code. You won't
sit in front of a Lotus spreadsheet for two years. Your
ideas won't get lost in a complex bureaucracy.
What you will do is meet major challenges head on.
You'll be a key member of our core development team
building state-of-the-art object-oriented trading systems
for the world's leading financial institutions. You'll
have responsibility for major projects from conception
to completion. You'll have the opportunity to work
alongside other top developers who will answer your
questions and listen to your ideas. You'll gain interna
tional business experience by helping to capture market
share in major financial centers like New York, London,
Tokyo and Toronto.
AND â€” you'll hold an equity position.
If you're a self-starter and a team player looking for an alternative experience,
come talk to us about opportunities in Software Engineering, Quality Control
and Technical Consulting. On-Campus interviews are February 23rd and
February 26th for Technical Majors (sign up by Feb. 9). Or if schedules are
full, send a cover letter, resume and unofficial transcript directly to:
