## Deputy defense secretary post for prof. 
### Angie Chuang Staff writer 
Prof. William Perry, nominated yes
terday by President Clinton to be De
fense Secretary Les Aspin's chief deputy,
is preparing to take up residence in
Washington again.
Perry, co-director of the Stanford Cen
ter for International Security and Arms
Control, was also confirmed by the Sen
ate yesterday afternoon.
He was "pleased, excited and looking
forward to" taking the position, accord
ing to colleague David Bernstein, a re
search associate at the center.
A former undersecretary of defense for
research and engineering in the Carter
administration, Perry is "very much at
home in Washington," said David Hol
loway, the center's other director.
Perry, 66, who teaches in the School of
Engineering, will leave Stanford as soon
as he has "cleared up" his business at the
center. "He will miss Stanford very
much," Bernstein said.
In an interview, Clinton expressed con
fidence in Perry's "unmatched" expertise

in military policy.
"Secretary
Aspin and I will
rely heavily on his
knowledge, imag
ination and judg
ment as we work
to keep our mili
tary the strongest
in the world in a
time of budgetary
constraint," Clin
ton told the Asso
ciated Press.
Perry's col
leagues echoed

this support, saying his interest and work
in the restructuring of defense technolo
gy and policy in the post-Cold War era —
particularly in the former Soviet Union
— make Perry well qualified to tackle
current defense policy issues.
"He's very clear minded in discussion
and very good at illumination of issues,"
Holloway said, describing Perry as hav
ing a "problem-solving mind."
