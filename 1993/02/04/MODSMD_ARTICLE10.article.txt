# Labor Sec. predicts 250,000 new jobs

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Clinton's economic stimulus package
will create an "immediate rush" of
250,000 new jobs and help the president
fulfill his promise of 8 million in four
years, Labor Secretary Robert Reich
said yesterday.
Reich said Clinton's economic pro
gram, which is still being developed,
would focus on initiatives that offered
the best promise of creating the most
jobs quickly. He said this was critical
because the current recovery, unlike
past upturns, threatens to leave many
people permanently unemployed.

Reich said Clinton has not made
final decisions on the economic stimu
lus program. But congressional
sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the administra
tion was studying a $31 billion short
term package that would include $16
billion in public works spending this
year and $15 billion in business tax
breaks, primarily from a targeted
investment tax credit.
Private economists, studying the
emerging outlines of Clinton's program,
said Reich's forecast of 250,000 new
jobs this year and 8 million over four

years was optimistic but not beyond the
realm of possibility.
However, they said numerous road
blocks could thwart these goals: from
bureaucratic delay in spending the
money to a Federal Reserve that could
slam on the brakes by raising interest
rates to fight inflation. They were more
optimistic about the short-term than
the long-term goal.
"These aren't outlandish claims by
any means," said Roger Brinner, an
economist at DRI-McGraw Hill Inc., the
country's largest private forecasting
firm.
