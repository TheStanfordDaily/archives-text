## Editorial New tutoring woes 
### 
Ravenswood program
troubled by large drop
in new freshmen tutors

Freshman year at Stan
ford is a blur of new faces,
often lower-than-expected
grades, fraternity parties and
other activities. Finding time for
all these pursuits can be difficult,
especially for a student not used to
the University's hectic pace. How
ever, this year's freshman class is
overlooking a number of activities
that will provide rewards long
after the grades are forgotten, the
hangovers are cured and Stanford
is nothing more than a fond mem
ory.
Organizations such as the Stan
ford Project on Nutrition, TEAM,
Barrio Assistance, the Stanford
Homelessness Action Community,
national public-service organiza
tions with Stanford chapters, and
tutoring groups allow Stanford
students to both better themselves
and the communities surrounding
the campus.
Unfortunately, certain organi
zations within the last category
are struggling for their lives. In
the past year, most notably, tutor
ing groups which send volunteers
to East Palo Alto have generally
seen the smallest enrollments
since their inception.
However, the number of upper
class volunteers in these programs
is similar to that in years past. The
deficit lies entirely at the doorstep
of the freshman class.
The problems afflicting the
Ravenswood tutoring program,
Stanford's largest, are typical of
those of other organizations.
Normally, 60 to 70 percent of
Ilavenswood's tutors are fresh
men, yet this year this figure
stands at only 40 percent â€” a
drop of approximately 40 stu
dents.
Coming in the wake of a new
poll that cited the nation's incom

ing freshmen as the most involved
in community affairs in history,
this fall-off is mystifying.
It is even more befuddling
when compared to the rapid
growth of other campus organiza
tions, such as the local branch of
Alpha Phi Omega, a public-service
fraternity.
It appears positively enigmatic,
when contrasted with the phenom
enal turnout for a public-service
fair early in the academic year.
At one such fair, 100 freshman
put their names on a list express
ing interest in the Ravenswood
project. The program contacted
every student. Only three are now
tutors.
Perhaps this discrepancy is
caused by the fact that
Ravenswood, and other tutoring
programs, require a commitment.
Two days a week, two hours a day,
for at least two quarters. Rain or
shine. No easy-to-miss chapter
meetings or optional activities.
The students depend on their
tutors to show up.
More pessimistically, perhaps
there is a difference in freshman
membership because tutoring
programs don't look quite as good
as a service fraternity on a
resume.
Oftentimes, people grow apa
thetic when they feel that their
ability to effect a change is mini
mal. However, tutoring is perhaps
the most direct and far-reaching
activity possible, at least on a per
sonal level.
The impact a tutor can have on
a child's life is enormous. Over 75
percent of students tutored by the
Ravenswood project witness sig
nificant improvement in their
reading and writing skills.
This improvement can be the
difference between a student
becoming confident in his ability
to learn or slowly losing interest
in his classes. It can make the dif
ference between a child eventual
ly becoming a doctor or a
dropout.
Forty tutors would be making a
heck of a difference right now.
