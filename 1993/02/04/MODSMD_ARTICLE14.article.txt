Kuwait also abused human rights during Gulf War

JOHN FORD'S COLUMN ON cam
pus apathy toward the current situ
ation between the U.S. and Iraq
merits our attention. Unfortunately, he
is right that little attention (let alone
indignation or outrage) is being focused
on recent U.S. attacks on Iraq. Yet
despite this lack of discussion, dialogue
or debate (or even, one might suppose,
thought) on the issues, relatively speak
ing, we as a community and as a country
think more about Iraq than the country
for which we ostensibly went to war in
the first place.
In December, I spent 10 days in
Kuwait as part of a small student delega
tion sponsored by Kuwait University and
the National Council on U.S.-Arab Rela
tions. I expected to return and engage in
discussion on the region two years after
the end of the Persian Gulf War, particu
larly concerning reconstruction, democ
racy and human rights in Kuwait. How
ever, renewed bombings have refocused
American attention on the Iraqi
"enemy."
Most of us recognize and remember
the Bush administration's hypocritical
and opportunistic use of Iraqi human
rights violations to justify U.S. interven

tion in the Gulf. Fewer know that signifi
cant numbers of abuses were also com
mitted by Kuwaitis upon the withdrawal
of Iraqi troops from Kuwait. After Feb.
26, 1991, scores of Palestinians, Iraqis
and others "disappeared" following their
arrest by Kuwaiti security forces and/or
armed civilians. These disappearances
took place in a climate of anti-foreigner
violence and hostility which prevailed
during the period of martial law which
lasted until June, 1991. Extrajudicial
executions and brutal beatings at the
hands of returning civilians or former
resistance fighters occurred throughout
these months, largely unimpeded by the
restored Kuwaiti government. Many
instances of torture, arbitrary deporta
tion, rape and other human-rights viola
tions from this period are as of yet unin
vestigated by the Kuwaiti authorities.
Although the abuses have now stopped,
over a year-and-a-half later at least 79
cases of disappearance remain unre
solved, and the government is taking no
apparent steps to investigate these occur
rences.
Kuwait is in a unique position to
establish accountability for the human
rights abuses perpetrated in the months

following the war's end, because it is
such a small state and, unlike many
other countries, the executive branch has
tight control over the military. And, the
U.S. is in a privileged position to demand
this accountability. The Bush adminis
tration was reluctant to focus attention
on these abuses — rightly recognizing
that to do so would point out the contra
dictions within U.S. foreign policy which
allow us to ignore human rights abuses
when committed by our allies and exploit
them politically against our enemies. In
addition, publicly denouncing these abus
es would make it difficult to continue our
support of the Kuwaiti government, at a
time when that country has agreed to
purchase billions of dollars of U.S.-man
ufactured military equipment (in the
interests of "interoperability" in a future
crisis) and is seen as a strategic ally in
the "unstable" Gulf region.
It has become increasingly unclear
over the past weeks what policy will
guide the actions of President Clinton in
dealing with Kuwait. After repeatedly
proclaiming his intent to maintain a pro
gram consistent with Bush's, we must
wonder if he too will allow these abuses
to fade into the past, excused as "under

standable excesses" of the postwar period
(as the abuses were called by the newly
selected Kuwaiti ambassador to the
U.S.). My insistence that our govern
ment focus on abuses committed (or
effectively allowed) by Kuwaiti security
forces is in no way to detract from the
atrocities of the Iraqi occupation. As
human-rights activists have repeatedly
stated, Kuwait's behavior is not to be
judged in comparison with that of Iraq,
but rather must be held up to interna
tionally accepted standards. In fact, it is
precisely because of the relatively open
nature of Kuwait's political system that I
believe we can successfully pressure the
government to take action to resolve
these cases. Because of U.S. actions in
the Gulf War, Americans — even, or per
haps especially, those of us who opposed
the war — are in a position to influence
both governments to investigate these
abuses and bring those responsible to
justice.
According to John Ford, "We're tired
of talking about Hussein and 1raq...." I
would suggest that we never even started
talking about Kuwait. Now is the time.
