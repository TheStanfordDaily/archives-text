# Shultz was against arm deals with Iran
## 
### 
Hank Edson, class of '89, has some
weird ideas about former Secretary of
State George Shultz. The most impor
tant action Shultz took during his time
in office was to protect President Ronald
Reagan and this country from involve
ment with the fundamentalist Mafia
which controls Iran. Shultz, as his mem
oir in Time Magazine clearly demon
strates, was opposed to negotiating with
the kidnappers of American citizens, if
paying ransom meant that Americans in

the Middle East would be subject to kid
napping. You need a tank, go grab an
American tourist somewhere. Shultz
offered his resignation to President Rea
gan several times but Reagan was canny
enough not to accept it.
Perhaps even greater proof of Shultz's
integrity are the venomous personal
attacks on him by former Secretary of
State James Baker and by extension, by
George Bush. These attacks are reported
extensively in "At the Highest Levels:
The Inside Story of the End of the Cold
War", by Michael R. Beschloss and
Strobe Talbott. I am sure that neither
Baker nor Bush regarded Shultz as an
accomplice in the arms-for-hostages deal.

Despite Mr. Edson, Mr. Shultz honors
the Hoover Institution with his pres
ence.
