# Daily hypocritical by reacting to Huyck
## 
### 
Time for a reality check. Was it Mon
day that the Daily editorial proclaimed
that it would abandon "reactive editori
als" and that it would strive to "enter
tain" and "humor" us? Is it Tuesday
that I'm reading a reactive piece lectur

ing us because some were amused last
Friday in White Plaza? You complain
about Huyck's self-promotion and his
buttocks. Was it last week that I read
that Stanford would never have a Naked
Guy, and "that's too bad?" Has a little
known puritanical PC streak been
exposed at The Daily?
It is ridiculous to suggest that the
crowd turned up expecting the show that
ensued. The common ground seemed to
be the hope that someone would debate
the pants off Huyck. I guess that makes
us the butt of his joke. Again!
