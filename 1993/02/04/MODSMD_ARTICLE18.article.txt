## Are ethnics Americans? 
### 
IN THE MODERN WORLD OF
"heightened political awareness" we
have created a system of labeling
Americans. If you are not white, all we
need do is take your ethnicity and add a
hyphenated American to it and, voila, we
now have classified you as a color on the
rainbow.
Being academics and intellectuals, we
try to argue about the importance vs. the
danger of political correctness, and the
proponents argue that with terms like
African-American or Asian-American, we
are creating our own terms and com
manding our own respect.
Mainstream America has had hard a
time with this, especially our friends at
the far right who have tried to make a
First Amendment-issue debate out of it,
while the rest of us have wasted a lot of
time with the fine tuning of ambiguous
speech codes, trying to make sure they do
not violate the Constitution.
Why do we do this? I think the reason
for the debate and misunderstanding
from both sides is that neither actually
realize what the debate is about. We have
not brought our current discourse, lan
guage and thought processes into histori
cal context to show how what we say is a
reflection of a dominant Western
paradigm of thought. The fact that some
one labeled this challenge to the
paradigm "political correctness" killed
the movement from the beginning,

because political correctness, like the cur
rent paradigm, assumes that it is an
absolute universal truth and anything
outside its parameters is incorrect.
I am suggesting that first, you
remove the self-defeating term of "polit
ical correctness," and second, deal with
the real issue, the challenge of the cur
rent Western paradigm of thought and
classification. Use history as your
weapon to show the origins of these
thought patterns that create the dis
course and, consequently, the destruc
tive words we use.
For example, up until now we have
argued on the level of "don't say black,
say 'African-American' " or "don't say
Indians, say 'Native Americans,' " and
the weak reason we've given is "say these
things because it is politically correct."
What we need to show is not how the new
appellations are so good and correct, but
how the accepted terms came to be, and
how they function to support a dominant
mode of thinking.
The real reason that we are ethnic-
Americanizing everything is because we
are not all Americans.
How can American society in good
faith teach little black children about
"our American independence day"and
the glory of the founding of this country
when their "founding fathers and moth
ers" were still classified as three-fifths
sub-human slaves on July 4, 1776? How

can young Japanese children sing "Amer
ica the Beautiful" when only 50 years ago
"the land that I love" was quarantining
so-called Japanese-Americans during
WWII. How could Uncle Sam be so cruel
to his own kin? Simple. He doesn't see all
of us as kin.
The reality is that we are all not
Americans. We are a fragmented, disas
sociated and aimless group of people try
ing in vain to find a common thread that
co-identifies us as Americans. All "non
normal" peoples (i.e. non-white, non
male, non-heterosexual) have had a com
pletely different historical consciousness
that American society has tried to dis
guise in the education system. So the
best we've been able to do is beg dis
gracefully at the doorstep of Uncle Sam,
trying to convince him how American we
really are by "ethnic-Americanizing"
ourselves.
We need to stop asking Uncle Sam to
see us as equal, but rather study why he
has done everything but Americanize his
"illegitimate kin" since he first set foot
on this continent.
