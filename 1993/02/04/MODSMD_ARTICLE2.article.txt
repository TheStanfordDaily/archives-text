A congressionally mandated
commission yesterday presented a
proposal to guarantee $14,000 a
year in financial aid for every U.S.
college student, regardless of fam
ily income.
Citing "rising anxiety in Ameri
ca" over the skyrocketing costs of a
college education, the bipartisan
panel recommended that the feder
al government spend an additional
$7 billion a year on student aid.
Although bankers and some pri
vate financial aid officials criticized
the plan as unworkable, Education
Secretary Richard Riley said he
was "delighted" with the findings
of the National Commission on Re
sponsibilities for Financing Post
secondary Education.
The panel recommended that the
government set a standard amount
of federal aid that all students may
receive. Under the proposal, all stu
dents would have access to $14,000
a year in federal aid. The aid would
be comprised of grants, work-study
programs and loans, depending on a
family's income.
"They haven't yet announced a
specific formula," said senior
Michelle Mello, chairwoman of the
ASSU's Financial Aid Advocates.
"But if it's not a large percentage
of grants, it doesn't mean much.
Most students are already maxed
out on loans and work-study."
According to the Washington
Post, poor students, for example,
would be eligible for up to $4,000
in grants and $10,000 in work
study and subsidized loans. The
amount of grant money reflects a
$1,700 increase, up from the cur
rent $2,300 a year.
Students from families with in
comes over $100,000 would also
qualify for $14,000 in aid, but the
entire amount would be unsubsi
dized government loans. And unlike
poorer students, these families would
have to pay back their loan interest
while the student was still in school, the
Post reported.
Robert Huff, director of the Financial
Aid Office, said he "has to take a real
hard look at the proposal."
"I can't say offhand if its good or bad
for Stanford students," he said, "but if
we get more federal help it is in the
interests of the University."
The recommendations follow two
years of public hearings around the
nation and echo many of President Clin
ton's campaign promises. Clinton

promised to overhaul the federal stu
dent-aid system.
During the 1980s, the cost of attend
ing a private jumped by 146 percent, the
commission noted. But at the same
time, federal aid failed to help families
to keep up with the rising costs.
The panel suggested revamping the
current aid system, which is run by the
Department of Education and involves
state agencies, banks and other financial
institutions. Under the proposal, private
financial institutions would be cut out of
the aid program and a direct govern
ment loan system would take its place.
"This report steps on a lot a powerful
financial toes" and those who favor the
proposed reforms "are going to have to
get in and fight for it," said Sen. Paul
Simon, D-111.

The General Accounting Office said
moving away from private sector capi
talization would generate at least $1 bil
lion in savings.
Other recommendations by the com
mission include:
• A national service program similar to,
but smaller than, the one Clinton
promised during the campaign. For the
first year, the commission recommend
ed a 50,000-student program that would
forgive 20 percent of each student's
loan;
• Easing the repayment burden on stu
dents who take lower-paying jobs;
• Allowing tax deductions on student
loans;
• And penalty-free withdrawals from
individual retirement accounts to pay
tuition costs.
