A congressionally mandated
commission yesterday presented a
proposal to guarantee $14,000 a
year in financial aid for every U.S.
college student, regardless of fam
ily income.
Citing "rising anxiety in Ameri
ca" over the skyrocketing costs of a
college education, the bipartisan
panel recommended that the feder
al government spend an additional
$7 billion a year on student aid.
Although bankers and some pri
vate financial aid officials criticized
the plan as unworkable, Education
Secretary Richard Riley said he
was "delighted" with the findings
of the National Commission on Re
sponsibilities for Financing Post
secondary Education.
The panel recommended that the
government set a standard amount
of federal aid that all students may
receive. Under the proposal, all stu
dents would have access to $14,000
a year in federal aid. The aid would
be comprised of grants, work-study
programs and loans, depending on a
family's income.
"They haven't yet announced a
specific formula," said senior
Michelle Mello, chairwoman of the
ASSU's Financial Aid Advocates.
"But if it's not a large percentage
of grants, it doesn't mean much.
Most students are already maxed
out on loans and work-study."
According to the Washington
Post, poor students, for example,
would be eligible for up to $4,000
in grants and $10,000 in work
study and subsidized loans. The
amount of grant money reflects a
$1,700 increase, up from the cur
rent $2,300 a year.
Students from families with in
comes over $100,000 would also
qualify for $14,000 in aid, but the
entire amount would be unsubsi
dized government loans. And unlike
