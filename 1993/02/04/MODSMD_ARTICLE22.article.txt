# Women send four to tourney
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
Stanford's top women's tennis players will
get a break from their team schedule this week
end to take on some of the best in the country
at the Rolex National Indoor Championships in
Minneapolis. Juniors Laxmi Poruri and Kris
tine Kurth, freshman Beth Berris and senior
team-captain Heather Willens will compete
today in the first round of the championships,
scheduled to last until Sunday.
Poruri and Willens will compete both indi
vidually and as a doubles team, while the team
of Berris and Kurth will play in another dou
bles spot. Each competitor qualified for the
championships on the basis of their perfor
mance in the Rolex Regionals last October at
Stanford Tennis Stadium.
Berris, however, has had nagging leg prob
lems this week, and might be the Cardinal's one
source of worry in the tournament.
Poruri should face some of the toughest
competition she's met since taking over the No.
1 spot for the Cardinal this year, and Brennan
believes the junior is ready for the challenge.
"There's no pressure on her â€” she has a great
game and she goes out and plays it," Brennan
said. "She'll do well against the competition."
Stanford will resume team competition
Wednesday, Feb. 10 against Washington State.
Match time is 1:30 p.m. at Stanford Tennis Sta
dium.
