# Lammersen stands tall, waits for shoe to fit
## 
### Mike McDonough Staff writer 
Last year, Bart Lammersen spent most of his
time watching Stanford great Adam Keefe work his
magic in the low post, learning the proper way for a
power forward to move to the hoop, pump fake, box
out, crash the boards, shoot the turn-around jumper
and utterly pound the opponent into submission.
What Lammersen didn't count on was having to
fill those shoes so soon.
Because of injuries to senior Jim Morgan and
freshman Darren Allaway, Lammersen has seen a
great deal of playing time at the power forward posi
tion this year, starting in 13 of Stanford's 18 games
to this point. For Lammersen, it's been trial-by-fire
as a Cardinal starter.
"1 figured all along I would start, eventually,"
Lammersen said. "But I thought if I was going to
start, it wouldn't happen the way it did — by
default."
Lammersen came to Stanford from James Madi
son High School in Vienna, Va., where during his
senior season he averaged 19 points, 13 rebounds
and four blocked shots a game while leading his 21-4
team to the semifinals of the Virginia regional tour
nament ranked No. 2 in the state. His two "20-20"
games that year (20 points, 20 rebounds) attracted
the attention of Montgomery and Stanford.
"After the recruiting, it came down to William
and Mary or Stanford," Lammersen said. "I wanted

to go to a place with good basketball and good aca
demics."
Lammersen opted for Stanford where, during his
first year, he spent a good deal of time on the bench
as Keefe's backup. However, the former high-school
star had no problem playing second-fiddle to Keefe.
"He's definitely a role model for me and for my
game," Lammersen said. "I'd play against him every
day in practice and pick up little things along the
way — to move here, to muscle inside or to shoot this
way. I think he's the greatest player Stanford's ever
had."
Picking up where Keefe left off has been no easy
task for Lammersen, who sees himself filling a dif
ferent role in this year's Cardinal offense.
" I think my strength is going in there and keeping
the offense moving," Lammersen said. "I just want
to go in there and do what the team needs — if that's
setting a great pick or tipping a ball or whatever."
Sometimes, Lammersen says, the most satisfying
plays are not the ones in which he scores, but rather
ones where he helps other players to score.
"I like it when I can set a pick on Pete's I Dukes]
guy and Pete nails the three," Lammersen said.
On the flip side, Lammersen feels he needs more
playing time to develop into a consistent low-post
scorer.
"Sizewise, I'd like to be bigger, by about 20
pounds — that way I can be more of a presence
inside," Lammersen said. "Just playing a lot this
year and knowing where to shoot, I think I've

improved."
With the amount of game time he's seen in the
past two weeks, Lammersen continues to work for
the kind of improvement that will allow him to com
pete with the best of the big men in the Pacific 10
Conference.
"Right now, I'm working to get confidence in
myself and in my game," Lammersen said. "I need to
get myself to the point where I can get the ball and
know I can score — on anyone, at any time."
This year, however, Lammersen and the Cardinal
have struggled, losing six-straight games while being
plagued by injuries. Trouble continues for Stanford
inside, as Todd Manley's hyperextended knee will
keep him from playing at full strength this weekend.
To make matters worse, Lammersen's sprained
ankle, suffered in a practice session Monday, makes
him another question mark for Stanford this Thurs
day at Arizona.
These problems have added up to a gloomy season
for the Cardinal this year, and Lammersen, among
others, feels the frustration.
"I don't really know what it is this year," he said.
"We seem to be hanging around in a lot of these
games, we just can't close them out."
However, Lammersen is optimistic about his
team's chances in the Valley of the Sun against Ari
zona and Arizona State this weekend.
"They're beatable, definitely," Lammersen said.
"Last year, we played them tight, and we'll have a
chance against them if we play up to our capability."
For Lammersen, that might depend on how much
he can emulate the play of his Ail-American mentor
— and someone else. Surprisingly, Lammersen was
influenced by the play of another former Stanford
big man, though he came a little before Lam
mersen's time.
"As a senior (in high school), I watched Andrew Vla
hov in some games here," Lammersen said. "He's such
an intimidator — he did what it took to help the team."
Of course, Lammersen would have no problem
with people comparing him to the likes of Vlahov or
Keefe someday.
"Stanford's had such a great line of big guys come
through over the years," he said. "Hopefully, I can
be the next in that line."

However, Lammersen is optimistic about his
team's chances in the Valley of the Sun against Ari
zona and Arizona State this weekend.
"They're beatable, definitely," Lammersen said.
"Last year, we played them tight, and we'll have a
chance against them if we play up to our capability."
For Lammersen, that might depend on how much
he can emulate the play of his Ail-American mentor
— and someone else. Surprisingly, Lammersen was
influenced by the play of another former Stanford
big man, though he came a little before Lam
mersen's time.
"As a senior (in high school), I watched Andrew Vla
hov in some games here," Lammersen said. "He's such
an intimidator — he did what it took to help the team."
Of course, Lammersen would have no problem
with people comparing him to the likes of Vlahov or
Keefe someday.
"Stanford's had such a great line of big guys come
through over the years," he said. "Hopefully, I can
be the next in that line."

While this season hasn't exactly been a ball for Bart Lammersen and the Cardinal men's basketball
team, the sophomore power forward hopes to stand out as one of Stanford's great big men by the time
he graduates.
Last year, Bart Lammersen spent most of his
time watching Stanford great Adam Keefe work his
magic in the low post, learning the proper way for a
power forward to move to the hoop, pump fake, box
out, crash the boards, shoot the turn-around jumper
and utterly pound the opponent into submission.
What Lammersen didn't count on was having to
fill those shoes so soon.
Because of injuries to senior Jim Morgan and
freshman Darren Allaway, Lammersen has seen a
great deal of playing time at the power forward posi
tion this year, starting in 13 of Stanford's 18 games
to this point. For Lammersen, it's been trial-by-fire
as a Cardinal starter.
"1 figured all along I would start, eventually,"
Lammersen said. "But I thought if I was going to
start, it wouldn't happen the way it did — by
default."
Lammersen came to Stanford from James Madi
son High School in Vienna, Va., where during his
senior season he averaged 19 points, 13 rebounds
and four blocked shots a game while leading his 21-4
team to the semifinals of the Virginia regional tour
nament ranked No. 2 in the state. His two "20-20"
games that year (20 points, 20 rebounds) attracted
the attention of Montgomery and Stanford.
"After the recruiting, it came down to William
and Mary or Stanford," Lammersen said. "I wanted

to go to a place with good basketball and good aca
demics."
Lammersen opted for Stanford where, during his
first year, he spent a good deal of time on the bench
as Keefe's backup. However, the former high-school
star had no problem playing second-fiddle to Keefe.
"He's definitely a role model for me and for my
game," Lammersen said. "I'd play against him every
day in practice and pick up little things along the
way — to move here, to muscle inside or to shoot this
way. I think he's the greatest player Stanford's ever
had."
Picking up where Keefe left off has been no easy
task for Lammersen, who sees himself filling a dif
ferent role in this year's Cardinal offense.
" I think my strength is going in there and keeping
the offense moving," Lammersen said. "I just want
to go in there and do what the team needs — if that's
setting a great pick or tipping a ball or whatever."
Sometimes, Lammersen says, the most satisfying
plays are not the ones in which he scores, but rather
ones where he helps other players to score.
"I like it when I can set a pick on Pete's I Dukes]
guy and Pete nails the three," Lammersen said.
On the flip side, Lammersen feels he needs more
playing time to develop into a consistent low-post
scorer.
"Sizewise, I'd like to be bigger, by about 20
pounds — that way I can be more of a presence
inside," Lammersen said. "Just playing a lot this
year and knowing where to shoot, I think I've

improved."
With the amount of game time he's seen in the
past two weeks, Lammersen continues to work for
the kind of improvement that will allow him to com
pete with the best of the big men in the Pacific 10
Conference.
"Right now, I'm working to get confidence in
myself and in my game," Lammersen said. "I need to
get myself to the point where I can get the ball and
know I can score — on anyone, at any time."
This year, however, Lammersen and the Cardinal
have struggled, losing six-straight games while being
plagued by injuries. Trouble continues for Stanford
inside, as Todd Manley's hyperextended knee will
keep him from playing at full strength this weekend.
To make matters worse, Lammersen's sprained
ankle, suffered in a practice session Monday, makes
him another question mark for Stanford this Thurs
day at Arizona.
These problems have added up to a gloomy season
for the Cardinal this year, and Lammersen, among
others, feels the frustration.
"I don't really know what it is this year," he said.
"We seem to be hanging around in a lot of these
games, we just can't close them out."
However, Lammersen is optimistic about his
team's chances in the Valley of the Sun against Ari
zona and Arizona State this weekend.
"They're beatable, definitely," Lammersen said.
