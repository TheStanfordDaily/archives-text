## Nitrate wishes & Celluloid dreams 
### 
I still remember the first movie I
ever saw. It was the day of a friend's
birthday party, and after unwrap
ping all the gifts and devouring the
cake, it was still pretty early. So the
adults took us to see "The Great
Muppet Caper."
There was something magical
about sitting in the
large, plush chairs ___________

with a tub of pop
corn, not quite
knowing what to ex
pect. The lights went

down, the curtain opened and the
Muppets burst onto the screen,
charming and wisecracking their
way through the movie for an excit
ing 90 minutes.
When the lights came up, I want
ed to stay there and watch it all over
again. But my parents weren't regular
moviegoers, so my next trip to the local
cinema was a long time coming.
The next movie I saw was
"Gandhi." I don't remember exactly
what happened in the film — it was
three hours long, and it's been awhile.
I do remember that it was the first
time a movie had ever made me cry.
And I couldn't understand why
I was crying. I mean, this old guy had
been shot down at the beginning of
the movie. So what was the point of
crying when they showed the same
footage all over again?
But the film that most profoundly
affected me was a feature film that I saw
in the worst of all possible conditions
— on cable TV. Flipping channels late
one night looking for something inter
esting, I came across "Taxi Driver."
Raised on standard television
fare, I found the film disturbing and
unpleasant. I had no frame of refer
ence to appreciate a film about a

N'Gai Croal

lonely, psychotic taxi driver who tries
to impress his dream date by taking
her to a porno movie, and when that
doesn't work, tries to kill the political
candidate that she works for. So I
shut off the TV and went to sleep.
When I came to Stanford, I got the
chance to see the film again. I don't
think that I'd made
any giant leaps in

my development at
that point. But
something had

changed. Now I
could appreciate the level of the artistry
— the prowling camera, the bizarre an
gles, the jump cuts, the long takes, the
odd naturalism of the performances.
And there was something cathartic
about the seaminess of the film. It ex
posed me to the dark underbelly of so
ciety where pushers, pimps, prostitutes
and psychos all hang out — something
I didn't get to experience in suburbia.
So the little kid who loved
sappy, feel-good Hollywood movies
is no more. He grew up — and got
turned on to Martin Scorsese, David
Cronenberg, David Lynch and Spike
Lee. Filmmakers who relentlessly ex
pose the part of ourselves that we'd
all like to deny, who refuse to shy
away from our ignoble impulses.
Filmmakers for whom expletives
and explosive violence are the rhyme
and meter of their visual poetry.
I blame my parents for that.
They never took me to see "E.T."
But the magic is still there. Every
time I go into a movie theater and sit
down in the chairs waiting for the
lights to dim, I never quite knowing
what to expect. I just sit back, relax
and pray that it's a good one.
'Cause seven bones is a lot of
money to waste these days.
