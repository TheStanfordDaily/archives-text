# Russians show off Mars Rover

A "walk" down a small set of steps
might lead to another giant leap for
mankind.
Showing off their "Mars Rover," a
group of Russian scientists said their
vehicle may be stepping stone toward
an extensive mission to explore Mars
and could assess the possibility of
human colonization of the red planet
in as little as 30 years.
The Rover, resembling a mini-all
terrain vehicle, has titanium wheels,
in addition to a flexible body. It reach
es speeds of up to a few feet per second
and has the ability to climb ledges and
travel over gaps.

In yesterday's demonstration, the
Mars Rover descended down from a
platform and proceeded to "walk"
down the steps of the Mitchell Earth
Sciences Building, to the delight of
many observers.
Though the Russians have the
Rover, they aren't the only ones work
ing to get to Mars.
For five years, Stanford's Engineer
ing 235 class has been performing a
study that will develop plans for a joint
U.S.-Russian robotic mission to Mars as
well as subsequent manned missions,
said Bruce Lusignan, director of the
Communications Satellite Planning
Center and the teacher of the course.
Lusignan said that the class is not

only taken by engineers but also by
students in "medicine, political sci
ence, biology, and international stud
ies," since the ultimate goal of the
multi-national mission is to create a
colony suitable for human life.
A mission of such magnitude could
cost $300 to $500 billion, said a
spokesman for McDonnell Douglas,
which is also involved in the research.
The spokesman explained the pur
pose of a joint venture, saying that the
Russians, who possess "world-class ca
pabilities in space exploration," also
have very limited economic resources. A

Developed in Russia, the Mars Rover is scheduled to explore the red planet in 1996. Yesterday it navigated the steps
of the Mitchell Earth Sciences Building.
