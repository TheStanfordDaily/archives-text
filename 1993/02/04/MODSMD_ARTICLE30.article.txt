## Theater lives on in the Video Age 
### 
We live in the video age. The
Romans had bread and cir
cuses; we have bread and
television. Television and movies
drive modern American life. It's
what people do. It's what people talk
about. Say "Hamlet" and a picture of
Mel Gibson leaps to mind.

Well, maybe
it's not that bad.
But it seems as if
the glory days of
the theater have
passed. Real, live

people doing things live, in front of a
live audience. Three dimensions. Not
at Blockbuster. "Oedipus," "Romeo
and Juliet," "Death of a Salesman."
Remember that?
People who love theater, they
will invariably state that theater is
significantly better than film. At a
gut level I can feel that it is true. But
it's a challenging position to defend.
But it is the fact that a live play is
more likely to be deeply effectual
than a film.
It is difficult to convince a movie
audience that what they are watching is
special. Why should I believe that what
I'm watching is special I could have just
waited for the video that I'll see a dozen
times anyway?
Film and television are not like
life — they don't come briefly and
then disappear forever. Rather, they
are like photographs that can be
viewed repeatedly and will always be
the same image.
Movies and television undeniably
separate the viewer and the viewed.
Theatrical wunderkind Robert Lepage
called theater "the art of ceremony." It
tries to make people commune; not
only to see life unfolding before them,
but to get them to see what's before

them as part of who they are—the au
dience member and the play going
through this world together, as part of
the human condition.

The video age also breeds a mass
of mediocrity. Rarely is something
phenomenal. Rarely is something truly
hideous. Theater has managed to re
tain the full spec-

trum. In drama,
one is still free to
strive for tran
scendent great
ness. But the

greater the possibility of epiphany, the
greater the possibility of disaster.
So drama lives on a marvelous
teeter — totter between colossal suc
cess and utter failure. That balance
that is one of the great providers of
theater's power. A refreshing uncer
tainty in this all-knowing age.
Yet still theater seems to struggle.
But maybe times are changing.
Look at America. The line between
Broadway and Off —Broadway has
eroded noticeably. Recently, Robert
Schenkkan's "The Kentucky Cycle"
became the first play to win the
Pulitzer Prize without playing in
New York. And musical theater has
again achieved some household—
name shows ("Cats," "Les Mis
arables," "Phantom of the Opera").
Maybe times are changing. Look
at Stanford. This year the Drama De
partment had three fairly strong
shows running at once ("The
Duchess of Malfi," "A Room of One's
Own," "The Canterbury Tales") and
turned people away from all three.
Ram's Heads "West Side Story" had a
huge auditions turnout. And The
Daily even has a theater column.
Maybe times are changing. I
hope so.
